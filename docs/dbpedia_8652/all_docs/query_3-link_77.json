        "text": "Sarah Kennedy completed her physiotherapy training at Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand in 2005. She returned home to Vancouver and began to work in private practice, helping clients recover from personal injury and chronic pain. Sarah developed a special interest in conditions of the head, neck and jaw which led her to becoming a Certified Cervical and Temporomandibular Therapist in 2010 via the American Academy of Orofacial Pain, an advanced Vestibular Rehabilitation therapist in 2012 and an advanced Facial Neuromuscular Rehabilitation Therapist in 2015. For dizziness, headaches, migraines, post-concussion symptoms, neck pain, facial muscle dysfunction, Bell’s Palsy, chronic pain, and temporomandibular (jaw) dysfunction Sarah Kennedy has a level of continuing education and clinical experience far beyond that of most general physiotherapy practitioners.\n\nOutside of her work as a physiotherapist Sarah obtained a diploma in jazz and contemporary voice and has maintained a part-time career as a performing jazz vocalist. Wishing to incorporate her love of music into her practice she relocated to Montréal in 2019. Despite the pandemic she successfully completed a Masters in Creative Arts Therapies with a focus in Music Therapy. She is now also a Certificed Music Therapist through the Canadian Association of Music Therapy. The additional perspectives and clinical approaches in Music Therapy added to Sarah's understanding of the psychoemotional components of pain management.\n\nSarah now resides in Montréal. She works out of Santé Axio as a physiotherapist and has an independent private practice as a music therapist. With 17 years of experience, she draws on her eclectic knowledge to help clients overcome barriers to performance, wellbeing and physical comfort. Her approach focuses on education and empowering clients with the knowledge and skills needed to improve or eliminate their symptoms, and to prevent recurrence and aggravation in the long-term. She also strives to help clients develop a healthy relationship to their body and their pain. Ideally, the goal is that clients reach a degree of success in managing their own wellbeing such that treatment is no longer needed."
