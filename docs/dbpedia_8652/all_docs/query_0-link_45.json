        "text": "On a Saturday afternoon in 1995 - five years before Sarah Payne's disappearance - a scruffy man with oil-stained hands parked in a cul-de-sac in Crawley, West Sussex, and began to watch three girls playing in the early spring sunshine.\n\nAfter a few moments the man, Roy Whiting, checked no one else was around and walked over to the friends. Suddenly he made a grab for the trio and ordered them into his car. Two escaped, but a third was thrown into the red Ford Sierra.\n\nIt was the start of a dreadful, two-hour ordeal for the nine-year-old girl. She was driven 30 miles to a secluded wooded area, ordered to strip, threatened with a knife and told she would be tied up if she did not do what she was told.\n\nWhiting indecently assaulted the terrified child before eventually dropping her back in her neighbourhood. She told police what he did was \"disgraceful, disgusting\".\n\nHe was quickly found and confessed to kidnapping and indecently assaulting the girl, offences for which he could have received life and 10 years. He told police he stopped to urinate and \"snapped\". He said he felt \"panic\" even as he committed the crime.\n\nBut the way Whiting's case was dealt with in the courts has caused children's charities, criminal justice experts and psychiatrists to express deep concern.\n\nHis counsel pleaded skilfully for leniency, making much of a report from a psychiatrist who did not find - despite the nature of his crime - that Whiting was a paedophile.\n\nWhiting's barrister also managed to argue successfully that he did not plan the abduction, though he had a knife and rope with him. He said Whiting was desperately keen to receive treatment in prison and should be sentenced as a man who would not necessarily pose a risk in the future.\n\nTo the shock of the victim's family, and to the horror of the Paynes when they learned the details of Whiting's previous offence, he was sentenced to four years.\n\nAfter two years and five months behind bars - during which time he refused any form of treatment - he was released and by November 1997 was living near the seafront at Littlehampton, a few miles from the cornfield where he was to find Sarah.\n\nWhiting was born in 1959 in Horsham, West Sussex, the son of a metal worker, George, and Pamela. The family home was a council terrace in Crawley, where Whiting lived until he married at 27.\n\nRoy was a quiet boy who did not make friends easily. He was not academic and struggled at Ifield Community College, where he attended remedial classes. Because he was isolated he was also sometimes picked on.\n\nTraumatic event\n\nHome life was not happy. Police say there is no evidence he was abused - childhood abuse is common in sex offenders - but when he was 11 or 12 there was a traumatic event, which was fleetingly mentioned during the 1995 case. His counsel said he had \"drawn down a conscious barrier... in respect of that incident\". Quite what the incident was remains unclear.\n\nThere was certainly tragedy in Whiting's early life. When he was three, a baby sister, Claire, died at one month old, having been born with a number of disabilities. Before Whiting was born his parents also suffered the loss of a two-day-old son due to congenital heart disease.\n\nWhen Whiting was 17 his mother left home and remarried. A practical man, he became a mechanic and spent free weekends stock car racing. He had few female friends until he met a woman called Linda Booker when he was filling his car at the petrol station where she worked.\n\nThey married in June 1986 but the union was a disaster. He was evicted from the garage where he was working because he did not pay the rent and the couple often argued about money.\n\nIn 1987 Linda, who was five years Whiting's junior, had a son but Whiting had already left her. Since then he has had very little contact with the child.\n\nHe had relationships with several women - including one much younger than him who, according to his ex-wife, looked like a \"gangster's moll\" - but they never lasted. Inevitably he would blame them for the break-up.\n\nPointless lies\n\nHe was also known for telling pointless lies and dreaming up plans which had no chance of coming to fruition. Many relatives and acquaintances see him as a Walter Mitty character.\n\nBy March 1995 when he abducted the nine-year-old, Whiting was working as a mechanic in an old farmyard and living above the shop. Colleagues recall him habitually disappearing in the afternoon.\n\nOne said: \"He got into the habit of sloping off at about 3.30 each afternoon and would get back at 4.30. We called this 'the school run' because he was once seen parked near a local school when the kids were coming out.\" Nevertheless his workmates were shocked when he abducted and assaulted the nine-year-old girl.\n\nThe similarities between Whiting's two offences are chilling. Shortly before both, he went off sick and bought the vehicle he used in the abduction. On both occasions he drove the victim to a secluded spot.\n\nBoth offences were committed on a Saturday. On both occasions he had a knife and the means to tie the victim up.\n\nBoth times he altered his own appearance and that of the vehicle after the offence. On the earlier occasion he removed grey from his hair and peeled off a cartoon sticker from the car which he reasoned the girl might remember. After killing Sarah he cleaned himself up and removed panelling from his van and replaced its back doors.\n\nA criminal psychologist who advised police over Whiting believes he was building towards another attack in the weeks before Sarah's death, even if he did not realise this himself.\n\nBut how was it that Whiting was allowed to strike twice in five years?\n\nWhen he was sentenced in 1995 at Lewes crown court - where the Sarah Payne trial was heard - a report by psychiatrist Anthony Farrington was presented to the judge.\n\nThe psychiatrist, now an independent adviser to the health ombudsman, reported that Whiting had \"drawn a veil perhaps as a defence mechanism\" around his crime. Dr Farrington had not penetrated this \"psychological barrier\", making it difficult to assess whether Whiting would offend again.\n\nParagraph 13 of Dr Farrington's report was crucial. Whiting's counsel, Philip Marshall, told the court that Dr Farrington concluded Whiting \"did not have paedophile tendencies\".\n\nMr Marshall went on to say there were only \"one or two minor details\" in which Whiting's version of events differed from the girl's. She claimed he had licked her, which he denied. Whiting also denied producing the rope.\n\nThe barrister went on to say his client was \"profoundly anxious\" to receive treatment while in jail and asked the judge to regard him \"not as a defendant who necessarily is going to pose a risk to society afterwards\".\n\nJudge John Gower, then in his last year as a full-time judge, said there was no doubt Whiting had terrified the girl for his own \"selfish sexual pleasure\".\n\nBut he sentenced him on the basis that \"it just happened that you had the knife and ropes in the car and that this offence was not premeditated\".\n\nExperts in paedophilia have expressed concern at Dr Farrington's apparent conclusion and the attitude of Judge Gower.\n\nWhile it is correct in medical terms that a man who had abducted and indecently assaulted a child is not necessarily a paedophile, several experts who have examined the transcripts of the 1995 case believe Whiting's behaviour did strongly suggest that he did have such tendencies.\n\nOne of Britain's leading experts on paedophilia, Ray Wyre, said the fact that Whiting had a knife and rope and was confident enough to try to abduct three girls and to drop the girl he kidnapped back near her home suggested he was a paedophile. Mr Wyre also said Whiting appeared so confident in 1995 that he would not be surprised if he had attacked a child before, though police say there is no evidence to support this view.\n\nDr Farrington now says he has \"only the vaguest recollections of Roy Whiting\". He told the Guardian he would be \"curious\" to see if his assessment was \"in any way predictive of the future\". But after seeing part of the transcript of the 1995 hearing he declined to comment.\n\nJudge Gower, now retired, also refused to discuss the case, saying: \"I feel that it would not be right for me to discuss in a public forum a case with which I dealt as a serving judge.\" He said he too had an \"imperfect recollection\" of the case.\n\nRefused treatment\n\nWhile in prison Whiting refused treatment - inmates cannot be forced - and told prisoners he was in for car ringing.\n\nWhen he first became eligible for parole it was denied. As he was caught when he abducted the girl in Crawley because she had lived to tell the tale, it was feared he might kill if he found himself in the same situation again.\n\nBut he was released soon enough and knowing he would be a target if he moved back to Crawley, he asked the probation service to relocate him to Littlehampton, where his mother once lived.\n\nFor four months - until March 1998 - he reported weekly to the probation service. Again he declined any sort of treatment. After that he had no further contact with probation officers.\n\nHe moved into a flat a short walk from the Harbour Park amusement park, a children's playground, and the shingle beach, where he lived alone. Whiting became a familiar scruffy figure, dining most days in the same fish and chip restaurant.\n\nHe retrained as a builder and got regular work. While working on a house near the home of Sarah's grandparents, he probably got to know the cornfield where she was playing.\n\nWhiting had been placed on the sex offenders' register - he was in his last couple of months of imprisonment when the Sex Offenders Act 1997 came into force - and was known to local police and visited regularly.\n\nThere is no direct evidence that Whiting began hunting for children but the alibi he gave for his movements on the day of Sarah's murder may be telling. He claimed he sat in two parks and went to a fair. Detectives believe he came up with these locations because they were the places he did often visit.\n\nTwo and a half years after leaving prison, despite the conclusions of Dr Farrington and Judge Gower, Whiting was again to be found near where children were playing, apparently waiting for his chance to pounce."
