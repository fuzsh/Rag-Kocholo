        "text": "Sarah Kennedy is living two lives. Currently you can see her on stage at the Players' Ring performing as Maggie Leland in the premier of \"Roadside America\" a new play by playwright (and Seacoast Media Group reporter) Susan Morse.\n\nActing is a passion.\n\nBy day Kennedy is down in Beverly, Mass., performing as director of education for a family planning organization.\n\nSexuality education is a passion.\n\nKennedy, 28, of Epping, initially went to Vassar College as a drama major; graduated with a Bachelor of Arts — same denotation. But she knew, love acting as she may, it wasn't going to be a full-time career.\n\n\"I think I fantasized about going professional till about halfway through. About then, maybe junior year, I thought — this is really a hard life! I need stability and I need health insurance,\" she says, no humor to her tone. \"What got to me? I think probably some of the level of the competitiveness amongst people and hearing stories about how hard it is out there. I started to realize this wasn't going to be easy.\"\n\nBut, Kennedy notes, her degree was liberal arts, not fine artist. So she continued studying drama. \"I knew that I wanted to continue to study it. I don't think the undergrad (degree) is about what your profession is going to be. ...; The degree is still valuable.\"\n\nShe recognized a strong interest in reproductive health as gradually as she'd realized acting wasn't her career path.\n\n\"I think that I knew gradually I was interested in reproductive health and sexuality education through campus, student activities I was involved with. And I think I just decided, for a job out of college, I wanted to try working in a women's clinic whether family planning, counseling or education.\"\n\nKennedy did an internship with a family planning organization her junior year. She found she liked everything about it, the work and environment. The career direction was looking good.\n\nIn her senior year she married her two interests. For her thesis Kennedy interviewed women with different reproductive life experiences. \"I then condensed seven (interviews) into monologues and made it into a one-woman show.\"\n\nKennedy performed a while after completing her B.A. She first worked with the Music and Drama Company. But eventually most of her energy went into the second passion, pursuing a career in sexuality education, where she eventually worked her way into management.\n\nTheater became a bit spotty for a while. The reason wasn't so much the day job. It was a return to college full time, while working that full-time position. Kennedy attended the University of New Hampshire for two years, where she earned her master's in public health, —¦ I want my career to be tied to reproductive health/women's health/sexuality education, and an MPH is great degree to have no matter what facet of this field you are working in.\"\n\nSince graduating Kennedy's returned to her second passion.\n\nMuch of her work has been done at the Players' Ring. In 2004 she performed in the Ring's annual Shakespeare production. She's done the company's \"Christmas Carol\" twice now; one pre, one post UNH. She also appeared in \"Lexington Green,\" \"Henry 5.0\" and a number of Players' Ring Late Night productions.\n\n\"Roadside America\" offers Kennedy her first lead. But it's not the position, but the character that has her charged. \"Maggie ...; is complex and interesting, a real woman. She's had life experience. She needs to grieve and, she hasn't really allowed herself to do that,\" says Kennedy.\n\nThe script lets her story unfold over the course of the play, lets her grow, deepen she says. \"She's very layered ...; a grown woman, that's had to deal with a lot.\"\n\n\"I would say that (performing) is the — an — activity I'm most passionate about. ...; I do see it more than a hobby, maybe vocation is a good word. I really do love it,\" says Kennedy. \"But a fiery passion? I'm content with working on really great shows and really great roles. I am very passionate about it, but I do have other passions too — which is a good thing.\"\n\nKennedy says her theater experience enhances her performance at the other job. It requires her to be in front of people often, conducting workshops and speaking before groups. \"And it helps knowing how to react in the moment; (sexuality education) is definitely a charged subject.\"\n\nThe job is about working with people and communicating, she adds, for which theater is a perfect training ground.\n\nThe future? More of the same. After getting married this August, Kennedy hopes to be back doing two to three shows a year, driving from Beverly to Epping, from Epping to Portsmouth, back to Epping and another round — which of course includes a lack of sleep. That's what passion can do to a person.\n\n\"I always see myself involved with theater in this way.\"\n\nWHAT: \"Roadside America\" WHEN: through June 1, Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m. WHERE: The Players' Ring, 105 Marcy St., Portsmouth COST: $12 general admission; $10 for members, $10 students and seniors; $8 student and senior members CONTACT: 436-8123, www.playersring.org\n\nGo & Do"
