Sometime around 1855-1857, she moved with her family 130 miles to Lamar County (Texas) where her father built a home near “Bushy Creek and Sulphur River“.[1]\n\nOn July 19, 1866, Sarah J. Kennedy married Joseph Owens in Lamar County, Texas.[2] On September 1, 1861, the 20 year-old Joseph Owens had been enlisted for 12 months by Captain M. A. Dillard as a private in Company K of the 9th Texas Infantry Regiment in Lamar County and was wounded in the Second Battle of Murfreesboro (fought on December 31-January 2, 1863). Two of the brothers of Sarah Jane Kennedy (William M. Kennedy & Jim Newton Kennedy) had both enlisted in the same company as would her brother-in-law Madison Shepard. The company had originally been organized as Maxey’s Lamar Rifles (commanded by Captain Samuel Bell Maxey), a “Light Infantry & Riflemen” Texas militia company in Paris (Lamar County) on May 25, 1861.[3]\n\nLikely in Lamar County (Texas), Joseph Owens died soon after the birth of his daughter (Sarah “Sallie” E. Owens). His widow, Sarah Jane Owens was reported to have “married Bethel Baker and raised their family in Coleman, Texas“. They were reported to “had four children — Iva, Pearl, Burnice, and one boy who died as an infant“.[4] However, this appears to be a mistake as her daughter (Sarah E. Owens) is reported to have married William Bethel Baker in Coleman County (Texas) in 1892 and had four children (Bernice, Owen, Pearl, & Iva).\n\nResearchers believe Alonzo P. Ditto may have been listed as “A. Pleseant” in the 1870 Federal Census. Born in Texas, the 23 year-old “A. Pleseant” was a farm laborer living with the 59 year-old Rebecca Armontrout (born in Virginia) in household #208 in Beat #3 (Paris Post Office) in Lamar County, Texas.\n\nOn October 24, 1870, S. J. Owens married L. P. Ditto in Hopkins County, Texas.[5] L. (Alonzo) P. Ditto had settled 160 acres on Mulberry Creek (about 20 miles southeast of Paris). According to the survey (dated January 6, 1874), the 160 acres in Lamar County bordered the land of his brother-in-law M. Shepards (married to Sarah’s sister Lucinda Elizabeth Kennedy) and the land of his brother-in-law P. M. Kennedy (see below).\n\nMulberry Creek is intermittent (dry without rain) that originates southeast of present day Reno and north of Cox Airport and runs southeast, then south, for thirteen miles to its mouth on Little Sandy Creek (southeast of Clardy).\n\nAccording to the 1880 Federal Census, the 32 year-old Laron Diton was a farmer living in household #469 in in Precinct #7 of Lamar County, Texas. Born in Texas, Laron Diton was living with his 32 year-old wife Sarrah Diton, his 6 year-old son William Diton, his 4 year-old daughter Beckey Diton, his 12 year-old stepdaughter Sarrah Owns, and a 26 year-old hired-hand James Fubs (all born in Texas). Sarrah Diton was sick with “new Nalya” (?).\n\nLiving close by in household #458 was the brother of Sarah Jane Ditto, the 24 year-old George Canaday. Born in Texas, George Canaday was a farmer living with his 18 year-old wife Mary Canaday, and his 6 month old son Benjamin Canaday (both born in Texas);\n\nLiving in the next household (#459) was the widowed mother of Sarah Jane Ditto, the 66 year-old Sallie Canaday. Born in Kentucky, Sallie Canaday lived alone and both her parents were born in Virginia;\n\nLiving in the next household (#460) was the brother of Sarah Jane Ditto, the 41 year-old James Canaday. Born in Kentucky, James Canaday was a farmer living with his 21 year-old wife Eliza Canady, his 4 year-old son William Canaday, and an unnamed 4 month-old infant Canaday (all born in Texas);\n\nLiving close by in household #462 was the brother of Sarah Jane Ditto, the 25 year-old Benjamin Canedy. Born in Kentucky, Benjamin Canedy was a farmer living with his 31 year0old wife Nancy Canedy (daughter of Eliza A. Wilcox), and his 9 year-old nephew Thomas Wilcox (both born in Texas).\n\nSometime prior to the birth of their daughter Eldora “Dora” Ditto, Alonzo “Lons” Ditto and his wife Sarah Jane Ditto moved their family from Lamar County over 380 miles west to Tom Green County, Texas. While living in Tom Green County, their daughter Lilly Ditto (unknown), daughter Eldora “Dora” Ditto (March 29, 1881), and son Benjamin Jesse Ditto (July 5, 1883) were born. Their daughter Levona “Vonie” Ditto was reportedly born in Coleman County on September 30, 1885.[6] Owning only a $20 wagon along with some tools and five mules/horses, L. P. Ditto was still listed as a resident of Coleman County in 1886.[7] On December 4, 1890, their daughter Lillie Ditto died and was buried in Grape Creek Cemetery in Tom Green County, Texas.[8]\n\nOn February 21, 1892, the daughter of Sarah Jane Ditto (Sarah “Sallie” Owens) is reported to have married William Bethel Baker in Coleman County, Texas. According to her certificate of death, Salle E. Baker was born in McCulloch County (Texas) on January 12, 1868. Like her mother, Sallie E. Baker died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 84.[9] Sallie Baker is buried next to her husband Bethel Baker in Mt. View Cemetery in northwestern Coleman County, Texas.\n\nOn December 21, 1897, the daughter of Alonzo P. Ditto (Beckie Ditto) married Jacob Ringer in Tom Greene County, Texas.[10]\n\nOn May 5, 1898, the son of Alonzo P. Ditto (Wesley Ditto) married Loretta Hooten in Tom Greene County, Texas.[11] The 47 year-old Wesley W. Ditto (born February 23, 1873) is buried in Brownfield Cemetery (died November 7, 1920) in Terry County, Texas (findagrave.com).\n\nAccording to the 1900 Federal Census, the 53 year-old Lonzo P. Ditto was a farmer living in Scurry County, Texas. Born in Texas, Lonzon P. Ditto was living with his 53 year-old wife Sarah J. Ditto, his 17 year-old daughter Udora Ditto, his 16 year-old son Benjamin J. Ditto (farm Laborer), and his 14 year-old daughter Lavona Ditto (all born in Texas).\n\nOn September 23, 1900, the daughter of Alonzo P. Ditto (Dora Ditto) married C. C. Carpenter in Scurry County, Texas.[12]\n\nOn November 13, 1901, the son of Alonzo P. Ditto (Benjamin Jesse Ditto) was reported to have married Ottie Bell Fairley in Sharon, Texas.\n\nOn June 11, 1903, the daughter of Alonzo P. Ditto (Lavona “Vona” Ditto) is reported to have married Arthur Lee Grant in Scurry County, Texas.\n\nAccording to the 1910 Federal Census, the 63 year-old L. P. Ditto owned his own farm (household #512) in the town of Snyder in Scurry County, Texas. Born in Texas, L. P. Ditto was a farmer living with his 62 year-old wife Sarah Ditto (born in Texas). Both the parents of Sarah Ditto had been born in Kentucky and the mother of L. P. Ditto was born in Virginia. However, the father of L. P. Ditto was listed as “United States“. The couple reported six of their nine children were still alive when the census was taken.\n\nLiving in the preceding household (#511) was the daughter of Alonzo P. Ditto, the 34 year-old Beckie Ringer. Born in Texas, Beckie Ringer was living with her 36 year-old husband Jake Ringer (self-employed laborer), her 10 year-old son Weslie Ringer, her 7 year-old son Bernice Ringer, her 4 year-old daughter Thelma Ringer, and her two year-old son J. D. Ringer (all born in Texas);\n\nLiving in the next household (#513) was the daughter of Alonzo P. Ditto, the 23 year-old Vona Grant. Born in Texas, Vona Grant was living with her 28 year-old husband A. L. Grant (farmer), her 5 year-old son Alfred Grant, her 3 year-old daughter Thelma Grant, and her two year-old daughter Velma Grant (all born in Texas).\n\nAccording to the 1920 Federal Census, the 72 year-old L. P. Ditto was living at the home of his daughter in the town of Snyder in Scurry County, Texas. Born in Texas, L. P. Ditto was living with his 72 year-old wife S. J. Ditto, his 38 year-old daughter Dora Giles, her 46 year-old husband James C. Giles (Chiropractor Doctor), their 14 year-old granddaughter Mannie Carpenter, and their 12 year-old granddaughter Janebur (?) Carpenter. Both of the parents of L. P. Ditto were listed as born in Virginia and both the parents of his wife were born in Kentucky.\n\nOn December 25, 1823, the 76 year-old L. P. Ditto died at 2:00 A. M. at the home of his daughter Dora Giles in Hamlin, Texas. For “the past six years”, he had suffered from paralysis and had recently fallen about 10 days prior to his death. He and was survived by his wife and four children (Mrs. Giles of Hamlin; Mrs. Rainer of Sterling City; Ben Ditto of Lubbock; & Miss Sallie Baker of Coleman). L. P. Ditto was buried in North Cemetery (see below).\n\nAccording to the 1930 Federal Census, the 83 year-old Jane Ditto was living on Coleman and Abilene Road in the home of her daughter in Coleman County, Texas. Born in Texas, Jane Ditto was a widow living with her 63 year-old widowed daughter Sallie E. Baker (born in Texas).\n\nOn July 16, 1931, Mrs. Sarah J. Ditto filed for an application for a Widow’s Confederate Pension in Sterling County, Texas. The application was made due to the service of her first husband, Joe Owens, in “Captain Dillard’s Company” during the Civil War. She had married Joe Owens in July of 1866 and remained married to him until his death in the “latter part of February 1868” in Lamar County, Texas. The Texas State Comptroller rejected the application because she had not been married to Joe Owens for “a period of 10 years immediately preceding his death“.[13]\n\nOn September 12, 1931, the 84 year-old Sarah Jane Ditto died of a cerebral hemorrhage in the city of Sterling in Sterling County, Texas.

DeWeese) were both born in Butler County, Kentucky (see below).\n\nGravestones:\n\nIt is not known where Joseph Owens is buried. L. P. Ditto is buried in North Cemetery (about 2 miles north of Hamlin) in rural Jones County, Texas. Sarah Jane Ditto is buried in Montvale Cemetery in Sterling County, Texas.
