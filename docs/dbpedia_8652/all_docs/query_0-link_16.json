        "text": "Sam is lucky to have grown up surrounded by role models at Kieve; he is the 4th generation in his family to have led KWE. Camp has played a huge part in Sam’s life since his kiddie camper days in the early ’90s. He was a camper from Junior Kieve through Maine Trails and Kieve West before working on the summer camp staff from 2005-08. He graduated from Colby College in 2009 and lived in Chicago until returning to KWE in 2018 after earning a master’s in education at Harvard University.\n\nSam lives on the Kieve campus in Nobleboro with his wife, Sarah, and their children, Stella and Marty.\n\nSam, is 3rd generation Kiever, was a camper from 1998 through 2001, then again in 2003 for Maine Trails and 2004 for Kieve West. He returned as a counselor in 2006, became an assistant tripping director in 2009, and took the lead on JK in 2011. Sam is a 2009 graduate of Bates College and earned his master’s in teaching from Loyola University in 2016.\n\nSam and his wife, Kate, moved to KWE full time just before their daughter, Natalie, was born in June 2020.

He is very excited to have his family–Meredith, Owen, Walker, Briggs, and Slim–at camp this summer.\n\nSarah is a board certified family nurse practitioner and worked as a primary care provider before joining KWE in March 2021. She graduated from Trinity College in 2009 and received her master’s in nursing from Columbia University in 2016. She lives at Camp Kieve year-round with her husband, Sammy Kennedy, and their children, Stella and Marty. Sarah oversees the infirmaries at Kieve and Wavus and implements healthcare policies for summer camp and all year-round programs. Sarah also maintains KWE’s culture of healthy risk-taking by providing oversight and guidance for all programs, working to improve safety while empowering all of us to take on healthy risk.\n\nOriginally from Northern California, Kate spent summers in Maine with her family at their camp in Harpswell. After going to college in Washington state, where she acquired both a love of the outdoors and a husband (Erik), she moved back to Northern California where she ran a monthly wine club at a vineyard in Napa Valley, got her master’s in literature, and had a daughter, Dylan, and son, Izaak. Kate and Erik moved the family to Maine in 2005. They live in Phippsburg, with easy access to hiking trails and Popham Beach.\n\nMarge joined the KWE team in 2014 and serves as our retreats & events director in addition to being a summer camp admin assistant. Born and raised in Jefferson, she grew up swimming, fishing, and enjoying all that Damariscotta Lake has to offer. Marge generously shares this magical place with young outdoors women each summer and many other remarkable groups throughout the year.
