I’ve been featured in The Advocate, Go Mag, Reductress, Pyragraph, among others!\n\nCheck out samples of my writing here\n\nI PERFORM!\n\nWith an over ten year comedy career under my belt, I’m more than just a joke teller! I host events, run trivia nights, act, facilitate meetings, and any other opportunity to get up in front of crowds.\n\nCheck out a recent stand up comedy set here\n\nI PRODUCE!\n\nAbove all else, I love to create experiences for other people and I have the skill toolbox to prove it. I can run live shows, develop online events, send out newsletters, make movies, take photos, run A/V, DJ, and on and on and on. I love bringing ideas to life!\n\nCheck out a short film I co-created here\n\nSarah Kennedy wants to help you escape—and she said as much in an interview with The Atlantic—whether it’s through live stand-up comedy, through humor writing, or through countless events online.\n\nShe’s been featured on The Today Show, MTV and SiriusXM, performed in multiple comedy festivals across the country, and was also a finalist in NBC’s Stand-Up For Diversity nationwide comedy contest. She’s published pieces in The Advocate, Reductress, and GO Magazine, among others, and most recently, her original scripts have been performed on the Spec Script Podcast.\n\nShe co-wrote/co-directed/co-starred in the award-winning short film, The Fabulous (Name TBD)s, and lately, she’s been doing a lot of Zoom comedy shows.\n\nSarah’s always looking for a way to cheer people up and keep them laughing.\n\nPhoto by Jenni Walkowiak"
