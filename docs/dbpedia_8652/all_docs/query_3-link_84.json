Her work on Climate Connections includes developing story ideas, conducting interviews, and writing and editing scripts.\n\nAfter graduating magna cum laude from Harvard University in 2001, Sarah worked for seven years as managing editor of Wordsmyth, a company developing language-learning resources for K-12 education and ESL learners. There, she managed projects for clients including McGraw Hill, Scholastic, and Leapfrog.\n\nIn 2012, Sarah left Wordsmyth to pursue her own writing more intensively. She earned a master’s of fine arts degree in nonfiction from Rutgers University, Camden, where she subsequently taught undergraduate composition and creative writing courses.\n\nSarah’s research and narrative-driven essays and articles have been published in Post Road, Chautauqua Literary Journal, Under the Sun, Hidden City Philadelphia, Fodor’s Oregon, and elsewhere. In her work with Climate Connections, she hopes to help people make new connections between global warming and its impacts on people’s lives."
