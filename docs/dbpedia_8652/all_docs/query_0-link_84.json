        "text": "The (brand new) Celtic Travellers DNA project is primarily for individuals looking for help in identifying the origins of their own direct paternal or maternal line of descent.\n\nThe project is primarily for the members and descendants of Irish Travellers, Highland Scottish Travellers, Lowland Scottish Travellers, Fairground Travellers and other Non-Romani travelling families. However if you are Roma or mixed Traveller race you are welcome to join.\n\nYou may suspect that you have Celtic Traveller ancestry in your family and not yet have a suitable surname project to join due to many reasons which could include distant surname changes, forced adoptions and forced resettlement.\n\nScottish and Irish nomads (Celtic Travellers) are more commonly and disrespectfully referred to as Tinkers, Pikeys and Gypos. We are probably distantly related the sedentary Celtic folk, but have split from the general population way back in time with our own proud cultures, languages and unique genetic history still waiting to be told.\n\nThis is a copy of the latest Traveller – Tinker – Gypsy Surname Index of Great Britain Updated 8/03/2010\n\nABBOTT 1881 (Ref Journal of the Romany and Traveller Family History Society) (Berkshire)\n\nABEL (Ref Journal of the Romany and Traveller Family History Society)\n\nABERCROMBIE 1676 Scotland.
