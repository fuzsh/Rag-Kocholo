        "text": "Sarah Jane Kennedy, aged 87, peacefully passed away in the early morning of Tuesday, September 12, 2023. As she left this earthly realm, we know she joyfully ran into the loving arms of Jesus.\n\nSarah Jane was born on April 27, 1936 to Sidney and Kate Smith in Carriere, MS, as the youngest of five cherished siblings, with her sister and closest confidante, Tommie McClendon, standing as the matriarch of the Smith family today.\n\nShe caught the eye of her late husband Floyd Kennedy, fittingly at a gospel music singing, at the age of 17 and their love only grew from that day forward. Together, they shared over 50 years of profound love, companionship, and countless adventures. Following his passing, her heart was forever marked by his absence.\n\nSarah loved her family with an incomparable devotion - her son, Sid Kennedy, and daughter-in-love, Darlene; her daughter, Tammy Wilson, and son-in-love, Greg; and her beloved baby girl, Michelle Kennedy. Her adoration extended to her two granddaughters and their husbands, Jordan and Steve Guevara and Remi and Sean Sykes, who brought immense joy to her life, as well as her four great-grandchildren - Cecilia Guevara, Paisleigh Montgomery, Kree, and Kightley Sykes.\n\nYet, Sarah's love knew no bounds; she considered anyone who entered her home as an honorary Kennedy, ready to embrace them as part of her cherished family. If there was a baby to hold or a song to sing, Sarah was there.\n\nHer faith in God was her cornerstone - Jesus truly was her best friend. She found fulfillment in serving her community and sharing God's love. Her prayers were ceaseless, and she held firm in her belief that God heard every word. Her kindness, generosity, and radiant smile had the power to illuminate any room she entered.\n\nCooking was another one of Sarah's expressions of love, and her culinary creations were legendary. From her famous fried chicken and rice with gravy to her skillet corn, her dishes were savored far and wide. Nothing, however, could surpass her delectable chocolate pie with its perfectly peaked meringue; it was a testament to her love and skill in the kitchen and a masterpiece no one can quite recreate.\n\nSarah is now reunited in Glory with her husband, Floyd, and her beloved son, Sid. She joins her parents, Sidney and Kate, and her siblings, Sid Smith, Guy Smith and Greta Dearman.\n\nWhile her family mourns the loss of an extraordinary mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend, taken from us too soon by the grip of dementia, we rejoice that her unwavering faith has transformed into sight in the presence of her Maker. Her memory is revered and cherished by countless others who were touched by her precious life.\n\nThe family wishes to express heartfelt gratitude to the dedicated staff at the Pearl River County Nursing Home and Forrest General Hospice for their compassionate care during her final years.\n\nWhile she didnâ€™t outlive us all as we suspected, Sarah Kennedy left an indelible mark on all who had the privilege of knowing her. Her legacy of love, faith, and kindness will endure in the hearts of those she touched, and her spirit is finally at rest, reunited with her loved ones in the loving embrace of our Heavenly Father.\n\nA Graveside Service will be held at Rose Memorial Park Cemetery, 1300 Pecan Street, Hammond, Louisiana 70401 on Friday, September 15, 2023 at 1:00 pm."
