        "text": "Wyberlye Convalescent Home.(xi) In 1931, the Grand Order of Sons of Jacob opened a convalescent home for women in Burgess Hill. In 1935/6 larger premises were acquired nearby at Wyberlye, Leylands Road. These premises were consecrated by the Chief Rabbi in the presence of 800 guests. The new Home was able to accommodate 500 patients a year.\n\nIn 1939 an additional wing was built to accommodate 50 refugee girls who had come to Britain on the kindertransport. During the early part of World War II, it acted as a religious and social centre for Jewish residents in Burgess Hill and district, and was used on Sundays for \"the provision of Kasher meat for the local residents, Hebrew education for children and social activities for the younger generation and the local community generally.\" However, by 1941 the property was requisitioned by the army.\n\nIn 2019, an information board was placed at Marle Place Park, the former location of the Wyberlye Home. The board details the history of the Home. It was donated by Lesley Urbach, whose mother was amongst the kindertransport girls who found refuge there."
