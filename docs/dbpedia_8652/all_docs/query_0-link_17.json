        "text": "BERTIE LEONARD JOHN MUGRIDGE 04/06/1926-05/12/2001\n\nBorn in Hastings, East Sussex and known as Bert.\n\nAs a child, Bert moved many times with his parents and siblings from rental home to rental home. It was quite probably avoid the rent man. Some of the places I know were St Thomas's Road, 33 and 136 Braybrooke Road.\n\nIt was said that Bert was always in trouble when he was younger. I took this with a pinch of salt until I found the 1939 Register entry for him..\n\nIn 1939 Bert was in Hertfordshire at the Danesbury Approved School, Hertford.\n\nBert joined the army as part of his national service. It kept him out of trouble.\n\nMarried Jean Shaw (b 1926 in Hastings) on 03/08/1949.\n\nTheir children:\n\nChristopher Andrew 4/12/1950 Graham Rex 20/2/1955\n\nBert was very softly spoken, with a deep voice. It was quite difficult at times to hear what he said.\n\nBert worked for BEA and lived for many years in Weybridge, Surrey.\n\nBert and Jean moved out to Spain, near Alicante to enjoy his retirement. They spent several years there before their new batch of grandchildren called them back home.\n\nBert and Jean moved back to England, to Shropshire to be near their grandchildren.\n\nBert died in Telford, Shropshire 05/12/2001 of lung cancer. He had also been suffering from emphysema for many years. Bert was cremated at Telford crematorium on Wednesday 12th December.\n\nJean developed demensia and ended her days in a care home. She died there on 27/05/2015. Jean was cremated at Telford crematorium on Friday June 12th.\n\nELIZABETH ANN MUGRIDGE 06/02/1930-24/04/2008\n\nMy mum kept all sorts of bits of paper from her past for which I am extremely grateful. It's a shame I never knew about them until after her death as I would liked to have quizzed her on some of them.\n\nBorn in Wick near Littlehampton.\n\nChristened on 08/05/1930 at All Saint's Church, Wick.\n\nKnown as Betty.\n\nMoved to Hastings when she was fairly young and grew up as a tomboy. She did not like her younger brother Tony too much and was always fighting with him. I believe it was probably due to a bit of jealousy as she was no longer the baby of the family and Tony was spoilt. Despite her dislike of Tony, she lost her top two front teeth in a fight, when she was 11, defending him from a group of bullies. During her time in Hastings, Betty lived at many different addresses and some of the moves happened at night which led her to believe the family were doing a 'moonlight flit' to avoid the rent man. Some of the addresses the family lived at were St Thomas's Road, 33 Braybrooke Road and 136 Braybrooke Road.\n\nThe primary school Betty attended was Mount Pleasant school. For a short history of the school expansion, click here.\n\nBetty obviously attended Sunday school regularly as she kept a scripture examination certificate that she was awarded in 1940. This certificate was awarded with honours and came form St Luke's Presbyterian School.\n\nAs a child, Betty moved many times with her parents and siblings from rental home to rental home. It was quite probably avoid the rent man. Some of the places I know were St Thomas's Road, 33 and 136 Braybrooke Road.\n\nIn 1939 Betty was living at 33 Sedlescombe Road North with her parents and siblings Bunty and Tony.\n\nThe family also spent some time in Hendon at 3 Dehar Crescent. I believe this was during the war, which would explain why Betty and her brother were evacuated.\n\nDuring the war Betty was evacuated, with her younger brother Tony, to Bedford. Each time I asked her about her experiences she would just say it was not nice and clam up. She told me, in later years, that she had regularly been touched inappropriately by the man of the house. It is a shame she didn't tell her mother that when she came up to fetch Tony after it was discovered he had been ill treated. It was while she was evacuated that Betty went off sugar in her drinks. The parents used Betty's sugar rations and she had to have jam in her tea if she wanted it sweet. She told me this tasted so revolting, that she just stopped having anything sweet.\n\nBetty was confirmed at St Paul's Church in Bedford in 1944, so obviously during her evacuation and she took her first communion at St Mary's Church in Bedford.\n\nI don't know the name of the school Betty went to in Bedford but I do know she attended Tower Road School in St Leonards on Sea, Sussex. The school buildings were built in a huge dip, the walls around the playground were about 30' high (or that's what they appeared to be when I was younger) and there was a ramp leading down into the playground. I have just found a piece about the opening of the school here. This school was later renamed as Woodlands Secondary School for girls (where I attended) and years later it became Christchurch Junior School. The majority of the old building was knocked down but the new buildings still occupy the old playground. Betty's great grandson went to school here. Betty passed exams there in 1944, aged 14, in French, hand writing and English (with distinction). These were all elementary certificates.\n\nAfter the war the family returned to Hastings where they bought a house at 14 Brook Street\n\nBetty was always an athletic person who enjoyed sports and took part in the activities in Hastings Youth Week, held in June, in 1948. On June 10th she came 3rd in the girl's 17-19 year old girls 150 yard race and also 3rd in the girls 100 yard race.\n\nStraight after leaving school, she went to work at Pelham's Chemist in the High Street, Old Town in Hastings. The shop is still there, complete with the tiled name under the shop window, only today it is a florists shop.\n\nShe became godmother to Julia Pelham, (the daughter of the chemist's owner) at St Clements Church, Hastings on 14/08/1949 .\n\nBetty decided to be different to the rest of her siblings and wanted to join the RAF rather than the Army. She enrolled as a member of the Women's Junior Air Corps on 18/02/1946, 12 days after her 16th birthday. She belonged to Unit 208 in Hastings and meetings took place on Monday nights from 19-00 to 21-30 hours at 4 Carlisle Parade. Betty was promoted to Lance Corporal on 18/2/1948, 2 years after her enrollment; Corporal on 21/06/1948, Sergeant on 01/05/1950 and a unit Sergeant on 06/11/1950. While a cadet Betty had 4 flights in a Fairchild Argos, which she told me she thoroughly enjoyed. On 21/04/1948 she gained her 1st Ability badge and on 03/11/1948 she gained her Air Ability badge. Betty left the WJAC on 07/05/1951, after 5 years.\n\nOn 18/05/1951, Betty signed up for 4 years service in the WRAF. Her serial number was 2816958 and she joined as an A.C.W/2.\n\nNot long after she enlisted, betty attended a big service in St Paul's Cathedral which was attended by the King and Queen and General Dwight D. Eisenhower. This service took place on July 4th, 1951 and it was a Service of Commemoration of 28,000 American dead in war time comradeship with the people of Britain and of Dediscation of the Roll of Honour for the American Memorial Chapel. Betty kept the booklet about the ceremony and it appears all her service pals signed it for her. I believe they had all probably recently finished their basic training and were going off to different RAF stations. Betty also managed to get the autographs of Dickie Valentine and Douglas Fairbanks Junior, who were also at the service. She had often talked about these but had never shown me them so I was a bit sceptical. I found them after her death.\n\nBetty spent 2 years in the WRAF working as an airframe mechanic on Vampires and Meteors.\n\nIt was while Betty was doing a course at RAF St Athans in Wales, (where she was stationed), that she met her future husband. She contracted German measles during her course and had to join the next course to finish it, so bumping into her husband to be.\n\nMarried Lawrence Edwin Smithson (b 1931 in Yorkshire) on 29/3/1952 in St Andrews Church, Hastings, Sussex.\n\nTheir children:\n\nLesley Ann 31/5/1954 Jacqueline Theresa 8/2/1957 Kim Rosemary9/4/1959\n\nAfter their wedding, Betty still worked at St Athans until she was posted to Germany and Eddie was posted elsewhere. At that point, Betty left the servcie.\n\nEddie was posted to Singapore and went on ahead. Betty sailed out to Singapore on board the S.S. Lancashire, sailing from Liverpool on 26/02/1954. She had had to sail, rather than fly as she was expecting her first child. Betty had cabin 76, berth D. I have a menu for the night of 25/03/1954 with a note on the bottom saying \"All clocks will be advanced 30 minutes at midnight tonight. Obviously the beginning of BST but why half an hour instead of an hour?\n\nThe first place they lived in Singapore was 103 Lorong J Telok Karau Road in Katong. This was a shared house where they had one room to themselves while sharing a kitchen and bathroom. They later moved into a married quarter at 17 Mornington Crescent, RAF Seletar. They had an armour there to help with the work who also helped look after their daughter, Lesley.\n\nAfter Eddie's tour of duty came to an end, Betty and Lesley returned home to England on 21/02/1956. They lived at 34B Springfiled Road, St Leonards on Sea, Sussex. Eddie was sent on a training course for a different aircaft type and ended up serving in Malta for several months on his own. Whenever he was training or off on an unaccompanied posting, Betty and the girls always headed back to St Leonards on Sea where Betty's family still lived.\n\nEddie was then posted to RAF Watton, near Norwich in Norfolk. The family they lived at 34 Walploe Street, Norwich until they got a married quarter on the camp.\n\nAfter the birth of their second daughter, Betty and Eddie moved into a 2 bedroomed married quarter at 15 Farnborough Road, at RAF Watton.\n\nWhen daughter number 3 came along, the family moved into a larger 3 bedroomed married quarter at 25 Boscombe Road\n\nFrom Watton, Eddie was posted to RAF Bruggen in Germany in 1961. As usual, he went ahead of the family and lived there for several months on his own while waiting for accomodation. During this time Betty and the girls lived with her mother at 190 Bohemia Road, St Leonards on Sea, Sussex.\n\nAccomodation in a block of flats in Eindhoven, Holland became available and Betty and the girls moved in there. I remember when we flew out to Germany form gatwick airport, we spent the night in the Union Jack Club by Waterloo station in London. My grandmother stayed the night as well. We all travelled up by rail from Hastings to Charing Cross Station. They were only there for 3 or 4 months before they moved to a maisonette at 38K Webshall Strausee, Moenchengladbach in Germnay. This was an RAF off camp accomodation and the family lived there for the rest of the 3 year posting.\n\nEddie was sent off for more training on his return to England and once more Betty and the girls went down to St Leonards on Sea to live until a married quarter was available. They left Germany from RAF Wilderath on 2/10/1964.\n\nOnce a married quarter became available, Betty and the girls moved again; this time to 7 Valetta Road, RAF Dishforth, North Yorkshire. This was not far from Ripon.\n\nThe next move was a fairly short one from one part of Yorkshire to another. The family lived at 185 AMQ, RAF Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1967 the family moved into 126 Pine Square, RAF Wattisham, Suffolk. This camp was near Ipswich.\n\nBetty and the girls left RAF Wattisham in July 1970 and went to live temporarily with Betty's mother at 190 Bohemia Road. They then moved into a rented 3 bedroomed semi-detached house at 40 Shirley Drive, St Leonards on Sea. The monthly rent on the house was £36 and 8 shillings.\n\nThe family lived there for 7 months and Betty got a job working in Theakers, a chemist chain, in Battle Road, just a short walk from the house.\n\nAfter 7 months, the family moved again, this time to 16 St Margarets Raod, St Leonards. This was a large victorian style terraced house that was arranged over 5 floors. The caretaker lived on the bottom 2 levels and Betty and the girls lived on the top 3. You could see the sea from the top 2 stories at the back of the house and it was only about a 7 minute walk to the pier and the beach.\n\nBetty still worked for Theakers but was able to change shops and went to work in the town centre branch. After a falling out amongst the staff, Betty and one other employee went to work for another Chemist. This time it was a small time chemists named Cathaways, along Bohemia Road.\n\nThe family stayed in that house until 1973 when Eddie was posted to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Lesley had left home, Jacqui went to live with her grandmother and finish school while Betty and Kim moved in with Eddie at 99 Abbey Road, Witney, Oxon. This was a married quarter and much nicer than the ones at Carterton. Eddie took over the quarter on 29/03/1973 at 09-00 hours, his and Betty's 21st wedding anniversary.\n\nWhile living in Witney, Betty went to work at the local Waitrose supermarket. She was trained to operate a chechkout till but very soon moved onto serving on the delicatessen counter. She really enjoyed this job and stayed there until she moved back down to Hastings again.\n\nEddie decided to retire from the RAF and went to work for the Saudi Arabian Air Force in 1975. Betty had taken Kim back to Hastings to live as she had gotten in with a bad crowd, Lesley was still living away and Jacqui went to lodge with the next door neighbours. The house at Witney was handed back to the RAF.\n\nBetty and Kim rented a lovely house at 8 Hamilton Gardens in Hastings and stayed there for several months.\n\nDuring one of Eddie's trips home to England he and Betty bought their first ever home. This was 9 Applewood Close in St Leonards on Sea. Betty lived there for a couple of years before she decided to go out to Saudi to live with her husband. The house was sold to Betty's younger sister, Alison, and her husband.\n\nBetty arrived at Dhahran airport, Saudi Arabia, aboard BA 121 on 13/11/1978 at aproximately 19-00 hours.\n\nDuring Eddie's time in Saudi he and Betty went on holiday to different exotic places, electing to off set their flying allowance (for home visits) on the cost of somewhere war. They visited Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Kenya, Barbados, Mauritius, the Seychelles and several trips to Jersey. They really enjoyed these holidays.\n\nBetty and Eddie lived in Saudi for about 3 years before they returned home to Hastings. They bought another house, 24 Shirley Drive in St Leonards on Sea for the sum of £24,950. This house was not far from the house they had rented back in 1970. Eddie went on a training course to do with helicopter engines. He then got a job at Fleetlands in Gosport, Hampshire so another move was on the cards.\n\nBetty and Eddie moved into 169 Privett Road in Gosport in about 1983. They lived there quite happily for about 9 years and always had one or more grandchildren to stay during the school holidays. It was always Betty who asked if she could have them stay as she loved to take them out places. I really don't know who enjoyed it the most, her or the grandchildren! Both Betty and Eddie joined the RAF Association while they were down in Gosport and attended their meetings and functions.\n\nBetty suffered from breast cancer and had a mastectomy in January 1991. I can't remember if she had the operation in Salisbury hospital or Queen Anne's hospital, Cosham, Hampshire. She made a quick recovery and was looking after 2 of her grandchildren for 10 days, 5 weeks after the op. I remember her telling me how strange it was, how she felt lopsided and how she nearly fell off a chair whhile changing a lightbulb as she was unbalanced!\n\nBetty had reconstruction surgery a year after the operation and that took place at either Salisbury or Cosham. One op was done in one hospital and one in the other.\n\nIn 1992 Eddie was told he had to retire as he was a civil servant and had reached that age so they decided it was time to move again.\n\nBetty and Eddie took their time to look around and decided to move to Ramsey in Huntingdonshire. They lived at 53 Blenheim Drive in Ramsey.\n\nWhile in Ramsey, Betty became a member of the ladies wing of the Royal British Legion and made many friends. She worked as a volunteer in the Legion shop, sold poppies and went up to the Royal Albert Hall each year for the Remembrance service.\n\nBetty and Eddie finally decided to return to Hastings to live in 2000, staying with her daughter Kim and her family in Battle Road, St Leonards on Sea while looking for a house to rent. They also spent several months living with their grandson Jamie (Kim's son) and his girlfriend while changing houses.\n\nBetty and Eddie lived at 28 Pine Avene, Hastings, moved to 8 Berlin Road, Hastings and then finally moved into 40A Queens Road, a flat above Gamleys toy shop. There was a lovely view of part of Hastings Castle from her bedroom window. This flat was very close to homes her parents, grandparents and great grandparents had lived. Of course, she didn't know this at the time they moved in as I hadn't found all the relatives at that time. By a strange coincidence, the flat was rented through an estate agents situated at 109 Queens Road. The flat above this shop was once occupied by Betty's parents and younger sister.\n\nBetty was diagnosed with uterine cancer and in March 2004 she under went a hysterectomy in Brighton hospital. This time she was not so lucky with avoiding radiotherapy treatment and had about 6 treatments. She did not mind those so much, she was more annoyed by the fact that she was limited in what she could do for 6 weeks after her op. She had always been an active person and hated the restrictions put on her.\n\nEddie died of a heart attack on the morning of Monday January 1st 2007, leaving Betty rather shell shocked. He had been ill on and off for years but this came out of the blue. He was cremated at Hastings crematorium on Thursday the 11th January on a wet, miserable day.\n\nBetty began to suffer from awful pains in her hips and also pain in her right knee. The doctor discovered her knee was in need of a bit of repair and this wasd probably contributing to the pain in her hips. So in May 2007 she went into hospital to have it cleaned out. It didn't do the trick, the hip pain was still there.\n\nThe hip pain was discovered later in the year on a visit to her oncologist - the bones were breaking up due to cancer.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2008, Betty was given the news that she had been dreading - the cancer had returned, this time to her stomach and this time it was untreatable. She was given months to live.\n\nIn the second week of January, Betty was admitted to St Michael's Hospice for a 2 week assesment. Because of the swelling in her legs and stomach and the fact she couldn't manage any of the stairs in her flat, it was decided that she should remain at the hospice. She was moved from her ward downstairs, to room 3, a private room on the floor above. The hospice was set in beautiful grounds and Betty had a lovely view of these from her room. The house Rider Haggard wrote 'She' in, was about 200 yards away from her room. The care she got there was fantastic and they put up with her cantankerousness very well.\n\nOn Friday 25/04/2008, Betty passed away in her room. She was cremated at Hastings crematorium on a beautiful, suny warm day on Thursday the 8th May.\n\nANTHONY ROBERT MUGRIDGE 19/4/1933-10/6/2001\n\nBorn in the bathroom of 33 Braybrooke Road, Hastings, Sussex.\n\nKnown as Tony and was spolit by his mother when he was young.\n\nTony was evacuated during the war to Bedford, along with his sister Betty. He was not treated very well by the people he wasliving with and was often locked in the cupboard under the stairs. When his mother found out what was going on she went up to Bedford and took him home. Betty had to stay where she was. This information was from my mother, Betty.\n\nApparently Tony was known to slump forward while sitting at the table during mealtimes. To get him out of this habit, his mother tied him to the chair with a belt so he was sat upright!\n\nTony joined the army and as far as I can remember he was in the R.E.M.E.\n\nMarried Paulette Goddard (known as Paula). I think this was in New Zealand.\n\nTheir children:\n\nKaren 07/04/1961 Robert 17/10/1963\n\nTony and Paula lived a few years in New Zealand.\n\nOn their return to England Tony and Paula, along with their daughter Karen, lived in Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire at some point. Tony Worked for BEA.\n\nTony divorced Paula some time after 1970.\n\nMarried Joyce Creswell in Hastings in Q4 1997.\n\nTony and Joyce lived in Battle.\n\nTony met the same fate as other family members and was diagnosed with cancer in his jaw. He survived a few years, before it finally got to him.
