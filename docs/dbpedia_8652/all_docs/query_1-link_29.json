        "text": "Sarah Kennedy is the kind of performer that brightens the room before the show starts, warms every heart, and keeps listeners spellbound and smirking until the last note has faded. The Montréal-based, Vancouver-born jazz vocalist, and songwriter is known for her light and smooth vocal tone, her depth of emotional expression, and her cunning sense of humour.\n\nAside from a penchant for thrilling her audience, Sarah Kennedy is also a Music Therapist on a mission to enhance mental health with music. Sarah Kennedy’s music is strongly rooted in straight-ahead jazz, but her sound is evolving into an intriguing personal style as she ventures into original composition. She holds a diploma in Jazz and Contemporary Voice, completed with instructors from both Vancouver Community College and Capilano University.\n\nShe has performed in the TD Vancouver International Jazz Festival, The Harmony Arts Festival, The Gibson’s Landing Jazz Festival, and to sold out audiences at Frankie’s Jazz Club. She has been a featured performer in the Atira“ Strong Women, Strong Music” series and was interviewed on CBC’s Hot Air for Ella Fitzgerald’s 100th Birthday commemoration. Yearning to expand her musical and personal horizons, she relocated to Montreal in 2019. During the pandemic of 2020 she completed her Masters in Creative Arts Therapies at Concordia University and became a Certified Music Therapist."
