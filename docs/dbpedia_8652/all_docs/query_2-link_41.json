Kennedy was born in 1811 in Kentucky. His parents are unknown. The earliest record of him is an Indenture document filed in the county court of Adair County, Kentucky, in 1821 in which Hiram was indentured to a John Allen as an apprentice to learn the mastery of farming and to learn to read, write and common arithmetic. He was to be an apprentice until he attained the age of 21. It is believed that Hiram had a brother, Ruben, who was indentured to a Robert Anderson.\n\nIn 1837, Hiram Kennedy owned 50 acres of land on Ill Will Creek in Clinton County (Cumberland County before 1835), Kentucky. About 1840, Hiram and Sarah Kennedy moved to Butler County, Kentucky.\n\nAccording to the 1840 Federal Census, the 20-29 year-old Hiram Kennedy was a farmer living with his family in Butler County, Kentucky. Hiram Kennedy was living with a free white female 20-29 years-old (wife Sarah), two free white males 5 years-old or under (sons Pierson Miller Kennedy & Jim Newton Kennedy), and a free white female 5 years-old or under (daughter Lucinda). Hiram and Sarah Kennedy were both illiterate.\n\nOn December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed into the United States setting the stage for the Mexican War the following year (1846). With Texas now part of the U.S., in Hiram and Sarah Kennedy moved their family “by ox wagons” for nearly two months from Butler County (Kentucky) over 650 miles west to Harrison County (Texas).[1] In 1846, they reportedly settled three miles east of the town of Marshall, about 20 west of the border of Texas and Louisiana. Life was hard on the farm. With the bare necessities, the cooking was done in the fireplace, bread cooked in heavy dutch ovens on the hearth and other foods cooked in the old iron pots hanging over the fireplace.\n\nHiram Kennedy was appointed Justice of the Peace in Harrison County. He had to post a $500 bond for the job of Justice of the Peace. In his application he swore that he had never fought a duel with firearms. The bond was dated August 24, 1848 (need citation).\n\nAccording to the 1850 Federal Census, the 39 year-old H. Kennedy was living in household #758 of Harrison County, Texas. Born in Kentucky, H. (Hiram) Kennedy was farmer with 40 acres improved land (120 acres unimproved) along with a horse, 5 milk cows, 2 oxen, 7 other cattle, 15 hogs, and 140 bushels of Indian corn. He was living with his 37 year-old wife S. (Sarah) Kennedy, his 15 year-old daughter L.E. (Lucinda Elizabeth) Kennedy, his 13 year-old son P. M. (Pierson Miller) Kennedy, his 11 year-old son J. M. (Jim Newton) Kennedy, his 10 year-old son Will Kennedy, his 8 year-old son B. F. Kennedy, his 3 year-old daughter S. J. (Sarah Jane) Kennedy, and his one month-old daughter M. E. (Mary Ellen) Kennedy. Also living in the same household was the 40 year-old M. L. Kennard and his 27 year-old wife M. A. Kennard (possibly Hiram Kennedy’s sister). With exception of the two youngest daughters (S. J. & M. E. who were born in Texas), S. Kennedy and her older children were born in Kentucky. A farmer, M. L. Kennard was born in South Carolina and M. A. Kennard was born in Kentucky.\n\nLiving nearby in household #774 was 35 year-old A. J. Sowders (possible relative of Sarah Kennedy). Born in Indiana, A. J Sowders was a farmer living with his 30 year-old wife J. sowders, his 15 year-old son J. Sowder, his 14 year-old daughter E. sowder, his 13 year-old son B. Sowders, 11 year-old daughter S. H. sowders, his 9 year-old son J. A. Sowders, his 6 year-old son E. Sowders, and his 4 year-old son D. L. Sowders (all born in Tennessee).\n\nLiving nearby in household #515 was the 36 year-old J. J. Kennedy (possible relative of Hiram Kennedy). Born in South Carolina, J. J. Kennedy was a farmer with 50 acres improved land (270 acres unimproved), along with 4 horses, a mule, 5 milk cows, 2 oxen, 6 other cattle, 20 hogs, and 250 bushels of Indian corn (owned 5 slaves). He was living with his 39 year-old wife E. Kennedy, his 16 year-old daughter S. Kennedy, his 12 year-old son J. F. Kennedy, his 10 year old daughter M. Kennedy, his 8 year-old daughter E. Kennedy, and his two year-old daughter E. Kennedy. His wife was born in South Carolina, daughter S. Kennedy was born in Alabama, and the remaining children were born in Texas.\n\nOn Auguste 29, 1854, Hiram Kennedy appeared before the Clerk of the County Court in Harrison County (Texas) with John Thomas and H. H. Wall. Hiram Kennedy certified he was the assignee of William Whitaker and entitles to 320 acres and had occupied the land since 1847. As a result, a patent for the 320 acres was issued to Hiram Kennedy on July 11, 1856. According to the survey (dated September 25, 1847), the 320 acres were located “between the Cypress and about 3 miles S. of the Big Cypress” about 2.5 miles east of the county line between Harrison and Upshur County.[2]\n\nInterestingly, located close to the 320 acres settled by Hiram Kennedy was a 304 acre tract of land issued to Sarah Kennedy. Sarah Kennedy conveyed the land to Robert G. Cartwright for $100 on May 17, 1847 (attested by James Hanks & Bartley Kennedy). Sarah Kennedy had been entitled to an unconditional “Headright Certificate” for 640 acres due to having emigrated to Republic of Texas on March 1, 1841.[3] It is not known if this Sarah Kennedy or Bartley Kennedy are related to Hiram Kennedy.\n\nAbout 1857, Hiram and Sarah Kennedy moved their family another 130 miles west to Lamar County (Texas) where they built a home near “Bushy Creek and Sulphur River” (see below).\n\nHiram Kennedy was a Christian minister and went about the area preaching at numerous stations, schoolhouses, homes or anywhere people could gather to hear the gospel preached, as there were no organized churches in the area. He endorsed the faith of what would become the Church of Christ. Hiram and Sarah Kennedy’s children had very little or no formal education, but obtained a wealth of knowledge from the parents in the fundamentals of reading, writing, arithmetic and the Bible around the fireside. Numerous references were made by the children and passed down to present generations as to the place the religious training and the Bible had in their lives.\n\nOn November 31, 1853, the daughter Hiram Kennedy (Lucinda Elizabeth Kennedy) married Madison Sheppard in Harrison County, Texas.[4]\n\nOn December 25, 1858, the son of Hiram Kennedy (P. M. Kennedy) married Louisa Wilcox in Hopkins County, Texas.[5]\n\nIt is unclear where, if at all, Hiram Kennedy and his family were listed in the 1860 Federal Census. It is possible he was the 51 year-old father H. T. Kennedy listed as living in household #225 in Precinct #1 of Lamar County, Texas. Born in Kentucky, this H. T. Kennedy was a farmer living with his 49 year-old wife S. L. Kennedy, his 19 year-old son W. M. Kennedy (farmer), his 14 year-old son B. F. Kennedy, and his 10 year-old daughter Ja(?) (Jane?) Kennedy. His wife and sons were born in Kentucky; and the daughter was born in Texas. However, his daughter Sarah Jane Kennedy would have been 13 years-old (not 10 years-old as listed) and his three younger children (Mary Ellen, Cassandra & George) along with his older son Jim Newton Kennedy (born 1839) were not listed (see cropped image from census below).\n\nLiving nearby in neighboring Hopkins County was the son of Hiram Kennedy, the 29 year-old Parson M. Cannady. Born in Kentucky, Parson M. Cannady was a laborer on the farm and was living with his 19 year-old wife Louisa Cannady. Born in Kentucky, Louisa Cannady was the daughter of Jacob and Eliza Wilcox.\n\nOn November 1, 1860, 160 acres on “Bushy Creek waters of North Sulphur fork of Red River” on the southeastern “corner of Lamar County on the Red river County line” were surveyed for Hiram Kennedy. However, the 160 acres appear to have been determined to be in Hopkins County (see below). According to a note in the file (dated June 1, 1860), “the survey of 160 Acres Preemption of Hiram Kennedy made this day No 548 is in a portion of a survey made…18th March 1842 for William Candle (?) of 320 Acres No 280, supposed to be forfeited“.[6]\n\nOn October 19, 1860, Hiram Kennedy made a declaration that he was a citizen of Lamar County entitled to land under “the Act to authorize the sale of public domain“. John R. Worthington and Aba Rogers appeared on his behalf and Thomas H. Skidmore was the Notary Public (Lamar County). On November 1, 1860, 160 acres on “Bushy Creek waters of North Sulphur fork of Red River” on the southeastern “corner of Lamar County on the Red river County line” were surveyed for Hiram Kennedy (see above). However, some of the 160 acres appears to have been determined to be in Hopkins County. According to a note in the file (dated June 1, 1860), “the survey of 160 Acres Preemption of Hiram Kennedy made this day No 548 is in a portion of a survey made…18th March 1842 for William Candle (?) of 320 Acres No 280, supposed to be forfeited“.[7]\n\nHiram and Sarah Kennedy lost one son, William, who served in the Lamar Rifles under the command of Captain Sam Bell Makey. Later, as the war continued, Hiram Kennedy enlisted into Company C of Col. DeMorse’s 29th Texas Cavalry in Pattonville, Texas, July 18, 1862, at the age of 51 (see muster roles). His son, Benjamin Kennedy joined the CSA after his 18th birthday (see news paper article below).\n\nTHE PARIS NEWS, June 11, 1935 (“Backward Glances” column)\n\n“Horse carried Father and Son in War”\n\n“Leaving their home in Harrison County in the state that grows fast horses , pretty women, and blue grass, Mr. Kennedy and his wife and their children traveled in ox wagons to Lamar County. They were Jim, Miller, Ben, George, Ellen, Lucinda and Cassie. After nearly two months slow travel, they reached Lamar County and Mr. Kennedy settled on a tract near Brushy Creek and Sulfur River. Here he built a shack and began clearing land and farming, increasing his farm acreage each year as the frost felled. Deer, turkeys and other small game were abundant so there was plenty of food and the family fared as as well as did others of those early days. Then the war between the sections began. After a while, the father of the family (Hiram) decided that it was his duty to go with his neighbors into the army that fought for a principle and mounting his horse, a little brown pony call Choc, he rode away, trusting his family to carry on the work of making a home while he was gone…”\n\n“…In 1864, young Ben Kennedy, who had reached his eighteenth year, decided he, too, would take part in the war and joined his father on the battlefront. The father’s enlistment, having expired. He returned to his family and turning his horse over to his son, he came back to Texas and resumed his work. Ben Kennedy rode the horse to the end of the war and when the roar of the cannon and the rattle of muskets ceased, he turned his face to home, still riding the faithful little horse. He reached Bushy Creek at night. There had been heavy rains and the water was wide and deep. Fearing the horse would not make it, Ben tied him to a sapling elm and slipping into the water, swam the creek and was reunited with his parents and brothers and sisters. The next day when the water had subsided, he brought his horse across.”\n\n“…That was seventy years ago. Hiram Kennedy has long since gone to his reward…The old log house that Hiram built still stands…and the elm sapling to which Ben tied his horse has grown into a veritable monarch of the forest.” (see below)\n\nOn July 19, 1866, the daughter of Hiram Kennedy (Sarah J. Kennedy) married Joseph Owens in Lamar County, Texas.[8]\n\nOn March 6, 1871, Hiram Kennedy appeared with Josiah Pope and Jas. R. Manemy (?) before the Clerk of Court in Hopkins County, Texas. Hiram Kennedy declared under oath that he had settled on his land and head of his family as of August 12, 1870 (see below). The land included 160 acres located in Lamar County (Texas) “on the North side of the Sulphur fork of the Red River about 22 miles” northeast of Sulphur Springs and 22.5 miles southeast of Paris.[9]\n\nOn October 24, 1870, the daughter of Hiram Kennedy (S. J. Owens) married her second husband L. P. Ditto in Hopkins County, Texas.[10]\n\nOn August 27, 1874, the son of Hiram Kennedy (J. N. Kennedy) married Elizza A. I. Fields in Delta County, Texas.[11]\n\nOn November 15, 1877, the son of Hiram Kennedy (George Washington Kennedy) married Mary “Mollie” David Decker in Lamar County, Texas. They built a home on land owned by Hiram Kennedy soon after their marriage. With the exception of their youngest child (Claude Alonzo Kennedy), all of the children were born in this home.[12]\n\nGravestones:\n\nHiram T. Kennedy and his wife, Sarah, are both buried in Halesboro Cemetery in Red River County, Texas. In addition, their son Jim Newton Kennedy is buried at this same location.\n\n[1] “Hiram Kennedy, Preacher and Soldier“, The Paris News (Paris Texas), February 28, 1935, Page 6; “Horse Carried Father and Son to War” The Paris News (Paris, Texas) dated June 11, 1935, Page 4.\n\n[2] Harrison County File #000589 for William Whitaker, Texas Land Office Records.\n\n[3] Harrison County File #000467 for Sarah Kennedy, Texas Land Office Records.\n\n[4] Texas Marriage Collection (1814-1909).\n\n[5] Texas Select County Marriage Index (1837-1965).\n\n[6] Lamar Scrip File #000132 for Hiram Kennedy, Texas Land Office.\n\n[7] Lamar Scrip File #000132 for Hiram Kennedy, Texas Land Office.\n\n[8] Texas Marriage Collection (1814-1909 & 1966-2002).\n\n[9] Lamar County File #000065 for Hiram Kennedy, Texas Land Office Records.\n\n[10] Texas Select County Marriage Index (1837-1965).\n\n[11] Texas Select County Marriage Index (1837-1965); Texas, Marriage Index (1824-2014).\n\n[12] “George W. and Mary (Mollie) Decker Kennedy” by Imogene Kennedy Crossland, Elzora Bell and Alex Watson and all related families compiled by Cassie Watson Cook, Page 124.\n\nCopyright © The content of these pages is strictly for the personal use of family members.
