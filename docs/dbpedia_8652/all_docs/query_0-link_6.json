        "text": "Personal life\n\nSarah Kennedy was born in Sussex, being raised in East Grinstead, the daughter of a stockbroker and a nurse. She studied for two years at drama school, becoming a drama teacher. She was a matron at Copthorne Prep School.\n\nIn her twenties, she married a member of the armed forces. She has a partner, Adrian McGlynn, a director of Weatherbys, to whom she refers as her \"much beloved\". He became a popular character in the show. They met at the wedding of Desmond Morris's son, where McGlynn was best man. They reside in Northamptonshire although Kennedy has an apartment in a converted school building in London.\n\nCareer history\n\nKennedy began her career with the British Forces Broadcasting Service in Singapore, before moving to BBC Radio 2 in 1976, where she presented Family Favourites and did the final closedown before the station moved to 24-hour broadcasting in January 1979. She was also president of the hospital radio station known as \"Radio Horton\", based in the Horton Hospital, Oxfordshire.\n\nKennedy's first on-screen job was reading the news on Southern Television's Day by Day. She came to prominence in TV as one of the hosts of the ITV light entertainment show Game for a Laugh from 1981 to 1984. She was also one of the team involved with the short-lived BBC current affairs programme 60 Minutes, which ran from 1983 to 1984, and was the main presenter of the ITV game show Busman's Holiday for several series in the 1980s. She also co-hosted The Animals Roadshow and Animal Country with zoologist Desmond Morris in the late 1980s and 1991 respectively.\n\nIn 1993, Kennedy returned to Radio 2, to present the weekday early morning show, called The Dawn Patrol. It was originally broadcast from 5am to 7am each day, but moved to the time-slot of 6 am to 7.30 am in 1994. In 1995, Kennedy received a prestigious Sony Gold Radio Award. She had a regular audience of around 4.5 million listeners on Radio 2. Due to Terry Wogan's retirement from his breakfast show in December 2009 and the ambitions of his successor Chris Evans, the morning radio schedule was changed, and Kennedy's show was moved earlier to the 5am to 7am slot to accommodate a longer Evans show. It was announced on Friday 3 September 2010 that she was to leave her Radio 2 show. She had been absent for several weeks beforehand and would not return to the show before a shake-up of the schedules in October. Her programme was presented during this time by Lynn Parsons.\n\nKennedy has also published a novel, Charlotte's Friends, as well as two collections of listeners' tales, called Terrible Twos (two editions) and Terrible Pets.\n\nCharacteristics and mannerisms\n\nHer reworking of English words was a distinctive element of the show. She changed names as follows: \"The Eaglingtons\" (Eagles), \"The Kinkingtons\" (The Kinks), \"Sainsbugs\" (Sainsbury's), \"Colleag-wees\" (colleagues), \"supermercado\" (supermarkets as in Spain), \"breasticles\"/\"chesticles\" (breasts), Chancellor of the Exchequingtons etc. She frequently read out the expression \"SW's to you\" from listeners who wrote in. \"SWs\" was shorthand for \"Love the show\" (as in the oft-quoted phrase by Steve Wright on his programmes, hence the use of his initials). Many listeners wrote in to ask what \"SWs\" actually meant, but she rarely explained it. Kennedy was also said to have been the first person to use the term 'white van man' in 1997.\n\nCareer incidents and controversies\n\nKennedy has sometimes suffered with her health, and has had to take time off work. Her slurred speech throughout her show on 13 August 2007 gained media attention, but the presenter blamed a sore throat. She presented the following day's show as normal, before taking a month-long break, leaving the show to be presented by colleagues Pete Mitchell, Alex Lester, Aled Jones and Richard Allinson. It was later reported that Kennedy was recovering from pneumonia. She returned to work on 10 September 2007.\n\nShe also attracted concern after a bizarre performance while standing in for Terry Wogan in May 1999. This included calling Ken Bruce an \"old fool\" and referring to the presenter of the day's \"Pause For Thought\" slot as \"an old prune\". She blamed the incident on a lack of sleep the previous night and apologised to listeners. She had been due to stand in for Wogan the following week, but took time off instead.\n\nIn October 2007, she was reprimanded after joking (in a segment about the importance of wearing visible clothing in winter road conditions) that she had almost run over a black pedestrian because she couldn't see him in the dark. The BBC later apologised for the comment. She has previously opined that black men dominate athletics because they are accustomed to being pursued by lions.\n\nShe was also \"spoken to\" by BBC bosses after she praised Enoch Powell during a show in July 2009, describing Powell as \"the best Prime Minister this country never had\".\n\nIn May 2014, Kennedy was banned from driving for 22 months for drink driving. She had crashed into a stationary car.\n\nExit from Radio 2\n\nKennedy had presented The Dawn Patrol since 1993. Due to Terry Wogan's departure and a minor reshuffle in 2010, her show moved from 6.00–7.30am to 5.00–7.00am. Many listeners were already concerned that the 5.00am starts were starting to affect aspects of Kennedy's health and her absences became more frequent."
