        "text": "For almost two decades, Adewale has invested his time and effort in finding ways to help professionals maximize productivity and happiness through coaching and personalized training interventions. His Bachelor’s degree in Humanistic Psychology and Master’s in Instructional Design gave him a good foundation in behavioral science and performance improvement. He has completed over 1,000 hours of coaching and designed several training programs on leadership competencies used to onboard new managers. Before venturing into coaching full time, he spent 10 years working for Fortune 50 telecommunication companies, holding individual contributor and team management roles. His unique background and experience have deeply informed his coaching with the ability to motivate, inspire, and guide my clients using my positive energy and conscious business strategy, resulting in them overcoming burnout, and regaining their drive, passion, and desire for peak performance. He's helped several clients create individual development plans, transition into new roles, define goals, create action plans, improve negotiating skills, and achieve other major outcomes they are looking for, both in their professional and personal lives. He also has extensive experience working with managers and directors to create a culture of alignment, resilience, and growth in their workplace Over the years, he's worked within diverse industries, ranging from tech companies ( e.g Google, Snap, Facebook, Intuit, and Amazon) to healthcare, manufacturing, hospitality, finance, education, telecommunications, and government. I have also partnered with several organizations in leading D&I initiatives. On the personal side, he is very involved with InterNations and other global expat organizations. The time he spent living in Russia, Belgium, and Argentina heightened his passion for international relationships and event volunteering.\n\nAs an Executive Coach I support individuals to achieve success, whatever success looks like to them, by overcoming their own limitations, understanding what are they driven by and helping them align to their ultimate purpose. My background is in business and I am qualified to the level of an MBA. I have been running my own business for the last 10 years which helped me to understand the challenges that an employer faces. Over the last years, I have been coaching employees and managers from different sectors and companies around the world and what I have discovered was that, most often the battle is given inside ourselves rather than the outside. In our journeys towards success, we strive to close the gap between who we are and who we want to become. How about yourself?\n\nAL has 20 + years of for-profit, non-profit, and government experience. He holds a Master’s Degree in Organizational Leadership and a Professional Certified Coach Credential through the International Coach Federation.

While stationed overseas, he successfully managed and coached a team of 38 Veterans from all special operations branches of the United States Military.

As an Executive Coach and Leadership Trainer, he strives to offer the right balance of challenge and support, which is different for every person.\n\nWith a 15-year career in technology across multiple Fortune 500 companies, Alexis’ path to coaching was neither linear nor foreseen but inevitable upon reflection. Though she spent most of her career in client-facing, logic-based, analytical roles, the pandemic allowed space to pause, find out what is important to her, and pivot into a more heart-centered profession. As a result, in 2020, she pursued an M.Sc. degree in Executive Coaching and Organizational Consulting from NYU - the impetus for launching her I, Matter! Coaching and Consulting practice. Alexis initially hesitated to launch her business for various reasons, many tied to her limiting beliefs. But, she recognized that someone in the world needed her gifts, and not moving forward could deprive them of a coach who might help transform their lives. She partners with high-achieving women to advocate for themselves and find and use their voices. She is a non-judgemental cheerleader, encouraging clients through the process as they uncover potential roadblocks precluding the best version of themselves from being revealed. Many of her clients no longer connect to their inner knowing to understand what resonates for them. While others know what they want, deep-seated (conscious or unconscious) fear prevents movement. “I wanted Black and Brown women to know it was ok to take up space, in every sense of the word, to go after those dreams long since abandoned, and to put themselves first when making certain life decisions.”\n\nAs a coach, Alison understands firsthand the power of the other to help us unlock our potential.
