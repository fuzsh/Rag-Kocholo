        "text": "Nicola Griffith has today (29 June) won the inaugural ADCI (Authors with Disabilities and Chronic Illnesses) Literary Prize, for Spear (Tordotcom Publishing), a lyrical, queer reimagining of Arthurian legend, in which ‘those usually airbrushed from history take centre stage’ (ADCI Literary Prize judge Penny Batchelor).\n\nThe prize, launched in 2022 to encourage greater positive representation of disability in literature, was announced alongside ten other prizes which make up the annual Society of Authors’ Awards. The SoA Awards is the UK’s biggest literary prize fund, worth over £100,000, this year shared between 30 writers, poets and illustrators.\n\nThe winners, featuring authors at all stages of their careers – from debut poets and novelists to well-established writers – will be celebrated this evening at the Society of Authors’ Awards ceremony at Southwark Cathedral, generously sponsored by the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society (ALCS).\n\nThe ceremony, presented by Joanne Harris with a keynote from Val McDermid to an audience of over 300 winners, judges and other authors, will be livestreamed from 7PM.\n\nPoet Jay Gao wins both an Eric Gregory Award and a Somerset Maugham Award this year for his thrilling debut collection, Imperium (Carcanet Press). Through reimagined episodes from Homer’s Odyssey, Imperium asks questions about diaspora and how past lives permeate the present. It was described by judge Wayne Holloway Smith as ‘the work of a poet mind shot through with intellect and cultural capital’.\n\nOther winners include Daniel Wiles, who wins the Betty Trask Prize for Mercia’s Take (Swift Press), a brutal portrayal of life as a 19th century miner and of a world wreaked by the exploitation that fed the British empire. Nibbies Debut Novel of the Year Trespasses (Bloomsbury Publishing), by Louise Kennedy, was selected as winner of the McKitterick Prize, ‘an intelligent, delicately told tale of love under military rule’ (Selma Dabbagh).\n\nThe powerful, ‘urgent and moving’ memoir None of The Above: Reflections on Life Beyond the Binary (Canongate Books) by Travis Alabanza was a Somerset Maugham winner this year – a ‘testimony to the vicissitudes of living as a non-binary person of colour in modern Britain’ (Somerset Maugham judge Ardashir Vakil).\n\nSpeaking about the Awards, keynote speaker Val McDermid said:\n\nAwarded by authors, for authors, the SoA Awards hold a special place in the literary calendar. It is vital that we celebrate the work authors do to help us find meaning in tumultuous times, now more than ever. This year’s winners make that task easy. They have given us a plethora of riches: from sweeping novels, to searching poetry, to first works by exciting authors at the start of new careers. I hope each win fuels that joy of words that first gave birth to these many and various works.\n\nSomerset Maugham and Eric Gregory Award winner Jay Gao said:\n\nIt’s always an incredible feeling to know that one’s writing has been read with care and generosity, especially by the poets and writers who regularly inspire my own work. It really means a lot to be recognised as a small part of this broad and diverse creative community being celebrated through the Society of Authors. This support is important for me as, more than anything else, I know it will encourage me to keep writing.\n\nJoin the livestream\n\nBuy the books\n\nThe winners for each award are:\n\nThe ADCI Literary Prize\n\nSponsored by Arts Council England, ALCS, the Drusilla Harvey Memorial Fund, and the Professional Writing Academy, the ADCI Literary Prize is awarded to a disabled or chronically ill writer, for an outstanding novel containing a disabled or chronically ill character or characters. Judged by Penny Batchelor, Rowan Hisayo Buchanan, Nydia Hebden, Karl Knights, Julia Lund, Nii Ayikwei Parkes, Vikki Patis and Chloe Timms.\n\nTHE ADCI LITERARY PRIZE WINNER: NICOLA GRIFFITH FOR SPEAR (TORDOTCOM PUBLISHING) AWARDED £1,250\n\nNicola Griffith (she/her) is a dual UK/US citizen living in Seattle. She is the author of seven award-winning novels, including Hild and Ammonite, and her shorter work has appeared in Nature, New Scientist, The New York Times, etc. She is the founder and co-host of #CripLit, holds a PhD from Anglia Ruskin University, and enjoys a ferocious bout of wheelchair boxing. She is married to novelist and screenwriter Kelley Eskridge.\n\nADCI Literary Prize judge Rowan Hisayo Buchanan said:\n\nI was hugely impressed by this work. There is real ambition and fluidity to the writing. It represents a vast amount of research and yet it wears that research lightly. While there was much recognizable to anyone with a glancing knowledge of Arthurian legend, there was also much that felt new. Griffith combines pre-existing myths in inventive and delightful ways. The representation in this story is joyful – acknowledging what might cause a character to be seen as other but finding no shame in it.\n\nTHE ADCI LITERARY PRIZE RUNNER-UP: FIONA SCOTT-BARRETT FOR THE EXIT FACILITY (SELF PUBLISHED) AWARDED £750\n\nFiona Scott-Barrett was in her twenties when she was diagnosed as having Best disease, a degenerative eye condition that leads to the gradual loss of central vision. After an internationally successful career as an author of textbooks for students of English as a Foreign Language, Fiona returned to the UK and took up writing fiction. The Exit Facility, which features a heroine with Best disease, is her debut novel. Fiona is currently working on her second novel, which is inspired by her time living on the island of Crete, and is attending a short course in experimental writing at the University of Edinburgh. She has been a member of the Society of Authors since 1996.\n\nALCS Tom-Gallon Trust Award\n\nSponsored by the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society (ALCS) and Hawthornden Foundation, the ALCS Tom-Gallon Trust Award is awarded for a short story by a writer who has had at least one short story accepted for publication. Judged by Claire Fuller, Sophie Haydock, Billy Kahora and Mary Watson.\n\nTotal prize fund: £5,000\n\nTHE ALCS TOM-GALLON TRUST AWARD WINNER: CIARÁN FOLAN FOR ‘A DAY’, AWARDED £2,000\n\nCiarán Folan has had stories published in The Dublin Review, The London Magazine, Prole and with The Stinging Fly online. He won the RTÉ Francis MacManus Short Story Competition twice and was a runner up for the Michael McLaverty Short Story Award in 2016 and 2018. He was shortlisted for the V S Pritchett Short Story Prize in 2020.\n\nALCS Tom-Gallon Trust Award judge Claire Fuller said:\n\nOur winning story drew me in from the very beginning, and then looped the idea of time over and under and over again so cleverly that I was never lost but felt I knew everything I needed to know about these characters and their situation. With its beautiful melancholic tone, ‘A Day’ by Ciaran Folan is storytelling at its very best.\n\nTHE ALCS TOM-GALLON TRUST AWARD RUNNER-UP: KAREN STEVENS FOR ‘AMONG THE CROWS’, AWARDED £1,000\n\nKaren Stevens is a writer and lecturer in creative writing at the University of Chichester, West Sussex. Her short stories have been published in The Big Issue, Pulp Net, Panurge New Fiction, Mouth Ogres, Dreaming Beasts, Fish Publishing, Riptide, Salt Publishing and Valley Press. Her edited collection of essays, Writing a First Novel: Reflections on the Journey, was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2014.

Judged by Sara Collins, Michael Donkor and Alex Preston.\n\nTotal prize fund: £26,200\n\nTHE BETTY TRASK PRIZE WINNER: DANIEL WILES FOR MERCIA’S TAKE (SWIFT PRESS) AWARDED £10,000\n\nDaniel Wiles is from Walsall in the West Midlands. He recently completed the Prose MA at UEA, where he was the recipient of the Booker Prize Foundation Scholarship. Mercia’s Take is his first novel.\n\nBetty Trask Prize judge Michael Donkor said:\n\nMercia’s Take is an extraordinary debut. Simultaneously intimate and epic, it tracks the journey of one man’s voyage through the 19th century Black Country, to right injustices both personal and political, with a compassion that is never cloying. Wiles is a master stylist: in this debut, each sentence is as dark and tough as the coal our protagonist mines each day. Characters – even those who are seemingly peripheral – have voices that ring with earthy credibility. Wiles’ evocation of the landscape is stunning too, often showing the sublimity that can exist alongside struggle. With a thrillingly pacy plot and immaculately crystalline expression, this is a very special debut indeed.\n\nCholmondeley Awards\n\nSix winners each awarded £1,400\n\nThe Cholmondeley Awards are awarded for a body of work by a poet and contribution to poetry. Judged by Moniza Alvi, Hannah Lowe, Drew Milne and Deryn Rees-Jones.\n\nTotal prize fund: £8,400.\n\nThe winners are Caroline Bird, Jane Draycott, Greta Stoddart, Michael Symmons Roberts, Jackie Wills and Tamar Yoseloff.\n\nCholmondeley Awards judge Moniza Alvi said:\n\nThe Cholmondeley Awards have been, since they were introduced in 1966, important honorary awards that recognise poets’ sustained excellence across a body of work. Some of the recipients will already be well-known in the poetry world, while others may be deserving of wider recognition for the distinction of their writing. Many of them will have contributed to the genre in a variety of ways, through their performances and tutoring, for example. The Cholmondeley Awards prove that excellence can be perceived across a wide range of poetry from a diversity of poets. It is hoped that the recipients will feel valued, encouraged and truly celebrated.\n\nCaroline Bird is a poet and playwright. Her sixth collection, The Air Year, won the Forward Prize for Best Collection 2020 and was shortlisted for the Polari Prize and the Costa Prize.

What this suggested for me was a new cohort of emerging voices with a keen sense of what’s at stake in this cultural moment, a willingness to engage with troubling and complex subject areas, and a largely self-reflexive capacity to interrogate the self. My own imagination and proficiency as a reader was stretched again and again.\n\nP.A.Bitez or Princess Arinola Adegbite is a multi-award-winning artist, poet, musician, actress, and laureled filmmaker from Manchester.

Told against a backdrop of ruined dreams, alcoholism and discoloured food, Trespasses is a unique account of a period British and Irish history of systematic oppression, challenged loyalties, criminality, alienation and bloodshed.\n\nTHE MCKITTERICK PRIZE RUNNER-UP: LIZ HYDER FOR THE GIFTS (MANILLA PRESS, BONNIER BOOKS UK) AWARDED £2,000\n\nLiz Hyder has been making up stories for as long she can remember.

It has been translated into over forty territories and is being adapted as an Apple TV series starring Brie Larson.\n\nPaul Torday Memorial Prize judge Andrew Taylor said:\n\nIt’s difficult to believe that Lessons in Chemistry is Bonnie Garmus’s first novel. Her central character, Elizabeth Zott, springs off the page and confronts us with such wit and authority that she seems always to have existed somewhere between Southern California and the land of wishful thinking.

Olaf lives in Bedfordshire; find out more about his work at www.olaffalafel.com\n\nQueen’s Knickers Award judge Sarah McIntyre said:\n\nI loved the way Olaf Falafel combined a simple cartooning style with texture and magic underwater lighting that occasionally gave the goofy story and character brief touches of the sublime. His varied page layouts paced the story beautifully, enlivened by gentle jokes. As judges, we all liked the way the story had an environmental message about keeping our beaches clean, but we appreciated how it didn’t do it in a way that would make children feel sad and helpless. Rather, it showed people on the beach doing the right thing, naturally tidying up and being helpful, in a simple, concrete way that children could immediately put into practice. I love how simple Olaf has made his main character to draw: I hope children will be inspired to write and draw the further comic adventures of Blobfish!\n\nQUEEN’S KNICKERS AWARD RUNNER-UP: JOHN AGARD & ILLUSTRATOR SATOSHI KITAMURA FOR WHEN CREATURE MET CREATURE (SCALLYWAG PRESS)\n\nJohn Agard is a poet, performer and anthologist.

All the entries spoke to us with eloquence and power. The range of work in terms of subject and writers testify to the wealth of books published and the healthy numbers of writers who answer the call of these times of strife and need.
