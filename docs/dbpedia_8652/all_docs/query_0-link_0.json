        "text": "About\n\nFrom 1993 until 2010, she hosted the popular BBC2 radio program The Dawn Patrol, attracting close to five million daily listeners and winning the Sony Gold Radio Award.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nBefore beginning her radio career, she taught drama at Copthorne Prep School in West Sussex, England.\n\nTrivia\n\nShe stirred controversy by making several racially insensitive comments on-air and also worried her fans and the BBC with her apparent slurred speech in a 2007 broadcast and with her very odd commentary during a 1999 radio show. Four years after ending her association with The Dawn Patrol, she had her driver's license suspended following a drunk driving accident.\n\nFamily Life\n\nRaised in West Sussex and East Grinstead, England, she is the child of a nurse and a stockbroker. Following an early marriage to an army serviceman, she had a long-term domestic partnership with businessman Adrian McGlynn.\n\nAssociated With"
