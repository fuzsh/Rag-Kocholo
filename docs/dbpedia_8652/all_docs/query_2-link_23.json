Born and raised in Dallas, Dr. Kennedy attended the all-girls school, Hockaday, from Pre-K until her graduation in 2008. She earned her undergraduate degree from Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee where she also played collegiate field hockey during her four years there. She then returned to Texas to complete her medical school training at The University of North Texas Health Science Center at the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine in Fort Worth, Texas before completing her residency in OB/GYN at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Permian Basin in Midland/Odessa, Texas in 2023, where she was elected Chief Resident during her final year of training.\n\nDr. Kennedy enjoys many aspects of women’s healthcare including normal and higher-risk obstetrics, well woman care, contraception care, problem gynecology, gynecological surgery including minimally invasive robotics, incontinence and menopausal care. She is passionate about working together with her patients to achieve an individualized and appropriate plan of care leading to ideal outcomes.\n\nOutside of work, Dr. Kennedy enjoys spending time with her family, exploring the great outdoors, traveling both domestically and abroad, rooting for all of the Dallas sports teams, and finding new culinary adventures."
