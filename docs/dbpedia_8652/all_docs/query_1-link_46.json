        "text": "Moving to a small town required a change of career. My previous experience told me that it would need to involve people and providing value and excellent service so this seemed to be a good fit.\n\nYou will find me in our motorhome affectionately named ‘Joey’, normally somewhere in the back country or don’t be surprised to hear that we took off on an adventure to somewhere obscure, like the time we had to get to Branson Missouri in seven days because I bought something on EBay. Did you know there are 33 towns called Springfield in the USA and I have seen most of them on many of our crazy adventures.\n\nMy first job in London in 1990 paid £6000 before tax a year and my train ticket to commute to London was £3800! So on top of a three hour commute each day I worked another three jobs."
