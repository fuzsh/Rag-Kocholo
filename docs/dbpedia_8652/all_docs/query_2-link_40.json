        "text": "Sarah Frances Kennedy was born about 1850, the daughter of Robert J. & Cynthia (Eason) Kennedy. We believe her first marriage was to David S. Kennedy on the 26th of June 1870 according to the Decatur County records. David is said to have died in 1873. Sarah was then married to James Frank O'Neal on the 4th of April 1876 also in Decatur County. James Frank O'Neal died about 1879 and around 1882 she married Thomas Anderson Hemby. Thomas also preceded her in death. Sarah died 25 February 1924 and is buried in the Old Bethel Cemetery in Henderson County beside Thomas. She and David had but one child that we know of - Cynthia Ann Kennedy born 4 April 1871 in Decatur County. Her marriage to James Frank O'Neal producted another known daughter, whose name was Ada F. O'Neal. There are four more children with Thomas - Dollie M., Shade Winston, Samuel Albert and Lucy. We believe there are at least 2 more children born to Sarah. Rita Jines Morgan is a descendant of the first daughter, Cynthia Ann Kennedy who married Varnie Moore Jines 25 September 1892 in Decatur County. They were the parents of seven children. Cynthia and her husband eventually moved over to Humboldt in Gibson County TN where she died in 1948. Her death certificate and other sources show her buried in Climer/Clymer cemetery but we have found no record of that cemetery in any nearby county. There is also the thought that she might have been buried in the Harris Church Cemetery since that is where her funeral was held. Her husband Varnie Jines died in 1947. After they left Decatur and Henderson counties, the family lived around Crockett, Gibson and Madison counties."
