        "text": "Sarah Kennedy is the RJ Owens Fellow in English and a College Associate Professor. She completed her BA (Hons.) and LLB (Hons.) at the University of Melbourne, Australia. She worked as a commercial solicitor specialising in competition litigation before commencing her academic career. She was a recipient of the Rae and Edith Bennett Travelling Scholarship, which funded her PhD research at St John's College, Cambridge. She was a Junior Research Fellow at Downing College, Cambridge, 2013–2017.\n\nShe has given lectures and talks in the UK, US, Australia, and Italy, and has appeared on Sky Arts speaking about the poetry of T. S. Eliot. In 2016 she delivered the Annual T. S. Eliot Lecture, on ‘Eliot’s Ghost Women’, at Newnham College, Cambridge. In 2017 she was a Visiting Fellow at Pomona College, Claremont, California.\n\nSarah’s research interests fall within twentieth-century and contemporary Anglophone poetry, film, and fiction. They include early and high modernism, metaphor, close reading, creativity and the ethics of attention, narrative in film and prose fiction, nature-writing, vibrant materialism, and ecopoetics, the pelagic imaginary, the energy unconscious, trauma, literary motherhood, the uncanny, literary self-conception, originality, and allusion. She is especially intrigued by questions of poetic influence, creative inheritance, and the literary afterlives of poets. She is also interested in the postcolonial literatures of the Pacific, including Aotearoa/new Zealand and Australia, and in trans-regional encounters between these literatures and modernist diasporas.\n\nHer 2018 book T. S. Eliot and the Dynamic Imagination (Cambridge University Press) on metaphor and the imagination in the work of T. S. Eliot follows in the tradition of histories of the Romantic and Victorian poetics of originality, but focuses on the twentieth-century legacy of those histories and their interrelation with parallel fields of knowledge. It charts the relations between metaphor and creativity in Eliot's poetry and criticism through their affinities with discursive developments in 'new physics', optics, colour theory, psychology, and anthropology.\n\nIn addition to her work on Eliot she has published essays on the poets Elizabeth Bishop, Judith Wright, and Alice Oswald, the sculptors Barbara Hepworth, and Elisabeth Frink, and the film-maker Woody Allen. Her essay on Eliot and Wallace Stevens won the John Serio Award in 2019.\n\nShe is currently writing a contemporary novel as well as working on a revisionist close reading primer called The Shadow on the Page: A Field Guide to Close Reading. This project seeks to answer the need for a holistic yet accessible orientation into the practices of literary close reading on the page and in the world.\n\nA further project is tentatively titled The Self Made Strange: Landscape and Self-Estrangement in Postwar Lyric Poetry. This study explores metaphors of place as the key to the processes of transmission and assimilation (as well as the vertical pressure of literary influence) that generate creative and ethical tensions within the lyrical selfhood of a collection of exemplary mid-century poets."
