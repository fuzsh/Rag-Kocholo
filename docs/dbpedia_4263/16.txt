Osteichthyes – Characteristics, Classification and Examples

Osteichthyes, also known as bony fish, are a diverse group of vertebrates characterized by skeletons primarily composed of bone tissue. They form the largest class of vertebrates, with over 28,000 known species. Bony fish can be found in both freshwater and marine environments. Examples of freshwater bony fish include carp, perch, bass, trout, and catfish, while marine bony fish include tarpon, mackerel, tuna, sailfish, and barracuda.

The class Osteichthyes originated in the early Silurian period and experienced a significant adaptive dispersion during the middle Devonian period. They exhibit a remarkable diversity of species, with adaptations suited for life in various aquatic environments. Bony fish have undergone a remarkable evolutionary radiation, resulting in their current abundance and variety.

The classification of Osteichthyes has undergone revisions over time. The class is now typically divided into two subclasses: Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish) and Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish). Sarcopterygii includes more primitive fish groups like the coelacanths and lungfish. Actinopterygii comprises the majority of bony fish species and represents the true bony fish.

Within the class Osteichthyes, there are four main categories recognized by fishery scientists: lungfish or dipnoans, crossopterygians, actinopterygians, and bichir fish or brachiopterygians. However, some taxonomists disagree on the classification of these categories, and there is ongoing debate regarding their legitimacy.

Bony fish exhibit a wide range of adaptations and ecological roles. They have adapted to various feeding strategies, habitats, and reproductive modes. Bony fish possess well-developed gills for respiration, scales covering their bodies, and fins for propulsion and maneuvering in water.

The subclass Sarcopterygii includes lobe-finned fish, such as the coelacanths and lungfish. These fish have fleshy, lobed fins, which are considered more primitive. The subclass Actinopterygii consists of ray-finned fish, which have fins supported by bony rays. Ray-finned fish represent the majority of bony fish species and have evolved diverse forms and adaptations.

Bony fish have a significant impact on ecosystems and human societies. They serve as a vital food source for many communities around the world and play important ecological roles as predators, prey, and contributors to nutrient cycling in aquatic environments.

In summary, Osteichthyes, or bony fish, are a diverse and abundant group of vertebrates with skeletons primarily composed of bone tissue. They encompass a vast array of species adapted to different habitats and display remarkable diversity in form, function, and behavior.

General Characteristics of Osteichthyes

Osteichthyes, or bony fishes, exhibit a range of general characteristics that define this diverse class of vertebrates:

Size and Diversity: Osteichthyes is the largest class of vertebrates, comprising over 29,000 species. They display a wide variety of sizes, from the tiny Paedocypris progenetica (less than 8 mm) to the massive ocean sunfish (4 m, weighing about 1500 kg).

Endoskeleton: Bony fishes have an endoskeleton composed of bones, providing support and structure to their bodies.

Fins: They possess both paired and median fins. These fins are supported by long rays of cartilage or bone, allowing for swimming and maneuverability. Sarcopterygians, a subclass of bony fish, have fleshy lobed fins adapted for bottom-dwelling.

Homocercal Tail: The majority of bony fishes have a homocercal tail, meaning the upper and lower lobes of the tail fin are symmetrical.

Swim Bladder: Bony fishes possess a swim bladder or air bladder, which aids in buoyancy control and facilitates gaseous exchange.

Terminal Mouth: Bony fishes have a terminal mouth, positioned at the front of the head.

Gills and Operculum: Bony fishes typically have four pairs of gills, which are protected by a bony flap called the operculum.

Lungs in Sarcopterygians: Some bony fish groups, such as lungfishes and lobe-finned fishes, have lungs in addition to gills, allowing them to breathe air.

Skin and Scales: The skin of bony fishes is covered by bony dermal scales, which can be ganoid, cycloid, or ctenoid in shape.

Poikilothermy: Bony fishes are poikilothermic or cold-blooded animals, lacking the ability to regulate their internal body temperature. However, some larger marine species exhibit limited endothermy.

Circulatory System: Bony fishes have a two-chambered heart with one auricle and one ventricle. Lungfishes possess a three-chambered heart with two auricles and one ventricle.

Nervous System: The brain of bony fishes includes a small olfactory lobe and cerebellum. They have ten pairs of cranial nerves.

Lateral Line Organ: Bony fishes possess a lateral line organ consisting of hydrodynamic receptors called neuromasts. This sensory system helps them sense vibrations, water pressure, and aids in navigation and locating prey.

Reproductive System: Most bony fishes have separate sexes, although some species are hermaphrodites. They are predominantly oviparous, laying a large number of eggs. Fertilization is typically external, and direct development occurs.

Parental Care: While most bony fishes do not exhibit parental care, some species display courtship behaviors and provide care for their eggs or offspring.

These general characteristics contribute to the diversity and adaptability of bony fishes, allowing them to thrive in various aquatic habitats and play crucial roles in ecosystems.

Classification of Osteichthyes

Class Osteichthyes is divided into three subclasses. These are:

Subclass-1: Acanthodii

Acanthodii, also known as spiny sharks, belonged to the subclass Acanthodii and displayed several unique characteristics during their existence:

Extinct Status: Acanthodii are currently extinct, meaning they no longer exist in the present-day.

Geologic Range: These fascinating fish lived from the Devonian to the Permian period, spanning a considerable duration of time in Earth’s history.

Habitat Range: Acanthodii inhabited various aquatic environments, including freshwater lakes, rivers, and seas.

Ganoid Scales: Their skin was covered with primitive nature ganoid scales, which provided protection and resilience.

Fin Structure: With the exception of the tail fins, the other fins of Acanthodii possessed fin rays, providing stability and maneuverability in the water.

Example Species: Two examples of Acanthodii species are Climateus and Acanthodius, representing the diversity and uniqueness of this subclass.

Acanthodii, or spiny sharks, left a remarkable imprint in the history of aquatic life. Despite their extinction, their presence during the Devonian to Permian period highlights the evolutionary adaptations that occurred during that era. The ganoid scales and unique fin structure of Acanthodii exemplify the fascinating diversity of prehistoric fish species.

Subclass-2: Sarcopterygii (Gr., sarcos = fleshy; pterygium = fin)

Sarcopterygii, also known as lobe-finned fish, belong to the subclass Sarcopterygii and exhibit several distinctive characteristics:

Skeleton Composition: The skeleton of Sarcopterygii is composed of both partial hard bones and partial cartilage, combining the two structural elements.

Lung Development: In Sarcopterygii, the air sacs undergo a transformation and develop into lungs, allowing these fish to extract oxygen from the air.

Tail Fin Structure: The tail fin of Sarcopterygii is of the diphycercal type, characterized by a symmetrical tail with a distinct upper and lower lobe.

Lobed Paired Fins: The mid-region of the paired fins in Sarcopterygii is lobed, resembling leg-like appendages. These fins have a fleshy, bony central axis covered by scales.

Fin Arrangement: Sarcopterygii have two dorsal fins and a heterocercal caudal fin, which means the upper lobe of the tail is larger than the lower lobe.

Nostril Connection: The nostrils in Sarcopterygii are attached to the mouth cavity, often connected by internal nostrils or choanae.

Adaptation to Air Breathing: Sarcopterygii are commonly referred to as fleshy or lobe-finned fish due to their unique fin structure and their ability to breathe air.

The subclass Sarcopterygii includes a diverse group of fish with fascinating adaptations. Their combination of hard bones and cartilage in the skeleton, development of lungs, lobed paired fins, and air-breathing capabilities make them distinct from other fish species. Sarcopterygii exemplify the evolutionary innovations that occurred in aquatic life, ultimately paving the way for the emergence of terrestrial tetrapods.

Sarcopterygii has been divided into two superorders or orders- Crossopterygii and Dipnoi.

Examples of Osteichthyes

Osteichthyes, or bony fishes, encompass a wide range of species. Here are some notable examples:

Ray-finned fishes: This group includes numerous marine and freshwater bony fishes known for their fins supported by long, flexible rays. Examples include:

Hippocampus (Sea horse): These unique fish have a distinctive upright posture, a prehensile tail, and a unique mode of reproduction where males carry eggs in a specialized pouch.

Exocetus (Flying fish): Known for their long pectoral fins, these fishes can glide above the water’s surface to escape predators or travel long distances.

Lophius (Angler fish): Angler fishes have a characteristic “fishing lure” appendage on their heads to attract prey. They are known for their ambush predation strategy.

Freshwater bony fishes: This category comprises various bony fish species found in freshwater habitats. Examples include:

Labeo rohita (Rohu): Rohu is a popular freshwater fish species in South Asia, highly valued for its taste and commercial importance.

Labeo catla (Katla): Katla is another important freshwater fish species found in South Asia, known for its large size and high economic value.

Clarias (Walking catfish or Magur): These catfish species have the ability to use their pectoral fins to move across land for short distances.

Mystus (Catfish): Catfish species belonging to the Mystus genus are widely distributed in freshwater ecosystems and are popular aquarium pets.

Aquarium bony fishes: This group includes bony fishes commonly kept in aquariums due to their vibrant colors or unique characteristics. Examples include:

Betta splendens (Fighting fish): Also known as Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens is admired for its vibrant colors and elaborate fin displays.

Pterophyllum (Angelfish): Angelfish are known for their graceful appearance, triangular shape, and long, flowing fins. They are popular in the aquarium trade.

Lobe-finned fishes: This group includes bony fishes with fleshy lobed fins. While most species in this group are extinct, some living examples exist, such as:

Lungfishes: Lungfishes are air-breathing fishes found in stagnant waters of Africa, South America, and Australia. Notable species include Lepidosiren, Neoceratodus, and Protopterus.

Coelacanth (Latimeria): The coelacanth is a living fossil and represents the oldest known lineage of Sarcopterygii. They were once thought to be extinct until a living specimen was discovered in 1938.

These examples illustrate the diversity and uniqueness of bony fishes, showcasing their adaptability to various habitats and their importance in both natural ecosystems and human interactions.
