Wallace - natural selection Early 20th Century Development of Population Genetics Factual and theoretical aspects of theory of evolution Evidence for evolution as a fact of nature The fossil record Comparative studies of living species via anatomy, embryology,biochemistry, etc. Artificial selection Theory as to causes of evolution; mainly driven by natural selection The Evolution of Populations (Chapter 23) Natural Selection Detailed overview of the concept Stabilizing selection Directional selection: e.g. insecticide resistance Disruptive (=Diversifying) selection Biston betularia Mimicry in Limenitis arthemis butterflies Genetic drift and evolution in small populations Genes in populations - Hardy-Weinberg Law Speciation - formation of new species (Chapter 24) The biological species concept (Mayr) - groups of individuals reproductively isolated from other such groups - extremely little or no gene exchange between them Sympatric vs allopatric populations Why speciation is hard to study Mechanisms of speciation (a barrier to gene flow is essential) Anagenesis - time is the barrier; no multiplication of species Cladogenesis - splitting evolution; multiplication of species (1) Allopatric - geographic barrier a. Two models: - Gradualism - large subpopulations - Punctuated equilibrium - founders and other small populations (e.g., Williamson snail study) b. Results of isolation breakdown - hybridization and loss of differences, still one species - reproductive isolation, separate species Prezygotic mechanisms - behavioral, etc Postzygotic mechanisms - sterility, etc (2) Sympatric - nongeographic barrier a. Polyploidy - chromosome number differences create sterility barrier b. Other mechanisms -Rhagoletis pomonella (Apple maggot) as a possible example Adaptive Radiation - oceanic islands provide many examples Evolution at higher levels - genus, family, order, etc."
