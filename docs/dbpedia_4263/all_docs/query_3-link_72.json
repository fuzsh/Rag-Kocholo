        "text": "The cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes) of Liera are a class that contains the cartilaginous fishes that have skeletons primarily composed of cartilage. They can be contrasted with the Osteichthyes or bony fishes, which have skeletons primarily composed of bone tissue. Chondrichthyes are jawed vertebrates with paired fins, paired nares, scales, and a heart with its chambers in series. The cartilaginous fishes came to Liera from Earth during the Late Silurian through the harvesting by the portals and bringing them into suitable habitats of each major oceans in which they live.\n\nThe extant cartilaginous fishes range in size from the 10 centimeter (3.9 inches) dwarf sleeper ray to the 15.5 meter (50.8 ft) blue whale shark. The class is divided into two subclasses: Elasmobranchii (sharks, rays, skates, sawfish, and relatives) and Holocephali (chimaeras and relatives, sometimes called ghost sharks, which are sometimes separated into their own class). Within the infraphylum Gnathostomata, cartilaginous fishes are distinct from all other jawed vertebrates. The skeleton is cartilaginous, hence the class's name. The notochord is gradually replaced by a vertebral column during development, except in Holocephali, where the notochord stays intact. In some deepwater sharks, the column is reduced.\n\nAs they do not have bone marrow, red blood cells are produced in the spleen and the epigonal organ (special tissue around the gonads, which is also thought to play a role in the immune system). They are also produced in the Leydig's organ, which is only found in certain cartilaginous fishes. The subclass Holocephali, which is a very specialized group, lacks both the Leydig's and epigonal organs. Apart from electric rays, which have a thick and flabby body, with soft, loose skin, chondrichthyans have tough skin covered with dermal teeth (again, Holocephali is an exception, as the teeth are lost in adults, only kept on the clasping organ seen on the caudal ventral surface of the male), also called placoid scales (or dermal denticles), making it feel like sandpaper. In most species, all dermal denticles are oriented in one direction, making the skin feel very smooth if rubbed in one direction and very rough if rubbed in the other.\n\nOriginally, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, which do not contain any dermal elements, did not connect. In later forms, each pair of fins became ventrally connected in the middle when scapulocoracoid and puboischiadic bars evolved. In rays, the pectoral fins are connected to the head and are very flexible. One of the primary characteristics present in most sharks is the heterocercal tail, which aids in locomotion. Fertilization is internal. Development is usually live birth (ovoviviparous species) but can be through eggs (oviparous). Some rare species are viviparous. In most species, there is no parental care after birth; however, some chondrichthyans do guard their eggs, and a remarkable two species, the big-toothed shark (Otodus lierensis) and the anvil-backed shark (Incusendetergum socialis) are known to care for their young after birthing until they are mature enough to fend for themselves.\n\nSharks and kin figure prominently in Lieran people's mythology. Stories tell of Lieran persons with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and Lieran people form, which could have some truth in the case of sharkras. Tepua Island mythology also includes many shark gods; among a fishing Lieran people, the most popular of all tecomura, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark tecomura. Contrary to popular belief, only a few cartilaginous fishes are dangerous to Lieran people and human explorers. Out of more than 1,450 species, only twelve have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on Lieran people and human explorers: the Lieran white, Lieran whitetip, ravager, bison, big-toothed, devil, yinyang, north polar, south polar, saw-edge, raven, and walrus sharks. Despite the negative view on them by the human explorers, the Lieran people have treated sharks and kin with fear and deep respect. The cartilaginous fishes of Liera are not facing any major threats from the Lieran people due to the population levels of the Lieran people remaining low to allow enough space for both wildlife and the native people, similar in many respects to the humans of Kaimere.\n\nExample Species[]"
