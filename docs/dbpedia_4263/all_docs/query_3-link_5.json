        "text": "Class Osteichthyes\n\nComparing Osteichthyes and Chondrichthyes criteria and rubric\n\nBony fish\n\nSalmonoids, tuna, sunfish, eels, groupers, etc.\n\nAppeared ~420 million years ago\n\nThe largest class of vertebrates with ~28,000 species (96% of all fishes)\n\nEvolutionary advancement\n\nBony skeleton\n\nStronger and more rigid than cartilage.\n\nMade of collagen and calcium.\n\nThe operculum (bony plate that protects the gills). Typically, gill slits cannot be seen.\n\nGeneral anatomy\n\nHave a jaw and skeleton of bone with operculum\n\nPaired fins\n\nHomocercal tail (symmetrical)\n\nSwim bladder\n\nIntegument: Mucus glands embedded in dermal scales\n\nFormed from the deeper skin layer\n\nSwim bladder\n\nLarge air sac within the fish\n\nActs as a buoyancy organ – it helps the fish maintain buoyancy in the water (so it doesn’t sink to the bottom)\n\nIncreases in size when the fish wants to go up and decreases in size when the fish wants to go down.\n\nNeutrally buoyant fishes can hover in the water and swim with much less energy. However, there is only one depth at which a fish has neutral buoyancy, so it is important for the fish to be able to regulate the amount of gas in the swim bladder to maintain neutral buoyancy at different depths.” (Liem 1998:17)\n\nThis allows for easier neutral buoyance – more energy efficient (bony fish don’t need to swim to stay in the water column).\n\nPhysiology\n\nDigestive system\n\nSimilar to chondrichthyes, however no enlarged liver.\n\nHave a U-shaped stomach\n\nHave pyloric ceca which increases gut area and aids in digestion by secreting digestive enzymes.\n\nNo true cloaca (Separate opening for digestive system)\n\nBony fish digestion resource [website]\n\nReproduction\n\nExternal and internal fertilization (depends on species)\n\nOvoparous (egg laying), Viviparous (live bearing), ovoviviparous (Aplacental yolk sac viviparous) all seen in bony fish.\n\nSome are hermaphrodites (both male and female reproductive organs at same time, or can change)\n\nFun fact: Seahorses (Family Syngnathidae) are ovoviviparous (nutrients from yolk sac inside a parent) but it is the male seahorse that holds the eggs.\n\nThe female seahorse deposits eggs into a pouch on the male.\n\nThe male releases sperm into the pouch, fertilizing the eggs.\n\nAfter the embryos have developed, the male gives birth to tiny seahorses.\n\nSubclasses of Osteichthyes\n\nSubclass Actinopterygii\n\nRay-finned fishes\n\nFins are webs of skin supported by bony spines or “rays”\n\n99% of all bony fish species\n\nSalmon, eels, angler fish, seahorses, cod, halibut\n\nSubclass Sarcopterygii\n\nLobe-finned fishes\n\nFins are fleshy and joined to the body by a bone (able to support weight)\n\nLimbed animals are thought to have evolved from lobe-finned fishes\n\nOnly 7 species are living today\n\nCoelacanth -> thought extinct, rediscovered in 1938\n\nLungfish -> Have lungs and gills\n\nQuestion: Of the six species of lungfish, only one can respire with their gills (Australian lungfish). This lungfish only have one lung, while the other 5 species have two lungs, but cannot use their gills to respire. What does this tell you about the process of evolution?\n\nOsteichthyan spotlight\n\nDeep-sea angler fish (Family Ceratiidae)\n\nHave a bioluminescent lure protruding from their head to attract prey.\n\nShow extreme sexual dimorphism – Difference in size/appearance between the sexes. Males are ~40x smaller.\n\nSince finding mates can be hard in the deep sea, females release pheromones, which attract males.\n\nWhen a male finds a female – they bite onto the female, digest part of their own face to become permanently attached.\n\nAs time goes on, the male loses organ systems and even their brain, and basically become a growth on the female.\n\nBut, the gonads continue producing sperm and give females a constant supply of sperm for reproduction in a challenging environment!\n\nAngler fish reproduction\n\nExtra questions:\n\n1. Compare and contrast the three classes of fishes.\n\n2. What do you think is the next logical step in evolution for Subclass Sarcopterygii? Justify your answer.\n\n3. Explain how bony fish maintain and control their buoyancy. How does this differ from cartilaginous fish (class Chondrichthyes)?\n\n4. What are the three characteristics shared by all fish?\n\n5. Compare fins in subclass Actinopterygii to Sarcopterygii.\n\n6. What does it mean to be hermaphroditic? Can you find an example of a bony fish that is a hermaphrodite?\n\n7. Outline the difference between homocercal and heterocercal caudal fins.\n\nshaun pletsch\n\nFebruary 2, 2017\n\nBiology 11\n\nPrevious post\n\nClass Chondrichthyes\n\nNext post\n\n2.6 DNA Structure\n\nshaun pletsch\n\nAdministrator"
