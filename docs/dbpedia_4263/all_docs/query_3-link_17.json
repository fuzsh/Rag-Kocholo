        "text": "Annotated classification\n\ninfish inClassification\n\nThe following classification has been derived primarily from the works of British ichthyologists C. Patterson, R. Miles, P.H. Greenwood, and K.S. Thomson and American ichthyologist D.E. Rosen, with extensive modifications from American ichthyologists G.D. Johnson, W.N. Eschmeyer, M.L.J. Stiassny, L.R. Parenti, S.V. Frank, and W.L. Fink and Canadian ichthyologist J.S. Nelson, among others. Fishes are typically divided into three groups: superclass Agnatha (jawless fishes), class Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes), and superclass Osteichthyes (bony fishes). The latter two groups are included within the infraphylum Gnathostomata, a category containing all jawed vertebrates.\n\nSuperclass Agnatha (jawless fishes)\n\nVertebrates with a suctorial or filter-feeding mouth; no true jaws; 2 (possibly 1 sometimes) semicircular canals; pelvic fins lacking; pectoral finlike structures, when present, lacking fin rays; persistent notochord, without bone or cartilage; bony skeleton, when present, formed in skin; true gill arches absent, gill basket present. Habitat of fossil groups uncertain; earliest probably in fresh water. About 113 living species.\n\nClass Myxini\n\nOrder Myxiniformes (hagfishes)\n\nWithout dermal ossification of any sort; pectoral appendages absent; eyes poorly developed; 1–16 pairs of external gill openings; tail more or less diphycercal. Primarily bottom-dwelling fishes, but suctorial, rasping and feeding on flesh of dead or dying fishes; horny teeth present. Length about 15–110 cm (roughly 6–43 inches). About 70 species. Marine. Pennsylvanian to present.\n\nClass Cephalaspidomorphi (Monorhina)\n\nOrder Petromyzontiformes (lampreys)\n\nWithout dermal ossification of any sort; pectoral appendages absent; eyes more or less lateral or dorsal; 7 pairs of external gill openings; tail more or less diphycercal. Primarily bottom-dwelling fishes, but suctorial, feeding on blood and juices of live fishes; horny teeth present. Species are either parasitic or nonparasitic. Length about 15–100 cm (roughly 6–39 inches). About 43 species. Freshwater and marine, breeding in fresh water. Pennsylvanian and present.\n\nClass Chondrichthyes (or Selachii) (cartilaginous fishes)\n\nCartilaginous fishes. Lacks true bone (except in the roots of teeth). Gill clefts: 5–7 in Selachii, 5 gill openings occur on the lower surface of Batoidei, and only 1 in Chimaeriformes. Dorsal fin, fins, and fin spines rigid, not erectile, if present. Approximately 940 species.\n\nSubclass Elasmobranchii\n\nChondrichthians with 5–7 pairs of gill clefts not covered by a fold of skin, opening separately to the exterior.\n\nOrder Selachii (sharks)\n\nElasmobranchs with gill clefts opening at least partly on the side of the body. More than 400 species.\n\nOrder Batoidei (rays, sawfishes, guitarfishes, skates, and stingrays)\n\n5 gill openings, wholly on ventral surface; pectoral fins united with sides of head forward past the gill opening. Differ from all sharks in lacking upper free eyelid. More than 500 species. Jurassic to present.\n\nSubclass Holocephali\n\nJaws holostylic (the palatoquadrate) supporting the upper jaw completely fused to cranium; hyoid arch complete, unmodified; branchial arches below cranium; internal skeleton of cartilage, often calcified but never of bone; dermal skeleton of dentine or dentinelike tissue (placoid scales), never with true bone; scales do not continue to grow once fully formed; pelvic and cephalic claspers in males of some groups. About 40 species.\n\nOrder Chimaeriformes (chimaeras)\n\nTeeth in a single series of a few tooth plates along each jaw ramus (half); pectoral with 2, and pelvic fins with 1 basal element; pelvic fin claspers present; dermal armour frequently present on head; primitive forms with placoid scales covering body, lost in certain advanced forms; scales specialized in some; dorsal fin spine present or absent; cephalic clasper present in some. Marine. Late Devonian to present.\n\nSuperclass Osteichthyes (bony fishes)\n\nClass Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes)\n\nFins supported by rays of dermal bone rather than by cartilage. A group of jawed fishes so diverse that no single definition for them can be derived; better understood by determining the distinctive characters of the primitive members and then tracing their various lines of evolution. Primitive actinopterygians can be separated from the sarcopterygians by the following characteristics: scales ganoid; single dorsal fin; pectoral fins with a series of thin radial bones, rather than basal plates and fleshy lobes; no internal nares. Other important characters: skeleton usually well ossified; scales grow throughout life; swim bladder present (occasionally modified to a lunglike structure). More than 27,000 living species.\n\nSubclass Chondrostei\n\nA mixed group that has undergone many evolutionary diversifications. The remaining orders of the Chondrostei are specialized, often for special habitats and ways of life, but many of the groups show trends toward the holostean level of organization, especially in median fin structure and the development of hemiheterocercal tail, in which externally at least the tail appears nearly homocercal. About 40 living species.\n\nOrder Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes)\n\nAlmost no internal ossification; scales as large scutes in isolated rows (Acipenseridae); snout enlarged and tactile (Polyodontidae); median fins chondrostean in having more fin rays than basal elements; tail heterocercal. Length (sturgeons) up to 6 metres (roughly 20 feet), weight to 3,200 kg (roughly 7,000 pounds). Marine and freshwater, bottom suctorial feeders (sturgeons, Acipenseridae; Europe, Asia, North America) carnivores and plankton feeders (paddlefishes, Polyodontidae; China and North America). Middle Jurassic to present.\n\nOrder Polypteriformes (bichirs and reedfish)\n\nRelationships controversial, placed in own subclass by some and thought related to crossopterygians by others. Typical chondrostean characters, such as ganoid scales and a paleoniscoid type of preopercle. Fins modified into long continuous dorsal, tail diphycercal. Freshwater, Africa. Late Cretaceous to present.\n\nInfraclass Holostei\n\nParaphyletic group. Tail hemiheterocercal; maxillary scale free of preopercle; rays of median fins about equal basal elements in number; spiracle lost; vertebral column tended to increasing ossification; trend toward thinning scales and loss of ganoid layer. Preoperculum intimately bound to and supporting the posterior border of the palate. About 8 species.\n\nOrder Amiiformes (bowfins and fossil relatives)\n\nRelatively conservative holosteans with typical holostean characters as given above; some specialized in body shape (elongate); most typical fusiform holosteans. 1 living member of the family Amiidae, with 1 species, Amia calva (bowfin), of North America. Marine and freshwater, almost worldwide. Middle Jurassic to present.\n\nOrder Semionotiformes (gar and fossil relatives)\n\n3 (2 extinct and 1 living) families of widely divergent fishes; probably independent of the Amiiformes but with typical holostean characters; length to about 3 metres (roughly 10 feet). Late Permian to present.\n\nInfraclass Teleostei (advanced bony fishes)\n\nTail homocercal; caudal skeleton with perichordally (around the spinal cord) ossified centra; neural arches modified into elongate uroneurals extending forward onto the preural centra, “stiffening” the joints between the terminal 4 or 5 vertebrae. 2 hypural bones supporting the lower caudal fin lobe. Teleosts never have ganoid scales; typically, their scales when present are thin, overlapping plates of bone that continue to grow throughout life; their lower jaws lack certain bones found in many chondrosteans or at least have some of these bones fused to single elements. 26,840 living species.\n\nSuperorder Osteoglossomorpha\n\nOrder Osteoglossiformes (bonytongues, freshwater butterfly fishes, mooneyes, knife fishes, mormyrs)\n\nA diverse group of freshwater fishes with a relatively primitive jaw suspension and shoulder girdle. The primary bite of the mouth between parasphenoid and tongue (basihyal and glossohyal); paired rods present, usually bony, at the base of the 2nd gill arch; no bony ethmoid commissure; no leptocephalus larvae. Some with electricity-producing organs; circumorbital bones well-developed or reduced; scales with an irregular reticulated pattern (except Pantodontidae). 6 living families. About 220 species. Freshwater, almost worldwide except extremely cold regions. Middle Cretaceous to present.\n\nSuperorder Elopomorpha\n\nA diverse group including very primitive fishes and specialized fishes such as eels and therefore difficult to define. Some primitive members with a gular plate (absent in eels), ethmoid commissure present in some forms in a dermal rostral bone (absent in many eels); a leptocephalus larva; no bone cells in scales of primitive members; pelvic fins abdominal when present. More than 740 living species.\n\nOrder Elopiformes (tarpons and ten-pounders)\n\nBody fusiform, typical fishlike shape; bone-enclosed ethmoid commissure present; roofed post-temporal fossae; primary bite a tongue-parasphenoid type. 2 families, 2 genera, and 8 species. Marine; worldwide in temperate and tropical zones. Late Jurassic to present.\n\nOrder Albuliformes (bonefishes, halosaurs, and deep-sea spiny eels)\n\nSnout enlarged; mouth small and underslung; crushing teeth on palate; single supramaxillary bone; gular plate small or absent; 6 hypural bones.

Middle Cretaceous to present.\n\nOrder Anguilliformes (eels)\n\nBody elongate; fins reduced and gill chamber modified; displaced posterior to much of head; opercular apparatus reduced; pectoral girdle free of skull; caudal and other fins often greatly reduced; bony ethmoid commissure sometimes present. Length about 15–300 cm (roughly 6–120 inches). 15 families, about 141 genera, and more than 790 species. Marine and freshwater, worldwide in temperate and tropical regions. Cretaceous to present.\n\nOrder Saccopharyngiformes (gulper eels)\n\nJaws and hyomandibular greatly elongate; caudal fin absentor rudimentary; no opercular bones, branchiostegal rays, scales, pelvic fins or ribs. 4 families, 5 genera, and about 28 species. Marine (some bathypelagic), tropical and temperate Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans.\n\nSuperorder Clupeomorpha\n\nSpecial type of ear–swim bladder connection present, consisting of a diverticulum of the swim bladder, forming bulla (cavity) within the ear capsule; head lateral line canals on operculum. A diverse group of mostly oceanic, silvery, compressed fishes, many of great commercial importance.\n\nOrder Clupeiformes (herrings, anchovies, and allies)\n\nCharacters of the superorder. More than 400 species, worldwide. Marine and freshwater, some anadromous. Early Cretaceous to present.\n\nSuperorder Ostariophysi\n\nA group of some 8,000 species, including the majority of known freshwater fishes.\n\nSeries Anotophysi\n\nOrder Gonorynchiformes (milkfish, beaked sandfishes, snake mudheads, and relatives)\n\nToothless; with epibranchial organs and a characteristic caudal skeleton. The anterior ribs and vertebrae show affinities with the superorder Ostariophysi, and the group may belong with the ostariophysans rather than with the Protacanthopterygii. Length about 10–150 cm (roughly 4–60 inches). 4 families, about 37 species. Marine of Indo-Pacific and freshwater of Africa. Cretaceous to present.\n\nSeries Otophysi\n\nCharacterized by possession of a complex Weberian apparatus (a swim bladder–internal ear connection with 4 movable bones).\n\nOrder Characiformes\n\nMouth not protractile; jaws toothed. Characidae most generalized; other families have specialized skeletal structures, jaws, and teeth. North, Central, and South America, and Africa. 18 families with about 270 genera and nearly 1,700 species. Cretaceous (about 112 million years ago) to present.\n\nOrder Cypriniformes (carps and minnows)\n\nPharyngeal teeth, mouth toothless, protractile. Adipose fin rarely present. About 3,270 species. A few North Asian forms enter the sea. Worldwide in fresh water except South America, Antarctica and Australia. Paleocene to present.\n\nOrder Siluriformes (catfishes)\n\nParietal, symplectic, suboperculum, and true scales absent; often with dermal plates or little bony spines in the skin. Fusion of the supportive parts of the Weberian apparatus extensive. About 30 families. Distribution of the superorder primarily freshwater but some families marine, with the majority of the 2,867 species in Africa and South America. Paleocene to present.\n\nOrder Gymnotiformes (knifefishes, gymnotid and electric eels)\n\nBody elongated; anal fin very long; electric organs present, some extraordinarily powerful.

All marine except for about 5 species in the family Bythitidae, which are limited to fresh or brackish water.\n\nSuperorder Acanthopterygii (spiny-rayed fishes)\n\nSpiny fins usually emphasized, rather than reduced (as in paracanthopterygians). Mobile, protractile mouth owing to the almost universal lack of the levator mandibula superioris muscle; pectoral fin relatively higher on side of body; Baudelot’s ligament almost always attached to basicranium. The 13 orders of the superorder Acanthopterygii may be divided into 3 categories (sometimes called series) on the basis of the number of vertebrae, the condition of the fin spines, the position of the pelvic fins, and the presence or absence of ctenoid scales. The series Atherinomopha contains 3 orders, the Atheriniformes, silversides and relatives, Cyprinodontiformes, killifishes and relatives, and Beloniformes, needlefishes and relatives. The series Mugilomorpha contains 1 order, Mugiliformes, the mullets. The series Percomorpha contains the remaining 9 acanthopterygian orders.\n\nSeries Atherinomorpha\n\nTestes are a restricted spermatogonial type; egg demersal, with chorionic filaments; fin spines present or absent but frequently weak when present; vertebral number higher than 24; ctenoid scales rare; pelvic fins abdominal, subabdominal, or thoracic in position; pelvic fins may be connected to pleural rib via a ligament. Mostly small fishes (2–10 cm [roughly 1–4 inches]), but some needlefishes (Belonidae) grow to about 2 metres (about 7 feet). 3 included orders. Eocene to present.\n\nOrder Atheriniformes (silversides)\n\nShort preanal length of flexion larvae; single row of melanophores on dorsal margin of larvae; ventral face of vomer concave; long A1 muscle tendon to lacrimal; pelvic medial plate not extended to anterior end; and 2nd dorsal-fin spine flexible. 6 families, 48 genera and about 312 species. Marine and freshwater.\n\nOrder Cyprinodontiformes (killifishes and live-bearers)\n\nSymmetrical caudal skeleton with single epural mirroring autogenous parhypural; 1st pleural rib on the 2nd, rather than the 3rd vertebra. 9 families, with about 109 genera and at least 1,000 species. Freshwater and coastal marine.\n\nOrder Beloniformes (medakas, needlefishes, halfbeaks, and allies)\n\nAbsence of the interhyal bone; reduction or loss of the interarcual cartilage; a single, ventral hypohyal bone; distinctive caudal skeleton characterized by the lower caudal lobe with more principal rays than in the upper caudal lobe. 5 families, with about 36 genera and about 227 species. Marine and freshwater, worldwide.\n\nSeries Mugilomorpha\n\nOral and branchial filter-feeding mechanism; intestines muscular and extremely long; lateral line absent or highly reduced; 2 dorsal fins, the 1st spinous; pelvic fin with 1 spine and 5 rays; pelvic fin connected to postcleithrum via a ligament; ctenoid scales; 24 to 26 vertebrae.\n\nOrder Mugiliformes (mullets)\n\nDefinition as for the Series. 1 family, Mugilidae, with about 17 genera and as many as 80 species. Coastal marine and brackish or freshwater; tropical and temperate seas.\n\nSeries Percomorpha (perches and perchlike fishes)\n\nPelvic fin with 1 spine and 5 rays (or number of rays reduced); pelvic fin connected to postcleithrum or coracoid via a ligament; anterior pelvic process displaced ventrally; ctenoid scales. 9 included orders.\n\nOrder Stephanoberyciformes (whalefishes, bigscale fishes, and allies)\n\nBody roundish, skull bones extremely thin, subocular shelf absent; supramaxilla reduced or absent; uniquely modified extrascapular bone. 9 families, 28 genera, and about 75 species. Marine.\n\nOrder Beryciformes (squirrelfishes and several deep-sea fishes)\n\nSubocular shelf present or reduced; orbitosphenoid present; 5 or more soft rays in pelvic fins; Jaukbowski’s organ present (modification of the anterior portion of infraorbital and supraorbital sensory canal system). Length 5–60 cm (roughly 2–24 inches). 7 families of small to medium-sized fishes, about 30 genera with about 150 species. Marine, worldwide in tropical and temperate regions. Cretaceous to present.\n\nOrder Zeiformes (dories, boarfishes, and relatives)\n\nAnal fin with 1–4 spines; pelvic fin with 1 spine and 5–9 branched rays; caudal fin with less than 15 principal rays. Length to about 1 metre (3 feet). 6–7 families, of which the dories, Zeidae, are best known. About 17 genera and about 38 species. Marine, deep-sea, widespread. Early Eocene to present.\n\nOrder Gasterosteiformes (sticklebacks, tubesnout fish, and seahorses)\n\nFrequently with strong spines in dorsal and pelvic fins, spines absent in some; snout often elongated; body often with dermal plates. 11 families. Length about 2–200 cm (0.8–79 inches). 11 families, 374 species. Marine and freshwater, widely distributed. Eocene to present.\n\nOrder Synbranchiformes (swamp eels and spiny eels)\n\nFins reduced, fin spines absent, pharynx modified for breathing air in swamp eels. Length 20 to about 70 cm (roughly 8 to 28 inches). 3 families, about 100 species. Largely restricted to fresh water, in tropics. No fossil record.\n\nOrder Scorpaeniformes (scorpionfishes, sculpins, flying gurnards, and relatives)\n\nA complex group of widely divergent fishes that may be polyphyletic and is difficult to characterize. 3 groups may be recognized: scorpaenoid, hexagramoid-cottoid, and anoplopomatoid. United as an order because of a distinctive caudal skeleton and a bony process connecting the 3rd orbital with the preoperculum in most members. Some members with external bony plates. About 26 families, nearly 1,500 species. Primarily marine, some freshwater, in tropical and temperate regions. Eocene to present.\n\nOrder Perciformes\n\nFins usually with spines; pelvic fin with 1 spine and not more than 5 rays, usually below pectoral fins; caudal fin with 15 rays; no orbitosphenoid, mesocoracoid, or intermuscular bones. An extremely varied assemblage of fishes, with a variety of body plans and other adaptations. Size shows broad range; adult length from about 1 cm (less than 0.5 inch) in certain gobies to about 4.8 metres (16 feet) in swordfish); weight to about 900 kg (roughly 2000 pounds). About 10,000 species in some 160 families in 20 suborders. Mostly marine, worldwide. Late Cretaceous to present.\n\nOrder Pleuronectiformes (flounders, soles, halibuts, and other flatfishes)\n\nBoth eyes on same side of head, skull twisted and asymmetrical, fins usually without spines. 7 families include flounders, soles, and halibuts. 14 families with about 678 species. Mostly marine; bottom fishes, worldwide in tropical and temperate regions. Eocene to present.\n\nOrder Tetraodontiformes (pufferfishes)\n\nWith a beaklike snout, gill opening restricted to a small opening. 9 families, about 357 species. Marine, occasionally freshwater, worldwide in tropics and subtropics. Eocene to present.\n\nClass Sarcopterygii (fleshy-finned fishes)\n\nPrimitive members have heterocercal tail fin with a small amount of fin development above the vertebral column at the posterior end of the tail fin; 2 dorsal fins present; pectoral fins an archipterygium of variable form (an axial median support with side branches); cosmoid scales present, similar to that in acanthodians. Modern freshwater forms have lungs; presumably present in fossil freshwater forms also. Scales grow throughout life of the individual. The internal nares of the Crossopterygii and the Dipnoi may or may not have the same origin. 2 orders.\n\nSubclass Coelacanthimorpha (Crossopterygii)\n\nOrder Coelacanthiformes (coelacanths and fossil relatives)\n\nCranium divided into 2 parts (anterior and posterior) at region for exit of the 5th cranial nerve, these parts movable on each other; choanae (internal nares) present (lost in coelacanths); teeth labyrinthodont (that is, with complicated unfoldings of the enamel surface). Length of coelacanths to about 2 metres (roughly 7 feet). Mostly marine, including the so-called living fossil, Latimeria chalumnae, from South Africa, and L. menadoensis, from Indonesia, both of which lack lungs. Early forms emerged from the Early Devonian to Early Permian in mostly shallow freshwater areas and are thought to have given rise to terrestrial vertebrates during the Devonian.\n\nSubclass Dipnoi (lungfishes)\n\nCranium not divided into movable parts; teeth on upper jaw early, reduced and lost in later members; pterygoid bones with fused teeth in plates modified for eating mollusks and other organisms. Length 60–200 cm (roughly 24–80 inches). 3 surviving types, 1 each in Australia, Africa, and South America. Early Devonian to present.\n\nOrder Ceratodontiformes (Australian lungfishes)\n\n1 family, 1 genus, and 1 species.\n\nOrder Lepidosireniformes (South American and African lungfishes)\n\n2 families, 2 genera, and 5 species.\n\nCritical appraisal\n\nFish classification has undergone major revisions in recent years, and further modifications can be expected in the future. Ichthyologists frequently disagree on major as well as minor concepts of phyletic relationships. There remains much to learn about both living and fossil fishes. The geographical distribution given for a poorly known fossil group usually represents only the location of fossil finds, not necessarily the true distribution of the group.\n\nStanley H.
