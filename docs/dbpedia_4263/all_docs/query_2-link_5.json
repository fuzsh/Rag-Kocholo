REFERENCES . ; z : : 3 : 3 ; ; 19 SYANOIPSIUS) Studies of British and Swedish ceramoporid Polyzoa resulted in an emendation of the generic diagnosis of Favositella, in the recognition of two new species of this genus and of several “formae’ of the type species. The known pearl-bearing Polyzoa are referred to four species : F. interpuncta (Quenstedt), F. sgquamata (Lonsdale), F. anolotichoides sp. nov., and F. gotlandica sp.nov. The first three species are found in the Wenlock and Ludlow Series of Britain, the fourth in the Gotlandian formation of Sweden. In Britain the pearl-bearing Favositella stock ranges from the Woolhope Limestone to the Aymestry Limestone. An account is given of various morphological characters of the Ceramoporidae as exemplified by Favositella. It is suggested that the extra-macular zooecia were occupied by autozooids, and the mesopores by nanozooids. Evidence is adduced that maculae were the seat of reproductive processes, and it is suggested that they were sometimes converted into brood-chambers, the large macular zooecia having lodged gonozooids. The wide range of morphological facies exhibited by some species of Favositella, notably F. interypuncta (Quenstedt), is attributed to the varying effects of different environmental factors on the development of the zoarium. To express differences of this order a number of formae are established. I. INTRODUCTION PRELIMINARY Studies of the Polyzoa of the Wenlock Limestone showed that a number of Ceramoporidae contained pearl-like phosphatic calculi which had been formed during life, sometimes around “brown bodies’, and occasionally embalming the secondary embryo of a polypide (Pl. 1, fig. r). That these phosphatic “ pearls ”’ were formed most commonly in species of the genus Favositella at a time when this genus was approaching extinction suggested that they represented a physiological defect to which members of this stock were prone. The structure, mineralogy, and mode of occurrence of calculi in Favositella have already been described in detail, and the probable biochemical factors involved in the deposition of phosphate in coelomic fluid analysed as far as possible (Oakley 1934). There remained the need to publish a systematic account of the species of Favositella found to contain calculi. GEOL. 14, I I 4 SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA Professor N. Spjeldnaes (Copenhagen) informed the author (personal communica- tion, 1951) that he had found similar but smaller phosphatic calculi in old (gerontic?) individuals of a few non-ceramoporoid Polyzoa (e.g. in an Ordovician species of the trepostome Dianulites, and in a Gotlandian species of the cryptostome Ptilodictya). He confirmed the author’s observations regarding optical properties and chemical composition of polyzoan calculi and fully agreed that the deposition of phosphatic matter was probably a sign of degeneration. Professor Spjeldnaes added the interesting observation that to a vertebrate palaeontologist the phosphatic calculi of Polyzoa are practically like globular calcified cartilage. it, SYSTEMATIC POSITION AND MORPHOLOGY (OR FA VOSi i yee EA Order CYCLOSTOMATA Busk Suborder CERAMOPOROIDEA Bassler Family CERAMOPORIDAE Ulrich Genus FAVOSITELLA Etheridge & Foord 1884: 472 1893 Bythotrypa Ulrich : 324. Type Species (by monotypy) Favosites interpunctus Quenstedt 1878. The genus Favositella was established by Etheridge & Foord on the basis of a determination of the internal characters of Favosites interpunctus Quenstedt from the Wenlock Limestone of Dudley. Owing to the supposed relationships of this genus with Favosites it was for long regarded as a tabulate coral, but Bassler’s re-investiga- tion of topotype material (191I : 100) showed that the type species was actually a polyzoan belonging to the generic group for which Ulrich had proposed the name Bythotrypa, a genus erected to include ceramoporoids with loosely constructed interzooecial tissue formed by irregular mesopores. Bassler showed that it was possible to apply Ulrich’s definition of Bythotrypa to the type species of Favositella without modification. It is as follows : “ Zoaria massive or lamellate. Zooecia forming long continuous tubes, intersected by thin diaphragms, their walls minutely crenulate and with the structure characterizing the ceramoporoids. Lunarium well defined, large, projecting above the rest of the aperture margin. Mesopores numerous, open at the surface, interiorly forming a species of vesicular tissue unusually loose and irregular in construction.” Progress in the study of ceramoporoid Polyzoa has necessitated from time to time a widening of the bases of distinction of the various genera, and Favositella has proved no exception to this trend. In the course of the present work further species of Favositella have been brought to light, and a study of these based on a large amount of material has indicated the necessity of minor modifications of the generic diagnosis. Thus the zoarium may be free or encrusting. In thin, laminate forms the mesopores are so short that there is no more than a tendency for them to form the loose vesicular tissue which characterises the genus. Relatively large, irregular SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA 5 pores in the zooecial walls, although not invariably present, are sufficiently common to serve as a useful guide in recognizing species. The lunarium in one newly- described species contains acanthopore-like granules. EMENDED DIAGNOSIS. Zoaria massive or lamellate, encrusting or free. Zooecia forming tubes of variable length, usually long, intersected by thin diaphragms, their walls minutely crenulate and structure characteristic of ceramoporoids. Large mural pores commonly present. Lunarium well-defined, usually large and pro- jecting above rest of apertural margin. Mesopores numerous, open at the surface, interiorly tending to production of species of vesicular tissue unusually loose and irregular in construction. The characters of the family are well exhibited by Favositella. Externally the main distinguishing feature of the Ceramoporidae is the elevation of the frontal margin of the zooecial aperture into a hood-like structure known as the lunarium. When typically developed this accentuates any obliquity which the zooecial apertures may have, and gives an imbricate appearance to the celluliferous surface. The lunarium is usually crescentic in cross-section. Its position on the frontal side of the zooecium—the side on which the aperture of the zooid is situated in the living polyzoan—suggests that it may have had a protective function. It is formed of auxiliary ectocyst and originates as a lining of the frontal notch of the zooecium, which corresponds with the sinuation characteristic of the aperture of many Cheilo- stomes. While a reinforcement of the frontal margin of the zooecial aperture is not an uncommon feature in Polyzoa, the elevation of the thickened portion as a hood- like structure is a feature mainly characteristic of certain Palaeozoic groups. The lunarium is found with modifications in both families of the Ceramoporoidea (Ceramoporidae, Fistuliporidae) and also in one family of Cryptostomata (Cystodicty- onidae). There is one Jurassic cyclostomatome, Chilopora guernoni Haime, in which the zooecia have raised zooecial lips indistinguishable from the lunaria of Palaeozoic ceramporoids (Haime 1854, pl. 10, fig. 50). The ectocyst in the Ceramoporoidea has a very distinctive character. In highly magnified thin-sections it exhibits a finely laminated structure and, at the same time, a clouded or minutely granulated appearance. It is thus easily distinguishable from the uniformly hyaline primary ectocyst of the Trepostomata. Whereas in the latter the ectocyst appears to consist of crystalline calcite, in the Ceramoporoidea (and probably in all Cyclostomata) it is not only minutely porous, but apparently com- posed of intimately connected, sub-microscopic fibres, perhaps originally embedded in a corneous ground-mass. The fracture of a ceramoporoid zoarium is very different from that of a trepostome. On breaking a trepostome the walls of adjacent zooecia part cleanly down the middle; the fracture has thus a clean-cut appearance. On the other hand, when a ceramo- poroid polyzoan, or for that matter any fossil cyclostome, is broken open, the fracture passes through and across walls without discrimination, and the broken surface appears dulland amorphous. The two styles of fracture are a reflexion of the histological differences between the two groups. In trepostomes the ectocyst is crystalline, Furthermore, the zooecial walls are duplex in origin so that a median 6 SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA plane of weakness exists between the ectocyst of contiguous zooecia. The amor- phous style of fracture in ceramoporoids is an outcome of the intimately connected, perhaps felted, structure of the zooecial walls and the resulting absence of a median plane of weakness. In Favositella the primary ectocyst is sometimes invested by auxiliary ectocyst. The secondary ectocyst lining the frontal end of the zooecial aperture, and con- stituting the lunarium, is distinguished from the rest of the zooecial wall by its lighter colour. In common with those of most Ceramoporoidea the zoaria of Favositella exhibit an internal polymorphism. That is to say two types of ‘cell’ are present: zooecia, and interstitial ‘ cells’, or mesopores. On the analogy of Recent Cyclostomata it may be assumed that the majority of the zooecia were occupied by normal polyzoan individuals, or antozooids (Borg 1926: 188), and the mesopores by modified indi- viduals, or heterozooids (i.e. nanozooids or kenozooids). An observation made in the course of the present work on Favositella tends to suggest that the mesopores were occupied by nanozooids rather than by kenozooids ; that is by zooids in which there was a simplified, but nevertheless functional, polypide. I refer to the occasional presence of dahllite calculi within the mesopores of Favositella. Since these pearls are believed to be the indirect result of polypide-degeneration, they are unlikely to have originated in closed ‘cells’ occupied only by kenozooids (the extreme modi- fication of zooid in which all functional organs have disappeared). A striking feature of Ceramoporoidea (but one which they share with other Palaeo- zoic Polyzoa, notably the Trepostomata) is the grouping of the zooecia about regu- larly spaced centres composed of modified ‘cells’. These centres are termed maculae. They consist of concentrations of mesopores, usually interspersed with, or surrounded by, zooecia larger than the average and thus falling into the category of topomorphs (Lang 1906: 66). The maculae may be level with the general surface of the zoarium, but they are more commonly either slightly depressed or slightly raised (in which case they are known as monticules). It would seem that the maculae were, in the first place, centres of growth. Thus the simple discoidal zoaria of Ceramopora imbricata Hall are made up of a central macula from which the zooecia radiate towards the growing edge (Bassler 1906 : 19). Similarly in more complex zoaria the frontal, or lunariate, ends of all zooecial aper- tures proximate toa macula. It is probable that in a mature zoarium the mesopore and enlarged zooecia in the maculae took on functions connected with reproductive processes. Ulrich has already suggested (1890 : 298) that the larger zooecia in or surrounding maculae served as the receptacles in which embryos were developed into the larval stage. He compares them with the genoecia of the Recent genus Cvisia, which are merely slightly modified zooecia set aside for reproductive functions. Zooids adapted and transformed for the production of embryos have been termed gonozooids by Borg (1926: 188). The heterozooids which are believed to have occupied the mesopores may have served a protective function. In the course of investigating the Silurian species of Favositella a number of observations have been made which support the idea that the maculae were, at any SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA 7 rate at a certain stage in astogeny, the seat of reproductive processes. It has been noted that openings in the walls of zooecia and mesopores are most frequent in the maculae, while in a few mature zoaria of Favositella interpuncta the maculae are found to have been converted into moderately deep, stellate, or circular pits, open at the surface. These were first described by Quenstedt (1878 : 10, pl. 143, fig. gy ; “ Sterngruben ’) who seems to have regarded them as either pathological or due to damage during the life of the organism. It appears, however, that they have origin- ated through the coalescence of the mesopores and zooecia in the maculae by the breaking-down, or resorption, of their walls. These pits (Pl. 3, fig. 6; Pl. 9, fig. 6) are so strikingly similar to the ‘ brood-chambers’ observed in certain Recent Heteroporidae (Borg 1933 : 267, pl. 2, figs. 1, 4) that they may have served the same function. It is not improbable, on the analogy of Recent forms, that in the breeding season the walls of the mesopores and large zooecia in the maculae were partially resorbed, and that the developing embryos were discharged into the central space so formed, there to undergo larval development. However, further work on this aspect of the Ceramoporidae is required before this interpretation can be credited with any degree of certainty. III. DESCRIPTION OF PEARL-BEARING SPECIES Favositella interpuncta (Quenstedt) (Px, fies. 1-6; Pl. 2, figs. 1-3,6,7; Pl. 3, figs. 4-6; PI. 4, figs. 1-6; Pl. 6, figs. 1=5 ; Pin7 ics ua.

The specimen figured by Edwards & Haime (1855) as an immature form of their Chaetetes (Monticulipora?) bowerbanki has been found on examination to be identical with the polyzoan described below as Favositella interpuncta forma texturata. As this specimen (now preserved in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge: A4024) is one of the syntypes of Chaetetes (Monticulipora?) bowerbanki, that name must be included in the synonymy of Favositella interpuncta. However, it is clear that Edwards & Haime mainly based their diagnosis of C. bowerbanki on specimens such as the other syntype figured by them (1855: pl. 63, fig. ra). Since this specimen is a coral referable to the genus Favosites, it is convenient to restrict the name bowerbanki to forms agreeing with the anthozoan syntype, and to reject it as a name for the polyzoan on the grounds of its being a homonym. 8 SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA LECTOTYPE (here chosen). Specimen from the Wenlock Limestone of Dudley figured by Quenstedt (1878 : pl. 143, fig. 9). Preserved in the Museum of the Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at Tiibingen, Germany. This is almost certainly the type since it is the only specimen preserved in the Quenstedt Collection. DEscRIPTION (Pl. 2, figs. 1, 6; Pl. 8, figs. 1, 4). Free, roughly campanulate zoarium with spreading margins. Total height 31 mm. ; maximum diameter 47 mm. Actual thickness averages 7 mm., but locally this is exceeded owing to the super- position of two or more layers of zooecia. The deeply concave inferior surface is covered by a thin, coarsely wrinkled epitheca or epizoarial membrane ; where this is worn the nearly prostrate bases of the zooecia tend to show through (PI. 2, fig. 6). The celluliferous surface is moderately smooth. Over the greater part of the surface the zooecial tubes have relatively thick walls and in outline are mainly rounded polygons (Pl. 8, fig. 1). There are 4 to 5 of these zooecial openings in an interval of 2mm. The lunaria are represented by inconspicuous slightly raised thickenings of the frontal angle. In one area of the zoarial surface (Pl. 8, fig. 4) the zooecia are thin-walled and more quadrangular in outline, while the lunaria are thin, hood-like structures occupying the frontal fourth of the zooecial margin. Open mesopores are moderately frequent ; the majority are small and circular, and occur mainly at the angles of junction of the zooecia. They are more abundant in some areas than in others. Maculae are well developed and arranged roughly quincuncially ; the average distance separating their centres is 5 mm. They show no tendency to become monticules. Two types, or phases, can be recognized amongst the maculae. The first type, which occurs in areas where the zooecial walls are thick and the lunaria inconspicuous, is characterized by an abundance of small circular mesopores scattered amongst zooecia which are slightly larger than average. There is a tendency for the walls of the zooecia and mesopores to break down in the centre of such maculae, resulting in the formation of the stellate pits noted by Quenstedt, and now regarded as brood-chambers (p. 7). The second type of macula is associated with the other surface phase, characterized by thin-walled zooecia and conspicuously developed hood-like lunaria. Such maculae consist of a ring of large zooecia, with overarching, lunarial hoods, enclosing an irregularly-shaped area occupied by a cluster of large, thin-walled mesopores which seem to form a species of open vesicular tissue. The exposed surfaces of the adjacent lunarial hoods are marked by a series of fine lines which converge upwards and appear to be continuations of the walls of the mesopores on which the lunaria impinge. Internal characters may be deduced from topotypes (see p. 10). VARIATION IN EXTERNAL CHARACTERS. Examination of a large number of specimens of I’. interpuncta has shown that the external variation in this species is very great, and it is found convenient to recognize a number of formae (see p. I3). Forma typica (PI. 1, figs. 4-6; Pl. 2, figs. 2,3; Pl. 3, fig. 6; Pl. 4, figs. 1,55 PL 6; figs. 3-5, Pl. 9, fig. 6). Zoaria tumular, with well-defined circular or elongate-oval outlines. Commonly such zoaria commenced their growth on some bulbous foreign body, such as a large gastropod shell, but eventually extended beyond it, so that SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA 9 when fully developed their margins were free epithecated expansions (PI. 1, fig. 4). As observed by Etheridge & Foord, the form of the shell or other foreign body to which this species became attached frequently determined the external form assumed by the zoarium. This is illustrated by a specimen in the Holcroft Collection at Birmingham University (Pl. 1, figs. 4,5). This polyzoan commenced growth on the side of a large Loxonema, with the result that the zoarium is broader and higher at one end than at the other and has the general form of a drumlin. Some campanulate, or tumular zoaria appear to have commenced growth on a knot of hardened mud on the sea-floor. In such specimens the base is deeply concave. While the total height of these tumular zoaria may be as much as 50 mm., the zoarial thickness rarely exceeds 7 mm., either on account of the space occupied by the ‘host’ or by reason of their actual concavity (see Pl. 2, fig.2). Where the zoarial thick- ness exceeds about 7 mm. there has usually been reduplication of the zooecial layers. In forma typica, zoaria range in size from small bun-shaped colonies measuring 30 mm. in diameter and 12 mm. in height (e.g. B.M. N.H., D.33918) to large tumular masses 90 mm. in length, 60 mm. in width and 30 mm., or more, in height. The zooecial apertures are relatively thick-walled and present the form of rounded polygons. Lunaria are inconspicuous, usually little more than blunt processes. Thin-walled quadrangular zooecia, with prominent cowl-like lunaria, are only present when there has been new growth. This type of surface is regarded as constituting a distinct forma (see last paragraph below). Mesopores are small and scattered, and have the appearance of pin-pricks in the thickened angles of junction of the zooecial walls. Typically the maculae are inconspicuous (cf. first type in lectotype), but in some zoaria they are raised into low monticules (Pl. 1, fig. 6). Occasionally the zooecia and mesopores in the maculae have become confluent through break-down of the walls, thus giving rise to con- spicuous pits which in all probability served as brood-chambers (see p. 7 and Pl. 3, fig. 6; Pl. 9, fig. 6). Banna byeupora (Pl-2; fig. 7; Pl. 4, figs. 2, 6; Pl. 6, figs. 1, 2; Pl. 9, fig. 7). This forma is typically exhibited by thin zoaria encrusting the surface of smooth- shelled brachiopods such as Meristina tumida (Dalman), and more rarely tumid gastropods such as Poleumita globosa (Schlotheim). The thickness of the zoarium is normally 2-3 mm.; the surface is remarkably smooth and maculae are incon- spicuous. The zooecial walls are thickened distally with the result that the apertures are sub-polygonal or rounded. Small circular mesopores, occurring at the zooecial angles, are relatively abundant, particularly in the maculae. A local tendency to linear arrangement of the zooecia is occasionally noticeable. Bomna textuvata (Pln3; fig) 5); Pl. 4, fig. 4; Pl. 7, fig. 2; Pl. 8, fig. 3). This facies is also typically expressed when the whole zoarium is a thin encrusting sheet, as on smooth-shelled brachiopods such as Meristina tumida (Dalman), or Gypidula galeata (Dalman). Over the whole surface the zooecial apertures are arranged in a regular lace-like pattern, a dominant feature of which is the occurrence of sharply defined star-like maculae in quincunx. Each macula consists of an irregular ring of five or six large zooecia with prominent, usually finely ribbed, lunarial hoods which GEOL. 14, I. 2 10 SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA face away from a slightly depressed area of thin-walled, angular mesopores. The bases of the lunarial hoods of the large zooecia occupy about a third of the whole circumference of the zooecial aperture. The zooecia outside the maculae are thin-walled and mainly quadrangular. They are slightly larger than in the forma typica, there being 3 to 4 in an interval of 2 mm. They have small but prominent lunaria, the frontal or external surface of which is rounded and sometimes marked by fine ribs converging upwards. Mesopores are almost entirely confined to the maculae. All zooecia are oriented with respect to some macula. The intersection of the zones of propagation of the several maculae has resulted in the surface being divided up into variously shaped sectors, within each of which the lunarial hoods have the same direction, and across the boundaries of which the orientation of the zooecia changes. Within each sector of constant orientation the zooecia consequently have a very characteristic appearance (rather like that of a net pulled from various centres) which is markedly different from that of the forma tyfica. Nevertheless, the fact that areas of new growth in typical zoaria closely approximate to the texturata condition (see p. 13, and PI. 8, fig. 4), is proof that this form is largely transitory. Forma irregularis (Pl. 4, fig. 3; Pl. 7, fig. 1). Zoaria forming irregular crusts on the surface of gastropods, corals and brachiopods. The zoarium usually has a very uneven surface, and varies in thickness from 2mm. to 10mm. The character of the surface shows an irregular transition from that of forma typica to that of forma texturata. The two types of surface-character are so intimately mixed that the zoaria have a distinctive appearance. Maculae are unevenly distributed, and very variable in structure, although the type associated with the pure ¢exturata condition predominates. There are on the average 4 zooecial apertures in 2 mm. Forma intermedia (PI. 3, fig. 4) only differs from zvvegularis in mode of origin of the zooecial irregularity (see p. 4). DESCRIPTION OF INTERNAL CHARACTERS. These have been studied in topotype material. Forma typica (Pl. 4, figs. 1, 5; Pl. 6, figs. 3-5). In tangential sections (PI. 4, figs. I, 5) the majority of the zooecia appear as irregularly rounded polygons with an average diameter of 0-4 mm. Such zooecia have an indistinct lunarium occupying a notch in the frontal margin. The zooecial walls in the mature zone of a typical zoarium are relatively thick (civca 0:05 mm.), and are formed of coarsely lamellar, crypto-fibrous tissue. The lunaria are formed of more pellucid tissue. Sporadic breaks can be observed in the zooecial walls and indicate the occurrence of large mural pores. Mesopores appear as rounded or oval spaces 0-Imm. to 0-2 mm. in diameter, and occur at the angles of junction of the zooecial walls. They are noticeably more abundant in the maculae. The occurrence of areas in which the zooecia show linear arrangement, sub-ovate, quadrangular, or subtriangular outlines, and more distinct, pointed lunaria, indicates that the section has passed into an immature zone in which there is an approach to the texturata condition. SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA II In deeper transverse sections through the mature region the zooecia and mesopores have thinner walls and appear more angular in outline ; irregularly pentagonal and sub-triangular outlines predominate amongst the zooecia. In macular areas the zooecia show elongate outlines with a longer axis measuring as much as 0-6 mm. Breaks in the walls are relatively common and lead occasionally to meandrine zooecial spaces. The lunaria are inconspicuous, each being represented by a small triangular patch of light-coloured tissue in the frontal angle of the zooecium. Transverse sections through the sub-ephebic levels show rather quadrangular zooecia arranged in diagonal rows, recalling the ¢extwrata condition fully described below. Vertical sections through typical zoaria (Pl. 1, fig. 3; Pl. 6, figs. 3-5) show one to three layers of zooecia varying in thickness from 3 mm. to 12 mm. Each layer has a thin basal lamina. In free expansions the basal lamina of the lowest zooecial layer is coated by a thin, corrugated epithecal membrane. The zooecial tubes arise obliquely from the basal lamina (PI. 6, fig. 3), but after a short distance become more or less vertical. In the mature zone mesopores are locally intercalated between the zooecia. The walls of the zooecia are irregularly crenulate ; in sufficiently thin sections it is possible to detect small, and often rather oblique, mural pores. When a vertical section cuts a zooecial wall tangentially the ectocyst is seen to have a transversely laminated structure. The zooecial walls sometimes show oblique, upwardly directed, spine-like processes jutting into the zooecial cavity (Pl. 6, fig. 3). It is unlikely that these are comparable with the spines observed in certain trepostomes (Cumings & Galloway 1915 : 358); they more probably represent incipient mesopores. Thin diaphragms occur at intervals throughout the zooecial tubes; they are slightly convexo-concave in the upward sense, and are separated by an interval generally varying from one to two tube-diameters. Mesopores tend to be loosely vesicular in character. Their walls contract and expand in an irregular manner so as to produce a roughly moniliform effect (Pl. 1, fig. 3; Pl. 6, fig. 5). In some cases the mesopores are cut up into vesicles by oblique or transverse projections of the wall, similar to those already noted in the zooecia. Thin diaphragms occur sporadically in the mesopores. The walls of the mesopores in fully mature zoaria are thickened near the surface. Forma brevipora (Pl. 4, figs. 2,6; Pl. 6, figs. 1, 2). Tangential sections of zoaria in this condition do not differ materially from those of forma tyfica. Mesopores are variable in size and frequency. The zooecia present mainly sub-polygonal, rounded or oval outlines with an average diameter of 0:4 mm. ; lunaria are indistinct. Vertical sections show that the zooecia become erect after an abbreviated oblique phase. The essential differences from forma typica are: (i) the shortness of the mature zone ; and (ii) the simplicity of the mesopores, which are formed by a bifurca- tion of the zooecial wall, as in forma texturata. Forma texturata (Pl. 4, fig. 4; Pl. 7, fig. 2). Tangential sections bring out the marked linear arrangement of the zooecia within circumscribed sectors. The zooecia are predominantly quadrangular in outline, although some may show oval or GEOL LAs: 28 12 SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA rounded pentagonal cross-sections. They are thinner walled (average thickness, 0-035 mm.) than in forma tyfica, and vary in diameter from 0-4 mm. to 0:5 mm. The lunaria of all zooecia are sharply defined, and usually sagittate in outline (Pl. 4, fig. 4). Small rounded mesopores occur, but are almost entirely confined to the maculae. Vertical sections (PI. 7, fig. 2) are indistinguishable from those through the proximal region of forma typica. They bring out the shortness and obliquity of the zooecia typical of this form. Lunaria are difficult to distinguish in vertical sections, but are clearly direct prolongations of the frontal walls of the zooecia, lined internally with auxiliary ectocyst. Mesopores are shallow and thin-walled. Each is formed by the bifurcation of a ‘septum’ from the upward-facing, or basal surface of a zooecial wall, usually at a distance of 0-5 mm. to 1:0 mm. above the basal lamina. There is no epitheca ; the so-called basal lamina has no separate existence but is merely the common basal wall of the prostrate portions of the zooecia. Diaphragms are usually present. The zooecia vary in height from 1 mm. to 3 mm. The superposition of several layers of zooecia in the texturata condition is rare. Consequently the average thick- ness of zoaria which are wholly in this condition is 2 mm. Forma irregularis (Pl. 4, fig. 3; Pl. 7, fig. 1). Tangential sections show areas with regularly aligned, quadrangular zooecia, with distinct sagittate lunaria, which pass abruptly, or by mixture, into areas where the zooecia have rounded polygonal outlines and indistinct lunaria. Vertical sections show that this forma is associated with the irregular and local reduplication of zooecial layers ; thick layers show the characters of forma typica, thin layers those of forma texturata (cf. Pl. 7, fig. 1). STRATIGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. The earliest known example of the species is a specimen from the Lower Wenlock Shales at Buildwas, preserved in the Foord Collection at the British Museum (Natural History) (D.36318). It is in the brevipora condition, and forms an incrustation on a shell of Meristina tumida (Dal- man). Similar specimens occur in the Upper Wenlock Shales at Walsall. The species occurs in greatest abundance in the Wenlock Limestone, particularly in Staffordshire and at Rumney, near Cardiff. In common with other Ceramo- poridae it is rare in the Wenlock Limestone of Shropshire. There is a single record of the species in the Wenlock Limestone of the Woolhope area in Herefordshire (Gardiner 1927 : 323). Twenty-five per cent of all the Polyzoa recovered from the thin representative of the Wenlock Limestone exposed in the Ty Mawr Lane at Rumney proved to belong to this species!. The zoaria from this locality are all small. Most of them seem to belong to the typical forma, but the intractable ferruginous matrix with which they are encrusted makes an examination of surface features a matter of difficulty. In some specimens mesopores are very sparse (PI. 6, fig. 4). The great majority of the specimens of F’. inteypuncta preserved in old collections 1 Many of the specimens of Favositella interpuncta from Rumney are remarkably rich in pearls. There can be no doubt that the pearl-bearing specimens erroneously described by Sollas as Favosites fibrosus actually belong to this species. SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA 13 appear to have come from the shaly beds of the Wenlock Limestone at Wren’s Nest and Castle Hill, Dudley, Staffordshire. Recent collecting has shown that the horizon at which they occur in greatest abundance is in the upper part of the Middle Nodular Beds. All the described formae appear to be represented at this level. The only specimen recovered from the Lower Limestone is one in the brevipora condition from the basement beds at Walsall. One specimen of forma ivregularis from Dudley, preserved in the Sedgwick Museum (A5943), has a matrix which suggests derivation from the passage beds between the Upper Limestone and the Lower Ludlow. A small fragmentary specimen of Favositella from the Aymestry Limestone of Shucknall Hill, Woolhope, Herefordshire, in the Geological Survey & Museum (57956) appears to represent a variant of this species. REMARKS. So great is the diversity of form exhibited by Favositella interpuncta that some sort of subdivision of the species would seem to be desirable. An examina- tion of an extensive series of specimens from the Wenlock beds has indicated, how- ever, that the observed variation is continuous and not of a mutational order. The diversity of form is partly explained by the fact that different stages of astogeny are quite distinct in appearance, and partly by the marked effects on the development of this polyzoan produced by different environments. It was therefore proposed by the author (1938) that the only way of expressing the main structural facies exhibited by the species was by applying formal as distinct from varietal, names to the several forms. The differences which the form-names indicate may be in one case developmental, in another due to the effect of a special environment, and so on. However, in the present state of our knowledge of these Polyzoa it is possible to make only very tentative correlations of this sort. The forma ¢ypica seems to represent the normal form assumed by a zoarium which developed to full maturity (?gerontic stage) under constantly favourable conditions. The forma brevipora is apparently the condition of zoaria which attained maturity under constant, but unfavourable conditions. In tubular Polyzoa it would seem that the length of the zooecia is not a reflexion of the rate of deposition of sediment as it is in corals, but depends mainly on the frequency of polypide-regeneration ; this in its turn being correlated with such factors as temperature, salinity and food-supply. The forma texturvata is the one which provides the most interesting problem. Zoaria showing this forma are so different in aspect from the typical zoaria that they were for long considered as belonging to a distinct species. In fact, judging by the evidence of museum labels, they have been generally regarded, even by palaeonto- logists familiar with typical Favositella interpuncta, as representing a species of Ceramopora. The recognition of the zoaria in question as a forma of Favositella interpuncta resulted from the discovery that they showed features almost identical with those of a small portion of the celluliferous surface of the type-zoarium of that species. A close examination of the holotype and other typical specimens of F. interpuncta has shown, in fact, that wherever a new layer of zooecia has commenced to develop on the surface of a mature zoarium (i.e., wherever there has been local rejuvenation), the area of new growth shows the characters which comprise the texturata condition. 14 SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA In other words this condition is essentially that of the neanic or sub-ephebic phases of development in Favositella interpuncta. Nevertheless there are reasons for re- garding this condition as constituting in some cases a distinct forma. Complete zoaria consisting of a single layer of zooecia in the ¢extwrata condition are of common occurrence, particularly on smooth-shelled brachiopods. The well- defined maculae which they exhibit suggest that the zoaria were fertile. The probable explanation of these forms is that they represent zoaria whose development was arrested at the sub-ephebic stage owing to certain environmental conditions. The forma texturata preserves, to some extent, features of more primitive Ceramo- poroid genera such as Crepipora; for example, the restriction of mesopores to the maculae. Zoaria in which there has been a tendency for new layers of zooecia to develop at irregular intervals, and over small, limited areas, have a very irregular aspect which contrasts markedly with that of both forma typica and forma texturata. For such zoaria the term forma ivregularis was proposed in 1938. The irregular rejuvenation of the zoarial surface which tended to the production of this forma, was most probably connected with the variable character of the micro- environment. The extent to which environmental factors may have controlled growth-form in Favositella, may be gauged by the fact that 12 out of 13 specimens of F’. interpuncta recovered from a single exposure in the Wenlock Limestone proved to belong to the same forma. The bed from which they came was largely composed of current-drifted shells and corals which had been accumulated in an area adjacent to a coral reef (‘ ball-stone ’). After further work on Favositella interpuncta the author found it desirable to recognize another forma, amongst the forms grouped as forma iregularis. The additional forma, called zntermedia, is illustrated by Pl. 3, fig. 4. It differs from forma irregularis in so far as the irregularity of the surface is not due to patchy rejuvenation, but to unequal development of individual zooecia.

Fragment of flat laminate zoarium, 1:5 mm. thick; apparently encrusting the valve of a brachiopod. The fragment is 8 mm. long and 5mm. wide. The surfaceis rather worn. The zooecia are sub-erect and contiguous. Outside the raised area the zooecial apertures are thin-walled, mainly rhomboidal and arranged in intersecting, diagonal rows ; 4 to 44 apertures occur in an interval of SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA 15 2mm. In the subtriangular frontal half of the zooecium the apertural margin is elevated as a well-defined lunarium. The raised part of the zoarial surface is clearly a macula ; it is distinguished by the relatively large size of the zooecia and by the occurrence of numerous irregular mesopores. Mesopores have not been observed outside the macula. External characters. Based on study of topotype material (see Pl. 2, fig. 4; Pl. 3, fig. 2; Pl. 8, fig. 2; Pl. 9, figs. 4,5). Zoaria form thin encrusting sheets, generally on flat surfaces such as are provided by the valves of strophomenid brachiopods. The margins of the zoarium sometimes extend beyond the encrusted object. Free marginal expansions formed in this way have developed a coarsely wrinkled basal epitheca (Pl. 2, fig. 4). The surface of the zoarium is sometimes irregularly monticu- lose, but the raised areas do not invariably coincide with maculae. The zooecial apertures are subtriangular, oval or rhomboidal. In the frontal half of the zooecium the apertural margin is raised into a prominent and rather angulated lunarium, the apex of which is often slightly overarching particularly in the maculae. The external angle of the lunarium may be acute or rounded ; in the latter case it is marked by several strong rugae or ribs which converge towards the apex. There are from 4 to 5 zooecial apertures in an interval of 2mm. Maculae are well-marked and sometimes form low monticules; they are superficially similar to those in F.. interpuncta forma texturata, but usually show a more confused structure. The large zooecia in typical maculae have abnormally high, pointed lunarial hoods. Mesopores are mainly small and rounded, although larger, more angular ones occur in some of the maculae. Outside the maculae, mesopores are, for the most part, only of sporadic occurrence. A notable feature of the species is the occurrence of certain circumscribed areas, distinct from normal maculae, in which minute thick- walled mesopores are so abundant that they surround the zooecial apertures. In these areas which are of irregular distribution and usually larger than the maculae, the zooecial apertures are oval or sub-pyriform, and have low, inconspicuous lunaria (Pir s; fig. 2). Internal characters. Based on study of topotype material. Tangential sections (Pl. 5, fig. 3) show fairly regularly aligned, thin-walled zooecia, varying in outline from rhomboidal to sub-polygonal or sub-pyriform, and with an average diameter of 04mm. The frontal end of the zooecial aperture is deeply arcuate, and lined with the lighter coloured tissue of the lunarium, which varies in form from a wide crescent to a small triangle, depending on the level at which the section has been cut. The zooecial walls are composed of the finely laminated and minutely granular tissue characteristic of the genus ; they have an average thickness of 0-028 mm. Rounded or oval mesopores, ranging in diameter from 0:08 mm. to 0-I mm., are seen in localized areas. In transverse sections through the sub-distal or proximal region (Pl. 5, fig. I), the zooecia present irregularly polygonal outlines. The zooecial walls are very tenuous and tend to be somewhat flexuous. Small sub-polygonal mesopores occur mainly in the maculae. In the macular areas frequent breaks can be observed in the zooecial walls, 16 SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA Vertical sections (Pl. 7, fig. 5) : in typical zoaria there are from one to four layers of zooecia. The layers vary in thickness from 1mm. to 4mm. The zooecial tubes arise from a thin, basal lamina, which, in the case of the lowest zooecial layers in free-growing parts of a zoarium, is usually covered by a thin epitheca. The zooecial tubes normally become almost vertical after a short prostrate phase, although in some specimens they maintain an oblique course. In the peripheral region the zooecial walls become thickened and sometimes irregularly crenulate ; short and rather thick- walled mesopores are rarely more than 0:2 mm. deep. In the peripheral zone, the walls of the mesopores and the zooecia commonly develop a ragged or loosely con- structed appearance, owing to the occurrence of irregular mural pores. Diaphragms are infrequent, or absent. OccURRENCE. The species has been recorded only from the Wenlock Limestone of Dudley and Sedgeley. It occurs mainly in the upper part of the Middle Nodular Beds (for example at Wren’s Nest), and is much rarer than FP’. interpuncta. Remarks. This species is easily confused with F. interpuncta forma texturata. In both the lunaria are prominent, and in both the zoarial surface tends to be divided into sharply defined sectors within which the zooecia have a constant orientation with respect to some macula. However, F. squamata differs from F. imterpuncta forma texturata in the following respects: (i) the zooecial apertures are on the average slightly smaller and narrower ; (ii) the lunaria tend to be longer and more arcuate ; (iii) the maculae show a more confused structure ; (iv) there are circumscribed areas, apart from normal maculae, in which mesopores are abundant ; (v) the zooecial tubes are longer and more erect. The character mentioned under (iv) is an example of topomorphism. There is no doubt that specimens of F’. sguamata showing the characters described above are normal, fully mature zoaria ; whereas the superficially similar specimens of F. interpuncta forma texturata are evidently immature, or stunted zoaria.

It has also been recorded from the Wenlock Limestone of Ty Mawr Lane, Rumney, near Cardiff; and from the middle beds of the Wenlock Limestone in the Coate’s Farm Quarry, Presthope Road, near Much Wenlock, Shropshire. Description. External characters. Zoaria form moderately thick encrusting sheets on cephalopod shells, corals, stromatoporoids, and more rarely on brachiopod shells. Where the zoarium extends beyond the encrusted body, the basal surface becomes enveloped by a thin, wrinkled epitheca. The surface of the zoarium is usually somewhat uneven, but there are no definite macular elevations or depressions. The zooecia are relatively thick-walled and radiate from macular centres spaced at intervals of about 5mm. Each has a thin, horse-shoe shaped lunarium, the edges of which bear minute, acanthopore-like granules. The zooecial apertures vary in outline ; they tend to be roughly elongate-oval or sub-pyriform, but a slight con- striction of the walls at the ends of the lunarial loop gives the apertures the form of a key-hole. Locally the apertures become meandrine owing to the coalescence of some of the zooecia. Internal characters. In tangential sections (Pl. 5, figs. 2, 5) the majority of the zooecia present slightly ‘ waisted’, oval outlines, with an average major axis of 0-45 mm. and an average minor axis of0-27mm. The outlines of some zooecia appear geniculate owing to a slight declination of the axis of the lunarium relative to the axis of the anterior part of the aperture. As seen in section, the lunarium is a narrow band of light-coloured tissue, varying in form from a semi-circle to a three-quarter circle, and constituting the frontal third of the zooecial wall. In sections of well- preserved specimens it is possible to see g-12 acanthopore-like granules, or tubules, within the lunarium (PI. 5, fig. 2). These appear as pellucid spots with an average diameter of 0-02 mm. They are rather irregularly placed and their margins occa- sionally project into the zooecial cavity. The zooecial walls vary considerably in thickness ; the frontal wall, formed by the lunarium, has an average thickness of 0-025 mm., but elsewhere the walls may attain a thickness of as much as 0:05 mm. Sub-polygonal mesopores, varying in diameter from 0-I mm. to 0:3 mm., are abundant and practically surround the zooecia. Gaps in the walls of both mesopores and zooecia are common and lead locally to meandrine outlines. Vertical sections (Pl. 7, figs. 3, 4) usually reveal a single layer of zooecia ; more rarely there are two superimposed layers. The thickness of a zooecial layer varies from 2mm. to 5mm. The zooecial tubes arise from a thin basal lamina which is epithecated in the case of free-growing expansions. The zooecia pass through a brief prostrate phase and then rise vertically ; they have irregularly crenulate walls in which occasional breaks may be observed. The walls are thickened throughout the mature zone by auxiliary ectocyst. Thin diaphragms, concave upwards, occur fairly frequently, but without any regular spacing, the intervals separating them varying from one to three tube-diameters. Mesopores are intercalated between the zooecia at the point where they become vertical, and persist throughout the mature zone. They are loosely moniliform, or in some cases definitely vesicular in character 18 SOME PEARL-BEARING POLYZOA (Pl. 7, fig. 4). Diaphragms similar to those in the zooecia are usually seen in some of the mesopores. The walls of the mesopores, like those of the zooecia, are locally broken by numerous gaps, a tendency particularly marked in macular centres. The wall-tissue is less laminar and more granulated than in the two preceding species. REMARKS. This species provides an interesting problem in systematics. It differs from all previously described species of Favositella in the isolation of its zooecia by mesopore tissue and in the presence of acanthopore-like granules in its lunaria. In the first of these characters, as in its habit, it recalls species of Ceramo- porella. On the other hand, the lunarial structures as seen in tangential sections are reminiscent of the tubules found in the lunaria of the Ordovician genus Anolotichia. However, in Anolotichia the maximum number of tubules in a lunarium appears to be seven, whereas in the present form there are often as many as twelve. Further- more, in vertical section there is no indication that the tubules in this species have either the extension or the tabulated structure characteristic of those in Anolotichia. They can scarcely be regarded as tubules at all, and seem to have much more in common with the granules found in the walls of certain species of Ceramoporella (e.g. C. granulosa Ulrich 1890: 466). This fact, considered in conjunction with the abundance of the mesopores, at first suggested that the correct reference of this polyzoan was to Cevamoporella. More detailed investigation showed, however, that the zooecial walls are frequently perforated by irregular pores—a feature, which has never been observed in species of Cevamoporella. Moreover, in many specimens the mesopores are found to exhibit the loose, vesicular character generally associated with those of Favositella. These and more general considerations finally left no doubt in the author’s mind that this polyzoan was, in fact, like the commoner pearl-bearing forms, a species of Favositella, but one with a superficial resemblance to Anolotichia on the one hand, and to Ceramoporella on the other. Although there is no doubt that this polyzoan agrees more closely with Favositella than with any other known genus of Ceramoporidae, the fact that it differs from all previously described species of that genus in having acanthopore-like granules in the frontal wall of the zooecium might have been taken as sufficient reason for regarding it as the type of a new genus or sub-genus. It is considered, however, that the wiser course is to include it in Favositella, at any rate until there is more proof that such acanthopore-like granules are of phylogenetic significance. The sporadic appearance of these or similar structures in isolated species of distantly related stocks suggests that they are of no more than specific importance. For example, acantho- pore-like granules can be detected in the zooecial walls of Crepipora lunatifera Bassler (1911 : 88, fig. 27d), but have not been observed in other species of that genus. Again, analogous granules occur in the zooecial walls of some species of Ceramo- porella (e.g. C. granulosa Ulrich 1890 : 466), but not in others. Tabulated lunarial tubules fall into a different category, since they are only found in species with a number of important characters in common, and their presence is therefore justifiably taken to indicate membership of a single generic group, to which the name Anolotichia has been given.

It consists of an encrustation on a shell of Meristina tumida (Dalman). DEscrRIPTION. Zoarium thin and encrusting ; surface slightly uneven. Zooecial apertures regularly aligned, thin-walled and sharply rhomboidal in outline, with small, sharply elevated lunaria. On the average there are 4 zooeciain 2mm. The zooecial tubes are sub-erect and contiguous. Small mesopores, having the appearance of punctations, occur sporadically at wall-intersections. Maculae, although some- times slightly raised, are relatively inconspicuous ; they are mainly recognizable by the local abundance of mesopores. In sections the zooecial walls are remarkable for their uniform thinness throughout. Their average thickness is 0:02 mm. (compared with 0:05 mm. in the mature zone of F. interpuncta forma typica ; 0-035 mm. in the forma ¢extuvata of that species ; and 0-028 mm. in F’. squamata). In tangential section the zooecia show rhomboidal outlines with an average major axis of 0-6 mm., and an average minor one of 0-35 mm. in length. The frontal end of the zooecium is narrowly rounded and lined by an extremely narrow, crescentic lunarium which can only be observed in sections which pass very close to the surface. Mesopores are initially quadrangular, but their lumen has usually become rounded through the growth of auxiliary ectocyst. The vertical section shows a single zooecial layer with an average thickness of 0-7 mm. The zooecial tubes curve obliquely upwards after a brief prostrate stage. The actual apertures are sub-direct. Mesopores are simple, short, and widen upwards. Small gaps in the zooecial walls can be observed in parts of the zoarium, and indicate the presence of mural openings. Diaphragms have not been observed. RemMARKS. This species is closely related to F’. sqwamata (Lonsdale) from the Wenlock Limestone, the two resembling one another in the rhomboidal form of the zooecial apertures and in the comparative thinness of the zooecial walls. The present species is mainly distinguished from F’. squamata by the smallness of its lunaria, by the more regular shape of the zooecial apertures, and by the curving obliquity of its zooecial tubes as seen in vertical section. The horizon from which the holotype was collected is in Lindstrém’s Division c of the Gotlandian formation ; that is the Miilde-margelsten, which has been correlated by Hede (1921 : 87) with the Lower Ludlow beds of this country.

REFERENCES SYNOPSIS Twenty-nine species of Ostracoda, of which 18 are new, are described from the Bathonian Upper Estuarine Series of Eastern England. Of this ostracod fauna two genera, Belekocytheridea and Platycythere, and two subgenera, Eoschuleridea and Mediodentina are new. ecological study of the ostracod faunas indicates an alternation throughout the succession of marine and freshwater conditions. Of the two new genera, Belekocytheridea inhabits a brackish water environment and Platycytheve a marine to brackish water environment. Of the two new subgenera, Eoschuleridea is marine whilst Mediodentina is euryhaline, ranging from marine through brackish to almost freshwater conditions.

INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS STRETCHING from North Lincolnshire to the borders of Oxfordshire is a narrow strip of marine and freshwater clays, with some thin limestones, showing evidence of deposition in shallow water. These beds, known as the Upper Estuarine Series, underlie the rubbly limestones of the Bathonian Great Oolite Limestone and with a marked unconformity overlie the Bajocian Lincolnshire Limestone. They form the basal Bathonian sediments in the area. The absence of ammonites from the Upper Estuarine Series makes the dating of these sediments rather difficult. However, mapping and the examination of the invertebrate faunas suggests that they may be equivalent to the Hampen Marly Beds of further south. Certainly the ostracod faunas would not, at this stage, disagree with this. If this correlation is to be regarded as correct, the Upper Estuarine Series would be Middle Bathonian in age and belong to the zone of Tulites subcontractus (Morris & Lycett). Although of shallow water origin, there is evidence to suggest that these beds are not estuarine deposits in the strictest sense. Dr. C. J. Aslin of the University of East Anglia has for some time now been working on the stratigraphical and sedimen- tological problems of the Upper Estuarine Series, and it was he who made available his large collection of ostracods which form the basis of the present paper. The sections from which the ostracods were obtained occur in large quarries where the Upper Estuarine Series represents the overburden. The continual cutting back of these sediments makes it impossible to maintain a permanent section. The quarries are located as follows (see Text-fig. I): Kings Cliffe—TL/o12966. Ancaster (Thompson’s Pit)—SK_/992409. Ketton (Portland Cement OQuarry)—SK/972057-09. Cranford St. John (Kettering)—SP/926764. Dane Hill—SP/465273. It should be noted that in some cases the quarries are sited a mile or so from the town whose name they bear. The morphological terms used in the present paper are taken from Sylvester- Bradley (1956), Moore (1961) and Bate (1963). All the ostracods described in the text have been deposited in the collections of ti » Palaeontology Department, British Museum (Natural History). I should like to record my grateful thanks to Dr. H. J. Oertli, S.N.P.A., Pau, France, and to Dr. H. Malz, Senckenberg Museum, Frankfurt, Germany, for the loan of material which proved invaluable for comparison with the present fauna. Mr. S. H. Eagar printed the photographs originally taken by myself. II. SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTIONS The beds from which the ostracods were obtained are identified by a letter and refer to beds described by Aslin (in press).

DESCRIPTION. Carapace elongate, subreniform, rounded anteriorly, acuminate posteriorly. Dorsal margin arched, convex in the right valve, almost straight, sloping posteriorly in the left. Cardinal angles rounded. Antero-dorsal slope tends to be slightly concave, particularly just behind the anterior margin, a situation more noticeable in the right valve. Ventral margin almost straight in the left valve, concave medially in the right. Greatest height of carapace in anterior third in the left valve, almost median in the right. Greatest length below mid-point; greatest width median. Shell surface smooth. Left valve larger than the right which it overlaps along the ventral, postero-dorsal and antero-dorsal slopes. Posteriorly the left valve slightly over-reaches the right whilst anteriorly the right valve over-reaches the left. Hinge consists of a simple groove in the left valve into which the dorsal edge of the right valve fits. Inner margin and line of concrescence do not coincide terminally, prominent vestibules being produced. Anteriorly the vestibule is broad whilst posteriorly more narrow, extending along the postero-ventral margin of the inner part of the valve up to the centre of the median incurvature. Radial pore canals not clearly observed, but appear to be few in number and antero- ventrally can be seen to be branching. Three centrally situated oval muscle scars can be distinguished in the lectotype with a fourth situated behind. 28 BATHONIAN UPPER ESTUARINE OSTRACODA, I Dimensions.

Paracypris terraefullonica was originally described by Jones & Sherborn (1888 : 252) as Macrocypris terrae-fullonicae. Also described in the same publication is the ostracod M. horatiana which occupies a position within the publica- tion previous to that of M. terrae-fullonicae. Both these species are considered to be synonymous. The decision to select M. terrae-fullonicae as the type was influenced by the better preservation of the specimen available and the preference in name, indicating as it does, derivation from the Bathonian Fullers-Earth. Paracypris terraefullonica is similar to Paracypris? sp. A. Schmidt (1955 : 52) but differs posteriorly. In P.? sp. A. the posterior margin is close to the posterior cardinal angle, whilst that part of the valve behind the cardinal angle is more elongate. P. bajociana Bate (1963 : 186, pl. 2, figs. 1-8) has a much longer and more straight dorsal margin. Superfamily DARWINULACEA Brady & Norman 1889 Family DARWINULIDAE Brady & Norman 1889 Genus DARWINULA Brady & Robertson 1885 REMARKS. Darwinula stevensoni, the type species, has the right valve larger than the left, a feature given as characteristic of the genus in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology (Moore 1961 : 254). Several species of Darwinula are known, however, to possess a carapace in which the left valve is the larger. For example, the Recent D. daps Harding (1962 : 60, figs. 45-53) and the Purbeckian D. leguminella (Forbes mm Lyell 1855 : 294, text-fig. 334c). Many more species are so described in the literature. D. incurva sp. nov., described below also possesses a carapace in which the left valve is the larger. Darwinula incurva sp. nov. (Pl. 1, figs. 7-12) 1965 Darwinula sp.A. Bate: 751, pl. 109, figs. 1-4. Diacnosis. Darwinula of large size with broadly arched dorsum, rounded anterior and posterior, and strongly incurved ventral margin anterior of valve centre. Left valve strongly overlaping right along ventral margin and around posterior. Anteriorly left valve over-reaching right. Shell surface finely punctate. Muscle scars as for family.

Carapace oval-elongate, very finely punctate, appearing smooth in most specimens, although the internal surface of the valves is quite strongly punctate. Greatest length passes either through or just below mid-point, being dependent upon the outline of the anterior margin which may be either broadly rounded or extended forward slightly below mid-length. Posterior broadly rounded with the greatest width situated in the posterior third. Greatest height median. Dorsal margin arched. Ventral margin convex in the posterior half, strongly and characteristically incurved antero-medially. Left valve larger than the right which it strongly overlaps around the posterior and along the ventral margin. Around the anterior the overlap is replaced by overreach though along the antero-and postero- dorsal slopes overlap of the right valve by the left is noticeable. Muscle scars typical of the genus, consisting of a rosette of scars which in one specimen is composed of eleven in number. Inner margin and line of concrescence coincide anteriorly (not seen posteriorly) where a narrow duplicature is present. The surface of the duplicature in the left valve is serrated at right angles to the inner margin. The purpose of this is conjecture at the moment. Anterior radial pore canals short, straight and evenly spaced, about 20 in number. A long, narrow groove extends along the dorsal margin of the right valve, into which the dorsal margin of the left valve fits for purposes of articulation. Dimensions.

Bate 1965 is a juvenile instar of the present species and is here placed into synonymy. Comparison with other British Mesozoic darwinulids shows D. incurva to be larger, more elongate and more strongly incurved than previously described species. D. incurva is similar in outline to D. tubiformis Ljubimova (1956 : 119, pl. 23, figs. ra—b.) from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia but differs in not being so strongly swollen posteriorly and in being more slender in dorsal view. D. barabinskensis Mandelstam (as figured in Ljubimova r960 : 28, pl. 2, fig. 2) from the Lower Cretaceous of the western Siberian Lowlands (Krasnoyarsk region) is close to D. incurva in dorsal outline but does not taper quite so much anteriorly neither is it as incurved antero-ventrally. Superfamily CYTHERACEA Baird 1850 Family LIMNOCYTHERIDAE Klie 1938 Subfamily TIMIRIASEVIINAE Mandelstam 1960 Genus BISULCOCYPRIS Pinto & Sanguinetti 1958 Remarks. As stated elsewhere (Bate 1965) difference of opinion exists relating 30 BATHONIAN UPPER ESTUARINE OSTRACODA, I to the validity of the two genera Bisulcocypris and Theriosynoecum. Sylvester- Bradley & Pinto (MS.) are currently of the opinion that within the Timiriaseviinae there are two distinct genera, one with hollow tubercles (Theriosynoecum), the other with or without solid tubercles (Bisulcocypris). An opinion with which I am in full agreement. The presence of tubercles amongst these fresh to brackish water ostracods would appear to be either a genotypic or a phenotypic character. In those species which are normally without such ornamentation but which occasionally show it—it is conceivable that the presence of tubercles is in some way controlled by the environ- ment (pH, salinity etc.) and as such would be a phenotypic character. There appears to be a definite division between those species which show this possible phenotypic variation and those in which the tubercles are genotypically controlled. The genus Theriosynoecum is considered to fall into the latter category, whilst in Bisulcocypris both phenotypic and genotypic tuberculate species occur. A genotypic species is one in which tubercles are present through all the ontogenetic stages, whilst a pheno- typic species only shows the development of tubercles or nodes in the adult stage, and then, as appears to be often the case, in only one dimorph. In B. anglica sp. nov., for example, the nodes are characteristically developed in the male dimorph only. Bisulcocypris anglica sp. nov. (Pl. 2, figs. 1-1T) 1965 Bisulcocypris sp. A., Bate : 753, pl. 109, figs. 13, 14. Diacnosis. Bisulcocypris, oval/elongate in side view, tapering slightly to anterior. Posterior tapered in female dimorph. Greatest height at posterior cardinal angle. Ventro-lateral margin strongly convex, overhanging ventral surface. Two, short, crescentic sulci extend down from dorsal margin in anterior half of valve. Shell surface laterally punctate to reticulate. Ventro-lateral and ventral surfaces with strong lateral ridges. Slender males may possess small nodes in posterior half; females without nodes. Female with characteristic narrow posterior, produced by steeply sloping posterodorsal margin of posterior swelling. Male tending to have broader (height) posterior. Hinge lophodont. Valves equivalve. HoLotyPe. lo.2275, female carapace from bed QO, Kings Cliffe. PARATYPES. Io0.2276-99. Locality as above. DESCRIPTION. Carapace oval/elongate with the greatest height being in the posterior half at the posterior cardinal angle in adults but is situated at the anterior cardinal angle in juveniles. Greatest length through or slightly below mid-point. Greatest width in the posterior half in female dimorphs, median in the male. Posterior broadly rounded in the male dimorph whilst in the posteriorly swollen female the posterior becomes much narrower (height) due to the steeply sloping dorsal surface of the posterior swelling. Posterior cardinal angle sharply angled in both sexes, anterior cardinal angle shallow, broadly rounded sweeping down to the BATHONIAN UPPER ESTUARINE OSTRACODA, I 31 narrowing anterior margin. Dorsal margin medially concave in the female dimorph, but less noticeably so in the male. Ventro-lateral margin strongly convex, over- hanging the ventral surface. Shell surface strongly punctate to reticulate. Promi- nent lateral ridges extend along the ventro-lateral and ventral surfaces. In the male dimorph a number of small nodes (usually two in number) may occur in the posterior half of the carapace. One node is positioned just below and behind valve centre with the second node a short distance below and in front of this. In a single male, two smaller nodes occur dorsal to these. Two very small nodes are situated at the extreme posterior and a number around the anterior margin of both sexes. These are the only ones which occur in the female. Occasionally the median node described for the male is found also in a juvenile instar. Juveniles tend to be rather square in outline. Two, shallow, rather concentric sulci extend for a short distance only from the dorsal margin. Both sulci are situated in the anterior half of the carapace. Both left and right valves are of equal size. Along the ventral margin there is no overlap; postero-ventrally the right valve over-reaches the left whilst at the position of the antero-median incurvature the left over-reaches the right. Along the antero- dorsal slope the left valve progressively over-reaches the right with the maximum over-reach being at the anterior cardinal angle. Behind this angle the right valve strongly over-reaches the left for a short distance. Very slight overlap of the right by the left occurs at the posterior cardinal angle. Muscle scars are situated low down on the lateral part of the carapace below the first more medially situated sulcus, and consist of a backwardly sloping row of four adductor scars. Muscle scars anterior to these have not been observed. Hinge lophodont, only observed in the right valve where the median groove is long and rather broad. The anterior tooth is large and blade-like, being an enlarged, flattened continuation of the selvage. Posterior tooth not seen. From the dorsal view of a complete carapace it is obvious that an accommodation groove is present in the posterior half of the left valve. Around the anterior the inner margin and line of concrescence do not quite coincide. The separation is not really sufficient, however, for a vestibule to be developed. Anterior radial pore canals long and straight extending into the broad anterior flange, approximately 20 in number. Dimensions. Holotype.

The development of nodes in this species is restricted in adults to the male dimorphs and to a number of juvenile instars. Possibly those juveniles which show this feature may have been immature males, although there is no way of confirming this. Bzsulcocypris anglica is close to B. tenuwimarginata (Oerth 1957: 7605, pl. 23, figs. 15-24), specimens of which were kindly sent to me by Dr. Oertli, but is a much larger more elongate species. The anterior half of B. 32 BATHONIAN UPPER ESTUARINE OSTRACODA, I tenuimarginata is quite short and stubby when compared with the elongate anterior of B. anglica. The French species does not appear to show any tendency towards the development of lateral nodes. Bisulcocypris sp. A. described from the Bathonian of Oxfordshire is considered to belong to this species. Bisulcocypris ancasterensis sp. nov. (Pl. 3, figs. 1-10) 1965 Bisulcocypris sp. B; Bate: 753, pl. 109, figs. 10-12. Diacnosis. Bisulcocypris rectangular in outline with height at anterior cardinal angle almost equal to that at posterior cardinal angle. Strongly bi-sulcate, dimor- phic. Shell surface punctate/reticulate with three nodes in posterior half and two nodes in anterior half. Smaller additional nodes occur at extreme posterior and anterior. Both nodes and surface ornamentation more positively developed in juvenile instars. Muscle scars as for genus. HototyPe. lo.2282, female carapace from bed R, Ancaster. PARATYPES. Io0.2283-5, 2300-1, from bed R, Ancaster. DESCRIPTION. Carapace rectangular, dimorphic, rounded anteriorly and posteri- orly. Dorsal and ventral margins in the male dimorph are almost parallel with only a shallow concavity medially. In the female, identified by the swollen posterior half, the dorsal margin is quite strongly concave medially. Ventro-lateral margin in both dimorphs overhangs the ventral surface as viewed laterally. Greatest length through mid-point with greatest height and width in posterior half in males and females; greatest height in anterior half in juveniles. Carapace in the anterior half bi-sulcate, the posterior sulcus being the better developed of the two; this is especially true in the female dimorph. The adductor muscle scars which consist of an oblique row of four scars, are situated at the base of this sulcus. Cardinal angles distinct. Shell surface punctate to reticulate, further ornamented by a number of prominent nodes. In the posterior half of the carapace three nodes are arranged in a triangular pattern; a large central node with one of equal size situated in front and below this and a smaller node situated behind and below. Smaller nodes may occur above these and on the posterior. In the anterior half two nodes are present; one in front of the ventro-lateral termination of the posterior sulcus and the second, much higher up, in front of the termination of the anterior sulcus. Ventral surface ornamented with low, longitudinal ridges. Left valve larger than the right, which it overlaps along the ventral margin, especially mid-ventrally, and again at the anterior and posterior cardinal angles. There is no terminal overlap. Mid-dorsally the right valve over-reaches the left. Juvenile instars reticulate with well developed nodes. Posteriorly the two low nodes which occur dorsally above the main group of three in the adults are here strongly developed and are equal in dominance to the others. Internal details have not been observed in the present material but have been described for B. sp. B. (see Bate; 1965 : 754). BATHONIAN UPPER ESTUARINE OSTRACODA, I 33 Dimensions. Holotype.

Bisulcocypris ancasterensis sp. nov., in being strongly nodose differs at once from B. anglica sp. nov., and B. tenuimarginata (Oertli). Moreover, it may also be distinguished from the above in outline (having a much deeper anterior than found in B. anglica and a much more elongate anterior half than that occurring in B. tenuimarginata) and by the more strongly developed second sulcus, never developed to such an extent in the other two species. Bzsulcocypris sp. B. described from the Bathonian of Oxfordshire is almost certainly conspecific with the present species, despite its larger size.

A single female carapace, of good preservation has been found in bed B in the Kettering section. The range of this species is thus extended from the Bajocian (blagdent in part) into the Bathonian, although here again correlation of the horizons with known ammonite zones has not been possible. Family CYTHERIDEIDAE Sars 1925 Subfamily CYTHERIDEINAE Sars 1925 Genus FABANELLA Martin 1961 Remarks. Although placed by Martin into the Cytheridae, Fabanella is here considered to be more closely allied to the Cytherideidae on account of the shape and structure of the carapace, simple pore canals and muscle scar pattern. Although the antennal scar is not so strongly U-shaped as for the nominal genus Martin’s illustration (pl. 1, fig. 50) for the type species indicates that the arrangement is the same and belongs to Type B (Bate 1963 : 181, figs. 8—ro).

MATERIAL. Specimens registered in the collections: Io.2303-15 from bed R, Kings Cliffe and bed U, Ancaster. Remarks. LFabanella bathonica does not occur generally throughout the Upper Estuarine Series, being restricted to only a few horizons. However, when it does occur it is a common species amongst a marine to brackish-water fauna. Specimens of this species were kindly sent to me for comparison purposes by Dr. Oertli. Subfamily GALLIAECYTHERIDEINAE Andreev & Mandelstam 1964 REMARKS. The subfamily Galliaecytherideinae introduced by Andreev & Mandelstam contains genera which although possessing some external resemblance to those placed in the Schulerideidae are nevertheless distinguished by their possession of a type A muscle scar pattern and simple radial pore canals.
