        "text": "The Chondrichthyes are a group of jawed fishes with a cartilaginous skeleton. Diverse species of fish are included in the class, such as sharks, rays, skates, and chimaeras. Most of them live in the ocean. Osteichthyes fishes are another group of fishes, which are bony fishes.\n\nThe Classification of Chondrichthyes\n\nFishes in the class Chondrichthyes are included in the division Gnathostomata since they have jaws. There are a number of vertebrates with jaws in the Gnathostomata division. There are two superclasses of Gnathostomata, viz. Pisces (with fins) and Tetrapoda (with bare limbs).\n\nPisces are divided into two classes:\n\nChondrichthyes- Cartilaginous fishes\n\nOsteichthyes- Bony fishes\n\nChondrichthyes is subdivided into two subclasses:\n\nElasmobranchii- Sharks and rays, skates, sawfishes\n\nHolocephali- Chimaeras, also known as ghost sharks.\n\nClass Chondrichthyes\n\nChondrichthyes in the Greek language has the following meaning, chondr means ‘Cartilage’ and ichthyes means ‘Fish’. The class Chondrichthyes means a class that contains cartilaginous fishes whose skeleton is composed of cartilage. Chondrichthyes is further subdivided into two subclasses:\n\nElasmobranchii: In Greek, elasmo means ‘Plate’ and branchia means ‘gill’, hence we can tell that long and broad flattened gills are the characteristics of these fishes. It includes sharks and rays, skates, and sawfishes.\n\nHolocephali: The word Holocephali means ‘complete head’. It includes Chimaeras, also known as ghost sharks.\n\nFeatures of the Chondrichthyes\n\nCartilaginous fish have the following characteristics:\n\nAmong the Chondrichthyes are powerful jaws that are found in marine fish.\n\nWhale sharks, the second-largest vertebrae and the largest fish, measure up to 15 meters in length.\n\nThey possess a ventral mouth.\n\nCalcium deposits provide strength to the endoskeleton, which is composed of cartilage.\n\nNotochord can be found throughout life.\n\nBesides the elongated upper lobe, the tail consists of two shorter lobes. A distinct heterocercal tail protrudes from the lower lobe as well as the extension of vertebrae into the upper lobe.\n\nThere are placoid scales covering the skin.\n\nEach gill has between five and seven blades.\n\nThe lack of air bladders means they need to swim constantly to avoid sinking.\n\nAs poikilothermic animals, they cannot regulate their internal body temperature.\n\nIn addition to eating other fish, molluscs, and crustaceans, predatory fishes also feed on other species of fish.\n\nTwo chambered hearts, one with an auricle and one with a ventricle, are present in these creatures.\n\nDespite the vertebral column protecting their brains and spinal cords, chimpanzees have developed.\n\nThe sharks of the Chondrichthyes family possess special sense organs on their heads called electroreceptors that aid them in detecting prey and orienting themselves to their prey.\n\nTo defend themselves from enemies, they possess poison stings. This also helps the animals to prey on one another.\n\nChondrichthyes digestive system: The stomach, pharynx, mouth, intestines, and cloaca make up the digestive system. In females, the cloaca serves both as a reproductive organ and as an excretory organ.\n\nFertilization occurs internally. They are oviparous in some cases and viviparous in others.\n\nThe General Characteristics of Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes\n\nChondrichthyes and Osteichthyes have the following general characteristics:\n\nThey both belong to the phylum Pisces.\n\nBoth have endoskeletons and exoskeletons.\n\nBoth breathe through the gills.\n\nBoth have jaws and paired appendages.\n\nIt is possible for them to be oviparous, viviparous, or ovoviviparous.\n\nAccording to the structure of the endoskeleton, Pisces has two types of classes: the Chondrichthyes and the Osteichthyes. Both freshwater and marine species fall into these classes. Humans depend on fishes for nutrition and micronutrients, which play a very important role in their diet as they control most diseases. Fish is not just crucial to the ecosystem but is also very important to us as it provides the body with many nutrients and micronutrients. Nutrition is crucial to children's physical and mental development. People living in coastal regions of many developing countries rely heavily on them for income and employment."
