        "text": "Class Osteichthyes • bony fish have skeletons made of bone • Bony fish include ray-finned and lobe-finned fish.\n\nOrder Sarcopterygii lobe fin • Lobe-fins are paired pectoral and pelvic fins that are round in shape. • not as maneuverable as ray-fins • able to support weight • Only7 species exist today. • Coelacanths • Were considered extinct until 1938 • lungfish • Can remained buried in the mud for up to two years\n\nOrder Actinopterygii • Ray-finned fish have fins supported by a fan-shaped array of bones. • embedded in a thin layer of skin and connective tissue • light, collapsible, and easy to move Tuna Goldfish Guppies bass\n\nSome ray-finned fish have both lungs and gills. • can breathe air and survive out of water for several hours at a time • example: bichir found in West Africa\n\nRay-finned fish have a variety of body plans. • elaborate camouflage (sea dragon)\n\nBony fish have skeletons made of bone. • operculum protects a bony fish’s gills • movements of operculum help bony fish move water over gills eye .mouth . operculum\n\n1) fusiforma) = torpedo-shaped b) allows minimal drag while swimmingc) best shape for a pelagic cruise tuna Body shape\n\n2) compressed • laterally flattened (e.g., butterflyfishes & surgeonfishes) • allows for maneuverability in surge environments • useful for demersal fishes that hover above the reef • exception seen in flatfishes that lie on one side of the body as benthic fishes\n\n3) elongated or attenuated • long body (e.g., trumpetfish, cornetfish, eels) • seen in demersal fish that either hover motionless in the water) • seen also in benthic fishes (e.g., eels) that hide in holes in the reef\n\n4) depressed • dorso-ventrally flattened (e.g., frogfishes, scorpionfishes & gobies) • broad ventral surface facilitates resting on the bottom • seen in many benthic fishes\n\nBody Coloration • 1) source of color • pigment color - chromatophores for yellows, reds, oranges, browns, & blacks • structural color - iridophores (reflection) & light refraction for blues, silvers, & rainbows\n\nPatterns • a) countershading • dark blue or black dorsally, white or silvery ventrally • results in blue water \"camouflage“ • observed most frequently in pelagic cruisers\n\nb) camouflage • matching the background coloration • usually involves having irregular dark blotches and spots • typically seen in benthic fishes, especially benthic ambush predators (e.g., frogfishes, gobies, & many scorpionfishes) • some fishes (e.g., flatfishes) may exhibit rapid color changes in response to different backgrounds\n\nb) camouflage, cont. 5) matching downwelling light Hatchet fish Cookie cutter shark\n\nc) disruptive coloration 1) color pattern breaks up the silhouette of the fish 2) may involve dark bars across the eye and tail region 3) seen in many demersal fishes such as butterflyfishes\n\nd) bars and stripes 1) bars are vertical (e.g., manini) 2) stripes are horizontal (e.g., ta'ape) 3) seen frequently in schooling demersal fishes 4) may confuse potential predators by making it difficult to select individual prey from the school\n\ne) misdirection 1) false eye spots, etc. 2) observed in many demersal butterflyfishes\n\nf) advertising coloration 1) bright, obvious color patterns 2) possible functions a) advertising a cleaning station (e.g., cleaner wrasses) b) advertising a warning (e.g., nohu) c) advertising for mates (e.g., male parrotfishes) Hawaiian cleaner wrasse Nohu\n\ng) mimicry 1) imitating other creatures 2) seen in a few demersal and benthic fishes 3) examples a) blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus) mimics cleaner wrasses b) shortnose wrasse mimics Potter's angel which sports a defensive spine\n\ng) mimicry 4) leafy sea dragon (Australia)\n\ni) noctural versus diurnal color changes j) male versus female color differences k) juvenile versus adult color differences Dragon wrasse Stoplight parrotfish Bluehead wrasse\n\nScale and caudal fin types\n\nFish Scales\n\nFish Age and Growth by Scales • Use growth rings • Annulus • 3 growth rings on this scale • Fish is 3 years old, going on 4 • 3 yr old age class\n\nCaudal Fin Shape\n\nMouth continued`\n\nMouth DO NOT COPY!!Different shapes and positions • Superior - mouth oriented up fish often a surface feeder • Terminal - mouth at anterior end, often a midwater feeder • Inferior - mouth oriented downward, often a bottom feeder • Subterminal- mouth underneath fish, bottom feeder • Protrusible - mouth can alter shape to be more useful in suction feeding, can be seen in any of the above but less common among inferior mouths\n\nUpturned and near the top Typically a predator or strainer Superior Position Coloration adaptations Banded/ Barred striped\n\nSpotted/ Speckled Counter shading Bright colors\n\nflattened bodies (plaice) Compressed long torpedo-shaped bodies Fusiform – round/torpedo Fast in open water\n\nGlobe form Pectoral Fin Adaptation Truncate Elongated Depressed\n\nReproduction is external* Females spawn – shed eggs from their bodies into a nest Nest are hollows in the floor of lakes, steams, rivers or the ocean Males milt – release sperm containing fluid over the eggs Many species have special locations called spawning grounds where they return to mate Spawning is ineffective in that small percentages of eggs are fertilized or develop Small fish that hatch are call fry A few species such as guppies, mollies and swordtails are live-bearers (eggs are fertilized internally)\n\nReproduction* • Anadromous fish • Fish that return to their spawning rivers from the ocean at certain seasons for breeding in fresh water • Born in small streams, mature in the ocean, use smell or magnetic field to return to stream where they hatched- thousands of miles, length of time spent in stream after hatching and length of time in ocean varies • Salmon\n\nAnadromous fish* • Semelparous • All die after reproducing • Pacific Salmons; King, Silver, Sockeye, Chum, Pink\n\nAnadromous fish* • Iteroparous • Can spawn multiple times • Atlantic Salmon, Steelhead (rainbow trout)\n\nReproduction continued* • Catadromous • Fish live in fresh water • Breed and spawn in the sea • Eel"
