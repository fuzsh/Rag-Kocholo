        "text": "The AIA Ohio Scholarship is supported by the AIA Ohio Foundation that exists to further the experience of architecture in Ohio. In keeping with this idea, a primary agenda of the Foundation is to provide scholarships to students of architecture and facilitate the connection between the profession and future leaders. The AIA Ohio Foundation awards scholarships each academic year to students attending each of the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) accredited schools of architecture in the state of Ohio. AIA Ohio Foundation board members present this merit-based award to two students each year. Winners are often invited to the AIA Ohio Annual State Convention.\n\nRecipients\n\n2021-22 Pankaj Nath Joy & Tanzim Rachana\n\n2020-21 Sarah Barry & Brandon Dalessandro\n\n2019-20 Siv DeBoom & Margaret Woolf\n\n2018-19 Bin Sayeed Bakhti & Emma Pevoar\n\n2017-18 Samah A.

OstermanCron is based in Cincinnati and has done a great deal of design work for Miami University across its Oxford campus.
