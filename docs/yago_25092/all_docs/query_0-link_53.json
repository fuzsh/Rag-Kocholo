        "text": "1. Meera Joshi & Maria Torres-Springer\n\nNew York City Deputy Mayors\n\nAs New York City deputy mayors, Meera Joshi and Maria Torres-Springer are navigating some of the most pressing and high-profile issues facing the city. Joshi, the nation’s former chief trucking regulator, oversees the city’s transportation, infrastructure and construction in her role as deputy mayor for operations. She is overseeing such projects as reimagining the Cross Bronx Expressway to address air pollution and community connectivity issues in the South Bronx and the future of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which the city was just awarded federal funding for planning. Joshi recently joined the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is in the midst of a groundbreaking rollout of congestion pricing. Torres-Springer is in the thick of the debate over the city’s housing future, in her role handling economic development and housing. The deputy mayor for housing, economic development and workforce has been pressing state lawmakers to spur the creation of more housing to address the low vacancy rate. Torres-Springer also co-chairs a new Tenant Protection Cabinet created by Mayor Eric Adams to address tenant issues and coordinate tenant policy across city agencies.\n\n2. Grace Meng\n\nMember of Congress\n\nIt has been over a decade since Rep. Grace Meng emerged from a competitive Democratic primary and went on to become the first Asian American New Yorker in Congress. Over the years, Meng has climbed the ranks and now is vice ranking member of the influential House Appropriations Committee, with a possibility to gain additional power over federal spending should Democrats retake the majority. And while other Asian American politicians have followed her trailblazing path – including in the Assembly, where Meng started out – Meng remains the highest ranking Asian American elected official in the state.\n\n3. John Liu\n\nState Senator\n\nJohn Liu is more resilient than most politicians. The former New York City Council member and one-term city comptroller was a top mayoral candidate in 2013, and returned in 2018 with his comeback state Senate election. He now chairs the New York City Education Committee, and the Queens lawmaker has been in spotlight thanks to the debate over whether to renew – or revise – mayoral control of schools in the city. A two-year extension of mayoral control, which was set to expire on June 30, was included in the state budget, along with tweaks that increase state oversight and mandate smaller class sizes.\n\n4. Twyla Carter\n\nAttorney-in-Chief and CEO, The Legal Aid Society\n\nA seasoned defender and former executive at The Bail Project, Twyla Carter enters her second year leading one of New York’s oldest legal services. The Legal Aid Society has tangled with New York City officials on a number of issues: The group released a list of police officers with the highest lawsuit payouts under its Cop Accountability Project and reached a tentative settlement over the city’s disputed right to shelter law. Last fall, The Legal Aid Society expanded with a new unit dedicated to serving New York City Housing Authority tenants.\n\n5. Rohit T. Aggarwala, David Do, Kevin D. Kim & Ashwin Vasan\n\nCommissioners, New York City Department of Environmental Protection; Taxi and Limousine Commission; Department of Small Business Services; Department of Health and Mental Hygiene\n\nDr. Ashwin Vasan combines high-level medical training with a long-standing interest in public policy, making him a natural choice to serve as health commissioner of the country’s largest city. Vasan, who previously led the national social services nonprofit Fountain House and remains a practicing internist at NewYork-Presbyterian’s Columbia University Irving Medical Center, joined the mayor last fall to launch “HealthyNYC,” an initiative to increase the average lifespan of New Yorkers by targeting major causes of premature death.\n\nRohit T. Aggarwala is the leading environmental official in the Adams administration. Aggarwala, who leads the Department of Environment Protection and serves as the city’s chief climate officer, is tasked with improving the city’s resilience in a time of increased flooding. The Bloomberg-era architect in the innovative PlaNYC sustainability initiative, Aggarwala’s appointment is a sign of the Adams administration’s ties to the former mayor.\n\nSmall Business Services Commissioner Kevin D. Kim has kept busy, whether it’s increasing contracts and loans to small entrepreneurs, cutting red tape, assisting in the local marijuana rollout or even adopting artificial intelligence tools to assist business owners. He was previously the first Asian American commissioner of the state Liquor Authority.\n\nTaxi & Limousine Commissioner David Do came to New York City from Washington, D.C., where he led the city’s Department of For-Hire Vehicles and the Mayor’s Office on Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs. Since taking the reins two years ago, Do has steered the TLC through several twists and turns, including lifting the cap on for-hire vehicles that are fully electric and the looming congestion pricing rollout.\n\n6. Jeanette M. Moy\n\nCommissioner, State Office of General Services\n\nMaking sure the state’s day-to-day operations run as they should may not sound exciting, but it is a critical job that Jeanette M. Moy excels in. Moy runs the state Office of General Services and oversees the government’s operations and billions of dollars in procurement. When the governor needed someone to fix the state’s muddied transition to commercialized cannabis management, she chose Moy to lead the audit. Moy’s agency has also promoted the state’s light-duty electric vehicle fleet as part of the governor’s transition plan toward zero-emission vehicles by 2035.\n\n7. Iwen Chu, Jeremy Cooney & Kevin Thomas\n\nState Senators\n\nState Sen. Jeremy Cooney has represented a Rochester-area district since 2021, following an election that made him the first upstate Asian American elected to the state Legislature. He chairs the Committee on Procurement and Contracts as well as the Subcommittee on Cannabis, a key post as the state looks to improve its nascent legal recreational marijuana market. State Sen. Kevin Thomas – who made history in 2018 as the first Indian American elected to the state Senate in New York – serves as chair of the Consumer Protection Committee. He had launched a congressional run on Long Island but ultimately opted against it, and will not be seeking reelection either this year. State Sen. Iwen Chu has blazed a trail too, becoming the first Asian American woman to serve in the state Senate. Elected to represent a southern Brooklyn district in 2022, Chu chairs the Libraries Committee and has fought to keep CUNY schools affordable and prevent cuts to city libraries while delivering more than $30 million to AAPI community-based organizations.\n\n8. Bhairavi Desai\n\nExecutive Director, New York Taxi Workers Alliance\n\nBhairavi Desai is among New York City’s most prominent labor leaders as head of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. The group’s latest priorities involve keeping regulations regarding cameras and partitions inside cab vehicles intact to protect drivers against potential violence and lobbying against Manhattan’s $15 congestion pricing toll. The group’s anti-congestion pricing campaign took a blow following the Traffic Mobility Review Board’s recommendation to provide a discounted congestion fare for taxis and ride-hailing vehicles instead of an exemption.\n\n9. Pat Wang\n\nPresident and CEO, Healthfirst\n\nOnly around 16% of health plan CEOs are women, and Pat Wang is one of them. As head honcho at Healthfirst, the largest nonprofit health insurer in the state, Wang has called for the Medicaid incentive program to receive full state funding – nearly 1.5 million of Healthfirst’s members are enrolled in Medicaid – and launched pilot predictive analytics for the nonprofit’s maternity care program, with the goal of early high-risk detection. Wang serves as deputy chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s board of directors as a public interest representative.\n\n10. Wayne Ho\n\nPresident and CEO, Chinese-American Planning Council\n\nNonprofit leader Wayne Ho heads the Chinese-American Planning Council, which serves over 80,000 Asian New Yorkers annually through social programs, such as digital literacy courses, English classes and youth summer employment programs. CPC recently marked the grand opening of CPC One, a mixed-use project with affordable housing for over 200 seniors and community members, and a Manhattan community center for expanded services for 15,000 community members. Ho, who chairs the governor’s Not-For-Profit Contracting Advisory Council, also drew a crowd at the organization’s third AAPI reception at the Somos conference last year.\n\n11. Ron Kim, Grace Lee, Zohran Mamdani, Jenifer Rajkumar, Steven Raga & Sarahana Shrestha\n\nAssembly Members\n\nThe Assembly’s Asian Pacific American Task Force is co-chaired by Zohran Mamdani and Grace Lee, two young New York City lawmakers who are on different points along the ideological spectrum but both rising stars in the Democratic Party. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, was a driver behind a fare-free bus pilot program in New York City, but he was unable to extend or expand it this year. The Queens lawmaker also made headlines for his calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and his push to end the tax-exempt status of Columbia University and New York University.\n\nLee, a first-term lawmaker from lower Manhattan, helped secure state funding for AAPI community services and for public housing residents who fell behind on rent due to COVID-19. Lee also passed legislation making Lunar New Year a statewide school holiday and has introduced a bill to mandate AAPI education and a Hate Crimes Modernization Act. She is the first Korean American woman elected to the state Legislature.\n\nAssembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar has been raising her profile as a loyal ally of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, often showing up alongside the mayor and backing his initiatives and proposals. The state Legislature’s first Indian American woman and first Hindu representative, Rajkumar also passed legislation to make Diwali a school holiday in the city and championed a recently passed measure to crack down on illegal cannabis shops.\n\nAssembly Member Ron Kim reached a political peak during the coronavirus pandemic, as he led the charge against then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo over the deaths of nursing home residents. The Queens progressive is facing a more challenging environment, only narrowly fending off a Republican rival in 2022 and contending with a Democratic primary threat this cycle. He has seemingly made a pivot lately, backing increased funding for law enforcement and recently joining the Flushing Chinese Business Association to support a shoplifting crackdown.\n\nAssembly Member Sarahana Shrestha is another progressive incumbent who’s facing a more moderate challenger this year. A member of the so-called Socialists in Office, the first-term lawmaker from the Hudson Valley is perhaps best known for her environmental activism.\n\nAssembly Steven Raga, who also took office last year, is the state Legislature’s first Filipino American lawmaker. The Queens politician, who previously led the nonprofit Woodside on the Move, has called for stronger press freedoms and state government transparency.\n\n12. Nina Kubota\n\nPresident and CEO, New York City School Construction Authority\n\nNina Kubota is the woman behind the expansive developments under the New York City School Construction Authority. Since Mayor Eric Adams took office, Kubota, who built a 20-year career at the SCA, has been aligning the authority’s long-term plans with the mayor’s push to make all public schools fully electric. The SCA recently opened 10 new school buildings across the city, adding over 4,400 new student seats, and purchased a 69,000-square-foot lot in Flushing for $82 million as part of its future construction plans in Queens.\n\n13. Edith Hsu-Chen\n\nExecutive Director, New York City Department of City Planning\n\nUnder Edith Hsu-Chen’s leadership, New York City is continuing its post-pandemic development to support Mayor Eric Adams’ efforts to add 500,000 new homes in the next decade. Among the department’s latest rollouts is the new Green Fast Track for Housing program, which streamlines the environmental review process for small to midsized residential projects, and the agency’s draft zoning plan for Midtown South. The Manhattan rezoning is expected to add 4,000 new homes within a 42-block radius, with 1,000 of those units set to be income-restricted.\n\n14. Jo-Ann Yoo\n\nExecutive Director, Asian American Federation\n\nJo-Ann Yoo’s priorities for the Asian American Federation lately have focused largely on public health. That’s unsurprising, given that their recent survey revealed that over 60% of Asian New Yorkers reported feeling isolated or anxious, with a third experiencing increased stress partly attributed to the uptick in anti-Asian hate crimes. In addition to its involvement in campaigns expanding access to mental health services, Yoo’s organization partnered with NYC Health + Hospitals on its doctor public service announcement video series to boost enrollment in the city’s health care services among Asian Americans.\n\n15. Neal Kwatra\n\nFounder and CEO, Metropolitan Public Strategies\n\nNeal Kwatra has established Metropolitan Public Strategies as a go-to public affairs firm in New York. The well-connected and veteran political operative has been behind a long list of successful issue campaigns, from raising the minimum wage to regulating Airbnb. Kwatra’s firm has also been in the thick of the state’s ambitious offshore wind efforts as an adviser to Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer. As the process for awarding new casino licenses unfolds over the next year, MPS will play a role shaping the narratives for its clients in the sector.\n\n16. Satish Tripathi\n\nPresident, University at Buffalo\n\nSatish Tripathi has served as president at the University at Buffalo for 13 years, making him a contender for New York’s longest-tenured university president on record. The Western New York school continues to fortify its status as a world-class public research institution under his stewardship. UB garnered $123 million in fundraising during its fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2023, in addition to a generous $40 million alumni donation to its engineering school. What’s more, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced plans to establish an artificial intelligence hub on the university’s campus, which was included in the latest state budget.\n\n17. Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Linda Lee, Chi Ossé, Sandra Ung, Julie Won, Susan Zhuang\n\nNew York City Council Members\n\nJust a few years ago, only two Asian Americans were serving in the New York City Council. Today, that number has swelled to seven.\n\nNew York City Council Member Linda Lee, who chairs the Mental Health, Disabilities and Addiction Committee, is the brainchild behind the legislative body’s mental health roadmap, which lays out a comprehensive strategy for improving mental health in the city. She fended off several rivals in her reelection bid last year.\n\nCity Council Member Sandra Ung also won another term in her Flushing-area district last year. The chair of the Standards and Ethics Committee has been part of the push to make the Lunar New Year an official holiday.\n\nCouncil Member Shahana Hanif co-chairs the body’s Progressive Caucus, but lost her post leading the Committee on Immigration earlier this year, perhaps due to her vote against the city budget. Hanif, the only Muslim woman in the legislative body, has also been outspoken in support of Gaza. Ossé, who, like Hanif, is part of the Progressive Caucus and a supporter of Palestinian liberation, lost his chair of the Committee on Cultural Affairs. Ossé has both Black and Chinese ancestry.\n\nTwo other progressives, Shekar Krishnan and Julie Won, retained their committee chairs. Krishnan, who chairs the Parks and Recreation Committee, has sought to protect street vendors, some of whom are Asian American. Won helms the Contracts Committee and navigated a major rezoning debate in her district, eventually backing the $2 billion Innovation QNS project after winning changes.\n\nThe newest member of the City Council is Democrat Susan Zhuang, who was elected last fall to represent a new district in southern Brooklyn. The rookie lawmaker joined the Common Sense Caucus, a group made up of Republicans and centrist Democrats.\n\n18. Asim Rehman\n\nCommissioner and Chief Administrative Law Judge, New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings\n\nThe New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings isn’t the city’s most recognizable governmental body, but it’s one of the country’s largest municipal administrative law tribunals. Last year, OATH held some 220,000 hearings and 2,000 trials and issued over 2,000 appeals decisions – even as the office had major budget cuts. Asim Rehman, appointed in 2022, is the first Asian American to lead the office and is one of most senior Muslim Americans in the Adams administration. Rehman also saw the launch of a new division focused on special education.\n\n19. Joseph Bae\n\nCo-CEO, KKR\n\nJoseph Bae is one of the most influential Asian American executives in finance, which buoys the New York City economy. Bae’s private equity giant KKR has made big gains lately, wrapping up its fourth quarter with a 21% growth in fee-related earnings per share and raising $2.8 billion in the second round of its sustainability forward capital fundraising. In addition to his corporate duties as co-CEO, Bae co-founded the Asian American Foundation and sits on several other advisory boards. He will serve as a new member of Harvard’s governing board starting in July.\n\n20. S. David Wu\n\nPresident, Baruch College\n\nBaruch College secured bragging rights as it topped the U.S. News & World Report rankings among regional universities in the area. The City University of New York institution has had tremendous growth under S. David Wu’s stewardship. Baruch will be sharing in a $10 million city investment for CUNY campuses under the CUNY 2x Tech initiative to boost enrollment in tech degrees as part of the city’s Young Adult Career Success plan. The school also launched an initiative to bolster its business programming, the LaGuardia-Baruch Business Academy, which expands on a transfer agreement between its business school and LaGuardia’s Business Administration program.\n\n21. Frank Wu\n\nPresident, Queens College\n\nQueens College boasts one of New York City’s most diverse student bodies, where a third of students are immigrants and 100 languages are represented on campus, according to President Frank Wu. The governor has continued to support capital upgrades and investments in the City University of New York system, and CUNY’s Queens College garnered $70,000 in grants awarded by The Carroll and Milton Petrie Foundation to fund its on-campus food pantry and the Queens College Service Corps. Most excitingly, two music faculty members took home awards at the Grammys, which will surely help boost ongoing efforts to expand its arts programs.\n\n22. Sudha Setty\n\nDean, CUNY School of Law\n\nA top law educator with a track record of work in social justice, Sudha Setty brings equity-forward sensibilities to the CUNY School of Law, which is known for its highly engaged student body. Since her 2022 appointment as the school’s dean, she has revived the W. Haywood Burns chair – a position that was created to honor the late Black civil rights lawyer but then suspended due to lack of funding – and launched a new social clinic to serve New York’s incoming asylum-seekers and a $1 million pilot program to empower youth, entitled the First Impressions Youth Justice Initiative.\n\n23. Margaret Fung\n\nCo-Founder and Executive Director, Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund\n\nMargaret Fung is a veteran civil rights attorney who heads the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. The group’s trailblazing legal work runs the gamut, but it has been especially focused on defending voting rights as they are being undermined across the U.S. The organization sued the Nassau County Legislature over its redistricting plans, which the fund argued weakened voting blocs for Asian, Black and Latino voters, and filed an appeals claim with coalition partners to expand voting rights to noncitizen New Yorkers in city elections.\n\n24. Sarah Sayeed & Eva Wong\n\nExecutive Directors, New York City Mayor Civic Engagement Commission; Office of Community Mental Health\n\nSarah Sayeed is part of the city’s leadership cohort shoring up New Yorkers’ civic involvement. Sayeed has led the Civic Engagement Commission since it was formed following a 2018 ballot initiative. Some CEC programming suffered delays from the pandemic but have resumed with the launch of a citywide participatory budget to distribute $5 million to select community programs. Sayeed’s CEC team was consolidated under the Mayor’s Office of Engagement in the Adams administration.\n\nWhen the city opened its Office of Community Mental Health during the coronavirus pandemic, no one was more suited to run it than Eva Wong, whose background as a licensed mental health counselor with 15 years in mental health care management made her a perfect fit. The office works across agencies to carry out mental health initiatives like the Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division, a health-forward emergency response program that the city expanded last year.\n\n25. Peter Tu\n\nExecutive Director, Flushing Chinese Business Association\n\nAs the Flushing Chinese Business Association’s chief executive, Peter Tu has a long track record of elevating the Queens neighborhood’s business interests, the vast majority of which are Chinese- and Korean-owned. But Tu has made it clear that enterprising entrepreneurs from all backgrounds are welcome to set up shop in the neighborhood, noting his nonprofit works with non-Asian entrepreneurs,too: “I want everyone to know that Flushing is a thriving place for anyone who wants to do business,” he told local outlet QNS last fall.\n\n26. Joseph Tsai & Clara Wu Tsai\n\nCo-Owners, Brooklyn Nets and New York Liberty\n\nBeyond their multimillion-dollar investments and big business ties in China, Joseph Tsai and Clara Wu Tsai also own several professional sports teams, including the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA’s New York Liberty, making them one of New York City’s most visible power couples. Joseph Tsai is also chair of BSE Global, which includes the Nets and its Barclays Center arena, while Clara Wu Tsai is the corporate entity’s vice chair. The couple’s foundation in 2020 launched its Social Justice Fund, which supports economic mobility within communities of color in Brooklyn.\n\n27. Ed Domingo\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts\n\nAlthough MGM Resorts acquired Empire City Casino fairly recently in 2019, Ed Domingo has experience in the casino and entertainment industry dating back to the early aughts. Domingo’s casino is currently the largest tax contributor in Yonkers and among the municipality’s largest private employers. The gambling operator has leveraged that fact with the announcement of its revamp plans for an $850 million entertainment center if awarded one of New York’s downstate commercial gambling licenses. The company unveiled the sleek design rendering for its expansion plans in December.\n\n28. Wellington Chen\n\nExecutive Director, Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corp.\n\nWellington Chen is a longtime Chinatown leader who often acts as liaison between its community members and government officials. In his official capacity as executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, Chen helps drive the neighborhood’s economic development and revitalization. New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced that $56 million will go toward upgrading Chinatown’s Park Row and Kimlau Square area. The latter was built in honor of the late Lt. Benjamin Ralph Kimlau, a Chinese American pilot who died in World War II.\n\n29. John Park\n\nExecutive Director, MinKwon Center for Community Action\n\nThrough offices in Flushing, Queens, and New Jersey’s Palisades Park, the MinKwon Center for Community Action offers support to underserved residents in accessing social programs. Beyond its community service, the group is also extremely active in local politics. John Park’s organization has advocated for Local Law 11 to allow noncitizen New Yorkers to vote in municipal elections and is a vocal opponent of the proposed casino project near Citi Field, which the group argues would worsen economic disparities for poverty-stricken residents.\n\n30. Thomas Yu\n\nExecutive Director, Asian Americans for Equality\n\nThomas Yu’s nearly 30 years of service have established Asian Americans for Equality as one of New York’s most prominent community development organizations serving low-income Asian residents. Under his stewardship, the nonprofit has added more than 400 new low-income housing units and secured $80 million in funding for community reinvestment, including a $6.8 million aid package supporting AAPI groups awarded by the state. The organization’s next major project is developing the Magnolia Gardens transitional housing in Queens’ Flushing area with the $79 million loan it secured in March.\n\n31. Trip Yang\n\nFounder, Trip Yang Strategies\n\nTrip Yang is an established Democratic political strategist in New York and beyond. He has engineered election wins for elected officials like Rep. Dan Goldman and Assembly Members Catalina Cruz, Grace Lee and Sam Berger, and worked on presidential campaigns for Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders. Most recently, he helped boost AAPI turnout in a successful bid to send Tom Suozzi back to Congress. His team has been involved in a number of key races nationally, including the independent expenditure effort on behalf of Maryland Gov. Wes Moore's successful 2022 election.\n\nEditor’s note: Trip Yang is a member of City & State’s advisory board.\n\n32. Carl Hum\n\nSenior Vice President and General Counsel, Real Estate Board of New York\n\nCarl Hum has served as chief legal officer of the influential Real Estate Board of New York for nearly a decade – handling compliance, legislative, corporate and legal needs – while also serving as a senior vice president. Hum’s expertise came in handy as REBNY went toe-to-toe with trade unions over high-stakes negotiations surrounding an expired tax abatement program for affordable housing, which was revived in the state budget. The trade group is expected to release new guidance for industry members in the aftermath of the National Association of Realtors’ commission lawsuit settlement.\n\n33. Angela Sung Pinsky\n\nHead of Government Affairs and Public Policy, Google New York\n\nAngela Sung Pinsky’s passion for economic empowerment catapulted her into a career building strong development initiatives. After serving under then-New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s economic development team and as executive director for the Association for a Better New York, Pinsky brings plenty of expertise to Google, leveraging the tech giant’s resources to bolster relations and build a tech career pipeline through initiatives like the $4 million Google NYC Tech Opportunity Fund. The company also partners with the city for the FutureReadyNYC initiative, which serves roughly 7,000 students at 100 city schools.\n\n34. Maf Misbah Uddin\n\nFounder and President, Alliance of South Asian American Labor\n\nThe son of a Bengali political activist and an organizing leader in his own right, Maf Misbah Uddin heads the Alliance of South Asian American Labor headquartered in Queens. The labor group regularly mobilizes its South Asian members on political matters, including organizing rallies against union-busting and providing political endorsements of legislation and candidates. Uddin is also treasurer of District Council 37, the largest public employee union in New York City, and he has served as the president of Accountants, Statisticians and Actuaries Local 1407 since 2000.\n\n35. Shawn Ma\n\nDirector of Asian American Affairs, Office of the Governor\n\nAs director of Asian American affairs, Shawn Ma is the governor’s point person with a key constituency in New York. Ma, who cultivates connections between the Hochul administration and constituents in the AAPI community, assumed the role at the start of this year, following a stint as a special assistant in the Hochul administration. He was also director of operations and strategic projects at City Hall in New York City, gaining substantial experience around community engagement and project management. A key colleague and collaborator in the effort is Sibu Nair, the deputy director under Ma.\n\n36. Anil Beephan Jr. & Lester Chang\n\nAssembly Members\n\nRepublican Assembly Member Lester Chang stunned the political establishment in 2022 by toppling incumbent Peter Abbate Jr., a veteran Democrat who had held the Brooklyn seat since 1986. Despite questions surrounding Chang’s residency, Democrats opted against trying to expel the first-term lawmaker. Chang, whose parents emigrated from China, joined fellow Assembly Republicans on a “friendship delegation” trip to the country last year. His colleague, fellow Republican Assembly Member Anil Beephan Jr., has represented parts of Dutchess County since taking office in 2023. Beephan has reached across the aisle to join Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar on a measure cracking down on illegal marijuana shops.\n\n37.
