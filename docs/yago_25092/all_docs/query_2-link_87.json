        "text": "Actress Joan Cusack was born on October 11, 1962 in New York City and is the daughter of Nancy (née Carolan) and Dick Cusack. Her father was an advertising executive, writer and actor, and her mother was a mathematics teacher. Her siblings - Susie Cusack, John Cusack, Ann Cusack and Bill Cusack are also actors. Her family is of Irish descent.\n\nRaised in Evanston, Illinois, Cusack was actively encouraged to explore her creativity by her parents, and as a child, she joined the Piven Theater Workshop. She went on to learn and perform improvisation at the Story Theater and The Ark. Later, she attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, graduating with a bachelor's degree in English. Whilst at university, Cusack took some small film roles, but her big break came after graduation, when she joined the cast of the legendary \"Saturday Night Live\". However, she only stayed for one season before moving onto explore other projects.\n\nCusack produced a memorable turn in the acclaimed Broadcast News - Nachrichtenfieber (1987), and she earned an Oscar nomination for her performance in Die Waffen der Frauen (1988). Other notable films include Die Addams Family in verrückter Tradition (1993), Corrina, Corrina (1994), Ein Mann, ein Mord (1997) and In & Out - Rosa wie die Liebe (1997), which earned her a second Oscar nomination. One of her most well-known roles was Rosalie Mullins, the principal of Horace Green Elementary School in School of Rock (2003). She also provided, superbly, the voice of Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl in Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010) and A Toy Story: Alles hört auf kein Kommando (2019). On television, she scored a role on Shameless: Nicht ganz nüchtern (2011), with her work garnering her an Emmy nomination.\n\nJoan Cusack is married to an attorney, Dick Burke. They have two sons - Dylan and Miles.\n\nAlec Baldwin is the oldest, and best-known, of the four Baldwin brothers in the acting business (the others are Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin and Daniel Baldwin). Alexander Rae Baldwin III was born on April 3, 1958 in Massapequa, New York, the son of Carol Newcomb (Martineau) and Alexander Rae Baldwin Jr., a high school teacher and football coach at Massapequa High School. He is of Irish, as well as English, French, Scottish, and German, descent.\n\nAlec Baldwin burst onto the TV scene in the early 1980s with appearances on several series, including The Doctors (1963) and Unter der Sonne Kaliforniens (1979), before scoring feature film roles in Für immer Lulu (1986), Beetlejuice (1988), Die Waffen der Frauen (1988), Die Mafiosi-Braut (1988) and Talk Radio (1988). In 1990, Baldwin appeared in the first on-screen adaptation of the \"Jack Ryan\" character created by mega-selling espionage author, Tom Clancy. The film, Jagd auf Roter Oktober (1990), was a box office and critical success, with Baldwin appearing alongside icy Sean Connery. Unfortunately, Baldwin fell out with Paramount Studios over future scripts for \"Jack Ryan\", and subsequent Ryan roles went to Harrison Ford.\n\nBaldwin instead went to Broadway to perform \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", garnering a Tony nomination for his portrayal of \"Stanley Kowalski\" (he would reprise the role in a 1995 TV adaptation). Baldwin won over critics as a lowlife thief pursued by dogged cop Fred Ward in Miami Blues (1990), met his future wife Kim Basinger while filming the Neil Simon comedy, Die blonde Versuchung (1991), starred in the film adaptation of the play, Bodyswitch - Verhexte Küsse (1992) (in which he starred off-Broadway), and made an indelible ten-minute cameo as a hard-nosed real estate executive laying down the law in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He also made a similar tour-de-force monologue in the thriller, Malice - Eine Intrige (1993), as a doctor defending his practices, in which he stated, \"Let me tell you something: I am God\".\n\nDemand for Baldwin's talents in the 1990s saw more scripts swiftly come his way, and he starred alongside his then-wife, Kim Basinger, in a remake of the Steve McQueen action flick, Getaway (1994), brought to life the famous comic strip character, Shadow und der Fluch des Khan (1994), and starred as an assistant district attorney in the civil rights drama, Das Attentat (1996). Baldwin's distinctive vocal talents then saw him voice US-aired episodes of the highly popular UK children's show, Thomas und seine Freunde (1984), plus later voice-only contributions to other animated/children's shows, including Clerks - Die Ladenhüter (2000), Cats & Dogs - Wie Hund und Katz' (2001), Final Fantasy - Die Mächte in dir (2001) and Der SpongeBob Schwammkopf Film (2004).\n\nIn the early 2000s, Baldwin and Basinger endured an acrimonious break-up that quickly became tabloid fodder but, while his divorce was high-profile, Baldwin excelled in a number of lower-profile supporting roles in a variety of films, including State and Main (2000), Pearl Harbor (2001), The Cooler - Alles auf Liebe (2003) (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor), Aviator (2004), ...und dann kam Polly (2004) and Departed: Unter Feinden (2006). As he was excelling as a consummate character actor, Baldwin found a second career in television comedy. Already known for his comedic turns hosting Saturday Night Live (1975), he essayed an extended guest role on Will & Grace (1998) in 2005 before taking on what would arguably become his most famous role, that of network executive \"Jack Donaghy\", opposite Tina Fey in the highly-acclaimed sitcom, 30 Rock (2006). The role brought Baldwin two Emmy Awards, three Golden Globes, and an unprecedented six Screen Actors Guild Awards (not including cast wins).\n\nContinuing to appear in films as 30 Rock (2006) wrapped up its final season, Baldwin was engaged in 2012 to wed Hilaria Baldwin (aka Hilaria Lynn Thomas); the couple married on June 30, 2012.\n\nThe CCH stands for Carol Christine Hilaria, her birth name. Most of her characters are enriched with positive attributes -- strength, confidence, integrity, strong-mindedness -- and it is a testament to the abilities of this four-time Emmy nominated actress that she continues on such a high plane in a five-decade career.\n\nBorn on Christmas Day 1952 in Guyana, she was raised on a sugar cane plantation. Her parents, Betsy Enid Arnella (James) and Ronald Urlington Pounder, moved the family to the States while she was still a young girl, but she and her sister were subsequently sent to a convent boarding school in Britain where they were introduced to art and the classics. Following high school graduation, she arrived in New York and studied at Ithaca College, where her acting talents were strongly tapped into. Regional and classical repertory theater followed, earning roles in such productions as \"The Mighty Gents\" (1979) with Morgan Freeman at the New York Shakespeare Festival and \"Open Admissions\" (1984), her Broadway debut. Other stage work includes \"Coriolanus,\" \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" \"The Frog,\" \"The Lodger\" and \"Mumbo Jumbo.\"\n\nAfter bit/featured roles in Hinter dem Rampenlicht - All that jazz (1979), I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can (1982) and Die Ehre der Prizzis (1985), CCH earned cult status in the art-house film Out of Rosenheim (1987) (aka \"Bagdad Café\" in the US) as the offbeat owner of a roadside café. She continued to impress with support roles in Grüße aus Hollywood (1990), The Importance of Being Earnest (1992), an all-black version: as Miss Prism), Benny und Joon (1993), RoboCop 3 (1993), Sliver (1993), Ritter der Dämonen (1995),Im Körper des Feindes (1997), Funny Valentines (1999), The Devil in Miss Jones 6 (1999), Baby of the Family (2002), Rain (2008), Orphan - Das Waisenkind (2009), Avatar - Aufbruch nach Pandora (2009) (as the voice of Mo'at, and its sequels), My Girlfriend's Back (2010). Home Again (2012) (as a Jamaican) and Chroniken der Unterwelt - City of Bones (2013).\n\nPounder's prominence came, however, with television. Often cast as succinct, professional types (doctors, policewoman, judges) or characters with a variety of accents, she is known for her understated intensity and earned an Emmy nomination for her stint on the hospital drama Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994). She has also performed in a number of highly acclaimed topical mini-movie dramas, including Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), Common Ground (1990), Murder in Mississippi (1990), Little Girl Fly Away (1998), A Touch of Hope (1999), Boykott (2001), Redemption (2004) (as Winnie Mandela) for which a number of kudos have come her way.\n\nMillennium TV output includes regular/recurring roles on the series The Shield: Gesetz der Gewalt (2002) in which she earned an NAACP Award and Emmy nomination as Detective Claudette Wym; the social drama Ciencias del espacio (2008) as matriarch Mrs. Trainor, and Navy CIS: New Orleans (2014) as medical examiner Loretta Wade. She later found voice work in animated projects and video games.\n\nNorman Reedus was born in Hollywood, Florida. He is of Italian, English, Scottish and Irish descent. He is an accomplished photographer with several books of his photography published and continues to do art shows in galleries all around the world every year. His first novel was published in 2022 and was on the New York Times best seller list as well as the Los Angeles Times best seller list titled \"The Ravaged\". Reedus has a production company named Bigbaldhead, Inc. With his producing partner Amanda Verdon as well as a first look deal with AMC studios.\n\nNorman's first movie as an actor was Guillermo del Toro's horror thriller Mimic - Angriff der Killerinsekten (1997), where he played the character Jeremy. He has also played roles in the movies Floating (1997), Six Ways to Sunday (1997), Tödliche Gerüchte (2000), Blade II (2002) and Deuces Wild - Wild in den Straßen (2002). He also starred in the movies Red Canyon (2008), Robert Redford's Die Lincoln Verschwörung (2010), and John Hillcoat's Triple 9 (2016). Norman played the role of Murphy MacManus in the movie Der blutige Pfad Gottes (1999) opposite Sean Patrick Flanery and Willem Dafoe. He later reprised the role in the sequel Der blutige Pfad Gottes 2 (2009).\n\nHis directorial debut happened in 2005 for the multi-awarded short film on Miles Davis I Thought of You (2006).\n\nAs of 2010, he stars as Daryl Dixon on the AMC television series The Walking Dead (2010). The character was not originally in the comic book series of the same name, but was created specifically for Reedus by Frank Darabont. The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman has stated he feels \"absolutely blessed [Reedus] has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A great deal of Norman's portrayal of the character in the first season inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the second season. We love writing him and end up doing cool stuff with him.\"\n\nFionnula Flanagan was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. From an early age she grew up speaking both English and Irish on a daily basis. Her parents weren't native Irish speakers but wanted Fionnula and her four siblings to learn the language. Her mother used to say, \"A nation without a language is a nation without a soul\". Fionnula has said she will be forever grateful to them for that. She was educated at the Abbey Theatre School in Dublin and in Switzerland. She moved to Los Angeles in 1968 and lives with her husband, psychiatrist Dr. Garrett O'Connor, in Beverly Hills. Of her enormous body of work, including stage, television and film, she might be most well-known for James Joyce's Women (1985), in which she plays six different women who had a profound influence on James Joyce's life. Besides giving an award-winning performance, she also wrote, adapted and produced the piece for the stage, and subsequently as a feature film. She believes Joyce is the most important writer in the English language, most notably for \"Ulysses\", \"Finnegan's Wake\" and \"The Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man\". When she was growing up she thought the much lauded author was a good friend of her parents, because they were always saying, \"Joyce said this, Joyce said that\". When she was finally old enough to read Joyce for herself, the characters were like old friends.\n\nZoe Saldana was born on June 19, 1978 in Passaic, New Jersey, to Asalia Nazario and Aridio Saldaña. Her father was Dominican and her mother is Puerto Rican. She was raised in Queens, New York. When she was 10 years old, she and her family moved to the Dominican Republic, where they would live for the next seven years. While living there, Zoe discovered a keen interest in performance dance and began her training at the prestigious ECOS Espacio de Danza Dance Academy where she learned ballet as well as other dance forms. Not only did her training provide an excellent outlet for the enthusiastic and energetic youngster, it would also prove to be a fortunate precursor for the start of her professional acting career. At age 17, Zoe and her family moved back to the United States where her love for dance followed and an interest in theater performance became stronger.\n\nShe began performing with the Faces theater troupe which put on plays geared to provide positive messages for teens with themes dealing with issues such as substance abuse and sex. These performances not only gave her valuable experience but also a source of great pride knowing that she was making a difference in the lives of young people like herself. While performing with the Faces troupe and also the New York Youth Theater, Zoe was recruited for a talent agency and her dance training years before coupled with her acting experience greatly helped her land her first big screen role as Eva Rodriguez, the talented and headstrong ballet dancer in the film Center Stage (2000). Since her professional career began several years ago, Zoe's talent and determination have allowed her to be involved in blockbuster films and act with major actors, actresses and industry insiders at a pace that very few young professionals have experienced.\n\nZoe has not only held her own in major motion picture productions but gained the respect and praise from industry insiders such as Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg and actors/actresses such as Tom Hanks, Bernie Mac, Keira Knightley, Ashton Kutcher, Kirsten Dunst and Orlando Bloom. According to many of her co-stars, producers and directors, the sky is no limit for this young star who has incredible range, intense concentration, and a steely determination to be involved with projects that challenge her professionally with wide-ranging subject matters and characters. Just to ask practically anyone who she has worked for or with about her, glowing comments abound and earned friendships and respect are readily revealed. A star has been born, and growing every day.\n\nGaunt character actor Brad Dourif was born Bradford Claude Dourif on March 18, 1950 in Huntington, West Virginia. He is the son of Joan Mavis Felton (Bradford) and Jean Henri Dourif, a French-born art collector who owned and operated a dye factory. His father died when Dourif was three years old, after which his mother married Bill Campbell, a champion golfer, who helped raise Brad, his brother, and his four sisters. From 1963 to 1965, Dourif attended Aiken Preparatory School in Aiken, South Carolina, where he pursued his interests in art and acting. Although he briefly considered becoming a professional artist, he finally settled on acting as a profession, inspired by his mother's participation as an actress in community theater.\n\nBeginning in school productions, he progressed to community theater, joining up with the Huntington Community Players, while attending Marshall University of Huntington. At age 19, he quit his hometown college and headed to New York City, where he worked with the Circle Repertory Company. During the early 1970s, Dourif appeared in a number of plays, off-Broadway and at Woodstock, New York, including Milos Forman who cast him in Einer flog über das Kuckucksnest (1975). Although this film is frequently cited as his film debut, in fact, Dourif made his first big-screen appearance with a bit part in Ein Supertyp haut auf die Pauke (1975). Nevertheless, his portrayal of the vulnerable Billy Bibbit in Forman's film was undoubtedly his big break, earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Acting Debut, a British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actor, and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nSkeptical of his instant stardom, Dourif returned to New York, where he continued in theater and taught acting and directing classes at Columbia University until 1988 when he moved to Hollywood. Despite his attempts to avoid typecasting, his intensity destined him to play eccentric or deranged characters, starting in Die Augen der Laura Mars (1978), John Huston's Der Ketzer (1979) (arguably his best performance to date), and Milos Forman's Ragtime (1981). Dourif then teamed up with director David Lynch for Der Wüstenplanet (1984) and Blue Velvet (1986). His high-strung style also served him well in a number of horror films, notably as the voice of the evil doll Chucky in Chucky - Die Mörderpuppe (1988) and its sequels.\n\nDourif broke from the horror genre with roles in Fatal Beauty (1987), Mississippi Burning - Die Wurzel des Hasses (1988), Geheimprotokoll (1990) and London schafft alle (1991). Recent film work includes the role of Grima Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Since his television debut in the PBS film The Mound Builders (1976), Dourif has made sporadic appearances on a number of television series, such as Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993), Babylon 5 (1993), Star Trek: Raumschiff Voyager (1995), Millennium: Fürchte deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst (1996) and Ponderosa (2001). He also appeared in the music video \"Stranger in Town\" (1984) by the rock band TOTO.\n\nRose McGowan is an American actress and director, known for her contribution to independent film. Since the age of nineteen, she has appeared in acclaimed films by Gregg Araki, Wes Craven, Brian De Palma, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. In 2014, her directorial debut Dawn (2014) was nominated for the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Rose Arianna McGowan was born on September 5, 1973 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, to American parents Terri and Daniel Patrick McGowan. She is the second eldest of six siblings, and has Irish, French, and English ancestry. As a young child, she was raised within the Italian chapter of the Children of God. During the early 1980s, her family severed ties with the community and migrated to Eugene, Oregon, USA. Following the divorce of her parents, Rose relocated to Gig Harbor, Washington, to live with her grandmother. At age 14, McGowan was accused of drug use by a family friend and committed to rehabilitation. She has consistently maintained the decision was unjustified. Upon release, she spent a year without a home and was emancipated from her parents by the age of 15. McGowan's career as an actor began with Generation der Verdammten (1995). Originally intended for Jordan Ladd, the character of Amy Blue was, coincidentally, awarded to McGowan by an associate of director Gregg Araki. For her performance, she was nominated at the 1995 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Debut Performance. Subsequently cast in Wes Craven's Scream - Schrei! (1996), she experienced further success when the project defied expectations to become one of the highest grossing films of the year. The innovative career of McGowan was overshadowed throughout much of the 1990s by her high-profile relationship with musician Brian Warner (aka Marilyn Manson). Strong performances in Der lange Weg der Leidenschaft (1997), Lewis & Clark & George (1997), Southie (1998) and Der zuckersüße Tod (1999) were largely unseen by the general public. When the relationship ended between Rose and Manson in 2001, she remarked: \"There is great love, but our lifestyle difference is, unfortunately, even greater\". Rose continued to work solidly, appearing in a string of soft-sounding studio and independent films. Performances from this period included: a political activist in Showtime's Killing Yard - Mörderischer Auftrag (2001), a grifter in Strange Hearts (2002) and a factory worker in \"Stealing Bess\" (aka Vacuums (2003)). She was re-introduced to the mainstream as Paige Matthews in Aaron Spelling's Charmed: Zauberhafte Hexen (1998), a popular television series for which she devoted five consecutive years.
