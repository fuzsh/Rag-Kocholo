Unfortunately, that is increasingly not the case. Unauthorized cell phone use in school is rampant in my district, as well as surrounding districts. The exponential growth in AI is taking cheating to another level, and social media distractions are having a tremendous impact on the learning process. I have a split schedule in my building. I teach half the day and I am the Dean for the other half. For students that compulsively violate the cell phone policy, we have them hand in their phones in the morning. I see students exhibit almost withdrawl-like symptoms when they do not have access to their phone. This is a crisis that is not being given the attention it needs.\n\nOn Thursday, May 30, 2024 7:56am\n\nIn response to Why banning cellphones in schools misses the point\n\nBetsy Warrior\n\nSo great to hear Stacey's long-term commitment to supporting those in need.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 28, 2024 3:57pm\n\nIn response to Neither naive nor cynical, Oscar winner Stacey Kabat ’85 reflects on her domestic-violence activism\n\nRosalie Aronoff\n\nI have the utmost confidence for this brilliant woman and enjoy listening to her on MSNBC.\n\nOn Monday, May 27, 2024 10:37pm\n\nIn response to ‘Well-nigh unshakable’ Joyce White Vance ’82 is one of Obama’s first U.S. attorneys\n\nHarlan Gary Lebow\n\ngreat person\n\nOn Saturday, May 25, 2024 9:25pm\n\nIn response to ‘Well-nigh unshakable’ Joyce White Vance ’82 is one of Obama’s first U.S. attorneys\n\nBruce Lyman\n\nThank you, Jay, for this review and reflection. Fun. One correction: The caption for the picture of the 1949 commencement at the Lewiston Armory states, \"Commencement was moved from the Chapel to the Lewiston Armory in 1949, seen here, and held there until 1970.\" Actually our class of '67 was the first to celebrate commencement in the alumni gym on campus, rather than the armory. Another first then was that Margaret Chase Smith, US Senator from Maine, was our commencement speaker, the first female to be so honored. More details about commencement venues and Senator Smith's address can be found in our 50th reunion book published in June, 2017, on or near page 216. Let me know if you'd like me to send you a pdf copy of it!

This matters because it gives you a chance to see whether you can trust your students or not and this is a good way to test that. in addition, if teachers allow the use of cellphones schools won’t have to pay for expensive laptops and kids can bring in their phones to use instead\n\nOn Friday, May 10, 2024 1:28pm\n\nIn response to Why banning cellphones in schools misses the point\n\nTrevor Jones\n\nI disagree with all of you because while cell phones can be used for bad, there is a lot of good i teach 7th grade and. i allow my students to do schoolwork and write down homework on their phones. the consequence is that if they can’t do that, they have to do their work on paper.

For example, you can do schoolwork on it and write down homework on it. This matters because people check their phones so if they write down homework in it then they'll see it. Another factor of that is if teachers allow the use of cellphones schools won't have to pay for laptops and kids can bring in their phones to use.\n\nOn Friday, May 10, 2024 1:15pm\n\nIn response to Why banning cellphones in schools misses the point\n\nJudy Owen\n\nA terrific, unifying and challenging speech by a wonderful and deserving new President.

I thought the Bates' eating experience was fantastic back in the 70s--I mean--yogurt! bagels!--but really it was pretty pedestrian compared to today. The huge array of choices, the emphasis on healthy/local/sustainable, the sophisticated design, the natural light--mealtimes are one of the top reasons I never miss reunions! But what hasn't changed, I'm so glad to see, is the warm, respectful relationship between staff and students and administration. That has always been one of the things I value and honor most about Bates.

If Bates is to become one of America's top ten Little Ivy League Colleges, it must reduce its student faculty ratio. Given an ideal on-campus student body of 1836 souls, a 9 to 1 ratio requires 20 additional teachers. an 8 to 1 ratio requires 45 additional teachers.

I spent but one year there and spent but one car ride with him. He did not drive as I remember and had interesting eyes unusual like a cat. He had a pleasant personality a certain open softness to it. He was curious but uncritical and unassuming. He appreciated a ride and a chance to observe . He certainly deserved to be treasured.

Most of the students had somewhat suspect high school experiences prior to arriving at Lakemont. It was there that my dorm parent, history teacher, and coach was a giant of a man, Jim Sutherland. Combining wisdom, a strong hand, and a ton of love, he and his wonderful wife Laurie, a caring and compassionate woman, set me straight and taught me about life and success. I'm in my 52nd year as a high school math teacher now, and not a day goes by when I don't think of Mr. Sutherland at some point.

I honed my skills there and we formed an informal Bates men's team that played all around the Lewiston-Auburn area with various associations like Lions Club. If no such facility is there currently, it is incomplete, in my view. At our 60th reunion in 2024, I will challenge any Batesie who thinks they can (and likely will) defeat an agile 82 year old man.

He begged us to let him play Youth Football which had just be started that year. Josh was in 8th grad. He was 4’10’’ and weighed 88 pounds. We really didn’t want him to play football but agreed when his pediatrician said that a kid like Josh who is muscular and agile, would be OK. The practice before the first game the coach came to our house and told us that there had been an accident at the field and that we should come immediately. When we got there Josh was on the ground with us ankle at a right angle to his leg. He had tackled a kid who was 125 pounds and his foot had gotten caught in the turf as the boy fell on his ankle. On the X-ray his tibia and fibula looked like they had been snapped in half. After surgery and about a 6 month recovery, he was pretty much recovered. We clearly didn’t let him play high school football. He played trumpet in the band and was miserable. When he attended the University of Pennsylvania, he learned that there was a Light Weight football program. The weight limit was 165 lbs. By this time Josh was 5’8” and weighed 160 lbs. He announced that he was playing. This is a varsity sport at Penn with full equipment, tackle and a league with Army,Navy,Princeton, and Cornell. Josh was the only player on the team who had not played high school football. By his junior year he was starting at cornerback and made honorable mention all league both junior and senior years. I thought that this story was very reminiscent of Johnny Walker’s. Josh is currently Sports Anchor for WCVB in Boston.

I am emotional about Hawaii. After 9/11, I needed a spiritual experience. A 'trip-a-day' giveaway promotion on the radio motivated me to purchase a ticket for the 5-hour plane flight from LA. I found what I needed in Hawaii. I was able to extend my stay. From March 18th to June 5, 2002, I explored the wonder. Seven months later, I moved to Honolulu, and with the help of excellent social workers, I was situated in a nice apartment on Kapiolani Blvd. A rehab specialist offered me a choice of work or school. In December of 2006, I graduated with a master's in educational foundations and left in June of 2007. Friends I met back then have either moved away--some became homeless. The fire on Maui pulls at my heartstrings. The Lord told me to call about a ticket. Delta had two seats left on Flight 2967 for 11/7/23. My income after expenses is just under $800--so I haven't been able to visit since 2015, but have kept in touch with two friends, brothers, lifelong residents, who are among friends who became homeless. As a Christian, former teacher, and work in outreach ministry, I am returning to dedicate my services in whatever ways are helpful. I will place an add in the Honolulu paper next month with a hope of exchanging housekeeping services for a room--which (13 years in Myrtle Beach) frees my income up to help the poor and pay tithes. I love the sacrificial life the Lord has placed me in since my older son, Chris Jones, at 47, died on 12/28/21. I am active on FB, and welcome your input--any advice on how to best channel my efforts for this missionary endeavor. I also read the article on Benjamin Mays and how Bates offered a rare opportunity--which enabled him to develop his talents where most expedient. He blazed a trail of influence that helped Dr. Martin Luther King and others spearhead the civil rights movement. I am eternally grateful--for I have experienced how a nurturing atmosphere can lead one to better improve 'choices' and apprise one of better judgment. Thank you for this opportunity to comment. Yours, in Christ, Joann Jones.\n\nOn Sunday, September 24, 2023 5:56am\n\nIn response to After the Maui firestorm, student and alum insights and ‘pricing Hawaiians out of paradise’\n\nJon Olsen Bates, 1964\n\nThank you for this report and its aloha.

For their 50th reunion, the class also raised a sizeable amount for that time. When my dad passed in 2017, we found my grandfather's old reunion cap with \"27\" on it. I came to work at Bates, and have felt a family connection ever present through the \"Mouthpiece\". It was great to see the reconstruction work being made with more durable modern materials (it should remain standing for a much longer time). I have set a goal to witness the commencement of the Class of 2027 (this year's incoming 1st Year class), standing by the \"Mouthpiece\" while wearing my grandfather's very old cap!

I was born in 1946 at St Mary’s in Lewiston, Me. Two years later we moved to Fort Kent, Me. where it was predominantly a French speaking community. My parents both spoke French in the home, and when I started kindergarten all my peers also spoke French. However, we were not allowed to speak it at school. They thought it would hamper our chances of learning English which was thought to be the language of success. I loved my maternal language and ended up teaching it in a small school in Northern ME. in the early 70’s. Most of my students spoke French at that time. However, when I retired in 2000, very few students could speak French. There were too many English influences in their daily lives. It’s really sad, because French is such a beautiful language.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 23, 2023 10:16am\n\nIn response to An honors thesis creates a French connection between Martha Coleman ’23 and shuttle driver Herb Saucier\n\nDenise guay\n\nVery interesting I was brought up in z Lewiston studied French for 8 yrs I don’t use it now .

If \"Macedonians\" existed back then as Danforth claims.. then it follows the US was complicit in their attempted genocide since it was the US that armed Greeks and claimed no such ethnic group exists.. Danforth has been harassing Greeks since the mid 80s when he had a bad experience with that he calls a Greek \"nationalist\". He narrates Greeks as \"imagined community\" and not \"real\" Greeks... .but then flip-flops on his own alleged principles with other groups that have less in common with their claimed roots then Greeks do. Gellner for Greeks. Smith's primordialism a-la-cart for others. Danforth for years lobbied on behalf of former Yugoslavian nationalist extremists by framing their cause as \"human rights\" and Greek as \"nationalists\". Low and behold, most of the former Yugoslavians he supported now claim not to be Slavs but apparently antihellenic founders of the Hellenistic period. This in itself defied basic common sense. They use this obvious fake history to promote what they call \"United Macedonia\" that they claim includes 1/4 of Greece.. This behaviour continues even post Prespa. They use the name \"Macedonia\" to promote irredentism against Greece exactly like they did when they still self-identified as ethnic Bulgarians \"Macedonians' living in Vardar Yugoslavia. So where are all the self-proclaimed \"human rights defenders\" like Danforth's righteous condemnations of Skopje like once Greeks were condemned? Hear that? That's the sound of silence made by pretentious bigots that lack the integrity to admit they made a mistake recognizing extreme nationalists in Skopje as \"Macedonians\". Greeks were clearly right to object to recognition on grounds they would abuse the name. Unfortunately Danforth and anyone else that lobbied for Skopje pretend Greeks were wrong. When someone lies in the present their lectures on ethics and the past lose any shred of credibility\n\nOn Friday, July 15, 2022 2:52pm\n\nIn response to Danforth’s ‘Children of the Greek Civil War’ receives prestigious book prize\n\nRichard Welsh\n\nYes, I remember that short term well. My job was at Jefferson Park MEND. I ended up with at least one night meeting I had to go to. That was interesting to say the least. I have over a hundred pictures that I took but can't find out how to post them.\n\nOn Monday, July 4, 2022 11:33am\n\nIn response to A 50th Reunion alumnus recalls a seminal Short Term trip to East Harlem in 1970\n\nAdak Whidbey\n\nWhat a fine group of professors -- my colleagues for many years. I wish them well in retirement. I am certainly enjoying mine! Best, Drake Bradley Professor Emeritus Experimental Psychology\n\nOn Tuesday, June 21, 2022 5:15pm\n\nIn response to Bates celebrates retiring professors for their ‘persistence and care, grace and humility’\n\nJay Burns\n\nThank you Judy! Yes, it was one of the dandiest...yet! — Jay Burns\n\nOn Friday, June 3, 2022 2:11pm\n\nIn response to ‘Be someone who builds trust,’ Dr. Nirav Shah tells seniors at 156th Bates College Commencement\n\nJudith Ann Marden\n\nSuch a powerful Commencement! Could be the best in the 52 I've experienced (yes, I just added them up...I've missed only a few!). What Dr. Shah said about \"building trust\" ...we all needed to hear that. Let's try again.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 31, 2022 2:08pm\n\nIn response to ‘Be someone who builds trust,’ Dr. Nirav Shah tells seniors at 156th Bates College Commencement\n\nJon\n\nI really enjoyed this article, as I had never heard of him. Inspiring indeed. Jon Olsen, track man, Bates '64\n\nOn Friday, March 4, 2022 1:35am\n\nIn response to Frank Keaney, Class of 1911, the chemist and coach who reinvented the sport of basketball\n\nJudith Ann Marden\n\nActually, Senator Nate Libby '07 lit the torch in 2020, when Governor Mills couldn't do it at the last minute--so Jared is the second Bates alum since Muskie. Thanks to Jared and Charlie for getting the job done! Great pictures!\n\nOn Saturday, February 19, 2022 8:58am\n\nIn response to Video: Scenes (and behind the scenes) of Puddle Jump 2022\n\nMarge Davis\n\nThese are brilliant and funny and meaningful! Congratulations to all the designers and models for this light-hearted message about waste. And to everyone else: Unless you are recycling obsessed like me, take the advice about recycling just beverage cans/bottles and clean paper/cardboard. They account for most of the marketable volume and value in the residential waste stream, and the other materials can indeed do more harm than good.\n\nOn Friday, November 19, 2021 3:52pm\n\nIn response to Slideshow: Students’ dazzling Trashion Show outfits — and a professor\n\nElizabeth Phillips\n\nHi! The campus event featured in the photographs, a roundtable on racial justice and housing inequity, was organized by Diana Zhou and Prof. Elizabeth Phillips. Can you please credit and tag our work?\n\nOn Saturday, October 30, 2021 12:26pm\n\nIn response to Professors, inspired by a Bates play, offer lessons in American redlining and racism\n\nAndy Baker\n\nWow, This brings a smile to my face, and a little mist to the eye. I first met Gene when I was visiting campus as a high school senior. I had his Freshman seminar, 'Anatomy of a few small machines' in 1987. He is truly a Bates legend!\n\nOn Thursday, October 21, 2021 9:14pm\n\nIn response to Video: Gene Clough goes skydiving\n\nsusanmelander\n\nMy guess. Fran K. (Something).\n\nOn Wednesday, October 20, 2021 9:06pm\n\nIn response to Frank? Fran K.? What’s in a name found in a Hathorn classroom\n\nNoah Petro\n\nGene had such a monumental impact on my career. I’m thrilled he got to experience zero g for a short while, and for that brief moment got to live a dream he’s had for much of his life!\n\nOn Friday, October 15, 2021 6:57pm\n\nIn response to Video: Gene Clough goes skydiving\n\nKirk Read\n\nThere are so many wonderful things about this story I don't know where to begin. Gene was so attentive and present for so many students and alums in so many ways. Thank you Sylvia and all for your tireless devotion to this wonderful Bates legend!\n\nOn Friday, October 15, 2021 1:24pm\n\nIn response to Video: Gene Clough goes skydiving\n\nJudith Ann Marden\n\nWonderful!! Coincidentally, Chris Kohler, former President of the Bates Outing Club in 1983, just asked me when the BOC ran its first skydiving trip. We were able to find minutes saying that the first one was organized in 1978, but had to be canceled on account of rain. Thanks to Ellie van Gemeren '13, the idea was revived during her BOC Presidency, and I was lucky enough to go with a group of students in October 2015. Couldn't agree more: Skydiving is the BEST way to appreciate Maine's fall foliage!\n\nOn Thursday, October 14, 2021 4:43pm\n\nIn response to Video: Gene Clough goes skydiving\n\nHenry Lyons\n\nThis is the kind of article that reminds me why I love Bates so much. Thank you.\n\nOn Tuesday, October 5, 2021 9:40am\n\nIn response to 18 items in the Bates library’s lost and found on Sept. 29, 2021\n\nJudith Ann Marden\n\nWonderful story and pictures!

Bravo, Ralph Sylvester! I LOVED the Den. But this says the customers today are mostly staff and faculty. Where are students eating between mealtimes at Commons?\n\nOn Friday, August 20, 2021 10:57pm\n\nIn response to Meet the 97-year old World War II vet who helped reopen the Bobcat Den\n\nAlex Wood\n\nThe annual summer book list never disappoints as a useful and enjoyable compilation. Besides discovering a couple of ‘must reads’, I particularly like that the recommendations came from every facet of the Bates community.

When was it removed? Should it be restored? Bates only has 1 cupola and 1 weather vane. Is that true ?\n\nOn Thursday, June 17, 2021 10:52pm\n\nIn response to Then and Now: Bates buildings and places, Reunion 2021 edition\n\nDavid Chick\n\nNice play of creativity...\n\nOn Monday, May 24, 2021 10:02am\n\nIn response to Video: Bowie meets the Bard through director Deon Custard ’21\n\nDenice\n\nLauryn, I thank you for writing this and allowing for its publication. My son will attend Bates this Fall as a Black student-athlete in one of the noted stereotypically non-Black sports. I am glad there is an Athletes of Color Coalition. I am not sure my son is aware. Although the journey is his, it is true that one's identity is influenced by the company one keeps. I would love to read your thesis. Your parents must be so proud of you. I wish you all the best. Kind regards, Denice\n\nOn Friday, May 21, 2021 1:48pm\n\nIn response to ‘Embracing my Blackness,’ by swimmer Lauryn Boucree ’21\n\nTommy Sheils\n\nHey thats my contact lens holder!

Morin clay and Bates clay are roughly the same \"species,\" so I think bricks could have been made from the Bonney stuff, although clay composition always varies from site to site.\n\nOn Thursday, February 25, 2021 4:42pm\n\nIn response to Clay play: Learn about the stubborn and slick earth beneath Bates\n\nDavid Chick\n\nI believe that it was Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts where I saw a Colonial Period display which touted Lewiston pottery when I took my kids there (dare I say over a couple decades ago). When I inquired, I was informed that Lewiston was well known for its clay quality for pottery and brick during Colonial times...\n\nOn Thursday, February 25, 2021 3:09pm\n\nIn response to Clay play: Learn about the stubborn and slick earth beneath Bates\n\nGene ORourke\n\nThank you for this wonderful story. I always enjoy insights into the construction process. But I'm left wondering... what happened to the Bonney Center clay? Where did those trucks go? And is Bonney clay very different from Morin clay? In Bates' early days, would local clay have been suitable for bricks made on-site?\n\nOn Thursday, February 25, 2021 2:31pm\n\nIn response to Clay play: Learn about the stubborn and slick earth beneath Bates\n\nDavid Chick\n\nTo me, Hank Aaron is the real deal \"Home Run King\". I remember seeing him play at Fenway when I was a kid. It was the year (1973) he was closing in and expected to surpass Babe Ruth's long held record. From the child perspective, he did not look the bulked up part, which made it even more appealing. Boston fans are notoriously rude, but there was also a definite racist tone with some of the yelling. A full bore fist fight broke out in the stands near us, and my parents shielded us as best they could. The way my parents spoke to us of the obvious societal conflicts related to racial tensions enhanced the admiration of Hank Aaron's accomplishment. If memory serves me correctly, he was intentionally walked in that game, and I was disappointed. I can't even image what it took for him to make his wake in the world in his lifetime. Heroic!\n\nOn Tuesday, February 2, 2021 10:12am\n\nIn response to Recalling the late Henry Aaron’s friendship with Benjamin Mays\n\nYahya Shamekhi\n\nThanks for the article.

Reading this is an interesting \"deja vu\" for parts which I did not have much of the rest of the story at the time. Life intersections...\n\nOn Monday, January 18, 2021 9:48am\n\nIn response to 30 years ago: Gulf War, Angela Davis, and a memorable night\n\nGrant Reynolds\n\nWe all have different experiences, don't we? I was in an Air Force Learjet that evening, coming back to Washington from a meeting in New Mexico. We heard from Air Force dispatch that the planes had been launched from Saudi Arabia to bomb Baghdad. The passengers broke into cheers and cries of 'it's about time.\" Some of the 8 passengers were WW II pilots, 5 or 6 were Air Force officers. I was a civilian lawyer for the Secretary of the Air Force, and the meeting had to do with legal arrangements for basing Air Force fighters at a lightly used civilian airport. Very different place that evening than the Bates Chapel. Wish I'd been there instead of in the jet.

We floThe folks left of neoliberalism were also happy with Fla. raising minimum wages to 15.00 dollars an hour, and other successes on referendum questions.

Bates quotes from here and there: Oct. 30, 2020\n\nDavid Chick\n\nI've encountered them often in the brooks and rivers around the area. A co-worker once came in contact with a rather large one in the Androscoggin and was convinced it was some kind of freakish byproduct of the past pollution, and thought it was a \"river tumor\".

Williamson, described in his 2007 obituary as “a charismatic catalyst of Bates community”, would surely be proud of what Bates has become. Although truth be told, I think he was proud of Bates then - just thought, like all great teachers, it needed a little prodding and exhortation!
