        "text": "I thought Rick Hearst left GL to try his luck elsewhere. They recast him (and not too well) midstory.\n\nI do agree with everything you said.\n\nThe cast photo makes me sad. Some of the best actors in the history of anything and yet they've spent most of the year playing second fiddle to horrors like Jeffrey, Marina, Mallet.\n\nThe one thing I'm grateful for is that characters I treasured like Billy and Vanessa were never destroyed by the writers. Unlike many other names who got me hooked on soaps, I can see them fade away with nothing but fond, happy memories.\n\nOh, heavens! By the name, let me guess... he showed his pecs more than he show his acting talent.\n\nAnd the reason I say that about the name is due to the fact that I created a character with the last name of St. John... and he's nothing more than a hunky piece of meat of a boytoy. I knew exactly what I was doing by naming him Saint Anything.\n\nAnyway, I knew there used to be black ACTORS (Nia Long, Amelia Marshall...). But from the folksy, midwestern \"feel\" this show was trying to go for presently, I didn't expect to see anything non-Caucasian.\n\nJessica Leccia was photoshopped into this cast picture. This photo was taken within a day of when she gave birth to her daughter Ivy. She is very slim in this pic so it was an old picture.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure why but Justin Deas is not in the final photo. They could have photoshopped him in as well but on another board it was speculated that he doesn't do any publicity for the show.\n\nYou can tell a lot of Photoshopping was done. It looks like they shot four separate groups, plus some other waifs and strays who could make it, and then pasted it all together. It still looks really nice, though...\n\nAnd to make that inevitable comment...\n\nThat photoshoot clearly cost more to produce than the last year of Guiding Light did...\n\nVictor St. Lawrence has been a lot better over the past year, even if that's not saying much.\n\nAgain, not saying much, but GL had more story for black characters this year than they had since probably somewhere around 1996. GL from the late 80s to the mid 90s always tried to keep up a strong black presence, even though Gilly and David were often misused and underused. Laibson/McTavish destroyed the Grants, but it was Rauch who seemed to put the real freeze on black characters, and that never really changed, minus a few tokens (Victoria Spaulding, the Boudreaux family where the only one we ever saw for more than a few days a month was Mel) even after he left.\n\nI still get angry when I think about what they did to Gilly."
