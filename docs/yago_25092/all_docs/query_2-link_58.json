Pappas Humanitarian Award - Frank Garcia\n\nHonoree Video\n\nCommunity activist and cultural worker, Frank Garcia has resided in Hayward since 1987. He is a founding member of La Alianza de Hayward and remains active in the organization today. He has over forty years of experience as an educator and community leader. Sixteen of those years have been spent as Executive Director of the national, award-winning University of California - Puente Project. Since 1981, The project’s mission has been to increase the number of educationally disadvantaged students who enroll in four year colleges and universities, earn a degree, and return to the community as leaders and mentors for future generations. The program has helped hundreds of thousands of students across the state and was started here in Hayward at Chabot College by Mr. Garcia.\n\nPrior to Puente, Frank worked as an Assistant Professor of Education at various universities, including San Francisco State, Washington State, Cal State University, Fresno and the University of San Diego in Guadalajara.

She created Raising Leaders in Hayward (RLH) – a series of workshops held in City Hall for young adults who attend Hayward Adult, Brenkwitz Continuation High, and Burke Academy schools. The workshops focus on pathways to success and engage leaders from City departments and beyond. In its first year, RLH served 100+ students helping them complete 400+ school credits. Graduates also completed paid internships and some have been hired into full time jobs. The Workshop series is expanding into Juvenile Hall and Davida’s internship model has been embraced by Supervisor Valle, who authorized 40 new paid internships.\n\nSix years ago, Davida launched an annual Thanksgiving Dinner because one of her students did not have anyone to celebrate with.

Team members have contributed nearly 20,000 hours of volunteer service cleaning up nearly 300,000 gallons debris throughout Hayward.
