Frank Scully (1892-1964) was an American author and columnist for Variety magazine. In 1950 he published a controversial best-selling book titled Behind the Flying Saucers. In it, Scully described an account by oilman Silas M. Newton and scientist "Dr. Gee" of a flying saucer crash in the New Mexican desert. The saucer's purported occupants were all dead. Scully described the space craft as constructed on the "System of Nines" and that it flew using magnetic propulsion. His book was translated into multiple languages and sold more that 10 million copies. It was a significant contributor to the flying saucer craze of the 1950s and 60s. His papers contain documents that illustrate that craze, including newsletters, magazine articles, comics, lecture ads, and more.

"Straith letter" to George Adamski, December 1957

In 1957 George Adamski, a prominent self-claimed UFO contactee, received a letter signed by "R.E. Straith," who purposted to be from the U.S. State Department's "Cultural Exchange Committee." The letter claimed that federal officials knew of Adamski speaking to extraterrestrials in 1952, and highly placed U.S. officials planned to corroborate it publicly. Adamski used the letter to support his claims. Many years later, in 1985, ufologist James W. Moseley revealed he and friend Gray Barker had written the letter as a prank.
