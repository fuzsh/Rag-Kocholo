The following observations can be made about those by-elections:\n\nthere have been 158 by-elections, an average of 3.5 per parliament.\n\nthe nine by-elections held during the current, 45th, Parliament is the second highest number in an individual parliament—seven of these related to dual citizenship; 10 by-elections—nine caused by the deaths of members—were held during the 20th Parliament (1951–1954)\n\nthe average number of nominations has grown over the years from 2.2 per by-election to 11.5 per by-election\n\nin only four cases was a by-election contested by just a single candidate\n\nan increasing tendency has been for governments to avoid contesting by-elections in their opponents’ safe seats\n\nin only ten cases have the opposition party failed to contest a by-election\n\neighty-three of the by-elections followed the resignation of the member, 68 members died in office, there have been six voided elections, and one MP was expelled from the House\n\nsince 1949 resignations account for over two-thirds of by-elections and over half the resignations have occurred in safe seats\n\non 36 occasions the party complexion of a seat has altered at a by-election; five of the losses have been by the opposition of the day\n\nthe average two-party preferred swing against the government of the day has been 3.8 per cent and\n\nsince 1949 the largest two-party swing against a government (16.1 per cent) occurred against Labor in Canberra in 1995. The largest swing to a government (16.2 per cent) occurred to the Coalition in McPherson in 1981.\n\nContents\n\nExecutive summary\n\nParty abbreviations\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe organisation of

The by-election followed the death of the sitting member, William Groom. The most recent by-election was held in the electorate of Wentworth (NSW) on 20 October 2018 following the resignation of the sitting member and deposed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThe reasons why by-elections have been held\n\nOf the 158 by-elections, 68 (43.0 per cent) have occurred because of the death of the member, 83 (52.5 per cent) as the result of the resignation of the member, six (3.8 per cent) because of voided elections, and one (0.6 per cent) because of the expulsion of the member for Kalgoorlie from the House in 1920.\n\nOver time, the reasons for by-elections have altered quite markedly:\n\nfrom 1901 to 1979, 61.5 per cent of all by-elections were brought about by death and\n\nby contrast, since 1980, 88.9 per cent of all by-elections have been brought about by resignation.\n\nTable 1: vacancies brought about by resignation and death\n\nYears Vacancy due to death\n\n(%) Vacancy due to resignation\n\n(%) Other\n\n(%) 1901–1979 61.5 33.7 4.8 Since 1980 7.4 88.9 3.7\n\nThe following graph further illustrates the changing pattern in the reasons causing by-elections.\n\nFigure 1: reason for by-election, by decade\n\nOne factor contributing to this changing pattern is that members today enter the House of Representatives at a generally younger age than used to be the case. Of the 41 parliaments to 2005, the second quarter’s intake (1929–1951) was the oldest, averaging 48.3 years per new member. By contrast, the fourth quarter’s intake (1977–2005) was the youngest at 42.2 years per new member.[2] [3] Another factor is the greater preparedness of members to leave (resign from) Parliament—the cause of 79.6 per cent of by-elections since 1980—often to pursue another career.[4] This has been aided by a third factor, namely the general increase in longevity of Australians brought about by, among other things, better health care.[5]\n\nThe timing of by-elections\n\nSection 33 of the Australian Constitution confers on the Speaker of the House of Representatives the power to issue a writ for the election of a new member.[6] The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918—Part XIII specifies that the election (polling day) must be held between 33 and 58 days from the date the writ is issued.[7]\n\nThere is no prescribed time period within which a by-election writ must be issued and, in fact, there is no accepted view as to the period that should elapse between vacancy and polling day.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, this has not become a matter of any long-term political debate, allowing governments a great deal of freedom in the setting of by-election dates. The length of time from a vacancy until polling day has, therefore, varied considerably, with the maximum number of days being the 82 days for Moreton in 1983, and the minimum being the 17 days for East Sydney in 1903.[8] The total elapsed time from vacancy to election has increased since 1901. Between 1901 and 1949, the average was 40.3 days, whereas during the period 1949 to 2018 the average has been 52.7 days. The average figure for all by-elections has been 48.1 days.\n\nIdeally, by-elections are held as early as possible after a seat becomes vacant, ‘so that the electors are not left without representation any longer than is necessary’.[9] In fact, such a consideration is occasionally pushed aside by short-term political factors. On 22 October 1982 the Member for Flinders, Phillip Lynch, resigned his seat. The Speaker fixed 4 December as the date for a by-election, but also declared that there would be a delay of almost three weeks before the writs for the by-election would be issued. According to Anne Summers, this gave the Fraser Government the option of calling a general election for 4 or 11 December.[10] The by-election could, therefore, have been pushed aside; although a double dissolution election was eventually held on 5 March 1983.\n\nIn the cases of the 22 by-elections held during 2000–2018, the delay between the date of the seat becoming vacant[11] and the date of the issuing of the writ varied considerably. The 45 days for Griffith and the 40 days for Gippsland contrasted with the issuing of writs in under a week for by-elections in Ryan, Lyne, North Sydney, New England, Bennelong and Batman.\n\nThe variation allowed in regard to by-election dates is thus an anomaly in an electoral system that is generally highly regulated.\n\nTable 2: by-elections, 2000–2018\n\nDivision Held by Date of\n\nvacancy Date of writ Delay in issuing\n\nwrit Elapsed time\n\nfrom vacancy\n\nto by-election Isaacs (Vic) ALP 14.06.00 30.06.00 16 days 59 days Ryan (Qld) LP 05.02.01 09.02.01 4 days 40 days Aston (Vic) LP 24.04.01 01.06.01 38 days 81 days Cunningham (NSW) ALP 16.08.02 16.09.02 31 days 64 days Werriwa (NSW) ALP 21.01.05 14.02.05 24 days 57 days Gippsland (Vic) LP 09.04.08 19.05.08 40 days 80 days Lyne (NSW) LP 30.07.08 04.08.09 5 days 38 days Mayo (SA) LP 14.07.08 04.08.09 21 days 54 days Bradfield (NSW) LP 19.10.09 30.10.09 11 days 47 days Higgins (Vic) LP 19.10.09 30.10.09 11 days 47 days Griffith (Qld) ALP 22.11.13 06.01.14 45 days 78 days Canning (WA) LP 21.07.15 17.08.15 27 days 60 days North Sydney (NSW) LP 23.10.15 26.10.15 3 days 43 days New England (NSW) NP 27.10.17 27.10.17 0 days 36 days Bennelong (NSW) LP 11.11.17 13.11.17 2 days 35 days Batman (Vic) ALP 01.02.18 07.02.18 6 days 44 days Braddon (Tas) ALP 10.05.18 15.06.18 36 days 79 days Fremantle (WA) ALP 10.05.18 15.06.18 36 days 79 days Longman (Qld) ALP 10.05.18 15.06.18 36 days 79 days Perth (WA) ALP 10.05.18 15.06.18 36 days 79 days Mayo (SA) CntreAll 11.05.18 15.06.18 35 days 78 days Wentworth (NSW) LP 31.08.18 17.09.18 17 days 50 days\n\nAppendix 4 provides details of the timing of all by-elections held between September 1901 and October 2018. It also shows the number of days elapsed between the seat becoming vacant and the by-election date, the number of days elapsed since the previous general election, and the number of days between the by-election and the next general election.\n\nVacancies for which no by-election held\n\nThere have been 20 occasions when the Speaker has, in fact, declined to issue such a writ for a by-election due to a pending general election. The longest period a seat has been without a member prior to a general election was 128 days in the case of Hindmarsh in 1909–10. The shortest period was the 39 days between 13 August 1940, when three MPs were killed in a plane crash, and the election of 21 September 1940.\n\nThe situation regarding the last of these occasions—Wills, 1992–93—was the result of the by-election held in November 1992 subsequently being voided by the Court of Disputed Returns. The successful candidate, Phil Cleary, was found to be in breach of section 44(iv) of the Constitution and the Labor and Liberal candidates were found ineligible under section 44(i).\n\nBy-elections where members recontested\n\nThere have been 13 occasions where the previous member has recontested in a by-election. Of these, nine members have been successful in retaining their seat.\n\nThe successful members were in the seats: East Sydney 1903, Echuca 1907, Lindsay 1996, New England 2017, Bennelong 2017, Braddon 2018, Fremantle 2018, Longman 2018 and Mayo 2018.\n\nIn all but the first two of these by-elections the previous member was recontesting after either being found or resigning before being found invalidly elected by the Court of Disputed Returns.\n\nThe unsuccessful recontests were in: Melbourne 1904, Riverina 1904, Ballaarat 1920 and Kalgoorlie 1920.\n\nTable 3: vacancies for which no by-election was held, 1901–2018\n\nDivision Vacant Next election Days Hunter (NSW) 30.09.03 16.12.03 77 Indi (Vic) 12.10.06 12.12.06 61 Northern Melbourne (Vic) 13.10.06 12.12.06 60 Hindmarsh (SA) 06.12.09 13.04.10 128 East Sydney (NSW) 24.12.09 13.04.10 110 West Sydney (NSW) 06.09.28 17.11.28 72 Wimmera (Vic) 14.10.31 19.12.31 66 Martin (NSW) 05.06.34 15.09.34 102 Ballaarat (Vic) 31.07.34 15.09.34 46 Werriwa (NSW) 02.08.34 15.09.34 44 Henty (Vic) 13.08.40 21.09.40 39 Flinders (Vic) 13.08.40 21.09.40 39 Corangamite (Vic) 13.08.40 21.09.40 39 West Sydney (NSW) 14.08.46 28.09.46 45 Hindmarsh (SA) 14.08.46 28.09.46 45 McMillan (Vic) 14.10.55 10.12.55 57 Leichhardt (Qld) 11.10.58 22.11.58 42 Warringah (NSW) 03.08.66 26.11.66 110 Bonython (SA) 30.09.77 10.12.77 71 Wills (Vic) 25.11.92 13.03.93 108\n\nNumber of nominations\n\nThe 158 by-elections have been contested by an average of 5.3 candidates. Over the years, however, there has been a steady increase in the number of nominations.\n\nIn the 24 first-past-the-post cases between 1901 and October 1918 the average number of nominations was 2.2 per contest.\n\nIn the following 134 preferential voting cases there has been an average of 5.9 nominations per by-election:\n\nfrom the introduction of preferential voting in December 1918 to the end of the 1960s there was an average of 3.7 nominations per by-election\n\nthe 1970s and 1980s saw the first of two significant increases in candidate numbers, with 6.2 candidates per by-election over these decades\n\nthis was exceeded during the 1990s, with the average climbing to 8.1 candidates per contest and\n\nsince 2000 a further climb to 11.5 candidates per by-election has occurred.\n\nThe record number of nominations has occurred twice in by-elections: Wills (Vic) in 1992 and Bradfield (NSW) in 2009. In the 1992 Wills by-election 22 nominations were received to fill the seat vacated by former Prime Minister Hawke. The field of 22 candidates that contested the 2009 Bradfield by-election was inflated due to the presence of nine Christian Democratic Party candidates. The 2017 New England by-election had 17 nominations, the third highest on record.\n\nIn only four cases, or 2.6 per cent, was a by-election contested by just a single candidate: Kalgoorlie 1913, Dalley 1915, Wide Bay 1928 and Cunningham 1956.\n\nIn recent years there has been a tendency for governments to avoid contesting by-elections, especially in their opponents’ safe seats. Since 1990 the incumbent government has failed to contest 18 of the 36 by-elections held. In all cases bar one this has often meant an easy win to the party holding the seat. In the case of Cunningham in 2002, however, the absence of a Liberal candidate helped the Australian Greens candidate win the seat from the ALP.[12]\n\nTable 4: candidates per by-election\n\nYears By-elections Average number of\n\ncandidates Largest number of\n\ncandidates 1901–2018 158 5.3 22 (2 cases) 1901–1918 (First-past-the-post) 24 2.2 4 (Tasmania 1902) 1918–2018 (Preferential voting) 134 5.9 22 (2 cases) Preferential voting 1918–1929 15 3.1 5 (3 cases) 1930–1939 12 3.7 6 (Wilmot 1939) 1940–1949 7 4.0 7 (Wimmera 1946) 1950–1959 16 3.7 6 (3 cases) 1960–1969 22 3.9 5 (8 cases) 1970–1979 8 6.5 12 (Parramatta 1973) 1980–1989 18 6.1 12 (Lowe 1982) 1990–1999 14 8.1 22 (Wills 1992) 2000–2009 10 11.5 22 (Bradfield 2009) Since 2010 12 11.6 17 (New England 2017)\n\nBy contrast, apart from the 2015 by-election in North Sydney, the official Opposition has contested every by-election from Dalley in 1953. Since 1901 the Opposition has failed to contest ten, or 6.3 per cent, of by-elections: Darling Downs 1901, Melbourne 1904, Echuca 1907, Adelaide 1908, Dalley 1915, Echuca 1919, Wide Bay 1928, Balaclava 1929, Bradfield 1952 and North Sydney 2015.\n\nVoter turnout[13]\n\nDuring the period of voluntary voting (1901–1924) the average turnout for by-elections was just 56.7 per cent. The lowest figure was 15.1 per cent in East Sydney in 1903. Since the introduction of compulsory voting in 1924 the average by-election turnout figure has been 86.8 per cent. This contrasts with a 94.4 per cent turnout in general elections over that period.\n\nDuring the compulsory voting years there has been a slight fall in the by-election turnout figure. For the 62 contested by-elections prior to 1970 the turnout was 88.5 per cent; the turnout for the 62 by-elections since 1970 has been 85.2 per cent. The lowest turnout figure over the compulsory voting period has been 64.0 per cent in Perth 2018, just below the 66.0 per cent in Fremantle also in 2018. The previous lowest was 69.5 per cent in Wentworth in 1981.\n\nParty performance\n\nSeats lost at by-elections\n\nIn only 36 of the 158 by-elections (22.8 per cent) has a seat altered its party status.\n\nTable 5: seats lost at by-elections, 1901–2018\n\nDivision Government Sitting party Winning party Melbourne (Vic) 1904 Prot Prot ALP Riverina (NSW) 1904 ALP FT Prot Adelaide (SA) 1908 Prot Prot ALP Boothby (SA) 1911 ALP ALP Lib Grampians (Vic) 1915 ALP ALP Lib Wide Bay (Qld) 1915 ALP ALP Lib Swan (WA) 1918 Nat Nat ALP Corangamite (Vic) 1918 Nat Nat VFU Echuca (Vic) 1919 Nat Nat VFU Ballaarat (Vic) 1920 Nat Nat ALP Kalgoorlie (WA) 1920 Nat ALP Nat Maranoa (Qld) 1921 Nat ALP CP Wide Bay (Qld) 1928 Nat Nat CP Franklin (Tas) 1929 ALP Ind ALP Parkes (NSW) 1931 ALP ALP Nat East Sydney (NSW) 1932 UAP UAP LLab Darling Downs (Qld) 1936 UAP UAP CP Gwydir (NSW) 1937 UAP/CP CP ALP Wakefield (SA) 1938 UAP/CP UAP ALP Wilmot (Tas) 1939 UAP/CP UAP ALP Corio (Vic) 1940 UAP UAP ALP Henty (Vic) 1946 ALP Ind LP Flinders (Vic) 1952 LP/CP LP ALP Calare (NSW) 1960 LP/CP LP CP Dawson (Qld) 1966 LP/CP CP ALP Corio (Vic) 1967 LP/CP LP ALP Bass (Tas) 1975 ALP ALP LP Lowe (NSW) 1982 LP/NP LP ALP Adelaide (SA) 1988 ALP ALP LP Groom (Qld) 1988 ALP NP LP Wills (Vic) 1992 ALP ALP Ind Canberra (ACT) 1995 ALP ALP LP Ryan (Qld) 2001 LP/NP LP ALP Cunningham (NSW) 2002 LP/NP ALP Grn Lyne (NSW) 2008 ALP NP Ind Wentworth (NSW) 2018 LP/NP LP Ind\n\nNote: By the time of the Grampians by-election of 1917, the Liberal Party had been subsumed by the Nationalist Party.

Political parties and individual members seem to be well aware of the possible political consequences of losing a seat at a by-election, and thus try to ensure that by-elections caused by resignation occur only in relatively safe seats. For example, since 1949, of the 68 by-elections that were caused by the resignation of the sitting member, 15 have been in marginal seats (that is, seats requiring a swing of less than six per cent to change hands). By far the largest number of by-elections, 35, has occurred in safe seats (that is, seats requiring a swing of over ten per cent to change hands).\n\nTable 7: by-elections caused by resignation—safeness of seat, 1949–2018\n\nNumber Percentage Marginal 15 22.1 Fairly Safe 18 26.5 Safe 35 51.5 Total 68 100.0\n\nAnalysing by-election swings since 1949\n\nApart from a party’s success or defeat in a by-election, the most important aspect of a by-election is the swing that takes place. Conventional wisdom holds that there is usually a swing against the government of the day at a by-election. The success or otherwise of a government, opposition, or party leader at the by-election is often measured by the size of the swing in comparison with the average swing recorded in past by-elections. However, by-elections occur in varied and disparate electoral divisions, with different numbers and mixes of candidates and with a variety of local, state and national issues involved. It could, therefore, be argued that, given the variety of factors involved, there is no 'normal' by-election swing. By-elections are held in such varying circumstances that none can be regarded as typical, and it is generally agreed that any swing that occurs is usually explained by the special factors pertaining to each by-election.[16]\n\nBy-election swings can be calculated by comparing the first preference and two-party preferred votes received by the various parties at the by-election with the votes at the previous general election. The two-party preferred swing is more commonly used as it overcomes some of the difficulties inherent in using first preference swings. First preference swings can be affected by the number and nature of candidates and parties contesting the by-election when compared with the previous general election.\n\nAverage first preference and two-party preferred vote swings for by-elections held between 1949 and October 2018 are given below.[17] Swings cannot be calculated where one of the major parties (that is, ALP or LP/NP Coalition) did not stand a candidate at the by-election or the preceding general election, or where the division was uncontested at the by-election or the preceding general election.\n\nThe average two-party preferred swing against the government of the day in all by-elections held during the period 1949 to 2018 was 3.8 per cent. The swing against ALP governments (5.5 per cent) was somewhat higher than the swing against LP/NP Coalition governments (3.2 per cent) while the swing against the government of the day in government-held seats was 4.8 per cent. The average two-party preferred swing in by-elections caused by the death of the sitting member was just over half the swing in by-elections caused by the resignation of the member.\n\nAverage swings against governments\n\nTwo-party preferred swings at by-elections during the period have varied from an anti-government swing of 16.1 per cent in Canberra in 1995 to a swing of 16.2 per cent to the government in McPherson in 1981. The largest swing against an ALP Government was the Canberra figure, while the largest swing against a LP/(CP)NP Coalition Government was achieved when Gough Whitlam won Werriwa in 1952 with a 12.4 per cent swing.\n\nTwo-party preferred swings to the government of the day are a rare event in by-elections, with only 14 being recorded during the period. The largest swing to an ALP Government was in Wills in 1992 with a 5.9 per cent swing (although the ALP lost the seat to an independent candidate, Phil Cleary[18]) while the largest swing to a LP/NP Coalition Government was in McPherson, referred to above.\n\nAs the number of candidates contesting a by-election is generally larger than the number contesting the previous general election, first preference swings against the government tend to be higher than two-party preferred swings.\n\nTable 8: average swings against governments in by-elections, 1949–2018\n\nFirst preference\n\nper cent Two-party preferred\n\nper cent All by-elections 5.6 3.8 Government held seats 6.5 4.8 LP/NP Governments 4.7 3.2 ALP Governments 8.2 5.5 By-elections caused by death 3.6 2.6 By-elections caused by resignation 7.1 4.7\n\nTable 9: two-party preferred swings, by-elections, 1949–2018\n\nALP Government LP/NP Government continued Division Swing (%) Division Swing (%) Parramatta 1973 -6.6 Calare 1960 +1.0 Bass 1975 -14.6 Higinbotham 1960 -9.2 Wannon 1983 -1.5 Batman 1962 n.a.

By contrast, John Forrest (Swan 1918), had enjoyed a much longer Commonwealth career, which included several ministries, with four periods as treasurer.\n\nFuture prime ministers\n\nSeven future Prime Ministers entered the House of Representatives via by-elections. For Stanley Melbourne Bruce (Flinders 1918), Harold Holt (Fawkner 1935), Arthur Fadden (Darling Downs 1936), Gough Whitlam (Werriwa 1952) and Tony Abbott (Warringah 1994) this saw their entry into Parliament for the first time. James Scullin (Yarra 1922) had already served a term during 1910–1913, while John Gorton (Higgins 1968) had recently retired from the Senate.\n\nThe exiting of prime ministers\n\nThe exiting from Parliament of 17 of the 30 MPs who have held the office of Prime Minister has been the trigger for a by-election:\n\nin two cases (Wilmot 1939 and Fremantle 1945) the by-election followed the death of the Prime Minister while in office—Joe Lyons and John Curtin, respectively\n\nthe by-election in Higgins in 1968 was caused by the disappearance, while swimming off Cheviot Beach in Victoria, of Prime Minister Harold Holt\n\nalthough Ben Chifley (Macquarie 1951) and William ‘Billy’ Hughes (Bradfield 1952) remained in Parliament after losing office, both died while still MPs causing by-elections\n\nsome early Prime Ministers resigned from Parliament to assume other positions. Andrew Fisher (Wide Bay 1915) and Joseph Cook (Parramatta 1921) both became Australian High Commissioner in London. Stanley Melbourne Bruce had lost his seat in 1929, returned to the House in 1931, and left Parliament for good when he was appointed as Resident Minister in London (Flinders 1933) and\n\nsince the departure of Robert Menzies (Kooyong 1966) only three former Prime Ministers have not caused a by-election by their departure from the House of Representatives—John Gorton (who unsuccessfully stood as an independent for the Senate in 1975), John Howard (who lost his seat in 2007) and Julia Gillard (who retired just prior to the 2013 election). The exceptional circumstances surrounding Harold Holt (Higgins 1968) is mentioned above. John McEwen (Murray 1971), William McMahon (Lowe 1982) and Gough Whitlam (Werriwa 1978) all remained in Parliament for a time after ceasing to be Prime Minister before resigning from the House. By contrast, Malcolm Fraser (Wannon 1983), Bob Hawke (Wills 1992), Paul Keating (Blaxland 1996), Kevin Rudd (Griffith 2014) —Kevin Rudd’s resignation came after his loss of office for the second time—and, most recently, Malcolm Turnbull (Wentworth 2018) all resigned their seats very soon after their loss of office.\n\nFuture leaders of the Opposition\n\nSeven future leaders of the Opposition have been elected to the House of Representatives at by-elections: Stanley Melbourne Bruce (Flinders 1918), James Scullin (Yarra 1922), Arthur Fadden (Darling Downs 1936), Gough Whitlam (Werriwa 1952) and Tony Abbott (Warringah 1994), who all went on to become Prime Minister, and Andrew Peacock (Kooyong 1966) and Mark Latham (Werriwa 1994).\n\nThe exiting of leaders of the Opposition\n\nOf the sixteen leaders of the Opposition who have not become Prime Minister, the passing from Parliament of eight has caused a by-election:\n\nFrank Tudor (Yarra 1922) died in office and\n\nHerbert Vere Evatt (Hunter 1960), Billy Snedden (Bruce 1983), Bill Hayden (Oxley 1988), Andrew Peacock (Kooyong 1994), John Hewson (Wentworth 1995), Mark Latham (Werriwa 2005) and Brendan Nelson (Bradfield 2009) all left Parliament between general elections.\n\nFamily matters\n\nOccasionally retiring MPs have been replaced by family members. In five by-elections such a generational transfer has been from father to son:\n\nfour were caused by death—Littleton Groom replaced William Groom (Darling Downs 1901), Bernard Corser replaced Edward Corser (Wide Bay 1928), David Oliver Watkins replaced David Watkins (Newcastle 1935) and Doug Anthony replaced Larry Anthony (Richmond 1957) and\n\nthe fifth father to son replacement was when Harry Jenkins senior became Ambassador to Spain in 1986. He was replaced by Harry Jenkins junior (Scullin 1986).\n\nIn two cases the family transfer has been from uncle to nephew:\n\nHerbert Pratten to Frederick Pratten (Martin 1928) and David Riordan to William Riordan (Kennedy 1936).\n\nThe retirements of both Alexander Downer senior (Angas 1964) and Alexander Downer junior (Mayo 2008) were both the occasion for a by-election to be held. Georgina Downer, the daughter of Alexander Downer junior, contested a by-election in the same seat (Mayo 2018), however, she was unsuccessful.\n\nFamous entries into the House of Representatives\n\nSome MPs have achieved a national prominence prior to their election to the House of Representatives via a by-election:\n\nWilliam Spence (Darwin 1917) had been a co-founder and long-time President of the Australian Workers' Union\n\nsuccessive Queensland Labor Premiers, Thomas Joseph Ryan (1915–1919) and Edward Theodore (1919–1925) entered the House of Representatives as MPs for New South Wales seats—Ryan in 1921 for West Sydney, and Theodore for Dalley in 1925\n\nArchie Grenfell Price (Boothby 1941), Master of St Mark's College, University of Adelaide, was a noted Australian geographer\n\nGarfield Barwick KC (Parramatta 1958) was a leading Australian barrister\n\nJohn Gorton (Higgins 1968), former prominent member of the Senate, entered the House following his replacement of Harold Holt as Prime Minister\n\nSteele Hall (Boothby 1981) had been Premier of South Australia 1968–1970, as well as a Senator for South Australia\n\nCarmen Lawrence (Fremantle 1994) had been Premier of Western Australia 1990–1993. Lawrence's success was the first by-election victory by a woman candidate\n\nGed Kearney (Batman 2018) had been Federal Secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation 2008–2010 and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions 2010–2018 and\n\nKerryn Phelps (Wentworth 2018) is a Member of the Order of Australia (2011) and has been awarded the Centenary Medal (in 2001 for services to health and medicine). As well as a regular media commentator and author, she had been President of the Australian Medical Association 2000–2003—the first woman to do so—and Deputy Lord Mayor of the Sydney City Council 2016–2017.\n\nKicked upstairs?\n\nMany MPs have been appointed to prominent positions, thus ending their parliamentary careers. Some have seen this as an ideal way in which to leave the political hurly-burly, while for others there has been a suggestion that this was a means to push a potential leadership contender out of the picture:\n\nby-elections were caused when Paul Hasluck (Curtin 1969) and Bill Hayden (Oxley 1988) accepted the office of Governor-General\n\nCharles Abbott (Gwydir 1937) and Roger Dean (Robertson 1964) were both appointed Administrator of the Northern Territory, while Alex Wilson (Wimmera 1946) was appointed Administrator of Norfolk Island\n\nsome sudden departures have been caused by appointment to the judiciary. Edward McTiernan (Parkes 1931) and Garfield Barwick (Parramatta 1964) joined the High Court. Supreme Court appointments have also been made: William Irvine (Flinders 1918) in Victoria, Herbert Vere Evatt (Hunter 1960) in New South Wales, and Percy Joske (Balaclava 1960) in the Australian Capital Territory. Bob Ellicott (Wentworth 1981) was appointed to the Federal Court, while Nigel Bowen (Parramatta 1973) joined the New South Wales Court of Appeal\n\nby far the most-used diplomatic position for appointments of former MPs has been the High Commissioner position in London, with the appointment of eight former members forcing by-elections. Former Prime Ministers Fisher (Wide Bay 1915) and Cook (Parramatta 1921) began the list, followed by Granville Ryrie (Warringah 1927), Thomas White (Balaclava 1951), Eli James Harrison (Wentworth 1956), Alexander Downer senior (Angas 1964), Vic Garland (Curtin 1981) and Neal Blewett (Bonython 1994)\n\nvarious other members have accepted ambassadorships and other high commissions: Richard Casey (Corio 1940) and Howard Beale (Parramatta 1958) Ambassadors to the USA, Hugh Roberton (Riverina 1965) Ambassador to Ireland, Hubert Opperman (Corio 1967) High Commissioner to Malta, Lance Barnard (Bass 1975) Ambassador to Norway, Finland and Sweden, Les Johnson (Hughes 1984) High Commissioner to New Zealand, Harry Jenkins senior (Scullin 1986) Ambassador to Spain and Brendan Nelson (Bradfield 2009) Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Union and\n\nother unusual official appointments include Archibald Ian Allan (Gwydir 1969) to the Secretary-Generalship of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Alexander Downer junior (Mayo 2008) moved to the position of United Nations Special Envoy for Cyprus, and Brendan Nelson (Bradfield 2009) to the positions of Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Special Representative to the World Health Organisation (in conjunction with his ambassadorship).\n\nA matter of treason\n\nOn 7 November 1920 Hugh Mahon chaired a public meeting in Melbourne sponsored by the Irish Ireland League and, in a speech attacking the British presence in Ireland, spoke of ‘this bloody and accursed Empire’. His expulsion from the House of Representatives four days later for his ‘seditious and disloyal utterances’ was due to the House finding that he had been ‘guilty of conduct unfitting him to remain a member of this House’. Mahon's is the only expulsion to have occurred from the Parliament, and it forced a by-election (Kalgoorlie 1920) which he contested but lost.[20] The House of Representatives lost the power to expel members with the passage of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. [21]\n\nBy-elections that caused ripples\n\nOccasionally by-elections can be seen as having an importance beyond the immediate contest to fill a vacancy in the House of Representatives.\n\nSome were a sign of things to come electorally:\n\nthe by-election (Bass 1975) to replace Deputy Prime Minister Lance Barnard gave a very clear indication of the decline in popularity of the Whitlam Government that was confirmed in the December 1975 election[22] and\n\nthe by-election to replace former Hawke and Keating Minister, Ros Kelly (Canberra 1995), presaged the Keating Government's defeat in the March 1996 election.[23]\n\nOther by-elections have had a different type of political impact:\n\nin late 1939, coalition negotiations between the United Australia Party and the Country Party broke down over Prime Minister Menzies’ insistence on his right to choose all ministers. The 1940 Corio by-election to fill the place of Richard Casey unexpectedly produced a Labor victory. According to former Country Party leader Earle Page this was instrumental in Menzies' weakening his stance and offering five Cabinet positions to the Country Party, with the leader of each party to choose his own party's representatives[24]\n\nthe Dawson by-election of 26 February 1966 was fought largely for Labor by the candidate, Rex Patterson, and the party's deputy leader, Gough Whitlam. The national leader, Arthur Calwell, was convinced that Labor could not win and took little part. To the surprise of many, Patterson was successful. Whitlam was due to come before the Federal Executive of the ALP on 2 March to face possible disciplinary treatment, possibly even expulsion. According to Graham Freudenberg, the last-minute change of stance of the Queensland delegates, grateful to Whitlam for the Dawson result, saved his position—and possibly his political career[25]\n\nLabor’s failure to win the seat of Flinders in a by-election of late 1982 was said to have had a double impact. Bill Hayden’s position as Labor leader became increasingly insecure, while Prime Minister Fraser apparently became convinced of the need for an early election before there was any chance of Hayden’s replacement by Bob Hawke. The consequential replacement of Hayden and the announcement of an early election on the same day were thus intimately connected with the by-election's outcome[26]\n\nduring 1993–1994 much media discussion focussed on the possibility of Senator Bronwyn Bishop eventually assuming the leadership of the Liberal Party. When the seat of Mackellar fell vacant in 1994 Bishop secured Liberal preselection in an apparent move to clear the way for a push to the leadership. Labor did not contest the by-election and Bishop’s main rival was the writer, Bob Ellis, standing as an independent. Although Bishop won the seat comfortably with 52.2 per cent of first preferences, the Liberal first preference vote had fallen by 4.4 per cent. Although this was hardly a major loss of votes, her failure to increase her vote in the absence of a Labor candidate was considered enough to end any chance she may have had for the Liberals' top job. As fellow Liberal, Peter Reith, put it, ‘Most people within the parliamentary party were of the opinion that Bronwyn didn't have any votes within the parliamentary party ... if she didn’t have many before Saturday [that is, the by-election], she hasn’t got any more today and [27]\n\nthe deposing of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister by his party in August 2018 saw Turnbull resign from Parliament causing a by-election in the seat of Wentworth. With the Coalition only having a one seat majority in the House of Representatives the outcome was potentially very significant. The resulting defeat of the Liberal Party by high profile independent candidate, Kerryn Phelps, produced a hung parliament for the newly elected Prime Minister, Scott Morrison.\n\nBy-elections and section 44 of the Constitution:\n\nthe Lindsay by-election in late 1996 was the result of Liberal member, Jackie Kelly, being found ineligible by the Court of Disputed Returns under section 44(iv)—at the time of nomination for the 1996 federal election Ms Kelly was a serving officer in the RAAF. She was also alleged to be a dual citizen (New Zealand) but this was not needed to be tested by the Court as she had already been found ineligible. Jackie Kelly recontested and was returned to Parliament\n\nthe latter half of 2017 appeared predominantly devoted to section 44(i), and the eligibility of many parliamentarians—both senators and members—to sit in their respective chambers because of dual citizenship was brought into question. Two Coalition members failed this eligibility resulting in by-elections which threatened to overturn the Government’s one seat majority. Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce (New England, NP) was found by the Court of Disputed Returns to also be a New Zealand citizen while John Alexander (Bennelong, LP) resigned after having his dual citizenship confirmed by British authorities. A further member, David Feeney (Batman, ALP), was referred by his own party to the High Court for a ruling in early 2018. The Labor party and crossbenchers’ attempt to refer a total of nine members—four Labor, four Liberal and one from the Nick Xenophon Team—was defeated by the casting vote of the Speaker of the House, Tony Smith.[28] With the citizenship declarations by all Parliamentarians in December 2017 not clarifying the dual citizenship ‘crisis’, the distinct possibility of further by-elections before the next election was realised\n\nDavid Feeney (Batman, ALP) resigned before the High Court could rule on his citizenship status. The ALP held Batman by only a 1.0 per cent margin from the Greens. The Liber\n\nal Party chose not to field a candidate seemingly giving the Greens a good chance of winning. However, a swing of 3.4 per cent to the ALP saw it retain Batman and\n\nin May 2018 the Court of Disputed Returns found that Senator Katy Gallagher had, in effect, not taken reasonable steps to renounce her British citizenship. Therefore, at the time of her nomination for the 2016 election she was a dual citizen and, under section 44(i) of the Constitution, ineligible to be elected.[29] This finding had direct ramifications for four Members of the House—Justine Keay (Braddon, ALP), Susan Lamb (Longman, ALP), Rebekha Sharkie (Mayo, Centre Alliance) and Josh Wilson (Fremantle, ALP)—who all resigned. When Tim Hammond (Perth, ALP) resigned for personal reasons, five by-elections were held on ‘Super Saturday’ 28 July 2018. Although three of the seats (Braddon, Longman and Fremantle) were marginal Labor seats, the Liberals chose not to contest Fremantle or to contest the other seat in Western Australia (Perth). History was against the Liberal government winning seats from Labor but Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the results, inter alia, would be a test of his and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten’s leaderships.[30] In the end, Labor retained all its seats and increased its margins in Braddon and Longman, while Rebekha Sharkie in Mayo increased her margin by 2.6 per cent over the Liberals’ high profile candidate, Georgina Downer. The poor performance of the Liberals in the seats they contested—especially in Longman which had a 9.4 per cent swing against it on first preferences—was reportedly one factor in prompting the move that eventually deposed Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister on 24 August 2018.\n\nVoided elections\n\nSome by-elections have been caused by the voiding of particular results after a general election: Melbourne and Riverina in 1904, Echuca 1907, Ballaarat 1920, Lindsay 1996 and New England 2017.\n\nPotentially, six other by-elections could have been brought about by voiding general election results under section 44(i) of the Constitution—Bennelong 2017, Batman 2018, Braddon 2018, Fremantle 2018, Longman 2018 and Mayo 2018—but the early resignations of the respective members avoided the need for referral to the High Court.\n\nThe Wills by-election of 1992 was itself voided, but another by-election was not held because of the proximity of the next general election.\n\nAppendix 1: House of Representatives by-elections, 1901–2018\n\nNo. Date Division Member Elected Previous Member Reason for Vacancy 1 14.09.01 Darling Downs (Qld) Groom LE (Prot) Groom WH (Prot) Died 2 26.03.02 Tasmania Hartnoll W (FT) Piesse FW (FT) Died 3 04.09.03 East Sydney (NSW) Reid GH (FT) Reid GH (FT) Resigned in protest against rejection of proposals for redistribution of NSW. 4 26.02.04 Wilmot (Tas) Cameron DN (FT) Braddon ENC (FT) Died 5 30.03.04 Melbourne (Vic) Maloney WRN (ALP) McEacharn MD (Prot) Election voided 6 18.05.04 Riverina (NSW) Chanter JM (Prot) Blackwood RO (FT) Election voided 7 10.07.07 Echuca (Vic) Palmer AC (Prot) Palmer AC (Prot) Election voided 8 13.06.08 Adelaide (SA) Roberts EA (ALP) Kingston CC (Prot) Died 9 28.08.09 Wakefield (SA) Foster RW (AntiSoc) Holder FW (AntiSoc) Died 10 24.08.10 Kooyong (Vic) Best RW (Lib) Knox W (Lib) Resigned 11 08.02.11 Batman (Vic) Brennan F (ALP) Beard HE (ALP) Died 12 11.03.11 North Sydney (NSW) Ryrie GdeL (Lib) Edwards GB (Lib) Died 13 11.11.11 Boothby (SA) Gordon DJ (Lib) Batchelor EL (ALP) Died 14 01.06.12 Werriwa (NSW) Bennett BH (ALP) Hall DR (ALP) Resigned.

By the time of the Grampians by-election of 1917, the Liberal Party had effectively been subsumed by the Nationalist Party. Hence, this by-election is not regarded as an occasion when the division changed parties.\n\nFor votes received in each contest, see Appendix 2.\n\nAppendix 2: By-election results by electoral division, 1901–2018 [PDF338KB]\n\nAppendix 3: Notes on Commonwealth by-elections, 1901–2018\n\n1.

Tasmania 1902—this by-election was caused by the death of Frederick Piesse. This has been the only by-election held at-large, due to the first Tasmanian members being elected from the state as a whole rather than from individual electorates.\n\n3. East Sydney 1903—the sitting member, Sir George Reid, resigned in protest against the proposals for the redistribution of New South Wales divisions, forcing the by-election. Reid won the resulting by-election.\n\n4. Wilmot 1904—former Tasmanian Premier and Constitution-writer, Sir Edward Braddon, remains the oldest person elected to the House of Representatives. He was 71 when first elected and 74 when he died, forcing this by-election.\n\n5. Melbourne 1904—by-election caused by the voiding of the general election result on the grounds of irregularities by electoral officials.

Echuca 1907—by-election caused by the voiding of the general election result on the grounds of irregularities by electoral officials. The Opposition did not contest the seat.\n\n8. Adelaide 1908—death of former Premier and Constitution-writer, Charles Cameron Kingston. Neither the Protectionist government nor the Anti-Socialist opposition contested the seat won by the Labor Party.\n\n9. Wakefield 1909—death of former Premier and Constitution-writer, Sir Frederick Holder.\n\n10. Kooyong 1910—the winner of this by-election, Sir Robert Best, had been a Senator during the first decade until his defeat in 1910.\n\n11. Batman 1911—well-known lawyer, Frank Brennan, won this seat for the Labor Party.\n\n12. North Sydney 1911—Major-General Sir Granville Ryrie, who had seen military service in South Africa, at Gallipoli and in Egypt, won this seat for the Liberal Party.\n\n13. Boothby 1911—the Fisher Labor Government lost this seat to the Liberal Party, but regained it at the 1913 general election.\n\n14. Werriwa 1912—David Robert Hall resigned to take up an appointment to the New South Wales Legislative Council.\n\n15. Kalgoorlie 1913—the first by-election for which there was just a single nomination. The Liberal government did not contest this seat won by Labor.\n\n16. Adelaide 1914—the winner of this by-election, George Yates, soon left Australia to serve in the World War, though he retained his seat while he did so.\n\n17. Bendigo 1915—this by-election was caused by the death of the Minister for External Affairs, John Arthur.\n\n18. Grampians 1915—Sir Charles Salmon, second Speaker of the House of Representatives (1909-10) returned to the Parliament at this by-election.\n\n19. Dalley 1915—the death of Robert Howe, first secretary of the Labor Federation of Australia caused this by-election. Not contested by the Opposition, and only one candidate nominated.\n\n20. Wide Bay 1915—former Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher, resigned to take up an appointment as Australian High Commissioner to Great Britain. The Labor Party lost the seat, which it did not win back until 1961.\n\n21. Darwin 1917—former Tasmanian MHA, Charles Howroyd, died five days after winning the seat at the 1917 general election.\n\n22. Grampians 1917—Sir Charles Salmon's death caused this by-election. He was replaced by Edmund Jowett, later elected first deputy leader of the Country Party.\n\n23. Flinders 1918—upon the appointment of Sir William Irvine as Chief Justice of the Victorian Supreme Court, the by-election for his seat saw the victory of future Prime Minister Stanley Bruce.\n\n24. Swan 1918—by-election caused by the death of former Premier and Constitution-writer, Sir John Forrest. The Nationalist Party failed to hold the seat after splitting the conservative vote with the emerging Country Party, allowing the Labor Party to win. The Country Party won this seat at the next general election. This was the last election held using ‘first past the post’ voting.\n\n25. Corangamite 1918—this by-election saw the first use of preferential voting for a House election of any type. The Victorian Farmers' Union won the seat from the Nationalists. The defeated Labor candidate was future Prime Minister, James Scullin.\n\n26. Echuca 1919—this seat was also won by the Victorian Farmers' Union from the Nationalists. Not contested by the Opposition.\n\n27. Ballaarat 1920—in the 1919 general election, Edwin Kerby had defeated sitting member David McGrath by a single vote.

Kalgoorlie 1920—Labor's Hugh Mahon remains the only member or senator to be expelled. Although Mahon recontested for the Labor Party, the Nationalist government won—the only time a government has taken a seat from the opposition at a by-election. Labor won Kalgoorlie back at the 1922 general election.\n\n29. Maranoa 1921—the Country Party won its first by-election taking the seat from the Labor Party.\n\n30. West Sydney 1921—former Queensland Premier, Thomas Ryan, had been invited by the ALP Conference to contest this New South Wales division at the 1919 general election.

Wentworth 1981—the former leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Peter Coleman, comfortably retained the seat despite a 6.2 per cent swing to the ALP candidate, Robert Tickner. The voter turnout (69.5 per cent) was the lowest since the introduction of compulsory voting in 1924.\n\n109. Lowe 1982—this marginal Liberal Party seat became vacant following the resignation of former Prime Minister, Sir William McMahon.

The successful Liberal Party candidate, Michael Pratt, lost the seat at the next general election.\n\n119. Port Adelaide 1988—an 11.1 per cent swing against the ALP Government was insufficient for the Liberal Party to win the seat. The ALP's Rod Sawford was the winning candidate.\n\n120. Groom 1988—the Liberal Party candidate, Bill Taylor, won the seat previously held by the National Party.\n\n121. Oxley 1988—the prospective appointment of former Opposition Leader, Bill Hayden, as Governor-General caused the vacancy in this safe ALP seat.

Wills 1992—at that time a record number of 22 candidates (equalled in 2009 in Bradfield) contested this ALP seat vacated by the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. Prominent local identity, Phil Cleary, won the seat to become the only independent candidate to win a Commonwealth by-election. The by-election result was voided by the Court of Disputed Returns. Mr Cleary was in contravention of section 44(iv) of the Constitution and the Liberal and Labor candidates contravened section 44(i). A subsequent by-election was not held because of the impending general election.\n\n125. Werriwa 1994—the ALP retained this safe seat despite a swing against the ALP Government of 6.3 per cent. The successful candidate was Mark Latham.\n\n126. Fremantle 1994—former Western Australian Premier, Carmen Lawrence, retained this seat for the ALP with a swing of 1.0 per cent to the government.

Mackellar 1994—Liberal candidate, ex-Senator Bronwyn Bishop, easily retained this safe Liberal Party seat.

In the absence of an ALP candidate the Greens candidate, Peter Singer, received 28.0 per cent of the vote.\n\n131. Canberra 1995—after initially considering not to contest this fairly safe ALP seat, the Liberal Party ultimately decided to enter the race and won the seat from the government with a record swing of 16.1 per cent. The successful candidate, Brendan Smyth, lost the seat at the following general election.\n\n132.

The winning Liberal candidate was Andrew Thomson.\n\n133. Blaxland 1996—the seat was retained for the ALP by Michael Hatton, following the resignation of former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. The government did not contest this safe seat.\n\n134. Lindsay 1996—the 1996 general election result for Lindsay was voided by the Court of Disputed Returns under section 44(iv) of the Constitution because Jackie Kelly, the successful Liberal candidate at the 1996 election, was a serving officer in the RAAF at the time of nomination. She was also alleged to be a dual citizen (New Zealand) but this was not required to be tested by the Court. At the by-election Ms Kelly won with a swing of 5.0 per cent to the government.\n\n135. Fraser 1997—the seat was retained for the ALP by Steve Dargavel, following the resignation of sitting member, John Langmore. At the subsequent general election, the ACT's representation in the House of Representatives was reduced to two seats. Dargavel did not contest ALP pre-selection so that Bob McMullan, Member for Canberra, could contest Fraser.\n\n136. Holt 1999—the seat was retained for the ALP by Anthony Byrne, following the resignation of sitting member, Gareth Evans.\n\n137. Isaacs 2000—this was the first by-election since McPherson 1981 which was caused by the suicide of the sitting member, Greg Wilton. The LP did not contest this fairly safe Labor seat. Retained for the ALP by Ann Corcoran.\n\n138. Ryan 2001—the ALP candidate, Leonie Short, won this fairly safe Liberal seat following the retirement of John Moore. The swing of 9.7 per cent against the government was just sufficient for Short to succeed. She lost the seat in the following general election.\n\n139. Aston 2001—a field of fifteen candidates contested the by-election in this marginal government seat. It was retained for the Liberal Party by Chris Pearce, following the death of sitting member, Peter Nugent.\n\n140. Cunningham 2002—Greens candidate, Michael Organ, won this safe Labor seat following the resignation of sitting member, Stephen Martin. For the first time since Maranoa in 1921 an Opposition-held seat was lost in a by-election. The winning candidate received 23.0 per cent of the vote, the lowest winning first preference vote of any Commonwealth by-election. This was the first by-election victory by a minor party candidate since Echuca in 1919. The ALP regained the seat at the 2004 general election.\n\n141. Werriwa 2005—Mark Latham had won Werriwa for the ALP in a by-election in 1994. It was his resignation from the seat soon after his resignation as Leader of the Opposition that caused this by-election. Sixteen candidates contested the by-election, the third-highest total since 1901, with the seat being retained by the ALP.\n\n142. Gippsland 2008—Peter McGauran (NP) had held Gippsland for 25 years, the longest term of the Federation electorate’s eight members to that time. The by-election was contested by National, Liberal, Labor and Green candidates, but Darren Chester continued the Country/National Party hold of the seat that dated back to 1922.\n\n143. Lyne 2008—first contested in 1949, Lyne had been held by four Country/National MPs, including Mark Vaile, the party leader between 2005 and 2007. Former National, and later independent MLA, Rob Oakeshott, (1996–2008), was elected as an independent with a first preference vote of 63.8 per cent. The Labor Party did not contest the by-election.\n\n144. Mayo 2008—former Liberal Party leader and later Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, had been the first and only Member for Mayo when he retired after serving 23 years. Labor did not contest the by-election which was won for the Liberal Party by Jamie Briggs.\n\n145. Bradfield 2009—former Howard government minister and Liberal Party leader, Brendan Nelson, retired to take up Ambassadorships to the European Communities, Belgium and Luxembourg and posts as Representative to NATO and Special Representative to WHO. Labor did not stand a candidate in the by-election which was contested by an equal record number of 22 candidates. The blue ribbon Liberal seat was easily retained by Paul Fletcher.\n\n146. Higgins 2009—the resignation of former Howard government Treasurer, Peter Costello, triggered only the second by-election to be held in this fairly safe Liberal Party seat (the first being in 1968 after Prime Minister Harold Holt was presumed dead). Labor did not contest this by-election which was won by Costello’s former advisor, Kelly O’Dwyer.\n\n147. Griffith 2014—former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, resigned after leading the ALP government to a loss at the 2013 election in his second stint as Prime Minister. Terri Butler retained the marginal seat for the ALP despite a two-party preferred swing against the ALP of 1.3 per cent.\n\n148. Canning 2015—Don Randall, the member for Canning since 2001 and former member for Swan 1993–1998, died suddenly. The subsequent by-election was being seen as a litmus test of the Abbott led Coalition government; however, Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister four days before the poll. Andrew Hastie retained the seat for the Liberals and the 6.6 per cent swing against the government was not as high as the double digit swing predicted by the polls.\n\n149. North Sydney 2015—this safe seat was vacated by former Abbott government Treasurer, Joe Hockey. A controversial pre-selection process saw former Hockey staffer, Trent Zimmerman, represent the Liberal Party. The ALP chose not to contest the poll. A field of 13 candidates stood and Zimmerman needed preferences to win the seat after a 12.5 per cent first preference swing against the Liberals.\n\n150. New England 2017—due to contravention of section 44(i) of the Constitution, the Court of Disputed Returns declared invalid the 2016 election of Barnaby Joyce, National Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister. After renouncing his New Zealand citizenship Joyce successfully re-contested for this seat and, despite the third largest field of candidates in a by-election, gained a substantial 12.6 per cent swing on first preferences.\n\n151. Bennelong 2017—Liberal John Alexander resigned from this fairly safe seat after declaring himself a dual citizen. After renouncing his British citizenship Alexander re-contested but, although successful, the two-party preferred swing of 4.8 per cent against the Coalition turned this into a marginal seat.\n\n152. Batman 2018—Labor member David Feeney resigned before the Court of Disputed Returns could rule on his dual-citizenship status. Ged Kearney, nurse and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, was preselected by the ALP to run against the Greens’ Alex Bhathal, who had unsuccessfully contested Batman in five of the six Federal elections since 2001. With the Government choosing not to contest the by-election, and the ALP only holding the seat by a one per cent margin over the Greens, this was seen as a possible win for the Greens. However, a 3.4 per cent swing to the ALP (two-candidate basis) saw the ALP retain Batman.\n\n153. Braddon 2018—one of five by-elections—the most by-elections ever held on a single day—on this date. Labor member, Justine Keay, resigned because her dual citizen situation was similar to Senator Katy Gallagher, who had been found ineligible to be elected at the 2016 election by the High Court under section 44(i) of the Constitution. Justine Keay re-contested for the ALP and retained her marginal seat with a slight, 0.1 per cent, swing from the Liberal Party.\n\n154. Fremantle 2018—one of five by-elections—the most by-elections ever held on a single day—on this date. Labor member, Josh Wilson, resigned because his dual citizen situation was similar to Senator Katy Gallagher, who had been found ineligible to be elected at the 2016 election by the High Court under section 44(i) of the Constitution. Mr Wilson re-contested for the ALP but the Liberal Party chose not to field a candidate in this fairly safe seat. In the final contest Josh Wilson defeated the LDP by a 46.7 per cent margin.\n\n155. Longman 2018—one of five by-elections—the most by-elections ever held on a single day—on this date. Labor member, Susan Lamb, resigned because her dual citizen situation was similar to Senator Katy Gallagher, who had been found ineligible to be elected at the 2016 election by the High Court under section 44(i) of the Constitution. Susan Lamb re-contested for the ALP and retained this very marginal seat gaining a 3.7 per cent two-party preferred swing. The 9.4 per cent first preference swing against the LNP candidate was cited amongst the reasons for the Liberal Party to depose Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (see Wentworth 2018, below).\n\n156. Perth 2018—one of five by-elections—the most by-elections ever held on a single day—on this date. Tim Hammond, who had only been the Labor member for Perth since 2016, resigned for personal reasons. The Liberal Party chose not to contest this marginal seat and Patrick Gorman—WA Labor’s state secretary—retained the seat for Labor with a 26.2 per cent margin over the Greens.\n\n157. Mayo 2018—one of five by-elections—the most by-elections ever held on a single day—on this date. Centre Alliance member, Rebekha Sharkie, resigned because her dual citizen situation was similar to Senator Katy Gallagher, who had been found ineligible to be elected at the 2016 election by the High Court under section 44(i) of the Constitution. Rebekha Sharkie re-contested this seat she won from the Liberal Party at the 2016 election. The Liberals fielded high profile candidate and daughter of Alexander Downer, Georgina Downer, but a swing of 2.6 per cent to Rebekha Sharkie saw her retain this seat for the Centre Alliance (formerly known as the Nick Xenophon Team).\n\n158. Wentworth 2018—Malcolm Turnbull resigned from Parliament after being deposed as prime minister. Wentworth, which Turnbull had returned to a safe seat for the Liberal Party, was contested by 16 candidates including high profile Independent, Kerryn Phelps. The substantial, but not record (see Wentworth 1956), first preference vote swing of 19.2 per cent against the Liberals was too much to recover and Phelps won with a 2.4 per cent margin. The loss for the Liberals meant the loss of the Coalition government’s one seat majority in the House of Representatives, producing a hung Parliament.\n\nAppendix 4: By-election timing, 1901–2018\n\nDivision Previous\n\nElection Date\n\nVacated By-election\n\ndate Next\n\nElection Elapsed Time (days) Reason Vacated to\n\nby-election After\n\nprevious\n\nelection Before next\n\nelection Darling Downs (Qld) 30.03.01 08.08.01 14.09.01 16.12.03 37 168 823 Died Tasmania 29.03.01 06.02.02 26.03.02 16.12.03 48 362 630 Died East Sydney (NSW) 29.03.01 18.08.03 04.09.03 16.12.03 17 889 103 Resigned Wilmot (Tas) 16.12.03 02.02.04 26.02.04 12.12.06 24 72 1020 Died Melbourne (Vic) 16.12.03 10.03.04 30.03.04 12.12.06 20 105 987 Election voided Riverina (NSW) 16.12.03 13.04.04 18.05.04 12.12.06 35 154 938 Election voided Echuca (Vic) 12.12.06 10.06.07 10.07.07 13.04.10 30 210 1008 Election voided Adelaide (SA) 12.12.06 11.05.08 13.06.08 13.04.10 33 549 669 Died Wakefield (SA) 12.12.06 23.07.09 28.08.09 13.04.10 36 990 228 Died Kooyong (Vic) 13.04.10 26.07.10 24.08.10 31.05.13 29 133 1011 Resigned Batman (Vic) 13.04.10 18.12.10 08.02.11 31.05.13 52 301 843 Died North Sydney (NSW) 13.04.10 04.02.11 11.03.11 31.05.13 35 332 812 Died Boothby (SA) 13.04.10 08.10.11 11.11.11 31.05.13 34 577 567 Died Werriwa (NSW) 13.04.10 01.04.12 01.06.12 31.05.13 61 780 364 Resigned Kalgoorlie (WA) 31.05.13 25.11.13 22.12.13 05.09.14 27 205 257 Died Adelaide (SA) 31.05.13 02.12.13 10.01.14 05.09.14 39 224 238 Died Bendigo (Vic) 05.09.14 09.12.14 06.02.15 05.05.17 59 154 819 Died Grampians (Vic) 05.09.14 01.01.15 20.02.15 05.05.17 50 168 805 Died Dalley (NSW) 05.09.14 02.04.15 06.05.15 05.05.17 33 243 880 Died Wide Bay (Qld) 05.09.14 26.10.15 11.12.15 05.05.17 46 462 511 Resigned Darwin (Tas) 05.05.17 10.05.17 30.06.17 13.12.19 51 56 896 Died Grampians (Vic) 05.05.17 15.09.17 27.10.17 13.12.19 42 175 777 Died Flinders (Vic) 05.05.17 05.04.18 11.05.18 13.12.19 36 371 581 Resigned Swan (WA) 05.05.17 02.09.18 26.10.18 13.12.19 54 539 413 Died Corangamite (Vic) 05.05.17 23.10.18 14.12.18 13.12.19 52 588 364 Died Echuca (Vic) 05.05.17 14.08.19 20.09.19 13.12.19 37 868 84 Died Ballaarat (Vic) 13.12.19 02.06.20 10.07.20 16.12.22 38 210 889 Election voided Kalgoorlie (WA) 13.12.19 12.11.20 18.12.20 16.12.22 36 371 728 Expelled Maranoa (Qld) 13.12.19 03.06.21 30.07.21 16.12.22 57 595 504 Died West Sydney (NSW) 13.12.19 01.08.21 03.09.21 16.12.22 33 630 469 Died Parramatta (NSW) 13.12.19 11.11.21 10.12.21 16.12.22 29 728 371 Resigned Yarra (Vic) 13.12.19 10.01.22 18.02.22 16.12.22 39 798 301 Died Eden-Monaro (NSW) 14.11.25 12.01.26 06.03.26 17.11.28 53 113 987 Died Dalley (NSW) 14.11.25 18.01.27 26.02.27 17.11.28 39 469 630 Resigned Warringah (NSW) 14.11.25 13.04.27 21.05.27 17.11.28 38 553 546 Resigned Martin (NSW) 14.11.25 07.05.28 16.06.28 17.11.28 40 945 154 Died Wide Bay (Qld) 14.11.25 31.07.28 03.09.28 17.11.28 34 1024 75 Died Balaclava (Vic) 17.11.28 05.07.29 03.08.29 12.10.29 29 259 70 Resigned Franklin (Tas) 12.10.29 22.10.29 14.12.29 19.12.31 53 63 735 Died Parkes (NSW) 12.10.29 19.12.30 31.01.31 19.12.31 43 476 322 Resigned East Sydney (NSW) 12.10.29 05.02.31 07.03.31 19.12.31 30 511 287 Died East Sydney (NSW) 19.12.31 15.01.32 06.02.32 15.09.34 22 49 952 Died Flinders (Vic) 19.12.31 06.10.33 11.11.33 15.09.34 36 693 308 Resigned Newcastle (NSW) 15.09.34 08.04.35 01.06.35 23.10.37 54 259 875 Died Fawkner (Vic) 15.09.34 25.06.35 17.08.35 23.10.37 53 336 798 Died Kennedy (Qld) 15.09.34 15.10.36 12.12.36 23.10.37 58 819 315 Died Darling Downs (Qld) 15.0"
