        "text": "Career\n\nScully, a recruit from Windsor, started his Street Kilda career in the 1924 VFL season. In round 17 he was reported for striking Essendon player Charlie May, for which he was suspended for five games. He did not return the following season until round six and kicked three goals in his first game back, against Essendon.\n\nHe played every game except the final two rounds, due to a shoulder injury.\n\nHis 1926 season was interrupted by an eight-week suspension, incurred for an incident in Street Kilda\"s round two loss to Geelong at Junction Oval. The incident happened after Scully received a free kick for having his arm pulled by Geelong\"s Ken Leahy.\n\nAccording to the field umpire\"s account, Scully punched the ball away following the free kick, which struck Leahy in the face. The pair then exchanged blows and had to be separated by the boundary umpire.\n\nAs Leahy was the first to strike, Scully\"s suspension was for \"retaliation\".\n\nThe tribunal chairman believed Leahy was the aggressor, but as Scully was also charged with striking they could not take provocation into accountant Leahy was also suspended for eight weeks. A return to football was further delayed by a court case, relating to the theft of a motor vehicle tyre from the property of Street Kilda vice president John Beddison.\n\nOn the night in question, the men had dinner at the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel in Street Kilda, which was managed by Beddison.\n\nSoon after 8 pm, the men left in a taxi and Beddison noticed that the tyre was missing from his car outside the hotel. Prosecutors alleged that Scully had taken the tyre, which he dropped off at a local motor garage during the taxi ride.\n\nThe judge asked the jury to take into consideration that Scully was intoxicated and the jury returned a not guilty verdict. He played in three of the final four rounds of the season.\n\nIn 1927, Scully played 14 games for Street Kilda and kicked 18 goals.\n\nThe following year he left to coach Penshurst."
