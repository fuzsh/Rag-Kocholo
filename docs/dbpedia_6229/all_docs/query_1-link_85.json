        "text": "Married. Robert Johns Bulkley Jr., Harvard law student, only son of Ohio’s junior Senator; and Lorraine Warner, Boston socialite; in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nSued for Divorce. James John (“Jimmy”) Walker, 51, New York’s one-time Mayor; by Janet Allen Walker, fortyish, onetime vaudeville singer, daughter of the Chicago Evening American’s first city editor; in the Circuit Court of Dade County, Fla. Charge: “Willful” desertion . . . “guilty, obstinate and continued.” Newshawks shouted news of the suit up to Mr. Walker’s hotel window in Cannes, France, at dawn while he was applying hot irons to his lumbago pains after a night club party. He shrilled down, “I have been fantastically misunderstood. The action is absurd. Shut up!” and slammed the window. In the next few days he said he would contest, would not, left the decision to his lawyer, was grateful for Mrs. Walker’s tactful charge of desertion, not adultery. Worried about cash, Mr. Walker was lazily writing magazine articles with Writer Frank Scully and hobnobbing with Banker Otto Hermann Kahn. He had given up writing an autobiography. He said his friend Betty Compton, with whom he is living, had finished her autobiography which “ought to be a swell book because she sure is one swell woman.” Of his wife, who once in vaudeville sang his song, “Will You Love Me in December as You Do in May?” and wept in Miami recently when a cabaret orchestra played it, he said last September when she saw him off for Europe, “She’s one brave woman.”\n\nAwarded. To Robert Thompson Pell, retiring as press attaché of the U. S. Embassy at Paris: the Cross of the French Legion of Honor. To Silk Man Joseph Gerli: the decoration of Grand Officer of the Crown of Italy for boosting Italian art traditions.\n\nSuit Won. Against Victor Talking Machine Co. (now RCA-Victor Co.); by David Graves George, 67, Southern Railway Co. employe, onetime Virginia hillbilly; for an accounting of profits on the record, “The Wreck of the Old 97” which George claimed he wrote in 1906 when a crack mail train plunged off a trestle near Franklin Junction, Va. Probable royalties: over $375,000.\n\nBirthdays. Oliver Wendell Holmes. 92; Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, 83; Adolph Simon Ochs. 75; Lillian D. Wald, 66; Albert Einstein, 54.\n\nDied. Marjorie Easton Woodhouse Procter Leidy, 30, second wife of Philadelphia Socialite Carter Randolph Leidy (first wife: Josephine [“Fifi”] Widener), divorced wife of Frederic William Procter, Ivory Soap heir; by drowning when her husband’s car, to avoid another, plunged through a guard railing, landed upside down in the shallow Bronx River.\n\nDied. Dan P. Hoover, 47, vice president of Hoover Co. (vacuum cleaners), son of the founder; by jumping from a fifth floor window at Cleveland Clinic while under observation for a stomach disorder.\n\nDied. Edgar French Strother, 49, intermittently literary coach of onetime President Hoover and associate editor of the late World’s Work (merged last year with Review of Reviews), Democrat; of pneumonia; in Washington, D. C.\n\nDied. Louis Timothy Stone, 58, managing editor of the Evening Citizen of Winsted, Conn., which he put on the U. S. map with his freak animal stories; after long illness; in Winsted. Famed lies: the 1895 “Winsted Wild Man” who ran naked in the hills, the cat with the harelip that whistled “Yankee Doodle,” the spinsters’ cow that was too decent to be milked by a man, Pete the tunneling trout, the chilled cow that gave ice cream, the man who kept flies off his bald head by painting on a spider, mares who bore twin calves, and the windstorm that blew a sheet of paper into a typewriter and typed off the alphabet backwards.\n\nDied. Cora Helen Coolidge, sixtyish, able president of Pennsylvania College for Women, sister of Massachusetts’ Senator Marcus Allen Coolidge; after long illness; in Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\nDied. Charles Henry Forbes, 66, Phillips Academy’s acting headmaster, author (The Sham Argument Against Latin, Chapel Prayers), able woodcarver; of a heart attack; in Andover, Mass.\n\nDied. Robert Beecher Howell, 69, Nebraska’s junior U. S. Senator since 1922, chairman of the Senate’s Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Expenditures; of a heart attack after a neck abscess and pneumonia brought on by overwork; in Washington, D. C. After being a U. S. Navy ensign and a lawyer, he became an Omaha waterworks manager, entered politics via state engineering jobs.\n\nDied. Robert Lee Luce, 70, onetime New York Supreme Court Justice, director of TIME Inc.; of cardio-nephritis; in Manhattan.\n\nDied. Johnny Heinold, 73, keeper of the famed First & Last Chance Saloon in Oakland, Calif., good friend & employer of the late Writer Jack London; after a paralytic stroke; in San Francisco. Advised to make the First & Last Chance, now a soft drink parlor, a Jack London shrine, Heinold answered, “It wouldn’t be doing right by Jack to commercialize it that way.”\n\nDied. Jane Dowie, 78, relict of founder John Alexander Dowie (Elijah III) of Zion City, Ill., eccentric Evangelist whom she helped depose in 1906 after he was said to have practiced polygamy, and who made & lost $15,000,000 in real estate; in poverty, of a stroke; in Zion City."
