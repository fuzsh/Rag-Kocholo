        "text": "During the sentencing, the judge goes beyond state guidelines of sevento 12 years because the crime was so cruel.\n\nProsecutor Dorothy Vaccaro has taken on some horrible crimes without losing her low-key style. Those cases included a woman who murdered her husband and collected $140,000 in insurance money.\n\nA man who molested a young girl with cerebral palsy.\n\nAnother man accused of raping a 95-year-old woman.\n\nBut what Frank Scully did to Shari Pynchon was enough to make even a veteran prosecutor cry.\n\nScully, 24, of Holiday, was convicted last month of attempted murder for beating Pynchon and stomping on her head several times. Pynchon, 25, worked as a clerk at Walgreens. She lies in a nursing home in a vegetative state, unable to speak, fed by a tube.\n\n\"I never met Shari, but I heard some really nice things about her,\" Vaccaro said, choking back tears at Scully's sentencing hearing on Wednesday.\n\nScully confronted Pynchon at her sister's home in August. The two had just broken up, and Scully found out Pynchon had been smoking cigarettes behind his back, said Shari's mother, Camille Pynchon.\n\nThat, apparently, was enough to fuel his rage. As Pynchon's sister pleaded with him to stop, Scully pummeled his 95-pound ex-girlfriend, breaking every bone in her face and leaving her unconscious on the floor.\n\nAssistant Public Defender Dean Livermore argued Scully had shown remorse for his crime and deserved to be sentenced according to state guidelines, which would have called for a seven- to 12-year prison term.\n\nAfter an emotional hearing, Judge William Sestak ruled Scully's acts were so cruel that the guidelines shouldn't apply. He sent Scully to prison for 30 years.\n\n\"If I could let you walk out the back door and let this family's daughter come home, I would do it. But that can't happen,\" Sestak told Scully. \"She is in a tomb. She has been sentenced to a tomb. That is her life.\"\n\nScully, handcuffed and wearing chains around his waist, sat with his closely cropped head bowed as Sestak spoke.\n\n\"I wish this whole thing had never happened,\" he said, his voice cracking with emotion.\n\nThat was little consolation to Pynchon's mother.\n\n\"Frank Scully showed my daughter no mercy,\" she said, reading unsteadily from handwritten notes. \"My daughter will never talk, walk, eat or do any of the things we all take for granted. It's like a nightmare we'll never wake up from.\"\n\nPynchon's sister, Devon, intended to speak at the hearing, but cried quietly in the courtroom's front row instead. Vaccaro took over for her, telling the court that the 20-year-old woman has replayed the grisly beating in her mind time and time again.\n\n\"She saw her sister's jaw lying on the ground because it was broken in so many places,\" Vaccaro said.\n\nAfter the hearing, Vaccaro said the case was one of the most draining she has handled in eight years at the Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney's Office.\n\nIt was speaking for Devon Pynchon and recalling the sound of her voice on the 911 tape, Vaccaro said, that brought on tears.\n\n\"I've had that vision of what she saw on that night in my head for this entire case,\" Vaccaro said. \"She tried to pull him (Scully) off in the beginning. You can hear Devon screaming in the background. Bloodcurdling that's the way it was,\" Vaccaro said.\n\nVaccaro quickly regained her composure during the hearing. A bailiff brought her a box of tissues.\n\n\"It caught me off guard,\" Vaccaro said later. \"Obviously I tried to hold it back. But it came from my heart.\""
