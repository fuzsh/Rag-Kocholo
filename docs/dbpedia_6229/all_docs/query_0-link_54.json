        "text": "Mr. Abbott said the Communist 1\n\nParty had infiltrated and influenced I\n\nthe Labour Party and through the\n\nparty Labour Governments, Comrn\n\nmonwealth and State. That trade\n\nunion leaders and their Parliament\n\nary representatives were afraid of\n\nthis infiltration was borne out by\n\ntheir own statements.\n\nFor some months past Mr. J. P.\n\nOrmonde, a member of the execu\n\ntive of the Australian Labour Party\n\nin New South Wales, had been\n\nwriting regularly each Thursday in\n\nthe \"Sydney Morning Herald\" on\n\nsubjects of impo'tance to the Lab\n\nour movement. Mr. Ormonde had\n\ndevoted considerable space to trying\n\nto induce the Labour movement to\n\nrid itself of Communist influence,\n\nbut Labour, beyond protesting thati\n\nit did not want Communists in its\n\nunions, did nothing to get rid of\n\nthem. In the policy speech of the\n\nN.S.W. Premier (Mr. McGirr),\n\nCommunists were n& mentioned,\n\nsaid Mr. Abbott.\n\nMr. Ormonde had shown how the ý\n\nCommunist Party brought its in\n\nfluence to bear through Labour\n\nParty committees and oranches. He\n\npractically stated that Communist\n\ncontrolled unions were invited by the\n\nA.L.P. -to become members of its\n\nbranches. In this way, Communists\n\nhelped to shape the policy of the,\n\nLabour Party.\n\nThis was borne out by the history\n\nof the Katoomba branch of the\n\nA.L.P., within the Prime Minister's\n\nown electorate. The branch was de\n\nregistered not because it contained a\n\nlarge number of Communists but\n\nbecause, in the words of the State\n\nsecretary of the A.L.P. (Mr.\n\nStewart) \"the branch had caused\n\nfriction and was in an unsatisfactory\n\nstate.\"\n\n\"Underground Worker.\"\n\nMr. Abbott said the chief Com\n\nmunist operatives in the Katoomba\n\nbranch had been Dr. E. P. Dark,\n\nMrs. Eleanor Da k, the authoress,\n\nMr. Davidson, late minute secretary\n\nof the A.L.P., Mr. Bruce Milliss and\n\nMrs. Milliss, Mt Andrew Levings,\n\nMr. Frank Murray, Mr. and Mrs.\n\nSmall, Mr. Pete: Carroll, Mr. and\n\nMrs. Apthorpe, Mr. Macredie, Mr.\n\nHal Pratt, Miss Beth Armstrong, Mr.\n\nand Mrs. Toakley, Mrs. Kilner, Mrs\n\nButterfield, Mr. George Hamey and\n\nMr. J. Yearby. Dr. Dark was of the\n\nsame type as Dr. Alan Nunn-May\n\n(the British scientist sentenced to\n\nimprisonment for divulging atomic\n\nsecrets)--\"an ardent but secret Com\n\nmunist.' Mrs. Dark was an under\n\nground worker for the Communists,\n\nMr. Abbott declared.\n\nThe Speaker (Mr. Rosevear)\n\ncalled Mr. Abbott. to order for\n\nspeaking away from the terms of\n\nhis motion. Continuing, Mr. Abbott\n\nsaid the Katoomba A.L.P. branch\n\nhad now been disbanded but up to\n\nMarch 7 it had been Communist\n\ncontrolled and this bore out what\n\nMr. Ormonde had said about the in-I\n\nfluence of the Communists within\n\nthe Labour Party.\n\nWhen some 4,000 State income\n\ntax officers were brought into the'\n\nCommonwealth Public Service lasti\n\nmet with considerable opposition\n\nfrom responsible sections of the\n\ntransferred officers on the ground\n\nthat the Clerks' Union was a Com\n\nmunist-controlled organisation.\n\nInfluence in Departments.\n\nDespite the majority against the\n\nproposal, the Clerks' Union formed\n\nthe taxation branch and now was at\n\ntempting to extend its influence into\n\nother branches of the Public Service.\n\nUnion representatives had made\n\ncontact with the Postmaster-Gen\n\neral's Department, the Airlines\n\nCommission, Telecommunications,\n\nRepatriation, Labour and National\n\nService, Air, Commerce and other\n\ndepartments. The Clerks' Union\n\nwas recognised as a Communist\n\ndominated union, he said. Mr. J. R.\n\nHughes, secretary of the N.S.W.\n\nbranch, was a leading member of\n\nthe central committee of the Com\n\nmunist Party.\n\nMr. Abbott said there was also\n\nthe particular example of a member\n\nof the Australian! Communist Party\n\nbeing appointed to the CS.LR. He\n\nreferred to Arthur William Rudkin.\n\nIn June, 1940, he said, Rudkin was\n\nsentenced to four months' imprison\n\nment with hard labour in Western\n\nAustralia as a Communist traitor.\n\nHe had been passing on to the gen\n\neral secretary of the Australian\n\nCommunist Party and to the Com\n\nmunist Party of Great Britain in\n\nformation which might be useful to\n\nthe enemy. There was more recent\n\nevidence that Rudkin had not\n\nchanged his views or his bitter\n\nhatred of demo.ratic nations. De\n\nspite this, Rudkin had been ap\n\npointed to a position in the forests\n\nproducts division of the CS.LR.\n\nA motion by the Deputy Leader\n\nof the Country Party (Mr.\n\nMcEwen) for an extension of Mr.\n\nAbbott's time was defeated by 37\n\nvotes to 20.\n\nThe Attorney-General (Dr.\n\nEvatt) said Mr Abbott had failed\n\ncompletely to give any serious\n\ncharacter to his motion. In trying\n\nto say there was Communist in\n\nfluence in the A.L.P, all Mr. Abbott\n\ncould point to was one Labour\n\nleague in NS.W. in which there\n\nwere people he did not even say\n\nwere Communists but near-Com\n\nmunists. If Mr. Abbott said outside\n\nthe House some of the things he had\n\nsaid inside, there were a number of\n\npersons on the list he had read out\n\nwho would seek appropriate redress.\n\nLabour Policy Unchanged.\n\nLabour policy towards Com\n\nmunists was stated in a resolution\n\ncarried in 1943 which remained un\n\n-altered. This said the AL.P.\n\ndissociated itself from the policy and\n\nmethods of the Communist Party.\n\nand its auxiliaries and declared the\n\nCommunist Party an anti-Labour\n\norganisation in -irect conflict with\n\nthe policy and platform of the\n\nA.L.P. It was serious for Mr.\n\nAbbott to bring up such a subject\n\nand not support his allegations.\n\nThese allegations were untrue in re\n\ngard to the A.L.P. and its executive\n\nand the Government.\n\n- Mr. Abbott had tried to suggest\n\nthat the Government was in some\n\nway to blame for the activities of\n\nthe Clerks' Union, said Dr. Evatt.\n\nThat union had held a trek to Can\n\nberra organised in a provocative\n\nway to persuade the )Government to\n\ninterfere with the Public Service\n\nArbitrator. Its objective was to see\n\nthe Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley),\n\nwho refused to see its delegates.\n\nAfterwards the union attacked Mr.\n\nChifley in a pamphlet for 'having\n\nremained loyal to the Public Ser\n\nvice Association. Mr. Abbott was\n\nsuggesting that in some way Mr.\n\nChifley had encouraged Communism\n\nwhen actually he had stood firm\n\nagainst it. Mr. Dedman would deal\n\nfully with the matter of Mr. Rud\n\nkin's appointment, but he (Dr.\n\nEvatt) would point out that there\n\nwere 90.000 employees in the Pub\n\nlic Service and of these Mr. Abbott\n\ncould name only one as an alleged\n\nCommunist.\n\nDrop in Membership.\n\nIn Australia the Communist\n\nParty was not an unlawful organi\n\nsation. Its membership was re\n\nported to have dropped to 20,000.\n\nIt was obvious there would be in\n\nall walks of life, including the Pub\n\nlic Service, people sympathetic to\n\nthe Communist Party and even\n\nmembers of it.\n\nDr. Evatt said be did not know\n\nwhat attitude and policy Mr. Abbott\n\nwould adopt towards the Com\n\nmunist Party, but at the last election\n\nthe Leader of the Country Party\n\n(Mr. Fadden) said that if returned\n\nto office he would consider depor\n\ntation of Conmmnunists. That was a\n\nvery doubtful policy because of a\n\nHigh Court decision in a deporta\n\ntion case some years ago. Mr.\n\nFadden had also advocated banning\n\nthe Communist Party. He supposed\n\nthis meant declaring membership of\n\nthe party illegal and making every\n\none associated with it guilty of a\n\ncriminal offence.\n\nDuring the war the Government\n\nissued regulations under which it\n\ndealt with the Communist Party in\n\nthe way Mr. Fadden suggested.\n\nThat action was taken under war\n\ntime powers and he did not think\n\nit could be followed now. The\n\nregulations under which the Com\n\nmunist Party was banned were sub\n\nsequently held by the High Court\n\nto be illegal. That was not in a\n\nScase concerning the Communist\n\nParty but another body, but it was\n\nthe same set of regulations.\n\nMr. Abbott's proposals could not\n\nbe accepted by any democratic gov\n\nenmment, Dr. Evatt continued. The\n\niLabour Party told the people at the\n\nlast election that if there were any\n\nadvocacy of violence. it would take\n\naction against those responsible. but\n\nhe did not know of any case where\n\nthere had been advocacy of violence\n\nby any members of the Communist\n\nParty. He was not defending the\n\nCommunists but that was the posi\n\ntion.\n\nAttack on Mr. Chifley.\n\nSOme weeks ago Mr. Abbott had\n\nbrought up some aspects of the\n\nCommunist Party relating to secur\n\nity. This action might produce\n\nimportant results on the security\n\nside, but what Mr. Abbott had\n\nbrought forward today was quite\n\n(Continued on Page 0le.)\n\nCO MMUIIST\n\nCANCER.\n\n(Continued from Page 9.)\n\nanother matter. As an illustration\n\nof the attitude of the Communist\n\nParty to the Labour Government,\n\nDr. Evatt said he would display a\n\nCommunist pamphlet issued as anti\n\nLabour propaganda. This was a\n\nposter which had a photograph of\n\nMr. Chifley and a caption in large\n\ntype: \"Wanted for robbery of pay\n\nenvelopes.\" This was a shocking\n\nand disgraceful thing.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition\n\n(Mr. Menzies): It's a good photo\n\ngraph.\n\nMr. Abbott: Don't you agree that\n\nit is an absolutely rotten party.\n\nDr. Evart said there were two\n\nextreme views. One was the view\n\nof the Communists, which the Gov\n\nernment understood thoroughly and\n\ntowards which the Labour Party had\n\nstated its policy. The Communist\n\nParty caused and brought into ex\n\nistence trends of an exactly oppo\n\nsite character-Fascist trends. One\n\nhad only to study some of the ad\n\nvertisements in the Melbourne news\n\npapers in relation to Communism to\n\nsee that unless great care were\n\ntaken there might arise in Australia\n\na movement of the \"New Guard\"\n\ntype which would advocate use of\n\nviolence and be a danger to Aus\n\ntralia.\n\nMr. Cameron (Lib., S.A.): The\n\nCommunist Party advocates the use\n\nof violence.\n\nDr. Evatt said the Labour Party\n\nstood between these two extremes.\n\nIts policy was to preserve demo\n\ncratic and parliamentary institutions,\n\nto respect democratic rights and to\n\nensure the security of Australia.\n\nWhere there was any case of ad\n\nvocacy of. violence, the Government\n\nwould take appropriate action. Mr.\n\nAbbott had not shown that any\n\nCommunist influence was exerted on\n\nthe Government. In fact there was\n\nnone.\n\nCrippling Democracy.\n\nMr. Beale (Lib., N.S.W.) said\n\nthe Communist Party wanted to\n\nmake the Australian democratic\n\nsystem unworkable by strikes and\n\nthen seize control of key industries.\n\nIt wanted to permeate Government\n\ndepartments with key men and,\n\nwhen it was strong enough, clamp\n\ndown a dictatorship, if necessary by\n\nforce. It was true the Communist\n\nParty did not put up many candi\n\ndates for election, but its members\n\nvoted for the Labour Pqrty and the\n\nLabour Party exchanged votes with\n\nit. It was humbug to say there was\n\nno association between the Labour\n\nParty and the Communist Party.\n\nThe Communist Party was growing\n\nin Australia. In the telephone book\n\nin Sydney there were six telephone\n\nnumbers for the A.L.P. and 16 for\n\nthe Communist Party.\n\nThe party had achieved its ob\n\njective of getting control of some\n\nkey industries and was getting into\n\nGovernment instrumentalities.\n\nThe Minister for Post-war Recon\n\nstruction (Mr. Dedman) said Mr.\n\nAbbott's case was so poor that it\n\nscarcely needed a reply. The Labour\n\nParty held that any reforms must\n\ncome by constitutional means and\n\nit repudiated any attempt to get re\n\nforms by revolutionary means.\n\nW.A. Member's Outburst.\n\nIf there were association between\n\nthe Communist Party and any\n\nother political party, it was rathler\n\nwith the anti-Labour parties, said\n\nMr. Dedman. At a certain election\n\nin New South Wales, the then\n\nU.A.P. and the Country Party ad\n\nvised their supporters to vote No. 2\n\nfor the Communist Party. At re\n\ncent elections in Western Australia,\n\nabout 400 Cofhmunist preferences\n\nat Midland Junction were given to\n\nthe Liberal candidate.\n\nMr. Hamilton (C.P., W.A.): That\n\nis,a deliberate lie.\n\nThe Speaker told Mr. Hamilton\n\nthat he had made a very disorderly\n\nremark but Mr. Hamilton was not\n\ncalled on to withdraw.\n\nMr. Dedman said the staff of\n\nthe C.S.I.R. numbered 2,600. but\n\nMr. Abbott could name only one\n\nemployee whom he said was a Com\n\nmunist.\n\nMr. Beale: Why have any at all?\n\nMr. Dedman said that technical\n\nappointments to the CS.I.R. were\n\nmade on the recommendation of the\n\nexecutive committee with the ap\n\nproval of the Minister. It was im\n\npossible for the Minister to examine\n\nevery recommendation that came\n\nbefore him. Mr. Rudkin's appoint\n\nment was recommended by the\n\nexecutive committee in January,\n\n1945. Did any member of the\n\nOpposition believe that any member\n\nof the executive committee was in\n\nany way associated with the Com\n\nmunist Party?\n\nMr. Rndkhu's Position.\n\nAppointments to the staff of the\n\ncouncil were made on merit. If\n\nthe individual had qualifications,\n\nundoubtedly he would receive\n\nappointment. The committee was\n\nnot concerned with his political as\n\nsociations.\n\nMr. McEwen: Irrespective of his\n\nloyalty?\n\nMr. Dedman said it was alleged\n\nagainst Mr. Rudkin that he was\n\nconvicted in Western Australia\n\nabout 1940 for an offence against\n\nNational Security Regulations. In\n\nthat year there was almost hysteria\n\nabout inadequate A.R.P. precau\n\ntions. Many persons were convicted\n\nwho should not have been con\n\nvicted. In the circumstances, the\n\nGovernment was entitled to take no\n\nnotice of the fact that Mr. Rudkin\n\nhad been convicted. The Govern\n\nment believed the interests of the\n\ncountry could best be served by\n\nappointing to the CS.I.R. in\n\ndividuals best qualified."
