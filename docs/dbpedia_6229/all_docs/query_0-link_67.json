Will the Minister advise the House whether the shipping position is as serious as the report to which I have referred suggests, and whether there is any foundation for this pessimistic forecast?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\nMinister for Immigration · MELBOURNE, VICTORIA · ALP\n\n– I have not seen the statement attributed to Mr. Trevor Smith, but I do know that that gentleman is a very dismal prophet about the availability of shipping for immigration. We have very much more shipping available than, from time to time, Mr. Smith forecast would be available. In 1947 the Government brought 30,000 immigrants to Australia in the shipping available and in 1948 it brought 70,000 immigrants here. This year it will bring 110,000 immigrants to the country, of whom 70,000 will be British people who are anxious to come to Australia. I cannot say why this “ Dismal Desmond “ should always be saying that we shall not obtain i his or that amount of shipping to bring immigrants to Australia.\n\nMr McDonald:\n\n– He paid a very nice tribute to the Minister.\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– If he did so, it was well deserved, although I have to overcome my natural modesty to say so. 1 can assure the honorable member for Martin that I shall examine the Melbourne Herald report,’ and if I can improve Mr. Trevor Smith’s outlook by making him less of a pessimist and more of an optimist, I shall be very happy to do so, because I should like his help., as well as the help of every one else who may be able to assist us to get the right atmosphere that we want in this important matter of increasing our population.\n\nMr McLEOD:\n\nWANNON, VICTORIA\n\n– As the Minister for Immigration is aware, ships frequently arrive at the port of Melbourne carrying migrants bound for other States, such as New South Wales and Queensland. Will the Minister give consideration to the desirability of advertising the arrival of these vessels so that the public of Victoria may have an opportunity to extend the hand of friendship to new arrivals who may be obliged to spend a day or two in Melbourne before proceeding to their final destination? This was done in connexion with, the arrival of Ranchi The migrants carried away with them not only a most favorable impression of Australian hospitality but also happy memories of their first contact with the land of their adoption.\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– Ranchi was held up in Melbourne because of some trouble a week or so ago, and the people of the metropolis of Victoria responded magnificently to the appeal of the State migration authorities to give hospitality to the new arrivals. Not only did many people take the British migrants into their homes hut they also took them sightseeing and did everything possible for them. I believe indeed that there were so many offers of hospitality that there were not enough migrants to be taken care of. I expressed appreciation of what the Victorian people did for the new arrivals. I shall see what can be done by_ the Common wealth Deparment of Immigration to announce the arrival of vessels so that if any stoppage should occur in\n\nMelbourne or if any ship is delayed for a lengthy period the people of Victoria will be able to help as they did on the occasion to which I have referred. I do not know whether the newspapers reported my expressions of appreciation but 1 did express them and they were well deserved.\n\nMr THOMPSON:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\n– I ask the Minister for Immigration to state the policy of his department in respect of wives and families of displaced persons who have immigrated to this country. Is anything being done to bring such families to Australia? Does the department take any precaution when selecting displaced persons for immigration to ensure that their wives and families also shall be eligible to come to Australia? Is it possible that we are bringing to this country displaced persons whose dependants may not be regarded as eligible for immigration to Australia because of their -tate of health or other circumstances?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– There are two classes of married displaced persons immigrating to this country. First, there are married men who prefer to come here ahead of their families on a promise that, within six months of their arrival, the Australian Government will embark their dependants for Australia. Secondly, there are married displaced persons who will not travel without their dependants. Many married men in the first category came to Australia with single persons of both sexes in the first few months of the operation of the displaced persons immigration scheme. The average age of immigrants who arrived on the first four immigrant ships, each of which carried approximately 8S5 persons, was only 25 years. Those immigrants were of great value in the production of essential materials in this country because they could all be put to work. We have now decided not only to bring to this country the dependants of immigrants already here, and to ‘house them in camps such as those at Cowra and Uranquinty, in New South Wales, Tatura in Victoria, Northam in Western Australia, and Brighton in Tasmania, but also to embark whole families, the fathers of which would not travel without their dependants. That is being done now. I have no doubt that in the 33,000 displaced persons who will embark for Australia in the first six months of this year at Genoa or Bremerhaven, there will be many dependants of immigrants already here, and many family units in the second category that I have mentioned. Probably by the end of this year all persons who have already immigrated to this country will have their immediate dependants also in Australia. Ii may not be possible to have entire families settled in one town or in one area of employment, hut at least, all the original immigrants will know that their dependants have arrived in Australia, and that they need no longer fear what may happen to them should further trouble occur in Europe. The honorable member has mentioned persons who may not be medically fit to come to Australia. I shall examine that matter further and inform the honorable member of the result of any. decisions reached.’ Generally speaking, any person can come to Australia provided that he or she will not be a charge on the public funds, and provided also of course that he or she is not a sufferer from some infectious or contagious disease. We are acting as humanely and generously as possible, and I can assure the honorable member that, we are doing our utmost to reunite displaced persons already in this country with the families that they left behind.\n\npage 1039\n\nQUESTION\n\nCOMMUNISM\n\nStatement by Mk. L. L. SHARKEY - Allegations by Me. T. C. McGillick.\n\nMr HOLT:\n\nFAWKNER, VICTORIA\n\n– Has the Prime Minister had an opportunity over the week-end to study a published statement that was made by Mr. L. L. Sharkey, the general secretary of the Australian Communist party? In it Mr. Sharkey is reported to have said -\n\nIf Soviet forces, hi pursuit of aggressors, entered Australia, Australian workers would welcome them . . .\n\nIs this statement on similar lines to statements published by Communist spokesmen in other parts of the world in the course of last week? Do those statements coincide with renewed activity in Communist propaganda and agitation in Asiatic countries? Has the Government any information in its possession that would suggest that these are a part of a concerted and Moscow-inspired plan? What action does the Government propose to take in relation to the reported statement by Mr. Sharkey? Will it consider referring to the newly-appointed DirectorGeneral of Security, Mr. Justice Reed, the question of the significance of these developments in Australia in relation to the international developments to which 1 have referred?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\nPrime Minister · MACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– I have not seen the full statement referred to by the honorable member, but my attention has been drawn to that portion of it in which Mr. Sharkey is reported to have said that if Soviet troops entered Australia in pursuit of an aggressor - I do not know precisely what that means - they would have the support of the Communist party. Of course I treat all newspaper reports with some suspicion because they are frequently not accurate. The Acting Attorney-General returned to Canberra to-day, and I have asked him to have the matter examined to see precisely what was said and whether anything said was treacherous or treasonable. In reply to the latter part of the honorable gentleman’s question, I have seen reports of statements made in other countries by Communist leaders. They seem to run along the same lines as the remarks alleged to have been made bv Mr. Sharkey. I am not able to vouch for the accuracy of the newspaper reports of statements made by Communist leaders in other countries, ‘but all the reports have similarity. I cannot say whether Mr. Sharkey’s statements were Moscowinspired, or, as the honorable member said, concerted. I would not be aware of that. I am not in the confidence of the authorities in Moscow on what may be inspired by them or otherwise.\n\nMr Francis:\n\n– What about the local Communists?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\n– I am not in the confidence of the local Communists, either. That privilege seems to be reserved for Opposition members. I have asked the Acting Attorney-General to have the matter investigated.\n\nMr HARRISON:\n\nWENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Will the Prime Minister authorize the security authorities to investigate the statement reported in the Melbourne press on the 1st March to have been made by Mr. T. C. McGillick, former member of the Communist party, that-\n\nUnder the cloak of Labour many Communists had entered the Parliaments of Australia and would be lined up with the Communist party when and if the time came for them to show their true colours.\n\nWill the right honorable gentleman cause an investigation to be made in order to ascertain which members of the Australian Parliaments come within that category, and will he take immediate steps publicly to unmask their activities?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\n– Some irresponsible person has apparently made a statement, which has been seized upon by the press, in which it is suggested that some members of the Australian Labour party are members of the Communist party. I have pointed out in this House on numerous occasions that the constitution of the Australian Labour party prevents any member of any other political party from joining the Australian Labour party. I do not think that any one would question the effectiveness of the screening made by the Australian Labour party of persons who are selected to represent the Labour movement. I do not propose to cause an investigation to be made into such an irresponsible statement as that referred to by the honorable member.\n\npage 1040\n\nQUESTION\n\nNAMING OF POST OFFICES\n\nMr TURNBULL:\n\nWIMMERA, VICTORIA\n\n– Some time ago 1 drew the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to the fact that throughout Australia there are many post offices that give no indication whatever of the names under which they operate. This causes inconvenience to travellers and others. Did the Minister draw the attention of the PostmasterGeneral to the desirability of having names affixed to such post offices, and, if so. what was the Minister’s reply ?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\nALP\n\n– I remember that the honorable gentleman raised this matter in the House and that I promised that I would refer his observations to the PostmasterGeneral and ask for a reply. If the honorable gentleman has not yet received a reply, I shall make a further inquiry and I assure him that he will get one on this occasion.\n\npage 1041\n\nQUESTION\n\nCOMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION COURT\n\nMr LANG:\n\nREID, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I ask the Prime Minister what justification there was for the appointment of Mr. Dunphy, of the Western Australian Arbitration Court, as a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, thereby increasing its strength to five when the court, under the so-called streamlined arbitration system, no longer makes awards but deals only with points of law, standard hours and the basic wage. Is it expected that the new judge will be gainfully employed?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\nALP\n\n– The Government considered that there was ample justification for the appointment of an additional judge to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. As the honorable member is well aware, the chief judge of the court, Chief Judge Drake-Brockman, has been ill for a considerable time and is still very unwell. I hope that he will make a speedy recovery, but my hopes may not be realized. In addition, Mr. Justice Kirby is chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, a position that naturally occupies a great deal of his time. He has a very involved and difficult task to perform in that capacity. The court is at present dealing with a basic wage case, and I do not know how long that will continue. Another matter which will probably have to be dealt with at a later stage is the determination of women’s minimum rates of pay, although I understand that an endeavour is being made to have it dealt with in conjunction with the basic wage case. Should one of the judges at present constituting the court fall ill or be absent for any other reason, it would not be possible for the Full Court to be constituted. There would not be enough judges available. In all the circumstances, and in view of the importance of preventing any delay in dealing with matters, such as the basic wage case, that require the attention of the Full Court, the Government considers that there was ample justification for the appointment of an additional judge.\n\npage 1041\n\nQUESTION\n\nHOUSING\n\nMr WHITE:\n\nBALACLAVA, VICTORIA\n\n– In the absence of the Attorney-General, I direct a question to the Prime Minister. I have here a protest signed by a large number of residents of the Balaclava electorate who claim, among other things, that, through extensive black marketing in flats and houses, such properties are being let or sold to foreigners of short residence in Australia while many children, including the families of ex-servicemen, have been born and brought up in crowded conditions in apartments of only one or two rooms., The parents see little prospect for the future welfare of such children and they ask for a fair and equal chance to lease or purchase flats and houses. The press has stated that the Director of the Commonwealth Legal Service Bureau is to conduct an inquiry into the letting of certain flats in Sydney as the result of a protest from the Air Force Association. Will the Prime Minister extend the scope of that inquiry to cover the matters complained of in the petition that I have received?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\nALP\n\n– I have not seen the press statement mentioned by the honorable member. As he knows, control of the sale of property and of rents has been passed over to the State authorities except that protection has been retained for ex-servicemen under Commonwealth regulations that were promulgated for that purpose. I assume that the honorable member’s question refers particularly to ex-servicemen and their families. I had thought that their rights were being adequately guarded by the existing regulations. However, there may be some abuses of those provisions. The Government made it clear to the State Premiers when it handed control of land sales and rents to them, that it considered that it had a special responsibility to exservicemen. We shall continue to exercise that jurisdiction. If the honorable member will provide me with details of the matter he has mentioned, I shall ask the Attorney-General to widen the scope of any investigation that is being made.\n\npage 1041\n\nQUESTION\n\nEMPLOYMENT\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\nCOWPER, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Has the Prime Minister seen the striking graph published in the latest report of the Public Service Board, which shows the growth of the Commonwealth Public Service? In view of the great interest of the people generally in the percentages of population employed on farms, in industry, and so on, will the right honorable gentleman discuss with the Acting Commonwealth Statistician the preparation of a graph which will show this information at a glance ?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\nALP\n\n– I studied the report of the Public Service Board before I tabled it in the Parliament. I shall discuss with the Acting Commonwealth Statistician, Mr. Carver, the possibility of producing a short pamphlet or an article along the lines of the Public Service Board’s report, which will contain the information desired by the right honorable gentleman.\n\npage 1042\n\nQUESTION\n\nWIRE AND WIRE NETTING\n\nMr DUTHIE:\n\nWILMOT, TASMANIA\n\n– Is the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture able to indicate when the 24,000 tons of plain wire and wire netting for which import licences have been issued, will arrive in Australia from Western Europe ? Will the wire be distributed on a State quota system in proportion to the present quota system?\n\nMr POLLARD:\n\nMinister for Commerce and Agriculture · BALLAARAT, VICTORIA · ALP\n\n– I am unable to state the date of the expected arrival of the wire and wire netting which has been ordered overseas by various importers. The date of arrival will be entirely dependent on the date on which orders were lodged and on the ability of the importers to obtain the requisite shipping space. I shall endeavour to obtain the information which the honorable gentleman seeks. In regard to the second part of the question, the Australian Government does not control the distribution of imported wire or wire netting. That is done by the importers. The Government co-operate3 with manufacturers in Australia ‘ to ensure that locally made wire is distributed equitably to the States.\n\npage 1042\n\nQUESTION\n\nWHEAT\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nINDI, VICTORIA\n\n– I address a question to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture relative to the negotiations in Washington for the conclusion of an international wheat agreement. Did the Australian Wheat Growers Federation ask the Government to be permitted to send . a representative to Washington to accompany the Government negotiators? Is the honorable gentleman aware that the Canadian Farmers Federation and the United States National Farmers Union each has at Washington an observer and an adviser to assist the governmental delegations? In that way they hope to ensure that the interests of the wheatgrowers of Canada and the United States will be protected during the negotiations. Finally, after the Australian Government had refused to permit a representative of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation to accompany the Australian delegation, did that body inform the Government that it was prepared to send a representative at its own expense? If so, was that offer refused ?\n\nMr POLLARD:\n\nALP\n\n– The general secretary of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, Mr. Stott, M.H.A., of South Australia, did ask the Government to approve of the federation sending a representative to the international wheat conference at Washington, but the Government would have had to hear all his expenses and accredit him as a member of the Australian delegation. On behalf of the Government I informed Mr. Stott that, since the conference was to be conducted on a government-to-government basis and the representatives of the various governments were the only delegates who would be able to speak with authority, as was the case at the last conference, this Government was not prepared to pay the expenses of a representative of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. I point out that even had the Government acceded to that request, the subsequent course of proceedings at Washington has demonstrated that any person who attended as the representative of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, or any other organization, for that matter, would have been quite incapable of expounding the policy of the federation or of informing his executive from day to day of the trend of events and of taking instructions from it. In other words, he would have been confronted with the responsibility of speaking and voting without directions from the body which he represented. In those circumstances the attendance of a representative of the federation could have served no good purpose. The honorable member inquired whether a representative of Canadian Farmers -Federation was present at Washington. I understand that that was so; but the decision of the governments of other countries to permit representatives in an advisory capacity to their delegations, could not, of course, commit the Australian Government to follow a similar course. In reply to the third portion of the honorable member’s question, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation did not ask, and, therefore, was not refused, the right to send an advisory representative at the expense of that body.\n\nMr HOWSE:\n\nCALARE, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether the Government has sold any of the 1948-49 wheat crop? Is the Government still awaiting the conclusion of negotiations for international wheat agreement? Does he consider that the large accumulation of wheat reported to be held in the United States of America and Canada will affect the price which Australia is likely to receive for its crop?\n\nMr POLLARD:\n\n– Some of the 1948-49 crop has been sold by the Australian. Wheat Board and negotiations, which have been protracted, are taking place for the sale of additional quantities of that crop to the United Kingdom and India. The Government has sought the advice of the Australian Wheat Board concerning prices and conditions of sale, and has followed the advice tendered by the board. Decisions ultimately reached at the [international Wheat Conference may have some bearing on the negotiation with the United Kingdom and India.\n\npage 1043\n\nQUESTION\n\nELECTORAL\n\nMr SHEEHAN:\n\nCOOK, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Recently, a brochure was issued by the Commonwealth Electoral Office setting out details of the Senate. system of voting under the system of proportional representation. Can the Minister for the Interior inform me whether that brochure is available for sale to the public? If not, will he consider making copies of it available in that way ?\n\nMr JOHNSON:\n\nMinister for the Interior · KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– I asked the Chief Electoral Officer to prepare’ a brochure setting out the method of counting the\n\nSenate vote under the proportional representation system, but I did not instruct him to make copies of it available for public sale. However, I shall consider the honorable member’s request, and inform him of my decision.\n\npage 1043\n\nQUESTION\n\nCOAL\n\nMr JAMES:\n\nHUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Has the Prime Minister seen press reports to the effect that two mines in the northern coal-fields area are subject to heating, due to spontaneous combustion, and that thousands of tons of coal are likely to be lost ? This process of heating is characteristic of the Greta seam, and some parts of the GretaBranxton seam have been practically ruined. Does the right honorable gentleman consider that it is time the Joint Coal Board obtained the services of experts from overseas to report on way and means of controlling this grave danger, which may cause not only a loss of life but also the loss of assets worth millions of pounds? Will the Prime Minister inform me whether the Joint Coal Board itself has authority to bring experts to this country for the purpose that I have mentioned, or must the board obtain the Government’s permission before it may act?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\nALP\n\n– I take this opportunity, on behalf of the House, to welcome the honorable member for Hunter on his return to the Parliament after his long and serious illness. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel has informed me that the heating of seams in the northern coal-fields area has been examined on previous occasions, and is being examined even at the present time. The Joint Coal Board is not restricted, within reason, anyhow, in arranging to obtain such expert advice as it may consider necessary to carry out its functions. In accordance with the provisions of the Coal Industry Act, the only real authorities in the formulation of joint policy are the Premier of New South Wales and myself. I do not know whether the Joint Coal Board desires to bring experts to Australia in order to examine and advise on the causes of heating in certain mines, but I shall have inquiries made and inform the honorable member of the precise position.\n\npage 1044\n\nQUESTION\n\nJAPAN\n\nAdmission of Australians - Frank Loyal Weaver\n\nMr DAVIDSON:\n\nCAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND\n\n– According to a press statement, an Australian serviceman, who recently returned from Japan, stated that he had married a Japanese woman and intended to return to Japan, irrespective pf whether he was granted a passport or not. Has the Minister for Immigration seen that report, and will he indicate the policy of his department in dealing with an application for a passport in such circumstances ?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\nALP\n\n– I have no objection to issuing a passport to any one who wants to leave Australia, and that statement applies to Australian soldiers who desire to live in Japan. The problem of a soldier who wants to go back to Japan in order to marry a Japanese woman, or live with a Japanese bride whom he has married in a Shinto temple, or to open a cafe, as some ex-servicemen claim to be desirous of doing, is a matter for General MacArthur to decide. No person may enter Japan unless General MacArthur permits him to do so. The problem of the Australian soldiers to whom the honorable member referred is not one for the Australian Government or the Australian people, but for General MacArthur. If I may digress at this stage, I should like to point out that this morning, I received a letter from an Australian soldier who said that he wanted to return to Japan and become a Japanese citizen. He has a girl friend in that country, whom he wants to marry, and has asked me to expedite his exit. I would not be averse to doing what he wants, .but General MacArthur stands in the way. Unless General MacArthur can be convinced of the advisability of allowing that Australian soldier to go to Japan, I cannot do any more about the matter.\n\nMr ARCHIE CAMERON:\n\nPostmaster-General · BARKER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– Has the Minister for the Army observed the announcement in the Sydney press last week that Mr. Weaver may present a petition to support his request to the Government that he be allowed to go back to Japan? In view of the fact that the Minister has shown certain courtesies to that gentleman, will he take the oppor tunity to make a statement to the House so that well-meaning people will not be deceived into believing that Weaver has a case when, if he did in Japan what he has done in Australia, he would be “ up “ on a very serious charge indeed ?\n\nMr CHAMBERS:\n\nMinister for the Army · ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– I have read a report that Weaver is preparing a petition in Sydney and that he will endeavour to obtain 1,000,000 signatures to it. I advise the people of Sydney not to sign that petition. In view of the action Weaver is taking, and the suggestion made by the honorable member, I shall ask for the leave of the House later this week to make a statement in order to let the people of Australia know just what sort of a man Weaver is.\n\npage 1044\n\nQUESTION\n\nWATERFRONT EMPLOYMENT\n\nMr HUTCHINSON:\n\nDEAKIN, VICTORIA\n\n– I address to the Prime Minister a question relating to the dispute which originated in Sydney as the result of certain demands made on wool-growers and others by the Storemen and Packers Union. This dispute has caused the hold up of the export of Australian wool valued at £5,000,000 and threatens the employment of thousands of people in the leather, shoe, and bootmaking trades. Has the Prime Minister been asked to intervene in the dispute,, and if he has, does he intend to take that action? Will he say how far the Communist menace has intruded in the dispute, and to what degree the Communists are responsible for it? How much longer will the Government tolerate these hold ups of Australia’s export trade, and these threats to the employment of thousands of people, when the disputes which give rise to such a position are in direct defiance of the Government’s policy of conciliation and arbitration?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\nALP\n\n– The matter that the honorable member has mentioned is being dealt with by the appropriate tribunals.\n\nMr Hutchinson:\n\n– But they are not handling it.\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\n– If the honorable member means that they have not yet reached a solution of the difficulty, that is correct.\n\nMr McEwen:\n\n– The matter is sub judice.\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\n– If the honorable member raises that point I accept it, but I say that the matter is still the subject of negotiations. “With regard to the latter portion of the honorable member’s question, as I have said before, it is most regrettable that hold-ups causing delays to shipping should occur, particularly since in some instances they are without warrant. There is no justification for the present dispute extending as it has done. Certain persons have been appointed to arbitrate upon and seek to settle these disputes. The matter isin the hands of the court. I do not know what the honorable member means when he asks whether the Government will intervene, because both Federal and State tribunals have power to act in these matters. Everything possible is being done by the Minister for Labour and National Service to see whether a solution of this trouble can be reached.\n\npage 1045\n\nQUESTION\n\nABORIGINES\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\nRICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– My question relates to a report that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of last Friday, concerning an aboriginal woman who has two half-caste children. According to the newspaper article, the woman was employed in a Sydney home as a domestic, and was very happy and contented. Her children were in an orphanage. The Department of the Interior intervened and compelled the woman to send her children back to Alice Springs, and gave her the option of either going with them or remaining in Sydney. She had saved £100–\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER:\n\n-I thought that the honorable member desired to ask a question, not make a statement.\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\n– I am merely outlining the circumstances of the matter, on which my question is based. When the department learned about her savings it made a demand upon her for the amount of her fare to Alice Springs. Will the Minister for the Interior inform the House whether the statements contained in the newspaper article are correct, and if so, what justification exists for the action that was taken by the department ?\n\nMr JOHNSON:\n\nALP\n\n– I welcome the honorable member’s question. There is not an atom of truth in the statements that were published in the Sydney. Morning Herald. When a reporter employed by that journal asked me to comment on this matter I told him that I definitely denied the allegation that had been made in the newspaper article.I said that the total fares of all aborigines and children who had been returned to Alice Springs had been paid by the Department of the Interior, that the officer in charge of Native Affairs had no knowledge of the bank account of the women mentioned or of any money having been withdrawn from her account by her, or anybody else, in order to pay her fare to Alice Springs. The Sydney Morning Herald did not have the courtesy to acknowledge or publish the reply which I gave to its allegations.\n\npage 1045\n\nQUESTION\n\nALICE SPRINGS\n\nMr BLAIN:\n\nNORTHERN TERRITORY\n\n– Great inconvenience is experienced not only by business people but also by residents generally of Alice Springs because the causeway across the Todd River connecting the western part of the town with the new town to the east is not capable of carrying traffic after a storm. Will the Minister for the Interior confer with the Minister for Works and Housing with a view to providing a suitableviaduct, or bridge, across the ToddRiver to replace the existing causeway ?\n\nMr JOHNSON:\n\nALP\n\n– I know that the present ToddRiver crossing is by no means satisfactory. The Department of Works and Housing has already made a survey of the locality for the purpose of finding a more suitable site for a crossing. Provision for that purpose was made in the last Estimates. I shall confer with the Minister for Works and Housing on the subject, and inform the honorable member of the progress that has been made with that proposal.\n\npage 1045\n\nQUESTION\n\nDOLLAR DEFICITS\n\nRO AD-MAKING MACHINERY.\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\n– I have received complaints from many shire councils throughout my electorate that they are at a serious disadvantage in repairing back roads owing to the lack of materials, labour and machinery, particularly large earth-moving machinery. The Northern Rivers Shires Association has asked me to submit to the Prime Minister a request that the Government reconsider its policy which is based on the scarcity of dollars, with respect to the importation of such machinery and spare parts from the United States of America. Will the right honorable gentleman give further consideration to the desirability of allowing the importation of machinery and spare parts which are vital to the construction and maintenance of roads in the various shires?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\nALP\n\n– I shall examine the matter which the honorable member has raised, particularly the importation of spare parts for road-making machinery, because I realize the necessity to maintain in good order all of the roadmaking machinery at present available in this country. The Government, when allocating dollars, keeps in mind the amount of heavy industrial plant, including agricultural machinery, which can be imported from dollar and hard currency areas. The honorable member’s request will be considered.\n\npage 1046\n\nQUESTION\n\nMR. AINSLIE ST. AUBYN KINGSFORD\n\nMr HOLT:\n\n– I desire to ask a question of the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. Has he seen a statement by the Victorian Commissioner of Police, Mr. Duncan, that no request had been receivedby the Police Department of that State to inquire into the whereabouts of Mr. Ainslie St. Aubyn Kingsf ord ? If so, will the Minister take action, through the Commonwealth Investigation Service, to request the police authorities in the various States to institute inquiries? As a rumour has been circulated that Mr. Kingsford has been seen in New Zealand, I ask whether a report can be obtained from the New Zealand police on the matter?\n\nMr CHIFLEY:\n\nALP\n\n– I have read a report about the disappearance of Mr. Kingsford. I understand that he went for a ferry trip to Manly, and has not been seen since. Several reports have been received by the police in New South Wales that somebody resembling him has been seen, but when inquiries were made, the reports were shown to be without foundation. J. gave a long reply last week to a question asked on this subject by a member of the Opposition. I understand that it is the practice of the police departments in the variousStates to keep in touch with one another about inquiries of this kind. If the police in New South Wales believed the matter to be of sufficient importance they would circulate a description of the man to the police in other States. The honorable member has suggested that an investigation might be made by the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. I shall discuss the matter with the Acting Attorney-General in order to see whether it wouldbe practicable to adopt the honorable member’s suggestion.\n\npage 1046\n\nNEW GUINEA TIMBER RIGHTS COMMISSION BILL 1949\n\nAssent reported.\n\npage 1046\n\nCOMMUNISM\n\nFormal Motion for. Adjournment\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Clark:\n\nDARLING, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I have received from the honorable member for Reid (Mr. Lang) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely-\n\nThe statement made by Mr. L. L. Sharkey on behalf of the Communist party of Australia as a declaration of allegiance to the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, and its treasonable implications in relation to the defence security of this country.\n\nMr LANG:\n\nReid\n\n.- I move-\n\nThat the House do now adjourn.\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER:\n\n– Is the motion supported ?\n\nFive honorable members having risen in support of the motion,\n\nMr LANG:\n\n- Mr. L. L. Sharkey is Australia’s number one Communist. As such, he is the boss of the local Communist organization, but he is also the stooge of the overseas bosses, and it is his job to carry out the orders he receives from overseas. He did so last week. The Soviet Foreign Office launched an all-out offensive through the Cominform. It used its agents throughout the world.\n\nMoscow regarded the directive as an ultimatum to the western world. In effect, it meant that if Russia became involved in war, the Communist party in every country opposed to Russia would embark on a programme of civil war. ‘11 Communists would have one aim only - to destroy, from within, the war machine of every country opposed to Russia. That, I say to the House and the country, is treason. It was a treasonable declaration in every country where communism is at present not in control.\n\nIn Australia, Sharkey made the declaration on behalf of the Communist party. The verbiage that he used does not matter. The real significance of his statement is that it synchronized with similar statements by Communist bosses in other countries. That was not coincidence. The -order came from the Cominform. The local bosses responded immediately. They bowed to r.heir josses overseas. The Kremlin regarded it as a test operation, designed to threaten western countries and also to alert Moscow’s subsidiaries abroad.\n\nIt was not what Sharkey said that should be considered, but what he meant. Sharkey meant exactly what every other Communist boss meant, when he carried out similar instructions and issued a declaration similar to those that were issued in Paris, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, London and Helsinki. The French Communist boss, Thorez, said that the French Communist party would do everything to make a war against Russia not only difficult, but impossible. The Italian Communist boss, Togliatti, said that it would be the duty of the Italian Communists to help the Soviet army if it chased an aggressor on to Italian soil. Britain’s Communist boss, Harry Pollitt, said that British Communists would cause strikes in industry in the event of war with Russia. In New York a similar statement was made by William Z. Foster. Similar statements came from Argentina, Cuba, Austria, Finland and every other country where the Communist party is permitted ro function. Sharkey’s statement was - [f Soviet forces, in pursuit of aggressors, filtered Australia, Australian workers would welcome them.\n\nSharkey thought he was being clever. But it is still sedition to welcome troops from another country, if this country happens to be at war with that country. It is treason.\n\nSharkey believed that he was sidestepping the law. He was quibbling with phrases, but his intent is perfectly clear. The Communists would term British troops defending Malaya “ aggressors “. If the Soviet army pursued British or American troops to this country, then the local Communists would welcome the Russians, .Sharkey said. He meant that in the event of war with Soviet Russia, the local Communists would fight on the side of Russia. Sharkey’s orders were to convey that impression throughout the world. The Communists broadcast Sharkey’s statement over Moscow radio for that purpose. Any country resisting Soviet imperialism is an aggressor nation, according to current Communist doctrine. So, to Sharkey, this country is an aggressor nation. What does this Government intend to do about Sharkey? I know what would happen to an Australian if he made a statement like that in Moscow.\n\nThis Government’s policy towards the Communists has been one of total appeasement. That is why Sharkey is game to make such a statement. The Communists hold the Australian Government in contempt. This Government extends its favours to Communists. It puts them on boards which govern key industries. The Communists operate within the law, because the law is the Government and the Government believes in a policy of absolute immunity for Communists. Is the Government afraid to take up .Sharkey’s challenge? Statements about referring the matter to the Crown Law authorities are all moonshine. If the law does not fit circumstances like this, then it is time the law was made . to fit them. It is this Parliament’s job to do that. Tt is not the duty of the Crown Law Office. Here we have evidence of the Australian Communist party’s open collaboration with other Communist organizations throughout the world in issuing threats of civil war against any government that resists the Soviet Union. The Communists threaten civil war. Yet we are told that communism is a harmless philosophy. It is not. It is a deadly formula of mass extermination and slavery for any free people who might fall into its clutches. “This country is one of the objectives. It 5s directly in the path of the Soviet land drive through South-East Asia. So Sharkey’s declaration must be dealt with on that basis. Dealing with Sharkey would not end the menace of communism in Australia. Much more than that is needed. Communism must be fought with nil the resources at the Government’s disposal. I challenge the Prime Minister to take action now. There is only one language that the Communists understand. That is to get tough. The Communist thrives on the present Government’s attitude of passive acceptance and conciliation. The statement by the South African Minister for Internal Affairs regarding the activities of the Soviet legation in that country, and of the courier service that is being maintained should be examined carefully. If we consider what has been exposed in Canada and the United States we might ask ourselves why this Government should believe that this country is immune just because it handles communism with kid gloves? There is only one possible course of action to be taken. We must declare war on the Communist party in Australia and use every existing means to’ stamp it out of existence. We should ban it and make consorting with members of the party illegal. We should rid every defence agency of the Communists. We should kick them out of key union positions. We should cut off their lines of communication.\n\nSharkey at present has freedom of access to telecommunications, telegraphic, telephonic and postal services. The Communist official organ carries thousands of words of cabled news each week, all of which get the benefit of special cheap press rates from this Government. In a recent issue of that organ, there were long special cables from Cuba, from Athens, from Vienna, from New Delhi and from Sofia as well as from Moscow, London and New York. Sharkey is thus in a position to know immediately how the Communists in other countries are operating. That explains the military precision with which Communist activities such as the current offensive are co-ordinated all over the world. The Communists are using machinery provided by this Government. This Government must answer to the people foi’ permitting this to be done. The Government is either with Sharkey or against him. It is either with the Communist party or against it. If it is against Sharkey and his party let it act. I have moved this motion in order to give the the Government an opportunity to indicate that it is going to act. There have been too many excuses, too many alibis. It may soon be too late to act. I hope that some action will be taken.\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\nMinister for Information and Minister for Immigration · Melbourne · ALP\n\n– The first country to suppress communism was the first country to become Communist. That country was Russia. Those are not my words; they are the words of Governor Dewey, leader of the Republican forces in the United States of America, and they were uttered in the course of a debate with Governor Stassen in Oregon. And, if there is one country that is the citadel of rugged individualism it is the United States of America. Yet not one political leader, in the Republican party, the Democratic party, the Wallace party or in the Dixiecrats - and they count for nothing, anyway - has gone on record as favouring the suppression of the Communist party.\n\nMr Holt:\n\n– The President of the United States of America said that a member of the Communist party was a traitor.\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– He may have called a certain man in the United States a traitor, but he did not call for legislation to ban the Communist party, and what the honorable member for Reid (Mr. Lang) suggested in his attack upon Sharkey is that we should ban the Communist party.\n\nMr Holt:\n\n– No; he asked what steps the Government was going to take?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– He said that we should ban the Communist party and that wa should declare war on it. I am referring to the honorable gentleman’s words. There is no nation in the western world, with the exception of Canada, that has declared the Communist party an illegal body: and, in Canada, when the Communist party was banned, the Communists promptly re-organized themselves and became the Progressive Labour party. When Fred Bose, a member of the Canadian House of Commons, was arrested as a spy, he was not nominally a member of the Communist party, he was arrested as a member of the Progressive Labour party. Yet all the time, he was a member of the Communist party. The mere declaration of the Communist party as illegal and the mere suppression of the Communists would not achieve the purposes that some people in this country believe that such actions will achieve. The Communist party has been in existence for many years in all countries. It is an international, united body. I believe- that the Cominform, in respect of directions from Moscow, does its work in international affairs in the interests of the people who control the Cominform. But suppression is almost as old as history as an idea for beating all other ideas. It has never yet achieved the purpose that those who use suppression would lead us to believe it does achieve. In Great Britain, Harry Pollitt said almost the same thing that Sharkey said in this country. When we heard of what Sharkey had said, the matter was referred to the Crown Law authorities for action. The Crown Law authorities were asked to see whether the statements were treasonable. If a prima facie case is made out, the Crown Law authorities will take appropriate action. When a man named Burns made a somewhat similar statement in Queensland some time ago, the Government prosecuted him, and he was convicted and sentenced. Mr. Holt. - Which Government?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– This Government. Burns, I understand has appealed to the High Court against his conviction. We believe in prosecuting people who break the law, whether they be Communist or non-Communist, rather than in suppressing parties. The suppression of parties, we believe, in the long run achieves nothing. Mr. Ernest Bevin. whose opinions will be accepted by all members of this House, went on record as recently as the 21st February last as saying -\n\nThere are no concentration camps in Britain, no imprisonment for views. Even the Communists can say whatever they like about us. We rely, not on secret police but on the common sense of the great democracy of out country.\n\nIf anybody in this Parliament disagrees with Mr. Ernest Bevin’s general policy, let him rise and say so. What Mr. Bevin has said, Mr. Attlee said only a few days ago in similar terms. In France, where the Communist party is a very large and influential political force, the Queuille Government has not taken the step of suppressing communism because of something that Maurice Thorez has said. In Italy the Italian Government has not suppressed the Communist party of Italy because of anything that Signer Togliatti has had to say. The governments of those countries believe that people should be prosecuted according to the law and that the security police should do their work in finding any treasonable elements in the community, if such there be, and in prosecuting them for the things that they do and say. The honorable member who submitted the motion now before the House waxed eloquent about the necessity for suppressing communism. Let him, or anybody else in this Parliament, tell me the name of one prominent church leader of any Christian denomination in this country who has ever advocated, or who advocates to-day, the suppression of the Communist party. No honorable member will say that the leaders of organized religion in Australia are not sensible of the dangers of communism.\n\nMr Harrison:\n\n– Did the Minister say that nothing could be gained by suppression ?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– I believe that in the long run suppression would produce worse results than will occur if the persons who preach subversive doctrines are permitted to function openly and are prosecuted for their actions against the law.\n\nMr Harrison:\n\n– If the honorable gentleman believes that, will he give us an assurance that there will be no suppression of this debate ?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– Neither this Government, nor the party which it represents, has ever appeased the Communist party. We have always been opposed to the philosophy, practices and doctrines of the Communist party, and we have declared over and over again that between the Labour party and the Communist party there is an unbridgeable gulf.\n\nThe Labour party, in opposing communism, also opposes capitalism, which produces communism and that foetid, corrupt by-product which is known in the political life of this country as Langism. Langism is merely a product of capitalism, but there was a day when the honorable member for Reid sat cheek by jowl with Communists. It was the Communists who surrounded Parliament House in Sydney, after Dooley had been defeated for leadership of the State Labour party, and demanded that no members of the caucus of that day should leave the building until a man named Lang had been elected. He sat side by side with Garden, who was a Communist candidate at one time. He did not disagree with Garden when Garden said of him that he was greater than Lenin, although perhaps he thought that he was twice as great as Lenin. In those days, Sharkey and Miles and all the people in the Communist party wanted Lang as the leader of the State Labour party in New South Wales. Only when he fell out with them did he become so violent and vitriolic. Let those who come into court at least have clean hands! Those of us who are in the Labour party to-day have never had any association with communism and we have no desire to be associated with it. Honorable members opposite, in the Liberal party at any rate, have only recently been converted to the doctrine that the Communist party must be suppressed. I could quote many speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) in other days pleading for freedom of speech and saying that he did not believe in suppressing the Communist party. Of course, he would say, “ That was yesterday. Times are different. I now have a different view upon the matter “. He has a different view because he has a lot of weak-minded followers whom he has to lead, and they have decided upon a policy which, whether he likes it or not, he must advocate. I am perfectly satisfied that, if the Leader of the Opposition held a different view from that of all of his followers, he could still be right and they could still be wrong. I should like to hear from honorable members opposite who are going to speak upon this matter whether they stand with Governor Dewey, President Truman, Mr. Attlee and Mr. Bevin and whether they share the views of such a conservative newspaper as the Observer of London. On the 21st. March, 194S, the Observer had this to say -\n\nTo ban totalitarian movements in this country, at present, would probably do more practical harm than practical good. But where security secrets come in, further issues arise.\n\nThat newspaper had more to say on the question of the purge that the conservatives in Great Britain were advocating at that time. Nobody will claim that the Economist is any more radical than is the Ob/server. On the 20th March, 194S. the Economist stated -\n\nNothing in the Prime Minister’s statement warrants a general attack upon the Communists’ right to hold their views, to express them and to be employed in work for which they are competent and which has no bearing on national security.\n\nThe Economist held that the Communists had the right to express their views and to be engaged in government employment provided that they were not engaged upon work affecting national security.\n\nAll of those opinions mount up against the hysteria of the press of Australia and of members of the Opposition parties who think that, by carrying out a campaign against communism, they will be able to make up for their lack of statesmanship ; that, if they squeal enough about Communists, the people will forget that they have no policy upon anything but communism ; and that, if they cry out loud enough, the people will forget that there is more disunity in their ranks than there is trouble in the countries where the Communist party is strong. I refer them to a statement that was made on the 31st March last year by the Archbishop of Fork. Dr. Garbett. What he said tunes in with everything that any church leader who has spoken on the subject in Australia has said. This is what he said -\n\nIn ourown country we must set the example of avoiding panic or anything like hysteria.\n\nThere are necessary precautions the State must take for its own security, but there must be no “ spy mania “ nor “ witch-hunting “.\n\nHonorable members opposite can offer no reasoned argument against such eminent people. They just scream out that Sharkey has made a certain statement and that therefore the Communist party must be suppressed and Communists must be rooted out of every occupation that they hold.\n\nThe way to defeat the idea of communism is to produce a better idea. There will be no Communists in the world, certainly not in Australia, when we get rid of monopoly capitalism. Most of the Communists who are in Australia to-day were produced during the depression years. They became Communists because anti-Labour governments asked men to live on starvation rates of pay and to sleep in all sorts of hovels. Many newspapers have expressed opinions upon this matter, and only last week the Murdoch press - the Melbourne Herald in the evening and the Sun NewsPictorial on the following morning - bitterly condemned the action of Melbourne city councillors who had refused to give permission to a man named John Rodgers to hold a meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall to express his views upon Russia. When I read the opinions expressed in the Herald and the Sun N ews-Pictorial I was amazed at the volte face which had occurred in the editorial views of those Murdoch newspapers. The Sun News-Pictorial went so far as to say that Voltaire had actually anticipated the leaderwriter of that newspaper when he said that he would fight to the death for the right of his opponent to express his view. Honorable members opposite, in cheering on their de facto leader as they are bound to do to prove that they are fellow travellers with him in his campaign against the Communist party are out of tune with their own press. But there is one newspaper in this country which, like all newspapers of its persuasion, has been vehement in its opposition to communism as a philosophy. I refer to the Catholic Worker, which, in April of last year stated -\n\nIt’s time we realized that the danger to Australia will be averted only by positive democracy rather than mere opposition to communism . . . the average Australian is not a Communist but in fact is wholeheartedly against communism.\n\nThe article expressed the view that the average Australian is apathetic, and continued -\n\nThe reason for the apathy may be put this way: that the Australian knows quite well what he is against but he doesn’t know what he’s for. He’s come to a full stop. He’s got everything that modern society can give and he’s had it. Compare the Communist. He is certainly against quite a lot of things. He’s against capitalism, he’s against nationalism, democracy, religion, and so on. But this is not the whole story - he’s for something, he’s for a completely new form of society based upon certain principles which he regards and reveres as dogmas. They are as false as his new society is barbaric, but at least they have been sufficient to inspire him to great enthusiasm, unrelenting industry and not a little self-sacrifice. In other words, he has faith.\n\nThe Labour party, too, has faith. It has faith that its policy and philosophy will give to the Australian people the things they need. It has faith that only by the triumph of democracy over capitalism can the country be saved from the evils of capitalism, communism, and the other false dogmas that are being preached as panaceas for the uplift and salvation of mankind.\n\nMr Harrison:\n\n– That is the Marxian theory itself.\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\nMELBOURNE, VICTORIA · ALP\n\n– The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) does not know anything about any theory. He is the biggest galah in this Parliament. He merely talks what is presented to him and what he is taught in Ashstreet from week to week. I know where he goes. There is a building in Ash-street which is owned or leased by the Liberal party. In the cellars, the Communist party is located. In the garret, the Liberal party holds out. That is why the honorable member gets his story mixed. No political party, organization or section of the community in Australia more completely and utterly rejects the beliefs and practices of the Communist party than do the Australian Labour party and the present Government. The whole history of the world has, unfortunately, been one of violence and bloodshed; but neither in the ancient past nor in recent years has there been very much evidence that force can succeed for long. The armies of Napoleon and Hitler marched across\n\nEurope, but they did not survive. The days of the Roman Empire seemed long and, in fact, Rome held sway for many centuries over practically all of the then known world; but Rome fell into decay, and the Christians who had been suppressed by the Romans eventually triumphed over the false philosophy of Rome. Honorable members opposite know nothing but suppression; nothing but the use of force ; nothing but Hitlerian practices; and nothing but the barbaric and pagan methods of other days.\n\nMr Menzies:\n\n– Would the Minister regard the “gag” as a weapon of suppression?\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– Not when it is applied to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies).\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER:\n\n– Order ! The Minister’s time has expired.\n\nMr ARCHIE CAMERON:\n\nBarker · ALP\n\n– The Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell) reminds me of an Irishman with whom I sat in the South Australian Parliament. He once accused another member of that legislature of having talked for an hour’ and a half around the subject without having touched it once. That is what the Minister has done in the last twenty minutes. The honorable member for Reid (Mr. Lang) made a specific motion relating to a treasonable utterance by a man whom he has designated the No. 1 Communist in Australia. The Minister did not mention that man or his alleged statement. He talked about Mr. Truman calling people traitors. I remember when, in one of the darkest hours of World War II., the then Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. John Curtin, called the coal miners traitors and worse, but nothing was done about it. Addressing the Labour party’s Easter conference last year, the Minister for Information said that the greatest menace to the workers was not communism but capitalism. The honorable gentleman did not say anything about that to-day. He dived off into history. Without embarking upon an historical discussion at present, let me tell him that his history is all haywire, and not only in relation to Communists. I shall give one illustration. The honorable gentleman referred to the spread of Christianity.\n\nI ask him what happened to the Christian civilizations in Asia and Africa when the Islamic armies struck. There was no compromise. The Christians went down because of the exercise of the very thing in which the Communist believes - force. The Communists believe in the supremacy of the minority. They have no moral principles such as we have. They believe that anything they do to attain their objective is right. They are permitted by weak-kneed governments of the type that the Australian people are now keeping in power under the name of Labour - I could use another term - to advocate treachery, sabotage and the downfall of lawfully constituted authority. All that the Minister can say is that an old bogy has been brought forward by the honorable member for Reid, who at one time was more or less closely associated with Mr. Garden. Probably, like another prominent member of the Labour party, he has long, and perhaps more successfully, repented that association.\n\nBefore long, this country must face the fact that we cannot deal with the Communists by argument. They do not know what argument is. The only weapon they understand is force. One has only to read the history of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Bulgana, Roumania, Austria and any other country that the Communists have penetrated to know that the rights of the people as individuals, or in the mass, do not matter in the slightest to the Communists. I warn the Minister that if Mr. Sharkey and his henchmen were able to take over the administration of this, country tomorrow morning, the Minister in all probability would be one of the first to be hanged to the nearest lamp-post or tree. His faith in freedom of speech and the presentation of a perfectly reasoned case against communism would not matter the moment they got, not the numbers, but the power. Our democracy rests upon the rule of the majority. The Communist idea is dictatorship by the minority.’ They believe that the majorities are there only to be dictated to and to be trodden on just as majorities have been trodden on in every country that the Communist forces have infiltrated. The Minister has offered no answer at all to the honorable member for Reid. He can talk about the de facto leader of the Opposition and so on, but I remind him that he himself is not the quietest of men under a leader of whom he does not approve. This House has had very definite evidence of that. He would do well to keep off that particular little bit of ground. The memories of some of us are not so short that we have forgotten that already.\n\nMr.Calwell. - Keep going !\n\nMr ARCHIE CAMERON:\n\n– I saw the honorable gentleman push his way into the Ministry like a bull at a gate, but, having got there, he does not know what to do. He was given a portfolio–\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER:\n\n– Order ! The honorable member for Barker must deal with the terms of the motion before the Chair.\n\nMr ARCHIE CAMERON:\n\n– I am sticking to them much more closely than did the Minister for Information. He did not deal with Sharkey. He did not say whether or not the Government would take any action against Sharkey. He did not say what the Government proposed to do about this latest published statement of Sharkey. He did not say whether the Government would take any positive action against this man who has talked treason in the community by saying that in the event of Australia being invaded by Russian forces, he would advise the working men of this country to welcome them. I advise the Minister to look up recent history and see how the women of Berlin and Vienna were treated by the so-called liberating forces of the Red Army. It is one of the dirtiest and rottenest pages in the history of mankind. Frightful things were perpetrated by the Russians, who were called our allies during the last four years of the war. These are the forces that Sharkey proposes to welcome to Australia. Any man who says one word in favour of welcoming the Russian forces to Australia should be tarred and feathered and hounded out of the country. The Government, however, is not prepared to take a stand one way or another against this man, who pleads for support for and toleration of an army of the type which marched into civilized central Europe. It is a shame that there is in occupancy of the treasury bench in this\n\nNational Parliament a Government which is not prepared to deal with the human vermin who make up the Communist party. The members of that party should be hounded out of the country. The Minister for Information talks about his opposition to the Communist party, and says that the Government may have to do this, that or the other thing. If, when he returns to his hotel to-night, he finds a death adder in his bedroom will he argue with it about its rights, or will he get a stick and kill it? It is possible, of course, that he will take the thing to bed with him. I do not know. . The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) has just handed me a press cutting relating to a statement made by a Mr. T. C. McGillick, another gentleman who has apparently seen the light. Mr. McGillick was the head of the Communist party in Adelaide prior to the depression.\n\nMr Calwell:\n\n– He is now working for the Constitutional League.\n\nMr ARCHIE CAMERON:\n\n– He, like Kravchenko, was a “ died-in-the-wool “ Communist, as was also the somewhat famous lady who jumped out of a window in her anxiety not to go back to Russia. Apparently an increasing number of Communists are seeing the light. Another matter that the Minister for Immigration and Sharkey and his cohorts have to explain is why there is a constant flow of deserters from the Red Army in central Europe, to the American, British and French zones. These deserters have seen the results of the so-called democratic system of government followed in Russia, under which no regard whatsoever is paid to the rights of man and to which men count for nothing. I read a book recently about the invasion of Estonia by the Red Army. Another book has been written about the invasion of Lithuania. Both tell the same story of suppression. Any person in Australia who says one word’ in favour of the Red Army should be dealt with summarily. If no law has been passed which will enable the Government to deal with such a person, the Government should rectify the position. If there is no Commonwealth court in which such a person can be tried, such a court should be constituted. The final test of the sincerity of Government members when they talk about not suppressing the Communist party will be seen within the next ten or fifteen minutes when no doubt it will suppress this debate.\n\nMr HAYLEN:\n\nParkes\n\n.- In the first place I unhesitatingly say that I have nothing but condemnation for the remarks made by Sharkey. He was in this country during the period that the Russians were regarded as our allies and if there is any sincerity in the man it is a wonder that he did not take the opportunity on that occasion to join the forces against aggression. However, f refuse to be stampeded by inspired remarks of the kind that are always featured in the popular press so that the majority of people who read them or hear of them shall become alarmed. I wonder whether the statement attributed to Sharkey has been checked and investigated. I do not say that Sharkey did not make the statement to which attention has been drawn. I merely say that the manner of its presentation is familiar. There are two ways of dealing with the “ Sharkeys “ in the community. The Government view is that we cannot combat communism by suppressing the Communist party and that Communists can be dealt with by the ordinary processes of the law when they break the law. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) has already said that an investigation of these statements is being made with a view to legal action being taken. A prosecution was launched in respect of certain statements made by Mr. Burns, in Queensland. There is no great difference of opinion among the members of this House in regard to communism but there is a vast difference of opinion about how the menace of communism should be tackled. There is the outright suppression as newly advocated by honorable members opposite and acceptance of the Commu- nist party under democratic control as supported by honorable members on this side of the House. It was only to be expected that Sharkey’s statement would be seized upon by the honorable member for Reid (Mr. Lang). The honorable member is looking for cues at the moment because of a by-election in which a butcher is running in his interests. We shall probably be listening to the butcher to-night. So far we have heard from the block. This motion is a pre-arranged business and there is very little honesty behind the whole thing. The Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell) spoke of the activities of Communists throughout the world and of the democratic approach made to communism by the Governments of Great Britain and the United States of America. The honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender), who has been interjecting fiercely during this debate, recently took part as the main speaker in a welcome extended to Mr. Anthony Eden. In Sydney he was referred to as “ The voice that breathed o’er Eden “. Reporting Mr. Anthony Eden’s views on the threat of communism the Sydney Sun of the 26th February said -\n\nWhen lie arrived in Melbourne on Thursday, Mr. Anthony Eden said at his press conference that communism was no longer on the upgrade. Its decline, coupled with co-operation between Britain, America and the Western European democracies made war with Russia less likely than a year ago.\n\nThe point I emphasize is that Mr. Anthony Eden takes the view held by the Australian Government and democracies of the United States and Western Europe that the best way to deal with communism is to watch it and not drive it underground. We can gain nothing by driving Communists underground where they will work through subterranean channels.\n\nMr Gullett:\n\n– Mr. Anthony Eden did not say that.\n\nMr HAYLEN:\n\n– That was the view very strongly held by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) for many years Although the right honorable gentleman recently decided to advocate the banning of the Communist party, I do not for one moment think that he believes in such a policy. The honorable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett), who always talks a little too much, has just interjected. Let us see what he had to say about the Communists. The Melbourne Argus of the 25th August, 1948, contains a report of a meeting of the Victorian Liberal Party Council. He dealt with the Communists in a very expansive way - he was not knocking them for “ a row of sixes “ but was being very plain and liberal. The Argus report reads -\n\nMr. Gullett, M.P., told the council that it was useless and mischievous to attack waterside workers, miners, or unionists, because communism would flourish as long as people were crowded together and educated in slums, ill-fed, and without land or pastimes.\n\nMr Gullett:\n\n– That does not mean that I would not deal with the Communists.\n\nMr HAYLEN:\n\n– The honorable member for Reid made a great play about the menace of communism in short, sharp, nervous sentences which are manufactured for him by a script-writer in Sydney and sent to Canberra by air mail. I have heard of adding machines, but the honorable member is the only talking machine I have heard of in this House. If the record does not arrive we do not hear a speech from him. The honorable member’s book, Communism in Australia, is printed in Sydney at the office of the Land newspaper. That office is a 48-hour shop which employs non-union labour; but that, of course, does not matter to the honorable member for Reid. Although the honorable member has to-day dilated on the menace of the Communists, whose breath is supposedly so hot on our necks, and has told us how extremely dangerous Sharkey is to Australia, I remind the honorable gentleman that in his book dealing with the Communists he stated -\n\nThey contested 17 scats in the Commonwealth. They lost their deposits in 15. Out nf a total Commonwealth roll of 4,480,050, the Communists polled an aggregate of 62,420. Many of these would be protest votes, rather than Communist votes. Yet, despite this sorry showing . . . the Communist leader L. L. Sharkey polled 3,301 votes in Dalley, against 37,015 polled by Speaker Rosevear.\n\nI suggest to the House, therefore, that the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) has already dealt adequately with the Communist leader, Mr. Sharkey. The book continues -\n\nGeneral Secretary J. B. Miles, could only muster 2,324 in North Sydney against W. M. Hughes, and lost his deposit.\n\nApparently the old warhorse was able to take care of communism in. North Sydney. By arousing the fear of the masses that the Communists were likely, the very next morning, to sweep away everything, the old octogenarian was able to worst his opponent by a huge majority. The honorable member’s book continues -\n\nAdam Ogston polled less than 10 per cent, of the votes registered for Dan Mulcahy in Lang. J. K. Hughes of the then State Labour party lost his deposit in Reid, as did Evans in Robertson. Even though the Communists attempted to win over service votes by endorsing members of the armed forces, they failed to -make any impression on the electorates.\n\nThose facts, which, I remind the House, are stressed by the honorable member, indicate that he does not believe communism to be a very great menace in this country. If I might be permitted to proceed from the ridiculous to the sublime, I shall quote the views of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Attlee, as reported in the Melbourne Herald of the 25th February. The report states -\n\nThe Prime Minister, Mr. Attlee, rejected a. suggestion in the House of Commons to-day tha-t he should introduce anti-Communist legislation on lines of that in India and France. He said lie did not think such a move either necessary or desirable.\n\nOf course, the sincerity of the honorable member comes into question in this chamber from time to time. Whilst there is no real divergence of opinion amongst the people as to the usefulness or otherwise of the communists, the slogan “ ban the Communists “ is undoubtedly a useful political tactic to employ, particularly when there are no other grounds on which to attack the .present Government. In advocating the immediate suppression of the Communists, the honorable member is obviously not concerned with the operation of the ordinary democratic processes of law. In effect, he says : “ Do not trouble to inquire why an individual is agitating ; put him in jail “. Obviously, the dictatorial and antidemocratic character of that proposal would not commend it to any truly Australian administration. Of course, the real point is that nobody is seriously worried about Mr. Sharkey and the other so-called Communist leaders. After all, they are not Australians. Although we hear plenty of talk about recalcitrant mineworkers, and much harsh criticism of industrial workers generally, I remind honorable members that whether we like it or not we must admit that the entire Australian community is riding on the back of the workers, who are the only real producers of wealth in the community. Without them the community could not exist and we should not be required here. That is selfevident and is not mere Marxian twaddle. To return to Mr. Sharkey, I point out that he is a European, who was born in England, Scotland, Ireland, or some other European country. He is certainly not an Australian. Millions of Australians have demonstrated–\n\nMr Harrison:\n\n– Under the Nationality and Citizenship Act, which was recently passed by this House, he has become an Australian citizen.\n\nMr HAYLEN:\n\n– I said that Mr. Sharkey was born outside Australia. However, I am concerned with the serious doubt which honorable members must feel of the sincerity of the honorable member for Reid in this matter. He is playing a double game in this House, and likes to raise matters such as the subject of the present motion. He thinks : “ I can get them on that question “. Of course he can. What reply could any administration make to the demands that have been made by the honorable member and his friends other than that it was considering the legal aspects of Mr. Sharkey’s alleged utterance in order to ascertain whether a prosecution should be launched? The honorable member seeks to convey the impression that the Communists can be swept aside by a mere process of banning. The real danger lies in driving them underground. I remind honorable members that instead of banning the Communists in Japan, the Ear Eastern Commission and the democratic government of the United States of America permitted Communist candidates to stand at the Japanese elections.\n\nMr Gullett:\n\n– And the number of Communists in Japan is increasing every day in consequence.\n\nMr HAYLEN:\n\n– There are methods of dealing with them, of course. However, I was pointing out that in a d emocracy- -\n\nMr Gullett:\n\n– The honorable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) does not know what he is pointing out.\n\nMr HAYLEN:\n\n– If the honorable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett) were a democrat - and I have always doubted that he is - he would realize that certain democratic rights, including that of free expression, cannot be submerged altogether. Even if the numbers and influence of Communists in this country had increased to such a degree as to constitute something in the nature of a menace, which is not the case, it is ridiculous to pretend that they cannot be properly dealt with by democratic means.\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER:\n\n– Order! The honorable member’s time has expired.\n\nMotion (by Mr. Scully) put -\n\nThat the question be now put -\n\nThe House divided. (Mr. Deputy Speaker-Mr. J.J. Clark.)\n\nAYES: 33\n\nNOES: 0\n\nMajority 9\n\nAYES\n\nNOES\n\nQuestion so resolved in the affirmative.\n\nQuestion put -\n\nThat the House donow adjourn.\n\nThe House divided. (Mr, Deputy Speaker - Mr. J. J. Clark.)\n\nAYES: 24\n\nNOES: 33\n\nMajority . . . . 9\n\nAYES\n\nNOES\n\nQuestion so resolved in the negative.\n\npage 1057\n\nSCIENCE AND INDUSTRY RESEARCH BILL 1949\n\nMotion (by Mr. Desman) agreed to -\n\nThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act relating to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.\n\npage 1057\n\nSHIPPING BILL 1949\n\nSecond Reading\n\nDebate resumed from the 4th March (vide page 1037), on motion by Mr. Dedman -\n\nThat the hill be now read a second time.\n\nMr WILLIAMS:\n\nRobertson\n\n.- It gives me great pleasure to support this bill, and I am sure that all the people in this country who remember the sale of. the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers by the Bruce-Page Government will be jubilant when it becomes law. The objects of the bill are to establish an adequate and efficient mercantile marine in Australian waters, maintain and foster the shipbuilding industry in. Australia, and set up a Commonwealth shipping line. The aim of the Government is to repair the damage that was done to this nation when the Bruce-Page Government disposed of that great national undertaking, the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers, because the sale of those ships has impeded the growth of our country. The bill before the House provides machinery whereby the three objectives to which I have referred will be achieved. There shall be established the Australian Shipping Board, consisting of five members, to which will be transferred all of the assets of the present shipping board that was established in 1941 under the National Security Regulations, and which has performed splendid work not only during the war period but also since the cessation of hostilities. There are in existence a considerable number of ships belonging to the Commonwealth. These will be transferred to the control of the new board, which will be obliged to carry out the functions specified in this legislation, and to bring to life again the great shipping line that the people of this country once knew. Although the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), when addressing the House on this subject in his usual brilliant style, regaled honorable members with that eloquence, charm of manner and let them feel that animal magnetism for which he is said to be noted, he did not advance one clear, definite argument against this measure. I should have thought that all of those who were acquainted with Australia’s part in World War II. would readily have appreciated the great necessity that exists for the Commonwealth to run its own line of steamers, to foster the shipbuilding industry in this country, and to see that henceforth Australia shall have a stalwart, healthy mercantile marine. Most honorable members will recollect the difficulties that were experienced by Australia during the war years when trying to find sufficient ships to carry on the civilian trade and to assist our fighting forces. The people of this country, by virtue of its long coast line, have a great interest in shipping matters. Our people have an inherent love of the sea, and there is no logical reason why we should not become a great mercantile nation. As honorable members know, Great Britain became great because it built ships and sent them to all of the seas of the world. British ships are found in every harbour of the world. In this Government are men of vision, who look forward to the day when Australia, also, will be one of the great nations of the world, when its ships will sail the seven seas and be found in all of the harbours of the world. We are making tremendous progress, and the Government should be congratulated on the efficiency and vision that it has displayed by the introduction of this measure.\n\nMr Archie Cameron:\n\n– Oh, yes !\n\nMr WILLIAMS:\n\n– I am glad that my remarks are endorsed by the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), the gentleman who reminds me of the scriptural references to the *’ voice of the turtle “. The Government must ensure that the shipbuilding industry of Australia shall never again be allowed to decay and fall away as it did following the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. When the full impact of the recent war was felt it was found that the ships sailing on the Australian coast were barely able to meet the civilian requirements. When it became necessary for us to find additional ships to assist the fighting forces we were in great difficulties. It was then that the shipbuilding industry in this country was resuscitated. To-day there are in existence important shipbuilding yards at Maryborough, Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, Whyalla and other places in this country. When the shipbuilding yards are working at full capacity, countless other industries benefit, because shipbuilding is a component of the heavy industries.\n\nAlthough the establishment of efficient shipbuilding yards in this country is necessary in peace-time, I point out that the Government is actuated primarily by considerations of defence, and in pursuance of its policy of full employment. Let us consider the history of the shipping industry in Australia, and why honorable members opposite are resisting this measure. On Friday last the honorable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale) addressed the House on this subject-\n\nMr McBride:\n\n– The honorable member made a good speech.\n\nMr WILLIAMS:\n\n– People have different opinions about what is good or bad. I should not be disposed to agree with the honorable member who has just interjected that it was a good speech. I also heard the speech delivered by the honorable member for Indi (Mr. McEwen) on this measure. If the Opposition did not have this prejudice against State enterprise I am sure that there would be no antagonism to this measure. The whole theory, policy, and theme of the Opposition is to “let private enterprise do the job “.\n\nMr Bowden:\n\n– What about Mr. Sharkey’s statement?\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER:\n\n– There is no reference to Mr. Sharkey in the bill before the House.\n\nMr WILLIAMS:\n\n– -It would be impossible for private enterprise to foster the shipbuilding industry, establish a line of ships, and strengthen the mercantile marine as is provided for in this bill. Of course, private enterprise is all right in its way. I am not attacking it. Like State enterprise, private enterprise is good or bad according to the support that it gets, and its management: Although private enterprise has become a fetish with the Opposition, my opinion is that. State enterprise has come to stay. It is to be found in many avenues affecting the daily lives of the people of this country, and it is good or bad according to the backing of the Government and the management of the particular undertaking.\n\nMr Harrison:\n\n– It is mostly bad.\n\nMr WILLIAMS:\n\n– State enterprise is permeating the whole of the community.\n\nThat this will be another State enterprise is the only reason for the antagonism of the Opposition. I remind honorable members that State enterprise has received the support, not only of Labour governments, but also of Liberal governments in this country. I refer to the great electricity undertaking in Victoria, and other State enterprises in South Australia. The argument advanced by the honorable member for Parramatta in his vicious speech was that all State enterprise must necessarily fail, and therefore we should not pass this legislation. That argument is ridiculous. We expect the Opposition to be able to advance something better than that. The right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) established the Australian Commonwealth Line nf Steamers. When he was in London in 1916, he purchased fifteen cargo vessels which formed the nucleus of the line. Those vessels helped to combat the high freights that were being charged by the shipping combine. They were used to transport Australia’s exports of primary products at reasonable rates. Freights in 1 916 were shockingly high. Vessels which were purchased for £7,000 before World War I. were disposed of at prices exceeding £40,000. In one instance the freight on a cargo valued at £18,000 amounted to £50,000, or more than 260 per cent, of the value of the cargo itself. That was typical of the extortionate charges imposed by the shipping combine at that time, and such conditions influenced the right honorable member for NorthSydney to establish the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers-\n\nMr Archie Cameron:\n\n– The high rates charged at that time were due mainly to war risks.\n\nMr WILLIAMS:\n\n– I should say that the shipping combine simply took advantage of the war at that time to increase the freight rates. The right honorable member for North Sydney, being a practical man, had every justification for establishing the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The original fleet made steady progress until 1923, when the Bruce-Page Government, which assumed office in that year, prepared a financial statement of the operations of the line. The balance-sheet submitted on that occasion showed a loss on the operation’ of the line, and it caused considerable controversy. The then Prime Minister, Mr. Bruce, took the opportunity thus presented to him to turn the line over to a shipping board. But he made the board give to the Government debentures over the vessels, those debentures amounting to approximately £5,000,000. As the result of that arrangement, the board was extremely handicapped by high overhead costs. From that date the rot set in. The board commenced to sell the vessels right and left. Some one has compared that sale to a bargain basement sale. The vessels were sold to interests throughout the world until, shortly afterwards, only the “ Bay “ liners and a few other ships remained of the original fleet. As the board found it difficult to meet the interest due on the debentures it had given to the Government, it recommended that, in view of the high overhead costs thereby involved, the line he sold. The matter was referred to the Public Accounts Committee, but that committee recommended that in the interests of Australia the line should be retained. However, that recommendation did not suit the then Prime Minister, who invited the committee to hear further evidence on the subject. That evidence was heard in camera, and the people of this country have never been able to ascertain what the nature of it was. Subsequently, the committee, in a majority report, recommended that the line be sold. The vessels were sold to the White Star Line, which later was unable to meet its liabilities and went into liquidation when it still owed the Australian Government approximately £400,000 in respect of those vessels it had purchased. The Government has never been paid that sum. Honorable members opposite have contended that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers failed because of mismanagement. That point was stressed by the eminent would-be King’s counsel, the honorable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale). I should like him to explain, whether the White Star Line also failed because of mismanagement. It is clear that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers did not fail because qf mismanagement. In 1927, when the depression was approaching, the line was being sabotaged not only by the government of the day but also by the press of this country. Lord Inchcape” had formed what was known as the Shipping Conference and the private shipping companies concentrated all their efforts upon putting the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers out of business. What happened subsequently? In this House in 1927, the leader of the Labour Opposition submitted a motion of want of confidence in the Bruce-Page Government because of its announced intention to dispose of the line. On that occasion the right honorable member for North Sydney, who had been succeeded by Mr. Bruce as leader of the Nationalists, as Labour’s opponents then called themselves, strongly protested against the proposal to sell the line. He said -\n\nThe line is my progeny, and whether it he unique or a monstrosity, I, like most parents, am Hill attached to the poor thing.\n\nHe disclosed to the House very significant information which the government of the day had failed to make public during the course of that debate. The Prime Minister had been asked whether he had any information to offer about communications that had passed between the Shipping Conference and the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board. When the Prime Minister prevaricated and offered no reply to that question, the right honorable member for North Sydney read to the House certain cablegrams which shocked the country at that time. He said -\n\nI quote from a cablegram dated London, the 7th December, 1925, which reads: - “It is proposed to increase outward freight rates (i.e., from the United Kingdom to Australia), subject to merchants’ consent as per agreement on the following basis: - £5 measurement, to £5 10s., £3 15s. to £4. Lower measurement rates by half-a-crown, objectionable cargoes £1, leaving iron and steel rates, paper and most weight rates untouched.”\n\nThat was a cablegram which was sent by the Shipping Conference to the Shipping Board. The board replied as follows: -\n\nOutward freight rates. Board of Directors has decided at meeting to-<lay cannot agree to any increase rates, considering such course fatal to interests of Line as being opposed to purpose for which it exists.\n\nThe freights were not increased. Later, the private shipowners came back again and the Australian Commonwealth Ship- ping Board despatched the following cablegram to the Shipping Conference : -\n\nResult of recent strike clearly indicates enormous excess tonnage on Australian berth, as notwithstanding large numbers ships idle, no serious congestion experienced. We are agreeable to await result of conference with merchants, but cannot agree to pledge ourselves support increase.\n\nSome time later, the following cable was received : -\n\nIn view of coal position, Conference propose immediately advance outward freights by approximately 15 per cent. Foreigners agree. It is proposed to exclude items such as rough weights.\n\nThe board’s reply was as follows : -\n\nConsider it would be equally impolitic from both British owners and our point of view. To refrain from advancing rates may encourage reduction berth tonnage, which is desirable. In any case oil-burning tonnage could not justify.\n\nAt that time, as the right honorable member said, the increase was not made. The Shipping Conference, headed by Lord Inchcape, pressed the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board to increase freights, but it steadfastly refused. The next move was to bring great pressure to bear on the government of the day to sell the ships on the ground that the line was losing £500,000 a year. As the right honorable member pointed out, that was a small loss compared to the tremendous saving to the primary producers in freight charges on their exports. In .1921, the then Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) read the following cable in the House : -\n\nProspects of shipping all over the world for several- years to come are extremely bad.\n\nThe cable went on to say that the Shipping Conference wanted to buy out the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, or, alternatively, to sell its own ships to the Australian Government. Thus, from 1921 onwards, the men directing the Shipping Conference, or the shipping combine as we know it, was trying to put the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers out of business. It was taking the bread out of their mouths, something which they could not tolerate. Being active, successful and intelligent business men, it was part of their technique to do away with opposition, and one cannot blame them. Eventually, they succeeded. Having a willing government in Australia acting as their tool, they succeeded in getting rid of our ships. All this talk from the Opposition about the failure of State enterprises is without justification. The Leader of the Opposition in another place said that 70 per cent, of State enterprises had failed. On Friday morning last, Opposition members drew attention to the alleged failure of the New South Wales State brick works, thus obviously showing that they had not studied the subject. It is very important that the people of Australia should be reminded that the right honorable member for North Sydney, a former Prime Minister, and Mr. W. A. Holman, a former Premier of New South Wales, very strongly opposed the disposal of State enterprises, the right honorable member for North Sydney protesting against the disposal of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and Mr. Holman objecting to the disposal of the New South Wales State brick works, the State metal quarries and the Monier pipe works. As the right honorable member for North Sydney spoke, a cry of pain must have echoed round Australia when it was known that the Government intended to dispose of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Mr. Holman and Mr. Arthur Griffith protested when they heard that the Stevens Government in New South Wales proposed to sell the State metal quarries, which had been established in 1910, and which, according to the reports of the Auditor-General, had carried on for many years making large profits. This is what they said -\n\nThere i3 no question of political principle involved in this question. One of the undersigned is an active supporter of the present Government, the other an opponent. We agree, however, in feeling that the figures and reasons set forth by the Premier are imperfect and dangerously misleading, and as members of the Government responsible for the establishment of these works which have had the approval and support of other Governments of every shade of political opinion during a period amounting to 22 years, we ask that full public inquiry be made as to the result obtained by the works before any final step be taken for their abandonment or disposal. Tn conclusion, we would point out that the public has a right to expect that any Government elected by it, no matter of what political colour, will protect its properties and not permit them to be wrecked in the interests of private moneymaking concerns.\n\nA royal commission was appointed tu inquire into the matter, and the sale was deferred until after the death of Mr. Holman in 1935. Members of the Opposition have based most of their objections to this bill on the alleged failure of State enterprises in Australia, anc! I am endeavouring to show that those premises are false. I propose now to refer to what took place before the royal commission. The royal commissioner said -\n\nTime and time again during the course of the hearing I pointed out that my enquiry had nothing to do with the wisdom or otherwise of the policy adopted and pursued. The papers make it abundantly clear - and Mr. Spooner emphasized this in his evidence - that ae a matter of policy the Government were determined to “get out of business” and not to continue to compete with private enterprise.\n\nMr. Spooner was the Minister in charge of those matters. As the royal commissioner said, the Government was determined to get out of business, and that is why those valuable State shipyards, brickworks, pipeworks and metal quarries were disposed of. Those enterprises were sold after the death of the former Premier of New South Wales, Mr. W. A. Holman. Had Mr. Holman survived, it is not difficult to imagine what his feelings would have been to know that the interests that bought those valuable undertakings were the bis? combines themselves. At the time that the sales occurred, the newspaper Truth said -\n\nOn the face of things (as disclosed in the latest departmental reports) certain wealthy corporations are being made a present of £344,1 !)0, but the actual amount would probably be nearer half a million sterling - possibl"
