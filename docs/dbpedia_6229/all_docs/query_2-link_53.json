        "text": "It is with deep sadness that we inform you that our Chairman of the Board, Robert G. Scully, passed away on Monday, February 20, 2017 at the age of 91. Son of our founder, Francis P. Scully, he joined Scully Signal Company as a regional salesperson and became the President in 1964. Following in his father’s footsteps, he led the charge to revolutionize the petroleum industry through mechanical and electronic systems designed to improve the safety and efficiency of fluid product transfer, loading and storage.\n\nThrough his vision and dedication, Scully became a worldwide brand known for quality, reliability and safety. Dozens of patents established Scully as a pioneer in fuel oil delivery, overfill prevention, static ground proving and vehicle identification systems.\n\nHe officially retired as president of Scully Signal Company in 2016 when Eric Kirleis joined the company as CEO. His daughter, Katrina Ohl re-joined the company 4 years ago as Executive V.P. Her brother Ian, two sisters, Andrea and Joia, as well as Frank, his nephew are also involved with the company and committed to continuing his legacy. He is also survived by his wife Rosmarie, his sister, sister-in-law, eight grandchildren and many nieces and nephews.\n\nBob Scully loved to travel, was an avid reader and history buff, enjoyed skiing, hiking, tennis and was a gracious host to friends, customers and colleagues from all over the globe.\n\nHe was committed to you, our customers, and grateful to his employees for making the company’s success possible.\n\nWith Sincere Regards,\n\nThe Scully Family"
