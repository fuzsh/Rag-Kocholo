        "text": "Young\n\nWe’re here to try to think about what people in the future after George Bush and his administration has long passed into history—the important things about this Presidency that they should understand and would not be able to learn by looking only at press accounts. What you’re leafing through there, Tom—\n\nScully\n\nYou’ve done a pretty good job with the press accounts.\n\nYoung\n\nWell, it’s a sifting, just some of the things the public was told in print. It’s not necessarily what we believe. Some of them are meant to be provocative of questions and provocative of some comments. All the people in the room have shared the transcript of your forum talk here. David and I, and I think Tarek, you were all at that talk.\n\nMasoud\n\nI wasn’t here yet.\n\nYoung\n\nYou weren’t on board yet. I think that was a very good star; we try to do our homework.\n\nScully\n\nI’d be afraid to read this rambling.\n\nYoung\n\nYou have a copy somewhere.\n\nScully\n\nI know I do. You sent me a tape. I’ve just been busy and haven’t found it.\n\nYoung\n\nTom expressed a desire just to get started right off with some questions, and the logical place to start is how you got into the administration, what it was like to get started in it, how things worked, what it was you were really doing. We know from your remarks at the forum that your first connection was presumably through Marvin Bush here, and then we begin to pick up things in your bio. You were involved in the campaign. You were certainly involved as the communications person, and then the next thing we hear, you’re on the transition team, then you’re in the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] with [Richard] Darman, and we go on from there. If we could find out a little bit more about your career. What took you into policy? Subsequently, whatever got you into health care policy?\n\nScully\n\nWell, that’s a difficult one. Cut me off after ten minutes.\n\nYoung\n\nOK.\n\nScully\n\nI was at UVA [University of Virginia] and Marvin Bush was a good friend of mine. I remember at 2: 00 in the morning walking through the street and Marvin was telling me his father was going to run for President, and I said, “Sure, right. My father’s going to run, too.” I barely knew who George Bush was. I knew he’d been CIA [Central Intelligence Administration] Director. Anyway, I went to Washington.\n\nI was always interested in politics. I had worked in Philadelphia. I grew up in politics a little bit. In my fourth year at Virginia, I was hired to work for Senator John Heinz. I was fired before I started because his legislative director, who hired me, was fired. It turns out that’s a common thing with Heinz, who has now passed away. So I got up there and didn’t have a job. I was working in a restaurant in Old Town and I didn’t have anything better to do in the day, so I wandered in and volunteered in the Bush campaign because Marvin was a friend of mine. I got to know a lot of the people in the campaign then. That was the summer of ’79.\n\nAfter a while, I was too broke to continue so I got a job at the Federal Election Commission and I worked there for a about a year, which prevented me from working on the ’80 campaign, unfortunately. So I didn’t do any more work for Bush. Right after the ’80 election I went to work for Senator [Slade] Gorton from Washington State. I worked for him for five years and he put me through night law school. Night law school prevented me from working on the ’84 campaign, but I’d always kept up with the Bush people. I’d been friends with many of the people who worked on the Vice President’s staff.\n\nI guess starting ’86 I was a lawyer at Akin, Gump, a law firm in Washington, and I started doing a little campaign finance work on the side, volunteering for the campaign. I expressed an interest in getting involved, and when it got around to the beginning of ’88, a lot of my friends started working on the campaign. I basically volunteered to take a leave of absence from Akin, Gump, first about half time in the spring of ’88, then full time probably from March of ’88 through the end of the year, with the intention of coming back. I never really went back. I wasn’t doing policy work. I was a press person, primarily. I was the communications director for the convention and I worked on the campaign through that. They were kind of tied together.\n\nAfter the convention ended, I put together the TV satellite uplink program for the campaign, which at that point was kind of new. Not many people had done that, so I think back then President Bush thought I was a TV guy. I don’t think he even knew I worked for him. Every time he’d see me I was there with a cameraman and telephones and he probably barely knew who I was. But after we won—completely accidentally—David Demarest, to whom I think you’ll probably talk—Dave was my boss. He was the communications director in the campaign. He said, “We’d like you to come over and work on the transition team in communications and probably work in the White House.” I said, “I’m really a lawyer and a lobbyist. This has been fun, but this was a hobby and I really don’t feel like doing that. I’m going to go back to Akin, Gump and be a lawyer.”\n\nMaybe two days after that, Janet Mullins, who was the head of the transition team for the legislative and political side, somehow had been talking to David, and she needed a deputy. So before I actually left the transition to go back to the law firm, she came and said, “Would you be my deputy on the transition team?” So she and I and were the legislative team on the transition team.\n\nI guess we split the Cabinet in half, and I had John Tower and [James, III] Baker and Darman and [Nicholas] Brady and [Louis] Sullivan. So I had half of the Cabinet appointees that I had to at least get started before the inauguration on their confirmation processes, which was interesting in itself, because I had Sam Skinner. I spent a lot of time with Skinner for probably two months. Most of these guys had some kind of political team of people they were affiliated with, but the guy that I was randomly assigned who had virtually nobody helping him out was Darman. Darman was kind of a lone wolf and didn’t really have a lot of political allies or young staffers running around. I basically set up all Darman’s appointments, took him around to most of the Senate appointments to get him confirmed, and got him started.\n\nI did the same thing with Skinner and I did a fair amount with Tower and few others. But the guys that I became closest to during that process were Skinner and Darman. Brady, for a variety of reasons, was closer to John. Brady offered me a job to run his Congressional affairs. Darman offered me a job to run his Congressional affairs, and Skinner offered me a job to be the Assistant Secretary, so I could have been Assistant Secretary of Treasury or Transportation or OMB, and Darman had a reputation of being—since this is all background—a real pain in the ass that nobody could get along with, and he was when I worked with him. But everybody else also said, “He’s brilliant and you’ll be in the middle of everything—the OMB is part of the White House and you’ll be more in the mix.” I checked around and Darman was not a particularly well-liked guy, but he was clearly effective and he was clearly going to be very engaged in everything, so I decided to go work for Darman.\n\nI worked for Darman from the beginning. It was totally by choice, but I just thought that was the best place to be. I did the legislative affairs job for probably, I don’t know—maybe eight, nine, or ten months, and there was a person who was a [Ronald] Reagan holdover who was in the job as the associate—There were only four associate directors; three of them were for policy. I did the lobbying legislative affairs, but it became clear pretty quickly that the better of the associate directors doing the policy did their own lobby. But Bob Grady was a good friend of mine, so the lobbying job was fun. But you really want to have your own little package of substantive things to do. You’re better off with one of the three policy jobs. One of the Reagan holdovers—I won’t get into who it was, who I happened to like a lot—was not particularly effective, and Darman kind of gently eased her on after a while. When that happened, I went in to him and said I had had a couple of job offers in the White House.\n\nI don’t know who else you’ll talk to, but Roger Porter had a deputy named Bill Roper. Bill left after about a year. Roger called me up and asked me—I’m getting ahead of myself. So Roger called and said, “Would you come over and be the Deputy to the Domestic Policy Advisor?” And I said, “Well, let me think about it.” I made the mistake of going to Darman and saying, “What if I went to be Roger’s deputy?” They were very intensely competitive. They used to teach together at Harvard and the bottom line is Darman essentially tried to stomp on Roger on a regular basis, so Darman said, “You can go be Roger’s deputy if you want but I’ll kill you.” And basically it worked. He said, “You’re not going to do that. You’ll never—I’ll cut you off at the knees. You’ll never get anything done. I don’t need anybody strengthening Roger and making him more effective.”\n\nSo I said, “Fine, I want to do more policy work.” He said, “All right, we’ll do more policy work. The other person is leaving. If you want to stay here you can become the associate director and have all the Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, Education, and VA [Veterans Affairs]. You want to go do that, fine.” And the reality was—since this is off the record—within the White House, Roger Porter is a wonderful guy, was a very good academic, was totally impotent, and had no power, and Darman had a ton. So it was abundantly apparent that even though I liked Roger, and my view of going to Darman was naïve, I thought Darman would go for the position that, Roger’s not particularly effective. He’s great guy, he’s an academic, but he doesn’t understand politics, very well, I’ll go be his deputy and we’ll all be much more effective.\n\nDarman was a very turf conscious guy. Darman’s attitude was, “The last thing I need is to have the now totally impotent Domestic Policy Advisor become more effective. If you go do that, I’ll shoot you.” So Darman said, “Stay here. I’ll give you more policy work to do and you can become the associate director for that.” So that’s what I did. And one of the things of getting in the Bush administration, one of the problems—and I liked Darman, he’s a brilliant guy, we can talk about that—is that Darman was a power monster and cut off a lot of the people. Instead of looking at how you can make the administration more effective, he spent an awful lot of time trying to neutralize and kill, neuter, other people so that he could run everything, and in fact, he did run everything.\n\nFor the first three years, Darman and [John] Sununu ran everything. The domestic policy shop in the White House was completely useless. They had zero impact on anything, which is unfortunate because Roger is a terrific guy, very smart guy, but he’s an academic. And Darman is a political guy with very sharp elbows, very tough. Darman didn’t care much about education, so he kind of said, “Here Roger, you go do education and I’ll do everything else.” That’s roughly how it worked.\n\nYoung\n\nDarman was almost an old-hand sort of lobbyist.\n\nScully\n\nYes, Darman was Baker’s deputy in the Reagan White House.\n\nYoung\n\nRoger Porter hadn’t had all that kind of —\n\nScully\n\nRoger worked for [Gerald] Ford. I liked Roger a lot; if you asked who you wanted to go out to dinner with, Roger Porter is a lot nicer guy than Dick Darman, but he’s nowhere near as smart or as crafty or as aggressive. You could say the same thing about Sam Skinner and John Sununu. Sununu and Darman were very tight, and I really worked for both of them. Roger and Sam Skinner were similar; they’re both really nice guys who would sit around and have six-hour meetings about policy that could have been done in 20 minutes. They just weren’t very good at just cutting to the chase and getting things done.\n\nThat’s how I got involved with Darman and that’s how I got involved getting from the lobbying side to the policy side. I’d been a telecommunications lawyer when I was at Akin, Gump and knew nothing about health care. When I went over to work for Darman in health care I had a staff of about a hundred and they were smart and I just learned it.\n\nYoung\n\nAnd then to complete the story, you also mentioned that the last year and a half you were working personally with Bush on the health care package. Did I understand that correctly?\n\nScully\n\nYes. I was the Associate Director of OMB for three years and then last six, eight, months—I can’t remember exactly—it might’ve been March of ’92, but essentially you couldn’t work on the campaign if you were at OMB because you were “Hatched” out under the Hatch Act. And also they wanted me more involved in the campaign, so I had two jobs. I became the councilor to the Director of OMB and then also was the Deputy Domestic Policy Advisor, so I was—the fact is, it didn’t make any difference. I did the same job. I had to take a pay cut, but the same job. But we started writing a health care plan. Darman was very interested in health care and really knew a lot about health care, so Darman had me start working on a health care plan probably in the summer, right after the budget deal in ’90.\n\nIn November of ’90, soon as we finished the budget deal, he said, “The next big issue is going to be health care for me. You’ve got to write a health care plan.” So I spent a lot of time working with my staff coming up with health care plans for probably a year, and I’d say we probably had the basics of what eventually became the Bush plan, which was released—I’ve got a copy here I’m sure—on February 6th of ’92. It was probably pretty much done by the summer of ’91, maybe earlier than that. Probably by the spring of ’91 because the budget deal ended in November of ’90, I guess, or October of ’90, I would think, and I’d say we pretty much had the Bush health thing done by May completely done, drafted and everything else, and Sununu’s attitude—Sununu and Darman are very close. I mean, one of them Chief of Staff, and one of them head of OMB, but they were totally intertwined, spent all their time together. I worked for both of them and they were completely dominant in every aspect of policy.\n\nYoung\n\nIn policy development as well as on the congressional side?\n\nScully\n\nYes. Darman did a little more time on the Hill, but Darman and Sununu were inseparable.\n\nYoung\n\nTell us how that came about.\n\nScully\n\nThey’re very much like. They’re both very smart.\n\nYoung\n\nOften two people who are very much like don’t get along very well if one of them is—\n\nScully\n\nBig egos and tough.\n\nYoung\n\nSo things worked out early on, or did it work out over time?\n\nScully\n\nIt worked out almost from the beginning, and I don’t think they knew each other before because I knew Sununu during the campaign and I didn’t think Darman and Sununu knew each other very well. Darman realized right off the bat Sununu was going to be running the show, and Sununu, I think, realized right off the bat that Darman knew more about the Hill and more about how to get things done and more about policy than anybody around. So Sununu immediately latched onto Darman and also the reality is OMB has lots of policy clout—The White House is a pretty limited staff and not a whole lot of substantive capability. If you look at the domestic policy office, it’s usually four or five people and they’re usually generalists. OMB has 450 and they’re career civil servants, but there’s just a huge, if it’s used right, a giant pot of substance, and the top five or six people at OMB are political appointees or part of the White House staff. Across the street is this building full of policy wonks that if used right are great.\n\nSo Darman had a lot of substance and lot of experience in how to get things done. Sununu looked to Darman as the best staff person in the White House, and Darman looked at Sununu as the power center because Darman from the very beginning of the administration kind of sucked all the air out of the room from everybody else. He was running the show. There was no question about it. Darman didn’t mess around with Sununu. He was the boss and that was it from the first day. They got to be great friends and great allies and were very tight and from the very beginning.\n\nI got to know Sununu really well because I worked on—part of the ’90 budget bill was childcare. That was an issue Sununu was very engaged in and it was my issue. I spent a ton of time on it and he got involved in the negotiations down to every word, and by the end it was a big issue about how you did childcare vouchers and things. But they just took to each other right off the bat, to the point where you go to White House staff meetings and everybody else is scared to death of both of them. The two of them would banter back and forth and beat the hell out of everybody else and intimidate everybody else into submission, which I’m sure you’ll hear from other people if you haven’t heard it yet. If they don’t tell you that, I’d be surprised.\n\nYoung\n\nWell, you’re the first.\n\nScully\n\nI’d say that all the other guys I know on the library council—most of us were around the first day—asked me why was I on the library group. They said, “Well, Scully, you’re on there because you’re the guy we hated least at OMB.” Because they all hated Darman and they hated Sununu too. And they were hateable guys in a lot of ways, but they were also tough and effective, and being lovable doesn’t always make you successful.\n\nYoung\n\nThis is not the only time this happened in the White House. A person of my age can speak with some reminiscences, but in the Bush administration very little of this seemed to come out publicly in terms of the infighting, when you compare it, for example, to the Reagan White House. There was an awful lot of public—\n\nScully\n\nThere was a lot of infighting because Darman and Sununu squashed the—I mean, no one else had the base to even start the infighting. If they didn’t like you, you were gone.\n\nI think that the guys who have been around for a long time—I mean, President Bush is an unbelievably nice guy and everybody loves him. People were intensely loyal to him and they may have been mad or hated Darman or they may have been mad and disliked Sununu, but they just weren’t likely to leak or dump on him. It was a loyalty thing, and most of the people who worked for Bush loved him. Nobody leaked to the press. This was culturally not acceptable.\n\nLet me make another point. We wrote the health care plan. We probably had a meeting with Sununu in the spring of ’91, and his attitude was, “Health care is a Democratic issue. We’re going to get crushed on it. It’s a waste of time. We’re way ahead in the polls. We shouldn’t put it out there. We’re playing into their hands and so we’re not doing a health care plan. Forget it.” That was about at the same time, if you remember, when he announced that we’d already done what we needed to do, we didn’t need to do any more until the next elections, which is pretty dumb. So he sat on the thing through that whole period and we didn’t do anything about it.\n\nIt wasn’t until Harris Wofford won the ’91 election against [Richard] Thornburgh that he came to me the next day and said, “What ever happened to that health care plan?” Well, I’d been sitting on it for months and so we spent two months polishing it up and running through the process. By the time we got it through the White House process and the President, because it had such an impact on everything else, we didn’t get it out until February sixth. By that time it was attacked for being too little too late and because we were already on the downslide. But if you look at, in my humble opinion, now that health care is coming back, it was a radical plan and by today’s standards, if you went out and showed it to a Democrat—and I’ve done this—they think it’s radical. It wasn’t as much as [William J.] Clinton’s but it was a very big radical plan. But Sununu didn’t want to do it and so we sat on it for a long time.\n\nYoung\n\nHow much interest in the beginning did Bush himself take in the Sununu-Darman area of responsibility? Would he sign off on this or not?\n\nScully\n\nI don’t think he knew really what was going on in that area. He’s—\n\nYoung\n\nSo long as it was being managed?\n\nScully\n\nWell, they were doing reasonably well. The administration was pretty successful most of the time, certainly early on. I mean, given the fact that Democrats had overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate against us, and Sununu—Bush is a very loyal guy and Sununu had a lot to do with Bush getting elected. That’s why he was Chief of Staff. He was the very helpful Governor of New Hampshire. They were good friends for a long time and he liked Sununu and he also liked people—Sununu took control of things and got things done, and I’m sure to Bush, Sununu was a delightful, fun guy. I actually like Sununu a lot personally because for whatever reason he liked me and I got along with him, but for the people that he didn’t particularly take to, he could be pretty brutal to watch. So I’m sure to President Bush he was a delightful, great guy.\n\nAnd Darman can be very charming. If you sat in a room with the President and four people from the White House staff, in five minutes it was abundantly clear on 99 percent of the issues that Darman knew twice as much as anybody else in the room, so he was a very valuable resource to have. He was the smartest guy in the White House. He knew the most about how to get things done, and if you ended up briefing him on anything, he knew what the issues were, what the background was, what the history was, where all the people on the Hill were, how to get things done. So I’m sure to President Bush he was a terrific asset.\n\nShreve\n\nDespite their personal attributes, did the President’s decision to concentrate on foreign policy have any bearing on that as well?\n\nScully\n\nI was a domestic policy guy, so my own view, I think one of the bigger flaws in Darman and Sununu—if they read this, they’ll shoot me, they’re both still friends of mine. I’m probably one of the few people you’ll interview who says that. I think that President Bush took very little interest in domestic policy and I don’t think it was because he wasn’t interested. I think it’s because their attitude was, “We’ve got a Democratic Congress. Domestic policy is a loser. You’re good at foreign policy. It’s your area of expertise. You go do it and we’ll take the Democratic battles on the domestic policy.” And the fact is, you can’t really have surrogate Presidents.\n\nI really think that they thought if they went on Meet the Press and took all the hits on domestic policy that they could do domestic policy stuff and leave the President free to do all the foreign policy stuff it would buffer him. I don’t think President Bush thought of that consciously. I just think he got steered that way, and I think it was a problem as a result. Those guys were staff, not the President, and in the end, when it got down to the campaign in ’92, for instance, President Bush had not gotten engaged in the details of the budget deal or the various domestic policy things, so he didn’t know off the top of his head. He had not gone through the battles for three years. He’d largely avoided them. I mean, he was aware of it, but he was not steeped in it to the detail that maybe—he never would be steeped in the detail that Clinton is, but he was not really, really, really familiar with it.\n\nI could give you a lot of examples of that. Some of them I brought in the things in the campaign, and some of them I tried to refer to my talk, but he was doing TV interviews late in ’92 when he would talk about health care and he was starting from scratch. He knew the very basics. He knew education well because he’d spent a lot of time on education—the Charlottesville summit and all of the other stuff—but you know, education on a federal level is a great press issue, but there’s not a whole lot of meat there. It’s a really a state level—\n\nShreve\n\nAs far as control.\n\nScully\n\nYes. There’s a lot of rhetoric to it, but it’s not an issue that the federal government really has that much impact on.\n\nStrong\n\nHow does someone in your position make some of the judgments you were just telling us about? How do you reach your conclusions that working as Roger Porter’s assistant is going to mean you’re not going to have much influence? Do you know that from seeing him in meetings with Darman? Do you know that from reading the policy papers that are circulating? How do you make that judgment? And even the earlier one—before things have even begun—\n\nScully\n\nYou mean, make a judgment about which professor—\n\nStrong\n\nI’m going to go with Skinner. I’m going to go with Darman. It’s a little like that.\n\nScully\n\nYou ask the people around, but how do you know which professor, which of your students are going to be good enough? You just sit around and watch them for a while and you know who’s good and who’s not. Roger’s a wonderful guy and I like Roger, but the difference is I would go to meetings with Roger about education policy or anything Roger was involved in, and Roger would have 17 people from around the department, the government, come into his office and ruminate and it’d be like one of my law school classes, which is fine, but they’d never reach a conclusion. You’d waste a day and at the end you’d wander off and say, “What the hell were we all here for?”\n\nWhereas if you went to a meeting with Darman, he’d say, “We need to do this issue and this is what we’re going to do and you’re going to go see this guy and you’re going to see that guy.” There was no screwing around and it wasn’t any indecision and it just happened. It was just obvious. How you make the judgment that Secretary Brady is a nice guy, but probably wasn’t as a good a Treasury Secretary as Secretary [Robert] Rubin. I don’t think it’s real hard to watch for a while and figure that out.\n\nStrong\n\nWell, you know in Washington, being smartest isn’t always best. People would say about Ronald Reagan, “Well, he wasn’t that smart.” But there were characteristics of his makeup that compensated for that and maybe even more than compensated for it. Actually, if you have a President who’s really smart, sees all sides of the issue, can’t make up their mind, what-have-you—again, I’m really trying to press what is it about these people. OK, Darman’s smart, both from experience and I presume from hard work.\n\nScully\n\nYes. He’s a smart, hardworking guy.\n\nStrong\n\nSo he does command a lot of that factual material and he has a personality that means he’s gonna use that.\n\nScully\n\nI’ll give you an example. Talk to Bill Roper, who’s on the library board. I think Bill would tell you—Bill, I think, was very good. Bill was only there for a year. Bill’s a physician. My first major project at OMB was working with Bill to pass something called RBRVS [Reserve-Based Relative Value Scale], which you probably never heard of, but physician pay reform, which restructured the whole way Medicare was done. Bill was the policy guy and I was the lobbyist, but Bill knew, was smart enough to know—he was Roger’s deputy. He knew Roger wasn’t going to get it done. He knew it wasn’t going to happen unless Darman got engaged.\n\nBill was a real quiet, effective guy, but he figured out early on if he went off and did it as a project with Roger, it wouldn’t happen. If he went to Darman and said, “I need your help getting this done,” Darman said, “Fine, use Scully and you’ll go do it together.” And it became Darman’s project. So Bill was a very low-key guy, but he knew how to get the job done, and I think Bill would tell you privately, maybe not on tape, that the reason he left after a year was because he was frustrated as hell with Roger. He went and became the head of the CDC [Center for Disease Control]. He’s the one who called me up and said, “I’m leaving. I think if you went to be Roger’s deputy and took my place, you could really make Roger more effective because his biggest problem is he doesn’t work the Hill very well.” I was real interested in doing that, but not at the cost of death.\n\nYoung\n\nYes, especially when you had a Democratic Congress. You had to think in terms of results.\n\nScully\n\nBut some of them were good. I mean, [Daniel] Rostenkowski, despite his criminal problems, was a great guy, was very interested in getting things done, and was great at cutting deals. He was what legislators should be all about. He was easy to do stuff with. I was friends with a lot of the staff. He was a really good legislator. So it was just because I think things were less partisan than they are now, and it wasn’t that hard to get things done if you approached it right. You couldn’t wait until two months before an election.\n\nYoung\n\nYou mentioned in your forum talk some of the accomplishments in the first year. Not necessarily things you’d planned, but things that came off OK, and they were all bipartisan. The savings and loan bailout and other things like that. And it strikes me just maybe from the outside, Bush himself, with some exceptions, perhaps on savings and loan, where he had a personal ax to grind against some of the things that were said. His papers show he took real exception to that.\n\nScully\n\nOh, yes. I know he did.\n\nYoung\n\nBut he wasn’t up front on these issues. It’s not as though the President came to him and said this is what—these are issues that he’s going to be very up front up and take the lead on. Isn’t that correct?\n\nScully\n\nYes, he was pretty engaged in that. We can get into the press later on, but President Bush doesn’t like to draw attention to himself and it was a problem because he was very bad at selling himself, promoting himself, and doing the PR [public relations] side. I think he was engaged in a lot of things. He was very engaged in the S&L [savings and loan] stuff.\n\nYoung\n\nYes, but I meant publicly.\n\nShreve\n\nAs if to announce the first 100 days kind of a thing?\n\nYoung\n\nYes. I’m not saying he wasn’t engaged. I’m saying he wasn’t in the public mind associated with these achievements.\n\nScully\n\nWell, I think he’s from an old school of thought, which is unfortunate for him, because it probably helped him lose. He was not big on taking credit for things. His attitude was, If I do a good job, people will appreciate it. We saw that in the S&L, and somebody on the Today Show says, “How did you get it done?” He says, “Well, we did a good job, but it was really Danny Rostenkowski and the bipartisan efforts that got this done.” That’s just the kind of guy he was. His view was there’s plenty of credit to go around. He was not big at holding press conferences and declaring victory, which in hindsight, he probably should have done a lot more of. But it’s part of the power of the Presidency, which he probably didn’t use as effectively as he could have.\n\nIt makes him an incredibly endearing guy. You’ll find guys like Sonny [Gillespie] Montgomery, probably his best friend in Congress, was a Democrat, and Rostenkowski, and they’ll say, “I love working with him.” And if you look at the Bush administration uniquely now from probably the first day up until I’d say almost the fall of ’92, we had very little problem with Democrats. It was almost a frighteningly love fest situation. He had a very good relationship, even though we were in the minority. A lot of them liked him.\n\nIt really wasn’t until George Mitchell, who I like personally—nobody wanted to run against him—went after Bush. Leading Democrats all said they weren’t going to run against him until like the fall of ’92, where Mitchell almost personally took it on and said somebody’s got to beat the hell out of this guy, and went out and started doing it day after day after day. But things weren’t really very partisan until probably September of ’91, in which case I would say very consciously Mitchell—and I respect him for doing it, he was just doing what he should do for his party—kind of started rallying the troops to go find a way to win the election. But at the time, I think George Mitchell had more to do with beating President Bush than anybody.\n\nYoung\n\nOne of the things that will stand out I’m sure, because it has in past Presidents, is how a President—Republican in this case—deals with an opposition Congress and how things get effectively done. Because there are a lot of people who see nothing but the conflict, even when it doesn’t exist, the controversy the press loves to make, so that you get an idea from some people that you’ve got nothing but deadlock or stalemate. I was trying to point out that the early Bush administration is not that story at all.\n\nScully\n\nNo. In fact I had problems—\n\nYoung\n\nThere was, in fact, a lot of bipartisan work that it almost had to be, and you had key players on—\n\nScully\n\nAnd Republicans were irrelevant. So, in fact, I had problems and still do, because there are still some Republicans who are mad at me because when they were in minority, I spent too much time dealing with Democrats. But you know, Jay Rockefeller, with whom I worked a lot, is still a good friend of mine. Bob Kerrey, and that was all from the early Bush days. Because if you look at trying to get legislation passed, unless you want to just have a press conference, you have to talk to Democrats. You could go up and talk to Bill Archer all you want, but he wasn’t going to pass anything. You had to go to Rostenkowski and [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan and other people up there. And Senator [Robert] Byrd is a quirky guy. He was great to work with. We cut a zillion deals with him on all kinds of stuff, but he was not very partisan at all, very bottom line oriented. He was the majority leader and then became Chairman of the Appropriations Committee; he was a very powerful guy at both roles.\n\nYoung\n\nWhat problems does this create with the Republicans?\n\nScully\n\nA lot.\n\nYoung\n\nCan you talk about what kinds of problems they were and whether it affected Bush’s position in the party?\n\nScully\n\nThey didn’t affect Bush. They affected Darman and Sununu. A lot of people would get mad at Darman and Sununu for going up and cutting deals with Democrats. The ’90 budget deal was largely—everybody talks about Andrews Air Force Base; we really didn’t do much at Andrews Air Force Base except eat a lot of steak and drink a lot of beer. There was a long process during the ’90 budget deal, but it was largely Darman and Leon Panetta and Mitchell and Tom Foley\n\nYoung\n\nByrd?\n\nScully\n\nYes, Byrd got involved because of the appropriations caps, and he got involved more at the end. Basically the deal at the end was buying off Byrd by throwing these $10 billions of—none of these guys understood what the hell was going on. None of them understood the budget deals. I mean I didn’t understand what Darman was doing at the time, but there was a long, long negotiation. It was largely Darman and Panetta, [Jim] Sasser, who’s a very nice guy. A perfect example is Sasser, a nice guy who didn’t know the details. It used to drive Darman crazy. Panetta was a really good guy. He was very smart and very substantive. So 90 percent of the deal all along was between Darman and Panetta with other people coming in and getting involved in it, at least on the substance.\n\nBut then Republicans go crazy, and if you remember, one of the biggest problems we had is we had this bipartisan deal cut and we thought we had the votes to go through. At the very last minute the first time around, [Newt] Gingrich came out and opposed it and blew it all up. We had to go back to the drawing board and start it all over from scratch. Took another three months to get the second deal through and that was part of the problem.\n\nNobody will ever remember this, but Gingrich blew it up because at the time it looked politically good for him to blow it up. Newt’s a very good friend of mine, so I don’t mean to dump on him, but he blew it up. If you look at the second deal, we went back and ended up cutting about $40 billion less and adding in about $30 billion more taxes, so he nuked the first deal and then a month later he couldn’t get that back and we ended up with a much worse deal. Nobody ever writes about that or remembers that.\n\nShreve\n\nWere there elements in that deal—?\n\nScully\n\nPart of that frustration—I was sitting there with Gingrich and I really got to know him spending two weeks at Andrews Air Force Base with him during the budget summit. He was frustrated. It drove him crazy that Darman and Sununu, to some degree, would go cut all these deals with Democrats and then come by and say to the Republicans, “Oh, by the way, here’s the deal.” Well, I mean, there’s no other way to do it, but it still drove them nuts, and there were a lot of examples of that on all kinds of issues where they were frustrated. But when you get 165 Republicans in the House and 42 in the Senate, what are your choices? You don’t have a whole lot of choices. If you want to get anything done, you’ve got to deal with Democrats, but it’s still a source of frustration. And even seven years later I have conservative Republicans I deal with who still get mad at me because I wandered around and spent too much time cutting deals with Rostenkowski and Jay Rockefeller like that.\n\nShreve\n\nWere there elements in the 1990 deal that Darman went into the 13-day sessions at the air force base thinking, This is something I want and at the end, and I won’t compromise on this?\n\nScully\n\nThe whole deal was Darman’s right from the beginning. I don’t think I really understood it, and I still think the 1990 budget deal was a brilliant move on his part, whether you like him or you don’t. But he gets blamed for raising taxes, screwing up, and he didn’t get enough of the people involved who understood it. It was very Machiavellian and lots of blame for it.\n\nThe bottom line is the reason we have a budget surplus today is the budget caps and the pay-as-you-go entitlement rules. Those things didn’t exist before 1990 and nobody knew what the hell they were talking about. Darman’s whole deal was, “The government’s out of control. Congress is going to be Democratic for a long time most likely, and we need to rein these guys in.” And his whole thought was, We’ll throw $10 billion in appropriations out in the short term, and in the long term we’ll get these budget caps and lock them in. Henry Waxman had spent the whole decade of the ’80s pumping up Medicare and Medicaid and not paying for it and blowing the doors off the budget, and Waxman’s view was if you want to go expand Medicare (before 1990), you just did it, don’t worry about the cost. Or Medicaid, you just passed a law you didn’t have to pay for. And Darman’s view was that if they’re going to expand this benefit in Medicaid, they’re going to have to offset it someplace else.\n\nThat whole idea of pay-as-you-go and the entitlement programs was if you want to spend more on Medicare, you’ve got to raise taxes or cut other spending to pay for it. Or having budget caps. Everybody takes it for granted now. That didn’t exist before 1990 and Darman was very into the budget pools. His view was, “If we’ve got to buy off the Democrats in the short run with a little bit of cash to assure in the long term to fix the budget, that is even faster,” and he did it.\n\nThe mistake he made was he’s a lot more moderate than a lot of Republicans, and his view was, “People will scream for a while, but we’re at 75 percent in the polls. Reagan raised taxes too, and everybody bitched about it for a while but they forgot about it.” I think his view generally was President Bush would raise taxes. It was a smaller tax increase than Reagan’s was. People would bitch and moan but they’d get over. It was the right thing to do, and five years from now the budget’s balanced. It would be good policy and there was no other way to do it. The Democrats weren’t going to do it.\n\nMitchell’s number one deal—it turned out that Mitchell was smarter than Darman. Mitchell’s view was, “I’m going to get them to raise taxes so we can beat the crap out of them for the next few years.” All Mitchell wanted to do was get a public acknowledgment that we need to raise taxes, and he got it, and that’s what turned the election. Darman’s view was, and this was in 1990, long before the Persian Gulf War and other things in between, Darman’s view was in 1990, “We’ve got all this political popularity in the polls, let’s do the right thing, do this deal structure. We’ll recover. We’ll be all right and we’ll get reelected. People will forget about it.”\n\nIn the intervening time, don’t forget, after 1990 the Persian Gulf War happened, Bush was a hero. We were all doing great. It wasn’t until later when he started getting beaten up for the “read my lips” stuff by people, mainly by Pat Buchanan. In my opinion, that was the biggest mistake he made. It’s one thing to raise taxes. The answer should be I did it because it was the principled thing to do at the time. You don’t apologize for it and say you made a mistake. That’s what killed us, I think.\n\nMasoud\n\nWere there doubting Thomases in the administration that when Darman was saying, “Listen, people will forget about it”?\n\nScully\n\nDarman didn’t say, “Forget about it.” He had four associates and he was closest to Bob Grady and me, and so we probably talked the most. That’s where he was coming from privately. Publicly he was saying, “Look, the government’s out of control. We’ve got a $300 billion deficits. The Democrats are going to spend, spend, spend. We need to get some budget stuff, and the only way the Democrats are going to get any kind of control of the budget is we can cut—”\n\nI think the whole deal was $300 billion over five years, but it was basically a third defense cuts, a third Medicare and entitlement cuts, which was all my stuff, and a third tax increases. That was the deal. A third, a third, a third. If we cut defense a third, we cut domestic entitlement spending by a third, and we raise taxes a third, and that was the deal from the beginning. His argument was, “We’re never going to get the Democrats to do it. It’s the only choice. It’s the right thing to do.” And it was the right thing to do, and the issue was Republicans were in a position because of the Peggy Noonan speech, “read my lips.” We were in a bad position; the Democrats are going to make us eat it and they did.\n\nDarman’s view was, “So we’ll eat it, but still it’s the right thing to do. People will forget about it. We’ll be fine.” If you went from October of 1990 to October or November of 1991, none of this stuff even came up. We were doing great. The Persian Gulf War, nobody thought about it, and nobody said, “read my lips” and that stuff until Pat Buchanan started beating Bush up with it and Mitchell started taking shots at it and the bottom started to fall out. The other stuff came back and then President Bush said, “I made a mistake. I never should have raised taxes.”\n\nMasoud\n\nSo there was no real sense in the White House that this could really come back to haunt us at the time the decision was made?\n\nScully\n\nThere was some—sure. Of course, there was. I mean, we didn’t sign off on the tax increase lightly. This is saying, “Look, this is the right thing to do at the time. George Bush is taking the leadership. Democrats control Congress. We hate tax increases more than anybody, but that’s what these bastards are going to make us do.”\n\nYoung\n\nI’d like to get at that in a different way and I think clearly the budget deal was from a policy and a political point of view, an important event, but the question in my mind is how was the President laying down guidance, if he was, during the extended negotiations that finally came through?\n\nScully\n\nDuring that time I was not in those meetings with them. I was in all the budget negotiations on the Hill, I think all of them, just about, except for a very few that were just Mitchell and Darman and Foley. President Bush was involved, but it was almost always just Darman and Sununu and Bush sitting around talking about what they should do, and then Darman spent a lot of time with him, so I assume he explained everything.\n\nYoung\n\nSo the understandings were reached about what you could negotiate with the President by the people who were negotiating.\n\nScully\n\nOh, yes. You’ve got to have some idea. I think there was no question the President was extremely involved with that decision, but I think President Bush’s view was we had a $300 billion deficit and we had to close the hole and there wasn’t an option—the option was the Democrats want to raise taxes and we want to cut spending. Somewhere you’ve got to compromise. You can say forget it, but the right thing to do is to work out a deal and we didn’t have the leverage to do anything else. So the only option was blow it up, have a press conference and say we’re never ever, ever, ever, ever raising taxes and we don’t really care about the deficit, and let things go merrily along.\n\nI think the view was that this approach was irresponsible. There are certainly people in the White House that didn’t like it and were not happy about it, but there was nobody in the White House who had a significant power base to do much about it outside of Darman and Sununu, I don’t think. There were some other guys running around, like Jim Pinkerton, about whom I don’t remember having strong feelings, who were a lot more conservative, but that period of time they just didn’t have the ability to really change the policy. It was really 95 percent Sununu and Darman, with President Bush, obviously, and Baker who probably could’ve changed anything. Baker, from the beginning of the administration, I think, pretty much said, “Look, I’ve done this before. I want to do foreign policy. I’m the Secretary of State, leave me alone.” He got dragged back in as Chief of Staff.\n\nMasoud\n\nWhere’s Porter on this? Was he not an important element?\n\nScully\n\nHe’s not really involved in any real way. Roger was a wonderful guy. Darman loved having Roger as Domestic Policy Advisor because he was a nonfactor.\n\nStrong\n\nSo there’s no one making an argument that a reelection strategy is hold to the “read my lips” and just let the deficit run wild and maybe make the Democrats suffer for—\n\nScully\n\nThere may have been, but nobody that I was aware of, and I think [Lee] Atwater was still alive at that point and he was not making that—He was more moderate too. Again, his personality too, from a political point of view, he was a fairly practical guy.\n\nStrong\n\nWas there anyone—?\n\nScully\n\nNobody liked raising taxes, but I think there were some fairly responsible, moderate, reasonable people, and there’s no question it was the right thing to do. Would we have loved to have just cut spending and not raise taxes? Sure, but we didn’t have the votes to do it, so the issue was take a walk or work out a deal and I think one of my frustrations is the first deal, if you went back and looked at it, was substantially better than the second deal. The guys who broke the first deal were the conservatives like Newt who were actually not going to raise taxes. Three weeks later, they were back working on a worse deal with more taxes, which was pretty stupid.\n\nYoung\n\nImagine the Republicans had been in the majority in Congress. How do you think that deal would have come out, given the fact that the—?\n\nScully\n\nWell, if the Republicans had been in a majority in Congress, you wouldn’t have tax increases. You would have had tax cut and program spending cuts and you still would have balanced the budget. If you look at spending growth in the ’80s and ’90s, it was 15 percent, 20 percent a year. Even now, it’s probably 10 percent, 12 percent a year, so the issue is not—\n\nYoung\n\nSo Gingrich would have, in a Reagan-controlled Congress—\n\nScully\n\nAbsolutely no doubt that if I could have sat down with Newt Gingrich and John Danforth, for instance, who was a very moderate guy, or any Republican Senator and worked out a package. You could have a very successful package that would have balanced the budget and reduced the deficit over the course of six or seven years and have a tax cut. The issue is you don’t have the votes to do it. It’s not what the Democrat majority wanted. That’s not what their constituents wanted. You may not be happy about it, but that’s the hand you’re dealt and that’s the way it goes. It was not like where you have a close majority.\n\nWe had huge legislative fights and we’d work our tails off. If we got 200 votes, that was a victory. I can’t remember us ever winning a House vote that we cared about in the four years of the Bush administration. It was just impossible. We weren’t even remotely close to—I mean, we’d have to swing 40 Democrats to win a vote on anything. I can’t remember us winning a vote in four years in the House, even the Senate. But I can remember, if we got over 200 votes in the House, we’d sit around and have a party over what a great success that was.\n\nYoung\n\nBut overall you had a fairly successful time in the office, given those—\n\nScully\n\nOh, we worked out deals with Democrats when they were with us. That was great. Like on the budget deal. If you went back and looked at the votes, I’ll bet you would find that that was—RBRVS, Physician Pay Reform—Bush and Rockefeller and Rostenkowski doing a deal over the objections of all the Republicans in the House and the AMA [American Medical Association] because back then the AMA was all Republican. They were fighting us to the death. The AMA thought this was price controls and the budget deal was bad for them too. I’d bet you’d find that probably two-thirds of the Republicans voted against the budget deal.\n\nWhen we did deals, we’d do a deal with the Democrats. We’d get the Democrat majority behind it and we’d pick off enough moderate Republicans to pass it, because it was the only way we’d get anything done. But usually the majority of the conservative Republicans and anything you’d see that passed, any time we had a fight with the Republicans versus Democrats, we’d lose overwhelmingly. Rarely did it pick off enough conservative Democrats to do it. Ninety percent of the deals we did were getting the Democrats to agree to a compromise, maybe a few very liberal Democrats would vote against it. Most of the Democrats would vote for it, and you’d pick off a third of the moderate Republicans and you’d pass something, but usually that would be very controversial, just like the ’90 budget deal.\n\nOne of the keys to getting the ’90 budget deal through was finally getting Phil Gramm, who was in all the negotiations, to sign off on it. Because once Phil Gramm signed off on it, a whole bunch of conservatives, budget zealot Senate Republicans, signed off on it too. They figured it was good enough for Phil Gramm and he was involved in it. Phil Gramm, for instance, backed the deal and said, “Look, I wish we could cut taxes and do more on the spending cuts, but this is the best we’re going to do and I hate it but I’m going to hold my nose and vote for it.” Phil Gramm’s not exactly a liberal and he was in every single budget meeting absent the real senior ones that I know of.\n\nStrong\n\nWere there advocates for doing something like the budget deal earlier? You had the National Economic Commission sort of in place before the ’88 election with a lot of the bipartisan representation.\n\nScully\n\nI think it’s even tougher. When we first came in—Bob Strauss chaired that if I remember, and I’d been at Akin, Gump. I was an associate then at that point at that firm, but I knew a whole lot of those guys. I knew Strauss well, and Drew Lewis, I think, was the other co-chair. You’re getting into really ancient history, but I think when we first came in a lot of those—it was like the Social Security deal in ’83. There were a lot of really bipartisan ideas on compromise including tax increases—\n\nStrong\n\nAnd entitlement controls and—\n\nScully\n\nYes, and discussion about doing that, but I think the thought early on when that first came up was that we got this tossed in our lap and we have to make an immediate decision about where to go. Sununu was the Chief of Staff. He started out—He’s a very conservative guy and he got more moderate and more pragmatic as he found it was the only way to get things done over the next year. The first thing out of the box right after the election, we were going to come up and do this big compromise deal and raises taxes. “I don’t think so” was the basic thought and the best thing we could do was drive the thing off a cliff, which we kind of did.\n\nShreve\n\nIt’s been said that in the Reagan administration one of the things that hamstrung their policy makers on something like that kind of a deal was that they had monetarists, supply-siders, balance-the-budget types working at cross purposes or in conflict and therefore could not come to an amenable decision. Did you see that that had pretty much been resolved by that point or certain folks had been ushered out by the time the Bush folks are considering such a deal?\n\nScully\n\nIn ’89?\n\nShreve\n\nYes, ’89 or even ’90.\n\nScully\n\nI had a lot of friends who worked for Reagan but there was not a lot of—it was a clear camp of Reagan folks and Bush folks. If [Albert, Jr.] Gore wins, you may find a lot of holdovers. President Bush and President Reagan got along pretty well, I think, but when Reagan was President for eight years, none of the Bush people were ever involved and they were pretty much shut out to a large degree.\n\nThere were some Reagan holdovers, but there was a clear group of Bush people who’d been waiting for eight years and they had not exactly been treated lovingly by a lot of the Reagan people. I mean, Darman was a Reagan person. Jim Baker was a Bush person, but he ended up working for Reagan, but there weren’t a whole lot of people that were Reagan people hanging around to have a big policy effect. There were some. John Cogan, who was a great guy at Stanford was a Reagan person. John was the deputy at OMB for a while. Marlin Fitzwater was a Reagan person, but Marlin was really a civil servant who just happened into it. But the real Lyn Nofziger types and the real Reagan people that were driving policy, Ed Meese and those people, they were not ever really tied in with Bush people.\n\nShreve\n\nHow about professional economists? Any of those folks called upon regularly at that point?\n\nScully\n\nMike Boskin was very involved early on, but Boskin always got along great with Darman and was pretty close to Sununu and he’d get involved, but—and I like Mike a lot. I also did Mike’s transition. I defended his confirmation, too, but he just was not a political guy. He got along because Bush really liked him and they’d get him involved, but he followed Darman and Sununu’s lead a lot and he was not really political, so he’d give them advice and get engaged, but he would never take them on.\n\nShreve\n\nBy the end of the Reagan administration, for example, I think it was close to the end, where the President said of economists, “They all wear Phi Beta Kappa keys at the end of their watch chains but have no watches.” So that there was some disdain for professional economic advice. Did that continue?\n\nScully\n\nI don’t think so. Economists’ advice about what’s going to happen to the economy if you don’t do a budget deal, if you don’t restrain spending and projections—economists can give you advice of what’s likely to happen, but they can’t implement the politics of it, which is much tougher. I didn’t see anybody who was an economist who was involved in the decision-making of what should we do. I mean, it was pretty clear what we needed to do.\n\nThe Democrats wanted to catch us on raising taxes and shove the “read my lips” down our throats, which they eventually did, and we wanted to get the budget deficit under control and thought it would improve the economy, which it eventually did, and we didn’t have any choice. We had to swallow hard and eat it, which maybe was the wrong political judgment but it was the right thing to do. And my regret is that I don’t think you should apologize for doing the right thing. Politically we were in a box and President Bush made the judgment that it was the right thing to do and I think it was. Unfortunately he paid for it in the long run.\n\nShreve\n\nWas there any second guessing during the ’92 campaign, for instance, when they were looking for a fiscal stimulus?\n\nScully\n\nWas there any second guessing?\n\nShreve\n\nAbout the budget deal?\n\nScully\n\nEvery day. I listened to it at lunch every day. “If it wasn’t for you guys (OMB), we wouldn’t be where we are.” There was a lot of whining and moaning and lot of hindsight 20/20, but there are a lot of things that happen in the intervening years. But you could make the argument that one of the main reasons we lost in ’92 was the no new taxes thing. You could also make the argument that whoever wrote the “no new taxes, read my lips” speech was a fool. He—or she—didn’t have political judgment.\n\nYoung\n\nI was looking at a tape yesterday—\n\nScully\n\nYou need a lot of things to get elected.\n\nYoung\n\n—of interviews with President Bush by David Frost, and he was asked about that “read my lips” and about the tax increase that was part of that budget deal and Bush replied that he made a mistake in making the commitment in the campaign, not that he made a mistake on the budget deal.\n\nScully\n\nWell, it’s hard. You’ve got to remember that you do a lot of things to get elected. He’s put a lot of time and energy into it and you get very tied up into it. Peggy Noonan wrote that speech and put it in there and everybody loved it and thought it was great. I think he gave it at the convention. I was working on the campaign and the partner at Akin, Gump I worked for, a good friend of mine, became Lloyd Bentsen’s campaign manager, and they called me up after the Democrat convention and said, “You’ve got to come back and take care of our clients. You’re 17 points down. This thing is over. Come on back here.”\n\nWe already thought it was over and most of the Republicans thought Bush was toast and thought we were going to lose to [Michael] Dukakis, so when you’re down like that, you don’t sit around and think too much about what’s going to happen later. You throw the kitchen sink at it, and a great rhetorical line like, “read my lips, no new taxes” sounded great and maybe it did help him win among many, many other things. But if you knew you were going to win, you probably wouldn’t say it, so maybe it was a mistake.\n\nBut you also might say that if he hadn’t in gotten the position where he was 17 points down in August and throwing everything but the kitchen sink at Dukakis and thinking of everything he could do to win, maybe he wouldn’t have won. He’d be sitting around Houston wondering what President Dukakis was going to do. So I think he probably did make a mistake and I think he probably felt bad about it, but at the time, given the situation he was in, giving a good speech with some great rhetorical punch lines in it probably is not a bad idea.\n\nIn hindsight, I’m sure he regrets doing it and it made our life difficult. We knew we were going to get trashed. We ran right into this tax increase, but there was an awful lot of stuff in the ’90 bill that was labeled as a tax increase that really was not a tax increase. It was a continuation of expiring tax provisions. We allowed the tax increase to get defined as a tax increase when a lot of it was not a tax increase. It was an extension of existing law of the tax provisions.\n\nStrong\n\nSemantics is always very important in that area.\n\nScully\n\nIt is, and once again, we were not really good. President Clinton—I have a lot of friends who work for Clinton. They are unbelievably good at the PR side of it, and that’s not a criticism. That’s part of the job.\n\nYoung\n\nSo was Reagan, too. He never raised taxes.\n\nScully\n\nThat’s right. He raised taxes a lot more than—\n\nYoung\n\nBut to hear his speeches, never.\n\nMasoud\n\nWas there any operation in OMB that tried to sell this to the public or in the White House? You didn’t have to rely on the President to sell it.\n\nScully\n\nI think personally one of the problems was that Darman spent a lot of time trying to sell it and Sununu spent a lot of time trying to sell it. If the President had been intensely engaged in it, and it had been his idea and he had sold it, it would have been much more effective, because we went back and looked at the sales pitch back then about what a great deal this was. It was the Democrats saying, “We have to do this because it’s the right thing and we’re going to raise taxes because we need to support all these programs.” And it was the Republicans saying, “It’s the only way we’re going to balance the budget.” But it was largely Darman out there making those arguments.\n\nYoung\n\nBut why would the President not do that? It’s not a question of taking—\n\nScully\n\nThat’s the way we did things. There wasn’t a big media push or campaign to sell it. There wasn’t a national tour to sell his deal which probably today President Clinton would have done. It was just, we’ll go on Meet the Press and tell them why we’re doing it, why we’re smart, and it was usually Darman saying, “This is ugly stuff, I’ll take the hits.” Or Sununu. And it wasn’t the President out there saying, “This is the right thing to do and I hate raising taxes, but this really isn’t a tax increase.” If you went back and looked at the press back then, I’ll bet you’d find that President Bush was not out taking the lead. It wasn’t because he didn’t want to. Nobody said, “Here’s the media plan.”\n\nYoung\n\nI don’t recall a major speech either on the subject, but I do recall quite a speech by Ronald Reagan saying, “We’ve got to stay the course” when there was a lot of pressure building up and he made a mistake—\n\nScully\n\nAgain, I like many of our media people—Marlin’s terrific. His job was really responding to the press stuff. I don’t think we had a person who sat around and thought big thoughts about public strategy.\n\nMasoud\n\nBut there was no similar failing in, say, the Gulf War, for example, where the President is very much out there and making a lot of speeches.\n\nScully\n\nHe was engaged and he cared about it and was viscerally involved in it. He didn’t want to go out and take credit for it. I don’t think he ever really did take credit for it, but he thought this was the right thing to do, “and I’m committed and I’m going to do it.” He was doing it out of his personal beliefs and he projected that. Nobody was out there coaching him on how to do it.\n\nYoung\n\nAnd explained why he was doing it, but there was no explanation on the budget deal or things related to that. There was no high level explanation from the President, so it looked like he was much more engaged than perhaps he was, but he wasn’t in the public’s eye. It seemed to me that he didn’t appear to adopt this as one of his things and to explain and give the answer to the Democrats.\n\nScully\n\nI think he wasn’t happy. It was like going to the dentist. He probably wasn’t thrilled about it either. It was just something he had to do and I think he was convinced he had to do it. He wasn’t excited about it. If somebody had come up to him and said, “You know what? Whether you’re excited about it or not, we need to do a two-week media tour and go out and promote this and say this is the right thing for America. We need to improve the economy,” he would have done it, but I don’t think anybody ever did that.\n\nYoung\n\nWas there any effort to build constituency support—not involving Presidential tours or anything like that—for the budget arrangements? Or was it really all worked out inside Washington?\n\nScully\n\nI think it was all worked inside Washington from what I saw. There were little things in there for different people. For instance, the childcare thing I mentioned was a big deal to the conservatives. I spent a ton of time on that because there were vouchers for childcare and they thought that was the next step toward vouchers for education, so we spent a lot of time getting that in and asking the conservatives in the summer of 1990, “What do you really, really want?”\n\nGary Bauer, who was in my office all the time pushing all this stupid stuff, one of the great knuckleheads of all time, was worried about the wee tot EITC [Earned Income Tax Credit] for childcare. He didn’t give a damn about raising taxes. I mean, there were a thousand little issues that everybody wanted their own little thing, for the families, whatever his group is called. What they wanted was the EITC for staying-home moms and child care for $500, and I said, “How about raising taxes?” “I don’t care, as long as I get my—” There were a lot of little constituent packages in that deal. It was much more than a budget deal. It was a huge piece of legislation with tons and tons of constituency interest for Medicare, for hospitals, for doctors, for appropriations bills, for people who had bridge-building programs and transportation.\n\nShreve\n\nWomen, Infants, Children program, I believe.\n\nScully\n\nWIC?\n\nShreve\n\nYes, WIC. Was that increased slightly?\n\nScully\n\nI don’t know. We increased WIC every year. We had jacked up WIC and Head Start massively because I thought it was good politics for the President to look compassionate to the poor and be worried about social programs. We did it every year and I’d fight for it every year but you know, you never get any credit for it because Democrats are going to beat you up no matter what, and no matter what you do for the poor in those programs, as a Republican you’ll never get any credit. People were generally right. We never got any credit for it. But we increased WIC a lot and Head Start a lot, and I had all those programs and we cranked a lot of money to that. WIC was increased ever year pretty massively, probably 25 to 30 percent a year. And I’ll bet Head Start went up 20 percent a year. I’ll bet nobody ran an article about how much President Bush increased the program.\n\nYoung\n\nI don’t know. We haven’t interviewed anybody and I don’t know much about it. The public liaison operation of the White House is again Marlin Fitzwater, but some other Presidents earlier have brought in groups to give them talks in the East Room or something, selling their own policies but to targeted groups for White House support.\n\nScully\n\nWe did a lot of that.\n\nYoung\n\nYou did a lot of that? Was it on fiscal policy?\n\nScully\n\nYes. I think we had lots of outside groups in. We had people in twice a week sitting around being with the President.\n\nYoung\n\nDid it do any good?\n\nScully\n\nI’ve always thought that stuff was of limited value outside the Beltway. It is often D.C. trade association politics, now I run a trade association, but the real issue is: Do you go out and do the Today Show or Good Morning America? Nobody did back then. I mentioned this in my speech. The real constituent guys reaches the guys out there in Topeka. He doesn’t know that his trade association person is coming to the Cabinet Room and getting a pitch. Maybe he’ll see it in his association newsletter, for instance, a month later, but the real communication that I think Reagan did much better and that Clinton has done much, much better was just getting out there and talking to people publicly, whether it’s the press or TV or whatever about what you’re doing, which I didn’t think we really had a big strategy for.\n\nYoung\n\nDo you think that would have changed if Bush had been reelected? If there had been a reelection, what changes, if any, do you see?\n\nScully\n\nI don’t think we ever had—and I worked for David, who’s great. David did a good job, but the role that David Demarest had, the people on our communications operations had, was generally setting up the President’s trips, getting the local press there. That never got defined as a big strategy, and I never got the feeling that David was ever tasked with doing that.\n\nI think if Roger Ailes—I worked in the ’88 campaign. Ailes is a brilliant guy, and Ailes had that view, big picture, mass merchandizing, Proctor & Gamble, sell the President as a product. If we’d had a Roger Ailes-type person in the White House, which President Clinton has had, Reagan had, it would have been different. We didn’t have anybody like that who sat around. Sig Rogich was there but Sig Rogich just wasn’t the same kind of guy. He was an advertising guy, but he wasn’t the kind of guy who walked in every day and had an idea that, “We’re going to go sell you like soap.”\n\nShreve\n\nYour description of the President sounds like that kind of a person would have clashed with his outlook and approach.\n\nScully\n\nUnless they’re really strong and tough, like David is a really good guy and a terrific staffer, but David wasn’t the kind of guy who had the stature to walk in to President Bush’s office and say, “God damn, whether you like it or not, we’ve got to go sell you at x, y and z,” and Sig Rogich wasn’t either. The reason that Ailes was so good in the ’80 campaign was he was like that. He would go push Bush and tell Bush, “This is what you’re going to do.”\n\nI think if you look back in history, you’ll find that the primary reason Dan Quayle got picked—it may not have been that great an idea—was that Roger Ailes told him it was the right thing to do, which stunned all of us. But Ailes was tough and aggressive, and a guy like Bush who doesn’t like promoting himself and doesn’t like taking credit for stuff needs somebody like Ailes who’s going to come in and grab him by the nape of the neck and say, “You may not like it, but you’re going to go do it.” We didn’t have anybody who would do that kind of stuff and maybe Clinton and Reagan were more inclined to do it on their own. Bush’s inclination was to give credit to somebody else, which is an endearing, wonderful quality when you work for a guy like that, but it’s got its drawbacks.\n\nYoung\n\nWould you make the same generalization about Sununu being the mean guy and Bush the good guy?\n\nScully\n\nBut Sununu was a not a PR guy.\n\nScully\n\nNo, but in dealing inside?\n\nScully\n\nYes, but Sununu was very effective with Bush. He could get Bush to do a lot of stuff. I wasn’t privy to private conversations they had about whether it was a good idea to finally sign off on the budget deal or not, but I’m sure that Sununu was the conservative barometer. One of the reasons he became Chief of Staff was because he was the conservative pick and he was also a good friend of the Bushes, but he was the guy to work with conservatives, how they reacted. I think Sununu was as conservative as they get. If Sununu thought it was OK, fine. But Sununu was a Governor of a little state where there wasn’t a lot of media, didn’t live in that big environment. I think if he’d been the Governor of New York or Texas it would have been different, but he didn’t think in terms of how you project beyond the nightly news. What else do you do to get the message out? I just don’t think he thought that way.\n\nYoung\n\nI think the same thing, for different reasons, would it have been true of Darman. He wasn’t a public—\n\nScully\n\nNo. Darman thought more in terms of Congress and the PR. How you would get things done in Congress and how you project yourself there. He thought he was a big press person, I mean, but there’s a difference between a Roger Ailes and a—Roger Ailes is a media guy. He understands how to do it. I spent a lot time with him in ’88 and Ailes was really, really good. I didn’t see much of him—He was around but not that much after we won.\n\nIs this the right direction? I’m just kind of rambling all over the place, I know.\n\nShreve\n\nI think you put a lot of things on the table to talk about.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nScully\n\n—Darman basically just crushed him in the first week and made him totally irrelevant. Basically cut him out of everything.\n\nYoung\n\nYou’re not talking about Skinner?\n\nScully\n\nNo, no, this was Charlie Kolb.\n\nYoung\n\nThis was before Skinner.\n\nScully\n\nThis was earlier on. This was probably two years into the administration. Charlie became Roger Porter’s deputy. I’d said it was good to hire him. You were asking about the books—Charlie wrote a book. Charlie, who’s never been forgiven by anyone. It was the one incredibly unbelievable thing you would ever think of as a Bush staffer, to write a kiss and tell book afterward. Charlie was so cut out of everything that for him to be in a position to write a book was a joke, but Charlie wrote a book afterward called White House Daze. He took a lot of shots at people.\n\nCharlie came as Roger’s deputy, and `in the first week and decided to pick a fight with Darman. Darman basically just crushed him and cut him out of everything, and Charlie sat in his office for two years and had no role. Then when we lost, and he wrote a book about how terrible it was. If they would have listened to him, everything would have been fine? And he may have been right. But I can tell you, a lot of people may have thought that, but they didn’t write books. Nobody’s talked to Charlie in seven years that I know of. He’s the most unpopular guy as a result of that book.\n\nYoung\n\nBefore we get back into this, do you have any advice for us about how we can nab Dick Darman for an interview?\n\nMasoud\n\nHe’s agreed to do it.\n\nYoung\n\nBut he doesn’t answer his—\n\nScully\n\nHe doesn’t answer his calls or what?\n\nYoung\n\nWell, he doesn’t schedule a time and he doesn’t respond. We have to schedule some things.\n\nScully\n\nWould you be willing to go to Washington to do it? This is easy for me because I’m down here a lot anyway. I have a house down here.\n\nYoung\n\nIt’s harder for us. If we have to, we will. He says he needs time and he also wants to share with us some documents, which is all good.\n\nScully\n\nOh, he will give more information. If he does it, you’ll be astounded when he does these things. I was always amazed. Like when I’d testify in Congress, I’d sit down four hours before I was to do it and I’d write up a testimony and wing it and type it up and ship it off to the Hill. Darman would testify. It was an event. We’d spent weeks on it and he would mull over every word and make major statements. He’d make major statements that would have major impact and you’d find reporters and people would read his testimony. Two years later they’d pick things out of his testimony. He will do a lot of research, a lot of homework, and he’ll come loaded for bear.\n\nYoung\n\nWell, we’ll give him time.\n\nScully\n\nAnd he’ll be very good at defending himself.\n\nYoung\n\nHe won’t have to with us.\n\nScully\n\nHe will, and I think he has some grounds to do it. I think he will never get credit for it, but I can tell you, if you ask Leon Panetta or anybody else who was involved in the serious budget policy in the ’90s, the 1990 budget deal may have lost an election but that’s the reason you’ve got a surplus today. Those rules didn’t exist—\n\nYoung\n\nThat’s pretty evident from people who study these things.\n\nScully\n\nAnd the only person who understood that deal at the time, including me and any of the people who worked for me, was Darman. The way the deals were broken up was Bill Diefenderfer, who was the deputy, who was Bob Packwood’s old chief of staff. He’s a guy you ought to talk to—Diefenderfer did all the tax negotiations. Diefenderfer negotiated the ’86 tax bill, the big tax restructure in ’86. He was a tax guru, he was the deputy, and he was Packwood’s chief guy for years. He was a brilliant tax guy. He did most of the tax stuff with Darman’s input—what taxes you’re going to change—and I did most of the Medicare and entitlement stuff. Grady had the appropriations stuff because he had a bunch of those things, but it was kind of broken up into groups and little subnegotiations.\n\nDarman and Bob and Barry Anderson, who’s now the number two guy at the Congressional Budget Office, who was a career civil servant, those two guys did all the process stuff, and I can tell you that the Democrats had no idea what they were doing to them. They had them tied up in knots. They just didn’t understand them. All that stuff—they were focused on the spending and the tax increases, and Darman was focused on the process. Now that the smoke’s cleared ten years later, we lost the war, then we lost an election over it, but there’s no question that they didn’t know, and they never would have agreed to those budget restraints had they understood what was going to happen to them.\n\nYoung\n\nPay-as-you-go and caps.\n\nScully\n\nPay-as-you-go and the caps was very cryptic and that was the one thing Darman really wanted. He got it in there and he swapped a bunch of other stuff for it, and in the long run it was a great policy thing to do, but nobody understood at the time, including me. He was trying to explain it to me after we’d signed off on the deal about how it was going to work, and how we’d have to wait for three or four years. We gave them a ton of money up front so they all think this is great, and they’ll change it later, but we got them tied up in a box and they’ll never get out of it, and he was right. They never have gotten out of it. We just weren’t around to see it. He knew what he was doing.\n\nYoung\n\nYou mentioned a while back, of course, Darman and Jim Baker had a history together, but not in the Bush White House.\n\nScully\n\nIt was the Reagan White House.\n\nYoung\n\nIn the Reagan White House. But in the Bush White House, they weren’t connected in their work.\n\nScully\n\nI think Darman got the job because of Baker. Baker and Bush obviously are very close. Have been since they were young, and Darman had a reputation—It’s my understanding the way Darman got the job is a lot of people didn’t like Darman from the Reagan administration because he had sharp elbows and he was tough and he wanted to be the director of OMB and Baker basically said to Bush—Bush didn’t like Darman much from the Reagan administration either apparently—he may have his warts, but he’s a smart guy. He gets things done. He’s brilliant and he’ll do a great job for you and I think it was Baker that got Darman hired, so Darman always looked at Baker as kind of his mentor, but Baker disappeared for three years.\n\nDarman and I got to be great friends and I like him a lot. We had our fights. I can give you some history of that too. Sununu—who Darman treated kind of as—they were kind of equals, even though Sununu was a little higher, but they’d spar with each other and playfully beat each other up, but Darman was never intimidated by Sununu. If you went to a meeting in Sununu’s office with Darman, the two of them would do 98 percent of the talking and they’d beat up everybody else, but they were kind of coequals and partners and did things together.\n\nAfter Sununu got canned, Darman and Skinner just hated each other, which caused a lot of Skinner’s problems. It was interesting because when Baker later came in as Chief of Staff, Darman was like a little boy. It was amazing to watch. One of the first couple of meetings I went to in Baker’s office, where Baker was the Chief of Staff and Darman—if you went to a meeting with Sununu or anybody else with Darman, Darman was very forceful, in your face, totally dominated the debate and everything else, and it was either Sununu and Darman and everybody else was a second-tier person, or Skinner and Darman and everybody was a second-tier person. When you got in a meeting with Baker, Darman was the polite little boy with his hands folded listening and was just another staffer. It was a complete character change.\n\nShreve\n\nWas that abrasiveness in his character part of the reason he didn’t bring any associates with him when he first came on?\n\nScully\n\nYes. I think that’s probably what he’d tell you. I talked to him about that because he was brutal with me. He was working for Shearson Lehman Brothers during the transition and he had an office over on 17th Street and I’d go pick him up for meetings to go to the Hill. He was very rough on me, but I’d been doing this stuff for a while and I had a reasonably thick skin, and I gave him some crap back after a while—pardon my French—and we got along. I made clear there was only so much I was going to put up with. I think he kind of liked that and he liked people to fight back.\n\nI may have told you this story, but when I went over and worked for him, we had a conference room like this with a table a little bigger than this, and every morning we’d have an 8: 00 staff meeting with like the top 15 people. He was very into legislation and at the time, the first eight months or whatever, I was running legislative affairs, so I ran the meetings in the morning and sat across from him. He’d belittle me and humiliate me and beat the crap out of me and just torture me every day at the staff meeting for 45 minutes. “You don’t know what you’re doing.” I did know what I was doing, but that was just the way he was. He was just really vicious. In fact, I think if you go over those articles, there’re a couple of those articles that alluded to how brutal he was to me early on.\n\nI think probably about March I called up Akin, Gump and said, “Look, I hate this son of a bitch, I’m quitting, I’m coming back.” I had already decided I was leaving and he beat me up at a staff meeting one day and I followed him back to his office and I walked right down the hall and slammed the door behind him and I yelled about 4,000 four-letter words at him and told him what an ass he was and quit. It was the best thing I ever did because he came back to my office about an hour later with his tail between his legs and apologized and said, “I really don’t want you to quit, I want you to stick around,” and for the next 3½ years I got along great. I was mad enough, I was really quitting, but unless you got to the point where he was kind of a bully and unless he thought you were not going to put up with it, he would push you around, and a lot of people put up with it.\n\nStrong\n\nDid he interview you for the job at OMB or did he already know enough from congressional escorting you’d done?\n\nScully\n\nI don’t think he ever really interviewed me. I probably took him to meetings with 15 Senators. I think he just in the corridor one day said, “Hey, you want to come work for me?” And I said, “Well, I don’t know. I’ve got a couple of job offers. Let me think about it.”\n\nStrong\n\nNow in escorting him around to those Senators, were you telling him information he didn’t have about what staff people he might meet?\n\nScully\n\nYou could try, but it was hard.\n\nStrong\n\nOK. So you were driving him around?\n\nScully\n\nNo. I set up the meetings and some of the Senators—a lot of them I knew better than he did, which he didn’t like because I’d been doing it for a while. When I was at Akin Gump I was a lobbyist. It was an interesting process. It was funny. The worst thing—three straight days in a row, I took Mike Boskin, Darman, and I forget who the other was, in to see Don Riegle, who was the Senator from Michigan, and you would have thought I wasn’t there.\n\nRiegle, who was the Democrat from Michigan, used to be a Republican. It was like an instant replay. I was the only person in the meeting with two of them most of the time, and in every case he walked in and said, “Did you know that George Bush and I were—” And he’d walk up in this closet and pull out this little scrapbook, pull out his little pictures of George Bush and him back in 1966 when they went to Congress together. It was the same pitch and it was unreal. I was sitting there. Did he not realize I was here yesterday listening to the same crap? Three days in a row with three different guys.\n\nShreve\n\nAnd he didn’t wink at you?\n\nScully\n\nHe didn’t wink at me or look at me. It was just like he was on drugs or something. I couldn’t believe it, and of course, I’d go out and tell each of the nominees. For Darman, you know, he did the exact same thing, the same meeting. It’s like you pushed a button, proving that he was really George Bush’s best buddy. I don’t know. Darman was a complex guy. I think Darman knew I knew a fair amount about the Hill and what was going on, so he used me a lot, but it was tough. When I first started doing legislative stuff, when he’d go to the Hill and lobby, he wouldn’t bring me and I’d have fights with him and say, “Look, if you don’t want me to go to the Hill with you and start helping you out, then why don’t you just get rid of me? You don’t need a legislative affairs officer if you’re going to do it all yourself.” And he’d say I didn’t need to come to this meeting.\n\nWhen I first—like two months after I got there, because I knew Bob Michel, who was then the ranking Republican, and I knew Dole really well, so he just wouldn’t tell me what he was doing. I’d find out where he was going, up to be with Representative Michel or Senator Dole. I’d go first and I’d be in there talking to Michael and Dole when he showed up and he’d get really pissed off. He threatened to fire me one time. “You shouldn’t be going to this meeting.” I said, “Well, if you’re not going to use me I’m just going to show up.” You just had to deal with him that way because he wanted me to go do his lobbying for him, but he’d go around and have meetings with these members and wouldn’t tell me. So I just said, “Fine, I know them as well as you do. I’ll just show up. You can throw me out.”\n\nMasoud\n\nNow what happened when you became associate director for human resources and veterans and labor? Did he fill the congressional liaison post or did he—\n\nScully\n\nYes, just a little different because my deputy went and did it. A guy named David Taylor.\n\nYoung\n\nTaylor was your deputy?\n\nScully\n\nYes, and Shawn Smeallie was my first deputy. He left and then David Taylor.\n\nMasoud\n\nNobody’s officially appointed though until, I think, ’92. Is that right?\n\nScully\n\nPart of it’s just the way Darman operates. In the beginning, Darman and I—I did a lot of stuff with Darman legislatively and got pretty involved in all the substance of it. When I moved over to the other job, most of what got done legislatively was done by Grady and me and Bill Diefenderfer. When I first went over—and I don’t like dumping on other people—when I first started doing legislative stuff, Bill Diefenderfer was the deputy, was doing the tax stuff. Grady was very good at doing the environmental and energy stuff. The woman who did all the health and human resources was just not very good and didn’t understand the Hill. So even though I was running legislative affairs, I immediately got stuck doing RBRVS, welfare, and anything to do with welfare, education, and health. She didn’t know what was going on the Hill, so I immediately got into that kind of stuff, so even though she left when I took that job, it really wasn’t a big change. I was doing it all along anyway.\n\nGrady did his own legislative affairs. He negotiated the Clean Air Act. I never got involved in that at all. The people who knew the associate directors and the substance—if they were good, because that’s what Darman wanted—were on the Hill six hours a day. I was on the Hill two-thirds of the time.\n\nStrong\n\nWhat was the coordination between what you were doing and the White House, legislative liaison staff?\n\nScully\n\nVery coordinated. I’d go to Fred’s [McClure] staff meetings, but the difference was really the substance. The way us legislative guys—all of them were good friends of mine, and I still spend a lot of time with them. Shawn Smeallie was my deputy, went over to work for Fred. They were vote counters. They rarely got on the substance. I’d get involved in the childcare or the Medicare stuff before it ever went to a subcommittee, before it went to a committee, and get the drafting and the substance and then work all the way up through the committee. They basically were lobbying whatever votes were on the House and Senate floor and they rarely got into detailed policy. We did the policy side and they basically would go around and if you were trying to do a capital gains tax cut or pass the Clean Air Act and you needed 51 votes, they would count the vote and work with the leadership to make sure you got the votes.\n\nThey basically monitored the House and Senate floor and if you knew a Congressman or a Senator was upset about something or needed something from the White House, they were the liaison, but they rarely got into policy detail. Very rarely. There were some guys, like Al Simpson’s former chief of staff, Boyd Hollingsworth, was on the staff, so if you had something where Al Simpson was very involved, you usually got Boyd involved. Whereas Shawn was [Alfonse] D’Amato’s guy for years. Nobody liked dealing with D’Amato, so when you had to deal with D’Amato on defense issues, because Shawn knew a lot about defense, you might get him involved, but usually they were vote counters.\n\nIf you had to get involved in the detailed substance, you usually got involved with the agency people, so I did a lot of work with HCFA [Health Care Financing Administration] and HHS [Health and Human Services]. If we had to get physicians pay reform through a House vote at the last stage, you’d get involved with the White House legislative guys. You might tell them what’s going on, but I’d probably do seven or eight months of work with the departments to get the policy done and through the committees before it ever got to floor vote. Does that make sense?\n\nYoung\n\nBut during the process, when they were set loose and during their vote counting and so forth, you weren’t out of it that time, were you, on the substance? Because there would be negotiations or something you’d have to work out?\n\nScully\n\nThey would get to the point where you were on the floor with some compromise.\n\nYoung\n\nYou would have to be, wouldn’t you, in some of the tactics?\n\nScully\n\nOh, yes. I spent a lot of time. On the average day, if I got to work at 7: 30 and left at 9:00, I’d probably spent three hours in Gingrich’s office and three hours in Dole’s office hanging out because Gingrich had a little office where everybody worked and Dole had one and they were 50 yards away from each other.\n\nYoung\n\nSo they weren’t involved in negotiations so much when it came to substantive matters with the leaders?\n\nScully\n\nThey’d be involved vote counting and negotiations on who we got to vote for it, and rallying the troops and calling up and making—how do you get 218 votes? They might get in the final vote on the Clean Air Act, but they wouldn’t be involved in negotiating what was in the Clean Air Act, or the childcare bill. Unless—It depends, Nick Calio, who was very good because he was so close to some of the members and had a background, got involved in a lot of tax stuff. Calio was really good, especially in the House. Calio would get involved in a lot of stuff because some people, if they had really wanted to get involved in substance, they could, but they were busy, and the only White House legislative guy who ever really dealt with the serious substance that I worked with was Nick Calio.\n\nYoung\n\nDid you have in your area of policy concerns more or less a charter from Darman? Or did he always look over your shoulder?\n\nScully\n\nNo. He’d give a very free hand—until you screwed up. Yes, he basically said I had four departments and anything that fell in those four departments I could pretty much do whatever I wanted. But my leverage to get a lot of stuff done was the perception of the departments on the Hill that I could get whatever I said. I was a 31-year-old punk at the time, so the presumption and ability to get things done was the perception that I’d call back and get Sununu and Darman to back me up and the President to back me up. Otherwise it wouldn’t make any difference. But if someone came up from HHS and wanted to negotiate something, most members of Congress knew that it wasn’t necessarily going to be the final administration position. After a while if you come up again and again and you say, “We’re going to do x, y and z,” and they find out that you are actually going to deliver, then members start to deal with you. They start understanding and cut deals with you and work things out.\n\nYoung\n\nYou said a moment ago that you worked a lot with the departmental agency people. Why?\n\nScully\n\nWell, because they had the really detailed substance and lot of people on the Hill. The departments usually had a lot of career civil servants, so if you were dealing with Medicare, which was my biggest issue, or Medicaid, and you were dealing with the Ways and Means Committee of the Commerce Committee, all the committee had longstanding ties with the departments. So you’d tell them one thing, but if they would call up HHS or HCFA and find out something else from many years of working with them, it made your life a lot easier if you had the agencies with you and it made their life easier because I had the White House with me.\n\nYoung\n\nWas that ever a problem, getting the agencies—?\n\nScully\n\nEvery agency was different. Gail Wilensky, who was the HCFA administrator under Bush, was terrific and was a very good friend of mine. I did all kinds of stuff with her. Lou Sullivan is a nice man but had an unbelievably bureaucratic setup and became completely irrelevant. Lou Sullivan was Secretary of HHS. He had a very bureaucratic staff and they never got anything done. The subset agency under HHS that ran Medicare and Medicaid was HCFA. The woman who ran that was tremendous, so I basically just got the position every time I was doing this where I basically ignored Sullivan’s office, which drove him crazy, and I always dealt with Gail Wilensky. Gail and I did a lot of deals together. It used to drive Sullivan and his staff nuts because we just cut them out. I don’t think Lou Sullivan set foot in the White House more than three times in four years.\n\nYoung\n\nDid you ever encounter a situation where there was nobody that you really could work effectively with on an issue in a department?\n\nScully\n\nYes. Lauro Cavazos, who was a disaster.\n\nYoung\n\nOn education, until Lamar Alexander?\n\nScully\n\nAnd Lamar Alexander was great. Lamar’s a great guy.\n\nYoung\n\nSo what did you do then?\n\nScully\n\nWell, Roger became the Secretary of Education.\n\nMasoud\n\nWhat was it about Cavazos that made him a disaster?\n\nScully\n\nHe didn’t show up for work. He didn’t know what he was talking about. If you wanted to get hold of him, you had to call him between 10: 00 or 2: 00 or he wasn’t there. He just wasn’t engaged. He didn’t understand the issues. He didn’t know—I mean, how he ever got the job is beyond me. I think I was pretty cruel to him. I don’t remember. He was a nice enough guy, but he just didn’t have any business being there. He didn’t know what he was doing. Was Cavazos invited to the Charlottesville summit? If you checked, I’ll bet he might have been here. Roger really liked education. The President liked education. It was a good PR issue. There really wasn’t that much meat there.\n\nDarman didn’t care about it. He wanted Roger to go do his thing. And Roger spent 90 percent of his time on education and there was a void there because Cavazos was a total empty suit and was totally disengaged, so Roger became the education czar and the Governors were interested in it. It was a great PR issue and unfortunately I don’t think there was a lot of real meat there, but the first two years there was a lot of stuff done on education and Lauro Cavazos was rarely if ever involved. Fortunately he had a deputy, a guy named Ted Sanders who was great, or we would have been in big trouble.\n\nMasoud\n\nSo when you would do work on education, you would be working with Porter?\n\nScully\n\nYes. Any time I’d be working on education—\n\nMasoud\n\nSo Darman didn’t really care about what you were doing?\n\nScully\n\nI worked with Roger a lot and Roger and I are friends. I like Roger a lot. The only problem with Roger was Roger was not mean enough or tough enough. And Darman took advantage of it. I think if you asked Roger what were his real accomplishments in the administration, one through nine would probably be education because he didn’t get that involved in other stuff. So he filled that void. Roger effectively was the Secretary of Education and I had the education funding, so I wrote the budget for it. I worked with Roger a lot. Roger had two staff and I had 15 or 20 education staff, so effectively most of Roger’s stuff, the paper that he delivered was usually written by Barry White, who was the chief OMB staff guy—still is— and most of it was cranked out by Barry. So on education basically OMB was subsumed under Roger’s operation, and that was conscious. It was fine and that was OK and everything else he was totally cut out.\n\nMasoud\n\nAnd what about when Lamar Alexander comes in? Do things change in the way education policy is made?\n\nScully\n\nYes.\n\nMasoud\n\nRoger’s less important now?\n\nScully\n\nLamar became much more dominant, because Lamar was an effective spokesman and effective Secretary and had a lot of ideas and was out there pushing things.\n\nMasoud\n\nSo that’s who you started working with then on education?\n\nScully\n\nI worked with both of them, but I worked a lot more with Lamar, because Lamar was good and Lamar also understood that OMB was—In Republican administration, OMB tends to be much more powerful because the White House usually wants to sit on the agencies and control them, and my perception of the Democrat administrations is the agencies get a much longer leash.\n\nLamar is a really nice guy, and from the very beginning he thought his staff on education was very weak. He knew that the OMB staff was very good and Barry White, who’d been there for years, was so good that Roger and I actually literally lent the chief guy on education at OMB to Lamar to work on his staff for probably six or eight months. He literally moved over to education for a while. I went over and met with Lamar once or twice a week and knew everything he was doing and he knew what we were doing and it was a very good, very upbeat, positive partnership.\n\nMasoud\n\nAnd Porter didn’t put a fight or anything?\n\nScully\n\nNo. Roger doesn’t put up fights. Roger couldn’t be a nicer guy. Roger was happy. I’m not saying it’s the most effective way you get things done, but Roger’s attitude was great, “We’ve got a great new Secretary of Education, it’s wonderful, he’s going to help.” Roger doesn’t look at it as his turf is being invaded, but the fact is Roger became less dominant in the education policy world as Lamar got stronger.\n\nShreve\n\nWas part of the problem as well related to the extent of federal involvement in that field? In other words, perhaps you lacked the institutional knowledge there that you had, say, with health care. An organization like HCFA that had day-to-day responsibilities?\n\nScully\n\nI don’t know what the number is now, but back then the federal government’s spending portion of education was like 7 or 8 percent. There was just not that much leverage, and health care, every hospital, every doctor, gets 55 percent of their money from the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid, and if you count other programs, it’s more. The federal government dominates health care policy and everything follows along.\n\nEducation is the opposite. Your ability to legislate is limited because [Gus] Hawkins was the Chairman of the House Committee and a very liberal guy, and Ted Kennedy was the Chairman of the Senate Committee, and they were nice and we worked them a lot, but they weren’t going to change Chapter I. They weren’t going to put in education vouchers, so you could come up with national goals with the Governors, which we did, and you could talk about vouchers and other things or targeting Chapter I to different places, but the reality is most of that stuff wasn’t going to pass, so"
