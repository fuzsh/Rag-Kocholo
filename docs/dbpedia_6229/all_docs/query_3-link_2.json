        "text": "Australian politician\n\nFrancis Raymond Scully (27 January 1920 â€“ 12 August 2015), Australian politician, from 1949 was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the electoral district of Richmond representing the Labor Party to March 1955.[1] He was Assistant Minister of Lands, Assistant Minister of Electrical Undertakings in the third Cain government from 1952 to 1955. He was a member of the Catholic Social Studies Movement (\"The Movement\") in Victoria, and was expelled from the ministry and the ALP as part of the Australian Labor Party split of 1955.[1] He then was a member of the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) (and then the Democratic Labor Party) from 1955 to 1958. Scully was the only member of the DLP in the lower house of the Victorian parliament during these three years.[2]\n\nScully was a railway worker, and was active in the Australian Railways Union Industrial Group.[3] Scully was defeated at the 1958 elections[4] and subsequently owned a news-agency in Sandringham, Victoria.[5] He died in 2015 at the age of 95.[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
