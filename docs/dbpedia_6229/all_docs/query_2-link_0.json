For the Australian rules footballer, see Frank Scully (footballer).\n\nFrancis Joseph Xavier Scully; (April 28, 1892 – June 23, 1964)[1][4] was an American journalist, author, humorist, and a regular columnist for the entertainment trade magazine Variety.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nScully studied journalism at Columbia University, was on the reporting staff at The New York Sun and was a contributor to Variety.[5] His books include Rogues' Gallery[6] and Fun In Bed: The Convalescent's Handbook.[7] Scully received screenwriting credit for the American version of the film Une fée... pas comme les autres (The Secret of Magic Island).[8]\n\nScully publicized the Aztec, New Mexico UFO hoax when, in 1949, he wrote two columns in Variety claiming that dead extraterrestrial beings were recovered from a flying saucer crash.[10]\n\nScully's 1950 book Behind the Flying Saucers expanded on the themes of flying saucer crashes and dead extraterrestrials, with Scully describing one of his sources as having \"more degrees than a thermometer\".[11] In that book, he promoted the pseudohistorical claims of Paxson Hayes that prehistoric giants inhabited the Americas.[12]\n\nIn 1952 and 1956, True magazine published articles by the San Francisco Chronicle reporter John Philip Cahn[13] that purported to expose Scully's sources as confidence tricksters who had hoaxed Scully.[14] Scully's 1963 book, In Armour Bright, also included material about alleged flying saucer crashes and dead extraterrestrials.[15]\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks\n\n[edit]\n\nScully, Frank (1932).
