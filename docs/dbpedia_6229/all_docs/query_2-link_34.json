        "text": "Softcover. Quarto. 9.5\" x 11.5\". Brad bound manilla folder with typed title label. 91 leaves typed rectos only (p.2-92), mostly ribbon (or top) copies, with eight press photographs of Jack Dempsey participating in fights organized by Rickard including bouts against Firpo and Willard. Some corrections in pencil, mostly editorial in nature. Tears at the edges of the folder and near very good, internally near fine. A couple of modest chips on the photographs, but most are near fine, and most have credits to *The Ring* magazine notices on the verso.\n\nRickard was a larger than life figure best known for his fight promoting which included the legendary \"Great White Hope\" fight between Jack Johnson and James J. Jeffries, as well as the \"Long Count\" fight between Gene Tunney and Dempsey. He was also responsible for rebuilding Madison Square Garden, and founding the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League. This long biographical sketch was eventually published serially in *The American Sports Magazine* in 1937, but doesn't appear to have been published as a book.\n\nItem #444648"
