        "text": "On a day which remembers those who served their country and put others ahead of themselves, a quick reminder to all politicians that you are in public service... Your role is to make the best decisions, and take the actions, which give us a better society. Morally better Ethically better Economically better Mentally and physically better It isn't to make the decisions, and take the actions, which will make your party members like you more and give you a bigger, more important role which satisfies that out of control ego of yours. If you take anything from today, it should be to understand what is possible when ordinary people put others above themselves. And you are just ordinary people. #BeTheGOAT of #PublicService #Remembrance #Gratitude #Service PS It would be easy to assume this post is about a specific person or party but I assure you it isn't. It's all politicians, no matter what their political allegiance.\n\nIn times of division and unrest we must remember it's not the people at grassroots who are at fault. The issues we face stem from those at the top ‚Äì the government and systemic structures. We‚Äôre all tired. Police officers, minorities, and every single person are navigating a tough landscape. But let‚Äôs remember: ¬∑ Not all white individuals are bad. ¬∑ Not all minorities are bad. ¬∑ Not all police officers are bad. We must stop using the victim card and focus on unity. Our goal is not to place blame but to understand and uplift each other. So, I challenge you to: ¬∑ Spread kindness: send a caring message to your colleagues who strive for a better world. ¬∑ Show appreciation: send a thank you card to your local police station. ¬∑ Break the cycle: instead of chronic complaining, choose positivity and proactive solutions. We need radical humanists who see beyond politics and religion, who understand every perspective, and who work towards ending this cycle of negativity. Let‚Äôs foster understanding, kindness, and unity. We‚Äôre all in this together. #OneHumanity #SpreadKindness #UnityOverDivision Assa Samak√©-Roman FRSA Niharika Noakes FRSA Richard Moore James Finnie Sam Anderson Tariq Ali Gael Drummond Neil McLean Michelle Sutherland Jamie Cooke Dawn Evans\n\nYou know, I read these paranoid patriot posts, and their equally patriotic and paranoid responses, here every day, and the overwhelming emotions I get are FEAR and ANGER. Okay, so there are things about our government to get angry about... you pick... you fill in the blank. You're angry with Democrats, you're angry with Republicans, you're angry with the power that you think is in the hands of those with whom you disagree. You want women, indeed yourself, to have freedom of choice about abortion, or you don't. You things are going wrong, or you don't. You can get angry about all these things, but you're not a child, and you can control your anger. FEAR is another thing. I read so many posts that speak of fear. What, exactly, are you afraid of? Are you a criminal? If so, fear the courts. But you're a nobody, just like me. I never feared the government, no matter how loud I shouted. No prosecutor ever came after me. No government employee ever broke down my door to jail me without due process (or any other way). Nobody I know was ever abused by the federal government, a school board official, a health inspector, or anyone else... except maybe a local cop. Oh, I know there are haters out there, but they stick to themselves, mostly. The LinkedIn patriots who speak of federal fear are speaking on a public outlet, revealing their bio's and their photos. Wow, to speak of fearing the government and telling everyone who you are seems kinda stoopid, no? I've worked overseas in places where our spoiled-child sense of liberty and freedom gets us in trouble. We can whine and moan and yell at our government here. Fear? Just what are you afraid of? #management #politics #patriotism #federalgovernment\n\nI wish more people who support Trump, and who have voted for him, would come out of the closet. The people who support leftism are generally moral cowards. They cannot lose respect for you, because they do not respect themselves. To actually agree with the insanity of socialism, to say nothing of all the literally psychopathic \"woke\" add ons, betrays a red flag for all kinds of deep-seated problems. You don't need or want the esteem of people who suffer from self-loathing. As for losing business to Democrats, large numbers of these leftists either have little money, or are living as parasites off others (family, more rational spouses, government \"jobs\" or corporate or literal government handouts). And don't underestimate the business you gain by making deeper and more loyal connections, especially in what are becoming truly troubled times. Kind of like throwing water on the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz, you might not create the explosion you anticipate by letting your loudmouth, know-nothing brethren see that you have an independent, functioning mind. Laugh at their insults, because errors have no potency and insults and threats only reveal the deep insecurities and vulnerability of people you are better off without.\n\nEmpower Yourself: The Pitfalls of Surrendering Control to Politicians In a world where political decisions shape the course of nations, it's crucial to recognize the risks of ceding too much power over your life to politicians. While elected officials play a vital role in governance, entrusting them with absolute control can have detrimental consequences for individual autonomy. Politicians, driven by diverse ideologies and interests, may not always align with your personal values or aspirations. Relying on them to dictate the trajectory of your life can lead to disillusionment and frustration when their decisions diverge from your expectations. Instead of surrendering agency, consider engaging in civic participation and staying informed. By actively participating in the democratic process, you can influence policies that directly impact your life and community. Remember, your voice matters, and by being an informed and engaged citizen, you can contribute to shaping a society that reflects your values. Ultimately, the key lies in maintaining a balance between respecting the role of politicians and safeguarding your own autonomy. Never allow anyone, regardless of their political position, to hold unchecked power over the direction of your life.\n\nIn the realm of social justice, there are a few changes that Alan Jenkins would like to see. üèõÔ∏è One of the most pressing issues he highlights is the lack of accountability among politicians who participated in the events of May 18th at the Capitol. While many of the rioters have faced legal consequences, the politicians involved have largely escaped any form of responsibility. üö´ But when Jenkins speaks of accountability, he isn't necessarily advocating for imprisonment. Instead, he calls for these individuals to be held responsible within the political process itself. He believes there should be an acknowledgment of their actions and a recognition of their responsibility. üìú Repost this video if you believe in holding politicians accountable for their actions and want to see changes in our social justice system. #SocialJustice #CapitolRiotsAccountability #14thAmendment"
