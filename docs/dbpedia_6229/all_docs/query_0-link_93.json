W. J. Aston) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers.\n\npage 651\n\nAID TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\n\nPetition\n\nMr GILES presented a petition from certain citizens of Australia praying that the Australian Government set 1% of the gross national product as the target for the annual allocation of aid to the developing countries.\n\nPetition received and read.\n\npage 651\n\nQUESTION\n\nSOCIAL SERVICE BENEFITS\n\nMr MINOGUE:\n\nWEST SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I address a question to the Treasurer. In view of the estimated expenditure this year of $6,500m, will the Treasurer make an effort to find another $40m to enable an additional $1 per week to be granted to all pensioners? Requests for justice for the pensioners have been made by myself and other honourable members on both sides of the House during the Budget debate but have fallen on deaf ears. I again ask for a rise for all pensioners. If the answer is no, I sincerely hope the electors will remember this at the House of Representatives and Senate elections later this year.\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nTreasurer · LOWE, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– This is the third time a somewhat similar question has been asked in this House.\n\nMr Griffiths:\n\n– It will be asked many more times, too.\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\n– Opposition members may keep on asking; that is their prerogative. I have pointed out on at least two occasions what the objectives of the Government were when it presented the Budget. Our aim then was to ensure that we had a healthy economy and that we also had a progressive economy. I pointed out that the people to whom we thought we could give most assistance on this occasion were those who had not received assistance in Budgets for some time and in some cases not since 1958. Of course, we realise that pensioners deserve the utmost consideration, but I am sure that when the debate on social services takes place it will be mentioned that in the course of the last three or four years, whilst prices have risen by about 11%, assistance to the single pensioner, for instance, has risen by about 24%. So we do keep these matters in mind. One of the first problems we consider in the discussion of any Budget is what should be done in the interests of the base rate pensioner.\n\npage 651\n\nQUESTION\n\nPOSTAL RATES\n\nMr WILSON:\n\nSTURT, SOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\n– I direct a question to the Postmaster-General. Does it cost British migrants and other residents of this country with friends and relations in the United Kingdom more to send a tape recorded message to the United Kingdom than the addressee pays under what is known as the United Kingdom phonopost rate to send a similar message to Australia in reply?\n\nMr HULME:\n\nPostmaster-General · PETRIE, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– -Phonopost is an international mailing service for the transmission of recordings on wire, tape or disc. I will give an illustration of the rate of postage. An article weighing up to 3 oz would cost approximately 70c between Australia and the United Kingdom as against the normal airmail rate for recordings of $1.50 at present. A change to bring about a reduction in the rate was included in the legislation that was rejected by the Senate and I know that in the period between 1st July and 1st October heavy additional cost will be borne by migrants who want to send messages overseas by this means.\n\npage 651\n\nQUESTION\n\nBROADCASTS FROM CHINA\n\nMr BENSON:\n\nBATMAN, VICTORIA\n\n– I address my question to the Minister for External Affairs. He will recall that last Tuesday week I communicated with him about broadcasts that were directed from Peking to Hong Kong in both English and Chinese and about letters and cables that were reported to have been sent by responsible organisations from Australia to the Governor of Hong Kong. Has the Minister checked with Australian authorities in Hong Kong? Were letters and other messages sent to the Governor of Hong Kong? Did Peking make any broadcast to Hong Kong and say that the messages were from responsible organisations in Australia? Was there any difference between the messages sent to the Governor of Hong Kong and the broadcast from Peking? Is the Minister able to say who sent the messages? Will he assure both the Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Governments of Australia’s loyalty to their people?\n\nMr HASLUCK:\n\nMinister for External Affairs · CURTIN, WESTERN AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n– I recall that the honourable gentleman drew my attention to a broadcast that had been made by Radio Peking. We had also in the normal course of events through a monitoring service received a copy of that same broadcast. It was broadcast on 8th August on the Peking international service in both English and Chinese. It carried a Melbourne date line and the character of the broadcast is indicated by the opening phrase, which is:\n\nMelbourne, August 8th. Responsible officials ot more than twenty Victorian and Federal trade unions have strongly denounced the British Fascist atrocities against Chinese patriots in Hong Kong.\n\nThen other matter followed. I can assure the honourable member that the matter which followed was a fair representation of the petition that had been sent by these Australian trade unions to Hong Kong.\n\nThe inquiries that we made showed that on 4th August a petition was sent to the Governor of Hong Kong from Melbourne. Apparently the framers of this petition thought that it was in their interests to ensure that Peking knew of the nature of the petition that they were sending, because Peking rapidly became aware of the action they had taken in sending the message to Hong Kong. Of course, Peking made use of it. The fact that Radio Peking made use of it as part of a campaign of incitement and hate which has accompanied all the recent troubles in Hong Kong indicates, and is prima facie evidence, that the views expressed by the petitioners . were views thoroughly acceptable to the Communist Government of Peking.\n\nI will read to the House the letter received by the Governor from the State Secretary of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation. It begins: ‘The Australian Builders Labourers Federation, Victorian Branch, 11 Lygon Street, Carlton, Box 14, Trades Hall, Melbourne.’ It is dated 4th August 1967 and is addressed to the Governor. It reads:\n\nI wish to advise that members of various trade unions here in Australia are deeply concerned at the authorities allowing the trade union dispute to develop into e bloody incident resulting in brutal attacks on trade unionists, journalists, students and other Hong Kong citizens. This concern has been expressed in a petition signed by leaders of twenty-seven trade unions. I am enclosing the petition signed by the leaden of these trade unions and would hope that you would give serious consideration to their views expressed in the petition.\n\nThe terms of the petition were a call on the British authorities to immediately stop all Fascist measures; to immediately set free all arrested persons, including workers, journalists, etc.; to punish those responsible for the atrocities - that is, the alleged atrocities committed by the British - and to compensate the victims for their sufferings and losses; and to guarantee against reoccurrence of similar incidents. The names follow.\n\nI think it will be a matter of considerable interest to all members of trade unions to establish to their own satisfaction whether these persons who were described as leaders of Australian trade unions, and who in the Peking broadcast were referred to as responsible officials of trade unions in Australia, acted with the authority of the unions or whether they acted as persons taking a line which can only be described as a thoroughly Communist line. It is for that reason that I will read out, so far as one can decipher them from the list of signatures, not the names of the persons - that is a matter that I would not want to embark on personally at this stage - but the names of the unions which were claimed to be represented through the mouths of these so-called responsible officials as having supported this Communist view.\n\nThe unions are concerned with the following: Painters, Clothing Trades, Postal Workers, Transport Workers, Sheet Metal Workers, Leather Trades, Federated Engine Drivers, Miscellaneous Workers, Meat Workers, Plumbers, Victorian Plasterers Society, Painters and Decorators, Seamen’s, Shipwrights, Furniture Factories, Tramways, Waterside Workers Federation, Builders Labourers, Australian Railways, Boilermakers and liquor trades. I think it is of interest to members of those unions to know what it is that their so-called responsible officials are supporting, and it is a matter for consideration by them whether they themselves support these views. We have to examine the aims.\n\nThe aims of what has been happening in Hong Kong are clearly the aims of Peking Communism which have since been expressed in even more serious demonstrations against British authority and which are directed at disrupting and perhaps overthrowing British authority in Hong Kong. Perhaps even more serious than the aims is the need for Australian trade unionists to consider the methods which have included the killing of children, the throwing of bombs, the murder of innocent people, the methods of terrorism and the preparation in depth of what can only be described as fortified arsenals of weapons, prepared positions, and in general the conducting within Hong Kong, not only against the British authorities but against the Chinese inhabitants ot Hong Kong, of something that can only be described as guerrilla warfare in an urban setting. This is the sort of thing which these so-called responsible leaders of Federal and Victorian trade unions claim to be supporting in the name of their members.\n\npage 653\n\nQUESTION\n\nTELEVISION\n\nMr IRWIN:\n\nMITCHELL, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– My question is directed to the Postmaster-General. Is he aware that some people interviewed on the television programme ‘Four Corners’ have been dissatisfied with the presentation of the interview? Under the present setup, portion of the replies can be deleted and the questions can be altered to give a different slant to the replies. Will the Postmaster-General consider the advisability and the desirability of requesting the Australian Broadcasting Commission to impound original tapes for, say, one week after presentation?\n\nMr HULME:\n\nLP\n\n– I would be very surprised and indeed disappointed if there was a shortening of answers to questions on the Four Corners’ programme or substitution in the questions to which answers were given. I shall be pleased to take this matter up with the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I will ask whether he will perhaps ensure that the original tapes are kept for a period after presentation of the programme so if there are any complaints from those who have been interviewed we may be able to investigate and ascertain whether the complaints are genuine.\n\npage 653\n\nQUESTION\n\nROADS\n\nMr LUCHETTI:\n\nMACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I ask the Treasurer a question. Because of the importance of maintaining and upgrading country roads throughout Australia, will he assure the House that the distribution of the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement funds will not be disturbed to the detriment of our country development and districts? In view of the increased receipts from petrol tax, is the Treasurer in a position to announce a considerably increased vote for road construction and reconstruction this year and during the next 2 years?\n\nMr MCMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– ‘The House will be aware that the current Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement continues for a period of over 5 years and that the agreement provides that there shall be a minimum proportion given for rural roads. There is no intention whatsoever on the part of this Government to attempt to change that proportion. It will remain as far as we are concerned. As to the second part of the honourable gentleman’s question, in the Budget Speech I mentioned the substantially increased allocation of funds under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement. I cannot remember the figure at the moment but I will extract it from the Budget Speech and will let the honourable gentleman have details. As to the future I cannot be precise, but anyone who follows the trend of events in this country and believes in its future must recognise that it follows that there will again be a substantial increase in the amount of funds allocated under the Act next year and it is hoped there will be the same sort of increase in the year after.\n\nLater:\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– The increase in the amount provided under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement was from $l50m to $160m last year as compared with this year. As well, we are increasing the vote for beef roads by $45,000, so that honourable members will see that there is a very substantial increase in the two amounts for the construction of roads in this country.\n\npage 653\n\nQUESTION\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT\n\nMr KATTER:\n\nKENNEDY, QUEENSLAND\n\n– Will the Minister for Labour and National Service indicate whether his Department, in its endeavours to unearth and control causes contributing to unemployment, has examined the situation in England with its ‘clouds of disaster’, as the Press yesterday so effectively described the critical unemployment position there, and also the current and regrettable rise in unemployment in our own States of Tasmania and South Australia, to ascertain what factors are contributing to this situation?\n\nMr BURY:\n\nMinister for Labour and National Service · WENTWORTH, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– My Department does, of course, conduct a great deal of research into these questions. We are constantly on the lookout for first class research officers who are equipped to tackle the problems involved. They are, however, in short supply and difficult to obtain. Most of our research in the United Kingdom is into specific matters that have a bearing on particular ad hoc problems in Australia. Naturally our research is mainly focused on Australia, but unemployment, in reality, is an end product of the workings of the economy. The general level of employment depends in large part, although by no means wholly, on economic policy. Results are influenced by the kind of atmosphere created by governments - whether they seek to promote business and enterprise or whether they rather tend to handicap them and place undue burdens on their workings.\n\nMr Bryant:\n\n– Is the Minister making an attack on the British Government?\n\nMr BURY:\n\n– Since the honourable member invites me to comment on the British situation, all I can say is that I read about these matters, as do most honourable members. I noticed 3 years ago that the policy was to be adopted of bringing a modern Britain into being - there was to be a technological revolution for this purpose and it was to proceed, it was said, at white hot pace. The present situation there is well known.\n\nMr Peters:\n\n– Why is the Minister attacking the Mother Country?\n\nMr BURY:\n\n– I do not know whether the Mother Country originally spawned the ancestors of the honourable member, but he is always heard. South Australia, until about 3 years ago, had, apart from Western Australia, the fastest growth rate in the Commonwealth, but this is no longer the case. Perhaps Tasmania’s potential development is higher than is being achieved but, from a policy point of view, anyone can look at the Governments concerned and their performances over a period and draw his own conclusions.\n\npage 654\n\nQUESTION\n\nINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nMr SCHOLES:\n\nCORIO, VICTORIA\n\n– Is the Minister for Labour and National Service aware that in the Geelong area there is a major industrial centre? Has the Minister received any requests from that area for the appointment of a full time arbitration inspector? Is the Minister aware that because of the limited availability of an inspector in that area employees are not receiving proper coverage? Does the Minister agree that it is proper that union officials should be carrying out functions that properly belong to officers of his department?\n\nMr BURY:\n\nLP\n\n– I have received representations and I have gone into them carefully. Compared with the rest of Victoria, Geelong and its area are well covered on a pro rata basis. Visits by arbitration inspectors are sample or surprise inspections. The effectiveness of the inspection service is that an inspector is apt to drop in at any time. If we were to inspect all the factories and premises working under Commonwealth awards every few weeks we would need to employ a vast army of people to do so, but we do get co-operation from many other quarters of which the honourable member will be well aware. We rely very much on reciprocal arrangements in some States and would like to rely even more by extending them to other State inspection services. I informed those who made the representations that I did not consider it appropriate to appoint additional persons to carry out this work at present.\n\npage 654\n\nQUESTION\n\nSMUGGLING OF DRUGS\n\nMr LEE:\n\nLALOR, VICTORIA\n\n– I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise. I understand that the nature of the Sydney waterfront presents difficulties in the control of smuggling. In view of the reported growth of drug addiction in that city can the Minister assure the House, firstly, that there is sufficient control over people who would be able to bring small packages ashore from the many ships which tie up around the harbour; secondly, that there are adequate customs checks of aircraft and air crews moving in and out of Australia; and, thirdly, that penalties are sufficiently severe to make it widely known throughout the world that it is most unprofitable to attempt to bring dangerous drugs into this country?\n\nMr HOWSON:\n\nMinister Assisting the Treasurer · FAWKNER, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– I am sure that the honourable member knows that in the last session this House passed an Act to increase considerably the penalties for the smuggling of drugs into this country, indicating that the Parliament is aware of this practice and that it is seriously setting about the devising of means to deal with it. Generally I think the Department of Customs and Excise has the matter of smuggling on the waterfront under control. However, I shall refer this question to my colleague in another place and get a more detailed answer for the honourable member.\n\npage 655\n\nQUESTION\n\nWOOL AND WHEAT PRICES\n\nMr WEBB:\n\nSTIRLING, WESTERN AUSTRALIA\n\n– Has the Treasurer seen a statement by Sir William Gunn that the effect which the continued drop in wool prices would have on Australia was not widely appreciated? Is it a fact that recent falls overall have been more than 10%? Will he say what effect this is likely to have on our economy? Was this fall in wool prices, as well as the fall in wheat prices, anticipated when the Budget was passed?\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– If the honourable member remembers the Budget Speech delivered a few nights ago in this House, he will recall that I specifically drew attention to the difficult position in which the wool industry found itself. I think I can say that we in the Treasury did think that the wool market could be weak. No-one would hazard too confident a forecast of the extent to which wool prices would in fact fall. First class wools have fallen by about 71/2% and lower quality grades have fallen by 10%, 121/2% and even 15%. I know that this must have an impact on the economy. To some extent it will be offset in terms of foreign exchange, but only in terms of foreign exchange, because there will be a substantial increase in the export of metals and other commodities. Nonetheless this is a matter that requires our most careful thought. As to wheat prices, I was surprised to see that the price of wheat has fallen slightly during the course of the last 3 months. This is another matter that requires the constant attention of the Government but it is something over which we ourselves cannot exert a direct influence.\n\npage 655\n\nQUESTION\n\nSOCIAL SERVICES\n\nMr Donald Cameron:\n\nGRIFFITH, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– In direct ing a question to the Minister for Social Services I refer to my address to this House in the Budget debate on Tuesday night in which I applauded the Government for recognising in the 1967-68 Budget the plight of deserted wives and wives of prisoners. As all honourable members know the responsibility is now in the hands of the States to present a scheme in a format acceptable to the Commonwealth. I now ask the Minister whether everything possible is being done to ensure that such a scheme is presented so that the plight of these women and their children can be relieved as soon as possible.\n\nMr SINCLAIR:\n\nMinister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry · NEW ENGLAND, NEW SOUTH WALES · CP\n\n– The honourable member raised this matter in his speech on the Budget on Tuesday night, I understand. As the House will be aware the Treasurer, in the Budget Speech, announced that discussions between the Commonwealth and the States would be held to determine the way in which assistance could be given to the States to provide for deserted wives and wives of prisoners in the first six months before they become entitled to widows pensions. These discussions are being pursued and it is hoped that shortly it will be possible for the Commonwealth to proceed with the plan that was announced by the Treasurer. There is no doubt that this is yet another area within which the Commonwealth once again is initiating a very notable advance in the provision of assistance for needy members of the Australian community.\n\npage 655\n\nQUESTION\n\nSONIC BOOMS\n\nMr COPE:\n\nWATSON, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I wish to ask the Minister for Civil Aviation a question. No doubt he is aware of a Press report stating that in England recently a lady, while using a toilet facility and serenely working out a crossword puzzle, was suddenly thrown to the floor by the sonic boom of a supersonic aircraft passing overhead. I ask whether the Minister, in advance of the introduction of supersonic commercial aircraft in Australia, has considered the suggestion that householders in the vicinity of the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in my electorate be issued with seat belts.\n\nMr SWARTZ:\n\nMinister for Civil Aviation · DARLING DOWNS, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– I know that this is a problem that concerns the honourable member in many ways. Some experiments are being conducted in the United Kingdom at present in an attempt, before the introduction of supersonic commercial aircraft here, to assess the problems associated with sonic booms. I cannot recall the particular incident to which the honourable member refers, but I have seen official reports of the effects of sonic booms that perhaps do not go into such great detail. I can assure him that we are keeping very closely in touch with the situation and are receiving regular reports from the United Kingdom. When any other interesting information is available I shall see that the House is informed.\n\npage 656\n\nQUESTION\n\nBUILDING TRADESMEN IN HOBART AREA\n\nMr GIBSON:\n\nDENISON, TASMANIA\n\n– I direct my question to the Minister for Labour and National Service. Can he say what the current position is in the supply of building tradesmen in the Hobart area where they are urgently needed for the rebuilding of homes destroyed in the recent fires? What steps has his Department taken to ensure that the additional tradesmen required are in fact forthcoming?\n\nMr BURY:\n\nLP\n\n– I am happy to assure the honourable member that the most recent reports I have received indicate that the home building situation in Hobart is satisfactory. I know that the honourable member has been in close contact with me about this matter for a long time. Since it concerns his own electorate this is readily understandable. As to the steps that have been taken, after the fire occurred we collected all the information that we could and cooperated with the Tasmanian Government and with various firms and trade unions in attracting to Hobart the necessary labour to meet the huge extra demand. We recruited or were instrumental in recruiting quite a number of workers from what is known in Tasmania as the mainland, particularly from New South Wales, from which I think about three-quarters of them came. Quite a number went to Hobart on their own initiative, whether prompted by friends there or by the publicity or by other causes.\n\nAbout a month ago we ceased to take any special steps to recruit. We have, of course, been in close touch with the Building Workers Industrial Union, some members of which became a little concerned that with all the publicity we might in fact produce a labour surplus. Currently we have just over 100 vacancies but’ they are mainly for commercial building or for purposes other than housing. We do have a small excess number of painters registered although usually at this time of the year painting activity falls off. Generally the position now is satisfactory. I think there have been some complaints from various employers about the quality of the labour, but reports of this kind are naturally very difficult to evaluate.\n\nThe honourable member may be interested to. know that there is also another large demand for building labour, or there has been, for the construction work at the Australian newsprint mills. This is a $2 8m project and requires quite a lot of extra labour. The House may be interested to know that we have been responsible for initiating a fairly novel arrangement which involves one firm lending its work force to another firm. Several contractors in Launceston, where building activity has been at a low .ebb although it has picked up lately, have made special arrangements along these lines, and these arrangements have worked well. In the period immediately ahead I think the situation will continue to be satisfactory. It has been helped greatly, as the honourable member knows, by the dry season. This may not have helped the rural community but it has certainly induced rapidity of construction.\n\npage 656\n\nQUESTION\n\nSALES TAX ON SCHOOL REQUISITES\n\nDr PATTERSON:\n\nDAWSON, QUEENSLAND\n\n– I direct a question to the Treasurer. He and other members of the Government have in various ways expressed concern, or apparent concern, for the children of Australia, and I note with some interest the extraordinarily large number of children in the galleries of the Parliament today. Will the Minister take this opportunity of informing the Parliament and the children why in a Budget of some $6,000m, which includes $21m for VIP aircraft, the Government charges the children of Australia 124% sales tax on school exercise books and other essential writing paper for schools, including school pads? I am sure that the Treasurer realises that in most schools slates are considered somewhat archaic.\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– First of all, the honourable member should know, as he pretends to be somewhat of an economic expert, that the money spent on these VIP aircraft, which are used for many purposes, is a capital item and not a current item, and that the aircraft will be in use for many years. They are not used for VIP purposes only. If at the time they were delivered we had had a difficulty of the same nature as confrontation they would have been used directly for Air Force purposes. As to the second part of the honourable gentleman’s question, if he looks at the Budget papers with care he will see that the Commonwealth allocation to the States for assistance in education has gone up by S54m as compared with the expenditure last year. I hope that when he gets on the public platform he will give credit for this very big rise. Although I cannot remember the exact proportion, it is one of the biggest percentage increases in Commonwealth history. So I would hope that when asking questions of this kind the honourable member would at least keep matters in balance. No government has done as much for the education of the young people of this country as has this government. No government will do more. We have plans for the future. One of our main objectives is to see that the young people of this country are properly educated.\n\npage 657\n\nQUESTION\n\nPENSIONS\n\nMr TURNBULL:\n\nMALLEE, VICTORIA\n\n– Will the Minister for Social Services make investigations with a view to ascertaining definitely whether a single pensioner with no means other than -the social services pension is urgently in need of additional financial aid? If the investigation reveals that these people are in such need, will he make a recommendation to the Government urging appropriate action?\n\nMr SINCLAIR:\n\nCP\n\n– There is without doubt a range of need within the Australian community. In some circumstances single pensioners in the situation to which the honourable member has referred find them selves quite adequately able to provide for themselves and to provide the necessaries of life within the Commonwealth provision for social services. In fact, during this week I received a letter from a pensioner who has in her will left an amount to the Commonwealth in return for the contribution that she has received towards her welfare because she feels that it was more than sufficient to meet her requirements. At the other end of the scale there are pensioners who are confronted with difficulties, but these people are not alone in the community. It is extremely difficult in a community such as ours to determine all of the factors because one person can have less than adequate return and another more than adequate return. The needs of different individuals vary. The record of this Government in providing increased benefits for the wellbeing of pensioners is well known. Progressively over the years both the amount of benefit and the range of entitlement have been improved, lt is reasonable to expect that this progress will continue in the future.\n\npage 657\n\nQUESTION\n\nINCOME TAX\n\nMr BARNARD:\n\nBASS, TASMANIA\n\n– I ask the Treasurer a question. Why are donations to overseas voluntary aid organisations not allowed as deductions for income tax purposes? What is the estimated loss of revenue in allowing such donations to be claimed as deductions?\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– We have established a policy that unless there are exceptional circumstances, donations to support philanthropic and other institutions will be allowed as deductions for income tax purposes only if the money is spent internally. This is a good policy to start with. In special cases, such as donations for the Freedom from Hunger Campaign, we did allow the donations to be claimed as deductions for income tax purposes. I cannot recall the precise figure, but I think the total loss to revenue from this source is up to $20m a year. I carried out a review of what would happen in one case - only one case - where people seek to claim deductions in respect of gifts overseas, and the amount came to between $2m and S3m. I put this against the background that our assistance in official foreign aid ranks second only to that provided by France. Our record in this field is very good. If there is to be any criticism it must be against the background that we are devoting almost 0.8% of our total national product to assistance for other countries. We are doing this willingly, freely and without any tags attached. No other country gives as freely as does Australia. No other country gives aid without tags.\n\npage 658\n\nQUESTION\n\nCHEMICAL WARFARE\n\nMr Kevin Cairns:\n\nLILLEY, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– I ask the Minister for External Affairs a question. What evidence exists that the United States of America has developed fungicides for the destruction of rice crops in Asia? Has the Minister any knowledge to suggest that the United States intends to escalate the Vietnam conflict into an anti-personnel chemical and bacteriological war? Will the Minister indicate his attitude towards these matters, as they are the substance of allegations made about the United States last Sunday evening in a radio broadcast delivered by the official foreign affairs commentator of the Queensland Branch of the Australian Labor Party?\n\nMr HASLUCK:\n\nLP\n\n– In the course of operations in Vietnam some defoliation methods are being used in order to strip the foliage from jungle country and reveal emplacements and other prepared positions or the presence of enemy Vietcong in the jungle. I am sure that the greatest care is taken in the use of these defoliation processes. If any damage has resulted to crops it has been accidental and certainly not premeditated. In answer to the general question, I can assure the House that both so far as the United States of America is concerned and so far as the Australian Government is concerned, no form of warfare is being used that is contrary to the international conventions regulating either chemical or bacterial forms of warfare.\n\npage 658\n\nQUESTION\n\nAID FOR NORTH VIETNAM\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I ask the Treasurer a question. How much money has been remitted with the approval of the Reserve Bank of Australia under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations to those organisations in Vietnam which are named in the Defence Force Protection Bill?\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– Nothing to my knowledge has been remitted since the first day it was drawn to my attention that these amounts were being or might perhaps be remitted.\n\npage 658\n\nAPPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1967-68\n\nSecond Reading (Budget Debate)\n\nDebate resumed from 30 August (vide page 641), on motion by Mr McMahon:\n\nThat the Bill be now read a second time.\n\nUpon which Mr Whitlam had moved by way of amendment:\n\nThat all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: ‘this House condemns the Budget because:\n\nit places defence costs on those least able to pay them;\n\nit fails to curb administrative waste and extravagance;\n\nit defers and retrenches development projects; and\n\nit allows social service and war pensioners to fall still further behind their fellow citizens’. ‘\n\nMr BONNETT:\n\nHerbert\n\n– I have three very important reasons for joining in this debate. Firstly, although I have closely studied the amendment to the Budget proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam), I cannot agree with him and I support the Budget as proposed by the Treasurer (Mr McMahon). Secondly, I should like to speak on what is to me a very important aspect of the Government’s defence policy. Thirdly, I should like to offer for consideration a suggestion which I think will assist our age pensioners about whom I feel very strongly. Coming from far north Queensland as I do I have become very interested in reading the southern newspapers and comparing them with Queensland newspapers. Recently I have been amazed and angered at a series of articles published in a Sydney newspaper on the subject of defence. The State of Queensland and especially the people of north Queensland are vitally interested in defence matters.\n\nIn my opinion Queensland newspapers have always presented defence subjects fairly and honestly. When they have criticised the Government’s policy their criticism has been constructive. I have always considered that newspapers are a medium of education and a guide to the members of the general public who seek factual knowledge without distortion. That is why I cannot sit idly by while a Sydney newspaper attacks this Government and the Minister for Defence (Mr Fairhall), for whom I have a great deal of respect, without punching back at its distorted and harmful articles. I consider myself to be a fairly tolerant person, but the articles annoyed me to such an extent that I made quite a few inquiries about the newspaper and discovered an amazing situation.\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order! I point out that the honourable member for Herbert has already spoken during the Budget debate. He spoke on 24th August.\n\nMr GRIFFITHS:\n\nShortland\n\n– I think a colleague from a Melbourne electorate was listed to speak next. As he is not here, I will take his place. Probably at no time in the past two decades has the Press of Australia been so unresponsive to a national budget as it has been to this Budget. Therefore, the amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and which I support becomes all the more important It is recognised that to a very large extent the minds of members of the general public are conditioned by the views expressed in the Press and often the policies of industry are reflected by the Press reports, whether they be for good or bad. This year, the Press has not given such a lead.\n\nWhilst the Budget may appear to many people to be an inoffensive document, it has been cunningly conceived and contains many provisions designed to draw from taxpayers increased revenue in one form or another. I instance air travel charges, navigation charges and postal charges. Only the wealthy and the Government stand to gain very much from the Budget. The Government, as the custodian of the public purse, will certainly gain; the wealthy will Sain from tax concessions, from rising prots and dividends and by participation in subsidy payments or from the increased production of consumer goods and services. he recipients of Commonwealth social services and superannuants have been sh ockingly treated. I hope they will learn a lesson from the Government’s treatment of them and take the first opportunity to do something about it. This will be when the Capricornia by-election and the Senate election are held later in the year.\n\nThe Treasurer (Mr McMahon), in a speech that lasted for an hour and twenty minutes, estimated that expenditure for 1967-68 would reach $6,483m. In his speech he made several important references which show that a nation with Australia’s great resources should not be quibbling about what can be done to provide a better way of life or a higher standard of living for its people. The failure of the Treasurer to include in the Budget provision for an increase in the rates of pension and in particular an increase for the recipient of the base rate pension is in itself almost criminal, especially in view of his admission that monetary policy can and will be used as necessary to help keep the economy on the right course. Is it to be assumed that the feeding, clothing and housing of pensioners would tend to make the economy unbalanced? Is that why pensioners receive nothing from the Budget? Let me repeat a statement made by the Treasurer in the closing minutes of the Budget Speech, for it is in direct conflict with the action he is taking. He said: the Government will as always be ready to meet particular needs or eventualities.\n\nIn our view businessmen can with confidence make plans with the expectation that the economy will continue to grow steadily. . .\n\nEven the most cautious amongst us can scarcely fail to be confident of the future of this country. Vast new discoveries of resources are becoming almost a commonplace. In this recent phase, each discovery had inspired further effort and further effort has led to new discoveries.\n\nAs far ahead as we can see Australia has all the potentialities for sustained growth . . .\n\nDoes the Treasurer imply that by failing to stimulate the living standards of pensioners and those on superannuation, in the long term the economy will become stronger? Does he seriously suggest that a married pensioner having to live on $1.68 a day, with which he would feed and clothe himself, pay for fuel, light and all other outgoings, would inflate the economy? If he does he should have to live on that amount himself.\n\nMy reading and understanding of the economics which the Treasurer employs in keeping the economy growing at a healthy rate and our resources fully employed appear to be all on the side of big business -the financiers, the investors and the employers, all of whom worship excessive profits and exhibit a lack of conscience as to how they are obtained. Is it not a fact that the Treasurer has already described this Budget as an investor’s Budget? In my lifetime, except, perhaps, for a period of war, I have never known any time when the full resources of this country have been fully employed. From Labor’s point of view, our total resources are not being fully employed, especially at the present time - far from it. Unemployment figures prove that. It is true that the Budget papers show that the Treasurer is using the banking system with advantage to this Government. Labor could do likewise with much greater advantage to those whom it represents.\n\nThe Treasurer has taken great pride in the fact that he has not increased the rate of general taxation in this year’s Budget. But, of course, he has exploited many other avenues for increasing revenue, including r couple of new fields of taxation. I remind the Treasurer that he did, of course - reluctantly, I suppose - increase taxation last year by 5% over the previous year. Of course, the whole history of this Government has been ohe of increased taxation. So how can we expect any better of it? The Treasurer, in referring to the vital importance that the increased growth of our population is having on our development, stressed the need to continue at maximum capacity the immigration programme. Then in the same breath he said that this year the Government is providing $25m for assisted passages and S5m to subsidise accommodation costs at migrant hostels, plus $3.9m for improvements to Government hostels. If we are to believe that the immigration programme is as important as the Minister makes out, I would like to know whether he will say why the assisted passage programme has been cut back by $1.8m and the accommodation subsidy cut by $600,000 for the ensuing year. I remind honourable members that it was the Labor Party which initiated our immigration programme. We want it to continue. But we also want migrants to be properly and fairly catered for in every respect. I doubt whether this is being done at the present time.\n\nAn aspect of migration which I think needs clarification is the payment of an accommodation subsidy to occupants of Commonwealth hostels. Is any assistance given to migrants who on arrival in Australia seek out and obtain rented accommodation for themselves? Do these migrants receive assistance in meeting their living costs? If they do not, why arc they treated differently from those people occupying Government accommodation? Does it mean that’ migrants who come here and who get out and rough it in various” types of accommodation will be allowed to do so, while those residing in Commonwealth hostels are to continue to get handouts in the form of assistance with their- accommodation expenditure. As I see it one of this Government’s greatest blunders has been its long term handling of migration. According to statistics, in the last 10 years alone the Government has spent over $250m to bring more than 1,000,000 permanent settlers here. Many of these people have been stateless and some have come from war ravaged countries. But, once they have come here, they have been left practically to their own resources without a cent to their name. These people are easy prey for hire purchase pressure agents and all types of confidence men. In particular, all State governments, local government bodies and semi-government authorities have been the bunnies in this Government’s migration programme. It is a case of the Commonwealth cooping the cash and the States the responsibility of citizenship.\n\nThe migration target this year is 148,000 persons, the same as last year. From that number the Treasurer hopes to obtain about 70,000 workers to expand his work force and provide . the necessary monetary increase he requires to boost next year’s Budget. As far as I can remember the State governments have complained incessantly of their shortage of funds. Some have threatened to end uniform taxation and others have spoken of recession. Under the Government’s programme tens of thousands of people come to the country ready to work, ready for school and to live new lives in the country of their adoption, only to find a lack of finance which affects public hospitals, kindergartens, schools, colleges, universities, health centres, public parks and gardens, housing, new roads, water and sewerage facilities, transport, sporting centres, swimming baths and public libraries. The institutions 1 have referred to, as well as many others, have to be financed to some extent by State governments which, under the present orthodox system of public finance, are compelled to accept whatever finance this Government, allegedly through the Australian Loan Council, doles out to them. For my part, the method by which the Loan Council makes its handouts, is entirely unacceptable, whether it be financial assistance grants, betterment grants, or any other type of grant it might be doling out.\n\nIt is plainly noticeable that while the Commonwealth public debt is being quickly and substantially reduced, the States’ debt is leaping ahead and is now more than treble the amount of the Commonwealth debt. I often wonder if the rat race will ever come to an end, or for how long our people have to put up with impoverishment while the investors flourish on interest bearing investments of one kind or another, on which we pay this year more than $509m in interest. It must be obvious that the Loan Council, which meets about once a year, is not in a position to judge the effect, financially, that an additional 140,000 new people scattered throughout the several States can have on the community, in the circumstances prevailing from year to year.\n\nEarlier this year the Loan Council increased the borrowing programme of local and semi-government authorities from $200,000 to $300,000 where such authorities propose to borrow, in the aggregate, in excess of that amount, but it fixed no limit for councils which were seeking to raise less than $300,000. Apparently the Loan Council has done this to incite councils and shires into a greater borrowing programme which should be the Commonwealth’s responsibility. For many years local government bodies, the water boards and other authorities, have been called upon to bear the financial burden of catering for not only the newly arrived migrants but for the increase in local population as well. The concept of life and the vastly improved living standards which people enjoy throughout Australia demand from all authorities the highest service possible and quite often councils and shires have the labour, materials, machines and know how to undertake all types of work but are stopped from doing so because finance is not available to them.\n\nOnly last week the Commonwealth Government members Food and Agricultural Committee agreed that the States could do a much better job if finance were available to them. Yet, when members of this Committee come into this place they become dumb about this. Very often finance cannot be found simply because pensioners and low wage earners do not have the money to pay their rates. As a result, shires and councils are owed large amounts in arrears of rates. Water boards find themselves in a similar position in regard to a shortage of funds. They are unable to extend water and sewerage reticulation or carry out capital works as they would like. In recent years some local government and water board authorities have adopted devastating and ruthless ordinances which allow them to extract from builders of property and from developers huge amounts in fees for the provision of public parking, for the laying of kerb and guttering and the tar sealing of roads. All this adds considerably to the costs to be borne by the ratepayers. Water boards under recent legislation in New South Wales can now require a developer to pay a fantastic amount for sewerage of land that they are developing. Yet, the very same board when carrying out sewerage developments as part of its own annual programme does so without charge to the owner of the land on which the home stands. In effect, all this means that on the one hand some owners can have their land connected to sewerage without cost while others, many of whom have already paid $400 to $500 for septic systems to be installed at their homes, have again to pay through the neck for a sewerage service which a board runs through their property, thus duplicating the cost already incurred.\n\nRecently my sister, who is a pensioner, wished to sell her home and build a smaller one. She was compelled to pay the Hunter District Water Board at Newcastle $400 to have her home connected with the sewerage mains already serving the area where she is now residing, allegedly because she was a developer, although her new home will occupy half the. land on which her present home stands. I mention this to illustrate just what is happening in this modern age to ordinary decent people who are striving to establish themselves in homes but who are constantly at the mercy of authorities who, because they are unable to obtain public finance from this Government, cannot satisfy the standard requirements of their own departments. Consequently, these bodies have to resort to a form of piracy in which often the innocent become the victims. All this is happening in a nation which is chockfull of materials, goods and services and knowhow, and often the machinery and labour is available. But, in the eyes of this Government no money is available.\n\nThe Budget papers demonstrate a manipulation and movement of revenue which in my view shows there should be no reason why the central banking system could not be used to provide whatever funds State governments, local government or semi-governmental authorities need to carry out their respective programmes. Strangely enough, the Government can appropriate $S6m for National Capital development in Canberra this year. Yet, in the city of Newcastle, which is the fourth largest city and the third greatest trading port, we cannot get an airport or sufficient finance to sewer fully the city’s suburban areas. It is my view that the Loan Council should be abolished and replaced by a broad full time Commonwealth finance commission headed by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer before whom representatives of State governments, local government and semigovernmental authorities could appear and state a case for the granting of finance to enable them to carry out public works. It would also be the responsibility of such a commission to travel and inspect sites and otherwise investigate proposals that were before the commission.\n\nIf ever there was a case made out for the use of the central banking system in national development to enable our resources to be used in the real development of this country, it is to be found both in the Budget and in a speech made by the Treasurer last year on the occasion of the second reading of the National Debt Sinking Fund Bill. On a later occasion the Treasurer, speaking of loan fund finance, pointed out that war service homes advances were financed out of loan fund up to 1930-31 and again in 1950-51. The total amount of the advances financed out of loan fund was $90m, but repayments to the sinking fund have already totalled $307m. The sinking fund thus has already received $2 17m over the years, according to the Treasurer, for which no equivalent amount of debt was created in the first place. That illustration, I suggest, is sufficient proof to show that by proper employment of labour, material, goods and services, governments could do much more in the way of development.\n\nThe Budget shows that beyond the estimated $5, 887m revenue there will be a need to raise loans of $596m to balance this year’s accounts. Each of the last two Appropriation Bills has shown that the Treasurer has set aside $300m of loan fund finance for defence purposes. The papers reveal, however, that in the 1966-67 year only $198,425,594 of the appropriation was used. Likewise in the same period the Government had appropriated $120m and $ 122.84m of the same sort of money for the Commonwealth and States housing programme, on which money each State is required to pay substantial interest. I mention this because it becomes all the more important in the light of the Treasurer’s inability to give anything to the pensioners in the face of steeply rising prices and the present high cost of living, together with his refusal to face the facts in the provision of finance to State governments and to semi-government and local government authorities to carry out essential works and services, like water and sewerage reticulation which, immediately on completion, become self-supporting and paying propositions.\n\nIn 1955 the then Treasurer created the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve, which was established to meet the repurchase and redemption of loans maturing from time to time. Since its creation the Reserve has been able to liquidate about $ 1.600m worth of securities, including $152m of Treasury bills. At the present time it has standing to its credit $915,345,136. In the last two years alone the fund will have had paid into it from the Consolidated Revenue Fund amounts of $227m and $288m, yet this Government, with all this money at its disposal, could not provide $1 a week for its pensioners. I point out that this money has been contributed, by way of taxation, by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, by me and by all the people of Australia. Ironically, while the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve Act 1955 provides that there should not be a greater amount than £48im or $97m appropriated to it each year from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, this Government has been taking much larger sums year after year from revenue for that purpose, yet it cannot provide its pensioners with a decent living. Why? I know a lot of people who would like to know why. I point out that $1 a week to each pensioner would have taken less than $52m of what has been paid into the reserve in that time.\n\nThe Government’s refusal to increase pensions in this Budget has been a deliberately cold and calculated exercise. Of course, it is extremely hard to understand the purpose, for it must surely be committing political hari kari in its failure to recognise the needs of the base pensioner, more so when it is known that the Government is spending unlimited amounts on defence, and in the light of its credit arrangements with the United States of America in the purchase of the Fill aircraft, in respect of which a credit for $228,239,000 has already been arranged. I suggest that the tragedy of the Government’s refusal to increase the basic pension lies in the fact that it extended the means test by $3 a week earlier this year to satisfy its election undertakings of last year. In its easing of the means test the Government ignored the fact that base rate pensioners had suffered severe reversals of pension values at least twice over the preceding 18 months and that these had considerably reduced their living standards.\n\nIn the first place the introduction of decimal currency in 1966 had a catastrophic effect on basic items which base pensioners purchase. Decimal currency brought about a considerable reduction in the pui chasing value of the pension. Rent increases and high valuations have considerably increased the burdens of home owning pensioners, aged married couples and widows being the worst affected. Many pensioners have had their entitlements to pharmaceutical services taken from them simply because the drugs they need have been removed from the free list of lifesaving drugs. It is known that for some years the Government has been watching the spiralling cost of its health services and, accordingly, the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) has been hiding behind the action of his pharmaceutical committee which, from time to time, has removed many of the drugs from the free list simply to save the Government further increased costs in its health service. Despite what may be said to the contrary, there can be no denying that with the introduction of decimal currency all people living on fixed incomes have suffered an immediate physical reduction in living standards. The proof of this is to be found in the fact that 200c had to equal 240d or £1, the pound having been the basic unit of Australian currency up to that time. To establish decimal currency it became necessary for the Decimal Currency Board to equate the dollar with the pound. Therefore before it could proceed to create a new currency it was necessary to absorb 20d or ls 8d into every dollar of currency. This meant that 40d were to be lost in every Australian pound. The immediate effect that this has had on people on basic pensions has been paralysing. It immediately reduced quite considerably the value of their income. I claim that married pensioner couples have lost the equivalent of 36s a week - that is, on two pensions of £5 10s each, 40d in the £1 would work out at 36s.\n\nThe proof of the related values of the dollar and the pound is to be found in the past and present costs of basic commodities on which pensioners live. These consist principally of meat, milk, bread, sugar, flour, eggs, cakes and pastry, fruit and vegetables, canned goods, soap and soap powders, stamps, papers and ice cream. And we must not forget that ice cream still carries sales tax. Almost every day newspapers carry pages of advertisements marking up certain goods at special prices at supermarkets and business houses. These special prices are intended to induce people into those shops. There should be no need for such wasteful use of capital. Such advertisements should be banned and there should be price control over the whole field of consumer goods and services to force down the prices of commodities. Radio and television advertising should, to some extent, be limited.\n\nTo illustrate how base pensioners have had their living standards reduced under decimal currency I point out that with milk costing 11c a bottle, 18 bottles can be purchased for every $2, whereas when milk cost lid a bottle, 22 bottles could be purchased for each £1. Cakes and pastry that cost 4d each or 60 to the £1 now cost 5c or 40 to the $2. The cost of beef, mutton and pig meats has increased beyond the ability of the pensioner to buy. Biscuits that once sold for 18d a packet now sell at from 18c to 24c a packet. Cheese now sells at upwards of 60c, or the equivalent of 6s, a pound. Fruit and vegetables are being sold by the pound weight, by the dozen or by the cent, but irrespective of how it is sold no-one can deny that oranges, apples, bananas or any other fruit that was sold by the piece before decimal currency could be obtained in 240 pieces at Id each for £1 as. compared with 200 pieces at lc each for $2. Similarly one could purchase 80 pieces at 3d each and 40 at 6d each as compared with 60 at 3c each and 33 at 6c each. Newspapers which sold at 4d now cost 5c, so for the. same value one procures 8 fewer papers. Headache powders, which once cost 2s. a packet, cost 25c. Stamps purchased . at 4d yielded 60 for each £1 whereas stamps costing 4c yield 50 for $2. Bus fares which cost lOd now cost 10c, so whereas a person could have 24 trips for £1 he gets 20 trips for an equivalent value now. Of course, pensioners enjoy the concession of half rate fares.\n\nThe Newcastle ‘Morning Herald*, in its leading article of 18th August, correctly pointed out how the pensioners have had to eke out an existence through 1966 and 1967 with a pension increase of only $1 a week, although wage levels had increased by $4.32 a week during the same period, lt is deplorable that the Government should in this Budget dismiss all references to social services with a 17 line statement, in the light of the rapidly increasing cost of living. Its action in giving meagre increases to large families by way of increased child endowment is somewhat difficult to understand. The increase is totally insufficient. The Government is to be condemned for its failure to recognise the need of old persons who live on their- own and are struggling to pay off their homes or to meet rates and insurance premiums.\n\nThere are many other subjects that have been referred to in the Budget, such as child endowment, repatriation, concessional deductions, superannuation, life assurance cover and postal charges, that should be critically analysed but time will not permit for me to do that. I support the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition and I urge honourable members opposite to join us on this side of the House in voting the Budget out.\n\nMr HAWORTH:\n\nIsaacs\n\n– I regret that 1 did not hear the whole of the speech of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Griffiths). I did hear him say something about decimal coinage a few moments ago but I do not’ propose to go into that question.\n\nMr Peters:\n\n– It would go over the honourable member’s head.\n\nMr HAWORTH:\n\n– Apparently it went over the head of the honourable member for Scullin because he is lying very low in his seat. There were two matters that I heard discussed during the Budget speeches of honourable members opposite with which I want to cross swords. It was said that the Budget was irresponsible and that it was a do nothing Budget. The remark that it was an irresponsible Budget was made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). I forget who said that it was a do nothing Budget. However, I want to take them up on those two remarks. It certainly lacks the spectacular gimmicks that the Opposition like in a Budget but it has been drawn up for the purpose of avoiding the very thing that the Opposition has complained about in past years on the many occasions when I have heard Opposition members replying to a Budget speech. They have always said the Budget was a stop-go Budget. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech that he believed the Budget would have been better to have erred on the side of expansion and, if necessary, throttle back later in the year. This is the kind of modus operandi that has caused recessions in the past. I have no doubt that the Opposition would welcome such a situation again, solely for political purposes. Alternatively, of course, we must remember that the Opposition has had no opportunity to exercise a responsible judgment of national budgeting for very many years.\n\nSometimes a do nothing budget is right for a country like Australia. It is not the easiest type of policy to introduce, but when, by definition, you are right on a point of sound economic balance, as I think this Budget is, any great weight on either side can only do a lot of harm rather than a lot of good. Last year the economy of this country suffered from a mild depression due to drought conditions, which most honourable members know about. If one examines the unemployment figures, the building industry figures or the appliance industry figures, one will see that we are today moving out of this phase. I believe that industry could be and should be encouraged. This is my philosophy and I know that it is the philosophy of my colleagues. This is vital if companies are to spend money on development and the kind of things that we want to be done today. This country is capable of achieving a lot more than it is doing even now without creating the inflationary pressures that have caused trouble in the past.\n\nThe facts are that on page 6 of the printed Budget speech under the. item of defence, the Treasurer (Mr McMahon) reminds the people of this country that we are providing $1,1 18m for defence; in other words, $700m more than 4 years ago. A percentage of this money will find itself into the Australian economy, particularly as the Government is directing that a greater proportion of the defence allocation be spent in Australia than has been the case in the last 2 years. The central fact of this massive and essential defence commitment, however, dominates this year’s Budget, and it is to this aspect that I wish chiefly to address myself. In the realm of external affairs, ever since this Budget has been brought down the situation in South East Asia has not improved but, indeed, has worsened. What effect this may have on the defence estimates in the future no one would like to hazard a guess - not even the Minister for Defence (Mr Fairhall), who is sitting at the table. It certainly seems unlikely that there will be quick relief from major defence requirements.\n\nThe problem becomes a very complex one, particularly when one considers the effects and implications of the statement made recently by the Secretary of State for\n\nDefence in the United Kingdom, in what is known as the White Paper. There is no doubt that Australia will now have to adjust its defence thinking and, indeed, its whole economy to meet the implications that will arise from the United Kingdom’s new defence policy. But this position does not end there. There are other problems, including that of the strategic manpower required in defence of our policies in South East Asia. This country alone cannot solve those problems, particularly with a population approximating 12 million. For something more than 2 centuries there has been a British presence in Asia. Indeed, the fact of the British presence, along with that of other European powers at various periods, is largely the determinant for many ‘ of the political ‘ boundaries and economic circumstances of today’s Asia. True it is that the United Kingdom Government in the White Paper makes some reassuring noises in the direction of those of us barbarians who will have to remain in outer far-flung places. The White Paper says:\n\nIn planning withdrawal we must take into account’ the impact of our plans on the peoples concerned and on the policies of our allies . . .\n\nAt that point we must be content, according to the Secretary of State for Defence in the United Kingdom. He goes on to say by implication that by 1970 the British military presence in this region will be reduced to some visiting naval and amphibious forces, possibly a few aircraft based in Australia or in the Indian Ocean area, and perhaps a garrison in Hong Kong. With this, too, we must be content.\n\nAustralia’s defence commitments in the past have been wisely built round the strategy that in any eventuality of a dangerous nature Australia’s population would be too small to enable her to act by herself and that action would best be taken in association with Great Britain. This has always been our thinking, lt was this approach that led us to send troops to Europe and the Middle East in two world wars without question and almost without national debate. Not that we in Australia were in danger at those times of decision, but we had a moral obligation to help a country that had never been called on to assist us in any similar way. We found a national consensus of respect for an ideal that has been an ideal in this country for a very long time in relation to the British Commonwealth of Nations. Somebody writing in tine of the English newspapers recently suggested that thinking like this is just old hat. We now have it on the very highest authority, Sir, that it is indeed old hat.\n\nask the question: What then remains for Australia? First and foremost we are faced with a power vacuum in South East Asia that cannot be left unfilled. The thought of this must be exercising our own minds and indeed those of the people of other countries in the Pacific basin. In particular this must affect Australia’s Budget, and that is what we are talking about at present. The United Kingdom Government must expect to be criticised for having created the power vacuum in South East Asia. We all would like to shut our eyes to what is happening in Asia but doing that would not solve the problem. I believe that what happens in Asia in the future must affect the future of Britain almost as profoundly as it will affect Australia’s future. I can just recall Australia being told in 1914, and I very well remember our being told in 1939, that what happened in Europe must affect the future of Australia and New Zealand. I believed that to be true then just as it is true today that what happens in Asia must affect the future of Britain and Europe. Europe cannot live in comfortable isolation while the security of the Asian continent gradually erodes. We may want the Chinese to stay inside the Great Wall of China, but they have already shown that they will not. We may want them to go away from the places where they have ventured, but they have shown that they will not. Our policy must take into account the world that is, not just the world that we would like. That is why I believe that the present Budget is appropriate to the occasion.\n\nThe conflict in South East Asia has reached a critical stage and will probably remain critical for some time to come. I believe that the withdrawal by the United Kingdom Government of its forces from this part of the world is an extremely dangerous action. In fact, I believe that all the talk that has gone on concerning the proposed British withdrawal and its time table has undoubtedly encouraged the North Vietnamese to resist peace negotiations. Now that Britain gives notice that she is pulling out of Asia, the question is: Will it be the United States of America pulling out tomorrow? It is thoughts of this sort that are permeating the minds of people in some parts of the Asian continent, quite apart from the leaders of North Vietnam, and this is understandable. I ask: Are we entitled to brush aside the plan of Mr Healey, the United Kingdom Minister of Defence, for rapid military deployment to Asia in an emergency? I think we are - not in defence matters, strictly speaking, but in the preparation of our Budget. Anyone who has had experience of the practical and logistic problems of fighting in the tropics knows that it takes weeks and even months to acclimatise fighting troops. Today’s world crises do not wait on that kind of process.\n\nIn any case rapid deployment is clearly not a substitute for continuing presence. The economic and stabilising effects of the British defence presence in Singapore and Malaysia have been quite as important as, if not more important than, the strategic effects. There is in Mr Healey’s plan nothing that provides an alternative to this. Indeed, the point is that the price that the British apparently arc willing to pay to get into Europe is the giving up of this role of economic stabiliser in South East Asia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the question: Out of all this what are the implications for the Australian Government’s policy. This, it seems to me, is not entirely a defence question. It is a much wider subject, and this in effect is the situation that the Treasurer referred to in his Budget speech. The importance of the British withdrawal east of Suez, as men like Lee Kuan Yew must be painfully aware, is that it represents the end of a system. We in Australia are very much caught up in this. Leadership, like peace, is indivisible. The United Kingdom, in renouncing leadership and responsibility in the defence context, does so in every other context. The question for Australia to consider is: Just what are the other ways in which we are affected?\n\nIt must be remembered that Australia holds in Britain sterling balances of many millions of dollars. I suppose that our balances in New York are as good as those held in London. We are now doing most of our international trading with nonsterling countries and the problems set for sterling by the recent Arab-Israeli war have certainly posed the question of whether there is wisdom in so much of Australia’s reserves being held in sterling. Holding so much of our international reserves in that currency may even be a risky business in spite of the fact that the British balance of payments is more favourable today than it was, say, 12 months ago. There are still, Mr Deputy Speaker, many who believe that despite the cutting down of British commitments east of Suez it is still only a matter of when the United Kingdom will devalue its currency, not whether it will do so. The English journal, the ‘Economist’, has mentioned that only recently. Presumably it would still be in Australia’s interest for us to go only some part of the way down - say, to par with the United States dollar - should this event occur. But all the circumstances impel us to ask the Government: Why preserve such large holdings of reserves in London?\n\nIn the area of external affairs it is pleasing to see that the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Hasluck), while in Bangkok recently, did his best to inject vigour and a sense of- purpose into the Asian and Pacific Council, commonly known as ASPAC, and the goodwill that the Prime Minister (Mr Harold Holt) so successfully promoted during his recent trip abroad. We badly need a regional organisation of Asian countries. We should go further and interest other powers in the security of South East Asia, and in establishing such a regional organisation. If we are to get this going, the Treasurer will, I am sure, have to dig much deeper into the national purse. I believe that the non-atomic Asian countries realise today more than they did yesterday that China is coolly plotting against South East Asia and that there is need for a regional organisation. It was a source of satisfaction to note also that the South East Asian countries, at their recent conference in Bangkok, rejected the Indonesian Government’s somewhat over-generalised move against foreign bases in the region.\n\nThe increased commitment in foreign aid which is included in this year’s Budget will very likely be followed by further increases in years to come. Australia, the United\n\nStates and Japan are the three most industrialised countries in the Pacific area. At least two of them are certainly becoming progressively more so, and all three are becoming more important to one another through trade and the flow of capital. It is axiomatic that defence follows trade. Tn these circumstances one can surely make a realistic assessment of the grouping that must take place.\n\nEngland’s military withdrawal east of Suez and her preoccupation with the European Economic Community leave Australia little choice. We must achieve closer economic, commercial and defence relations with Japan and the United States. Fifteen years ago imports from Japan and the United States represented only 10% of the total of Australian imports. The share of these two countries in Australian total imports has now risen to’ 33%. The trend of national policy is indicated by this striking increase, and the more this policy can be accelerated the more quickly can an increase of social benefits, which is noticeably absent from this Budget, be granted.\n\nIf we are to help Asian countries to. get on with their economic and social programmes, with the assistance of Western countries, a military programme is necessary; without such a programme the increased foreign civil aid in this Budget can , make little impact. I remind the House that Asia and, particularly South East Asia have constituted - and still constitute - a valuable and. profitable market for Great Britain for all classes of British manufactured goods. I must say there , are nasty implications in the idea that Britain will now be happy to let other people do the peace keeping while she gets on with the cash register keeping. If the United Kingdom cannot do anything for the economic and social projects envisaged by her. allies for this part of the world, she can at least leave her troops in the area and maintain her bases. No country in this day and age can have, or even try to have, the best of all worlds in international affairs. Commendably, Great Britain in the past has shown a deep recognition of this fact, but, as the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Hasluck) has said, and as I repeat: ‘We have to learn to work not with the Britain that used to be but with what Britain choses to be in the future.*\n\nAs I said previously, a war in Asia is just as dangerous to the peace of the world as a war in Europe. Australia realised this in 1914 and also in 1939. I say again that Great Britain, France and other European countries cannot isolate themselves from what is going on in Asia, just as those countries declared in 1914 and in the early period of the Second World War that the United States could not live in isolation. The United States, indeed, realises today that she cannot live in isolation from the rest of the world. The first thing we must achieve in Vietnam, which is. Australia’s immediate problem in South East Asia, is to bring all parties to the peace table. Secondly, we have to teach the Asians to build an economic and viable continent. But until the first objective in Vietnam, is achieved, military action must go on. There is a part for Britain to play here. If she will not do so and if she turns her back on Asia at this time the effects on Britain herself may well be incalculable.\n\nFinally I would like to make a few comments on the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) because if this amendment were to be passed by the House the Australian Labor Party Opposition would become the Government. The Opposition would then, as a Government, be committed to implementing the resolutions agreed to by the conference in Adelaide of the executive of the Party. To my mind those four resolutions merely confirm the Calwell declaration that a Labor Government would withdraw the Australian troops that are now in Vietnam. There has been no change from this doctrine which the then Leader of the Opposition proclaimed during the last election campaign and which the people of the country turned down so emphatically. The resolutions were, first, to stop the bombing in North Vietnam; secondly, to recognise the National Liberation Front as a principal party to. negotiations; thirdly, to transform operations in South Vietnam into holding operations; and fourthly, to cease the use of napalm and other objectionable materials of war. The Opposition believes that if bombing ceases it may be possible to persuade North Vietnam to come to the peace table. The Opposition knows that the United Slates has declared that it is prepared to cease bombing but that North Vietnam has shown no sign that it wants to negotiate. It is just humbug in these circumstances to suggest a cessation of bombing, because North Vietnam has shown very clearly that it is not prepared to negotiate. In agreeing to these four resolutions the Labor Party, in my view, is simply shadow-sparring.\n\nBut I have no time now to discuss in detail these four resolutions. Perhaps the third resolution is the most amazing of them. It proposes the transformation of operations in South Vietnam into holding operations. This, I believe, would strengthen the control of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese in South Vietnam. Sections of South Vietnam are now held by the National Liberation Front, the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese, and if we transform operations in South Vietnam into holding operations we will be conceding the sections held by the invaders for all time. In other words the Labor Party Opposition says that South Vietnam and the United States must acknowledge defeat in all areas that they do not now occupy, and there are large areas in South Vietnam that they do not occupy. Can you imagine, Mr Speaker, how stable and peaceful South Vietnam could be with sections of the country held by the enemy? As the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) rightly said in London, these resolutions agreed to by the Australian Labor Party Adelaide conference do not alter the policy enunciated by him in 1966.\n\nIn conclusion. I hope that this House will reject the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. It comes from an Opposition which, as I said earlier, has had no opportunity for many years of exercising a responsible judgment on national budgeting. In all those years it has obviously learned nothing and it obviously has no ability to make a sound judgment on international affairs.\n\nMr COURTNAY:\n\nDarebin\n\n– I can well agree with much of what the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Haworth) has said. I agree, for instance, that our efforts should be directed towards getting the parties involved in Vietnam around the conference table in order to achieve a peaceful solution. Of course, the honourable member went on to attack those who contend that one thing that is necessary if we are to get the parties to the conference table is to stop the bombing of North Vietnam. The Australian Labor Party is not alone in suggesting that the bombing should cease. It is backed by U Thant and His Holiness the Pope. In fact, most responsible world leaders have appealed for a cessation of the bombing in order to see whether such action will assist to get the parties to the peace table. I concede that cessation of the bombing might not work, but we say that in view of what is going on in Vietnam, it at least should be given a trial. The honourable member for Isaacs said that it is humbug to advocate a cessation of the bombing. Does he like the bombing? Does he not think that cessation is worth a trial? What is going on now is far more than humbug and of far greater consequence to the Australian people than would be a cessation of the bombing.\n\nEscalation of the war in Vietnam has even greater significance for Australia now that Great Britain has announced her intention to withdraw her forces east of Suez. Britain’s action was foreseeable. It is of little use the Government and its supporters claiming that Britain has sprung something upon us. Britain’s action is the culmination of something that has been going on not for months but for years and this Government made no preparations to meet it. Now the Government claims that Mr Healey and Mr Wilson told, it stories; that they told the Government that Britain would not withdraw her forces. All along the line Britain’s action, has been foreseeable. Australia now must make adjustments in order to meet the new situation. The Opposition realises that these adjustments are necessary and it will not oppose any sane and sensible proposition advanced to protect our flanks. But so far the Government has not advanced such a proposition. We are caught now as we were in 1939, when for years this country had been governed without any policy capable of meeting what was to confront it. I will not at this stage go more deeply into those matters.\n\nFor all the reasons advanced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and for many more which commend themselves to me, I support the amendment moved by the honourable gentleman. I heard the Treasurer (Mr McMahon) deliver his Budget speech. I have read the speech. I have taken heed of the advice given so freely to all of us by some Government supporters that the Budget must be taken in conjunction with the paper issued a few weeks earlier describing in glowing terms the future economic prospects of Australia. I have read that paper also. After going through the painful exercise of listening to the Budget speech and. after reading both it and the paper on the economic condition of the nation, I became very suspicious because all of it added up to something like a Stanley Korman prospectus.\n\nIn my view the Budget is dull and uninspiring. It offers nothing. As the honourable member for Isaacs and other Government supporters have told us, the Budget was intended to peg the economy and give it a chance to become stabilised so that it might go forward to create the glorious future that we are told lies ahead of us. 1 do not know who will enjoy this glorious future; certainly it will not be the pensioners. The most’ important component of the Budget is the allocation for defence. This is to be increased by about 18%. This is an enormous1 expenditure. The Labor Party does not quibble about expenditure on defence provided the right plans are adopted and the right equipment is bought at the right price. ‘ We feel that it is the obligation of all the people of Australia to defend this nation. The Labor Party has never been remiss in its duty in this respect. It was the forces that are now represented on the Opposition side of the House which rallied the Australian nation to its greatest effort in defence after the Government parties had let the nation down and left it defenceless. Under Labor Australia was rallied to its: greatest effort industrially, politically and militarily. We take great credit for this. We have never lagged in our duty in this respect. Nevertheless, we have earned the right to criticise steps which the Government may take for the defence of this country and the manner in which it takes those steps.\n\nThe Auditor-General has been deeply concerned about some of our expenditure overseas on defence equipment. He has referred to the price that we are paying for some of it, and we still do not know the final price for some of this equipment. In his Budget speech the Treasurer said that consideration must be given to these matters because the economy could not continue to sustain the rate of expenditure to which it is being subjected, nor the escalation of the rate, which apparently must now occur because of Great Britain’s withdrawal from east of Suez. To some extent I am a little sorry for the Treasurer. There is not much in his Budget, but he was faced with paying in 1967 the accounts for a shopping spree in 1963. He had to meet those accounts with a 1967 Budget. In 1963, as we well know, Australia’s defences were practically nil. In order to . recoup what it had lost in the 1961” elections the Government sent somebody to America with a blank cheque and away we went. I do not know, because I am not qualified to know-\n\nMr Pearsall:\n\n– Hear, hear!\n\nMr COURTNAY:\n\n– I am qualified to know one thing, but perhaps I had better not mention it because it would be too unkind. I am not qualified to know, nor, T suggest, is the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Pearsall), whether the Fill aircraft is the best aircraft available. All I can say is that we must take our Service chiefs and other experts on trust in this matter and if it is the best equipment available, I am thankful that we have it.\n\nMr Graham:\n\n– Hear, hear!\n\nMr COURTNAY:\n\n– Thank you. There is at least one intelligent gentleman opposite. I am satisfied that We have purchased this equipment because we need it. But that does not mean that I should not be permitted to criticise the manner in which the Government went about purchasing it and the price which ultimately we will pay for it. I suggest that no real answer has been given to the criticisms which have been made about the purchase of the equipment. The Minister for Defence (Mr Fairhall) has described the Fill aircraft as being the greatest thing with wings since angels. We have been told that it is the best in the world and that it is the cheapest in the world. If this aircraft is such a bargain, for heaven’s sake do not let us lose contact with the manufacturers because we might want to buy more.\n\nMr Duthie:\n\n– At S9m each?\n\nMr COURTNAY:\n\n– We have been told that at $9m each they are cheap. But what I deplore most about the Budget is that little, if any, provision has been made for the most needy section of the Australian community. The honourable member for Isaacs and most other Government supporters have been of the same opinion. The Treasurer has said that this is an investors’ Budget. That is all very well, but many people in our community are not investors. No doubt this expression appeals to Government supporters. We have been told that it is an investors’ Budget and a businessman’s Budget, and someone had the effrontery to say that it is a family man’s Budget’.\n\nThe Government has given little consideration to social services. In answer to a question this morning the Treasurer said that in the compilation of the Budget the first consideration is the base rate pension. That may have been his first consideration, but I suggest that he gave it very little consideration. One honourable gentleman opposite said that we must keep things in some order of priority. I can imagine the way that they would go about that. I can imagine them saying: ‘The pensioners are a little overfed anyhow.’ Something of this sort must have been said. The Treasurer admitted this morning that prices have risen by about 10%. Even before the price increases pensioners were not overfed, nor could it be said that they were well catered for. Surely the measure of any nation is the extent to which it will provide for its elderly citizens who have helped to build the nation. Although pensioners were not well off last year, their miserable pittance has been eroded by a 10% increase in the cost of living. After giving them his first consideration when compiling the Budget the Treasurer has kindly conveyed to them that for the next 12 months they are to continue to suffer the erosion process.\n\nI have heard it said by honourable members opposite that in Australia we have the best social services system in the world. I do not agree, with that. Nor am I prepared to admit that the Government was responsible for the establishment of social services in Australia. Government supporters claim that we have the best health scheme and education system. They boast that all these things are the best in the world. But there is another section of the community which I propose to mention. I refer to those who are on fixed incomes and who, over the years, have seen their standards eroded. For years they have made submissions t6 members of all parties. The only tangible response that they have had to their requests has been an attempt by the Labor Party to do something for them. Then there are those who receive a repatriation benefit. Government supporters are very fond of referring to the situation in 1949. Apparently their memories will not go back beyond 1949. Perhaps they do not want to remember what happened before then. However, I propose to remind them.\n\nI have in my hand a letter from the Returned Services League of Australia from which I propose to read. It should not be necessary for me to do so because every honourable member in this place received a copy of this letter, not only this year but also last year. All honourable members had an opportunity to vote on the propositions which have been advanced by the Returned Services League and when it came to a division all members of the Government parties voted against them, just as they will vote against the propositions this time. I hope that the Returned Services League is aware of this. The letter which relates to war pensions and the 1967 Budget states:\n\nIn October 1966 this sub-branch directed to you a letter of approach concerning the above matter as it related to the position at that time. j invite the House to note that all members received that letter in October 1966. The letter continues:\n\nSince that date a further analysis of the three main classes of war pension in relation to the current national minimum adult wage reveals the decline in value which has taken place since 1950 when the present Government took office. The year 1949 is also shown for relative purposes.\n\nThe letter then contains a tabic which shows the special total and permanent incapacity rate as being 84% of the basic wage in 1949. In 1950, after the Government took office it rose to 101% of the then basic wage. That was largely a reflection on the inflation that had occurred following the rejection of the prices control referendum. The Government had to do something that time so it increased the rate to 101% of the then basic wage. In 1966 the special rate pension was down to 93% of the basic wage and in July 1967 it was down to 81.5%. From 1950 there had been a fall of 19.5%. The general rate 100% pension in 1949 was 43% of the basic wage. Iri 1950 it had climbed to 51% and by 1966 it was back to 37%. In July 1967 it was 32% of the basic wage, 19% below the 1950 figure.\n\nWar widows, to whom I have referred previously, make up the next category. In 1949 their pittance was 47% of the basic wage. The Government increased the rate to 55% of the basic wage in 1950. By 1960 it had been reduced to 40%, and in July 1967 it was down to 35% of the basic wage. Do honourable members opposite still want to refer to 1949 when I tell them that at that time war widows received a benefit equal to 47% of the basic wage whereas their benefit is now only 35% of the basic wage and has dropped 20% since 1950? These are not my figures; they have been supplied by the Returned Services League of Australia. If one examines social service benefits one sees a similar pattern. I have referred to repatriation benefits because they have been brought to my notice and I have been able to quote the official figures which have been calculated by the Returned Services League.\n\nI come now to workers’ compensation. The Commonwealth Employees’ Compensation Act has attracted scathing comment, even from the judiciary. I have repeatedly raised this subject since 1958 and we have been assured repeatedly by various Ministers, by the present Treasurer and by the present Prime Minister (Mr Harold Holt) that the matter was receiving their earnest and serious consideration. Since 1958 they have all agreed that this matter must be dealt with and that the Act must be rationalised and brought at least to the standard of the State Acts. They have agreed that the injured worker was entitled at least to some more humane consideration than he was getting. As a matter of fact, since the Act has been administered by a different Minister - I do not want to name the former Minister - there has been a little softer attitude and a. little more, latitude in assessing whether a person is entitled to compensation.\n\nHowever, the point I make is that Ministers generally had agreed that the provisions of the Act were pretty grim. Special attention should be given to this Act now. The Government is conscripting youths into the Army. Until they leave these shores or if they remain within these shores, they come under the provisions of the Act. If we have an Act which the Government admits is outdated and should be brought into line with modern standards, we have one argument at least to support a contention that the Government should not be conscripting people who must abide by its provisions.\n\nI said that this matter had been raised repeatedly. I will refer to the last two occasions on which it was raised. On 14 March 1967, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Nicholls) directed a question to the Treasurer, who is reported at page 592 of Hansard as having replied:\n\nI regret to say that I have not been able to get a report to Cabinet on the matter to which the honourable member has referred. This has been a very difficult and complicated job and I have not been able to get a submission prepared for Cabinet on which to base legislation. However, I have kept asking when the legislation could be ready, and I have recently been assured that within the course of the next few days I will have a submission ready for Cabinet. I hope then to be able to introduce a Bill into the House, not in the next four weeks that the House is sitting but certainly in the autumn sessional period.\n\nThis had a somewhat familiar ring, because as far . back as November 1965 the Treasurer, who is now the Prime Minister, said that he would introduce a Bill in the autumn session. But here we have the present Treasurer saying in March last that he would introduce a Bill in the autumn session. This shows the duplicity of the Government on this matter. It is like the fob off that was given to the dairy farmers when a committee of inquiry made proposals about the dairy industry some 10 years ago. Reasonable and sound propositions to rationalise the industry were made. If they had been adopted, some of the sufferings and the undernourishment, if I may call it that, in the fringe farms would have been eliminated.\n\nSitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.28 p.m.\n\nMr COURTNAY:\n\n– In the time that I had left I was about to refer to the situation in the dairy industry. However, time is short. In addition to what I have said, my views on this matter are contained in a little pamphlet entitled ‘The Great Hoax’ which was recently issued. It would be of benefit to the members of the Australian Country Party. It is educational and I recommend it to ail dairy farmers.\n\nI should like to say a few words about road safety which the Treasurer (Mr McMahon) mentioned this morning. I refer to a report made by . the Australian Automobile Association which drew attention to the fact that every 3 hours there is a death on our roads and every 7 minutes someone is maimed on our roads. The Association came to some very startling conclusions in this matter. Its main conclusion was that although the States would be willing to do these things which can be done to minimise this dreadful slaughter they are hamstrung by the fact that over the years the Commonwealth Government has never seriously attempted to do anything in this field. Each year it provides very small sums to those who are looking after this problem. The Association drew attention to the fact that under the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads Act, which established the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads, the Commonwealth did what it so often does. In section 17 of the Act it provided:\n\nExcept with the approval’ of the Minister, the Bureau, or a member (including an acting member) of the Bureau, shall not make public -\n\nany information obtained by the Bureau in the course of carrying out any investigation;\n\nthe results of any investigation carried out by the Bureau, or\n\nthe whole or any part of the contents of a report furnished by the Bureau to the Minister.\n\nThe Commonwealth adopts this policy on this matter although, as I stated before, every 3 hours a person dies on our roads. So if the Commonwealth official who investigates and reports upon an accident comes to the conclusion, as he must do in most cases, that certain factors were involved in the accident, such as lack of adequate road safety, which could be corrected were money made available to bring the road to a condition which suits modern transport, that information would not be made public. If he finds this he dare not report it, and indeed is forbidden to report it, to anyone other than the Minister and it may not be reported to Parliament so that we could at least do something to stop this dreadful slaughter. Also, the officer’s submissions may not be reported to the Australian Automobile Association and to the various bodies which seek to deal with this problem. Whilst they may blame the Commonwealth Government for its inadequate attention to the problem they cannot blame this Parliament. The Commonwealth Government, as a matter of deliberate policy, forbids the presentat"
