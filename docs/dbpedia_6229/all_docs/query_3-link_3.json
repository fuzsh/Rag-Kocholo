        "text": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif., June 24—Frank Scully, who wrote the column, “Scully's Scrapbook,” for Variety and turned out a series of “Fun in Bed” books about his experiences as a patient died here yesterday of a heart attack. He was 72 years old and was working at his typewriter when he was stricken.\n\nMr. Scully had reportedly undergone more than 40 operations in the last 30 years for a heart condition, cancer, shrapnel wounds as well as for such things as tonsils, but nevertheless continued an airy career as a professional humorist.\n\nFor most of his adult life, Frank Scully was an invalid, operating on one lung and one leg and in constant pain from osteomyelitis. His physical disabilities, however, hardly diminished the quality of his books, weekly column and acid wit.\n\nOne critic, reviewing Mr. Scully's autobiography, “Cross My Heart,” termed the writer “one of the brightest workmen of the English, or Irish, language.”\n\nIn addition to his column in Variety, Mr. Scully wrote “Fun in Bed,” a series of humorous books, “Just What the Doctor Ordered,” a play, “What Made Alexander Great,” a number of screbnplays and “Behind the Flying Saucers.”\n\nHe also helped Mayor James J. Walker and the Grand Duke Alexander of Russia write their life stories.\n\nIn his columns, books and personal comments, Mr. Scully viewed with casualness and amusement his illnesses and munerous stays in various hospitals. In 1933, Mr. Scully was in New York Hospital at the same time as his wife, who was having a baby.\n\n“True to the N.R.A. (National Recovery Administration),” he said jovially, “I am having three operations at once this time — the tonsils and a new one on the leg.”\n\nMr. Scully was a tall, lean, white‐haired man, who was once described as “having a face on which there is almost ahvays a smile,”\n\nMr. Scully was born in New York, attended the School of Journalism at Columbia University and then worked as a reporter for The New York Sun.\n\nIn the nineteen‐twenties, Mr. Scully was European correspondent for Variety, living in Nice in a mansion called “Villa Variety.” Visitors to the house included such diverse personalities as Mr. Walker, Isadora Duncan, George Bernard Shaw and Frank Harris.\n\nMr. Scully was a “climate chaser,” according to a friend. He had contracted tuberculosis —a disease that took several lives in his family—and fought its attacks periodically through the remainder of his life.\n\nDuring World War I, Mr. Scully received a shrapnel wound in his right leg. A portion of the leg was amputated in 1929.\n\nWhile recuperating, Mr. Scully met his wife, Alice, of whom he wrote: “She was my nurse first, and for that she got 50 francs a month ... and then she became my secretary which got her another 50 francs a month ... and my chauffeur for another 50 francs. It was ruin‐ ing me ... so I married her to save money.”\n\nThey were married in Paris in 1930. They lived briefly in Europe, then moved to Tahiti and finally settled in Hollywood in a house that Mr. Scully named “Bedside Manor,” as a parody on the names bestowed on their mansions by the film stars.\n\nIn Hollywood, Mr. Scully wrote a number of screenplays for 20th Century‐Fox and participated in California politics, running for State Assembly in 1940.\n\nA friend asked Mr. Scully why he wanted to leave his lucrative writing job for the State Assembly.\n\n“I’m not quitting my career as a writer,” he said. “The Legislature only takes three months every two years. If people can’t give that much time to running their countiyl they deserve the dolts who now dominate them, mislead them, loot them, rook them.”\n\n‘Franklin D.’ Scully\n\nMr. Scully, a Democrat, called himself “Franklin D.” Scully during the campaign. He was defeated.\n\nDuring the nineteen‐thirties Mr. Scully was involved in the establishment of the American Newspaper Guild in Los Angeles and led a number of antiNazi demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nAt the time Mr. Scully was labeled a Communist by Congressman Martin Dies, head of the House Un‐American Activities Committee. After a stormy two‐hour session with the Committee, Mr. Scully was cleared of the charge.\n\nMr. Sculley was also embroiled in a controversy in 1950, when his book, “Behind the Flying Saucers,” was published. The book maintained that the “flying saucers” were real, that they came from Venus or other planets and that they were controlled by a magnetic force. The book suffered at the hands of the critics.\n\n“Listen, I’m lucky,” he said recently. “I figure that half the great music in the world, half the great art, the great literature were produced by men who were tortured by some kind of toxemia.”\n\nMr. Scully then recalled his unsuccessful fight for the California State Assembly. He said most organizations had supported him except one—the undertakers. “They held out on me,” Mr. Scully said. “They felt I had cheated them for 30 years.”\n\nIn addition to his widow, he is survived by a son, Thomas J., a lawyer in Los Angeles; 4 daughters, Mrs. Sylvia Frischbery of Portland, Ore., Mrs. Patricia Wilson of San Diego, and the Misses Marguerite and Maurine, students; and 10 grandchildren."
