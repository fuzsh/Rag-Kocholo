REPORT FROM THE CHAIR\n\nFirst, many thanks to all the Section members who did so much to advance our Section last year. Our outgoing Vice-Chair Nancy Bermeo, and our outgoing Secretary, Harry Blair, were terrific, regularly offering sage advice and assuming responsibilities way beyond their job descriptions. In particular, Nancy (working with Jonathan Hartlyn and Nicolas van de Walle) chaired our Nominations Committee; the Committee’s candidates were outstanding, and the election impeccable.\n\nProgram Chair John Harbeson assembled an outstanding array of panels. Participation at our panels was strong, and, as a result, APSA has allocated twenty panels for our Section for 2005, up from eighteen in 2004 and seventeen in 2003. (As we will again in 2005 be consporing a considerable of panels, our total may well top thirty.)\n\nCongratulations to our 2004 award winners: Nancy Bermeo for best book, Quan Li and Rafael Reveny for best article, and Emilia Gioreva for best field work! Further information is available below in minutes of the business meeting.\n\nWe’re very grateful to the Section members who served on our award committees (Chair Richard Vengroff, Sharon Wolchik, and Shaheen Mozaffar, for Best Book; Chair Valerie Bunce, Joseph Klesner, and Gretchen Casper, for Best Article; and Chair Nancy Bermeo, Michael Foley, and Mike Hanshard, for Best Field Work).\n\nNow, we’re busy preparing for 2005 in Washington. We’re confident that many of you are contacting other Section members to propose a panel, or drafting your paper proposal. Don’t forget that all proposals are due to APSA November 14. We are delighted that Eva Bellin (Hunter College) is this year’s program chair; this challenging and pivotal job is in great hands.\n\nAlso, if you have suggestions for plenary speakers, please e-mail me and/or Eva. Especially given that the theme of the overall theme of the 2005 meeting is “Mobilizing Democracy,” we can expect that the APSA Program Committee will be sponsoring plenaries of interest to us. Still, our recommendations could matter, and the earlier we’re in touch with APSA, the better. The Washington venue should facilitate securing participation by major keynoters.\n\nWe’re also assembling our 2005 award committees. Please let me know if you would like to serve, as there are still some openings. The committee for Best Book is: Steve Fish (University of California at Berkeley, Chair), William Case (Griffith University), and Wendy Hunter (University of Texas).\n\nThe committee for Best Article is: Ellen Lust-Okar (Yale University, Chair), Timothy Frye (Ohio State University), and Mark Jones (Rice University). Jonathan Hartlyn (University of North Carolina) will chair our inaugural committee for the Juan Linz Prize for Best Dissertation in the Comparative Study of Democracy. Joseph Klesner (Kenyon College) will chair the committee awarding the prize for Best Field Work.\n\nUnfortunately, to date we have not been able to award a prize for Best Paper presented at APSA the previous year. We very much hope to do so in 2005. Please submit your nominations for Best Paper for 2004 to our 2004 Program Chair, John Harbeson, at jwharbeson@aol.com. If there are sufficient nominations, John will select the winning paper for our Section and also forward the paper to APSA for consideration for APSA’s Burdette Best Paper award. The deadline for nominations is December 15, 2004. I’m very much looking forward to working with our new and continuing Section officers. As I’m sure you’ve noticed, Tom Skladony has been doing a spectacular job compiling and synthesizing information for our newsletter, as well as managing our Web site. Treasurer Bill Reisinger has kept us in the black, and has very efficiently kept tabs on the funds for our Juan Linz Prize. Incoming Secretary Carrie Manning prepared the notes for our 2004 Business Meeting, even though she was not yet officially on board. When we feared that we would need a Section member to present one of the awards at the 2004 business meeting, incoming Vice-Chair Gretchen Casper agreed to pitch in, as she has so often in the past.\n\nTo continue to promote the study of democratization among nations in all regions of the world, we need your support and input. Please don’t forget to send recent syllabi on democratization (either globally or region-specific) for our Web site to tom@ned.org.\n\nAnd please contact me with your thoughts and recommendations for our Section.\n\nCynthia McClintock\n\n3. EDITOR’S NOTE\n\nI am pleased to join Cynthia in expressing my thanks to outgoing section officers Nancy Bermeo and Harry Blair, with whom it has been a great pleasure to work, and in welcoming incoming officers Gretchen Casper and Carrie Manning. I also wish to thank all of you who made the four visiting scholars from Colombia, Ghana, Romania, and South Korea who participated in the roundtable on think-tanks in new democracies at the 2004 APSA meeting feel so welcome at our meeting and reception.\n\nA number of members have written to notify me of changes of e-mail addresses. Please note: the CompDem Section does not maintain a database of its membership. The APSA maintains all section membership lists. Shortly before publishing each newsletter, we obtain the latest membership file from the APSA, and we use the e-mail addresses in that file to mail you this newsletter. To change your e-mail address (or any other contact information), you must log in to the members’ section of the APSA Web site (www.apsanet.org/member/) and make your changes there.\n\nAs always, this newsletter includes a long listing of recent journal articles on democracy. I am pleased to note that in the next several months these articles (and those from previous issues) will become available as part of a larger database of democracy research that will be available on the Web site of the International Forum for Democratic Studies. This database will also include links to many historical and current documents, books, and other scholarly resources on democracy. And it will permit searches by author, subject, country or region, journal, date of publication, and other fields.\n\nFinally, it gives me great pleasure to thank David Ben-Nun and Sarah King, interns at the International Forum, for their expert work in compiling and proofreading this issue of the newsletter\n\nTom Skladony\n\n4. SECTION NEWS\n\nProposing a Paper or Panel for the 2005 APSA Annual Meeting: As in 2004 the APSA will use an online system for submitting paper and panel proposals for the 2005 annual meeting in Washington, D.C. For complete information visit www.apsanet.org/mtgs/divisions/index.cfm and click on “Proposal Submission Guide.”\n\nThe overall theme of the 2005 meeting is “Mobilizing Democracy,” and thus we should expect that many other organized sections will sponsor panels on democracy; all the more reason for the Comparative Democratization Section to offer an exceptionally robust range of panels. Toward that end, program chair Eva Bellin (Hunter College) encourages panel and paper submissions that demonstrate methodological diversity, that explore the institutional, cultural, social, structural, or institutional determinants of democracy, and that explore the explanatory range of each of these across time and/or space. All paper or panel proposals must be submitted through the APSA Web site by November 14, 2004 at 12:00 midnight Eastern Time.\n\nReport on the 2004 APSA Meeting: The Comparative Democratization Section sponsored or cosponsored twenty-seven panels at the 2004 APSA annual meeting in Chicago. For a listing visit www.apsanet.org/mtgs/program/divisions.cfm and scroll down to Section 45. Papers presented at the meeting are available at http://archive.allacademic.com/publication/browse.php.\n\nThe Section’s annual business meeting and reception were held on Saturday evening, September 4. Highlights of the meeting included the installation of new officers; the awarding of prizes for the best book, article, and field work; and the announcement of the launching of the Juan Linz Prize for Best Dissertation in Comparative Study of Democracy. For complete details see the minutes prepared by Carrie Manning (Georgia State University) and the statement of Juan Linz, below.\n\nMinutes of the Annual Business Meeting, September 4, 2004\n\nWelcome to the meeting. Section president Cynthia McClintock (George Washington U.) called the meeting to order and thanked the officers of the section for their work during the year. The meeting was held at 6 p.m. in Boulevard B of the Chicago Hilton Hotel, and was attended by approximately 45 people.\n\nPrevious minutes. Minutes of the 2003 meeting were distributed at the beginning of the meeting.\n\nTreasurer愀 report. Section treasurer Bill Reisinger (U. of Iowa) gave the report on the section’s finances. We have collected $2,120 in section dues. After subtracting expenses for the reception, the speaker at this year’s meeting, and prize money, the section ends the year with a net balance of $1,017.15. In addition, the section has collected roughly $12,000 in donations to the Juan Linz fund to endow the section’s prize for best dissertation. Anyone interested in making a donation to the fund should contact Bill.\n\nVisiting scholars. Tom Skladony (NED) introduced this year’s visiting scholars, whose attendance at the annual meeting was once again sponsored by the National Endowment for Democracy. The Comparative Democratization section sponsored a roundtable, “Bridging the Gap,” at the APSA meeting, bringing together four scholars representing think tanks from a network of democratic research institutes supported by NED. The visiting scholars were from Korea, Romania, Ghana, and Colombia.\n\nOLD BUSINESS\n\nChair’s report. Cynthia McClintock reported that membership in the section was steady at around 620 members. The section sponsored or cosponsored 27 panels at this year’s meeting. Three issues of the section’s electronic newsletter, put together by Tom Skladony, were issued since last year’s meeting, in October, January, and June. January’s newsletter featured the first bibliographic review essays on democracy in a particular region, an essay by John Harbeson (CUNY) on Africa. The section plans a series of these essays by section members. Cynthia also pointed out that the section Web site is up and past issues of the newsletter can be found there. An appeal was made for members to post their syllabi for both general and region-specific courses relevant to the section theme. These should be emailed to Tom Skladony at tom@ned.org.\n\nProgram chair’s report. This year’s program chair, John Harbeson, noted with satisfaction that the percentage of papers and panels submitted to the section by graduate students was very high. He said that 22 panel propsals were received and 10 accepted. 150 individual paper proposals were submitted. John urged section members to attend the section’s sponsored panels at next year’s annual meeting, as attendance counts toward the following year’s allotment of sponsored panels for the section.\n\nNext year’s program chair Eva Bellin (Hunter College) pointed out that next year’s APSA meeting theme is comparative democratization. She appealed for panel and paper submissions for next year’s conference and especially welcomed panel submissions that demonstrate methodological diversity, that explore the institutional, cultural, social, structural, or institutional determinants of democracy, and that explore the explanatory range of each of these across time and/or space.\n\nNewsletter. Tom Skladony appealed to members for news items and for more volunteers to write book notes or bibliographic review essays. He said that the News from Members section was working well, and noted that a good bit of information on fellowship and job opportunities had been passed along. He asked whether there was interest among members in posting exchanges of queries and requests for all section members. Finally, Tom pointed out that the mailing list for the newsletter is given to the section by APSA from APSA’s list of dues-paying members for the section. New mailing lists are sent from APSA for every new mailing. Anyone who is not receiving the newsletter should get in touch with Tom.\n\nBest book award. The award for best book on comparative democratization was presented to Nancy Bermeo for her book, Ordinary People in Extraordinary Times: The Citizenry and the Breakdown of Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2003). Richard Vengroff (U. Connecticut) chaired the panel and presented the award. The other members of the panel were Sharon Wolchik (George Washington U.), and Shaheen Mozaffar (Bridgewater State College).\n\nBest article award. The section’s award for best article was presented to Quan Li (Penn State) and Rafael Reuveny (Indiana) for “Economic Globalization and Democracy: An Empirical Analysis.” Val Bunce (Cornell, committee chair), who presented the award, worked with Joseph Klesner (Kenyon College) and Gretchen Casper (Penn State) on the selection panel.\n\nBest field work award. The prize for best field work was awarded for the first time this year, in an effort to reward and encourage graduate students to undertake field work. The selection committee included Nancy Bermeo (Princeton, chair), Michael Foley (Catholic U.) and Mike Hanshard (Northwestern U.). Emilia Gioreva, a Ph.D. candidate from the University of Florida supervised by Leslie Anderson, earned the award for field work on rural women in Bulgaria and Ecuador.\n\nBest dissertation prize. The first Juan Linz Prize for Best Dissertation in the Comparative Study of Democracy will be awarded at next year’s annual meeting. Larry Diamond (Hoover Institution) described the section’s success in getting the Linz prize up and running, and provided details on the award, which will consider dissertations in the area of comparative democratization that examine the transitions, consolidation, breakdowns, and crises of democracy. The work may compare different countries, or apply theoretical and comparative insights to single case studies. It must be empirical but contribute to the advancement of theory. This is the 10th endowed prize to be established by a section of the APSA. Larry gave an overview of Linz’s career, emphasizing his work with graduate students. Jonathan Hartlyn (UNC Chapel Hill) then read a statement from Juan Linz thanking the section for the honor.\n\nNEW BUSINESS\n\nNew officers. Cynthia McClintock announced the installation of the section’s new officers: Gretchen Casper (Penn State) as vice chair and Carrie Manning (Georgia State U.) as secretary.\n\nNew proposals. There was a brief discussion of the fact that APSA itself does not have competitive elections for its leadership positions. This was followed by calls for the section to back a nominee for the APSA Council.\n\nShaheen Mozzaffar proposed that the section consider offering its members a discounted rate for a subscription to the Journal of Democracy as part of section dues. Larry Diamond and Marc Plattner said they would look into the possibilities, but Larry said he preferred to make a discounted subscription an option to members, if possible, rather than to add it automatically to section dues.\n\nThe section meeting adjourned at 7 pm for the annual reception, cosponsored by the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\nCarrie Manning, Section Secretary Statement of Juan Linz on the Announcement of the Juan Linz Dissertation Prize\n\nAt its business meeting on September 5, 2004 the Comparative Democratization Section of the American Political Science Association announced the inauguration of the Juan Linz Prize for Best Dissertation in the Comparative Study of Democracy, to be awarded beginning in 2005. Professor Linz, who could not be present at the meeting, sent the statement below, which was read by Jonathyn Hartlyn (UNC/Chapel Hill).\n\nI regret very much not to be here with many former students, colleagues, and friends who are meeting to announce the dissertation prize that has been created in my name. I am moved by their initiative and decision and want to express to them, the Section on democratization, and APSA, my heartfelt thanks. I am sure the prize will stimulate and reward students to make great contributions to the themes mentioned in the announcement.\n\nIt is not only a honour but a great pleasure since I always have considered directing dissertations a most important and pleasing part of my academic life. I am also happy that the prize is working on democracy in all its variety, its successes and failures, a topic on which my students have done outstanding dissertations and to which I have devoted much of my work since preparing in 1950 a presentation at a colloquium at a French Science Po student summer camp based on the classic work of Hans Kelsen. My essay on Robert Michels, the work on the breakdown of democracy, the research on the Spanish transition to democracy, and the book with Alfred Stepan on transitions and consolidations are part of that continuing interest. More recently, my focus has been on the types of democratic regimes: presidentialism and now federalism and democracy. There is much work to be done on democratic institutions and their consequences, on the selection of democratic political elites, the tensions between their responsiveness and responsibility, the quality of democracy, without limiting attention to participation, the limits of what democracy can do in the government of states and the “fragility” of democracy.\n\nI feel that there is an urgent need to do serious empirical and theoretically oriented research on how democracies work in many countries, both country and comparative studies. We need to go beyond the worldwide analysis of conditions for and performance of democracies and microanalysis of specific institutions in advanced democracies that tend to dominate the field. I find that we know too little. The task involves keeping distinct the implications of democratic political processes from the performance of states, their bureaucracies, and their economies, without ignoring the linkages with the more specific democratic institutions and processes of democratization. The study of democratic politics should not become dominated by the political economy of democratic countries. We have to know what difference does democracy make, what it can do and what it fails to do. The failures of democracies lead to breakdowns which are not only the results of the strength or cunning of their antagonists, but of the failures or low quality of democratic leadership. We need to know more about by what processes, in which institutional setting, such leaders have obtained power democratically and exercise it.\n\nAlthough I tend to believe that the majority of voters rarely destroy democracies and generally make reasonable decisions, we should ask ourselves why they make choices detrimental to democracy. Certainly, institutions frame and limit their choices, for example referenda, in undesirable ways, but there are signs of deterioration of the “quality” of voters we cannot ignore. Politicians responsive to such voters rather than changing-educating-their preferences, should resist to respond to such an electorate. I have devoted much effort to public opinion research, but increasingly find it disturbing that politicians should respond to and follow public opinion rather than shaping the political discourse, educating the voters, and making them aware of the complexity of issues.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough the “fragility” of democracy. I hope that future holders of the prize will contribute to our knowledge and understanding of the questions I have raised.\n\nAnd again, thanks for the initiative, the efforts, the generosity, of so many friends and the honour. Best wishes to future recipients, I hope they will enjoy their work as much as I did.\n\nJuan J. Linz\n\nHamden, August 29, 2004\n\n5.

For selected online articles and the tables of contents of all Journal issues, visit www.journalofdemocracy.org.\n\n“Latin American Presidencies Interrupted” by Arturo Valenzuela\n\nOver the last two decades, Latin America has seen more than a dozen presidencies come to a premature end. It is time to consider changing constitutional designs that promote conflict rather than more consensual ways of doing politics.\n\nThe Quality of Democracy\n\nI. “An Overview” by Larry Diamond and Leonardo Morlino\n\nSince most of the world’s sovereign states are now democracies, there is a growing scholarly focus on “good” or “better” democracy, and on how improvements can not only be measured, but encouraged.\n\nII. “Why the Rule of Law Matters” by Guillermo O’Donnell\n\nLaw-based rule means a set of basic conditions that make civic life possible. A democratic rule of law requires all that and more, however.\n\nIII. “The Ambiguous Virtues of Accountability” by Philippe C. Schmitter\n\nA key to “modern representative political democracy” is accountability, but the task of assessing it must be carefully thought through.\n\nIV. “Freedom as the Foundation” by David Beetham\n\nFreedom has always been integral to democracy. How to guard liberty is a question every democratic regime must answer.\n\nV. “Addressing Inequality” by Dietrich Rueschemeyer\n\nDemocracy requires robust political equality, but the persistence of social, economic, and cultural inequality complicates its realization.\n\nVI. “The Chain of Responsiveness” by G. Bingham Powell, Jr.\n\nResponsiveness may be conceived as a series of linkages intended to ensure that governments respect the preferences of the governed.\n\nVII. “A Skeptical Afterword” by Marc F. Plattner\n\nAsking what makes a good democracy is a noble and sensible enterprise, but it will always point beyond the borders of empirical political science.\n\n“Philippine Politics and the Rule of Law” by Steven Rogers\n\nGloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s election as president in her own right capped a campaign that spoke well of Philippine democracy, but yawning gaps in the rule of law obstruct the road to consolidation.\n\nDebate\n\nI. “The Persistence of Arab Authoritarianism” by Burhan Ghalioun\n\nThe lack of democracy in the Arab world is a problem that goes far beyond the absence of competitive elections. This lack must be traced not to religion or culture, but to adverse historical and geostrategic circumstances.\n\nII. “The Reality of Muslim Exceptionalism” by Sanford Lakoff\n\nThe notion that the Muslim world as a whole does not suffer from a deficit in terms of competitive democracy is appealing, but rests on evidence and assumptions that cannot withstand critical scrutiny.\n\nIII. “Arab, Not Muslim, Exceptionalism” by Alfred Stepan and Gramem B. Robertson\n\nMuslim-majority, non-Arab countries are “overachievers” at electoral competitiveness. Arab countries, by contrast, constitute a distinctive political community that at present is inhospitable to competitive elections.\n\n“The ‘Alternation’ Effect in Africa” by Michael Bratton\n\nSurveys show that Africans’ commitment to democracy fades over time, but also that their support can be refreshed by alternations in power via elections.\n\n“Stolen Elections: The Case of the Serbian October” by Mark R. Thompson and Philipp Kuntz\n\nSlobodan Milo塄vi? fell in the fall of 2000 after he tried to pervert national elections results. He had tempered with elections before and survived. What made 2000 different, and what are the lessons to be learned from it?\n\nSELECTED JOURNAL ARTICLES ON DEMOCRACY\n\nThis section of the newsletter features selected articles that appeared in journals received by the NED’s Democracy Resource Center.\n\nAmerican Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, Vol. 21, no. 2, Spring 2004\n\n“In Search of Islamic Constitutionalism” by Nadirsyah Hosen\n\n“Challenging Authoritarianism, Colonialism, and Disunity: The Islamic Political Reform Movements of al-Afghani and Rida” by Ahmed Ali Salem\n\nAsian Ethnicity, Vol. 5, no. 3, October 2004\n\n“Democratisation and the Dilemma of Nation-building in Post-Suharto Indonesia: The Case of Aceh” by Aleksius Jemadu\n\nAsian Survey, Vol. XLIV, no. 2, March/April 2004\n\n“Southeast Asia in a New Era: Domestic Coalitions from Crisis to Recovery” by Etel Solingen\n\n“Leadership Transition, Intra-Party Democracy, and Institution Building in China” by Gang Lin\n\nCambridge Review of International Affairs, Vol. 17, no. 2, July 2004\n\n“Governance in Central Asia: National in Form, Soviet in Content” by E.
