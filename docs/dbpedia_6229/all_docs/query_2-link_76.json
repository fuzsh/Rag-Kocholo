Here’s our process.\n\nMedical News Today only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.\n\nOur team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we:\n\nEvaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm?\n\nFact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence?\n\nAssess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices?\n\nWe do the research so you can find trusted products for your health and wellness.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nMouth ulcers are painful areas in the mouth and gums. They are also known as canker sores. Mouth ulcers range in size, and the exact symptoms of the mouth ulcer will depend on what type of ulcer a person has.\n\nWhile mostly harmless, mouth ulcers can be extremely uncomfortable and make it difficult for some people to eat, drink, and brush their teeth.\n\nFast facts on mouth ulcers:\n\nMost mouth ulcers are recurring nuisances that are benign.\n\nQuitting smoking and acidic foods can aggravate mouth ulcers.\n\nIt is important to note that a doctor or dentist should examine any new ulcer and any ulcer lasting longer than 3 weeks.\n\nFor most people, mouth ulcers will clear up within 2 weeks.\n\nThe exact cause of mouth ulcers is still not known and varies from person-to-person. Still, there are some common causes and several factors that may aggravate mouth ulcers, including the following:\n\nquitting smoking\n\ncitrus fruits and other foods high in acidity or spice\n\nbiting the tongue or inside of the cheek\n\nbraces, poor-fitting dentures, and other apparatus that may rub against the mouth and gums\n\na deficient filling\n\nstress or anxiety\n\nhormonal changes during pregnancy, puberty, and menopause\n\nmedications including beta-blockers and pain killers\n\ngenetic factors\n\nSome people may develop ulcers as a result of a different medical condition or a nutritional deficiency.\n\nConditions such as celiac or Crohn’s disease, vitamin B12 or iron deficiency, or a weakened immune system may all trigger ulcers to form.\n\nAre mouth ulcers cancerous?\n\nMouth cancer and mouth ulcers are distinctive in their symptoms. However, as mentioned earlier, new or persistent ulcers require checking.\n\nThere are some fundamental differences between mouth ulcers and what might be cancer:\n\nMouth ulcers are often painful whereas mouth cancer is not.\n\nMouth ulcers will clear up in about 2 weeks, whereas mouth cancer will not go away and will often spread.\n\nMouth cancer patches may be rough, hard, and not easy to scrape off.\n\nMouth cancer is often a mix of red and white areas or large white areas that appear on the tongue, the back of the mouth, the gums, or on the cheeks.\n\nMouth cancer is often linked to heavy drinking or tobacco use.\n\nIn many cases, the pain and discomfort from mouth ulcers will lessen in a few days and then disappear in about 2 weeks with no need for treatment.\n\nFor people with much more painful or frequent recurrence of mouth ulcers, a dentist may prescribe a solution to reduce swelling and lessen pain.\n\nAlso, a dentist may prescribe an antimicrobial mouthwash or an ointment to be applied directly to the infected patch. This can help to ease discomfort. Various mouth ulcer treatments are also available to purchase online.\n\nStandard ulcers appear on the inner cheeks and last for about 1 week. Most are harmless and clear up with no medical intervention.\n\nThere are three main types of mouth ulcers. These include:\n\nHerpetiform ulceration (HU)\n\nHerpetiform ulcers are a subtype of aphthous ulcers and get their name because they resemble the sores associated with herpes. Unlike herpes, HU is not contagious. HU ulcers recur very quickly, and it may appear that the condition never gets better.\n\nMinor ulcers\n\nThis type can range in size from about 2 millimeters (mm) up to 8 mm across. These ulcers typically take up to 2 weeks to get better and will cause minor pain.\n\nMajor ulcers\n\nBigger than minor ulcers, major ulcers are often irregular in shape, may be raised, and penetrate deeper into the tissue than minor ulcers. They can take several weeks to go away and are likely to leave scar tissue when they clear.\n\nUlcers can be painful, and the pain can be made worse by food, drink, and poor oral hygiene.\n\nHU lesions may:\n\nappear as extremely painful ulcers in the mouth\n\nrecur very quickly, so infections seem continuous\n\nincrease in size, eventually coming together to form a large, ragged ulcer\n\ntake 10 or more days to heal\n\nappear anywhere in the mouth\n\nThey tend to be found in more females than males and are more common in older adults.\n\nSymptoms of minor and major ulcers include:\n\none or more painful sores that may appear on the cheeks, the roof of the mouth, or the tongue\n\nthe appearance of round lesions that have red edges and are yellow, white, or gray in the middle\n\nDuring more extreme outbreaks of mouth ulcers, some people may experience fever, sluggishness, and swollen glands.\n\nPeople who frequently get mouth ulcers may find it difficult to know when to see a doctor.\n\nThere are some situations, however, where a person should see a doctor as soon as possible. Some of these circumstances include:\n\nthe appearance of a non-painful ulcer in one or more areas of the mouth\n\nunusual ulcers that appear in a new spot in the mouth\n\nulcers that are spreading\n\nulcers lasting longer than 3 weeks.\n\nOthers may want to seek medical attention or treatment for their ulcers if:\n\nthey are particularly painful or big\n\na fever appears\n\nthey develop after starting a new medication\n\nsecondary bacterial infections\n\nMouth ulcers have no known cure and typically recur in the mouth throughout a person’s life.\n\nThough the appearance of an ulcer may be inevitable, there are some things people can do to lessen the severity of or reduce the number of times they suffer from an outbreak.\n\nSome prevention methods include:\n\ntalking to a doctor about changing medications that are known to cause ulcers\n\navoiding foods that can either trigger or worsen symptoms\n\nkeeping the mouth clean with daily brushing and flossing\n\navoiding triggers known to cause outbreaks in the past"
