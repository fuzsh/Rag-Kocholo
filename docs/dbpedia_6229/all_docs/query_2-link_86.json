PUBLISHER'S NOTE We are publishing Behind The Flying Saucers because we believe it to be an exciting, timely, and straightforward interpretation of one of the strangest phenomenon in modern times. It is obvious, of course, that any discussion of flying saucers from whatever point of view is bound to be controversial. This book is no exception, for Frank Scully's conclusions as to the nature of these craft differ sharply from those held officially by the Department of Defense. However, we are as convinced as any thoughtful publisher can be that Mr. Scully has approached his subject with probity and has interpreted the facts and figures given him with care and caution. In writing this book he has had extensive interviews and assistance from scientists and other experts in such fields as magnetic energy, astronomy, and aerodynamics men who are reputedly high in their profession but some of whose names, as will be apparent in reading this book, must be kept anonymous. We, like most people, including Mr. Scully, have never seen a flying saucer. But from the mass of evidence as reported in the press and magazines by reputable persons, there is much reason to believe that they actually do exist. What they are, where they come from, or how they fly, we do not presume to know. Mr. Scully attempts to answer some of these questions and we're sure that you'll find his answers both fascinating and provocative. We did. AUTHOR'S PREFACE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE and government today lies a double standard of morality. Anything remotely scientific has become by government definition a matter of military security first; hence of secrecy, something which does not breed security but fear. If we see anything unusual, even in the skies, we the people must either freeze our lips, like a Russian peasant at the sight of a commissar, or give our names, addresses, business connections, and testimony to be screened and filtered by anonymous intelligence officers.\n\nFeared and respected by many people, these anonymous creatures can deny what we say, ridicule what we say, and sometimes (and in an increasing number of countries) jail us for what we say especially if our timing does not match to the second their intended official pronouncements on the subject. Just as the communists have made a god of their Uncle Joe, we have begun to deify our faceless spokesman. Both should be fought by free men as word oppressors. Without going into it at too great a length, this all ties up with the loss of faith in formal religion, which forces people to cling to the New Sublimation. The only way for a free people to fight such encroachments on free inquiry is to say in advance, \"What I am telling you will be denied,\" or \"This is true but those who say so now will be branded as dreamers, and if they persist, as liars.\" It completely destroys American sportsmanship standards when we, the people, stick to the rules while an opposing team of censors who have usurped our rights are permitted, by their own handpicked referee, to pull rabbit-punches on defensive play, hamstring us from the rear if we seem to be running well in an open field, and even machinegun the ball in midair if we are kicking an almost certain field goal. There is only one thing to do under such a setup. Expose their tactics. Show that more offenses are committed under the word \"defense\" than this world dreams of. Insist that what we say is the whole truth, and what they say is not the whole truth. That may seem a dreadful way to treat our own flesh and blood, our commissioned sons who have been trained for combat but have been assigned in peacetime to espionage and counter espionage. But since our sons in uniform do not report to us, the people, but to Central Intelligence (which as far as we can make out reports to nobody and is answerable to nobody), how otherwise can we get our current findings to our own friends? Scientists believe they have suffered more than any other group from the postwar loyalty hysteria but writers cannot be far behind them. The \"thread of intolerance\" which runs through our history has now become as thick as a noose to hang us. Under the circumstances, to write a book, knowing not only that you will be ridiculed, but also knowing who will do the ridiculing, and not have a counteroffensive ready, is to be starry eyed and unrealistic. Rather than be rated dreamers by such obvious interior proof that we are dreamers, it is a good deal smarter to swing first and say that all bureaucrats, whether in tweeds or bogged down with salad dressing, are incompetent time servers, hanging on the public payroll till pensioned or rewarded with a stuffed shirt job in private enterprise (privately endowed universities, naturally, included) and are truth trimmers to boot.\n\nIn order to regain this lost freedom we will have to say \"a pox on both your houses\" and cease to be brushed off by the perpetual hocus-pocus involved in such phrases of these spokes men as \"top secret,\" \"secret and confidential,\" \"restricted,\" and, \"withheld for reasons of security.\" Such brush-offs are almost invariably followed by a statement from another department of the defense arm, that what we are hiding isn't really worth concealing, that we are defended by old and obsolete equipment, and that, finally, unless we grant them an additional billion dollars for new equipment overnight, we are dead ducks, saucers or no saucers! Propaganda has made trueâ€”and--false practically obsolete in our language. In fact, if a spokesman has served time in intelligence, it may fairly be said, the truth is no longer in him. Spies cannot even buy or sell lies with skill. If so, why are they being arrested all over the world and almost invariably getting a sentence of fifteen years? Has that become the fair trade practices act on the international level? Perhaps it would be clearer to readers if I illustrated with a few samples of this dismal wallpaper pattern. On June 24, 1947, businessman Kenneth Arnold of Boise, Idaho, flying his own plane, first reported he had seen several flying saucers in the area of Mt. Rainier, Washington. Reports of other saucers from other areas followed. Then on August 9, Lieutenant Colonel Donald Springer, assistant to the chief of staff of the Fourth Air Force, decided to stop the nonsense. Despite the fact that his command had an unsolved mystery on its hands concerning molten material claimed to have fallen on Maury Island, and the death of two army pilots who were transporting the material for further examination, Colonel Springer said, as far as he was concerned, there was no basis for belief in flying disks in the Tacoma area \"or any other.\" Newspapers took this as some sort of hint and piped down on the subject. With what result? That by January, 1948, six months after Colonel Springer's dismissal of the subject, the Pentagon set up Project Saucer to investigate the hundreds of reports that had been coming in. Fate devoted almost half of its first issue to flying saucers and led off with an article by Kenneth Arnold entitled \"I Did See The Flying Disks.\" Project Saucer proceeded in a quiet unhysterical way for eighteen months before issuing even a preliminary report. The Saturday Evening Post apparently got the idea that the report was going to be negative, so it had Sidney Shalett prepare two articles on the subject for almost simultaneous release with the Air Force report. The articles turned out to be rather long winded recapitulations of various flying saucer case histories previously explored, and the general impression left after reading them was that believers in the actuality of flying saucers appeared as not quite bright. Shalett's first article appeared in the Post issue dated April 30; the second, May 7. The April 30 issue was on the newsstands several days before April 30, of course. In fact, it was on sale when the Air Force issued its April 27 preliminary report. The Air Force\n\nreport crossed up the Post. This was in line with the pattern I have previously outlined of making fools of collaborators. Far from confirming Colonel Springer or the Post, the official report held that there was something to the flying saucer stories after all. It even entertained the idea that the saucers might be from another planet. It left many of its case histories with no solution, as far as this earth or Air Force Intelligence was concerned, but promised more light on these later. Having thus proceeded to lure the Post into \"fronting\" for a negative approach, the Air Force proceeded to accentuate the positive. This naturally opened the door to those rival editors who thought they saw a new trend. True magazine figured it could cash in on the Post's loss of face. Its publisher, editor, and a contributor reassembled much of the Fate and Post material and told the tale again, except that instead of casting doubt on all believers in aerial disks, True followed an older party line established by Fate in the spring of 1948 and declared in December, 1949, \"Flying Saucers Are Real.\" Hardly had True's copies reached the newsstands when Air Force Intelligence denied True's position from beginning to end. Its spokesman announced on December 27, 1949, that Project Saucer had been closed. It classified believers in flying saucers practically as psychopaths or hoaxers. It left no other way open as an escape hatch for True or anybody else. This Machiavellian pattern of inflating and deflating those who agreed or disagreed with the military on flying saucers continued and was not likely to be altered even if, and when, the whole truth came out. The formula seemed to be: \"Play ball with us and we'll let you have it between the eyes.\" Though I have not the slightest interest in what the military may or may not say about this book, I want my readers to under stand my position. I have never seen a flying saucer. I have never had a hallucination that I have seen a flying saucer. I have never joined in any mass hysteria on the subject, and to the best of my knowledge and belief I have never participated in the perpetration of a hoax on flying saucers. I have talked to men of science who have told me they have not only seen them but have worked on several. I have tried to the best of my ability to find flaws in their stories. But to date I have not succeeded in placing them in any of the three categories laid down by the Air Force. Scientists do not want to go to war with the Army over the issue. They have to get essential materials for research, and certain branches of the Department of Defense might find it difficult to find such essential materials for scientists who will not cooperate. Do they make themselves clear? Is it any wonder therefore that I advise readers to treat any official comment as no more to be considered than old news papers blowing in the wind? In fact, if such faceless men\n\nshould say that the objects are (a) newspapers or (b) not newspapers but fragments of flying saucers, they are not to be believed either way. Not until we, the people, we who, have names, addresses, and the courage of our convictions, not until we say there are such things as flying saucers, is it authentic. And we have been saying it for sometime. Now read Behind The Flying Saucers and throw in the fire unread all the Pentagonic denials from this day forward. Decoration Day 1950\n\nFrank Scully\n\n=============================================================== =========== Author: Frank Scully Title: BEHIND THE FLYING SAUCERS Section: Chapter 1 Format: Book Publication Year: 1950 Digitizer: Bufo Calvin Collection: OPUS On-line Library (http://www.opus-net.org/) Comment: Paragraphing formatting, hyphenation, and indenting has been changed to make the text file more legible. The Mystery of The University of Denver AS THE SECOND HALF of the twentieth century began, three things experienced strange news emphasis. Two practically did not exist for The New York Times. The third, which did not actually exist at the time for anybody, was featured for months in this great newspaper as well as all others. The two that had practically no news value to The New York Times were numerous reports of the presence of flying saucers over our mainland, and the birth of Ingrid Bergman's baby in Italy. The third item had not been verified as anything more than a terrifying nightmare, and many of the scientists who were expected to turn it into a reality were not sure that it would work if, and when, made. That was the hydrogen bomb. But to the newspapers, without exception, the unmade bomb was un fait accompli. It is hard to believe that to all people living in the spring of 1950 this thermonuclear monster was already a reality, while to the majority flying saucers, either from here or elsewhere, remained the stuff' of which dreams are made. A bomb which might destroy fifty times as many persons as did the atomic bomb released over Hiroshima, in the process of construction, was of course news. But it certainly had less reality in 1950 than the stockpile of stories about flying saucers in our atmosphere and possibly on our soil. Such a story, if true, might well be among the greatest stories told since the creation of the world. It would seem that, if a choice had to be made, almost any government surviving on deficit-spending or lend-lease, or even on the sweat of its people, would\n\ndecide to budget millions for studying interplanetary space ships, rather than to spend the same amount making bombs which could contribute nothing new to man's knowledge and understanding of this world or any other. Yet given such a choice, at least one government chose to close down a Project Saucer after two years of researching on a modest budget and report that its Air Force had traced most reports of unidentified flying objects to: 1. Misinterpretation of various conventional objects, 2. A mild form of mass hysteria, 3. Or hoaxes. Its unidentified spokesman briefly explained that the project had been established two years previously at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, headquarters of Air Materiel Command. \"Since that time\" [January, 1948] \"some 375 incidents have been reported and investigated,\" the report concluded. \"Assisting special investigators were scientific consultants from universities and other governmental agencies.\" No names of investigators, consultants, or colleges were mentioned. Indeed between that brief dismissal and a fairly long report of six months previously which, despite its length, left 34 of 375 incidents still unsolved (even to the Air Force's satisfaction) the 34 unsolved mysteries were closed out without any explanations whatever. If they were ever solved at all they remained top secret to all but the military. Yet hardly had Project Saucer's final press release been printed when a series of reports on flying saucers began bombarding newspapers from every corner of the Western World. As the government's project was closed, the bearers of these tidings had nowhere to go except to their local newspapers. There had been an entente cordiale between the press and the Department of Defense to ignore these stories during the two years of the Air Force's official inquiry. But when the Air Force pulled out, the floodgates opened. Some newspapers continued to throw flying saucers into their wastebaskets. Others broke down under the persistent barrage of reader reports and reader interest. By Easter time every radio commentator of any standing, every comedian, every legislator, every televisable personality, even The New York Times, had had his or her say. Walter Winchell was sure he had had it first and that the missiles were from Russia. Henry J. Taylor had tried his hand twice. His version was that the saucers were American, not Russian. He assured his listeners his elaborate radio accounts of the authenticity of flying saucers contained only half the story, and when the rest was released by the armed forces it would be good news tonight. In fact, he sounded more like Gabriel Heatter than Henry J. Taylor. David Lawrence threw all the prestige of his U. S. News and World Report behind the believers in the reality of flying saucers and said they were \"a revolutionary type, a combination of helicopter and a fast jet plane.\" Even the President had to be dragged out of his Key West retreat to blow that one down. Eleanor Roosevelt had interviewed Captain Jack Adams and First Officer G. W. Anderson, two veteran pilots of the Chicago and Southern Airlines. They reported the flying saucer they had seen over Arkansas, which they insisted was not a visitor from another planet but a secret experimental type aircraft and not jet-propelled either. Walter Kieran said he wished Drew Pearson would confirm the story and get it over with. \"I'm willing to believe it,\" he added. But a week before Kieran's broadcast Drew Pearson had confirmed it. Fulton Lewis, Jr. had aired his version. Bob Hope, Red Skelton, Fibber\n\nMcGee and Molly, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Amos 'n' Andy, and, of course, Jack Benny had also kicked the saucer around. Everybody, including Jimmy Durante, had got into the act. But the real inside story had been missed by all of them. It happened on March 8, 1950, in Denver, Colorado. On that day at 12:30 P.M. 350 students of the University of Denver skipped lunch to hear a confidential scientific discourse delivered by what the press described later as \"an unidentified middle-aged lecturer.\" He delivered what was probably the most sensational lecture about this earth or any other planet since Galileo said, \"It moves!\" He gave the whole inside story of a flying saucer which he said had landed within 500 miles of where he was now talking, and he described the space ship and its personnel in such detail that the undergraduates and faculty members left the lecture room with their heads spinning. Such is the nature of man's distorted sense of curiosity, however, that who the lecturer was soon began to overshadow what he had said. He, not the flying saucer, became the mystery that had to be solved by the students first. It was recalled some hours later that the lecturer had been escorted by one George T. Koehler of 315 Franklin, Denver 3, Colorado, a staff member of an independent Rocky Mountain radio station, with the call letters of KMYR. It was commented upon by those faculty members who attended the lecture that Koehler never introduced the lecturer by name to anybody. (But the lecturer later explained to me that the professor whose job it was to guard the speaker's anonymity in his introduction certainly knew who he was.) Before beginning the main body of his talk, the lecturer explained that he would purposely have to leave out certain names, dates, and places, and must not be asked about them, as some of the scientists were working on security projects, and therefore were not free to talk even about such flying saucers as they were reported to have examined personally. With that even the professors got out their notebooks. He talked like a faculty member who knew how to time his well-considered words so that the scribbling students would not fall off at the first turn. He spaced his revelations, which at the end of the lecture were described as \"startling,\" \"sensational,\" \"spellbinding,\" and \"electrifying,\" by the majority; and \"absurd,\" \"ridiculous,\" and \"unbelievable,\" by the minority. In actual figures his lecture, which took 50 minutes, left about 40 per cent of his audience still with their mystery. The lecture was arranged for students of a basic science class, on the condition that it was not to be publicized. But from a group of 90 students, the gathering had grown, by grapevine, to a capacity audience. Professors of astronomy and engineering, as well as their students, piled in. There wasn't even standing room only. The negotiations between the faculty and the spokesman for the lecturer took months to arrange, as the speaker wasn't keen about being \"evaluated,\" but when the science students voted 100 per cent to hear the lecturer, he acquiesced. Of these, 80 per cent said, after the lecture, that they were \"impressed.\" By a show of hands 60 per cent indicated they believed the man knew what he was talking about, that he obviously was a member of the group of scientists he described as having examined space ships which had landed on this earth from, in all likelihood, another planet. More, they believed the mystery man of science had the best answer to the secret of propulsion behind these flying saucers and that it was neither combustion nor jet.\n\nAnother poll taken later reduced the college-bred believers in this staggering story from 60 per cent to 50 per cent. This was considerably higher than the over-all credence in flying saucers. According to a nation-wide survey by the United Press, one out of every four believed the objects were real ships. Actually 26 per cent believed they were and 8 per cent weren't sure. The rest agreed with the Air Force spokesman who said they were hallucinations, mass hysteria, or hoaxes. These would include those members of the University of Denver faculty who thought their speaker's performance was at best a very good act. It would also include those who suspected it was a hoax played on the fair name of a proud university. But all agreed that the mysterious stranger talked as plausibly, as conservatively, and as scientifically as Einstein, Oppenheimer, or Busch might have talked if placed in the position of presenting equally sensational revelations to an equally skeptical audience. After the mysterious scientist had been plied for fifteen minutes with questions, George Koehler cried: \"Great Scott, we have to get out of here! You have only twenty minutes to catch your plane!\" With that, the pair hurried out of the building, climbed into a high-powered car and drove off. The conversation piece on interplanetary travel had set up such a chain reaction that within the hour members of the faculty, students, newspaper editors, and radio commentators were trampling all over each other in their mad haste to violate a confidence. Within two hours they in turn were being questioned by Air Force Intelligence officers. The first thing the investigators wanted to know was what was the man's name. Nobody quite knew. One freshman remembered he had been referred to as \"Great Scott\" just before he and Koehler took off. A faculty member recalled introducing him to another as \"Mr. Sears,\" and being corrected; but he couldn't remember what the man said his name was. \"I think he said it was `Newton' or maybe that he was a friend of Newton.\" \"You mean the Mayor of Denver?\" No, they were sure he wasn't the Mayor of Denver. \"You mean a man can lecture at the University of Denver and not be identified at all?\" the military demanded. The faculty didn't quite mean that, certainly not in the face of all loyalty oaths, witchhunting, and security taboos which were bogging down what was left of their academic freedom, but the man had been vouched for by Koehler and, after all, he only had talked harmlessly on a fascinating subject about which man had speculated for hundreds of years. \"Harmlessly?\" the military repeated. \"How do you know the subject is harmless? Did anybody get the number of his car? Or overhear what hotel he was stopping at?\" Well, one auditor remembered that Koehler did say that the man had to catch a plane in twenty minutes. \"Did he say to where?\" \"No,\" the informer remarked, \"but Koehler would know.\" \"Oh, Koehler!\" the investigator cried in disgust. Why that? Well, for months it seems Air Force Intelligence as well as editors-from Publisher Ken Purdy of True who was out on a limb because he had proclaimed in giant\n\ntype \"FLYING SAUCERS ARE REAL,\" down to an unby-lined reporter on The Kansas City Times-had been badgering Koehler about details concerning flying saucers. Actually Koehler had none firsthand. He told them so. Purdy rushed Donald Kehoe out to Denver from Washington to get the story. Money was no object. But Koehler said he had no firsthand information. So, incensed, they threw the book at him. One Kansas City reporter who hadn't met Koehler, called him \"Coulter\" and said it was all a hoax. An A.P. feature writer who hadn't met Koehler either, repeated the fallacy. Kehoe picked it up on the bounce and repeated it, too. Koehler called them the sort of names which would be out of place here, since this is not a modern novel. No one would believe him, least of all Air Force Intelligence, whose members acted as if they were quite sure Koehler had a pipeline into the very cabin of a flying saucer which was reported by some to have landed somewhere in the Great American Desert, and was further reported by others to have been dismantled by the very souvenir-hunting military of which Air Force Intelligence was an integral part. Were the military Dick Tracys seeking information or were they trying to bottle up all who had the same information they had? Were they fearful that their own experiments in space ships would leak without delivering a counterpunch. When an army investigator turned up at Station KMYR on the hunt for flying saucer data, Koehler decided to record their conversations. On a subsequent visit from another officer representing Operation Hush-Hush (which presumably had supplanted Project Saucer) Koehler was surprised when at the end of the interview he was ordered to surrender the reel. \"We know you have been recording these interviews,\" the officer told him. \"Now hand them over.\" Caught off guard, Koehler said he'd have to consult the station's owner before handing over company property to anybody. \"If it's for reasons of security\" [the magic word], \"by all means,\" the proprietor agreed. Koehler left the conference, explaining he'd have to have the engineer rewind the recordings, which happened to be on tape. Having also learned how to handle government bureaucrats from their own double-talk, Koehler went to the engineer's booth and with his back to the military winked at the technician and then ordered, \"Fix up the recordings for the gentleman.\" He sure fixed them. In rewinding the spools the engineer demagnetized the wire, completely wiping out all recorded conversations as if a wet sponge had been rubbed over a chalk mark on a blackboard. Thus when played back later by the exultant espionage officers the result was exactly nothing. So when in the pursuit of the mystery man of science who had lectured at the University of Denver the Air Force Intelligence boys cried, \"Oh, Koehler!\" they were practically adding under their breaths, \"We could wring that bird's neck!\" What they did instead was to summon all passenger lists of commercial planes out of Denver on March 8, from 1:30 P.M. On. They combed these to see if any scientists whose names had ever come up in relation to the late Project Saucer had defied an unofficial directive for all scientists remotely connected with defense (and that about included everybody with a B.S. degree) to button up about flying saucers. The manhunt got nowhere. out, or did they believe the flying saucers were being hurled like boomerangs from behind the Kremlin wall?\n\nMonths before this tempest in a university teapot the Air Force had announced that Project Saucer, which it had set up at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, in January, 1948, had been ordered closed by the end of 1949. The preliminary report issued in April, 1949, had discarded 341, remember, of 375 reports which had been investigated since a businessman in Boise, Idaho, had reported that in the summer of 1947 while flying his private plane he had sighted nine saucer-like objects which shot through space at a speed too fast for him to compute. Of the remaining 34 case histories concerned with flying saucers the Air Force officers could find no satisfactory answers. Seemingly they could not ascribe these to hoaxes, hallucinations, and sure-fire devices of nobodies hungry to see their names in newspaper headlines. Nevertheless, despite these unsolved mysteries, the Air Force announced late in December, 1949, that the whole project had been shelved and as far as its investigators concerned flying saucers were a myth and the belief in a form of mass hysteria in which it was taking no further were them part. Despite this shunting of strange disk-like objects sweeping the sky at tremendous speeds to the file-and-forget file by the Force, persons who reported objects whirling through our themselves playing host soon espionage echelon of the military on local levels. Newspapermen and others in the know laughed at the idea that Project Saucer had been closed. Some even openly printed their derision. The Pentagon didn't bother to deny that their saucerian inquiry had gone underground and was now operating under another name. Koehler had been one of many private citizens who had had a brush with a counterespionage body. But having been an old professional football player on the Chicago Bears before he got into the selling end of radio, he was not one to take a roust Air to newspapers any unfamiliar wide open spaces often found thereafter to members of the The mystery man of science hadn't left town on any plane from Denver that day. Scarcely had Air Force Intelligence swallowed the bitter pill of a lost suspect when flying disks began flying around like an August festival of moths around an arc light. Within the week Mexico City; Los Angeles; Durango, Colorado; Mazatlan; Dayton; Gering, Nebraska; Orangeburg, South Carolina; Lima, Peru; and even the Chilean Navy were reporting saucer-shaped objects in their skies. Most of the stories were one-day wonders: streamer headlines one evening, watered down or reduced to hearsay the next. But here and there a story showed surprising staying power. Surprising, too, was the double standard of identity maintained in these matters. Every citizen who thought he saw a flying saucer had to turn in a report that left no doubt about who he was, where he was, and the alcoholic content of his blood for one week before and one week after he had observed \"a silver-like saucer whizzing through space.\" But in two years of sitting in the reviewing stand, the Air Force rarely identified so much as one officer or civilian technical adviser it had used to blow down these ever-increasing reports. Even in the case of the University of Denver lecturer, it would not permit him to enjoy the same anonymity which it claimed for itself. The faculty and students were pledged not to publicize what they had heard but to evaluate it for what it was worth to them as\n\nscience students. The speaker told them to disregard all but what he said. For this reason he was not introduced by name or by his degrees. One of the things the lecturer said was that the first flying saucer found on this earth was discovered by his colleagues within 500 miles of where he was talking right there in Denver. This didn't send the science students scurrying into the field in all directions, as it should have if they had any feeling for research. It sent some to newspaper offices and the rest spent the afternoon lying on the lawn and gazing at the sky. By the next day the horizontal scanners had increased to nearer one thousand students. That behind all this smoke was no fire whatever continued to be the unyielding premise of the Air Force High Command, officially, though its officers continued to hop around like chameleons on a scotch plaid, unofficially. Outwardly the Air Force took a detached position in the Christmas season of 1949 and maintained it unperturbed right through the Easter sunrise services of 1950, even though warned by men of high standing in the electromagnetic branch of science that these alien objects in our skies were known for years to pile up in heaviest numbers in January, February, and March. Judging from the piling up of newspaper reports, the scientists were certainly right in their calculations and the weary Air Force spokesmen were wrong. The second phase of the University of Denver story was either to find the name of the lecturer who might, for all the faculty knew, be an agent from Moscow, Idaho, or to find a \"patsy\" to blame for the affair. While this was going on, a report came in from Santiago, Chile, quoting Commander Augusto Vars Orrego, head of the Chilean Antarctic Base, as saying that several explorers under his command had photographed flying saucers. The commander denied the possibility of optical illusions because the pictures, he insisted, corroborated what was observed. Whether these would be published depended on his superiors in the Chilean Navy, he told the United Press. So far they haven't been. This report had scarcely found its place in the line of march before another report out of Santiago from the country's meteorological observatory added that \"a spheroid celestial body\" (astronomical slang for flying saucer) had been sighted at an estimated height of 18,000 feet. It supposedly crossed the sky in an east to west direction. It remained, according to the naval astronomers, in the sky from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M., and then disappeared. It was observed by thousands. As Chile is outside the boundaries of the U. S. Air Force Intelligence, this one elicited no comment from the Pentagon. Brigadier General Rodriguez Cardenes, chief of the Mexican Air Corps, added his disclaimer, indicating that the good neighbor policy was not dead when it came to reciprocal agreements on press releases of this sort. It was getting so that pilots, navigators, and others trained to observe objects in the sky were not keen about reporting their observations any longer to Air Force Intelligence. There were too many kickbacks. To observe was to be suspect; to know was to be guilty. It was a crazy situation for America to find herself in, but there it was. Most persons in responsible posts learned to take the official position as if it had all the force of a directive. Almost to a man you could bank on such persons accenting the positive, if the Pentagon was going that way, or adding their ridicule if the trend was downhill.\n\nIn the midst of positive reports from here, there, and everywhere, Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, professor of astronomy at the University of Chicago, laughed at the idea that the pilot of the saucer reported in Mexico was a small man, but suggested that pilots of space ships could be smart bugs or small plants because that's all, in his opinion, the planet Mars could produce at present. This sort of smart-alec rebuttal couldn't possibly receive an official rebuff at the time because it was in the \"right\" direction. Moreover, it sort of set the party line for other astronomers. Off the record you could find dissenting opinions from astronomers whose standing was just as high as Kuiper's. Many kept an open mind on the issue. Some believed the objects were flying saucers but were still at a loss as to their origin. A few favored one planet or another as a possibility. But from Kuiper's whimsy you'd think that everybody had agreed the space ships were from Mars. Who said they were from Mars? Orson Welles? The ghost of the long dead R. A. Locke? Or was this a device of the military, a negative approach, to condition us to further revelations later involving Mars? Though no Air Force officer has been known to have written on the subject, True magazine managed to get two Navy men to As for things at the Denver level their investigators were too busy tailing that mystery man of science to bother with scuttlebutt from the Chilean Navy. The same day, unfortunately, for those on the negative side of the debate, the director of the Tonantzintla Astronomical Observatory in Mexico reported photographing a flying saucer. The photograph didn't turn out any too well, but the newspaper Excelsior printed it nevertheless. Luis Enrique Erro, director of the observatory, said it was photographed on March 2 when the strange circular object crossed the Mexican sky. Then on March 9, Roy L. Dimmick, Los Angeles sales manager for the Apache Powder Company, the sort of man who would be welcome on almost any jury, started a veritable stampede of disk jitters when he reported the wreckage of a flying saucer picked up near Mexico City. It had a dead pilot on board. The space ship measured 46 feet across, he said, and the pilot measured 23 inches. \"American military men have viewed the strange object,\" Dimmick testified, \"but for military security reasons the entire matter has been kept very hush-hush.\" The next day Dimmick dropped back to what the military call \"a previously prepared position\" and said he hadn't actually seen the space ship personally but had talked to two important men-one from Mexico and the other from Ecuador-who had. One had given him a strip of metal from the saucer. It looked like aluminum, but wasn't of a metal known to this earth, he added. This had a familiar ring. I've handled some of that stuff, too. \"I think the government ought to make its position clear,\" Dimmick complained. \"If it doesn't want to discuss these things for reasons of security, why not say so?\" But the Air Force was not saying anything of the sort. The saucers were \"a mild form of mass hysteria.\" (Except in cases like Dimmick's. He would fall, I suppose, according to their rigid classifications, into either the group suffering from hallucinations or the perpetrators of hoaxes.) break loose from the corral during this era. Donald E. Keyhoe, a former Marine pilot, and Robert E. McLaughlin, a commander still on active service, wrote about flying saucers they had seen or had heard about. The articles were long on sound and fury, and while it\n\nmight be harsh to say they signified nothing, that was more because of poor writing rather than poor material. True was not the first in the field by any means. I was at least ten weeks ahead of True with articles in Variety, and Fate was ahead of me by a year. But mine was not a rewrite. I used material never previously printed by anybody anywhere Fate, the Post, and True included. Much of this was subsequently reprinted from Variety in papers as widely scattered as Boston, Buffalo, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, and a good deal of it has been released over one radio station or another. During most of these exposes, Air Force Intelligence maintained a weary silence in the face of aerial observations which had turned the peoples of all countries from discussions of the cold war to hot speculations about flying saucers. As for Denver, and its mysterious lecturer of March 8, 1950, the music went 'round and 'round. Someone remembered that a tape recording had been made of the scientist's talk and that it probably was stashed away at Station KMYR where Koehler worked. Koehler's employer permitted a group of Denver businessmen to listen to the recording so that they could better understand the ridiculousness of all the espionage and counterespionage on the Denver campus. By then the Chancellor, who had been out of town when the lecture was delivered, was sounding off. He issued a directive to his faculty. They would have to screen speakers more carefully in the future. An anonymous writer on The Denver Post liked this approach to the problem. So he tried his editorial hand at rebuffing anonymity among visiting lecturers. His rebuff had all the moral force of pots calling kettles black. In the audience of leading citizens at the radio transcription was a reporter of the same Denver Post. He broke the story anew in a Sunday edition. This brought the Army Air Force Intelligence into the picture again. Finally Koehler said he could take the thirddegree stuff no longer. \"The name of the mystery scientist is Edgar B. Davis!\" he cried. It was agreed by all who heard it that this was a nice honest sounding name. But who was Edgar B. Davis? The hunt started out anew. At the very hour, however, when Denver was listening to a recording of the lecture, several persons in Hollywood were listening to a tape recording of the same lecture. It was taken from the original tape recording. In Hollywood it was heard in the private home of a doctor and his wife who had been a graduate nurse and a former airline hostess. The recording was in the custody of a geophysicist, a man known to me for years. All were unquestionably astounded by the revelations and even more so by the fact that the voice on the tape and the one of the geophysicist were almost beyond a shadow of a doubt one and the same voice. Of course, since the flying time between Denver and Los Angeles is only a matter of six hours his presence in both places in the same day could not be advanced as conflicting testimony. But on March 17, Denver's faculty, student body, press, and Air Force intelligence officers were pretty well convinced they had identified the lecturer who had had the temerity to write the bad words \"Flying Saucers For Beginners\" on their cloistered walls. Four students, as well as Barron Beshoar, Denver's bureau manager of Time-Life Incorporated (a gate-crasher to the lecture incidentally), were sure from Denver Post photographers that the man was Silas Mason Newton, president of the Newton Oil\n\nCompany, amateur golf champion of Colorado in 1942, graduate of Baylor University and Yale, who did postgraduate work at the University of Berlin, a man who had never made more than $25,000,000 nor lost more than $20,000,000, the The main story told that fully half the town's population was still certain the morning after that it had seen space ships or some strange aircrafts-hundreds of them-zooming through the skies on the previous day. The estimates ran from several to more than five hundred. \"Whatever they were,\" the writer reported, \"they caused a major sensation in this community which lies only a 110 air miles northwest of the huge Los Alamos Atomic installation.\" The objects appeared to play tag high in the sky. At times they streaked away at almost unbelievable speeds. One triangulation estimated the speed at 1,000 miles an hour, and guessed the saucers were about twice the size of a B-29. The newspaper office was deluged with calls from persons who saw the objects and wanted some explanation of their origin. Most observers described the space ships as silvery discs, and a number agreed one was red in color. Clayton J. Boddy, a former captain of the engineers of the American Army in Italy, was just one of the number who testified as to what he saw. He was one in fact among those who thought there appeared to be about five hundred of them. His account was confirmed by Joseph C. Callioff and Frances C. Callioff, grocers from Antonito, Colorado, and Robert Foutz, and John Burrell of Farmington. The Callioffs were in Farmington inspecting sites for a proposed new store in their chain, and they contributed the opinion that the saucers seemed to be flying in formation. Harold F. Thatcher, director of the Farmington unit of the U. S. Soil Conservation Service, was the one who made the triangulation. Not an engineer, he had engineers working under him and knew how to make a rough triangulation of an object. He laughed off the idea that the sky might have been full of pieces of cotton fuzz floating around. \"I was not sighting on any cotton,\" he said. The cotton theory was a contribution of a state patrolman named Andy Andrews. The first reports of flying saucers were noted at 10:15 A.M. and for an hour thereafter reports kept streaming in. rediscoverer of the Rangely oil field, patron of the arts, and man of the world generally. In brief, a man of substance as well as science and as American as apple pie. One student later admitted he remembered the lecturer and knew who he was all along because he had caddied for him at the Lakewood golf course many times. But he hadn't spoken up before because he understood there was to be no publicity. Hadn't the subject matter been announced as confidential, he wanted to know? This tempest in a university teapot, cooked up to make modesty appear as scandalous and tattletelling as a virtue, was all but obliterated from even The Denver Post by a wire story out of Farmington, New Mexico, on the afternoon of March 17. The sky, it appeared, had been cluttered with flying saucers for three days. But on St. Patrick's day in the morning half the town reported saucers in the sky. Some saw hundreds, none saw less than nine. Farmington is an oil town of 5,000 persons. Its citizens are given more to looking down than looking up. Their living is way down there in the bowels of the earth in the San Juan Basin of northern New Mexico, close to the Colorado line; within, significantly, that 500 miles of Denver the lecturer referred to.\n\nThe town has one newspaper, the Farmington Daily Times. On one ear of its front-page masthead it proclaims, \"Our Mission-Truth; Our Faith-New Mexico.\" It was established in 1884, a long time before Air Force Intelligence, and its reputation for veracity in the community is good. So when on the morning of March 18 it ran an eight-column banner headline proclaiming \"Hugh Saucer Armada Jolts Farmington,\" it was reporting the news as the entire staff and most of the town's population saw it. Clayton J. Boddy, the paper's business manager, and Orville Ricketts, the associate editor, had a hand in it, but the story was actually written by Walter Rogal, the managing editor. The second large-scale sighting appeared at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The first report that one of the saucers appeared red came from John Eaton, a real estate salesman, and Edward Brooks, a garage employee. Brooks had been a B-29 tail-gunner, and was the first to discount the objects as that of modern aircraft. They were \"too maneuverable\" he said. John Bloomfield, another garage employee, said that they traveled about ten times faster than jet planes and frequently made right-angled turns. \"They appeared to be coming at each other head on,\" he added. At the last second one would veer at right angles upward and the other at right angles downward.\" \"From the ground they appeared about the size of a dinner plate,\" said Marlow Webb, another employee. \"They flew sideways, on edge and at every conceivable angle. This is what made it easy to determine that they were saucer-shaped.\" No one reported seeing any vapor trails, or hearing any engine noises. In general the town accepted the phenomenon calmly enough. Except for a few isolated reports there was no indication of Air Force's tired old trinity-hallucinations, mass hysteria, and hoaxes. As to whether the objects were from another planet or some new craft of American design, the town's opinion was divided. At 11:15 A.M. the clearest view and reports of the largest number of saucers came into the Farmington Times. By 11:30 all had disappeared. Nearby Las Vegas reported that at 11:35 observers caught a glimpse of the saucers. Twelve postal employees witnessed one that sailed till noon. One employee was Robert Hilgers, a lieutenant in the naval reserve. He said the object was very high in the sky, \"probably twenty miles.\" The Las Vegas Daily Optic gave the Farmington story an eight-column streamer too. \"SPACE SHIPS CAUSE SENSATION\" it proclaimed. All previous official explanations in the Air Force stockpile, that these things could be kites, balloons, reflections, debris from atomic bomb tests at nearby Alamagordo, windblown merry-grounds, suggestibility, hallucinations, mirages, and postwar psychoses didn't seem to cover the Farmington revelations. A whole town couldn't be seeing things. Without knowing it, that Farmington fish story had come awfully close to landing a whale, because it was in that general direction where it all started in the spring of 1948 when a colleague of the lecturer of the University of Denver tempest got a hurry call to fly to New Mexico. This colleague (I shall call him \"Dr. Gee\") had been in government service on top secret defense projects for seven years and had played a part in 35,000 experiments on land, sea, and air, involving 1,700 scientists. He was still on call and\n\ngetting pretty tired of these consultations, which at government salaries represents a loss to a man much in demand by industry. But this time he was too thrilled to be tired. It took him only three hours to fly from Denver to his destination. There on the ground, having gently pancaked to earth, seemingly without having suffered a scratch, he saw the first flying saucer ever known to have landed on this planet. Not long afterward I heard about it, first from that University of Denver lecturer and later from the lips of Dr. Gee himself. \"I don't believe a word of it,\" I remember saying at the time, but tell me more about it. What did it look like? Where was it found?\" The scientist told me but he also told me so many other things that I had forgotten the name of the town. He explained about magnetic fault zones particularly in Oregon and on the Mojave Desert and how the pilots of these ships seemed to be as curious about them as bees about honey. He said he was checking to see if this curiosity was a likely source or had any connection with the propulsion behind their ships. He told me he suspected they had mastered secrets of flying, which we were only now seeing most dimly. I kept my own counsel for months. But when others less well informed began sounding off in all directions about flying saucers, I thought it was about time that I told the world if nothing more than proof that I knew more than I had read in the papers. In fact the night the Denver Post was exposing Scientist X and the Farmington citizens were exposing Operation HushHush, I was dining in Hollywood with the man all Denver was hunting for. He had just talked to George Koehler in Denver by long distance. Koehler had worked for him and had married his nurse. The Farmington report had set Denver uproar, Koehler told him. \"Do you remember my telling you,\" Scientist X said hung up, \"that the first flying saucer was found on a ranch twelve miles from Aztec?\" I remembered when he reminded me \"Yes,\" I said, \"I remember now.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"Farmington is only twenty-eight miles from that ranch. In fact they flew over the exact place where one of their number had fallen a year ago.\" \"I wonder why they keep scouting that area?\" I asked. \"Is it a tribute to the saucer that failed to come home or to show that they have mastered the particular fault zone that grounded an earlier patrol?\" \"I covered that in my Denver lecture,\" he said. \"Weren't you paying attention?\" =============================================================== ======== Author: Frank Scully Title: BEHIND THE FLYING SAUCERS Section: Chapter 2 Format: Book Publication Year: 1950 Digitizer: Bufo Calvin Collection: OPUS On-line Library (http://www.opus-net.org/) Comment: Paragraphing formatting, hyphenation, and indenting has been changed to make the text file more legible.\n\nWhat the Scientist Said THOUGH PERHAPS not too much thought has gone into the saying \"nearer to church the further from God\" (else how explain the piety of monks and nuns?), it-nevertheless happens that a hermit on a faraway hilltop sees more clearly into your windows now and then than your next door neighbor. Such an explanation of the vagaries of reflected light might explain also why it was not the Denver newspapers that gave the best report of what Scientist X had said to students of the University of Denver. The reflected prize for the best reporting would go to the Summerside Journal, a modest sized publication quartered on Prince Edward Island, Canada; between Newfoundland and New Brunswick at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. This newspaper obviously got its story from a Denver correspondent, but it recapitulated what the speaker said so well that it's better than a transcript in helping readers arrive at an understanding of what went on that March afternoon. A transcript of a speech doesn't necessarily leave the reader with a well-rounded picture of what happened. The reason for this is that when a man talks he is primarily appealing to the ears of his readers; when he writes he is appealing to their eyes. Therefore, a complete transcription such as The New York Times frequently employs would not necessarily be the truest picture of what a man said. It would certainly lack his emphasis, his gestures, and (in this case) his chalk sketches on the blackboard. Basically, the questions brought to the surface by this mysterious talker at the University of Denver were: (1) had science really found flying saucers to be real, (;2) what did they consist of, and (3) where were they found? A listener would like to know if the speaker thought the flying saucers had their origin on this earth. If they were, on the other hand, from another planet, what planet? Were they operated by pilots aboard them? And if by pilots, what were the appearance, size, coloring, age, clothes, and some of the other census-taking facts? Did their knowledge of aerodynamics go deeper than ours would be another natural question. In a fifty-minute address, it would be too much to expect any scientist to cover this whole field completely. At best he could subdivide the already divided camps between those who believed in flying saucers and those who disbelieved in them. He might reveal certain information along the way :fortifying the general suspicion that he was a man of education and standing in the community, that he was not only a man of science but of substance. Well, he was saying, to begin with, that there is such a thing as a flying saucer. He was saying, moreover, that the Air Force, despite its announcement to the contrary, had not abandoned its Project Saucer, but was operating on another level and under possibly another name. He was saying that t four of these flying saucers had actually landed on this earth. Three of the four, he added, had. been captured and had been inspected by men with whom he was currently identified in geophysical research. Thirty-four men, measuring\n\nbetween thirty-six inches to forty inches in height had been found dead in three of the saucers discovered. The first saucer to land on this earth, he said, landed less than two years previous to his talk, \"on a site within 500 miles of Denver.\" The saucer not only didn't appear to come from any part of this earth, but the question of where it came from still remained unsolved. The best speculation, he added, was Venus, but he continued to stress the point that it was still a wide-open question. Under research, he said, the materials used in the saucer had disclosed two metals unknown to us. This convinced him and his co-scientists that the saucers were not likely made by us or rival powers. Found in the first space ship were instruments which seemingly measured lines of magnetic force. These instruments were a key to something which his group was still working on and believed when they solved it, they would have solved the whole problem of the propulsion of these saucers. He said such ships capable of traveling with the speed of light could leave such a planet as Venus, say, which is 161,000,000 miles from us when our orbits lie in extreme positions, and return to Venus in less than one hour. According to the correspondent of the lecturer never identified himself speech was calculated, well thought enough for the slowest student to absorb and record. There was no particular accent or diction which the correspondent could detect. The speaker used scientific terms and spoke with a familiarity of a man who knew many sciences. He repeatedly used the word \"we\" when referring to experiments being done on the strange crafts. He didn't associate himself with any particular experiment. He also indicated that a full disclosure of the government's interest in flying saucers, though officially denied at present, would be forthcoming in the not too distant future. He said the first disk that landed was 99.9 feet in diameter and had a cabin measuring 72 inches in height. The second measured 72 feet in diameter, the third, 36 feet. All measurements on the ships seemingly were divisible by nine, which may have been a clew that they used our system of measurement. The disks, he explained had revolving rings of metal, in the center of which were the cabins. The cabins were geared to the disks, which revolved around the stabilized cabins. The gears, which had no lubrication, were of a gear ratio unfamiliar to our engineers. He thought they might have traveled by using the magnetic lines of force known to encircle planets of our solar system. From its appearances the researchers assumed that the first saucer was capable of maneuvering in any given direction. Like helicopters, which these ships were not, they could be maneuvered to land anywhere. The smallest had a landing gear built like a tricycle of three metal balls, which could revolve in any direction. Accepting the theory, which he did, that the craft could operate by harnessing magnetic lines of force, he said it was entirely logical to assume these saucers could travel up to virtually unlimited speed-at least up to 186,000 miles per second the speed of light-in this atmosphere, and where there was no gravitational or wind resistance it would be impossible to compute how fast they could travel. Sixteen men, ranging in ages, he would guess, from thirty-five to forty years old, if we use our calendar of time, were taken dead from the first craft. Their bodies had been charred to a dark brown color.\n\nSixteen dead men were also found in the second craft. These, however, had not suffered from burns apparently, and were all of fair complexion. Otherwise they were like the first space travelers-of small stature. No different from us, except for height, and lack of beards. Some had a fine growth resembling peach fuzz. The third ship was also manned and the men in it were also dead. This one, a small saucer, 36 feet in diameter, had a crew of only two. These men had lived to land, because they had died while attempting to climb out of their cabin. Those connected with the research, the speaker said, believed that all three craft landed under the guidance of their own instruments and did not crash, despite the fact that their crews were dead. They may have landed on instruments or they may have been guided the whole distance. But they did not crash and in only one ship was there any mark of imperfection. In construction, they were quite dissimilar to anything we have designed. There was not a rivet, nor a bolt, nor a screw in any of the ships. Their control boards were a series of push buttons. Their outer construction was of a light metal much resembling aluminum but so hard no application of heat could break it down. There was no reference to the means of propulsion beyond that the craft presumably operated on lines of magnetic force and the designers had conquered the problem of how to switch from Venus (which is positive) to this earth (which is positive), and therefore repel each other. The ships carried no weapons, and the speaker assumed that they had solved the problem of disintegrating an object which might pursue or threaten them. He gave details of the water and food found on the board the saucers. He also told of sleeping accommodations on one craft that had wall-enclosed bunks which could not be seen when closed and ingeniously disappeared in the curtains when open. As he neared the end of his lecture he told of the discovery of a fourth saucer which members of his group stumbled on near a government proving ground. It was unoccupied at the moment. The scientists returned to their car for cameras and equipment and as they neared the ship they saw several little men hop into the saucer, and the ship just disappeared like one of those hallucinations we hear so much about. At no time did the speaker indicate where the ships disappeared to after being broken up for research. Nor did he give any clew as to what happened to the bodies of the 34 men found dead in the first three saucers. \"He said simply,\" concluded the reporter for the Summerside Journal, `There is a flying saucer.' \" He might have added for the benefit of any eavesdroppers scouting for the Air Force that the ships were as real as the planes over Pearl Harbor, which the Air Force never saw either. He might have, but he refrained. Comparing this news summary with an actual transcript of the lecture, the reporter for the Summerside journal comes out with flying colors. That he skipped such technical matters as the speaker's reference to William Gilbert-(1544-1603)-as the father of magnetism, and other milestones, such as July 16, 1945, at 5:30 A.M. when the atomic age was born at Alamagordo, New Mexico, and Max Planck's theories advanced in 1903 when he was professor at the University of Berlin is not important. Tying all these things to the age of the flying saucers was part of the speaker's general introduction.\n\nHe drew four designs on the blackboard. One showed the \"System of Nines,\" believed to have been used in constructing the saucers. Two others showed two views of the saucer, which was 99.99 feet in diameter, 18 feet across the cabin and a clearance of 45 inches above the rim for pilots to see what might be around them. The design looked very much like the photographs taken by Paul Trent of McMinnville, Oregon, and published in the June 26, 1950 issue of Life. The fourth design showed how magnetic lines of force travel from the sun to the various planets, particularly to the earth and to Venus. After his lecture had caused such a stir, the chalked designs were preserved by lacquer, and unless the lacquer has been removed are there to this day. The reporter missed too that the space ships apparently had no doors, no exits. They did, however, have portholes. One was broken and it had a hole about the thickness of a pencil. Through this had rushed either gases or air with such speed that it burned the 16 passengers inside to a brown crisp. The speaker made it quite clear both in the transcript and subsequent fireside chats at my home that the passengers, although approximately 40 inches tall were not midgets. They had no bad teeth, no fillings. They all wore a sort of uniform but there were no insignia on collars or caps. There were two or three instruments which the scientists judged to be timepieces. It took 29 days for the instrument to make a complete circumference. This was their first clew that there might be something between the ship's means of propulsion and magnetism, because a magnetic day is 23 hours and 58 minutes, which works out at 29 days for a magnetic month. Another thing the reporter missed, one that was really significant, was the speaker's solution as to what happened to Captain Thomas F. Mantell. This case had been hashed and rehashed many times, but never once had anybody come near a remotely plausible solution as to what happened to Mantell and his plane. All reports agreed that on January 7, 1948, an unidentified object was sighted over Godman Air Force base, Fort Knox, Kentucky, by both military and civilian observers. Four national guardsmen in F 51's, flying in the vicinity, were requested by the Godman control tower operator to investigate the foreign object. Three of the planes closed in and reported that it was metallic and of tremendous size. One pilot described it as \"round like a teardrop and fluid.\" Captain Mantell contacted Godman tower and reported the object was traveling at half his speed at 12 o'clock high. \"I'm closing in now to take a good look,\" he said. \"It's directly ahead of me and still moving at about half my speed. The thing looks metallic and of tremendous sizeâ€¦It's going up now and forward as fast as I am. That's 360 m.p.hâ€¦I'm going up to 20,000 feet and if I'm no closer, I'll abandon chase.\" The time was 3:15 P.M. January 7, 1948. That was the last radio contact by Mantell with the Godman Tower. Five minutes after Mantell's disappearance from the formation the two remaining planes returned to Godman Field. One of them refueled and equipped himself with oxygen. He covered the territory for 100 miles and climbed as high as 30,000 feet, but found nothing. Later that day Mantell's body was found in the wreckage of his plane near Fort Knox. Much of the magic, the scientist explained, which has baffled both trained and untrained observers, is not magic at all. A good deal of what is claimed to have happened to ships in the air, such as disintegration, suspension for a period of time, immobilization of their\n\ninstrument boards, and such can be duplicated in the laboratory. Mantell's plane and every portion of his plane from the motor to the tips of the wings hung together by reason of magnetic frequency. This was true of even Mantell himself. Therefore all that a flying saucer had to do to disintegrate Mantell's plane, the lecturer revealed, was to demagnetize it. No two lines have ever been known to cross each other naturally. If forced to do so, or if crossed by \"accident\" you get disintegration and fire. Anybody who could create such a magnetic disturbance could wipe out every living thing on this earth in a second. This, then was the magnetic research scientist's explanation as to what happened to Captain Mantell and his ship. The captain was proving a source of annoyance in his pursuit of a magnetically controlled flying saucer. A button was pushed and Mantel] and his plane were no more. Another thing the speaker pointed out that should have been of more durable interest was that the water on the flying saucer was almost twice as heavy as our drinking water. It was carried in two small containers and was very similar in fact to the heavy water the Nazis wanted so badly from Norway in their haste to be the first to make an atomic bomb. The little wafers, apparently the food supply, were so condensed that when one was put in a gallon of water it swelled up and overflowed. It was fed to guinea pigs and they thrived on it. From the outside the whole cabin of the first flying saucer examined seemed hermetically sealed and if it had not been for that break in one of the portholes the researchers might have spent months getting into the ship. But from the inside there was a visible knob in the wall and on the knob was another smaller knob. When the smallest knob was pushed the door flew open, but once it was shut again it was impossible to see the door from the outside. This at least is the official opinion of the Air Materiel Command. According to them, subsequent investigation revealed that Mantell had probably blacked out at 20,000 feet from lack of oxygen and that the mysterious object which he chased to his death was the planet Venus. \"However,\" the report continued, \"further probing showed the elevation and azimuth reading of Venus and the objects specified time intervals did not coincide.\" The object, in fact, is still considered \"unidentified,\" and as far as is known has never been identified or cleared up by the Air Force to this day. But the speaker in Denver cleared it up to the satisfaction of many. He first prepared his hearers by explaining that members of his group had been engaged in government research since 1942. At least 1,700 scientists were involved in top secret projects. They had worked together for five years and had found out more about magnetism in those five years than the whole world had been able to do in centuries previous. They had come to the conclusion that everything existing owed its shape and being to magnetic lines of force. He explained there are 1,257 magnetic lines of force to the square centimeter. That is to say, to about a half inch. Around certain areas of this earth are places known to have magnetic fault zones. Here blow-outs occur, similar to the perpetual eddying of the waters around Cape Hatteras. On\n\nthis continent areas around the states of Oregon and New Mexico are known to have these sort of faultings. If the saucers fly on these magnetic waves and have an intelligence operating them (like ours or even superior to ours) it follows that they would show a curiosity about areas that were troublesome. Also atomic explosions might disturb magnetic lines of force and certainly be not unknown to their instruments. This could explain their frequent appearances over areas like the White Sands Proving Ground. Since the air is so much clearer in Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas it obviously is easier for land-based observers to spot them. It had not yet been determined what the two materials found on the ship were. Heat had not been able to melt one down, not even up to 10,000 degrees. It was strong it was light. A dozen men could stand on it and not dent it; two men could raise up one end of the ship, it was that light. More than 150 experiments had been tried to break down the gear structure of the ship, with no success It was hard and of a ratio different from the Swedish system which we employ. Instead of being three to five it was three to six, giving no allowance for lubrication or play or wear expansion under heat. The speaker said that one ship had defied all effort to get inside of it, despite the use of $35,000 worth of diamond drills. Though the 72-foot ship had sleeping quarters and even a toilet, the third ship had neither of these features. The latter was piloted by two little men, who sat on bucket seats in front of a control board which was entirely manipulated by push buttons. One, when found, was halfway out of is cabin. The other was sitting with his head on his chest; both dead. It was the little ship that had the three-point landing gear. The locomotion was not on wheels but steel-looking balls. If all the balls were spinning in the same direction, any number of men could not tilt the ship. However, if the were no movement to the steel balls, a child could tilt the disk ship. This helped to convince the researchers that magnetic laws were involved. The speaker guessed that the two-seater must have been a later model, based and built on the knowledge that the trip from wherever they came and back did not require sleeping accommodations nor toilets, any more than automobiles require them on this earth. Certainly any flying saucer which cod travel from the planet Venus, say, to this earth and back in an hour would have no need for overnight bags. The speaker also said that the thread used to sew the buttons on the jackets of these men had been tested, and it took 450 pounds of weight to break the thread. This was the lecturer's story. Later we will get to Dr. Gee's own story, but I have a story to tell, too. And after me the Air Force has its story, for in this court all will get a hearing. =============================================================== ========= Author: Frank Scully Title: BEHIND THE FLYING SAUCERS Section: Chapter 3 Format: Book Publication Year: 1950 Digitizer: Bufo Calvin\n\nCollection: OPUS On-line Library (http://www.opus-net.org/) Comment: Paragraphing formatting, hyphenation, and indenting has been changed to make the text file more legible. Some Personal History LONG BEFORE this point, many readers must have asked themselves, \"How did Scully get into all this?\" Frankly, I wrote my way into it. Years ago I wrote the inside story of how I happened to be the author of Frank Harris's life of Bernard Shaw. I later incorporated the articles into a book called Rogues Gallery-a title which I subsequently gave to Ellery Queen for a book of detective stories, only to find it used without permission in movies, radio, and everywhere else as time went by. Among the readers of Rogues Gallery was one who wrote in substance: \"You keep picking around the edges of Harris. Why don't you write a book about him?\" It was signed \"Silas M. Newton. The name rang a bell in my memory. When Harris and his wife made a trip from Nice to New York in the winter of 19291930, Silas Newton paid for it. He housed them in his Park Avenue residence and arranged for their invitation to talk to Washington officialdom on Shakespeare. \"Obviously it's an outcropping,\" he said. \"No prospector would know how to get it otherwise.\" He organized an expedition. He ordered equipment, men, and a jeep dispatched from Denver. They were to meet us at a motel near the California-Nevada line. We were routed out at 3:45 in the morning. We traveled to a jumping-off place in a new Oldsmobile and the jeep. Four of them transferred to the jeep taking instruments, water, and food with them. I was left to guard the pass. From what? The nearest sign of life were some dinosaur's hoof prints-and they were 30,000,000 years old. \"If we don't come back by noon, don't worry,\" said Newton. \"If things go bad we might be held up till 4:30.\" \"And if you don't come back by sundown?\" \"We're lost,\" he said. Then he drove off with the keys to the rescue car. That meant if they were lost, I was too. They left just as the sun was coming over the mountains. I was parked on a volcanic lava bed-barren of the slightest vegetation. Not even a buzzard flew over the area all day. By noon the heat became stifling. I stripped nude except for army boots and crawled under the car. Never had I seen such a God-forsaken spot. I began to think of myself in terms of Captain Scott, that my end would be simply a matter of \"these few notes and my dead body will tell the tale.\" In fact I even feared that the notes would burn up and never be found. I could see fifty miles in any direction and I could see nothing. I could get a radio station from Salt Lake City but they didn't help because they couldn't get me. A sandwich and a canteen of water were gone by noon. I began to dry out, to salivate. I could have tried the radiator water, but it was full of rust and I felt that all that was left of me was ferrous oxide, the sodium chloride having long since evaporated.\n\nEven if rescued I wouldn't know where to hunt for the others. There are 360 degrees in even a secret circle, leaving a 359-to-1 shot that a searching party would find them. They didn't return at noon. They didn't return by 4:30. So by Newton's own definition they were lost. It was too late to try hobbling back to civilization, so I decided to spend the night in the car, without food or water. But after the sun had set I saw the lights of a jeep weaving in and out of the cactus, sage, lava beds, and sand. After three attempts to get to me they finally found a way in. They returned gasping for water, pooped, glass-eyed. They drank some of the radiator water, threw a sack of ore, some tools, and their gold-crazed bodies in the car. Newton took the wheel and tore across the open valley to the crib where we had spent the night. Once refreshed by a couple of coyote sandwiches and some diluted marijuana the natives used for coffee, Newton gave out with the big news. They had found the outcropping all right. \"Only it's on a reactivated military reservation,\" he said, \"and we'll get our butts shot off if we go in there again. So I guess we'll have to shelve the project till the cold war is over.\" The others agreed. \"Well, it vindicated my hunch that we could find other things besides oil by instrumentation,\" he added. \"Let's get some sleep. We've got to get back to business.\" The sack of ore he lured from a government military reservation weighed fifty pounds. It assayed $1,250. It was a year almost to the day, after this adventure in the broadcasting of microwaves from a gold outcropping to Newton's instruments, that Newton introduced me to his newest secret. I had introduced him to a girl, Sharon Chillison (he has since married her), and he invited her, Mrs. Scully, and me to dinner at the Sportsmen's Lodge in the San Fernando Valley. He had just come from Arizona, where he had been referred for some improvements in his geological research equipment. At the time of the dinner he had made thousands of surveys in the Mojave Desert and had just about decided to drill some test wells. All the big oil companies were convinced there was nothing in the area, but by instrumentation he was sure there was. \"Petroleum in place,\" he contends, \"radiates magnetic energy and this is measurable.\" The trouble was, how much? How deep did the wells go? Petroleum deposits hidden deep in the earth were constantly broadcasting through magnetic microwaves, he believed, what had been trapped in the various fault zones. The only handicap his instruments showed was that they could come within inches of telling him where oil could be found but could not tell him how much volume to expect. Thus he might come out with so little oil that for all practical purposes, he had drilled a dry hole. In 1945 Newton told Walter Russell that the broadcasting of microwaves by his instrumentation never exceeded 32 miles. He didn't understand why. Russell explained why. \"Under one of my laws covering circular motion,\" he said, \"the radius is limited to 32 miles because that is the limit of the earth's crust. Beyond that depth is a solid substance. Without knowing it you have discovered the thickness of the skin of the earth.\" Newton was delighted to hear this and the delight was not lessened when 17 months later the telephone company announced that they were setting up a line between New York and Boston with relay stations every 30 miles because that seemed to be as far as\n\nmicrowaves would reflect. They did the same thing when setting up television relay stations between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1950. Meanwhile Newton was applying the knowledge of microwaves to \"petroleum in place.\" Since trapped oil was what he was looking for, that's all he was concerned about. That of course and an estimate of how much would be there before he started digging. In the summer of 1949 he met Dr. Gee, a magnetic engineer who had been released in July after seven years of government servitude on all sorts of top-drawer projects. He had become a master of magnetic energy but $7,200 a year was all he could make for all his mastery. So he begged off government projects to get back to a more profitable_ business. He and Newton exchanged views and he told Newton that he thought Newton was operating, not merely on microwaves but on magnetic waves. He thought a magnetron, such as was developed during the war, might be able to detect the volume of oil. This, he explained, was possible because magnetic waves will not go through oil. They move over and under the petroleum. Thus it would be easy to subtract the difference and tell you how much volume there was in a given oil trap. This was the answer Newton was looking for and he signed Dr. Gee and his equipment to check on the Mojave Desert field before starting any wildcat operations. While driving with Dr. Gee from Denver to Phoenix one day early in the summer of 1949 Newton tuned in on a news commentator who happened to be reporting a flying saucer story. \"Do you think there's anything to these things, Doctor?\" Newton asked the magnetic research scientist. The doctor nodded his head. \"Too bad we weren't associated before,\" he said. \"I could have worked you into the project of the first one we were called in to examine.\" He pointed south of where they were driving. \"It landed down near Aztec, New Mexico. I got a call and flew down from Denver in three hours.\" It was his group that had worked out the means by which Japanese submarines were detected by magnetic devices. So successful were the instruments, that we were able to knock out as many as 17 Jap submarines in one day. They had conducted 35,000 experiments for the government on land, sea, and air. They had moved magnetic research ahead hundreds of years and had spent a billion dollars doing it. Newton was explaining all this to us at dinner and then, as if he could keep a secret no longer from old friends, he started to tell the details of two saucers the research magnetic scientist had personally seen, examined, checked on, and researched. His story was so fantastic, that if he weren't a solid man of industrial service, you might have suspected that he had gone crazy in a quiet, plausible way. He said that Dr. Gee of their group was coming to the coast very shortly to check on some government defense work which for the present was top secret. He was then going to check on Newton's own geophysical findings in the Mojave Desert and maybe he would tell us what he had told Newton. Dr. Gee might show us some of the things that had been taken off one flying saucer-some small disks of a metal unknown to this earth, a tiny radio which operated under principles quite unknown to our engineers, a strange cloth, some gears and other small things which\n\nhe could carry with him, and which he had taken off one of the ships for research, after he found members of the Air Force picking off pieces just for souvenirs. Frankly, I never expected to hear any more of this but a few weeks later, I received a call from Newton asking me if I'd like to drive up to the town of Mojave, which is about ninety miles from Los Angeles, to see how his exploratory operation was getting along. The geophysicist who was the top man in magnetic research would be with us. This was on September 8, 1949. He said that Peverly Marley, cameraman at Warner's and the husband of Linda Darnell, would be coming along too. We failed to make connections with Marley and went on without him, but at the cutoff at Newhall we heard a honking behind us and there was Marley who had pursued us and caught up with us. He parked his car at a gas station and we all repaired to Mojave in Newton's Cadillac. Marley and the magnetic research scientist sat in the back; Newton and I in the front. As on most long trips, people talk about all sorts of things. So we got started on flying saucers. There was no secrecy, official or otherwise, at the time and the scientist answered any and all queries. His explanations were as phlegmatic as those of a combustion engineer explaining how gas explodes in the cylinder of an automobile. On the oil field proper, the magnetic scientist got out his magnatron and Newton got out his own instruments. Though their instruments looked in nowise alike, these men kept checking each other and invariably coming out within a foot of each other's estimates. Newton would ask the magnetic scientist what depth he thought oil was at a particular point at which they agreed there was oil and within seconds the scientist would say something like 2,750. Newton would check in his book and say, \"I got 2,749 when I checked here last May.\" There would be a calm exchange of how this discrepancy of one foot could have arisen, but the difference was so small that it constantly amazed a layman like me that they could split hairs about digging one foot more or less into what must have been millions of dollars either way. Instead of staying overnight on the desert, we decided to drive back to town, a matter of only two hours and the eminent geophysicist stopped off at our house for a short visit to meet Mrs. Scully and our family. Showing no feeling whatever that he was airing confidences which might be violated, he answered all sorts of questions concerning the possible origin of the flying saucers and how they might have got to this earth from another planet, and, more important to his mind, how they could have got back to where they came from. The smallest detail, which a woman might bring up, about the interior of the cabin of the flying saucer, matters of water, food, clothing, were quietly explained just as one might describe the furniture of his own home. His knowledge of magnetic energy was as far ahead of us as, say, the knowledge of atomic-energy scientists must have been to the average person in relation to nuclear fission ten years ago. Indeed, he said some things at that time which since have been heralded far and wide by Albert Einstein in relation to his modified theory of the universe, wherein he discounted Newton's law of gravity in favor of one involving electro-magnetic forces. This didn't mean much to me at the time but it means a lot more to me now.\n\nHe said he regretted the ship was dismantled this way but the Army seems to breed souvenir hunting as it does rank. When he saw what was happening he grabbed a few things himself, not to put in his trophy cabinet but to use for research. The Air Force took some film, he explained. But it fades in two hours, for reasons of security. A special chemical, got only on license, restores the image for another two hours. Naturally this film was not available to him. He said he shot some film of his own, but it wasn't very good. He'd bring that along, though. In time we saw all those things-all except the jacket. We examined the radio, the gears, the film. Then began the reign of error. Air Force closed Project Saucer and went underground. All were told to forget what they knew. \"Hallucinations\" became a routine answer. \"Psycho\" became a veiled threat. Everybody shut up but the people. The official dams were closed but the public spilled its observations into the lake of a free press. But the conflict between free inquiry and official censorship grew. Men who talked freely in the summer of 1949 wouldn't tell their story for $20,000,000 by the summer of 1950. But I remembered. Better than elephants, I remembered. In fact, elephants come to me when they forget. It means more because the geophysicist said he had checked over two of the saucers and believed they were driven, not by fuel, jet, turbojet, or even athodyds, but by magnetic power and that due to certain metals not found on this earth but found on the saucers, he suspected the space ships were from another planet. In fact he ridiculed the idea of anything getting even as far as the moon on jet propulsion or anything like it. As at this time he was doing research for men whose living came out of oil, and was in fact a partner in their properties, he could hardly be suspected of feathering his own nest by discounting gas or petroleum as a means of propulsion from one planet to another. Another thing I remembered from that first meeting was his interest in my infirmity. I have only one leg and have not had much luck with artificial legs, chiefly because they are too heavy and my stump too short. He suggested a suction socket, eliminating all shoulder and waist harness. He said he could make one of a material as strong as steel and as light as plastic. I told him it would still have to be manipulated. He suggested he could install a small motor that could be operated by push button. \"The whole thing shouldn't weigh three pounds,\" he added. \"Fine,\" I said, \"but suppose I stopped to shake hands and chat with a friend, and the leg should keep on walking. Wouldn't I look silly?\" \"I'd control that with a push button too,\" he said. It gave me a clew to the practicality and sweep of his mind. Before he left he promised us he would show us small parts of one of the saucers on his next trip from Phoenix. A radio had him particularly baffled. It had no tubes, no aerials, no wires. He guessed the cabin must have been its antenna. He was trying to rig up a substitute antenna. He could hear a high singsong note 15 minutes past the hour. But the dial was so micrometrically keyed it was difficult to stay on the wave. He was thinking of setting up something like a blockand-fall which permits a clumsy hand to lift a heavy object. Anyway he'd take it along. Wasn't much bigger than a king-sized cigarette package.\n\n=============================================================== ======= Author: Frank Scully Title: BEHIND THE FLYING SAUCERS Section: Chapter 4 Format: Book Publication Year: 1950 Digitizer: Bufo Calvin Collection: OPUS On-line Library (http://www.opus-net.org/) Comment: Paragraphing formatting, hyphenation, and indenting has been changed to make the text file more legible. Theories in Collision BEFORE GROUNDING believers in flying saucers perhaps it might be fruitful to hear what dissenters (by no means accepted by other dissenters) have to say on interplanetary travel. Naturally if you follow any rival theorist too long, you'll either be sucked in by his prop wash or be blown over a cliff by his exhaust gases. It also naturally follows that men who are wedded to rockets as the only plausible means of getting from one planet to another (and that in 1950 included the Air Force) are not going to junk their rockets and embrace flying saucers merely because others may say saucers are already here, while the best military information puts rockets to the moon twenty-five years into the future, and a four-day trip even then. Men stay with what they believe, or fight for buggy whips in an era of automobiles for the simple reason that their livelihoods are all tied up with buggy whips. That rocketeers should pooh-pooh the reality of flying saucers while giving painstaking details of trips to the moon in their imaginary rockets reveals how theories as well as worlds can suffer collision. Yet who can read Willy Ley and not be convinced that the man is writing about a trip to the moon that he actually took? And for those who may still doubt, they will be gathered in like daisies if they look at Chesley Bonestell's \"documentary\" paintings which support Ley's text. No camera could add anything to such an interplanetary understanding. Viking, which gave The Conquest of Space (1949) the glamour treatment, published a more thorough if less glamorous book on rockets by Ley in 1944. Ley must have forgotten some of his own researches, because in the earlier book he lists a volume published in 1931 written by David Lasser. It bears the fetching title The Conquest of Space. Both books commendably play down the lethal prospects of rockets and stress their possibilities for interplanetary travel. Ley is particularly persuasive, whether appealing to astronomers, engineers, or those who like a good story. He has been enamored of rockets for twenty-five years and has been publishing pamphlets on them since at least 1926. The Russians, however, were at them as early as 1893, and the French go back to 1814 when William Congreve published his first book on rockets. His theories spread to England, Ireland, and Germany and were the military vogue of the next fifteen years.\n\nAfter the First World War there was another upsurge of interest-especially among those obsessed with the belief that one new weapon can win a war. The V2 of the Second World War convinced many enemies of the Nazis that perhaps the fanatics were right. Were it not for the fact that the Americans invented the atom bomb, war rockets would be completely in the saddle today. As it is, rockets hold a secondary position and their proponents, both among the military and civilian, must console themselves with such sublimations as trips to the moon instead of to Moscow. Though Ley has a tendency to belittle what he calls second-rate novelists dealing with matter in the science-fiction field, he is really in the same field himself. He starts from a basic and believable premise, such as a rocket being shot off at the White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico (north of El Paso, Texas), and overwhelms you with such a detail of engineering data, in connection with such a release, that you go with him into areas where, if you thought about it, you would realize he had moved from fact into a strictly fictional field with more laughable brass than any Jules Verne of flying saucers. He calls the signal for firing \"X minus 20,\" and he works you with a palpitant pace all the way down to X minus 1. After that there are only fifty seconds to go. . .forty. . .thirty. . .twenty . . .ten. A hand in a steel glove pushes an ignition button. A pinwheel burns, valves jump open, liquid oxygen and alcohol rush from tanks into the motor. Contact! Ignition!. . . A noise which can be heard one-half a :mile away like the roar of a waterfall, or of distant thunder. Peroxide and permanganate come together, the turbine wheel spins, the pumps move, the fuel is forced. There is a deafening roar. Zero! Rocket away! How can anybody deny that such excitement is real? There is a thrust of twenty-seven tons on a rocket weighing less than fifteen tons. Fifteen miles up the velocity climbs from forty feet per second to one mile per second. After sixty-eight seconds, there is a mechanism which shuts off the fuel flow. Ley insists on calling it Brennschluss because the Germans called it that. After that the rocket keeps moving on kinetic energy. It reaches a height of 110 miles, before gravity begins to reassert itself. In five minutes it is back to the earth. And though it went straight up it has landed thirty miles away. Like all planets or other objects in space, it has followed Kepler's law of elliptical conformity. It might have been set to follow a different ellipse as war rockets do. In that case it might have landed 200 miles from where it was fired instead of thirty. Of course if the rocket could have got outside our gravitational pull, it might have kept right on do the moon. But high performance depends on high velocity. With a high mass ratio, and a high exhaust velocity, a rocket slanted to land where the moon would be four days from now, would hit it right on the nose. There is an experimental rocket airplane called XS-1. Ley believes the winged, long-ranged rocket of the future will resemble this type of airplane. But he gives no thought to the idea that the rocket principle which he hugs so close to his breast may also be involved in the propulsion of flying saucers. If a rocket, simplified, is fireworks, a flying saucer, equally simplified, can be a pinwheel in the same pyrotechnical display. The atmosphere of the earth extends 250 miles, but at forty miles the density is nearer a vacuum than anything else. Apparently Ley cannot conceive of any propulsion beyond our combustion engines, turbines, turbojets and, in his dreams, athodyds. Though believers in flying saucers have frequently been classified as beautiful dreamers, Ley talks about a rocket with flawless down-to-earth logic-until you find that his rockets do\n\nnot have enough power to get to the moon. In that case they can become orbital rockets! That is to say, sort of artificial moons, there to revolve in our atmosphere and be used for navigation purposes or stations in space, for later rocket ships to refuel on their way to the moon. What Willy Ley is cooking up, a group calling themselves the Borderland Scientists believe is here already. They call these space ships and the people moving around on such a plane between this planet to another, \"Ethereans.\" Once he has got an unmanned rocket to overcome all barriers and actually reach the moon (possibly with a load of gypsum so that its crash-landing will show up white against the moon's habitual greyness) Ley would be ready for a moonship manned by a crew conditioned to all sorts of atmospheric pressures and vacuums. Because man on this earth functions at 1 g. (gravity), the rocket could not exceed an acceleration of 4 g. without tearing him apart. Thus it would take 500 seconds of acceleration at 4 g. before the ship hit a velocity of 7 miles per second-a speed it would have to maintain to get out of the earth's gravitational pull. In its fall toward the moon, there would have to be enough fuel reserved to resist the pull of the moon's gravitational pull. And in fact enough fuel left over, to get out of it again. There would be no way to relay a message, as there is no air around the moon where the temperature varies from 250 degrees below zero to 200 above. Unless the crew hit a happy medium, their chances of coming back on Ley's slow boat would be academic. Coming back to this earth, Ley hoped the engineers could work out a series of breaking ellipses, so that the rocket could eventually get home like a glider. He also suggested a two-step rocket, one inside the other, and the smaller one to take on the final job of getting to the moon. Funny thing that Lucian of Samosata, who wrote the first story of a trip to the moon, in the third century, had a ship caught in an Atlantic storm and had the ship carried to the moon. It took eight days. That's not bad calculating, considering that the best figures today, according to those unfamiliar with magnetic energy (Ley apparently among them), would be four days. Johannes Kepler who discovered the laws of planetary orbits also made an imaginary trip to the moon. But his wasn't as believable as Ley's. Ley's own imaginary trip takes place on a mountaintop near the equator. It will be out of sight within a minute. Its path will be vertical, and then tipped eastward so it can gain some of the earth's rotational momentum, and then pointed to a spot where the moon will be four days hence. It will leave the earth's atmosphere three minutes after taking off, and the rocket's motors will work for eight minutes. Once the terrible acceleration has stopped, and the Brennschluss set, the pilot will no doubt have a hard time getting his breath back as the gravity goes down from 4 g. to 1 g. to zero. At that point the pilot will find everything around him devoid of weight. He may have to drink water that has become bubbles and is floating all around him. Of course he could eat, because bodily functions do not depend on gravity. Men can drink when standing on their heads. But everything would have to be strapped down, including the crew until it was time for the rocket to back down and decelerate to the moon four days later.\n\nOn the moon the pilot would not find those craters as such, at least they would not be extinct volcanoes, but peltings that had hit the moon from an outside atmosphere, and left huge circular indentations, some as wide as 150 miles. Simon Newcomb described the moon as a world without weather on which nothing happens. Apparently that's why there is such a frenzy to get there. It might be the sanitarium of the solar system. But four days is a long time for such a short trip. Fritz Lang produced a picture years ago in Germany called Frau im Mond and the rocket got to the moon and back in two hours of playing time. George Pal produced Destination Moon in Hollywood in 1950 and cut the round trip down to 90 minutes. Almost any planetarium can give a really comfortable trip to the moon and back and by removing all the fictional sex appeal considered essential in motion pictures, complete the voyage in 45 minutes. In fact Dr. Dinsmore Alter, director of the Griffith Park Observatory, Los Angeles, has taken more than 100,000 persons on such trips since 1935. But magnetic energy engineers believe that anybody who has mastered magnetic propulsion can go from the moon to the earth in two seconds on a flying saucer. That puts the rocket ship realists practically back among the buggy whips. Illustrations of Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds In Collision (Doubleday) portraying balls of fire striking wide-mouthed primitive men whose only weapon was a spear were by no means as convincing as Bonestell's astronomically certified illustrations in Ley's The Conquest o f Space, but the net result in both instances seemed to move the whole subject back to the days when Camille Flammarion's features were the life of Hearst's American Weekly. That was in the good old days when agnostics read the magazine sections ins"
