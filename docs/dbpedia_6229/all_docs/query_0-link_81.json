He was also U.S. chargé d'affaires in Belarus (2009-13).\n\nScanlen, Thomas Charles (b. July 9, 1834, Albany district, Cape Colony [now in Eastern Cape, South Africa] - d. May 15, 1912, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia [now Harare, Zimbabwe]), prime minister of Cape Colony (1881-84).\n\nScappini Ricciardi, Marcelo (Eliseo) (b. Jan. 26, 1966, Asunción, Paraguay), Paraguayan diplomat. He was chargé d'affaires in Argentina (2011-12) and at the United Nations (2016-17).\n\nScarano\n\nScarce\n\nScarano, Alessandro (b. Sept. 3, 1983), captain-regent of San Marino (2023).\n\nScarascia-Mugnozza, Carlo (b. Jan. 19, 1920, Rome, Italy - d. May 13, 2004, Rome), Italian politician. He was European commissioner for agriculture (1972-73) and parliamentary affairs, environment, transport, and information (1973-77) and a vice president of the Commission (1972-77).\n\nScarbrough, Lawrence Roger Lumley, (11th) Earl of (b. July 27, 1896, York, England - d. June 29, 1969, Rotherham, Yorkshire, England), governor of Bombay (1937-43). He was knighted in 1937 and succeeded as earl in 1945.\n\nScarce, Kevin (John) (b. May 4, 1952, Adelaide, S.Aus.), governor of South Australia (2007-14).\n\nScargill\n\nScargill, Arthur (b. Jan. 11, 1938, Worsbrough Dale, Yorkshire, England), British labour leader. He became a miner at the age of 15 in 1953. He was recruited by the Communist Party's youth movement but at the end of the 1950s left and joined the Labour Party. He had been active in local unofficial disputes in the Yorkshire coalfield in 1969-70 and experimented with the flying pickets that were shortly to become famous. When the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) called an official strike in 1972, he pressed for his tactics to be employed nationally against ports, power stations, and depots. NUM headquarters in London asked him to lead a picket of 200 miners against the Saltley Coke Depot in Birmingham. By the fifth day Scargill had mustered a force of 10,000. The police withdrew, and he proclaimed \"the greatest victory of the working class in my lifetime.\" That year he worked his last shift at the colliery, and in 1973 he became the youngest person ever to be president of the Yorkshire miners. His organizational skills and presentational flair made him an effective champion. \"We want jam today and jam tomorrow\" was a typical Scargillism, indicating his attitude that nothing was too good for the miner. His reputation ensured his succession to the national presidency of the NUM when Joe Gormley stepped down in 1982. He moved the NUM headquarters from London to Sheffield and, impatient with the Trades Union Congress, withdrew from its General Council. In 1984 he succeeded in launching a national work stoppage, although it was not observed in the Nottinghamshire coalfield and in some other localities. But this time the forces of the state were better prepared, and after a year the miners gave up. In 1996 he left the Labour Party and formed the Socialist Labour Party.\n\nE. Scavenius\n\nScavenius, Erik (Julius Christian) (b. June 13, 1877, Klintholm, Denmark - d. Nov. 29, 1962, Copenhagen, Denmark), foreign minister (1909-10, 1913-20, 1940-45) and prime minister (1942-45) of Denmark; cousin of Harald Scavenius. He was also minister to Austria-Hungary and Italy (1912-13) and Sweden (1924-32).\n\nScavenius, Harald (Roger) (b. May 27, 1873, Gjorslev, Denmark - d. April 22, 1939, The Hague, Netherlands), foreign minister of Denmark (1920-22). He was also minister to Russia (1912-18), Italy (1923-28), and the Netherlands and Switzerland (1928-39).\n\nScavenius, Otto Christian (Jacob Jørgen Brønnum) (b. Dec. 10, 1875, Basnæs, Denmark - d. Sept. 10, 1945, Copenhagen, Denmark), foreign minister of Denmark (1920). He was also minister to Russia (1909-12) and Sweden (1912-19).\n\nSceberras Trigona (dei Baroni di Castel Cicciano), Alex(ander), Baron di Montagna di Marzo (b. March 3, 1950, Sliema, Malta), foreign minister of Malta (1981-87).\n\nScekic, Dragoslav (b. July 10, 1977, Berane, Montenegro), Montenegrin politician. He has been a deputy prime minister (2023-24) and minister of sports and youth (2023- ).\n\nScelba\n\nScelba, Mario (b. Sept. 5, 1901, Caltagirone, Sicily, Italy - d. Oct. 29, 1991, Rome, Italy), prime minister of Italy (1954-55). He became secretary and assistant to the Rev. Luigi Sturzo, founder of the Italian Popular Party. The party was outlawed while the Fascists were in power, and Scelba worked underground, helping to found the newspaper of what became the Christian Democratic Party. After the war he was elected to the Constituent Assembly (1946) and was also minister of posts and telecommunications (1945-47) before becoming interior minister (1947-53, 1954-55). In the latter post he was known for his firm opposition to Communism. Faced with threats to the public order from extremists of both the left and the right, he reorganized the police, adding manpower and equipment. The force's greatest test came in 1950 during a nationwide general strike when he authorized a strong suppression of demonstrations. In the ensuing street clashes, hundreds were wounded and thousands arrested. In 1952 he drafted a law defining and banning Fascism, known as the Scelba Law. As prime minister he maintained a centre-right coalition. He aided in the resolution of outstanding wartime issues and, in what he regarded as his finest hour, negotiations with Yugoslavia led to the return of Trieste to Italian control. He served again (1960-62) as interior minister, but his opposition to the inclusion of Socialists in coalitions led to his exclusion from succeeding governments. Scelba was elected to the Chamber of Deputies (1963) and then the Senate (1968), where he served until his retirement from active politics in 1983. In 1966 he was leader of the Christian Democrats, and from 1969 to 1971 he was president of the European Parliament.\n\nScepanovic, Milorad (b. 1956, Kolasin, Montenegro), Montenegrin diplomat. He has been non-resident ambassador to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia (2007-10) and South Africa (2016-19), permanent representative to the United Nations (2010-15), and ambassador to Russia (2020- ).\n\nSchaar, Axel friherre von (b. Dec. 15, 1641, Stockholm, Sweden - d. Nov. 18, 1702, Gävle, Gävleborg, Sweden), governor of Västernorrland (1699-1702). He was made friherre (baron) in 1699.\n\nSchacht, (Horace Greeley) Hjalmar (b. Jan. 22, 1877, Tingleff, Germany [now Tinglev, Denmark] - d. June 3, 1970, Munich, West Germany), German politician. He was president of the Reichsbank (1923-30, 1933-39) and economy minister (1934-37).\n\nSchacht Aristeguieta, Efraín (b. Aug. 12, 1921, Caracas, Venezuela - d. Feb. 6, 2007), foreign minister of Venezuela (1974-75).\n\nSchaefer\n\nSchaefer, William D(onald) (b. Nov. 2, 1921, Baltimore, Md. - d. April 18, 2011, Catonsville, Md.), mayor of Baltimore (1971-87) and governor of Maryland (1987-95).\n\nSchaerer (Vera y Aragón), Eduardo (b. Dec. 2, 1873, Caazapá, Paraguay - d. Nov. 12, 1941, Buenos Aires, Argentina), interior minister (1912) and president (1912-16) of Paraguay.\n\nSchafer\n\nSchafer, Edward T(homas) (b. Aug. 8, 1946, Bismarck, N.D.), governor of North Dakota (1992-2000). A Republican, he ran for Congress in 1990 and won 35% against Byron Dorgan; he was not the favourite in 1992 when popular governor George Sinner retired and Democrats had a primary fight between Attorney General Nick Spaeth and state Senate leader Bill Heigaard. Heigaard, pro-choice, won the party convention; Spaeth, anti-abortion and for state investment in economic development, won the June primary 65%-35%. Economic development was a major issue. Spaeth favoured the state government's \"Growing North Dakota\" plan, which he accused Schafer of taking advantage of its loans and tax breaks for his own business. Schafer favoured more local and private sector involvement. Schafer won by a solid 58%-41%, carrying all the major towns and all but seven counties, winning over 60% with voters under 60, while Spaeth got 55% from those 60 and over. After two years in office, Schafer pursued policies of lowering taxes and \"rightsizing\" government. He claimed credit for the 15,000 new jobs created in North Dakota and for the fact that census estimates showed it gained population for the first year in more than a decade. Republicans gained smartly in 1994 state elections, winning control of the state senate. Schafer was popular, and he was reelected in 1996 with 66% of the vote, beating Democratic state representative Lee Kaldor. In 2008-09 he was U.S. agriculture secretary.\n\nSchäffer, Fritz (b.

Feb. 28, 1965, Vienna, Austria), president of Austria (1957-65). In 1933-34 he was a member of the Federal Council (upper house of parliament) and belonged to the federal executive of the Socialist Party (SPÖ). When Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss abolished parliament in 1934, Schärf was arrested and sent to the Wöllersdorf concentration camp for nine months. After his release he was active in the continuation of the underground Socialist movement and became the leader of the revolutionary branch which in 1934 resolved that \"the working class must overthrow the fascist dictatorship and hold fast to power by means of a revolutionary dictatorship.\" After the Anschluss with Nazi Germany in 1938, he was arrested twice more and spent many months in prison. During World War II he had contact with German resistance circles. After the liberation of Austria in 1945, he became chairman of the SPÖ (1945-57), vice chancellor (1945-57), and justice minister (1954-55). He was instrumental in the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty in 1955, which made Austria sovereign after ten years of Allied occupation. After the death of Pres. Theodor Körner, Schärf as SPÖ nominee was elected president with 51% of the vote against 49% for Wolfgang Denk, the candidate of the People's Party and Freedom Party. Reelected in 1963 with 55% of the vote (against 41% for Julius Raab), he died in office himself.\n\nScharling, Hans William (b. Sept. 22, 1837, Copenhagen, Denmark - d.

Dec. 2, 1947, Niederelbert, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany), German politician. He became chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1993. As its chancellor candidate in the 1994 general election, he was defeated by Helmut Kohl. Handed the consolation job of SPD parliamentary leader, he made the most of the Bundestag lower house of parliament as a platform for often scathing attacks on Kohl's failure to fight unemployment. Scharping looked to be out of front-line politics in 1995 when the party replaced him as chairman, carrying the can for a further slide in party fortunes after his lacklustre campaign. But, in a remarkable turnaround, the 1998 SPD chancellor candidate Gerhard Schröder - a prime mover behind Scharping's sacking - tapped the former leader as his campaign spokesman on foreign or security affairs. After Schröder's victory, Scharping became defense minister. In the summer of 2001 he came under fire for magazine photos that showed him and his girlfriend splashing in a pool on the Spanish resort island of Mallorca just as German troops prepared to head to Macedonia. Then came revelations he used an air force plane to return overnight to Mallorca at taxpayers' expense between two official engagements. The scandal was forgotten after the September 11 attacks in the United States. In 2002, the opposition tried to unseat Scharping over allegations he broke budget laws concerning the purchase of A400M Airbus military transports. Schröder finally fired him in July 2002 following reports he took $72,000 in royalties from a public relations adviser. In 2005 he became president of the Federation of German Cyclists.\n\nSchäuble\n\nSchäuble, Wolfgang (b. Sept. 18, 1942, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany - d. Dec. 26, 2023), German politician. He joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 1965 and was first elected to the Bundestag in 1972. From 1984 to 1989 he was minister for special tasks, and from 1989 to 1991 interior minister. He was dubbed \"the architect of German unity\" for negotiating the treaty with East Germany which led to unification in 1990. It was at the hour of his greatest political triumph that Schäuble was shot in the back by a deranged man at a 1990 election campaign meeting. Paralyzed from the waist down, he was confined to a wheelchair. He staged a remarkable political comeback, attending a cabinet meeting less than two months after the shooting. Schäuble survived as an influential figure by never openly challenging Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Kohl surprised even Schäuble, his parliamentary chief, by naming him in 1997 as his chosen successor. Schäuble's political style was fundamentally different from Kohl's, but both men shared the same basic political convictions. When Kohl, after losing the 1998 election, resigned as chairman of the CDU, Schäuble succeeded him. But in the course of a party finance scandal, which he pledged to clear up, he was caught in a web of contradictions that ruined his credibility, and he resigned in 2000. When the CDU returned to power, he became again interior minister (2005-09), then finance minister (2009-17), in which role he became the face of austerity demanded especially from Greece in its debt crisis. He became the longest-serving member in the history of the Bundestag in 2014, and in that of any German national parliament in 2017. In 2017-21 he was president of the Bundestag.

He became his party's chairman in 1968, and the next year he helped to form a coalition between the FDP and the Social Democratic Party and returned to the cabinet as foreign minister and vice-chancellor to Willy Brandt. He helped prepare and implement Brandt's policy of Ostpolitik, improving relations with East Germany and the Soviet Union.

Toward the war's end, he advocated a \"peace without annexations or indemnities.\" In October 1918 he was appointed minister without portfolio in the last imperial cabinet. The Social Democrats planned to support a constitutional monarchy in Germany, but on the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II, and in the face of leftist uprisings, Scheidemann, without party or government authorization, proclaimed the republic from the balcony of the Reichstag on Nov. 9, 1918. From November 1918 to February 1919 he served on the six-member Council of People's Commissioners, as minister of finance and (from December) colonies.

In June 1933 he was appointed a Reichsleiter (the highest party rank after the Führer) and was made national youth leader (Reichsjugendführer), directing all Nazi youth organizations, including the Hitler Youth (Hitlerjugend). His enthusiasm was extremely infectious, and to countless German children and adolescents he became the embodiment of their ideals. In October 1939 it was announced that he, the pattern of German manhood, had been rejected for army service by a medical board. In January 1940, conscious possibly of loss of prestige, he was said to have enlisted as a volunteer. In August, however, he was relieved of his position as leader of the Hitler Youth and appointed Gauleiter (party district leader) and Reichsstatthalter (governor) of Vienna, where he helped organize the deportation of Jews to extermination camps in the east. Arrested by the Allies in 1945, he was indicted (August 29) by the International Military Tribunal to stand trial as one of the major Nazi war criminals.

He was also minister of fisheries (1996-97) and minister at the prime minister's office (2009-13).\n\nSchläppy, Rémy (b. Feb. 20, 1917 - d. July 9, 2003, Crostand village, Neuchâtel, Switzerland), president of the Council of State of Neuchâtel (1969-70, 1975-76, 1979-80).\n\nSchlaug\n\nSchlaug, (Axel) Birger (b. Jan. 29, 1949, Stockholm, Sweden), Swedish politician. He was co-speaker of the Green Party in 1985-88 and 1992-2000 and a member of parliament in 1988-89 and again in 1994-2001.\n\nSchlebusch, Alwyn (Louis) (b. Sept. 16, 1917, Lady Grey, South Africa - d. Jan. 7, 2008, Pretoria, South Africa), South African politician. He served as mayor of Henneman, Orange Free State, in the 1940s, and as MP for Kroonstad from 1962 to 1980. In 1972, he was appointed to head the notorious Schlebusch Commission of Inquiry, which resulted in legislation that allowed the authorities to declare civil society organizations \"affected.\" This meant they could not receive foreign funding, and allowed the state to seize money they already had. Among the organizations declared affected as a direct result of Schlebusch's recommendations were the National Union of South African Students and the Christian Institute, while the commission also attacked the South African Institute of Race Relations. He became speaker of the National Assembly (1974-76) and minister of public works (1976-78), immigration (1976-79), interior (1978-80), and justice (1979-80). In 1980, he recommended abandoning the Westminster system and converting the Senate into a president's council, made up of nominated whites, Coloureds, and Indians, as a think tank for ideas on a new constitutional dispensation. The council, established under his leadership, was a first step towards the tricameral parliamentary system - a doomed attempt to co-opt Coloureds and Indians into the system while excluding blacks. Along with the leadership of the council, Schlebusch was made vice state president (1981-84). He was the only person ever to hold the title, which was scrapped when P.W. Botha became the country's first executive, rather than ceremonial, state president. Subsequently he also held the position under Botha of minister in the office of the president (1986-88).\n\nSchlebusch, Hubert (b. June 28, 1893, München-Gladbach, Prussia [now Mönchengladbach, Nordrhein-Westfalen], Germany - d. Oct. 20, 1955, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen, West Germany), minister-president of Braunschweig (1945-46).\n\nSchlegelberger, Franz (b. Oct. 23, 1876, Königsberg, Germany [now Kaliningrad, Russia] - d. Dec. 14, 1970, Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, West Germany), acting justice minister of Germany (1941-42).\n\nSchlegelberger, Günther (b. Sept. 29, 1909, Berlin, Germany - d. March 23, 1974, Panama City, Panama), West German diplomat; son of Franz Schlegelberger. He was ambassador to the Philippines (1963-64), South Vietnam (1964-65), and Panama (1972-74).\n\nSchleicher\n\nSchleicher, Kurt (Ferdinand Friedrich Hermann) von (b. April 7, 1882, Brandenburg, Germany - d. June 30, 1934, Neubabelsberg [now part of Potsdam], Germany), chancellor of Germany (1932-33). Entering the army in 1900, he joined the general staff in 1913. Wilhelm Groener, appointed quartermaster general in 1918, made Schleicher his personal assistant in the political division of general headquarters. In 1919 he was employed in a similar capacity in the newly created Reichswehr, and during the emergency of 1923-24 was aide-de-camp to Gen. Hans von Seeckt, chief of the army command. By 1929, as major general, he was in charge of a newly created office in the Reichswehr ministry. For the next three years, Schleicher - with Defense Minister Groener, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning, and Pres. Paul von Hindenburg - was one of the determining forces in the Weimar Republic. He came into sharp conflict with Brüning and Hindenburg; his intrigues contributed to Brüning's downfall and the appointment (June 1932) of Franz von Papen as chancellor. Schleicher became defense minister and, when Papen was forced to resign (Dec. 1, 1932), chancellor as well. He opposed the rising power of the Nazis and sought to save Germany by identifying the president with the Reichswehr and by making the Reichswehr the source of political power. He offered to participate in a government with Hitler as chancellor on condition that he, Schleicher, should remain in charge of the Reichswehr. Hitler refused and thereafter regarded Schleicher as his chief enemy. In January 1933 Hindenburg dismissed Schleicher and made Hitler chancellor. A year and a half later, Schleicher was murdered in his house by Hitler's SS (Schutzstaffel), during the \"night of the long knives,\" in which many of Hitler's opponents were eliminated.\n\nSchleinitz, Alexander (Gustav Adolph) Graf von (b. Dec. 29, 1807, Blankenburg, Kingdom of Westphalia [now in Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany] - d. Feb. 19, 1885, Berlin, Germany), foreign minister of Prussia (1848, 1849-50, 1858-61); brother of Wilhelm Freiherr von Schleinitz. He was also minister to Hanover and Brunswick (1848-49, 1850-51) and minister of the royal house (1861-85). He was raised from Freiherr (baron) to Graf (count) in 1879.\n\nSchleinitz, Georg (Emil Gustav) Freiherr von (b. June 17, 1834, Bromberg, Prussia [now Bydgoszcz, Poland] - d. Dec. 2, 1910, near Lügde, Prussia [now in Nordrhein-Westfalen], Germany), Landeshauptmann of German New Guinea (1886-88); son of Johann Eduard Christoph Freiherr von Schleinitz.\n\nSchleinitz, Johann Eduard Christoph Freiherr von (b.

Nov. 3, 1856, Braunschweig, Brunswick [now in Niedersachsen, Germany]), minister of justice (1830-56), foreign affairs (1830-31, 1848-56), interior (1831-48), and military affairs (1851-56) of Brunswick.\n\nSchleinzer, Karl (b. Jan. 8, 1924, St. Gertraud [now part of Frantschach-St. Gertraud], Kärnten, Austria - d. July 19, 1975, Bruck an der Mur, Steiermark, Austria), defense minister of Austria (1961-64).\n\nSchlesinger\n\nSchlesinger, James R(odney) (b. Feb. 15, 1929, New York City - d.

June 13, 1954, Otjiwarongo, Otjozondjupa region, South West Africa [now Namibia]), finance minister of Namibia (2015-20). He has also been minister of trade and industry (2012-15) and agriculture, water, and land reform (2020- ).\n\nJ.L. Schley\n\nSchley, Julian L(arcombe) (b. Feb. 23, 1880, Savannah, Ga. - d. March 29, 1965, Washington, D.C.), governor of the Panama Canal Zone (1932-36). He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1903 and promoted through the ranks to lieutenant colonel on Oct. 17, 1926. He was assistant to the engineer commissioner of D.C. in 1912-13; commander of the 307th Engineers Regiment and later Corps of Engineer, 5th Corps, World War I, in 1917-18; and Panama Canal maintenance engineer in 1928-32. Under his tenure as Canal Zone governor, construction of Madden Dam was begun and finished, creating the additional canal water supply that would provide for future traffic expansion. He had anticipated a need for building up and maintaining a high quality work force, and to this end he brought more trained men into the canal's working organization and instituted a training program to prepare young men in the skills and crafts to serve as potential future workers. Like Gov. Jay J. Morrow, Schley faced a bitter task of reorganization. In the face of worldwide depression and consequent decreased tolls from shipping, a reduction in force became necessary. He accomplished the task by judiciously paring here and trimming there, yet at the same time never impairing nor handicapping the efficient canal organization. During his tenure as governor, the Thatcher Highway and Ferry were opened on Sept. 1, 1932; the Canal Zone College was opened on Sept. 25, 1933; Cristobal High School was completed in 1933; plans were approved for a new townsite at Gatun; Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt visited on July 11, 1934, and Oct. 16, 1935; a Goethals 3-cent stamp was placed on sale on Aug. 15, 1934; and the apprentice-learner program began in 1935. He retired on Sept. 30, 1941.\n\nSchley, William (b. Dec. 10, 1786, Frederick, Md. - d. Nov. 20, 1858, Augusta, Ga.), governor of Georgia (1835-37).\n\nSchlieben, (Hans August) Otto von (b. Jan. 14, 1875, Gross-Rinnersdorf, Prussia, Germany [now Rynarcice, Poland] - d.

December 1739, Moscow, Russia), governor of Estonia (1704-06).\n\nSchlögl, Karl (b. Jan. 28, 1955, Vienna, Austria), interior minister of Austria (1997-2000).\n\nSchlumpf, Leon (b. Feb. 3, 1925, Felsberg, Graubünden, Switzerland - d. July 7, 2012, Chur, Graubünden), president of the Small Council (1969) and president of the government (1974) of Graubünden and president of Switzerland (1984). He was also minister of transport, communications, and energy (1980-87).\n\nSchlüter\n\nSchlüter, Poul (Holmskov) (b. April 3, 1929, Tønder, Sønderjylland, Denmark - d. May 27, 2021), prime minister of Denmark (1982-93). His interest in politics developed early, and at the age of 16 he chaired the Sønderjylland Conservative Youth organization. In 1952-55 he was national chairman of the organization. He was active in the World Association of Youth and in that connection visited more than 30 countries. He was elected to parliament in September 1964, became Conservative Party spokesman in 1971, chaired the party parliamentary group in 1974, and in 1980 became party chairman. He took over as prime minister in 1982 after Anker Jørgensen and his minority Social Democratic government resigned without forcing an election. Schlüter, who for several months had been advocating a broad national coalition as signs of an approaching economic catastrophe became ever more apparent, formed his government with the participation of the Liberal Democrats (Venstre), the Centre Democrats, and the Christian People's Party. He inherited formidable problems, including soaring balance of payments and budgetary deficits and growing unemployment. Although his appointment was greeted by left-wing demonstrations outside Christiansborg Castle (the parliament building) and skepticism on the part of the trade unions, Schlüter enjoyed generally good opinion poll ratings. A scandal involving the illegal actions of the Ministry of Justice in preventing the immigration of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka brought to an end the 10-year rule of Schlüter's centre-right minority government.\n\nSchlyter, Karl (Johan Daniel) (b. Dec. 21, 1879, Karlskrona, Blekinge, Sweden - d. Dec. 25, 1959, Stockholm, Sweden), justice minister of Sweden (1932-36).\n\nSchmaltz, Julien (Désiré), governor of Senegal (1816-17, 1819-20).\n\nSchmedeman, Albert G(eorge) (b.

Schmid\n\nSchmid, Carlo, original name Karl Johann Martin Heinrich Schmid (b. Dec. 3, 1896, Perpignan, France - d. Dec. 11, 1979, Bonn, West Germany), West German politician. The son of a German father and a French mother, he renounced French nationality at the outset of World War I and enlisted in the German army. During World War II he was a legal adviser to the German command in occupied France. After the war he became state president of Württemberg-Hohenzollern (1945-47 and [acting] 1948). In 1947 he became a member of the executive committee of the Social Democratic Party. He played a significant role in formulating the Basic Law (constitution) of West Germany and was (1949-66 and 1969-72) vice-president of the Bundestag (parliament). He was influential in bringing about the post-World War II reconciliation between West Germany and France, cemented by Gen. Charles de Gaulle and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1963. From 1963 to 1966 Schmid was president of the assembly of the Western European Union. He retired in 1972.\n\nSchmid, Peter (b. 1941), president of the government of Bern (1983-84, 1990-91); brother of Samuel Schmid.\n\nP. Schmid(-S.)\n\nS.

He was also German minister of food and agriculture (2014-18) and transportation and digital infrastructure (acting, 2017-18).\n\nSchmidt, Felipe (b. May 4, 1859, Lages, Santa Catarina, Brazil - d. May 9, 1930, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), governor of Santa Catarina (1898-1902, 1914-18).\n\nSchmidt, Georg Lars friherre af (b. Nov. 26, 1771, Stockholm, Sweden - d. Jan. 31, 1842, Umeå, Västerbotten, Sweden), governor of Västerbotten (1817-42). He was ennobled (adding \"af\") in 1815 and made friherre (baron) in 1841.\n\nSchmidt, Guido (b. Jan. 15, 1901, Bludenz, Austria - d. Dec. 5, 1957, Vienna, Austria), foreign minister of Austria (1936-38).\n\nH. Schmidt\n\nSchmidt, Helmut (Heinrich Waldemar) (b. Dec. 23, 1918, Hamburg, Germany - d. Nov. 10, 2015, Hamburg), chancellor of West Germany (1974-82). After World War II he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and served in the economics and transport sector of the Hamburg municipal government (1949-53). Elected to the Bundestag in 1953, he gave up his seat in 1961 and returned to Hamburg as senator (minister) for internal affairs, where he distinguished himself by his handling of a flood disaster in 1962. In 1965 he was reelected to the Bundestag, and he was the SPD's parliamentary leader in 1967-69. He became a vice-chairman of the SPD in 1968 and served as minister of defense (1969-72) and finance (1972-74) in the government of Chancellor Willy Brandt. He was elected to the chancellorship in 1974, following the resignation of Brandt, who, however, remained party chairman. Schmidt acquired the reputation of an effective crisis manager, won the esteem of many West Germans, and became one of the most respected and influential of Western Europe's leaders. In foreign affairs he sought reconciliation with the Soviet-bloc countries of Eastern Europe (and cultivated closer ties with East Germany) while at the same time maintaining West Germany's partnership with the United States. The governing coalition of the SPD and the liberal Free Democratic Party was reelected in 1976 and 1980. During the worldwide recession of the early 1980s, his refusal to cut social-welfare programs prompted the Free Democrats to defect from the coalition, and he lost the chancellorship through a vote of no confidence in the Bundestag on Oct. 1, 1982. He continued to serve as a member of the Bundestag until his retirement from politics in 1987. He remained influential as co-publisher of the weekly Die Zeit.\n\nSchmidt, Robert (b. May 15, 1864, Berlin, Prussia [Germany] - d. Sept. 16, 1943, Berlin), vice chancellor of Germany (1923).

Nov. 17, 1947, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia [now in Slovakia]), finance minister of Slovakia (1998-2002). She was a leading figure in the reformed-Communist Party of the Democratic Left and was widely respected in Slovakia for her role as deputy prime minister with responsibility for the economy in the Jozef Moravcík government in 1994. As finance minister, she was known for tough policies aimed at securing the country's entry into the European Union by 2004. She became a symbol for economic measures that stabilized the economy and the financial sector, but also brought increased prices and rising unemployment. Her party asked her to resign in 2002, hoping that this would boost its sagging popularity. She then became executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (2002-05).\n\nSchmoke\n\nSchmoke, Kurt L(idell) (b. Dec. 1, 1949, Baltimore, Md.), mayor of Baltimore (1987-99). In 1977, he joined Pres. Jimmy Carter's White House domestic policy staff. A year later, he returned to Baltimore as an assistant United States attorney. Four years later, he was elected state's attorney, the city's chief prosecuting officer. On Nov. 3, 1987, he became the first black to be elected mayor of Baltimore. He beat interim mayor Clarence Burns, an older and highly popular candidate (also black) who had the backing of the city's former mayor, William D. Schaefer, and a circle of powerful friends. Schmoke won the race by appealing to young and liberal voters - and by addressing the many problems that were still facing Baltimore despite the city's well-publicized cosmetic improvements. Schmoke's agenda was not nearly as flamboyant as that of Schaefer, but it was certainly more pragmatic.\n\nSchmücker, Kurt (b. Nov. 10, 1919, Löningen, Oldenburg [now in Niedersachsen], Germany - d. Jan. 6, 1996, Löningen), economy minister (1963-66) and finance minister (1966) of West Germany. He was also minister of federal treasure (1966-69).\n\nSchmude, Jürgen (Dieter Paul) (b.

June 12, 1994, New York City), Orthodox Jewish leader. The undisputed leader for 44 years of the New York-based Lubavitch Chassidic movement, he built a religious empire from the remnants of an insular Russian group that almost came to an end with the Holocaust, turning it into one of the most influential forces in world Jewry, with a following of some 200,000 believers worldwide. His \"mitzvah tanks\" - converted campers that served as recruiting stations - roamed New York City; toll-free telephone numbers, satellite television hookups, and faxes of Talmudic disquisitions were made available; and full-page newspaper advertisements were published. For decades, supplicants lined up by the thousands outside his residence on Sunday mornings; to each visitor Schneerson, a mesmeric figure with piercing blue eyes and a full white beard, offered a word of blessing and a crisp new dollar bill. The Sorbonne-educated scholar, who emigrated from France to the United States in 1941, became the seventh Lubavitcher grand rabbi in 1950 following the death of his father-in-law. Though he did not venture beyond Crown Heights, Brooklyn, the site of the Lubavitch World Headquarters, in 37 years, he had a strong influence on Israeli politics, both in the Knesset (parliament) and among the electorate. He was criticized by both Reform and Conservative Jewish leaders for allowing a cult of personality to grow around him, although he denied any such intent. Many of his followers even revered him as the potential Messiah, and his death caused great consternation; a persistent group still awaited his resurrection years later. He was childless and left no successor.\n\nSchneider, Antoine Virgile (b. March 22, 1779, Bouquenom [now in Bas-Rhin département], France - d. July 11, 1847, Paris, France), war minister of France (1839-40).\n\nB. Schneider\n\nSchneider, Barbara (b.

Aug. 19, 1932, Baden, near Vienna, Austria), chancellor of Austria (1921-22, 1922, 1929-30). Entering the imperial Austrian police service as a young man, he became president of police in 1918, some months before the fall of the Habsburg monarchy at the end of World War I. On the proclamation of the Austrian republic in November, he placed his force at the disposal of the new government, and did much to ensure a peaceful change of regime. At the same time he secured the safety of the ex-imperial family, whose departure from Vienna he supervised. His administrative ability and, above all, his honesty gained him the confidence of moderate public opinion in Austria and especially of the inter-Allied missions and advisers. Thus he was selected to form a coalition government (June 1921) supported by the Social Christians and Pan-Germans; he also took the post of foreign minister. He sought to establish friendly relations with the successor states of the late empire when he signed the Treaty of Lány with Czechoslovakia on Dec. 16, 1921. But the Pan-Germans resented any treaty with Czechoslovakia as putting difficulties in the way of ultimate union with Germany; they withdrew from the government and in May 1922 Schober resigned, returning to the post of president of police. In July 1927 he was responsible for the bloody suppression of a labour protest in Vienna, in which nearly 100 people were killed. He served as chancellor and foreign minister again from September 1929 to September 1930 and as vice-chancellor and foreign minister from December 1930 to January 1932. In March 1931 he concluded an agreement with Germany which would have led to an Austro-German customs union but which under French and Czechoslovak pressure had to be abandoned. He was also president of the International Criminal Police Commission (1923-32).\n\nSchobinger, Josef Anton (b. Jan. 30, 1849, Luzern, Switzerland - d.

Aug. 14, 1921, Rosenau castle, near Zwettl, Austria), Austrian politician. First elected to the Reichsrat (parliament) as a liberal in 1873, he gradually developed a Prussophile, anti-Semitic position and in 1879 became leader of the Pan-German movement, acquiring a strong personal following, especially among the Viennese lower middle class and the nationalist fraternities (Burschenschaften). In 1885 a Pan-German parliamentary party was formed, which languished after his 1888 imprisonment for an assault on a newspaper office (he also lost his parliamentary seat and his knightly title) but quickly revived following his reelection to parliament in 1897. In the latter year he led the attacks upon pro-Czech language ordinances and was popularly credited with having driven Prime Minister Kasimir Graf von Badeni from office. After 1898 he became closely associated with the anti-Catholic \"Los von Rom\" movement. He reached the peak of his parliamentary power in 1901, when 21 Pan-Germans were elected to the Reichsrat; his violent temperament, however, caused splits in the party and by 1907 it had all but disappeared from Austrian parliamentary politics. His ideological influence remained, and had a notable effect on the young Adolf Hitler.\n\nSchönleben, Johan Benedikt friherre von (b. Oct. 30, 1613, Bautzen, Bohemia [now in Sachsen, Germany] - d.

At the age of four he was already making speeches from the stairs of his home. In 1956 he became campaign manager for Jake Schulz, federal member of parliament for Springfield (Manitoba) and a moving force in the Manitoba Farmers' Union. As a candidate of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (which later became the New Democratic Party), Schreyer himself was elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1958 and represented the riding of Brokenhead until 1965. From 1965 to 1969 he was a federal member of parliament from Manitoba. He was not happy living in Ottawa, however, and did not hesitate to return to Manitoba in June 1969, when he was chosen leader of the New Democratic Party in the province. Resigning his federal seat, he was immediately plunged into a provincial election campaign. Both he and his party were victorious, Schreyer winning the riding of Rossmere and becoming premier of Manitoba. When his party lost in the 1977 Manitoba election, he had to step down as premier. After a period of leader of the opposition in the Manitoba legislature he accepted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's offer to move to Rideau Hall, Ottawa, as Canada's 22nd governor general, taking office on Jan. 22, 1979. Of German extraction, he was not only the youngest but also the first person of neither English nor French descent to hold the office.\n\nSchreyer, Michaele (b.

Dec. 31, 1989, Kampen, Sylt island, West Germany), West German politician. He was a co-founder of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). In 1949 he was elected to the first Bundestag, representing the Protestant branch of the CDU. Schröder served three chancellors as minister of the interior (1953-61), foreign affairs (1961-66), and defense (1966-69). He ran for chancellor against Kurt Georg Kiesinger in 1966, and in 1969 he lost a bid for the presidency by only six votes. In 1980 he retired from the Bundestag, where he had been chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee since 1969.\n\nSchröder\n\nSchröder, Gerhard (Fritz Kurt) (b. April 7, 1944, Mossenberg, Lippe [now part of Blomberg, Nordrhein-Westfalen], Germany), chancellor of Germany (1998-2005). In 1963 he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and was active in the Young Socialists, the SPD's youth organization. He led the Young Socialists in 1978-80 and entered parliament in 1980. He was defeated as SPD candidate for minister-president of Niedersachsen in the 1986 election, but after four years leading the state opposition, he was elected in 1990 and reelected in 1994 and 1998. With the latter election he clinched his nomination as the SPD's chancellor candidate for that year's general elections. He managed to unite the party behind him and put together a remarkably blemish-free campaign with a single goal: Helmut Kohl must go. His opponents struggled to get to grips with him, accusing him of being all style and little substance. Schröder tried to preserve his image as a pro-business moderate in the mould of U.S. president Bill Clinton or Britain's Tony Blair. The dashing, telegenic Schröder defeated Kohl, who had led Germany for 16 years, by an unexpectedly wide margin. He thus became only the second candidate (after Willy Brandt in 1972) to lead the SPD to become the biggest party. Schröder formed a coalition with the Greens. His government deployed German troops in Kosovo (1999) and Afghanistan (2001) but opposed the 2003 Iraq War, leading to strained relations with the U.S. After his reelection in 2002, he embarked on a program of cutting unemployment benefits which proved unpopular, not least in his own party, and he resigned the post of party chairman (which he had assumed in 1999) in 2004. After setbacks in state elections in 2005, he engineered an early federal election, in which his government was defeated. He later controversially worked for Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom.\n\nSchröderheim, Elis, original surname Schröder (b. March 26, 1747, Stockholm, Sweden - d.

While foreign minister he promoted European economic and military unity and, with it, Franco-German reconciliation to prevent another war between the two nations. The economic aspect of the Schuman Plan, put forward by him in May 1950, became a reality in June 1952 with the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community, a six-nation Western European economic union and one of the forerunners of what ultimately became the European Union. However, the idea of an integrated European army, launched by Schuman and Prime Minister René Pleven in November 1950, met with strong opposition (it was finally rejected by the Chamber of Deputies in 1954). He served as the first president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Economic Community in 1958-60 and was a member until February 1963. Within the MRP, Schuman was from 1958 the chief opponent of the right-wing extremism of Georges Bidault.\n\nSchumann\n\nSchumann, Maurice (b. April 10, 1911, Paris, France - d. Feb. 10, 1998, Paris), French politician. Long before playing a leading role in French politics, he entered history books as the \"Voice of France\" in exile and Gen. Charles de Gaulle's spokesman during World War II. During the 1940-44 years when France was under Nazi German occupation, he was the main speaker of a programme called \"Les Français parlent aux Français\" (The French speak to the French) beamed from London to keep up spirits in occupied France. His passionate denunciations of collaborators more than once led to their killings by Resistance fighters who received esoteric coded orders such as \"The carrots are cooked\" or \"Franklin is arriving\" over the same programme. His high profile wartime role ensured him easy access to post-war national politics. He helped found the Popular Republican Movement, France's main christian-democratic party, and was elected to the National Assembly. He was deputy foreign minister in 1951-54 and headed parliament's foreign affairs committee for most of the period 1957-68. He gained full ministerial rank after de Gaulle returned to power in 1958, holding such posts as minister for scientific research and later for social affairs. He was appointed foreign minister in 1969 under Pres. Georges Pompidou, devoting much of his time to European affairs and playing a leading role in the nascent Common Market. He resigned in 1973 after losing his seat in a general election but was elected to the Senate the following year, standing for the Gaullist RPR party in the Lille area of northern France. He was Senate vice-president from 1977 to 1983. He became a member of the Académie française in 1974.\n\nSchumpeter\n\nSchumpeter, Joseph (Alois) (b. Feb. 8, 1883, Triesch, Moravia, Austria [now Trest, Czech Republic] - d. Jan. 8, 1950, Taconic, Conn.), finance minister of Austria (1919). He is chiefly known as an economist. A few well-received books led to the appointment as finance minister. It was a period of hyperinflation, and Schumpeter lasted only seven months in the job. He was professor of economics at the University of Bonn (1925-32), then joined the faculty of Harvard University (1932-50). His writings include Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung (1912; The Theory of Economic Development); Business Cycles: A Theoretical, Historical, and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process, 2 vol. (1939; rev. ed. 1964); the widely read Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (1942), in which he argued that capitalism would eventually perish of its own success, giving way to some form of public control or socialism; and History of Economic Analysis (1954; reprinted 1966), an exhaustive study of the development of analytic methods in economics. He took part in the founding of the Econometric Society in 1930 and was its president in 1939-41. He was also president of the American Economic Association in 1948.\n\nSchumy, Vinzenz (b. July 28, 1878, Saak, Kärnten, Austria - d. Dec. 13, 1962, Vienna, Austria), vice chancellor (1929) and interior minister (1929-30, 1933) of Austria.\n\nSchürmann, Carl Willem Alwin (b. Jan. 6, 1903, Rotterdam, Netherlands - d. Jan. 21, 1994, Geneva, Switzerland), Dutch diplomat. He was ambassador to Thailand (1948-50) and the United States (1964-69) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1955-64).\n\nSchurz\n\nSchurz, Carl (Christian) (b. March 2, 1829, Liblar, near Cologne, Prussia [now in Germany] - d. May 14, 1906, New York City), U.S. secretary of the interior (1877-81). As a student at the University of Bonn he became involved in the German revolutionary movement of 1848. Forced to flee from Germany, he eventually came to the United States (1852). He became active in the anti-slavery movement, and, as a delegate to the Republican National Convention of 1860, worked for the nomination of Abraham Lincoln for president. Lincoln appointed him minister to Spain in March 1861, but in December he resigned to join the Union army, receiving a commission as brigadier general of volunteers in 1862. He commanded troops at the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 1862) and at Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Chattanooga (all 1863). After the war he toured the South for Pres. Andrew Johnson. His report strongly advocated rights for blacks, but Johnson resisted these views and shelved the report. As U.S. senator from Missouri in 1869-75 - his only elective office - he broke with Pres. Ulysses S. Grant on reconstruction policy and other issues, leading him in 1872 to help organize the Liberal Republican Party, opposing Grant's renomination. He rejoined the Republicans in 1876, supporting Rutherford B. Hayes on the issues of hard money and good government. Serving as President Hayes's secretary of the interior, he promoted civil service reform and an improved Indian policy. Continuing his interest in honest government, he headed the National Civil Service Reform League in 1892-1901. He broke with the Republicans twice more, leading an independent Republican (\"Mugwump\") bolt from James G. Blaine in 1884 to back Democrat Grover Cleveland, and abandoning William McKinley in 1900 on the issue of overseas expansion.\n\nSchuschnigg\n\nSchuschnigg, Kurt (Alois Josef Johann von) (b. Dec. 14, 1897, Riva del Garda, Trento, Austria [now in Italy] - d. Nov. 18, 1977, Mutters, near Innsbruck, Austria), chancellor of Austria (1934-38). He was elected to the Nationalrat (lower house of parliament) for the Christian Social Party in 1927 and showed monarchist and strongly anti-Socialist proclivities. In 1930 he founded the Ostmärkische Sturmscharen, a paramilitary organization in opposition to the Heimwehr. In the government of Engelbert Dollfuss he was minister of justice (1932-34) and education (1933-34); after the assassination of Dollfuss by Nazi extremists, he was named federal chancellor and also took charge of the defense ministry. He eliminated the threat of the Heimwehr, forcing its leader, Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, out of office as vice chancellor in May 1936 and disbanding the Heimwehr in October. He tried to maintain Austrian independence while making concessions to Adolf Hitler; in 1936 he freed Nazi prisoners and said he would conduct Austrian foreign policy in line with German interests. At a February 1938 meeting with Hitler at Berchtesgaden he gave in to insistent demands that he place Nazis in his government, but on his return he made his most defiant gesture, scheduling a plebiscite on independence for March 13. Before it could be held, he was forced to resign (March 11) and Germany invaded and annexed Austria. He was held in solitary confinement and later sent to concentration camps, being liberated by American forces in May 1945. The second Austrian republic was strongly influenced by the Socialists and had no place for a man who had condoned their suppression in 1934, so he lived in Italy and then (1948-67) in the United States before returning to Austria.\n\nSchüssel\n\nSchüssel, Wolfgang (b. June 7, 1945, Vienna, Austria), vice-chancellor and foreign minister (1995-2000) and chancellor (2000-07) of Austria. He was also minister of economic affairs (1989-95) and interior (2007) and chairman of the Austrian People's Party (1995-2007).\n\nSchuster\n\nSchuster, Rudolf (b. Jan. 4, 1934, Medzev village, eastern Slovakia), president of Slovakia (1999-2004). He was mayor (1983-86) of Slovakia's second city, Kosice, a member of the Slovak Communist Party Central Committee from 1986 until the 1989 revolution, and head of the last Communist parliament in Slovakia (1989-90). After 1989 his past did little to slow his career progress. He became Czechoslovak ambassador in Canada (1990-92) and later head of the Party of Civic Understanding (SOP) and again mayor of Kosice (1994-98). When Michal Kovác's presidential term ended in 1998, parliament was far too divided to agree on a successor. A referendum to circumvent the problem with a direct ballot of the people was scuppered by Prime Minister Vladimír Meciar's interior minister, Gustáv Krajci, in violation of the constitution. The government of Prime Minister Mikulás Dzurinda changed the rules to allow for a popular ballot and in 1999 Schuster was elected in a second round run-off vote with Meciar, taking 57.2% to his opponent's 42.8%. While short on the personal charisma and oratorical talent of Meciar, he was, in the words of Dzurinda, the only candidate \"acceptable to the outside world.\" Dzurinda, whose fragile five-party coalition government backed Schuster, hoped in particular that he could \"lead the country towards Euro-Atlantic integration,\" specifically membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Schuster himself said his chief aim was to \"ensure the confidence of foreigners, to bring in more credit and satisfy the expectations of foreign investors.\" Above all he was seen as the man who could help Bratislava move towards the West. He had supported Dzurinda's decision to allow NATO warplanes bombing Yugoslavia to use Slovakia's airspace.\n\nSchutte, Danie(l Pieter Antonie) (b. June 13, 1947, Pretoria, South Africa), home affairs minister of South Africa (1993-94).\n\nSchütz, Klaus (b. Sept. 17, 1926, Heidelberg, Germany - d.

April 13, 1993, Lübeck, Germany), acting minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein (1987-88); son of Werner Schwarz.\n\nSchwarz, Werner (b. Jan. 21, 1900, Hamburg, Germany - d. Sept. 2, 1982, Gut Frauenholz, near Bad Oldesloe, West Germany), West German politician. He was minister of food, agriculture, and forestry (1959-65).\n\nSchwarzenberg, Felix Fürst zu (b. Oct. 2, 1800, Krumau, Austria [now Ceský Krumlov, Czech Republic] - d. April 5, 1852, Vienna, Austria), prime minister and foreign minister of Austria (1848-52). He was also minister to Sardinia (1838-44) and the Two Sicilies (1844-48).\n\nK.

Fürst zu Schwarzenberg, Graf zu Sulz, gefürsteter Landgraf im Kleggau, Herzog zu Krumau (b. Dec. 10, 1937, Prague, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic] - d.

He was leader of Tradition Responsibility Prosperity 09 (2009-15) and a presidential candidate (2013).\n\nSchwarzenegger\n\nSchwarzenegger, Arnold (Alois) (b. July 30, 1947, Thal village, near Graz, Austria), governor of California (2003-11). A famous bodybuilder and Hollywood action hero known by film fans as \"The Terminator\" and \"Conan the Barbarian,\" he emigrated to the U.S. in 1968 and became a U.S. citizen in 1983, while retaining Austrian citizenship. In the 1990s he became active in the Republican Party. As chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (1990-93), he traveled to all 50 states to promote fitness programs. In 1991, he established the National Inner-City Games Foundation, an enrichment program for inner-city youths. In 2003 Schwarzenegger, who never held elected office before, swept California Gov. Gray Davis out of office in a historic recall election. He had announced his intention to run only two months before, on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. As Californians felt ignored by their leaders in Sacramento and cut off from their government amid a worsening state economy, Schwarzenegger tapped a deep vein of voter anger by vowing to defeat politics as usual, although he was short on specifics. Even reports of sexual harassment could not thwart his campaign (he apologized for having \"behaved badly\" towards women, and pledged to champion their cause). A self-described fiscal conservative, he called himself \"very liberal\" on social issues, supporting abortion rights, adoption by gay parents, and \"sensible gun controls.\" His support for the death penalty reduced his popularity in Austria, and after he refused to block the controversial execution of gang leader Stanley Williams in 2005 city councillors in Graz planned to vote on the removal of the governor's name from a soccer stadium in the city; forestalling this, Schwarzenegger himself requested the removal.\n\nSchwarzkopf\n\nSchwarzkopf, H. Norman1 (b. Aug. 22, 1934, Trenton, N.J. - d. Dec. 27, 2012, Tampa, Fla.), U.S. Army officer. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., receiving his lieutenant's commission in 1956. In 1964 he obtained a master's degree in guided-missile engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. He returned from two tours of duty in South Vietnam (1965-66, 1969-70) as a heavily decorated combat veteran, then held a series of two-year assignments, and in 1983, as major general, was deputy commander of the U.S. invasion of Grenada. He was a corps commander in 1986-87 and a deputy chief of staff at the Pentagon in 1987-88, then in 1988 he received his fourth star and was appointed commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command (responsible for any military operations in the Middle East), headquartered in Tampa, Fla. When Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait in August 1990, Schwarzkopf directed Operation Desert Shield, the buildup of a force of over 500,000 U.S., European, and Arab troops in Saudi Arabia. Under his command, Operation Desert Storm began on Jan. 16, 1991. A six-week-long air bombardment was followed by a ground campaign on February 24 which lasted only 100 hours. The Iraqi army was driven from Kuwait with only minimal casualties to the allied force. Hailed as a national hero, \"Stormin' Norman\" returned to the U.S. in April and retired from the military in August.\n\n1 His father, Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf, wanted to give him his name but disliking the name Herbert gave him only the letter H.\n\nSchweigaard, Christian Homann (b.
