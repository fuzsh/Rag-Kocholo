Mr. Abbott said the Communist 1

Party had infiltrated and influenced I

the Labour Party and through the

party Labour Governments, Comrn

monwealth and State. That trade

union leaders and their Parliament

ary representatives were afraid of

this infiltration was borne out by

their own statements.

For some months past Mr. J. P.

Ormonde, a member of the execu

tive of the Australian Labour Party

in New South Wales, had been

writing regularly each Thursday in

the "Sydney Morning Herald" on

subjects of impo'tance to the Lab

our movement. Mr. Ormonde had

devoted considerable space to trying

to induce the Labour movement to

rid itself of Communist influence,

but Labour, beyond protesting thati

it did not want Communists in its

unions, did nothing to get rid of

them. In the policy speech of the

N.S.W. Premier (Mr. McGirr),

Communists were n& mentioned,

said Mr. Abbott.

Mr. Ormonde had shown how the Ã½

Communist Party brought its in

fluence to bear through Labour

Party committees and oranches. He

practically stated that Communist

controlled unions were invited by the

A.L.P. -to become members of its

branches. In this way, Communists

helped to shape the policy of the,

Labour Party.

This was borne out by the history

of the Katoomba branch of the

A.L.P., within the Prime Minister's

own electorate. The branch was de

registered not because it contained a

large number of Communists but

because, in the words of the State

secretary of the A.L.P. (Mr.

Stewart) "the branch had caused

friction and was in an unsatisfactory

state."

"Underground Worker."

Mr. Abbott said the chief Com

munist operatives in the Katoomba

branch had been Dr. E. P. Dark,

Mrs. Eleanor Da k, the authoress,

Mr. Davidson, late minute secretary

of the A.L.P., Mr. Bruce Milliss and

Mrs. Milliss, Mt Andrew Levings,

Mr. Frank Murray, Mr. and Mrs.

Small, Mr. Pete: Carroll, Mr. and

Mrs. Apthorpe, Mr. Macredie, Mr.

Hal Pratt, Miss Beth Armstrong, Mr.

and Mrs. Toakley, Mrs. Kilner, Mrs

Butterfield, Mr. George Hamey and

Mr. J. Yearby. Dr. Dark was of the

same type as Dr. Alan Nunn-May

(the British scientist sentenced to

imprisonment for divulging atomic

secrets)--"an ardent but secret Com

munist.' Mrs. Dark was an under

ground worker for the Communists,

Mr. Abbott declared.

The Speaker (Mr. Rosevear)

called Mr. Abbott. to order for

speaking away from the terms of

his motion. Continuing, Mr. Abbott

said the Katoomba A.L.P. branch

had now been disbanded but up to

March 7 it had been Communist

controlled and this bore out what

Mr. Ormonde had said about the in-I

fluence of the Communists within

the Labour Party.

When some 4,000 State income

tax officers were brought into the'

Commonwealth Public Service lasti

met with considerable opposition

from responsible sections of the

transferred officers on the ground

that the Clerks' Union was a Com

munist-controlled organisation.

Influence in Departments.

Despite the majority against the

proposal, the Clerks' Union formed

the taxation branch and now was at

tempting to extend its influence into

other branches of the Public Service.

Union representatives had made

contact with the Postmaster-Gen

eral's Department, the Airlines

Commission, Telecommunications,

Repatriation, Labour and National

Service, Air, Commerce and other

departments. The Clerks' Union

was recognised as a Communist

dominated union, he said. Mr. J. R.

Hughes, secretary of the N.S.W.

branch, was a leading member of

the central committee of the Com

munist Party.

Mr. Abbott said there was also

the particular example of a member

of the Australian! Communist Party

being appointed to the CS.LR. He

referred to Arthur William Rudkin.

In June, 1940, he said, Rudkin was

sentenced to four months' imprison

ment with hard labour in Western

Australia as a Communist traitor.

He had been passing on to the gen

eral secretary of the Australian

Communist Party and to the Com

munist Party of Great Britain in

formation which might be useful to

the enemy. There was more recent

evidence that Rudkin had not

changed his views or his bitter

hatred of demo.ratic nations. De

spite this, Rudkin had been ap

pointed to a position in the forests

products division of the CS.LR.

A motion by the Deputy Leader

of the Country Party (Mr.

McEwen) for an extension of Mr.

Abbott's time was defeated by 37

votes to 20.

The Attorney-General (Dr.

Evatt) said Mr Abbott had failed

completely to give any serious

character to his motion. In trying

to say there was Communist in

fluence in the A.L.P, all Mr. Abbott

could point to was one Labour

league in NS.W. in which there

were people he did not even say

were Communists but near-Com

munists. If Mr. Abbott said outside

the House some of the things he had

said inside, there were a number of

persons on the list he had read out

who would seek appropriate redress.

Labour Policy Unchanged.

Labour policy towards Com

munists was stated in a resolution

carried in 1943 which remained un

-altered. This said the AL.P.

dissociated itself from the policy and

methods of the Communist Party.

and its auxiliaries and declared the

Communist Party an anti-Labour

organisation in -irect conflict with

the policy and platform of the

A.L.P. It was serious for Mr.

Abbott to bring up such a subject

and not support his allegations.

These allegations were untrue in re

gard to the A.L.P. and its executive

and the Government.

- Mr. Abbott had tried to suggest

that the Government was in some

way to blame for the activities of

the Clerks' Union, said Dr. Evatt.

That union had held a trek to Can

berra organised in a provocative

way to persuade the )Government to

interfere with the Public Service

Arbitrator. Its objective was to see

the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley),

who refused to see its delegates.

Afterwards the union attacked Mr.

Chifley in a pamphlet for 'having

remained loyal to the Public Ser

vice Association. Mr. Abbott was

suggesting that in some way Mr.

Chifley had encouraged Communism

when actually he had stood firm

against it. Mr. Dedman would deal

fully with the matter of Mr. Rud

kin's appointment, but he (Dr.

Evatt) would point out that there

were 90.000 employees in the Pub

lic Service and of these Mr. Abbott

could name only one as an alleged

Communist.

Drop in Membership.

In Australia the Communist

Party was not an unlawful organi

sation. Its membership was re

ported to have dropped to 20,000.

It was obvious there would be in

all walks of life, including the Pub

lic Service, people sympathetic to

the Communist Party and even

members of it.

Dr. Evatt said be did not know

what attitude and policy Mr. Abbott

would adopt towards the Com

munist Party, but at the last election

the Leader of the Country Party

(Mr. Fadden) said that if returned

to office he would consider depor

tation of Conmmnunists. That was a

very doubtful policy because of a

High Court decision in a deporta

tion case some years ago. Mr.

Fadden had also advocated banning

the Communist Party. He supposed

this meant declaring membership of

the party illegal and making every

one associated with it guilty of a

criminal offence.

During the war the Government

issued regulations under which it

dealt with the Communist Party in

the way Mr. Fadden suggested.

That action was taken under war

time powers and he did not think

it could be followed now. The

regulations under which the Com

munist Party was banned were sub

sequently held by the High Court

to be illegal. That was not in a

Scase concerning the Communist

Party but another body, but it was

the same set of regulations.

Mr. Abbott's proposals could not

be accepted by any democratic gov

enmment, Dr. Evatt continued. The

iLabour Party told the people at the

last election that if there were any

advocacy of violence. it would take

action against those responsible. but

he did not know of any case where

there had been advocacy of violence

by any members of the Communist

Party. He was not defending the

Communists but that was the posi

tion.

Attack on Mr. Chifley.

SOme weeks ago Mr. Abbott had

brought up some aspects of the

Communist Party relating to secur

ity. This action might produce

important results on the security

side, but what Mr. Abbott had

brought forward today was quite

(Continued on Page 0le.)

CO MMUIIST

CANCER.

(Continued from Page 9.)

another matter. As an illustration

of the attitude of the Communist

Party to the Labour Government,

Dr. Evatt said he would display a

Communist pamphlet issued as anti

Labour propaganda. This was a

poster which had a photograph of

Mr. Chifley and a caption in large

type: "Wanted for robbery of pay

envelopes." This was a shocking

and disgraceful thing.

The Leader of the Opposition

(Mr. Menzies): It's a good photo

graph.

Mr. Abbott: Don't you agree that

it is an absolutely rotten party.

Dr. Evart said there were two

extreme views. One was the view

of the Communists, which the Gov

ernment understood thoroughly and

towards which the Labour Party had

stated its policy. The Communist

Party caused and brought into ex

istence trends of an exactly oppo

site character-Fascist trends. One

had only to study some of the ad

vertisements in the Melbourne news

papers in relation to Communism to

see that unless great care were

taken there might arise in Australia

a movement of the "New Guard"

type which would advocate use of

violence and be a danger to Aus

tralia.

Mr. Cameron (Lib., S.A.): The

Communist Party advocates the use

of violence.

Dr. Evatt said the Labour Party

stood between these two extremes.

Its policy was to preserve demo

cratic and parliamentary institutions,

to respect democratic rights and to

ensure the security of Australia.

Where there was any case of ad

vocacy of. violence, the Government

would take appropriate action. Mr.

Abbott had not shown that any

Communist influence was exerted on

the Government. In fact there was

none.

Crippling Democracy.

Mr. Beale (Lib., N.S.W.) said

the Communist Party wanted to

make the Australian democratic

system unworkable by strikes and

then seize control of key industries.

It wanted to permeate Government

departments with key men and,

when it was strong enough, clamp

down a dictatorship, if necessary by

force. It was true the Communist

Party did not put up many candi

dates for election, but its members

voted for the Labour Pqrty and the

Labour Party exchanged votes with

it. It was humbug to say there was

no association between the Labour

Party and the Communist Party.

The Communist Party was growing

in Australia. In the telephone book

in Sydney there were six telephone

numbers for the A.L.P. and 16 for

the Communist Party.

The party had achieved its ob

jective of getting control of some

key industries and was getting into

Government instrumentalities.

The Minister for Post-war Recon

struction (Mr. Dedman) said Mr.

Abbott's case was so poor that it

scarcely needed a reply. The Labour

Party held that any reforms must

come by constitutional means and

it repudiated any attempt to get re

forms by revolutionary means.

W.A. Member's Outburst.

If there were association between

the Communist Party and any

other political party, it was rathler

with the anti-Labour parties, said

Mr. Dedman. At a certain election

in New South Wales, the then

U.A.P. and the Country Party ad

vised their supporters to vote No. 2

for the Communist Party. At re

cent elections in Western Australia,

about 400 Cofhmunist preferences

at Midland Junction were given to

the Liberal candidate.

Mr. Hamilton (C.P., W.A.): That

is,a deliberate lie.

The Speaker told Mr. Hamilton

that he had made a very disorderly

remark but Mr. Hamilton was not

called on to withdraw.

Mr. Dedman said the staff of

the C.S.I.R. numbered 2,600. but

Mr. Abbott could name only one

employee whom he said was a Com

munist.

Mr. Beale: Why have any at all?

Mr. Dedman said that technical

appointments to the CS.I.R. were

made on the recommendation of the

executive committee with the ap

proval of the Minister. It was im

possible for the Minister to examine

every recommendation that came

before him. Mr. Rudkin's appoint

ment was recommended by the

executive committee in January,

1945. Did any member of the

Opposition believe that any member

of the executive committee was in

any way associated with the Com

munist Party?

Mr. Rndkhu's Position.

Appointments to the staff of the

council were made on merit. If

the individual had qualifications,

undoubtedly he would receive

appointment. The committee was

not concerned with his political as

sociations.

Mr. McEwen: Irrespective of his

loyalty?

Mr. Dedman said it was alleged

against Mr. Rudkin that he was

convicted in Western Australia

about 1940 for an offence against

National Security Regulations. In

that year there was almost hysteria

about inadequate A.R.P. precau

tions. Many persons were convicted

who should not have been con

victed. In the circumstances, the

Government was entitled to take no

notice of the fact that Mr. Rudkin

had been convicted. The Govern

ment believed the interests of the

country could best be served by

appointing to the CS.I.R. in

dividuals best qualified.
