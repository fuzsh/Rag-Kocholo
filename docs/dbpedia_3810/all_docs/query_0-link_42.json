The screenplay was written by Moira Buffini, based on the newspaper comic strip of the same name (which was then re-published as a graphic novel) written by Posy Simmonds. The comic strip which serves as source material was a modern reworking of Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel Far from the Madding Crowd.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival in May and was released nationwide in France on 14 July 2010.[3][4] Momentum Pictures released the film in the United Kingdom on 10 September 2010.[5]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the fictitious Dorset village of Ewedown, Tamara Drewe, a young and beautiful journalist, returns home after living in London, with the intention of selling her deceased mother's house, in which she grew up. Locals are amazed at the improvement in her appearance after she had rhinoplasty while away. Andy had been interested in her when she was a girl, and when he sees her now it is clear that he is still attracted to her. However, she begins an affair with rock-band-drummer Ben whom she meets at a music festival held in the village.\n\nAcross the valley is a neighbour's home where authors retreat to work. The owner, Nicholas, is a prolific crime novelist and a serial philanderer, while his wife Beth provides food, lodging, and encouragement for her patrons. After being discovered by Beth having an affair which he then ends, Nicholas embarks on an affair with Tamara, after she and Ben have split up. Andy has been asked by Tamara to work on the house so she can sell it, and he becomes aware of the affair with Nicholas, as do two local teenaged schoolgirls, Jody and Casey, who cause some havoc due to their jealousy of Tamara's relationship with Ben.\n\nJody is infatuated with Ben and distraught that she won't see him in the village again, because he left Ewedown after he and Tamara split up, so she manipulates him into returning. Eventually her deceit is discovered. Nicholas and Tamara's affair is revealed and in a strange turn of events, Nicholas is accidentally killed by stampeding cows. Beth's friend Glen, a Thomas Hardy scholar who had become infatuated with her over the months he spent there, reveals his love for her despite feeling guilty about Nicholas's demise, which happened after a confrontation between the two. She easily persuades him to remain at the retreat with her. By this time the true love of Andy and Tamara brings them together, and Tamara decides to stay in Ewedown after all.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nGemma Arterton as Tamara Drewe\n\nRoger Allam as Nicholas Hardiment\n\nBill Camp as Glen McCreavy\n\nDominic Cooper as Ben Sergeant\n\nLuke Evans as Andy Cobb\n\nTamsin Greig as Beth Hardiment\n\nJessica Barden as Jody Long\n\nCharlotte Christie as Casey Shaw\n\nJohn Bett as Diggory\n\nJosie Taylor as Zoe\n\nZahra Ahmadi as Nadia Patel\n\nBronagh Gallagher as Eustacia\n\nPippa Haywood as Tess\n\nSusan Wooldridge as Penny Upminster\n\nAlex Kelly as Jody's mother\n\nLola Frears as Poppy Hardiment\n\nJoel Fry as Steve Culley\n\nCheryl Campbell as Lucetta\n\nPremiere\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK premiere was held on 6 September 2010 at the Odeon Leicester Square.

The website's critics consensus reads: \"A robust comedic cast and Stephen Frears' gift for satire elevate Tamara Drewe's slight scenario into a tart treat.\"[6] Metacritic gave it a score of 64 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating 'generally favourable reviews'.[7]\n\nEmpire gave four stars out of five stating the film was \"Very intelligently funny, with stellar performances.\"[8] Lisa Mullen wrote in Sight & Sound in October 2010:\n\nTurning graphic novels into films can be a tricky business...an impressively limpid, compressed and visually textured piece... here the romantic themes—concerning sensible spouse choice... are undercut by a bawdy appreciation of chaos, mischief and mayhem... Beth Hardiment played with great subtlety and a kind of concentrated stillness by Tamsin Greig...[9]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award/Festival Category Nominee Result 2010 63rd Cannes Film Festival[10] Palm Dog Award\n\nBoss\n\nWon 7th Seville European Film Festival[11] Audience Award Won 13th British Independent Film Awards[12] Best Supporting Actress Nominated 2011 38th Evening Standard British Film Awards Peter Sellers Award for Comedy Won 31st London Film Critics Circle Awards[13] Young British Performer of the Year Nominated 8th Irish Film & Television Awards[11] Best Costume Design Nominated\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
