The catch: new identities in an arranged marriage as Mr. & Mrs. John and Jane Smith. Now hitched, John and Jane navigate a high risk mission every week while also facing a new relationship milestone. Their complex cover story becomes even more complicated when they catch real feelings for each other. What’s riskier, espionage or marriage?

So I compare the soap opera drama and infidelity to that of Ewan MacGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead while shooting the TV series \"Fargo\". These 2 actors probably took a page from Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's template during this project.

I'm watching E1 right now.\n\nUpdate: Stick with it.\n\nI'm hoping you're right. We watched half of episode one and stopped. I went to IMDb to perhaps get encouragement LOL and I looked at reviews and saw that generally, those who disliked it, expected it to be like the film and those who liked it didn't expect that. I thought about how when we first watched \"Atlanta,\" we turned it off because we didn't get it. And with Glover and his bro involved and Glover's fav director directing the first two episodes, maybe we didn't get this either. We finished the episode looking at it less as an action show and more like a quirky relationship thing and liked it much more.\n\nLast edited by TheHans on Feb 3rd, 2024 5:55 pm, edited 2 times in total.\n\nIf I had more time, I would have written a shorter post\n\nMrMom\n\nDeal Guru\n\n12128 posts\n\n15806 upvotes\n\n@TheHans i was dying during the first 3/4 of E1.

I get where you're coming from completely. I did like the first few minutes though and the last 15. And the cat.\n\nIs Glover more buff than he was on \"Atlanta\"? I think so and evidently judging from the episode he wants people to notice LOL.\n\nEDIT: We watched the whole thing. I felt it was very uneven. We really enjoyed episodes 2-5. A lot. But episodes 6 and 7 didn't work well for me, particularly the one-level interactions between Glover and Erskine, despite some great work from Sarah Paulson and Michaela Cole in those episodes. The finale was strong, but I thought a bit too drawn out. Hard to say more without spoilers, but I'm interested to hear what others thought.\n\nIf I had more time, I would have written a shorter post\n\nMrMom\n\nDeal Guru\n\n12128 posts\n\n15806 upvotes\n\nJust finished.

I'm pretty sure I was multitasking for the last few.\n\nThe show definitely seemed to tinker with viewer expectations.\n\nI was very much expecting Sarah Paulson to be a target/mission, who they also decided to milk for input before killing her.\n\nI'm curious - is there a plan for s2?\n\nMaybe the concept they have in mind is to keep mixing around?\n\nSo s2 would be somewhere different, with new people.\n\nPerhaps a later encounter with anyone who survived the finale?\n\nOtherwise, is it ByBy?\n\n\"When someone is burning a book, they are showing utter contempt for all of the thinking that produced its ideas, all of the labor that went into its words and sentences, and all of the trouble that befell the author . . .” ― Lemony Snicket\n\nTheHans\n\nDeal Fanatic\n\n5095 posts\n\n4817 upvotes\n\nB.C.\n\nMrMom wrote: ↑ Just finished.

What a disappointment.\n\nSo true that it had lots of disappointment and I suppose I was generous, but that scene you mentioned with the neighbour in the last episode was great! When Paul Dano first appeared in episode 2, I wondered what he was actually doing there because he didn't have much to do in the show at all. But that sequence with Glover in the last episode explained it IMO. Who gets bullied more convincingly than Paul Dano? It was no \"I drink your milkshake,\" but Glover's no Daniel Day-Lewis either. It was a highlight of the finale for sure.\n\nIf I had more time, I would have written a shorter post\n\ntrini\n\nDeal Fanatic\n\n6335 posts\n\n424 upvotes\n\nToronto\n\nOnly got to episode 4 so far and it is very enjoyable.
