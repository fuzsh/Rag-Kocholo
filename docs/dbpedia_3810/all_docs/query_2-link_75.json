        "text": "Today is the release of Vertical Entertainment’s If Not Now, When? A film about four friends that were bonded together after an event back in High School. Years later, they are forced back together when one of them suffers a crisis. It’s a story of love, forgiveness, and the incredible bond between women.\n\nThe film stars Meagan Holder, Mekia Cox, Tamara Bass, Lexi Underwood, and Meagan Good. It is directed by Bass and Good. Based on a screenplay by Bass. If Not Now, When? gives us the story of four black women that are going through very unique problems. Although high school friends, their current lack of communication has them unsure if they can trust one another. Through the power of forgiveness and friendship, they are about rally around one another and begin to overcome their situations.\n\nALSO SEE: MEKIA COX TALKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDSHIP IN IF NOT NOW, WHEN? [EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW]\n\nIf Not Now, When? allows women of color to be showcased in a way that is relatable to many women in our society. Although their issues one can say are some that do not see color. They are problems that unfortunately some of us have to overcome no matter our ethnicity. In the film, we get the chance to see Black actresses play lead roles side by side without having to be held back by the stereotype molds that other films have made for them in the past. For example, having to feature them competing with one another. Or the mentor-mentee, where an older woman needs to save the almost damsel in distress from her predicament.\n\nAhead of its release, LRM Online was privileged to talk with the writer, director, and actress in the film, Tamara Bass. In our conversation, we talk about the process of putting together this great film. As well as the opportunity to be able to tell the story in the way she wanted to. Also, we talk about her character, Patrice, who is going through many personal challenges in the film. You can check out the interview down below!"
