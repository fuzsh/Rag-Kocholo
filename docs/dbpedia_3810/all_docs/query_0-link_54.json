Tamara! Tamara!\n\n- No.\n\n- Tamara?\n\nAre you okay?\n\nThe theme of duality.\n\nThe idea that we can do good\n\nor evil has been here forever.\n\nFrom Cain and Abel all the way\n\nthrough to modern pop culture...\n\nbut many believe there is a devil\n\ntempting us to do bad things.\n\nOthers believe the potential lies\n\nsolely within each one of us.\n\n''Journey Into Witchcraft''.\n\nI think you've already made\n\nthat journey.\n\nI've got to say, it looks like\n\nyou've had a really rough trip.\n\nEnough!\n\nAnother detention and I'll have\n\nto teach you again next year.\n\nGrab a copy of ''The Gazette''\n\non your way out.\n\nAnd don't forget,\n\nquiz on Monday.\n\nTamara?\n\nI've got some great news\n\nfor our star pupil.\n\nWe're asked to submit editorials,\n\nthe paper picked the best one.\n\nAgain, you've impressed me with\n\nyour intelligence and passion.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nKisha, there's the b*tch\n\nwho wrote the article.\n\nSomebody call Animal Control.\n\nOne of those drug-sniffing dogs\n\nis off its leash.\n\nBack off!\n\nMind your own business.\n\nI'm making this my business.\n\nWhat? You've got something\n\nyou want to say?\n\nCome on, ladies.\n\nWe don't have time\n\nfor these losers.\n\nYou okay?\n\nDon't worry about them. They've\n\nbeen a**holes forever. Seriously.\n\nThey think they're hot now.\n\nBut, in ten years...\n\nthey're gonna be fat,\n\nbitter, divorced alcoholics.\n\nTamara!\n\nDon't move!\n\nTamara!\n\nTamara, what's wrong?\n\nTamara, get back here.\n\nShe went into Natolly's room.\n\n- Let me have a word with them.\n\n- No, please!\n\nTamara, about this drug testing.\n\nIt's not your fault.\n\nAdministration's been\n\nplanning it for months.\n\nLook, if anyone bothers you,\n\nI want you to come to me, okay?\n\nI'm sorry about the paper.\n\nI just wanted to encourage you.\n\nIt's made so many people mad.\n\nNobody liked me before...\n\nThat's not true. I like you.\n\nI'm sure a lot\n\nof other people do too.\n\nHigh school can be tough.\n\nJust be strong.\n\n''This too shall pass.''\n\nAre you using famous literary\n\nquotes to make me feel better?\n\nI'm an English teacher.\n\nFamous quotes are my arsenal.\n\n- Is it working?\n\n- Yes, I guess.\n\nYou've got a lot going for you,\n\nMiss Riley. Let people see it.\n\nYou're very special.\n\nYou just have to find your place\n\nin the world.\n\n- Tamara, it's fine. It's fine.\n\n- I'm so stupid.\n\nNo, Tamara. It's...\n\nWhat? Now you don't have\n\nanything to say?\n\nYou didn't have trouble shooting\n\nyour mouth off for the paper.\n\n''It's no secret that some\n\nof our star athletes...\n\nare using performance\n\nenhancing drugs.\n\nBut due to the team's success,\n\nthe coach has remained silent.''\n\n- Busted!\n\n- Shut up, dick!\n\nThanks to you, the coach tried\n\nto get me to piss in a cup.\n\nYou're going down.\n\nI'll see you soon,\n\nyou trailer trash whore.\n\nMaybe you could take it and\n\nwe could switch samples.\n\nIt's too late.\n\nWhat happened with Coach?\n\nHe benched me...\n\nfor the rest of the season,\n\ncause I didn't take the test.\n\nDo you know the scouts will come\n\nnext month and I won't play?\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n- That freak's ruined everything!\n\n- It's okay, baby. It's okay.\n\n- You're home early.\n\n- I don't want to talk about it.\n\n- Stuart's closet needs cleaning.\n\n- I'll do it later.\n\nI'm going to my room for a while.\n\nI've had a really bad day.\n\nWell, my day's been\n\none big f***ing tea party!\n\nYou guys are not going\n\nto believe what I saw.\n\nTamara made a move\n\non Mr. Natolly.\n\nShe tried to kiss him.\n\nAnd he totally shot her down.\n\nYou've got to be kidding me.\n\nHe was all like:\n\n''Someday, you'll\n\nfind your place in the world.''\n\nYou know?. I think it's time\n\nwe teach that loser a lesson.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nNothing.\n\n- Honey, what's wrong?\n\n- Tamara's got a crush on me.\n\nShe'll be fine. I think she's\n\nmore embarrassed than anything.\n\nWhen are these geris gonna learn\n\nthey're no match for a woman?\n\nI think I might have some news\n\nthat will cheer you up.\n\nWe may have\n\nto start redecorating.\n\n- What do you mean?\n\n- I don't know.\n\nI was thinking maybe some pink,\n\nor maybe some blue.\n\nAre you serious?\n\nI think we may have\n\nactually done it this time.\n\nGod, that's great!\n\nThere he is.\n\nRoger! What's up?\n\nListen, there's gonna be\n\na party tomorrow night.\n\nA party?\n\n- Do you think you can make it?\n\n- Do I think I can make it?\n\nYes, but only if you stop\n\nrepeating everything I say.\n\nLook, pardon my scepticism...\n\nbut we hardly hang out\n\nin the same social circles.\n\nIt's senior year, man!\n\nTime to put aside this petty\n\nhigh school bullshit...\n\nand have fun.\n\nPlease tell me you just said fun.\n\n- Who are you?\n\n- Jesse. What's up?\n\nI just moved three months ago\n\nfrom LA.\n\nThe fresh air is great.\n\nBut the social scene sucks.\n\nNo clubs, no raves.\n\nBut they're having\n\na barn dance next month, so...\n\nThere won't be\n\nany farm animals...\n\nbut I'm having a kick-ass party\n\ntomorrow night if you wanna come.\n\nTotally. Chloe too?\n\n- I don't think that I can.\n\n- What? Come on.\n\nI guess.\n\nAwesome.\n\nRoger here was just bailing.\n\n- No, I can attend.\n\n- Great!\n\n- I'll call you with the address.\n\n- All right.\n\nHaving fun!\n\nHaving fun without you?\n\nOne more thing.\n\nYou still work at the AV centre?\n\nWhat's wrong with you, girl?\n\nYou've been up here\n\nall afternoon.\n\nYou think this magic sh*t's\n\ngonna make you feel better?\n\nOf all the habits to pick up from\n\nthat no good mother of yours.\n\nCouldn't learn to cook.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI tried to make\n\nthings work with her.\n\nSometimes love isn't enough.\n\nNo.\n\nLove isn't enough.\n\nI'll make you love me.\n\nTo the ancients\n\nwho were before time...\n\nhear my prayers.\n\nI supplicate myself before you.\n\nNow ready\n\nto make the sacrifice you desire.\n\nTo the old ones, endowed with\n\npowers of love and attraction...\n\nbind my fate\n\nto that of the one I desire.\n\nBill?\n\nAnd like this flame,\n\nlike a phoenix from the ashes...\n\nlet me rise anew to claim\n\nall that should be mine.\n\nHoney?\n\nWith a touch, grant me the power\n\nto sway others to do my bidding.\n\nAnd destroy those\n\nwho stand in my path.\n\nFor this, I offer up my heart...\n\nmy soul...\n\nmy blood.\n\nI spill it in your name.\n\nYes, some witch.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nHello?\n\nTamara?\n\nWhat? I can't hear you.\n\nlt's my cell. Reception's bad.\n\nIt's Bill.\n\nl had to call you.\n\nl've thought about what you said.\n\nAnd l want you to know\n\nthat I care for you too.\n\nThis isn't Mr. Natolly.\n\nl told you that someday you'd\n\nfind your place in the world.\n\nl'd like that place\n\nto be with me.\n\n- But what about Mrs. Natolly?\n\n- We're having problems.\n\nl don't want to talk about it\n\nover the phone.\n\nCan you meet me tonight?\n\nYes!\n\nCome to the Capri Motel.\n\nRoom 39. 17h30, okay?\n\nTamara, l've been dreaming\n\nabout this for a long time.\n\nl'd love to spend\n\nthe night with you.\n\nI'd like that too.\n\nGreat. l'll see you then.\n\nI love you.\n\nI love you.\n\nIt worked.\n\nYou are just so cruel.\n\nWhat is taking him so long?"
