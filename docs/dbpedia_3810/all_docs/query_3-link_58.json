        "text": "There's nothing more frustrating than trying to pick something new to watch when you're not sure what the mood calls for. Sure, you could go through every episode of The OC again but what about something... new?\n\nLet us guide you with this very thorough list of the best of TV of 2024 (so far).\n\nSh≈çgun\n\nWatch: Disney+\n\nA sprawling, big-budget adaptation of James Clavell's historical novel, set in 17th century Japan. This one fills that prestige political power-vacuum-intrigue void we've been feeling since the peak of Game of Thrones. With season 2 announced, now's the perfect time to lock in.\n\nRipley\n\nWatch: Netflix\n\nNetflix's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley, starring Andrew Scott in the titular role, is an absolute feast for the eyes.\n\nSure, the gorgeous cast and Italian coasts help, but it's the jaw-dropping black and white cinematography that takes this version to another level.\n\nFallout\n\nWatch: Prime Video\n\nBethesda's flagship post-apocalyptic roleplaying series gets the small screen treatment, and not only does it not suck-it's actually pretty great.\n\nThe series works even if you haven't played a single game, but it also fits perfectly for fans. This is a post-HBO The Last of Us world, and we're better for it.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Smith\n\nWatch: Prime Video\n\nA reimagining of the 2005 film of the same name, this version by Donald Glover and his Atlanta alumni offers a subversive take on the spy genre. It playfully flips the premise of the source material on its head, with Maya Erskine and Glover's chemistry being the real star of the show.\n\nConner O'Malley Stand Up Solutions\n\nWatch: YouTube\n\nOver the past decade one of alt comedy's rising stars, Conner O'Malley, has amassed a cult following thanks to his truly bizarre brand of feverish, dread-laden humour. In his first special, O'Malley's performance is less traditional stand-up show and more of a demented pitch to angel investors that will make you feel really, really bad about our relationship with the internet.\n\nRen Faire\n\nWatch: Binge\n\nLance Oppenheim's extraordinary three-part documentary follows the curmudgeonly, self-professed 'king' of America's largest renaissance festival as he announces his retirement. The power struggle that ensues pits larger-than-life characters against each other, all vying for the crown. It's a medieval Succession.\n\nX-Men '97 Season 1\n\nWatch: Disney+\n\nThe surprisingly excellent X-Men '97 serves both as a brilliant continuation of the beloved 90s animated series and as the perfect jumping-on point for newcomers. The returning voice cast and costumes are appreciated but '97 never confuses nostalgia with storytelling, making it the best non-comic book adaptation of Marvel's mutants.\n\nThe Bear Season 3\n\nWatch: Disney+\n\nCarmy and the crew's latest chapter is as stressful to watch as it is riveting. Like in season 2, we pump the brakes amidst the chaos to focus on the quieter moments of the show's ensemble cast. The Bear's third course is a perfect blend of incredible acting, terrific writing, and stunning presentation, making it the fine dining experience of television.\n\nThe Boyfriend\n\nWatch: Netflix\n\nJapan's first same-sex romance reality series feels both historically significant and the epitome of comfort viewing. Taking a leaf out of the immaculate Terrace House production book, the quiet and considered show follows nine young men in search of love and friendship as they spend a summer living and working together."
