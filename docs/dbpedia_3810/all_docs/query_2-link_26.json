        "meta_description": "Mother and daughter, both from the GDR: one experienced it, the other did not. Tamara was born in 1990. Like many of the post-reunification generation, she left her homeland and only comes to visit for her milestone birthday. But everything that seemed secure crumbles within a few days: Tamara (Linda PÃ¶ppel) and her mother Barbara (Lina Wendel) are left. The two struggle to maintain their relationship, which cannot be detached from the social developments in which the family was born, grew and disintegrated. Now Tamara must face what she has been running away from: her own history.",

        "text": "Has one of the most boring opening scenes I've ever seen and later one on of the best car sequences I've ever seen with a brilliant built-up and staging which communicates so much through pictures and sound. You could clearly see that most actors are originally stage actors so emotional scenes just hit perfectly and as did the accents, commentary on modern East Germany and the way human relationships are the most beautiful and soul-crushing thing. After watching it, I really didn't know how to feel but it's honestly a good film, it's one that most people probably wouldn't enjoy but I saw so much of myself in it, it's impossible for me not to like it."
