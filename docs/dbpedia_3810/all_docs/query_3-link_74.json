        "text": "A Bridgerton casting call announcement has fans guessing over a big character’s upcoming arc!\n\nA casting breakdown was reportedly sent out for a character named “Emily,” but some are wondering if this is just a secret code name for a well known character from the book.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…\n\nFans believe this could be the love interest for Benedict, played by Luke Thompson. The casting call, according to Collider, is looking for an East Asian female between the ages of 24-30 years old. The role says it will involved nudity, which is a big hint that “Emily” could be a romantic lead this season.\n\nThe casting call also calls the character “plucky, endlessly resourceful, and having trouble trusting others.” In the books, Benedict ends up marrying a woman named Sophie, so fans are wondering if “Emily” could be a code name.\n\nIn addition, it’s been noted by Hello that the casting call states production dates will run from mid-September to April 2025, so filming will be underway next month!\n\nNetflix confirmed last month that Benedict’s story will lead season four, so it seems likely that we’ll be getting a casting announcement some point soon!"
