        "text": "Some movies still got released on VHS until around 2010 in Korea while the most of the rest of the world had dvd-only releases. This is one of those titles that you wonâ€™t find easily on VHS elsewhere.\n\nTitle: Tamara (2005, aka Soul Hunter)\n\nCountry of movie: Canada\n\nCountry of VHS release: South Korea\n\nAudio: English\n\nSubtitles: Korean\n\nFormat: NTSC\n\nEx-rental: yes\n\nCondition cassette: decent with some casual, mild sign of use.\n\nPlayback quality: mild imperfections in the very beginning (movie starts pretty much immediately, no trailers or logos), but clears fast enough.\n\nCondition case: neat with some casual, mild sign of use.\n\nCondition inlay: moist exposure did cause some waving and staining on the white backside of the paper, the printed side looks quite decent with unfaded colors."
