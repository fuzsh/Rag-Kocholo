        "text": "Viktor Bout has become a wildly more popular figure in recent days than he already was for all the crimes he committed. This is the ame man that the Russian Government allegedly wants in exchange for WNBA star, Brittney Griner. If this trade takes place between both countries, the United States will get the American athlete back but they are giving up a man that took them decades to catch.\n\nHis exploits and crimes are so incredible, that even Nicolas Cage decided to play him in the 2005 'Lord of War' film. If the events of that movie are any true, this man truly is the personification of evil in the modern era. He supplied weapons to some of the most authoritarian regimes of the last 3 years and even supplied planes to the United States.\n\nNicolas Cage's portrayal of Viktor Bout.\n\nThe producers of the movie couldn't use Viktor Bout's name for obvious reasons but they did use another Russian name for the character. His name is Yuri Orlov and the movie depicst some of the biggest arm deals ever made by this charismatic global war technocrat.\n\nDespite the main character's fame as 'The Merchant of Death', Nicolas Cage decided to ground him and portray the more human aspects of Bout's life. The most infamous quote reveals a man who was dead set on building an empire by selling as many guns as possible. Here's what Yuri Orlov says at the beginning of the movie:\n\nThere are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every 12 people on the planet. The only question is: how do we arm the other 11?\n\nYuri Orlov in 2005's 'Lord of War'\n\nThis is the man Russia wants back in the country for what ever reason, perhaps he has state secrets that could endanger the country's national security. Bout is, after all, the biggest gun dealer to ever walk the face ofthe earth. By the time Brittney Griner comes back to America through that deal, she will feel guilt for the rest of her life for allowing such a notorious criminal to roam free in the world.\n\nShe will think twice before she decides to accidentally bring vape cartridges toa new country. If you get a chance to watch that movie, you will get a better idea of who Viktor Bout truly is. Literally millions of lives are atributed to all the guns he sold throughout the decades."
