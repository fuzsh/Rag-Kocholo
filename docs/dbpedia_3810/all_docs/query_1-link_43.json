I'll be gentle, I promise.\n\nI love you, Tamara.\n\n¶ Unforgettable ¶\n\nMr. Natolly?\n\nStop!\n\nStop!\n\nOh, my God!\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nI could never love you.\n\nHelp me.\n\nTell me you love me. Make them stop!\n\nTamara. Tamara!\n\nTamara! Tamara! No.\n\nTamara! Tamara! No.\n\n- No. - Tamara?\n\nYou okay?\n\nThe theme of duality.\n\nThe idea that each of us is capable of great acts of good or evil has been with us forever.\n\nFrom Cain and Abel in the Bible all the way through to modern pop culture.\n\nBut many people believe there is a devil or an evil force out there\n\ntempting us to do bad things.\n\nOthers believe the potential lies solely within each one of us.\n\nJourney into witchcraft.\n\nI think you've already made that journey.\n\nI've got to say, it looks like you've had a really rough trip.\n\nEnough!\n\nOne more detention and I'll have the displeasure of teaching you again next year.\n\nGrab a copy of the gazette on your way out!\n\nAnd don't forget, quiz on Monday.\n\nTamara?\n\nI've got some great news for my star pupil.\n\nWe're asked to submit editorials from the class paper and pick the best one.\n\nOnce again, you've impressed me with your intelligence and passion.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nHey, Kisha, there's the bitch that wrote the article.\n\nSomebody call animal control.\n\nOne of those drug-sniffing dogs is off its leash again.\n\nBack off.\n\nMind your own business.\n\nI'm making this my business.\n\nWhat? You got something you want to say?\n\nCome on, ladies.\n\nWe don't have time for these losers.\n\nYou okay?\n\nDon't worry about them.\n\nThey've been assholes forever.\n\nSeriously. They think they're hot shit right now.\n\nBut in ten years, they're gonna be fat, bitter, divorced alcoholics.\n\nCome on.\n\nYo, Tamara!\n\nDon't move!\n\nTamara!\n\nTamara, what's wrong?\n\nTamara! Tamara, get back here! She went in Natolly's room!\n\nHey! Oh!\n\nLet me have a word with them. No, please!\n\nTamara, about this drug testing. It's not your fault.\n\nThe administration's been planning it for months.\n\nLook, if anyone bothers you, I want you to come to me, okay?\n\nI'm sorry about the paper. I, um...\n\nI just wanted to encourage you.\n\nIt's made so many people mad.\n\nNobody liked me before, and now... Hey, hey, hey!\n\nNow that's not true. I like you.\n\nI'm sure a lot of other people do too.\n\nHigh school can be tough. Just be strong.\n\nThis too shall pass.\n\nAre you using famous literary quotes to make me feel better?\n\nI'm an English teacher. Famous quotes are my arsenal.\n\nIs it working?\n\nYeah, I guess. Okay.\n\nYou know, you've got a lot going for you, miss Riley.\n\nIf you just let people see it.\n\nYou're a very special girl.\n\nYou just have to find your place in the world.\n\nOh, God.\n\nTamara, it's fine. It's fine. I'm so stupid.\n\nTamara! Tamara! It's...\n\nwhat?\n\nNow you don't have anything to say?\n\nYou didn't seem to have any trouble shooting your mouth off for the paper.\n\n\"It's no secret that some of our star athletes\n\n\"are using performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nBut due to the team's success, the coach has remained silent.\"\n\nBusted! Shut up, dick!\n\nThanks to you, coach tried to get me to piss into a cup.\n\nYou're going down.\n\nI'll see you soon, you trailer trash whore.\n\nHey, maybe you could take it and we could switch samples.\n\nIt's too late.\n\nHey. What happened with coach?\n\nHe benched me for the rest of the season\n\n'cause I wouldn't take the stupid test.\n\nDo you realize the scouts are coming next month\n\nand I'm not gonna be playing?\n\nI'm sorry. That freak has ruined everything!\n\nIt's okay. Baby, it's okay.\n\nYou're home early. I don't wanna talk about it, dad.\n\nThe steward's closet needs cleaning. I'll do it later.\n\nI'm going to my room for a while. I've had a really bad day.\n\nYeah, well, my day's been one big fucking tea party!\n\nYou guys are not gonna believe what I saw.\n\nTamara meeting with one Mr. Natolly.\n\nShe tried to kiss him, and he totally shot her down.\n\nYou've got to be kidding me.\n\nHe was all like, \"someday, you'll find your place in the world.\"\n\nYou know,\n\nI think it's time we teach that loser a lesson.\n\nHey.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nNothing.\n\nHoney, what's wrong?\n\nTamara's got a little crush on me.\n\nShe'll be fine. I think she's more embarrassed than anything.\n\nWhen are these schoolgirls gonna learn that they're no match for a real woman?\n\nI think I might have some news that will cheer you up.\n\nYeah? Mm-hmm.\n\nWe may have to start redecorating.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nOh, I don't know.\n\nI was thinking maybe some pink, or maybe some blue.\n\nAre you serious? Mm-hmm.\n\nYeah. I think we may have actually done it this time.\n\nOh, God, that's great!\n\nThat's great.\n\nYo, there he is.\n\nYo, Roger! What's up?\n\nListen, there's gonna be a party tomorrow night.\n\nA party? Think you can make it?\n\nDo I think I can make it?\n\nYeah, but only if you promise to stop repeating everything I say.\n\nLook, pardon my skepticism, but...\n\nWe hardly hang out in the same social circles, all right?\n\nIt's senior year, man!\n\nTime to put aside all this petty high school bullshit and have some fun.\n\nPlease tell me you just said \"fun.\" Who are you?\n\nJesse. What's up?\n\nI just moved here three months ago from LA. The fresh air is great.\n\nBut the social scene sucks.\n\nNo clubs, no raves.\n\nBut I do hear they're having\n\na barn dance next month, so...\n\nwell, there won't be any farm animals,\n\nbut I'm having a pretty kick-ass party tomorrow night if you want to come.\n\nTotally. Chloe too?\n\nI don't think that I can. What?\n\nCome on. Okay, I guess.\n\nAwesome. Roger here was just bailing.\n\nNo, no, I can attend.\n\nGreat!\n\nI'll call you with the address. All right.\n\nIt's gonna be fun. You remember what fun is, don't you?\n\nHey, hey, hey, one more thing.\n\nYou still work at the a.V. Center, right?\n\nWhat's wrong with you, girl?\n\nYou've been up here all afternoon.\n\nYou think this magic shit's gonna make you feel better?\n\nOf all the habits to pick up from that no-good mother of yours.\n\nCouldn't learn to cook.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI tried to make things work with her.\n\nSometimes love ain't enough.\n\nNo.\n\nLove isn't enough.\n\nI'll make you love me.\n\nTo the ancients who were before time,\n\nhear my prayers.\n\nI supplicate myself before you,\n\nnow ready to make the sacrifice you desire.\n\nTo the old ones, endowed with the powers\n\nof love and attraction,\n\nbind my fate to that of the one I desire.\n\nBill?\n\nAnd like this flame, like a Phoenix from the ashes,\n\nlet me rise anew to claim all that should be mine.\n\nHoney?\n\nWith a touch,\n\ngrant me the power to sway others to do my bidding.\n\nAnd destroy those who stand in my path.\n\nFor this,\n\nI offer up my heart,\n\nmy soul,\n\nmy blood.\n\nI spill it your name.\n\nYeah. Some witch.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nHello?\n\nTamara?\n\nWhat? I can't hear you.\n\nIt's my cell. Reception's bad.\n\nIt's bill. I had to call you.\n\nI've been thinking about what you said. And I want you to know that I care for you too.\n\nThis isn't Mr. Natolly.\n\nI told you yesterday that someday you'd find your place in the world.\n\nI'd like that place to be with me.\n\nBut what about Mrs. Natolly?\n\nWe're having problems.\n\nI don't want to talk about it over the phone. Can you meet me tonight?\n\nUm, yes.\n\nGreat. Come to the Capri motel. Room 39.\n\n9:30 okay? Okay.\n\nTamara, I've been dreaming about this for a long time.\n\nI'd love to spend the night with you.\n\nI'd like that too. Great. I'll see you then.\n\nI love you.\n\nI love you.\n\nIt worked.\n\nYou are just so cruel.\n\nWhat the hell's taking him so long?\n\nYou'd think with all the freshmen he's done here, he'd have his own check-in line.\n\nI got both the rooms. Phase one is complete.\n\nWhy are we getting two rooms?\n\nYou ever heard of exotic dancers, rog?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, of course.\n\nJust help me unload this video gear.\n\nHello?\n\n¶¶\n\nWe early?\n\nNo. It's gonna be a small party.\n\nMy folks are going out of town soon.\n\nThat's when we're having the big blowout at my house.\n\nPatrickpalooza 5, baby.\n\nWhat's up, man? How you doing? How you doing?\n\nAll right, it's shot time!\n\nLet's make it happen.\n\nIt's okay. I got us some wine.\n\nSo, you tapped that yet, buddy, or what?\n\nSo, about the locker room. I'm sorry.\n\nI'm glad you could come.\n\nNo problem.\n\nYou guys really should give Tamara a break.\n\nShe's a really cool girl.\n\nYeah.\n\nAll right, cheers.\n\nNow that is one quality libation.\n\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\nHey, Sean. Phase two?\n\nYeah. I'm just gonna go to the car and get some more beer.\n\nDo it.\n\nBill?\n\n¶¶\n\nHey, is that the dancer? It sure is.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nJust a little late-night entertainment.\n\nYou guys know how to party, man!\n\nTell me you love me, Tamara.\n\nI love you.\n\nWelcome to reality TV, bitch!\n\nYou didn't say it was her.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nI can't believe you actually thought he would sleep with you.\n\nYou look like a cheap ugly whore!\n\nOh, why, why, why?\n\nYou tell me where she is right now!\n\nOh. Whoo!\n\nThat fucking dress.\n\nYou fucking loser.\n\nTamara!\n\nYou?\n\nIt's not what you think.\n\nI trusted you!\n\nNo, wait!\n\nTamara!\n\nTamara!\n\nTamara. Tamara.\n\nGod! Somebody shut her up!\n\nStop! Stop!\n\nDon't hurt her!\n\nDon't hurt her!\n\nTamara! Please. Tamara!\n\nBitch!\n\nTamara?\n\nIs she all right?\n\nI can't feel a pulse.\n\nMove! Move!\n\nShe's dead, isn't she?\n\nIsn't she?\n\nNo. No.\n\nNo. No!\n\nWait. Let's think about this.\n\nWhat's there to think about? She's dead!\n\nI know.\n\nBut there's nothing we can do for her.\n\nWe can figure this out.\n\n- Just calm down. - Calm down?\n\nWe killed her. Shut up!\n\nNo one killed her. It was an accident.\n\nI am not throwing my life away because of this loser.\n\nIf we all keep our mouths shut,\n\neveryone will think she ran away.\n\nNo one has to know.\n\nAre you out of your fucking mind? Listen, you little shits!\n\nYou all struggled with her.\n\nCall the cops,\n\nand I'll tell them that you and your boyfriend set this whole thing up.\n\nThat you were fighting with her when she fell.\n\nIt'll be your word against mine.\n\nI've already got a fucking record.\n\nI'm not going to jail.\n\nNo way.\n\nRoger?\n\nI didn't know.\n\nGod! You're not like them.\n\nThis is so wrong!\n\nBut I have a scholarship.\n\nThey're just...\n\nI can't believe I'm hearing this.\n\nChloe?\n\nShe scratched me.\n\nYou too.\n\nThey're gonna find our skin under her nails.\n\nYour hair's in her hand.\n\nIt's five against one.\n\nAnd I got videotape to back up my story.\n\nWho do you think they're gonna believe?\n\nAll right.\n\nSo, what's your fucking plan?\n\nWe never talk about this.\n\nEver!\n\nLet's finish it and get out of here.\n\nWait.\n\nThis is really wrong, burying her out here like this.\n\nWe can still call the police. It's not too late. We've already decided.\n\nNow let's just finish it and get out of here!\n\nLeave him alone!\n\nI'm afraid it's too late.\n\nI'm done. Can I go to the bathroom?\n\nHey, watch it!\n\nYou look a little pale. Is something wrong?\n\nSorry I'm late.\n\nRough weekend. I almost died getting here.\n\nWell, you'll have to take a makeup test. Okay.\n\nOkay! Time's up, people.\n\nHand everything in.\n\nIs something wrong, Jesse?\n\nThank you.\n\nCan I talk to you for a sec?\n\nUm, sure.\n\nAbout Friday. I was just feeling a little vulnerable.\n\nIt's okay. Are you all right now?\n\nAs you can see, Mr. Natolly,\n\nI'm better than all right.\n\nI'm perfect.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nIt's Tamara. She's alive.\n\nShe just walked into class.\n\nBut... How?\n\nShe must have been unconscious.\n\nNo. No, she was dead. Chloe and me checked.\n\nObviously, we were wrong.\n\n- Did you guys talk to her? - Hell, no, I didn't talk to her!\n\nI was too busy shitting my pants.\n\nWe'll go to her and say, \"look. We didn't mean for you to get hurt.\"\n\nI'll make sure she keeps her mouth shut.\n\nWe tried it your way and buried her alive.\n\nI'll talk to her.\n\nWhat about how she looks now?\n\nCome on. She'd give Halle Berry a run for the money in the hottie department.\n\nTamara?\n\nShe was into all that magic shit.\n\nWhat if she really is a witch?\n\nAnd what if you really are a fucking moron?\n\nWe messed up. That's all. She wasn't dead.\n\nAll right, guys. We gotta get to class.\n\nLike I said, I'll talk to her.\n\nGotta get on the scoreboard in this period.\n\nAnd the pass is good, intended for...\n\nTamara? Tamara? Somebody shut her up!\n\nStop! Stop!\n\nDon't hurt her! Tamara, please!\n\nTamara! Stop!\n\nBitch!\n\nTamara?\n\nIs she all right?\n\n- I can't feel a pulse. - Move! Move!\n\nShe's dead, isn't she?\n\nI don't know. Am I, Roger?\n\nTamara? In the flesh.\n\nBut... How?\n\nDo you really care how? Aren't you just glad to see me?\n\nOh, God, yes. Look, I'm sorry for what happened.\n\nI... You didn't mean for me to get hurt.\n\nNo, I swear. Things just got out of hand.\n\nYes.\n\nBut you're okay. And that's all that matters.\n\nDo you really think I'm okay?\n\nYou buried me, Roger. I'm sorry.\n\nWe thought that you... do you have any idea what that was like?\n\nNo. I...\n\nwell, let me show you.\n\nBut I have a scholarship. But I have a scholarship.\n\nImagine waking up in the cold, wet ground.\n\nScared, alone.\n\nYou don't know where you are,\n\nhow you got there.\n\nYou claw at the ground until your hands are bloody and raw.\n\nYou try to scream, but dirt fills your mouth.\n\nAnd you feel the bugs and worms eating at your flesh.\n\nGod!\n\nOh, God.\n\nMake it stop!\n\nNow do you understand what I went through?\n\nAll because you were too scared to stand up.\n\nOh, God.\n\nI'm sorry. I didn't know.\n\nI guess everyone's right. You are a loser.\n\nAnd what would they think if they knew the whole truth?\n\nThat you're such a sad little boy that you...\n\nyou thought you could bleed the pain away.\n\nNo. But it's still there eating at you.\n\nYou know what your problem is, Roger?\n\nYou never finish what you start.\n\nGood afternoon, hafton high.\n\nI know a lot of you may view me as just some loser video geek.\n\nWell, this weekend I did something horrible.\n\nAnd it made me realize...\n\nYou're right.\n\nI am a loser.\n\nBut even though I can't change the past, I can still make things right.\n\nI can accept my punishment.\n\nBut first I want to offer you all a little advice.\n\nNever be afraid to stand up for what's right.\n\nDon't just sit back and allow yourself to...\n\nHear no evil.\n\nRoger!\n\nRoger!\n\nSpeak no evil.\n\nRoger!\n\nRoger!\n\nSee... No evil.\n\nI can't believe he killed himself.\n\nIf he would have known Tamara was alive, maybe he wouldn't have.\n\nI should have told him right away. It's not your fault.\n\nYeah, he took the easy way out.\n\nWould you listen to yourselves?\n\nYou all are so busy trying to clear your conscience, you just don't get it.\n\nThis is our fault. All of it.\n\nOh, don't be so hard on yourselves. Accidents happen.\n\nActually, I want to thank you.\n\nBecause of you, I'm not that same scared, insecure girl I used to be.\n\nNow I know what I want.\n\nTamara, we need to talk about what happened.\n\nChloe and I didn't know what they were planning. They said it was a party.\n\nIt was Patrick's idea. Dick! It was yours.\n\nIt doesn't matter. It happened.\n\nAnd what we did after was just inexcusable.\n\nI don't want excuses.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nYou'll see.\n\nYou guys, what did she mean by that?\n\nWhat was that shit about it being my idea? Shut up.\n\nMaybe she just wants to forget all this. You seriously believe that?\n\nWhy not? You and I were always nice to her.\n\nYeah. Until we buried her in the woods.\n\nHow do we even know it was really her?\n\nI mean, look at her. What if that magic...\n\ndon't even start with that shit again. You know, enough!\n\nSomething happened in those woods. I'm gonna find out what.\n\nHere it is.\n\nWhat if she's still here?\n\nShe dug herself out.\n\nWhy didn't she suffocate?\n\nNo!\n\nNo! What is it?\n\nShe's here!\n\nChloe, it's empty. I saw her.\n\nCome on. It's all right. Look. See?\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIt's a spell. But there's so much blood, I can't make it out.\n\nSee? I told you. She's a fucking witch.\n\nDude, keep it up and I'm gonna bury you.\n\nMaybe he's right.\n\nTamara, what are you doing here?\n\nThe door was unlocked. I needed to talk to someone.\n\nWell, Alison's at school.\n\nI can wait.\n\nI don't think that's a good idea.\n\nPlease, Mr. Natolly.\n\nI've been through so much lately.\n\nAnd now with Roger.\n\nWell, okay. She should be home soon.\n\nYou know, I've been thinking about what happened between us.\n\nWell, nothing happened. But I'm sorry if I misled you. Did you?\n\nI didn't... Look at me, Mr. Natolly.\n\nIt was a misunderstanding. Look at me.\n\nIt's getting wet.\n\nWhat?\n\nThe table.\n\nAre you gonna drink that?\n\nSo, do you like my new look?\n\nI liked you the way you were.\n\nThis is me, Mr. Natolly.\n\nNot that pathetic weakling you felt sorry for.\n\nI've never felt sorry for you.\n\nAnd you shouldn't change to please people.\n\nI've changed because I wanna be pleased.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on pleasing me, teach?\n\nTamara, stop. Do you want me to?\n\nYou should leave. Should I?\n\nI love my wife.\n\nWell, aren't you loyal?\n\nBut it's only a matter of time, bill.\n\nI know you want me.\n\nI can see how much.\n\nHi, Tamara. Come on in.\n\nI'm sorry I missed you last night.\n\nOh, don't worry. Mr. Natolly made me feel much better.\n\nI know. Um, but... Let's talk about you.\n\nYou want to analyze me?\n\nI want to know how you're doing.\n\nRoger's death came as a tremendous shock.\n\nThe whole thing's got me thinking about what's really important.\n\nYou know, like finding true love,\n\nhaving a family.\n\nYou're so young. You've got your whole life ahead of you.\n\nI'm afraid I'm gonna end up in my thirties\n\nand find myself in a marriage that's not as happy as it used to be,\n\nworrying that it's my fault because I can't give my husband what he wants.\n\nAnd even though I like to think I'm strong,\n\nthere's a small part of me that knows\n\nthere are so many hot, young girls\n\nwho want him.\n\nIs everything all right?\n\nUm...\n\nI am so sorry.\n\nI... I think I have another appointment.\n\nCan we finish this later? I'd love that.\n\nOh! And in case you didn't get the moral of my story,\n\nlet me spell it out for you.\n\nYou'll never give bill children.\n\nHey!\n\nSo, it looks like things got pretty personal\n\nduring your private little chats with Tamara.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nShe knows we've had trouble conceiving and I sure as hell didn't tell her.\n\nWell, I certainly didn't.\n\nThen how does she know, bill?\n\n¶¶\n\nHow you doing, girls? Party of the year tomorrow night at my house, okay?\n\nDid you get a load of those two?\n\nA couple of my drink specials, I'm gonna be hot dogging them all night.\n\nGod, you're such an ass.\n\nHey, as long as I'm getting ass.\n\nWhat are you, a rabbit?\n\nWhy don't you eat something, girl? And get ready to party.\n\nThanks. But suddenly I'm not feeling very festive.\n\nYou're letting that freak get to you?\n\nI'm not letting that bitch ruin my senior year. You with me, bro?\n\nYeah, fuck Tamara.\n\nAll right. We'll be there.\n\nTamara! My classroom, now!\n\nSit down!\n\nSo forceful, Mr. Natolly.\n\nHow'd you know about mine and Alison's personal problems?\n\nYou two are having problems? Don't play games with me.\n\nHow did you know? What's come over you? You have.\n\nStop it! What did you say to Alison?\n\nForget about Alison. She could never give you the things I can!\n\nI have everything I want.\n\nJust leave me alone, okay?\n\nNot yet.\n\nHey.\n\nSomething is going on with tamera and Mr. Natolly.\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm not pregnant.\n\nYou look beautiful.\n\nCome on and give me a hug.\n\nYou like touching me, don't you?\n\nI just want some affection.\n\nYou're my girl.\n\nWe're all we've got.\n\nI can still smell her perfume. I can still smell her perfume.\n\nIf you loved mom as much as you loved that bottle,\n\nthen maybe she wouldn't have left.\n\nAnd you wouldn't be chasing your own daughter, you bastard!\n\nYou do love that bottle, don't you?\n\nThen finish it, daddy.\n\nThe whole thing.\n\nThere's more in the fridge.\n\n¶¶\n\nHey.\n\n¶¶\n\nHey.\n\nI should really wait.\n\nI'm already really buzzed.\n\nYeah, these are so strong.\n\nThey're my special mix.\n\nDon't worry, girls.\n\nI'm gonna take good care of you.\n\nYou know what I'm talking about!\n\nOh, it burns.\n\nThis is a private party.

It's five against one.\n\nYou want me, don't you?\n\nYeah.\n\nMore than all those other girls you took to that cheap hotel room,\n\ndrugged, and fucked?\n\nYou know what would really turn me on?\n\nI want you to know what it's like\n\nto feel helpless,\n\nto be taken advantage of.\n\nSo, who's gonna pitch and who's gonna catch?\n\nEenie, meenie, minie, moe.\n\nWell, Patrick, it looks like you're the bottom.\n\nSo, go ahead, Sean.\n\nGive me a show.\n\nHe went towards the bedrooms with Tamara and Patrick.\n\nWhat?\n\nHe followed her. He was acting all... Weird.\n\nLike Patrick.\n\nKisha, wait! No!\n\nKisha?\n\nSean?\n\nSean, stop it! Stop!\n\nLeave him alone.\n\nYou are so beautiful.\n\nI used to envy you.\n\nYour perfect body.\n\nFlawless skin.\n\nBut deep down when you look at yourself, what do you see?\n\nA girl so vain,\n\nso desperate to keep her man, she'll do anything.\n\nDoes loverboy know what you did to make yourself beautiful for him?\n\nDoes he?\n\nActually, you're skin and bones, Kisha.\n\nYou really should eat more.\n\nWhat happened in there? Are you okay? We heard you scream.\n\nI'm starving.\n\n¶¶\n\nWhat happened up there?\n\nCome on, let's go. Come on.\n\nI'm calling Mr. Natolly.\n\nWhy'd you want to meet him here?\n\nYou're not gonna tell him, are you? Chloe!\n\nI'm done lying. We could go to jail.\n\nAnd the alternative is better?\n\nI'm sorry, Sean can't come to the phone right now. He's fucking Patrick.\n\nWe're meeting Mr. Natolly. We're gonna tell him everything.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nWhere are you meeting him? Kisha?\n\nYou stupid... we're not trying to hurt anyone, okay?\n\nCome here, I have a plan.\n\nOh, fuck!\n\nGet dressed. There's been a change of plans.\n\nShe chewed them.\n\nWe need to get her to a hospital.\n\nThe bleeding stopped.\n\nWe need to find Tamara before she comes for us.\n\nChloe! This whole witchcraft thing is just not possible.\n\nThere's no other explanation.\n\nTamara died. And now look at her.\n\nPatrick and Sean. And now Kisha.\n\nRoger killed himself. She's doing something to them.\n\nOkay. Let's go take a look.\n\nSo, what do we do? Knock on the door and say, \"uh, Mr. Riley?\n\nWe think your daughter's some kind of zombie witch. Can we come in?\"\n\n\"Great! Let's have tea.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nMr. Riley?\n\nMr. Riley, it's bill Natolly. Tamara's English teacher.\n\nMr. Riley?\n\nHello?\n\nHello?\n\nMr. Riley?\n\nHello?\n\nOh, my God.\n\nIt's mine.\n\nHang on.\n\nHere it is.\n\nOh, shit.\n\nIt's a love spell.\n\nIt gives you the power to control people by touch.\n\nIt says that the blood of the person casting the spell\n\nmust be spilled for it to work.\n\nWe did it. We spilled her blood.\n\nHer fate is bound to the one she loves.\n\n\"Like a Phoenix from the ashes,\n\nlet me rise anew to claim all that should be mine.\"\n\nThe spell brought her back.\n\nIt binds her fate to the one she loves.\n\nShe thought she was meeting you at that motel.\n\nYou're the one she wants.\n\nShe's bound her fate to you.\n\nWell, she knows I love...\n\noh, my God.\n\nAlison.\n\nOh, fuck! The line's dead.\n\nBill?\n\nWe did some renovations.\n\nWhat the fuck do you guys want?\n\nSorry, Mrs. Natolly. But Tamara wants you dead.\n\nOh, God.\n\nMrs. Natolly?\n\nYour husband called us.\n\nI'll get a doctor.\n\nWhat happened? We don't know.\n\nTake her to examine room 3.\n\nCross and type her, 2 units of paxils. I'll be there in a minute.\n\nLet's roll.\n\nHi. My wife's here. Alison Natolly.\n\nShe's upstairs. Room 509.\n\nThank you.\n\nFamily only.\n\nYou'll have to wait here or in the cafeteria.\n\nWhere is she?\n\nI'm sorry, sir. But you can't go in there. I'm her husband.\n\nI need to see some I.D. All right.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAlison.\n\nOh, baby. Oh.\n\nThey said that Tamara wanted me dead.\n\nI killed them both.\n\nOh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\n\nThey had this... this look in their eyes.\n\nIt was a cold, soulless look.\n\n- What's happening, bill? - What's happening?\n\nShe's sedated. She'll be out all night.\n\nMagic? I know it sounds crazy...\n\nCan I help you, miss?\n\nWhat is it? Tamara's here. Come on.\n\nWhat are you doing? We're finding Mr. Natolly.\n\nKisha?\n\nCome on. Let's go!\n\nJesse, Tamara's controlling her! I know.\n\nSo we don't want to kill her.\n\nI don't think that she feels the same way about us.\n\nHere. Use this instead.\n\nAll right, go hide. I'll get her.\n\nHey, Kisha! Come on.\n\nThat's right. Come on.\n\nCome on.\n\nKisha!\n\nJesse?\n\nOh, God. I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay.\n\nOh, God.\n\nJesse?\n\nI'm gonna go get you help, okay? Stay with me, please.\n\nNo, Jesse! You need a doctor!\n\nChloe. Chloe, listen. You... you...\n\nyou gotta stop her, okay?\n\nNo. Mm-hmm.\n\nNo, Jesse. Jesse, we're gonna stop her, okay? We are.\n\nYou're... you're... you're a good girl, Chloe.\n\nJesse!\n\nI wish I told you sooner.\n\nJesse, no!\n\nNo. No!\n\nDamn it!\n\nI won't let her hurt you. I promise.\n\nStay back!\n\nYou'll never have him! He loves me!\n\nShut up, you barren bitch!\n\nDo you know the sacrifice I made to be with you? I died for you!\n\nI'd die for him too.\n\nYou can be sure of that.\n\nSay good-bye.\n\nIt's over.\n\nTamara really did die in that hotel.\n\nYou're a monster.\n\nNice try.\n\nDidn't you learn the last time? You can't kill me.\n\nSweet Chloe.\n\nI'm making this my business.\n\nYou guys really should give Tamara a break.\n\nThis is really wrong, burying her out here like this.\n\nNo.\n\nTamara! Tamara, stop!\n\nThis isn't you. It's the magic.\n\nTry and remember who you were. You can end this.\n\nDon't let it control you.\n\nOh, God.\n\nWhat have I done?\n\nI've turned into them.\n\nWith a touch I could have made you mine.\n\nBut I didn't want you like that.\n\nLike some mindless slave.\n\nWe can stop this.\n\nThere's nothing left.\n\nNo. It can't end like this! I won't let it!\n\nTamara, stop! Tamara's dead!\n\nNo! No, no. You came back for me.\n\nUnless we're together, this will never end.\n\nOur fates are bound together for as long as you live.\n\nWell, then we'll be together.\n\nForever.\n\nNo!\n\nTheir fates were bound together.\n\nHe was the only one that could stop her.\n\nYou're going to need stitches. But you're a very lucky girl.\n\nIt wasn't luck that saved us.\n\nPush everybody back. Get everybody out."
