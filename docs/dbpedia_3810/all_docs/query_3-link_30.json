        "text": "Whether you’re a film buff or an occasional fan, almost everyone loves watching a good movie. But sometimes, especially-long movie titles can make you raise an eyebrow–especially if the films they’re paired with are quite short!\n\nSo, just how long can the most wordy movie names get? Today we’ll be looking at 10 of the longest movie titles that are around today and ranking them by how many words long they are. We’ll also learn a little bit about the masterminds and ideas behind each one!\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n\nSource: wikimedia.org\n\nThis movie was based on the famous book by C.S. Lewis, which had already been made into several other film adaptations before. This new and improved version began a series of movies based on Lewis’ books, and was followed by Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The film earned a worldwide opening of $107.1 million, which was Disney’s largest opening in the world at the time!\n\nDid you know?\n\nGeorgie Henley, who played Lucy, was kept from seeing parts of the set until filming to keep her reactions to Narnia as genuine as possible.\n\nBorat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\n\nSource: wikimedia.org\n\nThis daring mockumentary film had a surprisingly small cast list: Only Luenell, Borat, Azamat, and Pamela Anderson were played by real actors. The rest of the movie characters were completely unscripted and were meant to offer a candid look at the kinds of reactions that Sasha Baron Cohen (Borat) could prod out of everyday people. The “Kazakh” phrases spoken in the movie are actually made up of a hodgepodge of other languages, including Hebrew.\n\nDid you know?\n\nWhoever put together the end credits for this movie was sure to include mention of a “Naked Fight Coordinator”.\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nSource: wikimedia.org\n\nThis film is usually referred to simply as “Dr. Strangelove” and is known for its black humor and unapologetic jabs at political affairs. The plot centers around an unhinged general who sets nuclear war in motion, along with the consequent efforts of other generals and politicians to stop the bombers. The film was so memorable and effective that it led to actual, real-life policy changes to ensure that its fictitious events could never happen!\n\nDid you know?\n\nWhile shooting some of the aerial scenes for the film, footage of a secret US military base was accidentally filmed.\n\nI Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meat Hook, and Now I Have a Three-Picture Deal at Disney\n\nSource: wikimedia.org\n\nThis short movie is remembered not only for its eye-catching name, but for being the first film Ben Affleck directed as well. The plot is an unusual blend of interpersonal conflicts, ego, and murder, and the film is generally unpopular. In fact, Ben Affleck himself disowned the film years later, stating that it looked as if it was made by someone else with no promise as a director. The film is often referenced alongside his later and better work for contrast.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThis movie was filmed while Ben Affleck was still studying at Occidental College.\n\nRéfutation de tous les jugements, tant élogieux qu’hostiles, qui ont été jusqu’ici portés sur le film “La Société du spectacle”\n\nSource: potemkine.fr\n\nTwo years prior to this film, French director Guy Debord put out the film La Société du spectacle. Criticism can be hard for any artist to take, but Debord took his resentment to the next level by creating an entire movie speaking out against the criticism that his 1973 film received! All in all, while the name of this movie is quite lengthy, the film itself was only 22 minutes long.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe title of this movie translates to “Refutation of all the judgments, both glowing and hostile, which have been made so far on the film ‘The Society of the spectacle’” in English.\n\nOthon, or: Eyes Do Not Want to Close at All Times, or, Perhaps One Day Rome Will Allow Herself to Choose in Her Turn\n\nSource: mubi.com\n\nThis movie is an interpretation of The Business Affairs of Mr. Julius Caesar by Bertolt Brecht and a steadfast film adaptation of Pierre Corneille’s original, tragic play Othon. The plot of the movie explores the ways through which humanity’s cultural mainstream develops and expands, and is set in ruins in modern-day Rome. The setting is further developed by an array of scheming characters all hoping to grasp power in the wake of Emperor Nero’s death.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThis movie was the first one that directors Huillet and Straub shot in color.\n\nPersecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade\n\nSource: wikimedia.org\n\nFrequently referred to simply as Marat/Sade, this movie was a film adaptation of the Broadway musical by the same name that premiered in 1964. Many of the original Broadway players also played their parts in the film, lending a nice level of authenticity to the movie. The acting is said to be incredibly effective, and the “play within a play” structure adds even more intrigue to the final piece.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThis film was given a special mention at the Locarno International Film Festival.\n\nOn the Marriage Broker Joke as Cited by Sigmund Freud in Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious, or Can the Avant-Garde Artist Be Wholed?\n\nSource: iffr.com\n\nThis unusual movie explores the duality and contradictions between Freudian psychoanalysis and Christian ideas. The film often turns these viewpoints, represented by panda bears, against one another with each one making satirical statements about the other. Verbal and visual puns, artistic and sexual imagery, and witty metaphors all come together to pick apart the way people communicate with one another and learn.\n\nDid you know?\n\nDirector Owen Land said that he wanted to use his film to convey “the arbitrariness of all information.”\n\nNight of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2\n\nSource: wikimedia.org\n\nThis film, meant to be a spoof of classic horror film Night of the Living Dead from 1968, featured dialog and clips as outrageous as its title! When the movie was released, it only reached around 500 stores in the United States, but has gained quite a cult following over the years. The film’s title has been called a “gimmicky joke” and the piece was screened at the New York City Horror Film Festival in 2005.\n\nDid you know?\n\nJames Riffel actually directed this movie under the alias Lowell Mason.\n\nNight of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil Mutant Hellbound Flesh Eating Crawling Alien Zombified Subhumanoid Living Dead, Part 5\n\nSource: picclick.com\n\nNight of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil Mutant Hellbound Flesh Eating Crawling Alien Zombified Subhumanoid Living Dead, Part 5 is the longest movie name by word count. This comedy-horror film was rather short compared to its long name, at only 50 minutes in length. The movie parodies what many people have called the “Golden Age of Television” and uses clips from “Bonanza” and “The Andy Griffith Show”. The old TV clips were then re-dubbed with new dialogue and sound for comedic effect.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThis movie was the first one that James Riffel wrote for charity."
