        "text": "We rented this movie this week. As soon as it started I recognized the plot. Hollywood isn't ashamed to recycle plots, believe me. It was a made-for-TV movie in 1973, co-written by Joan Rivers. TGMLT was brilliant and starred Stockard Channing as a friendly college girl who wants to be liked by the handsome frat boys and pretty sororiety sisters. She's a bit overweight and sort of average looking. It's almost a mirror plot. Homely girl ridiculed by the in crowd, and later on, she gets her revenge on everyone. Even TGMLT had Stockard getting revenge one by one, just like Tamara. Don't get me wrong, Tarama was modernized, sleek, and they even threw in black magic to spice things up. The plot was fast-paced and had good-looking young actors and actresses in it. But if you all want to see the original, ripped-off plot, get \"The Girl Most Likely To.\" You can buy it on DVD. Go look at the postings for TGMLT and you will see where to buy it and other viewer comments. I guess they thought nobody would remember something 34 years old but I did.\n\nTamara is pretty much a Carrie rip-off, even the poster art is almost identical. Whether it was intended to be original or not, I'm not sure, but with a few less clich√©s and a bit more character development, this could have been a film like May, smart and scary, and eccentric. Perhaps this film is a 'takes one to know one' kind of story. socially troubled girls, may find this emotional but everyone else will see Tamara as what it is, a sexy, but shallow horror movie.\n\nTamara Riley becomes the most hated girl in school after she writes a news paper article which rats out a number of her school mates in a certain way. One night, a bunch of them play a nasty prank on her, but things go wrong and she is accidentally killed. In the panic, they bury her body in the woods, but somehow she comes back from the dead, more cunning and sexy than before, and with a mind for revenge.\n\nThe trick to enjoying the movie is whether or not you feel engaged enough to root for the protagonist. She was done a major injustice but she is also doing injustice to others. The sex appeal of Tamara is really secondary. Tamara is nothing more or less than amusing in a twisted way, but if you want a similar movie that actually gets you thinking, watch May."
