        "text": "The Cheating Curve\n\nCarrie officially gets back with Big, Charlotte is swept away by the Power Lesbian elite, Miranda finds herself competing with a boyfriend's porno films, and Samantha gets a 'lightning bolt' from her personal trainer.\n\nCriminal Pathology\n\nThe SVU is called to a familiar crime scene - the beach where serial killer Gregory Yates (guest star Dallas Roberts) buried his many victims. When another body washes ashore, Detective Rollins (Kelli Giddish) tries to coax him into confessing, but the surprising information he provides sends shockwaves through the police department. As the case goes to court, Barba (RaÃºl Esparza) faces off against two hotshot defense attorneys in a trial that leads to blackmail, an incriminating confession, a new victim and a fugitive suspect. Part Two of Two.\n\nNoncompliance\n\nThe question of patients' rights surfaces when a mentally ill man electing not to take his medication is a suspect in the stabbing death of psychiatric doctoral student. With Mariska Hargitay, Christopher Meloni and Richard Belzer.\n\nPixies\n\nWhen a young gymnast is found dead, her world-renowned coach (guest star Philip Casnoff) becomes a prime suspect as his rigorous demands of his students are discovered. Detectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) soon find that the girls also vie for the attention of a wealthy benefactor (guest star Armand Schultz) whose interest in the young athletes does not appear to be purely philanthropic.\n\nRepression\n\nWhen 18-year-old Meghan Ramsey (guest star Kelly Hutchinson) is aided by her therapist (guest star Shirley Knight) in recalling childhood molestation by her father (guest star Brian Kerwin), she reports the incest to Detectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) in hopes of sparing her younger sisters the same fate. Though initially her mother (guest star Amy Irving) does not believe her, eventually the entire family turns on the accused man despite his protests and the discovery of tainted evidence. But when his punishment is exacted outside of the legal system, everyone in the fragile family becomes a suspect."
