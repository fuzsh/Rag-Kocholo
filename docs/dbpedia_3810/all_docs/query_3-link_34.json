        "text": "Wikipedia says\n\n\"the film's title is a reference to Mahmud of Ghazni, the tenth-century Sultan of Ghaznavid Empire whose name is pronounced \"Ghajini\" in Tamil.\"\n\nIt goes on to refer the book \"Sutras, Stories and Yoga Philosophy: Narrative and Transfiguration\" by Daniel Raveh.\n\nThe third result says\n\n\"Murugadoss offers a more down to earth explanation for the title. According to him, the title of his Tamil movie was inspired by the story of Mahmud of Ghazni, the tenth-century Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire, who invaded and plundered parts of the Indian subcontinent. Ghazni is famous for his persistence, despite several failures. The Tamil pronunciation of Ghazni is Ghajini.\"\n\nSuch a word never existed in Hindi or in any other Indian language. The name Ghajini is the name of the villain of the film.title of the film is inspired by the story of Mahmud of Ghazni, an ancient invader of India. This person was so persistent in invading India that he continued trying after several failures. In the film too, the protagonist is such persistent in finding out and killing the villain of the film, who had killed his girlfriend, Kalpana (played by Asin). Aamir Khan's Character, is a short-term amnesiac, who cannot remember anything more than fifteen minutes.
