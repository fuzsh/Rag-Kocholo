(Sundance, 2006). She produced the debut feature film of Mo Perkins, A Quiet Little Marriage, winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Slamdance 2009.\n\nAs an editor, she cut director Christopher Monger’s environmental film A Sense of Wonder (2008), based on Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring. She also cut Grace Lee’s debut hit independent feature film American Zombie (2007), which played at SXSW, Slamdance, and was released theatrically in 2008.\n\nAs a director, Ms. Maloney has several short films that have played on PBS and in festivals around the world. In 2007, the Talent Campus at Berlinale, International Film Festival, commissioned her to direct the short film Resigned. Her films received awards from The Caucus Foundation for Television Producers, Writers, and Directors; the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Hollywood Radio and Television Society, and the Edie and Lew Wasserman Award.\n\nHer upcoming producing projects include narrative feature film The Chump Brothers, with writer/director Hal Haberman, and documentary feature Da Bull, about legendary surfer Greg Noll, which she is to direct."
