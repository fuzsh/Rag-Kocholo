        "text": "Having started her career in front of the camera, Tamara began her transition to working both angles, with her short film \"Exposure\" that ran the festival circuit. The film garnered a lot of attention when it made its debut at The Pan African Film Festival. It went on to screen at The Reel World Film Festival, after being solicited by their programming director. \"Exposure\" was also nominated for a Kodak Award at the Martha's Vineyard African-American Film Festival and premiered in New York at the Reel Sisters of the Diaspora Film Festival. Tamara also wrote, produced and directed her second short film, \"Broken\" starring April Lee Hernandez and Dorian Missick. She followed that effort, when she created, starred and directed, alongside Meagan Good, the successful web series “All That Matters”, that launched on WorldStar Hip Hop. On the feature side, Tamara's debut co-directorial effort \"If Not Now, When?\", was acquired by Vertical Entertainment. In addition to co-directing, Tamara also wrote, produce and starred in the film. Tamara followed that up with two movies for TV One, \"Don't Waste Your Pretty\" and \"Coins Forever\", a film for BET+ , \"Hello\", as well as the upcoming \"Ruined\" and an episode of season 3 of \"Tales.\" Tamara is currently pitching more original content and taking meetings.\n\nwww.tamarabass.com"
