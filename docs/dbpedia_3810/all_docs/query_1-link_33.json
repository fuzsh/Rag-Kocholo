        "text": "LONDON\n\nEARLY in “Tamara Drewe,” the title character walks with insolent lusciousness down the road to meet her neighbors, gathered at a writers’ retreat in rural Dorset. Wearing an innocent expression and a near-pornographic ensemble consisting of a red tank top and a pair of cut-off shorts so brief they leave uncovered a healthy portion of her rear end, she sends a frisson of excitement  or irritation, depending  through the group.\n\nThat is just her opening gambit. Tamara, portrayed by Gemma Arterton, has a way of discomfiting and disrupting the lives of others, including Nicholas (Roger Allam), an egomaniacal, serially adulterous author of best-selling thrillers; Beth (Tamsin Greig), his hyper-efficient, put-upon wife; Andy (Luke Evans), their hunky gardener; and Ben (Dominic Cooper, looking chronically undershowered), a sexy, snarling, not-too-smart rock star. By the end of the film there will have been illicit liaisons. There will have been missed connections, forged messages, serious misunderstandings. One character will have died, in an undignified but poetically just way. Morality will have prevailed. And if any of this seems vaguely familiar, it is because “Tamara Drewe,” which began its life as a graphic novel, is loosely modeled on Thomas Hardy’s classic tale of bucolic melodrama, “Far From the Madding Crowd.” (Tamara is, roughly, Bathsheba; Ben corresponds to Sergeant Troy, using drumsticks, not swordplay, for seduction.)\n\nThe movie makes only glancing references to the original source  one of the writers at the retreat, Glen (the American actor Bill Camp), is working on a book about Hardy  and they are there for fun more than anything.\n\n“I borrowed the six principal characters and some twists of plot,” said Posy Simmonds, the author of the graphic novel, which originally appeared in installments in The Guardian in 2005. “It’s the same setup, with a beautiful woman and three guys. If people know the book, it’s a little bit extra. And if they don’t, it doesn’t matter.”\n\nThe film, directed by Stephen Frears in his usual hard-to-pin-down style, is lighter than Ms. Simmonds’s book, and might best be described as a comedy with a bit of darkness laced through. Its sharp script takes on, among other things, the egotism of established writers and the desperation of unpublished ones; the sometimes alluring vapidity of celebrities; and the hidden menacing nature of cows.\n\nBut its success rises and falls on the appeal of Ms. Arterton, late of the James Bond film “Quantum of Solace” and the “St. Trinian’s” movies. In those she played straight-up sexy as a (temporarily) buttoned-up spy with hidden depths and a precocious schoolgirl who appears to be auditioning for the cover of Jailbait Magazine. More recently, she portrayed a kidnap victim who is more than a match for her captors in “The Disappearance of Alice Creed.”\n\nTamara is a London journalist who writes a column and dabbles in celebrity interviews. Beset by self-doubt despite (or perhaps because of ) a recent nose job that has turned her from interestingly gawky to drop-dead gorgeous, she derives her self-love from the love of men but fails to appreciate the extent of her new power. She must be irresistible enough for plot plausibility, yet not so thoughtless  and not so sure of herself  that she loses the audience’s sympathies.\n\nFamously inarticulate about his methods (“You do it on instinct, really,” he said), Mr. Frears was wearing shorts and a seen-better-days shirt with a pair of sandals, his hair a vision of chaos. An assistant hovered at his elbow, trying to get him to focus on his schedule for the next few months.\n\nMr. Frears met Ms. Arterton on the advice of his casting director and hired her right then, without having seen any of her movies. She looks a lot like Ms. Simmonds’s drawings of Tamara, which helped.\n\n“The minute she sat down, I said, ‘If she’s any good, cast her,’ ” Mr. Frears recalled.\n\nMs. Arterton related, “I went along, and literally he said, ‘You look like her,’ and he just cast me on the spot.”\n\n“I felt quite awkward,” she added. “I said, ‘Don’t you want to see me act?’ But I just love the piece, and I was really thrilled.” Tamara was indeed a tricky part, she said, though a nice antidote to some of the comic sex-kitten roles she has become known for. But though she didn’t always like or approve of Tamara, she said, she grew to understand her.\n\n“She is a bit of a homewrecker,” Ms. Arterton said. “She’s like Bathsheba”  that is, the Hardy character  “a floozy and a strumpet who flirts with everybody.”\n\nAt the same time, she said, “she has this huge facade, which ultimately gets her in so much trouble, but deep down she’s a good person.” She fought hard, she said, to make sure Tamara’s fragility came through. “In the original script you didn’t see any of that,” Ms. Arterton said. “But now there are a couple of moments when you see that she’s really lonely, that she just needs love and protection.”\n\nOf Tamara, Ms. Arterton said: “Everyone else sees her as beautiful, but she doesn’t see it like that. People’s perception is of this confident, charming, ambitious woman, but she’s just a kind of geek who doesn’t know how to live life.”\n\nMaking films from graphic novels is all the rage these days. “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” pushed the genre by applying comic-book and video game flourishes to the actual movie. With the original “Tamara Drewe,” which was heavy on plot and combined soap-opera turns with an unexpected poignancy, the filmmakers had a built-in storyboard and have adhered surprisingly closely to Ms. Simmonds’s physical depiction of the characters and the setting.\n\nThe plot has been streamlined, with some things left out and others tweaked. Beth, the maligned wife, is overweight and gray haired in Ms. Simmonds’s book; she is foxier, though still obviously downtrodden, in the film. More crucially, the film has spared a character who was killed off by Ms. Simmonds.\n\nMs. Arterton’s physique in the film, the one that launches a thousand mishaps, is voluptuous and un-exercised  playing more to the European than the American movie-star ideal.\n\n“If you’re playing someone who’s fit or whatnot, then I can see it,” Ms. Arterton said of the need to work out. “But for me I find it much more interesting to have energy to put into the work rather than spending all morning at the gym and being exhausted.”\n\nWhat about the short shorts, which feature prominently in the film’s poster and trailer, and which give rise to a memorable joke in the movie, when Beth sees Tamara in them for the first time?\n\nThey were not the only pair Ms. Arterton tried on, and they were the ones she liked the least (for the record, she would have gone with a snug but more modest pair of culottes, sadly rejected).\n\n“I really hated those shorts,” Ms. Arterton said. “I was mortified. But now they’re in the promotional shot, on the poster. And the joke wouldn’t work if they’re not completely up my bum.”"
