Polycom Inc., a maker of voice and video-conferencing equipment, said Wednesday it would acquire SpectraLink, a Boulder- based maker of wireless telephones for businesses, for $229 million.

Polycom, a Pleasanton, Calif.- based company, will pay SpectraLink shareholders $11.75 a share to gain a foothold in the wireless-equipment market.

Shares of SpectraLink closed up 25 cents at $8.81 but soared more than 31 percent in after- hours trading.

SpectraLink employs 600 people worldwide, 325 in Boulder.

“Boulder will remain the headquarters of the wireless business,” said SpectraLink chief executive John Elms. “We would expect to grow and thrive in Boulder. Where there’s overlap, it’s too early to tell.”

The deal has been approved by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close in the next 90 days.

SpectraLink’s wireless telephones are used by professionals in various industries, such as health care and retail. Elms said the use of wireless-phone technology over internal networks within companies is growing and estimated the overall sector is worth about $700 million.

SpectraLink was founded in Boulder in 1990 and released its first product in 1992. The company went public in 1996, Elms said, and is valued at $171.7 million.

Polycom, which is focused on traditional wire-line equipment, will use the SpectraLink brand name to break into that part of the wireless market.

“We have a lot of common synergies to market to similar customers,” said Sunil Bhalla, senior vice president and general manager of Polycom’s voice division. “We both have strong brands and will continue to leverage those brands.”

Elms said the two companies have been in talks for several months about some kind of partnership, but “over the last several months, it’s been very clear that this deal would happen.”

Elms said he and SpectraLink chief financial officer Ernest J. Sampias would leave the company after a transition period.
