        "text": "Polycom has unveiled an enhanced version of its SpectraLink voice-over Wi-Fi handset, giving nurses the ability to capture more clinical data at the point of care.\n\nThe SpectraLink 8452, rolled out today by the Pleasanton, Calif.-based developer of communications solutions for telepresence, video and voice, adds an integrated 2D barcode scanner to the popular 8400 series device, which was introduced last year. Company officials say 2D barcodes are capable of encoding approximately 65 times more data than 1D barcodes into a smaller label.\n\nChris Thorson, Polycom’s director of product marketing, and Ron Emerson, the company’s global director of healthcare, say 2D barcode scanning is rapidly becoming popular in the healthcare setting as providers look to improve access to clinical data at the point of care and reduce dangerous and costly medication errors.\n\n“We’re setting a new bar” for the collection of data at the point of care,” said Thorson. “We want to improve patient safety at the bedside, and giving nurses that ability (to scan 2D barcodes) over an in-building wireless phone that they already have does that.”\n\n“This improves nurse efficiency and it saves a ton of steps,” adds Emerson, who sees the device as a critical tool to help nurses as well as providers who are having problems with a nursing shortage. “We’re empowering nurses to be more efficient.”\n\nAside from giving nurses the ability to scan from a distance of up to 34 inches and from a wide range of horizontal and vertical angles, the SpectraLink 8452 features Polycom HD Voice with dual microphones for clear conversations and less background noise, large color display and support for accessories such as battery packs and headsets. The company plans to synch the device with Microsoft Lync to enable presence and instance message verification.\n\nEmerson and Thorson said the 8452 gives nurses the ability to roam throughout the hospital, campus or clinic without losing authentication between access points, using it to scan patient wristbands, medication containers and devices, communicate with doctors, enter data into an electronic medical record and checks staff assignments. They envision the 8452 also being used by maintenance and support staff for such tasks as locating equipment, checking inventories and answering requests from physicians.\n\nEmerson says nurses are often left in the background when hospitals develop communication strategies, with physicians getting the latest devices or bringing their own. He says the 8452 is ideal for providers who want to bring their nursing departments up to date.\n\nAmong the early adopters of the 8452 is Florida Hospital, which has used SpectraLink devices for the past decade (Polycom acquired SpectraLink roughly four years ago).\n\n\"As we explore technologies to support processes such as bar-coded medication administration, the desire not to require nurses to carry another electronic gizmo was clear,” said Todd Frantz, the hospital’s associate CTO, in a press release issued by Polycom. “There are many good barcode scanning solutions on the market, and we may use several solutions to address various needs, but most require the nurse to manipulate yet another device. When we saw that the 2D barcode scanner is built into the SpectraLink 8452, we wanted to be the first to test it out.”"
