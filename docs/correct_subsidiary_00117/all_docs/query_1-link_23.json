        "text": "Hello Community,\n\nour company successfully runs a large number of VVX600 devices in the office and a Skype for Business 2016 Server/Infrastructure.\n\nIn addition we use some Aastra / Mitel DECT devices in production and Mitel SIP-DECT 6.2 software satisfying. As an alternative to these DECT devices, we want to test the Spectalink 8440 in production now.\n\nThe test device, which our local partner has left us, is operated with UCS 4.14.0.1071. The WiFi setup works fine, but after entering the user credentials, there is an error \"Line unregistered\".\n\nIn the <MAC> -app.log it also comes to the same same entry every few minutes:\n\n1025113041 | sip | * | 00 | Sip REGISTER failure code 403 1025113041 | sip | 4 | 00 | CTcpSocket :: Abandon connected socket. SendMessage 0x40d3dfc8 1025113041 | sip | 4 | 00 | CTcpSocket :: TlsListenThread: SSL_get_error Error code = 5 1025113041 | sip | 4 | 00 | TLS Lists Thread Exit 1025113100 | ticks | * | 00 | User certificate renewed track\n\nI've also tried to update the device to the newest UCS 5.0.0.1079, but thies Version is not shown on the Polycom Update Server and our own Provisional Server runs just for the VVX600 devices. I'm really unsure to extract the files into the same directory as the VVX600 files. So I tried to setup an xml File like this:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"yes\" ?> <PHONE_IMAGES> <REVISION> <PHONE_IMAGE> <VERSION>5.0.0.1079</VERSION> <PATH>http://10.210.7.8/8400Software/SL8400_Lync_App_5.0.0.1079</PATH> </PHONE_IMAGE> </REVISION> </PHONE_IMAGES>\n\nThe path is directing to a local IIS Server, I can enter the path of the xml file (http://10.210.7.8/8400Software/8400Software.xml) as custom server adress, the Version 5.0.0.1079 is shown. After click on install, there is the confiormation popup, the license agreement but the phone IS NOT rebooting and installing the UCS. The <MAC>-app.log shows:\n\n1025114919|cfg |*|00|RT|Changed prov general 1025114919|cfg |*|00|Prov|Starting to update slnk84xx.lync.ld 1025114920|cfg |4|00|Prov|cfgProvConfParamUpdate: END 1025114920|cfg |*|00|Prov|Finished updating configuration\n\nAt present I have no idea what I can still do to update and register the user or register the line."
