        "text": "According to a new report by Juniper Research, Cisco will be the undisputed leader in both the Enterprise VoIP Access Point market and the VoIP WLAN Switch/Mobility Controller market in the next few years. Juniper estimates the total market to be worth around $2bn this year growing to $15bn in 2012.\n\nReport Author, Basharat Hamid Ashai said that \"Cisco has a worldwide market presence and huge resources that makes it difficult for any other vendor to take market share. Other vendors such as Aruba Networks, Trapeze Networks, Proxim Wireless and Meru Networks are poised to face stiff competition, not being able to maintain a lead for more than two or three consecutive years. However, these companies are growing at a good pace and are almost on a par with each other in terms of the success in this sector\".\n\nVoIP Access Points for enterprises are expected to reach over $5bn in revenues by 2012, growing from $930m this year. North American revenues are expected to grow from $442m in 2007 to $1.75bn in 2012. EMEA and Asia Pacific revenues are expected to reach $1.7bn and $1.6bn respectively by 2012.\n\nVoIP WLAN Switch/ Mobility Controllers for enterprises are expected to reach almost $8bn by 2012, growing from just under $1bn in 2007. North American revenues are expected to grow from around a $0.5bn in 2007 to $2.7 Billion in 2012 with EMEA and Asia Pac revenues reaching $2.7bn and $1.4bn respectively by 2012.\n\nVoIP over Wi-Fi handsets (single mode) are predicted to ship $155m worth in 2007 increasing to $1.5bn by 2012. North American revenues are to grow from $93m this year to $600m in 2012. EMEA and Asia Pac is expected to touch $480m and $324m respectively by 2012. The report found that Spectralink (acquired by Polycom) is expected to lead the single mode VoIP over Wi-Fi handset market for the coming few years aided by its powerful OEM relationships with Avaya, Inter-Tel, NEC, Alcatel and Nortel.\n\nJuniper Research provides analytical services to the global hi-tech communications sector, providing analyst reports, consultancy and industry surveys."
