Upon completing registration, shareholders will receive further instructions by e-mail, including links that will allow them to access the Annual Meeting, submit questions, and vote online during the Annual Meeting. Shareholders will not be able to attend the Annual Meeting in person. A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for inspection during the Annual Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/KTB2024, upon registration and log-in.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThomas L. Doerr, Jr.\n\nExecutive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\n\nImportant Notice Regarding the Availabilty of Proxy\n\nMaterials for the Shareholder Meeting to be held on April 18, 2024. This Proxy Statement and our Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) is furnishing you this Proxy Statement to solicit proxies, on its behalf, to be voted at the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) to be held on Thursday, April 18, 2024, at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time, via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/KTB2024, and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. The format of the Annual Meeting will be a virtual-only meeting. Shareholders will not be able to attend the Annual Meeting in person. We have designed the format of the Annual Meeting to ensure that shareholders are afforded similar rights and opportunities to participate as they would at an in-person meeting, using online tools to ensure shareholder access and participation.\n\nThe Board has made this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report available to you over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com or, upon your request, has mailed you a printed version of these proxy materials in connection with the Annual Meeting. We mailed the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice”) to our shareholders, and this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report were posted to the above-referenced website, beginning on or about March 7, 2024.\n\nWho May VoteIf, at the close of business on February 15, 2024 (the “Record Date”), you held shares of Kontoor common stock (a) directly in your name as a shareholder of record or (b) through a broker, bank or other nominee (shares held in “street name”), you have one vote for each such share of Kontoor common stock and may vote your shares by proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by mail, or you may vote your shares during the live webcast of the Annual Meeting. For shares held in street name, you generally cannot vote your shares directly and instead may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. Please refer to information from your broker, bank or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. As of the close of business on the Record Date, 55,752,040 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote.How to Obtain Meeting Materials\n\nAll Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting, including this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report, are available to you over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. All shareholders have been separately provided with the Notice and, as indicated in the Notice, if you want to receive a paper or email copy of these documents, you must request one. There is no charge to you for requesting a copy. Shareholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions in the Notice for requesting such materials. Please make your request as instructed in that Notice prior to April 4, 2024 to facilitate timely delivery.\n\nWhat Constitutes a QuorumThe presence, on the live webcast of the Annual Meeting or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to cast a vote on a particular matter to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum for the purposes of consideration and action on the matter. Abstentions are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Shares represented by “broker non-votes” also are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. However, as described below under “How Votes are Counted,” if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote (a “broker non-vote”).Votes Required\n\nFor Proposal No. 1, you may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” each of the eight director nominees or abstain from voting. Proposal No. 1 requires that each director is elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at a meeting at which a quorum is present assuming the election is uncontested (a plurality voting standard applies in contested elections). For this purpose, a majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted “FOR” a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted “AGAINST” such director nominee. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors. Please refer to Proposal No. 1 for information regarding our policy on majority voting in uncontested elections of directors and our policy on incumbent director resignation in an uncontested election.\n\nFor Proposal No. 2, you may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” or abstain from voting. Proposal No. 2 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the shares cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be considered as votes cast on Proposal No. 2 but will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.\n\nFor Proposal No. 3, you may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” or abstain from voting. Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Abstentions will not be considered as votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the proposal. Because the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter, there will be no broker non-votes with respect to Proposal No. 3, and a broker will be permitted to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on Proposal No. 3 in accordance with the applicable NYSE rules.\n\nFor Proposal No. 4, you may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” or abstain from voting. Proposal No. 4 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Proposal No. 4 is advisory in nature and non-binding, and the Board will review the voting results and expects to take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered as votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on Proposal No. 4.\n\nHow Votes are\n\nCounted\n\nFor shareholders of record, all shares represented by the proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with instructions given by the shareholders. Where a shareholder returns its signed proxy and no instructions are given with respect to a given matter, the shares will be voted: (1) “FOR” the election of each of the Board’s director nominees; (2) “FOR” approval of the amendments to our Articles of Incorporation to replace all supermajority voting standards with majority voting standards; (3) “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024; (4) “FOR” the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers; and (5) as recommended by the Board or, if no recommendation is given, in the discretion of the proxy holders upon such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record and you do not return your proxy, no votes will be cast on your behalf on any of the items of business at the Annual Meeting.\n\nFor beneficial owners of shares held in street name, the brokers, banks or other nominees holding shares for beneficial owners will vote those shares as you instruct. Absent instructions from you, brokers, banks and other nominees may vote your shares only as they decide as to matters for which they have discretionary authority under the applicable NYSE rules. A broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretion to vote on the election of directors or approval of the compensation of our named executive officers. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on those matters, no votes will be cast on your behalf on Proposal No. 1, Proposal No. 2 or Proposal No. 4. Your broker will be entitled to vote your shares in its discretion, absent instructions from you, on Proposal No. 3.\n\nBy Internet\n\nGo to the website www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions on how to complete an electronic proxy card, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You will need the\n\n16-digit number included\n\non your Notice or proxy\n\ncard to vote by Internet.\n\nBy Telephone\n\nFrom a touch-tone telephone, dial 1-800-690-6903 and follow the recorded instructions, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You will need the 16-digit number included on your Notice or proxy card in order to vote by telephone.\n\nBy Mail\n\nRequest a proxy card from us by following the instructions on your Notice. When you receive the proxy card, mark your selections on the proxy card. Date and sign your name exactly as it appears on your proxy card. Mail the proxy card in the enclosed postage- paid envelope provided to you, or return it to:\n\nVOTE PROCESSING,\n\nc/o Broadridge\n\n51 Mercedes Way\n\nEdgewood, NY 11717\n\nDuring the Annual Meeting\n\nTo submit questions in advance of the meeting, and vote and ask questions during the live webcast of the Annual Meeting, you are encouraged to register at www.proxyvote.com, using your control number and other information, prior to Wednesday, April 17, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
