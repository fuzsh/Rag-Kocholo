        "text": "SpectraLink Wi-Fi Phone Considerations\n\nThe SpectraLink SL8440 and SL8450 Wi-Fi models differ significantly from the other Polycom phone models. The most basic difference is the wireless connectivity capability of the SpectraLink phones through Wi-Fi. Along with supporting 802.11b/g/n, they also support WEP, WPA, WPA2-PSK, and WPA2-Enterprise for wireless security. They also require business class wireless access points that support WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) protocols, requiring extra steps of Wi-Fi connectivity configuration before DHCP/DNS setup.\n\nIt is also important to note that the firmware and provisioning of these devices are \"End of Life\" (EOL), so newer supported firmware versions are not available. For a complete list of supported standards and recommended practices, see the Polycom product documentation."
