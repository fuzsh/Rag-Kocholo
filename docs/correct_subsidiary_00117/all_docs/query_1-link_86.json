        "text": "Who We Are\n\nThe repair technicians at TeleCOMMHit Inc. have been experts in the communications repair world for over 15 years.\n\nOur repair engineers have been repairing communications equipment since it first became popular for customers to start maintaining their own communications equipment. Our repair facility is a true Component Level repair facility, so our technicians have to be highly skilled and have a large amount of experience, and their skill level shows in the products we are able to repair. We have always repaired a wide variety of equipment and make a commitment to repair the more difficult communications equipment like wireless products, voice conferencing equipment, video conferencing equipment, and VOIP systems.\n\nThis commitment means that when you choose as your repair vendor, you will only need one vendor for all of your repair services. We have the ability to repair Avaya, Nortel, Cisco, Polycom, SpectraLink and NEC, but are not limited to these communications vendors; we can give a custom quote for any services you may require.\n\nOur business concept is to bring the customer the products they desire at a bargain price and maintain the highest level of customer satisfaction."
