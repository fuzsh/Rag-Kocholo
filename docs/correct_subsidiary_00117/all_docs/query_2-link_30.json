So far they're working fantastically, however when I try to update the software on the units it can't reach the Polycom hosted update server or the IP for it. Are these too old to interface with the update server, or should I be using a different custom server path?\n\nHello @nvanw27 ,\n\nWelcome to the Poly Community.\n\nSpectraLink has not been a Poly company for around 10 years.
