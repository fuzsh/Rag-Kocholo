Since the 8002 works, what are the chances that other VoWiFi phones work too?\n\nI could not find much information on the 8002 phone you have. We have used the Spectralink i640 as our VoWiFi telephones. We have had a few issues with call quality dealing with our network setup but overall they have been great.\n\nI have looked for competitors and have not had much luck. It seem Spectralink is the leading manufacturer.\n\nTrey wrote:\n\nI could not find much information on the 8002 phone you have. We have used the Spectralink i640 as our VoWiFi telephones.

It seem Spectralink is the leading manufacturer.\n\nIssues with regards to the wired or wireless portion of the network?\n\nRecently, I’ve had some problems with the batteries of the 8002 - I have some new batteries, but there is a phone that does not like the new ones. They are not even third-party batteries, and I have a suspicion that it’s the phone itself for some reason.\n\nAlso the UI on the 8002 reminds me of a mid-90’s cell phone, the buttons are horrible to use. But then again we’ve had them for a few years already, and I thought there must be better ones out there.\n\nIts funny you ask. I am in the same situation. We tried the 8030 (which were supposed to work), but did not. Toshiba was not helpful. Polycom said they would work, but you needed to have an SVP Appliance to provide the QOS for them, or they will not work. BOGUS. I sent them back. I am going to try the Spectralink 8440 which Polycom said just need a SIP server (Which the Strata is). They don’t require QOS although recommended. I can let you know more as soon as I get them. Should be in the next couple days.\n\nAgreed nintendo1889. However when you have 2 SIP phones and a network that is not very busy, adding a dedicated appliance for the QOS, rather than relying on your AP/Controller, was not realistic. We have been using a Hitachi Cable phones for 3 years with just the AP QOS and have had NO quality issues… Thank you for clarifying.\n\nYalodare wrote:\n\nIts funny you ask.

These two are exactly the models I was looking at.\n\nAlso, Toshiba’s Strata General Description (CIX-GD-ALL-VF_E.pdf, Google for it) refers to Hitachi IP5000E-A, but this seems to be a bit more elusive model.\n\nI’ve asked my vendor with some suggestions, but they are at loss. I trust them with anything related to the Toshiba Strata itself, but anything network related is not their strong side. I’ve even tried installing a soft phone just so that I could learn how to configure any generic SIP device, but so far no luck.\n\nThe Hitachi IP5000E is what we had. They work well, but the battery life is pretty poor. That was are only complaint with the phone. They were easy to set up and only needed minor configuration.\n\nAs for the Strata, we did have to make sure we had licenses for the SIP (We currently have 2). Those are separate from your DKT phone licenses. Then I just had to put in the Strata IP card is my SIP Host, the user name (extension) and left the password blank. Phones worked great.\n\nI did test a soft phone. I used CounterPath X-Lite 4. Installed and configured the following parameters:\n\nUser ID: Extension of the Device Configured for SIP on the Strata\n\nDomain: IP of the Strata IP Card\n\nThat’s it, and it was working.\n\nI will be sure and post my experience with the 8440s."
