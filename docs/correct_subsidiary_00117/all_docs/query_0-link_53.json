        "text": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if it's possible to get a Grandstream GXV3370 to use Multicast paging to page a Polycom VVX500. We got some new Polycom VVX phones, and one secretary at our workplace that is using a Grandstream GXV3370 to page to it. This works fine for an Algo Speaker, but it can't reach our new Polycom VVX500. Does Polycom need a special configuration to accept RTP Multicast Paging from a grand stream phone?\n\nThe Polycom is running Firmware version: 5.9.7.3480. And it's possible for the Algo Speaker to Send/Receive Pages from the Polycom because it has a setting specifically for Polycom. But I guess it's not possible for the Grandstream Phone to page the Polycom and the Algo Speaker simultaneously.\n\nHello @wcafranklin ,\n\nWelcome back to the Poly Community.\n\nAgain the FAQ describes the Paging functionality and we can only assume that the other vendor does not use the same format:\n\nJan 21, 2014 Question: How can I use PTT / Push To Talk / Paging / Page ?\n\nResolution: Please check => here <=\n\nOur PAGE implementation goes back to when Polycom acquired SpectraLink and we, therefore, added this to our phone software.\n\nAlgo can do Poly paging.\n\nPlease ensure to provide some feedback if this reply has helped you so other users can profit from your experience.\n\nBest Regards\n\nSteffen Baier\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNotice: I am an HP Poly employee but all replies within the community are done as a volunteer outside of my day role. This community forum is not an official HP Poly support resource, thus responses from HP Poly employees, partners, and customers alike are best-effort in attempts to share learned knowledge.\n\nIf you need immediate and/or official assistance for former Poly\\Plantronics\\Polycom please open a service ticket through your support channels\n\nFor HP products please check HP Support.\n\nPlease also ensure you always check the General VoIP , Video Endpoint , UC Platform (Microsoft) , PSTN\n\nThank you for the reply, but perhaps the Grandstream phone is not able to Page the Polycom directly with multicast paging, but perhaps I can use our Asterisk Server to do Multicast Paging or just a page in general, do you know if there are particular settings to get a Polycom phone to get a Page?\n\nI know that if I enable Auto-Answer on Grandstream Phone I can just use this SIP Header command in Asterisk extensions.conf :\n\nexten => 1234, 1, SIPAddHeader(Call-Info: Answer-After=0) exten => 1234, 2, Page(SIP/1234)\n\nAnd then when I dial 1234 it sends a SIP page to Grandstream with that header the Grandstream phone will auto answer. Is there one for Polycom?\n\nWhen I used it, with normal settings on the Algo Speaker, it worked fine, but Polycom it always rings, it never Autoanswers a Page from Asterisk."
