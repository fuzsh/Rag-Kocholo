        "text": "Communications firm Polycom Inc. plans to sell its wireless handset business — acquired five years ago via the purchase of Boulder-based SpectraLink — for $110 million, officials announced late Thursday.\n\nPleasanton, Calif.-based Polycom reached an agreement to sell its wireless voice products business to Sun Capital Partners Inc. in a deal that is slated to be completed by the third quarter. Polycom acquired the wireless handset operations through a $220 million acquisition of Boulder’s SpectraLink.\n\nPolycom since relocated the local operations to Westminster.\n\nCompany officials could not be reached for comment about the transaction.\n\nIn a press release, Polycom CEO Andy Miller said the sale will allow his firm to focus its efforts on its core communications technologies and its video-based communication products.\n\n“This is a logical next step for our business and a strategic decision that should enable the wireless voice organization to flourish as a standalone company,” Miller said in the release. “Polycom has selected Sun Capital because of its commitment to support Polycom’s wireless handset partners and customers, as well as its strong operational expertise, particularly in corporate divestitures that require seamless transfers of significant business operations.”"
