We first mailed or delivered this proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card to our stockholders on or about April 24, 2006.\n\nTHE ANNUAL MEETING\n\nWhen and where is the meeting? The annual meeting is scheduled to be held at our headquarters at One Liberty Plaza, 50th floor, New York, New York, on May 23, 2006, at 10:00 a.m. local time.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the meeting? At the annual meeting, the holders of Nasdaqs voting securities will be asked to consider and vote upon each of the following matters:\n\n1. To elect 11 directors to one-year terms;\n\n2. To ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006; and\n\n3. To transact such other business as may come before the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.\n\nWho is entitled to vote? Only holders of record listed on the books of Nasdaq at the close of business on April 13, 2006 (the record date) of the following Nasdaq securities will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting:\n\n common stock, par value $0.01 per share;\n\n Series D preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share; and\n\n 3.75% Series A convertible notes due 2012 and 3.75% Series B convertible notes due 2012 (collectively, the voting notes and together with the common stock and Series D preferred stock, Nasdaq securities).\n\nAs of the record date, there were outstanding 93,363,675 shares of common stock (including shares of restricted common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting) and one share of Series D preferred stock. National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) owns the one share of Series D preferred stock and will hold this share until we become operational as a national securities exchange. At a special meeting of stockholders in September 2005, stockholders approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation granting the holders of the voting notes the right to vote with holders of the common stock and Series D preferred stock on matters submitted for a vote of stockholders. The voting notes are held by Silver Lake Partners TSA, L.P., Silver Lake Investors L.P., Silver Lake Partners II TSA, L.P. and Silver Lake Technology Investors II, L.P. (which, collectively, we refer to as the Silver Lake entities throughout this proxy statements), Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners IV, L.P., H&F International Partners, IV-A, L.P., H&F International Partners, IV-B, L.P., H&F International Partners and H&F Executive Fund IV, L.P. and its affiliated entities (which, collectively, we refer to as Hellman & Friedman throughout this proxy statement) and Integral Capital Partners VI, L.P. and VAB Investors, LLC.\n\nHolders of warrants issued by NASD who have exercised these warrants for voting trust certificates will not be able to vote the underlying shares of common stock at the annual meeting. NASD has the right to vote the\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\nshares of common stock that as of the record date remained subject to a voting trust pursuant to a voting trust agreement dated June 28, 2000, as amended, among Nasdaq, NASD, The Bank of New York and Mellon Investor Services, LLC. If you hold shares of common stock that remained subject to the voting trust as of the record date, you will receive the proxy statement and annual report to stockholders for informational purposes, but will not receive a proxy card to vote these shares of common stock.\n\nA list of holders entitled to vote at the annual meeting will be available at the annual meeting and for ten days prior to the meeting, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. local time, at our principal executive offices, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York. You may arrange to review this list by contacting Joan Conley, c/o The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006.\n\nHow many votes do I have? Each share of common stock has one vote, subject to the voting limitation in our restated certificate of incorporation that generally prohibits a holder, other than NASD, from voting in excess of 5% of the total voting power of Nasdaq. The share of Series D preferred stock is entitled to a number of votes that, together with all other votes entitled to be cast by the holder of the Series D preferred stock, is equal to one vote more than one-half of all votes entitled to be cast by all holders of Nasdaq securities as of the record date. The holder of each voting note is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which that voting note could be converted on the record date, subject to the 5% voting limitation contained in the restated certificate of incorporation.\n\nThe enclosed proxy card shows the number of Nasdaq securities that you are entitled to vote. Your individual vote is confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties.\n\nWhat constitutes a quorum? The presence of the owners of a majority (greater than 50%) of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the Nasdaq securities constitutes a quorum. Presence may be in person or by proxy. You will be considered part of the quorum if you return a signed and dated proxy card, if you vote by telephone or the Internet, or if you vote at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a bank or broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the bank or broker does not have discretionary voting power with respect to the item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.\n\nWho counts the votes? Our transfer agent, Mellon Investor Services, tabulates the votes and acts as inspector of elections.\n\nHow do I vote? You can ensure that your Nasdaq securities are voted at the meeting by:\n\n attending the meeting and voting in person, as discussed below; or\n\n submitting your instructions by telephone, by Internet or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy form in the envelope provided.\n\nVote by Telephone. You may instruct the proxy holders how to vote your Nasdaq securities by telephone by dialing, at no cost to you, the toll-free number printed on your proxy card. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. (E.D.T.) on May 22, 2006. You must enter your control number, which is printed in the lower right hand corner below the proxy section of the proxy card. You will then receive easy-to-follow voice prompts allowing you to instruct the proxy holders how to vote your Nasdaq securities and to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by telephone, you do not need to return your proxy card. If you are located outside the United States and Canada, you should instruct the proxy holders how to vote your Nasdaq securities by Internet or by mail.\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nVote by Internet. You can also choose to instruct the proxy holders how to vote your Nasdaq securities through the Internet. The website address for Internet voting is printed on your proxy card. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. (E.D.T.) on May 22, 2006. As with telephone voting, you must enter your control number, which is printed in the lower right hand corner below the proxy section of the proxy card and you will be given the opportunity to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote through the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card.\n\nVote by Mail. If you choose to vote by mail, simply mark your proxy card, sign and date it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided.\n\nHow do I complete the proxy? The proxy provides that each holder may vote his or her Nasdaq securities For the director nominees or to Withhold Authority for the individual nominees or for all of the nominees, and may vote For or Against or Abstain from voting with respect to the ratification of Nasdaqs registered public accounting firm.\n\nWhichever of methods you select to transmit your instructions, the proxy holders will vote your Nasdaq securities as provided by those instructions. IF YOU RETURN A SIGNED PROXY WITHOUT SPECIFIC VOTING INSTRUCTIONS, YOUR NASDAQ SECURITIES WILL BE VOTED BY THE PROXY HOLDERS FOR THE ELECTION OF THE DIRECTORS AND FOR THE OTHER PROPOSALS SET FORTH HEREIN. If your Nasdaq securities are held by a broker, bank or other nominee that does not have authority, either express or discretionary, to vote on a particular matter, you will receive instructions from your nominee, which you must follow to have your Nasdaq securities voted. The broker, bank or other nominee may only vote the Nasdaq securities that it holds for you as provided by your instructions.\n\nWhat do I need to do to attend the annual meeting? If you are a holder of record, you should indicate on your proxy card that you plan to attend the meeting by marking the box on the proxy card provided for that purpose. For the safety and comfort of our stockholders, admission to the annual meeting will be restricted to holders of record and beneficial owners of Nasdaq securities as of April 13, 2006. You will need to provide a valid government-issued photo identification, such as a drivers license or passport, to gain entry to the annual meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of Nasdaq securities held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you also will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the meeting. A recent brokerage statement or letter from the bank, broker, or other nominee are examples of proof of ownership. If you want to vote in person your Nasdaq securities held in street name, you will have to obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record.\n\nWhat are the Boards recommendations? The Nasdaq board recommends that you vote FOR each of the nominees for director named in Proposal 1 and FOR Proposal 2.\n\nWhat vote is required to approve each proposal?\n\nElection of Directors. Our directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast at the meeting. Thus, any securities not voted, whether by abstention, broker non-vote, withholding authority or otherwise, do not impact the vote. This year, we updated our corporate governance guidelines to require, in an uncontested election that a director-nominee who receives a greater number of votes withheld from his or her election than votes for such election is required to promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. The Corporate Governance Committee of the Nasdaq board then will consider the resignation offer and recommend to the full board whether to accept it. The Nasdaq board is required to act on the recommendation and to publicly disclose its decision-making process with respect to the director resignation. See Nasdaq Corporate Governance Guidelines and Codes of Ethics for full details of this policy.\n\nRatification of Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP. This proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to vote at the meeting. For this vote, abstentions have the effect of a vote against this proposal and broker non-votes will have no impact on the vote.\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat if other items come up at the annual meeting and I am not there to vote? We are not now aware of any matters to be presented at the annual meeting other than those described in this proxy statement. When you return a signed and dated proxy card or provide your voting instructions by telephone or the Internet, you give the proxy holders (the names of which are listed on your proxy card) the discretionary authority to vote on your behalf on any other matter that is properly brought before the annual meeting. If the meeting is adjourned or postponed, your Nasdaq securities may be voted by the proxy holders on the new meeting date, unless you have revoked your proxy instructions before that date.\n\nCan I change my vote? You can change your vote by revoking your proxy at any time before it is exercised in one of three ways:\n\n Notify Nasdaqs corporate secretary, Joan C. Conley, c/o The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, in writing or by facsimile (at 202-978-5088) that you are revoking your proxy;\n\n Submit a later dated proxy (including a proxy submitted by telephone or through the Internet); or\n\n Vote in person at the annual meeting.\n\nHow do I access proxy materials on the Internet? Holders of Nasdaq securities can access our notice of annual meeting and proxy statement and annual report on the Internet on our website at http://ir.nasdaq.com/meeting.cfm.\n\nWho is paying the costs of this proxy solicitation? We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by directors, officers or employees (who will not receive any additional compensation for these solicitations) in person or by telephone, electronic transmission and facsimile transmission. Nasdaq will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks, and other nominees for their reasonable expenses in sending proxy material to their principals and obtaining their proxies. We have hired Mellon Investors Services to assist in soliciting proxies at a fee of $7,500 plus costs and expenses for these services. Your cooperation in promptly submitting your proxy by telephone, through the Internet or by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card to vote your Nasdaq securities will help to avoid additional expense.\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPROPOSAL I\n\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe business and affairs of Nasdaq are managed under the direction of the board of directors. Pursuant to the certificate of incorporation and Nasdaqs by-laws, the Nasdaq board may determine the total number of directors. The authorized size of the board of directors currently is 15 directors, consisting of four Class 1 directors, four Class 2 directors and seven Class 3 directors. Prior to May 2005, each class of our board of directors held office for staggered terms of three years. One of the three classes was elected each year to succeed the directors whose terms were expiring. At the May 2005 annual meeting, Nasdaq shareholders approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation that eliminated our classified board prospectively. To implement this prospective phase-out, our Class 2 directors were elected to serve a one year term at the 2005 annual meeting. At this annual meeting, you are being asked to elect both Class 2 and Class 3 directors to serve one year terms. From 2007 forward, all directors will be elected to serve only one year terms and we will no longer designate directors as Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3.\n\nThe Class 2 directors whose terms will expire at the annual meeting are: Daniel Coleman, Patrick J. Healy, Merit E. Janow and Thomas Stemberg. The Class 3 directors whose terms will expire at the annual meeting are: Michael Casey, Jeffrey N. Edwards, Lon Gorman, John D. Markese, Thomas F. O Neill, James S. Riepe and Deborah L. Wince-Smith. Each of the Class 2 and Class 3 directors have been nominated for re-election.\n\nAll nominees have consented to be named in this proxy statement and to serve on the Nasdaq board, if elected. In the event that any nominee should not be available, the persons named in the proxy will vote for the other nominees and may vote for a substitute for the unavailable nominee. The Nasdaq board has determined that each of the directors and nominees listed below, with the exception of Mr. Greifeld, is considered independent of Nasdaq pursuant to the standards of independence applicable to companies listed on The Nasdaq National Market.\n\nUnder Nasdaqs by-laws, all directors are classified as:\n\n Industry Directors;\n\n Non-Industry Directors, which are further classified as Public Directors and Issuer Representatives; and\n\n Staff Directors (limit of two).\n\nThe number of Non-Industry Directors, including at least one Public Director and at least two Issuer Representatives of Nasdaq-listed companies, is required to equal or exceed the number of Industry Directors, unless the Nasdaq board consists of nine or fewer directors. In that case, only one director is required to be an Issuer Representative. We establish the classification of each director based on a questionnaire with specific questions related to each of the classifications. Nasdaqs Corporate Secretary annually certifies to the board of directors the classification of each director.\n\nThe following is a general description of Nasdaqs director classifications:\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Non-Industry Director means a director who is not a Nasdaq employee and who is (i) a Public Director; (ii) an Issuer Representative; or (iii) any other individual who would not be an Industry Director.\n\n Public Director means a director who has no material business relationship with a broker or dealer or the NASD, NASDR, or Nasdaq and does not meet the definition of Industry Director.\n\nInformation With Respect to Director Nominees\n\nListed below are the nominees for Class 2 and Class 3 directors. The information for each nominee include his or her principal occupation, business experience and current public directorships, if any, the age as of the date of this proxy statement, and the year was first elected a director of Nasdaq. Each nominee, if elected, will serve for a one-year term expiring at the 2007 annual meeting and upon their successors being duly elected and qualified.\n\nWe are obligated by the terms of a securityholders agreement dated April 22, 2005 between Nasdaq and Hellman & Friedman to nominate and generally use best efforts to cause the election to the Nasdaq board of one individual designated by Hellman & Friedman. Mr. Healy has been designated by Hellman & Friedman as its candidate and has been nominated to the Nasdaq board. Our board of directors has determined that each of the nominees is considered independent of Nasdaq pursuant to the standards of independence applicable to companies listed on The Nasdaq National Market.\n\nUnless authority is withheld, proxies in the accompanying form will be voted in favor of electing the nominees as Class 2 and Class 3 directors of Nasdaq. If your proxy is executed in such a manner as to withhold authority to vote for one or more nominees for director, the persons named as proxies will follow your instructions.\n\nName\n\nAge\n\nClass\n\nClassification\n\nDirector\n\nSince\n\nMichael Casey\n\n60 3 Non-Industry 2001\n\nDaniel Coleman\n\n41 2 Industry 2005\n\nJeffrey N.

The annual equity award and any restricted shares elected as part of the annual retainer will be awarded automatically to directors on the date of the annual stockholders meeting immediately following election and appointment to the board and will vest two years from the date of grant. The number of shares of restricted stock to be awarded is calculated based on the closing price of the common stock on the date prior to the grant. Unvested shares are forfeited in certain circumstances upon termination of the directors service on the Nasdaq board.\n\nThe payments to committee chairs and members of the Audit Committee are made in lump sum cash payments at the beginning of the annual compensation cycle in May. Board and committee meeting fees will be paid in arrears on a quarterly basis. Directors do not receive retirement, health or life insurance benefits.

Specifically, the Committee:\n\n reviews and approves base salary and incentive compensation awards for officers of Nasdaq whose base salary is in excess of $200,000 and/or whose total annual cash compensation, including targeted incentive compensation, exceeds $400,000;\n\n reviews and recommends to the Nasdaq board of directors approval of all compensation and benefit plans for officers and staff of Nasdaq;\n\n reviews and approves performance goals for Nasdaq officers covered under the Executive Corporate Incentive Plan (ECIP);\n\n reviews and approves all equity awards granted to officers and staff of Nasdaq greater than 10,000 shares. Equity awards of 100,000 shares or greater will be referred to the full board of directors for ratification upon Committee review and approval;\n\n provides the Nasdaq board with quarterly reports on the distribution of equity awards.\n\nEach member of the Committee qualifies as a non-employee director under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Committee met eight times in 2005 and met in executive session at five committee meetings.\n\nGeneral Compensation Philosophy\n\nNasdaqs general continuing compensation philosophy is to provide a results based, total reward opportunity that firmly positions Nasdaq to attract, motivate and retain key executives and other key employees. Nasdaq works with external compensation consultants in order to ensure that we remain competitive with regard to compensation. Nasdaq approaches this objective through the following primary components:\n\n Base Salary  Base salaries for officers and staff are reviewed on an annual basis and at the time of promotion or other increase in responsibilities. External compensation survey data is used to compare levels of compensation for individuals holding comparable positions at targeted peer group companies. Individual performance and retention risk are also taken into consideration when reviewing base salaries.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Long-Term Incentives  Equity awards are designed to align the interests of officers and staff with those of shareholders by rewarding outstanding performance and providing incentives to increase long-term shareholder value. Periodic grants of long-term stock-based compensation, such as restricted stock or stock options are subject to performance-based and/or time-based vesting requirements. Nasdaq stock ownership is also made attractive for eligible employees through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Under the ESPP, shares of common stock may be purchased at six-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each offering period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their annual compensation, subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Service limitations. Participation in the ESPP is voluntary. Approximately 33% of eligible employees participated in the ESPP in 2005.\n\nNasdaq Performance\n\nThe Committee believes that the most important measure of Nasdaq performance is the increase in long-term stockholder value, attained through the achievement of specific annual performance measures targeted in the ECIP. The Committee approved the 2005 incentive compensation awards for named executive officers shown in the Summary Compensation Table that follows this report. In making payments in respect to ECIP awards at the beginning of 2006, the Committee reviewed the 2005 corporate financial and strategic accomplishments as well as individual performance against goals for all executives. The 2006 parameters for ECIP were set in January 2006. The Committee believes that the grants of performance accelerated stock option (PASO) awards discussed below further aligns individual compensation with corporate performance and encourages long-term employment.\n\nExecutive Compensation\n\nThe Committee considers both quantitative and qualitative performance factors in making compensation decisions for executive officers of Nasdaq. The Committee also continues to solicit input from Nasdaqs CEO and President regarding total compensation and equity for those executives who report directly to him. Mr. Greifeld and Mr. Knight are the only executive officers covered by employment agreements as discussed in Employment Agreements. A discussion of Mr. Greifelds compensation is contained later in this report.\n\nBase Salaries. In determining base salaries of executive officers, a variety of factors are considered, including: individual performance and future potential, skills and prior experience, scope of responsibility and accountability within the organization, relevant external market pay level information encompassing all cash and equity compensation, and retention risk. Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis; however, adjustments may occur at the time of notable changes in executive responsibility or in response to events that would impact the long-term retention of a key executive. In 2005, salary increases were approved for four executives, including one named executive officer. Ms. Friedman received an increase of $25,000, bringing her new salary to $325,000. The other three executives received an average increase of $25,000 or 8.3% of base salary. The remaining executive officers, including Mr. Greifeld, did not receive any increase in base salary in 2005. The Committee has reviewed base salaries for 2006 and has increased Mr. Greifelds base salary to $1,000,000 as of January 18, 2006. Some of the factors that the Committee considered when determining these increases in 2005 and 2006 were individual performance and peer comparison.\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAnnual Cash Incentives. Through annual cash incentives, a significant portion of total cash compensation is at risk and performance based. Annual cash incentives are generally paid to our named executive officers through the ECIP, which is intended to comply with the qualified performance based exception to the limitation on the deduction of compensation paid to certain key executives of Nasdaq pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The ECIP is intended to provide annual incentives to certain key executives who make substantial contributions to Nasdaq, contingent upon continued employment and meeting certain company and individual business unit performance goals. Section 162(m) of the Code provides a limit of $1,000,000 on the amount of compensation that may be deducted by a public company in any year in respect of each of the CEO and the next four most highly paid executive officers. The Committee has endeavored and will continue to endeavor to utilize this exception to Section 162(m) to maximize the deductibility of compensation. However, in order to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers and to attract needed leadership in exceptional circumstances, a policy that all compensation must be deductible has not been adopted and the Committee believes that such a policy is not in the best interests of Nasdaq or its stockholders.\n\nThe maximum award payable to any participant for any plan year will not exceed the greater of 3% of Nasdaqs before tax net income or $3 million. In 2005, there were no guaranteed minimum cash incentives for any executive officer and none are expected for 2006. All payments are subject to adjustment at the discretion of Nasdaq to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and high standards of regulatory and market integrity.\n\nThe Nasdaq board has discretion under the ECIP to set annual performance goals to measure performance for purposes of payouts under the ECIP. The Board reconsiders which performance goals to use each year and may set performance goals from among the following list:\n\n(a) Earnings per share of Nasdaqs common stock;\n\n(b) Revenue growth;\n\n(c) Net income or net profits (before or after taxes);\n\n(d) Return measures (including, but not limited to, return on assets or net assets, capital, equity, or sales);\n\n(e) Cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow and free cash flow);\n\n(f) Expense targets;\n\n(g) Planning accuracy (as measured by comparing planned results to actual results);\n\n(h) Market share\n\n(i) Corporate reputation\n\n(j) Business Effectiveness Survey Results\n\n(k) Performance Measure (a) above as compared to various stock market indices; and\n\n(l) Any Performance Measure in (a) through (k) above as compared to the performance of other companies.\n\nIn 2005, the common performance goal for all executives under the ECIP (and also under the CIP for other employees) was operating income (pre-tax run rate). Thirty percent of the target bonus opportunity for all executive officers, with the exception of Mr. Greifeld and David Warren, Nasdaqs chief financial officer, was tied to this goal. The target bonus opportunity for Mr. Greifeld and Mr. Warren that was tied to operating income was 75% and 70%, respectively. The payout for the operating income portion of the target bonus opportunity was 200% because Nasdaqs operating income (pre-tax run rate) for 2005 of $136.4 million exceeded the ceiling of $112.9 million. All executive officers covered by the ECIP (and all of Nasdaqs managers under the CIP) had 10% of their target bonus opportunities tied to the results of the business effectiveness survey. Individual payouts varied for this performance goal based on the results of the survey. In addition, executive officers covered by the ECIP (and other Nasdaq managers under the CIP), other than Mr. Greifeld, had portions of their target bonus\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nopportunities tied to cash flow, expense targets, market share and corporate reputation performance goals, collectively referred to as business unit strategic measures. The remaining 15% of Mr. Greifelds performance goals were tied to Nasdaqs total revenues. Individual payouts for these performance goals also varied.\n\nLong-term Incentives. In 2005, Mr. Greifeld was granted a restricted stock award, pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement as described in more detail below. A restricted stock award was also granted to another executive officer, who is not a named executive officer, in conjunction with her promotion to Executive Vice President. No other stock awards were granted to executive officers in 2005. In November 2004, executive officers, with the exception of Mr. Greifeld, were granted performance accelerated stock options. The PASOs granted were intended to cover 2005 and 2006 (except in the case of promotions or new hires). The Committee does not anticipate considering new stock awards for these executives until late 2006. PASOs are long term options under which the vesting of shares is accelerated or delayed upon the achievement of a certain annual corporate financial performance goal approved by the Nasdaq board. The Committee believes that PASOs encourage long-term employment because the shares cliff vest, meaning that no options may be exercised until all are exercisable. Accordingly, the PASO awards function both as performance-based incentive equity and as an executive retention tool. The performance measurement for this grant was 2005 operating income (pre-tax run rate), which exceeded the ceiling of $112.9 million. Therefore, the PASO awards granted in November 2004 will vest as to 50% on January 15, 2008, and 50% on January 15, 2009.\n\nChange in Control Agreements\n\nPrior to 2005, Nasdaqs executive management team (with the exception of Mr. Greifeld and Mr. Knight, our general counsel) had not entered into any formal agreements with the company defining their financial arrangements in the event of termination resulting from a change in control. In 2005, the board of directors determined that it is in the best interest of Nasdaq and its shareholders that when exploring other business opportunities key executive officers have such agreements in place. We now have change in control agreements with seven of our current executive officers.\n\nThe change in control agreements would provide for enhanced severance benefits if, within one year following a change in control (as defined in the agreements) or in certain situations prior to a change in control, the executive officers employment is terminated for reasons other than for cause or the executive officer terminates their employment for good reason (as defined in the agreements). Benefits under these agreements will be provided only in the limited situation where Nasdaq is the target company. In addition, the executive officers likely would be eligible for a significant amount of these benefits, as determined by the Committee, in the event of termination even in the absence of change in control agreements. The terms of these agreements are discussed in Employment Agreements.\n\nPension Plans\n\nNasdaq provides both tax-qualified and a non-qualified savings and retirement plans. All eligible employees may participate in the tax qualified plans (both pension and savings). Participation by Nasdaq employees in the defined contribution tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan is approximately 96%. Nasdaq matches up to 4% of an employees eligible compensation to this plan during the year and may make an additional discretionary contribution to the plan as approved by the Nasdaq board on the Committees recommendation, which may vary with the financial performance of Nasdaq. No additional discretionary match was made with respect to 2005. In 2005, the Nasdaq board approved the termination of Nasdaqs participation in the NASD Pension Plan and the establishment of the Nasdaq Pension Plan effective as of January 1, 2006.\n\nCurrently, the majority of executive officers participate in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The purpose of this plan is to attract, retain and encourage the productive efforts of a select group of senior executives who render valuable services to Nasdaq that constitute an important contribution toward Nasdaqs continued growth and success. This plan provides supplemental retirement income to executive officers\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nand their beneficiaries. See Pension Plan Tables. There have been no new participants in the SERP since May 2003.\n\nBenefits and Perquisites\n\nIt is Nasdaqs practice to provide benefits and perquisites to executive officers that mirror those offered to other employees. The benefits and perquisites that are available to officers at the level of Senior Vice President and above which are not available to other employees include eligibility to receive basic financial planning services and eligibility for executive health exams. In addition, Mr. Greifeld is also provided with a company car and driver for use when conducting company business. Use of the company car and driver for personal reasons is reported as income to Mr. Greifeld.\n\nCompensation of the CEO and President\n\nFor 2005, Robert Greifeld, President and CEO of Nasdaq, received an annual salary of $790,000 and cash incentive bonus of $3,325,000, which was paid in February 2006. For 2005, Mr. Greifelds employment agreement set his annual salary at $790,000 and a target cash incentive bonus opportunity of $1,750,000, which was not guaranteed and subject to discretionary increase based on performance goals as established by the Committee in March 2005 for the ECIP. As with other executive officers, Mr. Greifelds performance goals were tied to Nasdaqs operating income (75% in the case of Mr. Greifeld), and the annual employee satisfaction index results (10% in the case of Mr. Greifeld). The remaining 15% of Mr. Greifelds performance goals were tied to Nasdaqs total revenue. As noted previously, objective performance goals allow bonus payouts of up to 200% of the target bonus opportunity in the event the actual goal results exceed the targets established. Mr. Greifeld earned $2,625,000 for the operating income portion of his target bonus, $175,000 for the results of the annual employee satisfaction index and $525,000 for the total budgeted revenue, for a total of $3,325,000.\n\nIn accordance with his employment agreement, Mr. Greifeld was awarded 100,000 shares of restricted stock in May 2005 under the Equity Plan, which will vest as follows: 33,000 shares on May 12, 2006, 33,000 shares on May 12, 2007, and 34,000 shares on May 12, 2008.\n\nThe following table provides a concise overview of Mr. Greifelds 2005 total compensation:\n\nValue\n\nSalary\n\n$ 790,000\n\nBonus\n\n$ 3,325,000\n\nLong-Term Compensation Restricted Stock Awards\n\n$ 1,492,000 (1)\n\nOther Compensation\n\n$ 5,362 (2)\n\nPerquisites\n\n$ 17,135 (3)\n\nBenefits\n\n$ 14,936 (4)\n\nTotal 2005 compensation\n\n$ 5,644,433 (5)\n\n(1) Value of the restricted stock awards are based on the grant date fair market value.\n\n(2) Represents Nasdaqs contributions to the 401(k) plan, which is provided to Mr. Greifeld under the same terms as other employees.\n\n(3) Represents the value of perquisites received by Mr. Greifeld without regard to the minimum disclosure thresholds contained in SEC rules.

In the event Mr. Greifelds employment terminates as a result of a non-renewal by Nasdaq, any unvested shares shall vest as of termination. This inducement award is transferable only by the laws of descent and distribution.\n\nPENSION PLAN TABLE\n\nNasdaqs executive officers participate in NASDs qualified plan and Nasdaqs Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Under these plans executive officers earn an aggregate benefit expressed as an annual annuity equal to 6% of their modified career average compensation for each year of service up to a maximum of 10 years. In general, modified career average compensation is the average annual salary plus one-third of the annual bonus (incentive compensation) for the period of service beginning January 1, 2004 and ending on the date of termination. As a transitional rule, prior to January 1, 2009, modified career average earnings will be the average annual salary plus one-third of the annual bonus for the last 60 months of employment. In no event will the modified career average earnings be less than the average annual salary plus one-third of the annual bonus during the highest consecutive 60 month period of employment as of October 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated credited years of service for Mr. Greifeld was 2.67 years, Mr. Concannon was 2.64 years, Ms. Friedman was 12.62 years, Mr. Knight was 6.5 years, and Mr. Warren was 5 years. The following table sets forth the aggregate annual benefit payable at normal retirement date under the plans for various levels of remuneration and years of service.
