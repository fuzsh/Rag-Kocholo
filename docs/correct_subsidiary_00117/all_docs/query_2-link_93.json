        "text": "Product Tour\n\nThe handset’s case is rugged ABS plastic and should survive being dropped better than most consumer cordless handsets. The buttons are rubberized and have a solid feel. In fact, the buttons are nearly flush with the case and require a firm push to accept a key press. Figure 1 shows the 8002’s keys and display.\n\nFigure 1: Polycom SpectraLink 8002 Keys and Display\n\nThe monochrome LCD display is backlit and has good contrast. The phone’s menus are clearly presented and easily understood on the LCD.\n\nThe phone has three settings for microphone sensitivity (Figure 2) in order to compensate for the potential of background noise as might be found in a commercial or industrial setting. In my home office this was not a factor, but it does illustrate the thoughtful design of the phone and attention paid to the target user profile.\n\nFigure 2: Background noise settings"
