I assumed it was a generic wifi based SIP phone.\n\nPost by Michael Graves\n\nI had one under test for several months and it behaved really well on\n\nmy WLAN using a Netgear comsumer N type rouiter/AP with WMM. WMM is\n\nessentially a wireless QoS mechanism. Without it you cannot assure\n\nvoice quality if there's anything else using the WLAN.\n\nGranted, the phone is a bit fiddly to provision. In it's intended\n\ntarget markets that's not a problem. If you want to make free calls\n\nfrom hotspots you're far better of with trashy consumer oriented stuff\n\nthat has a built-in web browser. In many cases you need it to\n\nauthenticate against the hotspot.\n\nThe best option seems to be a SIP client on a dual mode cell phone. But\n\nthen, why use the wifi when you have a cell phone in your hand? Minutes\n\nare cheap in either case.\n\nBecause I still have this dream of having my extension in my hand. I've\n\nhad very poor luck with my iPhone and SIP clients I have tried. The best\n\nI have been able to manage is X-Lite on my laptop, which actually works\n\nvery well. My laptop doesn't fit in my pocket, though, sadly :)\n\nThere does seem to be a market, if small, for a wifi enabled SIP phone\n\nthat maybe isn't a full fledged cell phone. Although I can see how the\n\nPolycom phone might be useful in a wide campus environment where it may\n\nroam among many wifi nodes, that seems a pretty small market segment. For\n\na regular office or building a DECT phone plugged into an ATA seems to be\n\nthe way to go. The Polycom phone, totally against the norm for Polycom\n\nIMO, looks and feels cheap and has funky buttons :)\n\nI actually haven't gotten mine to work at all. Mind pasting the config\n\nthat works for you? Just around the house here I am using DD-WRT on a\n\nLinksys WRT54G, which does support WMM.\n\nCheers,\n\nj"
