        "text": "Hi,\n\nHave a Aruba controller 3200 with AP-105:s, Running a WLAN for Polycom spectralink 8440 wi-fi phones.\n\nI have problems with roaming between AP:s it takes the phone like looooong time before it switch to new AP.\n\nAnd the speech is cut until it recive the new AP...\n\nAny ideas?\n\n#3200\n\nThere are a lot of variables that could be causing this. To start, have you looked at the Optimizing Aruba WLANs for Roaming Devices VRD? There are some specific recommendations for Spectralink 8020/8030, not 8440, but the principals may be the same. Polycom also has a Configuration Guide for Aruba and does cover the 8440.\n\nThanks for the update. Did the guides help? Was there any particular settings that made a difference that you could share for future reference?\n\nIt seems like when the phone is not in an active call it dont roam as it do when its in a call. And i guess maybe thats a power saving mechanism. We also tried to get the all the channels in subband3 only for faster roaming. So 1 step closer i know working on another issue:) but in separate post. Thanks alot for ur support"
