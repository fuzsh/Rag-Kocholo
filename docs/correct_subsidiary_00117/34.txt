Communications equipment maker Polycom Inc. (PLCM) and wireless phone company SpectraLink Corp. (SLNK) said Monday that the U.S. antitrust waiting period has expired for Polycom's $220 million acquisition of SpectraLink.

Polycom's wholly-owned subsidiary, Spyglass Acquisition Corp., last month commenced a tender offer for all outstanding shares of SpectraLink at a price of $11.75 per share.

While the expiration of the antitrust waiting period satisfies one condition of the merger, the tender offer is subject to certain other conditions, including a minimum share tender condition, and other customary conditions.

The tender offer is set to expire on March 20. Following the merger, SpectraLink will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Polycom.

Polycom shares are currently trading at $33.55, up 46 cents or 1.39%, while SpectraLink shares are currently trading at $11.74, up 4 cents.
