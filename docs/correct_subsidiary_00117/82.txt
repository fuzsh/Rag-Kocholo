Solutions

Polycom wireless telephones are used daily by thousands of businesses throughout the globe.

Healthcare – Hospitals and clinics use wireless telephones to streamline communication to quickly respond to patient needs, improving patient satisfaction and overall quality of care. Increases in staff efficiency enable hospitals to address a shortage of trained health workers while improving nurse retention levels. Specialized applications such as Bar Code Medicine Administration also improve patient safety by reducing medical errors.

Retail – Managers and shop floor staff can be mobile, visible, and spend more time in front of customers, offering better customer service with stock, product, or promotional inquiries and responding more quickly to in-store incidents, such as spillages and theft.

Manufacturing – Wireless handsets eliminate paging delays, improve operations and enable faster responses to problems and emergencies, reducing downtime and production slippage. Push-to-Talk (PTT) technology replaces “walkie-talkie” systems with improved functionality.

Hospitality – Workplace wireless systems are an alternative to using expensive cellular phones, enabling organizations to offer a higher level of customer service much more efficiently.
