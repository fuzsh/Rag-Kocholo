        "text": "New statistics on municipally protected nature\n\nThis year’s theme for Statistics Sweden’s report on protected nature is “Municipally protected nature”. Under this theme, the report describes how much protected nature there is in each municipality, and how much protection has been established based on municipal decisions. In connection with this detailed description, Statistics Sweden created new variables for the official statistics on protected nature. This includes statistics on the deciding authority and administrator of protected nature, which from reference year 2020 will be reported with areas, by total and land area, number of areas, and regional reporting by county and municipality. A complete presentation of the statistics is available in Statistics Sweden’s interactive database: www.scb.se/statistikdatabasen.\n\nEach municipality in Sweden contains some type of protected nature, in the form of a national park, nature reserve, nature conservation area, or habitat protection. In the municipalities of Salem and Vaxholm in Stockholm County, and Sorsele in Västerbotten County, more than half of the land area in the municipality is protected.\n\nThe map shows how protected nature is distributed among the municipalities in Sweden and, at the same time, gives a picture of the total size of each municipality. The darker colours indicate a higher proportion of protected nature and the lighter colours indicate a lower proportion. The higher proportions are prevalent in several of the subalpine municipalities, as well as several municipalities located in Stockholm County. In the rest of the country, high percentages of protected land are present in the municipalities of Trosa, Mörbylånga, Götene, and Lund. Among the 290 municipalities in Sweden, there was less than 0.5 percent protected land in 15 of them."
