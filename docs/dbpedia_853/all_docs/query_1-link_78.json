        "text": "Art museums\n\nRenaissance masters, Swedish national romanticism, or modern pioneers. Stockholm's art museums display an eclectic canvas of beautiful art.\n\nStockholm is home to many great art museums. Actually, to visit Stockholm is to visit one giant museum, and everywhere you look there are interesting buildings, from decidedly contemporary to houses that date as far back as the late 13th century.\n\nHere is a selection of attractions where you can enjoy great art.\n\nArchitectureÂ\n\nWith relatively few skyscrapers and many historical buildings preserved, Stockholm has an unusually short skyline for a city of its size. That, of course, doesnât mean that it lacks in architectural beauty.\n\nHistorically, Swedish architects have been very influenced by movements and styles from abroad. But due to its geographical location, these cultural currents have arrived later and by that time evolved into something uniquely Swedish.\n\nHere is a sample of some architectural highlights, both new and old, that Stockholm has to offer.\n\nThe Archipelago\n\nBeautiful nature, great local food, and exciting adventures. Just 20 minutes away from Stockholm a world of 30 000 islands begins.\n\nThe Stockholm Archipelago is the largest of its kind in Sweden. With over 30 000 islands it covers an area of more than 650 square miles; from the city-close FjÃ¤derholmarna Islands in the west to the Svenska HÃ¶garna islets in the east, and from the abandoned fortifications on Arnholma in the north to the lonely lighthouse on Landsort in the south.Â\n\nHere is a list of islands worth a visit."
