        "text": "Quiz – Stockholm districts\n\nHere is a quiz that will help you with basic knowledge about the neighborhoods in Stockholm. Hope it helps you!\n\nGamla Stan / The Old Town\n\nGamla Stan is an area of great contrast. It is Stockholm's oldest settlement with many historical buildings and attractions. But it's also an area known for gastronomic innovation and unique shopping. Gamla Stan, or Old Town, is as the name suggests Stockholm's oldest district. Located on an island in the middle of town, the first Stockholm settlement dates back to the Middle Ages. Most of the buildings are from the 16th and 17th centuries though. The narrow, winding cobblestone streets, with their buildings in different colours, give Gamla Stan its unique character.\n\nVästerlånggatan and Österlånggatan are the district’s main streets, but head off the beaten track to get the true feel of the island. In the middle of Gamla Stan lies Stortorget, Stockholm's oldest square, the central point and from it runs Köpmangatan, Stockholm's oldest street, mentioned as early as the 14th century.\n\nThere are several beautiful museums and historic attractions here. For example, the Royal Palace, The Stockholm Cathedral, The Medieval Museum, The Jewish Museum, The Nobel Prize Museum, and The Royal Armoury.\n\nDid you know:\n\nGamla Stan is one of Europe's largest and best-preserved medieval city centers. It was here that Stockholm was founded in 1252.\n\nThe Royal Palace is one of the world's largest castles with over 600 rooms.\n\nQuiz:\n\n1) Which museums are located in Gamla Stan?\n\n2) What is the name of the large square in Gamla Stan where, among other things, the Nobel Prize Museum is located?\n\nMore Gamla Stan:\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/stockholms-districts/gamla-stan/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/see-do/attractions/district-guide-old-towngamla-stan/\n\nSödermalm\n\nIf you want to get your finger on the pulse of Stockholm's latest trends Södermalm is the place for you. In the early 20th century Södermalm, or just Söder, was a cramped and impoverished part of Stockholm. The contrast to Södermalm of today couldn't be more significant, with its cozy cafés and bars, many restaurants, and trendy boutiques. While Södermalm isn't packed with museums, its close proximity to Gamla Stan makes it an alternative stop if you want to take a short walk to the Stockholm Palace or Nobel Prize Museum. Furthermore, the ferries to Djurgården depart and arrive just a short walk from Slussen. The museums located on Söder are Fotografiska, The City Museum of Stockholm, and Sweden's only remaining silk mill; K.A. Almgren Silk Weaving.\n\nThere are several public parks in Södermalm, like Vita Bergen and Tantolunden, and Årtsaviken in the south is a popular place for Sunday walks. Fjällgatan and Monteliusvägen on the northern side of Södermalm are also popular walking routes, with the added bonus of being fantastic places to experience scenic views of Stockholm. A short walk from Hornstull is the small island of Långholmen, a green oasis and a popular place for a summer swim.\n\nDid you know:\n\nStockholm is built on 14 islands that are connected by 57 bridges.\n\nThe City Museum at Slussen has its premises in a 17th-century palace. Here you can follow Stockholm's development from a medieval port city to today's metropolis.\n\nQuiz:\n\n3) Right next to Hornstull is an islet that has a museum, hotel, hostel, kayak rental and a popular beach. What is the name of this islet?\n\n4) Vitabergsparken is a green oasis on Södermalm. It is a popular place to meet and enjoy the park. How do you get from the City to the Vita Bergen?\n\nMore Södermalm:\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/stockholms-districts/sodermalm/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/see-do/attractions/see-the-sights-of-sodermalm/\n\nKungsholmen\n\nTo say that Stockholm is run from Kungsholmen is no exaggeration; the westernmost district of inner-city Stockholm is the location of one of it's most important and iconic buildings; The City Hall. Kungsholmen is primarily a residential district but it also features great selection of restaurants and cafés.\n\nLots of lively restaurants, bars, and cafés are found especially along Hantverkargatan and Fleminggatan. It's also in this area of the island that you'll find its most prominent buildings, like the Stockholm District Court, the headquarters of the Swedish Police, and the City Archive. The most famous though is the City Hall. Completed in 1923 it's become a defining feature of Stockholm's skyline, as well as a prime example of Swedish Grace architecture. The 106 meters tall (almost 3048 feet) tower offers a great panoramic view of Stockholm and is open to visitors during the summer. The City Hall also hosts the annual Nobel banquet in \"The Blue Hall\". From here you can walk, along the shores och Norr Mälarstrand with a great view of Lake Mälaren and Södermalm on the other side. At the end of this avenue you find Rålambshåvsparken, also called Rålis, with a skatepark, playgrounds, an amphitheater, a basket court, and large open areas perfect for a picnic.\n\nDid you know:\n\nApproximately eight million bricks were used to build the City Hall. The Nobel Banquet is held here.\n\nHornsbergsparken's beach park is a popular bathing spot during the summer months. The park received the Swedish Architects' Sienna Award for its fine outdoor environment.\n\nQuiz:\n\n5) The City Hall with its golden Three Crowns is one of Stockholm's most famous silhouettes. During a guided tour, you can learn all about the architecture, art, and historical events that took place here. Who is the architect that designed the City Hall?\n\n6) Rålambshovsparken on Kungsholmen is a popular activity park. You come here to sunbathe and swim or perhaps to have a picnic with friends. What is the name of the beach next to the park?\n\nMore Kungsholmen:\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/stockholms-districts/kungsholmen/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/see-do/attractions/district-guide-kungsholmen/\n\nÖstermalm\n\nLong synonymous with upscale shopping and fine dining, Östermalm is also a district where you'll find great culture, fascinating museums, and lush inner-city parks. On some of Stockholm's most expensive addresses, you'll find boutiques with the latest collections from international fashion brands and crowded fine-dining restaurants. But the district is also an important cultural hub. Located here are Sweden's national library, Sweden's national stage for theater, and Stockholm's oldest cinema.\n\nThere are several attractions and museums in Östermalm. The Army Museum, The Royal Stables, and The Museum of Performing Arts are all located near central Östermalm. You'll learn about both monetary history and Swedish history at Narvavägen, where The Economic Museum and The Swedish History Museum are located in the same building. In Frihamen harbor Magasin III sets up exhibitions in contemporary art. And in the new residential area of Djurgårdsstaden, you'll find the Stockholm Transport Museum which moved into its new location in 2022. From here, you'll reach the Stockholm Olympic Stadium after a short walk.\n\nDid you know:\n\nThe Stockholm Olympic Stadium was built for the 1912 Olympics and is still used for various events and concerts. But it's also open to the public, for anyone wanting to use it for their daily exercise.\n\nQuiz:\n\n7) A visit to Östermalmshallen is an experience for all the senses. Here you can find all kinds of food.

But, what is the name of the museum in Narvavägen where you can see Sweden's greatest gold and silver treasures in The Gold Room?\n\nMore Östermalm:\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/stockholms-districts/ostermalm/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/see-do/attractions/district-guide-ostermalm/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/eat-drink/nightlife/a-night-out-on-ostermalm/\n\nCity & Norrmalm\n\nNorrmalm has made the transition from a transit place for daily computers to a lively district with vibrant cultural and restaurant scenes. Norrmalm is the hub for public transportation in Stockholm, with both T-Centralen and Stockholm Central Station located here. But there are many reasons to explore the streets surrounding Sergels Torg. Besides important cultural institutions and venues for music, you'll find some of the city's most famous restaurants and bars here.\n\nThe selection of museums in Norrmalm is varied. At the Hallwyl Collection, you'll travel to the early days of the 20th century in the pristinely preserved townhouse apartment equipped with all manner of art and modern utilities. Nationalmuseum has a vast collection (over 700 000 objects) of art, furniture, porcelain, and design. And on the small island of Skeppsholmen you'll be treated to contemporary art and architecture at Moderna Museet and ArkDes, world culture at The Museum of Far-Eastern Antiquities, and childhood memories at The Stockholm Toy Museum.\n\nDid you know:\n\nThe term \"Stockholm Syndrome\" was coined by the criminologist Nils Bekerot after a bank robbery at Norrmarlmstorg in 1973 where the hostages sided with the perpetrators against the police.\n\nQuiz:\n\n9) Several department stores are located in the City, including NK, Åhléns, Gallerian and MOOD.

What is the name of the park where the skating rink and the cherry trees are located?\n\nMore City & Norrmalm:\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/stockholms-districts/norrmalm/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/see-do/attractions/citynorrmalm/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/eat-drink/restaurants/downtown-dinner-restaurants-in-the-city-center/\n\nVasastan\n\nCulture is ever-present in Vasastan. You'll find it at the Public Library of Stockholm, art museums, gaming halls, beloved theatre stages, and cozy cinemas. Stockholm's northernmost district, Vasastan, has a rich cultural scene. But anyone up for an afternoon fika or a great meal has plenty of options as well. In the middle of the district, you'll also find one of Stockholm's most beloved parks, Vasaparken. This green oasis is as popular for a summer picnic as it is for ice skating during the winter holidays.\n\nThere are many smaller restaurants in the area, especially around Odenplan and St. Eriksplan. Rörstrandsgatan, with its small shops and cafes, is a hot tip for those who just want to stroll around. The fine arts can be enjoyed at one of Vasastan's several museums. Bonniers Konsthall, Sven-Harry's Art Museum, Carl Eldh's Studio Museum, and the Strindberg Museum are all located in the district, each offering a distinctive program.

Nowhere in Stockholm will you find a higher concentration of popular attractions and museums. During the 16th century, Djurgården was King Erik XIV's private weekend hideaway for recreation and hunting. Over the course of history though, the island gradually opened up to the public. Today it's a popular family destination with several attractions. Many of Stockholm's oldest and most venerated museums can be found on Djurgården. The Vasa Museum, Skansen Open-air Museum, Nordiska Museet, and Liljevalchs art gallery to name a few. This isn't to say that the development of Djurgården has stagnated, far from it. Spritmuseum & The Absolut Art Collection moved from their inner-city location to their current seaside address on Djurgården in 2012, and a year later ABBA The Museum opened its doors just around the corner. Even more recent additions are The Viking Museum and VRAK - Museum of Wrecks. Further south on the island, you'll also come across two more art museums, Prins Eugen's Waldemarsudde, and The Thiel Gallery.\n\nThe island is also famed for its many family-friendly attractions. Besides Skansen (which hosts a Nordic zoo and two aquariums) you'll find Gröna Lund's Amusement Park and the playful Junibacken. But Djurgården is also the greenest island of them all, part of the National City Park, with vast areas of forest and open spaces.\n\nDid you know:\n\nThere is a visitor’s center located just past the bridge, providing tourist information, canoe, and bike rental.

What is the name of the stop closest to Skansen's main entrance?\n\n14) Two destinations on Djurgården are Rosendals Trädgård and the The National Museum of Science and Technology. Since the summer of 2019, you can walk between these places in just about 10 minutes. This is thanks to a new bridge over Djurgårdsbrunnsviken. What is the name of the bridge?\n\nMore Djurgården:\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/stockholms-districts/djurgarden/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/see-do/attractions/district-guide-djurgarden/\n\nSkärgården / The Stockholm Archipelago\n\nThe Stockholm Archipelago is the largest of its kind in Sweden. It covers an area of more than 650 square miles; from the city-close Fjäderholmarna Islands in the west to the Svenska Högarna islets in the east, and from the abandoned fortifications on Arnholma in the north to the lonely lighthouse on Landsort in the south.\n\nIn Stockholm on a tight schedule? Then Fjäderholmarna, Vaxholm, Gustavsberg, and Värmdö might be up your alley. All are easily accessible by local transportation or ferry, within an hour's reach from downtown Stockholm. Great day trips that don’t require too much preparation, while at the same time offering a sample taste of what the archipelago has to offer. The islands of Sandön, Möja, Nåttarö, Utö, Finnhamn or Grinda, on the other hand, are perfect destinations for explorers who have more time on their hands. They might be a couple of hours away, but offer a welcome respite from the busy inner-city streets of Stockholm. Being further away from the city, a trip might require more careful planning. And if you’re not in a hurry and want to spend a night or two at a cozy hotel or camping site, there are several options.\n\nAll the islands are on regularly scheduled routes by the public transportation company Waxholmsbolaget. If you are pressed for time, the privately-owned Cinderellabåtarna may be better for reaching the outermost Archipelago islands.\n\nDid you know:\n\nStockholm archipelago consists of around 30,000 islands, coves and islets.\n\nQuiz:\n\n15) The idyllic archipelago town of Vaxholm can be visited all year round. There is a large selection of nice restaurants, cozy cafes and nice shops here. How do you get to Vaxholm?\n\n16) Our closest archipelago islands are only a 20-minute boat ride from Stockholm city. During the summer, boats depart regularly to Fjäderholmarna. Where do these boats depart from?\n\nMore Stockholm Archipelago:\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/see-do/excursions/discover-stockholm-archipelago/\n\nwww.visitstockholm.com/see-do/excursions/spend-a-night-or-two-in-the-stockholm-archipelago/\n\nHere you can find all the answers!"
