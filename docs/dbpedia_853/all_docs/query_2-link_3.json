        "text": "Rolling green hills, cascading waterfalls, vibrant cities and charming villages – Scandinavia is the place for nature-filled adventures. Scandinavia is the Northern European region made up of Denmark, Sweden and Norway; with stunning landscapes to explore in each of these countries.\n\nFrom road trips and boat rides through the Baltic Sea, to seeing the Northern Lights and huskies in real life – the list of tourist hot spots to visit is pretty endless! We’ve rounded up some of the most jaw-dropping beautiful places in Scandinavia to visit on your next trip. Which will take top spot?\n\n15. Møns Klint, Denmark\n\nFancy a spot of cold water swimming? You might feel a little more tempted to take a dive into the cerulean waters by Møns Klint when you find out it’s known as the Cold Caribbean. There are so many things to do in this chalky white mountain range. If you’re an avid star gazer, check out the constellations here: this area was Scandinavia’s first official Dark Sky Park. Travellers don’t tend to mention Denmark first when discussing the Nordic countries they’ll visit, but perhaps after more people have visited this beautiful area, things will change!\n\n14. Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden\n\nSaid it once, we’ll say it again: why visit just one island when you could visit an archipelago? In other words, a group of islands clustered around each other. There are over 30,000 mini islands to see in the Stockholm, perfect for a boat ride on the brisk Baltic Sea. It’s impossible to see all these beautiful islands in a day, almost 650 miles covers the region. But if you’re looking for hot spots, check out the Fjäderholmarna Islands in the west, the Svenska Högarna islets and the majestic lighthouse of Landsort.\n\n13. Hardangervidda National Park, Norway\n\nA stunning national park and alpine plateau known for verdant cliffs, plunging falls and wild rivers. Check out the Vøringsfossen waterfall, nearby Måbødalen valley and all of the incredible hiking trails.\n\nAt the western edge of the plateau, you’ll find Trolltunga, the epic rock formation that juts out over Ringedalsvatnet Lake. Think Pride Rock in The Lion King… if Pride Rock sat over pristine blue waters.\n\n12. Geirangerfjord, Norway\n\nKnown as one of the most beautiful places in the world, the breathtaking Geiranger Fjord is in the Sunnmøre region in the south of Norway. The UNESCO-protected region is famous for deep blue waters, lush green mountain plateaus and an abundance of waterfalls. Some of the most popular sights to see in the region are the Ørnesvingen elevated walking platform, Seven Sisters Waterfall and Dalsnibba lookout.\n\n11. Sognefjord, Norway\n\nNicknamed the “King of the Fjords” for its immense size, Sognefjord is the largest and deepest fjord in Norway and is located about a four-hour drive from Geiranger. There’s a lot to explore in the expansive region, in particular, the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Nærøyfjord branch is a must-visit. There’s also the icy blue Jostedalsbreen glacier, Jotunheimen National Park and the Aurlandsdalen hiking trail.\n\nRåbjerg Mile, Denmark\n\nOne of the most unexpected landscapes in Denmark, the Råbjerg Mile is the largest migrating dune in Northern Europe. Each year, the sandy peaks of the 300-year-old dunes move about 15m northeast. The moving sand has covered lakes, forests and more in its time, with one of the coolest sights to see in the region being the church of Saint Lawrence of Rome (AKA the sand-covered church). The church was almost entirely covered by the dunes in the 18th century, with the tower being the only remaining part of the structure. Visit the church or simply head out on a hike along the dunes for a truly unique experience.\n\n9. Bøyabreen Glacier, Norway\n\nIf you’re looking for natural wonders in Norway it doesn’t get much better than the Bøyabreen Glacier, a branch of the larger Jostedalsbreen Glacier in Jostedalsbreen National Park. Pull up for a picnic with seriously scenic views, to sit and marvel at the beauty of this incredible country. Not to mention it’s a pretty epic spot for the ‘gram. Visit this site on the cool new Active Scandinavia Contiki Trip.\n\n8. Nyhavn district in Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nIt’s one of the most recognisable places in Europe, but that doesn’t make the Nyhavn district of Copenhagen any less beautiful when you see it in person! It’s one of those iconic places that lives up to all of your daydreamings. When you walk along the 17th-century waterfront, admiring the colourful buildings and relaxing in the atmospheric entertainment district, you’ll be glad you added it to your bucket list.\n\n7. Gásadalur Village, Denmark\n\nIn the Danish Faroe Islands, the idyllic village of Gásadalur is growing in popularity thanks to the new driving tunnel built in the early 2000s. The region boasts stunning lookouts, the picturesque Múlafossur Waterfall and views of Árnafjall Mountain. There’s a reason this peaceful place regularly makes the “Best Places in Denmark” round-ups, so why not see it for yourself?\n\n6. Kungsleden (The King’s Trail), Sweden\n\nSo, this is more of an activity than a place, but the scenic hiking route simply had to be on this list. The most popular part of the expansive Kungsleden trail is a 105km stretch takes you through lush green valleys, past pristine lakes and streams and up mountain peaks on a journey through Northern Sweden, from Abisko to Nikkaluokta. It’s considered to be one of the most beautiful hiking trails in the world!\n\n5. Abisko National Park, Sweden\n\nA stunning park with vibrant natural wonders? Yes please! Abisko National Park in Swedish Lapland boasts the beautiful Abisko River Canyon, Lake Torneträsk and snow-capped mountain peaks. It’s also one of the best places to see the Northern Lights in Sweden, with its very own Aurora Sky Station in the park. Not to mention there are fun activities like ice fishing, dog sledding and guided hikes to enjoy.\n\nBergen, Norway\n\nAnother city worthy of the ‘most beautiful’ title is Bergen, nestled between mountains and fjords along Norway’s southwest coast. It’s nicknamed the “heart of the fjords” for its proximity to Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord. It’s also surrounded by a whopping seven mountains, with Ulriken and Fløyen noted as two of the most popular to explore.\n\nA proud seaside town, the Fish Market and Bergen Aquarium are two spots worth checking out. However, it’s the UNESCO-protected Bryggen Hanseatic wharf that brings an undeniable charm to the town, being one of the most picturesque sights to see in the country\n\n3. Tromsø, Norway\n\nLet’s be real, if you’re visiting Norway you’re probably crossing all of your fingers and toes that you’ll get to see the Northern Lights AKA Aurora Borealis. The city of Tromsø lies 350km north of the Arctic Circle and, from September to March, is known as one of the best places in the world to watch the lights dance along the sky.\n\nBut if you’re heading to Scandinavia in summer, the town is still worth a spot on your itinerary. See the beautiful sights like the Arctic Cathedral, Polar Museum and Mount Storsteinen cable car. In winter you can see the Northern Lights, but in summer you can marvel at the midnight sun with round-the-clock daylight. Now that’s one way to make the most of every day and night.\n\n2. Fulufjället National Park, Sweden\n\nIn the picturesque province of Dalarna, the Fulufjället National Park is brimming with beautiful natural sights. From the plunging Njupeskär waterfall to the hiking trails through alpine forest, it’s one of the most breathtaking places to see in Sweden. In winter, when the falls freeze over, you can even take part in ice climbing at Njupeskär – which sounds pretty epic to us!\n\n1. Oslo, Norway\n\nOslo\n\nIt’s not often that capital cities seamlessly offer up the old and the new, but in Oslo that’s exactly what you’ll find. The beautiful city showcases history at sights like the Viking Ship Museum, Royal Palace and Akershus Fortress, while more unique sights show off the quirky charm the city is known for:\n\nHolmenkollen Jump Tower\n\nOslo Opera House Frogner Park\n\nEkebergparken\n\nAstrup Fearnley Museum\n\n& much more!"
