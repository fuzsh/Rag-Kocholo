        "text": "The event is a non-profit event organised by the Swedish F18-organisation. The entrance fee covers the race, security boats and staff, accomodation, food etc. during the 4 days of sailing. To get more information about the race, logistics or help to plan your visit to Stockholm, don’t hesitate to Contact the Swedish F18 association.\n\nPreliminary programme\n\nThe raid takes place from the 22nd to the 25th of August 2019. The start and finish line will be outside KSSS in Saltsjöbaden, Stockholm.\n\nWednesday 21st of August:\n\n15.00 until finished: Registration, measurement and safety inspection\n\n19.00 Welcome and briefing\n\nThursday 22nd of August\n\nStart 10.00, 2 legs planned\n\nFriday 23rd of August\n\n2 or 3 legs planned\n\nSaturday 24th of August\n\n2 or 3 legs planned\n\nSunday 25th of August\n\nStart 9.00 AM, 2 legs\n\n~ 16.00 finish in Saltsjöbaden\n\n~ 18.00 Price giving ceremony\n\nThe sailors will sail from the inner, trough the middle, to the outer parts of the archipelago and back. Usually we sail two legs per day, but sometimes there could be three legs in which case there will be an early start.\n\nThe first base camp will be at Lökholmen, Sandhamn. Sandhamn is the sailing metropolis of Stockholm. At the base camp Lökholmen there is a great sauna, good food and party in our own house “Varvet”.\n\nThe second basecamp be at Fejan in the very north of the archipelago. The restaurant burned to the ground in 2015 and that was the last time the raid visited this very classical raid base camp. It has been rebuilt and will host us. Fejan has a old hospital which is turnédatum inte a hostel, a sauna and a jetty where the boats will be in the water at night since there is not enough space on land.\n\nDay three the fleet go back south towards Sandhamn allowing for some interesting route choices including rounding the lighthouse Söderarm, the last outpost towards Ålands Archipelago. The base camp this night will be Lökholmen.\n\nThe fourth day will be going south to a lunch stop before the final sprint towards the finish line in Saltsjöbaden.\n\nThe Stockholm Archipelago Raid 2018 will take place on the 23-26 of August, 4 days of intense sailing. At the base camp: sauna, food and drinks before the next long day of sailing begins. The course will bring sailors to the outer, arcane rocks and skerries where seals, birds and naked rocks will be their only company.\n\nRegistration opens on the 1st of April. Maximum 30 teams will be accepted for logistical and safety reasons.\n\nFilmed at the F18 Raid Worlds 2017, credit to Hamnen.se.\n\nAll winners since the first raid in 2001 can be found in the F18 Hall of Fame.\n\nTuesday was a day of extremes for the sailors. In winds over 20 knots in the open waters of the Baltic Sea they had the time of their lives.\n\nThe racing started 6 AM to be able to make 3 legs during the day. Leg 1 was epic. It took the fleet from Sandhamn to the rocky, beautyful archipelago of Gillöga and all the way out to Svenska Högarna, the remote island with a light house. It was the first time ever an F18 raid has passed this place.\n\nLeg 2 started in increasing winds of 20+ knots and a half wind start. The fleet then set gennaker and was screaming up through Fredlarna before reaching the paradise Rödlöga where the little bakery and café became very busy.\n\nLeg 3 was upwind sailing for the first time in two days. Wind now steady 20 knots all the way to the finish line at base camp 3 Nässlingen.\n\nSee the video from this epic day.\n\nAfter a morning with good winds the fleet had lunch-stop at Mörtö-Bunsö, refueling for the afternoon. The wind direction offered a up-wind leg and the local weather systems gave all sorts of conditions. Ranging from medium winds and grey clouds to 20 knots of wind and really harsh weather to a sunny finish by our base camp at Rånö.\n\nWilliam Sunnucks and Freddie White are leading after day one:\n\nSunnucks: “The first thing on my mind now…. I’m cold!!! I should have been in the sauna like everyone else. Today was great racing. We started in almost no wind. This quickly developed into fast reaching conditions with showers coming through. We enjoyed a 7 mile beat with solid wind nd up to 30 degree shifts, with multiple routes through the islands. You think you are going well, and suddenly someone appears miles ahead having found a better route. We were the same speed as everyone else in open water, but our EDGE seems to accelerate very well in the shifty conditions in between the islands. ”\n\nThe second race finished with a close battle with Lars Linder/Eric Brunnberg and Leff Dahl/Roger Boden, all finishing within a minute after almost 3 hours of racing."
