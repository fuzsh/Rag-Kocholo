        "text": "Fires legend\n\nDOPA Explorer is the Joint Research Centre’s web based information system on the world's protected areas, which helps the European Commission and other users to assess the state of and the pressure on protected areas at multiple scales.Active fires are located on the basis of the so-called thermal anomalies produced by them. The algorithms compare the temperature of a potential fire with the temperature of the land cover around it; if the difference in temperature is above a given threshold, the potential fire is confirmed as an active fire or \"hot spot.\" Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS) uses the active fire detections provided by the NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System).\n\nLast 1 Day\n\nLast 7 Days\n\nLast 30 Days\n\nLast 90 Days\n\nDrought legend\n\nRisk of Drought Impact\n\nThe indicator shows the risk of having impacts from a drought, by taking into account the exposure and socio-economic vulnerability of the area, with particular focus on the agricultural impacts. Formerly known as Likelihood of Drought Impact (LDI), it differs from the latter in that soil moisture anomaly is now included and updated every ten days (dekad).\n\nLow\n\nMedium\n\nHigh\n\nSee also the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) of last month.\n\n-2.5\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nSea Surface Temperature Anomaly legend\n\nThe NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) twice-weekly 50-km Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Anomaly product displays the difference between today's SST and the long-term average. The scale goes from -5 to +5 °C. Positive numbers mean the temperature is warmer than average; negative means cooler than average.

In other words, NOAA add up the Coral Bleaching HotSpot values whenever the temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold.

This product captures both the intra and inter-annual variability and changes. The occurrence is a measurement of the water presence frequency (expressed as a percentage of the available observations over time actually identified as water). The provided occurrence accommodates for variations in data acquisition over time (i.e. temporal deepness and frequency density of the satellite observations) in order to provide a consistent characterization of the water dynamic over time.\n\nWater Occurrence Change Intensity (1984-1999 to 2000-2018)\n\nDecrease\n\nNo Change\n\nIncrease\n\nThe Water Occurrence Change Intensity product shows where surface water occurrence increased, decreased or remained invariant between 1984 and 2018. Both the direction of change (i.e. increase, decrease or no change) and its intensity are documented. The occurrence change accommodates for variations in data acquisition over time (i.e. temporal deepness and frequency density of the satellite observations) in order to provide a consistent occurrence change measurement.\n\nWorking poor at PPP$3.10 a day (% of total employment)\n\n0 -10 %\n\n10 -25 %\n\n25 -50 %\n\n50 -75 %\n\nmore than 75 %\n\nProportion of employed people who live on less than $3.10 (in purchasing power parity terms) a day, expressed as a percentage of the total employed population ages 15 and older.
