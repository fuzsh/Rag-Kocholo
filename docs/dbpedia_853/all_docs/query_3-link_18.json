        "text": "Considering that the city stretches over 14 islands in the Baltic Sea and has more than 50 bridges, one understands the nickname \"Venice of the North\": again and again the view sweeps over the water.\n\nDue to its location in the north and on Sweden's east coast, Stockholm goes through four distinct seasons. In summer, it's warm - sometimes even hot - and only gets dark for a short time at night. Winters vary from mild and rainy to icy and snowy. In the fall, the city parks change color spectacularly for a few weeks, and the locals welcome spring by wrapping themselves in blankets and enjoying a drink in outdoor restaurants and cafes.\n\nSpread out over several islands, the city's neighborhoods each have their own distinct character. The heart is the old town island of Gamla Stan, with its castle, crooked streets and centuries-old buildings in red and orange. North of it is the modern downtown area of Norrmalm, known as \"City\" for short, with stores, offices and trendy restaurants. The southern island of Södermalm is the complete opposite: Stockholm's creative scene clusters here, especially in the cult district of SoFo. And the time-honored Östermalm district is an elegant sight with its city palaces and promenades.\n\nStockholm is also a forward-thinking city with countless start-ups and a growing community for technical innovations. Only Silicon Valley can match the density of up-and-coming companies. The Swedish capital has spawned many innovations of international significance, including the streaming service Spotify, which is still headquartered in Stockholm.\n\nSweden is internationally known for its creativity, especially in music, fashion and design. Stockholm's attractions therefore include its many design stores, where you'll find classic furniture by renowned designers, as well as ceramics and textiles by up-and-coming artisans. Design fans should first visit the legendary stores Svenskt Tenn and Malmstenbutiken in Stockholm. How convenient that they are right next to each other, namely on the magnificent Strandvägen.\n\nOn the shopping mile Drottninggatan in the center of Stockholm you can find the latest fashion trends. In addition to department stores and well-known brands, there are also outlets of Swedish labels and surprisingly well-stocked second-hand stores. Between the stores there are plenty of cafés and restaurants where you can leave your shopping bags and recharge your batteries.\n\nStockholm offers a wealth of art and culture: interactive museums, magnificent castles, small galleries, and personal artists' homes.\n\nThe National Museum displays an impressive art collection of sculptures, paintings and design from the last four centuries. The imposing building, located across the street from the castle, is worth seeing in itself. It was designed by German architect Friedrich August Stüler and completed in 1866. It only reopened in 2018 after five years of renovation, and since then has counted among its charms an atmospheric courtyard with sculptures and a stylish restaurant, in addition to the well-structured exhibition.\n\nMuch smaller and more personal, but no less appealing, is the Hallwylska Museum: the 19th-century town palace of the Count and Countess von Hallwyl. Throughout her life, Countess Wilhelmina amassed an extensive, slightly eccentric collection of art, furniture, jewelry and much more. She herself wanted to turn the house into a museum to preserve a fragment of her era for posterity, and the result is an impressive turn-of-the-century time capsule.\n\nOn the small island of Skeppsholmen lies a highlight for fans of modern art, design and architecture: the Moderna Museet and ArkDes complex, to which admission is free.\n\nIf your time budget only allows for a short excursion into nature, take the streetcar to the island of Djurgården in Stockholm: After a few minutes, you'll find yourself in the world's first national city park! Around the island, a walking and biking path leads along the water, past centuries-old oaks. You might spot deer, rabbits, and specimens of the many bird species that make their home here, reminding you that Djurgården was once the king's hunting ground.\n\nIn the west of the island, well-known Stockholm attractions are close together: the Gröna Lund amusement park, the Nordic Museum, Rosendal Castle and Skansen, the oldest open-air museum in the world. The culinary offer on Djurgården is just as great. The inns Ulla Winbladh, Villa Godthem and Rosendal's Trädgårdscafé offer excellent Swedish dishes. Satisfy your appetite for a sweet fika or snack at Café Flickorna Helin, housed in an original building called Skånska Gruvan, built in 1897 for an art and industry exhibition. Some of the attractions also have pretty bistros, such as the former Prince's Kitchen in Waldemarsudde Castle or the Thielska Galleriet café with tables in the garden.\n\nStockholm is a hip destination for foodies because of the variety of chefs, Nordic cooking traditions and concern for the well-being of the environment. Visit both an eatery with a long tradition and a freshly opened restaurant to experience the spectrum of Stockholm's foodie world.\n\nAs recently as 2020, top chef Sayan Isaksson has opened Restaurant Isaan', in the storied downtown eatery Berns Salonger. There, he whips up high-quality Thai dishes using mostly organic Nordic ingredients.\n\nIf you want to try classic Swedish home cooking (\"husman\"), a visit to Bakfickan restaurant, located on the first floor of the Opera House, is a good idea. The meatballs in cream sauce with mashed potatoes, lingonberries and sour cucumber are a Swedish classic. With only 28 seats, Bakfickan is a cozy - and far less expensive - alternative to its Michelin-starred neighbor Operakällaren.\n\nGotland, Sweden's largest island, is a dream destination in the Baltic Sea thanks to sandy beaches, limestone cliffs, mysterious rock formations and culinary specialties. The capital Visby experienced its heyday in the Middle Ages and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its historic city center. The neighboring island of Fårö is also worth a visit.\n\nIn Gotland's capital Visby, it seems as if time has stood still. The crooked cobblestone streets are lined with colorful little houses, church ruins are part of the cityscape and medieval buildings on every corner remind us of the town's long history.\n\nThe town center as we see it today was laid out in the Middle Ages and features many buildings from the 13th century, including a 3.5-kilometer-long town wall (Ringmuren) with towers and gates. From the 12th to the 14th century Visby was the most important Hanseatic base in the Baltic Sea. In 1995 Visby was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List for being the best preserved fortified trading town in Northern Europe.\n\nThe Middle Ages can still be felt in many places throughout Gotland. For example, there are 92 churches on the island dating from the 12th to 15th centuries. And every year in August, the Medieval Week attracts 40,000 fans of jousting, lute music, casual linen fashions and quaint markets to Gotland.\n\nThe limestone columns called Rauken or Raukar, which are over ten meters high, are a special sight. You'll find them on the aptly named stone coast (Stenkusten) in the north of Gotland, as well as on the neighboring islands of Fårö and Lilla Karlsö.\n\nFor a truly wild nature experience, visit Gotska Sandön National Park - a small paradise island about 40 km north of Gotland. There you will find high dunes, rustic forests and a kilometer-long beach. Ferries leave from Fårösund as well as from Nynäshamn near Stockholm (late May to mid-September) and must be booked in advance. Both day trips and overnight visits lasting several days are possible.\n\nMeat eaters should take the opportunity to try local lamb on Gotland. Even the Vikings bred sheep on the island, and to this day the horned Good sheep and the gray Gotland sheep are the fluffy symbols of the island. Even the Gotland flag shows a sheep in a proud pose. The meat is known for its pleasant texture and aroma. The high-quality wool is processed into sweaters, socks and household products - classic souvenirs from Gotland.\n\nAnd would you have thought that you can even find truffles on Gotland? The Gotland truffle is harvested in autumn and celebrated every year in November with a three-day food festival. You can go truffle hunting, browse markets and participate in workshops with truffle experts. In addition, some restaurants serve exclusive menus with truffles in every single course.\n\nDue to a long fishing tradition, Gotland also serves seafood of all kinds. In addition, wild garlic and asparagus in white, green and purple thrive on the Baltic Sea island.\n\nThirst quenching beverages bear witness to a distinctive brewing culture. For centuries, the beer called \"Gotlandgetränk\" (Gotlandsdricka) has been brewed on Gotland - a smoky-sweet ale with juniper flavor.\n\nContemporary craft beer is also produced in many places on Gotland. The established brewery Gotlands Bryggeri supplies the island's bars and restaurants with all kinds of varieties. There are also several microbreweries, for example Barlingbo with its associated restaurant Bryggeriet Mat & Malt, Hop Shed Brewery with Brewpub on weekends, and Snausarve Gårdsbryggeri.\n\nA tip among the many high-quality restaurants on Gotland is Lilla Bjers, located 7 km south of Visby. Vegetables come from the restaurant's own organic farm, while meat and dairy products are sourced from small producers on the island. On the menu, you'll find typical Gothic flavors like truffle and saffron with a modern twist. Whether it's a quick lunch or a five-course dinner: Don't miss this light-filled eatery in a glass house. To drink, there's wine and beer from the region. The hops for the craft beer \"Liten Bjers\" come from the Lilla Bjers farm and are refined by the Barlingbo brewery in Visby.\n\nThe upscale restaurant Tuppens Krog (\"To the Rooster\") in Visby is housed in an 18th-century wooden house. Workers used to live in such houses. The atmosphere in this historic setting is warm and inviting. The kitchen uses products from Gotland and the rest of Sweden to create small culinary works of art. If you just want to drop in for a glass of wine or beer, you'll find a spot in the cozy bar area.\n\nGothenburg is located on Sweden's west coast and scores with a city pulse in the center and nature on the doorstep. Visitors are struck by how friendly the locals are. No wonder, really - living in such an appealing city right by the sea should make anyone cheerful.\n\nYou want to know what the weather and climate are like in Gothenburg? Be prepared for four distinct seasons, each with its own special charm. Thanks to its southern location (for Scandinavia), Gothenburg has a mild climate. The warmth of the Gulf Stream ensures that temperatures rarely drop below -3 °C in February. The average temperature in July is +21 °C.\n\nWith just under 600,000 inhabitants, Gothenburg is a relatively small city by international standards, yet it offers all the ingredients for a successful city break: Culture, museums, shopping and first-class restaurants - all within walking distance and close together. On top of that, there's breathtaking nature: archipelagos off the coast, green inland and hiking trails right through the city.\n\nGothenburg's city center is compact, which locals take advantage of for walking and biking. The Haga neighborhood is a highlight, with quiet cobblestone streets lined with independent stores and cozy cafes. Once laid out in the 17th century, the Haga district was Gothenburg's first suburb, south of the Old Town, which was demarcated by a moat. Because Gothenburg has grown considerably since then, Haga has long been part of the city core and can be combined with sightseeing in the rest of the city by strolling along leafy Vasagatan or through Kungsparken. Look for the many well-preserved wooden houses built as workers' housing between 1870 and 1940.\n\nAt the well-known Café Husaren on Haga Nygata, Haga's main street, stop for a \"fika,\" or typical Swedish coffee break with sweet pastries. A specialty of the house is the photogenic hagabulle: a plate-sized cinnamon bun, probably the largest in the world. The record-breaking pastry will give you the energy you need for the rest of your city walk. Climb the hill Risåsberget with the 1639 fortification Skansen Kronan. From up there, you'll have a good view of the city from a height of about 50 meters.\n\nAnother popular destination for locals and visitors alike is Slottsskogen (\"Castle Forest\") Park: an expansive green space that combines natural forest with manicured parkland. If you're in Gothenburg in late May or early June, you should walk through the azalea valley, which is then in full bloom. Slottsskogen is a place for relaxation, but also a popular venue for festivals. The three-day music festival Way Out West attracts around 30,000 music fans to the green space every August.\n\nTwo kilometers southeast of the city center is the Liseberg amusement park, which opened in 1923 and is the largest in Northern Europe. It is known for its roller coasters, but also has gentler rides for the whole family. In the summer, the \"Live Liseberg\" concert season takes place, with Swedish and international pop stars performing outdoors. In past years, Snoop Dogg, the Rolling Stones and ABBA, among others, have played at Liseberg Amusement Park.\n\nThe Bohuslän archipelago, with over 8,000 islands and rocks, is the ideal destination for a day trip. In summer, locals flock to the granite islands, which are great for sunbathing and picnicking. Active vacationers can bike, hike through the barren nature, join guided fishing trips or refresh themselves by jumping into the sea.\n\nFor fans of fish and seafood, the Feskekörka fish market is the first place to go. Usually. That's because Feskekörka is currently closed for renovations. It is scheduled to reopen in 2023. In the meantime, you'll find vendors and bistros in the Saluhall Briggen (Nordhemsgatan 28) and Stora Saluhallen market halls on Kungstorget Square. The \"Fish Church\" was never a real church, even though it looks like a Gothic place of worship: Here, since its opening in 1874, the treasures of the sea alone have been worshipped. You can shop at the market stalls and eat at the on-site bistros.\n\nGothenburg is considered one of the world's leading destinations for fans of craft beer, as western Sweden is home to many breweries and new names continue to establish themselves. Every spring, Gothenburg hosts one of the largest beer and whisky festivals in the world: GBG Beer Week. A whole week of tastings, workshops and presentations of new varieties makes beer fans happy.\n\nWith Gothenburg as your base, you can expect a diverse adventure with urban city life, good food and local beer to taste. And all this in close proximity to nature and the sea.\n\nEndless forests, impressive mountain ranges, pristine lakes with crystal clear water, a primitive people who still live from reindeer herding and deserted landscapes where bears, wolverines and arctic foxes are at home - the north of Sweden is not without reason also called the last true wilderness of Europe.\n\nThe imposing nature is particularly evident in the area of the UNESCO World Heritage Laponia. The 9400 km² territory includes several national parks and nature reserves. During the winter months, northern Sweden is snowy and freezing cold. Tours by husky team, snowmobile or reindeer sled are popular outdoor experiences when the Arctic Circle region disappears under a thick blanket of snow. In summer, adventurers come for wilderness trekking and active vacationers hike the famous \"Kungsleden\" royal trail. Ice and tree house hotels offer exceptional accommodation.\n\nAbove all, it is the Northern Lights that attract Scandinavians and visitors from all corners of the globe to Swedish Lapland. The Aurora Sky Station in Abisko is considered one of the best places in the world to experience this show of lights orchestrated by nature. The solar winds responsible for it hit the Earth's atmosphere all year round, but you can only see the spectacle when it gets dark at night - that is, from August/September to April. In May, the northern lights give way to the midnight sun - the nearly three months until mid-July when the sun shines around the clock above the Arctic Circle.\n\nTake advantage of these endless days to explore the varied landscape of Swedish Lapland, either on your own or on guided excursions. The Essense of Lapland company, led by food artist and guide Eva Gunnare, offers educational hikes through swamps, forests and mountains around the town of Jokkmokk. The nearest airport - Lapland Airport - is about 100 km away in Gällivare.\n\nLapland makes up the largest part of northern Sweden. This is the home of the Sámi people. The indigenous people of northern Scandinavia divide the year into eight periods, which are determined by the rhythm of life of the reindeer. The settlement area of the indigenous people also extends to areas in Norway, Finland and Russia. The historical province of Swedish Lapland is divided into the counties of Västerbotten and Norrbotten. Sweden's northernmost point is Treriksröset, the border triangle between Norway, Finland and Sweden. The Skanden mountains run along the border with Norway. The highest Swedish mountain of the Scandinavian mountains is Kebnekaise with 2,111 meters.\n\nDeep inland, at the height of Luleå and Arvidsjaur, on a lake lies Geunja Sami Eco Lodge, which offers typical Sami cuisine and accommodations. The Vinka family introduces guests to Sami lifestyle and customs, with nature and reindeer playing a central role. Traditional dishes like reindeer stew and chanterelle soup are prepared over an open fire, and you'll sleep in either a grassy wooden cabin or a traditional goathie hut. Depending on the season, soft adventures such as boat trips, hikes on reindeer trails, wildlife safaris and ice fishing are offered.\n\nWith thousands of streams and lakes and 1,500 km of coastline, the region is also an angler's dream. In addition, there are four protected national rivers that have not been regulated for hydropower use: Torne and Pite Älv, as well as Kalix- and Vindelälven. The Torne is one of the most salmon-rich watercourses in the world: up to 100,000 fish find their way to their spawning grounds in it every summer. Pike, trout and various white fish also bite in Swedish Lapland.\n\nSwedish Lapland may be sparsely populated, but you'll still find upscale restaurants that artfully and lovingly bring the flavors of the region to your plate. Veranda, part of the Icehotel, conjures up a twelve-course tasting menu. In Luleå, the CG restaurant serves mostly grilled meats, but also fish, seafood, and the famous calix roe on crispy buttered toast. The remote Huuva Hideaway in the village of Liehittäjä invites its guests to join in the outdoor cooking at the table of \"Sweden - A Country Becomes Restaurant\" - either Nordic-modern or traditional à la Sami.\n\nSweden's fourth largest city in terms of population after Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, Uppsala also covers the central area of the historic province of Uppland.\n\nUppsala, a city of 230,000 people is like the Heidelberg or Cambridge of Sweden: a respected university town with a long history. Students from all over Sweden - and the rest of the world - make up nearly a fifth of the population, giving it a youthful, international feel.\n\nIn east-central Sweden, Uppsala is excellently connected to Stockholm, a good 70 km away, by a regularly scheduled regional train. Uppsala can also be easily reached by car via the former European road and now the E4 freeway from Stockholm to Gävle.\n\nStockholm-Arlanda International Airport is located about 37 km from Uppsala. To get around Uppsala cheaply and quickly, you can use a bicycle. If you don't have your own bike, you can choose from a variety of rental stations. There is a rental station on Kunsgatan right near the main train station.\n\nUppsala has a long tradition as a university city. As early as 1477, the second university in Scandinavia and equally the first in Sweden was founded in Uppsala. The natural scientist Carl von Linné, who died in Uppsala in 1778, became professor of medicine there in 1741 and later still of botany and natural history. His name remains unforgotten, because he had created a uniform biological technical language. Alfred Nobel was awarded an honorary doctorate from Uppsala University in 1893.\n\nIn addition, the city has had a bishop's see since 1273. Soon after the conferment, the city got its present name. Before that it was called Östra Aros and even earlier just Aros. The name Aros translated into German meant river mouth, which was related to the fact that the Fyrisån, which flows through the city, emptied into a fjord, which in earlier times flowed into the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe climate in Uppsala is continental. Summers are rather short but intense, and winters are usually cold and long.\n\nThe city of Uppsala offers you a large number of sights. For example, the Gothic-style Cathedral Church, consecrated in 1435, is considered the largest church in Scandinavia. In the impressive church, which was destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century and rebuilt, you can find the graves of famous Swedish personalities, including those of Gustav Vasa and the already mentioned Carl von Linné.\n\nThe botanical garden created by Linné was the first botanical garden in Sweden and its detailed replica is still popular in Uppsala today. A castle residence towers over the city, there's a Viking museum to marvel at, and north of the city center, in Gamla Uppsala, you can visit royal burial mounds from the 6th century and the ruins of a 12th-century cathedral. Other interesting sights in and around Uppsala University include its Carolina Rediviva library, the coin cabinet, a university museum, and a university auditorium.\n\nAs a university city, Uppsala attracts young people. A special feature are the so-called nations, which do not resemble German student fraternities, but do have similarities. Within such a nation, students can live cheaply and take advantage of recreational opportunities. To visit other nations, they need a guest card.\n\nThose traveling to Uppsala in the spring should not miss the Valborg, or Swedish Walpurgis Night, on April 30 and May 1. Among other things, a fleet race is held on the Fyrisån River and concerts are traditionally held in Ekonomikum Park.\n\nYou can shop well in Uppsala, with most of it within easy walking distance. There are delightful little stores in the cultural-historical district and many more shopping opportunities in the two pedestrian streets Svartbäcksgatan and Kungsängsgatan, as well as the lively Drottningsgatan.\n\nIn Uppsala you will find a variety of restaurants with Swedish and international cuisine as well as nice cafes and bars. If you are looking for high-quality dining, you can refer to the entries in the Swedish Michelin Guide, the so-called \"White Guide\". In 2015, a total of eight restaurants from Uppsala were listed here.\n\nThe Stockholm Archipelago is nowhere else to be found in its size in Sweden. It stretches over 30 000 islands with an area of more than 650 square miles; from the city-close Fjäderholmarna Islands in the west to the Svenska Högarna islets in the east, and from the abandoned fortifications on Arnholma in the north to the lonely lighthouse on Landsort in the south.\n\nThere’s certainly something to discover for everyone in this really big area; serene nature seemingly untouched by civilization, cozy and accessible camping grounds, idyllic villages and coastal towns, hiking trails for both experienced and amateur outdoorsmen, great food, and fascinating culture. An of corse water, a lot of water.\n\nOf corse you ask yourself where to begin. Well, therefore it´s most important to know how much time you have for an archipelago excursion.\n\nVery tight scheduled your trip to Stockholm? Then Fjäderholmarna, Vaxholm, Gustavsberg, and Värmdö might be up your alley. W ithin an hour's reach from downtown Stockholm, all are easily accessible by local transportation or ferry. Great day trips that don’t require too much preparation, while at the same time offering a sample taste of what the archipelago has to offer.\n\nThe islands of Sandön, Möja, Nåttarö, Utö, Finnhamn or Grinda, on the other hand, are perfect destinations for explorers who have more time on their hands. It might be a trip lasting a couple of hours only to get there, but it offers a welcome respite from the busy city streets of Stockholm. Being further away from the city, a trip might require more careful planning.\n\nIsland hopping, a scenic cruise or a longer stay on your favourite island? But how to even get there at first.\n\nMost locals take the Waxholmsbolaget ferries to the islands. Waxholmsbolaget runs regular boat and ferry services across the entire region, from Arholma island in the north to Landsort, on Öja island in the south. The services are a part of the public transport system in Stockholm County and run all year round. During high season in the summer, there are several daily departures from Strömkajen in the city center, as well as departures from ports in other parts of the county.\n\nTo plan your trip, use the company’s journey planner. It’s unfortunately only available in Swedish but it's fairly easy to use if you know the names of the jetties or islands you want to travel between.\n\nThere are other ways to travel to and within the archipelago, too. Strömma Kanalbolaget is another ferry company trafficking the area. Their focus is on cruises, activities and sightseeing tours; it’s a great choice for organized day trips and excursions in the archipelago and on lake Mälaren. You can also charter boats for your own events.\n\nShould you want to make shorter trips between islands or need transportation outside the ferry companies’ service area, a taxi boat is a great option, especially if you’re a larger group traveling.\n\nThanks to bridges, tunnels and car ferries, some areas in the archipelago, such as Yxlan, Vaxholm and Muskö, can also be reached by bus or car. Most islands are however car free. The best and most enjoyable way to get around is by foot or bicycle, which can be rented on most of the main islands.\n\nYstad now enjoys worldwide fame thanks to the novel character Inspector Wallander. And the town, with its medieval, pastel-colored wooden houses, cobbled streets and sunny market squares, really is just as attractive as it is shown in the movies and TV series.\n\nYstad directly enchanted us with cobblestone streets, medieval half-timbering and small-town idyll. And if that wasn't pretty enough, the pretty houses also seemed to be in a contest for the most beautiful rose planting. We couldn't pick a winner, but the chic plants definitely sweetened our exploration tour.\n\nYstad is located in Österlen, in the southeast of Skåne (Scania). Fishing families settled here as early as the 12th century and the settlement grew into today's town. The long history is reflected in the many old buildings. Very present is the church of St. Mary. Like the monastery, it was built in the 13th century. Countless buildings from the following centuries have also been preserved. Among them are about 300 half-timbered houses.\n\nThe old town is surrounded by the streets Kyrkogårdsgatan, Blekegatan, Jennygatan and Sjömansgatan. The latter merges into Österleden at the train station and ferry port, which leads out of town to the beaches. A leisurely walk around the city begins, for example, at the corner of Sjömansgatan / Stora Västergatan. You follow the dense rows of houses to Långgatan and then turn right into Fjädergränd alley. At Skansgatan, the tour takes you past the Ystad Theater. It dates back to the Baroque period and has stage machinery with moving sets. So it's worth buying tickets for the current program to experience this attraction up close.\n\nThe beauty of the town, its convenient location in the south of Sweden and the success of Henning Mankell's Wallander books make Ystad attractive to tourists. Especially Germans seem to be drawn here, because in the streets we hear as much German as Swedish.\n\nIf you stop by the tourist information office in Ystad, which we highly recommend you do, they'll be happy to tell you about the \"In the Footsteps of Inspector Wallander\" tour and themed guided walks where you can try to solve some of Wallander's cases. The city has a fascinating history, interesting museums and art galleries, 40 km of sandy beaches and the fantastic hilly landscape of Skåne province right on your doorstep. Some coastal cities just have it all.\n\nIf you take one of the Wallander guided tours, you'll also get to know most of the city and its historical sights at the same time. If not: the most important ones are St. Knuts Square, the 12th century Franciscan monastery and St. Peter's church and museum next to it. There are many good cafes and restaurants in Ystad, and no, you don't have to subsist on pizza and hamburgers like Commissioner Wallander.\n\nYstad is part of the scenic Skåne region in southern Sweden and is the perfect base to experience culture, traditions, historical sites and vibrant towns and nature.\n\nThe coastal city of Malmö in the southern Swedish region of Skåne offers an exciting mix of historical charm and urban pulse. Here you'll find sights, activities and, not least, culinary delights to suit all tastes.\n\nMalmö is located on Sweden's southern tip opposite Copenhagen in Denmark and is the country's third largest city after Stockholm and Gothenburg. Modern, diverse, delicious: Malmö is one of Scandinavia's most diverse cities. Skyscrapers tower over centuries-old squares, and nondescript brick facades house art treasures with modern and classical works. This incredible city will capture your heart and make you want to come back.\n\nMalmö was founded in the late 12th century and originally belonged to Denmark. It wasn't until 1658 that the city became Swedish. With around 344,000 inhabitants from over 170 countries, Malmö is a melting pot of cultures and flavors.\n\nThe weather in Malmö, the capital of the southern Swedish province of Skåne, is somewhat milder than in the rest of the country. Its location by the sea means it sometimes gets windy, but generally summers are warm and winters no colder than in central Europe.\n\nWalking through the cobblestone streets of the Old Town (Gamla Staden), you'll feel like you've stepped back in time. But the trendy boutiques, stylish cafes and galleries of bold contemporary art quickly bring you back to the here and now.\n\nThe old town occupies an island in the heart of the city, divided into two parts: the Gamla Väster district in the west, with historic buildings, and the Carolikvarteren district in the east, which was modernized in the 1960s. The historic center is the \"big square\" Stortorget, the oldest and largest square in Malmö, surrounded by well-preserved architecture from the 16th century. With many restaurants, hotels and stores, Stortorget remains a lively center.\n\nA stone's throw from here is Malmö's oldest building: the Church of Saint Peter. This 14th-century church is a prime example of Baltic brick Gothic, the style once common to the Hanseatic cities. The vaults are decorated with paintings from the late Middle Ages, which are among the most beautiful of their time in Scandinavia.\n\nTo the south, the \"little square\" adjoins Stortorget: Lilla Torg, with its quaint restaurants, bars and cafés, has been a popular meeting place for locals and visitors for over 500 years. In keeping with Malmö's identity as a city of contrasts, the Form/Design Center is located at Lilla Torg. Behind the historic facade of an old tenement building is a museum of modern art, design and architecture with a café and a beautiful courtyard.\n\nAn equally popular attraction in Malmö is Malmöhus Castle, which occupies the western tip of the Old Town Island. Surrounded by a medieval moat, this fortress was built in the mid-16th century, making it the oldest surviving Renaissance-style castle complex in Scandinavia. Take in the sober red-brick fortress, and inside, explore the municipal museum, aquarium, natural history museum, and art exhibits - all with a single ticket.\n\nOther tips for culture buffs include the Museum of Modern Art (Moderna Museet, an offshoot of the Stockholm museum of the same name) and Malmö Konsthall, one of the largest contemporary art exhibition spaces in Europe. Or maybe a performance at the Malmö Opera fits your agenda?\n\nOn a sunny day, take a foray to Malmö's architectural landmarks, where the ingenuity of Scandinavian designers and architects manifests itself. The Øresund Bridge has connected Malmö with the Danish capital Copenhagen since 2000 and carries both cars and trains. The Swedish-Danish television series \"The Bridge\" has made the structure over the Öresund strait world famous. At eight kilometers long, it is the longest bridge of its kind in Europe. During the ten-minute crossing to Copenhagen, you cross the island of Pepparholm and then enter the four-kilometer-long Drogden Tunnel, which leads underwater to the suburban island of Amager. The total distance is 16 kilometers and many employees commute daily between the two countries.\n\nAnother feat of modern engineering and construction technology is the Turning Torso skyscraper. At 190 meters and 54 floors, it is currently the tallest building in Scandinavia, although several buildings are currently under construction that will sooner or later surpass it, most notably the 245-meter-high Karlatornet in Gothenburg. Record or not, the \"twisted torso\" always offers a spectacular sight thanks to its dynamic shape. This neo-futuristic narrow tower is located in the equally modern Västra Hamnen (Westhafen), which sees itself as a sustainable urban hub and is powered entirely by wind energy, solar energy and biogas. Take the opportunity for a snapshot of the Turning Torso before diving into the hip neighborhood with its individual stores, restaurants and cafés.\n\nMarstrand is without a doubt Sweden's sailing capital and attracts the world's best sailors and a huge audience to spectacular competitions every year. Much here revolves around sailing and boats. Accordingly, the boats in the guest harbor - the largest of its kind in Sweden - lie close together. If you want to take a spin on the sea yourself, there are various boat tours on offer - a tour around the island, out into the archipelago, to a seal colony or how about a kayak tour? You can also take a sailing course here.\n\nHowever, not everything on Marstrand is about sailing. The island is just as suitable for day trips with a leisurely stroll along the pier, watching boats, eating ice cream, swimming, shopping, drinking coffee and delicious food in one of Marstrand's top restaurants.\n\nThe island of Marstrand is located just north of Gothenburg on the coast of Bohuslän. From Gothenburg you can easily reach Marstrand in about 50 minutes. At Gothenburg Central Station you take the train Västtågetnach Ytterby station, where you change to the bus Marstrand Express. It will take you directly to the Marstrand ferry terminal, from where you will take a short ferry ride to the island.\n\nIf you want to visit Marstrand in the summer, you can also travel directly by boat from Gothenburg to Marstrand on certain days. The Strömmabåtarna shipping company sails from the Lilla Bommen pier through the Bohuslän archipelago to the island of Marstrand - passing idyllic small islands and coastal villages.\n\nMarstrand has an exciting history and is unique for those interested in nature, art, architecture and culture. Walk through cozy neighborhoods and narrow streets and then continue on the seaside path that takes you around the island. You can take different paths. One of them will lead you, among others, to the coolest sight on Marstrand - Carlsten Fortress, which has been watching over the island since the 17th century. Here you can crawl into eerie prison holes or enjoy almost endless panoramas from the observation deck. You can also eat here, drink coffee or enjoy a theater performance or concert. On the path around the island you will pass by the so-called Nålögat - a passage between two rocks that is so narrow that you have to walk through it sideways. At the Skallen lighthouse you can also observe how the seas Skagerak and Kattegat meet.\n\nIf you want to go for longer hikes, head to the island of Koön. There are three magical and well-signposted hiking trails with different levels of difficulty and terrain. What they all have in common, however, is beautiful nature, cozy resting places and great panoramic views of the sea.\n\nTo the north you look at small coastal villages and to the west you can see the famous Pater Noster lighthouse. The most challenging trail takes you along the water over rocks and planks, while the slightly easier trail follows paths along Älgöfjorden. Both hiking trails are 5 km long. For those who like it a little easier, there is a 2.5 km circular trail that connects to the trails in Rosenlund Nature Reserve. Of course, you can also combine all three hikes.\n\nIf you come to Marstrand on a warm summer day - or if you like winter bathing - you will find wonderful bathing opportunities on Marstrand: from family-friendly bathing beaches with sandy shores to hidden bays with rocky beaches. Of course, you can visit Marstrand just to shift down a few gears. The expression \"kaja\" - literally kaien - describes a wonderful stroll along the quay. It's a perfect opportunity to lick a delicious ice cream, watch the many boats dock in the guest harbor, and simply enjoy life.\n\nFor its size, the island of Marstrand is a true paradise from a culinary point of view, with several establishments serving first-class food - often focusing on typical dishes of the archipelago. At Grand Tenan, you can enjoy classics like sea-baked Norway lobster au gratin on the fantastic veranda overlooking the verdant Paradise Park and harbor. At Otto's Kök, the menu is based on the flavors of Bohuslän, including the delightful Toast Skagen. And if you ever want to work your way through the region's local shellfish palette, book a table at Marstrands Wärdshus.\n\nSweden's first national marine park invites you to an active vacation for the whole family. There are many ways to explore this unique environment - on water and on land and completely independent of whether you are in the mood for unbeatable nature experiences, pure relaxation or action-packed activities.\n\nKosterhavets National Park reaches from Strömstad in the north to Grebbestad in the south and is Sweden's most biodiverse marine area. Together with the Norwegian sister international park Ytre Hvaler, it forms a unique area with more than 6,000 different plant and animal species, 200 of which are found nowhere else in Sweden. Beneath the sea surface hides a magical underwater landscape - favored by the salty Atlantic deep water that flows in through the up to 250 m deep channel of the Kosterfjord.\n\nFor a first overview of all that the national park has to offer, visit Naturum Kosterhavet near Ekenäs on the island of Sydkoster or Entré Rossö in Rossö harbor. Here, exhibitions and lectures offer a lot of exciting information, and there are also hiking maps for the area. At Naturum you can also get up close to some sea creatures in the petting aquarium.\n\nYou can experience the national park in many different ways. From the front row, so to speak, you can get in touch with the flora and fauna of the park in a kayak. Join a guided tour or venture out on the water on your own. Go ashore on one of the many rocky islets or skerries and explore the world on the beach and among the rocks. If you're lucky, you'll also meet a few seals - Kosterhavet has the largest population of seals in the Skagerrak.\n\nIf, like the seals, you are more curious about life underwater, you should try one of the snorkeling trails at Kosterhavet. On these nature trails in water 1 to 1.5 meters deep, you follow a line stretched along the bottom that leads you to information stations underwater. If the water is cold, don't forget your wetsuit. It is also advisable to swim at least in pairs.\n\nFrom the northern harbor in Strömstad you can easily reach the unmistakably beautiful Koster Islands. Leave the car on the mainland - the exhilarating nature and cozy fishing villages of Koster are best explored on foot or by bike, completely independent of the season.\n\nAnother way to experience the fascinating national park is to take a chartered boat tour or a seal safari. If you are hunting for the delicacies of the sea, a guided fishing tour with a local fisherman is a good option. Depending on the season, you can join them on fishing trips or go fishing for Norway lobster, lobster or mackerel.\n\nAnd whether you are looking for relaxation and enjoyment or activity and adventure in Kosterhavet National Park, there are accommodations and experiences to suit you. But what all this always has in common: the great nature, the salt-smelling wind and the sound of the waves are always there."
