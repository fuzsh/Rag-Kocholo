        "text": "The Check Points in the Stockholm Archipelago Raid is what the Control Points are in an Orienteering race. They can be buoys, light houses, rocks, skerries, kerns or even a beach. You have to round them on the right side and then try to find the smartest way to the next one. But between the Check Points there are many dangers; some very visible islands to round and some rocks lurking beneath the water to dodge. The saying “To finish first you first have to get to the finish” has never been more true.\n\nThe playground is set. 65 Check Points are spread out over a vast area, about 40 NM from East to West and 50 NM from North to South, but not all of them will be used.\n\nEach day in the morning the sailors will get the course for the day. The course is set by the Race Office as late as possible depending on the weather forecast. During lunch break there can be changes to the course. And, if the weather changes quickly compared to forecast, the course can also be altered at a checkpoint during the race for security reasons.\n\nThe Check Points have been given to the sailors in advance so they can down load them into their navigation device. They will also have a sea chart for oversight and planning purpose. There is never one way to get around the course, and many legs has been won, not by the fastest team but by the team that took the best way. It is one reason why different Swedish teams (never the same) has won for the last 5 consecutive years. They have the advantage of knowing the archipelago better. Maybe this year it won’t be enough…\n\nAs 3 weeks remain until start of the Stockholm Archipelago Raid the teams are getting ready. A maximum of 30 teams are allowed and this year sailors come from 14 countries all over the world to experience the adventure in the Stockholm Archipelago.\n\nThe teams:\n\nThere has never been as many nationalities represented in the raid as this year, both some of the best F18-sailors in the world, professional off-shore sailors as well as strong Club sailors. All of them looking forward to the adventure and the stunning nature. If their goal is to get on the podium or just getting to the finish line without hitting a rock, the challenge is just as big. And since there are 10th of thousands of rocks, skerries and Islands in the Stockholm Archipelago it is sometimes easier said than done.\n\nIt is also one of the most competitive fleet of F18 sailors that has ever sailed the raid since the start of the former extreme Archipelago Raid in 2001. All winners since the first raid can be found in the F18 Hall of Fame.\n\nSome of the teams:\n\nIordanis “Dany” Paschalidis (GRE), F18 World Champion 2018 and Silver Medalist 2019 sailing with Marc Pirriloni (FRA), former Tornado World champion and Olympic sailor.\n\nPatrick Demesmaeker (BEL), European F18 champion and winner of St Barth Cata Cup and Vincent Thery (BEL), Archipelago Raid veteran\n\nPierre Yves Moreau / Benoit Lequin (FRA), Maxi trimaran and sport cat transatlantic record holders and Archipelago Raid veterans\n\nFredrik Karlsson / Niklas Nordblom (SWE), winners of the Stockholm Archipelago Raid 2018\n\nLeff Dahl (SWE) F18 Raid World Champion 2017\n\nConcept\n\nThe raid is a mix of sport, nature and adventure in the perfect F18-playground; the Stockholm Archipelago. It is the largest archipelago in Europe with 36.000 rocks, skerries and islands and the most difficult one for navigation.\n\nEach day the fleet will sail between 50 and 100 NM depending on the winds. The competitors are free to choose their route between checkpoints. Each team gets a sea chart of the area and coordinates for the checkpoints. But having a good GPS with plotter attached to the arm or chest is vital. Other gear includes the safety equipment required, like VHF, knives and flares as well as power bars and a Camelbak with water to be able to eat and drink while sailing. Dry suit is recommended since the water in the outer Archipelago can be a bit nippy.\n\n30 teams from 13 countries will participate in Stockholm Archipelago Raid 2019. The level of the competition has never been higher. So far tricky navigation among the 36000 islands and rocks has played to the advantage of the Swedish teams. But maybe this time the Swedish six years winning streak will come to an end…\n\nSix days after registration started 30 teams had already registered. This year the level of competition will be extremely high. In fact, it could be the most competitive fleet of F18 sailors that has ever sailed the raid since the start of the former extreme Archipelago Raid in 2001. All winners since the first raid can be found in the F18 Hall of Fame.\n\nAmong the registered teams to date:\n\nIordanis “Dany” Paschalidis (GRE), F18 World Champion 2018 sailing with Marc Pirriloni (FRA), former Tornado World champion and Olympic sailor.\n\nPatrick Demesmaeker (BEL), European F18 champion and winner of St Barth Cata Cup and Vincent Thery (BEL), Archipelago Raid veteran\n\nPierre Yves Moreau / Benoit Lequin (FRA), Maxi trimaran and sport cat transatlantic record holders and Archipelago Raid veterans\n\nLast year’s raid winners Fredrik Karlsson / Niklas Nordblom (SWE)\n\nLeff Dahl (SWE) F18 Raid World Champion 2017\n\nOle-Petter Pollen / Knut Frostad (NOR) former Olympic sailors\n\nMichael Walther (GER), 3 times German Champion, Extreme Sailing Series and participant of Archipelago Raid in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009\n\nJan Jensen and Penny Wyon (DEN), best mixed team in St Barth Cata cup and first team ever to participate in the raid in Sweden!\n\nEric-Stéphane Georges (MAR) / Cantin Roger (FRA) F18 / Flying Phantom sailors\n\nAnssi Muikku (FIN) Finnish Champion 2017 and Petri Forsman (FIN)\n\nAll Swedish top 5 teams from the last three years\n\nThe concept\n\nThe raid is a mix of sport, nature and adventure in the perfect F18-playground; the stunning Stockholm Archipelago. It is the largest archipelago in Europe with 36.000 rocks, skerries and islands and the most difficult one for navigation. Each day the fleet will sail between 50 and 100 NM depending on the winds. It is tight, intensive racing in the daytime and good food and nice company in the evenings. The competitors are free to choose their route between checkpoints. Each team gets a sea chart of the area and coordinates for the checkpoints. It is strongly recommended to have a GPS with plotter attached to wrist or on the chest.\n\nLimited number of charter boats available 2019\n\nGoodall design has a limited number of boats for charter also this year. In 2018 two teams rented top nodge C2s with DS for the raid. It is a great opportunity for teams from overseas or far away who want to take part in the adventure without bringing their own boats. Check out the Goodall offer and enquire for more information here.\n\nFollow the event on Facebook.\n\nOn the first day since registration opened 13 teams from 9 countries signed-up! There is a limit of 30 teams who can enter the event for security and logistical reasons. One of the first teams to register was the reigning F18 World Champion Iordanis “Dany” Paschalidis from Greece.\n\nAmong the registered teams there are also sailors from Germany, France, Marocko, Great Britain, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden . The Stockholm Archipelago Raid is recognized far outside Sweden and continues to attract sailors from all over the world, both top athletes and experienced club sailors who come for the fun, the sport and the adventure.\n\nNavigation is tricky and local knowledge is an advantage. The Swedish have a 6-year winning streak, but with different teams on the top podium every time. If someone can stop a Swedish team from the first position it could be Dany Paschalidis. The former Olympic Tornado sailor and F18 World champion has sailed “the Raid” before, but not won yet. This time he is extra motivated and will for sure be hard to beat on boat speed. As Dany says in the film from 2011: “This race is an experience for a life time… I suggest to every cat sailor to come and sail this race!”\n\nDany, welcome back 2019 for a new experience!\n\nCreds: Petter Karlberg.\n\nRegistration\n\nWinter is still cold here in Sweden and many people go ice skating on the same waters as we use to sail, but the days are getting longer. Two months from now F18 training starts and in six months the next edition of the Stockholm Archipelago Raid takes place.\n\nOn the 1st of March registration opens for the 2019 Stockholm Archipelago Raid. There is a limit of maximum 30 teams for logistical and security reasons.\n\nLimited number of charter boats available 2019.\n\nGoodall design has a limited number of boats for charter also this year. In 2018 two teams rented top nodge C2s with DS for the raid.\n\nPatrick Demesmaeker and Vincent Thery (BEL) came in 2nd and Lucy Nissen 18 years and Jai Tooley 17 years (AUS) came 5th in their first raid ever. This is a great opportunity for teams from overseas or far away who want to take part in the adventure. Check out the Goodall offer and enquire for more information here.\n\nSailors who wish to participate as crew or helmsman but but do not have a race buddy can enter contact information here . The Event Organisation will try to pair you up with any other sailors who might lack a team buddy but have a boat.\n\nPreliminary programme\n\nThe raid takes place from the 22nd to the 25th of August 2018. The start and finish line will be outside KSSS in Saltsjöbaden, Stockholm. The sailors will sail from the inner, trough the middle, to the outer parts of the archipelago and back. Usually we sail two legs per day, but sometimes there could be three legs in which case there will be an early start.\n\nThe first base camp will be at Lökholmen, Sandhamn. Sandhamn is the sailing metropolis of Stockholm. At the base camp Lökholmen there is a great sauna, good food and party in our own house “Varvet”.\n\nThe second base camp will likely be at Fejan in the very north of the archipelago. The restaurant burned to the ground in 2015 and that was the last time the raid visited this very classical raid base camp. Fejan has a charming hostel, sauna and a jetty where the boats will be parked since there is not enough space on land.\n\nOn day 3 the fleet go back south towards Sandhamn allowing for some interesting route choices including rounding the lighthouse Söderarm, the last outpost towards Ålands Archipelago on the Finnish side. The base camp this night will be Lökholmen.\n\nThe 4th day the fleet will be going south before it is time for the final sprint towards the finish line in Saltsjöbaden.\n\nAll winners since the first raid in 2001 can be found in the F18 Hall of Fame.\n\nAs the days get shorter and colder and Christmas is approaching you may think of other things than Formula 18 raid racing. Well, we’re not. Planning for the 2019 edition is well under way and it’s going to be special. Because seriously, what can possibly be better than a gennaker run on one hull through a narrow straight with one eye on the GPS, one on the tell tales and one in the water in front of you in case you have to dodge a rock…\n\nGoing through stora Nassa 2018. Creds to Hartas Productions\n\nSome base camps are set, some are not, so the dates are still a little flexible, but it’s going to be 4 or 5 days of sailing between the 22-26th of August. The concept will be similar to the last couple of years: work hard, play hard and then chill out with a good sauna before drinks, dinner and the sack. Repeat.\n\nUntil then save the date and sign up for our newsletter to stay tuned. And when the longing gets too bad, let yourself be carried away to the Stockholm archipelago the summer of 2016.\n\nF18 raid Worlds 2017 promo – high res from Stockholm Archipelago Raid on Vimeo.\n\n…all teams of the raid who pushed themselves to the limit, leg after leg, mile after mile through all the islands, rocks and open sea in quite tough wind conditions. And all teams who battled with the teams around them and sometimes gained a point or two and sometimes lost. And all teams who took part in the adventure and made it to the remote islands and skerries where seals and seabirds live. And also all the people of the Race Organisation who made the race so successful, the food so tasty, the sauna hot and the beer cold and the whole experience so nice.\n\nAll teams were winners, but some teams were more winners than the other teams. Three teams stood out from the crowd this year:\n\nOverall winner Fredrik Karlsson and Niklas Nordblom (SWE) who beat Patrick Demesmaeker and Vincent Thery (BEL) literally on the finish line with only 1 point.\n\nWinners in the mixed class Leff Dahl and Ida Svensson (SWE) who where overall on third place, only a capsize or two from the overall win.\n\nWinners of the youth class Lucy Nissen (18) and Jai Tooley (17) (AUS) who where 5th overall. Considering that they are a very light team in heavy conditions, that they normally don’t sail together, that they haven’t had to navigate to dodge rocks before and that they sailed a C2 for the first time this achievement was outstanding!\n\nAll other winners can be found in the Final Results and below. Big congratulations to all of you. Hope to see you back next year!\n\n/Lars\n\nYesterday 15 boats participated in a Raid tune up around the nearby islands. It was perfect to begin with and we were flying out one one hull with the gennakers. On leg 4 on our way home the wind died completely, so we had to practice towing as well. Now we are really prepared.\n\nAll boats registered today and passed the safety inspection. At 7PM there was team briefing that started with hotdogs and beer. The teams are now ready and all is prepared for the start tomorrow at 10 outside Saltsjöbaden. The course was for leg 1 and 2 will be:\n\nLeg 1:\n\nCP1 – start\n\nCP40 to port\n\nCP57 to port\n\nCP61 (Close) finish\n\nLeg 2\n\nCP61 Start\n\nCP58 to port\n\nCP40 to port\n\nCP49 to port\n\nCP32 to starbord\n\nCP26 (close) Finish\n\nThe course will go towards the south passed Dalarö to the island Rånö where there is a lunch stop. The second leg will take the sailors out at sea and then gives some interesting options to go at sea or more behid some islands protected from the waves but with more gybing on the way of to the finish in Sandhamn where we hope to arrive around 6 PM after some 70 NM sailed distance\n\nWith 3 days until start the foreign teams have started to arrive in Stockholm. There are 23 teams competing in this year’s edition and it is a fantastic fleet of sailors: 10 nationalities from Europe, Australia and the Americas. 6 mixed teams. 2 youth teams (both helm and crew are under 19).\n\nThere are a several contenders for the podium and the level of competition is as always on a high level. Some teams to watch out for:\n\nBEL Patrick Demesmaeker (European F18 champion, winner of St Barth Cata Cup etc) / Vincent Thery (Archipelago Raid veteran)\n\nSWE Fredrik Karlsson / Niklas Nordblom has won all F18 titles there is to win in the Nordics, except the raid. Will be smoking with their new boat with Deck Sweeper sail.\n\nSWE Leff Dahl (reigning F18 Raid World Champion) sailing with Ida Svensson (Olympic campaign in Nacra 17)\n\nGBR Archie Massey and Harvey Hillary with lots of Championship medals, but for the first time in the Stockholm Archipelago Raid.\n\nTo get on top on the podium in the mixed class the competition has never been as though. In addition to Leff and Ida you also have to beat teams like:\n\nJakob Thun and Linda Sjö who finished 3rd in the mixed class last year tightly followed by…\n\nTherese Antman and Oscar Wetterling finishing 4th last year\n\nManfred Zeissel and Eveline Haselsteiner are back with charged batteries\n\nSimon Skoog sailing with Sandra Sandqvist (both involved in the Artemis AC project) are sailing with a new Deck Sweeper sail\n\nIn the youth class (<26) there are two teams fighting for the gold medal: Lucy Nissen (1999) / Jai Tooley (2000) from Australia and Max Rehman Linder (1999) and Niklas Forhaug (2001) from Sweden. Watch out for these young sailors a few years from now…"
