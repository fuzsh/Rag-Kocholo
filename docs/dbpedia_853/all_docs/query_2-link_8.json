        "text": "With fairytale fjords, snowy peaks, lush valleys, and charming painted villages, Scandinavia is one of the most beautiful places in the world. This Northern European region, made up of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, is a natural paradise – and you have to see it to believe it. To inspire your next trip, we’ve rounded up the most stunning sights in Scandinavia. From arctic islands and scenic roads to the “King of Fjords”, this is the best of Scandinavia.\n\nGeirangerfjord, Norway\n\nIf you’re looking for the most beautiful sights in Norway, you’ve got to see the UNESCO-listed Geirangerfjord. Set in southwestern Norway, Geirangerfjord is one of the most extraordinary natural wonders in the world. With deep blue waters, surrounded by 600-metre rock walls, snow-capped peaks, emerald forests, and dreamy waterfalls, this fjord looks like something out of a storybook. You can experience this natural wonder by taking a cruise or by hiking or kayaking in the area.\n\nWhen you travel with Trafalgar, you’ll marvel at views of the fjord when we drive the scenic hairpin bends along the Dalsnibba Pass. You’ll then get to spend the night on the edge of Geirangerfjord at one of Trafalgar’s Stays With Stories – Hotel Havila Geiranger. Scandinavia sightseeing doesn’t get much better than this.\n\nGET INSPIRED BY: Scenic Scandinavia and its Fjords\n\nTrollstigen, Norway\n\nYou can see more spectacular views of Geirangerfjord when you drive the Geiranger-to-Trollstigen route. But Trollstigen (the path of trolls) is one of the most breathtaking sights in Scandinavia in its own right, as one of Norway’s most iconic mountain roads. We’ll take you driving past rocky mountain slopes, cascading waterfalls, and lush valleys. The road is an engineering marvel in one of the most exquisite places on earth… You won’t want to blink!\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Welcome to my home: why to travel to Scandinavia\n\nGamla Stan, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nIf you want to see the best of Scandinavia, start in the capitals. Each city, from Oslo to Copenhagen, has its treasures – and Stockholm is no different. You can’t miss the Gamla Stan neighbourhood of this city. It’s the historic Old Town, lined with cobblestone streets, medieval cathedrals, and 17th-century architecture. See the old merchant houses and indulge in Nordic cuisine in the cosy bistros.

This archipelago is famed for its striking scenery where the northern lights dance over sandy beaches, turquoise Arctic waters, snowy peaks, and red cottages. This is one wild and remote natural paradise, but we’ll get you there on our Nordic Adventure trip. You can go hiking, cruising or fishing, or even dive into the region’s Viking history.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: The most amazing once-in-a-lifetime trips put on your bucket list\n\nTromsø, Norway\n\nTromsø is famed as the gateway to the Arctic and places like the Lofoten Islands – but it’s also a stunning little town to visit. In winter, it’s one of the best places to see the spectacular Northern Lights or spot orcas from November to early February. In summer, you can marvel at the midnight sun, with almost 24-hour daylight. You can also visit spots like the Arctic Cathedral and the Polar Museum. Admire the colourful buildings or take a cable car up Mount Sorsteinen for amazing views.\n\nGET INSPIRED BY: Nordic Adventure\n\nNyhavn district in Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nIf you’ve seen a photo of Copenhagen, it was probably the dazzling Nyhavn district of Copenhagen. With its 17th-century harbour and iconic colourful buildings, this is one of those places that definitely lives up to the hype. Wander along the harbour and see the wooden ships and painted townhouses. Then kick back for a drink or two in the buzzing bars and cafes.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Where to find the best Christmas markets in Scandinavia\n\nFlåm Valley, Norway\n\nWith its green fields, rushing crystal rivers, soaring mountains, and quaint villages, Flåm Valley could’ve been plucked straight from a fairytale. It’s absolutely stunning and you can experience it on Trafagar’s Scandinavia tours, when we take you onboard the Flåm, one of the world’s most scenic train journeys. You’ll go chugging over 860 metres above sea level through the divine landscapes of Flåm Vally.

These white chalk cliffs stretch for miles along the Danish island of Møn in the Baltic Sea – and they’re one of the best sights in Scandinavia. Less than an hour’s drive from Copenhagen, you’ll find scenic beaches, blue-green waters, rare orchards, and nesting peregrine falcons. You can even go stargazing as this area was Scandinavia’s first official Dark Sky Park.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: An expert’s guide on how to experience Denmark like a local\n\nFrederiksborg Castle & Gardens, Denmark\n\nDenmark is home to several opulent castles, but Frederiksborg Castle is a must-visit. Built in the early 17th century, this Renaissance castle spreads across three lake islets in Hillerød near Copenhagen. When you travel with Trafalgar, we’ll take you here to tour the State Apartments and the Coronation Chapel. But it’s the gardens that will really blow you away. The baroque gardens feature winding paths, canals, terraces, and fountains, and it’s a true work of art.\n\nGET INSPIRED BY: Capitals of Scandinavia\n\nSognefjord, Norway\n\nRenowned as the “King of the Fjords”, any Scandinavia travel adventure has to include Sognefjord. It’s the largest and deepest fjord in Norway and includes the equally beautiful Nærøyfjord. We’ll take you cruising through this spellbinding scenery with snow-capped mountains, waterfalls, and charming villages that have inspired countless artists over the years. You’ll also spend the night at one of Trafalgar’s Stays With Stories, the Sognefjord Hotel.

Bergen is nicknamed the ‘Heart of the Fjords’ because of its close proximity to Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord. It’s also set on the seaside and surrounded by the Seven Mountains range. There are plenty of things to check out here including the UNESCO-listed, 12th-century Bryggen Hanseatic wharf.

With tens of thousands of tiny islands and beaches, the Stockholm Archipelago is the largest in Sweden – and one of the most breathtaking sights in Scandinavia. You can take a boat ride across the archipelago, see the charming red wooden homes, or watch the sunset over the Baltic Sea. You can also go swimming, hiking, foraging or fishing in the area. While there are a lot of islands to explore, some of the hot spots include the Svenska Högarna islets and the Fjäderholmarna Islands. The islands of Grinda, Sandhamm and Valhom are also known to throw amazing celebrations for the Midsummer festival.\n\nGET INSPIRED BY: Scandinavian Northern Lights\n\nStavanger, Norway\n\nAs one of Norway’s oldest settlements, Stavanger has a fascinating history. It’s also one of the prettiest port towns, with beautifully preserved wooden buildings dating back to the 18th century.
