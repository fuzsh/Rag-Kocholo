Effective 1 January 2024, at a haul-out within two years prior to the event, the owner or his/her representative shall inspect the integrity of the keel and rudder following the recommendations in Appendix L.\n\nKSSS are treating this as the responsibility of the Owner and/or the Person in Charge. For Swedish boats, the Swedish Sailing Federation (SSF) has presented an adjusted Swedish application for OSR 3.02.2.

On Skippo map you will find the boats and can serch for crewmembers och participating boats. TracTrac is our system for Live results.\n\nResults & Rating certificates\n\nQ: This summer I did not find intermediate results (Korshalsen, Fårö, Hoburg...) after the race. Are you going to publish them in 2024?\n\nA: Provided that the boat has completed the race you can find the partial results in TracTrac by clicking on the stopwatch symbol. You find the Gotland Runt 2023 here. Link to 2024 will be published on the ONB closer to the race.\n\nQ: When shall I present my ORCi rating certificate? Can I change it after that date?\n\nA: You shall have your ORCi-certificate valid and published online at www.orc.org latest 18 June.No changes shall be made on ORCi certificates after 18 June unless prescribed and approved by the technical committee in correcting any error that may be found in boat’s certificate before or during the pre-race equipment inspection and before the start of the first race.\n\nQ: I have an ORC Club certificate, is okey to use this for Gotland Runt?\n\nA: No. Gotland Runt invite ORC International only.\n\nQ: When shall I present my SRS rating certificate? Can I change it after that date?\n\nA: Last day for applying for an SRS-certificate at SSF is 8 June 2024. The Swedish Sailing Federation´s rating office has a 10-day working process on all rating certificates. I practice, your SRS-certificate shall be valid and published online not later than 18 June 2024.\n\nThe rating certificate may not be changed after 8 June 2024, except as a result of a rating protest or to correct adjusted data from the SSF’s rating office.\n\nQ: I have ordered a new mainsail and hope it will arrive before the regatta. In my entry I have used my current, valid rating certificate. Can I change to an adjusted rating certificate after the new sail has arrived and is included in the adjusted rating certificate?\n\nA: A rating certificate may not be changed after 18 June 2024 except as a result of a rating protest or to correct adjusted data from the rating office.\n\nQ: What is the Gotland Round rating (GR-rating)?\n\nA: At Gotland Runt, we want to crown an overall winner and SRS will be used for the overall Gotland Runt Trophy for monohulls.KSSS will provide boats in the ORCi class with an SRS based rating number, the Gotland Runt-rating (GR-rating), calculated from its APH. All boats registered in SRS will use their regular SRS number, but in the total list they are also referred to as GR-rating.\n\nQ: How is the GR-rating calculated for the ORCi boats?\n\nA: KSSS compares the ORCi boats APH-numbers with SRS rating where matching certificates are found in SRS. In addition, KSSS also uses a conversion factor to yield a GR rating for the ORCi boats. The conversion factor corresponds to the average of the difference between this group of boats. This means that approximately as many boats will be benefited as disadvantaged by the recalculation from ORCi to SRS.\n\nThe effect is that the relative position of the boats in the ORCi class result list will not be different from the Overall list (SRS). The boat that wins in ORCi will not have another ORCi boat in front of it in the overall results. Depending on whether the ORCi boats have been favoured or disadvantaged in the calculation, some boats will get a better place and some a little worse in the overall list, compared to if they had been registered in SRS-class with an SRS certificate.Everywinter the ORCi and SRS formula may change and therefore the comparison can only be done when the fleets certificates are published.\n\nDouble Handed\n\nQ: Are double handed Multihulls rated in the total DH rating?\n\nA: For reasons of fairness, monohulls should not compete against multihulls under the SRS rule. The Double Handed class is for monohull boats. Therefore, a multihull cannot sail in the DH class but in the multihull class.\n\nQ: The Offshore Special Regulations (OSR 2020-2021) states in OSR 6.01.3 that in cat. 3 when there are only two crewmembers, at least one shall have undertaken training within the five years before the start of the race in OSR 6.02 Training Topics. Is this training required in Gotland Runt double-hand class this year?\n\nA: Yes. Gotland Runt will apply this requirement from 2021.\n\nQ: Will Double Handed be a separate start? For manoeuvrability.\n\nA: The starting groups have not been decided yet. We will try to make them as fair as possible.\n\nCourse\n\nQ: Are the marks set after the start? Svängen? Revenge?\n\nA: The exact positions of the course will be written in the Sailing Instructions.\n\nQ: Do you have a route finished for navigation software\n\nA: The course will be written in the Sailing Instructions.\n\nOutside help\n\nQ: Does the changed RRS 41 (c) allow use of grib files on a subscription or by payment of a fee?\n\nA: A boat may receive help from an outside source in the form of information which is available to all boats, which shall include navigational, weather, tide or current information from any source which is available to all boats whether or not by payment of a fee or subscription, but shall not include any information gathered or the subject of interpretation by, or any advice received from, any human being not on board the boat and which is specific to the boat and her situation.\n\nQ: Does the changed RRS 41 (c) allow use of information from a cloud service?\n\nA: The Race Committee consider data processing and storage done in the cloud (software as a service) to be equivalent to local processing if local solutions are readily available (i.e. weather routing done in the cloud by services such as Squid or Predict Wind are equivalent to weather routing done locally in Expedition or Seapilot and therefore allowed).\n\nPrizes and Trophies\n\nQ: We sail in the multihull class. Can we win the overall Gotland Runt Trophy?\n\nA: No, the overall Gotland Runt Trophy is only open for monohulls. The SRS system does not work well for racing between multihull and monohull boats.\n\nQ: How can we nominate our bowman to the Janne Gustavsson memorial?\n\nA: The winner is appointed after nomination of the skipper after the finish in Sandhamn. Nomination will be done on tha website, Nomination Form - KSSS\n\nFor other nominations see this link to the website: Trophy application form - KSSS\n\nOther"
