        "text": "Amundtorp is a few kilometres south of Varnhem in an area full of historical sights. The small village has a population of around 60 inhabitants, but it hides some treasures that make a visit worthwhile.\n\nA Short History of Amundtorp\n\nThe history of Amundtorp is long but not very well documented. The area has been inhabited for centuries, with remains dating back to the early Iron Age. The farms in the area have been concentrating on harvesting barley and wheat as well as keeping sheep and cattle.\n\nA lime kiln was built in Amundtorp at the beginning of the 20th century for the calcination of limestone. This was commonly used at these times within several industries. One such industry was farming where it was spread out over the fields for a higher yield.\n\nThings to Do and See\n\nThe main sight in Amundtorp is well hidden. Located on the hill above a small farm, it not only offers an historical insight but also a great view of the surrounding landscape.\n\nHögarna at Millomgården\n\nThe farm Millomgården hides one of the gems in the area. After a short walk over a field, visitors may or may not find a group of impressive stones. The name of the place, Högarna, is Swedish for mounds, piles, heaps.\n\nThe burial ground dates back to the Iron Age and consists of both stone circles and a stone ship. There is a total of eight graves. The stone ship is the main attraction, where large stones form the shape of a 24 metre long ship. A stone ship was an early burial custom in northern Europe. As the name indicates, slabs or stones in the shape of a ship surround the grave. The ships vary in size. According to Wikipedia, this burial custom occurred from 1000 BC to 1000 AD.\n\nThe entire grave field is 140 metres long and approximately 40 metres wide. It was probably larger historically. Because of its location on the western slopes of Billingen (the largest mesa in Västra Götaland), visitors can enjoy the beautiful view of the surroundings. The theory is that this particular grave field dates to the Migration Period and 400-500 AD.\n\nThe area also includes the remains of the lime kiln that was used for the production of burnt lime.\n\nHow to Get to Amundtorp\n\nFlights: The closest large airport is Göteborg Landvetter Airport (GOT) 136 kilometres away, with both domestic and international flights. Another option is Jönköping Airport (JKG), 89 kilometres away, with mostly chartered flights.\n\nCar: Amundtorp is close to road 49 between Skara and Skövde.\n\nTrain: The closest train station from Amundtorp is in nearby Skövde.\n\nBus: Regional and local buses connect Amundtorp with the surrounding region.\n\nThe driving distance from 5 major Swedish cities, according to Google Maps:\n\nStockholm – 352 kilometres (3h 59min)\n\nGothenburg – 144 kilometres (1h 51min)\n\nMalmö – 379 kilometres (4h 13min)\n\nLinköping – 192 kilometres (2h 33min)\n\nKiruna – 1449 kilometres (17h 9min)\n\nExplore More of Västergötland and Sweden"
