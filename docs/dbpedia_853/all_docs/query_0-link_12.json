The water surface is calm during Wind from S, but on deck level you will feel the wind because the rocks are not going high.\n\nThere are two wooden docks to go alongside where you need to go through a narrow channel of rocks to reach them. A short one and a longer one. See aerial picture. At the entrance of the channel, where you see the old wooden boat on the aerial picture it is deep along the rock. Be aware of the other side, E side of channel entrance, there is a shallow rock, barely visible on its seaweed on top.\n\nThe bay is too narrow and too rocky on the seabed to anchor with bow anchor. So you eighter go bow to the rock with stern anchor or alongside where the rocks are going down really steep. (Position of the old wooden School Boat SY-Ellen)\n\nThe lighthouse on the island can be vusited and is open sometimes. There is a nice lighthouse museum besides. (one room) containing nice information about it. Two rangers are taking care of the island, its naturreservat and the light house.\n\n1 x helpful | written on 16. Jan 2024"
