Svenska Högarna is located furthest east in Stockholm’s outer archipelago. It is Sweden’s largest marine nature reserve. Here you will find barren nature with smooth cliffs and giant pots.

At Storön there are several trails that lead you around the harbours of Ytterhamnen, Innerhamnen, the lighthouse and the island’s facilities. The island is known for its lighthouse that has stood here since the 19th century, and there is also a rock labyrinth, a trojan fort and a cemetery. There are limited harbouring possibilities on the east side of Storön at the harbour Ytterhamnen. Here you will find a jetty, a waste station and an outhouse.
