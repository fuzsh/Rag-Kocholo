The Stockholm Archipelago is the largest of its kind in Sweden. With over 30 000 islands it covers an area of more than 650 square miles; from the city-close Fjäderholmarna Islands in the west to the Svenska Högarna islets in the east, and from the abandoned fortifications on Arnholma in the north to the lonely lighthouse on Landsort in the south.

Being such a vast area there’s certainly something to discover for everyone; serene nature seemingly untouched by civilization, cozy and accessible camping grounds, idyllic villages and coastal towns, hiking trails for both experienced and amateur outdoorsmen, great food, and fantastic culture. Oh yeah, and water. Lots of water.

The question is, of course, where to begin. Well, narrowing down how much time you have for an archipelago excursion is a good place to start.

In Stockholm on a tight schedule? Then Fjäderholmarna, Vaxholm, Gustavsberg, and Värmdö might be up your alley. All are easily accessible by local transportation or ferry, within an hour's reach from downtown Stockholm. Great day trips that don’t require too much preparation, while at the same time offering a sample taste of what the archipelago has to offer.
