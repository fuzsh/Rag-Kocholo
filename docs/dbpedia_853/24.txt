Welcome to the largest marine nature reserve in Sweden! Svenska Högarna is located at the furthest reaches of the Stockholm Archipelago. The weather-beaten islands and skerries lack vegetation, with the exception of Storön ("The Big Island), where junipers, shrubs and forest patches surround the wetlands. There is a lighthouse here, also named Svenska Högarna. There are no public ferries to the island—making it one of most isolated islands of its kind in Sweden.

Svenska Högarna is an important habitat for a range of animals and provides resting sites for migratory birds and seabirds. Murre, razorbill and eider breed here in the spring and summer. There's also a good chance you'll spot grey seal in the sea. In the winter time, you can see long-tailed ducks.

Visit the village on Storön to see the lighthouse and the traditional fishing cottages. Here, you can explore remnants of buildings used for herring and cod fishing during the Middle Ages. There's also an old cemetery, stone labyrinths, a stone-carved compass rose and giant's kettles.
