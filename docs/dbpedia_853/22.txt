The Site was originally designated under the name “Stockholm, outer archipelago” of which it forms part. It includes four groups of islands: Stora Nassa, Lilla Nassa, Gillöga and Svenska Högarna. The area constitutes a mosaic of many islands surrounded by shallow marine water, which together are of high conservation value. The Site supports populations of animal species important for maintaining the biological diversity of the European Boreal region, including grey seals and a rich bird life counting over 50 breeding species. The Site is a refuge of great significance in adverse weather conditions and is important to some migrating and breeding waterbirds including velvet scoter Melanitta fusca and ruddy turnstone Arenaria interpres, which is listed as vulnerable in the National Red List. Human activities include recreation, boating, and fishing. The main threats affecting the Site’s ecological character relate to its shipping lanes, tourism and recreation areas. The Site is also known as a Baltic Sea Protection Area and benefits from a marine collaboration plan.
