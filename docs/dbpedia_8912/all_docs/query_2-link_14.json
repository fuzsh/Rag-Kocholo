        "text": "Anonymous asked:\n\nYour thoughts about why the Pc's name , Frisk is only revealed to us at the end of the pacifist route? Makes it easier for emotional immersion?\n\nThat's really a fascinating question, and I think it's kind of a multifaceted matter:\n\n1. A subject I brought up a bit before, but... part of the Point of the Pacifist Ending is that it's morally inexcusable from an in-universe perspective to RESET it. You're just yanking away everyone's Happy Ending so you can spend more time with them. It's basically what Asriel tried to do.\n\nSo it's important to establish that Frisk is a distinctive entity from us - We can't try and excuse our RESET with \"but won't our friends miss us too, when we stop playing?\" - because their ACTUAL friend is Frisk , they're still in the world of Undertale with all of their friend, and we'll be taking away their happy ending too if we RESET.\n\nThis idea is not relevant to the Neutral Runs (which try and push you to RESET and try a different route until you get True Pacifist) or the Murder Run (which emphasizes how much the things you're doing are Very Bad ad Wrong. You specifically and not some character) - so there won't be any use to revealing Frisk's name there.\n\n2. There's also a bit of an intentional reversal for how Players often think about Good\\Bad morality choices in games. Like, that 'You' do the Good Choices but Evil Choices are done by 'Your Character'. Undertale kinda trolls this mindset by making a Good Ending that deliberately separates you from the Player Character, while the Evil Ending does not.\n\nThere's maybe also a more serious read to it, that under the rules of Undertale (where SAVEs and RESETs exist in the game world and the Player is basically an Unkillable Time God) - truly moral actions cannot come from Player\\Unkillable Time God entities because they are so detached from any kind of stakes or consequences. To make the actions of True Pacifist heroic, Frisk has to emphasized as a separate character from the Player because that's the only way their heroism can matter. Meanwhile, the Murder Route is about the immorality of the Player as an in-universe entity, and so this idea is de-emphasized.\n\n3. There's also a deliberate bit of... making the Frisk-Chara-Player relationship deliberately ambiguous. The game starts off (and in the Neutral Route, ends) with the assumption that you're just playing as your Character, who you have named after you, and that's it. If you play to the Pacifist Ending, it's revealed that the Player Character is Frisk and it's kinda implied that 'You' might be Chara.\n\n(I mean, Asriel \"Flowey\" Dreemurr is not exactly a world authority on Correctly Identifying People as Chara, but it IS an implication in the text!)\n\nTHEN the Murder Route and it's ending reveals that Chara is ALSO a Very Different Person than you.\n\nAnd their dialogue (and what happens in later playthroughs) seems to imply that 'You' might be Frisk.\n\nThe most logical assumption might be that Chara, Frisk and the Player are three different distinctive entities, but the game deliberately screws with your understanding of the situation to make you ask question about the relationship between a Player and a Player Character.\n\n4. Plus, a lot of fans speculate that the name only being revealed on the True Pacifist Route is indicative that True Pacifist is what Frisk truly wants to do when outside our influence (and that would certainly make sense, we leave them be at the end of that Route, and it doesn't seem like they go OH THAT SUCKS I HAVE TO PRETEND TO BE FRIENDS WITH ALL THESE LOSERS??? I WAS GONNA MURDER THEM ALL ): \")\n\n(I have other reasons to assume True Pacifist is what Frisk really wants but that might belong in a different post)\n\n5. Buuuuut... there seem to be Something More going on here. Namely, if you take a look at some Official Undertale Merch, you will notice that the name \"Frisk\" is NEVER actually used.\n\nI mean you can say it's just to avoid Spoilers, since the fact that Frisk has their own name is a pretty major one. But there's TONS of spoilery Official Undertale Merch!\n\nThe Undertale Tarot Cards, designed by Tumblr User @dogbomber​, originally used Frisk’s name back when they were just posted on Tumblr.\n\nBut when they became the Official Undertale Tarot Cards, Frisk’s card has been renamed as “The Human”\n\nAnd those cards are extremely super spoilery to the max!!\n\nSo is there something else going on here? Is it possible that the character’s name is Frisk.......... only in the True Pacifist timeline?\n\n5. Maybe, maybe Frisk only named themself when Asriel asked for their name. That could also be good symbolism to them taking the reigns away from the Player. The Player started out naming Chara, but Frisk has just given themself a name.\n\nLike we still don’t know what sort of thing led Frisk to climb Mt. Ebott in the first place and what sort of life they had before. Maybe they had an Incredibly Shitty Life and in the True Pacifist Timeline they’re like “finally I’ve done some good things, I have friends, I’m a hero! It’s a brand new start for me! To symbolize this is a New Start, I’m going to give myself a new name!”.\n\n(Maybe their old name was.................. Kris??? Idk)\n\nOr maybe Frisk legit didn’t have any name when they fell into the Underground, maybe they already decided they don’t like their given name but didn’t decide on a new one yet ...... maybe they had such a crappy life that they legit were never even given a name. And it’s only in the True Pacifist Route that they get a chance to declare their own identity.\n\n6. Maybe Frisk IS actually Chara in a way. We never actually get to see them fall into the Underground, only wake up on the flowerbed\\Chara’s grave. Maybe the Human is ALWAYS the reincarnated\\resurrected Chara but their old memories only full awaken if you do a Murder Route?\n\nIn a Neutral Route they’re just kinda confused and disoriented and unsure of who they are. And in a Pacifist Route they start establishing their own identity distinctive from their old one to the point that they totally lose all of their old memories and believe they’re a person totally unrelated to Chara - and give themself a name, Frisk.\n\n7. Maybe their name IS Chara but they’re totally unrelated to Chara Dreemurr so when Asriel asked for their name they panicked like “Oh I’m gonna have to tell him I’m Chara just not the Chara he knows and it’s gonna be kinda awkward” and invented a new one. But then it turns out that because Asriel has absorbed all the SOULs in the Underground, everyone thinks their name is Frisk now. But they just went “................ okay you know what? Frisk IS a nice name! My name is Frisk now! Woo!”"
