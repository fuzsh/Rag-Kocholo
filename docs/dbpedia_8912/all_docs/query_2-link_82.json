        "text": "The F R I S K Documentation\n\nWorkshop Materials\n\nThe FRISK documentation model was developed in 1994 by Steven J. Anderson to assist public school district clientele in proper and effective documentation of employees. Since then, it has been tailored for various other types of employers. Most recently, it was adapted for private industry.\n\nFRISK is an acronym standing for:\n\nFACTS\n\nRULES\n\nIMPACT\n\nSUGGESTIONS (DIRECTIVES)\n\nKNOWLEDGE\n\nThe FRISK documentation model is designed for managers as a practical and straightforward method for documenting unsatisfactory employee performance.\n\nThe primary objectives of FRISK are to:\n\nEffect positive change through clear communication;\n\nIdentify the common elements necessary for legally sufficient documentation;\n\nSimplify the drafting of documentation by establishing a framework.\n\nThe MAIN Purpose of the FRISK documentation model is to improve employee\n\nperformance through direct, honest and constructive communication. Unfortunately, since the employee cannot always improve, this Model also provides the manager with the necessary elements for legally sufficient documentation. Legally sufficient documentation of employee performance deficiencies is the employer’s primary source of evidence to support management’s position in any subsequent challenge.\n\nThis workshop is a condensed version of a more comprehensive half-day seminar for managerial employees. We hope that you find this exercise as valuable as the literally thousands of managers who have attended similar workshops in the past.\n\nFACTS\n\nSummary\n\nIn stating facts evidencing an employee’s deficient performance, the evaluator should: (1) separately pinpoint each deficient performance area; (2) describe the conduct in complete and explicit terms using plain language and specific factual details; and (3) carefully avoid making factual errors (e.g. incorrect dates or document references).\n\nThe statement of the facts should be a self-contained record of the employee’s conduct and should clearly identify the problem.\n\nExamples and samples of the employee’s work should be used to supplement general or conclusory statements about “poor performance.”\n\nQUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS\n\nWhat’s wrong with this part of a memo?\n\nDear Bob:\n\nI was upset by your conduct last week. Your attitude indicates a lack\n\nConcern and attentiveness for safety and was insubordinate. If you have any problems, you should feel free to discuss them with me. If things don’t improve, I may have to recommend you for dismissal.\n\nWhat’s wrong here?\n\nDear Mary:\n\nYou still did not do what you are supposed to do with your client contacts, which we have talked about in the past. Sue told me you were aware of my prior memo, which addressed this issue.\n\nWhat’s right with this part of a memo?\n\nDear Bob:\n\nOn Friday, March 10, 1999, I attempted to inspect your truck prior to your morning run. You requested that I reschedule the inspection and I explained that the inspection had to be completed before your first run. You then said: “Get off my truck right now or I’ll kick you off.”\n\nWhat’s right here?\n\nDear Mary:\n\nOn February 7, 1999, I directed you in a conference and by memo to have your calendar of clients on my desk each Friday by 4:00 p.m.\n\nfor the following week. On Friday, February 17, you failed to turn in\n\nyour calendar as per my directive.\n\nOn Monday February 20, you turned in your calendar, as attached,\n\nwhich are not in compliance with my directive. This does not account for your whereabouts during your entire duty day.\n\nHow would you add specificity to the following general or conclusory statements?\n\nYour cash register receipts, on March 4 1999, were incomplete.\n\n2. Your comments to Linda, on February 20, 1999, were discourteous.\n\nIn May, you failed to follow directions in making your presentation.\n\nRULES\n\nSummary\n\nIn stating the rule, the evaluator is describing what should have happened. In other words, what was the proper conduct the employee should have followed. Standards for proper conduct may be found in company policies, collective bargaining contract provisions, job descriptions, employee handbook provisions, prior directives or instructions, statutory provisions, state, county or federal mandates, and recognized professional standards, as well as basic accepted rules of conduct.\n\nTo justify disciplinary action, the employee should first be aware of the rule or standard expected to be followed in order to be accountable for any subsequent recurring violations.\n\nPrior violations of the same rules should be noted in the disciplinary document in order to best document patterns of similar deficient conduct. This approach underscores the evaluator’s awareness of the problem and helps justify harsher corrective action under progressive discipline.\n\nQUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS\n\nWhat standard(s) of proper performance could be used for the following conduct?\n\n1 Hap Liss told his co-worker and his supervisor that he would not help in completing the fire sprinkler repair work (even though the new law required proper installation by the next day) because the job was too messy and he was tired.\n\nIma Nagood, the HR clerk misspelled “welcome,” “human resources,” and the company name on the main employee bulletin board.\n\nMike Tryson told his co-worker Robin Misgivins right in front of a customer that “she was stupid and should consider herself lucky that he didn’t sock her.”\n\nIMPACT\n\nSummary\n\nIn stating the impact, the evaluator is connecting the employee’s deficient conduct and the negative effect of this conduct on the company – including clients/customers, employees, or property. The negative impact of the employee’s conduct is particularly important in emphasizing the significance of the of the adverse effect on the company and also in establishing the relationship between remote or abstract employee conduct and the job itself in order to justify disciplinary action.\n\nImpact evidence includes facts concerning:\n\nThe adverse effect of the employee’s conduct on company operations (e.g. corporate level or department) and other persons (e.g. clients/customers, other employees, and/or public)\n\nThe adverse effect on the employee’s effectiveness to do the job based on negative public notoriety (e.g. to command the respect and confidence of co-workers, managers and/or public).\n\nThe costs (monetary/non-monetary) of the employee’s conduct.\n\nQUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS\n\nWhat’s wrong with this impact statement?\n\nLarry, your repeated failure to be courteous to customers and co-workers has cost the company lots of money and harmed business.\n\nIdentify at least three possible job impact examples, which may be relevant in the above problem.\n\nHow would job impact be relevant in this situation?\n\nJack, a 21 year old record store clerk asked Jill, a 14 year-old female customer, for a date. Jack asks Jill not to tell anyone and arranges for the date to occur after he gets off work. Jack arranges for Jill to meet him in the mall food court, and then they go out to Jack’s car. They are caught by the police in the car and Jill is taken home by the officers. Jack is not arrested, but Jill’s mother reports the incident to the store manager.\n\nHow would job impact be relevant here?\n\nJerry, a senior security guard, was arrested and convicted for possession of marijuana while attending a party during non-work time on a Saturday evening. The arrest and conviction was reported extensively in the local newspapers. An essential requirement of Jerry’s job is to enforce the safety policies and procedures of the company. Jerry’s effectiveness as a security officer depends on his ability to gain the trust and respect of the\n\nco-workers and the public.\n\nHow would job impact be relevant here?\n\nMarion, a security guard, is responsible for monitoring the parking lot of a company under expansion. Last week, she left the parking lot without authorization during business hours. leaving the lot unsupervised for approximately 10 minutes. There was an eight-foot-deep excavation immediately adjacent to the lot into which visitors could have fallen if distracted by their activities. The excavation was separated from the lot by a fence with a ten-foot gate that remained open for the construction workers. The open gate gave visitors easy access to the excavation.\n\nSUGGESTIONS/DIRECTIVES\n\nSUMMARY\n\nLegally sufficient documentation requires an evaluator to give employees directions on the proper conduct expected to be followed AND to provide suggestions to assist the employee in complying with these directions.\n\nDirections must be clear and unequivocal and include effective time-lines and the consequences if the employee fails to comply.\n\nSuggestions for improvement are important to demonstrate that the employee was given adequate guidance and thus afforded a reasonable opportunity to improve.\n\nQUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS\n\nWhat’s wrong with these directives?\n\nI can see no reason why you should not be prepared to be at work at 7:30 a.m.\n\nIt would be better if you do not have your sales people stocking shelves during busy hours.\n\nI suggest that you follow the appropriate reporting procedures in the future.\n\nIn the future, you are directed to treat your co-workers with more respect.\n\nAs of this date, you are to refrain from using improper telephone manners.\n\nHow would you correct the above directives?\n\nWhy are clear and complete directives important?\n\nWhy is it important to include the consequences for failing to follow the\n\ndirections of an evaluator?\n\nWhat role does progressive discipline play in drafting the consequence?\n\nstatement?\n\nKNOWLEDGE\n\nSUMMARY\n\nDisciplinary memos are written as a result of employee misconduct or deficient performance. The purpose of such communication is to provide the employee with knowledge that the conduct or performance in question is unacceptable and to create a “paper trail” that such notice was given.\n\nIn the event of a subsequent suspension or dismissal where the employee challenges the action, an arbitrator, hearing officer, other third-party neutral, or court will focus on the following:\n\nHas the employee been put on notice that his/her performance or job conduct is unacceptable?\n\nHas that notice, if given, included specific examples of unacceptable performance or poor performance?\n\nHas the employee been specifically told what he/she must do in order to meet the employer’s standards?\n\nHas the employee been offered assistance in overcoming the noted deficiencies?\n\nHas the employee been put on notice of the possible consequences of failure to improve?\n\nHas the employee been given a fair opportunity to bring his/her performance or conduct up to an acceptable level?\n\nQUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS\n\nHow should you respond to this situation?\n\nYou have been informally recording concerns regarding the performance of Hap Liss, which have been maintained in your personnel file on the job site for the past six months. You have notified Hap of your concerns, but never provided him with any documentation. You determined three months ago that Hap’s performance deficiencies could serve as a basis for affecting employment status but didn’t think to include the documentation in his personnel file. Recently, Hap repeated the same unsatisfactory performance and you now want to include all your information into his personnel file.\n\nPROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe type of document selected by an evaluator to record unsatisfactory employee performance is dictated by the progressive discipline process. This process consists of a series of gradually harsher disciplinary steps, which generally includes the following sequence:\n\nOral Warning\n\nWritten Warning/ Letter of Reprimand\n\nFinal Warning\n\nSuspension Without Pay\n\nDismissal\n\nSteps may be repeated where the cause for disciplinary action requires persistent violation of a rule or where the evaluator wants to establish a pattern of deficient performance.\n\nSteps may be skipped based on the severity of the employee’s conduct subject to any limitations in labor contract provisions or company policies.\n\nCaution: Progressive discipline policies must be carefully drafted to avoid creating unexpected contractual obligations. Counsel should be consulted before any such policy in implemented.\n\nQUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS\n\nDo you agree with this evaluator’s progressive discipline approach?\n\nKaren, a delivery driver for Bob’s House of Books, failed to deliver to the School of Hard Knocks as noted in her delivery schedule. This is the second such occurrence during the past two months. The first time the evaluator discussed the problem with Karen. This time, the evaluator decided to dismiss Karen.\n\nWhat if Karen worked for a medical company instead and failed to deliver plasma to the City Hospital? Would the answer change if a patient died as a result?\n\nDo you agree with this evaluator’s approach?\n\nOver the past two months, Jay a maintenance worker failed to follow the evaluator’s directions on three occasions. As a result, Jay received oral warnings for the first two incidents and a written warning for the third incident. Recently, Jay again failed to follow the evaluator’s directions and the evaluator intends to recommend dismissal.\n\nDo you agree with this evaluator’s approach?\n\nMary, a truck driver, inadvertently backed her truck into another vehicle parked in the transportation yard. This is the first time Mary was involved in an accident while driving her truck. The labor contract prohibits an employee from receiving a letter of reprimand unless the employee first receives at least a written warning within the past 12 months except in ” extreme cases of willful misconduct…” The evaluator decided to issue a letter reprimand.\n\nWhat if Mary had just had an argument with her supervisor and said “You’ll see what happens when people make me angry.”\n\nFRISK MULTI-STEP NOTICE TEMPLATE\n\nSample –Employee Performance Notice\n\nEmployee Name_______________________Date__________\n\nSite/Position________________________________________\n\nFrom_________________________Title_________________\n\nThis notice is intended to inform you that you performance or conduct has not been satisfactory and the following action is being taken.\n\nWritten Warning c Final Warning c Suspension Without Pay c\n\nF On __/__/__ at Approx. ______ at (Location)_____________________\n\nyou were observed/reported by_____________________title_________\n\nto have engaged in the following conduct:\n\nR This constitutes_____________________________________________\n\nin violation of _____________________________________________\n\nYou previously violated this____________on_____________________.\n\nI Your conduct negatively impacted_____________________________\n\ninasmuch as ______________________________________________.\n\nS Effective this date you are directed to stop this conduct.
