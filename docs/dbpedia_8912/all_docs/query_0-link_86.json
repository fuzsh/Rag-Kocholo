Since then, however, the Washington court has abandoned its reliance on article I, section 7 in the stop and frisk context. This Comment examines this transition and concludes that the federal stop and frisk doctrine may not adequately protect fundamental privacy rights, and that the Washington court should return to independent state constitutional analysis to remedy this deficiency.",
