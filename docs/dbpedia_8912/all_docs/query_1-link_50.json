        "text": "Anthony “Tony” Wade Frisk\n\nPublished 12:01 am Saturday, September 3, 2022\n\nTony Frisk, aged 33 years, parts unknown, Loved Son, Brother & Uncle, left this world unexpectedly, last Friday afternoon.\n\nHis love for family, friends, his animals and his music knew no bounds. He possessed an endearing demeanor and booming voice that could not be mistaken. He will be missed, most assuredly as much by his family andfriends, as his animals. The simplest things in life were all that it took to make him happy, an evening spent with family and friends, or a song hitting the right note at just the right moment.\n\nHe leaves behind his mother, Celeste; his older siblings, Samantha and Barrett. He had no children of his own, but exemplified his love through his nieces, Izzabella, Presley and Elle.\n\nHis memory will live on long after the short time that we had with him.\n\nService will be held this Sunday, Sept. 4, 2022, at Hixson Sulphur Memorial Funeral Home at 1 p.m. Friends and family can pay their respects from 11 a.m. until 1 p.m. Any flowers or contributions can be sent to the funeral home for the family to receive.\n\nFond memories and expressions of sympathy may be shared at www.hixsonsulphurmemorial.com for the Frisk family."
