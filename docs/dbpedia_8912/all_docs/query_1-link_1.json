        "text": "@ 33Nepeta\n\nAlso, a little racist dont you think?\n\nNot at all. That is actually common misconception caused by stereotype about Asian people having literally yellow skin, which is false.\n\n@ Cookie-Owl\n\nNot really sure what you mean by how that works? People in real life can identify as nonbinary and prefer \"they\" pronouns, but still they are biologically either a boy or girl.\n\nSince sex term categorises people for males and females by their physical differences, which are given, the gender term describes someones personal choice how they want to be identified. However, the Undertale tells us nothing about Frisk's/Chara's physicality or their preferences/tastes/choices, so it was your choice based on your experiences to not only decide to make both of them girls, but also to assign gender role to them - nonbinary, which is someone who experiences their gender as both male and female, or experiences their gender as neither male nor female. Now, the question is, what made you to define them like that, what is the idea behind your thinking they are nonbinary girls?\n\nValid point. But yeah, yellow skin is something that I doubt is sickness.\n\nI am not saying Frisk is actually sick, but they having yellow skin would be more likely a symptom of sickness than effect of being a plastic lego figure.\n\n:p\n\nEDIT: Also, Frisk wears both blue, a color used for boys, and pink, color used for girls!\n\nWearing clothes with certain colors doesn't make someone a male/female. Also, some colors used for Frisk sprite are actually opposite versions of those used for Chara.\n\nRafip wrote:\n\n@ Cookie-Owl\n\nNot really sure what you mean by how that works?

Also, some colors used for Frisk sprite are actually opposite versions of those used for Chara.\n\nWell, there is no evidence for either of them being either gender. They're both children, I'm guessing pretty young and have not gone through puberty, so no features visible in their sprites are seen. I see them as nonbinary, as in the one identifying as no gender, since the pronouns NPCs used for them is \"they\". It's entirely possible the monsters didn't know Frisk's gender, but I feel like Chara would've told the Dreemurrs their gender that they identify as (though I do believe Chara wasn't evil and loved the Dreemurrs, so that is why I think so). Since Frisk and Chara are supposed to be equal to some degree, I feel they would identify as the same gender.\n\nAs for the color thing, I am aware that colors don't determine what your gender is. Considering that Frisk is most likely a young child, I think many kids around their age go with the stereotype that pink is for girls and blue is for boys. So for me, this represents that they don't care about what people think about gender and don't even care about gender, since they don't have one, which is what I believe. Chara's color on their clothes are colors not associated with gender, so they don't really care about gender either is what I believe.\n\nCookie-Owl wrote:\n\nRafip wrote:\n\n@ Cookie-Owl\n\nNot really sure what you mean by how that works?

How young? Well, Frisk is strong enough to kill a reindeer with a toy knife, so I'd say at least 12. 12 is highly unlikely anyway, but let's go on.\n\nI think many kids around their age go with the stereotype that pink is for girls and blue is for boys.\n\nAssuming Frisk is at least 12, I doubt this will apply. The only problem with us assuming Frisk is at least 12 is the pink/blue striped shirt. Besides being hard to find, that attire would be uncommon for someone of that age.\n\nChara's color on their clothes are colors not associated with gender, so they don't really care about gender either is what I believe.\n\nThis is like seeing an 8-year-old wearing green and deciding in your head, \"Oh, that kid isn't wearing pink or blue. They must be non-binary.\"\n\nBasically the thought process to get that result is pretty illogical, without any clear reason behind it."
