        "text": "How old is Frisk ?\n\nOne topic often debated about Frisk is the question of how old they are. With the fandom throwing around numbers anywhere between 5 and 16 without any real evidence, this post will attempt to give the most accurate answer possible based on game data and real world science.\n\nThere are three factors that can help determining Frisk’s age.\n\nThe first one is their physical appearance. The second one is their mentality, this ranges from Frisk’s personality to the things that they know or don’t or to their decision making process. The third one is how other characters treat Frisk and what they expect of them.\n\nWe know how average kids of any given age are like both mentally and physically, by comparing what we know of Frisk to this data, we can make an estimation of their age.\n\nFirst things first, there is one thing that the game makes extremely clear : Frisk is still a child, they are under 18.\n\nSeveral characters call Frisk a child.\n\nThey are also still young enough to be going to school, Toriel even mentions she could be their teacher.\n\nGerson too shares that same assumption of Frisk having the age to be going to school. Gerson has the times where humans and monsters lived together on the surface, he would know what humans of different ages would look like.\n\nFrisk also wears a striped shirt, which in the Undertale world is associated with children.\n\nThe question then becomes, how young of a child are they ?\n\nThe first thing to consider is that Frisk is able to read and write.\n\nReading is a skill usually developed by children around the ages of 4-5.\n\nWriting is where it gets more interesting. Going by their appearance and by the situation, Alphys believes that Frisk would have been able to have written this whole letter.\n\nThat letter was actually written by Undyne, an adult. And one that seemingly has a lot of experience at it too.\n\nThis means that Frisk looks old enough for Alphys to assume that they are able to write as well as an adult would in this situation or at least close enough to it for mistaking Undyne’s writing for Frisk’s to be reasonable.\n\nIt is also note worthy that Alphys, familiar with anime, could tell what a human child looks like compared to an older adult as well.\n\nThe narrator, who can read Frisk’s mind, also believes that they would be able to write letters.\n\nThis is reiterated by Mettaton in his fight, where he claims that Frisk could be able to write not just a letter but a whole book after the essay.\n\nWhile the very basics of writing comes at an earlier age, being able to write full meaningful sentences with proper punctuation doesn’t typically happen before age 7-10, this number can get even higher depending on the country.\n\nWriting skills comparable to that of adults as Frisk would supposedly have however, is something that typically comes in the 10-13 age range.\n\nConsidering that Alphys might have gotten to the conclusion that Frisk wrote the letter a bit too fast or that a writing “close enough” to it would probably suffice, i believe it would be justified to accept a year of margin of error on the younger spectrum for that last one. In any case, that would make Frisk at least 9 even if they had learned that skill at a younger age than average.\n\nThe next notable detail is that Frisk has no interest in toys at all. They are too old for this.\n\nChildren fully losing interest in traditional toys and stopping to use them is something that usually happens starting from their pre-teens or early teenage years.\n\nHowever when it comes to the topic of playing, considering that Toriel assumes that Frisk could still have fun by playing with the leaves, and that it appears she was correct, Frisk would seem to be more on the younger side of that spectrum.\n\nThis isn’t the only instance of Frisk having fun taking part in rather childish activities either. A teenager would most likely not do something like this :\n\nFrisk was also able to climb Mt Ebbot in the first place, which isn’t that small of a feat either.\n\nSans is pretty good at analysing people going by their faces. On a few occasions, he seems to be assuming that Frisk would find his jokes entertaining and thus and have a somewhat childish sense of humor like he does.\n\nSans also seemingly assumes Frisk would find those passwords funny as well, which a teenager would probably not.\n\nGyftrot assumes that Frisk is a teen during its fight as those who decorated it were also teens.\n\nGyftrot here is suffering from confirmation bias and isn’t a reliable source, however this does seem to hint that Frisk couldn’t be that far from teenage years either.\n\nOne of the things that is shown to us several times regarding Frisk’s personality is that they can be intimidated fairly easily.\n\nWhile the amalgamates are certainly a scary sight that could make this reaction understandable no matter Frisk’s age, Frisk doesn’t really have an excuse for being intimidated by a pie. One can hardly imagine a teen having this kind of reaction.\n\nAnother one of Frisk’s center of interest that is particularly relevant to this analysis is their odd affinity with flirting.\n\nWether it is with a monster they are willing to call mother, with a slime, with a ghost, with a skeleton or with a flying airplane, the flirting option appears considerably more than it reasonably should.\n\nWhat is also relevant is the way that Frisk flirts.\n\nSometimes, their flirting seems childish or on a joking tone.\n\nOn other instances however, Frisk shows that they know how to actually flirt for real if they want to. Complimenting physical appearance and interests. That is something they are able to do.\n\nWhilst Frisk’s flirting is obviously not actually serious, the fact that they ask burgerpants for romantic advice seems to say that they at least have somewhat of an interest in romance.\n\nAfter all, they did get the royal guard together thanks to their own idea and helped setting up Alphys and Undyne.\n\nStarting to develop an interest in romance but saying those things without any real intent behind what they say like Frisk does usually begins around pre-teens.\n\nWhat is also important when it comes to Frisk’s flirting is the way that other characters react to it.\n\nThey find Frisk’s flirting more “adorable” than anything. They cannot take Frisk’s flirting seriously because they are too young. If Frisk had been a teenager, these reactions wouldn’t make sense.\n\nThis means that Frisk is both old enough to flirt and to know what they are saying even if they do not really mean it and young enough for their attempts at flirting with adults to be cute or “adorable” rather than awkward.\n\nOnce again, this is something that the pre-teen range fits best. Any older would be too old.\n\nOne more interesting to note regarding Frisk is that they know about certain things in life that younger kids usually do not know about yet.\n\nFor instance, We have this dialogue that ended up not making it to the final game and staying as a ‘testmonster’ Froggit dialogue for… fairly obvious reasons.\n\nIm gonna have to agree on the narrator with that one. Jeez Frisk… Really ?\n\nIn any case, that is certainly not the kind of thing that any child younger than 10 years old would say. And even that is already an early age for this saying this type of stuff.\n\nWe have two other other instances of this that did actually make it into the final game however.\n\nSans makes a furry joke about Frisk, fully expecting them to know what a furry is and be able to get that joke. Again implying some amount of knowledge when it comes to this stuff.\n\nThe narrator also makes a similar joke about the royal guards.\n\nKeeping in mind that the narrator was shown to be able to read Frisk’s mind and that Frisk can hear them, they wouldn’t say this unless they knew that Frisk would be able to understand what their joke was about.\n\nFrisk knows this stuff.\n\nThe narrator in general does not treat Frisk like a smaller child either. For instance they do not mind using these kinds of words with their descriptions at all. They do not have any type of “im talking to a little kid” filter.\n\nThe next thing one would consider when it comes to finding Frisk’s age would be to find their height and compare it to that of real kids.\n\nDoes any of the artwork from Toby or Temmie allow to do this ?\n\nTemmie’s artwork is extremely unreliable when it comes to Frisk’s height. This is something that can be verified by attempting to measure different Frisk’s from Temmie’s arts.\n\nIn this artwork, Frisk’s height is that of a litteral toddler. A baby. This is obviously not accurate.\n\nThe whole point of concept art is to develop character design so that it can be used for a final product (here, the game). Since this art is focused on Papyrus and his puzzle, making them very big but Frisk very small is simply the most convenient way to work on Papyrus’ appearance and the puzzle’s design.\n\nIn this one however, they are slightly taller than Ness, who is 14 by the end of Earthbound.\n\nThe image with Ness also serves as a great example of the fact that drawing children as being very small no matter who it is or how old they are is one of the key points of Temmie Chang’s artstyle in general. This renders trying to find a characters’ height or age based on her art completely pointless, this is a dead end.\n\nBesides, her art isn’t even canon anyways.\n\nThat leaves us with only the game itself.\n\nWhen it comes to measuring the height or any part of the physical appearance of any Undertale character, the first thing to be aware of is that even if the game is obviously canon, the overworld sprites are not always accurate in terms of sprite size to what Toby’s intention was. This is because Toby put more intention into detail than into height accuracy. A good example of this happening is this scene.\n\nFlowey’s face obviously doesn’t actually canonically triple in size for a few seconds, this was done just for the sake of having a more detailed laugh sprite. Flowey isn’t taller than Frisk.\n\nWhile the overworld sprites remain good approximations in general, any measurement done with them has a pretty large margin of error due to both what we are measuring and the thing we measure it with possibly being height inaccurate.\n\nHowever, Frisk’s sprite was the sprite based on which the rest of the sprites of the game were built. In fact, Toby didn’t add any proper sprites aside from Frisk’s sprites until the demo was basically finished.\n\nThis means that Frisk’s sprite is actually one of the only sprite in all of Undertale that we know actually is accurate in terms of height, and thus can be measured.\n\nbut lets not go too fast, there is still a problem.\n\nThe problem is that whatever we choose to measure Frisk with could itself be height inaccurate, which would render the results unreliable anyways.\n\nFor instance, basketballs have a standard size in real life, but since those basketball were made bigger than they should in UT for detail purposes, measuring Frisk with a basketball would thus make them seem much smaller than they really are.\n\nFor this same reason, measuring Frisk with a door, the human from the intro sequence, a fridge or pretty much anything at all makes for a flawed result.\n\nThis problem is easy to see from the fact that all of these attempts at calculating Frisk’s height with pixel measurement made by fans over the years ended up with different answers. To illustrate this, here are some tries from other people over the years who made this exact mistake :\n\nIf the reference isn’t accurate, then neither will be the result.\n\nThe only way to get a Frisk measurement that would actually be accurate would be to measure them by using as a reference something that is outright specifically called out by the game as being size accurate as well in addition to having standardised real world dimensions.\n\nSo… Do we have something like that anywhere in the game ?\n\nWow, thanks Toby for not making my life difficult this once.\n\nAlright so by using this specifically-regular-sized sink as a measurement system, Frisk ends up being 1m47cm (4ft 10) tall.\n\n(Turns out the Temmie one actually had it right after all…)\n\nBy comparing this to the average height of a child relative to their age, we find Frisk is slightly taller than the average 11 year old. In other words, they are right in the middle of the pre-teen range, which already had a lot of evidence pointing towards it.\n\nThere is another thing that needs to be pointed out. Children of male and female sex do not always have the same average height depending on age, starting from 14, children of male sex tend to get taller.\n\nThus, making Frisk 13 or younger allows them to look more androgynous, which is something that we know Toby was trying to do with Frisk’s design.\n\nFrom their personality and behavior to how other characters treat them passing by their knowledge and capacities or their height, Frisk is implied several times to be at least 10 but also to not have reached teenage years yet.\n\nThus, Frisk would be somewhere in their pre-teens."
