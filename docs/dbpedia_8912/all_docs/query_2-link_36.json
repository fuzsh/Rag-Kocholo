As our intern reached for his first glass, he inadvertently grabbed the boss, who said,\n\n“What’s this, mate? You tasting wine, or FRISKING me?”\n\nNervous laughter all around.\n\nHe eventually located his glass, and claimed he liked the way it “prickled his palate.” We had a taste for ourselves, and agreed. Looked to the boss, who also agreed. Winery intern redeemed.\n\nRelieved laughter all around.\n\nAnd so it was that hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars were not spent trying to come up with a name for our new wine.\n\nAnd the boss went for it, which is the gold ticket, right?\n\nWho are you people?\n\nWe’ve been called “mavericks,” “young guns,” and a lot of other things we can’t print for fear our mums will see, but basically, we’re an eclectic team of winemakers who believe wine is for enjoying. Period. Full stop.\n\nWe don’t try to baffle you with terms you’ve never heard of. We just make delicious wine with a unique prickle to it. If it tastes a bit like nectarines, we tell you “this tastes a bit like nectarines.” If it tastes a little like limes, or minerals? That’s what we’ll say. But when it comes down to it, we think reading about wine is like painting about music.\n\nYou should probably go try some at this point. We really do hope you enjoy it. We’d hate to have to get real jobs.\n\nThat’s Not An Alp. This Is An Alp.\n\nBeing sick to death of sailing and having not much else to do, they started climbing. And climbing.

This zippy Riesling is floral and delightful, with notes of lime sorbet, nectarine and a floral lilt - and low alcohol to support its light body - only 10% abv.\n\nDelivering racy verve, subtle complexity and just a tinge of sweetness - it’s a perfect companion for both sweet and spicy dishes or simply on its own. Refreshingly complex on the palate, it will make you wonder how you emptied your glass so quickly - and have you reaching for another.\n\nWant Some? you know you do.
