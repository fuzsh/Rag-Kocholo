        "text": "Born and raised in Santa Cruz, CA, Weston Frisk completed a double major in history and German language at Washington and Lee University in Virginia. The liberal arts emphasis at Washington and Lee allowed him to explore a range of intellectual topics. Besides history and German courses, Weston supplemented his academics with courses in politics, philosophy and economics. Spring 2009 he studied at the University of Bayreuth in Bavaria as an exchange student â€“ an experience that remains a highlight of his undergraduate experience.\n\nWeston is excited about this opportunity for graduate research in the MAGIS program and to advance his academic enthusiasms and continue intellectual conversations about the globalization of the modern world.\n\nWeston studied at the London School of Economics and at the American University in Cairo during his study abroad in summer/fall 2012.\n\nWeston completed his degree with his thesis, \"The Vanguards of Islamism: Origins, Histories, and Ideologies of the Society of Muslim Brothers in Egypt.\""
