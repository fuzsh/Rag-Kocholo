        "text": "Frisk was an abandoned child\n\nWe know very little of the past of the fallen humans in Undertale. Even Frisk, the main character of the game, has only little confirmed information about them.\n\nWhilst no official answer has been given regarding their past, there are however a number of clues in the game that seem to point to a certain direction.\n\nFrisk exists as their own individual outside of the player, and in those instances where Frisk acts or talks on their own free will, they leave hints concerning their own personality, likes, dislikes, fears, and what appears to be hints of their past.\n\nHere is something that Frisk asks Gerson on their own after a true pacifist ending.\n\nWhen Gerson tells them about boss monster’s ability to not age as long as they do not have a child, they ask Gerson wether this would still work if Asgore had a human as a child. The child in question is clearly meant to be them, which Gerson notices. This implies that Frisk doesn’t have a father.\n\nNote that this happens at a time where Asgore had almost tried to kill them very recently, and only shortly after he apologised for it.\n\nEven as a king and as Toriel’s ex husband, its unlikely Frisk would consider searching for a father figure in such a person this soon unless they really lacked one.\n\nWe actually get to see the exact same thing happening with Frisk’s supposed mother as well. This time with Toriel.\n\nConsidering that the last stranger they met literally tried to steal their soul, it is quite odd that Frisk starts trusting Toriel almost immediatly.\n\nToriel is someone that Frisk has met mere minutes ago at this point, but she has presented herself as a reassuring and kind figure. She helped them against potential danger three times already (Flowey, Froggit and the spike puzzle) and she calls them “my child”.\n\nThose are all traits of a mother figure, and here we see that despite her being a literal goat monster they just met, they are already considering calling her mother. Worse, they sound happy doing do according to Toriel herself.\n\nOnce again, the fact that they are happily ready to take as a mother figure and even call “mother” anyone who presents motherly traits even if its someone they barely know shows that Frisk doesn’t have someone that they consider a mother already.\n\nMoreover, they consider staying with Toriel post pacifist, which they definitly wouldn’t do if they had a real loving mother waiting for them at home.\n\nTherefore its very likely Frisk doesn’t have a mother either.\n\nWith that, it appears extremely probable that Frisk is an orphan.\n\nBut if Frisk has no parents, does that mean they live on their own ?\n\nNot quite, it seems Frisk does have a place to return to by the time the game takes place (more on that later).\n\nHowever, Frisk lacks a protective figure, and as such they still do have to take care of themself often. This is something that we see in the game as well through a few hints Frisk leaves.\n\nFirst off, Frisk starts off with a bandage with them, implying that they got hurt. More even, checking the bandage shows that they must get hurt quite often.\n\nAnother big thing to note here, they used the same bandage several times, this implies getting money for new bandages isn’t something Frisk is able to do easily, and by extension that they are not taken very good care of if no adult was willing to pay something as simple as this for them.\n\nWe also see this the following with one of the SAVE points in the ruins.\n\nWhich looks like its implying that this is not a usual sight for Frisk. They do not live in this kind of house on the surface.\n\nSo, if Frisk doesn’t live in a house like this and doesn’t live with their parents, what happened ?\n\nWell, when taking a look at Frisk’s actions on their own outside of the player or Chara. There is a recurring theme, one that appears way too many times throughout the entire game to be a coincidence : Frisk keeps on hinting at things related to abandonment and not being cared for.\n\nThere is one item in Undertale that is directly linked to the concept of abandonment, and Frisk just so happens to have very weird interactions with this specific item : The abandoned quiche. Frisk appears to be projecting on the quiche several times when interacting with it.\n\nWhen an item is dropped, normally we get the narration\n\n<item> was thrown away\n\nBut with this item in particular, instead of the narration talking about leaving the quiche behind like usual. Frisk does something extremely weird and extremely specific, and they do it on their own will without any input from the player.\n\nThe implications on Frisk are pretty grim…\n\nThere is more to this, if attempting to pick up the quiche with a full inventory, the message we will get appears to be a hint at the other side of this story : That of their parents.\n\nFrisk’s inventory is full and they are incapable of dealing with the quiche due to already having too many other things to take care of. This message and situation seems to be a parallel to Frisk’s parents not being able to handle raising a child as they already have too many problems to deal with. Thus, they weren’t ready for the responsability of having to care take of Frisk.\n\nAs for what comes next. Well, in the room in which the abandoned quiche is located in particular, the flavor text for dropping items is different.\n\nUnlike any other room in the game, the default flavor text says that the item was abandoned instead.\n\nInstead of the usual\n\n<item> was thrown way\n\nIf we interact with the quiche, but that instead of taking it back with us, we abandon on the bench of leave the room without it. We leave the quiche in the same position as Frisk’s parents left them, which is also reflected via the flavor text.\n\nThe fact that the line ends with “…” instead of a simple full stop also hints that there is more meaning to this line than a mere statement of fact.\n\nTalking about Frisk being all alone, the famous “but nobody came” line supports this idea as well.\n\nThe original “but nobody came” line comes from Flowey, after he found himself all alone in the garden and tried to call for his parents to help him, but nobody came.\n\nKeeping this in mind, the times where Frisk does it start hitting different.\n\nThey all feel very similar to what an abandoned child calling for help would be like, especially that last one.\n\nNext up, the description of the abandoned quiche also says something very strange.\n\n“Psychologically damaged”\n\n…What an odd term to describe a pie, unless its meant to be a hint towards something else instead as the previous texts seem to imply. This term makes much more sense as a way to describe the trauma of an abandoned child that was left all alone by those meant to take care of them.\n\nThis is all the dialogue that the quiche has in the final version of the game, however the quiche has some unused dialogue from 2013. And those dialogues were also pointing towards this same direction as well.\n\nThis one is an unused dialogue for throwing away the quiche. And it provides a lot of information. The idea of abandoning the quiche causes a strong personal reaction from Frisk, they have what appears to be a kind of psychological barrier that considers this idea of abandoning it as something horrible. Something that shouldn’t be done.\n\nMore even, it is said that the reason for this psychological barrier is non other than shame. Frisk refuses to abandon the quiche because they have reasons to consider abandonment to be a shameful act. One that causes a tremor of shame to run through their body at the mere thought of it.\n\nThis isn’t the reaction of someone who merely considers that as morally wrong, but rather that of someone who has experienced it themself. If the previous dialogues weren’t making it clear that Frisk was projecting, this one certainly does.\n\nAnother unused dialogue for the quiche that was likely meant to be played later on after abandoning the quiche states the following :\n\nThis is practically confirmation that the quiche is a metaphor for something else, a quiche obviously doesn’t actually have a ”worst fear” that gets realised after being abandoned.\n\nNot to mention, the narrator couldn’t know what happened to the quiche in that case. However, the narrator is shown to be able to read Frisk’s thoughts :\n\nIf the metaphor is indeed about Frisk themself, then this suddenly makes much more sense. As for the “fear” in question itself, its most likely refering to this :\n\nToby Fox also refered to Frisk as a lost child through Flowey in the kickstarter teaser.\n\nWhilst this is likely refering to Frisk being lost in the underground more than anything else, it wouldn’t be surprising for this line to have a double meaning.\n\nTo follow on how the quiche’s check seemed to hint that Frisk had been “psychologically damaged” by what happened to them, we can actually see that in the game a few times during certain encounters. Frisk has some strong reactions on a few occasions which seem to point at this as well.\n\nFor a first exemple, Frisk is shown several times to be a good person in general, but there are a few times where they seemingly snap for no apparent reason. For example they can say this to Snowdrake :\n\nThis seems very strange and kinda out of nowhere coming from Frisk, until you realise that they just so happen to say this to Snowdrake in particular, a monster who has a broken family and where the child lives without the parents.\n\nIt isn’t just a coincidence or a one time thing either, it happens again a second time in Hotland with Vulkin.\n\nVulkin just so happens to be the monster that believes its attacks are helpful and can heal you.\n\nVulkin is someone that should be helping them get better when they need it but that actually hurt Frisk with its actions instead. Once again there are some parallels to be drawn here with Frisk’s parents.\n\nConsidering the things they say to these two monsters when Frisk is reminded of their parents or the fact that they do not appear to have a good self esteem, it is quite possible that Frisk’s parents might have been verbally abusive to them.\n\nIn fact, those things they say to those monsters might have been things Frisk has been told before. Would Frisk really spontaneously come up with this on their own from a simple “Heckle” ?\n\nFrisk also considers shoes as being a “dangerous” weapon… Whilst this single line isn’t enough evidence for it, the possibility that this could be implying is certainly worth consideration as Frisk’s parents don’t seem to have been particularly good people.\n\nIn any case, it seems that Frisk on the surface did not have a very happy life.\n\nThey also appear to talk about trash and garbage way more often than they probably should, they already insult Vulkin by comparing its rump to trash, but its in the garbage dump that things get really strange.\n\nFrisk seems to hold a certain connexion with garbage. They appear to be familiar with it, perhaps too familiar with it ?\n\nDigging through garbage is something perfectly normal to them.\n\nThey do this multiple times…\n\nIn fact, getting money through questionable ways isn’t a first time either. They steal the money from the couch of the skeleton’s house without giving the player a choice.\n\nAs implied by the bandage already, looks like money isn’t something Frisk had easy access to on the surface.\n\nBut where it gets really strange is this :\n\nThey also… enjoy feeling like garbage ?\n\nAnd being surrounded by garbage is.. reassuring to them somehow ?\n\nAgain it all seems way too normal for Frisk. Like if sleeping on the ground with garbage was something they had done before.\n\nSince after being abandoned Frisk would have been completely alone for some time, they must have found a way to survive one way or another, digging through garbage is something they seem to have done in the past. The pieces do fit together as grim of a prospect as this is… It certainly explains their familiarity with garbage.\n\nThe drop texts are also particularly intriguing. Instead of the normal drop texts, we sometimes get special strange drop texts :\n\n“You bid a quiet farewell to the <item>”\n\n“You put the <item> on the ground and gave it a little pat”\n\n“You threw the <item> on the ground like the piece of trash it is”\n\n“You abandoned the <item>”.\n\nWhat is relevant about this is its comparison with Deltarune.\n\nin Deltarune, Kris has the same drop texts as those above minus some minor formatting differences, but the odds of getting those special texts are 1/60, 1/30, 1/30 and 1/30 respectively.\n\nFor Frisk in Undertale however, these odds are much higher, sitting at 1/36, 1/18, 1/18 and 1/18 instead. (except in the abandoned quiche’s room) Almost twice as likely.\n\nIn other words, these drop texts that are related to trash and abandonment just so happen to have more importance for Frisk than for Kris. Frisk in particular is once again shown to have a strange connection with those things.\n\nBy the time Undertale takes place, we do know that Frisk does have a place to call “home”, although not with their parents.\n\nEven though they do have a place to return to, they also consider the option of not going back and staying with Toriel instead.\n\nIf Frisk did have parents waiting for them, considering to stay with Toriel just wouldn’t make any sense.\n\nWherever Frisk currently lives is a place that they can call “home” but that they do not have particular ties to either aside from not really having anywhere else to be and where they still aren’t taken particularly good care of either if they cannot obtain bandages.\n\nIf they do end up finding somewhere else to live, they do not have a reason to go back there anymore.\n\nGoing by this observation and the previous hypothesis, it seems likely that this place to return to would be a kind of orphanage. It fit very well and it would only make sense for Frisk to have eventually ended up in one after being left to fend for themself."
