        "text": "In order to take that view, one must first assume–without help from the game–that there exists an outside force that exerts their will on these characters despite the characters themselves and the world not acknowledging such a creature. And what’s more, we must begin to believe that Frisk is utterly without will and agency of their own. We must believe they are a helpless baby that must be coddled and moved forward, who is utterly helpless and powerless to make a choice under their own power.\n\nI honestly do not think a child with enough raw determination to wave away death itself like a pushy salesman would be that sort of person.\n\nWe receive no indication that makes us believe that Frisk is inherently a good-hearted individual, except that , when we do good things, they do good as well. Their actions seem to reflect the kind of person who would have done the things we’ve done, the friends we’ve spared … or the people we’ve hurt. Don’t forget that. For every sign they’re good in pacifist, you can find horrible things in the Kill-All. The only constant about Frisk is their raw, incredible determination.\n\nUndertale is about, to me, how ‘anyone can be a good person if they just try.’ The story of Undertale is so much stronger when we consider Frisk to be not our avatar, but instead a troubled child struggling with whether or not to do the right thing, whether or not to be a good person. Doesn’t that fit better with the themes? The judgment at the end with Sans? Undertale doesn’t bother with questions of ‘free will’ and ‘agency.’ Meta games that do usually start to talk about how paths are predetermined and how really characters have no choice.\n\nUndertale doesn’t, though. It’s all ABOUT choice. It’s all about free will. It’s asking … Can you do the right thing? Can you take responsibility? Can even the worst person change, if they just try? Can Asriel change, even after becoming a time-hopping serial murderer, if he just wants to? Can Chara change?\n\n…\n\nCan Frisk?\n\nWhen you think that Frisk is ‘naturally good,’ you … Well. You lose something important. Suddenly, Frisk is literally the ONLY character in the Underground who is not wrought with internal storms about how and whether to do good. Everyone else is troubled, everyone else makes mistakes, everyone else hurts the people around them and does sometimes negligent, sometimes stupid, sometimes skin-crawlingly horrific things. But, Frisk is supposed to be naturally kind? Their ‘true nature’ is one that will always lead them to a good ending and happy everyone if we just step out of the way?\n\nI don’t think so. That doesn’t fit with everyone else. It makes Frisk unique in that even at their very worst everything they do is either good or has no extensive bad consequences for themselves or anyone else. And that doesn’t feel right at all."
