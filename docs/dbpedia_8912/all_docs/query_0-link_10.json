        "text": "Stop Characteristics\n\nOnce a civilian is stopped, the NYPD may “frisk” the external clothing of an individual if the officer has a reason to believe the person stopped has a weapon that poses a threat to the officer’s safety or “search” the individual or their belongings if the officer has probable cause to believe that the individual is engaged in criminal activity. A stop may also involve an officer using physical “force” against the civilian. Civilians who are stopped may be given a summons (a violation, like a ticket) or arrested if the police find evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people stopped by the NYPD have been innocent, meaning the NYPD found no evidence of wrongdoing and the civilian was not given a summons or arrested.\n\nAccording to the NYPD’s Annual Reports:\n\nin 2023, 16,971 stops were
