        "text": "[Spoiler] Hypothesis: Frisk is Chara\n\nAfter completing a second pacifist run and discussing who Chara was in a thread encouraging people to take the genocide route, I think I may have gathered enough information to finally wager an assumption that may affect your outlook on the game as a whole. If you haven't done the pacifist ending AND at least read up details found during the genocide route, you shouldn't read any further.\n\nWARNING: This is going to be a very long-winded discussion. I hope you can follow me on this one.\n\nBandage, Mummification, Burial at the Ruins\n\nLet's get right into it by starting with the coffins found in New Home, near Asgore's throne room. You can only examine one, and it's the coffin with the player's written name etched on it. The coffin's description changes based on if you did a genocide or pacifist run.\n\nPacifist mentions that you only just noticed that there are mummy wraps inside, implying someone used to be in there, but not anymore.\n\nGenocide mentions \"It's as comfortable as it looks\", implying you've been in there before.\n\nYou may be asking: \"Okay, so what does that have to do with anything?\" Do you remember what your first armor was at the start of the game? It was a bandage, with a description that state it has been used several times before. And given Papyrus's description when he calls and asks what you're currently wearing, he calls it \"gross bandage\", implying that it has seen a lot of use. There is no backstory on your character when the game starts that explains why you have that bandage equipped, but given its use as a healing item, you certainly weren't wearing it for protection.\n\nChara was originally laid to rest in a coffin after being brought back home by Asriel. It's later implied by Flowey that Toriel had taken Chara's body and buried them in the ruins. This ties together the mention of mummy wraps in the coffin during the pacifist ending, as Toriel likely ripped most of the bandages off of the body before taking them away.\n\nRuins\n\nYou also wake up in a patch of flowers. From a new player's perspective, the patch can be seen as the only thing that broke your fall in the ruins. When Chara was brought back to the village after he died, Asriel set their body down on a bed of flowers, before the villagers arrived to attack him. When Chara's body was taken away by Asriel as they fled the village, it was after Chara was set down on the patch of flowers. In the true lab, it's mentioned a flower's seeds are very clingy and sticky. These same flowers are the ones you see in the ruins. This means the seeds clung onto them all the way back to the underground. And the flower patch you see when you begin the game? Those might've grown from the seeds still on your corpse!\n\nWaterfall\n\nNow, skip ahead to the part where you're backed into a corner by Undyne at a bridge in Waterfall, where she uses her magic spears to break off the dead end you stood on, sending you plummeting into the abyss. Before you wake up at the garbage dump, you start to recollect a memory, where Asriel finds [your written name] and you wake up just before Asriel can tell you his name. Suspicious, is it not? If you really are new to the underground and are completely unrelated to the events of the past, there is no reason that YOU should be able to recollect this memory you have no relation to.\n\nAnd let's not forget the part when you find yourself, once again, laying on a bed of yellow flowers. Looking back at what I wrote earlier, it could be the result of more seeds still on your body that grew into a patch while you were unconscious. The whole area is mostly covered in water, which is clearly seen when you hop off the patch and find half of your body submerged. That means the flower patch could've only grown on the remnants of the bridge that collapsed with you. Seems fast for a patch of flowers to grow, no matter how long you might have been unconscious, but in the underground world of magic, anything is possible.\n\nSkip even further ahead where you come back to visit Undyne and become friends. When you select tea, there's a description saying it's the obvious choice. When you pick the tea, she mentions that goldenrod flower tea happens to be Asgore's favorite drink. Who else, besides Undyne, could possibly know that? Toriel could, because she was married to him at one point. The other option would be Asriel and Chara, his children. I understand it's weak evidence, but given the subtle plot twists the devs have shown to make, is it possible that tea being \"the obvious choice\" is because you're recollecting another memory of the past, that Asgore has made obvious how much he loves that tea around his family?\n\nCapital\n\nNow we're going to go back for a moment to recall the fight with Asgore during the forced neutral route. If you were being a pacifist all the way up to him, you have the option to talk. When you firmly tell him to stop fighting, this results in him lowering his attack and defense. Why? It's because he was remembering things about the past. If it's true, that you are not who you think you are, the reason Asgore's defenses lowered is because he knows he's fighting Chara, his adopted son. And somehow, you know this as well. It's revealed later, when you fight Asgore again without Flowey showing up, that he sees the same spark of hope in your eyes just like what he saw in the first human who fell.\n\nIf you were trying to be genocidal during the forced neutral route, you can kill Flowey at the very end. What does he say? \"I knew you had it in you!\" Before \"dying\", leaving the flower soulless. It can be assumed that you, as a legit newcomer, were being goaded by Flowey into following his philosophy of 'kill or be killed'. At the same time, it can also be assumed that Flowey knew you are Chara, and killing him only proves that you've never changed.\n\nSkip back to the pacifist final battle against Omega Asriel. During the whole battle, he talked about how much he loved you as a sibling, that he thought you were the most interesting person he's ever known. He explained that he was destroying the universe itself, space and time, all of it, for you. He didn't want you to leave again, he wanted this moment to last forever. Near the end, he pleaded for you to just let him win, so he can be happy to have you again. Asriel was spoon feeding every single detail about you without you knowing it!\n\nPacifist/Genocide\n\nSo, who are you? If you really are Chara, who is Frisk?\n\nIt's simple: Frisk is Chara! The time spent merged with Asriel's soul may have given Chara empathy and compassion for all living things, to regret their desire to destroy the villagers when they tried to deliver their body to the bed of flowers. When you found yourself in the ruins again, you donned a new name, created a new identity to become friends with all monsters and prove that humans aren't all evil and can try to correct their mistakes. You wanted to become a better sibling to Asriel. You became Frisk, Chara reborn!\n\nOkay, so that covers the pacifist explanation. What about genocide?\n\nI want to start by saying I never did the genocide route. This is based only from reading up on details about it in wikis and guides as well as gathering info from other forumers who played it.\n\nIt's believed that the real Chara possessed you, taking you over and doing their will. The reality of it is this: Chara didn't possess your character, because your character is Chara. After having gained incredible LV, Chara has become powerful to the point that you can no longer control them. With your guidance through the genocide route, they understood why they had been reincarnated: Power. Your desire to destroy anything that dares cross your path has given Chara a new purpose.\n\nAnd who was there to try and reason with you? To hope that maybe there is some shred of humanity left in you? To stop you from becoming a remorseless \"demon\"? Sans. He fought you in the hopes that maybe if there was some remaining shred of kindness you still had for the world, you would heed to it and let him stop you from making the greatest mistake of your life. He hoped to snap you out of your madness before it consumes you in its entirety.\n\nBut it wasn't enough. Chara gained the last remaining power they needed and finally assumed full control.\n\nResurrection (and \"angel\" souls)\n\nFinally, what I'm sure all of you are waiting for: If the player really is Chara, how did they come back to life? I don't have very much evidence on this part and can only make assumptions based on something Evil Chara mentions after a second genocide run. After a second genocide run, Evil Chara says that they're a demon that only arrives when people call their name. While you can disregard it as Chara being self-absorbed, it does explain why you wake up in the ruins. Remember the name you wrote at the start of the game? It isn't your name, it is Chara's. And it is this name Flowey used to call them back. Chara heard Flowey and, out of love for their sibling, they returned. For good or for bad, Chara was called back to life by Flowey.\n\nA recent conversation with a forum user has shed some new light on what allowed Chara to return. The following is mostly speculation from what little evidence is present in the game.\n\nHumans and monsters are extremely different from one another. Monsters are creatures whose body and soul are completely magical, their lives are dictated by love and kindness for others as explained in the library. This makes monsters weaker in physical capability and persistence, as their souls perish instantly or after a few moments if they're boss monsters. Humans, however, are creatures of physical (water-based) composition which gives them much greater determination and strength. Unlike monsters, humans aren't driven by any sense of empathy or compassion, allowing them to make good or bad choices. Their souls also persist forever, most likely caused by their much greater determination, making them much stronger than monsters overall.\n\nSo what happens if you combine the magical love and compassion of monsters with the physical determination and strength of humans?\n\nWhen a monster's soul is combined with a human's, the merged result transcends to a higher state that is far greater than either one that made it. I call it an \"angel\" soul in memory of the delta rune. Angel souls share the same traits of both monsters and humans, a heightened sense of compassion and love, increased power and free will, a hybridization of physical and magical.\n\nThis brings into consideration how Asriel now had the power to destroy the humans in the village when he carried Chara's body there. It also explains how you/Frisk/Chara and Flowey both have the ability to control timelines through saving and resetting, because it's a power that only angel souls can wield! The same can be said for evil Chara during the genocide run, the power to erase entire worlds and steal souls was obtained through the combined power of human and monster souls that you still possess even after death.\n\nIt's quite possible evil Chara was correct when they said they're a \"demon\" who arrives when others call their name. They believe themself to be a demon because of the power given to them by the \"angel\" soul, but was driven to do evil deeds with it. You are Chara, thus you can return when someone calls your name, allowing you to become the angel prophesized by the delta rune!"
