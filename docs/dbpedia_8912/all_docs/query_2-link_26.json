        "text": "“ Frisk: Fills the Battle With Determination! ” —Introductory tagline\n\nFrisk\n\nFrisk's in game sprite from Undertale.\n\nUniverse Undertale Debut Undertale (2015) Smash Bros. appearances SSBU Console/platform of origin Microsoft Windows, MacOS Species Human Gender Unspecified Place of origin Surface Created by Toby Fox Article on WikiBound Frisk\n\nFor fighter info, see Frisk (SSBU).\n\nFrisk is the main protagonist of Toby Fox's highly successful indie RPG game Undertale. Frisk is a human child whos gender is unspecified, who embarks on an adventure in the Underground to return to the surface.\n\nCharacter discription[edit]\n\nFrisk is the last of the eight humans to fall into the Underground on Mount Ebott. Frisk meets Flowey who pretends to give honest advice, but then he attempts to kill Frisk. Toriel then comes and rescues Frisk by hitting Flowey with fire magic, then she guides Frisk through the Ruins.\n\nAfter Frisk travels through the Ruins they arrive at Toriel's home. Here Toriel battles Frisk to proove that Frisk is able to survive outside of the Ruins. Afterwards Frisk travels throughout the Underground to find their way out.\n\nThere are three endings that depend on how Frisk dealt with monsters. The Neutral Route is taken if some but not all monsters were killed: during the battle against Flowey, Frisk calls for help from the seven human souls to defeat Flowey, then afterwards has the ability to spare or kill Flowey before returning to the surface.\n\nThe Genocide Route is taken if Frisk kills every monster they encounter. Many characters comment that Frisk has a creepy smile throughout the route, and seemingly Chara had control of Frisk. Sans comments that it would be great if Frisk continued pretending to be a human, and Asgore inquires what kind of monster Frisk is. At the end Sans attempts to stop Frisk from continuing in a final battle in the Last Corridor. Sans dodges all of Frisk's attacks until the end, where he simply does not attack and makes his turn last forever, making the only way to defeat him being to let him fall asleep. Then Frisk kills the sleeping Sans, then kills Flowey, and that causes Chara to appear, who gives Frisk the option to \"ERASE\" the world or \"DO NOT\"; both lead to the same result, however.\n\nThe True Pacifist Route is taken if Frisk spares and befriends all of the monsters, and after the Neutral Route is completed. At the end of the route Flowey stole the SOULs of the six other humans. He attempts to kill Frisk, but is stopped by Undyne, Toriel, Alphys, Asgore, Sans, and Papyrus. Then Flowey transforms into his true form after gaining immense power from the souls, he then is revealed to actually be Asriel Dreemurr. He then battles Frisk, who is completely invincible to all his attacks. Then Frisk \"saves\" everyone, including Asriel. After that, Asriel reverts back to his child form, apologizing for all that he has done, and Frisk frees everyone and they all return to the Surface.\n\nIn Super Smash Bros. Ultimate[edit]\n\nAs a playable character[edit]\n\nMain article: Frisk (SSBU)\n\nAnnounced on April 1, 2020, Frisk is the second DLC fighter to be part of the Fighter Pass vol. 2. Frisk is notably the first character from an indie game to be a playable character. Frisk was revealed to be released in July 2020 shortly after the unnamed ARMS character.\n\nSpirits[edit]"
