For such families, the shores of Ireland, Australia, and the New World beckoned. They left their homeland at great expense in ships that were overcrowded and full of disease. Many arrived after the long voyage sick, starving, and without a penny. But even those were greeted with greater opportunity than they could have experienced back home. Numerous English settlers who arrived in the United States and Canada at this time went on to make important contributions to the developing cultures of those countries. Many of those families went on to make significant contributions to the rapidly developing colonies in which they settled. Early North American records indicate many people bearing the name Frisk were among those contributors:\n\nFrisk Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nMargery Frisk, who arrived in Virginia in 1622 3\n\nJohn Frisk, who arrived in New England in 1645 3\n\nFrisk Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nEal Frisk, who arrived in Pennsylvania in 1788 3\n\nFrisk Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nH.
