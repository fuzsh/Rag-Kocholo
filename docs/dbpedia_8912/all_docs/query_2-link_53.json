        "text": "Now, besides sans there are a few other Undertale CHARActers that Undertale fans want for Smash. Mettaton and Undyne are some of the other requested Undertale fighters. But I want to do Frisk. And I am not making the same mistake twice by doing a duplicate character thread. NOTE: Frisk's gender is often debated but just for simplicity's sake, I will be calling Frisk/Chara \"They\"\n\nWho is Frisk?\n\nFrisk is the main protagonist (or antagonist) of the Indie hit, Undertale.\n\nWhy? I would love Undertale to get some representation. After all, Undertale is one of the most popular Indie games. In fact, it reached in the top 100 in IGN. It is also based heavily on the Mother series which hasn't had a fighter since brawl being Lucas who is basically Ness but freezes. Although sans would be a good fighter. Frisk would be a bit more fitting since Frisk is the character you control.\n\nMoveset\n\nTheir main weapon is the toy knife. They will use it for most of her standard attacks.\n\nSpecial Attacks NYEH HEH HEH HEH! For her Normal Special, she throws her Worn Dagger at the opponent.\n\nFor their Side-Special, her soul turns yellow and shoots little bullets.\n\nTheir Down-Special is a deflect move (since that seems to be a move a lot of fighters have) similar to Shulk's Vision. They get hit but hits the reset button to counter the attack.\n\nFor their Up-Special, they use their Jetpack from their upgraded cell phone.\n\nSmash Attacks! For their Up Smash, they use the Empty Gun.\n\nFor their Down-Special, they will do the splits while wearing Ballet Shoes.\n\nTheir Side-Special is very similar to Peach's, they swing the following items: The Stick (doing the least damage), Tough Glove (medium damage but is not a swing but a punch), Burnt Pan (does the most damage), and the Torn Notebook (does the same damage as the stick, but gives you invulnerability. This is the rarest among the 4).\n\nFINAL SMASH! They have to be close to the opponent, then the screen shows the normal Undertale battle screen with the sprite of the opponent getting slash with a 9999.\n\nSHIELD! Their soul turns green.\n\nVictory Animations! Frisk is petting a napping white dog, Frisk is shown with the Fight and Mercy buttons deciding, and Frisk eating some Butterscotch Pie.\n\nOther Stuff!\n\nALT COSTUMES! I would just LOVE it if, not only would they have Chara as an alt skin, but also some from AU's. The Undertale community is one a lot of people hate because of a few \"fans\" have done some really bad stuff (basically like the Waluigi community). But the Undertale community is, in my opinion, the most creative and have done amazing work. Anyways here are the Alt Costumes: Normal skin Frisk (in other words, not yellow) , Chara ,\n\nBetty from Glitchtale , Player from Underplayer , Storyshift Chara , Poke/Trainertale Frisk , and Reapertale Frisk MUSIC! Undertale has so many good songs it is hard to not say the entire soundtrack. BUT NONETHELESS! I have chosen a certain amount of the soundtrack that I think we can all agree with....along with maybe a few fan-made songs because they are pretty great. Now then, TO THE MUSIC!\n\nHopes and Dreams\n\nMegalovania\n\nBonetrousle\n\nBattle Against a True Hero\n\nBergentruckung + Asgore\n\nUndertale Medley\n\nHis Theme\n\nSpider Dance\n\nGhost Fight\n\nDeath By Glamour\n\nMegalo Strike Back Triple the Threat The Trio's Squabble Tokyovania\n\nStages! I think a very fitting stage would be an Undertale stage that is different in every match depending on its FUN value. It could be in the Ruins, Waterfall, Snowdin, Hotland, CORE, Judgement Hall, or the barrier. Who knows, maybe you will encounter a certain ⬧︎□︎❍︎ ︎□︎■︎ ︎.\n\nWhy they COULD be in Smash\n\nUndertale is coming to Switch and had a very unique trailer in the Nintendo Direct.\n\nUndertale is based heavily on Earthbound and the Mother series creator, Shigesato Itoi, recognized Toby Fox as an awesome game designer.\n\nAnd Toby Fox has been suspiciously excited for Smash Bros Ultimate.\n\nyea.....not that much, but I still have hopes!\n\nWelp! That's all I got! Thanks for reading my supporter thread!\n\nSupporters!\n\nSkeleton-ton-o puns with a moveset fresh off the presses! I’ve created a sans moveset, so I thought it would be only fair that we bring the genocidal human in to the ring. (Before we begin a disclaimer for how I will be using SHE and HER as pronouns for the fallen child Chara.) I know people might lose their s*** over it, but it’s just my opinion and yadda yadda yadda.... etc..\n\nWith that can of worms out of the way, let us commence.\n\nWho is Chara?\n\nChara is the first fallen child of the story Undertale. When the protagonist kills all of the monsters in Undertale and kills Asgore and Flowey, Chara appears and explains that the EXP the protagonist gained strengthened her enough to awaken. You never really meet her in the pacifist route, but if you decide not to ERASE the world in the genocide route, then you give your soul to Chara and she takes control of your body. Pacifist routes will still be available, but it will be implied that Chara is still possessing you and can kill everyone and RESET the world. A lot of people think it’s Chara or Frisk who cause the genocide. It’s not. Chara helps the protagonist in pacifist routes and even says that “Another route would be preferable.” in genocide before gaining control. I believe Chara is only neutral, not evil. She might even be good, as she is the one who stops Asriel in the final pacifist “fight”. When you’re using good memories of all your friends to free them, you can’t with Asriel. You don’t have any good memories. But then a clip plays of Chara being rescued by Asriel. You or Frisk didn’t have this memory; it was Chara’s. However, to make things simpler, Chara will represent genocide and Frisk will represent pacifist. The weapons for Chara’s moveset can be her knife, the fallen children’s weapons, and of course, a save point.\n\nNow that we’ve eaten our vegetables so to speak, let’s get to the meat and potatoes: the moveset.\n\nNeutral- Knife cutter\n\nChara slashes her knife causing a small single red shockwave to come out. It flies in straight direction and can break shields easily.\n\nSide special- Chara pulls out one of three things. A gun, a pan, or a note book. (Weapons of the fallen children) Originally I intended for the tough glove, toy knife, and ballerina shoes to be used as well, but they were to melee-ish. The gun can be fired, the pan can be swung, and notebook can be thrown. It balances out Chara’s melee-related knife attacks. Kicking, punching, and (Let’s be honest, who brings a toy knife to a fight?)\n\nUp special- Determined dash\n\nChara can blitz Sans. SANS. THE SKELETON. Ahem. She dashes in any direction you imput. Plain and simple. However if you run into an opponent, you can launch them instantly.\n\nDown special- SAVE\n\nChara whips out a save point and heals up to 50% health. A neat gimmick is that while doing so you can warp back to where you stood before, making this a potential get-away move. However, you could accidentally warp yourself off the stage if your not careful.\n\nFinal smash-\n\nChara freezes time with the save point, and goes nuts with her knife, slashing everything. When she unfreezes it, the opposing fighters will either be K.Oed, or launched far.\n\nNow comes the fun part-\n\nPalette swaps.\n\n1st- Storyshift Chara\n\n2nd- Underswap Chara (Chara but with a different facial expression and holding a stick)\n\n3rd- ???\n\n4th- ???\n\n5th- ???\n\n6th- ???\n\n7th- ???\n\n8th- ???\n\nWhere there’s Chara, there’s a short pissed skeleton waiting to fight her. I thought if I made a sans moveset, then I had to make one for Chara. Also p.s., Frisk is Chara’s echo fighter. Byyyeeeee!!!!\n\nI’m not opposed to frisk, but I dont like all of the ideas here.\n\nThe moveset is alright, but you didnt include anything like throws/tilts/aerials, so i can’t give too many thoughts on it.\n\nA lot of the alts are fanmade stuff, which... doesnt have much of a reason to be there? No alts for any of the characters currently repped are based off of fanmade material, they all for the most part references. It would probably be more logical to base it off of in-game content.\n\nMy biggest problem however, is the music. Most are fine, but then we get to those last 4. Megalo Strike Back is not an undertale song and was only used in a fanmade animation, but it was made by toby, so maybe they could get away with it. Those last three though? They arent even made by toby, they’re just all remixes? What do you wnat them to do, remix a remix?\n\ntl;dr: Frisk has a lot of potential for a fighter, but the ideas you’ve presented I do not personally think are very well thought out.\n\nI’m not opposed to frisk, but I dont like all of the ideas here.\n\nThe moveset is alright, but you didnt include anything like throws/tilts/aerials, so i can’t give too many thoughts on it.\n\nA lot of the alts are fanmade stuff, which... doesnt have much of a reason to be there?
