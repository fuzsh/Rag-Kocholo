FRisk takes information from the user and immediately generates a personalised interactive report telling them what would have happened had they died or lost capacity yesterday.\n\nFRisk covers everything from your estate distribution, inheritance tax liability, predicted funeral costs, guardianship & more – it even flags parental responsibility issues in the case of unmarried fathers. FRisk Reports effectively create ‘mortality momentum’; having identified the specific risks, FRisk then recommends and connects users to our panel of vetted service providers."
