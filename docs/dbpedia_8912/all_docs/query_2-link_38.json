        "text": "Frisk\n\n' '\n\nFrisk's in game sprite from Undertale Gender Unspecified Appears in Undertale\n\nEarthBound: Down Under Residence Surface Relatives Ninten (biological father)\n\nAna (biological mother)\n\nToriel (adoptive mother) Traveling partners None (Undertale)\n\nNess (EarthBound: Down Under) Non-PSI ability Mercy\n\nFrisk is the main protagonist of Undertale, and one of the two main protagonists of EarthBound: Down Under the other being Ness. Frisk is a child who fell into the Underground, being the last of the eight humans to do so, after traveling to Mt. Ebott in Onett.\n\nFrisk is not the \"fallen human\" whom the player names at the beginning of Undertale, but Frisk's name is only revealed in the True Pacifist Route.\n\nBiography\n\nFrisk has long brown straight hair, a blue sweater with purple stripes, blue pants, and brown shoes. Frisk is designed to be a \"gender neutral\" character, meaning Frisk has no specific gender assigned to them and design wise can be interpreted as either male or female.\n\nFrisk's eyes appear to be closed into a straight horizontal line, and their mouth is closed in a similar manner.Though Frisk does not show much expression in the overworld, NPCs often describe Frisk's expressions.\n\nPersonality and other characteristics\n\nFrisk's personality is left ambiguous, allowing the player to decide what pesonality Frisk has. Depending on their actions, players can interpret Frisk as merciful and kind or merciless and violent. Some NPCs emphasize Frisk's kindness, understanding, and grace in the epilogue.\n\nFrisk also has the silent protagonist trait, as Frisk never speaks any dialog. NPCs display ellipses (\"...\") above their heads when speaking to Frisk to show that they are listening to Frisk, and some NPCs respond to questions that Frisk asks.\n\nIn Undetale\n\nSpoiler warning: this article or section may contain major plot or ending details! Proceed with caution.\n\nNeutral Route\n\nFlowey attempts to kill Frisk after he pretends to offer honest advice. Toriel intervenes, hits Flowey with fire magic, and serves as a guide to the Ruins. At the end of a long room, Toriel asks Frisk to wait for her to return and states that she has errands to do. To be safe, Toriel gives Frisk a cell phone to call her with.\n\nFrisk travels through the remaining puzzles in the Ruins and eventually arrives at Toriel's home. They ask Toriel \"how to exit the RUINS,\" which prompts Toriel to destroy the Ruins's exit. Toriel then battles Frisk because she wants them to prove that they can survive outside of the Ruins.\n\nThen, Frisk meets Sans and Papyrus in Snowdin Forest. The brothers set up traps and puzzles in an attempt to capture Frisk. After passing through Snowdin, Papyrus battles Frisk.\n\nUndyne, the head of the Royal Guard, pursues Frisk throughout Waterfall. Monster Kid often saves Frisk from Undyne by accident because they are so excited to see Undyne in action. After a chase scene, Undyne destroys a bridge that Frisk is standing on, and Frisk falls into the garbage dump. Before they get up, they recall a memory from the first human. In the garbage dump, Mad Dummy battles Frisk because Frisk mistreated their cousin, Dummy, in the Ruins. At the end of Waterfall, Undyne battles Frisk after she gives an abridged monologue atop a crag.\n\nAfter entering Hotland, Frisk enters a lab and meets Alphys and Mettaton. Alphys tells Frisk that she is not a bad guy, and Mettaton interrupts them with a quiz show. Alphys gives Frisk an upgraded cell phone after the quiz show concludes, and she says that she will guide Frisk through Hotland and the CORE. Before his battle at the end of the CORE, Mettaton reveals that Alphys had created all of the traps in Hotland in an attempt to endear herself to Frisk. He then transforms into Mettaton EX and battles Frisk.\n\nWhile passing through New Home, the capital of the Underground, Frisk learns the story of Asgore and Toriel's children from passing monsters. Then, Sans judges Frisk in the final corridor and explains the meaning of LOVE and EXP. He also emphasizes Frisk's importance in the fate of the world.\n\nEscape\n\nFrisk enters the Throne Room and finds Asgore, who tries to make small talk, only to realize their fated confrontation. The two walk to the Barrier and Asgore gives Frisk one last opportunity to leave before fighting.\n\nJust before the fight, Asgore shows the six collected human SOULs, preparing the containment process after the battle. Right before the fight starts, Asgore destroys the MERCY button with his trident, making it impossible to spare or flee. However, at the fight's conclusion, Frisk can explicitly choose whether to spare or kill Asgore. Regardless of the choice made, Flowey appears, destroys Asgore's SOUL and takes the human SOULs. The game then abruptly closes.\n\nAfter reopening the game, Frisk finds that Flowey has saved his own game over the SAVE file, having gained the power to do so with the stolen human SOULs. Loading Flowey's game, Frisk confronts a powered up Flowey and defiantly steps forward, entering an initially hopeless battle with him.\n\nAfter Frisk calls for help several times, the stolen SOULs begin to revolt: first, they heal Frisk, and then they weaken Flowey, leaving him vulnerable to destruction. After reducing his HP to 0 and listening to his monologue, the SOULs remove Flowey's ability to SAVE or LOAD. After this, the SOULs leave Frisk and Flowey alone. At this point, there is an option to kill or spare a weakened Flowey before leaving the Underground, return to the surface, and end their journey.\n\nAfter leaving the Underground, Frisk receives a call from Sans, who leaves a message about what happened to the Underground after Asgore died. This varies based on what monsters were killed and what friendships were completed.\n\nGenocide Route\n\nKilling all enemies will result in the Genocide Route. While traversing the Genocide Route, many characters comment on the protagonist's creepy smile. Sanscomments that it would be great if the protagonist continued pretending to be a human, and Asgore inquires what kind of monster the protagonist is.\n\nAt the end of the Ruins and when going through New Home, Flowey determines that the protagonist is empty inside, just like himself. He concludes that the protagonist is Chara, and informs them of a plan he has to become omnipotent.\n\nChara seems to be in control of the protagonist's scripted sequences, as the sequences in the Genocide Route differ from the Neutral and True Pacifist Routes. Instead of following commands of other NPCs, the protagonist defies them as Chara seems to become corrupt while the route progresses. The first example of defiance occurs when the protagonist ignores Sans's request to hide behind the conveniently shaped lamp; the last is when the protagonist kills Flowey after the player presses Z or Enter on their keyboard before Chara makes their appearance.\n\nThe only instance in the game where Chara makes an in-person physical appearance is at the end of the Genocide Route. They appear as an overworld sprite and speak into the fourth wall. Chara could be speaking directly to the player in this sequence.\n\nAfter this appearance, Chara reveals that the protagonist's \"human soul\" and \"determination\" were the cause of their reincarnation and that the merciless events that occurred during the route lead Chara to realize that the \"purpose\" of their awakening was power. Chara states they are the embodiment of the feeling received whenever STATSincrease and proposes erasing the world and moving on to the next.\n\nThe protagonist is given the choices to \"ERASE\" the world, or \"DO NOT.\" Both choices lead to the same result.\n\nIf the protagonist chooses to \"ERASE,\" Chara calls the protagonist \"a great partner.\" Additionally, their eyes widen, and Chara says to the protagonist that they will be \"together forever.\"If the protagonist chooses \"DO NOT,\" Chara seems confused, they then seem to shake it off and Chara's eyes widen, saying the protagonist was never in control. Afterward, a jump scare occurs, in which Chara approaches the screen with twisted laughter. The screen (or game window) shakes while a loud droning sound loops in the background.\n\nAfter the protagonist makes their choice, an attack animation occurs, followed by red \"9\"s covering the screen. The game is forced into windowed mode and shakes similarly to a monster's death animation as the game closes. The player cannot exit the game before the crash unless they use their OS's Task Manager or Force Quit (on Mac.)\n\nUpon reopening the game, the screen is black and accompanied by a sound similar to howling wind. After 10 minutes, Chara speaks to the protagonist and is doubtful yet intrigued at the fact that the player wants to go back to the game's world. They remind the player that their actions caused the world's destruction, and after they ask the protagonist if they think they are above consequences, Chara offers to restore the world in exchange for something, later revealed to be the protagonist's SOUL.\n\nIf the protagonist agrees to this trade, the world is restored, but the True Pacifist ending is permanently altered. Refusing this offer causes Chara to abandon the protagonist, only to offer the same choice again after the game is restarted and another 10 minutes elapse.\n\nTrue Pacifist Route\n\nTo complete the True Pacifist Route, Frisk must have first completed the Neutral Route.\n\nIf Frisk has completed the Neutral Route without gaining any EXP or LV (i.e. without killing anyone), it is possible to backtrack in the existing SAVE file to complete any missing friendships, then achieve the True Pacifist ending.\n\nIf Frisk acquires any EXP or LV, they have to reset the game to reach the True Pacifist Ending.\n\nFriendships\n\nWhile Frisk befriends many of the monsters in the Underground, only the Undyne, Papyrus, and Alphys friendships are necessary to achieve the True Pacifist Ending.\n\nFrisk gains Toriel's friendship by sparing her, but she does not make another appearance until the end of the route.\n\nFrisk wins Sans's friendship by sparing Papyrus, and can optionally hang out with him twice (first at Grillby's and then at the MTT Resort.)\n\nFrisk gains Papyrus's friendship by visiting him at his home and hanging out or dating him.\n\nNapstablook can be befriended by smiling at them in the Ruins and hanging out with them at their house.\n\nIf Frisk chooses to give Undyne some water after being pursued, Undyne can be befriended. Otherwise, a reset is needed to achieve Undyne's trust and friendship. Frisk visits Undyne with Papyrus's help, and Undyne gets \"revenge\" by trying to befriend Frisk and become \"besties\", setting her house on fire in the process. She tries to fight Frisk to regain honor but realizes that Frisk is a \"wimpy loser with a big heart\" just like Asgore and decides to be friends.\n\nMettaton can be befriended by sparing him, which can be done by getting his ratings to 12000 (10000 if his arms and legs have fallen off) in his battle at the end of the CORE.\n\nUndyne, having been encouraged to send a love letter to Alphys, gives the letter to Frisk, who delivers it to Alphys. This results in a date sequence with Alphys in which she and Undyne realize their feelings for each other and Alphys begins to come to terms with her past mistakes.\n\nAfter befriending Alphys, Papyrus recommends traveling to Alphys's lab. In the lab, there is a letter on the floor that, when picked up, reads a monologue and the instructions needed to proceed to learn \"the truth.\" Walking through the bathroom door reveals an elevator which goes down to the True Lab after a malfunction.\n\nFrisk proceeds to explore the True Lab and along the way learns of Alphys's failed experiments (amalgamates) with determination and also about the origin of Flowey. After exploring the True Lab and talking to Alphys, she gains the confidence to reveal the truth about her experiments to the rest of the Underground. While attempting to leave, Frisk receives a phone call in the elevator from an unknown voice. The elevator immediately and forcibly brings Frisk to New Home.\n\nBarrier\n\nAfter returning to the throne room and confronting Asgore again, the pre-fight dialogue is interrupted by Toriel, who stops Asgore from fighting Frisk. Toriel is immediately followed by the other main characters who encourage everyone to get along. However, in a surprise twist, Papyrus reveals that it was \"a tiny flower\" who told him to bring everyone there.\n\nImmediately after this reveal, Flowey appears, having stolen the SOULs of the six other humans. He attempts to kill Frisk, but Undyne, Toriel, Alphys, Asgore, Sans, and Papyrus use their power to block Flowey's finishing blows. Directly after this, all of the Underground's monsters arrive to encourage Frisk in the fight against Flowey. However, Flowey reveals that this has what he wanted all along so that he could absorb the souls of all the monsters in the Underground along with the six human SOULs.\n\nDue to the immense power gained from the six human SOULs and all of the monster SOULs, Flowey can transform into his true form, and just before the fight begins it is revealed that he is actually Asriel Dreemurr.\n\nDuring this fight, Frisk is invincible, and any hit that would normally result in death instead causes the heart to split, but reform back together. The first time this happens, it is accompanied by the text \"but it refused.\" After stalling for long enough, Asriel transforms again. At this point, Frisk can feel the souls of Toriel, Asgore, Alphys, Undyne, Papyrus, and Sans within Asriel and the ACT button changes to SAVE to represent the act of freeing everyone's souls. This is accomplished by completing a short sequence of ACT options to restore the memory of each lost soul after selecting the said lost soul of a chosen character.\n\nAfter saving each monster, Frisk realizes that there is still one more person to save. After choosing to save \"someone else,\" Asriel's memories of the first human (who strongly resembled Frisk) begin to play in a slideshow style. It is then revealed this \"someone else\" is Asriel himself. After this, Asriel starts to feel the love the monsters feel for Frisk through the souls he has absorbed, and slowly loses the will to fight as he is overcome with his fear of dying alone.\n\nAfter reverting to his child form, Asriel learns Frisk's name. He apologizes for hurting everybody, and Frisk can choose to forgive or not forgive Asriel. Regardless of the choice made, Asriel destroys the barrier using the power of all of the SOULs before releasing them. Knowing that he will turn back to a flower without the power of the SOULs to sustain him, Asriel says one last goodbye to Frisk before leaving. At this point, there is a choice to hug Asriel or do nothing.\n\nFreedom\n\nAfter the scene with Asriel finishes, Frisk wakes up in front of Toriel, Sans, Papyrus, Undyne, Alphys and Asgore. While the monsters remember little about Flowey and nothing about his incarnation as Asriel, they do know Frisk's name. At this point, Frisk can backtrack through the Underground and talk to the other monsters, before returning to the surface.\n\nBacktracking to the very first room in Undertale reveals that Asriel is tending to the flowers. Asriel asks about Frisk's desire to travel up Mt. Ebott in the first place. Receiving no answer, Asriel lists off foolishness or fate as possible motives, but comes to the conclusion that \"only you (Frisk) know the answer.\"\n\nAfter passing through the final door to the surface, Frisk leaves the Underground with friends. Asgore offers Frisk the chance to be the monsters' ambassador to the humans. Most of the main monster cast then leave, except for Toriel, who asks about Frisk's plans. At this point, Frisk can choose to stay with Toriel or to go elsewhere.\n\nAfter choosing to stay with Toriel, the ending scene shows Toriel bringing a slice of pie to Frisk's bedroom. Otherwise, if Frisk has \"places to go,\" the game ends with a group photo of the main monster cast with Frisk in the middle.\n\nIn EarthBound: Down Under\n\nThis article is about an expected future release.\n\nInformation can rapidly change as time approaches for the release. Please avoid adding rumors and speculation, as this could lead to misinformation and potential false information can be spread. All information added must be verifiable and from official or reliable sources.\n\nWhat has currently been revealed is that the story takes place after the \"True Pacifist Route\". Frisk returns to the surface with everyone who was freed. However, the seven human souls were scattered after Porky Minch stole and used them to revive Giygas. Frisk then teams up with Ness to travel between the surface and Underground, to find the seven souls that were scattered in the form of melodies, along with the hidden eighth soul, to stop Porky and Giygas from banishing everyone into the Underground.\n\nIn Super Smash Bros."
