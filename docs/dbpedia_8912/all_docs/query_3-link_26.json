Frisk can murder almost everyone in the Underground, even though the game doesn't count it as a properly made Genocide Route. Even Chara doesn't say \"It's me\" in those cruel Neutral Routes. After Chara destroyed the world, Frisk can sell them their own soul. Just think of it. Frisk sells their soul to some demonlike creature who has just destroyed the world. Frisk can make another Genocide.",
