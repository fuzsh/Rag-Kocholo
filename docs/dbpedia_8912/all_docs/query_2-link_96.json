        "text": "Move Name Damage Description Neutral attack Tough Glove 2% per hit Frisk punches the opponent up to four times depending on how rapidly the attack button is tapped. Dash attack Stick 6% Frisk thrusts a stick ahead. Up tilt Worn Dagger 9% Frisk swings the Worn Dagger above themselves. Forward tilt Torn Notebook 5% Frisk swings the Torn Notebook in front of themselves. Weak and lacks range, but a solid combo starter. Down tilt — 3% Frisk crouches and pokes in front of themselves with a stick. Up smash Real Knife 20% Frisk swings the Real Knife above themselves. Forward smash Burnt Pan 12% Frisk whacks the opponent with a pan. Virtually identical to Peach's forward smash in animation. Down smash Old Tutu 1% (hits 1-4), 10% (hit 5) Frisk twirls around in the Old Tutu. Neutral aerial Yellow 3% A small yellow projectile launches in front of Frisk. Forward aerial Toy Knife 10% Frisk slices with the Toy Knife. Back aerial — 6% Frisk whacks behind themselves with an umbrella. Up aerial — 3% Frisk strikes a pose. Can combo into itself. Down aerial Ballet Shoes 2% per hit Frisk stomps with the Ballet Shoes. Grab — — Frisk reaches out in front of themselves. Pummel — 1% Frisk \"shakes their hand.\" Unarguably the worst pummel in the game, as it deals little damage and is slow. Forward throw — 10% Frisk lets go of the opponent and kicks a snowball at them. Back throw — 12% Frisk lets go of the opponent and kicks a snowball at them. Despite having a similar animation to forward throw, this attack is a far better KO move but makes it more difficult to rack up damage. Up throw — 8% Frisk flips a switch up where the opponent is, sending the opponent upwards. Down throw Ballet Shoes 3% (hits 1-2), 4%, (hit 3) Frisk tosses the opponent downwards and stomps on them three times. Neutral special Act — If an opponent comes within very close range, Frisk will talk to them, producing a text box with unique dialogue for each opponent and lowering their offense and defense. If used enough times on the same opponent, they can automatically lose a stock once Spare is used, but it leaves Frisk vulnerable from behind. Side special Empty Gun 1% (bad timing), 3.5% (perfect timing) Frisk fires up to four bullets from a pistol, depending on how many times the special button is pressed. Deals far more damage if the button is pressed with perfect rhythm. Up special Vent — Frisk disappears and reappears just below a vent far above the initial point. Effectively a simple third jump."
