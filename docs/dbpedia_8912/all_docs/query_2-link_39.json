        "text": "I made this as part of my Patreon.\n\nThe vote for next monthly blogs will be Cassandra Cain, Monkuma, Captain Olimar and Superboy Prime. Sign up and vote if you’d like.\n\nNote: You can technically play through all routes of Undertale in a single game copy, hence all routes will be taken into account.\n\nBackground\n\nThe 8th human to fall into the underground of mount Ebott. In the underground, monsters from a previous age of Earth have been imprisoned behind a magic seal, and require the power of 7 human souls to break said seal. They’re led by Asgore, a monster king who’s murdered multiple humans for the sake of breaking this seal. In order to escape back to the surface Frisk must make their way through hordes of monsters to reach Asgore and hopefully pass through the barrier blocking off the surface.\n\nThe wrinkle in this plot is that Frisk has the ability to manipulate time, allowing them to save and reload previous locations in time. Using this power Frisk can either complete their journey by pacifistically befriending all monsters, or mercilessly killing everyone.\n\nAt the end of the “pacifist” route Frisk battles Asriel, who was Asgor’s former son Asriel and had been revived in a botched nihilistic form known as Flowey. After reminding Aseriel of their humanity, they break the barrier in Mount Ebbot using the power of the human souls Asgore had previously acquired.\n\nIn the “genocide” ending Frisk kills every monster in the underground and becomes possessed by Chara, the spirit of the first human that fell in the underground. This storyline ends with Chara destroying the universe. Should the player try to reset the game and do a new pacifist playthrough after completing the genocide ending, Chara will hijack the story and give them a bad ending regardless.\n\nArsenal\n\nStick\n\nA wooden stick. It can be used as a melee weapon and can distract dogs if thrown.\n\nFrisk using the stick https://youtu.be/bJHS3pRPFhc?t=67\n\nToy knife/Worn dagger\n\nA plastic toy knife and a worn dagger. They can both be used for slashing attacks.\n\nThe toy knife weapon https://youtu.be/zp3V0EHxCuw?t=5\n\nTough glove\n\nA pair of gloves used for rapid punching attacks.\n\nFrisk using the tough gloves on Undyne https://youtu.be/2sqb-KuFeeQ?t=48\n\nBurnt pan\n\nA frying pan used for multi hit attacks. When it’s equipped, consumable items heal additional damage.\n\nFrisk using the burnt pan against Sans https://youtu.be/HVFPZAF1xpk?t=84\n\nEmpty gun\n\nA revolver gun. It lacks bullets but is still somehow able to shoot out projectiles. Given the projectiles are shaped as the stars used for saving, some speculate its projectiles may be some form of determination.\n\nFrisk using the empty gun on Sans https://youtu.be/BgSUUbBqI7Q?t=51\n\nBallet shoes\n\nBallet shoes used for rapid kicking attacks.\n\nFrisk using the ballet shows against Undyne https://youtu.be/wV6yew3pquY?t=15\n\nTorn notebook\n\nA large notebook. It increases invincibility frames after being hit by an attack in game. It’s implied to be used to both hit opponents and block attacks.\n\nFrisk using the torn notebook against Undyne https://youtu.be/qXvF2bSP9ms?t=26\n\nReal knife\n\nA “real” sharpened knife. It has the highest attack stats in the game. It’s only obtainable in the genocide ending.\n\nFrisk using the real knife https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUA_U_GD_7U\n\nArmor\n\nList of all armors in game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKFcWpK2_IU\n\nBandage: A bandage the Frisk was wearing when they first fell into the underground. It allows them to escape from fights more easily and can be used as a healing item when taken off.\n\nFaded ribbon: A faded ribbon that increases defense by a small amount.\n\nManly bandana: A bandana that moderately increases defense.\n\nOld tutu: A tutu that moderately increases defense.\n\nCloudy glasses: A pair of glasses that moderately raises endurance, and increases invulnerability frames.\n\nStained apron: An apron that Increases defense and also passively heals HP.\n\nCowboy hat: A hat that increases defense and attack power.\n\nHeart locket: A locket worn by the first human Chara. Increases defensive power.\n\nTemmie armor: The most powerful armor in the game. It increases defense,attack power and lengthens invulnerability frames. It also passively recovers Frisk’s HP.\n\nEquipment\n\nMisc healing items\n\nFrisk can carry around various healing items, including pies, donuts, teas, or other foodstuffs. The most powerful is Butterscotch pie, which recovers full HP.\n\nList of consumables here\n\nPhone\n\nA cell phone initially given to Frisk by Toriel. It’s later upgraded by Alphys. It can connect to the underground social network, summon a jetpack(with a limited fuel supply), defuse bombs and access dimensional boxes to store items remotely. It can also activate “yellow soul mode”, which gives Frisk the ability to shoot energy projectiles from their body.\n\nFrisk using the phone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqcl_cOZ-W8\n\nThe phone Jetpack mode https://youtu.be/Y-sEcbtRhzg?t=1586\n\nYellow soul mode https://youtu.be/ogNHObCZjwU?t=92\n\nThe bomb diffusion mode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7JFJUCfW0\n\nAbilities\n\nActions\n\nActions are situational physical skills that can be used against monsters in the underground. The vast majority of them don’t have any notable effects to combat, but a few can alter stats or status effects.\n\nFlex\n\nA flexing motion used against the monster Aaron. Temporarily increases attack power.\n\nFrisk using the flex action https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKL74AzHjuQ&feature=youtu.be&list=PLxyG63y66psw2S_Evd2zr8XDffkLXv_5d&t=522\n\nClear mind\n\nThe ability to clear one's mind. Prevents Frisk from becoming confused or having controls inverted by the Magjik enemy.\n\nFrisk using clear mind https://youtu.be/bEP6VxzfnLo?t=9\n\nDraw\n\nAllows Frisk to draw an object into reality. Used during the fight against So Sorry.\n\nFrisk Draws a boat https://youtu.be/6qjtArxeO2w?t=146\n\nHeat up/Cool down\n\nAllows Frisk to “crank up or down a thermostat” increasing the heat or coolness of the surrounding area. Used against Pyrope.\n\nFrisk uses Heat up https://youtu.be/xYBehCeztrw?t=101\n\nSing\n\nAllows Frisk to sing an opponent into a deep sleep. Used against Knight Knight.\n\nFrisk uses the Sing action https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JOcC1uz1oM&feature=youtu.be&t=1\n\nStare\n\nAllows Frisk to weaken magical items by staring at them. Used against Magjik enemies.\n\nFrisk uses the state action https://youtu.be/2FskA9P1aMo?t=38\n\nFlirt\n\nThe ability to flirt with characters. You have the option to do this alot for some reason.\n\nAll flirt actions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQ4xHa_Reg\n\nSteal\n\nFrisk can steal objects, such as Ice cap’s cap.\n\nFrisk uses the steal option https://youtu.be/euyUdtam_lU?t=73\n\nDetermination\n\nDetermination is a major concept in the Unertale series. Determination is essentially the “will to live” or to push on through difficult situations. It’s a substance found within most human souls, and the person who has the highest determination in the underground can cheat death via access to the save/load/reset system. High enough determination can also grant regenerative powers or minor reality warping.\n\nSaving/load\n\nThe ability to save your placement in a timeline, and then later reload yourself to that exact location in time/space. Conventionally it works like the save system in a traditional RPG. If Frisk fights a person with greater determination than their own, that person can hijack control over this system.\n\nFrisk saving https://youtu.be/EJrs_2vjF98?t=1812\n\nFlowey overwrites Frisk’s save https://youtu.be/0WqgW8swea0?t=674\n\nReset\n\nThe ability to reset Frisk’s progress back to when they originally fell into the underground. It resets all items, story actions and leveling back to 0.\n\nFrisk using the reset power https://youtu.be/p4jNN6496qQ?t=18\n\nTrue reset\n\nA more powerful variation of the reset power. It resets even those with ripple proof memories.\n\nFrisk does a true reset https://youtu.be/8t48LHe4WyE?t=101\n\nRipple proof memory\n\nThose with high determination or access to the save/load system retain their memories across multiple timelines or timeline resets.\n\nFlowey remembers if you kill Toriel and reset https://youtu.be/9Kt2f5Lw21I?t=15\n\nVarious examples of reset conversations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7FEyO9kphA\n\nImmortality\n\nWith high enough determination Frisk can instantly revive from death mid combat. They can even outright refuse to die regardless of the power of the attack used against them.\n\nFrisk reviving mid death https://youtu.be/EcctG__QTco?t=769\n\nFrisk refuses to die https://youtu.be/EcctG__QTco?t=1418\n\nHope\n\nAn ability Frisk can use at max determination. Frick’s “hopes” can reduce damage received from opponents.\n\nFrisk uses the hope ability ://youtu.be/EcctG__QTco?t=551\n\nDream\n\nAn ability that Frisk can use at max determination. It allows them to create infinite “dream” items that can be consumed to recover HP.\n\nFrisk creates a dream consumable https://youtu.be/EcctG__QTco?t=562\n\nChara\n\nThe first human to fall into the underground. It is HEAVILY implied that Chara’s spirit somehow attaches itself to Frisk’s soul and that they become the narrator in all routes of Undertale. In the genocide route their presence becomes much notable, as they possess Frisk towards the end of the route and destroy the game of Undertale after all other characters in the game have been killed.\n\nCheck\n\nThe ability to relay information on enemies and allies to Frisk during fights. It’s heavily implied Chara is the one to do this.\n\nAll checks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UUMbSV4a_I\n\nExp and LV\n\nExp and Lv stand for “execution points and Level of Violence” respectively. They go up in number as Frisk kills monsters in the underground. Chara’s power is at least partially corresponding to the amount of Lv they gain, with level 20 being the max Lv they can obtain.\n\nSans explains the concept of Exp and Lv https://youtu.be/oKcEgBrIvBA?t=1765\n\nFull manifestation/possession\n\nAt max Lv Chara can manifest as a separate entity. They can also possess Frisk at high Lv, and retain the ability to posses Frisk even in endings where the genocide ending was reset.\n\nChara fully manifests as a separate entity https://youtu.be/sC4Q5AvIX3s?t=93\n\nChara in the void after the genocide ending https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUSR4PlN6ns\n\nChara possessing Frisk in the soulless endings https://youtu.be/BsNec0oSZvM?t=621\n\nAcausality\n\nUnlike Frisk and Flowey, Chara's memories are not reset with true reset.\n\nGenocide and Pacifist ending changes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXiboQFrvg and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi-iQ5o1Nwc\n\nNote: Chara should technically be able to manifest or posses Frisk at any time after the genocide ending has been completed once. As they retain their memories of said route and are the ones that restore reality back to normal if the player wants to perform another normal playthrough.\n\nFeats\n\nIn the majority of undertale you control Frisk in battle by maneuvering their soul to dodge attacks. Technically monsters in undertale use magic that’s much more spiritually based, rather than physical.\n\nFlowey explains the soul https://youtu.be/HQY0V2G9gc8?t=130\n\nStrength\n\nFrisk can push large stones https://youtu.be/HQY0V2G9gc8?t=559\n\nFrisk can deal damage to the giant omega Flowey https://youtu.be/0WqgW8swea0?t=1184\n\nChara can physical destroy the universe with an attack in the genocide ending https://youtu.be/sC4Q5AvIX3s?t=93 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUSR4PlN6ns\n\nSans heavily implies that Chara ends all timelines “possible” in undertale after the genocide ending https://youtu.be/Vr4IYjeplJA?t=40\n\nEndurance\n\nFrisk survives a dozen foot fall https://youtu.be/HQY0V2G9gc8?t=835 and https://youtu.be/vKL74AzHjuQ?t=1685\n\nFrisk survives a stove explosion ://youtu.be/KSVeFzxHWj0?t=448\n\nFrisk can survive hits from Undyne, who can suplex boulders https://youtu.be/Y-sEcbtRhzg?t=40\n\nFrisk survives Asriel’s most powerful attack. Asriel is implied to be able to purge entire timelines https://youtu.be/EcctG__QTco?t=1418\n\nSpeed\n\nFrisk can dodge sound waves https://youtu.be/vKL74AzHjuQ?t=1198\n\nFrisk dodges spears from Undyne https://youtu.be/Y-sEcbtRhzg?t=368\n\nFrisk can dodge plane-like projectiles https://youtu.be/Y-sEcbtRhzg?t=1155\n\nFrisk maneuvers a jetpack https://youtu.be/Y-sEcbtRhzg?t=1614\n\nFrisk dodges eclectic waves https://youtu.be/oKcEgBrIvBA?t=862\n\nFrisk can dodge Omega Flowey’s missiles https://youtu.be/0WqgW8swea0?t=1078\n\nFrisk can dodge bullets https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WqgW8swea0&t=1092s\n\nFrisk can dodge meteors https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JOcC1uz1oM&t=10s\n\nDodged Asriel’s hyper goner attack https://youtu.be/brCyS97XQns?t=235\n\nExperience"
