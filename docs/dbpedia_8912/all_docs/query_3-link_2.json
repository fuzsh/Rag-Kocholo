        "text": "PC users page link HERE\n\n# MAIN TAG # COMICS ONLY # ALL POSTS\n\nAU/ASK BLOG!\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nWhat is CORE!Frisk AU about?\n\nThe AU, or rather the character, is based on the popular fan theory of W. D. Gaster falling into the CORE and becoming scattered across time and space. The whole concept is built upon the idea that because of Frisk’s strong human Soul and ability to RESET, falling into the CORE would result in a different outcome than the one associated with Gaster.\n\nUpon falling into the CORE Frisk attempted to RESET to save themselves, however it was too late and the RESET has interacted with the CORE in an unprecendent way - it caused their Soul to expand uncontrollably not just across their own universe, but across the entirety of Undertale Multiverse, transforming Frisk into an omnipresent entity.\n\nIf you like what you hear, I recommend you to read this AU Wiki page for this AU! It was written by yours truly!\n\nCan I draw fanart for your AU, dub your comics, or I write a fanfic featuring Core?\n\nYes, very much yes!\n\nCan I feature CORE!Frisk in my own fanwork?\n\nYeah, of course!\n\nWhere can I read CORE!Frisk story/comic from the beginning?\n\nCurrently there is no chronological plot comic about CORE!Frisk. All the comics in #cf-comic tag are snippets from their life in no particular order. If you’re interested in Core’s backstory keep reading this FAQ.\n\nWhat is CORE!Frisk’s story?\n\nFrisk was born in 20XX in a small European country tormented by a civil war. Their father died on the battlefield when they were very small which forced their mother to raise the child alone. When Frisk was eight years old their mother died of infection and the orphan found itself with no family left and nowhere to go; and so they decided leave the country and go to a place that their mum promised they’ll visit together once the war is over. After long weeks of constant travel, the child arrived to Mount Ebott, and when they entered a cave to hive from the rain they slipped and fell into the Underground.\n\nFrisk met many monsters and made many friends, falling in love with the underground adventure - enough so that they would RESET once the monsters exit the Underground all over again just to explore new friendships and new corners of the caverns. No one remembers the time loop, but the previous memories dormantly linger in every monster.\n\nOne day, when the barrier was broken once again, Sans happened to witness Frisk about to RESET and was flooded with peaceful memories of pacifist timelines that weren’t allowed to move on. The sight fills him with an unprecedented rage. He grabs the startled child and shortcuts to the CORE, the only thing in his mind being to permanently stop the time loop. And what better way than to erase the perperator from the time and space itself?\n\nOnly at this moment Frisk realizes that they have hurt one of their best friends beyond redemption. They are heartbroken and promise they will never RESET again… but Sans doesn’t believe them. And drops them in.\n\nBurning alive, Frisk attempted to save themself with a RESET just as their Soul scattered, which caused an interesting thing to occur - the scattering didn't just stop inside their own universe's time and space, it didn't stop at all. And thus, Frisk's Soul has turned omnipresent.\n\nMuch like the Royal Scientist, Frisk has also been erased from their timeline and no one remembers they even existed.\n\nCan I have some cool facts about CORE!Frisk?\n\nHere’s the compilation of basically all frequently asked questions I get, just so you don’t have to painfully browse my archive. If your question wasn’t answered feel free to send me an ask either here or on my other blog @corefrisk.\n\nTheir full name is Frisk Marusina.\n\nThey’re 9 years old.\n\nTheir height is 4 feet and their weight is 0.77 pounds.\n\nTheir birthday is February 29th, unspecified future year.\n\nFrisk identifies as AMAB non-binary.\n\nTheir HP is 0/0.\n\nThey come from Slovakia. Their father Vojtech was a native Slovak and their mother Zoya was an immigrant Ukrainian from Carpathian Ruthenia.\n\nTheir Mt. Ebott is in the UK and they traveled across Europe mostly on foot to get there.\n\nSince their transformation, Frisk can no longer SAVE, LOAD, nor RESET.\n\nFrisk doesn’t have a single “body”. Every time they appear they create a new body, and every time they disappear this body is forever discarded. A single mind, a single omnipresent soul, a single person, but unlimited bodies!\n\nFor every moment Core appears in a timeline, there's an alternative route in which they didn't appear. In fact, the versions in which Core did appear are the alternative ones. If you want your AU to suffer and don't want Core to ever meddle with it, you can do that and nothing will be out of character.\n\nNo, there is no way to prevent them from seeing a timeline or an AU.\n\nNo, they cannot shape-shift their appearance at all.\n\nNo, they can’t open portals between dimensions.\n\nNo, they cannot die. Their bodies can be damaged with Out!Code or Void constructs, but destroying their bodies doesn't kill them.\n\nThey cannot feel pain/pleasure/touch and they cannot smell/taste things.\n\nThose large black circles are not black eyes, but empty sockets! They actually kind of work like two tiny portals, and Frisk can put small objects inside and pull them out in any timeline in any universe. Yes, their sockets can drain water.\n\nYes, their voice sounds normal and has no echo, TV noise, or other such effects.\n\nWhat happened to other characters from their timeline?\n\nSans was greatly stressed and depressed because of the time loop caused by the human’s RESETS, unable to remember them directly but aware that they are happening. He never planned to do anything about it, not even telling the human, but one day he happened to witness Frisk about to RESET less than half a minute after breaking the Barrier. In a sudden massive fit of anger he grabbed the human, teleported to the CORE, and verbally poured out all of his pent up emotions onto the child before dropping them into the energy pool, taking advantage of its ability to erase people from existence. It worked, and now he has no recollection of what happened or who broke the Barrier.\n\nChara’s ghost was bound to Frisk’s SOUL when they fell into the Underground. They were forced to tag along through Frisk’s entire journey. At first this was very frustrating, as Frisk was unable to hear or see them; despite this, Chara ended up growing fond of the child and formed a one-sided friendship with them. This came to an abrupt end when Sans finally snapped and killed Frisk by throwing them into the CORE. Chara’s already fragile essence was unable to stay connected to the expanding Soul and got torn apart, allowing them and Frisk to catch a glimpse of each other for a split second before their consciousness faded forever. And on the top of that, because of the CORE’s effects, Chara - just like Dr. Gaster and Frisk - was also erased completely from their existence, forgotten by everyone. Frisk is now the only person who remembers them.\n\nWhat is the Omega Timeline?\n\nThe Omega Timeline (OT) is a special dimension that connects all Undertale timelines and AUs. It has become a new home for people whose timelines are no longer habitable or have nowhere else to go, as well as a safe place for those who don’t have one in their own world. That doesn’t mean this timeline is only for people experiencing hardships, however - anyone can be invited. One does not need to experience great tragedy for CORE!Frisk to approach them with the offer.\n\nWhile the dimension has always existed, it was CORE!Frisk who has claimed its ownership and with the help of many transformed it into the safe haven it is now. The first people - other than Frisk themselves - have set foot in the OT way back during the Human-Monster War period. The place at the time was completely empty, safe for the doors the monsters and humans just came through. Joining forces, people started to bring resources from their desolate homeworlds, from the wood and stone to build the houses with to the dirt to plant the trees in. With the long, hard work, the OT finally became a place worthy of being called haven. The process is still not complete, and the timeline continues to develop more and more.\n\nIf you're interested, I run a public Discord roleplay server set in the Omega Timeline!\n\nFour years ago you said X fact, but now you say Y fact that directly contradicts it. Which one is correct?\n\nThe latter, of course. Sometimes people change their minds on certain aspects.\n\n* * *"
