        "text": "(undertale spoilers)\n\nthe way humans work in undertale is largely a mystery. there are writings that describe monster biology and facts in detail but fail to provide similar information about humans (including what changes happen in humans who absorb boss monster souls). it’s never explained why human souls have many different colours. the game never mentions what occurs when two human consciousnesses inhabit one body because it has likely never happened before in recorded history.\n\nbut asriel shared his bodysharing experience.\n\nas a part of chara’s plan, asriel absorbed chara’s soul once they died. asriel admits to frisk that chara was able to control their shared body as well, that control over the body was actually split between the two of them. the information provided by the game tells us that, when a human soul and a monster soul inhabits a monster body, both souls can have roughly equal control.\n\nbut what if something loses its soul? what happens to it?\n\nSNOWDIN LIBRARY BOOK: (It's a school report about monster funerals.) Monster funerals, technically speaking, are cool as heck. When monsters get old and kick the bucket, they turn into dust. At funerals, we take that dust and spread it on that person's favorite thing. Then their essence will live on in that thing...\n\nwhen a monster dies, its body turns to dust. as a tradition, a monster’s dust is spread on their favourite thing during their funeral. “their essence will live on in that thing.” but it turns out that this is meant literally and not figuratively.\n\nwhen asriel died, “his dust spread across the garden.” his dust likely stuck onto the “sticky” seeds of the golden flower he managed to bring back with him, after placing chara in the village’s garden. perhaps the highest concentration of asriel’s essence was left in the flower that bloomed before all the rest. when injected with determination, the flower came to life with asriel’s essence but without his soul, and flowey was born. the experiment that brought him to life is documented in the true lab entries.\n\nso essence is something that exists in the world of undertale. using determination, essence in a vessel can bring back a monster to life. but what about humans? do they also leave behind their essence?\n\nwhile essence is never mentioned in regards to humans, a monster’s essence is essentially their remains. thus, a human’s body may be their own essence. now the question is, when does does chara’s body come in contact with frisk?\n\nFLOWEY: I just have one question for you, Chara. How did you get back to the RUINS from here...? ...wait, I know. She must have taken you when she left. And decided to give you a proper burial, rather than... Hanging out in the basement forever. ...but, why then...? What made you wake up? Did you hear me calling you...?\n\nnear the end of the genocide route, flowey states that toriel must have moved chara’s body from the basement in new home to the ruins where they fell for a “proper burial.”\n\nin toriel’s house, the player can find flower seeds inside a drawer. toriel most likely brought them to plant on top of chara’s grave, knowing the golden flowers were chara’s favourite. it’s also possible that the sticky seeds from the golden flowers were still stuck to chara’s body.\n\nwhen frisk falls into the underground almost a hundred years later, they fall on top of chara’s grave. somehow, as a result, chara’s “essence” slips into frisk. when the essence came into contact with frisk’s determination, it was given life, just like with flowey. perhaps it was because frisk’s body had the ability to house a red soul -- the same color of chara’s soul. maybe it was this compatibility that allowed chara to bond with frisk in a way that they couldn’t with the other fallen humans. perhaps it was this combined with flowey “calling” chara. maybe even the act of naming the first fallen human woke them up – a power only the player has.\n\nbut because chara had no soul of their own, they cannot control frisk’s body in the same way that they controlled asriel’s. while their essence is able to influence frisk (such as the “game over” memories and, if you subscribe to the narrachara theory, the flavour text), they need something more to increase their level of control -- LOVE.\n\neach time the player forces frisk to kill, chara’s control increases. it doesn’t take long for chara’s influence to be obvious to those around frisk. frisk’s personality and mannerisms seem to disappear completely quite early in the genocide route.\n\nhowever, LOVE is not enough. chara needs the cooperation of the player. after all, high amounts of LOVE can be achieved in the neutral route, but frisk’s actions remain relatively intact. without the player’s cooperation, chara does not take control over frisk’s body. perhaps chara learned from their experience with asriel the importance of a willing partner.\n\nchara and frisk quite literally have a give-and-take relationship, and it is the player who tips the scale in either direction."
