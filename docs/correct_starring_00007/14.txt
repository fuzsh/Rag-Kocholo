Vivica A. Fox, who starred in the Kill Bill film series in the early 2000s, is now featured in SZA’s “Kill Bill” music video inspired by it.

The “Kill Bill” video, directed by Christian Breslauer, makes several references to the Quentin Tarantino work. Some familiar visuals include Budd’s trailer, samurai swords and motorcycles, Complex reports.

There’s also a reference to the scene at the House of the Blue Leaves involving the Crazy 88.

Variety reports that the “Kill Bill” video was released early Tuesday afternoon before being taken down and reuploaded an hour later.

“Lmao it’s going back up shortly,” SZA tweeted. “Just everyone act surprised when it does please.”

The track from SZA’s long-awaited sophomore album SOS is currently No. 3 on Billboard‘s Hot 100 chart. SOS has topped the Billboard 200 since its release on Dec. 9.
