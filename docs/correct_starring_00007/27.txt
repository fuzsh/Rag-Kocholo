Vivica A. Fox, who starred as Vernita Green in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2, has rallied for a third film after her cameo in SZA’s latest music video.

Fox, who spoke with People while en route to a screening of her new docuseries Skilled, said that she received dozens of texts after reprising her role as Copperhead in SZA’s “Kill Bill” music video.

“Oh my gosh. Did that go viral or what? People were making up their own storylines!” she said. “My phone blew up that day and the internet as well. Yeah, I think people thought it’s gonna be this thing.”

Following a separate appearance at Sundance this weekend, Fox went on to say that the reaction among fans makes her think people are ready for a third Kill Bill.

“People are hungry,” Fox said. “Quentin, let’s go!”

Kill Bill Vol. 2 hit theaters in April 2004, raking in over $150 million at the box office. While Tarantino has never formally announced any plans for a third entry in the series, he previously said he toyed around with the idea of Vernita Green’s daughter hunting down The Bride to avenge her mother's death.

In fact, fans were so ecstatic by SZA’s latest music video that many called for the TDE singer to be cast as Green’s daughter, Fox added.

“They were like, ‘Yes! SZA is playing Vivica Fox’s daughter in Kill Bill! Now we know! She’s gonna come back and go after Uma Thurman,’” Fox told People. “I’m like, ‘Not exactly…’ So that was great. I was very honored to work with SZA. She’s so lovely.”

SZA’s newly released SOS album has remained at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks. The record dropped on Dec. 9 and features appearances from Phoebe Bridgers, Don Toliver, Travis Scott, and the late Ol’ Dirty Bastard—whose fellow Wu-Tang Clan member happened to do the music for both Tarantino’s Kill Bill installments.
