Fox‘s Vernita Green from the first film. Fox has already spoken of the possibility of a third film, but it turns out she even has an idea of who should play her daughter.\n\nREAD MORE: Vivica A. Fox Says She’s Ready For ‘Kill Bill 3’\n\nSpeaking with NME, Fox shared some suggestions for who should seek revenge against Uma Thurman‘s The Bride for killing her mother. “I haven’t got any official word [on ‘Kill Bill Vol. 3],” Fox said. “I had a feeling that hopefully [Tarantino] was waiting on the actress who plays my daughter to grow up a little bit. But then I was doing an interview and they asked, ‘What young actress would you get to play your daughter?’ and I was like, ‘No, [Ambrosia Kelley, who played the daughter in the first film]!,’ but they meant an established actress. So I went, ‘Zendaya!'”\n\n“How hot would that be?” Fox continued. “And that would probably green light this project. Because her and Uma are both very tall, and it would just be kick-butt ,and I love her. Hopefully now we can put that out, like ‘Tarantino, cast Zendaya!’ And spark his interest to put it on the fast track. Wouldn’t it be amazing?”\n\nREAD MORE: Quentin Tarantino Has An Idea For ‘Kill Bill Vol. 3’ & Says Film Is “In The Cards” But Still Years Away"
