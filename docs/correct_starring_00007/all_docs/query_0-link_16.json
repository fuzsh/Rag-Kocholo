        "text": "I saw this article pop up yesterday and was surprised no one else had linked it. So, I've done a thread doing just that. The following is an excerpt from her new book Everyday I'm Hustling, that TIME ran as an article. You should read the whole thing, it isn't too long, but I've pulled some of the interesting bits below.\n\nhttp://time.com/5206267/vivica-a-fox-book/\n\nGetting the Part\n\nTIME said:\n\nQuentin loves telling stories, and if he likes you, oh, he is going to talk. At like Mach 5. We discussed favorite movies, of course. I talked about Pam Grier and how much I loved her, and Richard Roundtree, who'd played my dad on Generations. \"Yeah, I'm Shaft's daughter,\" I joked.\n\nThe 15-minute meeting stretched to an hour and a half, until he said, \"I'm going to send you a scene and I'm going to come to your house and we'll work through it together.\"\n\nScared Quentin might not give her the part because she was actually quite well off due to investments prior to acting.\n\nTIME said:\n\n\"Promise me you won't hold my house against me?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Just promise me, Quentin.\" He did, and I'm sure he suspected I was a hoarder or some crazy person living in a tiny house. The truth was that I was living in a huge 8,000-square-foot mansion in Tarzana. I'd invested in real estate, was doing very well, thank you, and this place frankly looked like a diva lived there. It was straight out of Dynasty, with a double staircase and huge chandelier right when you walked in.\n\nIt could easily be mistaken for the home of a spoiled brat who would never follow direction. This was a time in film when studios were not playing. They were tired of problem actors and had dealt with their spoiled stars shutting down productions because of heroin problems. They wanted workers on the straight and narrow, and any red flags could put me out of the running.\n\nTraining for the part\n\nTIME said:\n\nDrama aside, the training itself was brutal. We'd do fight choreography, knife throwing, samurai lessons and hit the treadmill and weights in between. They liked me because I could do them high kicks from being a cheerleader. And every Friday, at the end of the day, Quentin would gather us around and give us a review. He called it his \"State of the Union.\" We all had to sit and listen.\n\n...\n\nThird Friday, I was so proud of all that our team had accomplished. I was sitting between cute little Lucy and sweet Uma, and I was ready for a high five for all of us.\n\nInstead, Quentin tore into us. Something about us lollygagging in the morning, taking too long to suit up and gabbing over coffee. He said we should get here at 8:30, a half hour early, if we wanted to do all that.\n\nI raised my hand. \"Hold up.\"\n\nAnd I lost it on him. \"Is this a 'beat us up' contest?\" I asked. \"Are we f-cking doing anything right? Goddamn.\" Everyone gasped. I felt Uma draw back. Lucy grabbed my hand and was trying to do a kind of acupressure on me, whispering, \"Calm down. Calm down.\"\n\nUma helping her learn to \"attack intelligently\"\n\nTIME said:\n\n\"What you need to do is learn how to manipulate the situation better. Then you can get what you want.\"\n\nI was all righteous. \"I don't have to manipulate nobody,\" I said. \"That's not me. I don't have to kiss his ass.\"\n\nShe cocked her head. \"No, I don't mean like that,\" she said, still speaking in that calm, soothing voice. \"You have to learn to be quiet, speak less. He's tough, but he's not stupid. He'll concede you something if it's to make the film better. Learn to attack intelligently, Vivica. Because he's got the power to fire you.\"\n\nAnd she told me she didn't want that to happen. \"But thank you for speaking up,\" she said.\n\nThat moment was pure sisterhood. She was honestly looking out for me. She wanted me to advocate for myself, but to do it in a way that was more constructive. I'll admit, it still took me a minute to figure out what she was talking about.\n\n...\n\nI watched her argue with Quentin, intelligently and successfully, for wardrobe changes and even dialogue rewrites. She made it a true collaboration, pushing him away from simply making an ode to the samurai films he made us all watch with him, toward something new. Kill Bill is an astonishing work because of their shared efforts, and it's because they each approached it not as a job, but as a cornerstone of their careers.\n\nHer feelings on the movie and the recently revealed car crash\n\nTIME said:\n\nI know it's the work that I am most proud of in my career. It took four days to film our fight scene, and on the last day I took a long bath when it was over. I sat in the tub and counted all the bruises on my arms and legs. I got up to 30. And I did so with gratitude. I was proud of my battle scars. I had done a Tarantino film, and nobody could take that accomplishment from me. Quentin is a fabulous director and I'd love to work with him again. I appreciate those endless hours in the Culver City torture chamber. It was his way of breaking us down to build us back up.\n\nI had no idea about the car crash Uma recently made public, as that scene was shot after I completed my filming. But when I saw it I was shocked. Even at the premiere and on press tours in Los Angeles and New York, it wasn't even mentioned. I commend Uma for her courage and grace, and hopefully Quentin learned that no shot is worth risking an actor's safety.\n\nFrom Uma, I learned so much about sharing power. She wanted me to do my best. That hasn't always been the case for black women actors in film..."
