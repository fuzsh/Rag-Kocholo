        "text": "The first time I saw 'Kill Bill', I thought I was having a heart attack.\n\nWiggle your big toe.\n\nIt was 2004, just after 'Vol. 2' had been released in cinemas, and my friends had convinced me to come to a double-bill of both parts at the Astor Theatre in Melbourne, the first time the iconic picture palace had played both films back-to-back. I hadn't seen 'Vol. 1' when it was released the year before, not from lack of interest but a nerdy teenager insistence on following the rules (the first film was rated R18+, and I was still 16 at the time). I'm not even sure I'd seen a Quentin Tarantino film before. All my friends who had seen it though insisted that I come to this double bill, even though I still wasn't 18 yet. They marched me into the packed cinema, told me to sit in the middle of the front row of the balcony and watched me with anticipation as the curtains opened. They knew something I didn't, that this film was probably going to blow my fucking mind.\n\nThe opening shot of 'Vol. 1' is startling in its brutality and stillness, a black-and-white close-up of the angelic face of Uma Thurman battered and bloodied, terrified and pleading. In counterpoint to her distress is the calm disembodied voice of a man, solemnly explaining why he has no choice but the action he was about to take. Her distress increases, she hastily mumbles out an admission to this man Bill (a line I can barely hear), and then a thunderous gun shot rips through the speakers of the cinema, the screen cutting to black.\n\nTo this day, I have never jumped out of my seat with more animated surprise than at that gunshot. It shook my whole body, sent it into a state of shock. I clutched my chest, now stinging with pain. Of course I wasn't having a heart attack, I was a perfectly healthy 17-year-old, but that pain sat in my chest for the next four and a half hours, a reminder of the unforgiving way this film had pulled me in. And very quickly, I realised just how trapped I was by it. I may have physically left my seat in that opening minute, but it wouldn't be long before I would be elevating from my seat in ecstasy. 'Kill Bill' didn't just blow my fucking my mind, it blew me totally fucking apart.\n\nWiggle your big toe.\n\nWe take for granted now that 'Kill Bill' fits so easily into Quentin Tarantino's filmography. In fact, I would hazard a guess that, for most people, this kind of ostentatious filmmaking and operatic violence is what they think of when they think about his films. Viewed in context though, 'Kill Bill', and in particular 'Vol. 1', were without precedent. His first three films - the wonderfully raw 'Reservoir Dogs', the generation-defining 'Pulp Fiction' and the quiet classic 'Jackie Brown' - were films built primarily on Tarantino's cracking, witty scripts. The grand set pieces in those films were usually intricate dialogue scenes, mostly set around the communal act of sharing a meal. There was violence certainly, but that violence was usually underpinned by a shocking realism and real human panic (think Mr Orange writhing in pain or Maya taking the shot of adrenaline). They felt immediate, direct and contained, like three well-calibrated pressure cookers."
