Fox)’s daughter, Nikki. “The ultimate character I’d love to play is Vivica A.

Fox’s daughter in ‘Kill Bill,’ she said to the site. “There have been rumors about a potential Kill Bill Vol. 3, and that would just be amazing. It’s my favorite movie. It would be so cool.

According to the site, Tarantino said in a 2004 Entertainment Weekly interview that he needed “at least fifteen years before I do this again,” and the clock for the 15-year mark ends in 2019. “I’ve already got the whole mythology: Sofie Fatale (O-Ren Ishii’s second in command, played by Julie Dreyfus) will get all of Bill’s money. She’ll raise Nikki, who’ll take on The Bride,” he continued. “Nikki deserves her revenge every bit as much as The Bride deserved hers. I might even shoot a couple of scenes for it now, so I can get the actresses while they’re this age.”\n\nThe Kill Bill scene involving The Bride and Vernita is one of my favorite moments from the film, and even though the movie wasn’t about Vernita, I wish we had gotten more of her backstory. She was one of the more complex ones, what with her being a suburban mother, hoping to put her life of crime behind her. If we ever do get another Kill Bill featuring Nikki, I’d hope that we’d see more of her early life with her mother.\n\nAlso, just to put it out there, Stenberg does look a lot like the girl cast as Nikki, Ambrosia Kelley. It would be an easy casting decision, for sure. Of course, Tarantino could also just recast Kelley, since she’s still a working actress.\n\nIn any event, if Stenberg is ever able to live out her dream of playing Nikki, you can bet that the theaters will be jam-packed to see what happens. In Nikki, The Bride could finally have met her match."
