Very funny! „ ~ Last words of Vernita Green (also known as Copperhead).\n\nVernita Green, codenamed Copperhead, is a minor antagonist of the 2003 film Kill Bill Vol. 1, the first installment of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill film series.\n\nShe was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and the second target listed by it's renegade Beatarix Kiddo, who ends up killing Vernita as part of her intent to exact revenge on the DvAS members and their leader Bill for their attempt to assassinate her.\n\nShe was portrayed by Vivica A. Fox, who also portrayed Kate Tenny in Law & Order.\n\nBiography[]\n\nVernita was involved in the massacre at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel. She thus becomes second on The Bride's \"Death List Five\". Four years after the massacre she is living a normal life under the alias of Jeanie Bell. She is trained in hand-to-hand combat and knife fighting, and it is hinted that she and the Bride share a mutual, professional respect for each other.\n\nAt the start of the first movie, they engage in a vicious fight, destroying Vernita's living room in the process. However, Green's four-year-old daughter Nikki arrives home in the middle of the fight, and they stop fighting since the Bride doesn't want to kill Vernita in front of her daughter. Green sends Nikki to her room and she talks with the Bride over coffee, apologizing for betraying her and asking for mercy on behalf of her family. The Bride coldly refuses and they agree to meet in the middle of the night to have a knife fight.\n\nHowever, Vernita betrays her promise, and tries to shoot the Bride with a handgun concealed within a cereal box (aptly named Kaboom). She misses and the Bride throws a knife into her heart, killing her. Her death is witnessed by Nikki, which the Bride had not intended. The Bride tells Nikki that when she grows up if she seeks to avenge her mother's death, she will wait for her.\n\nNavigation[]\n\nVillains\n\nDeadly Viper Assassination Squad\n\nBill | Elle Driver | Budd | Vernita Green | O-Ren Ishii\n\nTokyo Yakuza\n\nO-Ren Ishii | Gogo Yubari | Sofie Fatale\n\nCrazy 88\n\nJohnny Mo\n\nOthers\n\nBuck | Esteban Vihaio | Matsumoto | Pretty Riki | Ernie"
