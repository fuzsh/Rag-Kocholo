        "text": "Vivica A. Fox wants revenge. While promoting her made-for-TV movie, 'Annie Clause is Coming to Town,' the actress was asked about a potential cameo in 'Kill Bill 3' (yes, there is one degree of separation between a Hallmark movie and a Quentin Tarantino franchise). In the first 'Kill Bill,' Fox played assassin Vernita Green, who is -- SPOILER -- killed by the Bride (Uma Thurman) right in front of her daughter. Although there aren't any official plans regarding a third movie, there have been rumors from Tarantino about a possible sequel, which would be set ten years in the future and feature Green's daughter looking to avenge her mother's death.\n\nSo, any chance of a Vernita Green flashback?\n\n\"Quentin Tarantino is such a genius, that I am really hoping it will either be a flashback or something that he can show Vernita Green playing with her daughter [Nikki], teaching her some moves, or passing on some messages that she remembers,\" Fox told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I would definitely tell her to 'Watch out with that cereal box, don't try that move on The Bride, cause she's also good with the knife.' Maybe it'll be a flashback or something like that, but I definitely hope to be a part of it.\"\n\nThe cereal box reference has to do with the actual Vernita-Bride fight scene. IMDb currently lists 'Kill Bill 3' with a very tentative 2014 release date. For now, Tarantino will be working on his spaghetti western flick, 'Django Unchained,' starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jamie Foxx, which hits theaters Christmas Day 2012."
