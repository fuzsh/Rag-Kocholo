        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Quentin Tarantino is the king of violent yet entertaining films. And while he has often said he has done enough, fans want one more film for old times' sake. Recently, a star from the original 'Kill Bill' movie called upon the 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' director to create another 'Kill Bill' movie, citing fan demand for it. The actor was none other than Vivica A Fox, who played the role of Vernita 'Copperhead' Green who is a part of a Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. In the first film, she gets killed in front of her four-year-old daughter, Nikki, by Uma Thurman's character Beatrix 'The Bride' Kiddo. What is more, Kiddo tells the kid, \"Your mother had it coming. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.\"\n\n'Kill Bill' was released in 2003 and since then, Volume 1 and Volume 2 of the film have captured the attention of the fans with its great cinematography, music, color grading and distinguished screenplay. Originally ideated as a stand-alone film, it was actually made into two-parts and was released with a gap of a year in-between. The project was met with both popular and critical acclaim, with many critics considering the movies to be Tarantino's best work.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nQuentin Tarantino says 'Kill Bill Vol. 3' is definitely 'in the cards': 'I have an idea now that could be interesting'\n\n‘You can’t refute that’: Samuel L Jackson SLAMS Quentin Tarantino for saying Marvel actors are 'not movie stars'\n\nTalking to Variety, Vivica A Fox shared some of the conversations that happened during the release of the first two movies and how Tarantino mentioned making a third film. “I’ve been waiting,” she said. “They said it’s going to be my daughter growing up. I know he’ll figure out some kind of way…maybe I’ll be in a flashback. I’d love to work Quentin again and I’d love to work with Uma again. It was a lot of training.\"\n\nFox has also picked out an actress who she thinks would kill it as Green's daughter out to avenge her mom's death by hunting Beatrix Kiddo. And it is none other than Zendaya. \"Zendaya… she’s beautiful, she’s amazing. She’s winning Emmys,” Fox says. “We’d have to fit it in her schedule. She’s killing the game.” However Fox hasn't been in touch with Tarantino in a long time. “I haven’t talked to Quentin in a little bit. The last time I saw him I got invited to a party during his Oscar run for [“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”], the film with Leo [DiCaprio] and Brad [Pitt]. He had a great party on Sunset. Now he’s a dad! He might be taking some time to enjoy fatherhood.”"
