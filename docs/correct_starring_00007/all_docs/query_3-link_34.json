        "text": "In December last year, Quentin Tarantino said a third film in the Kill Bill franchise was “definitely on the cards”, but warned fans that it might not arrive for “at least three years”. Now, it looks like that promise is still on track, as the director is still in talks with Uma Thurman about another sequel.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, actor Vivica A. Fox – who played Beatrix Kiddo’s (Thurman) assassin nemesis, Vernita Green – said she was excited about the prospect of a Kill Bill: Volume 3. “The last I’ve heard is that (Tarantino) and Uma have been talking,” revealed Fox, “and I’d love for them to figure it out. Quentin is great with flashbacks and figuring out some kind of way to make his characters alive again in a film, so I’m really hoping that Vernita Green gets her revenge.”\n\nIn Kill Bill: Volume 1, Kiddo murders Green as payback for her role in the Massacre at Two Pines, which killed everyone at Kiddo’s wedding rehearsal four years earlier. Immediately after Green’s death, her daughter Nikki walks into the room, and is told by Kiddo that if she wants to avenge her mother’s death, she will be waiting. Fox believes this storyline is why the film hasn’t been made yet, telling The Hollywood Reporter: “I think they’re waiting for (Vernita’s) daughter to grow up.”\n\nDiscussing the rigorous training that the actors had to endure before filming Kill Bill, Fox said: “Oh my god, I trained for six months. I literally went from a size eight to a size two. It was intense and gruelling, but I loved every single bump and bruise. I’ll never forget the fourth and final day of filming the fight – I counted 30 bruises on my body, and I was proud of every single one of them. I earned them.”"
