        "text": "When SZA dropped her \"Kill Bill\" video earlier this month, fans noticed she recruited Vivica A. Fox, who co-starred in the Quentin Tarantino film of the same name. The visual marked the temporary return of Fox's character Copperhead, but according to the actress, people took it as a sign that more is to come.\n\n\"Oh my gosh. Did that go viral or what? People were making up their own storylines!\" she tells People. \"My phone blew up that day and the internet as well. Yeah, I think people thought it's gonna be this thing.\"\n\n\"They were like, 'Yes! SZA is playing Vivica Fox's daughter in Kill Bill! Now we know! She's gonna come back and go after Uma Thurman,'\" Vivica continued. \"I'm like, 'Not exactlyâ€¦' So that was great.\"\n\nShe clarified that SZA is reimagining Thurman's character in the video and added that the response to the overall clip is enough to believe that \"People have really been waiting on Kill Bill 3.\"\n\nWhen asked whether she's heard any rumors about the potential film, Fox replied, \"Just like everybody else, I heard that if we do Kill Bill 3, it [might] be about my 'daughter' seeking revenge.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Quentin works when he wants to, honey.\""
