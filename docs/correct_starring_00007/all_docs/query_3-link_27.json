        "text": "Oscar-winning filmmaker Quentin Tarantino has publicly expressed his desire to only direct ten films during his career over the past few years and if he sticks to his decision, he would only have one movie left before he walks away from the director’s chair.\n\nFollowing the release of 2019 hit Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Tarantino announced Kill Bill Vol. 3 is still on the table and he has an idea on how to continue The Bride’s story following the death of Bill in the second instalment.\n\nNow, in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kill Bill star Vivica A. Fox, who played Vernita Green a.k.a. Copperhead, revealed she is still hoping the third instalment will be developed so her character’s daughter can get revenge on Uma Thurman’s Beatrix Kiddo after Vernita was murdered in the opening sequence of Kill Bill Vol. 1.\n\n“Oh my gosh, I can’t wait. It rears its ugly head every couple of years,” Fox said when discussing rumours of a third film. “They’ll say, ‘So, Vivica, Kill Bill 3, they’re trying to make a sequel to all your movies,’ and I’m like, ‘I think they’re waiting for my daughter to grow up.’ And then you always hear that Quentin falls in and out of love with Hollywood. He’s like, ‘I’m done, I’m back, I’m done.’ So, the latest I’ve heard is that him and Uma have been talking, and I’d love for them to figure it out. Quentin is great with flashbacks and figuring out some kind of way to make his characters alive again in a film. So, I’m really hoping that Vernita Green gets her revenge.”\n\nKill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2, which were released in 2003 and 2004 respectively, follows Uma Thurman as the Bride, who starts a campaign of revenge against the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and their leader Bill (David Carradine), who tried to kill her and her unborn child."
