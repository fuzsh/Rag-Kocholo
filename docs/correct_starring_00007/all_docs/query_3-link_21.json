        "text": "Vivica Fox wants to come back for a third Kill Bill movie, following her character's daughter on a quest for revenge against The Bride.\n\nBy Sean Thiessen |\n\nSince Kill Bill: Vol. 2 released in 2004, fans of Quentin Tarantino’s bloody martial arts revenge tale have been chomping at the bit for a third film. Now one of Tarantino’s cast members has spoken up about the sequel. Actress Vivica A. Fox, who portrayed the assassin Vernita Green in the original film, told Variety that she has been waiting for Kill Bill 3 to happen.\n\nFox’s Vernita Green met a gruesome fate at the hands of Uma Thurman’s The Bride, but she is hopeful that Tarantino could find a place for her character in Kill Bill 3. “They said it’s going to be my daughter growing up,” Fox told Variety. “I know he’ll figure out some kind of way…maybe I’ll be in a flashback. I’d love to work with Quentin again and I’d love to work with Uma again.”\n\nKill Bill 3 is rumored to follow Vernita Green’s daughter, who witnessed The Bride kill her mother, on a quest for revenge. The scene in which Green’s daughter discovers her murdered mother ends with The Bride telling her, “When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I’ll be waiting.” The third film, were it to be made, would payoff of that very line.\n\nVivica A. Fox’s top pick for the actress to play her grown daughter is Zendaya, though she acknowledged that Zendaya’s superstar success means they’d have to work around the actress’s busy schedule. Rumors are circulating that Stranger Things star Maya Hawke, Uma Thurman’s real-life daughter, might also make an appearance alongside her mother in Kill Bill 3.\n\nAmid all the excitement and speculation from the Kill Bill cast, and even some interest from Tarantino himself, there is no official word on when the project will come together, if it will at all. Quentin Tarantino has long said that he hopes to retire from filmmaking after his tenth film, which means that whatever film is next could likely be his last. The director has expressed interest in a multitude of projects that could fill that slot, and Kill Bill 3 has some tough competition.\n\nTarantino has teased his desire to make a Star Trek film, Pulp Fiction prequel, or another Western. One thing he has never done is make a sequel. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 were made as one film and split in two to reduce the runtimes of each part. If Tarantino does make Kill Bill 3, it will be his first sequel project.\n\nWhile Kill Bill 3 remains a mystery, Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman have plenty of work on their plates. Fox will appear in the upcoming drama film Every Day and the comedy Not Another Church Movie. Uma Thurman is set to appear alongside Charlize Theron in Netflix’s sequel The Old Guard 2 and in the comedy film Red White and Royal Blue.\n\nThe pieces of Kill Bill 3 are certainly there, and fan interest in the film has been brewing for the better part of two decades. If Quentin Tarantino does decide to pull the trigger on a third film, he can at least count on Vivica A. Fox to do whatever it takes to make the movie happen. Until then, fans of The Bride will be left to dream about the possibilities and hope that Quentin Tarantino believes his pen is mighty enough to bring back The Bride’s blood-soaked samurai sword."
