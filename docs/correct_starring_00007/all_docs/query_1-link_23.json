        "text": "Once again I think QT has hit gold with this choice. I personally love Vivica, I truly thought her career would take off after Independence Day, but she has been stuck in B-movie, straight-to-video hell and I’m not really sure why. She has this sultry, almost gritty tone to her voice that I can literally hear when she and Uma have their scene in the house. I can see why Quentin chose her for Vernita. She has bad-ass housewife written all over her. She’s gorgeous, but she has a street edge to her. It seems Quentin likes people that you can almost smell on-screen. Thats why I love him as a writer and a director.\n\nMaybe after this she will get more play in hollywood. I may be a little bias since she grew up in my home town. But she’s still going to work it in Kill Bill. Any thoughts?\n\nChiaki Kuriyama (not much info for the non-japanese reading audience, but still a few pictures and some other interesting stuff)\n\nAnd yes, chia_kun you should definitely see Battle Royale. One of the greatest japanese films of recent times.\n\nTo stay on topic…\n\nI imagine Fox will do a good job, she’s never really impressed me in the past (other than her looks) but i think she’ll do well in this role. She always kind of struck me as the kind of actress who would work in television rather than film, but that’s just me.\n\nNo use staying on topic, i’ve already said my piece\n\nAbout Battle Royale…\n\nKind of depends on where you live, if you live in the states you’re probably going to have a hard time finding it in a video store. I’m pretty sure it hasn’t had an offifial release over here yet, some say because of columbine (the movie is about kids killing kids) but i also heard that the company releasing it was wanting too much money to release over here or something. I’m betting on the columbine thing myself. It’s still fairly easy to find though, HkFlix has a regionless dvd of it, and i’m sure there are plenty of other online places that have it.\n\nI’ve seen her in quite a bit.\n\nOne of her most recent flicks, Two can play that game, is a romantic comedy which uses that “In-your-face” narrative that’s been done in FERRIS BUELLER’S DAY OFF. You know, the type of “breaking down the wall” stuff where the character looks into the camera and talks to us,the audience. Which isn’t really a bad thing here since Vivica is very easy on the eyes. Besides her beautiful presence, You can see that these type of roles were made specifically for Miss Fox. As far as wits,charm,sass, and charisma. Not too many could display all this stuff quite like her.\n\nAiight, if the sappy, love-story really aint your thing. You CANT go wrong with Set it Off! In this one, we got Jada Pinkett-Smith (Lead character) Queen Latifah (The scene-stealing, Lezbo) Vivica (A former bank-teller) and Kimberly Elise (The pee-wee of the bunch) all playing best friends who resort to bank robbing.\n\nI remember seeing this one in the theaters being pleasantly surprised by it. It’s sharply written, well-acted, and its action sequences are top notch given the budget. As for Vivica, she doesn’t have a whole lot to do besides the memorable opening act, and towards the film’s finale. But this just goes to show how great Vivica looks holding a gun! I recommend this one.\n\nBooty Call should be viewed only if you want to see Viv in her undies.\n\nLast, but not least, Soul Food is the affectionate,funny, family melodrama. Again, not a whole lot of Viv to be found here, but that shouldn’t stop one from not watching this film cuz everyone I know who has seen it, Including myself, really likes it. The quintessential soap-opera flick!\n\nThat’s all for now, check 'em out if you wish!"
