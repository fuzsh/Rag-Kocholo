        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has been busy. While talks of his retirement are continuing to dominate headlines, the director has committed his devotion to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood by adapting it into a novel and, now, flirted ideas of turning what appears to be his magnum opus into a stage play production.\n\nWhile the talk of pushing his unique take on the Manson Family into new mediums is all good and well, it has left fans of Tarantino positively salivating at what feature ideas he has left in the tank to complete his filmography. While a Reservoir Dogs reboot was mooted and quickly dismissed, the creation of his long-discussed Kill Bill Vol. 3 plans have resurfaced.\n\n“I think it’s just revisiting the characters twenty years later and just imagining the Bride and her daughter, Bebe, having 20 years of peace, and then that peace is shattered,” Tarantino said in an interview with The Joe Rogan Experience. “And now The Bride and Bebe are on the run and just the idea of being able to cast Uma [Thurman] and cast her daughter Maya [Hawke] in the thing would be fucking exciting.”\n\nTarantino has lightly plotted out the potential Kill Bill Vol. 3 plans, one which would be centred around Vernita Green, the daughter of Vivica A. Fox’s character, who is attempting to avenge her mother’s killing by hunting down Uma Thurman’s character ‘The Bride’. According to multiple sources, Fox has also pitched Zendaya to play the role of the daughter.\n\n“Elle Driver is still out there, Sophie Fatale got her arm cut off, but she’s still out there,” Tarantino told Rogan. “They all got Bill’s money. Actually, Gogo had a twin sister Shiaki and so her twin sister could show up,” he added, alluding that Daryl Hannah and Julie Dreyfus could also make a return to the story.\n\nCasting Hawke in the role of The Bride’s daughter would be quintessential Tarantino, creating a full circle moment that combines the real-life family element of mother and daughter with that on the big screen. “I grew up around Quentin and around those movies,” Hawke previously told ET in 2019. “They meant a lot to me and the story of my family and my growing up, so it’s wonderful to add my own little piece to the puzzle. It was wonderful to follow [in my mother’s] footsteps, just for a second, in that way and relate to her and experience some of what she experienced and it was wonderful.”\n\nAdding: “[Quentin’s] really supportive and enthusiastic about making the best movie possible,” she said of the director. “And, you know, when he gives you notes and ideas … he’s so excited and driven because he really wants it to be the best and he knows what’s going to be the best. And so it’s just thrilling and intoxicating to be directed by him.”"
