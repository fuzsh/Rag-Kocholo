        "text": "Hollywood Shuffle is a series that celebrates our cultural icons in film and television whose performances have resonated with generations of viewers. From the pioneering actors and actresses who’ve helped break barriers and pave the way for those to follow, to the most promising and decorated thespians of today, their dedication to their craft is respected and appreciated.\n\nVivica A. Fox is one of Black Hollywood’s most beloved actresses. Hailing from Michigan, Fox got her start on the small screen with daytime soap opera roles before landing her first significant film gigs in 1996 with Don’t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood and Independence Day. It wasn’t until the latter that Fox began to make a name for herself as Hollywood actress.\n\nFox kept busy with even more television shows before landing her next big role as Maxine in Set it Off. The ASCAP-winning film co-starred Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Kimberly Elise. It was there that viewers began to see Fox’s versatility, as she played a hard-working woman-turned bank robber in the film. Over the next several years, the revered actress went on to star in Booty Call, Soul Food, Why Do Fools Fall In Love, the Two Can Play That Game film series, Juwanna Mann, the Kill Bill film series and more.\n\nOver the last two decades, Fox has taken on the gig of TV hosting and producing. Fox’s Lifetime crime series Missing won her an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series in 2006. She’s also competed on season three of ABC’s Dancing with the Stars, and more recently cameoed in SZA’s “Kill Bill” music video. As she turns 59 years old today (July 30), Fox continues to prove that she has no plans of stopping any time soon.\n\nIn this edition of Hollywood Shuffle, VIBE looks back on eight iconic roles that have defined Vivica A. Fox’s career."
