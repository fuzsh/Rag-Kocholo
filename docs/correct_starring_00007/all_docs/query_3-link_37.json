        "text": "Kill Bill: Volume 3 – Quentin Tarantino has been teasing it for years, even though the titular villain is dead.\n\nThe plan is apparently for the daughter of Vernita Green to try to murder Beatrix Kiddo, who killed her mother in the first film, thereby continuing the cycle of revenge.\n\nIt's been 16 years since the last movie, so what's going on? Luckily, Vivica A Fox has been speaking to The Hollywood Reporter about just that topic.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, I can't wait,\" she said, when asked about a third movie. \"I think they're waiting for [Vernita's] daughter to grow up.\n\n\"So, the latest I've heard is that [Quentin] and Uma [Thurman] have been talking, and I'd love for them to figure it out. Quentin is great with flashbacks and figuring out some kind of way to make his characters alive again in a film.\n\n\"So, I'm really hoping that Vernita Green gets her revenge.\"\n\nRelated: Quentin Tarantino movies ranked, from Reservoir Dogs to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nReminiscing about her iconic fight scene, the actress said: \"Oh my God, I trained for six months. I literally went from a size 8 to a size 2. It was intense and gruelling, but I loved every single bump and bruise.\n\n\"I'll never forget the fourth and final day of filming the fight – I counted 30 bruises on my body, and I was proud of every single one of them. I earned them.\"\n\nRelated: Quentin Tarantino offers update on his Star Trek movie\n\nIn 2018, Uma Thurman released footage of a crash that happened on the set of the film, which she called \"negligent to the point of criminality\", although she did not believe there was \"malicious intent\". Tarantino later called the incident \"one of the biggest regrets of [his] life\".\n\nLast year, the director said he had dinner with Thurman and they shared ideas for a third movie, although he says he's got some other projects he intends to tackle first.\n\nDigital Spy now has a newsletter – sign up to get it sent straight to your inbox."
