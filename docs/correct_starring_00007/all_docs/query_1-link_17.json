        "text": "A lot of Quentin Tarantino fans would love to see the filmmaker make Kill Bill Vol. 3. He’s teased it in the past, but he claims that he’s only directing one more movie in his career, and I seriously doubt that will be it. But, Kill Bill star Vivica A. Fox is now calling on him to make a third film in the series.\n\nYes, her character was killed off, but she’s still 100% on board with the sequel and wants even wants Zendaya to play her daughter. This makes sense because the film would have to explore her daughter seeking revenge against Beatrix (Uma Thurman) for killing her mother.\n\nDuring an interview with Variety, Fox said: \"People are hungry. Quentin, let's go!\" She went on to say: \"I've been waiting ... They said it's going to be my daughter growing up. I know he'll figure out some kind of way...maybe I'll be in a flashback. I'd love to work Quentin again and I'd love to work with Uma again. It was a lot of training.\"\n\nFox then went on to talk about casting Zendaya saying: \"Zendaya... she's beautiful, she's amazing. She's winning Emmys. We'd have to fit it in her schedule. She's killing the game.\"\n\nNow, this isn't the first time Fox has supported Zendaya taking on the role, with Zendaya herself having previously reacted to Fox's dream casting saying: \"I saw that! I was quite honored that she would say that. Obviously, she's incredible and I'm very flattered that she would think of me. But, you know, it's just an idea. The Internet kinda takes things and runs with it.\"\n\nOn top of that, Uma Thurman’s daughter Maya Hawke is also up for joining the project as Beatrix's daughter if it ever happens. Tarantino also loves that idea saying: \"I think it’s just revisiting the characters twenty years later and just imagining the Bride and her daughter, BB, having 20 years of peace, and then that peace is shattered. And now the Bride and BB are on the run and just the idea of being able to cast Uma [Thurman] and cast her daughter Maya [Hawke] in the thing would be f**king exciting.\"\n\nThe filmmaker also said: “I wouldn't be surprised if The Bride made one more appearance before the whole thing is said and done.” He’s been talking to Uma Thurman about his ideas, and in regards to those ideas for The Bride, he said, “I wouldn't want to just come up with some cockamamie adventure - she doesn't deserve that. The Bride has fought long and hard. Now I have an idea that actually could be interesting.”\n\nNow, Tarantino may not make a Kill Bill Vol. 3 movie, but he could do it as a limited series! That would be a great way to go as well! So, there still is a chance that the Kill Bill story could continue. Tarantino has been interesting in making this for a long time, so why wouldn’t he do it!?"
