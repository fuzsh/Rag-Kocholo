        "text": "Well, it looks like Independence Day and Idle Hands actress Vivica A. Fox is ready to return for Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill Vol. 3 – if the filmmaker even gets around to making it.\n\nShe tells THR: “Oh my gosh, I can’t wait. It rears its ugly head every couple of years. They’ll say, “So, Vivica, Kill Bill 3, they’re trying to make a sequel to all your movies,” and I’m like, “I think they’re waiting for my daughter to grow up.” And then you always hear that Quentin falls in and out of love with Hollywood. He’s like, “I’m done, I’m back, I’m done.” (Laughs.) So, the latest I’ve heard is that him and Uma have been talking, and I’d love for them to figure it out. Quentin is great with flashbacks and figuring out some kind of way to make his characters alive again in a film. So, I’m really hoping that [she] gets her revenge. Revenge is a dish best served cold!“\n\nRELATED: BRUCE WILLIS WAS ALMOST BILL IN KILL BILL\n\nBring it on, I say!\n\nWould you like to see Vivica A. Fox return for Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill Vol. 3? Make sure to let us know what you think in the comments below or on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram!\n\nRELATED: IS KILL BILL ONE MOVIE OR TWO? QUENTIN TARANTINO SETS THE RECORD STRAIGHT\n\nThe first film follows a former assassin, known simply as The Bride who wakes from a coma four years after her jealous ex-lover Bill attempts to murder her on her wedding day. Fueled by an insatiable desire for revenge, she vows to get even with every person who contributed to the loss of her unborn child, her entire wedding party, and four years of her life. After devising a hit list, The Bride sets off on her quest, enduring unspeakable injury and unscrupulous enemies.\n\nRated R for strong bloody violence, language, and some sexual content, the first film sports an 85% on Rotten Tomatoes with a Critics Consensus that reads: Kill Bill is admittedly little more than a stylish revenge thriller — albeit one that benefits from a wildly inventive surfeit of style.\n\nRELATED: QUENTIN TARANTINO & UMA THURMAN HAVE DISCUSSED MAKING KILL BILL: VOL. 3\n\nThe second film found The Bride picking up where she left off in volume one with her quest to finish the hit list she has composed of all of the people who have wronged her, including ex-boyfriend Bill, who tried to have her killed four years ago during her wedding to another man. Leaving several dead in her wake, she eventually tracks down Bill in Mexico. Using skills she has learned during her assassin career, she attempts to finish what she set out to do in the first place.\n\nRated R for violence, language, and brief drug use, it sports an 84% on Rotten Tomatoes with a Critics Consensus that reads: Kill Bill: Volume 2 adds extra plot and dialogue to the action-heavy exploits of its predecessor, while still managing to deliver a suitably hard-hitting sequel."
