The singer released the music video for her hit single, \"Kill Bill,\" and the nod to the Quentin Tarantino films of the same name features a special cameo by the fan-favorite assassin Copperhead, played by Vivica A. Fox.\n\nFox, who played assassin Vernita Green/Jeanie Bell/Copperhead in Kill Bill: Volume 1 and Kill Bill: Volume 2, briefly appears in the music video to drive SZA away from her bullet-ridden trailer home after the singer is betrayed by her murderous ex-boyfriend. Although Fox doesn't wear Copperhead's signature purple velour tracksuit, her appearance is one of the many references to the movies in the action-packed video, directed by Christian Breslauer.\n\nThe video's other allusions include SZA's woman scorned -- inspired by Uma Thurman's The Bride -- Budd's trailer, O-Ren's anime sequence, and the showdown at the House of the Blue Leaves.\n\nThe single is the second from SZA's No. 1 album SOS, which has reached a month sitting at the top of the Billboard 200 chart, breaking multiple records. It's the first R&B album by a woman to spend four weeks at No. 1 since Alicia Keys' As I Am earned a fourth and final nonconsecutive week at the top in February of 2008; the first R&B album by a woman to spend its first four weeks at No. 1 in nearly 30 years, since Janet Jackson's Janet ruled for its first six weeks; the first album by a woman to spend its first four weeks at No. 1 since Adele's 30 ruled for its first six weeks; and the first album by a woman to have four consecutive weeks at No. 1 since 30's six week-run at No. 1.\n\nSZA took to social media to celebrate the album's accomplishments, posting to both Twitter and Instagram to thank her fans for their support.\n\n\"I don‚Äôt have s**t to say but thank you to God my ancestors my family my team and ALL OF YOU THAT RIDE FOR ME ! ESPECIALLY CAMP ‚õ∫Ô∏è!! Y‚Äôall my family too ü§ç we have so much more to come,\" she captioned an Instagram carousel featuring a fan-made poster exclaiming her success.\n\nSZA is set to kick off her first arena tour next month. The GRAMMY winner will embark on a 17-date trek with guest artist Omar Apollo, beginning in Columbus, Ohio, and wrapping up in Los Angeles. See here for a full list of dates, ticket info and more.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSZA Makes History as 'SOS' Spends 4th Week at No. 1 on Billboard 200\n\nSZA Shuts Down Alleged Beef With Taylor Swift: 'Love to Everyone'\n\nLady Gaga Carried SZA's Dress After Losing to Her at the GRAMMYs"
