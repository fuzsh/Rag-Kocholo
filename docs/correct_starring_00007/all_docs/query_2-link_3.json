        "text": "“ Very funny, bitch. Very funny! ”\n\n–Vernita's final words\n\nBiography[]\n\nVernita Green was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and was involved with the Massacre at Two Pines thus causing herself to be named on the Death List Five by Beatrix Kiddo.\n\nMassacre[]\n\nVernita took part in the Massacre at Two Pines, killing all those who attended Beatrix Kiddo and her fiancé's wedding rehearsal. Vernita; Codename Copperhead, accompanied by the remaining Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, stood above Beatrix's living body, moments before Bill re-entered the chapel and shot her.\n\nNew Life[]\n\nEventually, Vernita left her career as an assassin, and went on to marry a doctor named Lawrence Bell, under the alias of Jeannie Bell. Vernita soon gave birth to their daughter, Nikkia Bell.\n\nDeath[]\n\nFour years after the Two Pines massacre, Vernita received a visit from Beatrix, which triggered an immediate fight between the two. After wrecking the living room while having a hand-to-hand combat, Nikki's school bus dropped her off, forcing the two to pause the intense fight. Vernita presented Beatrix as an old friend, and ordered Nikki to go up to her room, as the two of them had some unfinished business.\n\nVernita offered a cup of coffee to Beatrix, and the two confronted each other about the events of the past. While Vernita attempted to apologize for her actions four years ago claiming she is a new person with only her family in mind, Beatrix claimed that the only fair way would be for her to kill Vernita, her husband and her daughter.\n\nThe two then decided on a knife duel in a baseball diamond during the night as the conclusion to their hostility.\n\nVernita then attempted to shoot Beatrix, with a gun hidden in a Kaboom cereal box, however her shot went astray thus giving Kiddo enough time to pull and throw her knife. The blade plunged square into Vernita's chest, sealing her fate and ending her chapter in the story.\n\nNikki walked into the kitchen moments after her mother's death, unbeknownst to Beatrix. After noticing the little girl standing there, Kiddo wipes the blood from her blade and says \"It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it comin'. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it... I'll be waitin'\"\n\nCode Name[]\n\nThe Copperhead is an ambush predator. It prefers to avoid humans and will leave the area without biting if possible. This refers to Green’s use of the Kaboom cereal box and her attempt to talk the Bride out of a fight.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nVernita is a beautiful African American woman of short height and slim but toned figure showing signs of athleticism. She has mocha skin, dark brown eyes, and full lips with beige lipstick. Her long brown hair is worn in cornrows when she is first presented. She wears dark but comfortable clothes.\n\nSkills[]\n\nEdged weapon proficiency: Although Bill doesn't give compliments easily, he claims that Vernita was the best woman with an edged weapon he had ever seen, which is serious praise coming from him. She also managed to hold her own against the bride when she had a knife in her hand. It was also her fighting style of choice, when asked by Beatrix how the two should face off.\n\nHand-to-hand Combat: Not as skilled as Beatrix, she was still extremely proficient as she managed to acquit and defend herself well against the onslaught of attacks.\n\nImprovised weapons: During her showdown with the Bride, she used common objects to injure and knock her back, using them as effective non-conventional weapons.\n\nMiscellaneous skills: As an assassin of Bill's team, she was endowed with high physical prowess such as reflexes, stamina, speed, and strength. When asked how she preferred to die by Beatrix, she chose to fight with a knife at nighttime dressed completely in black. This is a hint that she is confident in her stealth and low vision fighting capabilities, fighting in the pitch black night-time or other non-illuminated environments.\n\nTrivia[]"
