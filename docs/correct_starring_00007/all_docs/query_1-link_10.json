        "text": "It has been 20 years since Quentin Tarantino gave the world Kill Bill, a two-part revenge-driven epic about a former assassin who goes on a one-woman odyssey to get back at her former assassination squad that left her for dead on her wedding day years earlier. The movie still remains one of Tarantino's best efforts a couple decades later thanks in part to its cast and those incredible fight sequences, especially the suburban showdown between Uma Thurman’s The Bride and Vivica A. Fox’s Vernita Green.\n\nFox recently sat down with CinemaBlend to discuss her new true crime series, The Interrogation Room, as well as a number of other topics, like her role in Kill Bill Vol. 1. When asked how she prepared for the nearly 10-minute sequence, the Copperhead actress was quick to respond:\n\nWait... a booty light? The actress continued:\n\nThe rigorous training regime, which honestly sounds like something meant for the most hardcore of martial artists or professional athletes, led to some unforeseen consequences for the actress and other co-stars who went through the program. Fox explained:\n\nDespite the intense training and daily stretching routines to be loose enough to perform on screen, Fox still looks back fondly on the role. In fact, the actress previously gone on the record serveral times to pitch a idea of her ow for Kill Bill Vol. 3. While there has long been talk of another Kill Bill movie, there are currently no concrete plans for a threequel, but hey, that could all change."
