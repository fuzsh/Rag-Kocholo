        "text": "Vernita Green, codenamed Copperhead, was a character from Kill Bill. She was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (along with O-Ren Ishii and Elle Driver) and took part in the massacre at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel. She was second on The Bride's \"Death List Five\", although the first one to have been murdered.\n\nShe was portrayed by Vivica A. Fox.\n\nFour years after the massacre, Vernita was living a normal life under the alias of Jeanie Bell. She is trained in hand-to-hand combat and knife fighting, and it is hinted that she and the Bride share a mutual, professional respect for each other. At the start of the first movie, they engage in a vicious fight, destroying Vernita's living room in the process. However, Green's four-year-old daughter Nikki arrives home in the middle of the fight, and they stop fighting since the Bride doesn't want to kill Vernita in front of her young daughter.\n\nGreen sends Nikki to her room and she talks with the Bride over coffee, apologizing for betraying her and asking for mercy on behalf of her family. The Bride coldly refuses and they agree to meet in the middle of the night to have a knife fight. However, Vernita betrays her promise, and tries to shoot the Bride with a handgun concealed within a cereal box (aptly named Kaboom). She misses and the Bride throws a knife into her heart, killing her. Her death is witnessed by Nikki, which the Bride had not intended. The Bride tells Nikki that when she grows up, if she seeks to avenge her mother's death, she will wait for her. The Bride seems to be slightly sad as she leaves Vernita's house and gets into her car, indicating that at one time they were close friends.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nVivica A. Fox went on to appear in the 2014 film Mercenaries as the evil Raven, and also provided the voice of serial killer Poison from Mr. Pickles."
