Nintendo has launched Animal Crossing Plaza on Wii U, which is a place fans can go and chat about their towns and share images with other players from all over the world.

The free application was announced during todayâ€™s Nintendo Direct presentation and allows fans to interact and exchange information through the Animal Crossing Miiverse community.

Players can import images they took in Animal Crossing: New Leaf on 3DS, custom design QR Code patterns via their SD cards and organize them in albums. Players also can post messages to Miiverse with those images. The QR Code patterns posted can also be directly scanned and used in Animal Crossing: New Leaf and users can select their favorite animal in the to post about those specific animals or view posts only about them.

If players want to see more posts, they can jump directly to the Animal Crossing series Miiverse community from Animal Crossing Plaza.

The service will run through the end of 2014.
