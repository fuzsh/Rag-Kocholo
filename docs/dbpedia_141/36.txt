The Animal Crossing experience is spreading to the Wii U. Today, Nintendo announced Animal Crossing Plaza for its home console during this morning Nintendo Direct web show. This is basically an Animal Crossing version of the Mii Plaza that greets Wii U owners when they power on their system.

Animal Crossing Plaza is available for free to download now.

“In [Animal Crossing Plaza], you can see various quotes about what happened in your town, news about Animal Crossing calendar events, and messages from other Animal Crossing fans from around the world,” Nintendo chief executive Satoru Iwata said.

Players can share their images from Animal Crossing: New Leaf, which is available on the 3DS, to the game’s Miiverse page on Wii U. Each Animal Crossing character also has their own subcommunity, so that means all of those Isabelle fans out there can talk about their love for her in a safe place.
