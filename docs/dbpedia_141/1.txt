Animal Crossing fans who own a Wii U have something to be happy about this week as Nintendo UK has announced that Animal Crossing: Wild World is arriving on the Wii U Virtual Console. You will be able to get your hands on the game on Thursday, November 19th and it will cost you €9.99 / £8.99.

Welcome to the friendly village of Animal Crossing! Every player’s village is unique and it’s up to you to decide how you spend your time there, and which characters you befriend. Time will pass in real time, so different activities and surprises happen depending on the time of the day. Return to the village frequently to discover special events only happening on certain dates, such as birthdays and other celebrations. (Online and multiplayer features are not available in this version.)
