In a new instalment to the hugely popular series, Animal Crossing: Let’s Go to the City not only allows players to create their own perfect life in the country but also introduces an exciting new city area to explore! With many new features such as the new Wii Speak accessory which enables you to chat to other players in the game, Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City is the perfect place for you to create your ideal world when it launches across Europe in December 2008.\n\nAnimal Crossing: Let's Go to the City is a fun and engaging life simulation where you can take control and shape the world around you from decorating your house to creating constellations in the heavens. Start the game in your own quiet town and meet many enriching animal characters along the way as you collect new furniture, wallpaper and carpets to make your house a home. Alternatively, simply while away the hours with a spot of fishing or gardening - there are no pressures in the world of Animal Crossing, you can live the life you wish to lead.\n\nThe city environment introduces a thrilling new area with exciting shops and entertainment opportunities to experience. Simply jump on the bus from your town and take a trip to visit the theatre to watch a show or even visit Gracie Grace, the large and exclusive department store that sells special items and furniture with which you can customise your home. You can even change the appearance of your own character at the hair salon, giving him or her your favourite Mii look, and compete with other players by selling and bidding for items at the auction house.\n\nAdding to the fun, Animal Crossing: Let’s Go to the City operates in real-time. If 24 hours has passed in the real world, the same amount of time will also have passed in your town. This feature allows you to experience seasons and special days like Halloween and national holidays as they happen in real life.\n\nAnimal Crossing: Let’s Go to the City is a title the whole family can enjoy together as it introduces a number of great ways for all to share their Animal Crossing lives with others around the globe. Using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can send friends letters and items from the post office located in each town. Why not even visit them yourself? Travel to a friend’s town to explore their unique Animal Crossing environment or invite them to visit you, regardless of where they live in the world!\n\nFor the first time on Wii, get ready to chat with friends as Animal Crossing: Let’s Go to the City introduces the new Wii Speak accessory, which allows players to talk to each other in the game. This exciting new accessory sits above the Wii sensor bar on your television set and enables anyone in the room to speak with friends in another location. Use Wii Speak when visiting a friend’s town or being visited to explore, chat and enjoy Animal Crossing together via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.\n\nFor players who have a personal attachment to their character in Animal Crossing: Wild World on the Nintendo DS, this new title will allow the transfer of some character data to Wii. The Nintendo DS can also be used as a ‘suitcase’, allowing players to take their character to and from a friend’s Wii console to explore their Animal Crossing world.\n\nGet ready for a slice of country and city life as Animal Crossing: Let’s Go to the City launches across Europe on Wii in December 2008."
