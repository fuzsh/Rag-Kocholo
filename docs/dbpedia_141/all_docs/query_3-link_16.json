I don't have Lottie's amiibo figure... maybe I'll get one if it goes on sale.\n\nI've already got Isabelle (summer outfit), Celeste, Kicks, Tommy&Timmy, Mabel, Tom Nook (those last two were sold really cheap one day on amazon)\n\nAnd I also have the Squid Girl and Gannondorf figurines for Inkwell and Ganon's stuff... Apparently not everyone has special 3DS models though. OH I forgot about this... Mabel has a 3DS for Mabel AND Sable...\n\nhttp://steamsignature.com/profile/english/76561197969913402.png http://i.imgur.com/VHKOxqN.png"
