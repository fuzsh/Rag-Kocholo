Can't be too far away. I'm in Europe and would download it but I often change the days of my Wii U clock so I think doing so would screw up my game. Also, how do save states work with the real time clock of the game?\n\nYou could've just made it a general Wild World thread, no need to make it an exact replica of the outdated closed thread.\n\nIn fact, let me do the honors.\n\nThere, this way it will never be closed down for inactivity."
