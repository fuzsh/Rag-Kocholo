I have an original wii and I can get online, but I have a friend who has a Wii U and we can't figure out if there is a way to get his console connected so we can visit each other. I've tried searching the net, but most results that I find that come up are for the original Wii, and usually note that it doesn't work on Wii U (obviously). If anyone knows a way to do it, is there somewhere with detailed instructions?\n\nThanks for any replies.\n\nDaisy\n\n- advertisement -\n\nCap\n\nLoser\n\nmoderator\n\n14844\n\nTabletop Games\n\ntotal posts: 32879\n\nneopoints: 324\n\nsince: Nov 2004\n\nOct 17, 19 at 11:02am ^\n\nre: Wii U?"
