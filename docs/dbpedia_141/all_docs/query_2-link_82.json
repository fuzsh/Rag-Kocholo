        "text": "Hey guys.\n\nNever knew much about Animal Crossing until fairly recently. It looks kinda cool and I'm interested in checking it out, but it seems to be 3DS only right now which I don't have (never really been a fan of handhelds, tbh.)\n\nAfter some cursory research it seems they eventually released City Folk on the Wii. What do people think the chances are of a New Leaf Wii U release? Anyone know of any rumors suggesting that it's on the cards? Is the City Folk Wii release a lot different than the handheld version and can people communicate across those games?\n\nA Wii U release is probably the only way that I'll get to play it, hehe.\n\n-------------------\n\n- Tiffany\n\nquote Shortman\n\nCity Folk was actually a completely new game to its predecessor Wild World on tge DS. It still had the same features, including visiting friends over wi-fi, and introduced new aspects to the series. New Leaf is the next new game on the handheld so perhaps the next Animal Crossing will be for the WiiU but it won't be out for 3 maybe 4 years. Sorry\n\nI found ACWW and ACCF to be awfully similar... ACCF was like ACWW on steroids.\n\n-------------------\n\nDynamite\n\nSlightly? No no no, lol that's a very big understatement. Look :o\n\nPersonally, I prefer the handheld version. I really disliked the Wii version mostly because it just seemed like a refurbished Wild World (on DS) and I hated having to use the Wii and nunchuk together. The game is also one that I've put in 130 hours in the past 19 days, so as you can see, it is very addicting. Unfortunately, you can't do that with a console that has to sit at home, hooked up to a TV at all times to be able to be played, lest you get labeled a weirdo for being inside 130+ hours playing a game lol\n\nNot to mention that rush of excitement when you streetpass someone on your 3DS and you can see their houses and everything. Online gameplay is amazing as well.\n\nI highly recommend investing in a 3ds and New Leaf :3 I mean, Animal Crossing New Life Leaf\n\nMayor\n\nMeily\n\nquote xseed\n\n^Heyyyy. That was super mean. I stay glued to my compuer and other consoles the ENTIRE day and hardly ever go outside. :(\n\nDid I call you a weirdo? Nope. People will label you as they please, and the term I've seen thrown around for those who do nothing productive and sit around playing games inside for that long, get labeled weirdos or pedophiles. But yet it's perfectly fine to do the exact same thing as long as you're outside. Society is weird man. I don't care, I'm a weird person. Today and yesterday were my first days actually out of the house since June 9th XD\n\nMayor\n\nMeily\n\nPikachu dont feel bad. I havent been outside yet since summer break just started. And I want to comment on something about people calling gamers who sit playing games all day pedophiles but I kinda understand why.\n\nAnyway uh...what was I gonna say? umm....Oh. Even though I enjoyed the animal crossign games on the consloles I find them much more enjoyable on my hanheld. Especially since I can go to the bathroom playing animal crossing now\n\nThere will be a WiiU version eventually, but not for like 3 years I reckon. No doubt it'll support off-TV play, which'll help having to invest so much time into it, but the series strikez me as one that could only really feel at home on a handheld console...Plus its the 3DS game I can think of where you should definitely have it downloaded onto the system rather than havr a cartridge at all costs. It just feels so right having that convienence - its my first Animal Crossing, but I honestly can't fathom playing it any other way.\n\n-------------------\n\nY/Î±S: 5026-4578-5146"
