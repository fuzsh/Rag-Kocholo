        "text": "Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival\n\nDeveloper: NDCube\n\nPublisher Nintendo\n\nSystem: Wii U\n\nESRB Rating: E\n\nA review copy was not provided by Nintendo.\n\nBefore I start this review off I would like to start with a little back story. When I was about eight years old my parents bought me a Nintendo GameCube. I loved that thing to death. It was my first video game console. In about fourth grade I made a really cool friend who also had a GameCube and loved it too. He let me borrow two games from him. Mario Party 4 and Animal Crossing. Mario Party 4 was so much fun when I had friends over, the mini games were all creative and the cut throat competitiveness of stealing stars from each other brought out all of our dark sides. On the other side there was Animal Crossing, a whimsical game that allowed me to live a life I never thought I would.\n\nI played Animal Crossing religiously for almost two years straight. At the time I was going through a lot of stuff with my family, so this game was seen an escape from reality. It allowed me to live a second life. From there I grew to love the series as a staple in my gaming career. My parents bought me a DS with Animal Crossing Wild World and I played that game everywhere I went. When City Folk came out I thought the game was a bit stale but the series charm was still there, and when New Leaf hit I thought it was finally a game to almost top the awesomeness that was the GameCube version. I grew up with Animal Crossing, the series made me appreciate slower paced games as a way to unwind and relax. So why am I telling you all this first? I just want you to know where I am coming from as I write this review. The Animal Crossing series has been a part of my life since I started gaming as a child. So, with that out of the way let’s get into the actual review.\n\nRead the rest of this entry →\n\nWith the recent announcement of the PS4 price dropping from $399.99 to $349.99, and a plethora of new Xbox One bundles coming out this holiday season, this puts the Wii U in a really bad situation. Even though the Wii U’s sales have been extremely lackluster over the years, the console normally manages to pull in some decent numbers during the holiday season. However, seeing as this time around the Wii U will only be fifty dollars cheaper than its competitors (and this isn’t even accounting for pre-owned), the question needs to be asked, “What can be done for the Wii U to shine this holiday season?” Granted while The Legend of Zelda and Star Fox both got delayed into 2016, the Wii U is missing some upcoming big hits. But this doesn’t mean nothing can do be done about it.\n\nRead the rest of this entry →"
