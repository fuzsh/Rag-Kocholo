My wife is the mayor of the Town...called 'Sittard', me and my daughter are also residents.\n\nWhenever I open the gates however...no one ever visits. Also, whenever I want to visit Faraway Towns, I always get an empty screen. No towns to visit....\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nHi!\n\nCan you guys help me out.

No strangers can visit your town. Also, you can only visit your friend's towns as well, so if you get a blank screen then it means that none of your friends have their gate open.\n\nHi!\n\nCan you guys help me out. This week I decided to give AC another chance. My wife is the mayor of the Town...called 'Sittard', me and my daughter are also residents.\n\nWhenever I open the gates however...no one ever visits. Also, whenever I want to visit Faraway Towns, I always get an empty screen. No towns to visit....\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nJust people on your friends list . If you do visit or are visited don't forget to best friend them it lets you chat even when your gate is closed. You can also friend request visitors that are in your friends town while your out.\n\nAnyone need Katie to come visit? Currently in my town right now. She gives you exclusive items if you take her to another town.\n\nThere still hasn't been a day where I didn't play this, which is good, because by now in WW and CF I was done playing.\n\nThree weeks into the game and I find this little thing this morning.\n\nGoing to get the Modern Town Hall.\n\nDecided to make my own path today because all the ones out on the internet don't have the pieces I wanted. It also let's me have all the custom pieces I need.\n\nOh i like those patterns. Care to share?\n\nHere you go.\n\nThese are the basic pieces.\n\nHere are the extra parts if you want the path to continue having it's border around houses.\n\nThere are more pieces, but those are custom to my town don't really think you will need them.\n\nEdited by Lord Pickleton, 22 July 2013 - 10:25 AM.\n\nSomeone reminded my I never put the rest of the Path set I made before I sold my copy of New Leaf. Remade them all on my brother's game."
