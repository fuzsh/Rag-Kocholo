        "text": "There is no local play. The only way to do this over LAN or Wifi is to hack your Wii. It's relatively simple and the only way to get continued support for this discontinued product.\n\n1. Hack your Wii with LetterBomb\n\nhttps://please.hackmii.com/\n\nInstructions\n\nOn Computer: If there is a folder titled \"private\" on your SD card, rename it to \"privateold\"\n\nOn Computer: Copy the \"private\" directory from the LetterBomb download to the root of your SD card.\n\nOn Computer: Take your homebrew (preferably Hackmii Installer) and put it in the ROOT of your SD card as \"boot.elf\". Note that you can download the Hackmii Installer directly from the download link provided above. You will be asked for U (American), E (Europe), J (Japanese) or K (Korean).\n\nWii: Put your SD card in your Wii and turn it on.\n\nWii: Go into the Wii Message Board and navigate to \"Today\", \"Yesterday\" or \"Two days ago\".\n\nWii: Click on the appropriate envelope, sit back and prepare for the hacking glory.\n\n2. Patch your game with Wiimmfi\n\nhttps://wiiki.wii-homebrew.com/Wiimmfi_(en)/Patcher\n\nYou will need to check that link to get additional links and files. Here's a simplified version of what you'll be doing.\n\nPatching disk images\n\nYou will need:\n\nA (soft)modded Nintendo Wii\n\nThe Homebrew Channel and\n\nA Custom IOS (cIOS) to change the way your Wii accesses data\n\nUSB Loader GX (or a different USB loader)\n\nA USB storage device (eg. HDD, USB stick) formatted for use with USB Loader GX\n\nWii Backup Manager or a different WBFS Manager.\n\nFollow the directions and you'll be good to go. Make sure you follow all the steps. If you mess up the part with custom IOS you're going to brick your Wii. As long as you're paying attention and following the steps you'll be fine. It's literally one of the easiest consoles to hack.\n\nYou can still play Animal Crossing city Folk or lets go to the City using the new WIIMMFI servers. They are private and created to replace the Nintendo WFC servers that closed down. All you need is a patched copy of ACCF or download the patcher for ACCF from WIIMMFI. You can google to find out all you need."
