        "text": "So, you've just received your first Nintendo Switch, what now? Since launching in 2017, numerous games have been released on the console, which makes deciding what to play first a hard decision. You won't have to decide alone though; we are here to help!\n\nIn this list, we are going to take a look at some of the best Nintendo Switch games to play first. These are all solid choices as a first game, with many titles being first-party Nintendo games. Many of these games are some of the most popular on the platform, and that's for a good reason.\n\n10 The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild\n\nYou've probably heard of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This is an absolute essential for the Nintendo Switch, launching the same day as the console itself. This open-world Zelda game is breathtaking, and the best part? You don't need to have any prior knowledge of the franchise.\n\nThis game is a good place to start if you are new to The Legend of Zelda or the Nintendo Switch. If you end up loving it as much as we do, be sure to check out Tears of the Kingdom, which is a direct sequel.\n\n9 Hades\n\nNext, we have Hades. Overall, any game from Supergiant Games is a hit, but Hades really put these developers on the map. The game follows Zagreus as he attempts to leave the Underworld. As a roguelite game, you can expect to die, and then die again.\n\nBoth the art and story of Hades are phenomenal. In addition to that, the gameplay is engaging and leaves you wanting more. Rather than dying and feeling discouraged, you'll want to keep going and see what you can do differently.\n\n8 Super Mario Odyssey\n\nIf you were to only get two games on the Nintendo Switch, it should be Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey. These two games deliver the full package in two totally different styles. Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D Mario game in which you control Mario, as well as his cute little hat named Cappy.\n\nPlatform games aren't for everyone, but Super Mario Odyssey switches things up. There are many gameplay mechanics used in the game, so you are bound to have a good time! Gameplay is even more varied, as you will be able to travel to new kingdoms, such as the Metro Kingdom, where you can find New Donk City.\n\n7 Pikmin\n\nCurrently, there are four Pikmin games that you can experience on the Nintendo Switch. These games fit right in on the console, delivering you an enjoyable yet challenging experience as you control a group of Pikmin.\n\nNothing gets much better than controlling a group of little guys. If you are brand new to the franchise, you can start right at Pikmin 4! Of course, if you end up loving the game, we recommend going back and playing the other three.\n\n6 Pokemon Sword & Shield\n\nNintendo and Pokemon go hand in hand, so it only makes sense that Pokemon Sword and Shield earned a spot on our list. These are the first two mainline Pokemon games that launched on Nintendo Switch, bringing us to the Galar region, which was inspired by the United Kingdom.\n\nThis is a classic Pokemon experience with some great new additions, such as wild areas. If you are a fan of Pokemon, we also suggest checking out the following games.\n\nPokemon Legends: Arceus\n\nPokemon: Let's Go, Eevee!/Pikachu!\n\nPokemon Scarlet And Violet\n\nPokemon Brilliant Diamond And Shining Pearl\n\n5 Animal Crossing: New Horizons\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is essential if you like cozy games. This long-running franchise features several games that let you just sit back, relax, and decorate your house. New Horizons is no exception, as you will get to build an entire island!\n\nOverall, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is ideal if you are looking to take a break from a hectic life. There are no stressful situations; all you need to do is plan your island, go swimming, and talk with your villagers.\n\n4 Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\n\nMany of us have fond memories of playing Super Smash Bros. growing up, which makes Super Smash Bros. Ultimate a great game to get first on the Nintendo Switch. As its title implies, this 'ultimate' game features... well, everyone!\n\nIf you like to play video games with groups of friends, this is a great option. There are enough characters in the game to deliver a unique experience in each match. In total, there are a whopping 89 characters to choose from.\n\n3 Disco Elysium\n\nDisco Elysium is a combat-free mystery game where you play as a detective who lost his memories. Ultimately, you're goal is to solve a murder, but the game is so much more than that. Along the way, you will learn about the culture and politics of the city, as well as get to know the residents who live there.\n\nDisco Elysium has one of the best stories I've encountered in a video game . I highly recommend everyone give it a try, regardless if you like combat-free, story-heavy games or not.\n\nThis game has an absolutely phenomenal story, with many different route options, giving it some great replayability. Overall, the story of DiscoE Elysium will stick with you for a while, until you are ready to replay it.\n\n2 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\n\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe is another essential Nintendo game that has been around since we were kids. Now, you can play it right from your Nintendo Switch! Like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, this is a great game to play with others.\n\nThis is the 'Deluxe' version of Mario Kart, which was originally launched on the Wii U. Interestingly, Mario Kart Deluxe is one of the best-selling games not only on the Nintendo Switch, but of all time!\n\n1 Stardew Valley\n\nLast but not least, we have Stardew Valley. This is one of the most popular farming sims out there, bringing you right to Pelican Town. Here, you will need to build up your farm, explore, complete quests, and get to know the villagers.\n\nStarday Vally is packed with content, with several updates already being added to the game for free. It's possible to get lost in Stardew Valley for hours at a time, especially if you have a goal in mind, such as getting married or exploring a dangerous cavern."
