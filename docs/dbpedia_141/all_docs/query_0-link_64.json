        "text": "1\n\nWesEds\n\nOnly the two Zelda games I’d want and maybe Pikmin. The others can stay there\n\n2\n\nXansies\n\nEh, some of these, like Color Splash, I'm totally fine just getting a sequel. I'd rather Xenoblade x 2 than the original. That game had some stuff it could do better.\n\n3\n\nAshenLion\n\nI'd be happy with just the two Zeldas.\n\n4\n\nBattista\n\nIt was nice to see a bit of love for the NES Remix series again. I definitely miss those after trading in my Wii U.\n\n5\n\nmesome713\n\n3D World would be a smart port. Also would love that Nintendo Land game.\n\n6\n\nredd214\n\n3D World and Zelda only other ones I want at this point. Really glad most of the big Wii U games came to Switch!\n\n7\n\ndAvecaster\n\nwoah 3.62/10 chance of Colour Splash coming to Switch. That's pretty precise.\n\n8\n\nGrailUK\n\nStanding ovation at the Devil's Third pun!\n\n9\n\nLawnachaun\n\nSince it's already well assumed that the Mario, Zelda, Pikmin, and Xenoblade games are coming, I would want the NES Remix Pack, and ZombiU to come to the Switch. I played a lot of those on the Wii U. I don't see the other games on this list making the jump to the Switch. But I would love to see NES Remix Pack and ZombiU make it over. Those would be great to have on the Switch.\n\n10\n\nDriftDT\n\nWind Waker and Twilight Princess HD on the Switch would make me the happiest dude ever.\n\n11\n\nBlackenedHalo\n\nXenoblade Chronicles X Def Edition must come!! ((((((((((((( ..Otherwise I ..I ..I will cry!!\n\n12\n\nDualmask\n\nThe only game on the list that interests me is XCX, and I'm not exactly the biggest fan of the Xenoblade battle system. But I'd be willing to give it another try if it were ported. The rest...meh.\n\n13\n\nnessisonett\n\nHow about nothing at all coming to Switch. Instead having new entries in each series. Remember when that was a thing?\n\n14\n\nGrailUK\n\n@Hikingguy totally agree!\n\n15\n\nGrailUK\n\n@nessisonett It's bad enough writing off the Wii U, but writing off it's software library along with it is moronic!\n\n16\n\nZenszulu\n\nI can see Xenoblade Chronicles X coming to the Switch as it will probably require a smaller team to port it than a full remaster like the first game so working on the new Zelda game shouldn't be a huge reason why it doesn't get ported like the article states. Personally though I am shocked the 3D World hasn't made it to Switch yet as at this point it is practically a licence to print money as it will surely sell as if it was a new game since so few would have played it despite being the second biggest selling Wii U game. I can also see games like Deus Ex coming now things like Borderlands are coming as well as the Batman Arkham games and the Mass Effect trilogy.\n\n17\n\nnessisonett\n\n@GrailUK I own a Wii U, I played the games. I also own a Wii and there’s far more great games on it that aren’t being ported despite the joy-cons having motion support.\n\n18\n\nCorvoRevo\n\nJust give me X, the Zelda HD collection and Project Zero.\n\nThank you Nintendo.\n\n19\n\nVriess\n\nI'll take the two Zelda's and Mario 3D World please.\n\n20\n\nParaka\n\n@nessisonett - Not like this hampers development much. This may actually be used to fund new games.\n\nBesides, how many Switch owners are there in comparison? Wii U was abysmal in sales and games suffered for it. Pikmin 3 is new for 4 times the community than it is old.\n\n21\n\nMotionMan\n\nTheres really only a bit left to pick from the Wii U but\n\nSuper Mario 3D World\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD\n\nPikmin 3\n\nXenoblade Chronicles X\n\nThese are the only games that have a real chance of coming to Switch. Star Fox Zero and NES Remix 1&2 would be awesome but least likely tbh.\n\n22\n\nZenszulu\n\n@nessisonett sorry got to disagree one of the problems historically with the video games industry is some games were stuck on a singular console and no way to play it years down the line on newer systems the same can't be said for other forms of media. So making older games available on newer systems and everyone after that is a good thing. Also just because you played it doesn't mean everyone has seeing as the it was Nintendo's worst selling console based on your statement as long as you have played it doesn't really matter if others get to experience it.\n\n23\n\nmesome713\n\nI want Xenoblade X also, that game would make an amazing port.\n\n24\n\nPak-Man\n\nHonestly, it was the second screen that made the Zelda remasters so great on Switch. Having a map always available is a game changer. No matter how pretty they make them, the Wii U will always be the best ports of those two.\n\n25\n\nJimmySpades\n\nThe Wii library deserves to come to Switch far more than the Wii U library. Nintendo's first party games were better, and the third-party games were light years better. I'd love to see what they'd look like with updated production values.\n\n26\n\nwazlon\n\n3D World seems like it's going to happen and just a matter of when. I got fed up of hoping for the two Zeldas for Switch so have played Wind Waker recently and have purchased Twilight Princess.\n\nThere's quite a few games on this list I'd like to see get a second chance, even Sonic Lost World as it was a fun game and the graphics were nice and colourful.\n\n27\n\nmrMike\n\nFrom this list, I'd buy the 2 HD Zelda games. I bought The Wind Waker HD, but moved on by the time Twilight Princess HD came to WiiU. I already beat it, 100% completion, on the Wii.\n\nAlthough, I would be much more interested in the 3DS remakes of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. Even with the potential of N64 coming to NSO, the originals have not aged well, imo.\n\n28\n\nwazlon\n\n@Pak-Man I was reluctant to play Wind Waker HD again because I wanted a Switch version. Played it on Wii U again though and that map in the gamepad was just incredible for finding the treasure. You're right, the Wii U versions just can't be beaten.\n\n29\n\nJSDude1\n\nI’d love to see most of these games ported to Switch, but I’d also add in Call of Duty.\n\n30\n\nJSDude1\n\n@wazlon yeah that’s true about a map, but they could easily include a mini-map in the right hand corner (even if it were opaque) to rectify this problem if ported to the Switch.\n\n31\n\nDragonslacker1\n\nOk so the 2 Zeldas, sm3d world, star fox zero, but looking at this list of games I would also like watch dogs. I had a lot of fun with this game, and it was very simple and streamlined to play. I think the story was ok, but the buildings you infiltrated were real fun to me, and LOVED all those mini games. Just remembered it has chess as well. God damn I’m off to find my copy on PS4 x x\n\n32\n\nMoroboshi876\n\nNES Remix is a hidden gem, maybe because many people didn't understand what exactly it was. Like the console itself. It was a communication problem. I still have to hear that it's a collection of NES games. Facepalm.\n\nIt should be ported to Switch, but I hope they don't add content, because I don't want to double dip.\n\n33\n\nMrMetroid\n\nI don't care about most of those apart from the two zeldas especially wind waker, super mario world and pikmin 3.\n\n34\n\nEmmatheBest\n\nYeah...how about no? Let the Wii U have SOME of it's exclusives left, like come on... I'd rather the Switch keep getting new games instead, like Paper Mario and the Origami King. You don't know how happy I am that it's a new game and not Color Splash 4K Triple Deluxe Version.\n\n35\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nI just want XCX so that the entire xenoblade series is on one system. Other than that I’m fine playing everything else on my wiiu (I still wish that Nintendo had figured out some way to make the game pad work with the switch as a super pro controller as inventory menus and maps are at home there).\n\n36\n\ndewokkel\n\n@Lawnachaun wouldn’t mind a good zombie survival game on switch, as these are lacking right now. If MS would bring over State of Decay 2 to the switch, that would be mindblowing.\n\n37\n\nChibi\n\nPersonally I don’t want any more ports but I understand if, say Sm3dw and Pikmin 3 were ported, as I feel these are the more deserving. For those clamouring for a Zelda port. Are you mad? That would actually be a port of a port and imo would be being too greedy and going too far. Personally i would rather they made NEW games although I understand the use of ports to fill gaps in the release schedule.\n\nAlso, no mention of Nintendoland? Some games that were mentioned would require a significant reworking, so I’m surprised it wasn’t mentioned.\n\n38\n\nXyphon22\n\nI already own all the ones I would want on Wii U and pretty much never double dip on things. That said, Human Revolution was my favorite game on the Wii U and would absolutely love some kind of Deus Ex Collection as mentioned in the article as it is the only game in the series I have played.\n\n39\n\nGrandScribe\n\nThe only games I wanna have come to the Switch are the HD Zelda games and Pikmin, porting the rest just don’t interest me.\n\n40\n\nMrBlacky\n\nI would like to know the calculations behind the 4.9 score and the 3.62 score.\n\nIn my opinion even the 0.5 point steps are to much, but please explain how you got those numbers above.\n\nAnd for the games: I only would like Super Mario 3D World and Devil's Third.\n\n41\n\nTaffy\n\nMass effect 3 was on the Wii U so would easily go the the trilogy on Switch if it ever came out... and I had a Switch. For now I’ll just plod along with 3 and miss out on key decisions from the first two games\n\n42\n\nBANJO\n\nBoth Zelda's (Twilight and Wind Waker) and Super Mario 3D World would likely generate the best sales...\n\nPikmin 3 would also be great to release on the Switch, especially as we haven't heard a peep regarding Pikmin 4...\n\nI must be the only person who enjoyed Devils Third, I got on day of release and played it through twice and even played on the online mode.... Perhaps being a Wii U owner I was just desperate for any game at that point😂\n\n43\n\nMoonKnight7\n\nI’d be ok with 3D World, Pikmin 3, and Xenoblade X. Fatal Frame could probably be ported well also. They can keep Starfox Zero, I’m sorry, it just wasn’t good. Also, why, again WHY, is amiibo festival even being considered? Burn it with fire.\n\n44\n\nGiygas_95\n\nI want Splinter Cell Blacklist.\n\n45\n\ndux\n\nI loved Watch Dogs 2 so much on PC that I'd actually be tempted to double dip, against my good senses. A Twilight Princess might also tempt me, but a Wind Waker (which I just never played) would be a day one buy for me\n\n46\n\nWreckitRyan\n\nXenoblade X would just be...yes. All the yes.\n\n47\n\nTyranexx\n\nTop of my personal list - though I've played them all - would be Xenoblade Chronicles X, The Wind Waker HD, and Twilight Princess HD.\n\n48\n\nHammerKirby\n\n@mesome713 there's no way in hell Nintendo Land is getting a port. It relies too heavily on the gamepad\n\n49\n\nMuddy_4_Ever\n\nThey could tweak the Star Fox Zero controls to play in a more traditional way (maybe a windowed second screen or HUD enhancement to accommodate some idiosyncrasies of the game). BUUUUUUUUUUUUT... if they did that, it would pretty much just be yet another graphical upgrade of Star Fox 64 (and I don't know if that's needed).\n\n50\n\nMuddy_4_Ever\n\nRainbow Curse would be a good candidate, too. Include a cute, Kirby themed stylus in the package and make it crystal clear this is a handheld-only game (no docked, wouldn't work) and I think it would be worth revisiting.\n\n51\n\nmesome713\n\n@HammerKirby That’s true, I just want that Luigi and Metroid game. So fun.\n\n52\n\nHammerKirby\n\n@Paraka Where are the sequels to Mario Kart 8,DKC Tropical Freeze and Captain Toad Treasure Tracker then?\n\n53\n\nBk86\n\nJust here to throw my hat in the Xenoblade Chronicles X pile. I almost bought it for my Wii U but never did and now I've sold the console. But after playing Xenoblade 2 and loving it I want the whole series.\n\n54\n\nHammerKirby\n\n@mesome713 I agree it's a lot of fun, but those games would be a lot less fun if they were forced to be single screen. Only way I could see it working is if they make you use 2 Switches which would be very odd.\n\n55\n\nLUIGITORNADO\n\nIt’d be nice to get 3D world and a reworked Zero\n\nthat drops the awful controls.\n\n56\n\nRichwalker13\n\nIMO Sonic and SEGA All Stars Transformed IS better than Mario Kart 8. I certainly enjoted it more.\n\n57\n\nrdm22\n\n3D world + yoshi please. I have my Zeldas on GCube and Wii. I would throw some love to Star Fox, but I heard that game was something of a mess (although scanning above it seems that the biggest complaint was with the controls, not the substance).\n\nMy biggest Wii U request would be to make all of the games available on Virtual Console available on Switch, but I know that's never happening because why would Nintendo want to make easy money?\n\n58\n\nGrizzledVeteran\n\nShame about the \"Remix\" series dying a quiet death. For a while there, the gaming community had a lot of fun speculating about which platform would get the \"Remix treatment\" next: SNES, Gameboy, etc.. (and also which games to include....)\n\nI really enjoyed both Remixes (and the 3DS one too).\n\n59\n\nmikegamer\n\nJust Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Couldn't care less about Mario 3D World.\n\n60\n\nWoottWinds\n\n@mesome713 Came here to mention Nintendo Land, woo! A game I had less than any interest in until playing it, turned out to be one of my top 3 favorites for the entire console.\n\n61\n\nMadder128\n\nNintendo Life didn't play Devils Third for more than 30 minutes.\n\nJumped on the band wagon like all the other critics.\n\nOther than that, good article.\n\n62\n\nWoomyNNYes\n\nMy wallet is ready for Mario World 3D and Wind Waker HD.\n\n\"My body, My body is ready!\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2Gc5cuekQto?t=9\n\n63\n\nParaka\n\n@HammerKirby - Hyperbolic, so that's noted.\n\nBut real talk: May want to ask those teams directly. You know, the ones in charge of Animal Crossing, BotW2, and Metroid Prime 4.\n\nDunning, just spitballing here.\n\n64\n\nGrumblevolcano\n\nThe article should've had Nintendo Land and Kirby and the Rainbow Curse on it.\n\nBut yeah I really hope we get more Wii U ports soon, most wanted is XCX.\n\n65\n\nBengals76\n\nWhat about Wii Sports U?\n\n66\n\nmrMike\n\n@RPGamer Agreed... But I don't think that's what he's saying at all. To be fair, it's hard for anyone to get excited about games that you already own.\n\nI understand both sides... So let's be frank, Nintendo is a business 💯\n\nThese games are not ported simply out of the goodness in Nintendo's heart, to make sure that everyone gets a chance to experience them. I admit that that may be part of the reason, but the ultimate goal is to make money. To make as much money as possible, using as little resources as possible... Period.\n\nAs someone who also owned a WiiU, it's hard not to feel like I'm expected to \"pick up the slack\" for a failed console. I get that, completely, it makes sense.\n\n67\n\nLEGOSuperDKong\n\nI think these games getting a broader audience would be a good thing (porting issues aside). But as a Wii U owner, the Switch looks ever less appealing the more it relies on updated Wii U ports to fill its library.\n\n68\n\nParaka\n\n@the4seer - Well, on top of that, someone made a good point why ports are becoming more and more common place.\n\nMaking new games take time, and more of it each passing generation. That eats up money and consumer awareness, no one wants to buy a system and feel \"ignored\" all the time. Nintendo fans know this pretty well.\n\nSo in making ports, they serve multiple, business-oriented purposes.\n\n1) Keep the public eye on them, constantly announcing \"new to you\" ports and new games alike they can keep people talking about them (even if it's complaints of Wii U owners).\n\n2) Creates fillers to the gap of releases, keeping something relatively new and available to play on the go, some may not be you, but there is always enough people who aren't you to be worth it.\n\n3) Fund new projects further, there is a reason Metroid Prime 4 can be affordable to delay and develop it to completion. And a reason Nintendo can release bunk sometimes (Sushi Striker, Flip Wars) and continue to do so.\n\nIt's all good business strategy period to do this. And is a clear reason many third parties abuse the ever-loving crap out of it.\n\nAnd honestly, if more people got to play Endless Ocean or NES Remix through a port, the more likely I get a sequel.\n\n69\n\nBulbatron\n\nThe games I would want on Switch would be anything from the Zelda or Fatal Frame series.\n\n70\n\n1UP_MARIO\n\nJust give us pikmin 4\n\n71\n\ninvictus4000\n\nIf we get 3D World, Xenoblade, and Twilight Princess, my Wii U is officially void aside from the amazing Nintendoland and Skyward Sword. Haha. Bring them all on!\n\n72\n\nMorph\n\nI agree with the main ones, Mario 3D World and Pikmin 3 I think are near certainties.\n\nI also think the two Zelda remasters are probably up there as well but perhaps not for a few years yet, more towards the end of the Switches lifespan. I think Skyward Sword will be the next Zelds game to come along.\n\nI think there is a higher possibility of Xenoblade X coming than you guys do, particularly on the back of both Xenoblade 1 and 2 being on Switch now, it only makes sense if there is a market for the series.\n\nI also think Fatal Frame will make a left field appearance.\n\n73\n\nTheUnrestCure\n\nIn terms of ludicrous impossibility: Black Ops 2. Activision would never do it, but it sure would be fun to play an upgraded version of its multiplayer (even with microtransactions galore) with a significant playerbase. With no other CoDs coming to Switch, I imagine it would sell pretty well, particularly if it was not also released on other consoles. As such, it also would not complete with a new CoD ...\n\n74\n\nMrGawain\n\nI think Wii Potential ports is a far more interesting question. SMG 1+2, Skyward Sword, The Metroid Prime Triology, Pikmin 1+2 collection, Super Paper Mario, Madworld, Pandora’s Tower, Zac and Wiki, Brain Academy- just to name a few.\n\n75\n\nThundertron55\n\nTwilight Princess, Wind Waker, 3D World, and Xenoblade Chronicles X for me please.\n\n76\n\nDezzy\n\nThere's a typo in the Xenoblade X entry. \"being\" should be \"bring\"\n\n77\n\nRaunchyHylian\n\nNeed the two zeldas and 3D world, would love to play through again and on the go!\n\n78\n\nzool\n\nMost of the games listed are just the one that haven't been ported.Obvious I suppose, buy what I mean is they have been left at the back of the queue. Assuming that all the Wii u games will not get a port and a couple may well be in production, the rest will have to wait a long time.\n\nBut my choice is Sonic and all stars racing.\n\n79\n\nCotillion\n\nThere's not much I'd even really want, only 3 of them actually.\n\nMario 3D World, I enjoyed this far more than Odyssey and would love a portable version.\n\nXenoblade Chronicles X, I'd love to have this to round out the set with the other two.\n\nNES Remix, great for short burst challenges when out and about with the Switch.\n\n80\n\nDenDen\n\nXenoblade x yes please by FAR my favorite titel\n\n81\n\nMando44646\n\nI want Xenoblade and the two Zeldas. I'd also take Star Fox without the crap controls\n\n82\n\ngortsi\n\nSince you've got third party Wii U games on the list, you're missing some gems (some were previously mentioned): Need for Speed Most Wanted (best version of the game), Splinter Cell Blacklist, the Arkham Games including porting Asylum, Mass Effect 3 (first two would be nice as well). Don't know what Activision would do with the two Call of Duties considering they haven't remastered BOPS 2 but I find it amazing the Wii U got 2 of them while the Switch is even missing the remasters of CODs that were on the Wii! Injustice is probably a no unless they bundle it with the second I guess and Tekken Tag Tournament has been dead for years. Can't think of anything else missing\n\n83\n\nMando44646\n\nME3 was on Wii U. The Mass Effect Trilogy is my #1 demand/need on switch. I want that so much\n\n84\n\nJayofmaya\n\nOther than Yoshi, Amiibo Festival, Pikmin 3 and Devils Third I have/had all of these. I ditched Watch Dogs wii U version in favour of the ps4 one.\n\n85\n\nMax_the_German\n\nMy guess for upcoming ports:\n\nSM3DW and Pikmin 3: obvious, almost confirmed\n\nXCX and Yoshi: easy money for Big N in 2021 or 2022\n\nFor the other games: almost no chances, esp. for those Zeldas\n\n86\n\ngortsi\n\nJust remembered some others as well but they're pretty much dead across all platforms: Epic Mickey, Skylanders, Disney Infinity, and Ninja Gaiden. Warriors Orochi 3 got a sequel on the Switch so that's very unlikely\n\n87\n\nYosher\n\nI'd definitely triple-dip into Yoshi's Woolly World. Though I doubt they'd add much, if anything at all, to it. It was certainly superior to Crafted World though.\n\n88\n\nSakuraHaruka\n\nMario 3D World is the one that interests me the most on the list (although All in the list are very good proposals), and I hope that the rumors that have emerged are true, but of course, they are rumors, XD.\n\nHowever, if it should happen, I expect improvements as it was with New Super Mario Wii U-Deluxe, where new characters are included (like Toadette-Peachette, in fact, it would be good to include it); as well as others who are already waiting to enter these games: Daisy (she already debuted in Super Mario Run), Wario (he already debuted in Super Mario 64 x 4) among others (yes Waluigi, why not?)\n\nAlso improvements in the difficulty of the game and more scenarios-levels, or rather, a new adventure, too, why not?\n\nWell, but they are just ideas, let's see what will happen, while just waiting and continuing to wish. ^.^\n\n89\n\nLukathon\n\nApologies if I've missed someone mentioning this in the comments. In terms of NES Remix, I think there's a big opportunity being missed here for the same game to be released à la Tetris 99 for the online subscribers, seems like a great addition to me, perhaps with a SNES Remix down the line to match the current lineup.\n\n90\n\nshani\n\nA few reasonable and a lot of ridiculous suggestions.\n\nSuper Mario 3D World - lol no thanks\n\nPikmin 3 - yes\n\nXenoblade Chronicles X - YES!\n\nStar Fox Zero - only if the Switch finally gets dual screen support\n\nNES Remix Pack - lol no thanks\n\nPaper Mario: Color Splash - sure why not\n\nYoshi's Woolly World - sure why not\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD - absolutely NOT!\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD - absolutely NOT!\n\nAnimal Crossing: Amiibo Festival - lol no\n\nZombiU - only if the Switch finally gets dual screen support\n\nProject Zero: Maiden of Black Water - lol what?!\n\nSonic Lost World - sure why not\n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution - yet another port? ok fine, but only with gyro aim\n\nWatch Dogs - I'd rather get a port of the upcoming WD, or at least WD2\n\nSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed - no?\n\nDevil's Third - lol you must be joking\n\n91\n\nplaystation_king\n\n@shani Zombi U is on the ps4 and plays ok single screen\n\n92\n\nplaystation_king\n\nMuch rather them do hd remasters of some wii games instead, these wii u games are still fresh in my mind\n\n93\n\nlocky-mavo\n\nXenoblade X and Fatal Frame are the only games I want to to see ported from WiiU, anything else would be a happy extra.\n\n@shani\n\nGeez you got some bad taste there bud. And what’s with “Deus Ex: yet another port?” Every single game on the list is “yet another port”.\n\n94\n\nPod\n\nYes Please on Sonic Worlds.\n\n95\n\nBengals76\n\n@shani\n\nWhat about Wii Sports U? All of our bodies are ready!\n\n96\n\nISoleilI\n\nPeople still don´t get it. Porting the full library of the console is wrong. There is no need for wii u ports, we need new games.\n\nIf you either missed or simply want to play wii u games, then buy a wii u. They are fairly cheap tbh.\n\n97\n\nStephenYap3\n\nI would love to see Super Mario 3D World come to Switch. Odyssey is amazing and all, but I miss the platforming and challenge and \"Mario\" gameplay that 3D World had for me.\n\nI would also like to see Yoshi's Woolly World come to Switch to get back the two-player mode while retaining portability, as well as being utterly disappointed by the recent Yoshi's Crafted World for straying too far away from what made Woolly World and Yoshi's Island SNES amazing for me in many areas including gameplay, challenge, and replay value. And Gavin Lane, I'd also like to see Kirby's Epic Yarn come to Switch as well, if only to get both the 3DS and Wii content into one bundle.\n\nPikmin 3...er, I dunno. I'd rather see a sequel with unlimited days than being limited again\n\nAs much as I'd love to see NES Remix 1 and 2 return, it'd be pretty difficult to bring to Switch since the online service is giving the represented games away to subscribers for free...which saddens me because some of its \"Bonus\" challenges were fun...\n\n98\n\nLawnachaun\n\n@dewokkel I have \"Zombie Army Trilogy\" for the Switch. So there's that. I have fun with that game. Basically just \"Sniper Elite with zombies\", if you've never played it. But yeah, I loved ZombiU. I played it a lot, and beat it multiple times. It's a shame that it was rushed. It was originally revealed to be alien invasion game, but the aliens were too small and hard to hit, so, they changed it to zombies instead, right before E3 that year and basically started over from scratch. But, they desperately wanted it to be a launch title, so that they could say that they had the \"first must have title\" on the Wii U. But because they changed concepts so late in the process, they didn't have time to do everything that they wanted. Nintendo planned on Pikmin 3 being a launch title but, they knew it wasn't ready, so they pushed it back, and it didn't release until August the next year. But, Ubisoft refused to push back ZombiU to properly finish it, and thus, had to cut things. They cut the multiplayer aspect down, and cut out some weapons, and some levels, and other things, and said that they would put those in the sequel instead of trying to put them in the first game, as planned. But, because they rushed the game, and refused to push it back finish it, because they were so dead set on it being a launch title, the game wasn't all it could of been. Which is a shame, because it was still a good game, that I had lots of fun with. But extra time working on it could of made it so much better. But, because it was incomplete when it released, it didn't sell well, and then the sequel got cancelled because of it. Which is a shame. But it would be nice if they Remastered ZombiU for the Switch (tho, the title would just have to be \"Zombi\" like the other consoles, as the U wouldn't make sense, and you obviously can't use the \"tch\" from the end of \"Switch\", as Zombi ends in \"bi\", and, that would just be bad if they named it that, for obvious reasons). But yeah, a full remaster of the game, with, hopefully, the extra stuff that they didn't have time to complete the first time around, would be great. I'd love to play the game again, on the Switch, if they did that.\n\n99\n\nBanjo-\n\nProject Zero Maiden of Black Water!\n\n100\n\nsixrings\n\nIf this system is supposed to last another 4 years then 3D world, HD zeldas, Pikman, Yoshi, Paper Mario, NES Remix are 100% coming to fill out the library\n\n101\n\nGuitario\n\nWhat about some 3ds ports?\n\n1) Zelda OOT with MM\n\n2) Metroid SR (with a remake Super Metroid)\n\n3) Mario and Luigi (all of them together)\n\n102\n\nGiancarlothomaz\n\ni can see Nintendo release Super Mario 3D along with a Super Mario All- Star 3D to celebrate the 35 aniversary of the Mario franchise, and release Pikimin 3 to see if the Pikimin fans still have a interest on the Pikimin 4, and the 2 HD Zelda remakes could be released next year along side the sequel of Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild to concide with the 35 annivesary of the franchise.\n\n103\n\nPickledKong64\n\n@mesome713 it's the most fun you can have with friends. Even more than smash imo\n\n104\n\nHexagonSun\n\nMy Wii U is still hooked up in my living room, but I would gladly double dip for Mario 3D World, Zelda TP and WW, Pikimn 3, Xenoblade X, and a reworked Star Fox Zero. I'm sure we'll see some of these when you consider how many Wii U games have already been brought over. If not, at least I can still enjoy these at home.\n\n105\n\nMaaryotyme\n\n@StephenYap3 unlimited days sounds so challenging. Might aswell take all the time and enemies out 😉\n\n106\n\ndewokkel\n\n@Lawnachaun haha zombitch indeed 😉. Didn’t know the game was so rushed. Had a lot of fun it though and I also would love a remaster.\n\nZombie sniper elite... neh, played it on pc once, but it didn’t do much for me.\n\n107\n\nMaaryotyme\n\n@HexagonSun save yourself the money and if the Wii u is still hooked up then just enjoy it there 😉\n\n108\n\nDirty0814\n\n@nessisonett plenty of new entries have and are coming. Nintendo has other teams that they hire that work on ports for older games so it doesn't hurt any new progress at all.\n\n109\n\nDirty0814\n\nI still have my WiiU and all these games. I would definitely double dip for them in the switch though.\n\n110\n\nmrMike\n\n@RPGamer @Paraka Well Said, All True...\n\nJust to play the \"Devil's Advocate\" ...\n\nPorts make sense, for all of the reasons that you both mentioned. Although, one could argue that the Switch is becoming more of a \"dumping ground\" for WiiU games.This is not to say that these games are not well made, or undeserving of a larger audience. Although, I'm sure that Nintendo lost money on these games coming to WiiU (HD development cost meets dreadful install base).\n\nIn the end, it's all a matter of perspective, for a gamer. Although, it's hard to ignore the scenario that Nintendo is essentially just trying to \"break even\" with certain WiiU titles. I'm almost certain that if the trend was porting/remaking/remastering/ \"deluxing\" older games from more successful systems, there would be much more excitement (i.e. Link's Awakening and Xenoblade).\n\n111\n\nQuarth\n\nI'd love to have Wind Waker on the Switch, never played that game.\n\nAnd Xenoblade X would be awesome!\n\nThe more games the better.\n\n112\n\nHexagonSun\n\n@La-weejee I hear you. It's just that I work 70 hours a week overnights at a group home. I do most of my gaming in the wee hours of the morning. Needless to say, the majority of my gaming is on Switch.\n\n113\n\nJSDude1\n\n@Moroboshi876 no not added content, but a potential “SNES” remix would be cool.\n\n114\n\nTrajan\n\nXCX needs to come to Switch.\n\nMonolithsoft Kyoto is who is helping BOTW2, not Monolithsoft Tokyo.\n\n115\n\nelectrolite77\n\n3D World and Pikmin 3 seem obvious and are bound to happen soon.\n\nI’ll be surprised if the Zelda and Yoshi don’t happen (assuming it’ll have the Poochy stuff from the 3DS version).\n\nStar fox is the interesting one. The Franchise and indeed the Genre struggles to sell these days, and it would obviously need a bit of,work. But it would almost certainly be a lot less work than a new game so you never know.\n\n116\n\nwazlon\n\n@JSDude1 TV screens are much bigger than they were in the Gamecube days so your idea of a mini map would work well. Am all up for Nintendo bringing the HD Zelda games to Switch so more people can experience them.\n\n117\n\nwestman98\n\nSuper Mario 3D World and Pikmin 3 are both getting Deluxe Editions on Switch.\n\nWind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD might get ported, but it may not happen until after Breath of the Wild 2 is released.\n\nEverything else is probably off the table.\n\n118\n\nMallen001\n\nIt would be cool to have hd ports of the remade Ocarina and Majora's mask games from the 3ds\n\n119\n\nSillyG\n\nI would love to double dip with both Watch_Dogs games, so long as both games are fully playable from the cartridge alone.\n\nI had always been disappointed that Watch_Dogs on Wii U didn't take advantage of the Gamepad in any meaningful way as the concept could have really benefited from it.\n\n120\n\nMoroboshi876\n\n@JSDude1 That would be awesome, but I think maybe NES games are more suitable for this kind of minichallenges. Anyway it's not very probable even as a straight port of what we already had. I think it wasn't that known even on Wii U.\n\n121\n\nwestman98\n\nWii U games whose successors have already released (or will soon release) on Switch are definitely not hetting ported to the Switch. The exception to this would be Mario 3D World, but I'd say that differs from Mario Odyssey enough to justify a Switch port. If Mario Odyssey was actually Mario 3D World 2, then Mario 3D World wouldn't get ported to Switch.\n\nGames that use the Wii U gamepad extensively and games with ridiculously low sales potential are also unlikely to get ported to Switch. Exceptions would be TMS#FE and TW101, but those games aren't developed by Nintendo EPD (and in the case of TW101, it needed to be kickstarted).\n\n122\n\n__jamiie\n\n@Madder128 I agree. I love Devil's Third.\n\n123\n\nElvie\n\nBarely any shout-outs to ZombiU.\n\nOne of the best horror games of the last decade that deserves a proper rerelease or sequel.\n\nDevil's Third was drenched in bugs and flaws but its multiplayer and core gameplay made up for it.\n\n124\n\nDman10\n\n@EmmatheBest they should be ported because only a handful people including you bought Wii U (I am exaggerating). It is not meant for you but for millions (including me) to experience these for the first time. Plus , there is a market for ports and remakes (again, not for you but for others).\n\n125\n\nblackknight77\n\nI love NES remix so much I wish they would bring it back\n\n126\n\n__jamiie\n\n@nessisonett You don't have to buy them. Farm the games out to a port specialist so it doesn't hinder Nintendo's new output. Where's the harm??? Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has made Nintendo enormous amounts of cash that helps fund new games and future consoles. It's a win for Switch owners who have never played them. It's a win for Nintendo's bank balance. It's a win for fans who have played the ports because it means tons more money and time for Nintendo to create new IP and new games in existing. Everybody wins surely?\n\n127\n\nParaka\n\n@the4seer - But everything is becoming a dumping ground for older ports, in fact, there is signs third parties and their ports are the reason we're seeing less backwards compatibility, and a push for an all-digital platform.\n\nSony has recently gone on record with a vague answer to this only being \"the top 100.\" And this dancing around gives them the excuse for \"Director's Complete DX Cut Deluxe Edition Collection,\" that third parties are pumping out. Don't pretend the first year of the PS4 was essentially this, and expect the same with the PS5.\n\nThere is a reason, outside pure greed, that there is ports releasing so often; Not many make their money back the first release.\n\n128\n\n__jamiie\n\n@JimmySpades Pandora's Tower and The Last Story would be in my list.\n\n129\n\nJimmySpades\n\n@__jamiie If you look at my recent comments I had reason to make such a list. Both games were on it.\n\n130\n\n__jamiie\n\n@JimmySpades Wow! Bit aggressive to my fairly innocuous comment. Thankfully I don't spend my life reading through all of your previous comments. Although in future I'll make sure I set a reminder to check them just in case I agree with your choices and you still get salty.\n\n131\n\nkepsux\n\nguys starfox guard.\n\n132\n\nWhiteTrashGuy\n\nFirst of all, Switch has a STAR FOX game as STARLINK fills that need right now. Second, I want DEVIL'S THIRD on Switch more than any other game on this list. Motion aiming would help it out immensely and the online component was one of the best I ever played. In fact, I just pulled it out and played it a couple of weeks ago. So much trashy fun!\n\n133\n\nBolt_Strike\n\nNo thanks. Everything I wanted out of the Wii U is on Switch already.\n\n134\n\nStephenYap3\n\n@La-weejee Not everybody enjoys being timed to play a Story Mode before Game Over.\n\n135\n\nSwitch-a-Roony\n\nBatman Arkham City : Armored Edition.\n\n136\n\nHeavyarms55\n\nMost of this list I would buy. Not all of it, but most of it.\n\n137\n\nDebo626\n\nThe only game on the list that interests me is XCX. Tied for my favorite game of all time with XC1 and BotW, I'd happily spend another 900 hours roaming its vast and wonderful seamless world. Then we'd have all 3 on one amazing console.\n\nThat said, I'd also take XC3 and XCX2 before any more ports. But hell, I'd buy XCX again and still buy XC3 and XCX2.\n\n138\n\nJimmySpades\n\n@__jamiie I apologize if I offended you by agreeing with you, by thinking that you may be interested in something else that I've said on this very subject recently, or by indicating a simple way for you to access those prior words. In the future I shall understand that replying to me in no wise indicates a desire to engage in conversation, and shall respond accordingly.

Yes I said it.\n\nMake it so that you use a 2nd Switch for the 2nd screen. I realize they probably won't do it but that game is amazing and I hope I'm wrong\n\n146\n\nKrambo42\n\nI'm surprised you think NES Remix is so unlikely to happen. Personally, I think that the fact that it isn't on Switch yet is one of the strangest things about the Switch.\n\n147\n\nGetShulked\n\nReally would like to see Xenoblade X, and the Switch will be complete on the entire Xenoblade library.\n\n148\n\nDwaynesGames\n\n@invictus4000 Yes! I would totally replay a Skyward Sword port. From Skyward Sword to Breath of the Wild, the Wii U was a Zelda powerhouse.\n\n149\n\nDwaynesGames\n\n@Krambo42 Agreed! NES Remix would be a perfect fit for Switch in handheld mode.\n\nI doubt they would, but they should add NES Remix to NSO. Regardless, I would still repurchase it.\n\nAnd bring an SNES Remix.\n\n150\n\nDwaynesGames\n\n@leo13 Nintendo Land was perfect for when casual gamers were visiting. So much fun! The kids played Smash Bros too, but Nintendo Land was more approachable and entertaining for all ages.\n\n151\n\nmantez\n\nI love amiibo festival. A nice game to play every now and again. Prefer boom street though, would love a switch version\n\n152\n\njikflet\n\nunpopular opinion here, but why we have to sume all WiiU library have to be ported? why don't leave some games there as a sign of respect, and just get new entries instead ? just my thoughts.\n\n153\n\nNintendoArchive\n\n@mesome713 wouldn't work on switch\n\n154\n\nNintendoArchive\n\n@jikflet because people are unoriginal and unambitious in their imaginations\n\n155\n\neaglesfly76\n\nJust port 3D World but get rid of the timer in the game. Add some wrinkles and let people explore a bit more without being timed.\n\n156\n\nNerdyBoutKirby\n\nI will always support Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. That one's beautiful and refreshingly original, even when compared with Canvas Curse. Perhaps the best soundtrack on Wii U, alongside Tropical Freeze.\n\n157\n\nJaguar_Wong\n\nIs there a reason the fantastic Affordable Space Adventures isn't listed?\n\n158\n\nKidfunkadelic83\n\nOnly wiiu games idstill like ported over are the 2 zeldas, pikmin 4, yoshi's woolly world (as the colour pallet and aesthetics far superior to the switch one), Xenoblade X and they are missing an absolute trick with NES remix volume 2 but id rather a new snes remix was done.\n\n159\n\ndartmonkey\n\nFor anyone who wanted to see Nintendo Land and Rainbow Curse, I've added them.\n\n@Jaguar_Wong I've stuck to physical releases, although ASA is in my personal Wii U top 5. Brilliant game, although not one that could easily translate to Switch.\n\n160\n\nDancampulung\n\nNintendo Land is in my top 10 Wii U games. I hope Nintendo finds a way to add it to the Switch.\n\n161\n\nshaneoh\n\nMissing Game & Wario. It's not going to happen, but you're still missing it.\n\n162\n\narnoldlayne83\n\nPlease give me Wind Waker and Pikmin 3 and I can happily bury my WiiU\n\n163\n\nRazer\n\nI only care about both Zelda games.\n\nWatch Dogs if they do some improvements to the driving in that game.\n\n164\n\nJoakimZ\n\nYoshi’s Woolly World is my favourite Wii U exclusive. If Woolly World, 3D World and the Zelda games were released on Switch I would never have to plug in my Wii U ever again, which would be nice.\n\n165\n\narty77\n\nunbeliveable we haven't got mario world 3d yet\n\n(I never had a wiiu and now its too late so I have to stick to emulation )\n\n166\n\narty77\n\n@Paraka sony changed their mind and promise almost 100% bw compatibility!! and those 100 titles will be enhanced too.\n\nsounds great in my book, love MS who pushed this trend in the past years\n\nhope nintendo will follow....\n\n167\n\nJLPick\n\nI'd love to see Super Mario 3D World and Yoshi's Wooly World arrive. I'd also love for Pikmin 3 to come, but as far as the Pikmin series...a trilogy collection instead followed by the announcement of part 4. As for the Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival...leave that game to die!\n\n168\n\nRetrohelmet\n\nI have been waiting for a long time for the Zelda games to come over. Would buy them today for switch if I could. Only the two Zelda games please and Mario 3D World. Crazy they haven't been ported yet. All those other games are forgettable.\n\n169\n\nlacaras4\n\nI'd like to see more Wii games ported instead of more Wii U games, Super Mario Galaxy, Kirby's Epic Yarn, The Last Story, just to name a few...\n\n170\n\nelectrolite77\n\n2020 and still got people going ‘but but but why not new games instead of ports?‘\n\nAs if they’re the same.\n\nSigh.\n\n171\n\nParaka\n\n@arty77 - I looked that up, seems that they made vague responses about expansion of the BW compatibility. Essentially saying it's up to third parties to do that for their games.\n\nAlso, Nintendo has been the most consistent with the BW compatibility for their consoles. Wii read GCN, Wii U read Wii, and most portable read a gen back.\n\nSo that's why I suspect third parties are pulling more mandatory downloads on their games. Cannot be downloaded again on the newer system if the digital support isn't there.\n\n172\n\nDang69\n\n@mesome713 Yeah but how would Nintendo Land play?\n\n173\n\nearthinheritor\n\nPikmin and Xenoblade sure, i dont think they got the love they deserved. But the others had their time and some have even be released several times. And we all know Nintendo would still charge full retail for a Gamecube game, like Twilight Princess, an that is just total BS\n\n174\n\nkingeo\n\n@nessisonett All these are meant to fill gaps not to replace any new entries, would you rather have nothing to play at all?\n\nAnd don't forget that many millions who didn't have a Wi U will buy them, it's just not for the ones who played them back then.\n\n175\n\nstevenw45\n\nhaving Super Mario 3D World and Pikmin 3 on the Nintendo Switch would be nice. although i rather have a Pikmin 4 than a Pikmin 3 port. however, should have been ported over to the switch already.\n\nNintendo has ported the same Zelda games so many times in one way or another that i do not think the two on this list will appear as ports on the Nintendo switch. its either that or they should have been ported over already.\n\n176\n\nBulbasaurusRex\n\nI still say that the Wii U's features are too important in \"Pikmin 3\" (needs a stylus on a touchscreen to play properly), XCX (needs constant access to the bottom map screen to play properly), and \"Star Fox Zero\" for any ports to do them justice. I suppose you could just take the annoying asynchronous gameplay out of \"Star Fox Zero,\" but then it's just another reboot of the original Star Fox story with nothing to stand out, plus some players actually like its gameplay hook.\n\nAs for the Zelda remasters, I can't see Nintendo being too interested in remastering them yet again just to expand the audience a little further. They've already been upgraded to HD and had some fixes made, and unlike most other Wii U games, many Switch owners who skipped the Wii U have already played if not still own the games on GameCube or Wii, so further remasters would be mostly redundant from Nintendo's viewpoint.\n\n177\n\nBulbasaurusRex\n\n@JimmySpades While various Wii games may better deserve a modern port (especially with the opportunity to remaster the graphics to HD), the point is that the Wii was already extremely popular, so most fans of those games already own them on the Wii. On the other hand, so many gamers skipped the Wii U but then bought a Switch that they never had an opportunity to play the best Wii U games unless they're ported to Switch.\n\nBesides, any Wii games that heavily used the IR feature (including all the motion controlled shooters) would be downgraded as Switch remasters\n\n178\n\nJimmySpades\n\n@BulbasaurusRex The Wii is almost 14 years old. There are plenty of people who haven't had the chance to become fans of those games yet.\n\n179\n\nBulbasaurusRex\n\n@JimmySpades That number pales in comparison to those who skipped the Wii U. Plus, it doesn't matter how old the Wii is, just that it was discontinued only 8 years ago.\n\n180\n\nJaguar_Wong\n\n@dartmonkey That's a very good reason!\n\n181\n\nGrailUK\n\nI have to say, I reckon Nintendo Land has buckets of potential. If they can manage a 51 worldwide games type deal* with all their IP, SOLD!\n\n*Of course I'm not being so unreasonable as to wanting 51 games lol. I just mean...more lol. (slightly less unreasonable hee hee)\n\n182\n\ncyrus_zuo\n\nPushmo\n\nThat is all!\n\n183\n\narty77\n\n@Paraka not really! see https://blog.playstation.com/2020/03/18/unveiling-new-details-of-playstation-5-hardware-technical-specs/\n\n4000+ games will be compatible + if 3rd parties will put efforts into enhancing their games for ps5, they can also do that\n\nnintendo was consistent in the way that when they had backwards compatibility, they run most prev gen games\n\nbut they are not consistent wether they provide backwards compatibility or not... sometimes they just do\n\n184\n\nParaka\n\n@arty77 - That, \"we believe all titles will be compatible,\" statement sounds to me they're making PR spin. Meaning if they're wrong, they're not.\n\nPlus digital only titles cannot technically be backwards unless you can download them from a PS4 shop, something NOT stated in that link you can do.\n\nThat second paragraph also relieves them of personal excuse to say PS5 ports \"needed adjustment\" if a third party decides to port Resident Evil 4... Again.\n\nSo no, this is by no means a guarantee that's what they plan, as they clearly don't plan on doing effort to just place PS4 tech into it, instead replicate it.\n\n\"We believe that the overwhelming majority of the 4,000+ PS4 titles will be playable on PS5.\"\n\nThis is vague enough to convince, cause technically ports of PS4 games would still count.\n\n185\n\narty77\n\nWell I was more on the pessimistic side until the statement from sony... but you are still negative and don't think anything can convince you\n\nPSN store is currently for ps3 and ps4, this isn't nintendo where you have different stores for every generation. Same for xbox more or less.... (at least for compatible titles).\n\nAnd a ps5 remake of re4 cannot be counted as bw compat in my opinion.\n\nBut ok, we will see. Hope I will be right though\n\n186\n\nGamerGeek87\n\ni'd love it if the new mario oddessy game would come out for the Wii u,cause i would Definitely buy it.\n\n187\n\nShiLilith\n\nThe only two that are important is Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD... totally worth the money when buying games.\n\n188\n\nGrandScribe\n\nAll I want are the Zelda ports\n\n189\n\nMasterJay\n\n3D World Deluxe should be announced in the next couple of months if the insiders are correct, and then we’re really just waiting on the Zelda remasters, which will hopefully be released for Zelda’s 35 anniversary, and a xenoblade x port.\n\n190\n\nKingBowser86\n\nI think SMM2's game mode is replacing SM3DW's port. Unless Nintendo really is pulling a 3D All-Stars (and they have mentioned HD filtering as a possibility in the past).\n\nStar Fox Zero would be nice but needs heavy, heavy retooling.\n\n191\n\nBoostPower\n\nI would like Wind Waker and Deus Ex, maybe Starfox if it would have a complete redesign and added a ton of content\n\n192\n\nsanderev\n\nXenoblade, Zelda Wind Waker and Mario and I'm a happy camper.\n\n193\n\nZequio\n\nNes remix should be a free game with The online service alas Tetris 99. It could be awesome\n\n194\n\nDirty0814\n\nA majority of these would have good success if ported even if it was just a digital port. Although I would like to see many of them physically ported myself.\n\n195\n\ntroj27\n\nI would love nothing more than Deus Ex on the Switch! That would be brilliant! One of my all time favourite games\n\n196\n\nMrMetroid\n\nHonestly all that's left is for 3D World and the two Zelda's (particularly Wind Waker since it's a full remake) to come to switch.\n\n197\n\nKev_Morrison\n\nWould love for a full Zelda game in the Nintendo Land Art Style!\n\n198\n\nMysteryCupofJoe\n\n@WesEds Agreed. Wooly World is cool in style though. Paper Mario color Splash is very similar to Origami King (compare the two endings and you will know).\n\nSonic Lost World.......Sonic I love you and the game was unique but we need you to evolve man.\n\n199\n\nShadJV\n\nThink all I want at this point is Xeno X. I never did finish it.\n\n200\n\nJokerwolf\n\nWind Waker was a really good port and utilized the Wii U pad quite well and most of that can be used in handheld mode which is awesome.\n\n201\n\nfadedcolors\n\nJust port the Zeldas with a side of Skyward Sword and let the console rest in peace. Fatal Frame too maybe, but im not sure if it would really move units\n\n202\n\nWesEds\n\n@MysteryCupofJoe yeah woolly world does look good but wouldn’t make much sense with crafty world already on the switch,\n\nNever played a paper Mario game because I didn’t think I’d enjoy it but I might give it a try.\n\nSonic games have been a bit of a hit or miss for me sonic heroes and generations were good though\n\n203\n\nLEGEND_MARIOID\n\nSurely we'll see Super Mario 3D World? Would be surprised if we didn't.\n\nI love Twilight Princess, but have played it 3 times on 3 different consoles now so I would prefer to see Windwaker HD come to Switch (I can actually see that happening at some point in the Switch's lifespan).\n\nShame we won't probably get the best Sonic racing game by far (All Stars Racing Transformed) A DX version with all possible characters would have been sweet and surely a potential big sale for Sega.\n\n204\n\nB238ben\n\nI would definitely buy Super Mario 3D World, both Zelda games, and I would love to see Yoshi's Woolly World ported as well. If it is too difficult to develop new games during this pandemic than perhaps just plan on porting over the rest of these games to pad out the schedule. Surely porting these games would be much easier to accomplish than creating new games from scratch and provide quality content that is new to most people (all non Wii U owners). I'd be happy to have higher quality portable versions of these games.\n\n205\n\nTheFrenchiestFry\n\nNow that Pikmin 3 is out there the last three I want are Xenoblade Chronicles X as well as both Wind Waker and Twilight Princess HD.\n\n206\n\nFishLipFace\n\nBoth Zeldas are what I'm holding out hope for, even if I already own both remasters on the Wii U. My Wii U gamepad refuses to work properly unless it's charging at all times, so I want better alternatives that won't require me paying for a repair/new controller.\n\n3D World would be nice as well as I actually traded in my copy believing a switch port was inevitable.\n\n207\n\nSwitchLife\n\n@korosanbo But Epic Yarn was ported to 3DS and 2 new Kirby games are on Switch lol\n\n208\n\nSoapMonki\n\nWhy do you keep forgetting about Splinter Cell Blacklist!!! That game was/is sick on Wii-U! Hoping for a Switch port\n\n209\n\nHeldHero\n\nXenoblade Chronicles X yes...as long as they don't forget to increase font size.\n\n210\n\nmr_eman\n\nI thought these were supposed to be a list of Wii U exclusives that hadn't ported over yet. Deus Ex and Watch Dogs were cross platform, right?\n\n211\n\ndanmonse\n\n@Jaguar_Wong probably because it's an eshop title. It was a great game and would need a ton of work to port without a Gamepad, but definitely deserves to be on this list.\n\n212\n\nmr_eman\n\nNow that Wonderful 101 and Pikmin 3 are off the list, i say you add Mass Effect 3, and Batman Arkham City to the list.\n\n213\n\nLEGEND_MARIOID\n\nActually yes, Arkham City, Metroid Prime Trilogy HD and Mass Effect Trilogy would be nice as well!\n\n214\n\nrosemo\n\nIt's a shame about Nintendo Land. My kids still play that game just about every day. In fact, it's one of the reasons a couple of my kids say they like the Wii U better than Switch. That game doesn't get enough credit. It was truly great as a couch multiplayer game.\n\n215\n\nzool\n\nNothing in that list i'd want to play. I don't even want to play Pikmin 3 again.\n\nI understand that the Wii u sales were bad and Nintendo are putting the games onto the Switch as new games for the millions that didn't want to play them on the Wii U. And those that did play them are in the minority. But on principal I won't pay full price twice for the same game.\n\nI have bought two games this year, Bioshock a third party game, and Paper Mario a Nintendo game. I normally buy at least ten games a year. So what do I play, not much, i don't play the Switch as much and it's ok.\n\nI tried a free Stadia trial, which works ok with the Switch pro controller but its slow to load even though I've got fast WiFi. But I keep trying there is some good games on it.\n\n216\n\nTheWingedAvenger\n\nThey should port Super Mario 3D World and the two Zelda games. Those are the three best games on the Wii U, and Switch owners should play them.\n\n217\n\nSeantheDon29\n\nNintendo Land: Deluxe with Knuckles, or I riot.\n\n218\n\nSwitchLife\n\n@korosanbo I don't blame you considering it wasn't given the most effort or marketing, and it was one of the last games on the platform\n\n219\n\nMrAsild\n\nWe need a Zelda collection next year for the BD just like we will get a Mario one this year. But honestly I am extremely sick of first party ports...\n\n220\n\nMindfulGamer\n\nAlthough I never owned a Wii U, I did play Wind Waker and Twilight Princess on Wii, and like several people here, would like to see the HD versions ported to Switch. Although I really enjoyed BotW overall, I was disappointed in how 'samey' the dungeons/divine beasts were. It's been a while, but I remember the dungeons of WW and TP being much more varied.\n\n221\n\nkalosn\n\nYes, Pikmin 3 has made it, and Super Mario 3D World is next, I bet it\n\nBut please... not for the holiday seasons, leave that to a bigger game. Better release it alongside a certain Mario collection on September.\n\nThe two Zelda remasters, they're coming next year to Switch as part of a collection of the 35th anniversary. Remember those words.\n\nI hope XCX comes one day to Switch too, but only if they polish up some things.\n\nThe other games? They can stay on Wii U, I want it to keep at least some of these games if they really make a good use of the GamePad.\n\n222\n\nKayFiOS\n\nNo Fatal Frame. This list is incomplete.\n\n223\n\nParaka\n\nSurprised they haven't considered the two Zeldas yet. That's just money on the table at this point.\n\nAlso, surprised NES Remix hasn't gotten a continuation on Switch, figured it'd be a easy project to push through to fill in gaps.\n\n224\n\nBman2425\n\nDeus x, both Zelda games, watchdogs\n\nWould be awesome to be brought to the switch!\n\n225\n\nMr_Persona\n\nPLZ PLZ put Twilight Princess on the switch..l don't like the zelda games we have rn, they don't feel to real zelda-ish. I love TP and l will buy it right away and play it over the 10th time but only this it will be on switch.\n\n226\n\nYian_Garuga\n\nTwilight Princess and Wind Waker please!\n\n227\n\nwestman98\n\nOne Wii U port down (Pikmin 3 DX), another one (Super Mario 3D World DX) to go for 2020.\n\n228\n\nlocky-mavo\n\nXenoblade X and Fatal Frame 5 are my two most wants. Anything else is just an extra. Need some more Wii, 3/DS and GameCube ports/remasters/remakes.\n\n229\n\nSupadav03\n\nGive me SM3DW, Starfox, NES Remix, Devils Third, & Nintendoland.\n\n230\n\nPriceless_Spork\n\nCan't wait to play Switch ports on the Switch U.\n\n231\n\ntimp29\n\nI would say unlikely to the Zelda titles. If this year is Mario‘s 35th anniversary, next year after is zelda’s - so I’m sure all Zelda releases are saved for then\n\n232\n\nUncle_Franklin\n\nI'd dearly love Kirby and the Rainbow Curse.\n\n233\n\nmuscpt\n\nI raise this glass to hoping the Switch does not become 65% of ports that were either successful or failure on the WiiU in a low-blow technique to get an install base this time around. Nintendo, don't look back, that is how you run into things....\n\n234\n\nBenjinat\n\nMan, I see AC Amiibo Festival and I get the chills.\n\n235\n\nSuperToe\n\n3D World and Wind Waker. That'll do.\n\n236\n\ndr-gorgo\n\nNothing should be ported anymore. Nintendo should finally start making genuine new games.\n\n237\n\navictorao\n\nIf Nintendo released Wind Waker HD, Star Fox 0 (fixing a couple issues) and Yoshi's WW, I'd be more than happy😇\n\n238\n\nthe_beaver\n\nThe Zeldas HD, Mario 3D World and Xenoblade X MUST come to the Switch.\n\nI have spoken.\n\n239\n\nFargusPelagius\n\nI'd rather get a sequel to Nes Remix in the form of SNES remix and N64 Remix, that would be fun. Also Devil's Thirds multiplayer released standalone or free to play would get me subbing for Switch online again. That multiplayer was so bat*hit crazy and fun I'd definitely give it another go. Was genuinely gutted when they pulled the Wii U multiplayer, my base was well fortified and I'd got a good active clan reaping other bases. The concept just needed rounding out and a little more polish.\n\n240\n\nStalkyOcelot\n\nForget WiiU ports, I'd love to see an Eternal Darkness reboot. (God I'm so old...)\n\n241\n\nTheFox\n\n@avictorao I'd be up for a new Star Fox game, but I honestly think the only way to \"fix\" Zero is to bury it and start over. I think if they did port it, even with better controls, it would just disillusion a whole new groups of gamers. The whole game was built around level design constrained the N64. On-rails, free range mode confined to tiny combat areas, running time of the whole game about four hours... If they re-release this game, anyone who buys it that isn't a religious devotee of the franchise will vow never to buy another Star Fox.\n\n@FargusPelagius I figure there's no chance because the game was so torn down in the games media and YouTube, but the return of Devil's Third would be amazing. It seems like most of the people that bought it actually did enjoy the game (sadly, that's not a lot of people). What I'd love to see, knowing that Nintendo wouldn't sink much money into it, is to bring back the same exact multiplayer. Then make a new single player campaign, even if it's really short, just to show where the story went after Ivan took out the S.O.D., but wait, the bad guys have infiltrated the U.S. government!\n\n242\n\nFargusPelagius\n\n@TheFox aye the single player for DT needed more work to iron it out than the Multiplayer, which as it was, really solid fun. The MP was the only bit they released for a ftp PC version in Russia apparently. No idea what has happened to Valhalla now tho, they likely went bust. I played Rogue company and got a similar DT vibe, but with worse execution and dull modes (is that even possible!? with DTs review score lol).\n\n243\n\nBadBadMountain\n\nNever picked up a Wii U but Sin and Punishment: Star Successor HD would be amazing. Even if it was just digital due to it's low initial sales numbers.\n\n244\n\nMPSSislit\n\n@KingBowser86, @BulbasaurusRex, @HexagonSun, @shani, @Muddy_4_Ever, @TheFox, and anyone else who will who bring Star Fox Zero's Dual Screen Setup.\n\nPeople seem to forgot that's you can reverse the screens for Star Fox Zero, so that the cockpit is on the TV and not the Gamepad. All you have to do is press - to switch the screens.\n\nThen, if they end up doing SFZ DX, they could have an option to automatically or manually switch the cockpit when you're using Direct-i for example, in the pause menu.\n\n245\n\nKingBowser86\n\n@ACNHislit I'd just as soon have them change the missions to where timewasters and gimmicks are removed altogether. Ideally, we'd have Fox look more like his Melee/64 incarnations and remove the stupid \"Zero\" moniker and gaudy orange circle from the Arwings, too.\n\n246\n\nDarknyht\n\nAh.. The Wii U is the console where I will always be able to play the exclusive Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival because let's be honest, that is probably the only game on this list other than maybe Devil's Third that isn't going to be ported to another console at some point.\n\n247\n\nBulbasaurusRex\n\n@ACNHislit What does it matter if you can switch the screens when simultaneous access to both screens is still required no matter which way you set them up?\n\n248\n\nMPSSislit\n\n@KingBowser86\n\nOkay. 👍 I seem to be one of the only ones who liked Star Fox Zero, but I can understand why people don't like it as much (or at all).\n\n249\n\nMPSSislit\n\n@BulbasaurusRex\n\nSo that people wouldn't have to constantly look down at the Gamepad, and just the TV, if they switch views consistently.\n\nAlso, it means that it could still come to Switch, as you would could switch views when you need to, just like in other Star Fox games.\n\n250\n\nKingBowser86\n\n@ACNHislit I mean, you can look at the game and still see that there's the fundamentals of a Star Fox game, so it just needs tooling to fix what the reviews mentioned.\n\n251\n\nrockodoodle\n\n@rosemo I think Nintendo Land is one of the most underrated games of all time. If it can’t be translated, I get it, but I would love for Nintendo to make something similar for the Switch- and even incorporate some games from here if possible.\n\n252\n\nrockodoodle\n\n@Darknyht wouldn’t be so sure given how popular AC has become.\n\n253\n\nMax_the_German\n\nAfter SM3DW confirmed: What is the next port? My guess: XCX\n\n254\n\nGiygas_95\n\n@Max_the_German My bet goes to Wind Waker HD and/or Twilight Princess HD. Next year is Zelda's 35 anniversary. After that, that just leaves Paper Mario Color Splash, Star Fox Zero, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, Yoshi's Wooly World, and Xenoblade X.\n\nSomeone on here said that apparently Monolith said it would be too expensive to port. I don't know how true that is, but it might be.\n\nI don't see Kirby and the Rainbow Curse happening...it was pretty reliant on the gamepad. Same with Star Fox though I wouldn't mind a re-do on Zero with the control scheme re-worked.\n\nYoshi's Wooly World is another possibility, but I dunno about that one since it already got a 3DS port.\n\n255\n\ncarlos82\n\nNES Remix is the only Wii U game left that I want, I'll definitely take Wii Sports Resort and Windwaker as well though\n\n256\n\nRandomname19\n\nKinda off-topic.But Nintendoland 2 would be amazing(and also a new WarioWare)\n\n257\n\nDarknyht\n\nWarioware: Game and Wario is missing from the list. It also doesn’t have much of a chance, but the multiplayer games are still popular in our house.\n\n258\n\nroboshort\n\nStar Fox Guard and Mario vs Donkey Kong are still missing from the list.\n\n259\n\nRoibeard64\n\nI suspect we will see wind weaker and TP next year for zeldas big year. Maybe even Skyward sword.\n\n260\n\nLEGEND_MARIOID\n\nSurely with Zelda's Anniversary coming up, they can port Twilight and Windwaker to the Switch as part of a trilogy with Skyward Sword HD?!\n\n(I wouldn't mind XCX remastered as well, on reflection. After playing the superb Def. Ed of the glorious Xenoblade Chronicles especially)\n\n261\n\nJohnnyC\n\nI can see the two Zelda titles happening at some point, but that's it now from this list. As nice as they'd be, the others would either cost more than they'd make back to rerelease and/or remove gamepad functionality, or have been made redundant in the eyes of the developers by subsequent entries in their series.\n\n262\n\nAnguspuss\n\n@LEGEND_MARIOID i hope so that would be an awsome trillogy.\n\n263\n\nStuTwo\n\nI think some of the port potential depends on how long Nintendo intends the Switch to live for (which is also partly determined by how well it continues to sell). If it's got a long life ahead of it then I can definitely see XCX and games like Yoshi's Woolly World. Even Paper Mario Colour Splash if the Switch is still going to be a going concern in 2023.\n\nWhy not? The main thing holding those games back is market saturation and risking devaluing the brand/confusing the market by releasing too many games in a series in too quick a succession.\n\nIt's only really this that will stop us from seeing WWHD and TPHD next year (and makes it touch and go for those games even in 2022).\n\n264\n\nJeronan\n\nZelda: Windwaker is really a no-brainer and I am suprised it is taking this long to port over.\n\nWould really love to see this game to be ported over. The HD remake looked fantastic on the WiiU and it will look and play even better on the Switch. Not to mention being able to play it on the go.\n\n265\n\nimpurekind\n\nIt feels like there's a lot of games you didn't mention that maybe would have been better choices than some of the games you did mention. It's just a feeling.\n\n266\n\nAtlanteanMan\n\nI'd definitely love to see Xenoblade Chronicles X make the leap over to Switch; I played well over 200 hours in the original.\n\nAlthough they're from the GameCube and Wii respectively, a compilation of Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn would be hugely welcome.\n\nAs for the Zelda games, next year happens to be the 35th Anniversary of The Legend of Zelda. Begin speculation now...\n\n267\n\nBomberman64\n\nEverytime this article gets reposted I ask myself why Affordable Space Adventures isn't listed. I know it is as improbable as Rainbow Curse and Nintendo Land, but it deserves just as much attention to how great a game it was!\n\n268\n\nBomberman64\n\n@roboshort It'd be somewhat funny if those games do get ports and NL has to quickly add them to their list 👍\n\n269\n\ndatamonkey\n\nI’d much rather they forgot Wii U and gave us some games from GC and 3DS like TTYD, Excitetruck and Advance Wars...\n\n270\n\nSlain\n\nBesides XCX, I really want both HD Zelda's. Having said that, if they do end up porting the Zelda games, I would really love a HD remaster of Skyward Sword too.\n\n271\n\nBass_X0\n\nThe Legend of Zelda 3D All Stars for the 35th anniversary?\n\n272\n\nLUIGITORNADO\n\nI’d like to give Xenoblade X another shot. Back when it released it was a cluttered messed.\n\nIf they good retool Starfox Zero entirely by taking out the second screen stuff it could be a decent game as well.\n\n273\n\nLUIGITORNADO\n\n@Bass_X0 knowing Nintendo they’d leave our Majoras Mask. Pretty sure people would riot too\n\n274\n\nNeoguardian86\n\nI think at this point Zelda Wind Waker and Twilight Princess is what's left that i think has a good chance of porting over.\n\nPersonally though i'd love to see Yarn Yoshi and Star Fox Zero to come over, but i am not holding my breath on that.\n\n275\n\niphys\n\nThe only thing I'm still playing on my Wii U is the VC. Switch Online is cheap but it's also frustrating not being able to just buy the games you want to play and who knows if we'll even get games beyond NES/SNES.\n\n276\n\ncyrus_zuo\n\nIs really like Pushmo World.\n\nVery underrated game.\n\n277\n\nstevenw45\n\nunless they do a remake collection, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker will not be brought over the the Nintendo Switch. it has already been ported from system to system way to many times already.\n\nand besides Nintendo needs to port Wii Fit U and Wii Sports Club over to the Nintendo Switch. right now that is way more important than porting over an old Zelda game that we may have multiple copies of over to the Switch.\n\nI already have a few copies and versions of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and i do not need another.\n\nhowever, it would be nice to see NES Remix Pack come to the Nintendo Switch, but i have a feeling that when it does, it will only be available through the Nintendo Switch Online services.\n\n278\n\nSabrewing\n\nSadly, Monolith doesn't want to invest in a Switch port of XCX, and I can't say I blame them, given how literally huge the game world is.\n\nhttps://www.gameinformer.com/2018/10/18/monolith-soft-says-a-xenoblade-chronicles-x-switch-port-would-be-too-expensive\n\n279\n\nGetShulked\n\nI would really love to see Xenoblade X come to the Switch. Then all 3 will be on the same console.\n\n280\n\nWoomyNNYes\n\nI would love Splatoon 1. I didn't have a Wii U.\n\n281\n\nstevenw45\n\n@whereswarren\n\nactually it has two ports. and there are three 3 different versions/editions of it for the GameCube. one of the editions is a bundle that includes two or three different other legend of Zelda games from older systems.\n\ni got the Wii U version for free due to some promotion and i still haven't played it; not the Wii U version anyways. and unfortunately, i forgot what system the game was ported over to.\n\nthe Wii U version is just an updated version of the original GameCube version. and the game has been re-released on the GameCube 2 or three time. each re-lease just including a small number of updates and fixes that Nintendo never told anyone about. unfortunately Nintendo has done that with a lot of their games on older systems.\n\nIf it does get ported to the Nintendo Switch i just hope it gets bundled over as a collection so then we can at least feel as though we are getting our moneys worth.\n\nand because of Pikmin 3 being ported over, i am starting to feel as though they should port over the other two Pikmin games. the GameCube versions, not the Wii Versions. i think those versions are slightly better and would have a better chance of getting good support for the Joy-Con controllers. and fortunately/unfortunately Nintendo will be porting over a lot more of their older games onto the Nintendo Switch.\n\n282\n\nNintendan84\n\nTwilight and windwaker hd? Yea right. I don't want a port of a remake. I already played those games twice\n\n283\n\nBeyondKnight\n\nI would love Xenoblade X for Switch, I skipped the Wii U and would be so happy for a port of it\n\n284\n\nPickledKong64\n\n@Koolaidman84 then dont buy it.\n\nMod edit: No need for name-calling.\n\n285\n\nPickledKong64\n\n@WoomyNNYes splatoon 1 is better than splatoon 2 imo. I used to be a god at it. Best turf war I got 56 splats!\n\n286\n\nBaker1000\n\nWell why are you saying NES Remix is only 3/10 probability? I think it would be a perfect fit for Switch, and a good way to get people reacquainted if they made a SNES Remix. Basically, I just really want those on Switch.\n\n287\n\ndartmonkey\n\nI've added Wii Sports Club, Star Fox Guard and Game & Wario to the list.\n\n@Bomberman64 We've stuck to physical releases-only to keep the list trim. Affordable Space Adventures is amazing, though! Top 5 Wii U games, for me\n\n288\n\nMorph\n\nOf what's left I think Xenoblade X will definitely make it to Switch. I think there's every chance the two Zelda Re-releases will make it along with Skyward Sword. After that I'd personally like to see Project Zero and I think I'm done with the Wii U. I'm not sure if they could do anything with Starfox but I think I'd rather just have a new game altogether built for Switch.\n\n289\n\nWoomyNNYes\n\n@PickledKong64 haha, 56 splats is insane!\n\n290\n\nEddyson\n\nSo basically there are only 4 reasons left why I needed a wii u, posthumously...\n\n291\n\nNintendan84\n\n@PickledKong64 uh oh another Nintendo fan boy protecting Nintendo and their dumb decisions. Why don't you crawl back under the bridge troll. Nobody wants that attitude here\n\n292\n\nVR32X\n\nAll these have bad scores except Zelda. Zelda 3D All-Stars confirmed. Long live Wii U. Will never sell mine. Lol\n\n293\n\nPickledKong64\n\n@Koolaidman84 lol we are on a nintendo website. What the hell did you expect?\n\n294\n\nPickledKong64\n\n@WoomyNNYes it was. And it was on the skatepark map\n\n295\n\nstevenw45\n\n@whereswarren\n\ni wasn't counting a repackaging of the same game as a port. and i forgot which system that also received a port of the game. of course then i don't always keep track of which games receive ports and which ones do not. however, at one point i created a list of which Nintendo games have received ports.\n\nalthough it may be nice to see Nintendo port Wind Waker onto the switch, assuming they add some feature or content that make the game worth buying again\n\nno one has ever called me a tit before. of course then i have never heard tit being used as an insult. and I'm somewhat disappointed that you made the assumption that i did not know the difference between a port and a repackage.\n\n296\n\nNintendan84\n\n@PickledKong64 i expected some people with some common sense and not eat everything that is fed to them. You wanna keep eating slop, fine. im waiting for the steak\n\n297\n\nWoomyNNYes\n\n@PickledKong64 You're going to get yourself banned calling people names, or acting disrespectful. If you use see people acting disrespectful, you can hit the report button on the comment, and the moderators will deal with it. I'd rather you stay here You can also add people to you Ignore list with the \"ignore\" button on user's comments. There are a couple people that always seem to troll & flame (but do it just enough to avoid getting banned) that made my list.\n\n298\n\nMana_Knight\n\nGuys.............\n\nHow did you forget Sonic Boom?\n\n299\n\nhotgamer77\n\nShould point out that Wind Waker and Twilight Princess are GAMECUBE games PORTED to Wii U. It's more likely that Nintendo has plans to release GameCube games on Switch- oh, wait Super Mario Sunshine is coming, so they already ARE releasing GameCube games on Switch!\n\n300\n\noknazevad\n\nI'd expect a Zelda HD all-stars as part of the anniversary next year, and even then remember they really aren't Wii U games, but previous generation games that were already re-released. That's about it. Most of these were meh, and I think they've covered most of their bases in terms of trying to get these games out to those who skipped the Wii U (which is most people, being the Wii U was a failure)\n\n301\n\nSMUGSLOTH69\n\nUh when will Nintendo give us that amiibo festival port I don't care if it made people mad the game interests me and the switch has a mainline AC so no one should get angry\n\n302\n\nNintendoDad\n\nMy vote is for Nintendo Land!!!\n\nBut, rather than a port . . . how about a new \"Nintendo Land 2\".\n\nNintendo Land is one of my family's favourite games, and the biggest reason we still fire up our Wii U.\n\nIMHO just port the games that work with one screen. Add some new games. And call it \"Nintendo Land 2\".\n\nAs for the asymmetric games that require 2 screens . . . maybe port the games to work, but require two Switches and an on-line subscription!\n\n303\n\nchickenguy\n\nI personally wouldn't mind a port of amiibo festival for free. I didn't really mind the game too much.\n\n304\n\nTheFrenchiestFry\n\nLiterally all that's left from the Wii U generation that I wanted to play but couldn't since I didn't own one are the HD remasters of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess\n\nHaving the last few 3D Zeldas on one console would be incredible\n\n305\n\nMiraj2081\n\nI think it's highly likely we'll see the Zelda remasters and Xenoblade X come to Switch at some point. They're easier to port since they don't rely on the second screen so much.\n\nI would love to see Woolly World, Kirby's Epic Yarn, and Colour Splash get ported, maybe with small new features just to make them a little more palatable for a repurchase. Maybe they can adjust some of the battle mechanics in Colour Splash, since that seems to be the game's main issue.\n\nMy dream is that we'll see a Star Fox on Switch, and while I'm super mixed on Zero even without the awkward controls, if they were to add more story content (introducing the Assault characters, perhaps) and an online multiplayer mode, it would be worthwhile for \"core\" Star Fox fans. Still, I think they should do something new with the series and drop the rail shooter angle, as it's just not a widely popular genre anymore.\n\n306\n\nJSDude1\n\nI really just want NES Remix, in addition to the Zeldas. (Also DeusEx and Batman on the 3rd party front).\n\n307\n\nLow_ink\n\nI'd like the HD Zelda remasters, Wooly World, and a new Nintendo Land. But none of them are likely, for one reason or another.\n\n308\n\nmariomaster96\n\nIt still saddens me that the only 3 Wii U ports I'd be interested in (XCX, TWWHD and TPHD) haven't been ported yet\n\n309\n\nOdnetninAges\n\nXenoblade X, NES Remix Pack, and the HD Zeldas should all come over.\n\nYoshi's Wooly World too, but they won't do it.\n\n310\n\nGrailUK\n\nI would like to suggest maybe Earthbound Beginnings belongs on this list. It's practically a Wii U exclusive for us!\n\n311\n\nDwaynesGames\n\nWith the success of Miitopia, I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more 3DS ports.\n\n312\n\nClassic603\n\nFrom this list I'd only want Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. But throw in the Wii's Metroid Prime Trilogy and hot dang I'd be giddy\n\n313\n\ndustinprewitt\n\nstill have my Wii U plugged in and ready for use, and about ready to give Xenoblade Chronicles X another play through, and maybe try out Harvest Moon for the first time.\n\nIm more interested in Nintendo 3DS ports, or Ports of games that are Out of Print and otherwise no longer available (like that Fire Emblem Game Cube or Wii game)\n\n314\n\nOtoemetry\n\n@dartmonkey you've left some of the fatal frame text in the 2nd page which says how unlikely it is that it'll ever be ported to Switch, just FYI 😜\n\n315\n\nSnatcher\n\nKeep Color splash, out of my ports.\n\n316\n\ndartmonkey\n\n@Otoemetry You saw NOTHING\n\n317\n\nSillyG\n\nPrior to the launch of New Horizons, I was hoping that Amiibo Festival would have been an extra mode tossed into the main menu screen as a bonus. Alas...\n\nDefinitely not worthwhile as a standalone game in its current state. Now, if it had been anything like Mario Party or Wii Party, then absolutely. And really, it's the sort of game that should have been free from the outset anyway as they could have subsidised development costs (whatever little there was of it) via Amiibo sales, and the physical edition should have been a budget game, primarily factoring in the cost of the amiibo figures and cards as opposed to the game itself. Even at AU$5 it was struggling to sell. I expected that people might at least be interested in the included figurines and exclusive amiibo cards.\n\n318\n\nlocky-mavo\n\nXenoblade X is the only one I want ported now. Can leave the rest, maybe Star Fox Zero.\n\n319\n\nRandomname19\n\nFor me Game & Wario is much better than the new WarioWare.It did a lot of cool stuff with the gamepad.While Get it Together looks just like Wario Ware Gold,a best-of existing microgames, but with co-op.Even my sister thats not really into videogames but enjoys them occasionally was disappointed by WW-GIT,she loved Game and Wario too.\n\n320\n\nLadasta\n\nThey should revisit gamecube instead. Metroid prime, luigis mansion and f-Zero. Give it to us!\n\n321\n\nBloodyMurder\n\nSo long as Nintendo of America are cockblocking it, Xenoblade X will never see a port on the Switch.\n\nBest hope for a sequel folks.\n\n322\n\nSillyG\n\n@Randomname19 : Game & Wario had some fantastic ideas. Camera, Fruit, Gamer, and Sketch were the definite highlights of the package and are worth the price of admission.\n\nThe rest of the package was pretty mediocre though, and the developers didn't seem to know what they wanted to make of it, but I was nevertheless glad that such a game was made. It's still crazy to me that a Pictionary game was never released for the Wii U. The console was absolutely perfect for it.\n\nI am certainly far less enthusiastic about the upcoming WarioWare than I was for Game & Wario though. I already hate the pointing/analog/touch controls that seem tailored for handheld/Switch Lite play. I wanted a motion control experience akin to the still brilliant Smooth Moves. Despite the fact that I use my Switch handheld 99% of the time, I did NOT want a handheld WarioWare game. I wouldn't have minded Get It Together so much if they had released a proper successor to Smooth Moves first, but if this is all we're getting, followed by a hiatus of God only knows how long, then I am extremely disappointed. Honestly, I would have preferred a port of Smooth Moves to this.\n\n323\n\nZach\n\nI bet they'll all come to switch\n\n324\n\nleo13\n\nI really want them to do 2 games:\n\nXenoblade X\n\nNintendo Land\n\nBefore you say it, yes I read what the author wrote about Nintendo Land, but I have found a solution that I will hope for (yes I realize it's not likely, but I'm still hoping).\n\nTarget Nintendo Land to families that have 2 switches (there are a lot of us) and kids who have friends with a Switch. Offer a free download that makes a switch used in handheld the equivalent of the Wii U Gamepad. Then switch 1 has the game and is docked to the TV and Switch 2 has the free download and just acts like the gamepad.\n\nThose 2 were FANTASTIC GAMES and I want to own and play BOTH again.\n\n325\n\nkhululy\n\nWill never happen propably but the first 3 arkham games for switch. Deus ex human recolution will be insta buy for me. it is one of my favorite games to play\n\n326\n\nthe_beaver\n\nXenoblade X: \"We would love to see this come to Switch. Love to. But unless Nintendo is desperate for another huge RPG, it seems less likely than others on this list.\"\n\n5/10. Only Zelda WW and TP are above it xD\n\n327\n\nkhululy\n\n@nessisonett I don't own a WiiU and never will with it being so expensive for a janky console. I am glad they re-released DKC tropical freeze on the switch cuz I totally love the DKC series.\n\nSo yeah it is not all about you but I do agree there is no harm in making new games but porting over older titles or in this case WiiU titles may help fund those new games you want so badly.\n\n328\n\nkhululy\n\n@the_beaver The Pacing in Zelda games is a lot smoother than in most JRPG's I have played\n\n329\n\nthe_beaver\n\n@khululy No, I meant for the \"Switch Port Probability\" XD. I'm not talking about the quality of the games now, it's just funny that.\n\n330\n\nkhululy\n\n@the_beaver Ah I though your comment was about the length of the games.\n\n331\n\nParaka\n\nHonestly surprised that NES Remix hasn't become more common of a thing.\n\n332\n\nroboshort\n\nA Xenoblade X port seems quite likely to me. I can't see why they would not port it other than the engine running better on the WiiU than the Switch.\n\nI just hope it is not a straight port and they find some ways to improve upon it. Though the loss of the gamepad functionality will hurt it somewhat.\n\nI'd also like to see a remaster of Star Fox Zero ported.\n\n333\n\nmichellelynn0976\n\nPlease bring Xenoblade Chronicles X to the Switch. Please 😍😍\n\n334\n\nShiLilith\n\nI was so disappointed with the Nintendo Direct during E3 when WW and TP didn't get on the Switch. It's been five years since the Switch has been out\n\n335\n\nroboshort\n\n@ShiLilith I imagine Nintendo wants to release Skyward Sword HD first before announcing them.\n\nAnd I think they probably wouldn't announce both of them at the same time. Last year Nintendo announced Mario All Stars a really short time before it released so there is still time.\n\n336\n\nRyu_Niiyama\n\nI just need xenoblade x and I am happy. I can play anything else on wiiu.\n\n337\n\nSerpenterror\n\n@ShiLilith Not every Zelda game will be on every system ya know. Switch already got like eight Zelda games (Zelda 1, Zelda 2, AttP, BotW1, Hyrule Warriors, Age of Calamity, Cadence of Hyrule, Link's Awakening remake, soon SkSw and BotW2) with two still coming so enjoy those for the time being.\n\n338\n\nkingbk\n\nI think there is still a chance two Zelda remaster packages come to the Switch (OOT/Majora's Mask in one, Twilight Princess/Wind Waker in the other). I'm don't completely believe that they have nothing else except the Game and Watch and Skyward Sword HD coming out for the anniversary. Nintendo is extremely strategic with their moves and likely are calculating how/when they can release more Zelda games without pulling focus away from Skyward Sword. I'm not counting out their releases, but it could be 2022 when we see them.\n\n339\n\nkingbk\n\nThe two games left for the Wii U I want on Switch are Xenoblade Chronicles X and Batman: Arkham Knight. That's it. Star Fox Zero I'd only want if they fixed the broken controller scheme and would let you just use the pro controller.\n\n340\n\nUltimateOtaku91\n\nNO. MORE. PORTS\n\n341\n\nOtoemetry\n\n@the_beaver yeah because all the other games have made the Switch already 😏\n\n342\n\nOtoemetry\n\n@roboshort anything done on the gamepad could easily be transferred into a menu, XCX already has a cavernous menu system so what difference would a map minigame make 😆\n\n343\n\nSerpenterror\n\n@UltimateOtaku91 We need more ports, nobody wants to waste time finding a freaking Wii U, PSP, and PS Vita to play these. All games on these systems should just be port to Switch.\n\n344\n\nUltimateOtaku91\n\n@Ghost_of_Hasashi and let them charge £60 again for years old games?\n\n345\n\nRoguePirate\n\nThe two Zelda games are all i ever wanted from the Wii U library.\n\n346\n\nPaulBizkit\n\nxenoblade chronicles x is the one we need.\n\n347\n\nMr_Zurkon\n\nI was really hoping for WW and TP for switch.\n\n348\n\nUnit_DTH\n\nXenoblade Chronicles X was a wonderful game! I would definitely double dip on that one.\n\n349\n\nHero-of-WiiU\n\nWii Sports Club and Wind Waker would be great! ZombiU was a neat game too that seems like a game that’ll be forgotten unfortunately.\n\nAlso maybe some sort of Wii fit u port would be nice surprised that wasn’t on here.\n\n350\n\nLony85\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD\n\nYoshi's Woolly World\n\nAre the three games from the Wii U, I'd still love to see get ported over to the Nintendo Switch. Having said that, I don't think Woolly World will ever be ported over, st least the Zelda games still have a chance.\n\n351\n\nHarvestGoddess\n\n@WesEds Xenoblade X would be nice. The series is absolutely captivating. I can't help but fall under its charm.\n\n352\n\ntadams587\n\nThe re-release of Golden Sun skipped both the Nintendo Switch & 3DS, for the Wii-U.\n\nI would love to play Twilight Princess HD on my Nintendo Switch, it would give my Wolf Link Amiibo more purpose.\n\n353\n\nVortexeo\n\nOne day Xenoblade Chronicles X....one day...\n\nIf I had to guess, I feel like the game would be ported over in 2022 (assuming they're actually gonna do it). I have this theory that 2022 will be very similar to 2017. BOTW, Splatoon 2, and Mario Rabbids all released in 2017. Now, all of those games are getting new titles in 2022. Since Xenoblade 2 was also a 2017 game....maybe....just maybe lol.\n\n354\n\nHarmonie\n\n@Priceless_Spork They'll repackage Switch Wii U ports, as well. And the staff and members of this site will be begging for it to happen even more.\n\n355\n\nbones\n\n@mesome713 3d world and bowser's fury is already on switch.\n\n356\n\nSalnax\n\n@bones That comment was from last year.\n\n357\n\nTakoSamurai\n\nI see that ever since the Switch launched, it kept on having Wii U ports come to the Switch. I believe why Nintendo does this because so many people missed the Wii U and did not have an interest in getting the console. In my opinion, the Wii U had so much potential, only if Nintendo did a better way of advertising the product.\n\n358\n\nTakoSamurai\n\nSo in addition, Nintendo is giving a chance for people who did not get Wii U games from not owning a Wii U.\n\n359\n\nChamver\n\nI have Xenoblade X, still in its original plastic, and I refuse to play it until I'm certain that Nintendo won't bring it over to Switch. I am still convinced that it will be a Super Switch launch title. Fingers crossed\n\n360\n\nroboshort\n\n@Otoemetry It could be transferred but the experience will suffer. I played the Witcher 3 after Xenoblade X and the experience was considerably worse not having the gamepad. Having a map in your hands is a godsend for open world games. Especially Xenoblade X where there is so much information and interaction with the map.\n\nDon’t get me wrong though, I do hope they port it and fix some of the issues with it.\n\n361\n\nsleepinglion\n\nZombi U?! Grabbed it on my PS4 last year for 5 bucks which means you can also play it on a PS5. Do that\n\n362\n\nBulborb\n\nBetter for your wallet to buy a WiiU and these games.\n\n363\n\nNerdyBoutKirby\n\nMy hope is that the lack of Kirby at E3 could mean a Kirby-themed direct is in the future. A direct would more likely than not contain more than one game, with a Rainbow Curse port possibly being one of announcements before the big game they've hyped up. With all the Kirby games HAL pumps out, sometimes up to three in a year, Rainbow Curse could happen. Here's hoping.\n\n364\n\nMorph\n\nThe two Zeldas and Xenoblade X will get ports and I'm fairly certain that will be it. Called Project Zero months ago as it seemed logical.\n\n365\n\nAtlanteanMan\n\nThe only two remaining Wii U titles I would care to see ported to Switch are Xenoblade Chronicles X and Wind Waker (the latter preferably as part of a 35th Anniversary compilation alongside Twilight Princess and whatever other Zelda games Nintendo might be willing to include). But I'm not holding my breath for either.\n\n366\n\nTheWingedAvenger\n\nI'd gladly take Twilight Princess, Wind Waker, Xenoblade X and Zombie U.\n\n367\n\nCodyMKW\n\nif ZombiU got ported it would be the downgraded port from Xbox and PS that removed multiplayer which was the best part of the game\n\n368\n\nDrJoson\n\nThanks for updating the article. Really looks like slim pickings now. Would like to see a revamped Star Fox Zero. Of course a new game would be better or even remasters of Assault or Adventures, but any Star Fox content on Switch is good\n\n369\n\nBuizel\n\nNo Sonic Boom?\n\nAt this point, I'm only really waiting for the Zeldas and Xenoblade Chronicles X from the list. Although I do hope for the latter that they make the UI look better in handheld mode than it did on the gamepad - the text was always way too small.\n\nYoshi's Woolly World would be great as well, especially if we don't see another new Yoshi game on the system. But that game's already received plenty of attention.\n\nThe biggest thing I'd like to see from the Wii U however is the virtual console. If they brought all of those games to Switch my Wii U would be nothing more than a HDMI-enabled Wii.\n\n370\n\nSmaggTheSmug\n\nNoooo, muh Wii U resell value will drop /s\n\n371\n\nLord\n\nNot interested in any of them.\n\nTho I’ll take a port of Muscle March from the Wii or a sequel\n\n372\n\nNic-Noc20th-C\n\nNintendoland\n\nDevils Third (which is great)!\n\nAnd Fatal Frame which is now being released multi platform. Hooray!!!!\n\n373\n\nRalek85\n\nXenoblade is the obvious one for me. It eventually ran out of Steam for me, the questing was a chore, but I did love the exploration and the mechs obviously. Not sure, but it might be my favourite of the series.\n\n374\n\nelectrolite77\n\nThe two Zelda, XCX and Yoshis Wooly World will get ports IMO. Not sure about anything else now, possibly Starfox I suppose.\n\nEdit : Colour Splash will I think. Forgot that.\n\n375\n\nOtoemetry\n\n@electrolite77 nah, after the terrible reaction to it at the time and the backlash with Origami King I think they'll leave it in the past. There's only so many terrible games a series can handle\n\n376\n\nRandomname19\n\n@Silly_G Yeah,Smooth Moves with current tech motion controls and HD rumble would have been nice.\n\n377\n\nDrJoson\n\n@Dethmunk I picked Starlink up and had a blast with it. Still need to go back to it actually. Would still be nice to have some of the lesser played Star Fox games available on modern platforms\n\n378\n\ne-love\n\nplease give us Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD that's all that we still need honestly\n\n379\n\nTSR3\n\n@Dethmunk I enjoyed Starlink too. I wonder if the Starlink team will appear as guest characters in the rumoured Star Fox racing game?\n\nAs for Star Fox Zero, I never got the Wii U, so in a way I'd love to see it ported. But I think a new free flying space game, with multiplay online action would be a better investment of Nintendo's time and money\n\n380\n\nTheFox\n\n@TSR3 Considered yourself blessed. Star Fox Zero was garbage. I'll admit, there were a few small parts that were fun, but overall, it was a mess of a game. It's only real saving grace was that Star Fox Guard came bundled in for free, and I loved that game! Unfortunately, Guard is one of the few games where it's really hard to see how you'd play it without the game pad.\n\n381\n\nBIG3\n\nThe two Zelda games will probably arrive sooner rather than later. If Star Fox Zero was given an overhaul that would make sense as well. As far as Xenoblade X, Monolith have previously stated it would be too much work to port it over, they would rather work on new games.\n\n382\n\nelectrolite77\n\n@Otoemetry\n\nI get what you mean, I know it wasn’t great. But the other side of that coin is a Paper Mario game being bad has never stopped them releasing it before 😉\n\n383\n\nDropDash\n\nI want the whole list to come to Switch. THE WHOLE LIST.\n\n384\n\nShiftyPapa\n\nIt's kind of weird that this is a list of games that supposedly have no chance of a Switch adaptation. I assumed I'd be reading about games that might come to Switch.\n\nSeriously though, I just want to play Ocarina of Time again. I would pay $100 for that game.\n\n385\n\nI-stopped-caring\n\nomfg, can't there be new games instead of ports that are full priced and make almost no changes?\n\n386\n\nMarioBrickLayer\n\nI would have thought the chances of Zelda WW and TP are higher than 6/10? Could they be the last WiiU ports we get?\n\n387\n\nTYRANACLES\n\nYeah wind waker and twilight princess miss ye so much. I’d love to swing the ball and chain again shattering ice and crushing darknuts on twilight and also sail thru the sea, enjoying the breeze, and feeding the gulls with an old pear on my head, only for things to turn stormy and find myself in a giant whirlpool facing a giant squid dead center! Those two game were magical.\n\n388\n\nAtariboy\n\nWhat's with some of these scores? Just how for instance have you concluded with your rating system that a game has a 2.62/10 likelihood of receiving a Switch port?\n\nPretty silly to be so exact on something so inexact as personal opinions, if you ask me. Why not a handful of basic categories like \"bet on it\", \"long shot but crazier things have happened\", \"probably not\", and \"not a prayer\" instead of these meaningless numbers.\n\n389\n\nsanderev\n\nJust Wind Waker for me, thank you.\n\n390\n\nCaolan114\n\nI stand by what I say every time this comes up\n\nStarFox Zero has potential to be the best game In the series but nobody can multi task with the gamepad aiming and tv flying, this Is not fun and this game deserves better\n\n391\n\nclianvXAi\n\nXenoblade x in summer will be a good idea, as we will get xeniblade 3 in autumn.\n\n392\n\nAnti-Matter\n\nAmiibo Festival DELUXE, please.\n\n393\n\nBomberman64\n\nI've probably written this already, but where is Affordable Space Adventures??\n\n394\n\nwestman98\n\nWind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD are probably the last of the Wii U ports on Switch.\n\n(...Though I could also see Nintendo opting to not port them to Switch, and instead remastering them for Switch 2 as early first year titles.)\n\n395\n\n1UP_MARIO\n\nNintendo should maybe wait abit and port the Zelda Windwaker/twilight to the switch 2. Sell us the switch games again on the switch 2\n\n396\n\nRes462\n\n@Bomberman64 is that a Nintendo published game? If not, it wouldn’t be on this list.\n\n397\n\nAtariboy\n\n@Res462 The list includes 3rd party titles.\n\n398\n\nBomberman64\n\n@Res462 No idea if Affordable Space Adventures is Nintendo published, but nowhere does it state in the article that that's a criterion. Sure it'd make it more likely to get ported, but I'd be surprised if Watch Dogs, Deus Ex etc are Nintendo published. You never know though.\n\n399\n\nPalaws\n\nI would love, amongst all those said, NfS Most Wanted. I really liked it on the Wii U\n\n400\n\nkoffing\n\nI am amazed how small the list is. Switch really has most of the Wii U content. I’d like to see Paper Mario 1000 year door in HD and the Zelda HD remakes. But it seems like Nintendo really needs to focus in producing new games for the Switch. Nintendo has been producing very few games since Covid started. I don’t blame them for that, but it means 3 years with a small number of games and updates and there is a lot of competition.\n\n401\n\nSoapMonki\n\n@Giygas_95 YES!! That is exactly what I came here for. Splinter Cell Blacklist is always overlooked but it's the only game I actually miss. I was hooked on those 4E wave missions, so tense, so addictive. This game has so much replay value.\n\n402\n\nJakedaArbok\n\nAt this point, the Zelda games and Xenoblade X are the only two feasible remasters. Everything else basically needs the Wii U to function, unless I’m missing something with some of the more serious games on this list.\n\n403\n\nGiygas_95\n\n@SoapMonki Wow, I wasn't expecting a reply seeing as I don't really come to this site anymore! I'd still love Blacklist, or even a Splinter Cell collection. With the Steam Deck coming though, I'm definitely looking forward to playing the Splinter Cell games on there.\n\n404\n\nRoam85\n\nAny one of these that you guys are saying won’t happen because of two screens…\n\nAll that needs is two switches linked to each other. A switch costs less than three extra pro controllers at retail (and comes with a set of joy cons and a spare dock, power, and hdmi cord)\n\n405\n\nBret\n\nList gets an update but this note about Watch Dogs 3 is still in there despite the game releasing in October, lol\n\n\"The second sequel to this game was supposed to have launched by now on other platforms, but it was delayed.\"\n\n406\n\nretroman64\n\nI just want the two Zelda games\n\n407\n\nRes462\n\n@Bomberman64 @Atariboy\n\nYeah, I glossed over those for some reason (probably because they seem unlikely).\n\nI guess I move on to the fact that those had standard retail releases.\n\n408\n\nroboshort\n\n@JakedaArbok I think Star Fox Zero could be made without the gamepad and Woolly World doesn’t need it at all. Not sure about Paper Mario. I hope they do give Star Fox Zero another chance\n\n409\n\nSoapMonki\n\n@Giygas_95 I was obsessively scrolling the comments in search for someone mentioning Splinter Cell ^^ Any Splinter Cell would be great for sure! I'll have to stick with Switch myself tho, can't afford a second console. Which is fine, but it does leave me wishing a lot ^^\n\n410\n\nBomberman64\n\n@Res462 In that case I can agree, although NL didn't specify that as a criterion, again. Not sure how much retail/eshop-only would matter though.\n\nMaybe NL considered Affordable Space Adventures as simply impossible due to the nature of the game. Might've been possible with two switches but that's quite the obstacle.\n\n411\n\nMando44646\n\nI'm more concerned with all the games lost on 3DS. We've gotten most of Wii U's bangers.\n\nGive us stuff like Samus Returns or any of the Fire Emblems or other big 3DS games\n\n412\n\nShambo\n\nXCX stays on top but remains from the underground\n\nX to the Z... Zelda, Zombi U, give them to me!\n\n(yes, I do have them already on all platforms, and yes, the Gamepad made the Wii U versions better)\n\n413\n\nShambo\n\n@SoapMonki I'll take any Splinter Cell fully handheld any day. I even played all the way through the GBA, DS, and 3DS versions of them, but 'any one any day fully handheld' means 'trilogy', Chaos Theory separately, or Blacklist... or a new one.\n\n-Lambert, when I think of Splinter Cell handheld, I think of a great port of Chaos Theory.\n\n-What do you mean? DS and 3DS had Chaos Theory.\n\n-I had enough Chaos Theory thrown at me in my time to tell you those weren't.\n\n(the original dialogue was about guerilla's using AK's, for anyone who doesn't know)\n\n414\n\nTroll_Decimator\n\nOnly 5/10 for Xenoblade X? I think there's a very good chance to see it on Switch. In contrast, Starfox Zero is unlikely to ever come to any other platform, it isn't like it's a high budget project anyways, they could make an entirely new Starfox that isn't tainted by the middling reception of Zero. NES Remix makes me sad because I really want it but I have to agree that it probably isn't happening.\n\n415\n\neltomo\n\nZelda's and XCX, they'll come.\n\n416\n\nHolyGeez03\n\nNES Remix seems like an easy one and would be perfect for portable play.\n\nIt could even be accessible via Online subscription... or purchased as a stand-alone download like the recent DLC.\n\n417\n\nNintendoDad\n\nWe had a Wii U. So I probably wouldn't buy any of the games because we have already played a lot of the games we wanted. But it is a shame to have games like Yoshi's Wooly World trapped on a console that no one is going to be able to buy new or even used (at a reasonable price). My big want is Nintendo Land. That is the biggest reason we still have the Wii U. If they"
