        "text": "Walmart is offering the Nintendo Switch Lite (Timmy's and Tommy's Aloha Edition) console for only $159. This is an outstanding deal because this particular bundle also includes a digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. A standard Nintendo Switch Lite console with no game still costs $199.\n\nNintendo Switch Lite with Animal Crossing for $159\n\nThe Switch Lite retails for $100 less than the original Switch and $150 less than the Switch OLED. It is compatible with most Nintendo Switch games and it runs off the same hardware, so performance is identical. The three main tradeoffs of the Switch Lite is that (1) the controllers are not detachable, (2) the console can't be docked and played on a TV and (3) the display is smaller (5.5\" vs 6.2\" on Switch and 7\" on Switch OLED).\n\nIf you were intending to use the Switch solely as a handheld console, you might be better off just getting the Switch Lite. Even though the controls aren't detachable, the Switch Lite does support wireless Bluetooth, so you can always purchase another pair of Joy-Cons, a Switch Pro controller, or a compatible third party wireless Switch controller, and you can still play untethered.\n\nIf you enjoy cozy games like Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, or Minecraft, you'll probably love Animal Crossing. It's obvious that Nintendo put in a lot of love into this first party title and it's certainly one of the best - and most relaxing - games for the Nintendo Switch. This is an excellent pick for gamers of all ages, even children. Check out our glowing IGN review for more details.\n\nOther Nintendo Switch related sales and news that might interest you:"
