        "text": "After New Leaf has been out for a while, what are some changes you guys would like?\n\nWhat are some changes from City Folk that you guys want to be kept?\n\nPersonally I want the mayor thing to stick, but add more projects to do.\n\nAdd in the option to buy sidewalk, instead of us having to use designs to protect the grass.\n\nMore types of trees would be nice too, like Willow trees.\n\nKeep the great music from New Leaf. It sounds sooo good compared to City Folk's average soundtrack\n\nI want them to somehow make it so you can have multiple towns per one copy. One of my favorite things about the original Gamecube Animal Crossing was that each of my sisters had their own memory cards, and each of us had our own seperate towns. We would go into each others' towns all the time. With Wild World we all had our own DSes so we did something similar. With City Folk there was no feasible way for this to work unless we bought two more Wiis. In New Leaf they don't have 3DSes so they can't do this.\n\nFUN INTERACTIVE ITEMS TO FILL YOUR HOUSE WITH. Let me use the pinball machines or exercise equipment or musical instruments or whatever.\n\nINTEGRATE MY VIRTUAL CONSOLE COLLECTION. AC Gamecube had the awesome NES games. We don't get that any more because they want to sell them to us. If I've bought them, let me play them via my animal crossing in-game TV.\n\nGIVE RESIDENTS HOBBIES THAT I CAN USE TO INTERACT WITH THEM. Ties in with my first point. Maybe we start a band and open for KK or something. Maybe food/cooking becomes a game system with competitions and restaurants and stuff.\n\nLET US KEEP VACATION HOMES IN FRIENDS' TOWNS. I don't want an MMO, having my own little walled-garden to be silly in is fun, but multiplayer should still be a thing.\n\nMORE STUFF TO DO IN MULTIPLAYER. Silly little minigames and crap.\n\nELABORATE PUBLIC PARKS/ COUNTRYSIDE. Low-polygon Eye candy. Yes I'm weird.\n\nIt's completely selfish, but I want them to not make it. Just have a longer development time and put more features into the next handheld version, where it works better.\n\nMaybe release an HD version of New Leaf (using the models from their advertising, perhaps?)\n\nRegardless of what they do, I won't be buying it. It's a series that's way too easy to get burnt out on if you play every version, imo.\n\nFUN INTERACTIVE ITEMS TO FILL YOUR HOUSE WITH.

If they don't wanna integrate VC fine, but make stuff like pinball tables actually be real mini games you can play. I know there was the excuse given that the NES games distracted from the rest of the game, but nope that's dumb. Being able to take a break from doing town stuff by playing Balloon Fight was awesome. And it means I kept the game running longer instead of turning it off and on too. Not that important to handheld versions, but crazy useful for any theoretical console version\n\nAnd yeah, having more ways to interact with residents would be awesome, their shtick is probably the most played out part of the series for me"
