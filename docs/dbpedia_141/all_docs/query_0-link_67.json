Both of the games appear to be near completion so I wouldn't rule out another Animal Crossing game for the Wii U. I'd say the earliest we see is 2-3 years for an announcement/trailer.\n\nOf course there will be Animal Crossing U.\n\nI think that we will probably have some sort of announcement/big rumor about it by the end of next year. And then a release by the end of 2014.\n\n\"...A well written villain is a hero in his/her own world...\"\n\nI'll bet my money on it... However... where the heck is AC for the 3DS ;-;\n\ni hope it comes out i love animal crossing\n\nI love AC too ;-;\n\ni hope it comes out i love animal crossing\n\nThe 5th animal crossing...\n\nThat's a lot of items.\n\nI myself think it may come, I've noticed a chain. Japan version on N64, American Version on Gamecube, Wild World on DS, City Folk on Wii, and there is one coming out on 3DS in the first half of next year so...."
