        "text": "MagiCarbo\n\nBob-omb\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#1\n\nAfter the Super Nintendo, Nintendo's home consoles had a tendency to struggle with going out gracefully. Whether that be Nintendo shifting development resources to the next gen system very early, leaving the last few years pretty dry. The lack of substantial third party support that amplifies the problem. Or declining sales and user interest in these platforms compared to other consoles during their time. Nintendo's home gaming platforms have had pretty barren final years.\n\nBut, which one had the absolute driest twilight years?...\n\nWhile the Nintendo 64 was notorious for its lengthy game droughts that seemed to get worse as they went on, the console still had some notable bangers in 2000, such as Perfect Dark, Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, Banjo Tooie, and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. 2001 meanwhile had Paper Mario, Conker's Bad Fur Day and... uh... Dr. Mario 64? Yeah the N64 kind of faded out anti-climactically in 2001.\n\nThe Nintendo GameCube was at its lowest point in 2005. It's only real third party exclusive of the year, Resident Evil 4, was now only a timed exclusive (coming to PlayStation 2 later that Fall). Many big third party games that were comming to rival consoles, were now just skiping the GameCube, and Microsoft had kickstarted the next generation early with the launch of the Xbox 360. Meanwhile, besides some cult hits like Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Fire Emblem Path of Radiance, and Super Mario Strikers, Nintendo didn't really have much noteworthy for its troubled square. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was once again delayed, now comming to the then codenamed Revolution, and other Nintendo games that year were pretty mid (Star Fox Assault and Geist being the most notable examples). The only Nintendo games that came out in 2006 for the GameCube were Chibi-Robo, And Baiten Kaitos Origins... Yup.\n\nThe Wii in 2011 had seen much of its core audience flee to rival platforms including Xbox 360 thanks to Kinect, and especially smartphones and tablets. And besides The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and Kirby's Return to Dreamland, Nintendo offered pretty much nothing of interest to the remaining \"core gamer\" Wii owners. Especially frustraiting when there were games they could've released in North America. Operation Rainfall, the fabled fan-campain to preasure Nintendo of America to release three high quality Wii RPGs in the US. Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story, and Pandora's Tower. Thankfully 2012 saw the first two games release here, which also had Rhythm Heaven Fever and... That's basically it.\n\nThe Wii U was gasping for air in 2015. Some of Nintendo's worst games of all time headlined the Fall lineup with Mario Tennis Ultra Smash, Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival, and Devil's Third. Splatoon and Super Mario Maker finally showed the Wii U GamePad's potential, but by that point, it was too little, too late. Despite that, 2015 still had some solid games including Yoshi's Wooly World, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, and Xenoblade Chronicles X. 2016 however... Well, you had Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE... and Paper Mario Color Splash... and Star Fox Zero...\n\nFortunately, it seems like the Nintendo Switch is looking to break this curse thanks to inhereting Nintendo's handheld DNA. 2023 will go down as one of the Switch's greatest years. With games like Fire Emblem Engage, Pikmin 4, Advance Wars 1+2 ReBoot Camp, Metroid Prime Remastered, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Super Mario Bros. Wonder among others. And while the first half of 2024 was fairly heavy on the remake/remaster/DLC variety with games like Another Code Recollections, Splatoon 3 Side Order, Mario Vs.

Mario Tennis Ultra Smash was so clearly just shoved out the door in it's most basic functional form because they knew it could be used as a base for Aces.\n\nA lot of the really neat games around that time were either 3DS exclusive or were later ported to 3DS because they needed it to be on something that was actually making money.

The console's third-party support also pretty much dried up as Nintendo and partners' resources switched focus to the Wii U and 3DS, while every other major developer focused more on the HD twins. There were some games of note (Skyward Sword, Kirby's Return to Dream Land, Xenoblade), but the console basically got little to no support at all through all of 2012 outside of the Operation Rainfall trio in North America.\n\nThe Wii U's is right behind it, although it still had some notable releases in mid-late 2015 and 2016 (Yoshi's Woolly World, Xenoblade X in the West, TMS #FE, Zelda TPHD, Paper Mario) before ending with BOTW. This makes the Wii's probably worse though, since the Wii U was functionally dead by then while the Wii was extremely successful up through 2010.\n\nWednesday at 8:50 AM\n\n#27\n\nWiiU for sure. Mid 2015 to the release date of Switch were my \"the dark age\" of being a Nintendo fan. What made it worse that even the 3DS didn't get many games that caught my attention other than Majora's Mask 3D. It's the lowest point of Nintendo I've ever witnessed.\n\nAlthough retrospectively, Wii's twilight years are also bad.

It’s hard to quantify it but if you were reading forums and social media, the last few years of Wii U were miserable.

Paper Mario was born. Dr Mario 64 was ok. There were also decent iterations in Pokemon Stadium 2 and Mario Party 3. Nintendo largely cut off support for that system pretty quickly.\n\nGamecube in 2006 was a lot more dire. It was Chibi Robo, Odama, Baiten Kaitos: Origins, and then Twilight Princess.\n\nWii in 2012 was saved heavily by Xenoblade Chronicles. Outside of that, it was largely just re-releases.\n\nWii-U in its last year has an edge over the other systems when it comes to quantity. Nintendo published 9 games in the last 12 months for the system. Most of them were forgettable like Star Fox: Zero, but there were gems like Paper Mario: Color Splash. Also, a GOTG candidate in Breath of the Wild released on the system. That has to count for something.\n\nSo my vote is for the Gamecube. That last year was really rough for the system. At least the other three can say that they had one franchise building moment in their last year.\n\nWednesday at 11:00 AM\n\n#38\n\nIt's a hard question for me, simply case woo U had Botw, one of the best games.\n\nGC had many moved to Wii but still a passable lineup and TP.

Ultimately I think it's a good thing that these systems' last years tend to be quiet though.

The difference is that the Wii had a solid four year period where it was absolutely crushing it, and Nintendo (and others) were putting out certifiable megabits. Someone could pick up a Wii in 2011, and even if there wasn't that much on the horizon, there was an absurd library and back catalogue of banging games to get into.\n\nThe Wii U, on the other hand, never felt like it got off the ground.\n\nWednesday at 2:02 PM\n\n#41\n\nbeen there for all the end of life gens. the post SNES ones were all pretty bad tbh until Switch, but they really did feel progressively worse each time\n\nand the bleakness of 2016 Wii U was particularly palpable online\n\nI think part of that had to do with how the hopes some fans had for a potential Wii follow-up console alleviated, somewhat, that console's end of life drought period, the same way hopes for the \"Revolution\" calmed disappointments with Gamecube's final years, or the idea that Nintendo would be embracing a disc based console helped provide some real hope for what would come after the N64\n\nwhereas most folks online in 2016 just seemed to have no belief left whatsoever in Nintendo to actually turn things around with a follow up to the Wii U\n\nlike people were talking about potential new Nintendo consoles then the same way they do future Xbox consoles today\n\nand that's bleak bleak\n\nZeal543\n\nChain Chomp\n\nWednesday at 3:04 PM\n\n#42\n\nWii or wiiu\n\nIf it wasn't for the xenoblade games, I don't think there's anything I'd care for.

We bore witness to some of Nintendo's all-time worst games during that period that I don't think a few good titles can just counterbalance it. They should be taken as a whole, not just judged by their best or worst titles.\n\nWednesday at 7:06 PM\n\n#44\n\nDefinitely the Wii or Wii U, though both kind of went out with a nice bang with the two next big Zelda games.\n\nJust as OP said, Nintendo 64 went down swinging! The last 18 months had Banjo-Tooie, Majora’s Mask, Mario Party 3, Perfect Dark, Conker, Paper Mario. I think there’s a good argument to be had that it had the best twilight years for a console.\n\nGartooth\n\nUniversal Madness\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/him\n\nWednesday at 7:15 PM\n\n#45\n\nWii was the worst by far\n\nFor Wii U they had games rolling out consistently in 2015 and the first half of 2016 even though some of those games are garbage like Mario Tennis Ultra Smash and Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival. Second half of 2016 was a bad drought with only Color Splash though.\n\nWii on the other hand was a barren wasteland in 2011 and 2012 if you were a Nintendo fan in North America in particular. The biggest new games drop was Skyward Sword and Return to Dreamland both in holiday 2011. Otherwise it was just empty, so empty in fact that a grass roots fan campaign in Operation Rainfall happened just so that we could get some games to play on the Wii. If Rainfall hadn't succeeded we would've had like nothing in 2012.\n\nLast edited: Wednesday at 7:23 PM\n\nammonite\n\nagent chieftain here\n\nPronouns\n\nShe/her\n\nWednesday at 7:25 PM\n\n#46\n\nThe upside of how slow Nintendo used to be bringing games to Europe means our final years were sometimes slightly better stacked. Paper Mario & Banjo Tooie came out in Europe after the US & Japan already had the GameCube. The Oracles games and Pokémon Crystal both came out six months after the GBA. The GameCube only got three new non-Twilight Princess games (Chibi Robo, Mario Strikers and Odama) in the 13 months before the Wii in the US. Europe also got Mario Party 7, Battalion Wars, Fire Emblem, Pokémon XD and Mario Baseball!\n\nThis is the only circumstances where this can be considered a win.\n\nXbro\n\nPiranha Plant\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nWednesday at 8:56 PM\n\n#47\n\nI think Wii U is winning because those years are still fresh in everyone's minds.
