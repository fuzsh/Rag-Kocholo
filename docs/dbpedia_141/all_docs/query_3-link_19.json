        "text": "This might has been asked many times, but I cannot find a straight answer.\n\nProblem statement: My 3 kids have been playing Animal crossing for a long time and keep fighting for the only console we have.\n\nSolution: I bought 2 other switch consoles\n\nIssue: How do I get to share their progress and get them to play on the same island on different console. I have a SDCard version of the game so I get they won't be able to play at the same time. Still, how can they share their progress between consoles?\n\nBonus point: Would it be easier if I had a digital version of the game?\n\n-Laurent.\n\n@Lorent Unfortunately, Animal Crossing New Horizons cannot be transferred to another console. And yes, it's disappointing. Nintendo did this to prevent hacking/cheating the game, but it's not a great excuse. (Nintendo says the ability to transfer ACNH progress to another console will come before the end of 2020, but no date has been announced.)\n\nHere's an official nintendo support page that confirms this.\n\nhttps://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a...\n\n\"Animal Crossing: New Horizons does not support the ability to transfer your save file from one Nintendo Switch system to another at this time. We currently plan on adding a save data transfer feature later in the year. Information on the feature and timing will be announced at a future time, so please check Nintendo.com for more details as they become available.\"\n\nAnd yes, you'll want to buy a copy of the game for each console. (The kids can share a game cartridge, but the caveat is, only one kid can play at a time. The game only works when inserted into the console.) Since game progress cannot be transferred to another console, the kids that get new consoles will have to start new Animal Crossing games."
