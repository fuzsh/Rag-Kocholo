        "text": "Animal Crossing is on Wii U! Well, sort of. Nintendo has announced Animal Crossing Plaza for Wii U, which is available to download off the eShop right now. Not a game, Plaza lets Animal Crossing fans interact with each other by posting status updates and screenshots to the hub. You'll be able to export content from New Leaf for 3DS into Plaza using the game's QR code system. It's essentially an Animal Crossing-themed version of WaraWara Plaza.\n\nThe service is free, but will only be available for \"a limited time.\" The service will be active until the end of 2014."
