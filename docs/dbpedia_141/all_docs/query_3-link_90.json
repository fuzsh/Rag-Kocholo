        "text": "A new game announced for PS5 and Xbox Series X brings Animal Crossing-style gameplay to those who don't have a Nintendo Switch. An NPD report revealed that Animal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the fastest-selling Nintendo games, but millions of people not on a Nintendo console haven't been able to enjoy it.\n\nWith a new announcement trailer, developer Soda Den and publisher Crytivo have announced Roots of Pacha, a co-op farming and life simulation game that is set in the Stone Age. The game will be released in 2021 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch, reports Gematsu. The official site suggests that it may come to PC before consoles, but that does mean that Roots of Pacha is one of few games confirmed for next-generation consoles.\n\nRELATED: Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town Is Getting a Switch Remake, Gameplay Trailer Revealed\n\nRoots of Pacha's gameplay is largely what fans would expect from Animal Crossing: New Horizons or Stardew Valley. There is fishing, mining, growing, and harvesting, and players will be able to craft tools for their characters to work with. Players can also make friends with human villagers and find their \"true love,\" says Soda Den.\n\nThe game will also feature co-op multiplayer as players can share resources, compete in fishing tournaments, and enjoy \"milestone multiplayer cutscenes.\" Up to four players will be able to play Roots of Pacha together which is fewer players than Animal Crossing: New Horizons support for eight players, but few are likely to be upset if it brings that sort of farm living gameplay to PlayStation and Xbox.\n\nRoots of Pacha will be released in 2021 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nMORE: 10 Games Like Stardew Valley You Need To Play"
