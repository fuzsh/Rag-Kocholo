        "text": "This is less of a rumor and more speculation but the video below from The Bit Block does make some good points. The Animal Crossing team has been working with the Wii U for quite some time evidenced by the release of the ‘Animal Crossing Plaza’ Wii U app. Additionally, Animal Crossing: New Leaf has been out for a year and the team charged with developing Animal Crossing has likely been working on a new project for quite some time already. Finally, during a recent Nintendo Minute, Kit and Krysta interviewed the Director and Producer about developing Animal Crossing: New Leaf.\n\nThat final piece could be completely coincidental since Animal Crossing: New Leaf released just prior to E3. But there are plenty of other signs that suggest that we could see Animal Crossing on Wii U sooner rather than later. Including the fact that all prior Animal Crossing games have alternated between console and handheld releases. Since New Leaf for 3DS was the last Animal Crossing game to be developed and released, then it would make sense that we should be seeing signs for Animal Crossing U sometime soon.\n\nDo you want to see Nintendo show of Animal Crossing for Wii U at E3? Would you rather Nintendo save an Animal Crossing Wii U announcement for a later Direct? Do you even want to play Animal Crossing on the Wii U (yes, we know stupid this sounds)? Let us know what you think in the comment section below!"
