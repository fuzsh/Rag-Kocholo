        "text": "Yahoo Life is committed to finding you the best products at the best prices. We may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Pricing and availability are subject to change.\n\nOver the past few months, the Nintendo Switch has been sold out practically everywhere—thanks to hardware shortages and shelter-in-place boredom. In fact, Nintendo plans to boost production of the home console to meet demand.\n\nWhile the Nintendo Switch is harder to come by than the ‘Ice Ice Outpost’ shortcut in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it is back in stock (Animal Crossing: New Horizons Edition) for $300 at Amazon!\n\nThis console is so popular, it has earned a flawless five-star rating from more than 27,700 reviewers.\n\nFun for everyone\n\nThe Nintendo Switch—Animal Crossing: New Horizons Edition sports a new pastel color scheme (the blue represents the water surrounding the island where the game takes place and the green refers to village store operator Tom Nook’s shirt). The back is decorated with Animal Crossing locations and characters too.\n\nThe console doesn’t actually come with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. However, the game is in stock at Amazon too.\n\nThis is the second version of Nintendo Switch, with better and brighter colors and a longer battery life. It’s still one of the best consoles out there, thanks to its wide range of exclusive games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Fire Emblem Warriors, Super Mario Maker 2 and much more. It comes with two ‘Joy-Con’ controllers on each side—they can be used separately or together as a unit.\n\nTrust us, the Nintendo Switch is a blast for people of all ages—not just kids!\n\n“This Switch is so cute and I honestly can’t wait to play Animal Crossing on this,” shared a delighted gamer. “The design on this Switch is so beautiful and Nintendo did a good job on the color scheme and everything! Hopefully this Switch keeps restocking so that everyone can get the chance to have their hands on this beauty.”\n\nGaming on the go\n\nThe Nintendo Switch is the only home console that doubles as a portable handheld video game system. That’s right! You can take it out of its dock to play your favorite Nintendo games on the go with the same video quality as on your TV.\n\nAnd with up to nine hours of battery life per charge—compared to the regular Switch’s five hours—the Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing New Horizons Edition can be played just about anywhere.\n\n“The battery life is amazing,” raved a satisfied shopper. “If you're like me and you play your Switch an hour a day, it will last for a couple of days. If you're the type who plays your Switch for hours, you can get up to 9 hours of play, depending on the game.”\n\nIn short, the Nintendo Switch is one of the best home consoles you can get your hands on right now...when it’s in stock. Luckily, Amazon has it available and ready to ship, but it’ll likely sell out again fast.\n\n“Fantastic console,” added another five-star reviewer. “Nintendo truly knows how to design a solid gaming console. What I love about the Switch is the games are actually full length instead of the shorter and more casual games.”\n\nIf you’re looking for something smaller, the Nintendo Switch Lite is also available—for $200 at Amazon. It comes in coral, yellow and gray.\n\nNeed some games to play? Check out these Nintendo Switch games on sale:\n\nCarnival Games, $15 (was $40), amazon.com\n\nNew Super Mario Bros.
