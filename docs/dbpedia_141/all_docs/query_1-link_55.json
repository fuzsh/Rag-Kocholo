        "text": "Have you go to the city where you are matched up with other villagers as you go about shopping. Play up the community aspect.\n\nIn general though shorten the insane amount of time some things require and soften the daily limits on things.\n\nGive players a phone with which to check what they already have received, whether it can be purchased and if they currently have it in it's possession.\n\nGood idea with pairing you up with other villagers as you shop. I actually enjoy doing \"real-world\" things on Animal Crossing. Compared to shopping in real-life with annoying and rude people, I'd rather shop there instead.\n\nTOOLS SHOULDN'T TAKE UP INVENTORY SLOTS.\n\nYes, yes, yesssss!!!!!!\n\nAlso wouldn't mind some crafting if possible, I mean you cut down a tree, you can use tree to make stuff for your house if you want.\n\nThis is actually great! I was thinking the same thing as I played Fantasy Life. I enjoyed the different jobs in that game, mining, carpentry, blacksmith, etc. Animal Crossing would benefit from that kid of system. All the animals can have their own particular jobs, where you can visit, I dunno, get a discount from your roommate Tom Nook, lol lol\n\nI want them to change things up enough so that it doesn't feel like a console port of New Leaf, which is ultimately how I felt about City Folk coming from Wild World. I do think Animal Crossing works best on a portable, but regardless of that, if there is to be another console entry, I think it needs to feel innovative enough so as not to suffer from formula fatigue.\n\nErrands that go a bit further or require a bit more work could definitely add a layer of depth to otherwise simple tasks. I also agree with making the game feel a bit more open. I don't think they should be afraid of adding more \"locations\", because I find I really like traveling in Animal Crossing, be it to someone else's town, the city, the main street, the island, etc. I'd love it even more if I could invite some villagers on a trip and travel to some location together.\n\nI'm not personally interested in visiting random strangers towns but I can see how it would be interesting to have such a feature. Although it might be difficult to achieve, it would ever neater if you could visit someone's town while they AREN'T online, and then have that person see the (minor) effects of your visit the next time they play.\n\nIt would also be interesting to see more varied themes in regards to the type of town you could have. It would be fun if you could choose to have your town start off or develop differently, such that it resembles a different locale, like an urbanized area, or a traditional Asian themed area, a tropical area, I dunno.\n\nI don't know if it's crossing the \"strange\" boundary or not, but I think it'd be cool if you could have sleepovers with other villagers, so you could invite them to stay at your place for a night, or they could invite you to their place. I'm not sure what you'd do though, I guess add mini-games or something and you could play them, or just let them wander your house all night lol. Maybe you could prank another sleeping villager somehow, I DON'T KNOW! I just want more interactions with the villagers aside from visiting them and doing tasks for them. Things like sleepovers or the trips I mentioned are just a few ideas.\n\nTruthfully, these are the sorts of things I'd like to see in the next Animal Crossing regardless of whether it's for portable or home consoles.\n\nI agree that Animal Crossing is better suited to a portable, but I don't see why there can't be a console version as well. I'm kind of tired of New Leaf right now and want to start over with a new game, but don't want to fully delete my 3DS town with ~300 hours into it. I'm itching for a new game and curious what a Wii U version could bring.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve with New Leaf is placing Public Works Projects. I can never get them exactly where I want them, and sometimes Isabelle will tell me it's too close to such and such when I'm really not. It would be nice if there was a grid system or something and you could see exactly where things can be placed and directly place them yourself.\n\nNew villagers moving in shouldn't be allowed to demolish paths. That's why I put paths down.\n\nI would like to see more variety/randomness in Villager personalities/dialogue. I started to lose interest in the game when I realized that every single Cranky villager would basically say the same things to me so it didn't really matter which ones I had (same with every other personality, etc.).\n\nBigger inventory.\n\nEdit: I would also like more variety in shops. I liked how there are 2 different police stations in New Leaf and you have to pick one. It would be awesome if there were different versions of stores/shopkeepers and they moved in and out just like villagers. Say your main street has 10 shop spaces, and different businesses moved in and out depending on how much traffic they get.\n\nTo be honest I'd be fine with New Leaf with substantially larger villages. At the very least 1.5 times bigger, to accommodate 15 villagers like the original game.\n\nIdeally there'd also be a more seamless online mode. For example, let me choose to open up my town to friends as I'm starting up the game, or even let me set it to always keep my town open, and make going between your own town and your friends' towns much more streamlined. Perhaps also let me set what level of \"rights\" guests have. From \"Tourist\" (can only talk with people and walk around) all the way to \"Deputy Mayor\" (can do anything the town owner can do) or something like that.\n\nEDIT: OH, BIG ONE. Home zoning. Make one of the objects you can place as a mayor be a \"house lot\". Have a minimum and maximum amount of lots, and let me place any amount within that range however I want. When no one is living on a lot, designate it with a \"Tips\" sign like in the older games.\n\nAll that and I'd be set, anything else would be icing.\n\nI agree that the portable version is great, but it's great for the game we currently have out now. If we want a much more immersive experience with way more side quests, extras such as jobs, moving from town to town, and other more complex functions, it need to be on a home console.\n\nI never got this notion of \"works best on handheld\".\n\nNo, they can work both ways, no need to withheld one over the other and I would wish Pokemon would get a console treatment sometime in the future. I really dislike this \"only on handheld\" thinking.\n\nOnline connectivity fixes whatever you may want from the handheld features. I know myself and others have never used streetpass and still enjoy Pokemon and Animal Crossing without them.\n\nIn fact, we gain much more with the Wii U's power over handheld. Sometimes I wish New Leaf didn't have the that horrid resolution. 60FPS would also make it that much more enjoyable for me.\n\nSo how come Pokemon isn't on a home console if the Wii U's power was THAT important? 0_0\n\nSeriously where were you guys when that kind of debate was going on? XD"
