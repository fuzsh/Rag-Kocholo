        "text": "I mean, i love AC:New Leaf. I want an HD Animal Crossing comming to Wii U, but idk. I don't think is going to be on Wii U 'till 2015\n\nThere more than likely will be. There was one on the GameCube and Wii, with the DS version releasing sometime between.\n\nIt's one of Nintendo's more recent top-sellers, so I would imagine they would do a Wii U entry at some point.\n\nDefinately, it will be a very important part for helping the console sell in Japan. Wouldn't doubt if we see another as early as spring 2015 for Japanese release.\n\nSeems likely, but I wont be getting it.\n\nI love portability New Leaf has.\n\nyeah there will be but I rather have something handheld like New leaf. I can just go anywhere with my 3DS.\n\nOf course, but I doubt it will follow up on the success of New Leaf. Just remember City Folk. It was a very poorly done AC game that couldn't even hold a candle as a sequel to the DS's Wild World (and it had nothing at all to do with portability). It also didn't sell very well.\n\nPerhaps they might change things up and try to make Animal Crossing U something special. But I won't be surprised if it just comes out as a watered down New Leaf with some game-spoiling gimmick (like the city in City Folk).\n\nEdited by Envy, 10 December 2013 - 12:44 PM.\n\nno, it is better designed for mobile gaming or on the go gaming.\n\ni think new leaf is great, but i wouldn't play it if it was on the home console.\n\nI didn't feel City Folk was worse then Wild World. I just felt like it added nothing new to the game. One thing about City Folk is that, it made AC feel like there is more then just your town with the addition of the city which I liked a lot. I think there is a lot of unique possibilities with the Wii U gamepad so I hope they explore them.\n\nYeah I'm feeling like Animal Crossing Wii U will:\n\n- Come after Animal Crossing Plaza closes\n\n- Have intergration with New Leak (To replace Plaza)\n\n- Feature multiple smaller jobs (Coffee, ect)\n\n- Will feature your town and a city (department store, movie theater that shows nintendo trailers, )\n\n- Pets, like chainchomp or maybe even just a small cat I guess if you want to be boring.\n\n- Bring back the little nintendo arcade games (Havent played new leaf, so idk)\n\n- More town changing features.\n\n- Make it big.\n\nYes. Animal Crossing has been on almost every Nintendo platform since the 64/Gamecube. This is almost like asking if a Mario or Zelda game is going to come out on the Wii U.\n\nI'd say yes, but they'll probably change up the formula even more.\n\nLand expansions for your town maybe? Could make being mayor much more interesting.\n\nAnd I'd expect some kind of online. Seamless online would be best, with a hub world that all of your friends share like the city in city folk, except you can see all of your friends when they're in that area and talk to them etc.\n\nSome kind of DLC (groan) way after its launch that will make the game have even longer longevity.\n\nA demo.\n\nLots of advertising (the Wii one had heaps where I am).\n\nI hope they won't be any. Animal Crossing is a game best played on a handheld in my opinion. I can't imagine playing something that casual on a home console."
