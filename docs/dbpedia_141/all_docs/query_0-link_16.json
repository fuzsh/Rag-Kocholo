        "text": "After Smash and MK8, I think ACU is absolutely inevitable. Well, unless they've decided that AC works better on handhelds, but still, AC on Wii U would be a pretty great boon to the system. The series is hot right now!\n\nQuestion is, will it reveal at E3 2015 or maybe wait till 2016...\n\nWould love to have a new AC game on a home console; truth to be told, that's what I'm hoping for from the launch of the Wii U. And taking into consideration all the AC related stuff that happened lately (Villager in the SSB, DLC pack for MK8), it's very likely to happen, just as other users already said, so... keeping fingers crossed for the Animal Crossing U.\n\nI really hope we'll see this soon if not at this E3. I loved New Leaf but stopped playing after a while and all my original villagers and I just can't get into it again. I need some more Animal Crossing!"
