        "text": "There are many ways players can customize their Nintendo Switch to match their favorite games. For fans of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo offers a special Animal Crossing-themed Switch console. Bundles like this one allow fans access to different colored Joy-Con controllers, as well as docking stations decked out with official art. For Animal Crossing, this means a cute island theme to brighten up the basic Switch design, giving players the ability to show their Animal Crossing pride at home or on the go.\n\nOf all the games available on the Nintendo Switch, Animal Crossing is one of the best-selling to date. There is even a possibility New Horizons will unseat Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as number one in sales, in the coming months. Because of the game's popularity, getting the special Animal Crossing Switch bundle isn't easy. Players will want to call around to their local retail stores to see if the bundle is in stock, or potentially try to order online so that they have the best chance of obtaining the set while it's still available.\n\nRelated: Why Animal Crossing Needs Romance Options\n\nFans might expect the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch bundle to cost more than a standard Nintendo Switch, but its price lands at the usual $299.99 USD. Unfortunately for those who don't already have the game, this is because the special edition Switch doesn't come with Animal Crossing: New Horizons, nor any extra items. The good news is that fans of Animal Crossing looking for a new console won't have to pay extra for the special edition's purely cosmetic differences - if they can find it for its base price, that is.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons Has A Special Edition Switch Console\n\nBelow is a list of everything included in the Nintendo Switch - Animal Crossing: New Horizons Edition bundle, according to Nintendo's online store. Note that both the Dock and the Switch Console itself include unique designs, and the Joy-Con controllers and Wrist Straps come in unique colors.\n\nNintendo Switch Console\n\nPastel Green Joy-Con (Left)\n\nPastel Blue Joy-Con (Right)\n\nNintendo Switch Dock\n\n2 Joy-Con Wrist Straps\n\n1 Joy-Con Grip\n\n1 High-Speed HDMI Cable\n\n1 Nintendo Switch AC Adapter\n\nWhile the pastel Joy-Con will brighten up a player's console, the real treat comes in the artwork on the Switch Docking Station. The island edition has a brightly colored illustration of Tom, Timmy and Tommy Nook, standing on a tiny Animal Crossing island and waving a flag with the Animal Crossing leaf emblazoned on the front. The cute dock is a great way for fans of the series to play on their Animal Crossing: New Horizons islands in style.\n\nNext: Animal Crossing: Starting A New Island Makes Deleting Your Save Worth It"
