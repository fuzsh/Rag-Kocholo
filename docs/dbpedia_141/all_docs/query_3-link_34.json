        "text": "The choice between the best games consoles has never been better or more varied. While Sony's PlayStation 5 remains my recommendation for the best games console overall, due to its exclusive games, controller tech and UI, the Xbox Series X has gained ground with Xbox Game Pass, Nintendo Switch continues to be one of the best-selling consoles (its OLED model is fantastic) and Valve's Steam Deck takes PC gaming on the go.\n\nIn this guide to the best games console I share why I feel each deserves your attention. I've spent 25 years writing about video games, and have edited Official PlayStation Magazine and a number of Xbox magazines, and I think there's no better time for choice than right now - each console on my list has its own merits and uses, and I should know as I own most of them.\n\nIf you want more power than even Xbox Series X can offer then consider one of the best gaming laptops for the ultimate PC experience. Or if you want a hit of nostalgia, my guide of the best retro games consoles is worth reading. If you're keen on getting into game art and development, read our Unreal Engine 5 explainer. For now, however, let's take a look at the best game consoles I recommend.\n\nBest games console: quick list\n\nThe best games console in full\n\nBest games console overall\n\nThe best games console overall right now is PlayStation 5. Sony's console replaced PlayStation 4 in 2020 and though blighted by supply issues remains on course to be the all-time best selling games console.\n\nPS5 is a beast. The console supports 4K / 120fps gameplay. 3D audio boosts any game experience, too. The PS5 is whisper quiet as well, or though the disc can be loud as it pre-loads a game.\n\nIn my PS5 review I noted the secret weapon for Sony's console is the innovative DualSense controller, which delivers a one-off experience for gamers with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, reactive lighting, a touch pad and built in mic. The DualSense controller makes games feel unique. Better still, all its features are customisable and can be turned down or off. Discover the best PS5 controllers available now for more choice.\n\nThe best video games consoles live and die on their games, and PS5 has some of the best around. Exclusive PS5 games include God of War Ragnarök, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Horizon Forbidden West and Helldivers 2. PS5 owners who sign-up to Sony's PS Plus subscription service get monthly free games, free remastered games and for Premium members access to collections of free games.\n\nPlayStation 5 also comes in two versions, a standard model and the slightly cheaper PS5 Digital Edition, which foregoes the disc drive. Aside from lacking a Blu-ray drive the Digital Edition is the same, and as we move towards digital-only releases it's a good option to get a PS5 for a little less.\n\nBest value games console\n\nIt may surprise some that I've picked Xbox Series X as my best value games console. It's not the cheapest on my list and it's performance matches PS5 making it more of an investment than a Nintendo Switch OLED or Lite, but Xbox has Game Pass.\n\nXbox Game Pass is a revelation that has seen PS5 play catch up for years now. Essentially, for $14.99 / £10.99 a month you get thousands of Xbox games, including day one releases like Starfield and the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Hellblade 2. You also get classics from Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, as well as indie games, and picks from Ubisoft and EA's collections. In terms of value, there really is nothing like Game Pass right now, and Xbox Series X is the best way to make use of it.\n\nXbox Series X is also capable of 4K gameplay at high frame rates for some of the most graphically-impressive titles you can buy right now. So, again, on paper Xbox Series X should be top of my list. But in my Xbox Series X review I found this console, while great, lacks a controller like the DualSense and its UI design feels dated.\n\nIn its corner Xbox Series X is also a little cheaper than PS5. If price is an issue I'd also recommend the Xbox Series S in my also tested section, which is cheaper that Xbox Series X but also a little less powerful (but for now all games must be developed for both models). If you're after one of the best games consoles of all time with access to a library of amazing games, then Xbox Series X is a great option, it just lacks some of PlayStation 5's smarter features.\n\nBest handheld games console\n\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED is the revamped and updated edition of the Nintendo Switch (see the also tested section), one of the best selling consoles of all time. Internally the Switch OLED remains the same as the standard Switch, meaning it has an Nvidia Custom Tegra X1 processor and 4GB of RAM that delivers good game performance, but not on a par with PS5 or Xbox Series X.\n\nThe big change for the Switch OLED is the larger 7-inch display that delivers brighter whites and deeper blacks. The OLED screen is a thing of beauty that ensures playing Switch's library of games is punchier than before. There's an option to switch to standard mode if you prefer, which returns colours to the classic Switch levels.\n\nIt still displays at 720p and outputs at 1080p, which is a little disappointing as I would have liked a 4K output upgrade. It seems while Switch is a capable two-in-one console clearly it's handheld capabilities is where the OLED model shines. This model has a revised 'curvy' design making it nicer to hold for extended times, while the new 64GB internal storage means you can store more Switch games for your travels.\n\nSpeaking of games, this remains and has always been Nintendo's biggest strength. The Switch has a fantastic catalogue of some of the greatest games ever made, including Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Super Mario Odyssey (read my guide to the best Nintendo Switch games). There's a library of great indie games and a sub to Nintendo Online unlocks classic games from NES, SNES and Game Boy Color (highly recommended).\n\nBest PC games console\n\nValve's Steam Deck is the Holy Grail of handheld consoles – it enables you to play the latest PC games on the go. It's larger and heavier than a Nintendo Switch but crams in all sorts of high-spec features, such as a top-end custom AMD GPU and CPU for power, touch pads, gyro controls and more.\n\nThe idea is you can take your PC collection on the go, and with a classy 800p display (there is a new OLED model too) and supporting 30 and 60 frames per second the Valve Steam Deck performs well, though dedicated PC gamers may not like the downgrade. Yet, the handheld console supports over 3,000 games and more can be made to work with some effort.\n\nAnd here's the rub, Steam Deck is impressive and can run the latest and best PC games, including 2022's biggest hits like Elden Ring, yet games aren't made for Steam Deck, they simply run on Steam Deck. It's a subtle difference, as games made for Nintendo Switch are designed for its controls, while on Steam Deck you'll need to spend time figuring out control setups that work. Similarly, battery life can drain fast (two hours for a Triple-A game) unless you monitor and tweak each game's settings – Steam Deck is hardly plug-and-play.\n\nSteam Deck is also heavy and noisy, the fan really works overtime to cool this beast. Yet, it's a gaming PC in your hands and PC gamers will be used to the DIY nature of trouble-shooting game setups and controls.\n\nBest games console for kids\n\nNintendo Switch Lite, as the name suggests, is a lighter version of the Switch OLED higher up on my list. It's also cheaper and slightly smaller, which overall, and give Nintendo's catalogue family-friendly games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and other cosy games.\n\nSwitch Lite is essentially a version of the Switch, but it can't be docked and connected to a TV and has built-in Joy-Con controllers, so it can't play all of Nintendo's games, for example Mario Party won't run on Switch Lite. In its corner, however, the Switch Lite has a longer battery life.\n\nNintendo has been behind some of the best handheld consoles ever made, including the iconic Game Boy and dual-screen Nintendo DS, so it's no surprise that it has made a brilliant handheld console with the Switch Lite. If you want to enjoy Switch games with the whole family then the OLED model is ideal, but if you have a child who wants their own games console, and you need assurance it'll have age-appropriate games, then the Lite model is a great pick.\n\nBest retro games console\n\nThe Evercade EXP is, I believe, the best retro games console you can buy right now. It's not a mini replica like other retro consoles, for example the new Atari 400 Mini, and it's neither is it designed just to play older games, like the Atari 2600+. The Evercade EXP plays collections of classic games from the 8, 16 and 32-but eras as well as new indie games and modern retro-like game collections.\n\nThis wealth of games, often inexpensive with collections containing between six and eight games, is a great way into retro gaming. But the hardware is good too, the OLED screen makes every every retro game sing while the handheld design is comfortable and responsive. The Evercade EXP can be connected to a TV, so it's not just a handheld. The TATE mode is interesting - turning the console into a vertical system for classic shooters - but it can feel a little like a gimmick as the buttons are quite close together, as I noted in my Evercade EXP review.\n\nOverall the Evercade EXP is a perfect retro console and it's superb value for money; the console comes with 18 Capcom games pre-installed, including Final Fight, Ghouls ‘n Ghosts and Strider; and a special bundle comes with the IREM Arcade 1 collection, a cart of classic '80s arcade games, including R-Type.\n\nBest games console: also tested\n\nBest games console: how to choose\n\nWhen choosing a new games console you need to consider a number of things, including price and performance, but also never forget why you're buying a games console - it's for the games. I'd recommend considering the below factors when choosing a new games console, or one of the best gaming consoles on my list above.\n\nPerformance If you want the latest games that push graphics details, animation, audio and tech then you'll need to consider performance. In this case the best choices are between PS5 and Xbox Series X.\n\nDesign This matters more than you may think. A modern games console will likely sit in the living room and be a piece of tech furniture. For me, the choice is between PS5's sculpted aesthetic or Xbox Series X's clean block. Personally, I've become more appreciative of Xbox Series X's design since it launched, its simplicity is appealing.\n\nControllers While pure power is always great, Nintendo has proven how you play is often more important than the latest ray-traced effects. Two standouts here are PS5's DualSense controller, which offers impressive haptics and a comfortable design, and Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con that offer great immersion and interactivity - ideal for party games.\n\nUI design How you use the console is important, and can enhance the overall experience and connectivity to broader media and functions. Consider if you want the console to be a media player for movies and music as well as gaming.\n\nEcosystem This is a particular one for legacy gamers. If you've been playing Xbox for since the Xbox 360 then you'll have a catalogue of games to play in Xbox Series X, likewise, PlayStation gamers will have titles and rewards amassed. So consider if you want to start anew or make more of your collection.\n\nThe games This is HUGE. Games are the reason to own a games console, so consider the kinds of games you love and which console has the best ones; for example Nintendo's exclusives are usually more family orientated, Sony's focus on cinematic storytelling while Xbox generally has the best racing and action games.\n\nAccessories This isn't the most important but it's good to keep in mind. Does the console have a good selection of pro controllers, racing wheels or support for SSDs? It's worth noting only the PS5 supports VR, with the excellent PlayStation VR2.\n\nBest games console: how we test\n\nTo test and review the best games consoles on my list we spend time with each console to asses its performance, best features, games and design - often we return games consoles and write updated reviews to see if new UI and added features have improved the console.\n\nI personally own most of the consoles on this list, apart from the Steam Deck, so have made judgements based on my own experience of using each one. Where I've not had first-hand use of a games console I've referenced our own reviews as well as those of our sister site TechRadar.\n\nWe review and test games consoles under the conditions most people will experience if they buy one, with the console setup in a living room with a good HD TV. If a console has a handheld then we get out the house, often taking them on long trips or to the office and judge how well they performance in different circumstances, including connecting to WiFI. I also like to consider the weight and build of a handheld console, for example does it fit into a regular bag?\n\nTo test aspects like a handheld or controller's battery life we use the device on a full charge and let it run down; we then do the same again but in constant use and gauge how intensive a console may drain a battery.\n\nWe review plenty of gaming devices here on Creative Bloq, from consoles to retro replicas, laptops and smartphones, but make sure that only devices we have awarded three stars and above make it into our buying guides. You can read our full process for all products in our 'How we test and review' guide.\n\nBest games console: frequent questions\n\nWhich is best, Xbox or PlayStation?\n\nThe Xbox Series X and PS5 are close in power and performance, so they're really competing in terms of games lineups, where Sony just has the edge for the time being.\n\nPS5 has a large collection of games and exclusives, including God of War Ragnarok and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. PS Plus offers free monthly games and free collections (usually older titles).\n\nXbox Series X currently has fewer exclusive games but Game Pass offers free monthly titles, and unlike PS5 these are usually new games, like Starfield. This year could see Xbox Series X nudge ahead as new exclusives like Hellblade 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Avowed will only be playable on Series X and free day one with Game Pass.\n\nWhat is the best gaming console to ever exist?\n\nOh, this tough, and largely it comes down to where you grew up and what kind of games you like. My own personal list would be the one below, but I'm sure many people will disagree.\n\n1. PlayStation 2\n\n2. SNES\n\n3. PlayStation\n\n4. Nintendo Switch\n\n5. Xbox\n\n6. Sega Dreamcast\n\n7. Xbox 360\n\n8. Nintendo Wii\n\n9. Atari 2600\n\n10. Sega Mega Drive\n\nWhat is the best console for a family?\n\nNintendo Switch is the ideal games console for a family. It's mix of cosy games, party games and colourful Nintendo exclusives like Animal Crossing and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ensure you can play together.\n\nWhat age should a kid get a console?\n\nThe recommendation is three and upwards, but really it's best to avoid dedicated games consoles into a child is around five or six. The best games console for kids is Nintendo Switch, for older children who like to play solo then the Lite model is good. Teens will also prefer PlayStation 5, its brand can't be ignored and it has great exclusive games. Likewise, Xbox Series X is ideally for 13 and above, but its brand is perhaps not as 'cool' as PlayStation."
