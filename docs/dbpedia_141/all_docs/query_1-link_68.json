Original model PS1 about 74m. So those are probably #3-5, though order is uncertain.\n\nEDIT: Correction, a close #3 is probably original Wii. The version that ditched the GameCube ports showed up partway through the quarter Wii went from 89.36-94.97m, and the November/December part of that quarter is definitely heavier, so probably it was under 92m?

For example the lockdown added perhaps a few million sales, like it did for other consoles too, but is not very relevant for the hardware sales. Anyway Switch has still record sales for a console in its eight year.\n\nWhen a new Switch2 gets the new Zelda, 3D Mario, Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion, Kirby, Splatoon etc. and probably many new Nintendo IPs and probably even more third party games than the current Switch, it will sell as well as the current Switch, perhaps a few millions more or a few millions less.\n\nGoht\n\nMasked Mechanical Monster\n\nTuesday at 11:46 PM\n\n#170\n\nPersonally I would be surprised if Nintendo's next console didn't hit 100 million units. Even during the low-performing home console generations, their handhelds were selling well at the same time. The sales have always been there in one form or another. GBA and NDS were a little cheaper but not too much, adjusted for inflation. 3DS was more expensive.\n\nWhen you look at the numbers it's tough to argue the pandemic added more than 6-7 million units above baseline. There's a graphic on page 1 of this thread:\n\ngrobla123\n\nLike Like\n\nPronouns\n\nHim\n\nTuesday at 11:57 PM\n\n#171\n\n\"I definitely don't think it will sell even one-third of what Switch did\" unbelievably pessimistic, maybe bait level?\n\nA very broad comparison would be somewhere between ds to 3ds, 150 to 75m a 50% drop (big hit recent handheld, direct sequel, gimmick didn't sell) or so and the PS4 to PS5 (recent big hit console, direct sequel) which is largely flat. It probably wont even see a drop like 360's 86 to xbox one's 57 of 66% (this feels like worst case scenario territory already, so a third is just ludicrous). Not to mention the growing brand share of mind after the Mario Movie and multi media investment.\n\nI think Ps1>2 and 2>3 are very unlikely comparisons due to their very large swings. And we also aren't getting full repeat of the Wii to Wii U situation, given the Switch's install base isn't mostly fairweather and they would need to make multiple and expensive baffling mistakes to repeat a Wii U level failure.\n\nI'd be very confident in a 75-115% comparison to switch sales over an 8ish year life cycle. (Assuming a normal economic cycle, only a regularish sized recession and the usually recovery afterwards, I can't account for a lost decade in these assumptions).\n\nLinkstrikesback\n\nGerudo\n\nPronouns\n\nHe\n\nWednesday at 1:52 AM\n\n#172\n\nI doubt that it's an immutable law of the universe that Nintendo isn't allowed to have two successful pieces of hardware in a row, so it's really weird that we keep putting this on the list when theorizing how their next system could underperform.\n\nYep.\n\nGame boy to game boy advance to DS was just straight successes all the way. The only blip is the 3DS and that took an entire new market coming in to existence to even begin to affect them; and honestly, if anyone thinks the 3ds wasn't a success, it still outsold every Nintendo home console sans the Wii. This new market also completely obliterated their competition compared to Nintendo.\n\nNintendo handhelds have always been successful because they're the kings of the market, and as long as the switch successor can be played in handheld, it's going to be over 100m even in the worst case scenarios.\n\nAnd the switch is and always has had far more in common in every level with Nintendo handhelds than consoles, and even right out the gate, saw more use in handheld mode than docked.

The sweet spot for Nintendo handhelds with a full lifespan have always been 120m+ in sales, some very grave mistakes Nintendo made kept 3DS achieving that milestone. Switch sold that much as Nintendo learned from their mistakes.\n\nAlso effects of the lockdown on Switch is greatly exaggerated. It's a handheld, wouldn't be able to attract people locked in their houses. If anything, lockdown would have given home consoles a boost. Switch sold like a Nintendo handheld should with backed by much bigger system sellers than 3DS had. That, plus the power of indies. Switch being the home for them really did a number on sales.\n\nThe successor's main selling point is likely to be third party support parity. If Nintendo achieves, the successor will no longer be just a \"support system\" for many people. Having a complete handheld alternative to PS5 will put Nintendo whole another level of competition.\n\nit's sized like a steam deck competitor, and therefore both less portable and less appropriate for kids, in a sea of steam deck competitors with mainstream options from microsoft and sony on the way, with no fresh hook and epd on its hind foot in size as well as pipeline timing for many series\n\nAnd for that reason alone, I totally expect the Lite version of the successor will arrive faster than Switch. Hell maybe they'll even launch together, who knows. Nintendo will go harder on the portability factor and they can't do that for a Deck sized device. Even just a 20% size reduction would do wonders.\n\nRaccoon\n\nFox Brigade\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nWednesday at 3:56 AM\n\n#186\n\nI'm curious what makes you say this, I feel like the timing is right for a bunch of bigger franchises to return in 2025/2026 depending on how they want to structure the releases\n\ny'know this is a good point.

Additionally the Deck competitor Handheld PCs are non-factors in my opinion they are extremely niche products and we don't even know what and when Sony and Microsoft are going to do.

I think I would've been pretty annoyed at trying to fit the switch 2 in my backpack but kids these days probably don't carry books and binders as I did\n\nSized like a steam deck competitor? Not even sure this could be a thing? Size probably dont decide what device you \"compete\" against?\n\nthe competition is in what it's capable of. okay so these two things that take up the same space in a bag play games except one doesn't have steam games and is weaker (maybe not than the deck but some of its competitors).\n\nI'd concede that price will be a much bigger factor for most people and the handhelds that smoke switch 2 are also more expensive than I can imagine switch 2 being\n\nNo fresh hook? you dont know that. We know some stuff based on leaks and shipping details, but we dont know all the hooks or lack of.\n\nwe'd have heard about it by now. probably. maybe not if it's late 2025 though, idk. I know about the customs streaming chip thing but that's not fresh\n\nPipeline? You dont know that - I think it looks like many of the bigger franchises should be closing in honesty? Some absolute juggernaught franchises should release new entries within the first 1,5-2 years. AC, Smash, MK, 3D Mario, Pokemon. They're fine.\n\nAC I doubt but yeah I forgot about Mario Kart and Smash Bros somehow\n\nSounds like you've honestly just made up your mind on what to think even before we've seen the device or any games.\n\nthis part is definitely true. I've heard enough to know I won't like it, but I concede that my reasoning for why it could disappoint others is shaky and anecdotal. will an appreciable contingency of the market care about it being such a pain to travel with? none of us really know (though through market research Nintendo probably does, which is probably what led them to the size they went with anyway...)\n\nLast edited: Wednesday at 6:31 AM\n\nWednesday at 4:40 AM\n\n#193\n\nWhen I said PS5 was on decline and someone quoted me that I was spreading misinformation\n\nWednesday at 4:44 AM\n\n#194\n\nWhen I said PS5 was on decline and someone quoted me that I was spreading misinformation\n\nMore like \"wishing it into existence\".

And i'm being generous calling Shadow of the Erdtree a full game. (It's as big as some full standalone games though, and it's great.)\n\nI bet Sony (and MS for some part) are so freaking happy that Rockstar will drop GTA 6 \"soon enough\".\n\nPixelKnight\n\nObserving the process\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nWednesday at 4:47 AM\n\n#196\n\nHow so? Nintendo has had two 100M+ consoles (not including handhelds in this analysis, as they are less expensive and families would buy several, similar to Switch Lite, for their kids), and they have NEVER had a high-selling console be followed up with another high-selling console.\n\nEdit: Also, Nintendo sold the most Switch units (in US) during lockdown. There were some anomalies that led to its longevity, and those same anomalies will be why the adoption rate will likely be slow and limited.\n\nWhy is Switch counting as a console and not a handheld in this scenario? It’s both, it’s hybrid, and on top of that Switch Lite owners literally treat it as a handheld as it is one, let alone handheld players like me that upgraded from a 3DS to a Switch and have never taken the dock out of the box.\n\nThe Switch is the successor to the 3DS as much as the WiiU. Sure, it’s comparatively more expensive, but that hasn’t stopped it having the closest thing it’s sales match to being the DS while the software is sold at almost twice the price. At this point, the Switch is still considerably cheaper than dedicated home consoles, and there are families with multiple Switch Lites just as there used to be families with multiple Game Boys or DSs. I expect any new Nintendo system to similarly be hybrid and at least partially benefit from the success of the handheld line just as Switch has.\n\nnavierStokes\n\nBob-omb\n\nWednesday at 5:24 AM\n\n#197\n\nThe sooner shit like CoD ditches last gen, the better\n\nYup, I think pretty much the following games could be the big \"troublemakers\" for last gen\n\nFortnite\n\nCOD\n\nApex Legends\n\nGenshin Impact\n\nHonkai Star Rail\n\nGTA 5 online\n\nMinecraft\n\nRocket League\n\nRoblox\n\nAny sports related game\n\nJust a shit ton games\n\nJust a shit ton of things are still easily playable on those old boxes, which just keep it relevant.\n\nFirst party games are just a handful of the popular and best-selling IPs:\n\nSpider-Man: Miles Morales\n\nSackboy: A Big Adventure\n\nHorizon Forbidden West\n\nGran Turismo 7\n\nGod of War Ragnarok\n\nThe last one was released in 2022, 2 years so after that there hasn't been a single cross-gen game from Sony's first party studios afaik and the rest is pretty much carried by 3rd party releasing on last gen also .\n\nI think for the Switch successor it's going to be the same with certain first party titles also, but because the Switch was more constrained in some aspects to bring 8th generation games onto the platform, there'll be a lot more 3rd party games coming out for that device, which also brings the Nintendo-only audience, into an abundance of games that is new to them.\n\nOr you'd get the gacha handheld you always wanted instead of using your phone/tablet/laptop ....\n\nidk the sales of the box itself, that's a company problem, but I play all games on a console and don't look at the exclusives only .\n\nWednesday at 5:48 AM\n\n#198\n\nfail is a strong word but yeah I don't think this thing has much going for it in 2025\n\nit's sized like a steam deck competitor, and therefore both less portable and less appropriate for kids, in a sea of steam deck competitors with mainstream options from microsoft and sony on the way, with no fresh hook and epd on its hind foot in size as well as pipeline timing for many series\n\nit'll find its footing eventually but I think most would agree that this will be a contraction period for nintendo\n\nSwitch 2 may have a larger screen but there's no way it'll have the massive girth of a Steam Deck. An adult can get sore wrists holding that beast. Compared to the Deck it'll be a way more slimline design, like the Switch was.\n\nHajeman\n\nCasual gamers rules over hardcore gamers 😎\n\nPronouns\n\nHe\n\nWednesday at 6:17 AM\n\n#199\n\nBetween March 2020-March 2021, nearly 30 Million Switches were sold. It took nearly 2 years for Nintendo to sell its first 30 Million Switch consoles.\n\nThe momentum Switch had during COVID extended the consoles life cycle.\n\nYou also know right that several years after Covid 2020 many companies including Nintendo struggle to buy a parts. If not, they can have 30 million units end of March 2022 after that near 30 million units end of March 2021"
