        "text": "Got a Wii U yet? Been waiting until you can catch fish, dig up fossils and pay off a mortgage to a money grabbing raccoon on a Gamepad? Well Nintendo producer Hisashi Nogami might have accidentally confirmed the development of an Animal Crossing for Wii U.\n\nIn an interview with Engadget Nogami was asked when we'll see an AC title on the Wii U and instead of doing the right, PR-friendly thing and saying 'no comment', he said; \"Well, that's difficult for me to answer at the moment! Yup. That's pretty much all we can say.\" Would I be putting all my Bells in one basket if I guessed this meant an upcoming announcement?\n\nThe utter time sink of a series hasn't had an entry on Wii U yet and it feels like the perfect time after Animal Crossing New Leaf's success on 3DS in 2013. Nogami tried to save the potential situation by mentioning the upcoming Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer on 3DS and New 3DS. \"What I will say is that you may have seen an announcement recently about an Animal Crossing product coming out on the 3DS,\" he added. \"I can tack that on to the end of my response.\"\n\nHmm, I wonder what E3's Nintendo Direct will bring?"
