        "text": "Mendon - are you sure that's a Wii code and not a DS code?\n\nHere's my Wii Code for AC: City Folk:\n\nTown: Omaha\n\nName: Chelzie\n\nCode: 2707-5121-4562\n\nI have pears.\n\nThe code I put in in my first message was the Wii code for my console. I thought you had to register a friends console to exchange mail and such. I forgot to include my Animal Crossing Friend code to visit towns and such. An oversight on my part and Thanks for pointing that out.\n\nTown: Pixley\n\nName: Croniis\n\nCode: 3008 - 1603 - 8318\n\nI gave my original Wii console to my son since I wasn't using the Wii much at the time and he desperately wanted a Wii but couldn't find one. I now have another Wii and its console number was different from the number that was listed in the Master Wii Code List here.\n\nThe Master List has been updated with my new console number (Thanks to whomever did that... you are FAST!), but I'll put it here again since I want to make \"friends\" in Animal Crossing:\n\n3544 - 2826 - 2434 - 3977\n\nI guess I need to get busy and start entering codes from the Master List since I haven't done so for this replacement console.\n\nMendon\n\nEdited November 19, 2008 by Mendon\n\nI've added everyone in here to my list minus Figgler, but I'll get you added either later tonight or tomorrow.\n\nHere is my code for everyone:\n\nTown: Atlantis\n\nName: Crossbow\n\nFruit: Oranges\n\nAC FCode: 5069 - 7430 - 6029\n\nMy GF is playing now, but doesn't have the gate open. I'll tell her to open the gate up for a bit. Here is her code:\n\nTown: Atlantis\n\nName: Sweetpea\n\nFruit: Oranges\n\nAC FCode: 1032 - 4761 - 1079\n\nAs for the game itself. Simply put this version is the DS version on the big screen with Wii remote control. Same scrolling land effect, same characters far as I can tell etc. However, some things are much easier now. Like you don't have to wait for Nook to upgrade to a certain level on the shop to get hair styles. In addition, as long as your willing to pay, you can get different emotions everyday instead of waiting for Dr. Shrunk (sp?) to show up on the one day like he used to in the DS version.\n\nIn a nutshell this is the same AC we have played before especially on the DS. Only now it is much easier to meet and speak with all the characters in the game instead of waiting for them to visit on their respective days.\n\nAnother huge change that I haven't got to test yet, is that when other guests visit your town now on Wi-Fi, the animals actually stay milling about instead of hiding in their houses as they did in the DS version. This is more \"Realistic\" in terms of character AI.\n\nMushrooms are also present in this game and I don't recall them being in the game before. I also really really really like the new quick switching ability with your gear using the Wii remote control pad. Wish I had a slingshot already as I've seen at least 2 baloons fly over my town that I can't shoot down yet. At least the baloons seem to take forever to float across which gives you plenty of time to shoot them down.\n\nAnd I have to disagree with some who say the graphics aren't improved. They are in subtle but very nice ways. The textures are much better overall. The flowers and plants especially look good. I think there will be alot of time spent on this version. And this is coming from someone who still played his DS version nearly daily until I picked this up.\n\nSpeaking of which, how does one move their whole town over?! I was only able to move my character, not my town?!\n\nEdited November 21, 2008 by -^Cro§Bow^-\n\nYeah that's the standard code. Let me know if you have any luck connecting to anyone else as well. I had alot of difficulty connecting to Mario Kart Wii as well for the last few weeks. It gets really annoying.\n\nI called Nintendo last night about the error code and not being able to leave my town. Their first response was to just keep trying.....sigh.\n\nWhen I pressed the rep, he wanted me to go into my router and Wii and change all kinds of settings. I told him that my current setup works perfectly with all channels on the Wii (including playing Medal of Honor online); works perfectly with my PS3; works perfectly with my Xbox360; works perfectly with my PC; works perfectly with my media extender. Why should I change anything on my system since it seems that the problem with AC is with the settings on NWFC? The rep couldn't give me a answer other than I needed to change *MY* settings, so I told him Thank You and hung up.\n\n(NOTE: though I didn't resolve my problem, dealing with Nintendo customer service was not an unpleasant experience, and far, far better than dealing with MS or Sony.)\n\nI'll try a few more times over the next few days to see if I can leave my town or if anyone visits. But since everything else in my network works perfectly except for AC, I'm not going to go fooling around with my settings.\n\nMendon\n\nEdited November 20, 2008 by Mendon\n\nShannon..... saw your town open this morning and tried four times to visit over about a 30 min time period. I got a different message this time, something along the lines of \"For some strange reason, I did not get a response. Either the town is closed or you have been removed from that person's friend list\".\n\nNot sure what is going on but so far I am NOT impressed with NWFC.\n\nI have hearts next to the names of Shannon, Shannon's wife, and MrsMegaManFan. I've registered Figgler and Crossbow, also.\n\nCrossbow..... Nook's hasn't had a slingshot available for sale yet in my town. But then, I've Nook's hasn't had an axe for sale either. Every day, he has the net, shovel, and water can available, but no axe or slingshot. In fact, he only had the fishing pole available the first time I booted up the game and it hasn't been back since. I've seen the balloon going overhead every day but have no way of getting it either. And I have a bunch of tree's I need to remove but no axe.\n\nFinally got an invite to Redd's place and joined.\n\nMendon\n\nThat is odd.. as the Fishing pole is always available in Nook's store on my town. The net has only been available twice so far... and watering can has always been there.\n\nI'm betting the sligshot and axe won't become available until after Nook's first upgrade. Should happen automatically either when we buy X number of items or time.\n\nJust have to wait and see. There has to be a way to get these items. I even tried waiting on a higher cliff portion of my town for that balloon to come overhead, and the damn thing went up higher when it got that cliff!!! ugh...\n\nLast night I registered everyone on my FC list for AC. But none had hearts when I went to bed around midnight central time last night.\n\nI leave my Wii in wii-connect 24 mode. So I'm hoping I have some hearts next to some names when I get home later."
