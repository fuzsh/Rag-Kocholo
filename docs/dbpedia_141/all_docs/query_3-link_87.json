        "text": "Animal Crossing is a life simulation video game series developed and published by Nintendo. People play the role of a human character in the game and can explore spaces such as villages or islands that are inhabited by playful animals, whom they can interact with. There are few objectives they need to achieve in the game, instead the focus is on building towns, villages and ultimately communities in their own time.\n\nThe games are available on Nintendo gaming platforms such as Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Wii. Different versions of the game are also available on iOS and Android.\n\nPeople can play Animal Crossing games alone, in more recent games with friends that they are sharing a console with, or online with people they may or may not know personally (however this requires a subscription to the Nintendo Online Service). In doing this, players may have the option to voice or text chat with others. Players can also purchase Amiibo cards to unlock items and invite characters to visit their village or island.\n\nNintendo consoles e.g. Nintendo Switch offer parental controls features for Animal Crossing games. In addition, the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app allows parents to access further parental controls features. And ‘Nintendo Family Group’ enables parents to supervise their children’s Nintendo Accounts – this includes preventing purchases. More safety settings may be available on iOS and Android if these platforms are being used to play Animal Crossing games.\n\nhttps://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/"
