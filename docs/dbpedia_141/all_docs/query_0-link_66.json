        "text": "First of all - this is not a traditional Animal Crossing game. It is instead a spin-off, one that is primarily a board game with a collection of mini games. The basic board game is a very simple board game - easy to understand as a child. It is a fun board game, but not very repeatable because this is a text heavy game and the text starts to repeat. The replayability comes from the mini-games. There are 7 different mini-games and some of theme are much better than the board game. The most interesting, Island Escape, is a survival based game where your animal crossing characters must build tools and a boat so that they can escape. This package comes with two amiibo figures that normally retail for $13 and 3 amiibo cards that are normally in a pack at 6 cards for $6. That means this game comes with $29 dollars worth of stuff, and then you are paying just $31 for the game. I think that is a good deal, but if you are looking for a more complicated or involved game, this is not it.\n\nAnimal Crossing: Amiibo Festival Admittedly, this game surpassed my expectations. It is another Nintendo Party Game, in a board game style format. This is in the same vein as the Mario Party and Fortune Street. Unlike these games however, Amiibo Festival is much more relaxed and non-competitive. A single game lasts for a single month (roughly 30 rounds) of one's choosing and can take up to 45 minutes depending on the number of players. Each day (round), a new character comes in with a new event. The characters collect happiness points and money (bells) throughout the month. In the end, the character with the highest happiness amount wins. The money is converted in the end to happiness. Every week however, the game offers players the ability to participate in the \"Stalk Market\", where they can invest in turnips for a potential boost in money. I found that the optimized player can use this to hold an advantage. This added a fun aspect to the weekly games. All in all, the game does a good job of translating to a board game format, while keeping the Animal Crossing feel of the game. In addition to the main board game, there are other mini games to keep players occupied. I found the game to be fun, except for one incident when my younger brother landed on a space that forced him to forfeit his entire monetary savings into the sea. It completely ruined the game for him, and seemed uncharacteristic of the game in general. The board appears to stay the same shape and style. Other party games allow the player to change the map shape entirely. The only customization is the month you play, resulting in different activities and imagery (which does reflect Animal Crossing as a series). I personally prefer a party game with a little more action, change, and tension. The game does completely deliver as an Animal Crossing board game, retaining all aesthetic of the original game series and packaged with two nice looking Amiibo. They are both good, but the original designs of the characters really come through as amiibo. In addition the game is also packaged with three Amiibo cards. With new cards, the game features new hosts for the game and unlocks new games.\n\nThis game is the very definition of a video board game. The main game is essentially Life with an Animal Crossing twist. There is a nice meta-game involving turnips that gives the game an added layer of strategy. It's the perfect game to sit back and relax while trying to out score your opponent. Amiibos are used as game pieces and allow you to unlock additional outfits and emotes for your characters. If you don't have enough amiibos don't worry. Players can choose from a variety of villagers if they don't have an amiibo While the board game is the main feature there are a bunch of mini games that are played with cards. These games range from good to very poor but here are just an added bonus. It's a good deal for the price. You get the game, 2 amiibos (normally $13 a piece) and 3 amiibo cards. All in all its a great addition to family game night without the hassle of having all those pieces to clean up.\n\nAmiibo Festival is probably not going to win any awards or thrill many \"hardcore gamers\", but it does have it's appeal. For a family this is a perfect game to play with kids or older players. If you look at it for what it is, a board game in the Animal Crossing world on your tv, then it starts to make sense. No, it's not going to be very exciting, but it is going to be relaxing and might even make you smile, believe me we need more of that in the world these days. Don't let the nay-sayers scare you away, if you want a fun, cute, quirky, relaxing game that lets you kick back and just enjoy a moment by yourself or with loved ones then consider this one next time you are shopping for games.\n\nIf you are expecting a game like Animal Crossing, you are looking at the wrong thing. This is an animal crossing style party game for 1-4 players, in the style of Mario Party. However, unlike Mario Party, the mini-games are separate from the dice roll \"game play\" elements. You unlock mini games by playing the board game and earning Happy Points which accumulate cards in the minigame area. The happy points also allow your Amiibo character to have different clothes and expressions in the board game. (Only Animal Crossing amiibos work with this game). The game's theme is cute, but gets really repetitive especially as a 1-2 player, with 2 computer players in which 90% of the time their actions do not effect your character. The amiibos are super cute and detailled, and the special days in the boardgame are fun, as are the mini games. This is a game I can play with my young daughter as long as I read the screens to her. There is minimal strategy aspects to the board game with a great deal of luck. The minigames are more complex, especially the trivia. They require Animal Crossing cards, which 3 are included, but you will likely want more. For the amount of add-ons this game has in specialized amiibo figures and the collectible cards, the ongoing game play is a B-. I have Nintendo uses this as a jumping off point to make a Wii U Animal Crossing with similar game play as the original GameCube Animal Crossing.\n\nAnimal Crossing: Amiibo Festival, at its core, is a board game based on the Animal Crossing series which you can customize with villagers and public works projects. It also features multiple different minigames for you to mess around with, most of which are very boring, bland, and unappealing. The boardgame itself, in my opinion, was actually better than the other minigames but still was very shallow, lacking, and, at times, boring. The boardgame is essentially a version of The Game of Life, and while that may sound cool, it just isn't as fun as it sounds. You can choose which month in the year to play in (each with its own holidays/events), but each board is essentially the same thing. The game just doesn't provide much depth and only provides some short-lived fun. On top of this bland game, the only way to really play it is using amiibos (if you couldn't already tell by the title). You can't even enter the game without an Animal Crossing amiibo figure! At the very least, the game is bundled with two Animal Crossing amiibo figures, but if you want to play with more than 2 people, you'll need to buy another Animal Crossing amiibo. If you want to further customize your board and enjoy the other minigames, you'll also need to buy Animal Crossing amiibo cards seperately. Sure, the game comes with 3 of them, but 3 cards don't really provide much for you to mess around with in the game. While I found the game to be really bland, the amiibos that come with it are the main stars of the show! The Isabelle and Digby amiibos are very nice and detailed, and i'm also pretty happy with the 3 amiibo cards that came with the game! If you're not an Animal Crossing fan, you'll definitely not enjoy this game, but if you are an Animal Crossing fan (like me), you'll find some fun out of it. The amiibos that come with the game are the main reasons why anybody should want to purchase this bundle, but even at the $60 price tag, it still is pretty expensive. Unless you can find it on sale or lower the price with GCU, I would not recommend you paying $60 for this game."
