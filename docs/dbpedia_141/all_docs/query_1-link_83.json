Software is a bit ho-hum but not bad for hardware.\n\nTTYD destroyed the original's numbers just at release. guess it finally redeemed itself from being held back by the gamecube's poor sales.\n\nTTYD remake is under the original at some 100k and change, the opposite of what I'd call the definition of \"destroying\". It's alright for a remaster but no way is this an overperformance or anything. Sell through discrepancy is also large so this game is going to lurch if it hopes to hit 2M. A bit unimpressed by this one to be honest.\n\nJ_ToSaveTheDay\n\n\"This guy are sick\" and Corrupted by Vengeance\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n19,638\n\nUSA\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#12\n\nNintendo Switch changed the way that I prefer to play games. Hybrid approach has been extremely valuable to earning me additional playtime and the library of games that it's built out over the years is incredible. I'm stoked to see its success and think every bit of it is deserved.\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#13\n\nI'd imagine TotK surpasses Super Mario Party next quarter.\n\nAnd it seems like an inevitability that Switch will pass the DS and PS2 now.

The Switch 2 could release tomorrow and the Switch would still likely crawl to 155-160 mil.\n\nTrue. After this ongoing quarter it will be somewhere around 145 million and it will most likely end up a little bit over 150 million after the holidays and after that it just a matter of time when Nintendo and the retail around the world will start the clearance sales and the console will gain multiple millions with it's first proper prize drop.\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#16\n\nNice hardware sales. Portability is a boon. We have four Switch consoles in our household. That wouldn't happen with any traditional TV-shackled console.\n\nHilarious_Bearious\n\nNov 4, 2017\n\n7,751\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#17\n\nOh wow, I thought the switch had dethroned The King™️ already? Oh well, seems it's just a matter of time unless they stop production before they hit it. It's not surprising really, the Switch is a well-realised concept for a hybrid console with a compelling library.\n\nRedDevil\n\nDec 25, 2017\n\n4,251\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#18\n\nAnd people were saying nobody wanted LM2HD...\n\nMung\n\nNov 2, 2017\n\n3,607\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#19\n\n2 million in this quarter at this stage of the console cycle is so good.

How is that not official?\n\nbitcloudrzr\n\nMay 31, 2018\n\n15,556\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#34\n\nIt came directly from the CEO. How is that not official?\n\nMentioned on the PS Blog podcast before retirement, and never followed up in any financial statements or official statement. I do not doubt that they manufactured and shipped that amount, but there is no update on Sony's official business data and sales documents as of 3/31/24.\n\nColdman\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n1,467\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#35\n\nI am somewhat surprised Wonder hasn't broken into the Top 10 yet.\n\nNeonep\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,967\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#36\n\nThe Switch has the beat catalog of games of any Nintendo console and is Top 3 all time with the PS4 & PS2.\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#37\n\nIf you look at the sales numbers in the PS2's final years, it'd be very unlikely to have reached 160, unless there was a major sudden increase in sales.\n\nCould be that they just had a bunch of extra stock out in the world after the end of the PS2 cycle and figured that they eventually sold in the many years after…?\n\nWhat was the lifetime sales of the PS2? Not 158m [Update: Between 159.2m and 161.9m]\n\nSo I saw this tweet just earlier: I went to take a look at the lifetime sales of the PS2 on Wikipedia. On this page it says 155 million and the citations don't give that number. I went to this page that says 158 million, gives the same citations but it doesn't give that number. I then tried...\n\nlouris\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n423\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#38\n\nThis is end game Game Dev Tycoon\n\nDarkreaver\n\nFeb 16, 2024\n\n124\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#39\n\nWhat was the lifetime sales of the PS2?

Maybe they shipped that amount, but thats it.\n\nAlex840\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n5,249\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#40\n\nHmm, maybe this doesn't beat PS2 after all. It obviously all depends on how Nintendo decides to treat it after Switch 2 comes out, but going by past support, sales will probably drop off a cliff. (unless we have another 2DS XL situation and they launch another Switch model next year, but I doubt it)\n\nSt. Eam the 3rd\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nAug 18, 2022\n\n2,943\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#41\n\nWhat was the lifetime sales of the PS2?

Start sweating.\n\n155, 158 or 160 depending on who you ask.\n\n155m is the last official number, though the PS2 continued to sell for a year or two longer after that. 158m is what the internet has estimated the final sales are. 160m is the number Jim Ryan dropped at his retirement party, which may or may not have been precise (we don't really know).\n\nLast edited: Aug 2, 2024\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#43\n\nIt came directly from the CEO. How is that not official?\n\nBecause it's 5 Million more than the last reported numbers.\n\nIf the device sold an additional 5 Million after being discontinued, you'd think that would come up in one of the investor meetings.\n\nI think it's much more likely that he just rounded up the number.\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#44\n\nI am somewhat surprised Wonder hasn't broken into the Top 10 yet.\n\nThe fact that New Mario U is above it breaks my heart\n\nBlue_Toad507\n\nMay 25, 2021\n\n2,993\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#45\n\nI am somewhat surprised Wonder hasn't broken into the Top 10 yet.\n\nReleasing after NSBU makes it a difficult hill to climb over.\n\nLike, I'd 100% say Mario Party Superstars deserves to be above Super Mario Party, but the latter had the advantage of releasing far earlier in the Switch's lifespan.\n\nLinkStrikesBack\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n17,047\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#46\n\nHmm, maybe this doesn't beat PS2 after all.

I wouldn't read too much in to this one. If the following 2 with a new Zelda, a new mario and Luigi and a new mario party still don't, then yeah.\n\nRedDevil\n\nDec 25, 2017\n\n4,251\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#47\n\nThe fact that New Mario U is above it breaks my heart\n\nIt also came 4 and half years earlier. Wonder was like 13.4 million back in March, so I guess it'll get there eventually.\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#48\n\n155, 158 or 160 depending on who you ask.\n\n155m is the last official number, though the PS2 continued to sell for a year or two longer after that. 158m is what the internet has estimated final sales are. 160m is the number Jim Ryan dropped at his retirement party, which may or may not have been precise (we don't really know).\n\nRegardless if it will actually eclipse PS2 or not, I remember there was a general consensus for a long time that the PS2 was basically untouchable forever. The Switch proved that wrong.\n\nKimbou\n\nJan 22, 2021\n\n667\n\nAug 2, 2024\n\n#49\n\nI am somewhat surprised Wonder hasn't broken into the Top 10 yet.\n\nI wonder if it'll get there eventually. I feel like it's a game that sells steadily but barely misses the 1m/quarter to get consistent updates, until it gets to that top 10 status."
