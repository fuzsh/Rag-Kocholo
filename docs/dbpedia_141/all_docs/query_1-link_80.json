        "text": "This page contains Shader Cache sets to download for specific games\n\nA shader cache is a collection of GPU specific programs known as shaders that get stored in your computer's auxiliary memory for quick retrieval (as you play your game).\n\nModern consoles and their games make heavy use of precompiled shaders specific to their GPUs, and these shaders can't be run natively on PC hardware, so they need to be translated or recompiled. The simplest way to do this is to recompile them at runtime, but that's slow and can cause stuttering every time a new shader is loaded in the game. A mitigation to this stuttering is to compile the shaders asynchronously to the emulator, but this has its own drawback in that in the time it takes to compile the shader, the effect in-game that relies on it won't be shown.\n\nAnother approach is to cache the system's raw shader pipeline and then compile the shaders before the game even starts. The only drawback here is that someone has to play through the game atleast once to 'build' a cache that can be used by others. This page provides files to pre-built caches for seamless use while playing your games.\n\nWhen an emulator updates the way it handles shaders, it may break compatibility with previous shader caches; for this reason, the shader version is listed below.\n\nNote: Please compress your shader caches with 7-Zip or WinRAR before uploading them.\n\nCemu[edit]\n\nPut files in <cemuFolder>\\shaderCache\\transferable\\\n\nNewer versions of Cemu leverage Vulkan 1.2 and asynchronous shaders in a way that it may be preferable on modern GPUs to use async shaders instead of a shader cache, so try enabling that before hunting for shader caches. The current shader version is 150, but Cemu is backward-compatible from version 149 (Cemu version 1.7.0, 2017/05/16) Cemu 1.25.0+ is not backward-compatible with any prior transferable cache.\n\nGame Link(s) Shader Version Shader Count Notes Bayonetta 2 Download 149 1210 Captain Toad Treasure Tracker Download 149 2146 Devil's Third Download 149 4421 Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze Download 149 1950 Fast Racing NEO Download 149 1776 Fatal Frame 5 Download 149 1023 Hyrule Warriors Download 149 1222 Kirby and the Rainbow Curse Download 149 3004 Mario Kart 8 Download 149 12029 Mario Party 10 Download 149 1235 Mario Tennis Download 149 1230 New Super Mario Bros.
