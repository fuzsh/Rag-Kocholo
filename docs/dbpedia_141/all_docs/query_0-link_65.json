        "text": "Dec 5, 2015\n\n#1\n\nTheBitBlock just launched a new Make Believe series where they reimagine existing Nintendo series in new ways. First up is a pretty amazing first episode on how Animal Crossing might look & play if it came to the Wii U, with more Animal Crossing episodes to come. The detail here is amazing, featuring custom models, textures, and music.\n\nEpisode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt1LHFlBO6M\n\nCheck it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt1LHFlBO6M, with more parts apparently coming soon\n\njon bones\n\nhot hot hanuman-on-man action\n\nMrV4ltor\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#3\n\nThis is actually really well made! Cool ideas all around too!\n\nxxracerxx\n\nDon't worry, I'll vouch for them.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#4\n\nThat blur, take it out and it would look amazing.\n\npastrami\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#6\n\nThat blur, take it out and it would look amazing.\n\nI wonder if they were trying to go for a tilt-shift effect but ended up with this blur vignette.\n\nDeaviL\n\nBanned\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#7\n\nThis is what an Animal Crossing Wii U game would look like...\n\nIf Nintendo had one.\n\ndampflokfreund\n\nBanned\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#8\n\nIf your fans are doing it better than yourself as a big company you know you are doing something wrong.\n\nTruly, Nintendo were never in worse conditions.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#10\n\nMario Kart 8 Animal Crossing track looks great, I'd love if an entire game like that was made. But alas...\n\nbobbychalkers\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#11\n\nInstead we get two spinoffs a few months apart. I will be salty about that until the Wii U successor rolls around\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#12\n\nInstead we get two spinoffs a few months apart. I will be salty about that until the Wii U successor rolls around\n\n$10 says it skips the Wii U and goes straight to NX\n\njnWake\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#13\n\nNext Animal Crossing should be on NX. I don't think there's much point in putting one in Wii U really. It'd be a good launch/near-launch title too.\n\nNeiteio\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#14\n\nThis was incredible. Someone gif the different landscape shots (like the town at night, or Town Hall at New Year).\n\nHonestly, this seems like something that could land you a job at Nintendo.\n\nThe toolbox and sticker/stationary ideas were also impressive. Wow.\n\nzma1013\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#15\n\nAnimal Crossing/Pokemon crossover guys, come on, it has to happen. Dude rolls in captures all the citizens of the town in Pokeballs and then makes them all fight each other to the death.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#16\n\nNintendo really needs to use some of these ideas for the next AC.\n\nBring back multi-layered towns and ditch the rolling log camera\n\nThe toolbox idea is genius!\n\nStationary & Stamps please.\n\nDrawing on maps is such a good idea\n\nNinjaCoachZ\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#17\n\nThat looks so beautiful uggghhhhh\n\nI'd really love a new, HD Animal Crossing on a home console ;_; The Plaza and Amiibo game were such teases and this pic isn't helping! Has it really been 10 years since I first laid eyes on Wild World...?\n\nMicH\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#18\n\nWow, that looks great. I really hope the next AC changes some things and adds a ton of new features. I really would have liked to see it on Wii U as the tablet could have offered some really useful stuff.\n\nNocturnowl\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#19\n\nWell they're more optimistic than I am, after City Folk I'd just be expecting a polished New Leaf which is pretty much Amiibo Festival visually speaking.\n\nBGBW\n\nMaturity, bitches.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#21\n\nWell I can't deny he put a lot of good effort into this, but this is just going to lead to a lot of disappointment.\n\nAlso hot air balloons and yet no mention of cloud gaming?\n\nLudovico\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#23\n\nBecause if there's any company we can look to for innovation, forward thinking, and online integration, it's Nintendo.\n\nI'd LOVE to have an Animal Crossing like this on NX, where I can play at home on the big screen and still easily take my tiny town with me wherever I go. Sadly, I'm not getting my hopes up.\n\nNeiteio\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#24\n\nWell they're more optimistic than I am, after City Folk I'd just be expecting a polished New Leaf which is pretty much Amiibo Festival visually speaking.\n\nIt's not what he's expecting. Josh is just showing the potential the series has on consoles.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#25\n\nIt's not what he's expecting. Josh is just showing the potential the series has on consoles.\n\nThis made me realize how much I want another console AC =/\n\nderwalde\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#26\n\nThe reason i bought a wiiu. Yeah my mistake, i know. Still salty as fuck. This was my last Nintendo console.\n\nSmackAttack\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#27\n\nThat blur, take it out and it would look amazing.\n\nI agree with this.\n\nTheCongressman1\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#28\n\nThis is the ultimate tease. And it's almost exactly what I would expect to see if this were real. Man, fantastic work here. I'm just so sad it's not real.\n\nantonz\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#29\n\nThy have good taste. Bob the Cat is amazing\n\nNeiteio\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#32\n\nSomeone needs to gif all of the landscape scenes. The moving footage looks even better.\n\nBGBW\n\nMaturity, bitches.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#33\n\nTo be honest I thought it was absolute twoddle. Not a single showing of Isabelle. A future Animal Crossing without her is not one worth having.\n\nPoyunch\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#34\n\nDid the dude make all the assets himself (besides the music and the stickers that he gave credit to) because the language he used made it seem like it was a more one-man effort. Like props to him if he really did do it alone but if not, I would have liked if he used \"we\" more often.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#35\n\nDid the dude make all the assets himself (besides the music and the stickers that he gave credit to) because the language he used made it seem like it was a more one-man effort.

He shouted out all the help he got at the end with the sticker designs and music.\n\nSeanR1221\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#38\n\nLooks amazing.\n\nAnd all we'll get is the amiibo festival festival.\n\nNeiteio\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#39\n\nDid the dude make all the assets himself (besides the music and the stickers that he gave credit to) because the language he used made it seem like it was a more one-man effort.

Do you really think a official Animal Crossing would look as beautiful as this on the Wii U? You are expecting too much. If all, this is what it would look like:\n\nJust add a little bloom here and there.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#42\n\nGuys, you should Nintendo know better by now.

It looks like a slightly prettier New Leaf.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#46\n\nGuys, you should Nintendo know better by now.

If all, this is what it would look like:\n\nJust add a little bloom here and there.\n\nHah, what a hit. You have it spot on, though.\n\nGive up the Wii U AC dream, people. This is pretty much a portable-first franchise these days anyway. Nintendo missed a major trick by not making New Leaf cross-compatible with Wii U so we could switch between handheld and console whenever, playing the same game. Might need cloud saves though. Maybe next gen.\n\ndoop_\n\nBanned\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#47\n\nI am not kidding when i say Nintendo should hire him, in would have preferred lighter green plants though. Stillnamazing, the sticker ideas is more animal crossing than amiibo festival.\n\nBGBW\n\nMaturity, bitches.\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#48\n\nBecause he can envision a better Animal Crossing than they can\n\nThis reminds me too much of Project M talk where a handful of neat ideas from an individual suddenly means they are the messiah of games and the development team should bow to their wisdom. Please.\n\njblank83\n\nMember\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\n#49\n\nGuys, you should Nintendo know better by now. Do you really think a official Animal Crossing would look as beautiful as this on the Wii U?
