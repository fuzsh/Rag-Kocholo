        "text": "Today’s Nintendo Direct broadcast kicked off with some new footage of Sonic: Lost World, while revealing that both Wii U and Nintendo 3DS versions can communicate with each other, with the 3DS player able to create and then control RC vehicles on the Wii U version, which seems very impressive. Both versions of the game will release on October 18th.\n\nMoving onto Rayman Legends, Iwata reiterated the GamePad features of the title and announced exclusive Mario and Luigi costumes for Rayman and Globox, though didn’t really share anything else that we hadn’t already heard about the game.\n\nNext up was Zelda. First A Link Between Worlds, which will feature an alternate world, signified by the dark Triforce in the logo. It was also revealed that while it features a similar world, it’s actually set quite a long time after A Link to the Past, so it’s not a direct sequel and will feature a different incarnation of Link. The game will release this November.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s still no new difficulty level for The Wind Waker like we were hoping for, but there will be a fine-tuned Triforce quest, faster sailing and other new features which we covered in our preview. They also announced that the game will release in the UK on October 4th – that’s less than two months away!\n\nIn a very unsurprising announcement, Luigi will be coming to Super Smash Bros. Wii U and 3DS when it releases next year.\n\nAnimal Crossing will be coming to Wii U, but not in the form of a new game. Instead, there’ll be a Miiverse community added for players to discuss the 3DS game and everything about Animal Crossing, along with a Plaza which features returning characters from the game, where you can share images and messages.\n\nThere will also be a new recommendation scheme, where if you’ve already bought Animal Crossing: New Leaf and register it on Club Nintendo before September 7th, then you’ll get a recommendation code which you can give to any friend that registers their system between August 7th and October 7th in order for them to receive a free copy of the game.\n\nWhile there was no information shared about the upcoming Pokémon X & Y, they did reveal that Pokémon Rumble U would be coming to the Wii U eShop on August 15th. The game is another entry into the Rumble series (which hasn’t had a very good track record) and features 649 playable toy versions of Pokémon to be found and to battle in realtime action. There will also be passwords sent out on Facebook, twitter and such which will unlock shiny versions and rare formes of Pokémon, unobtainable in the game.\n\nBefore moving onto indie games, Nintendo revealed that an impressive music sequencer named KORG MO1D would be coming to both 3DS and Wii U, alongside a new steampunk action platformer named Steam World Dig and re-release of Super Mario Bros. 2 on 3DS, which are available now.\n\nIt seems as though Nintendo have a really strong line-up of indie games coming to the Wii U: Cubemen 2, Festival of Magic, FORCED, Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams, Ittle Dew, Knytt Underground, March of War, Monkey Pirates, Nihilumbra, Pure Chess, Q.U.B.E. Director’s Cut, Scram Kitty and his Buddy on Rails, So Hungry, Squids Deluxe, Tengami, Teslagrad, TNT Racers and – finally – Wooden Sen’Sey will all be coming to the system soon – check them out in the video below.\n\nThey also confirmed release dates some boxed 3DS games, including Etrian Odyssey on August 30th, the new Shin Megami Tensei game – Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers – on September 13th and Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy on November 8th.\n\nFinally, Nintendo announced that Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney would be launching in Europe next year. A lot of release dates then, but not a lot of new stuff.\n\nThere will also be a Wonderful 101 focused Nintendo Direct on Friday at 4pm, but we’ll have a preview of the game up on late Thursday night."
