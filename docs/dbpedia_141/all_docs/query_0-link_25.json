        "text": "Create your own community and live the life you always dreamed of in Animal Crossing: Let’s Go to the City for Wii. The newest addition to the Animal Crossing series once again enables you to carve out your own slice of rural haven, but this time, you can expand your horizons by hopping on a bus and heading to the big city whenever you like!\n\nIn the idyllic town you create, you can live at your own pace. Head for clear waters to do a spot of fishing, explore your surroundings and dig for fossils or spend every waking moment decorating your dream home – it’s up to you. Whatever way you choose to live, you’re guaranteed to have fun getting to know the quirky creatures who inhabitant the town with you.\n\nOf course, if you want to live the life of luxury all year round, you’ll have to generate some money, known in the game as Bells. Thankfully, how you make the Bells to pay off your mortgage and buy all the cool items you want is up to you as well. Whether you busy yourself with collecting or creating items, you can sell your wares to business racoon extraordinaire Tom Nook at the village shop.\n\nOnce you’re ready for a change of pace, you can take the short ride to the city and enjoy a whole new Animal Crossing experience. From grandiose department store Gracie Grace to the Marquee Theatre, you’ll find plenty to see and do as you interact with new animals and acquire special items you can’t find in town. Instead of selling your creations to Tom Nook, you can put them up for bid in the city’s Auction House, or you can spend some Bells and try to get a good deal on something unique. Or maybe you’ll head to Shampoodle for a makeover and return back to your town looking like your Mii!\n\nAlso new to Animal Crossing on Wii is the ability to chat with friends via the new Wii Speak accessory. To chat it up with friends and family, all you have to do is visit another town via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection or invite someone to yours. Once you and up to three friends are in a village, you can natter to your heart’s content as you show each other around your lovingly created towns and go exploring together. Consider the Wii Speak accessory as sort of the centre of a conference call as it will pick up the voice of anyone in the room, meaning multiple people can join in the conversation, not just the player.\n\nOwners of the Nintendo DS game, Animal Crossing: Wild World, can feel instantly at home in their new town by importing some of their character data into the Wii game. They’ll also be able to take a catalogue of all the items they owned in the DS game to Tom Nook’s Wii shop so they can get their hands on these items easier this time around.\n\nThe ability to control all your actions using just the Wii Remote means it’s easy for anyone to get to grips with Animal Crossing: Let’s Go to the City. And with so much to see and do, everyone who plays will soon settle into the life they always wanted!\n\nBuild your own community from scratch and design every detail to your tastes – from the clothes you wear to what you grow in the garden.\n\nVisit the big city for a whole new Animal Crossing experience.\n\nJoin up to three friends in the towns they have created and chat to them via the new Wii Speak accessory.\n\nSend mail to your friends at the post office so they pick it up in their town next time they play.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nThis content is sold by Nintendo of Europe AG.
