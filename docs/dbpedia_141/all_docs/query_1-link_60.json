        "text": "I usually by my games at either Walmart or Amazon, and that's only if they got them on sale or at a good price like during Black Friday. I have bought a few from Limited Run Games like Shredder's Revenge, Samurai Shodown Collection and Dust but those were more for collecting purposes.\n\nMostly I just by digitally when they go on sale.\n\n@Spider-Kev I haven't done it in ages, but I used to call and have the store check its stock back in the 90s. Sometimes, stores would even set a copy aside for you. Surely that's still a thing?\n\nBut yeah, a three hour round trip is pretty rough.\n\nEdit: And to answer your original question, I've had good luck with eBay for DS and Wii games. They were popular systems, though, that sold lots of games. I'd imagine the numbers out there help keep the prices in check (for a good many of them, anyway).\n\nIâ€™m a regular at the local GameStop, luckily for me right on my ride home from work. I pick up most of my NA region games there, or else at VGP (Video Games Plus) in Canada. VGP offers reprints of out-of-stock games, and often Imports from Europe or Japan, too. Iâ€™ve had a few pleasant transactions with them. I havenâ€™t been going to Best Buy since they stopped carrying blu-rays and DVDs - their Switch section was always kind of bare, too. Every now and then Iâ€™ll pick up a game from Target or Walmart.\n\neBay also has pretty much everything you could want new and retro, where Iâ€™d say youâ€™ll find a mix of inflated and reasonable prices.\n\nJapanese imports Iâ€™ll get from Amazon JP or else Playasia. Iâ€™ve been fortunate thus far with all my shipments from Asia, and I love the preorder goodies like CDs, pins, clear files, etc that often accompany Japanese preorders.\n\nIâ€™m not sure if any of the above is helpful for you. I know if I had to drive 3hrs to GameStop, it certainly would not be worth the trip. Iâ€™d probably just resort to buying everything online. ðŸ˜‘\n\nI'm totally a normie in this regard I'm afraid. I usually just buy from Walmart, cause my local one usually has an excellent selection. Pretty much all the major first party stuff is there, plus big third party titles like Hogwarts Legacy and FC 24, and (relatively) smaller titles like cowabunga collection and Rayman Legends. Honestly, I enjoy looking just to see what they keep in stock. It's really interesting to see what games are considered \"Mainstream\" enough to be sold at a big retailer like that.\n\nJB Hi-Fi, mostly (an Australian electronics franchise).\n\nI also like to shop at Gamesmen, but it's a bit of a drive, but they're pretty much the only remaining family-owned vendor of new video games left in Australia (and have had some exclusive promotions from time to time). They also have a little \"museum\" at the back of the store showcasing pretty much every major Nintendo console (and variants thereof) as well as noteworthy games from decades gone by. I would highly recommend a visit to non-locals who happen to be in Sydney.\n\nIn Guernsey we have one gaming store and they aren't very well stocked so normally get them from Amazon as they also take the VAT off.\n\nNEVER get them from My Nintendo Store as they have no clue that they need to put a customs form on a package and it instantly gets sent back to their warehouse. So therefore all My Nintendo physical extras or exclusives I have to go to eBay and hope for an honest dealer.\n\nFor limited physicals I do rate Super Rare Games, but they have some random picks which I am not interested in. Limited Run, the postage is a bit of a killer and don't get me started on 1st Press Games. Seems like iam8bit has kind of given up on games and are mainly doing Vinyl, but their games normally follow up after a few months with an Amazon standard edition\n\n(US region) Since switch launch, I've usually bought physical games at my local Best Buy, because the two game stops by me are staffed & run by people that don't seem to repsect customers, seedy car salesmen types (I ask for a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, they are visibly stacked on the wall behind the counter, and they try to force me into buying something else. WHAT!? Just let me buy what I asked for. Is that so hard!?!?). Now, Best Buy USUALLY doesn't even put the games out on the shelf on release day, so I usually had to ask for a copy, if I didn't preorder - buy I preferred to give a local business my money, and it was still more pleasant than my Game Stops.\n\nI'm realizng, the last physical game I got was Tears of the Kingdom. And since then, Best Buy is getting out of physical games (their physical games shelves usually sit 95% empty, looking severly neglected). When Switch 2 launches, I guess I'll have to buy the next gen physical copies of 3D Mario, Mario Kart, Zelda at Target?\n\nWith Best Buy abandoning physical games, I imagine this will result in hurting their selling of console sales when the next gen Nintendo console launches. Does anyone want to buy a console from a local business that doesn't sell physical games? I don't. I guess we'll see how this pans out. I'm disappointed that the market for phsycal stores selling consoles and games continues to narrow. I prefer to give my money to local business, but that's looking less sustainable."
