        "text": "We recently participated in Sainsbury's Beauty Conference in Coventry, showcasing both our suncare and self tan offerings in a dedicated Bondi Sands stall. The beauty conference provided an invaluable opportunity to connect and engage with over 1000 Sainsbury retail and HQ team members from all over the UK, to help drive education of our innovative product ranges and equip Sainsburyâ€™s team members with expert knowledge to provide specialist advice to their customers. Our Technocolor range drew quite a crowd throughout the day, with the Bondi team handing out over 400 samples of Technocolor Body, while showcasing our Technocolor shade finder quiz and providing attendees further insight into the industry first range. Thank you to Sainsbury's for hosting such an inspiring event, and to all the dedicated team members who took the time to learn about our products. We look forward to continuing the partnership!\n\nSunscreen is an extremely important item, especially during the warmer months, not unlike food and water. Unfortunately, having access to sunscreen is a privilege that not everyone is afforded. While protecting skin is at our core, we are also big believers in protecting the health and well-being of those who need it most. We recently had the opportunity to play our part in bridging the gap by donating stock of our SPF hydra range to Foodbank Victoria to be distributed to those in need. We are very proud of our partnership with Foodbank and would like to take this opportunity to thank Foodbank for their dedication to providing support for the community.\n\nBondi Sands was proud to be the official SPF partner of this yearâ€™s Palmesus Festival, Norwayâ€™s premier beachside festival. Palmesus is a celebration of music and Summer, with festival goers coming from around the globe to enjoy the worldâ€™s biggest DJs in this iconic beachside location. The partnership included three activations on site to promote sun safety education and the importance of wearing SPF daily (regardless of the weather!), as well as handing out SPF samples to festival goers. At Bondi Sands, we are committed to promoting a culture of sun safety, and as official SPF sponsor, we were able to ensure everyone could stay protected (rain, hail or shine) while enjoying the music and entertainment on offer.\n\nThroughout June we celebrated Pride Month â€“ a special month dedicated to celebrating the LGBTQIA+ community worldwide and commemorating the Stonewall Riots of 1969. We celebrated with a series of events, a major highlight being the â€˜United Prideâ€™ Panel discussion featuring six panellists from across Kao Corporation, including our very own Milly Richards (she/her) and Tyler Velasquez (they/them). The panellists shared their personal journeys and discussed what pride means to them, how their identity has influenced their professional life and career choices and the importance of allyship. We also held a â€˜Pride Paloozaâ€™, which included an insightful and educational presentation by Archie Beetle (they/them) from Queer Town on various aspects of queer history, the current state of LGBTQIA+ mental health and wellbeing and contemporary issues facing LGBTQIA+ folk. At Bondi Sands, we celebrate diversity and encourage all of our team members to bring their true authentic selves to work each day. As we reflect on our Pride Month celebrations, we are truly inspired and proud of the support displayed by all of our teams, not just during Pride Month, but every day.\n\nWeâ€™re excited to share that Bondi Sands was recently awarded Top Retention Strategy in Yotpo's Customer Awards. Yotpo has been a Bondi Sands partner for the past three years and power our Retention Marketing platform that hosts our Loyalty Program, Reviews & SMS. The awards recognise the best in loyalty and retention programs across a range of industries and we are honoured to take out top spot against some tough competition. Ellie Dammery, our CRM & Loyalty Manager, accepted the award at the event last month, along with speaking on a panel for Channel Optimisation. Ellie spoke about how our Loyalty Program fits into our wider digital marketing mix whilst being a key community connection point with our most loyal customers. A huge congratulations to our Digital, eCommerce and Creative teams who have been working tirelessly on bringing our new loyalty program, Club Bondi Rewards, to our global community.\n\nBondi Sands recently attended the TikTok for Business Incubator Summit with other leading Australian Digital & eCommerce brands. TikTok shared their latest insights on global expansion, creative cheat codes across paid and organic and how to measure success. Our Acting Head of Digital & eCommerce, Chloe Clark represented Bondi Sands and was invited to speak on the panel â€˜Harnessing Growth on TikTokâ€™. Chloe shared how far Bondi Sands has come on TikTok in the last four years, including some creative examples of our current Technocolor Face campaign. A highlight for most attendees was hearing from Joe Brumm, the creator of Aussie cultural phenomenon Bluey. The story of creating Bluey was inspirational for all, as well as Joeâ€™s learnings around creativity and international success. Thank you to TikTok for being a valuable parter of Bondi Sands.\n\nHere at Bondi Sands, we believe that true wellness encompasses not only physical health but also mental and emotional balance. We understand the significance of taking time to pause, recharge, and prioritise self-care amidst our busy lives. In recognition of this, we hosted a number of rejuvenating activities for Mindful May to reflect on the importance of holistic well-being and provide opportunities for our teams to nurture their minds and bodies. Our very own Jelena Starcevic hosted an outdoors pilates class, the team at Radiant Sol Yoga held a Yin Yoga & Sound Healing session, and onsite shoulder massages were made available. Each experience was tailored to promote relaxation and mindfulness. While Mindful May is coming to a close, we will carry the spirit of mindfulness forward and continue to work together to cultivate a culture of well-being and positivity. #MindfulMay #WellnessAtWork\n\nLast month we debuted at Ulta Beauty's 2024 Field Leadership Beauty Expo, offering Ultaâ€™s beauty experts and self-tan enthusiasts a glimpse of the TECHNOVERSE at Orlandoâ€™s Orange County Convention Center. Featuring Technocolor 1 Hour Express Self Tan for Body, alongside an exclusive sneak peek of the all-new Technocolor Self Tanning Face Serum, we showcased our innovative approach to achieving the perfect natural glow. The unveiling of our revolutionary Technocolor Self Tanning Face Serum sparked excitement and anticipation, adding a new dimension to our product offering at Ulta in 2024. At Bondi Sands, we pride ourselves on being leaders in the sunless tanning market, catering to our broad range of consumers who seek high-quality and cutting-edge products. Launching Technocolor Body in 2023 and Face Serum in 2024 exclusively at Ulta for our US market, underscores our commitment to drive innovation in one of the fastest-emerging categories in the beauty industry. Our goal is to cultivate a newfound love for the brand among US beauty professionals, as we continue to pave the way for success in this growing market. Through our partnership with Ulta and their Field Leaders, we aim to collaborate with a community of industry leaders and respected beauty experts, and we deeply appreciate their ongoing support and passion for our brand. ðŸ©µ\n\nWe had the pleasure of welcoming honorary Kao Corporation guests to our Bondi Sands HQ in Melbourne. Yoshihiro Hasebe, CEO Kao Corporations and Satoru Tanaka, Kao Corporate Strategy, spent the day at Bondi HQ as part of their first business visit to Australia, alongside Karen Frank, President - Consumer Care Business AEMEA & President Kao USA and John Sullivan, Vice-President - Americas Region & Growth Markets. Our guests shared Kaoâ€™s global vision and discussed how the Bondi team will play a pivotal role in achieving Kaoâ€™s core purpose of realizing a Kirei World in which all life lives in harmony. Pictured (left to right): Satoru Tanaka, Kao Corporate Strategy, Shaun Wilson, Bondi Sands Founder and President, and Yoshihiro Hasebe, CEO Kao Corporations.\n\nIn 2023 we launched Technocolor 1 Hour Express, an industry first self tanning range featuring four shades to provide a custom tanning experience by tailoring formulas and active ingredients to cater to all skin tones. We are excited to announce the expansion of this innovative range. Introducing â€¦ ðŸ’™ðŸ’š TECHNOCOLOR SELF TANNING FACE SERUM ðŸ’œðŸ§¡ Our Technocolor range has been clinically created alongside extensive research and development, backed by a world-first skin study and clinical skin trials that went beyond the surface of your skin. Using an advanced laser skin analysis technology, we evaluated how thousands of varying skin tones reacted to increased levels of self tanning actives on skin, measuring colour, depth and longevity. Through these findings, we determined that each skin tone requires a tailored formula to achieve the most optimal results, which led to the development of Dermachromaticâ„¢ Colour Technology. Technocolor Face also introduces Blemish Control Complexâ„¢, which encompasses further research and development specific to face tanning to ensure its effectiveness and ability to address various blemish concerns. Each shade contains a powerful blend of active ingredients that are clinically tested and proven to help prevent breakouts and blemishes from appearing, delivering a natural glow without compromising your skin barrier. Features and benefits include: ðŸš« Blemish Control Complexâ„¢ (NEW!) ðŸ§¬ Dermachromaticâ„¢ Colour Technology ðŸ’  4 Unique Colour Enhancers ðŸ§ª Clinically Proven Formulas ðŸ’§ Electrolyte Hydration ðŸª„ Enhanced Skin Result âœ¨ Fragrance Free Where to shop: ðŸ›’ Available Worldwide on Bondi Sands Online & In-Store: ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Chemist Warehouse Australia ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Boots UK Boots Ireland Superdrug ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Ulta Beauty online Coming soon to the following stores: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Ulta Beauty ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Shoppers Drug Mart #bonditechnocolor"
