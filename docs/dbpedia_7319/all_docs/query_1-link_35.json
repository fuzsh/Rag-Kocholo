        "text": "Team Bondi boss Brendan McNamara has said that anticipated detective blockbuster LA Noire will bring in \"all types of players,\" regardless of gaming experience.\n\nMcNamara said in an interview with Paste Magazine that the game wouldn't make life hell for newcomers, but it wouldn't easy for the hardcore either.\n\n\"We recognize that LA Noire will draw all types of players with various levels of experience and skills,\" he said.\n\n\"The goal wasn’t to make a punishingly difficult experience for newcomers, or a game that felt too easy for the hardcore. Proficiency in interrogations can reward the player in a number of ways: a new clue may surface, an expedited path to the end of the case may present itself, perhaps a side story of a character unfolds.\n\n\"We want to reward and encourage players to strive for the truth in every interrogation, but we understand that, sometimes, you just get it wrong. And that’s OK,\" he continued.\n\n\"Players will never fail a case or their progress impeded for performing dismally in an interrogation. They may just have a longer road to travel to the truth. We also recognise that women appear to be much better at reading lies than men.\"\n\nMcNamara said that action in the game \"varies greatly from case to case,\" but cases can be solved without violence most of the time. There will be times where you'll have to get your hands dirty, though.\n\n\"For example, instead of pulling out his gun and shooting a fleeing suspect, Phelps can fire a warning shot that stops the person in their tracks,\" he said.\n\n\"Other times, Phelps has little choice but to roll up his sleeves and pursue justice using deadly force. It becomes a balancing act between introducing players to a radically different type of gameplay and also maintaining a level of comfort and familiarity.\"\n\nLA Noire releases on May 17 in the US and May 20 in the UK for PS3 and 360."
