        "text": "Sydney-based development studio Team Bondi, the company behind L.A. Noire, has been placed into administration.\n\nThe appointment comes after a rough few months for the studio, which has been rocked by allegations of unsatisfactory working conditions and claims Rockstar was unlikely to publish the developer's next game. Complaints from former employees who were not acknowledged in the credits of the company's blockbuster debut game compounded things further.\n\nAccording to SmartCompany documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission indicate Team Bondi went into external administration on August 30.\n\nThe appointment comes just weeks after the business was rumoured to be selling assets and non-L.A. Noire intellectual property to filmmaker George Miller's studio KMM.\n\nA source close to the company has indicated to us that, after a deal for the studio's next game fell through, employees of Team Bondi have been folded into KMM and its Dr D Studio division and that they are currently assisting with Happy Feet Two.\n\nWe will continue to follow this story and update you as more information becomes available."
