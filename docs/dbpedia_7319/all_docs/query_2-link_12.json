As you may remember he had gone quiet ever since the fallout of Team Bondi's working conditions and subsequently closed its doors. The small team at his studio was responsible for the recent LA Noire VR files, and according to job listing, seems to be returning to console games as well. Whatever happens from this I have no clue.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-game-engine-programmer-at-video-games-deluxe-759161266/\n\nSony and Rockstar probably don't want anything to do with him, so it will be interesting to see who picks up the tab.\n\nsafe to say Whore of the Orient ain't on the table\n\nHe's very talented, he wrote that whole game himself supposedly and it's a pretty well-done story even if you don't like it as a video game. Hopefully he's learned from the past and reflected on the conditions of Team Bondi and can create something wonderful again.\n\nWhore of the Orient maybe?\n\nSony and Rockstar probably don't want anything to do with him, so it will be interesting to see who picks up the tab.\n\nsafe to say Whore of the Orient ain't on the table\n\nI mean like the listing says, they did stuff with the recent VR version of LA Noire so he's still somewhat close to Rockstar.\n\nThis guy is a massive scumbag from all accounts so I'm not sure why anyone is happy about this.\n\nNot defending his past with mentioning this but he has ex Team Bondi devs back at his new studio, so they seem to have some respect for him. Hopefully he learnt from his mistakes.\n\n\"Muh video games!\"\n\nEverything pointed to Rockstar having to step in and wrestle creative control over the last two years of LA Noire anyway just to get the game out the door, so I'm not sure what the \"Muh video games!\" people are even clinging to at this point.\n\nEverything pointed to Rockstar having to step in and wrestle creative control over the last two years of LA Noire anyway just to get the game out the door, so I'm not sure what the \"Muh video games!\" people are even clinging to at this point.\n\nSame reason people still defend Kojima.\n\nHe's very talented, he wrote that whole game himself supposedly and it's a pretty well-done story even if you don't like it as a video game.

Tons of significantly better games even back in 2011."
