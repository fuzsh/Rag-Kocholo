        "text": "LA Noire was always going to be highly anticipated. It is, after all, the latest project from Rockstar, the publisher behind Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption – the company that has defined a new era of sprawling open-world adventures.\n\nBut this one is different. Crafted by freshman studio Team Bondi, and envisioned by Brenda McNamara – the creator of Sony's one-time GTA competitor, The Getaway – it is a new slant on the Rockstar recipe.\n\nSet in Los Angeles in the late-1940s and following a rising star of the LAPD, Cole Phelps, it is, for a start, on the opposite site of the law from many of the publisher's titles. It also looks to be a more cerebral ride, with the emphasis on studying crime scenes and questioning suspects rather than gunning down everyone who inadvertently strays into your sights.\n\nSo what's the central concept behind the game, and why has Team Bondi opted for the period of Chandler and Dashiell Hammett? Recently, we spoke with McNamara and Rockstar's vice-president of development, Jeronimo Barrera, to find out more.\n\nSo take us back to the beginning. How did LA Noire come about? Was it from reading Chandler novels or watching Fritz Lang movies?\n\nBrendan McNamara: Yeah, I suppose it was. When I first read Raymond Chandler I was about 15, and over the last 10 years I've read a lot of James Ellroy, too. When Curtis Hanson brought LA Confidential to the screen, I thought, well, maybe we could do a more modern version of that. When we started the game, we went all the way back to the German Expressionists – we wanted that really stark lighting. And we're now able to do that for the first time on consoles.\n\nAnd how did the proprietary Depth Analysis facial capture become a part of this?\n\nBM: I'd been doing motion capture for around 15 years, and I was never very interested in the technology. But for a long time, before I even started Team Bondi, I was looking into capturing the surface of the face. So when I moved back to Australia I started a company to research facial capture.\n\nDoes it have its roots in some kind of medical implementation? That's certainly where standard optical motion capture came from.\n\nBM: You're always standing on the shoulders of giants. It comes from 20 years of research into stereovision and photogrammetry. In fact, you can take it back to Pythagoras: through a pair of cameras you're just trying to triangulate a pixel. But now is an important point in time because we can manage that phenomenal amount of data, and find clever ways to play it back on a console. We have 32 cameras that capture a gigabyte of data a second – we have about 350 terrabytes of raw data!\n\nJeronimo Barrera: When we started working with Team Bondi, even though the experiments were up and running we didn't have it working in the game, it probably didn't come online until last year…\n\nBM: That's correct. It was a huge text adventure for a long time!\n\nBut looking at the game now, it's so richly visual. You've clearly spent a lot of time on period details such as fashion and architecture. Did you have Mad Men in mind?\n\nBM: It's interesting, but the production levels on games like Red Dead Redemption and LA Noire are similar to that kind of show now. We tried hard to get the right costumes, the right fabrics ... we're a little obsessive about detail.\n\nDid you speak to the LAPD?\n\nBM: We spoke to a lot of them. Originally, we approached the LAPD historical society and they took us in hand, told us what it was really like, took us out to one of the old jails, sat us in a cell, all that kind of stuff. They took us through famous cases how the organisation has changed. They told us some great stories.\n\nAnd most of the missions in the game are based on actual cases, aren't they?\n\nBM: 90% of the cases are. That was part of our research phase: we got the newspapers from every day during 1947, we had the Examiner, the Herald, the Daily News ... there were just so many amazing stories, we thought we may as well use them – it's more interesting than what we could have come up with. And for any that are unsolved, we tried to come up with our own way to solve them.\n\nWhat were some of the key cases for you?\n\nBM: Obviously the case of the Black Dhalia was why we chose 1947. We weren't trying to solve that, it's like Jack the Ripper, it's unsolvable. But on the front pages of all the newspapers at the time there was a photo of someone cut in half – you can't imagine that now. That set the tone for the brutality of the year. There were a lot of great cases that we couldn't do. We could have had hundreds.\n\nThe game is all about reading body language. Did you study the subject during development?\n\nBM: Well, Jeronimo plays a lot of blackjack, so he can probably explain all about tells!\n\nJB: Obviously we did a lot of research, read all the books, but you've got to remember, we're using actors, and they are inherently lying all the time. We directed their performances toward what people are used to seeing on film or on TV, when you watch liars on a cop show, versus really good liars in real life.\n\nBM: The other side of that is, actors will say they're never lying because they're truly in the moment. We weren't consciously looking for micro-tells, as you won't be seeing this game on 14-foot-high screen like you are in the cinema. If you say to an actor, \"on this line I really want you to lie\", it's amazing how that comes across.\n\nJB: And all the time you're investigating crime scenes, so you have to keep data in your head about what's happening, what's going on. Part of the game is to catch people, to have the evidence available so that you can accuse them when they're lying. It's about keeping track of the story, the whole performance, rather than necessarily looking for an \"answer\".\n\nIn many ways, then, the game requires a whole new set of skills from gamers. Is it nerve-racking or exciting to be making those demands?\n\nJB: It's a little bit of both and as of this moment, it is still unproven. We've yet to see if people are going to attach themselves to it. At Rockstar, we're always trying to push the medium. If games are only going to be about shooting things, dying and starting over, that's a pretty boring future for us. So here's an opportunity where we thought, how can we make having a conversation be the focus of the gameplay?\n\nIt's been sort of the holy grail for a long time and the technology wasn't there to approach it in this manner. Obviously, there have been a million talking heads in video games – games like Mass Effect do an amazing job, the guys at BioWare really know how to work conversation systems. But we wanted to take it a step futher and actually have that human element that can be missing from those games; the ability to see a performance rather than a puppet on screen.\n\nIt certainly seems designers are now realising that games can be about human drama ...\n\nBM: Exactly. There's no reason why you can't have the same sorts of relationships – whether they're about fear, hate or love – with a game character that you can with a film character. That's one of the freedoms that technology gives you.\n\nJB: Even though the structure of the game is revolutionary for this industry, it's based on the tried and true formula of cop shows that have been around for years on television. There's an element people will be familiar with, whether you're a hardcore gamer or not: you show up at a crime scene, you find evidence and then you go talk to suspects.\n\nBut do you think an emerging interest in human drama will gradually change the way games are developed?\n\nJB: Absolutely. When you're making games this big and so frigging complicated you have to have a good director and good writers, you have to have designers who are willing to take chances on creating new gameplay mechanics. Something has to change, that's the only way of raising the bar. We're taking lessons from Red Dead, which took lessons from GTA, we're obviously evolving how these games are made.\n\nHow about story-telling – have you brought in scriptwriters from Hollywood or TV?\n\nBM: I just wrote it myself, like I normally do! No, as much as I'd like to compare myself to Kubrick or Hitchcock, most parts of a game are super collaborative. I might come up with a plot for a case, but the first thing we'll do before I write a word of dialogue is sit down with the game designers and work out where the holes are; where it would work and where it wouldn't in a game. If you meet this person here, and then you talk to someone else, but don't find this clue … you learn a lot from that process. With video games, whether they're as big as this one or not, you have to be in an office for three or four years with game developers. If you want to wander around in jodhpurs with a bullhorn, it's probably not going to work.\n\nHow are the likes of Kinect going to help evolve human dramas? This whole idea of controller-free input must open a few new doors?\n\nBM: Definitely, and to some extent we're exploring that in this game – we put a person in front of you and ask, \"do you believe them or not?\" Their face becomes the user interface. The controller definitely stops you broadening the audience.\n\nJB: I love the Kinect, we play it in our household. It's evolving, it's trying to find its place – is someone going to make the killer app for it? Absolutely. And for us, if the best way to get our vision across is motion control we'll use it. But that all came along during the development of LA Noire and we didn't want to shoehorn it in.\n\nDo you see an era where there is no shooting in a Rockstar game?\n\nJB: Absolutely, and we're flirting with that in this game – there are cases when you never draw a gun or chase a criminal. It's something that's going to happen sooner than later. I have children and when we get together as a family we play games, we don't watch TV. We're a generation that's always been around interactivity, and in the future something like LA Noire could be broadcast directly onto your cable set-top box. It's the future.\n\nAnd we're taking the same risks with LA Noire as we did when we published GTA 3. At that time, I remember trying to explain to people that there aren't really any levels, you can go where you want, you activate missions when you want. It was going over people's heads. They thought it was absurd. Well, this game is a bit more cerebral, you have to talk to people, you have to figure out if they're telling you the truth, but it's taking that same sort of step that GTA took. We're going from having a cinematic experience that you can control to a human experience that you can control.\n\nHow might LA Noire change the user's relationship with the lead character? Phelps is a complex character with a troubled past – will our relationship with him change? Are we heading into a future where our relationship with the lead character is malleable over the course of the game?\n\nBM: I think Red Dead foreshadows that kind of stuff: the character journey. At Rockstar, we're not really interested in archetypes any more, we're not interested in characters who are the same at the end of the game as they were at the start. For as far back as you can remember, that's been the case with game characters. You can laugh with them, kill with them, but they don't change. We want to see how our characters develop through the entertainment. With TV we get to see how a character develops over a series, that's the interesting part – to go on a personal journey with characters. That's what we want to do with games – and I think that's possible.\n\nDo you think you've clambered over the uncanny valley now?\n\nBM: Oh, there's so much more to do!"
