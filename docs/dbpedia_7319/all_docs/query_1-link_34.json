        "text": "I noticed this in the Switch version when I started it up, the Team Bondi logo that's on startup on the PC/Last gen versions of the game is missing, though the credits seem the same as before.\n\nHow much bad blood was there between Bondi and Rockstar to warrant the new releases to completely remove their logo? Is Bondi still even around?\n\nRockstar gonna Rockstar. Remember that time they took Manhunt 2 from its original development team, fired them all, and then removed their names from the credits even though much of the game was their work? Good times, good times. (LA Noire was missing a lot of names, too, although this might have been Team Bondi's doing.)\n\nRockstar has... problems as a company. I don't see why anyone would ever want to work for them, especially considering how poorly former employees speak of them.\n\nNot that an eye for an eye makes it better, but considering how Team Bondi - and Brendan McNamara (studio boss and director of the game) - was super shitty, it's not exactly a shocker. Especially considering they have an acrimonious relationship with Rockstar too.\n\nDidn't Bondi go under?\n\nYep. They've been dead for six years now.\n\nAs long as the developers continue to get credit, I don't think it's a big deal that the studio isn't credited, since there's no longer any studio to credit.\n\nDidn't Bondi go under?\n\nJust did a quick google search, yeah they did, they were kept on life support for a while since they were working on Whore of the Orient, but that got confirmed cancelled last year apparently :( https://www.finder.com.au/whore-of-the-orient-cancelled\n\nSuch a shame too, I absolutely loved L.A. Noire and that's the reason why I bought the re-release. I wonder if this is why we haven't seen Rockstar work with any outside developers ever since they shipped L.A. Noire.\n\nYeah exactly. They still appear in the credits so this is nbd imo\n\nIt's the same credits as before. That's still a big deal, especially since the site where everyone was actually credited is gone.\n\nThis is why I won't buy the next gen version of this game and still keep my PS3 version! Brendan McNamara may be a hot headed person but the man is an ambitious developer in my honest opinion. Both his games, The Getaway and L.A. Noire, were ground-breaking, ambitious, and innovative.\n\nIf the studio got dissolved, there's not even a entity to be credited, it makes no sense to keep the name of an extinct legal entity. The right thing to do is to only keep the name of the developers involved.\n\nIt's the same credits as before. That's still a big deal, especially since the site where everyone was actually credited is gone.\n\nI mean I'm not sure what having a Team Bondi logo would do to fix that. The studio doesn't exist anymore, so there's no point in having their logo there.\n\nWhat a fuckin' bummer. Scummy shit right there.\n\nI can't think of another time this has happened before off the dome. Removing the goddamn developer's logo from their game? That's ridiculous.\n\nScummy dead studio got their logo removed? Oh no.... what ever will we do?\n\nWhat a fuckin' bummer. Scummy shit right there.\n\nI can't think of another time this has happened before off the dome. Removing the goddamn developer's logo from their game? That's ridiculous.\n\nThe developer no longer exists. This is how these things work. The flurry of logos when you start up a game are there for legal reasons, not sentimental ones.\n\nWhat happened between Team Bondi and Rockstar? All I ever heard was that the former would make terrible choices and insane requests so Rockstar eventually felt the need to take control.\n\nTeam Bondi was led by a shit tier director and upper management that even Rockstar wanted out. Rockstar got the IP from Sony and had every intention I believe of having Bondi be one of their studios, just based in Sydney. However McNamara and the rest of the team kept missing deadlines pushing the game back, it was never shaping up well forcing Rockstar to cancel E3 showings and going wildly over budget. In the end Rockstar had to step in to salvage the project but once finished they severed their ties with Bondi.\n\nSo them removing them from the opening credits isn't surprising and as far as I heard this remaster was outsourced and not done internally at Rockstar?\n\nTeam Bondi was led by a shit tier director and upper management that even Rockstar wanted out.

Do you have any sources?\n\nWhat happened between Team Bondi and Rockstar? All I ever heard was that the former would make terrible choices and insane requests so Rockstar eventually felt the need to take control.\n\nThat's the gist of it, but it doesn't quite capture the scope of what Rockstar had to to in order to ship the game. They threw Leeds at it to get the game on a working engine and did enough work that they honestly should have gotten a flat-out co-developer credit, had Rockstar not already been in the process of restructuring their brand so that every studio contributed to every game under the same general Rockstar banner that got its initial roll-out with Max Payne 3. Without Rockstar putting their foot down, the game would have never come out, period.\n\nWhat a fuckin' bummer. Scummy shit right there.\n\nI can't think of another time this has happened before off the dome. Removing the goddamn developer's logo from their game? That's ridiculous.\n\nThey don't exist anymore. They are still prominently shown in the opening credits.\n\nCan people cite other example of a rerelease where the original dev no longer exists and as such all mention of the company was removed from the game? Multiple people have insisted this is \"normal\" but have not provided any examples, just curious. Either way seems messed up to me.\n\nScummy dead studio got their logo removed? Oh no.... what ever will we do?\n\nThe developer no longer exists. This is how these things work. The flurry of logos when you start up a game are there for legal reasons, not sentimental ones.\n\nThey don't exist anymore. They are still prominently shown in the opening credits.\n\nLook ya'll I get that Bondi is dead and everything, it's just with the whole way they were shuddered by Take 2 and Rockstar it's hard for me not to feel like this is taking the piss a little.\n\nthey were working on Whore of the Orient, but that got confirmed cancelled last year apparently :( https://www.finder.com.au/whore-of-the-orient-cancelled.\n\nWell that sucks. I don't remember any specifics of it, just that I got more hyped for that game when I read about it than just about anything else that's come out in the last five years. Damn shame."
