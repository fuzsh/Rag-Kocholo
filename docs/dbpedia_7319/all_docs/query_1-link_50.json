Today, however, new information emerged, in fact, according to a post on the forums NeoGaf, Team Bondi would be bankrupt, and the remaining team members with the head they would be to switch to Brendan McNamara studies KMM.\n\nFurthermore, according to this post on our forums NeoGaf, Depth Analysis (the company that owns the technology of facial animation of LA Noire) would also be economic in some trouble, not having received virtually no revenue from the success of LA Noire (just like Team Bondi same).\n\nBrendan McNamara seems to have accepted the offer of Australian studies, an offer that would allow Team Bondi to \"hide\" their name, a name virtually convicted in the scandal concerning the working conditions intolerable for many former members of the study."
