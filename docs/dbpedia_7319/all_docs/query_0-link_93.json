        "text": "Team Bondi doesn’t do straight-forward. The Australian developer behind detective title L.A. Noire was unceremoniously dumped by Rockstar upon completion of the PlayStation 3 game. It was then supposedly snapped up by Sydney-based production house KMM, where it started work on a PlayStation 4 project named Whore of the Orient.\n\nAnd the first footage of the release is embedded below, courtesy of VideoGamer.com. The title – previously described by director Brendan McNamara as a \"one of the great untold stories of the 20th century\" – features free-running, cover-based shooting, and crowded Shanghai streets. Judging by the framerate and animations in the video, we’re assuming that the game is still incredibly early."
