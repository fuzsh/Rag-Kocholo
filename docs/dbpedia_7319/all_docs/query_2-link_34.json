        "text": "Em Bonaccorso\n\nManager\n\nQualifications/Experience\n\nBachelor of exercise and sports science,\n\nCert IV fitness,\n\n10 years coaching,\n\n4 years in fitness management\n\nEm initially moved from Perth to Melbourne to join one of Australia’s leading cheerleading teams. Originally a routine journey for World Championships in 2020, this relocation evolved into a life-changing five-year tenure in Melbourne.\n\nDuring her time there, Em attained her bachelor’s degree in Exercise and Sports Science, achieved first and second place finishes at Worlds ’21 & ’23 in Florida, and seamlessly integrated into the realm of health and fitness. In addition to her athletic accomplishments, Em became a part of the 98 community through FYFs, assuming the role of Melbourne’s manager in the following months. Her experience with adversity during Melbourne’s temporary closure reinforced her appreciation for the program’s unparalleled community and program, and alignment to its ethos of The Standard (both being it and holding it).\n\nDriven by purpose and intention, Em’s work ethic is grounded in commitment and drive. She looks forward to her relocation to Sydney and continuing her passion for fostering positive, enduring change in the lives of individuals\n\nBeth Forshaw\n\nCoach\n\nQualifications/Experience\n\nBSc Sport and Exercise Science\n\nPersonal Trainer / Fitness Instructor\n\n11 years coaching experience\n\nOriginally from the UK, Beth began her sporting career as a competitive swimmer, competing at a national level across the UK. This fed into a keen interest in understanding the body’s full potential, resulting in studying a Bachelor in Sport and Exercise Science.\n\nSince then, Beth’s coaching background has expanded to include swimming, pilates and strength and conditioning. No matter the discipline, Beth’s coaching ethos always comes down to the love of helping people to understand the movement potential of their bodies, as well as educating clients to understand the “why” behind what they’re doing. This has allowed Beth to coach a huge number of clients through a range of abilities from novices to experienced athletes. That said, Beth’s expertise lies in strength training, as well as impressive experience in pre and post natal training.\n\nCalling Sydney home for the past 4 years, when Beth isn’t in the gym you can find her ocean swimming, surfing or enjoying a lovely glass of red.\n\nTim Butler\n\nCoach\n\nQualifications/Experience\n\nBachelor of Sport & Exercise Science\n\nCertificate III & IV in Fitness\n\n9 years experience\n\nHaving grown up all across Australia and the world, Tim had constant exposure to a variety of sports throughout his childhood. His passion for strength, conditioning, and all things fitness however became more prominent through his time in the Army as he began to enter the world of functional fitness in an effort to continually improve his strength and general work capacity for the job.\n\nHis keen interest in improving physical performance led him to complete his qualifications in the fitness industry and pursue work as a CrossFit coach whilst studying Sports and Exercise Science. He has since fully immersed himself in the world of strength and conditioning, travelling across the world to learn from and be mentored by some of the top strength and conditioning coaches.\n\nAlthough passionate about finding the limit of his athletic performance, Tim doesn’t define himself as someone who is particularly athletically gifted. He uses this to highlight to people that he works with that a high standard of strength and conditioning can be achieved by anyone willing to continually apply themselves to the process. He has a keen interest in continuing to push the needle to find his own limits in training, chasing excellence in longer endurance activities whilst still aiming to progress under the barbell.\n\nFranco Morris\n\nCoach\n\nQualifications/Experience\n\nCert III & IV in Fitness\n\nCrossFit level one\n\nAWF Club weightlifting/sports power coach level one\n\n5 years competing in fitness\n\nGrowing up rugby/team\n\n12 years Personal Training Experience\n\nTravelled internationally as a personal trainer to a professional race car driver\n\nFranco was born in the Welsh city of Cardiff and raised playing rugby, instilling the team above all mentality that still drives him to this day. His interest in athletic performance, injury prevention and longevity carries into his own training and the way he programs for individuals and groups he coaches.\n\nBeginning his career in the fitness industry at 18, Franco’s passion for seeing people achieve hasn’t diminished in the slightest. From coaching community level classes in his hometown to travelling across Europe and Asia as the personal trainer to professional GP3 driver Matthew Parry, Franco has seen and advocates the importance of training for all levels of fitness and interest. After two very successful seasons with Matt, the opportunity to move to Sydney presented itself and Franco took the chance.\n\nOnce in Sydney Franco continued his work in fitness, being offered the role of head coach in a CrossFit gym in Sydney’s south, before moving on as Head Coach and Manager in a strength and conditioning gym in Sydney’s lower north shore. While doing so, he also completed his Australian Weightlifting Federation (AWF) Club Weightlifting/Sports Power Coach Level One.\n\nFranco has been a big part of the wider 98 crew for some time and has represented the gym in competition on multiple occasions. His competitive spirit and his distaste for weaknesses or holes in his ability make him one of the most well rounded individuals at 98 GYM, with this translating to his coaching philosophy and style. His embodiment of the 98 ethos of commitment to the team, to hard work and willingness to suffer is apparent. Translating into his coaching, his encouragement of performance based goals continually yields better results than his clients anticipated possible."
