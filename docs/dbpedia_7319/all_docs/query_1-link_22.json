        "text": "A pair of developers behind Rockstar Games' 2011 title L.A. Noire have opened a new studio.\n\nMCV reports today that L.A. Noire design lead Alex Carlyle and storyboard artist Kelly Baigent have opened Intuitive Game Studios, an independent outfit based in Sydney, Australia.\n\n\"I really do want to stay in Australia and try and overcome the drive which is leading everyone to Canada or the like,\" Carlyle said. \"I want to stay here and make games and hopefully be able to sustain a small studio, provide employment and jobs here.\"\n\nNo mention was made of what the new studio's first title will be. The Intuitive Game Studios website states the company has high hopes for itself.\n\n\"Intuitive Game Studios is an independent game developer with big ambitions,\" reads a statement on the company's website. \"At Intuitive we focus intently on quality and content to proudly produce exactly the kind of game we would want to play ourselves.\""
