        "text": "The full client experience at F45 Bondi Beach was good, achieving our Recommended rating.\n\nThe class was also very good and has won our 4-Star Class Experience Award.\n\nHow was this club rated and evaluated? Find out more about our process here.\n\nThe class was lively and energetic, with the studio containing branded elements throughout, such as the blue astroturf strip and dumbbells.\n\nThe signature F45 TVs displayed the workout alongside demonstrations of the exercises, which made it easy to follow.\n\n“The encouragement from the coaches was really motivating.”\n\n“The booking process was seamless and prepared me well for the session.”\n\n“The two coaches looked to be enjoying leading the class, which added to the positive vibe.”\n\nThe name stands for “Functional Training 45”, with sessions being a mix of functional HIIT and strength exercises delivered in a 45-minute format. Each day, the workout is predetermined by F45 HQ and is the same at every F45 location worldwide.\n\nTheir Saturday “Hollywood” sessions are the only 60-minute class and are famous for hiring local DJs to create a party atmosphere and bring the community together.\n\nWorkouts are typically run by two or more coaches per class. To support the coach, clients are guided by screens that display each exercise as well as beeps and graphics that cue them to work, rest or move to their next station.\n\nOur call to the branch was answered, with our questions answered and the basics covered for our visit.\n\nOn arrival there was a class running, so were advised to wait in the coffee shop next door. The coach was also in charge of checking people into the class, which was done without a defined front desk area, but rather on the training floor.\n\nAfter the session, the team at the club were comfortable discussing our options to continue our training.\n\nF45 Bondi Beach received The Fit Guide 4-Star Class Experience Award, making it one of Sydney’s stand-out offerings.\n\nThe workout was easy to follow as the screens displayed the movements clearly and there was good communication from the two coaches. The structure of the class was explained well, which included some advanced movements such as squat jump thrusters.\n\nOverall, despite lacking some individualized coaching from the team, it was a fun and positive experience\n\nThe online booking process was simple and aided by the branded F45 app. The website structure was functional and easy to navigate, although it did lack some features such as bios for the coaches.\n\nThe club used F45’s signature screen technology to display the workouts, which clearly display each exercise and what’s coming up next.\n\nF45 Bondi Beach offers an introductory deal for first-time clients of seven days of sessions for $50.\n\nIf you’re looking for a longer-term commitment, unlimited memberships are available from $65 per week, when committing for three months, to $70 a week for a package that can be cancelled anytime.\n\nDrop-in sessions are available at $35 per class, with smaller commitment packages also available, starting at a 10-pack for $300.\n\nAll prices are in Australian Dollars."
