        "text": "Should a sequel to Rockstar Games’ latest offering ever appear, it won’t come from the original developer. Team Bondi, the studio that labored on L.A. Noire since 2005, has been liquidated, according to documents filed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\nTeam Bondi went into administration on August 30, after the Sydney-based studio filed a notification of discharge. This move followed months of swelling controversy surrounding L.A. Noire’s development. In June, former Team Bondi employees claimed that at least 100 employees had been left off the game’s credit roll. Developers who worked on the game then spoke up, saying they had worked 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, in “praise-free” conditions.\n\nDevelop reports that some Team Bondi assets and staff will be transferred to another Sydney production studio, Kennedy Miller Mitchell.\n\nL.A. Noire was released in May to critical acclaim and solid sales. It is scheduled to be released on PC next month. Anandtech has contacted Rockstar regarding their plans to support L.A. Noire following Team Bondi’s dissolution."
