        "text": "Been wanting to see more Bruce Lee films since watching & loving Enter The Dragon. I later saw Fist Of Fury, which I liked, but none of the others were on any services. Until now. So I binged the below four in July‚Ä¶ üôÇ\n\nI‚Äôll review them in the order I watched them‚Ä¶\n\nThe Way Of The Dragon (1972) (Chinese: ÁåõÈæçÈÅéÊ±ü)\n\nDirected & Written by Bruce Lee\n\nStarring: Bruce Lee, Nora Miao, Paul Wei, Huang Chung-hsin, Tony Liu, Unicorn Chan, Chuck Norris, Malisa Longo, Robert Wall, Hwang In-shik, Jon T. Benn\n\nPlot Synopsis: (via IMDb)\n\nA man visits his relatives at their restaurant in Italy and has to help them defend against brutal gangsters harassing them.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nThis was fun but so cheesy. Certainly not up to the standards of Enter The Dragon or Fist Of Fury. Guess it‚Äôs rated highly because people were excited by the fact that Chuck Norris is in it at the end. Yes, it was cool seeing Lee & Norris together. Kind of like De Niro & Pacino in Heat!\n\nThe movie was a bit underwhelming up until that part, though. Not enough fighting overall. And not enough blood! The one I watched after this had blood flying all over the place, which I quite frankly want from this type of movie. Squirt! And what was with the random naked woman? And why did Bruce Lee keep needing to go to the bathroom all the time?? Cheesy movie but that‚Äôs okay ‚Äì I love ‚Äò70s cheese. I still enjoyed this.\n\nMy Rating: 7/10\n\nThe Big Boss (1971) (Chinese: ÂîêÂ±±Â§ßÂÖÑ)\n\nDirected by Lo Wei & Wu Chia Hsiang\n\nStarring: Bruce Lee, Maria Yi, James Tien, Han Ying-chieh\n\nPlot Synopsis: (via IMDb)\n\nA young man sworn to an oath of non-violence works with his cousins in an ice factory where they mysteriously begin to disappear.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nOkay, the version I saw of this had bits of Pink Floyd‚Äôs Dark Side Of The Moon playing throughout it, which was weird but kind of cool. I watched this just after The Way Of The Dragon. I preferred this one, which wasn‚Äôt as cheesy. It had a more serious story & loads of fighting & lots of squirty blood. Squirt squirt! Bit depressing, though, what with all the murdering going on. So many evil henchmen in all these Bruce Lee films‚Ä¶\n\nMy Rating: 7/10\n\nGame Of Death (1978) (Chinese: Ê≠ª‰∫°ÁöÑÈÅäÊà≤)\n\nDirected by Robert Clouse & Bruce Lee & Sammo Hung\n\nStarring: Bruce Lee, Gig Young, Dean Jagger, Colleen Camp, Kim Tai-jong, Yuen Biao, Robert Wall, Hugh O‚ÄôBrian, Dan Inosanto, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mel Novak, Sammo Hung, Ji Han-jae, Casanova Wong\n\nPlot Synopsis: (via IMDb)\n\nA martial arts movie star must fake his death to find the people who are trying to kill him.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nThis was a cobbled together nightmare. Which is understandable, of course, as they had to finish it after Lee‚Äôs death. Well, they didn‚Äôt HAVE to but I suppose they needed to make money. It feels so exploitative. But, damn, once it got to the end and it used the actual footage Lee filmed, it was pretty f*^king awesome.\n\nThe story cobbled together before Lee‚Äôs bit, involving a faked death & mafia bosses or some shit, was pretty pathetic. But the end involves Lee‚Äôs original idea of him having to ascend a five-story pagoda where he has to defeat different martial artists on each level. That was great! What a brilliant idea. Is that where The Raid got that idea?! Had no clue it was Lee who had inspired so many movies & video games with that concept.\n\nAnd, of course, this is the film with the iconic yellow jumpsuit so I had to see it just for that. I loved all that actual Bruce Lee footage at the end of this film, especially his fight with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Absolutely fantastic. So I have to give this movie two ratings: one for the overall film & one for Lee‚Äôs footage, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Up until the end, the movie is pretty bloody awful and it‚Äôs also sad as hell to see the way they inserted shots of Lee from previous films of his. So distracting & feels disrespectful.\n\nMy Rating: 6.5/10 (Overall film ‚Äì I like the Colleen Camp Wayne‚Äôs World connection) & 8/10 (Bruce Lee‚Äôs footage)\n\nGame Of Death II (1981) (Chinese: Ê≠ª‰∫°Â°î)\n\nDirected by Ng See-yuen\n\nStarring: Bruce Lee (not really), Tong Lung, Huong Cheng Li, Roy Chiao, To Wai Wo, Hoi Sang Lee\n\nPlot Synopsis: (via IMDb)\n\nAfter Billy Lo is killed while seeking the murderers of his friend, his brother Bobby goes all out to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nMy Opinion:\n\nUsing old footage of Bruce Lee to make this film years after his death felt weird & icky. It got better when they stopped using old footage to try to insert Lee into this movie & instead moved onto focusing on a different character.\n\n*Cute Monkey*\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a better story than what they cobbled together for the start of Game Of Death (which appears to be in no way related to Game Of Death II other than the same character name). This one has better sets, a funky score, the fights are fun & there‚Äôs a cute monkey. But it‚Äôs not a Bruce Lee film. While this one feels like a stronger film overall, the final part of the first Game Of Death with Bruce Lee‚Äôs footage is so much better than anything from this weird ‚Äúsequel‚Äù."
