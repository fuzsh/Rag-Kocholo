        "text": "The honorary chairman of the Liberal Party, James Tien, said today that a national security law should be enacted in Hong Kong as soon as possible.\n\n\"The Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, keeps saying ‘wait for the proper time.' One could argue there would never be a proper time, it could just be a better time,\" he said.\n\n\"And my point is that, I think right now would be better for Hong Kong than if Article 23 is further delayed for ten more years. Because I think [in] ten more years, China would be stronger than today. In negotiating power, Hong Kong would be weaker,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nHe cited the construction of the bridge that is linking Hong Kong with Macau and Zhuhai and the express rail project as examples of the SAR's diminishing bargaining power.\n\n\"Frankly speaking, I will say it was minimal. If these had happened in 1997, Hong Kong would have had a major say in a lot of these issues,\" he said.\n\n\"I think everyone will agree that there is no way that in ten years’ time we would be in a better shape to negotiate with Beijing.\"\n\nTien also said the enactment of Article 23 would give the government a law to follow on issues related to national security, and would prevent it from just doing whatever it wants.\n\nHe told RTHK's Janice Wong that having things written down clearly as law will remove the ambiguity that now exists in areas like rejection of candidates during Legislative Council elections.-Photo: RTHK"
