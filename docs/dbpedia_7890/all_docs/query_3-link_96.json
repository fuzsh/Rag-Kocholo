Even playing in front of a hostile French crowd, de Long was not fazed.\n\nFrance's Timothe Vergiat tightly guarded de Long, but the Dutch basketball player took a step back two-point shot with a hand in his face that was nothing but net to secure the gold medal for his country. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nPARIS – The United States men’s volleyball team has yet to lose in the Paris Olympics, and the reward is a date with the No. 1-ranked team in the world.\n\nMonday night’s 26-24, 28-30, 25-19, 25-19 quarterfinal victory over Brazil moved the U.S. – now 4-0 in these Games – into a Wednesday semifinal against Poland, which is atop the sport’s current rankings.

The Brazilians blew a five-point lead to lose the first set. Then the U.S. team blew a six-point lead to cough up the second after leading it 21-16 and having two set points.\n\nAs has been the case throughout this Olympics, though, an experienced U.S. team was able to settle down and stabilize when it mattered most, jumping ahead in the third set (and making that lead hold up) before gradually pulling away in the latter stages of the fourth to quiet a noisy crowd that was largely in Brazil's corner.\n\nThe result continued what has been a nice rebound Games for a U.S. team that bowed out in the preliminary round in Tokyo. — Gentry Estes\n\nFrance has finally broken through as Jean-Philippe Mateta scored to tie Egypt 1-1 in the 83rd minute.

Armand Duplantis, who posted 6.24 during the Diamond League events earlier in 2024.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — American pole vaulter Sam Kendricks tied a season best at 5.95 meters (19 feet, 6 1/4 inches) and is taking home the silver in men’s pole vault.\n\nLate in the competition Kendricks, who won bronze at the 2016 Rio Games, appeared to be vaulting with his arm covered in blood. It’s unclear what happened.\n\nArmand Duplantis of Sweden won gold by clearing 6.0 meters, then set a new Olympic record at 6.10. He also won gold in Tokyo.\n\nEmmanouil Karalis of Greece was third after clearing 5.90.\n\nIt’s the second consecutive Olympics with Team USA earning silver in the men’s pole vault; Chris Nilsen took second in Tokyo three years ago but did not qualify for the final here. – Lindsay Schnell\n\nTeam USA's Juliette Whittaker finished seventh at the Paris Olympics on Monday in the women's 800 meter event with a time of 1:58.50.

She finished third in preliminary heats with a 2:00.45 to automatically qualify for the semifinals, and followed that with a 1:57.76 in the semis on Sunday, a personal best, to earn a place in Monday's finals. – Chase Goodbread\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The Olympic field in women's discus had three years to close the gap on Valarie Allman, and on Monday, they found out they'll need four more.\n\nThe defending gold medal winner from the 2021 Tokyo Games did it again for Team USA Monday, making it back-to-back golds with a throw of 69.50 at the Paris Olympics. The silver medal went to China's Bin Feng (67.51) and the bronze to Croatia's Sandra Elkasevic (67.51). Allman fouled on her first attempt, landing the discus wide of the right-side boundary, but took the lead on her second try with a throw of 68.74, and put the competition totally out of reach with the 69.50 on her fourth attempt. – Chase Goodbread\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Though Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon, considered one of the greatest distance runners of all time, crossed the finish line second in the women’s 5,000 meters, the Kenyan was disqualified for obstruction at the conclusion of the race, according to multiple reports.\n\nAt the final straightaway, Beatrice Chebet and her killer kick pulled in front of Kipyegon to give Chebet the gold over her Kenyan teammate.\n\nChebet finished in 14.28.56.

It was a personal best for Morgan.\n\nKenya is likely to appeal the obstruction ruling.\n\nKipyegon is also entered in the 1,500, where she is the world record holder. – Lindsay Schnell\n\nPARIS — The second 3x3 basketball tournament at the Olympics was a disappointment for the Americans, but they salvaged something when the women’s team beat Canada for the bronze medal on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. managed to hold Canada without a basket for the final 86 seconds of the game, pulling away behind Dearica Hamby’s six rebounds and Hailey Van Lith‘s six points.\n\nThe Americans were 11 for 17 on 1-point shots.\n\nThe U.S. took the gold three years ago in Tokyo. – Dan Wolken\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Americans Gabby Thomas, McKenzie Long and Brittany Brown advanced to the women’s 200-meter final at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThomas, the defending bronze medalist and favorite to win gold this time, blazed through her semifinal heat to win in 21.86. She has the fastest 200 time in the world, 21.78, which she ran June 28 at the U.S. track and field trials in Eugene, Oregon.\n\nThomas was behind at the curve, but easily overtook Dina Asher-Smith of Great Britain on the straightaway. Asher-Smith, who finished in 22.31, also advanced to the finals. – Lindsay Schnell\n\n▶ The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The 100 champion is off and running in the 200.\n\nNoah Lyles coasted to an easy win in the men’s 200 on Monday. Lyles took the lead around the turn, led comfortably down the home stretch and crossed the finish line in 20.19 seconds to win the sixth and final heat of the 200.\n\nLyles is trying to become the first American sprinter to win Olympic gold medals in both the 100 and 200 since Carl Lewis did it at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nAll three American men advanced to the semifinals with Kenny Bednarek (19.97) and Erriyon Knighton (19.99) joining Lyles. – Lindsay Schnell\n\nJuanlu Sanchez scored in the 85th minute, the late goal Spain needed to reach the men’s soccer final at the Paris Olympics in a 2-1 win against Morocco.\n\nSpain will make its second straight appearance in the gold medal game, hoping to improve from a silver finish at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nFermín López scored in the 66th minute to tie it for Spain, while Morocco's Soufiane Rahimi converted a penalty in the 36th minute to lead early.\n\nAn electric run by Morocco, which beat the United States 4-0 and outscored opponents 11-2 before Monday’s semifinal, comes to an end. – Safid Deen\n\nThe Team USA men's water polo squad is moving on to the quarterfinal after holding off Croatia on Monday.\n\nIn a hard-fought battle, Team USA secured the 14-11 win on the strength of goals from Ryder Dodd and Alex Bowen, who had two goals apiece. They finish tied in third place in their group and wait for the end of group play to determine who they will face in the quarterfinals, beginning Wednesday.\n\nA shove almost cost Amos Serem a shot at steeplechase glory.\n\nMaking his way over a hurdle, Serem was pushed aside and missed the water jump. He would double back and nearly secure his spot in the final lap, but would finish sixth in the heat, just out of qualifying range – the top five runners in the heats qualify for the final.\n\nAfter appealing, the 21-year-old will be allowed to race in the 3,000 meter steeplechase final, making for 16 runners in the fold come Wednesday.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Kenneth Rooks was the lone American to qualify for the men’s 3,000 steeplechase final, finishing second in the third and final heat of the event and clocking a time of 8:24.95. He was less than a second behind the winner of that heat, Lamecha Girma of Ethiopia, who ran 8:23.89.\n\nThe top five finishers in each of the steeplechase’s three heats advanced to Tuesday’s final.\n\nTeam USA’s other competitors, Matthew Wilkinson (8:16.82) and James Corrigan (8:36.67) finished sixth and tenth, in their respective heats and will not advance. – Lindsay Schnell\n\nWhile Noah Lyles had a night to remember, NBC broadcaster Leigh Diffey had a moment to forget.\n\nDiffey was behind the microphone for Lyles' razor-thin victor in the men's 100-meter dash on Sunday, and he incorrectly called the race for Jamaica's Kishane Thompson. Diffey caught heat for the botched call, and on Monday, he owned up to it.\n\n\"The men’s 100 was epic & closest of all time! My eyes & instinct told me Kishane Thompson won. Obviously, that wasn’t the case. I shouldn’t have been so bold to call it, but I genuinely thought he won. I got it wrong. I am thrilled for @LylesNoah as his story only gets bigger!,\" Diffey posted on X.\n\nPARIS — Being perfect in pool play only took Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss, one of the USA’s two women’s beach volleyball teams with legitimate medal aspirations, so far.\n\nNuss and Kloth fell to Canada’s Brandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes in two hard-fought sets 19-21 and 18-21 in the Round of 16, ending their Olympic dreams.\n\nThe tandem won all three of its pool play matches but that didn’t matter once the knockout round began.\n\nAgainst Canada, the first set featured runs from both teams, each side finding momentum only to lose it. Canada jumped out to the lead first. Then the USA made its play. A big block from Kloth gave the U.S. a 11-9 advantage as part of an 8-1 run. The Canadians battled back to tie the set at 14 and Wilkerson’s block put the Canadians back in front.\n\nTrailing 19-17, the USA found a way to tie it at 19. But Kloth’s swing into the net gave Canada the first set victory.\n\nThe Americans found themselves trailing again early in the second. Kloth, who finished with all eight of the team’s attack errors, struggled on serve receive for the second straight match and the U.S. was in a 7-3 hole. The U.S. hung in there but an ace from Canada to make it 15-11 felt like a death knell – until it wasn’t. Nuss and Kloth scraped themselves back into the set. Kloth’s block tied it at 18. Canada scored the final three points of the match to walk away victors. – Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhile the U.S. men's soccer team is out, a gold medal for the Olympic soccer tournament must still be awarded. There are two semifinal matchups on the docket Monday: Spain vs. Morocco and France vs. Egypt. USA TODAY Sports will provide live updates, highlights and more from the fixtures.\n\nPARIS — Foul trouble came back to bite Team USA in the women’s 3x3 basketball semifinals Monday in a 18-16 sudden death loss to Spain that relegates them to the bronze medal game, where they will play Canada for the medal.\n\nThe Americans led most of the way, but piled up 10 fouls in regulation, putting them in the perilous position in a format where the opponent gets two shots and the ball from that point on.\n\nAfter Spain scored the first point of sudden death on a driving layup by Sandra Ygueravide, Rhyne Howard shot a 2-pointer that would have given the Americans the win but missed everything.\n\nOn the next possession, Dearica Hamby was called for holding Ygueravide while trying to escape to the basket.\n\nShe swished the foul shot to send Spain to the gold medal game.\n\nHailey Van Lith had eight points to lead Team USA, which couldn’t win despite making 14 of 27 shots. Spain’s six free throws were the difference.\n\nSpain got the game to overtime with a backdoor layup right before regulation expired. – Dan Wolken\n\nPARIS — Onto the quarterfinals for men’s beach volleyball tandem Andy Benesh and Miles Partain.\n\nBenesh and Partain defeated Italy’s Samuele Cottafava and Paolo Nicolai in two sets (21-17 and 21-18).\n\nPartain’s ace in the second set to put the U.S. up 16-11 helped the duo secure the match, and Benesh followed with an ace to make it 18-13. Italy scored five of the next seven points to make the Americans sweat. But a final Italian service – of eight total – ended the match.\n\nIn the first, they jumped out to a 13-8 lead and relied on the early margin to carry them to a Set 1 victory.\n\nIt’s been an interesting Games for the duo. They parted ways with their coach for unclear reasons over the weekend and have yet to be transparent on the matter. They won their final two matches of group play after starting these Games with a loss to Cuba. Their three-set victory over Brazil last week sent them into the Round of 16 and a date with Italy.\n\nThe youngest U.S. men’s beach team in Olympic history will play the winner of Chile vs. Qatar in the quarterfinals. – Chris Bumbaca\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Two-time Olympic diver Delany Schnell advanced to the women’s 10-meter platform semifinals Monday but failed to move on to Tuesday’s top-12 final. She finished 15th with a score of 271.95.\n\nSchnell pulled off an impressive recovery in prelims after a couple low-scoring dives to make the top 18, and she opened semifinals with strong first- and second-round performances.\n\nBut a rough third-round dive — a back 3 1/2 somersaults in the tuck position with a 3.3 degree of difficulty that earned her just 31.35 points — dropped the 25-year-old from Michigan to 14th. And she was unable to return to the top 12 with her two remaining dives.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, Schnell previously finished sixth in the women’s synchronized 10-meter platform — an event she won a silver medal in at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Three years ago, she finished fifth in the women’s 10-meter platform.\n\nChina’s defending Olympic gold and silver medalists, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, led the way both in prelims and semifinals. Quan and Chen enter Tuesday’s final ranked first and second with scores of 421.05 and 403.05, respectively.\n\nFellow American diver Daryn Wright didn’t advance out of prelims, finishing 19th with a score of 272.25. – Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nVincent Hancock has another medal to add to his collection.\n\nHancock and Austen Jewell Smith teamed up to earn a silver medal in team skeet shooting Monday at the Chateauroux Shooting Centre. This is the first year team skeet shooting has been contested at the Olympics.\n\nHancock is a four-time Olympic gold medalist having won men's skeet in 2008, 2012, 2020 and this year. Smith, in her second Olympics, won bronze in women's skeet Sunday.\n\nHancock and Smith lost in the finals of Monday's team event to the Italian team of Diana Bocosi and Gabriele Rossetti, 45-44. China took bronze.\n\nItaly tied the qualification world record with a score 149 in the qualification round.\n\nThe U.S. swept skeet shooting gold in Tokyo, with Hancock winning the men's competition and Amber English winning the women's.\n\nTeam skeet marked the final shooting event at this year's Olympics. – Dave Birkett\n\nTeam USA's Evy Leibfarth was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the women's kayak cross event in canoe slalom. She finished third in her heat behind world No. 1 Kimberley Woods of Great Britain and Switzerland's Alena Marx.\n\nWoods was the race's runaway winner, but Leibfarth caught up with Marx and made contact – which is allowed in this chaotic event – to try and disrupt Marx's turn on the final barrier. Marx was able to stabilize quicker and beat Leibfarth to the final line in a race where only the top two would advance.\n\nLeibfarth, a 20-year-old from Bryson City, N.C., won a bronze medal earlier in the Paris Games in the canoe single competition. — Gentry Estes\n\nPARIS — Simone Biles won silver in the women’s floor exercise final, giving her four medals, including three golds, at these Games. It is the first time she has not won gold in a floor exercise final – ever.\n\nBrazil’s Rebeca Andrade won gold. After an inquiry, Team USA's Jordan Chiles' score was updated to a 13.766 to move her into third place and giving her bronze.\n\nThe medal is the 11th of Biles’ Olympic career, seven of which are gold. Biles led the U.S. to gold in the team final, won gold in the all-around and vault finals and finished fifth in the balance beam final earlier Monday. — Nancy Armour, Tom Schad\n\nScottie Scheffler's thrilling comeback victory at the Paris Olympics, rallying from four shots back during the final round at the Paris Olympics, was one for the ages.\n\nOf course, it came at the expense of Jon Rahm, the 54-hole leader, who let that lead slip away by shooting a 39 on the back nine. That led to the chatter on social media – and on the Golf Channel, where analysts did not hold back on Rahm's performance.\n\n\"I’m gonna put that down as one of the biggest collapses – chokes of the year,\" Brandel Chamblee said. \"Probably right up there with Rory McIlroy coming down the stretch at the U.S. Open.\" — Scooby Axson\n\nSimone Biles scored a 14.133 to take second place behind Rebeca Andrade with two competitors left. Biles stepped out of bounds twice but stuck the landing on the Biles I. During warmups, she overcooked the Biles II and took a hard, awkward fall. She could be seen mouthing, \"I'm fine\" after. Biles tweaked her calf during qualifying on July 28 and has had it wrapped in competition since. — Nancy Armour, Tom Schad\n\nPARIS − Badminton is a hugely popular sport in both Taiwan and China. At the Paris Olympics, two incidents in as many days involving the sport's spectators reflects those place's uneasy rivalry on the world stage.\n\nThe incidents prompted Taiwan’s government on Monday to call on French authorities to launch an investigation. It followed a separate report on Friday that saw a spectator who was holding up a green banner that read, \"Taiwan go for it,\" removed from a Paris badminton venue during Taiwan player Chou Tien Chen's match against India’s Lakshya Sen.\n\nRead more details from Kim Hjelmgaard.\n\nPARIS — Chase Budinger’s Olympic dream has ended.\n\nBudinger and his partner Miles Evans fell in the Round of 16 of the men’s beach volleyball tournament Monday to Norway’s Anders Mol and Christian Sorum, the defending Olympic gold medalists. Norway took out the USA in straight sets, 21-16, 21-14.\n\nIn Tokyo three years ago, Mol and Sorum became the youngest duo to win the Olympic gold at 23 and 24 years old, respectively. The Americans gave them their best shot but the Norwegians were simply better.\n\nBudinger and Evans played solid defense early to stay in the first set. The former NBA player’s presence at the net was a factor, as he had two blocks and forced an attack error within the first 10 points. Norway went on a 3-0 run to force a USA timeout at 14-11 and it controlled the rest of the set, with Mol dialing up his own block (six block points), to keep the U.S. off balance.\n\nThe Americans enjoyed a 3-1 lead to start the second set, but they quickly saw that evaporate to a 8-4 deficit. An ace from Mol made it 12-7 and created a mountain too tall for the U.S. to climb. By the end of the match, sand stuck to the entire right side of Evans' body. He recorded nine digs and had 12 attack points. Budinger finished with four block points and eight points on attack. Both Norwegians finished with 11 attack points apiece.\n\nEvans and Budinger advanced to the knockout round by winning their \"lucky losers\" match two days earlier, as they won one of their three group play matches (the first). — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEmma Hunt of the United States is on to the speed finals at the Paris Games. Hunt bested French climber Manon Lebon in a head-to-head elimination climb with a time of 6.38 seconds. U.S teammate Piper Kelly was eliminated.\n\nOnly seven climbers who won their elimination heats and one lucky loser with the fastest time move on to finals on Wednesday. — Sandy Hooper\n\nSimone Biles and Jordan Chiles will be competing in the finals for the floor momentarily. Follow for the latest updates.\n\nThe Olympic record fell over and over and over again in the seeding heats of women’s speed climbing qualifications. But it was Poland’s Aleksandra Miroslaw who came out on top of the seeding round with a new world record time (that she set twice) first at 6.21 seconds and again at 6.06 seconds. American Emma Hunt finished seeding in second place with a time of 6.36 seconds. For the women, going sub-6 seconds is the equivalent of running a 100-meter sprint under 10 seconds.Head-to-head heats will begin shortly to wrap up women’s speed qualification. — Sandy Hooper\n\nTeam USA's Austen Smith and Vincent Hancock placed second during qualifying in the mixed team skeet competition and will get a chance to shoot for gold.Smith and Hancock hit 148 of 150 clays, one less than Italy's Diana Bacosi and Gabriele Rossetti's 149. The final round begins with the bronze medal match between China and India, followed immediately by the gold medal match.Dania Vizzi and Conner Prince of the United States placed sixth with their score of 144.\n\nIn a balance beam final that has seen multiple gymnasts fall, Simone Biles came off on her aerial series and scored a 13.100. This will be the first time, other than on uneven bars, that she has made a final and not won a medal.\n\nItaly's Alice Domato won gold while China's Zhou Yaqin took silver and Italy's Manila Esposito secured bronze in a final that saw multiple gymnasts fall during their routines.\n\nSuni Lee's right foot slipped off the balance beam at the end of her aerial series, causing her to split the beam and then take a hard fall onto the mat. The result was a score of 13.100. The 21-year-old appeared frustrated as she re-mounted the beam and finished her routine after the fall, and as she walked away afterwards. But then she started to gradually lighten after talking with her coach, Jess Graba, and Biles. Within moments, Lee was smiling and laughing again, perhaps remembering the breadth of what she's already achieved in Paris. After returning from a pair of kidney ailments, Lee won a second consecutive all-around Olympic medal – this time a bronze – to go with team gold and another bronze on uneven bars Sunday. — Nancy Armour, Tom Schad\n\nSport climbing is officially underway at Le Bourget. Despite the heat, the stands are packed to watch the men’s boulder semifinal and women’s speed qualifications. American Jesse Grupper completed the four boulder problems and finished in 18th place with a score of 18.9, and U.S. teammate Colin Duffy finished boulder in 10th place with 33.8 points. Neither American was able to find a top, but there were few to be had in the round.\n\n\"The style of bouldering is very flashy. You want to have cool moves for the crowd, but sometimes that can lead to an extra hard round like we saw today,\" said Duffy.\n\nThe men will compete in the lead portion of the event on Wednesday. Only the top eight finishers will move on to the finals. — Sandy Hooper\n\nAaliyah Butler and Alexis Holmes automatically qualified to the semifinals in the women’s 400 meters.\n\nButler finished behind Dominican Republic’s Marileidy Paulino to place second in the fifth heat of the 400.

Ireland’s Rhasidat Adeleke won the heat in 50.09.\n\nKendall Ellis, who won the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in the 400, didn’t automatically qualify to the next round. However, Ellis does have an opportunity to advance in the repechage round.\n\nThe women’s 400 is wide open in Paris. But we do know there will be a new Olympic champion. Defending Olympic champ Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas pulled up in the fourth heat of the 400 and didn’t finish. — Tyler Dragon\n\nIt'll be a crowded field Wednesday night when women's pole vaulting finalists gather for the medal competition at the Paris Games. That's because 20 of them qualified Monday morning, eight more than the format called for, due to a massive gridlock of a tie for the last available spot.\n\nKatie Moon was the lone qualifier for Team USA with a vault of 4.55, but the tie came at 4.40. Nine athletes tied for the 12th and final qualifying spot. Although other non-qualifiers also vaulted 4.40, the nine tied for the fewest attempts advanced.\n\nThe standard for automatic qualification to the medal rounds was 4.70, which no vaulter achieved. — Chase Goodbread\n\nIt was close, but Team USA diver Delany Schnell snuck into the 10-meter platform diving semifinals after finishing 17th in Monday’s prelims. The top-18 divers out of 29 total at Olympic Aquatics Centre in Saint-Denis, France moved on to keep their medal hopes alive.\n\nSchnell – who finished sixth in the women’s synchronized 10-meter platform at the Paris Olympics ‒ almost didn’t advance out of the five-round prelims after poor second and third dives, which left her ranked 25th.\n\nBut the 25-year-old two-time Olympian from Michigan recovered well on her final dive with an inward 3 1/2 somersaults in the tuck position and a 3.2 degree of difficulty to finish with a score of 278.15.\n\nFirst-time Olympian Daryn Wright ended prelims ranked 19th with a score of 272.25, just missing out on advancing. Wright – a 20-year-old diver for the Purdue Boilermakers – had a strong first round off a forward 3 1/2 somersaults in the pike position with a 3.0 degree of difficulty and was tied for eighth place. But she dropped to 22nd after the fourth round before finishing outside of the top 18 in her only Olympic event.\n\nChina’s defending Olympic gold and silver medalists, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, finished prelims ranked first and second, respectively. Quan’s top score was 421.25, while Chen in second posted a score of 382.15.\n\nSemifinals for the women’s 10-meter platform are set for 9 a.m. ET Monday, and finals are Tuesday also at 9 a.m. ET. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nPARIS – Stop the bullying, says Algerian boxer Imane Khelif.\n\nKhelif, who was dragged into controversy over gender eligibility criteria at the Paris Olympics, has spoken out for the first time since the Games began. She and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-Ting have been subjected to abuse on social media and inaccurate online speculation about their sexes even though the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said they both have met all criteria and that there’s no question they are women.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said in an interview with SNTV, according to The Associated Press. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nKhelif and Yu-Ting have advanced to the semifinals at the Olympics, ensuring they’ll win at least bronze medals. — Josh Peter\n\nTeam USA hurdler Rai Benjamin qualified for the men's 400m hurdles semifinals at the Paris Olympics on Monday, clocking a time of 48.82 seconds for a first-place finish in the opening heat.\n\nIn Olympic preliminary heats, the top three finishers in each of five races automatically qualify for the semifinals, as well as the next three fastest times, for a total of 18 semifinal qualifiers.\n\nBenjamin, 27, won silver in the event at the Tokyo Games in 2021, along with a gold in the men's 4x400 relay. He's not competing in the 4x400 relay in Paris, however, so the 400 hurdles is his lone chance at a medal.\n\nAlso qualifying for the semifinals for Team USA was CJ Allen, who ran 48.64 to finish second in Heat 3.\n\nThe semifinals for the 400m hurdles will be held Wednesday night, and medal races are scheduled for Friday. — Chase Goodbread\n\nPARIS — The United States team of Seth Rider, Taylor Spivey, Morgan Pearson and Taylor Knibb took silver in the mixed triathlon relay Monday at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. finished in a time of 1:25.40, 1/100th of a second behind gold-winning Germany and just ahead of bronze medal-winning Great Britain in a photo finish.\n\nGreat Britain, which won gold in 2020, led most of the race with Germany in second, but Knibb closed the gap for the U.S. with strong legs in swimming and biking in the final rotation before Germany's Laura Lindemann pulled ahead in the final moments of the run for the win. — Dave Birkett\n\nHere are some Olympic schedule highlights.
