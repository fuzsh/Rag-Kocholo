(Operator instructions)\n\nAs a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments' second quarter 2024 conference call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about among other matters, expected operating and financial results.\n\nThese statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filing.\n\nWe caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them. We will be also referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance.\n\nFor a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations. Please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental material available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\n\nJoining me on the call is our CEO, Cameron Bready, and our CFO, Joshua Whipple. Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nThanks, Winnie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with our performance for the second quarter, driven by consistent execution of our strategy, focused on being the worldwide partner of choice for commerce solutions.\n\nSpecifically, we achieved 6% adjusted net revenue growth or 7%, excluding the impact of the divestiture of Netspend consumer assets and delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% in the quarter. We also expanded adjusted operating margins 40 basis points as we continue to drive efficiency in our business, leveraging the scale position we enjoy in our core markets and realize synergy benefit from the evo acquisition.\n\nThere are a number of noteworthy highlights to cover this morning. Starting with Merchant Solutions, we delivered high single digit organic growth largely driven by our differentiated capabilities across our integrated software and point-of-sale businesses as market demand for embedded payments and commerce enablement solutions continues to accelerate.\n\nOur integrated business saw double-digit growth in the quarter, aided by continued strong booking trends and business development results. With new ISV partner signings up 30% year to date. Our ongoing success in identifying and signing new ISVs in this channel is partly attributable to our progressive payment facilitation solution or Pro fax, which we launched mid last year.\n\nActive merchants on this solution have increased 40% and average merchant volumes have improved 60% since the end of 2023. We remain confident in our competitive positioning in this market and are investing in our capabilities to ensure we preserve our leadership position.\n\nWe continue to focus on differentiating ourselves by one, our ability to meet the specific needs of our partners by leveraging the breadth and depth of our solutions into the expansive additional embedded commerce capabilities we can attach to the underlying payments' relationship.\n\nWith both new and existing integrated partners, we are seeing an improvement in the average annual revenue opportunity with new merchants as we focus on cross-selling commerce enablement solutions. This includes human capital management and payroll, loyalty and marketing analytics and customer engagement solutions as well as B2B software.\n\nSpeaking of B2B, it is worth noting that we continue to see increased demand for our B2B acceptance solutions as we further leverage the pay fabric platform, we acquired with EVO.\n\nOur proprietary integrations with some of the most widely used ERP environments in the market are critical, delivering the embedded frictionless automation necessary to improve process efficiencies for our customers, we saw more than a 50% increase in new ISV partnerships, leveraging our pay fabric capabilities in the second quarter as more B2B spend shifts to digital channels.\n\nIn our vertical markets businesses, we saw double digit growth in software bookings this quarter, with particular strength in education, real estate and healthcare. Notable wins include a new partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the US, which will leverage our full suite of capabilities across point of sale, my school books, cafeteria management, as well as our back-of-house solutions.\n\nWith this addition, we now have partnerships with the three largest school districts in the United States. Our real estate business signed a new partnership with the S communities, a leading provider of manufactured housing communities across the United States. And expanded existing relationships with community association solutions company associated asset management and commercial and residential real estate service provider, Tobin Capital Group.\n\nAlso this quarter, we launched a new residential payouts product to streamline and automate the return of security deposits, which we are already successfully cross-selling to customers. We also saw strong growth in our point-of-sale software business this quarter, adding roughly 3,500 new locations.\n\nDemand for our point-of-sale and embedded commerce solutions remained strong across the segments of the restaurant and retail verticals we target. Our solutions are designed to grow the customer's business, leveraging a common technology stack that enables customers to easily find add functionality as they expand.\n\nThis allows us to serve the small end of the SMB market and scale with merchants as they grow, while also addressing the more complex needs of quick-service restaurants and sports entertainment venues. To that end, we are excited to announce a new partnership with Diamond baseball holdings to serve as the official commerce technology partner for its Minor League Baseball franchises in the United States and Canada.\n\nWe are currently installed in 13 of these stadiums, and we expect to fully roll out our solutions at additional ballparks across Diamond's club portfolio before the 2025 season opens, we also signed new stadium partnerships with multiple UK football clubs, including Newcastle, Birmingham City, and Nottingham Forest during the quarter.\n\nAnd we are proud to have supported a major professional football championship across multiple stadiums, a Grand Slam Tennis Tournament and a major golf tournament with our point-of-sale and payment solutions in Europe this summer. We also went live this quarter with a leading parks and entertainment company and are now providing the food and beverage and retail point-of-sale solutions at its theme park locations in Florida.\n\nAnd we continue to see great momentum in foodservice management where we are the partner of choice to the three largest players in the space, which drove a 20% improvement in related bookings this quarter. In the restaurant and retail verticals in North America, where our POS software is targeted towards SMB and mid-market customers.\n\nIn addition to strong rooftop growth, we achieved a greater than 70% attach rate of our embedded commerce solutions with new customers. As just one example, we are seeing significant demand for loyalty and marketing tools with locations leveraging our customer engagement software increasing over 100% this quarter compared to the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, we are pleased with the market reception of our recently released next-generation point-of-sale software, including the improved user interface, our intuitive experience across IOS and Android-based devices and the mobile-first design that drives best-in-class omnichannel experiences for our merchants and their consumers.\n\nWhile still early days, these new offerings are benefiting our performance, and we expect a more meaningful contribution to revenue in 2025 as we gain scale, we also continue to see good momentum, expanding our point-of-sale offerings into markets outside of the US.\n\nIt's worth highlighting that we have begun piloting our point-of-sale offering in Germany and anticipate a full commercial launch next month. We also remain on track to bring our point-of-sale software to key additional international markets, including Mexico, Ireland, Poland, Austria and Romania, over the next 12 to 15 months.\n\nIn Germany, our Commerce Bank joint venture commerce global pay went live this quarter and we are off to a fantastic start. While we are just beginning to leverage Commerce Bank's relationships with roughly 26,000 corporate clients and almost 11 million private and small business customers. We are already seeing strong lead generation and substantial opportunities to further digitize the payment experience, while also allowing us to build a scale business in this attractive market.\n\nLastly, we are continuing to see strong demand for our pan-European solutions. Notably, we are realizing attractive growth in the EV charging sector and recently signed a partnership with a major European energy provider to support the expansion of public charging solutions throughout Central Europe.\n\nWe also made two small tuck-in acquisitions in Europe this quarter to continue to improve our strategic positioning. The first was the acquisition of take payments, a small provider of payment solutions to SMB merchants in the UK, take payments say, serves to meaningfully diversify and expand our direct distribution capability and demand generation solutions as the UK market continues to evolve beyond traditional bank-based referral channels.\n\nIt also provides attractive opportunities for us to cross-sell our commerce enablement solutions into its customer base. This investment allows us to reorient our distribution approach in the UK market with leading demand and capabilities and represents opportune timing as we are starting to see some signs of stability in the UK market more broadly.\n\nWe have a strong pipeline of new business here with the hospitality and unattended verticals, notable bright spots. Including our recent win in (inaudible) hotel business in the UK. The second acquisition at the end of the quarter was with an early-stage technology development company that we were previously partnering with in Europe to drive our terminal on mobile offerings.\n\nGiven the strong demand we have seen for our terminal on mobile offerings and the expected long-term importance, they will play to our point of sale plans. It was strategically important for us to bring this technology in-house to unify our offerings globally and to control the entire value stack, enabling our solutions.\n\nMoving to Issuer Solutions, we continue to see strong execution across our business. We completed two large conversions this quarter, which in combination with existing customer growth, drove a healthy increase in accounts on file sequentially.\n\nWe also have a near record implementation pipeline of more than 65 million accounts in 7 active LOIs. Further, we're having ongoing success in cross-selling our value-added service solutions and completed 30 product implementations for existing clients this quarter across our fraud, virtual card and communications platform.\n\nFrom a macro perspective and similar to what you heard from our FI partners in the networks, we saw a modest deceleration in transaction volumes this quarter, which was largely driven by commercial card activity. We recently renewed our multi-decade issuer relationship with NatWest spanning both its consumer and commercial portfolios, cementing our position with one of the largest and most active clients in Europe.\n\nNatWest recently announced its acquisition of Sainsbury Bank, further highlighting the importance of our strategy to align ourselves with market share winners. We look forward to opportunities to continue to expand our partnership with them in the future.\n\nAdditionally, we have now launched our partnership with outpace a leading global travel technology company, owned by Amadeus, providing Issuer Solutions technology for its platforms across Europe. Outpaces our first fintech customer operating in our AWS cloud environment in Europe with many other clients in the pipeline.\n\nMost importantly, we also continue to make progress on our issuer modernization program and remain on track to complete the development of our client-facing applications this year. We have already initiated customer pilots and continue to expect commercial launch next year. Through modernization, we meaningfully increase our addressable market by broadening our opportunity set to include mid-market and smaller banks in addition to new geographies.\n\nOur investments also drive greater enablement capabilities for our clients and allow our leading applications and solutions to be more easily consumable by fintech’s. We're developing new use cases around cards, shifting to B2B, we are seeing good trends in new bookings for our AP automation software in our core mid-market segment, while virtual card spend continues to ramp.\n\nAdditionally, we signed several notable new customers for our employer solutions, including relationships with Terra Staffing Group and Rainbow pizza, which operates nearly 50 Domino's locations throughout Texas. We also renewed partnerships with AMC Theatres and Cracker Barrel.\n\nBefore I turn the call over to Josh, I would like to highlight the appointment of Bob Cortopassi as the President and Chief Operating Officer of Global Payments. Bob is a proven growth oriented leader and operator, as well as a trusted colleague with an exceptional track record of managing key businesses across our organization, during his 12-year tenure with the company.\n\nMost recently, Bob served as our Senior Executive Vice President and President of International and Vertical markets for our Merchant Solutions business and previously led our integrated business for nearly a decade. I look forward to partnering with Bob, and I'm confident in the role he will play in our company's continued future success. Josh?\n\nJoshua Whipple\n\nThanks, Cameron. Our solid financial performance for the second quarter was consistent with our expectations and reflects continued strong execution across our business. Despite ongoing macro-economic uncertainty, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.32 billion for the quarter, an increase of 6% from the prior year or 7% excluding the impact of the Netspend divestiture.\n\nOur reported adjusted net revenue includes a roughly 50 basis point headwind from adverse foreign currency exchange rates. Relative to the second quarter of 2023, adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 45.2%, and we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.93, an increase of 12% compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nTaking a closer look at performance by segment Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.8 billion for the second quarter, reflecting growth of 8%. This includes less than a point of contribution from the acquisition of take payments, which offset the roughly 50 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates during the period.\n\nOur US business delivered high single digit growth in the quarter as we continued to benefit from our software centric strategy with both our integrated payments and point of sale businesses delivering double-digit growth for the period.\n\nWe also saw strength in our vertical markets portfolio with our real estate, higher education and health care solutions being notable bright spots. Outside of the US, we achieved mid-single digit organic growth in Europe with notable strength across our faster-growth geographies, including Poland and Greece.\n\nWe were also pleased to see trends start to stabilize in the United Kingdom. Separately, our LATAM business realized double-digit growth as we continue to benefit from the strong secular payment trends in Mexico. This performance was partially offset by ongoing weakness in the macro-economic environment in Asia Pacific.\n\nWe delivered adjusted operating margin of 48.8% in the merchant segment, an increase of 30 basis points, reflecting ongoing sequential improvements since completing the acquisition of EVO Payments last year as expected. We are executing against our synergy plans related to the EVO transaction and remain on track to achieve $135 million in run rate expense synergies within two years.\n\nAnd integration expenses are continuing to trend lower. As we have seen over the last several quarters. Issuer Solutions produced adjusted net revenue of $527 million, reflecting growth of over 4%. This includes a roughly 50 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates during the period.\n\nThis quarter, we added 8 million traditional accounts on file sequentially for nearly 50 million accounts year over year as we continue to benefit from ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline. In addition to account growth with our existing FI customers.\n\nWe've had an especially busy year with new client implementations. Year to date, we have completed nine implementations with over 8 million accounts. I'm especially proud of our team delivered these on time and with outstanding quality. We have six more implementations to complete for the remainder of the year.\n\nIssuer transactions increased mid-single digits compared to the second quarter of 2023, which was a modest deceleration from the prior quarter. This was largely driven by softer commercial volumes as businesses taking a more cautious approach to spending given the overall level of macro-economic uncertainty.\n\nWe also saw a slight deceleration in consumer transaction growth sequentially, similar to what was reported by the networks and our FI partners, focusing on our B2B portfolio, our AP automation software continued to see healthy growth in the core mid-market segment on a normalized basis in the second quarter.\n\nAnd while our PayCard solution is seeing some headwinds from softer employment trends due to the macro environment, we are encouraged by the active new sales pipeline we have in the business. Issuer Solutions delivered adjusted operating margin of 46.8% an increase of 10 basis points compared to the prior year as we continued to drive efficiencies in the business.\n\nThis was achieved despite facing a difficult comparison. As you may recall, issuer margins expanded 300 basis points during the second quarter of 2023, as we pivoted the business to more technology enablement and away from lower-margin managed services offerings. We've now lapped those related margin benefits.\n\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of approximately 680 million, which is 25% higher than the prior year period. This also represents a roughly 91% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow up from approximately 80% last year.\n\nIs worth noting that adjusted free cash flow this quarter included a relatively small positive adjustment related to settlement timing for the period as the second quarter again ended on a weekend. As it has for the prior three quarters, with the third quarter ending on a week day, we expect a larger impact from the settlement pre-funding we saw in the back half of last year to reverse.\n\nWe invested $179 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital spending to be around $670 million or roughly 7% of revenue in 2024, consistent with our long-term targets. Further, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for roughly $100 million in the quarter.\n\nOur leverage position was just under 3.5 times at the end of the second quarter, and we remain on track for our leverage level to be in the low threes by year end, consistent with our long-term targets. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we have approximately $3.6 billion of available liquidity. Our total indebtedness is approximately 97% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.37%.\n\nTurning to the outlook, we are pleased with how our business is positioned as we begin the second half of the year, we continue to expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $9.17 billion to $9.30 billion, reflecting growth of 6% to 7% over 2023. This now includes an expectation for foreign currency exchange rates to be a headwind of up to 75 basis points in the second half of the year.\n\nWe still expect annual adjusted operating margin to expand up to 50 basis points for 2024, driven by the benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement. Partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization.\n\nTo provide color at the segment level, we continue to expect our merchant business to report adjusted net revenue growth of 9%-plus for the full year. This remains consistent with our prior outlook, despite our expectation that unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates will now be a headwind in the back half of the year.\n\nWe expect these headwinds to be offset by the inclusion of the acquisition of take payments that Cameron discussed. Which we expect to contribute roughly a point of growth for the second half of the year. We also continue to expect up to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the merchant business in 2024, with expansion improving in the back half compared to the first half performance as EVO synergy realization ramps.\n\nMoving to Issuer Solutions, we continue to anticipate adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the full year compared to 2023. However, given the headwind, we now expect from foreign currency exchange rates and the modest deceleration we're seeing in commercial card transactions, we now expect to be at the low end of this range.\n\nWe still anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 50 basis points. Moving to a couple of non-operating items. We expect net interest expense to be $500 million this year. And for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%, which is consistent with our prior outlook.\n\nPutting it all together, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $11.54 to $11.70, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2023.\n\nAnd finally, our outlook continues to reflect the potential for a slightly more tempered economic environment in the second half of 2020.\n\nFor now, I'll turn the call back over to Cameron.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nThank you, Josh. Moving forward, we remain committed to sharpening our strategic focus and simplifying our business to position Global Payments as the partner of choice for commerce solutions in the markets that we believe have the highest potential.\n\nWe are finalizing the review of our business that began earlier this year. That work has involved a thoughtful and methodical assessment of our assets, which has helped us to identify meaningful opportunities to better align our organization to drive sustainable growth.\n\nOver the last few decades, we have built one of the leading global payments technology companies as we move into the next phase of growth. We're simplifying our portfolio and streamlining our operations to deliver product lead customer centric solutions, while continuing to emphasize service as a key differentiator for our business.\n\nUltimately, we expect executing on these initiatives will allow us to gain share free up capital to invest in innovation and deliver sustainable performance through the cycle.\n\nWith regard to providing you with more details on the changes we are making at our Investor Conference to be held on Tuesday, September 24, in New York City. Winnie?\n\nWinnie Smith\n\nThanks, Cameron. Before we begin our question-and-answer session. I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue.\n\nThank you, operator. We'll now go to questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator instructions)\n\nRamsey El-Assal, Barclays.\n\nRamsey Clark El-Assal\n\nThanks for taking my questions. Given this sort of unstable macro environment. Could you give us your latest thoughts with the inclusion of EVO and everything else you've got going on in your business about the split between discretionary and nondiscretionary volumes in merchant, how much of the portfolio is exposed to credit versus debit and things like that?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nHey, Ramsey, good morning. It's Cameron and I'll maybe comment on that. My own perspective on the discretionary, non-discretionary split, it's a bit arbitrary these days. I think what's discretionary to one person may be non-discretionary to another and vice versa. I think we've always looked at our portfolio as being very well diversified across what have been traditionally considered discretionary non-discretionary verticals. And I think even post depot, we're still in a position where as I look at the mix of business we have today, I think we're very well diversified.\n\nWe're very well diversified geographically. I think around the globe, we're very well diversified across vertical markets. We're very well diversified kind of across revenue streams as well. So as I think about the overall mix of the business, particularly against the backdrop of, again, a somewhat uncertain macro environment. I remain very confident in the resilience and durability of the model that we've built, largely on the back of a business that's pretty well diversified, again, across different types of payments businesses with our merchant and issuer mix as well as different verticals, different geographies, et cetera.\n\nSo I think the mix of business we have is good, and it positions us well for what the macro environment we may face as we continue to move forward.\n\nRamsey Clark El-Assal\n\nThanks and a follow-up for me. You called out Profac is being an important driver new ISV signings. Can you comment a little more on how Pro fat increases this sort of ISV TAM for you guys types of clients? Are you now signing with Profac that you weren't before. Is it just merchant industrial client size or is there some other axes to look at it?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, it's a good question, Ramsey. The way I think about the Profac business, is it largely fills a need in the market for clients who need some payments facilitation capabilities, largely around the onboarding experience that delivers to merchants and some of the funding flexibility that comes through payment facilitation and capabilities.\n\nBut they are not scaled enough to be able to take on all the responsibilities of being at payment facilities, particularly as it relates to underwriting risk management, et cetera. So it fills a niche in the market for, I would say, on average, probably smaller SVs need some payment facilitation capabilities, but really aren't in a position to take on all the burdens of that themselves.\n\nAnd I think that's sort of middle of the ground solution and we've been able to offer has been very well received by the market and it does kind of open up a new area where I think before, we had not been as successful in signing kind of ISV partners.\n\nSo I think what I'm most pleased about as it relates to the integrated businesses, is obviously, the ongoing sort of consistent growth that we're seeing in that channel. But the continued investment in capabilities to make sure that we sustain our leadership position in that market and our ability to sort of tailor our offerings to meet specific needs of ISV customers in the marketplace and compete very effectively against other solution providers.\n\nRamsey Clark El-Assal\n\nPerfect thanks.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nThanks Ramsey.\n\nOperator\n\nJason Kupferberg, Bank of America.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nThank you, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about merchant volume growth to start saw came in at 6%. I think organically that was maybe a tick down of a couple of points, if I'm not mistaken. Can you talk a little bit about what maybe drove that decel?\n\nI'm guessing leap year was probably worth a point, but also looked like there was a little bit of decoupling of the volume versus the revenue growth, they had kind of been on top of each other for a period of time. So I don't know if that was mix related. I appreciate any thoughts on that.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, I'll make a couple of comments I would say it was declined sequentially about a point. If you look at our sort of revenue ex tax payment, it was up roughly the kind of 7.5% organically year over year, volumes up six last quarter, it was, I think, 8 and 7 and so, generally I would say a pretty consistent trend that we've seen sequentially Q1 to Q2.\n\nI think to your point, we probably had a little bit of an impact. The macro, obviously, other networks and competitors have reported and generally seen the same trends as it relates to the overall volume environment and macro environment more broadly. So I don't think that's really unique to us.\n\nTake payments delivers on the balance sheet of slightly more revenue than it does volume contribution. So I think net we're sort of still within a point of each other as it relates to organic revenue growth and volume that we saw on the business.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then on merchant margins up 30 bps in the quarter, that was a bit better. I think the guide in the guide, the guide was for flat, so wondering what drove that. And maybe if you can just speak to kind of your confidence level in the full year guide. I know we're still talking about up to 30 bps. But we feel like the probability of getting all the way to 30 is higher based on where we are in the year. And what you see in front of you in terms of the incremental cost synergies from EVO?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, Jason, it's a good question. Maybe I'll start and I'll ask Josh to jump in. I would just say overall, we're very pleased with the margin expansion we saw in the merchant business. And I would just note that's despite absorbing take payments that comes in at roughly half of our margin today.\n\nSo yeah, we did perform a little bit better than we expected in the second quarter from a margin expansion perspective in the merchant business. I think it largely reflects kind of continued strong execution and obviously, some of the growth trends we're seeing in aspects of the business that have attractive margin profiles for us.\n\nSo I think overall, really, really pleased with the outcome there, as I said, and we grew at 30 basis points despite absorbing take payments. It comes in at it again, about half of that margin.\n\nThe last point I would make is we're still targeting 30 basis points for the year. Our language is up to 30, but just to be very clear, we're targeting 30 for the year, and I'll let Josh, maybe comment a little bit about what we see in the back half.\n\nJoshua Whipple\n\nYeah, Jason. So as we think about merchant margins, what I would say is that with the EVO integration, we continue to see synergies flow and as I mentioned, I think in '23, we realize 25% of $135 million. And this year, we expect go ahead and realize 50% in the back half of the year, we expect merchant margins to be approximately it expand 50 basis points.\n\nAnd that gets you candidly that the up 30 basis points for the full year. So we're pretty pleased with how healthy the margin expansion looks like for the overall merchant business.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nOkay, I assume that would skew a little bit towards Q4 versus Q3, just as we think about cadence that fair, just as synergies on that.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, that's fair.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nJames Eugene Faucette, Morgan Stanley.\n\nJames Eugene Faucette\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Wanted to touch on the ISV channel. It seemed like you'd made some good progress and that kind of thing. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about the growth potential there and what dynamics in that segment may be different than what you see in the rest of your merchant business generally?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah. I think it's a fair question. I'll just start by saying, look, that's where the market is going. We've talked for many years about the intersection of software and payments. And obviously, we've worked very hard to position our business at that intersection because more and more we see merchant clients, particularly in the SMB space that we serve, making payments decisions largely based on sort of the underlying software technology that they're using to run their business.\n\nAnd obviously that is true in restaurant and retail, where point-of-sale is now kind of the mode of competition for payment acceptance in those key vertical market from a consumer standpoint -- spend standpoint, excuse me, struggling to get that out.\n\nBut we also see it across other vertical markets as well, which is why obviously, we've been leaning into our integrated strategy over the course of many years. We've leaned into our vertical market software strategy over the course of many years. And obviously, we're investing more in point-of-sale capabilities because that's where the market is going.\n\nSo we think about long-term trends, obviously, particularly within SMB, as I mentioned before, it's all geared around payment decisions being made through the software that these businesses are using to kind of run their business day in and day out and making sure we're well positioned either with our ISV partners or through our own software to continue to benefit from those trends is a core part of how we think about our strategy in the merchant business going forward.\n\nJames Eugene Faucette\n\nGot it. I appreciate that. And then in the press release, you talked about looking for efficiencies and the like and clearly that's something you're probably always doing. But is there anything incremental that you're looking at in the second half of the year? And how much are you thinking about that if at all, to contribute to the margin targets -- and margin improvement targets you have for this year? And how should we think about any spillover into '25? Thanks a lot.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, it's a really good question. And let me start just by saying, obviously, we have our investor conference coming up in September, which we're very much looking forward to. And we're going to lay all this out, I think in what some might describe as excruciating detail at that point in time.\n\nBut as I step back and think about it, we see pretty meaningful opportunities to streamline and simplify our business internally. And we think that those opportunities are going to unlock a fair amount of value that we're going to be able to redeploy in our business to continue to invest in growth oriented initiatives as well as continue to improve turns in our business, certainly returns on invested capital in our business.\n\nSo these are meaningful enough opportunities that we certainly think they're worth pursuing, and we intend to lay all of that out for you in the September investor conference. As it relates to '24 none of that's really reflected in our '24 outlook.\n\nI would say the back half of the year, the margin expansion targets are largely geared towards what's happening in the business today and most of the expectations as it relates to sort of the opportunities we see to streamline, simplify and unlock value. Those are sort of '25 and beyond kind of benefits that we would expect to be able to realize. And again, we'll share more of those details as we get to our investors.\n\nOperator\n\nDarrin Peller, Wolfe Research.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nThanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter. I wanted to touch on the underlying drivers of the merchant business because -- so Cameron, if you could just maybe revisit and break it down by obviously, the ISV business, the verticals, the software business you have.\n\nAnd then maybe just the businesses in terms of the growth and the margin profile it's contributing. Just noticing that margins obviously outperformed in the merchant side in the quarter, even despite what you said, which is take payments coming on, as I think diluted margin, you were able to offset that and outperform on margins. So I guess we'd love to hear more about what's driving the strength in the merchant side of the business to sustain and the margin profile of each of those businesses that's allowing you to be?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, maybe I'll start and I'll ask Josh to share a few perspectives as well. And I'll maybe hedge my comments a little bit Darrin, just by saying a lot of this is good fodder for our conversation as we get into September, and we sort of frame up the business the way we think about it as a go-forward matter.\n\nBut clearly, you laid out a few key sort of things that probably are worth spending a little time on this morning. So as we think about the business today, obviously, we, as I mentioned before, are very focused on the merchant business positioning as it relates to the intersection of software and payments.\n\nWe continue to think that is the future of the SMB space and the markets that are core to us today, most specifically the US, and that's going to continue to be the trend of evolution in markets outside of the US over a longer period of time.\n\nSo our ISV strategy, our own software strategy, and maybe most particularly, just given the relevance of retail and restaurant from a consumer spend perspective to our business, our point-of-sale software strategies are really core to where we want to drive the business over a longer period of time.\n\nThose are healthy technology-led businesses. They are continuing to grow, and they're continuing to scale, and they're continuing to contribute to the overall margin expansion we're seeing in the business.\n\nSo I think that's as we step back and think about sort of where are we going, it's largely driven by our investments in those areas, our ability to continue to differentiate through technology, and obviously generate margins and scale those businesses in a way that contribute to the overall rate of margin expansion for our business.\n\nAs we think about more traditional payments markets, they may not grow at the same pace as our technology-enabled or software-oriented businesses, but they generally have stable growth rates and they have higher margins.\n\nThose margins may not drive the same sort of margin expansion for our business overall, but they contribute a lot of cash that obviously allows us to invest in the more growth orienting -- oriented and margin expanding sort of elements of the business so that we can get to that overall mix of margins that we're targeting and margin expansion that we're targeting for the business.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is markets internationally that we're growing nicely as well. We're continuing to scale our businesses as well, and that is contributing to sort of margin expansion in our overall kind of emerging business.\n\nAnd then lastly, I would just say, we benefit from being a large-scale player. Obviously, we are able to spread those fixed costs across a large global scaled merchant acquiring businesses. And as we think about the business going forward, and I talked about this before, we're very focused on ensuring that we're sort of leaning into markets where we are a scale player today or have clear line of sight to becoming a scale player in markets that were not a scale player today, and we don't have clear line of sight to becoming a scale player over time.\n\nI think we need to think hard about whether we should be in those markets, and that's been a big part of what we've been looking at as part of our strategic review. So more to come on that in September. But I think, hopefully, that gives you some sense as to how we think about it at a macro perspective.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nWell, that's really helpful. Can I just ask one quick follow-up on financials for a minute. The free cash did come in strong -- better as we had hoped. I think you had about 81% or -- 80% to 81% conversion of GAAP versus what looks like 90%-plus adjusted conversion.\n\nAnd I know a lot of it is timing dynamics on working capital. So just revisit that for a minute. And just maybe reiterate if you still feel good about the timing, working capital dynamics helping improve as we keep going through the year even better from these levels?\n\nJoshua Whipple\n\nYeah, Darrin, we fully expect to go ahead and convert out of the 100% this year, less obviously the R&D tax credit, which is about 5 points. But I think that the big change that you saw on a year-over-year basis is that the growth in the business and operating income, lower interest expense and a change in working capital.\n\nBut again this is something that we continue to go ahead and manage very, very closely. And we feel confident with regard to our initial guide of 100% conversion excluding the R&D tax credit for the full year.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nAnd Darrin, it's Cameron. I'll just add a couple of things. We provided a little more sort of granularity around our reporting of adjusted free cash flow that we think will be helpful.\n\nWe broken out customer deposits and we provided a little bit of historical data as it relates to taxes that we paid around gains from the dispositions of Netspend and our gaming business, which I think it's just helpful for historical context.\n\nBut as we think about the go-forward, we're highly focused on free cash flow and obviously our conversion rates in the business and improving our quality of earnings and our quality of adjusted free cash flow. And I think you start to see that play out in Q2, and we were really pleased with the overall result.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nIt's really helpful, Cameron. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nAndrew Schmidt, Citi.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nHey, Cameron, he Josh, good results here. Thanks for taking my questions. Just speaking of the legacy parts of the business, could you just talk about the direct sales channel, where that's targeted today, sales efficiency, and the strategy there in terms of just the direct sales efforts? Thanks a lot guys.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, good morning. And maybe I'll just start by saying the term legacy sort of makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up a little bit. We don't think about the business in that context. We have what we would characterize as sort of more traditional go-to-market strategies in our business, and you called out specifically our direct distribution here in the US market.\n\nWe've been working for some time and I think we're accelerating our investments and plans to really start to reorient, that distribution as much as possible toward selling more technology-enabled -- technology enabled solutions.\n\nSo we have opened up our integrated business more and allowed our direct distribution channels to begin to sell integrated. And we're leaning into that. We are building by really reorienting a portion of our direct distribution channel today to developing a point-of-sale software sales team. They just focus on selling point-of-sale software solutions directly into the market.\n\nBut as it relates to the overall direct distribution channel, it remains a very productive channel. They continue to drive year over year growth in new bookings. They continue to be very effective in terms of selling traditional payment capabilities into the market, more of what they're selling today, obviously are omnichannel solutions and have some more complexity associated with them versus selling traditional bricks on a counter, which is where the business was kind of back in the mid to late teens.\n\nBut as time progresses, we are very focused on continuing to reorient distribution around where we see the best growth opportunities in the business and that's clearly around our technology-enabled strategies, both the ISV channel and directly selling our software capabilities where we think we can build direct distribution teams around that.\n\nSo that's really the future of the business, and we'll continue to invest against reorienting distribution in that manner over a longer period of time.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nGot it. Thank you, Cameron. I hear on the word legacy, that makes a lot of sense. Just on the outlook for the merchant segment, obviously layering take payments, it sounds like a little bit more of moderate macro assumption there. Is there anything else, is it just moderate macro or are there any other puts and takes to considering the outlook? Thanks a lot guys.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nI'd say the main take is just FX. We kind of went into the year expecting FX to be a little bit better in the back half of the year than we're currently forecasting. It's obviously very volatile. And as I've said many times, if I could predict what FX rates are going to be, I probably wouldn't be sitting in this seat might be doing more leisurely things. But be that as it may.\n\nWe currently expect FX in the back half of the year to largely offset the contribution from take payments. So hopefully, we're wrong on that assumption. But I think that's a prudent assumption for the time being, and that's kind of what we baked into the outlook.\n\nSo I think beyond that, the rest of the puts and takes are relatively small and on the margin. So obviously confident in reiterating and reaffirming the guide today. And I'll just let Josh provide a little bit more context as well.\n\nJoshua Whipple\n\nYeah, so I think as you think about the second half of the year, we still expect margin growth in the 7% to 8% range. And as Cameron, you mentioned this includes roughly a point contribution from Take payments, which will largely offset FX. And then for the full year, we still expect merchant revenue to be in the 9%-plus range. So we feel pretty good about that.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nGot it. Thank you guys very much.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nThank you.\n\nJoshua Whipple\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nVasundhara Govil, KBW.\n\nVasundhara Govil\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. I guess, Cameron, you talked about the good momentum you are seeing in new partner signing in the ISV channel. I was just curious if revenue share agreements or economics related to those new partners, how they have evolved over historical trends? Just any color on that would be helpful?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah. I mean, I've said -- and good morning, I've said over the last couple of years, we've obviously seen rev shares sort of drift up over the course of time as you've seeing more competition in the integrated space. But I'd say over the last year to 18 months, we've seen probably a more constructive competitive environment than we had seen in the previous 12 to 24 months.\n\nJust as cost of capital has come up and sort of competitors need to be a little bit more rational with their own economics and how they approach these relationships, I think the competitive environment from a rev share perspective has been fairly constructive, certainly for the last year or so. And our expectation is we remain fairly constructive over a period of time.\n\nIn our experiences, if you have the right solutions, the right capabilities, you can partner with ISVs in the right way. You need to be competitive from a rev share perspective, but you don't necessarily have to be at the high watermark of rev shares.\n\nAnd we still see competitors offering fairly aggressive rev shares in some circumstances, but that's typically where they don't have a lot to offer the ISV outside of that sort of pure payments relationship.\n\nAnd one of the ways we've been able to differentiate ourselves is obviously the breadth and depth of capabilities that we think we bring across traditional integrated, payment facilitation and the middle of the road sort of Profac model that we have, but also the breadth and depth of commerce enablement, embedded commerce solutions that we can deliver, which enriches the experience for us and the ISV broadens the base of revenue that we're able to share, on a rev share basis.\n\nAnd I think makes the overall partnership and relationship more constructive for them and obviously more constructive for us. And that's a big part of why we've been able to remain, I think, fairly well positioned competitively from a rev share perspective, without always, again, having to meet the high watermark that may be out there around a pure rev share on payments alone.\n\nVasundhara Govil\n\nThat's helpful. And we're obviously all very looking forward to the Investor Day sort of any preview into what type of, additional disclosure or new KPIs, perhaps that we could at the Investor Day?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah. I've been pretty -- it's a fair question. And I've been pretty transparent, I think last quarter and obviously this quarter, I'll just reiterate, we're obviously very focused on providing a full sort of update on where we see the business going as a strategic matter going forward, where we're going to focus on attention, our efforts and our investment in a big part, I think, of any strategy is also what does that mean you're not going to do.\n\nAnd so we look forward to giving a pretty fulsome update around our strategy and where we see the business going forward, how we are going to frame up the business kind of around that strategy. The critical initiatives that we are pursuing to continue to advance that strategy and execute against it and then, of course, the KPIs and metrics that we're looking at to judge our own performance as to how we are gaining ground against the key initiatives that we think are important to achieving the strategy that we have.\n\nSo all that we would expect to be able to frame up for you at our investor conference. And then that will be coupled with a conversation around our efforts to continue to streamline and simplify our business. And how we are organizing ourselves internally, some of that the moves we are making to ensure we have the most nimble, agile business we can, that we remain very customer centric in our product approach.\n\nWe continue to build differentiated product and capabilities that we think compete favorably in the market. And then we're able to -- then coupled that with further differentiation around the service experience that our clients are able to enjoy from us.\n\nAnd so we look forward to being able to share more around that streamlining and simplifying effort and what we think then that we'll unlock from a value creation standpoint and how we'll redeploy that in some areas that we want to invest in the business, but also how that will flow through to drive better returns as we look forward in time, all of against the backdrop of our efforts to think again, simplify our business, improve our quality of earnings, be very focused on free cash flow generation, and driving better return on capital in our business as we move forward.\n\nVasundhara Govil\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nBryan Bergin, TD Cowen.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nHi, good morning, thank you. I wanted to ask on the embedded commerce success, it really sounds like that's clicked here specifically calling out the 70%-plus attach of those solutions with new customers. Can you just dig in a bit more on the drivers of that success, are there aspects of the selling strategy that have evolved to really drive this?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, it's a really good question. I think what we've generally seen is we've done a better job of finding ways and encouraging our sales professionals to find opportunity to attach other value-added services to the pure payment experience with our clients. As I mentioned in my response to the integrated question, clearly, that has been attracted to our integrated partners.\n\nA lot of the commerce enablement or embedded commerce solutions, we can deliver really resonate with them that makes their own software more competitive in the marketplace. It gives them another channel, I think, to help differentiate their solutions. And obviously, it improves kind of the rev shares and revenue opportunity that they see through the partner with -- partnership with us. So a lot of our ISV partners are very focused on continuing to lean into our embedded commerce solutions and finding ways to distribute those through their channels in partnership with us.\n\nAnd on the direct side, again, we're seeing much the same. I called out specifically around point of sale, what we're seeing very strong attach rates for customer loyalty, particularly for our card-linked loyalty solutions around our point-of-sale businesses. We're also seeing, again good strong attach rates around the cross-selling efforts for human capital management and payroll.\n\nSo I would say across the board, a strategy that we really set out to pursue a few years ago around finding more ways to wrap value around the payment experience, which is really where we started has continued to evolve in more of this and better commerce strategy and our ability to attach more commerce enablement solutions around the pure payments capabilities we're delivering to clients and it's just further enriching the relationships that we have with our clients.\n\nIt's making us more relevant to them. It's allowing us to differentiate better in the marketplace. And I think, again, it will be a core part of how we think about driving our strategy as we move forward in time. And I think obviously a big focus for us is where are the areas that we want to invest from a commerce enablement and or embedded commerce solution to continue to drive that richer experience and more differentiated offering relative to where our competitors are.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then good improvement on free cash flow here in the quarter. I guess following you've earmarked for debt reduction, as you consider uses of cash, you expect to maintain this kind of level of repo in the second half. Are you balancing that against anything else near term M&A pipeline that might be attractive?\n\nJoshua Whipple\n\nNo, look, we're very focused on getting back to our 3 times targeted leverage point in the back half of the year. We expect to go ahead and pay down close to $1 billion in debt just from free cash flow. So we'll continue to go ahead and delever to the balance of the year, and we expect to get right back to that low three mark that we talked about previously.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nAll right. Thanks.\n\nJoshua Whipple\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nDave Koning, Baird.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thank you, nice job.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nThanks Dave.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nOne other way to ask here -- yeah, in one way to ask the margin question, for many quarters until EVO, you were generating kind of 50% to 65% incremental margin on revenue growth and then it stepped down to like the 40%, which made sense. And now this quarter it stepped back into the range as one of the best incrementals in many quarters. Is that 50% to 65% the right way to kind of think about it longer term?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, I think that's probably a fair way to continue to think about it. We talked over the course of the last few quarters, just around the acquisition of EVO and obviously that rebased margins lower and we had a fair amount of work to do, I would think to shore up the EVO environment to make sure that was operating at our standard, particularly in markets that we didn't overlap with EVO where we're having to rely on their technology.\n\nAnd that was somewhat offsetting the synergy benefits that we were realizing over that period as well. But as we move forward, I think Q2 is really representative by-and-large of kind of where we see the business as we move forward. We still have some more synergies to realize around EVO. And we're still investing obviously in the business as well.\n\nBut we were pleased with that 30 basis points a margin expansion in the second quarter. We're targeting 30 basis points for the full year as we talked about before, as Josh mentioned, that reflects a little bit of uptick in the back half just to get the overall to 30 basis points for the full year.\n\nAnd I think then that gives us kind of a good jumping off point heading into 2025 and kind of really reflects where the business is going. But also know, Dave and I know you appreciate this. We've had that conversation directly. Our margin profile is now close to 50% in merchant.\n\nSo it is on average a little easier to expand margins 50 basis points to 70 basis points a year when you're in the low 40%. And it is when you're not in 40%. So that math is not lost on you, I know. But as we think about the business, we're very, very focused on continuing to drive margin expansion in the merchant segment and I think we're well positioned to do that. And I think Q2 just sort of gives you a demonstration of our ability to do that.\n\nBut more importantly, it's reflecting what we said was going to happen over the last several quarters as we continue to execute against synergies as we've made the investments we need to make sure of technology environments. We're getting the business sequentially continually back to sort of par post EVO. And now we're seeing expansion and obviously, we're pleased with that outcome.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nYeah. Great, thanks. And maybe just one follow-up quality of earnings, you highlighted several times. Merger and integration costs around the lowest in five years this quarter, does that continue to go down? And maybe when are we going to be at a point of just no more to add backs?\n\nJoshua Whipple\n\nYeah, look. So I think we've shown a real positive trend as it relates integration expenses over the last three to four quarters and they've continued to go ahead and trend lower as we said they would. And if you think about it, we're now about a 1.5 year into the integration, we said that EVO, and we said that we would complete that two years out, which would be in March of 2025 timeframe where we'd expect to go ahead and achieve $135 million in run rate synergies.\n\nSo again, I would -- I think you can fully expect the integration expenses to continue to go ahead and trend lower through the balance of the year as we get closer to that time period that we called out when we initially announced the transaction. And I also would say Dave, if you look at our quality of earnings, they have continued to go ahead and improve. And again, our GAAP relative to adjusted is over 50% in this quarter and we would continue to expect that to accrete higher.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nGreat. Thanks you.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nThanks Dave.\n\nOperator\n\nTien-tsin Huang, JPMorgan.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nHey, good morning. It's really encouraging to see the merchant volume spread here stay positive. I think couple of points. So anything unusual there? And do you expect that favorable spread to continue in second half? It looks -- sounds like the software size and integrated size grown double digits and so my guess is yes, but want to hear from you.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYeah, I think we did, Tien-Tsin and thanks for the question. Obviously, we have talked a lot about Point of Sale. We are seeing good momentum in point of sale. Point of Sale drive is a different revenue stream, four hours versus jut the fear of payment experience and obviously that's somewhat contributing to what we're seeing on the revenue side versus what we're seeing kind of on the volume side.\n\nI think our goal as we continue to move forward in time as always want those two things to be correlated. But obviously, as we continue to invest in point of sale, we continue to invest in embedded commerce solutions, we continue to invest in areas to further differentiate ourselves beyond the pure payment economics, many of those revenue streams aren't purely tied to volume.\n\nSo we're hopeful we continue to see sort of continued growth in revenue that may outpace volume but I don't want those two trends to become uncorrelated over time because when we're selling those capabilities, it's generally driving a payment experience as well, and we hope to see volume continue to drive forward from that point also.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nPerfect. Thank you for that. And then just on the issuing side, Cameron, I'm just curious on the pipeline front. There's a lot going on with the litigation being pushed out and I know Visa's announced a few new things like Flex Credentials. I'm just curious if you're seeing any demand change or activity with respect to issue either conversions or de novo activity?\n\nCameron Bready\n\nYes. I would say, Tien-Tsin, certainly in the short to medium term, we feel good about how we're positioned with that business. We're executing really well. The things we can control in that business are generally progressing very nicely. We've got 65 million kind of accounts on file in our conversion pipeline. We've got seven LOIs that we're working to convert to full contracts right now.\n\nWe are seeing new opportunities emerge. We called out Amadeus this quarter, as it relates to being the first kind of customer or fintech customer in Europe, leveraging our cloud-based in AWS capabilities. So we feel good about the further expansion of that product set as we move forward as well.\n\nSo we are seeing, I would say, good momentum on the commercial and sales side of the business. We've got good metrics to demonstrate that in the short to medium term. We're well positioned to continue to grow that business at a very stable level.\n\nI think long term, it's largely our ability to grow and accelerate growth in that business is tied to what we're doing around modernization. And as I called out in my script today, we are very much tracking towards completing development of the customer-facing sort of applications by the end of this year. We're in pilot with a number of customers already.\n\nAnd obviously, I think that positions us to be in market with those solutions in 2025. And I think that clearly is important to kind of unlocking new opportunities for that business, not only across sort of the segments of the FI channel that we can support in different geographies around the globe that we can attack.\n\nBut I think more importantly, some of the more developing used cases that we're seeing around cards that I think require our capabilities to be consumed a little bit differently than they've been able to be consumed historically, that's something we're going to be able to deliver through our modernization investment.\n\nSo better enablement capabilities for our clients, more consumability of our, sort of, I think, market-leading solutions. I think that really will go a long way to kind of unlocking some of the used cases that I think you were alluding to in your question, and we're excited, obviously, to be able to start bringing that about as we get into '25 and beyond.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nGot it, that’s good update, see you in September.\n\nCameron Bready\n\nThanks Tien-tsin. Well, on behalf Global Payments, thank you very much for joining us this morning. I hope everyone has a great day. I appreciate your interest in our company.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect."
