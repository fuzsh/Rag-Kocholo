        "text": "Whatever else The World the Plague Made has going for it, it’s the first book I’ve reviewed that has caused passing strangers to stop, look at the jacket, and then say: “That looks fascinating.”\n\nIn this case, the book can be safely judged by its cover. James Belich’s history is indeed fascinating, and covers a great deal of ground, with the prologue alone taking in the origins of agriculture, the domestication of the horse, trade flows between China, India and Europe, and the relationship between Christianity and Islam. But it is also worth noting that “fascinating” is not the same as “uniformly convincing”.\n\nBelich, professor of global and imperial history at Balliol College, sets out – with a degree of throat-clearing about “Eurocentrism” and bias – to answer the question “why Europe?” Why did it conquer so much of the world, and why did the West become so much wealthier than the rest? His preferred answer lies in part with the plague, and accordingly, with the marmot.\n\nAs a general rule, where there are humans, there is grain; where there is grain, there are rats; and where there are rats, there are fleas. And as the grain trade moved rats, fleas, people and their diseases around Europe, it soon came to be that where there were fleas, there was also Yersinia pestis: the plague.\n\nBut first, the plague had to reach the rats. The origins of the disease are believed to lie in the Tien Shan mountains, where the grey marmot has the unfortunate role of playing host to the bacteria. Belich’s preferred story for its spread involves a combination of gerbils and camels transmitting it to the Middle Volga, and then into Europe.\n\nWith the plague introduced to Europe, and the introduction of the book out of the way, Belich can set out his core thesis. Estimates for the death toll in European countries vary widely, but figures in the region of 50 per cent or more of the population are judged to be plausible. He argues that despite appearances, this particular mushroom cloud had a silver lining. The survivors enjoyed a “plague bonus”: in halving the population, the disease “doubled the average per capita share of just about everything”. More land for the farmers, more work animals too, and more techniques designed to substitute capital for labour. And with landlords competing to attract tenants, working conditions improved. Real wages rose, and cultures were transformed, creating pressures which would eventually result in an explosion of Europeans across the world’s surface.\n\nIn a sense, focusing on the core argument of The World the Plague Made is to miss its chief delights. There is a narrative framework, and each chapter is intended to advance some argument or provide some necessary context for it. But the history of broadside mounting of heavy cannon on ships, the etymology of the “Cossacks”, the superstitions and practices of European “crew cultures” more than justify your engagement through being interesting on their own.\n\nThere are books where you have to grit your teeth and slog through chapters in the knowledge that this is necessary work to enjoy what will follow. It is a credit to Belich that this is not the case here. It would have been all too easy to present page after page of dry prose, data tables, and graphs. He has chosen, instead, to largely present historical case studies replete with anecdotes and apposite quotes from the literature.\n\nWhile I suspect that some sections might have benefited from an in-depth economic analysis replete with equations, models and data analysis, that would also have made for an extremely tedious read. (I would far rather read an interesting and well-cited argument, do some additional reading, and draw my own conclusions, than have my eyes glaze over as the author begins his nth long paragraph on the virtues of his particular statistical approach.)\n\nInstead, we’re treated to a sweeping history, and a core argument well worth following. The differences between European states, and their Muslim neighbours, the specific effects on Britain, the early history of colonialism – all come in for examination. All are worth reading about.\n\nThis isn’t to endorse all the conclusions drawn. Some are more convincing than others: as Belich notes, even he isn’t “certain” that the plague explains a lasting shift in attitudes towards the outgroups. He also concedes that his effort to find the roots of British industrialisation in the plague era “may seem to draw a very long bow indeed”, caveating his words with the note that he wishes only to suggest the plague was its “biggest under-recognised cause”.\n\nIt is, nonetheless, a credit to Belich’s book that it holds up, as a read, whether or not you find it convincing in every detail. The World the Plague Made earns its place on your shelves, and its time in your hands, by simply being such good company.\n\nThe World the Plague Made is published by Princeton University Press at £45.
