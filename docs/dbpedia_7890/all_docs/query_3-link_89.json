        "text": "New Breed Brass Band fuses NOLA’s fertile brass band tradition with Caribbean, hip-hop, and modern R&B in the vein of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak. The explosive group makes music by and for the Crescent City’s next generation: joyful, vital and unstoppable.\n\nFusing watertight grooves with high energy shreds that will make you want to jump out of your seat, this 5-piece instrumental powerhouse has made a huge noise in the local scene, serving up soulful compositions, mind bending solos, & insanely funky jams.\n\nDescribed as “sleek, new” and “hyper-fluent” by The New York Times, Pascal Le Boeuf is a Grammy Award-nominated composer, jazz pianist, and electronic artist whose works range from modern improvised music to hybridizing notation-based chamber music with production-based technology.\n\nBenny Green received an invaluable early education from artists like Betty Carter, Art Blakey, Freddie Hubbard, and Ray Brown. Committed to playing honest jazz without needing recognition, Benny seeks to stand as a torchbearer for the continuum of straight-ahead jazz piano.\n\nPerforming timeless hits like “Hot Fun in the Summertime,” “Dance to the Music,” “I Want to Take You Higher” and more, The Family Stone carries on the funky legacy of Sly and the Family Stone and takes their relentlessly danceable groove into the future.\n\nLas Cafeteras have taken the music scene by storm with their infectious live performances and have crossed many genres and borders along the way. Their eclectic sound and high-energy performances have taken them around the world playing shows at Bonnaroo, the Hollywood Bowl, WOMAD, Montreal Jazz Festival and beyond.\n\nThe SOJ Big Band was formed almost 20 years ago in the south San Francisco Bay Area to play big band arrangements of gospel, swing, latin, R&B and jazz tunes. The band has performed steadily since its inception in front of enthusiastic audiences and fans of ball room dancing.\n\nIn this special performance, local favorites Mason Razavi and Terrence Brewer pay homage to the great pianist Thelonious Monk, known for his influential style of dissonant voicings and off-beat rhythm. They are joined by first-call musicians Gary Brown and Sylvia Cuenca.\n\nGrammy Award-nominated pianist, composer and arranger David Benoit has reigned as one the founding fathers of contemporary jazz for four decades. Benoit’s career as a contemporary jazz pianist has resulted in 40 solo recordings including Freedom at Midnight, Waiting for Spring and Shadows, which topped Billboard’s Contemporary Jazz Charts.\n\nFor more than four decades, Incognito—the British band co-founded and still led by singer, guitarist, composer and producer Jean-Paul “Bluey” Maunick—has explored the connections between jazz, funk and soul. Their vibrant, joyous live shows and innovative recordings have brought them a worldwide audience.\n\nBlack Joe Lewis & the Honeybears rock the PG&E Park Avenue Stage to kick off Summer Fest this year! A blues, funk, and soul outfit influenced by Howlin’ Wolf and James Brown, they have a raucous sound that is sure to get your blood pumping.\n\nTelemakus is a 24 year old Indian-American self-taught pianist/producer/composer who gained acclaim after the release of his 2021 debut album, The New Heritage, a jazz funk fusion collection.\n\nThe Monterey Jazz Festival Regional All-Star Vocal ensemble features the top voice students from across Monterey County, who all come together to participate in an advanced choir.\n\nLucía Gutiérrez Rebolloso hails from Xalapa, the capital of the Mexican state of Veracruz. She is heir to a family of musicians steeped in son jarocho, a traditional regional style that blends Spanish, African and indigenous Mexican influences. Rebolloso was crowned the winner of the Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition in 2022.\n\nThe musical focus of the LGS Band is dance, jazz, Latin and vocals in all styles. The classics from Miller, Basie, Brown, and Goodman are among the featured songs as well as more modern works by arrangers such as Nestico, Goodwin, Carter, Hefti, Wolpe and more.\n\nWinner of the 2023 Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz International Piano Competition, Jahari Stampley has been hailed by the jazz legend himself as a “bold new voice.” His vigorous athleticism, juxtaposed with playing of poetic delicacy, has astounded audiences from coast to coast.\n\nA Bay Area icon known for delighting audiences in jazz, blues, and cabaret clubs in the ‘70s and ‘80s, the Dynamic Miss Faye Carol has shared the stage with some of the most revered names in music, including Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Pharaoh Sanders.\n\nThe SJZ High School All Stars is a regional, audition-based music education program for students interested in the study and performance of jazz. The program includes a large ensemble and a combo.\n\nThe Monterey Jazz Festival Regional All-Star Band features the top music students from across Monterey County, who all come together to participate in middle and high school big bands.\n\nEmbodying both elegance and raw passion, Grace and The Grit are dedicated to keeping the spirit of blues alive. They bring together an exhilarating blend of soulful melodies and old school grittiness, performing with high energy and joy!\n\nIt takes a lot to stand out as a trumpeter in New Orleans, and Shamarr Allen has earned a spot on the top tier with his rollicking blend of jazz, hip-hop, funk and—even—country music.
