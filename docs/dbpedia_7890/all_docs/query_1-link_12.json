        "text": "James Tien Pei-chun, 75, remains an influential person without the Liberal Party, but the Liberal Party without him is just a gang of ordinary businessmen, says brother Michael Tien Puk-sun, 71.\n\nOn the Liberal Party's decision to abolish the honorary chairmanship held by his brother, Roundtable legislator Michael says it came down to a matter of respect.\n\n\"Whether it's about business or politics, mutual respect has to be the cornerstone,\" he said. \"Of course, it's a good thing to have a single voice within the party\" added Michael, who was a Liberal Party member in 2008 and then a member of the New People's Party. \"But that was never the Liberal Party's intention.\"\n\nAsked if he would invite his older brother James into his own Roundtable party, Michael said from his own experience in politics \"there are fewer restraints with fewer people, but having more members means more compromise.\"\n\nMake what you will of that."
