        "text": "Hong Kong's embattled Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying demonstrated again this week that he has a tin ear when it comes to the city's problems.\n\nWhile delivering his penultimate policy address on Wednesday, the Beijing-backed leader focused excessively on boosting Hong Kong’s role in President Xi Jinping's ‘One Belt, One Road’ program, mentioning it over 40 times in his speech.\n\n“He kept talking about this One Belt One Road. We are not opposed to working with the Central Government […] but he kept hammering on that and not meaning very much to the HK public,” Democratic Party Chairwoman Emily Lau said to RTHK. “So it gives the impression that what he wants to do is to suck up to Beijing and to look after his interests next year when he seeks re-election.”\n\nAll of this while already under fire for failing to take a stance against Beijing amidst the controversial disappearance of five local booksellers believed to be detained in the mainland.\n\nJust 10 days earlier, thousands joined a protest demanding the “one country, two systems” principle to be upheld and condemning the “political abduction” of Lee Bo, the fifth bookseller to go missing.\n\nThe Belt and Road initiative, launched in 2013, envisions a modern version of the Old Silk Road and a new maritime corridor that will connect China to over 60 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa through infrastructural and commercial networks.\n\nThe early stage that the program is at, its massive propaganda campaign, and probably its slogan-like name, have raised doubts in Hong Kong and internationally about whether the ‘One Belt One Road’ is a credible strategy with real potential for the region.\n\nAlan Leong Kah-kit, leader of Hong Kong’s Civic Party, referred to it as “an abstract Shangri-La,” pointing out that Leung cannot tout Hong Kong’s potential gains from it when Xi Jinping himself isn’t sure that the project will ever materialize.\n\nBut Leung’s speech painted the initiative as a grand opportunity that Hong Kong is ideally positioned to exploit. Apart from gaining better access to new markets to expand its trade and investments abroad, the city will reap benefits by acting as a connecting node giving valuable financial, trade and logistic services to countries in the corridor, he proposed.\n\nBen Simpfendorfer, an economist who has researched and written extensively about the new Silk Road, suggests that although China’s project appears overly ambitious from a strategic perspective, the commercial potential in the region is real and Hong Kong does have much to gain from it.\n\nHe points out that change is already happening in the hands of the private sector. “Leading Chinese companies and investors are doing deals in Belt and Road countries. And many I’ve spoken with are simply ‘following the money’ rather than responding to the Belt and Road strategy itself. After all, the Belt and Road region will account for half the global economy by 2020. If China decides to focus on the opportunity, then so must multinationals.”\n\nFor Hong Kong to unlock the Silk Road’s commercial opportunities, it must become aware of its role as “China’s springboard to the world, not just the world’s gateway to China,” he adds. Given its connectivity and international expertise, Hong Kong will be able to provide valuable strategic and marketing assistance to China’s emerging brand owners entering unfamiliar markets, both in the Silk Road and beyond.\n\nBut Hong Kong’s stake and role within the Belt and Road must not be inflated. Simpfendorfer points out that Chinese investors will face infrastructural, communication-related and bureaucratic hurdles in countries like Kazakhstan and Pakistan, where Hong Kong’s know-how would be of little use. \"Hong Kong needs to stay focused on its core markets, especially the ASEAN region, which has the scale and connectivity that other parts of Belt and Road lack.\"\n\nRegardless of the city’s economic opportunities and limitations in the One Road One Belt initiative, the public reaction seems to emanate from a deep distrust in Hong Kong’s leadership. It shows how China's efforts to tighten its grip on Hong Kong is breeding greater resentment and suspicions for any policies that involve closer alignment with the mainland.\n\nAs James Tien, lawmaker of the Liberal Party, stated: “To win public support, he better address the current issue of Mr. Lee Bo.”"
