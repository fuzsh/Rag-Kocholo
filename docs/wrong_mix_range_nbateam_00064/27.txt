Derek Fisher was greeted at the airport in Miami by Lebron James as Pat Riley's master plan becomes evident.

The point guard spot would be filled by a pressure player with five, count em, five championship rings in his trophy case.

Fisher's time has probably come with the Laker's as they are freeing up some cap space I imagine, letting Fisher depart.

Miami. apparently has an unlimited budget in their quest to build the team to challenge the Lakers for the NBA Championship.

I think it's a fore gone conclusion that Miami wins the East with this team assembled.

Mike Miller was also signed for stability, bench strength,and quality. He averaged 11 points a game last season, and shot 50 percent from three point range.

A point guard with huge heart, a long range specialist off the bench, added to Lebon, Dwayne, and Chris.

Great, Superman,The Flash, and Batman, just added Hawkman and the Green Lantern to the Justice League.

That's my new nickname for the Miami Heat. The Justice League.

It looks like my Lakers will have their hands full next season as we go for the three-peat, which Phil Jackson has an uncanny knack of getting, what three times now?

Has anyone noticed he has three-peated the three-peat?

Boston sures looks a bit old now, and how do they keep up with these young horses Miami now has?

I think everyone will expect this Heat team to dominate. It sure looks like an all-star line up.

Most teams operate with one superstar or perhaps two. This team has a serious four superstars. I would count anyone with five rings as a superstar.

Well, thanks for listening. I just thought I'd drop this new tidbit of Heat info to everyone.

Look for all my NFL picks and predictions through-out the football season and plenty of PGA golf action as well.
