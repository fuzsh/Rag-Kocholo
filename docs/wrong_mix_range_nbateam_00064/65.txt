Derek Fisher is currently meeting with Miami Heat team president Pat Riley and owner Micky Arison to discuss the possibility of signing with the Heat ... TMZ has learned.

We're told Fish is meeting with Riley and Arison at the Mandarian Oriental Hotel in Miami. The meeting began around 12:30 PM ET.

Riley has already made the biggest splash in NBA free agency, signing LeBron James and Chris Bosh while re-signing Dwyane Wade. Signing Fisher -- a five-time NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers -- would be a huge step towards filling out the rest of the roster.
