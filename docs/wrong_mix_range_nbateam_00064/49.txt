The experienced point guard, who became a free agent on July 1, was reportedly being pursued by a Miami Heat team that already has All Stars LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.

Fisher listened to coaches, general managers and potential team mates but did not want to end his 11-season relationship with Bryant, who led the Lakers to a 16th NBA title in June.

"At the end of the day, there's one person I could not turn away from. Kobe Bryant asked me to stay but supported whatever decision I made," Fisher said in a statement on Monday.
