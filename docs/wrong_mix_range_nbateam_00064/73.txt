With veteran point guard Derek Fisher and the Lakers no closer to reaching an agreement on a new contract Friday, the five-time NBA champion has accepted an invitation to meet today with Miami Heat president Pat Riley.

Fisher’s agent, Rob Pelinka, and Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak continue to have conversations about a new deal. Meanwhile, other teams, including the Heat, have begun to pursue the 35-year-old Fisher.

Riley, in particular, reached out to Fisher personally, according to a league source. So did several new members of the Heat roster, a high-powered group believed to include LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.

In addition to the Heat, a newly minted NBA title contender in the wake of the decisions of James, Wade and Bosh to join forces, Chicago, Minnesota and New Jersey also are believed to be interested in Fisher.

Moreover, Fisher has not ruled out a return to the Lakers, according to the source. Salary, the length of the contract, plus Fisher’s role and the ability of a team to be a title contender are among his criteria for signing.

Recent reports in various media outlets that the Lakers were offering Fisher a one-season deal worth $2.5 million, with Fisher asking for two seasons at $10 million are inaccurate, according to the source. Fisher made about $5 million last season.

Fisher helped guide the Lakers to their second consecutive championship with a victory last month over the Boston Celtics, the fifth title in seven Finals appearances in the 2000s for Fisher and the franchise.

The Lakers signed Steve Blake on Thursday with an eye toward using him as a backup to Fisher or as a replacement if a new deal cannot be struck with Fisher. Blake split last season with the Clippers and the Portland Trail Blazers.
