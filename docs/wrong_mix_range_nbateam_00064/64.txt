A report from ESPN says the New York Knicks have fired head coach Derek Fisher.

Fisher was let go after leading the Knicks to a 40-96 record in two seasons at the helm. Kurt Rambis will serve as interim coach.

Fisher took the blame on Sunday for the Knicks recent string of slow starts, saying that his team has "lacked readiness, whether mental or physical" at the beginning of games.

"I'll take some responsibility for it — whatever is or isn't happening — so that we're ready to play right at the tipoff," Fisher said. "I think we have to figure that out."

The Knicks fell behind by 19 points in the first half against the Denver Nuggets. They rebounded to take a late lead but couldn't hold it, losing 101-96.

Sunday's loss to the Nuggets was the ninth in 10 games for New York left the Knicks five games behind Detroit for the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference.

The Knicks are currently 23-31.

Brian Shaw and Luke Walton, are candidates to the full-time job, sources told ESPN. Shaw coached parts of two seasons in Denver, while Walton led the defending champion Golden State Warriors to a record start this season, filling in for injured coach Steve Kerr.

Fisher was hired by Knicks President Phil Jackson in June of 2014 to take over for Mike Woodson.
