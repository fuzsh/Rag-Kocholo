        "text": "It took 10 years, a decade of heartbreak and loss, but the Lakers have returned to the NBA Finals – back where they belong, some might say – facing the Miami Heat in the coronavirus bubble outside of Orlando, Florida, while attempting to tie the Boston Celtics’ record of 17 championships.\n\nIt will be a Finals unlike any other in the Lakers’ long and storied history, a time to celebrate, to be sure, but also a chance to pause and reflect in the wake of the death of Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash in January. Bryant would no doubt be proud of these LeBron James-led Lakers.\n\nBryant would not be satisfied until the title was won, though.\n\nAfter all, Bryant spearheaded the Lakers’ most recent championships, in 2009 and ’10, and a three-peat to start the 2000s with a capable assist from Shaquille O’Neal. Bryant was a student of the game, but also an NBA historian and well-versed in each of the Lakers’ titles.\n\nThe championships won by Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West and Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are happy memories for Lakers fans of a certain age. The titles won by the Bryant and Pau Gasol and the Bryant and O’Neal teams are more familiar for younger generations, though.\n\nBryant’s iconic victory pose after the Lakers’ Game 7 win over the Celtics in 2010, standing atop the scorer’s table with his arms outstretched and the ball in one hand is perhaps the defining moment of his era. Cheers and confetti rained down upon him as all of Southern California celebrated.\n\nHe had plenty of help getting to that lofty perch.\n\nWho could forget the pivotal 3-pointers by Derek Fisher and Ron Artest during the nerve-jangling stretch run? Or Pau Gasol muscling home a layup with Celtics defenders unable to stop him? Or Sasha Vujacic’s pressure-packed free throws in the closing seconds?\n\nAt that moment, on that June night in 2010 at Staples Center, it seemed the party might go on and on and on. It was, after all, the Lakers’ second consecutive title after they avenged their 2008 loss to the Celtics with a five-game win over the Orlando Magic in 2009.\n\nA second three-peat in franchise history was not to be, however.\n\nThe good times came to a sudden, jarring halt in 2011. Phil Jackson retired from coaching and NBA commissioner David Stern nullified a trade for Chris Paul “for basketball reasons” that might have rekindled the Lakers’ dominance. The roster was tweaked and changes were made.\n\nIn fact, the Lakers were never the same again – shattered, splintered, aging.\n\nNow they’re back in the Finals for the 32nd time in search of a record-tying 17th championship.\n\nHere’s a look at their previous titles in Los Angeles:\n\n2010 — Lakers 4, Boston 3: The Lakers delivered a stinging payback to their ancient and hated rivals by rallying from a 3-2 series deficit, including a grinding 83-79 victory in Game 7 in which Bryant made only 6 of 24 shots and Gasol sank only 6 of 16. Artest met the moment by scoring 20 points and then delivered a classic postgame press conference performance by thanking Bryant for passing him the ball for his late 3.\n\n2009 — Lakers 4, Orlando 1: Dwight Howard missed two key free throws late in Game 4, opening the door for Fisher to sink a critical 3-pointer that sent the game to overtime, where he and the Lakers surged ahead to take a 3-1 series lead. The Lakers took control in the second quarter of Game 5, sparked by Trevor Ariza and Lamar Odom, and they claimed redemption after their humiliating loss to Boston in 2008.\n\n2002 — Lakers 4, New Jersey 0: You could win a few bar bets by recalling it was the Nets rather than the Sacramento Kings that the Lakers defeated to complete their three-peat. The Lakers-Kings series in the conference finals was a classic that still boils the blood of Sacramento fans, who felt cheated by the referees in Game 6. The Lakers’ win over the Nets in the Finals was “a layup,” as Bryant called it many years later.\n\n2001 — Lakers 4, Philadelphia 1: Allen Iverson ran amok in the 76ers’ victory in Game 1 at Staples Center, but the Lakers ultimately prevailed thanks in large part to Philadelphia’s inability to contain both Bryant and O’Neal. Sixers center Dikembe Mutombo, in his deep baritone, referred to O’Neal as “a monster.”\n\n2000 — Lakers 4, Indiana 2: It wasn’t as if the Finals were ho-hum for the Lakers, but their Game 7 rally over the Portland Trail Blazers in the conference finals will live in franchise lore forever. Bryant’s lob pass to O’Neal set off the first great celebration in the newly-opened Staples Center. The title would soon be theirs.\n\n1988 — Lakers 4, Detroit 3: No team since the 1960s-era Celtics had won consecutive titles until the Lakers withstood the Isiah Thomas-led Pistons. The Lakers erased a 3-2 series deficit, with James Worthy going off in the decisive Game 7 at the Forum with 36 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists. “Big Game James,” indeed.\n\n1987 — Lakers 4, Boston 2: Magic Johnson’s junior skyhook in the closing seconds of Game 4 at Boston turned the series in the Lakers’ favor and propelled them past Larry Bird and the Celtics for the second time in three meetings in the Finals. Bird later admitted Magic was the best he’d ever seen play the game.\n\n1985 — Lakers 4, Boston 2: Not only did the Lakers finally defeat the Celtics, but they did it in grand style in Boston Garden. An Abdul-Jabbar skyhook late in the decisive Game 6 drove a stake through the Celtics’ hearts. He then raised his index fingers as he ran down the court, signaling the Lakers were No. 1.\n\n1982 — Lakers 4, Philadelphia 2: Before the Lakers and Celtics battled three times in the Finals in the 1980s and defined an era, the Lakers and 76ers faced off for the second of three Finals matchups. Philly had Julius Erving and Andrew Toney, but could not stop Magic and Kareem or contend with the Lakers’ superior depth.\n\n1980 — Lakers 4, Philadelphia 2: Abdul-Jabbar suffered an ankle injury and couldn’t play in Game 6, so Magic jumped center at the Spectrum and then scored 42 points, grabbed 15 rebounds and added seven assists in a virtuoso performance that enabled the Lakers to claim their second NBA championship in Los Angeles.\n\n1972 — Lakers 4, New York 1: After setting NBA records with a 33-game winning streak and 69 victories overall, the Lakers’ first NBA title in L.A. seemed to be something of a foregone conclusion. The Knicks were no match for Chamberlain and West, after New York beat the Lakers in Game 7 in 1970.\n\nThe George Mikan-led Lakers also won five championships before moving to Los Angeles from Minneapolis: 1954 — Lakers 4, Syracuse 3; 1953 — Lakers 4, New York 1; 1952 —Lakers 4, New York 3; 1950 —Lakers 4, Syracuse 2; 1949 —Lakers 4, Washington 2."
