        "text": "Former Los Angeles Lakers point guard Derek Fisher won't have to worry about being a free agent for long. After reaching a buyout with the Houston Rockets following a trade last week, the veteran looks like he's decided to sign with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nFisher will clear waives on Wednesday, and according to ESPN's Marc Stein, an agreement with the Thunder is expected soon after the deadline for any other teams interested in claiming his contract.\n\nDerek Fisher is in advanced negotiations with the Oklahoma City Thunder to sign with the Western Conference leaders after clearing waivers, according to sources close to the situation.\n\nSources told ESPN.com the Heat have made a strong recruitment effort to sign Fisher, but the Thunder have more financial flexibility to sign him and more of a role to offer after the loss of backup point guard Eric Maynor in early January to a season-ending knee injury. There also is a feeling among some rival teams that Fisher prefers to stay in the West, where he has played his entire career.\n\nIt was reported earlier that Fisher was likely going to end up with either the Thunder or Miami Heat. Stein reports that Fisher's agent, Rob Pelinka, could have a hand in the negotiations as he also represents fellow Thunder players Kevin Durant and James Harden."
