        "text": "Contenders are attractive to veterans, and vice versa. So it was no surprise that, after he negotiated a buyout from Houston, point guard Derek Fisher essentially narrowed his choices to the Heat and Thunder.\n\nFisher chose Oklahoma City last week.\n\nThat made the teams even, in terms of acquisition competition.\n\nIn the off-season, star forward Kevin Durant made it no secret on Twitter that he wanted free agent Shane Battier to strongly consider signing with the Thunder. Battier also spoke to Thunder center Nazr Mohammed, who relayed Durant's positive impression of Battier's skill set.\n\n\"And how it would be a great fit here,\" Battier said after Sunday's shootaround. \"And I agree. I agree.\"\n\nYet, ultimately, Battier made his call based on a \"numbers game.\"\n\n\"I felt at the time I needed three years,\" Battier said. \"And (Oklahoma City was) only willing to go two years. I have my reasons for that. So that was the deciding factor. From a basketball standpoint, it was very, very intriguing.\"\n\nBattier thinks his role would have been similar to the one he has found in Miami, as a top wing off the bench in support of starting superstars.\n\n\"The difference is, I think it would have been very difficult to finish games (with Oklahoma City),\" Battier said. \"I've finished a number of games (with the Heat), and we have a number of guys who have finished games, along with Chris (Bosh), Dwyane (Wade) and LeBron (James).\"\n\nYet, with James Harden available off the Thunder's bench to close out with Durant and Russell Westbrook on the perimeter, Battier didn't envision much of an opportunity.\n\nJAMES PRAISED\n\nA column in Sunday's Daily Oklahoman lauded James while chronicling events that had stayed out of the public eye for a month.\n\nAfter the All-Star break, the Heat flew to Portland - but, before the team got there, the plane had to make an unexpected stop to refuel in Oklahoma City. According to the column, titled \"LeBron the Nice Guy?\", James noticed that a few dozen uniformed military personnel had also stopped at Will Rogers Airport to refuel their Blackhawk, Apache and Chinook helicopters. Then he ordered his teammates to take photos with any of the military men and women who wanted them.\n\nEventually, the word got out, though clearly not from James, who made it sound Sunday as if the gesture were no big deal.\n\n\"Those are the guys who put their life in danger every day,\" James said. \"If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be free. They do so many great things for America and all of us, the least we can do is take a picture with them.\"\n\nUNLIKELY ALLY\n\nBattier, who won a title with Duke, watched Kansas beat fellow ACC school North Carolina prior to Sunday's game, sitting next to a nervous Mario Chalmers. Chalmers was the hero when Kansas won its last national championship in 2008. \"There's no conference loyalty,\" Battier said. \"Rock (bleeping) chalk! Print that!\""
