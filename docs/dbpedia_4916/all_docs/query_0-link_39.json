Foreign Ministry spokesman Costas Bikas told the ANA the government was aware of the Holbrooke proposals regarding the Skopje issue b ut, he added, the government was standing firm on its positions on this issue.\n\nAccording to reports, as yet undenied, the US proposal foresees negotiations between the two preceded by the simultaneous lifting on the Greek trade sanctions on Skopje and the withdrawal by Skopje of the star of Vergina - an ancient Hellenic symbol, considered by Athens to be an indication of Skopje's territorial ambitions - and a commitment that Skopje amend its constitution.\n\nResponding to these reports, Political Spring party leader Antonis Samaras said yesterday that the government and main opposition were \"allowing foreigners to regulate the course of our national issues, while (the two parties) were myopically concerned with internal party disputes.\"\n\nThe main opposition said Saturday that it was \"satisfied that the bombings of Bosnia had been halted and at the decision to begin talks\".\n\n\"We hope the efforts to find a just and viable solution for all the interested parties succeed,\" New Democracy party spokesman Vassilis Manginas said.\n\nThe Communist Party of Greece (KKE) criticized the US and NATO in an announcement yesterday, stressing that their aim was to quell Serb resistance completely while ignoring consequences for all peoples in the region.\n\nThe KKE said the Greek government was accountable to the people both for its stance on the Balkan crisis and the fact it continued to mislead the people with so-called peace interventions.\n\nThe government \"has been bound to the automatic pilot of decisions taken by NATO, the Americans and the Germans. It shows unacceptable tolerance and renders military facilities for a dirty war which is continuing unabated and entails the danger of spreading to the entire Balkan region,\" the announcement said.\n\n[2] Clerides arrives in Athens\n\nAthens, 04/09/1995 (ANA):\n\nCyprus President Glafcos Clerides arrived in Athens yesterday to take part in a roundtable discussion on \"the destiny of democracy in the 21st century\" to be held today.\n\nAlso taking part in the diction will be world personalities, including former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and former French prime minister Michel Rochard.\n\nReplying to questioners on the proposal for a quintupartite summit involving the US, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus and the United Kingdom, put forward by US Congressmen Ben Gilman during his visit to Athens and Nicosia recently, Mr. Clerides said Mr. Gilman had made no proposal but had sounded out views.\n\nHe said his own position was clear in that he did not rule out a quintupartite summit, but on condition that preparatory work would be done first for a coincidence of views to be achieved on basic aspects of the Cyprus problem. Otherwise, he said, it would be a failure and this would neither benefit US President Bill Clinton nor the Cyprus problem.\n\nReferring to the visit paid to Nicosia by US presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clerides said he brought no specific plan or any proposals but primarily listened to views to brief interested parties. He said it was made clear to Mr. Stephanopoulos that the development of friendly relations between Greece and Turkey passed through the Cyprus issue.\n\nOn the question of his talks with National Defense Minister Gerassimos Arsenis on the defense doctrine between Greece and Cyprus, Mr. Clerides said he was satisfied absolutely, adding that time limits for the implementation of what had been agreed were being observed.\n\nCommenting on developments in Bosnia, Mr. Clerides said the Bosnian issue would not be resolved with weapons and called for negotiations to get underway.\n\n[3] Gorbachev arrives in Greece\n\nAthens, 04/09/1995 (ANA):\n\nFormer Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was proclaimed an honorary resident of Kardamyla on the Aegean island of Hios last night.\n\nMr. Gorbachev, who is on a visit at the invitation of shipowner Panayiotis Tsakos, arrived on Hios yesterday afternoon with the shipowner's private plane. He was accompanied by his wife Raisa and a small delegation of dignitaries.\n\nA small group of supporters of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) gathered outside the local town hall, holding banners and shouting slogans such as \"Gorbachev you're a traitor.\"\n\nPolice dispersed the KKE supporters without incident. Mr. Gorbachev and his wife left the island for Athens later in the evening.\n\nMr. Gorbachev is in Greece to participate in today's roundtable discussion on \"the destiny of democracy\".\n\n[4] Papantoniou says economy in orbit of recovery, modernization\n\nAthens, 04/09/1995 (ANA):\n\n\"The Greek economy has entered an orbit of modernization and recovery, having overcome many difficulties and a period of instability,\" National Economy Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said in a message released Saturday to mark the Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF) on September 8.\n\n\"The basic element in this course is the existence of credibility, confidence and a climate of stability in the economic policy followed by the government,\" Mr. Papantoniou said.\n\nMr. Papantoniou referred to factors and developments contributing to an improvement in the economic climate, placing particular emphasis on the decrease in inflation and the approval of the Revised Convergence Programme by the European Commission.\n\nAt the same time, he said \"the road to stability and the achievement of high rates of development for the Greek economy is still long and difficult\", adding that \"patience, consistency, stability and social justice are needed.\"\n\nMr. Papantoniou said the government was also committed to backing business initiatives in the Balkans, Black Sea states and in central Europe.\n\nReferring to TIF, Mr. Papantoniou called it a \"main centre in the international promotion of the Greek economy and Greek products\", adding that \"the TIF's long-standing, dynamic and creative presence has established it as an institution of international prestige and promotion.\"\n\n[5] Evert to meet Chirac today\n\nParis, 04/09/1995 (ANA):\n\nMain opposition New Democracy party leader Miltiades Evert arrived in Paris yesterday for talks with French President Jacques Chirac at noon today.\n\nND spokesman Vassilis Manginas, who is accompanying Mr. Evert, said \"Mr. Chirac and Mr. Evert will discuss the European Union's general course, the situation in the Balkans, relations between the EU and Mediterranean countries and the framework of bilateral relations on our national issues.\"\n\nMr. Manginas also said they would exchange views on various cultural issues and pointed out that discussions would focus on major European problems.\n\nMr. Evert will also hold talks with French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette this evening.\n\n[6] Arseni outlines Greek positions at Beijing conference\n\nBeijing, 04/09/1995 (ANA):\n\nIn a statement to the Athens News Agency (ANA), Undersecretary to the Prime Minister's Office Maria Arseni presented the basic positions Greece will set out at the United Nations Fourth Conference on Women, starting today.\n\nThese are: 1. The issue of human rights for women based on the Vienna Proclamation is an \"inalienable, indivisible and integral part of world human rights\" and this principle will be supported; 2. The participation of women in decision-making centers should be promoted along the entire spectrum of political, economic and social life; and 3. The participation of women in economic life, development and employment should also be promoted because, as it was also stressed at the UN Conference in Copenhagen, \"economic development cannot be achieved without women's full participation.\"\n\nThe Greek delegation will participate at all levels of the conference where political decisions are taken to safeguard these positions. It will also continue the struggle in the framework of the European Union.\n\n[7] Albania to blame for failure of talks, Greece says\n\nAthens, 04/09/1995 (ANA):\n\nGreece blamed Albania Saturday for the breakdown in bilateral talks over the establishment of ethnic Greek minority schools in Albania.\n\n\"Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi and the Albanian delegation came to Greece without the intention and will to positively confront the issue,\" government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said.\n\nMr. Serreqi met with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in Athens Friday but cut short talks after rejecting demands for the establishment of three independent ethnic Greek minority schools in southern Albania.\n\nTirana pledged to ensure the opening of Greek minority schools in exchange for legislation concerning Albanian workers in Greece, in March when Mr. Papoulias made a ground-breaking visit to Tirana after a year of stormy relations between Greece and Albania.\n\nFollowing the March visit, bilateral committees were set up to tackle details of the contentious issues. An agreement on seasonal employment was scheduled to be signed by Mr. Papoulias and Mr. Serreqi last Friday.\n\n\"It was made clear to the Albanian side that a bilateral agreement on seasonal employment would only be signed under the condition that the issue of minority schools for ethnic Greeks in Albania was positively resolved,\" Mr. Venizelos said.\n\n\"It goes without saying that Greece will stand firm by its condition,\" the spokesman added.\n\nAthens says over 150,000 Albanians reside illegally in Greece.\n\nInternational economic institutions say they send about $300 million a year back home to support families and the ailing Albanian economy. Mr. Papoulias Friday branded Tirana's decision \"tight-hearted\" and voiced conviction that Albania would re consider its position on the minority schools.\n\nGreek officials say they want the three schools to be set up in southern Albania where most of the 300,000-strong ethnic Greek minority resides. Albania puts the figure at 60,000.\n\nMr. Venizelos also accused main opposition New Democracy party (ND) of indulging in petty party politics instead of \"rallying with the government in such moments and for such issues of foreign policy which concern Greeks in Albania.\"\n\nND criticized the government Friday for the deadlock in Greek-Albanian talks saying it had not prepared with \"due care and seriousness\" for the talks.\n\nThe main opposition party also called on President of the Republic to cancel his scheduled visit to Tirana saying he could not \"bear the burden of (the government's) unsuccessful handling.\"\n\nIn reference to ND's call, Mr. Venizelos said: \"Nobody has the right to make exhortations to the President of the Republic, who, as an international representative of the country acts within the framework of article 36 of the Constitution, that is within the framework defined by the legal government of the country.\"\n\n[8] Criticism of flight safety an `international mud-slinging campaign`, Venizelos says\n\nAthens, 04/09/1995 (ANA):\n\nGreece said Saturday reports criticizing the country's airport safety regulations were part of an international mud-slinging campaign affecting Greek tourism.\n\n\"We are dealing with an international and highly suspicious mud-slinging campaign against Greek tourism and Greek airports,\" government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said.\n\nHe made the statement after German and Danish pilots said flight conditions in Greece were \"catastrophic\".\n\nThe Danish complaints were coupled by German criticism on \"unsatisfactory communication in air and insufficient safety checks of baggage and passengers on the ground\".\n\nMr. Venizelos said Olympic Airways, Greece's national carrier, and the country's civil aviation followed strict safety regulations.\n\n\"They are in the front line as far as safety issues are concerned,\" he said.\n\nMr. Venizelos' comments were echoed by Political Spring spokesman Notis Martakis on Saturday.\n\n\"The slander attempted by foreign circles against our country in the field of flight safety is part of a more general and orchestrated offensive which aims at reducing the indisputable strategic value which Greece holds in air transport and in harming Greek tourism,\" he said.\n\nHe called on the government to realize the intentions, the dimensions and the consequences of this offensive and to move appropriately.\n\n\"It would be worthwhile for Greece to remind the governments of these countries that the Greek people knows how to react to those who purposefully tolerate or incite such dangerous and extreme attacks against our country,\" he added.\n\n[9] Premier marks 21st anniversary of birth of PASOK\n\nAthens, 04/09/1995 (ANA):\n\nIn a message on the 21st anniversary of the founding of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and founder of PASOK said \"with its presence and action PASOK has opened new prospects for Greek society.\"\n\nMr. Papandreou expressed optimism over the party's prospects, saying that \"we will forge ahead with the people to lead a strong Greece and a developed society to the beginning of the 21st century.\"\n\nPASOK Central Committee Secretary Akis Tsohatzopoulos said in his message that \"the (Panhellenic Socialist) movement (PASOK) has been registered in the conscience of the Greek people as a catalyst for progressive changes signaling the character of modern Greece. It is supported by the big popular majority and constitutes a precondition for success and a condition for the survival of Greece and Hellenism.\"\n\nMr. Tsohatzopoulos said PASOK was charged again with new governmental responsibilities, it was forging ahead with vision, security, realism and boldness in supporting the new, modern, creative, national and social course towards the year 2000.\n\nA similar message by PASOK's President and Executive Bureau said social and political agencies needed deep changes, incisiveness and renewal to live up to the present era and provide solutions required by great changes in international relations.\n\n\"The positive results of our efforts and choices in the first two years in government create conditions for just solutions to national issues,\" the message said.\n\nEnd of English language section.\n\n[Home] [HR-Net] [Hellenic Recources Institute] [Information Sources - Latest News!] [News Searches] [Organizations] [Feedback] [Usage Statistics]"
