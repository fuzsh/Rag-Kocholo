        "text": "ATHENS, Greece — Greece’s Socialist party leader says the chances are good for a coalition that will end the crisis-hit country’s post-election deadlock.\n\nHours after receiving the presidential mandate to lead government-forming talks, Evangelos Venizelos says a small left-wing party is close to his pro-bailout position and could give him the majority he needs.\n\nVenizelos says his meeting Thursday with Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis was “if not optimistic, (at least) a good omen.”\n\nGreece’s election Sunday produced a hung parliament, after voters angry at protracted belt-tightening backed anti-austerity parties and rejected mainstream political parties like the Socialists.\n\nVenizelos received the chance to form a government after the first- and second-placed parties in the election tried but failed to create a coalition government.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP’s earlier story is below.\n\nATHENS, Greece (AP) – Greece’s socialists took their shot at forging a coalition government Thursday after two other parties failed, as the prospect of a new election grew and international partners warned the country it must stick to its austerity program or abandon the euro.\n\nEvangelos Venizelos, whose once-dominant Socialist party finished a panting third in Sunday’s elections, pledged to do his best to talk rival leaders into a pro-European government that will keep bailout-dependent Greece in the shared European currency.\n\nVoters angered by crushing income cuts imposed to secure Greece’s rescue loans abandoned mainstream politicians and backed parties promising to end the austerity. They gave 21 of parliament’s 300 seats to the extreme-right Golden Dawn group that wants to mine Greece’s borders and send illegal immigrants to labor camps.\n\nThe coalition-building talks exclude Golden Dawn, which rejects the neo-Nazi label but has been blamed for violent attacks against immigrants. But the other six parties elected have failed to agree on a ruling coalition over the past four days, and there is little reason to believe Venizelos will succeed.\n\n“Things are not easy,” Venizelos said after receiving the mandate from President Karolos Papoulias. “I am not declaring myself optimistic. But I am declaring myself responsible, and dedicated to this aim that I believe serves the national interest.”\n\nHe is the third party leader to try, after Antonis Samaras, whose conservative New Democracy won the most votes, and runner-up Alexis Tsipras, who heads the Radical Left Coalition, or Syriza.\n\nVenizelos has three days to strike a deal – which would have to include the conservatives and either Tsipras’ party or the smaller Democratic Left to gain a majority of 18-51 seats.\n\nIf his efforts fail, Papoulias will convene all the party leaders in a last-ditch attempt to cobble together a coalition. If that is also unsuccessful, new elections will be called for early June, prolonging the political uncertainty.\n\nThe major stumbling block has been Tsipras’ insistence that the austerity program, without which the flow of rescue loans from the International Monetary Fund and other eurozone countries would dry up, be canceled or frozen. Both Samaras and Venizelos argue such a move would be catastrophic for the country, and would force Greece out of the euro.\n\nIn a letter to European leaders Thursday, Tsipras said the election result left Greece’s bailout commitments devoid of “political legitimacy,” but stopped short of demanding that the program should be scrapped and debt repayments halted.\n\nTsipras said the cutbacks have failed to address the country’s problems, are “destroying” the recession-bound economy and threatening to create a Greek “humanitarian crisis.”\n\n“We must re-examine the entire framework of the current strategy, as it not only threatens social cohesion and stability in Greece, but also creates instability for the European Union itself and the eurozone,” he said, in the letter to EU President Herman Van Rompuy, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi.\n\nBut German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Thursday that there was no way around Greece sticking to agreed austerity measures if it wants to stay inside the eurozone – although he acknowledged that it was a tough sell for any new government.\n\n“It’s an extraordinarily strenuous demand, to make the adjustments in Greece while staying in the common currency,” he told reporters in Berlin.\n\nSchaeuble categorically ruled out any renegotiation of the agreements, saying calls to do so didn’t chime with the current economic reality. “Anyone who tells Greece something else isn’t fulfilling their duty to the Greek people,” he said.\n\nAthens has promised to pass new austerity measures worth (EURO)14.5 billion ($18.9 billion) next month and to implement other reforms. These will be reviewed by its creditors, who will then determine whether to continue releasing rescue loans that are keeping Greece solvent.\n\nThe eurozone’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, released a (EURO)4.2 billion ($5.44 billion) batch of rescue loans on Thursday, while another (EURO)1 billion ($1.3 billion) is expected in June depending on Athens’ needs.\n\nThe fund’s chief executive, Klaus Regling, said that after the second payment there cannot be any further disbursement of money until the review and until Greece reaches an agreement with its creditors on what needs to be done over the next two years.\n\nMarkets, in the doldrums since Greece’s election stalemate, partially rebounded Thursday, with shares on the Athens Stock Exchange closing 4.2 percent up. But new Greek unemployment figures showed the jobless rate reaching 21.7 percent in February, after more than 900 people lost their jobs every day on average in the prior 12 months.\n\n—\n\nDerek Gatopoulos in Athens, Frank Jordans in Berlin and Don Melvin in Brussels contributed"
