        "text": "Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has replaced his finance minister in a broad cabinet reshuffle to counter widespread anger over tough new austerity measures essential to prevent Greece from a disastrous default.\n\nThe critical position which has been held by George Papaconstantinou since the debt crisis began in late 2009, will now be taken over by Evangelos Venizelos, the government announced on Friday.\n\nVenizelos, 57, who challenged Papandreou for the party leadership four years ago, is considered Papandreou's main internal Socialist rival.\n\nA veteran of several ministries, he handled the run-up to Greece's hosting of the Olympic Games in 2004 as culture minister, and has also held the justice, development and transport portfolios in the past.\n\nPapaconstantinou will move to the environment and energy ministry, government spokesman Giorgos Petalotis added.\n\nGovernment portfolios were also redistributed to address demands for faster reform from Greece's debt monitors at the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\n\nA new ministry for administrative reform was created to help scale back the country's bloated public sector.\n\nOther party heavyweights were also promoted at the expense of Papandreou loyalists.\n\nThe reshuffle is Papandreou's latest attempt to deal with a severe political crisis that threatened to derail the debt-ridden country's efforts to pull itself out of its financial morass.\n\nFears that Greece would default on its debts spooked investors all round the world during the past couple of days, sending share prices and the euro sharply lower.\n\nA default by Greece could spark further panic on financial markets, pummel banks in Greece and across Europe and have a knock-on effect on other struggling European economies such as Portugal, Spain and Ireland.\n\nSo far, initial reaction to the reshuffle appears to be positive, with the difference in interest rates on Greek 10-year bonds and the benchmark German equivalents narrowing from the record 16 percentage points overnight on Thursday to the still exceptionally high 15.4 percentage points.\n\nThe euro meanwhile held steady at about $US1.4150 after the reshuffle was announced.\n\nPapaconstantinou, the 50-year-old former finance minister, had handled negotiations with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund last year to get the country a 110 billion euros ($A148.85 billion) bailout, imposing harsh budget cuts and tax hikes in return, and has been in crucial talks over more financial help for Greece.\n\nGenerally well-respected among his European peers, he has faced criticism from large sections of the public in Greece - as well as from other ministers - over the stringent austerity measures, and the fact that Greece has missed many of its fiscal targets that are essential for it to continue receiving funding from the bailout loans.\n\nGreece has promised to slash its bloated public service by 150,000 people by 2015 and effectively end government jobs for life.\n\nPapaconstantinou now heads the energy portfolio - another key area slated for financial liberalisation despite fierce opposition from the powerful and traditionally pro-Socialist electricity workers' union.\n\nPapandreou has struggled to garner support for a crucial new package of 28 billion euros ($A37.89 billion) in spending cuts and tax hikes demanded by the EU and IMF.\n\nThe package must be voted through parliament if the country is to continue receiving funds from its bailout.\n\nDespite the insistence of both Papaconstantinou and Papandreou that the country had no other option and that it would default on its debts without reforming the economy, the anger has led to riots on the streets and a party revolt within the prime minister's governing Socialists."
