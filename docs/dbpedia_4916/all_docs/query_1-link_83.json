        "text": "Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 589\n\nDear Father Mark, Your blessing, reverend father.\n\nFirst of all I would ask what \"spin-doctoring\" means? Excuse me, father, but my English is not so rich.\n\nSecond, I would like to tell you that I am very sorry that my comments make you so sorrow. The all situation with the Esfigmenites makes me also very sorrow.\n\nIn your last post you blame the Ecumenical Patriarch for what you call &#8220;the polarization of Orthodoxy&#8221; (both the polarization of Orthodoxy and the accusations against the ecumenical Patriarch make me very sorrow). Are you sure that the Ecumenical Patriarch is the only on to blame here? The other patriarchates and autocephalous Churches (the ultra nationalism and personal ambitions of Archbishop Chrystodoulos of Athens are a good example of the real causes of the Orthodox polarization) as well as the non canonical Orthodox jurisdictions have no responsibility in the phenomenon of &#8220;Orthodox polarization&#8221;?\n\nBoth the Esfigmenites monks and their supporters outside the Holy Mountain (Synod of the Genuine Christian Orthodox of &#8220;Archbishop&#8221; Chrysostomus II of Athens) proclaimed that the bishop of Rome is the Anti-Christ and the personification of evil over the earth. Many people in the country I live, Greece, agree with this opinion. Should I consider them &#8220;fanatics&#8221; or just &#8220;good Orthodox Christians&#8221;? Should I admit that the Pope of Rome is the Anti-Christ and that myself a heretic? That is the proper way a Christian Orthodox is expected to show his faith and Christian charity? Is there something Christian in their attitude? I am sorry to say that I find a lot of fanatism and intolerance in their attitude but very little of Christian love or love for the truth.\n\nShould I admit that schism is the solution to the problems in Church (I do not agree with you or with your decisions, then I proclaim that you are a heretic and I stop being into communion with you) or a lawful way to express disapproval with the decisions of whosoever ecclesiastical authority?\n\nFinally, should I admit accusations against the Patriarch of Constantinople or whomever, like the accusation of giving Holy Communion to heretics and even non Christians at the Patriarchal Holy Liturgy in Raven, without any kind of proof?\n\nYours in Christ\n\nFrancisco (in sorrow as well but glad in the Lord)\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 225\n\nE-mail message\n\nUpdates on the EU and Athonite tradition.\n\n(Europaicaï¿½Bulletin) Date: Sat,\n\nFeb 8, 2003,\n\nGreek Culture Minister Defends Legality of Ban on Women's Access to Mount Athos\n\nOn 20 January Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos met in Brussels with a delegation of Eurodeputies and the Europarliament's Culture Committee President Michel Rocard and discussed with them the issue of the Mount Athos monastic community's ban on women's access, reports Athens News Agency.\n\nVenizelos explained the legal status of the 20 monastery strong community that enjoys special status for Mount Athos established in the Accession Treaty of Greece to the EEC, which was reaffirmed in Amsterdam. He also stressed that the peninsula is self-governed and all the land there belongs to the monasteries and is therefore private, without exception and without any of it belonging to the public or the central Greek state.\n\nVenizelos alluded to the status of the Roman Catholic Church, while the Vatican, although being a member of the Council of Europe as a state, is represented solely by men and the European Union correctly accepted a close relationship with that state.\n\n'The ban on women at Mount Athos and the regulations of administration of the Catholic Church, as well as that of other churches and all similar issues, are elements of a tradition which the EU should confront with tolerance and a pluralistic attitude which characterizes European civilization,' Venizelos said. No objections were raised by the Eurodeputies or Rocard.\n\nThe issue of Mount Athos' ban was raised in Europarliament on 14 January when a slim majority voted a non-binding 'resolution on the situation concerning basic rights in the European Union'. Article 98 of the resolution, which was approved by 277 votes to 255, 'requests the lifting of the ban on women entering Mount Athos in Greece, a geographical area of 400 km2, where women's access is prohibited in accordance with a decision taken in 1045 by monks living in the twenty monasteries in the area, a decision which nowadays violates the universally recognised principle of gender equality, Community non-discrimination and equality legislation and the provisions relating to free movement of persons within the EU.'\n\nThe all-male monastic community on a peninsula in northern Greece is semi-autonomous and has for 10 centuries barred the entry of women, as they dedicated their community to the memory of Mary the Mother of God, thus their monastic community is also called the 'Garden of Mary the Theotokos.' The ban is not enforced by the Greek government but by the elected council of the monastic community, which is multinational, as monastic communities on Mount Athos represent all nationalities of the Orthodox Christian Church.\n\nAthos and Women: Different Opinions\n\nby Sergey Stepanov (Pravda.ru)\n\nGreek public community is indignant at the decision recently taken by the Dutch court and at the resolution of the European Parliament in January, when a Greek law that allows monks from Mount Athos not to let women to the Holy Mount was officially declared in court as 'contradicting human rights.' An official response to the declaration was immediate: governmental spokesman Christos Protopapas told European human rights activists that the right of the Athos monastic republic not to let women to the Holy Mountain was confirmed in the treaty of Greece's incorporation into the European Union. Which, as he said, ruled any further discussions out.\n\nCurrently rights of women are discussed in many EU organizations; in accordance with the juridical procedure adopted by the European Union, a case considered by the Dutch court can be further considered by the European court in Strasbourg.\n\nMeanwhile, there are different opinions on the problem even in Greece. There are some active supporters of revocation of the above mentioned prohibition. For instance, European Parliament member Anna Karamanu is convinved that 'the prohibition was adopted a thousand years ago, in the epoch of the black Middle Ages in Europe', that is why 'it represents social realities of that period'; Anna Karamanu says that 'nowadays when equal rights for men and women are officially recognized, this prohibition cannot be valid any longer.'\n\nThe first Greek journalist who studied the problem of the prohibition for women to attend Athos, Fotini Pipili sticks to a particular opinion: 'I think that the present-day situation is caused by the policy of the monastery republic itself: Athos monasteries opened their doors to different famous princes, kings, actors, fashion designers, hairdressers and tourists from all over the world. As far as I know, the mysticism of the Holy Mountain vanished right at the period when monks began driving jeeps and started using modern services and technologies. The cosmopolitan policy of monks that they carried out within several past decades, has paved the road to the Holy Mountain. That is why I think this discrimination between men and women concerning access to Athos cannot exist any longer, as monasteries are mostly financed from sources of Europeans, men and women. I cannot reconcile myself with the fact that I am not allowed to the riches of Orthodoxy, of which I myself is a small part.'\n\nHowever, popular singer Sofia Vossou says that traditions must be preserved: 'Although I am eager to pilgrimage to Athos, I think that the things must remain as they have been defined by our traditions. It is not bad at all to have some tradition. To my mind, the ideas of society suggested by modernists are devoid of respect and of our own ego. If finally the prohibition for women to visit Athos is lifted, it will be like abolishment of Christmas tree or Christmas itself. If my church allows, I would be the first to visit Athos. But for the time being, I keep up the traditions of my church as I am an Orthodox Christian. I respect the church and its regulations.'\n\nHowever, there are even harsher opinions. For instance, Liana Kanelli, famous journalist and TV host, supports the prohibition for women to visit Athos. She says: 'Now urbanization and modernism bring destruction through entertainment. Part of the Auschwitz concentration camp was turned into a dance club, thus the place of the greatest tragedy became a place for entertainment. There are companies that make money on underwater tours to the places where atomic underwater tests were held. Do you think that in this world abolishment of the prohibition for women to visit Athos will be a progress? And this is at the time when women are still prohibited to visit the Athenian Club! In 1821, the Holy Mountain received women and children in order to save their lives. On the whole, I am not so much interested whether I have any right to drink coffee with cardinals in Vatican, or if it makes sense to set up mixed monasteries. Belief is the thing where everyone decides for himself. But if someone decides to break the sanctity of the Holy Mountain, I will take all possible efforts or organize a blockade to prevent such actions.'\n\nGreece Minister of Culture, Evangelos Venizelos said the other day that the Greek government would not fulfil the resolution of the European Parliament concerning the prohibition (the resolution is not obligatory). The minister emphasizes that Athos is a unique monastic republic in northern Greece which enjoys a particular legal status. The ancient tradition in accordance with which women are not allowed to the peninsula is confirmed by constitutional acts of the European Union and by the Greek Constitution.\n\nBesides, Evangelos Venizelos says that Athos is not the only place in Europe where women are not allowed for religious reasons.\n\nThe minister hinted that the European Parliament followed double standards; it is strange that the Parliament considers the prohibition for women to visit Athos, but it ignores the fact that governmental authorities of Vatican consist of men only and head of the government is elected by the authority consisting of men only.\n\nWe would like to mention that the prohibition for women to visit Athos was introduced over one thousand years ago, in the 9th century, when Byzantine emperors decided that the peninsula must be an abode of monks only."
