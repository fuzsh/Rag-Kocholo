The ratification was approved in a roll-call vote.\n\nInitially, the Democratic Left had stated that it would vote in favour of the draft law in its first reading but soon afterward the party's parliamentary spokesman clarified that its MPs would cast a negative vote.\n\n[02] April 29 or May 6 the likeliest election dates, gov't spokesman says\n\nThe date of the upcoming elections will soon be announced, with either April 29 or May 6 as the two likeliest dates, government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis said while speaking on the local radio station Real FM on Wednesday. He also stressed that the government intended to continue working until the very last day before the elections.\n\nHe said the government's aim was to deliver the ministries and the public sector in the best possible state, noting that this was a matter that concerned ministers from both parties in the coalition government.\n\nAccording to Kapsis, there was some leeway over draft legislation that was not among the commitments undertaken by Greece in the Memorandum with its creditors, which could be postponed for the next government, but he appealed for ministers to avoid friction over party political goals within the government.\n\n[03] PASOK leader: Europe the only road for Greece\n\nNew PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos, in his first public appearance after taking over the party helm, referred to the upcoming general elections and stressed the need for the Greek people to choose a responsible, realistic and secure strategy for the country in order to achieve a definitive exit from the crisis and restore the national sovereignty.\n\nHe said the people's sacrifices must be safeguarded, adding that Europe is the only road for Greece.\n\n\"There is no other road, no other strategic approach, to increase the low salaries, reduce unemployment, and generate growth in the country,\" he said, during a discussion in parliament for ratification of the European Council decision to establish a permanent European Support Mechanism.\n\nGreece's goal is to remain a member of the eurozone, he stressed, adding that the country is ready to turn the Memorandum around to the country's benefit, through the exercise of a strong, responsible policy and a realistic and responsible proposal.\n\n[04] PASOK leader Venizelos urges all sides 'to start thinking sensibly'\n\nPASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos on Wednesday addressed the parliament for the first time in his new capacity as PASOK's president, focusing on the imminent general elections. He underlined that the Greek people need to select a responsible, realistic and safe strategy that will lead the country out of the crisis and restore national sovereignty.\n\nVenizelos stressed that the sacrifices made by the Greek people should not be left to go to waste and spoke about political leaderships that do not have the strength to address the people with honesty. He also called on those who are \"tilting at windmills to realize the real situation that the country is in and come to their senses.\"\n\nAddressing Parliament during the debate for the ratification of the European Council decision to create a permanent European financial support mechanism, Venizelos stressed that \"Europe is a one-way street. There is no other way, no other strategic approach to increase low wages, reduce unemployment and create economic growth,\" adding that the goal is to keep Greece in the Eurozone.\n\n[05] Swoboda expresses support to new PASOK leader Venizelos\n\nHannes Swoboda, president of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, expressed on Wednesday his support to PASOK and its new leader Evangelos Venizelos, while addressing a meeting of the group.\n\nSwoboda officially briefed the socialist EMPs on Venizelos's election as PASOK leader, noting at the same time that PASOK was beginning to improve its scores in opinion polls carried out in Greece in view of the upcoming general elections.\n\nHe also announced that the new PASOK leader had an open invitation to address the socialist group.\n\n[06] PASOK leader in Cyprus Thursday, Friday\n\nPASOK president Evangelos Venizelos is due in Cyprus for a two-day working visit on Thursday, it was announced on Wednesday.\n\nDuring his first visit abroad as PASOK leader, Venizelos will be received on Friday by Cyprus President Demetris Christofias and hold separate meetings with all Cyprus parliamentary party leaders the same day.\n\nThe PASOK president will also be received by Archbishop of Cyprus Chryssostomos.\n\n[07] Property surtax part of memorandum agreements, PASOK spokeswoman claims\n\nIn a reply to main opposition New Democracy's announcement that it intends to abolish the property surtax collected via electricity bills, PASOK spokeswoman Fofi Gennimata on Wednesday asserted that the specific surtax formed a part of the agreements already signed by ND as part of the Memorandum with Greece's EU partners and creditors.\n\n\"The revenue this provides is an absolutely crucial element of the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy programme,\" she added, noting that its abolition would mean the government would then have to present the EU-IMF troika with another equivalent measures capable of raising two billion euro in state revenues.\n\nThough unpopular, the specific measure had enabled the government to gather funds in record time and allowed the approval of the new economic programme and averted default, she stressed.\n\nGennimata also pointed out that PASOK had never envisaged the surtax as a permanent measure but one that will be replaced by a uniform tax on property.\n\n[08] ND renews accusations against PASOK for the upward revision of the 2009 state deficit\n\nThe confrontation between the political parties of New Democracy (ND) and PASOK on the issue of the 2009 deficit figure continued on Wednesday.\n\nReferring to the contents of a letter by former European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Joaquin Almunia addressed to the parliamentary committee investigating the Hellenic Statistical Authority (EL.STAT) case file, ND spokesman Yiannis Mihelakis pointed out that \"everything Mr. Almunia mentions confirms the accusations made by the EL.STAT board members; all of them appointed by the government of PASOK.\"\n\nThe EL.STAT board members alleged that the 2009 public deficit figure had been deliberately inflated by including spending by public utilities (DEKO) in general government spending, even though this was not mandatory.\n\nIn essence, the letter signed by Almunia is a response to the position adopted by the PASOK government, according to which, including expenditures from public utilities (DEKO) in general government spending constitutes a standard European practice. Almunia underlined in his letter that there is no legal binding obligation on each national statistical authority to follow the European Statistics Code of Practice.\n\nMihelakis called on PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos to adopt a clear position as regards the practices adopted by his party which, eventually, caused a huge damage to the economy and led to the adoption of painful measures.\n\n\"Offering an apology without admitting the truth can only be considered as a provocation by the people who are suffering,\" Mihelakis stressed.\n\n[09] Expelled renegade MPs wish to return to ND party\n\nParliament deputies recently expelled from New Democracy (ND) after straying away from party policy lines apparently are looking for ways to return, sources in the party said on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to these sources, four of the MPs - namely, Margaritis Tzimas, George Vagionas, Costas Papasiozos and Giorgos Karasmanis - have addressed letters to ND leader Antonis Samaras saying that they heed the call for a united front in view of the general elections. ND has issued no formal response to the move.\n\nAnother three expelled MPs, namely, Eliza Vozemberg, Costas Gioulekas and Giorgos Vlahos are also considering sending similar letters.\n\nSources said that the party leadership has decided to accept the request of the renegade MPs and an official statement on the issue is expected to be issued within hours.\n\n[10] MP Tzimas rejoins ND parliamentary group\n\nMargaritis Tzimas, a parliament deputy recently expelled from New Democracy (ND) after straying away from party policy lines, rejoined the party's parliamentary group on Wednesday, following a decision by ND President Antonis Samaras.\n\nAnnouncing his decision, Samaras said that he would be sending a relevant letter to the Parliament president on Thursday.\n\nTzimas had earlier addressed a letter to the ND leader saying that he heeded the call for a united front in view of the general elections.\n\n[11] KKE's Papariga on Greece's presence in the Eurozone\n\nCommunist Party of Greece (KKE) general secretary Aleka Papariga on Wednesday stressed that whether Greece will remain in the Eurozone or not did not depend on how many sacrifices the Greek people make.\n\nPapariga stressed that she based her conclusion on how the situation is being presented by the rest of the political parties in Greece, German Chancellor Merkel and other EU partners.\n\n[12] Tsipras: 'Upcoming elections an opportunity for major overthrow in Greece, Europe'\n\nThe upcoming elections were an opportunity to create the prospect of a major overthrow in Greece and all of Europe, Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) Parliamentary group leader Alexis Tsipras said on Wednesday.\n\nHe also noted that Greece had entered a period of \"major confessions\", starting with European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia's admission that the former finance minister George Papaconstantinou had essentially \"voluntarily\" enlarged Greece's deficit figures, and confessions by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European officials that they had never once considered expelling Greece from the eurozone, only forcing the country to accept \"starvation wages\" along the lines of Bulgaria.\n\nThe only thing that had not yet been confessed, according to Tsipras, was the exact content of the Memorandum signed by the New Democracy-PASOK coalition government and what the Greek people would be required to do.\n\n[13] LAOS leader attacks ESM as 'concession of national sovereignty'\n\nPopular Orthodox Rally (LAOS) leader George Karatzaferis on Wednesday strongly opposed ratification of the European Council's decision for permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM) by the Greek Parliament, accusing the government of essentially conceding elements of Greece's national sovereignty to Europe.\n\n\"We have no right to vote for a reduction in the country's national sovereignty. Because what you are voting for today is a reduction of national sovereignty,\" Karatzaferis said during the debate on ratifying ESM in Parliament.\n\n\"Greece cannot with a simple procedure vote for what's essentially the abolition of the finance ministry,\" LAOS's leader added, noting that the government had in 2009 received a state - albeit one with serious problems - but was \"handing back a colony\".\n\nHe also attacked Finance Minister Filippos Sahinidis personally, accusing him of concealing the existence of an agreement with Finland signed by his predecessor Evangelos Venizelos and also questioning the exemption of the five Goldman Sachs bonds from PSI.\n\nSahinidis denied the existence of both a deal between Finland and Greece and challenged Karatzaferis to submit any evidence he had of either the supposed agreement or the Goldman Sachs bonds to Parliament.\n\n[14] Democratic Left leader : Elections probably on May 6\n\nThe most probable date for the general elections is May 6, said on Wednesday the president of the Democratic Left party Fotis Kouvelis said on Wednesday after his meeting with Prime Minister Lucas Papademos.\n\nAccording to Kouvelis, the premier briefed him on the pending legislations in parliament while he set to the prime minister the acute issue of unemployment, noting that a social protection net must exist for the financially weaker.\n\nAnswering to a query, he said that the elections wager is the country's exit from the impasses and to remain alive with a standing society, adding that his party has a complete programme regarding changes in the loan agreement.\n\nHe also said that his party will not participate in a co-governance with New Democracy and PASOK and will not provide them with an alibi.\n\n[15] FM Dimas on Greek-German relations\n\nGreek-German relations should be governed today by mutual respect, friendship and confidence, \"and in this spirit the issue of German war reparations could and should be discussed again,\" Foreign Minister Stavros Dimas said on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking during a joint meeting of the Parliament's Economy and Defense Standing Committees, Dimas also added that the discussion should be carried out \"with the due documentation that will reinforce our arguments.\"\n\nDimas also reminded the joint effort deployed by Greece and Germany in building peace in Europe in the difficult years following WW II.\n\n\"Even today, we must joinly fight for Europe's exit from the crisis,\" Dimas noted.\n\n[16] GSEE union federation accuses troika mission of 'neoliberal fixations'\n\nCommenting on statements concerning the policy for Greece made by EU-IMF troika mission officials in the European Parliament, the Greek umbrella trade union organisation General Confederation of Employees of Greece (GSEE) on Wednesday suggested that troika members had \"neoliberal fixations\" that made them insist on the same dead-end policy mix that had sunk Greece into five consecutive years of unprecedented recession.\n\nGSEE stressed that this policy had led to a society scourged by poverty and unemployment, with tragic results for both the economy and society.\n\n[17] Illegal migrants reception centers in Attica to open very soon\n\nFollowing Attica Regional Council decision for the establishment of three reception centers for illegal migrants in Attica prefecture, the Citizens Protection Ministry's procedures will move rapidly, said Deputy Citizens Protection Minister Manolis Othonas on Wednesday, speaking to private television MEGA.\n\nOthonas stressed that \"given that the existing premises are in a good condition, the first reception center will be ready to operate within 35-45 days\", adding that the Ministry will undertake the cost of any restoration work in the existing premises.\n\n[18] Immediate release from prison for individuals serving sentences of less than five years\n\nIndividuals serving prison terms of less than 5 years will be released, as opposed to those sentenced with more than 5 years, according to a recommendation by Supreme Court Deputy Prosecutor Anastassios Kanellopoulos, it was announced on Wednesday.\n\nIn response to a relevant question by the Halkida Prison chief administrator, the deputy prosecutor pointed out that inmates serving a prison term of less than 5 years, will be released immediately pursuant to Law No. 4043/2012.\n\nThis provision concerns inmates sentenced with up to 3 years in prison and have served 1/10 of their term as well as those with sentences between 3 and 5 years who have served 1/5 of their prison term.\n\n[19] Draft presidential decree for public-sector staff evaluation unveiled for consultation\n\nAdministrative Reform and Electronic Governance Minister Dimitris Reppas on Wednesday unveiled a proposed presidential decree for the evaluation of public-sector staff for a week-long public consultation procedure before it is sent to the Council of State for approval.\n\nThe minister underlined that the presidential decree was not in any way linked to the prospect of redundancy for public-sector staff and said that the evaluation process might begin within 2013.\n\nBased on the decree, public-sector staff will be asked to sign individual contracts at the end of each year that set precise and quantifiable targets that they must meet, while promotions and pay increases will be made on the basis of these targets.\n\nEmployees will be evaluated based on their administrative ability, their behaviour in the workplace and their efficiency. Recommendations will be made by the employee's immediate supervisor and the final decision taken by a member of senior management.\n\nAll public-sector staff that succeed in exceeding 80 percent of the target set will receive a bonus as foreseen under the bill for the new wage scale. Certain public-sector services to be named by the finance ministry, such as tax offices, will also be eligible for a bonus for meeting fiscal targets.\n\nReppas said that the higher positions in the hierarchy will be occupied only by the 'best' under the new system of evaluation, rather than the previous system where promotions were based on years of service alone. While noting that there was a subjective element to the evaluation process, he added that purely objective criteria did not necessarily promote those with the highest merit, as seen in the labour reserve measure.\n\n[20] Up to 6,000 hirings in local government, based on ministerial decision\n\nUp to 6,000 employees can be hired by municipalities with private-sector fixed-term contracts, according to a joint decision of the interior and finance ministers announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe staff hiring will be to cover needs for jobs such as hygiene and sanitation and subject to the approval of the appropriate committee. The 6,000 places will be filled gradually and in conjunction with the funds available to local authorities for proven needs.\n\n[21] Revision of visa issuance key to attracting more tourists\n\nAccelerating procedures towards simplifying visa issuance was the key to maximizing tourism figures in Greece. This was the message of a seminar organized by Greek Tourism Organization (EOT) to celebrate its 60th birthday in Athens on Wednesday.\n\nGreek Culture and Tourism Minister Pavlos Geroulanos, in his address, said a Schenghen treaty did not favour the smooth travel of tourists from countries outside the treaty and underlined that the ministry was taking initiatives towards changing this fact.\n\nTaleb D. Rifai, World Tourism Organization UNWTO <http://unwto.org/en/about/management/taleb-rifai>, secretary general, in his address stressed that Greece could play a vital role in a front towards modernizing visa issuance.\n\nGreece should welcome its incoming tourists from countries outside the Schenghen treaty in a better way, Geroulanos said, adding these people should not be treated as suspected criminals. He stressed that from the 16.5 million tourists visiting Greece, only 700 choose to stay in the country illegally.\n\nRifai said there must be a revision of visa issuance process and noted a tourist cannot wait for three or four days for his visa when he decides for his trip at the last moment. WTO's secretary-general underlined that modernization of the visa process goes through technology and Internet use.\n\n[22] Palestinian diplomatic mission appeals for release of administrative detainees held in Israeli prisons\n\nThe Palestinian diplomatic mission issued an appeal to Greek human rights organizations, Greek MPs and MEPs, the Hellenic Red Cross and \"all advocates of freedom and justice\", to exert pressure on the Israeli government to respect and comply with fundamental principles of international law, such as, the Fourth Geneva Convention, it was announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe Palestinian diplomatic mission called for the release of Hana Shalabi, who is on hunger strike for the past 41 days, and all others held in administrative detention in Israeli prisons without charge or trial in violation of international fair trial standards.\n\nThe statement underlined that more than 300 Palestinians, among them many MPs, are currently held in administrative detention in Israeli prisons. Thirty of them are on hunger strike.\n\nFinancial News\n\n[23] Bank recapitalization plan to be unveiled before Easter\n\nThe terms and conditions of a bank recapitalization scheme were discussed on Wednesday during a meeting between Prime Minister Lucas Papademos with Finance Minister Philippos Sahinidis and the ministry's secretary general Elias Plaskovitis. The government is determined to take a final decision on the issue before the Easter holidays without affecting a course towards holding general elections in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Finance ministry on Wednesday announced it was extending a deadline for Greek banks to publish their balance sheets for 2011 until April 20, offering more time to banks to fully assess the impact of a PSI program on their results.\n\n[24] Israel examining natgas export to Europe via Greece\n\nIsrael is examining all the alternative options for exporting natural gas, but channeling it to Europe is the most natural choice, and export via Greece is being mulled, Israeli energy and water resources minister Uzi Landau said in Athens on Wednesday, addressing an Economist conference on energy infrastructures in Greece, Cyprus and Israel.\n\nAddressing the same conference, Greek environment, energy and climate change minister George Papaconstantinou said the possibility exists of creating a third natgas transport corridor to Europe via Greece, while Cyprus' commerce, industry and tourism minister Neoklis Sylkiotis sad that the three countries were capable of guaranteeing the smooth flow of natural gas to Europe, adding that at least eight years would be required to build the relevant infrastructures in order for exports of natural gas to begin from the eastern Mediterranean region.\n\nLandau said that the questions that need to be answered with respect to natgas export from Israel were whether the gas will be channeled to Asia or to Europe, and whether it will be exported in liquefied natural gas (LNG) form or by pipeline via Cyprus and Greece to the rest of Europe.\n\n\"All these are under discussion, and there will be proposals,\" he said, noting that channeling the gas to Europe was the most natural choice.\n\nAt a first stage, the gas that has been discovered in Israel's sea region will be used for electricity production and industrial use, and Landau said he was open to export of gas to Palestine and Jordan which, he noted, will boost regional cooperation for consolidating peace. He also said that a Memorandum of Understanding has already been sighed for connecting Israel's electricity grid with that of Cyprus via underwater cable, while studies are also being drafted for hooking up Cyprus' grid with Greece's via Crete. \"The Greece-Cyprus-Israel axis, and perhaps of other countries, could provide an anchor of stability,\" Landau said.\n\n[25] Mytilineos Group reports improved 2011 results\n\nMytilineos Group on Wednesday reported improved 2011 results, with net after tax and minorities earnings totaling 42.6 million euros.
