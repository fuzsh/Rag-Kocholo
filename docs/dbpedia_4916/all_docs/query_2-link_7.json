        "text": "Following a cabinet reshuffle, Mr Evangelos Venizelos was appointed Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic on 17 June 2011, succeeding Mr George Papaconstantinou, and also becomes EIB Governor for the Hellenic Republic.\n\nMr Evangelos Venizelos, 54, served as Defence Minister since October 2009.\n\nHe has also held several cabinet posts in previous governments since 1993 including Government Spokesman, Minister of Justice and Minister of Development. He has been a member of the Greek Parliament since 1993.\n\nHe is a professor of constitutional law at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and holds a doctorate from the University of Paris II - Sorbonne.\n\nThe ceremony held near Nemila village in Bosnia and Herzegovina marked the breakthrough of the left stretch of Golubinja tunnel located on the Pan-European Corridor Vc. As the longest in the country stretching some 3.6 kilometres, the tunnel situated between the cities of Žepča and Zenica forms part of the Poprikuše – Nemila motorway section. Upon completion of this project, travel time from Sarajevo to northern parts of the country will be reduced significantly, thanks to the bypassing of the existing road through the canyon of the River Bosna."
