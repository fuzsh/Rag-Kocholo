        "text": "Yiannis Haralambopoulos,a respected figure within PASOK, died on Thursday at the age of 95.\n\nHaralambopoulos was a close adviser of late Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and held various ministerial posts, as well as that of deputy prime minister.\n\n“For him, politics was about contributing, not power,” said President Karolos Papoulias, who served with Haralambopoulos in PASOK governments.\n\n“He was a leading figure in the struggle against the dictatorship and a true servant of the public interest,” said PASOK president Evangelos Venizelos.\n\nHaralambopoulos fought on the Albanian front and in the Middle East in the Second World War. He was jailed for his political beliefs during the junta.\n\nHe was first elected to Parliament in 1964 and became part of the first PASOK government in 1981."
