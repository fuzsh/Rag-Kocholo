Deputy Prime Minister and PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos recommended that ex-minister Christos Papoutsis should take over as Greece’s representative at the World Bank, Kathimerini understands.

It was announced on Friday that the 60-year-old politician would assume the role from September 15.

“Over the last few months, the government has worked closely with the World Bank in order to improve the investment environment,” a statement said.

Papoutsis has previously served as citizens’ protection and merchant marine minister. Between 1995 and 1999, he was European commissioner for energy.

Last year, Papoutsis challenged Venizelos for the leadership of PASOK but failed to garner enough support to stand in the election. He also belongs to the left wing of the party, with which Venizelos does not have good relations.

Sources suggested that Prime Minister Antonis Samaras accepted Venizelos’s proposal as a trade-off for appointing a candidate of his choice to a more prominent international position, such as European commissioner.
