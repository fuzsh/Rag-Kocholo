The ceremony held near Nemila village in Bosnia and Herzegovina marked the breakthrough of the left stretch of Golubinja tunnel located on the Pan-European Corridor Vc. As the longest in the country stretching some 3.6 kilometres, the tunnel situated between the cities of Žepča and Zenica forms part of the Poprikuše – Nemila motorway section. Upon completion of this project, travel time from Sarajevo to northern parts of the country will be reduced significantly, thanks to the bypassing of the existing road through the canyon of the River Bosna.
