BO DIDDLEY DIES JUNE 2

MIAMI (Reuters) - Rock'n'roll pioneer Bo Diddley died on Monday at the age

of 79. Diddley died of heart failure at his home in Archer, Florida, his

management agency, Talent Consultants International, said in a statement.

"One of the founding fathers of rock'n'roll has left the building he helped

construct", the statement said.

Diddley suffered a stroke during a concert in Iowa in May 2007 and was

hospitalized in Omaha, Nebraska. In August 2007 he had a heart attack in

Florida.

Garry Mitchell, a grandson of Diddley and one of more than 35 family members

at the musician's home when he died at about 1:45 a.m. EDT (0545 GMT), said

his death was not unexpected.

"There was a gospel song that was sang and he said 'wow' with a thumbs up",

Mitchell told Reuters, when asked to describe the scene at Diddley's

deathbed.

The song was "Walk Around Heaven" and in his last words he stated that he

was going to heaven.
