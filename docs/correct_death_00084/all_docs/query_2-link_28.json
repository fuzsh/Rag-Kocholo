Kubrick’s A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and the X rated CALIGUIA. He’s played villains, comic rock stars and romantic leads and is currently busier than ever acting all over the world and doing voiceover work for documentaries and cartoons. Last year a McDowell film festival wxs held in Manhattan. The British star was interviewed in South Africa by MJ Simpson of Leicester, England. DON STROUD was an Hawaiian surfing champ who was excellent starring in movies like BLOODY MAMA (billed above Robert De Niro) and HOUSE BY THE LAKE and co-starring in COOGAN’S BLUFF and THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY. The lucky to be alive star tells jaw dropping real life stories of drugs, booze, sex, guns, bikers, hookers and rock and roll bands - and he has saved several lives over die years. He was interviewed by Bruce FiU-1 Bowell (in California) and by Nicarnor Loreti (in Argentina). JAN SHEPARD, from PA, was a busy TV actress (often on ZIV Studio series) who landed roles in two Elvis movies (KING CREOLE and PARADISE HAWAIIAN STYLE) and wxs in ATl’ACK OF THE GIANT l£ECHES! Frequent PV contributor Professor Fred Hopkins interviewed the long retired star. I congratulated Forry Ackerman here before for winning his lawsuit over Ray Ferry (the weasel who hijacked Famous Monsters magazine) but Ferry declared bankruptcy to avoid paying. The hollow victory cost FJA $200,000 in legal fees and he had to sell his famous 18-room Hollywood Ackermansion/mu.seum (which I, like countless others, visited for free). In Sept, he had a yard sale, autographing items as he .sold them at bargain prices, then moved into a rented ’’bungalow.\" For decades Ackerman tried to get Hollywood studios, producers and the city of LA. to provide a perma- nent home for his vast and priceless sci-fi and horror movie memorabilia collection (including 50,000 books). Ackerman coined the term sci-fi and created EM. in the ’50s. Think of him when you watch cen.sored and cut movies and TV shows squeezed inbetween commercials on the SCI-FI Channel. The 85 year old widower is still recovering from pneumonia and brain surgery: He’ll be selling off most of the rest of his collection at three auctions. Dale Ashmun’s Spare Parts column will be back next Ume. This issue is late so our Never To Be Forgotten obit section is even longer than usual. Three very different men who died recenUy didn’t receive that much press attention considering how influential they were, so I had their write ups moved here. WALTER H. ANNENBERC (94), from Milwaukee, Wl, was the only son of the 10 children of pub- lisher Moses Annenberg, who served a jail sentence (40-42) for tax evxsion (before dying of a brain mmor). Walter inherited The Philadelphia Inquirer and two racing publications and went on to build Triangle Publications to include newspapers, magazines, and radio and TV stations in NYC, PA, CT and CA. He created Seventeen (edited by his sister, Enid Haupt) in ’44 and tlie weekly TV Guide, long America’s largest circulation magazine, in ’53- Annenberg was a friend of and major campaign con- tributor to Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon. Nixon appointed him Ambassador to England in ’69 and his speechwriter Pat Buchanan had a column in TV Guide. President Reagan and Nancy visited the Annenbergs at their Rancho Mirage, CA, estate every holiday season. He sold off his newspapers and staUons in the early 70s, and sold Triangle (including TV Guide) to Australian Rupert Murdoch in ’88 for $3 billion. Forbes esUmated his net worth at $4 billion (much of which was donated to the state of Israel). President Reagan awarded him the Medal of Freedom in ’86. GEORGE MITCHELL (85), from Falkirk, Scodand, presided over the BBC’s weekly BLACK AND WHITE MINSTREL SHOW for 20 years from 1958 to ’78. The conductor host was like the Mitch Miller of England but his popularity listed much longer - and his all male singers were in blackface. The Television Toppers female dance troupe remained white. Mitchell kept minstrel traditions creat- ed in America’s pre Civil War era alive for years after Hollywood had finally stopped using blackface (early 50s). .Mitchell and his minstrels had #1 hit LPs every year from I960 to '63 and the .show reached its higliest British ratings in ’64 during tlie height of Beatlemania. When it switched to color in ’67 there were organizcnl protests. BBC shows air all over tlie former British Kmpire, including South Africa. Mitchell (whose show was a fave of the royales) was made OBI* in ’75 and continued to have chart LPs every year until ’77 (during tlie heiglit of punk rock). Near tlie end an actual black person (comedian Ix?miy Henry) became a regular. The hit Black And >Xliite Minstrel Show stage ver- sion ran at tlie Victoria Palace, London, for another 10 years tlien toured Australia and New Zealand. WILLIAM PIERCE (68), from Atlanta, GA, was a physics professor at Oregon State U. who became the pubheist for George Lincoln Rockwell’s American Nazi party. Wlien Rockwell was murdered (in ’67), Pierce took over, tlien formed liis own W. Virginia based National Alliance in ’74. In ’78 the reclusive Pierce self published the best selling 'l\\imer Diaries, wliicli he wrote (as Andrew Macdonald). It led to tlie creation of new white power groups (including The Order), influenced OK City bomber Timothy McVeigh, and is still considered a bible and a blueprint for a race war to many Americans. Pierce successhilly targeted alienated teenagers witli his National Youtli Alliance, Resistance Records (punk rock, speed metal. . .), and vidt*o games (one is Etlinic Cleansing). He published the National Vanguard newspaper and ran Vanguard Books, and as soon as the internet was created had multiple websites to spread his beUefs worldwide. He has many followers in Europe, England and South Africa. Pierce had cancer. The late Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel) was a brilliant satirist who did political cartoons before writing his classic children’s books - which meant a lot to me as a little kid. I read my faves (Bartliolmew^ and The Oobleck, The 500 Hats of Bartholomew- Cubbins, and Yertle The TYirtle) over and over at a library (now a perfectly legal place to view extreme internet pom). I had graduated to more mature reading (DC superheroes. Mad, Famous Monsters) by the time of The Cat And The Hat and The Grinch, but those characters meant a lot to even more kids. Now we have movies starring shameless, obno.xious, lowest common denominator in your face multi millionaire Canadians - HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS Oim Carrey) and THE CAT IN THE HAT (Mike Myers). Botli were pro- duced by Ron “Opie” Howard. Could tliat brilliant Canadian comedian Tom Green be far off as Bartholomew Cubbins? The sky IS falling. Some people have been complaining about pop songs being used as commercials since the 70s. I always loved The Beach Boyds’ “Fun Fun Fun,’’ especially for the brilliant falsetto harmony ending, and Sly And The Family Stone’s “Hot Fun In the Summertime.’’ And tlie intro of Iggy Pop’s “Lust For Life’’ (featuring the dmmming of Soupy Sales’ son) has become the new “Thus Spake Zarathustra’’ (or tlie 2001, Elvis intro theme) of TV ads. Key parts of all three are now being used for cruise ship TV spots. Music from an I.SD casualty, a coke casualty, and a long time heroin addict to attract mostly retired couples to take overpriced vacations on ocean polluting ships that a record number of people have been puking their guts out on. Brilliant! I didn’t really care when The Beatles’ “Revolution” was used by Nike but 1 really hate hearing Creedence Clearwater’s “Fortunate Son” (#14 when I was classified 4A) subverted to sell whatever the hell they’re using it to sell. Could advertisers get any lower!? Let’s see. Duff guzzhng perfcHTt fool TV zombie nuke plant worker Homer Simpson is now tlie Burger King spokesman - and here are tlie lyrics to a recent TV ad selling microwavable Chips Ahoy cookies (with faces). The music copies “Going To A Go-Go” (mixed with now supposedly trendy “garage rock ”) - “We’re running out of time now-. We’re having a meltdown.” !?*%@w-ww-DVDw-w-w-reaIit\\TV\\v’wwDVDw-w'wBushDVDww-w-DVD91 Iww-wEiironDVDww-wanthnLxDVDw wweapons of mass destruction - DOH! And that’s the REAL story (as Paul Harvey says). Some good news: McDonald’s has started to close some restaurants overseas and in America. I saw my first abandoned McDonalds (in Salisbury, Maryland) recently. I hope to see many more.

I grew up in the Smi Frmicisco Bay Are;i where, in the 70s, Kaiser syndicated Tlie Ghoul. TliLs wxs my first exposure to a wildass fonn of horror hosting, our local product being tlie bunon-down Bob Wilkiits on Creature Features and the dry, ghostly Asmodious on Shock It To Me llieater. A few yeans ago, I heard tlie Ghoul had returned to Cleieland's air- waves mid iinniediately set alxiut getting some copies of tlie show. In the couise of the program, he frequently mentioned this \"Ghoulardi guy. /\\nd it jiLst so hapiienc’d I w:is trading Uipes with miother horror host buff who had some Ghoulardi material. Despite the fact that she's not a big host fan, my lovely mlssiLs wmideis in ms I sit down with Big Chuck mid Lil' John's tribute to Eriiie Anderson - tlie one aired just after he'd passed away. By tlie end of the progrmn. there were t\\«) brand spanking new Ghoulardi fmis in Cidifornia. We just couldn't lielieve how cool this guy was - a cracked. Mad magazine beatnik with s|xx)ky ligiiting mid a stiaqi, sharp wit. 1 tlien rememliercd you'd had an article on Ghoulardi in a past issue of Psychotronic, and dug it out. One of the side bars men- tioned a nuLsic ta|ie called 'Stay Sick!,' available from Dave Billnian in Akron, Oli. Hoping against hoiie, I siiml mailed a query to tlie by-now tliree year old addnss - and son-of-a-gun, he e-mailed back, 1 got the tape.. AND he offered to do some sho|i|)ing for me at the impending Ghoulardi-Fest. 1 loaded up on tee shirts, sweat shirts, but- tons, posteni and both of the Ernie Andenion radio tributes I produced by Chits Quinn, witli the help of Big Chuck Schodowski mid Ron Sweed. By this time, Dave and miother Akron contact had alerted me to Son of Ghoul, mid that only added to tlie strmige fright wig fever that had overtaken me. Eventually, I startwl sending mail to Son of Ghoul. At one point, he had a mail in drawing for a life-sized model skeleton, with tlie winner invital to come on the show’ to claim the prize. 1 sent in over 200 |iostcards. I won. My wife. Dee, mid me flew to Clevelmid, met up with our local Ghoulardi friends mid went to a taping of Chuck mid John. Chuck was miiazing. After the tap- ing, he hung out with us and regaled us with wild stories of the Ghoulardi mid lloolihan days. Tlie Son of Ghoul appeirance was a blast, and we still stay in touch. Dee mid I are actually traveling back to Cleveland in a few weeks to attend Fright Vision, mid sec all our old friends again. .Mid in the meantime, I continue to dig dec|i into Cleveland s fascinating television his- tory. 1 ordered the Ghoulardi book thnuigh you as well. So I really vvmited to tlimik you. It's becaiise of your cover:q«e, that I met other fans in the Cleveland mea, and made some wonderful friends. Aid Ghouku’di still niakis a big impreision out here in California. 1 keeii getting stopix-xl by expatriate Clevelanders wlienever I wear one of my Ghoulardi shirts. I walked into a restaurant one night mid a guy literally leaped up from his table, abandon- ing his date, and liegging to know where I got my shirt. Smiie thing hapiiened at tlie dog park and coming out of a record store. People greet you like mi old friend mid immediately stml telling their childhood Ghoulardi stories. Its Lniie Amkrsmi aud Tim Conway mnazing. We had our kitchen floor redone some time back, and even this guy turned out to lie an old fmi. I made up a t;qie for him, so he mid his dad could sit down mid watch Ghoulardi togetlier again. I think we got a deal on the flixir .Even at this late date, Ghoulardi has had a deeii influena* on my life. It in.s]iired travel mid new friendships, introduced me to some wild, rare music (there's a GREAT new 2 cd collection called '11101 Blue!' with stuff I'd never heard miywJiere!) - and just plain made me laugh. So tlianks again for your part in this on-going joumey of discovery. Stay sick! Oh! by the way.. . I'm the guy vvJio sent you DON'T WORRY, WT/LI.

LONEY Loved tlie article on Roy Ixiney'. 1 was lucky enough to be one of the 20 or so [xsiple to attend his SOth birdiday party/concert at a tiny club in the back of a Seattle Laundromat (!) a few years ago. It was late on a Sunday night (Seattle shuLs up at 9pni on Sunday) so it was only true fmis, hardcore rock n rolleis mid friends, mid was hardly publicized, but Roy was mieizing mid really rocked out. His back up band featured people from all over the world who rotated on iastruments, and he did all his great Groovies songs, plus his new material, which unlike every other rock act from the 60si70s, is good as well. Hie band and crowd all sang ’ Happy Birthday \" to him. It was really a special moment in my concert going life. He is surely one of the best white male vocalists in rock. Aiyone who can shout ”1 Got the Boogie Disease!\" mid make it sound cool is something sixicial, for sure. - Keith Bearden Enjoyed the hell out of tlie Roy Lonev’ interview The Flmiiin' Groovies were one of the very best rock and roll bands ever put on this planet! Love your publication, only wish you'd publish it more (often). - Tom Stein (Norwalk, CT) I was pleasmitly suqirised to see Roy Loney sticking up for Tlie Kingston Trio! In their prime (Dave Guard-era), they were terrific. Aid as he |ioints out, tremendoiLsly popular, comparalile to Tlie Beatles in that Tlie K.i had nimiy hits, were on the cover of Life, and inspired countless imitators. Every college cmiipiLs had an answer to The Kingston Trio, and nimiy of them signed to major lalieLs. Aid several of these had hits, as well. In addition, via A Jardiiie, they had mi influence on Tlie Beach Boys. Aid their sound echoes in British Invasion groups like Peter & Gordon, Chad & Jeremy, mid even The Beatles. Listen to ”pre-flyle\" Byrds. W hat you hear is a group that's caught Ik-Nvci'ii wanting to sound like The Kingston Trio and wanting to sound like Tlie Beatles. That said. I wmsn't tixi plemsed to read Loney's quick and sadly typical dismissal of the \"Elvis in the aniiy-to-Tlie Beatles \" |Kriod 4 ^ PSYCHOTRONIC ^ of rock and roll. Hello! Girl groups, Roy Orbison, Phil Spector, The Beach Boys, Ray Charles, surf rock, hot r^ song^, Gary “U.S.” Bonds, Ricky Nelson with Janies Burton, Tlie Everly Bros., The Isley Bros., early Motown, The King^men, Tlie Trashmen, ETC!!! This was no Top 40 Dark Ages!!! The Top 40 Dark Ages descended in the 1970s, and nev’er e\\'er left. Not even for a minute. End of lecture! Class dismissed! - JD King Enjoyed the Roy Loney piece which had a few nice tidbits about my old bass player Ron the Ripper (Greco). - Johnny Strike Strike, formerly of Crime, now le(uis T\\'E whose rieir Night Raul on Lisbon is arailable Jwm Flipping Jets Records. Tliere would have been no way possible that Eddie Cochran played guitar on Ciene Vincent’s version of “Pistol Packin’ Mama,” though he arranged it Eddie died on April 11, I960, and Gene recorded it (according to session records in tlie Gene Vincent Rock ’n’ Roll Legend French box set) on April 22, less than two weeks after Eddie died. - John Battles (Chicago) KWOUK PV #37 was excellent. 1 especially enjoyed tlie interviews with actors Vincent Schiavelli and Burt Kwouk. Kwouk mentions that he appeared in three episodes of THE AVENGERS, including one from tlie first season when Ian Hendry' was in the series. Tlie episode was Kill Tlie King, but unfortunately only one of tlie Hendry' episodes (The Frighteners) is still around today. 1 assume tlie rest of THE AVENGERS first season shows are lost forever. - Timothy Walters (Muskogee, OK) The Burt Kwouk piece was one of PVs best. And 1 only knew Burt from the overrated PANTHER, CURSE OF THE ¥ll and DEEP END. - Hugh Shelton (Hazel Pk. Ml) Wow! 1 just came back from my vacation! 1 went to San Paulo/Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and delighted myself with laying out in the beaches of Cocacabana and Ipanema sipping a Pina Colada! 1 (brought) my back issues of P^chotronic and re-read many of them on Cocacabana Beach. Of course there were some distractions from the magazine when 1 would observe a fev^' thongs...but, that is another story'. It was nice to get back and pick up your lat- est issue (#37) and reiid your feature on Burt Kwouk. 1 love this guy, his roles in the Pink Panther movies were hilarious! 1 used to love the way he would lie in wait for Inspector Clouseau and then attack the Inspector with his various martial arts moves. Those scenes were absolutely hilarious. Thank you for the list of movies he has appeared in, 1 will be looking for some of those movies. 1 really admire his attitude. Tliis is a man who has made several movies, but is humble enough to not watch his own movies and gloat of his achievements as an actor. He is definitely a man that is down-to-earth and has no overrated ego. 1 salute Burt Kwouk for being tlie person tliat he is and making us all laugh at his hilarious antics in the Pink Panther series. - Paul Dale Roberts (Jazma Ambassador) GIRLS COME FIRST (75), the British sex film Burt Kwouk doesn’t remem- ber, also stars Hazel Glyn, later to find fame as Hazel O’Connor. According to legend, director Joe McGrath hated directing sexploitation so much he not only used a pseudonym (‘Croisette Meubles’), but directed’ sex scenes with his back turned to cast members. Kwouk’s (brief) role is as a Kato-like Chauffeur. 1 could be mistaken but I’m sure 1 also spotted Kwouk in THE SANDWICH MAN (66), a fairly laugh free all-star Rank comedy directed by Robert Hartford-Davis, whose next directing assignment was the Peter Cushing horror film CORRUPTION (!). - Ray Murcell #37 is another great issue. Enjoyed the Burt Kwouk interview especially - 1 met him recently in my (and his) local pub in Soho and we had a long chat Ad art created by Akira Fitton about modem Eastern cinema, in particular the merits of wire-work and the outstanding films of Tkui Hark! - ???? SCHIAVELLI Great interview with Vincent Schiavelli. I’ve always enjoyed his acting roles, he’s got a great look and seems highly adaptable, playing benign or villain- ous roles with equal aplomb. Tlie article also settles the trivia dispute of how' his name is pronounced — I was right! - Tom Powers Number 37 was anotlier great issue! However, I was surprised that Anthony Petkovich in the Vincent Schiavelli interview thought BUCKAROO BANZAI was a James Bond parody! If anything, it is a parody of Doc Savage, right down to his being a freelance scientist, surgeon, adv'enturer, musician and having the loyal help of friends who are experts in various fields. Bond was a government licen^ assassin. In the 1930s, Doc Savage’s pulp magazine sold 300,000 issues a month. His series was reprinted in paperback in the ’60s and was a top seller again. Note, too, that Buckaroo has fans who read his monthly magazine in the movie. Savage was a major influence on Supemian (Doc’s name was “Clark,” had a Fortress of Solitude, and was called a “superman” and The Man of Bronze), Batman (father killed by criminals, worked hard to be the best at every'tliing), tlie Fantastic Four (a team who lived in the World’s Tallest Building and their leader was a bril- liant scientist), Indiana Jones, Doc Phoenix, Tom Strong and many others. Doc has never been adapted well, despite being made into a movie, two dif- ferent radio show, and comic books. Also, the review of THE RETURN OF FU MANCHU mentions “Bond type devices,” but those were in the earliest Fu novel from 1913! So Bond type stuff is really Fu Manchu type stuff (Ian Fleming based Dr. No on Fu Manchu). - Patrick Lozito (Brooklyn NY) REVIEWS Your review of DR. GOLDFOOT AND THE GIRL BOMBS (PV 36) caught my eye. I’ve just completed producing a six CD box set for Bear Family Records called “Memphis Belles: The Women of Sun Records.” Although your review credited the music to Les Baxter, one of tlie featured vocalists was Barbara Pittman, who made her first lecords for Sun when she was a teenager in the niid-1950s. It was probably working on movies like DR. GOLDFOOT tliat brought her back to Memphis, where she still lives and occasionally performs. - Hank Davis (Guelph, Ontario) Hello from Tokyo. Issue 37 was great as usual. Loved the UNTAMED WOMEN cover. I’ve seen some of those euro rock festivals that you reviewed. It’s incredible how much of tlie future seemed to be predicted there. NIGHT PATROL might be a technically crap movie but 1 laughed a few times. Some of the one-liners were so bad tliey were funny. I thought THREE ON A MEATHOOK said quite a bit about some people’s ways of parenting in America. - Emperor 6 Hey! In PV #37, you write that “horror movie books ignore SEVEN KEYS....” Not all. In “Horror & SF Films” 1, 1 listed the ’17, ’25, '35 & '47 versions. For HSF2, 1 saw & reviewed the ’47 version... for HSF3, the more recent HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS... and for #4, the ’29 talkie version. And, yes, the Cohan play & subsequent movie adaptations were “very” influential. Recently, I did some research (for a projected year-by-year series on classic American horror movies) & found that, in the 20s, the two most cited works in reviews of thunderstorm mysteries (a tip of the hat to Leslie Halliwell) were 7 KEYS TO BALDPATE and Griffith’s ONE EXCITING NIGHT. Seems like what Cohan started, Griffith kicked into high gear... and Roland West, Paul Leni, & James Whale perfected. - Donald Willis PS Were there 3 silent ver- sions? I found only two.

He's been biusy touring the country with Peter Noone, The Beach Boys, Bobby Rydell, Tlie Association, Lou Chr^tie, Martha Reeses and so many others. - George Schultz (Camden, AiJ) As for Briiui DePalma's student collaboratots credits, Mark Romanek just directed ONE HOUR PHOTO. I don't know if he worked on HOME MOVIES, but when I encountered him in NTC in tlie '80s, he was very proud ot hav- ing worked with DePalma. Couldn't figure why imyone would want to asso- ciate themselves with a cheesy Hitchcock plagiarist, but then Roimuick was and is a smug trust fund baby, so go figure. (I did sound effects for his mid- '80s SIATIC, released briefly by Athuitic and currently erased from history by the studio promoting the now-king of rock video directors' first feature' with Robin Williruns.) - Richard Henderson / dulu t nuike the DePalma conuectinn. hut saw ONE HOUR PHOTO in a llxaler, ml expecima much (especudly from a recent Robin Williams movie) but liked it. JUNGLE GIRL AND THE SLAN'ER; Both LIANE movies were later condensed bv cutter Wolfgang Wehmm to a \"new\" movie (telling a \"different\" story), released in 196 I. It was called LIANE - DIE TOCHTER DF,S DSCHUNGELS. In tlie 80s it was released on \\ideo by the somewhat obscure label \"Sauerland Kunststoffe\" (a manufacturer of plastic materials) in a trun- cated veniion. Tliis version is nothing more tlr.ui an incoherent mess. Both original LLVNE movies were released recently on D\\'D over here for a very low price (around $5). A while after the two LIANE movies the young actress Marion Michael had a serious car accident while making the movie BOMBEN AUF MONTE CARLO. She later sued because of a scar she now had to carry ;uid got 160.000 DM. But her career as an actress was virtually over. After a few more movies, a lot of ups and downs, she tried to kill herself in the mid 70s. Later she learned tlie biLsincss of trading and in '79 she moved with her son to East Gemiany/DDR. Up until '91 she worked as a dubbing assistant on East Gemirui TV. In '94 she said she was working on her biography with 200 pages already writ- ten. Today she lives with her second luLsband near the Polish border By the way, \"Sauerhuid Kunststoffe \" also released some obscure movies like WOMEN OF THE PREHISTORIC PIANET (as Das Steinzeit-Syndroni/Tlie Stoneage-Syndrome); and Al Adiuiison's CARNIVAL ■MAGIC (!). By the way, the mail alwut Ray Dorn and his studio (PV #37) was by me! - Andreas Pieper You are incorrect in both counts in stating that Jim Morrison and Jinii Hendrix played their final shows at the August 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival. Morrison's last perfomiruice was a Doors gig in New Orleiuis in Decernlier of that year. Hie singer died in Paris the following summer. Hendrix made his final concert appearance at the infamous Isle of Fehmarn Festival on Sept. 6, 1970 . By the time the Experience took the stage to close the event, it had degenerated into a shooting war between bvo rival motorcycle gangs. Hendrix died in London twelve days later. While I was growing up in Elsinore, CA in the 1960s, Clarence Muse (NIGHT Vi’ORLD, BLACK .MOON, botli in PV #57) lived nearby on his Muse-A-Vtliile Ranch and was known primarily locally as the comiioser of \"Vtlien It's Sleepy Time Down South, \" abighitforLouisAmistrongin 1931- 1 find it interesting to contemplate that 1931 w'as closer in time to I 966 , tliiui I 966 is to 2002! - Ed Eatinger (i^shland.

He was dressed as the Frankenstein monster and of course, llennaii commented \"It's too bad you couldn't find a costume for your own party.\" - Hugh Shelton I saw the \"Gone but not Forgotten\" entry on Speedy Keene in the last issue. 1 don't know if you're aware of tliis, but Speedy also produced the first (;md arguably the best) album by Motorhead in 1977. - Phil Dalgamo (Glasgow) I always read \"Never to be forgotten \" with interest and nostalgia, and 1 saw the listing of Joe Scheniiie, who was bass player for my favorite group in the 70s, lliree Dog Night. You mentioned in die blurb that there are now 3 rival Three Dog Night groups. I recently (8/25/02) went to a Three Dog Night concert in nearby Santa Fe Springs, CA, a suburb of L.A Tlie group was rep- resented bv Danny Hutton and Cory Wells (singers), Jimmy Greenspoori (keyboards), Michael Allsup (guitars), and a drummer and bassist 1 didn't recognize, and whose names I didn't catch. 1 know that Chuck Negron (actor Tavlor Negron's uncle), fomierly widi the group, is now singing solo (1 heard Chuck on a local radio program a few years ago, explaining diat his heroin addiction and bad behavior led to his bandmates refusing to work again with him; he seems to now be clean and sober). 1 found Negron on the Internet, making a few appearances. It wasn't clear to me that he was calling himself :uid his new backup musicians Three Dog Night. Is this die ^ PSYCHOTRONIC ^ case? And who and what Jire the third group? Tlie only remaining original band member would be drummer Floyd Sneed. Apparently, unlike some other groups, there’s no leg:il battle over the use of the biuid's niune. Or is there? Danny :uid Cor}' and the others sounded great when 1 saw them. 1 did miss Chuck’s voice on songs he led such iis \"One” and \"Joy to the World,” but the gu\\\"S did a great job, regjirdless.

Although 1 generally share most of your opinions, let me raise some objec- tions. You s:tid that the world would be different without movies. But isn't that true about every major invention of die industrial age? I mean, what would the world look like without die car, die phuie, the... (fill in what you like)? This argument leads to nothing and explains nothing. Tliere are such phenomena as movies :uid mass media and we have to cope with them! I don’t believe mov ies have such an impact on peo- ple, although movies changed society, in a way. But the real problem by now is riiass media and 24 hour television. People have never learned to handle it. Our children (1 have none) aren't taught what we over here call “Medienkompetenz\" (media competence). Parents use TV as substitute for upbringing and education. And maybe movies ;uid media are a mirror of wbat ballpens in society, of what people think and do. Tliat even seems scarier than to diink the other way round. But in my country die disciesion about all this went absurd. Recently there was some sort of mas.sacre over here in Erfurt, done by some teenager with ;m assortment of guns. He entered his school and killed 16 or more kids :uid teacheis. Later officials found horror videos and PC-Games in his upiier middle class home. By now it was said, that this \"perveRe crap\" was the trigger to his crime. This is the easiest exphuiation for something that can’t be explained easy. Now the dis- cassion about biuining :dl sorts of movies :uid other media even for adults Ls ag:un in vogue.

Everson :us \"the noted film historian ” in quotation niarlcs. Hie use of quo- tation marks usually denotes disagreement. l£ts set the record straight. Eveison was unarguably not only the most ouLstruidingbut also most influ- ential film historian of the last half century', and acclaimed as such through- out the professional as well as academic world. Hiat having been said, of course .Mr. Weinraub has every right to disagree with one of Everson’s infomied opinions. My own opinion conceming jokes alxiut minorities is that thcvwere acceptable decades ago not only Ixxranse they kidded everyone equallv but because they revealed what vv.as universally considered accept- able at the time they were made. As such, tliey have their place in the history of eiitertainment. - Richard Gordon (N’A’C) Racist mories certainly hue their place in Ih history' of entertainment. Tlxre are way too many of them to iynore and tryinp to rairite history by censoring thm is a mist’uided and impossible ta.sk. Racist mories (and serials, airtoons, newsreels, and shorts) were acaptable to the majority of moriepoers but there was alwavs a road minority speakinp out apainst thm. Tlteir roices didn t start to h taken smously until th 1950s thouph - when all th old mories were dumped on '/\\ and new IV product started recydinp thsame old stereolypi's. To say \"they kidded eretyone ajually” is non- sense and I think it’s time thd fieople sloptmt usinp and hlierinp thd lame excuse. Old Hollywood (and early W) hitvd DESTROY the fntenlial to fit in, pros- per and be treated with respect for blacks, Amerkan Indian.s. and other non white minorities. Amt poor whites inren ’t treated alt thd much htter. It went way beyond kiddinp people and has a LOT to do with race tensions in Ameriai (and th whole world) thd we continue to be Ixpped down with today. Wliy was there no outcry from blacks in the 1920s, 1930s, luiii 19-iO’s over their ixirtrayal in the movies?

Fenady Lirge headlines announce that a two pound can of heroin luis been lost during a deadly shootout between dealers and cops. Police luid gangsters Jirc both searching for it. Jim (star Yale Wexler) and Nick (Morris .Miller) hang out in tlie back room of the gnxery' store owned by tlie father of their short friend Ves (lonatlian Haze). Ves finds the Ciui but throws it out thinking it s worthless. 'Ilie police captain narrator (Frank Ikirding) ex|dains that it contains “junk, II, stuff, snow, mooch, dust, horse...” Blonde Kathy (Aliby Dalton), who works at tlie bowling alley, has threateiied to dump out of work dreamer artist Jim and Nick insists that they sell the dope. Jim ch:uiges his mind after supplying Danny (Allen Knmier), a middle aged junlde who relates fliLshbacks of going “cold turkey” while in jml luid explains addiction. This stark lengthy seg- ment resembles an effective classroom scare film ils Danny says “You need a fix to keep the monkey quiet\" and descrilies “the m:iss of agony you’ve turned into.\" Goons Lenny (Philip .Miuisour) :uid Mitch (llemijui Rudin) tlien start beating infomia- tion out of the naive friends. It’s low budget (with a lot of voice over narration) but a lot more serious and believ'able than many drug movies of the period. With llerschel Bemardi :ls a g:uig leader, Colemiui Francis as a detective, and kid actor John Savage. Music Is by the Hollywood Ch:unk‘r jazz Group. Wexler is the brother of STAKEOlT’s uncredited cinematogniiiher HiLskell Wexler. Roger ComKui wjis :ui uncredited producer of the b/w Warners feature. DEALING: OR THE BERKELEY-TO-BOSTON FORTT-BRICK LOST- BAG BLUES (Trash Palace, 72) D/S/act Paul Williams, S David O'Dell, P Edward R. Pressman Michael Crichton and his brother wrote the b(X)k tliat this Warner feature w:ls b:ised on. Conservative looking Hansard student Peter (Rolx?rt F. Lyons) is sent to Berkeley' by John (}o\\m Lithgow) to bring back a shipment of pot. After he gets high and makes the deal, Susan (Barbara Hershey) takes him to the stu- io she works at :ind says “Ijet’s do coke.\" Soon they’re lounging naked on the floor and he says “You’re some chick.” He arranges for her to fly eiLst with 40 bricks in her luggage but she’s husted at Logan Airport. Peter and John try’ to get the drugs back luid free her, making de:iLs with corrupt detective Murjih (Charles Duming). Everylhing degenerates into comic shootouLs with killer heroin deiiling Cubiuis. It’s fun to see young Lithgow (in his film debut) iis an egotistical cigar smoking dealer w’ho also directs plays :uid sings a show tune STAKEOiT ox DOPE STREET and the location work is interesting. Judging by a reference to Lennon in Toronto and bits of music by Otis, Tlie Dead, Uie Slones, and Springfield, it lakes place in 1968. Also with Joy Bang and Ellen Baiix?r as girlfriends, Paul Sorvino us a cab driver. Buzzy Linhart (singing “You Got What It Takes ’’), Demond Wilson from SANFORD AND SON, Victor Argo, iuid Ste\\'e McQuaMi in a film clip. The print is lelterlioxed.

ADAMSON JESSES GIRLS (Family Home, 73) P/D Al Adamson, S Biidd Donnelly, P Michael F. Goldman In his PV interview (#19), Adiunson claimed that this revenge western wus rijiixxl off by BAD GIRLS (94). He was right. After seeing her preacher hus- band killed :uid lieing gang raixxl. Jessica (Sondra Currie) is trained to shoot hy a sTiiipalhelic prosjiec- tor (Rod Ciuneron with a big Like beard). She then rescues three women who are being transported to jail. They are Rachel (Jennifer Bishop), who is w’uited for murder. Claire ( Regina Carrol), a prosti- tute, and Kana (Ellen Stem), an Indian woman left liehind by the g:uig. Jessica bus discreet sex with a wounded marshall (Geoffrey Land) and Claire does it with a long haired Apache just l)efore her all out punching fight with K:uia - backed by Ixingo music. The actresses all SL\\?m to know how to ride horses luid all (except Bishop, who is the best looking) have topless or nude scenes. Ben Frank plays the gang leader. Aduiison started out working with his father (Denver Dixon) who made B westerns. It’s better scripted and better looking lluui most Adiuuson movies. G:iry’ Graver wus cinematographer and it was shot in scenic Caixtol Ra?f, Dtali. LOST (Prism, 82) D Al Adamson, S Don Buday, P Corey Allen (SKIPPER) .Adiunson succaded in making a P(i rated adventure film that's suitable for kids or parenLs, which is more than you can say alxiul most of the “Lunily films\" I'leing churned out these days. Penny (Sandra Da* in her lust film) :uid her new Nun vet husband Jeff (Don Slew;irt) move to his remote Colorado Springs funily f:inn with her cute 11 year old daughter Buddy (star Sheila Newhouse). Buddy, who grtAv up around race tracks, misses her real father and wuits a horse, but settles for :m old mule to ride to school.

A crazy liearded old mountain man (jack Ehun) wearing ^ PSYCHOTRONIC <4 a dog fur hal rclucLinlly feeds them. Ken Curtis plays a friendly church going neiglibor who helps \\\\ith a search pjirty. Gary' Kent was assistiuit director, stunt co-ordinator, and acts. Tlie scenery' (in Capitol Reef, Utali) is great, Elani and Curtis are likable pros, and Newhouse Ls perfect for her role. Cinematographer Gary Graver directed SUZIE SUPERSTAR (starring Shauna Grant) and CEN- TERSPREAD GIRLS (witli Lisa de Leeuw) the same year. Stewjirt also starred in Ackmison’s CARNIVAL MAGIC (81) and Buckiy aLso wrote KISS MEETS THE PHANTOM (78). MONDO MONDO PAZZO (SW, 63) D/S GualUero Jacopetti, Franco E. Prosperi, P Mario MaiTei, Giorgio Cecchini (MONDO CANE 2) Much of this extremely uneven Mondo followup is dated, weak, Jind/or obviously staged. \\bu get a French drag show, jui Americiui undertiiker school, Chinese bird and fish fights in Singapore, Mexicjui Day of tlie Dead customs, and Massjii who use dung for everything and eat stones. Religious mania is represented by Indian faldrs, hysterical Italians, bleeding Portuguese penitentiaries, and Spiuiiards practicing for their own funends. A segment on an “American\" photo studio specializing in sce nes of horror and death is elaborate, clever luid fun - but sure looks Euro to me. Tlie end sequence with men on stage being slapped to music is ridiculous and fake. The segment on slavery' starts as an excuse to show topless hlack women. A British officer calmly putting crippled star\\'ed little black kids in chains is disturbing until you notice how staged it is - :uid tlien it’s still disturbing. Gunfights and lynching^ are recreated at Tombstone and the (Brit) narrator claims that they just recently stopjied “lynching Negroes\" for tourists (!). I do believ'e that English Victories in Africa were responsible for tlie pathetic mass deatlis of rare wb.ite fliiniingos. The part about South Vietnamese monks is also more or less sadly real. We’re told tliat President Dielini has “dechired martial law, had Buddhist temples destroyed and monks put into concentration caniiis.\" We see news footage of citizens shav- ing their heads in mass protests and (on May 2, 1963), the first monk publicly setting himself on fire after gasoline is poured on him. It all sounds like what you’d expect of the Northern Commies (or our Chinese business pjirtners occu- pying Tibet today). Seeing this bmught back childhood memories of when I saw burning orange robed monks in Life magazine. Like MONDO CANE this was a worldwide smash. Rizzoli films rele:ised it here in ’64 with 20 mins, cut luid Cineniation later re-released it rated R. Tliis is the uncut version. Tlie theme by The Four Preps (with Ed Cobb) was produced by David Axelrod. Witli a world of cruelty' and madness to chronicle why did the successful “documentary'\" team fake so much? Because they' could, just like TV’ shows today. Tlie filmniakens returned witli the ev'en more inflammatory and suspect AFRICA BLOOD AND GUTS (66) and FAREWELL UNCLE TOM (71). EUROPEAN NIGHTS (SW, 59) D Alessandro BlasetU, S Ennio de Concini, Gualtiero Jacopetti (ELIROPA DI NOTTE) This look at Euro nightclub and circus acts has a line- up similar to THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW (if it had been in bright color then and included strippers!). The credits are real neon signs and it opens with a won- derful scale model of famous cities. An Italian cIowti troop (Rastellis) mixes music with violence in a memorable way. One member is a black guy in blackface. Ttiere’s a comic magiciiui and the famous Channing Pollack does sleight of hand routines with cards and doves. The (black) American Archie Savage Dancers do a great dance and song routine. Gloria Jones (later a member of The Blossoms and wife of Marc Bolan) is the featured Josephine Baker type ’20s dancer. Domenico Modugno (known for the original “Volare\") sings three songs (in Italian). One is about the wonders of coffee. Colin Hicks does Fats Domino’s “I Love You So\" and Eddie Cochran’s “TVventy Flight Rock\" (with a drum solo). Hicks (brother of Brit star Tommy Steele) and his band (The Cabin Boys) put on a wild Bill Haley style show and audi- ence members scream and dance - but it’s obviously staged. The Platters do “You’ll Never Know\" (an international hit in ’57) in color (Zora Taylor has red hair). Three very sexy strip|)ers (the stern looking one is Vietnamese) are backed by a black jazz band. The (staged) reaction shots of men and their wives are a nice touch. A guy sings to chorus girls but the focus is on a beau- tiful young Asian woman wearing flower pasties. You also get belly, flamenco, and can can dancers, Ukranian balaleika musicians and dancers and too many acrobats. Parts were shot in actual clul)s but the London segments were faked on sets. For this ’63 American v'ersion, narrator Henry Morgan uses mild sarcasm to joke about the credits and even his own narration. He doesn’t believe that a very sexy' blonde in a gay club is actually a man (you won’t either). The late Morgan wits an I’VE GOT A SECRET pimelist for 15 (!) years. I had a great time being on his NTC radio show w'hen the first PV book was published. He wanted to talk about WILD WOMEN OF WONGO! This tape also includes a b/w Gemian short about stripjiers (with more nudity than the fea- ture), stills of adults only ads and a very' impressive and new (to me) quick edit comp of numy SW release clips (by categories). 60s MUSICALS 63) THE YOUNG SWINGERS (The Video Beat!, P/D Maury Dexter, S Harry Spalding Mel (Rod Lauren) runs a storefront co-op Hootenanny espresso nightclub. Ruthless rich businesswoman “Old Lady” Crawford Qo Helton) orders her creepy bald lawyer Mort Qiistin Smith) to do whatev'er it takes to force him out so she can build a highrise. Her singing blonde niece Vicki (Molly Bee) falls for Mel though and helps sabotage the devious schemes. Pete O^tck Lirson from TEENAGE .MIL- LIONAIRE) is the jive talking comic MC partner who does impressions of Ed Sullivan and Grandpa McCoy during his “Watusi Surfer\" song. Tlie third partner is the deep voiced black crooner Fred (Gene McDaniels, the only cast member who actually had hits) who does “Mad Mad Mad\" and “Follow Your Dreams.” Patrons W\\is{ to a jazz band, and the leads both sing, but the only folk music is by the male/female duo The Sherw'ood Singers who do “Elijah\" (about an old black man) and Hoyt Axton’s “Greenback Dollar.” Tliev' leave out the “damn” like Tlie Kingston Trio did on their chart version. It all ends hap- pily at a pool party' as the whole cast sings “Greenback\" again. Lauren (aka Siadian), who was good in THE CRAUIING HAND, reminds me of young Johnny Depp. 1 once owned an LP by Ba^ (aka Beachbojird) just for her sexy glitter cowgirl cover. Once a regular on THE TENNESSEE ERNIE FORD SHOW, she was later in HIIIBILLIES IN A HAUNTED HOUSE (67). Tliis 71 min. b/w 20th Century' Fox musical was on AMC. SURF PART\\ (The Video Beall, 64) P/D Maury Dexter, S Harry Spaulding Blonde Terry' (Patricia Morrow), Junior Qackie DeShannon), and Syhia (Lory Patrick) from Phoenix, arrive at Malibu Beach in a trailer. All the male char- acters in this 68 min. b/w 20th Century Fox musical are pathetic in one way or another. Terry' likes Len (star Bobby Vinton), a boring loner nice guy who owns a surfboard shop, Sylvia falls for Terry’s egotistical swinging bachelor brother Skeet Oerry' Summers, usually a stuntman) who is “tlie top hot dogger at the lodge,\" and Junior likes the short comic relief “gremmie\" Milo (Kenny Miller) who risks his life to join the lodge. Cranky' Sgt. Neal (Richard Crane in his last film) hanisses all of them and Skeet turns out to be a patlietic lying gigolo sup- ported by a rich older woman (Martha Stewart). Tlie Astronauts do the excel- lent opening surf music tlienie (offscreen) and another instrumental at a party' and Tlie Routers (white standins for a black studio band) do “Crack Up.” DeShannon sings the best song (“Glory Way\"), a surf gospel (!?) number, com- 12 ^ PSYCHOTRONIC ^ plete wth handshaking hallelujahs. Tlie girls tet and sing ‘ Never Coinin' Back in tlieir trailer :uid Morrow and Miller both have uniinpressiTO solo s|X)Ls. The songs hy top billed Vinton are lame even for him and he was never asked to act again. Mickey’ Dora is one of the surfing doubles. DeShannon had more to do in C’MON LETS LIVE A LmiE (PV #35). Dexter also dirccted WILD ON THE BEACH fPV#36). WHEN THE BOYS MEET'DIE GIRLS (The Video Beal!, 65) D Alvin Ganzer, S Robert E. Kent, P Sam Kiitzman Rich handsome Danny Churchill (Harve Presnell) :md short comic relief Sam Ooby Baker— Elvis sidekick inGIRLHAl’PY) drive west to attend a college after causing a minor scandal back east. Tliey mat backwoods mail delivery woman Ginger (Connie Francis) by driving her horee off the road. Her lovable father (Frank Faylen from DOBIE GILLIS) loses all his money in Reno then sells his huid to a devious businessniiui (Fred Clark). Everyone is ha|)|)y when a dude ranch for divorced women is opened and many divorce jokes are told. Presnell croons and Francis sings several mediocre numlreis which is a shame because she had one of the greatest voices in pop music. Her last top 40 hit had been in ‘64 and this was her last movie. Danny's blackmailing ex, Tess (Sue Ann Langdon) also sings and dances and she and other chorus girls sing \"Treat Me Rough.\" Louis Amistrong sings \"Tlirow It Out Of Your Mind, \" Liberace does \"Aruba Liberace,\" and unfunny comics Davis And Reese do a bo,xer routine. Sam Tire Sham And Tlie Pharaolis do \"Monkey See, Monkey Do\" which is great but they're interrupted and upstaged by guys in drag doing the fmg. At least Herman's Hermits are left alone while doing their hit #3 \"Listen People\" and Peter Noone has a few lines as an exchange student. If this seems dated for tlie 60s its because it was based on a Gershwin musical filmed as GIRL CRAZY in '32 (with Wlieeler and WooLsey) then in '43 (with Mickey Rooney :uid Judy Garland) . A big outdoor production number (Gershwin's \"I Got Rhythm\") looks like an outtake from SEVEN IJRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS. The tayx; is letterboxed. G.inzer also directed COUNTRY MUSIC HOLIDAY (58). Presnell is still on TV and in movies. THE COOL ONE,S (67) D/S Gene Nelson, S Joyce Geller, Robert Kauliman. P William Conrad Tliis Warner Brothers musical comedy is old fashioned boy meets girl nonsense, but is also a show biz spoof with some great period detail. Tlie WIZ BANG show looks just like HULLABALLOO and the young eccentric rich music producer is a Phil Spector take off. Blonde Hallie (Debbie Watson), a WIZ BANG dancer, wants to be a singer so badly that she grabs tlie microphone from a star (Glen Campbell!) during the taping of the show. She soon falls for Cliff Donner (Gil Peterson), a nice but washed up early 60s style blonde \"overnight has been\" pop star. Tliey have comic misunderstandings and she calls him a rat fink and a dingaling. Tony Kruriini (Roddy McDowall) becomes her manip- ulating manager and producer and insists that Cliff sings with her. Tlie new singing duo create a new dance sensation (the Tantrum). Tony's older brother (Robert Coote) owns a P.alnis Springs nightclub where the house b:uid (Tlie Leaves) do part of their Bo Diddly on drugs song \"Dr. Stone \" and the TV show's wardrobe lady (Mrs. Miller) wurbles \"It's Magic.\" The other music is slicker Hollywood pop, but it was written and supervised by Lee Hazelwood and Hallie's singing voice was provided by an uncredited Nanw Sin.itra - so the duets are very cool sounding. With Nita Talbot as Tony's sedurtive assistant Dee Dee, Phil Harris as the show's producer, George Forth as his assistant, unbilled David Winters and Teri Garr as dancers, Tlie Bantams, Angelique Pettyjohn, and a huge computer. Floyd Crosby was the cinematographer and Toni Basil was tlie choreographer. Tlie score is by Ernie Freeman and Billy Strange was the arranger. The very likable Watson had starred on the short lived sitcoms KAREN (64) and TAMMY (65) and was Marilyn in MUNSIERS GO HOME! (66).

Hie whole middle 20 mins, is a biblical flashback told to chil- dren by a priest who Iras illegally returned to his fomier church. Most movies using old footage try to hide tlie fact, but this 75 min. Panuiiount release boasts right up front that it's \"Glorified by spectacular episodes front Cecil B. DeMille's epic THE TEN CO.VLVlANDiVlENTS. Tile silent ('23) scenes include the original title cards and are narrated. Tlie pyramids are built, idols are woishiped, and Mos(5 receives the commandments (big letters in lightning) and pans the Red Sea. llie Pharaoh declares “We .shall grind Israel into the dust!\" COMMAND- ME,NTS includes Edward Van Sloan as a doctor, John Carradine as a Communist speech maker (\"We have no faith but the state!\"), Kent Taylor, Joe Siiwv’er, and in the silent footage.

Rachmil American View magazine write r Matt Coitiri (Elliott Reid) goes to remote Winnoga Lake for a fishing vacation. He dis- covers that the fish have all died .and the near ghost town is being run like a private police state near a heavily guarded genu wiufare lah in a lodge run by Dr. Bucholz (Otto Waldis - who had been in the origin.il M). Loomis (a blonde R.iymond Burr) and his motlier (Lurene Thttle) ran the inn. Corbin, forbidden to le.ive, takes photos, works on an expose, and (foolishly) confronts tlie leaders with tlieir crimes. He also finds time to fall for Karen (Carla Balenda), the sister of killer THFttvtPHAKT, B.irrier), who resembles Gregoiy Peck in THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL A scene of “human guinea pigs\" and scary close-ups of sinister faces m.ike this very much like a horror movie. Also with Michael Steele, Robert Tlioni, .ind Milton Kibbee (also in STRANGE HOLIDAY!). This had been shot .is an anti-fas- cist movie in the 4(^ .as THE MAN HE FOUND, but executive producer Howard Hughes had scenes of Hitler (actor Bobby Watson) in America removed and a new prologue set in the Kremlin added. Editing easily turned the Nazi spies, doctors and thugs into Communists. A few more editing changes and it could be about a S.itantic or supernatural cult. Reid, who resembles Henry Fonda at times, had been a star of the radio Suspense series. Bricker had written the '46 Rondo Hatton movies THE BRUTE MAN and HOUSE OF HORRORS. Menzies went on to INVADERS FROM MARS (53). Rachmil also produced THE 27TH DAY (PV #37) - and years later - FOOllOOSE (84)! Tlie RKO release has been on AMC. STRANGE HOLIDAY (1945) D/S Arch Oboler, P A. W. Hackel, Edward Finney, Max King The creator of tlie famous Lights Out! radio series made this (.is THE DAY AFTER TO.VIORROW) in '42 (just itifter Pearl Harbor) as a 40 min. short based on his radio play (Tliis Precioas Freedom) for General Motors as a warning for work- ers who didn't take the Gemian threat seriously enough. MG.M acquired tlie ^ P8YCH0TR0NIC ^ 13 short. He later added a long narrated intro of impressive movie battle scenes to show how wiufare had changetl owr the wars ending with iictual A bomb explo- sions. He also did mediting and had Swastika blacked out to change N:izis into Communists. Olwler released it thmugh his own Elite Pictures (at 6l mins.) in the f;dl of '45 (shortly :dter Hiroshima). PRC then cut out the FDR prologue and re-rele;ised it (at only 55 mins.) in late '46. Memvhile star Claude Rains had become more famoiis and was known for nniking a then record million plus dolkus to co-snir in the British epic CAF,SAR A.\\U CLEOPATRA (46). When war pkuit worker John Stevenson (Rains, in top fonn) returns from a fishing vaca- tion on Friday 'Hie 1.5th, he discorets to his horror that his nice safe American town has become part of a paninoid nightmare police state. His wife (Gloria Holden) and children are taken away :uid he's jailed ;md beaten siivagely and frequently jiest for deniiuiding his righls. A black prisoner (an unbilled actor) exphiins that \"Tlie part of the Constitution about rights had ten thrown out.\" Tlie s:idistic e.\\:uniner (M;irtin Kosleck) tells him about riots followed by \"Tlic New Order. \" A greiU looking collage of moudis criticize Democnicy.

After an A tenb blast he wakes, now aware th:it \"Freedom is never a gift. \" Tlie disorienting fragmented structure was decades idiead of its time and this devastating patchwork feature could be coiasidered Olxiler's CITIZEN KANE. It's noUible that he :uul Orson Welles botli became famous doing radio, made a few corUroversiid American movies, then had to seek hinds overseas. Cinematognrpher Robert Surtees later shot THE LAST PlcniRE SHOW (71). Also vvitli Milton Kibliee (fish- ing friend), Priscilla Lyons, Barbara Bates, Allxirt Bassemian, Paul Dubov, Helen Mack, and little Tommy Cook as a newsboy. OPERATION EICIIM.ANN (6l) D R. G. Springsteen, S “Lewis Copley” (Lester Cole), P Samuel Bischoff, David Diamond Tlie Nazi \"final solution\" is explained by Col. Karl Adolf Eichimmn (Werner Klemperer) at a secret meeting in \"41. Workers are seen instidling showers and carrying lioxes of Zyklon B, Ovens later replace gas to help hide the evidence. As the war is being lost, concentration camp prisoners are herded into trucks. Eichmann has them all shot but 14 year old David, Jxob and some other kids and babies survive among the bodies. A [xist war tem|)le service is intercut with actual footage of Eisenhower viewing bodies. Eichmann escapes, assumes the identity of a dead soldier and reunites with his blonde lover Anna (Rnta Lee), saying “They will pay for their cruelty to us!\" They relocate to Spain, then Kuwait (!). David (Donald Buka from Clevehuid, who narrates) and Jacob (Steve Gravers) become adult volunteer Nazi hunters based in Israel. When David's wife Sara (Barbara Dirner) asks him to leave the past alone, he says the-y must \"Never let the world forget! \" Wlien Mlied ArtlsLs released this b/w feature, Eichmann (from the same Austrian town as Hitler) was on trial in Israel after being kidnajtped from Argentina. He was executed. 1 KXiAN'S 1 lEROES fans would be surprised to see Klemperer and John Banner (as Rudolph Hess !) laughing about tlie Auschwitz plans while enjoying dinner. Also with Eric Bracdon. Cole, a founder of Tlie Screen Actors Guild, had ten one of The Hollywood Ten. Springsteen usually directed B westenus :md TV shows. Tlimer is Jennifer Jason Leigh's motlier.

P Julius Hagen (THE LODGER) The first remake of a Hitchcock movie had the simie star as the 1926 original. Hie piano playing Eastern European Michel Angeloff (Novello) rents a room ;a the Bunting frmiily home while everyone is talking about a series of \".Avenger\" murders (based on Jack Tlie Ripper). Hie owners telephone ojierator daughter Daisy' (Elizalieth Allan) hears the dying screams of a victim over the phone so has to apjiear at a court inquest. Her self seniiig reporter fiance Jack (youngjack Hawkins in his first role) routinely makes up interview qirotcs. Villen he tells the Buntings that a victim's \"throat was slit from ear to ear! \" the film cuLs to Angeloff playing a violin. The high strung over sensitive foreigner declares his love for Daisy but warns \"Don't ever be alone with me!\" He also says that the killer \"should be put out of his misery!” He's eventually arrested, escapes in handcuffs, and is chased by a mob from a dance hall. In tlie end he saves Daisy from the real killer - his asylum escajiee brother. In the orig- inal, he was seeking to avenge the murder of his sister. Much is made of com- munication by telephone. Scenes of an ominous staircase made me think of PSYCHO. A W' Baskeomb and Barbara Everest play the parents. Hiis is the cut (67 mins.) \"35 American release version. Hie original ran 85 mins. Hie editing is |X)or and the rare print has some juniiis. Hie story was also remade under various muiies stirring Laird Cregar (44), Valentine Dyall (50 -PV # 9), and Jack Pakuice (53). Novello, a popular silent movie romantic idol, singer, and playwright, was a gay Welshman Iwnt David Davies. He was recently a charac- ter in Altiiaii's GOSFORD PARK, Allen, wJio is very good here, had a successful Hollywood career which included MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (35). HOUSE OF MYSTERY ( 6 I) D/S Vernon Sewell, S Pierre Mills, P Julian Wintle, Leslie Parkyn A couple find and want to buy a country \"dream house\" but can't believe that the asking price is so low. A soft spoken woniiui there tells them tlie empty house is haunted but they don't believe her so she relates a series of flashbaclcs. Electrical engineer Mr. Lemming (Peter Dyiieley) is discovered dead after his wife Stella Oane Hylton) left with his best friend. The next cou- ple (Nanette Newman and Maurice Kaufmann) that move in have strange electrical probler.is and the ghost of Lemming appears on their TV' screen. An electrician can't figure it out and a psychic (Colin Gordon) just explains ESP Wlien a Scottish medium (Molly IJrquhart) conducts a seance flashbxks inside of flashbxks explain what happened. It's fun tlie way ghosts are mixed with modem technology (I think all TV's are probably haunted) and this only 56 min. rar- ity has some good plot twists. Also with John Merivale, and Colette Wilde. Sewell also made FRENZV' (aka lATlN QUARTER (46), and GHOST SHIP (53) both also based on the same play by Mills. Dyneley and Hylton had also both been in THE MANSTER (!), filmed in Japan. Newman was later in THE STEPFORD WIVES (75), directed by her husband Bryan Forbes. Hianks to Michxl Will who tiqied this from CBC. SATURDAY NIGHT OUT (Video Beat!, 63) P/D Robert Ilartford- Davis, S Donald and Derek Ford Several characteis (all with heavy accents) are followed as a group of merchant se:unen dock in London and head for pubs, clubs, women and trouble. Australian Lee Oohn Bonney) meets and tries to figure out Penny (Heather Sears), an eccentric \"vegan\" anarchist in bixk boots and pigtails. Widower Mr. Hudson (Bernard Lee) nearly falls for tlie elaborate blxkmail scam of the French Wanda (Erika Remberg). Hie pushy loud John (Inigo Jxkson) becomes a victim of Garden Of Eden club bar girl hookers who do the twist, push watered down oveipriced champagne and roll johns. Arthur (David Lodge) stays with nice hooker Julie (pin up model Margaret Nolan) in her flat and young Jamie (Colin Campbell), helps a drunk old lady (Patricia Hayes) home and finds a relationship witli Jean (Francesca Annis) . It's all pretty work- OPERAWJX EICHMW 14 ^ PSYCHOTRONIC ^ NYC THE TIME MACHINE (WB, 02) D Simon Wells, S John Logan, P Walter E Parkes, Da\\id Valdes Alex (Guy Pearce), a Columbia University dissociate professor, invents a time nidichine in his huge turn of the century NYC lab. After going back four years and failing to save the life of Ills fiance (Sienna Guillory), he heads for the future. As a childhood fan of the original movie, 1 expected to hate tliis PG-13 Dreamworks feature (like I hated the PLANET OF THE APES remake) but with an $80 million budget and ILM FX it sure looks bet- ter. The future is altered when the moon breaks up in 2037 (instead of by nuclear war). Tlie cliff dweller Eloi are a multi racial tribe instead of blondes in togdis and they tr>' to escape from the scary face cannibal Morlocks instead of just calmly walking to their doom. Emma (African/Irish singer Samantha Mumea) looks good in a see through top. Tlie Morlocks (who run like dogs) cage her for breeding stock. Characters not found in the I960 version are an intelligent Morlock leader Oeremy Irons, looking and sounding like Boris Karloff!) and an eternal NYC Public Library holognun (Orlando Jones). Tlie Ciist includes Samantha’s brother Kalen Omero Mumba (as her long haired kid), Mark Addy (Alex’s friend), and Phyllida Lane (landlady). References are made to tlie Pal movie mid a stage production and Alan Young has a bit part. 1 was surprised to learn that die impressive old Manhattmi scenes were filmed in various upstate New York places including ones I’ve been to (Saratoga Springs, and Vassar U.). We saw the letter- boxed DV’D version. Wells, a great grandson of 11. G., had previously directed THE PRINCE OF EGYP1’ and three other animated features. Logan wrote GIADIATOR (00). HAMLET (Miramax, 00) P/D Michael Almereyda, P Andrew Fierberg, Amy Hobby Around Halloween in N^'C, Hamlet (Ethan Hawke) broods because his uncle Claudius (Kyle MacLachhui) has taken over his father’s multi media Denmark Corp. and married his mother (Diane Venora). The spirit of his fadier (Sam Shepard) confirms that he was murdered. Hamlet uses his computer to edit a short containing scenes from HAMLET movies that exposed the crime. His “To be or not to be’’ speech is first heard in a Blockbuster storr?. Ophelia Qulia Stiles), a photographer, is used to destroy Hamlet then kills herself in tlie Guggenheim museum. When Hmnlet duels with her brother Laertes (Liev Schrieber) the it^feree is tlie late Paul Bartel. 1 had a problem with tlie long stretches of old Shakespearean dialog. I enjoyed hearing tlie Eartha Kitt mes- sage in tlie cab and Primal Scream’s version of The 13th Floor Elevators’ “Slip Inside This House’’ in a club though. With Steve Zhiui and Dechen Thumian (Uma’s brotlier) as Rosencrantz luid Guildenstem, ruid clips from James Dean movies and THE CROW 11. One clip in Ihunlet’s short has a Something Weird logo on it! This wiis shot (on 16 mm) for $2 million (ver}' low tliese day's). LET THE DEVIL \\XEAR BLACK (PV #33) was a direct to video Hamlet update. Almereyda made NADJA (94) and THE ETERNAL (PV #31). Stiles (who I’ll watch in anything) was idso in the Shakespeare updates lEN THINGS 1 HATE ABOUT YOU (99) iuid 0 (02). DECONSTRUCTING HARRY (Warner, 97) D/S star Woody Allen, Pjean Doumanian Allen has directed six (!) movies since tliis but it’s new to me, so... Harry Block (Allen), a pill popping, heavy’ drinking, divorced fomier Bellvue patient athe- ist autlior with writer’s block narrates flashbacks inside of flashbacks to his shrink. Fantasy', dreams and reality blur as we see him as a teenager (Tobey SPIDERMAN Maguire) imd a tliinly disguised book character (Richard Benjamin) carrying on an affair with his sister in law Qudy Davis) during a funerid. He loses his latest young girlfriend Fay (Elizabetli Shue) to his friend Larry (Billy Cry'stal). Harry takes an elevator down to Hell, complete with top- less women and he and a cheerful Larry'/Satan compare sins. He brings hooker Cookie (Hazelle Goodman) along when being honored by his college and his paranoid friend Richard (Bob Balaban) dies during the drive. His mother tliinks his father (who also goes to Hell) is a cannibal. Ttie editing is jumpy on purpose and characters from different realities meet. Tlie sound- track is 40s big b:uid jazz. Some have called this dark comedy a copy of WILD STRAWBERRIES (57), but I tliink Allen has been influenced by Bunuel as much as Bergman. It’s similar to some of his"
