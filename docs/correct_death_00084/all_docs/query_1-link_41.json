        "text": "The recently renamed Bo Diddley Community Plaza will ring out with the sounds of its namesake performer with a musical tribute planned for Oct. 24.\n\nLed by longtime Diddley sideman and Gainesville guitarist Scott Free, the tribute from 8 to 10 p.m. also will feature members of Diddley's family as well as notable musicians from around the area.\n\nFree, who accompanied Diddley for five years in the band Offspring as well as with his own group, Munkeez Strikin Matchiz, will be joined by guitarists Joe Cosenza, Shelton Irwin, percussionist Obamiero Ogunleye, harmonica player Ron Anton, vocalist Earlene Walker and keyboardist Vernon Montonya. The soul power trio Ampersand, with keyboardist Danny Rochelle, bassist Ashley Wilkinson and drummer Drew Allen, will serve as the core band for the night.\n\nThe event also is billed as a canned food drive in Diddley's honor, with listeners asked to bring one canned food item for donation to area food banks.\n\nAlong with producing a 2005 album for Munkeez Strikin Matchiz that included performances by Diddley, Parliament/Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell, Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and others, Free also played guitar on the \"Bo Don't Know Diddley\" Nike ad campaign with Diddley and Bo Jackson and performed with Diddley on NBC's \"The Today Show\" as well as in many other appearances.\n\nDiddley, who lived near Archer for 30 years, died June 2 at age 79. The famed singer/guitarist/rock pioneer had appeared numerous times over the years at Gainesville's Downtown Community Plaza, which was renamed in his honor after his death."
