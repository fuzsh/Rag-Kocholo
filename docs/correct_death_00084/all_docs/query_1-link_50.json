        "text": "Bo Diddley, a singer and guitarist who invented his own name, his own guitars, his own beat and, with a handful of other musical pioneers, rock 'n' roll itself, died Monday at his home in Archer, Fla . He was 79.\n\nThe cause was heart failure, a spokeswoman, Susan Clary, said. Diddley had a heart attack last August, only months after suffering a stroke while touring in Iowa.In the 1950s, Diddley — along with Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis and a few others — helped reshape the sound of popular music worldwide, building it on the templates of blues, southern gospel and rhythm and blues. His original style of R&B influenced generations of musicians. And his Bo Diddley syncopated beat — three strokes/rest/two strokes — became a stock rhythm of rock 'n' roll.\n\nIt can be found in Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away,\" Johnny Otis's \"Willie and the Hand Jive,\" Steppenwolf's \"Magic Carpet Ride,\" The Who's \"Magic Bus,\" Bruce Springsteen's \"She's the One\" and U2's \"Desire,\" among hundreds of other songs.\n\nYet the rhythm was only one element of his best records. In songs like \"Bo Diddley,\" \"Who Do You Love,\" \"Mona,\" \"Crackin' Up,\" \"Say, Man,\" \"Ride On Josephine\" and \"Road Runner,\" his booming voice was loaded up with echo and his guitar work came with distortion and a novel bubbling tremelo. The songs were knowing, wisecracking and full of slang, mother-wit and sexual cockiness. They were both playful and radical."
