        "text": "Bo Diddley, born as Ellas Otha Bates, later changed to Ellas McDaniel (McComb, 30 december 1928 - Archer, June 2, 2008), was an influential American rock and rollsinger andguitarist-. His style, characterized by the metallic guitarriffs and propulsive rhythms, influenced countless musicians, although his work rarely has managed to reach the charts.\n\nLife Course[Edit][]\n\nIn his youth he was given violin lessons. After hearing he decided blues guitarist John Lee Hooker . In the 1950s he began to play with his regular partner, themaracasPlayer Jerome Green. In the mid-fifties he got a contract with the record company in Chicago -based Chess Records. Diddley played guitar-originally a home-built, square on his record covers always neatly dressed with bow tie and Scottish Plaid jackets. His trademark during real performances were a pair of sunglasses and the equally inseparable (bol) hat.\n\nHis first single, \"Bo Diddley\" based on a Lullaby, introduced the beatcharacteristic for him, which later would be copied many times. Influential is also the emphasis on theguitar -driven by the rhythm in the number.\n\nLater were released even more singles, including \"I'm a Man\", \"Who Do You Love?\", \"Mona (I need you baby)\" and \"Road Runner\". Even though at the time no major successes were, certainly not compared to the hits of his Chess-colleague Chuck Berry, these and other songs covered on a regular basis and they are proved to be a major influence on other important musicians. Among others The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Buddy Holly, Muddy Waters, The Animals, Quicksilver Messenger Service,The Pretty Things and The Yardbirds have covers and renditions of songs by Bo Diddley alias e. McDaniel played.\n\nIn the 1960s, stopped Bo Diddley recording plates. He would still occasionally occur, including in the opening act for The Clash, in the late 1970s. Bo Diddley In 1987 was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In that same year, he also appeared in the film Hail, Hail Rock and Roll from Taylor Hackford, a documentary in which he and around Chuck Berry Little Richard reminisces to their glory years.\n\nOn 16 May 2007, Bo Diddley suffered a stroke after a gig and recorded on the IC at a hospital in Omaha (Nebraska). [1] a year later, during his rehabilitation, he died after a heart attack in Florida, at the age of 79.
