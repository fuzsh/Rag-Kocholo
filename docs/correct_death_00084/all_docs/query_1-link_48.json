        "text": "Bo Diddley strolled through The Gainesville Sun's newsroom in late 2003, flirting with female staffers, shaking any extended hand and, for the most part, tolerating me.\n\nThe Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Famer was days away from turning 75, and my job, as the paper's entertainment editor, was to herd Diddley beyond the distractions of being Bo Diddley and into a photo studio packed with birthday balloons. There, we would ask Diddley - THE Bo Diddley - to take out his box guitar, riff a bit and allow us to take photos.\n\nOh, and we planned to throw confetti at him. I had been to a party store hours earlier and loaded up on colorful favors to use as props for Diddley's photo shoot, which would be used for a story package about Diddley's birthday concert later that month.\n\nThe idea was simple: literally shower Bo with party crud as he grooved on his box guitar and a photographer snapped photos. And all went very, very well - until I asked Diddley if he would wear a Hello Kitty birthday hat.\n\nThe response was clearly disgusted and declarative: \"No, man, I'm not wearing that.\"\n\nHe did not look up - a polite way of telling us we were pushing it - and continued to riff on his guitar. A small crowd had gathered in the studio at this point, mostly newsroom staffers who, myself included, discarded objectivity and cynicism to bask in Bo's airspace.\n\nYou see, people toss around the word \"legend\" too often and too loosely these days. But Diddley was a rock 'n' roll cornerstone and, make no mistake, a legend.\n\nHe was a legend who had settled near Archer and, more notably, became an active member in that community. He was a legend who played benefit concerts and made many friends in North Central Florida.\n\nA legend who refused to trade his signature felt black hat for a paper cone and a rubber band. A legend who was growing tired of a photo shoot with too many silly trappings and too many gawkers.\n\nSo Bo started singing along to his bluesy ad-libs. I can't remember the exact lyrics, but the message was clear, albeit subtle:\n\n\"Better leave me alone/Better get outta my face ...\"\n\n\"Bo, you doing OK?\" we asked.\n\n\"Oh yeah, I'm fine,\" he responded cordially before dropping back into the blues: \"Gettin' sick of this place/Better leave me alone ...\"\n\nBo left the office on good terms that day, the photos turned out great, as did the story. The birthday concert, by the way, was more than just a reminder that the 75-year-old still had amazing chops. The heart of the event was Diddley christening a new performing arts hall in Gainesville.\n\nAnd that photo of Diddley smiling amid balloons and a hail of confetti always makes me smile. This is my Diddley story, and, I must say, it's a good one.\n\nIt seems everybody has a Bo Diddley story. He was undisputed royalty in rock and blues circles, a man who inspired everyone from The Rolling Stones to Tom Petty. Yet, in Florida, he also was a neighbor as approachable as Floyd the barber.\n\nSo when Bo died Monday, the Diddley stories surfaced en masse. Journalists recalled his pull-no-punches interviews, while musicians recalled impromptu jam sessions and that beloved Bo Diddley beat. All, however, recalled a gentle, sometimes-grumpy soul who knew more about being a good neighbor than acting like a celebrity.\n\n\"He was a giant. He was one of the 50 immortals,\" said Dunnellon banjo player Mark Johnson. \"But here's the thing about Bo Diddley: He was so accessible to the people. If somebody wanted him to play some small charity event, he'd show up and do it.\"\n\nJohnson has great Diddley stories, too. The two musicians once got their gear crossed while sharing a plane to Indiana for gigs.\n\nLater, Johnson ran into Diddley at IGA Supermarket in Bronson. Johnson was buying breakfast, and Bo was chatting up the cashiers. The next thing Johnson knew, he was playing his new Deering banjo for Diddley in the store's parking lot, which then prompted Diddley - now sitting in the cab of his truck - to perform his new song \"Leave\" for Johnson.\n\nA bit surreal, Johnson admits: A clawhammer banjo picker in boots trading tunes with Bo Diddley at 8 a.m. in a grocery store parking in Levy County.\n\nThese are the glorious moments of homespun spontaneity that framed Diddley's life. The commercial windfall of his music skirted him, and he rightfully groused about it to the end.\n\nBut, days after his death, one thing is clear: Everybody has a Bo Diddley story to tell, and THAT is the benchmark of a true legend."
