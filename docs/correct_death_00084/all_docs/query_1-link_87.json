        "text": "Bo Diddley and his Orchestra, the Soulful Deacons and their Orchestra, at the Crystal Ballroom, Portland, Oregon, July 2, 1967\n\nDiddleyâ€™s songs regularly charted on the US R&B and Pop charts for a decade after his first record debuted in 1955. By the mid-1960s his prominence on the charts had waned, but his influence and legacy continued to grow due to his iconic sound, enduring hits, and incessant touring schedule, including this stop in Portland in 1967. He continued to regularly record and tour until he suffered from a heart attack in 2007.\n\nMoPOP Permanent Collection"
