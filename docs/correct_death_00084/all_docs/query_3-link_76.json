        "text": "GWEN IFILL:\n\nMusician Bo Diddley also died today. The guitarist's career spanned more than five decades. Early on, his music caught the ear of the Chess Brothers, who owned a Chicago-based recording label.\n\nBo Diddley's story was told as part of a 1995 PBS series, \"Rock & Roll.\" Here is an excerpt.\n\nBO DIDDLEY, Musician:\n\nI taught myself. I was just kind of a weird fellow with music. I wanted to do my thing; I didn't want to do something I heard somebody else do.\n\nI mainly played chords and stuff like that and rhythm. I'm a rhythm fanatic. I played the guitar as if I were playing drums. That's the thing that makes my music so different. I do licks on the guitar that the drummer would do.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nBo Diddley brought his percussive sound to an audience of millions in November 1955 on the country's top-rated variety program, \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" as primetime television was gradually beginning to acknowledge the growing popularity of black music.\n\nHis rhythms would soon become rock-and-roll main stays, propelling hits by everybody from Buddy Holly and Johnny Otis in the late '50s, to punk and heavy metal bands of more recent decades."
