        "text": "Pioneering rhythm and blues guitarist and songwriter Bo Diddley died after having battled for months with problems with his heart, his agent told US media. He was 79.\n\nDiddley was hospitalized last year after a heart attack and later had a stent implanted to improve blood flow to his heart.\n\nHe had also suffered a series of seizures and had been recovering at his home in Archer, southern Florida, when he died, Rolling Stone magazine reported, citing a spokesperson.\n\nKnown as \"The Originator\" of rock and roll, Diddley is cited as a key transitional figure of blues into rock and a pioneer of the rock guitar style who influenced such other greats as Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nHis dark glasses and signature box-shaped guitars became icons in the music industry after he topped the rhythm and blues charts in 1955 with \"Bo Diddley.\"\n\nSome of his all-time hits include Who Do You Love, Before You Accuse Me, Mona and I'm a Man.\n\nHe was born December 30, 1928 in McComb, Mississippi. His name was Otha Ella Bates, which he later changed to Ellas McDaniel Diddley.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nBlues=Truth\n\nTruth=Soul\n\nMy biz partner actually got to back up Bo in the late 80's/early 90's. Bo would tour without a band, and he'd just hire some local guys to play wherever he had the next gig lined up.\n\nAfter the show, Danny asked Bo to sign the back of his black strat. Lacking anything that would show up on the black paint, Danny handed Bo a screwdriver and said \"Scratch away\". Bo asked \"Are you serious?\". Danny said \"Sure\", and Bo signed his guitar with a screwdriver!! Danny still has that guitar and a picture of himself play it at that show. Priceless.\n\nI joined the band that played that gig several years later. That's a big regret for me that I didn't have the chance to play that show...\n\nHe leaves an awesome, awesome legacy that I hope is not forgotten. He'll not be remember for virtuosity, not for fame for fame's sake... just for primal, guttural rhythm & blues & rock 'n roll. RIP."
