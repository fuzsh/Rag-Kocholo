        "text": "I admit I’m a latecomer to the Bo Diddley admiration society. Shame on me and on anybody else who has not given Diddley the proper credit for his musical legacy.\n\nI’ve been familiar with his name (one of my favorite names of all time) and some of his music, but only in the past five years or so have I gained an appreciation for his contributions to the creation of rock and roll.\n\nDiddley, who was born Ellas Bates and became Ellas McDaniel when he took the last name of a cousin who raised him, died from heart failure June 2 at the age of 79. This was a man who never really was given the acclaim owed him despite his contributions that were an inspiration to Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, and, yes, even Elvis Presley.\n\nWhile Elvis was still driving a truck in Tupelo, Miss., and starting his music career in 1955, Bo Diddley was rocking performance stages throughout the South with his trademark square, homemade guitar, and thumping, driving, high-energy riffs. He put the rock in rock and roll.\n\nThe so-called “bad boys” of the world today have nothing on Bo Diddley. Anybody familiar with “Who Do You Love” knows it. Diddley defined it in the first lines of this classic.\n\n“I walk 47 miles of barb wire/Use a cobra snake for necktie/Got a brand new house on the roadside, made from rattlesnake hide.”\n\nNo foul-mouthed, super macho rap artist or action movie character can touch those lines for being bad. Diddley defined it, but didn’t let it define him.\n\nBo Diddley influenced a great many rock-and-roll artists. Elvis, the Rolling Stones and countless others have used his trademark “shave-and-a-haircut-two-bits” riff to build a song around.\n\nUnfortunately, it took his death and a four-hour June 8 funeral/celebration for people to look at his work and see what a contribution Diddley made. The man spent his life playing the music for which he was far too often overlooked.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press report, stories of another side of Diddley were told repeatedly. A man who loved God and his family, who would always stop to talk in the grocery store and was always smiling.\n\nFriends recounted his generosity, manifested in concerts for the homeless and work with youth groups and other charities, and the way he loved to talk to just about anybody he met. His brother, the Rev. Kenneth Haynes of Biloxi, Miss., said Diddley always asked how he could help and what he could give.\n\n“There was one thing he wouldn’t give me. That’s his hat,” Haynes said, referring to the black hat the musician was recognized for as well.\n\nDiddley also was known for appearances in other people’s work, including movies and music videos. He was the pawn shop owner who bought Dan Ackroyd’s watch in “Trading Places”; he was the pool player in George Thorogood’s music video of “Bad to the Bone”; and Bob Seger immortalized him with his version of “Bo Diddley” on “Live Bullet.”\n\nAs for his stage name, according to his Web site, Bo Diddley may be a slang phrase meaning “nothing at all,” as in “he ain’t bo diddley.” It surely doesn’t describe his music.\n\nMusic fans — and especially rock-and-roll fans — should carve out a spot during their day sometime soon, put on a Bo Diddley recording, crank the volume, sit back and enjoy. Better yet, get up and move. I dare you to sit still.\n\nWho Do You Love? Bo Diddley, that’s who.\n\nDavid Frownfelder is a staff writer for The Daily Telegram.
