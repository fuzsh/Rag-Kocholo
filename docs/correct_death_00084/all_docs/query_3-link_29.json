In August 2007 he had a heart attack in Florida.\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Diddley composed a substantial body of rock classics, including \"Who Do You Love,\" \"Bo Diddley,\" \"Bo Diddley’s a Gunslinger,\" \"Before You Accuse Me,\" \"Mona,\" \"I’m a Man\" and \"Pretty Thing.\"\n\nHe cranked them out on a signature rectangular guitar, setting many of them to rumba-like rhythm of his \"Bo Diddley beat\" that gave rock ‘n’ roll a powerful rhythmic foundation.\n\nAlong with such contemporaries as Chuck Berry and Little Richard, he was among a pioneering group of black recording artists who crossed the American racial divide with music that appealed to white audiences and was emulated by white performers.\n\nAlthough Diddley recorded relatively few chart-topping hits, his seminal role in the formative years of rock music was recognized by his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and with a Grammy lifetime achievement award in 1998."
