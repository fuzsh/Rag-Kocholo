        "text": "Pioneering blues and rock'n'roll musician Bo Diddley has passed away due to heart failure. Diddley was born Ellas Bates McDaniel in McComb, Mississippi. He was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in January 1987 and proved influential particularly for his role in bridging the gap between blues and rock and roll.\n\nHis music had been covered by a diverse range of artists including Elvis Presley, The Doors, The Stooges, The Clash, Johnny Thunders, The Rolliing Stones and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Both the New York Dolls and The Lurkers recorded their own version of his song \"Pills\", and Diddley was the opening act on The Clash's first U.S. tour.\n\nOur deepest condolences go out to his family and friends."
