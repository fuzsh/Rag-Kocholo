        "text": "Bo called Archer home for many years. He had a great love for our youth and was devoted to establishing a means of helping to make their lives better. He created the Bo Diddley Foundation to help accomplish that goal. The City of Archer is grateful to him for his contribution.\n\nA member of the Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame, Florida Artists Hall of Fame, Recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm & Blues Foundation, and Grammy Award Winner, Bo Diddley was a pioneer in the truest sense of the word. Often imitated but never duplicated, Bo was known as \"The Originator\". He took the blues and infused it with his own distinctive rhythm to help lay the foundation of Rock 'n' Roll music. He has been credited by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Eric Clapton and countless other acts for his influence on their careers.\n\nBo passed away on June 2, 2008. On May 24, 2010 The City of Archer voted to proclaim December 30th as Bo Diddley Day in honor of his many accomplishments."
