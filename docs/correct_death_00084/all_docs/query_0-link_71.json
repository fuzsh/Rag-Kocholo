        "text": "Rock 'n' roll pioneer Bo Diddley, who banged out hit songs powered by the relentless \"Bo Diddley beat\" that influenced rockers from Buddy Holly to U2, died on Monday at the age of 79.\n\nDiddley died of heart failure at his home in Archer, Florida, his management agency, Talent Consultants International, said in a statement.\n\n\"One of the founding fathers of rock 'n' roll has left the building he helped construct,\" the statement said.\n\nDiddley suffered a stroke during a concert in Iowa in May 2007 and was hospitalised in Omaha, Nebraska. In August 2007 he had a heart attack in Florida.\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Diddley composed a substantial body of rock classics, including Who Do You Love, Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley's a Gunslinger, Before You Accuse Me, I'm a Man, Pretty Thing and Mona.\n\nHe cranked them out on a signature rectangular guitar, setting many of them to rumba-like rhythm of his Bo Diddley beat that gave rock 'n' roll a powerful rhythmic foundation.\n\nAlong with such contemporaries as Chuck Berry and Little Richard, he was among a pioneering group of black recording artists who crossed the American racial divide with music that appealed to white audiences and was emulated by white performers.\n\nAlthough Diddley recorded relatively few chart-topping hits, his seminal role in the formative years of rock music was recognised by his induction into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and with a Grammy lifetime achievement award in 1998.\n\nBorn Ellas Bates in 1928 in McComb, Mississippi, he took the last name McDaniel from his adoptive mother, and played classical violin as a boy.\n\nHe was given the nickname Bo Diddley as a teenager after moving to Chicago, where he started playing music on street corners in the 1940s.\n\nInspired by blues musician John Lee Hooker's classic, Boogie Chillen, Diddley used his violin skills to craft a guitar sound that laid the basis for the funk music of the 1960s.\n\nHe found fame in the mid-1950s with his signature song, Bo Diddley. Even among the first wave of rock music, the song stood out with its tremolo guitar, maracas and trademark beat.\n\nDiddley's unique guitar playing and rhythm influenced generations of rockers from Elvis Presley to Bon Jovi. Keith Richards and Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones and Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi made guest appearances on his records and Diddley played with the likes of The Clash and The Grateful Dead.\n\nReuters"
