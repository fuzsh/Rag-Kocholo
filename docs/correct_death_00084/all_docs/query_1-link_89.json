        "text": "His daughter Sondi Johnson announced the death, saying no specific cause had been determined. Mr. Johnson lived at the New York State Veterans Home in St. Albans, Queens.\n\nBlack reporters and editors were rarities in newsrooms of large American newspapers in the years in which Mr. Johnson’s career gained prominence. From the civil rights protests and urban unrest of the 1960s through the rise of the black power movement and beyond, Mr. Johnson often found himself as both a reporter and an interpreter of racial conflict and change.\n\nMr. Johnson was a founding member of Black Perspective, an early organization of black reporters in New York, and a founder of Black Enterprise magazine.\n\nArthur Gelb, a former managing editor for The New York Times, wrote in his memoir, “City Room” (2003), that when Mr. Johnson joined the paper in February 1966, he was the only black reporter at The Times.\n\nThe next month, Mr. Johnson covered racial unrest and violence in the Watts section of Los Angeles, seven months after the riots there, notably beginning one article with a dramatic quotation from the owner of a shoeshine parlor: “These kids hate white people — they hate them very strongly.”\n\nMr. Johnson won several awards for his coverage of black servicemen in Vietnam and Europe. He found that many black soldiers resented being sent into danger when civil rights demonstrators were being harassed at home.\n\nMr. Johnson also covered many events having nothing to do with race. Mr. Gelb credited him with “stiffening our resolve” to plunge into an investigation of corruption at the Human Resources Administration in 1968.\n\nWhile working at The Times, Mr. Johnson was based in Lagos, Nigeria, from 1972 to 1975, and earlier held temporary postings in Vietnam, Europe and the Caribbean.\n\nIn an autobiography distributed by the Maynard Institute, Mr. Johnson quoted William McIlwain, then a top editor of Newsday, as telling him that the paper had never had a black reporter and that he needed one to cover civil rights.\n\nMr. Johnson was an assistant to the metropolitan editor in 1977 and 1978, but asked to return to reporting. He resigned from The Times in 1982 and later ran his own public relations firm.\n\nIn addition to his daughter Sondi, of Poughkeepsie, Mr. Johnson is survived by his wife, the former Josephine Holley; a son, Thomas Jr.; another daughter, Jo Holley Johnson; and three grandchildren. Another son, Craig, died before him.\n\n______________________________________________________________________"
