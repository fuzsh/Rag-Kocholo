        "text": "Thank you for subscribing to the Liquid Blues' news and promotions email.\n\nYou can opt out at any time by replying to this email with the\n\nwords \"opt out\", \"cancel\", or \"remove\".\n\nShizam – Holy Cow – Whoope – Yippy Kay Yay – Huba Huba – Yowza and Shazbot – It’s almost here!\n\nThis Saturday, May 15th, SPRING JAM!!!\n\n10 Bands 2 Stages – Need we say more?\n\nStarts at 6:00 – No admission.\n\nFood and Drink Specials!\n\nDon’t Miss It!\n\nThis Sunday Come to the Square for FAIR DIDDLEY -\n\n– Then come to Liquid Blues for --- BO DIDDLEY Day… or you ain’t worth diddley.\n\nBo Diddley (December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008) is the stage name for Ellas Otha Bates, an American rock and roll vocalist, guitarist, songwriter, and inventor. He was known as \"The Originator\" because of his key role in the transition from the blues to rock & roll, influencing a host of legendary acts including Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, and Eric Clapton. He introduced more insistent, driving rhythms and a hard-edged guitar sound on a wide-ranging catalog of songs. Accordingly, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and a Grammy Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. He was known in particular for his technical innovations, including his trademark rectangular guitar.\n\nHis songs (for example, \"Hey Bo Diddley\" and \"Who Do You Love?\") often have no chord changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic tension and release.\n\nIn the days following the death of Bo Diddley, tributes were paid to him by George W. Bush, the United States House of Representatives, and an uncounted number of musicians and performers, including Eric Burdon, Elvis Costello, Ronnie Hawkins, Mick Jagger, B. B. King, Tom Petty, Robert Plant, Bonnie Raitt, George Thorogood. Robert Randolph and the Family Band and Ronnie Wood. He was posthumously awarded a Doctor of Fine Arts degree by the University of Florida for his influence on American popular music and in its \"People in America\" radio series about influential people in American history, the Voice of America radio service paid tribute to him, describing how \"his influence was so widespread that it is hard to imagine what rock and roll would have sounded like without him.\" Mick Jagger stated that \"he was a wonderful, original musician who was an enormous force in music and was a big influence on The Rolling Stones. He was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him.\" Jagger also praised the late star as a one of a kind musician, adding, \"We will never see his like again. As his bass player Debby Hastings said: he was the rock that the roll was built on.\"\n\nMaxwell Street was the home of Bo Diddley, Junior Wells, Little Walter, Uncle Johnnie Williams, Big Bill Broonzy, Papa Charlie Jackson, Arthur Crudup, Hound Dog Taylor, One-Armed John Wrencher, One-legged Sam, Snooky Prior, Sonnyboy Williamson, Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf and countless blues legends who paved the way for supergroups like The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and Cream.\n\nA Maxwell Street Polish consists of a grilled or fried sausage topped with grilled onions and yellow mustard and optional sport peppers, on a bun. The sausage, a cross between Polish kielbasa and a natural-casing hot dog, is typically spicier than either and usually made from beef and pork. The meal traces its origins to Chicago's Maxwell Street market, and has been called \"[one of] the classic foods synonymous with Chicago\".\n\nThe Maxwell Street Polish soon grew to be one of Chicago's most celebrated and recognized native dishes, along with the Chicago hot-dog and Italian Beef..\n\nAn Italian beef is a sandwich of thin slices of seasoned roast beef, dripping with meat juices, on a dense, long Italian-style roll, believed to have originated in Chicago, where its history dates back at least to the 1930s.[1] The bread itself is often dipped (or double-dipped) into the juices the meat is cooked in, and the sandwich is typically topped off with Chicago-style giardiniera (called \"hot\") or sauteed, green Italian sweet peppers (called \"sweet\").\n\nCheck your email for a coupon for a free Chicago Maxwell Street POLISH or ITALIAN BEEF.\n\nALSO ON SUNDAY:\n\nTRIVIA QUESTION:\n\n\"Not Fade Away\" is a song credited to Buddy Holly (originally under his first and middle names, Charles Hardin) and Norman Petty (although Petty's co-writing credit is most likely a formality)and first recorded by Holly's band The Crickets in Clovis, New Mexico, on May 29, 1957. The song's rhythm pattern is one of the classic examples of the Bo Diddley beat, which itself was an update of the so-called \"hambone\" rhythm, or \"patted juba\" from Western Africa; Crickets drummer Jerry Allison pounded out the beat on a cardboard box. The only other person on the recording was rhythm guitarist Nikki Sullivan, who didn't play but simply chanted, along with Holly and Allison, the song's overdubbed background vocals.\n\nHere are 4 interesting bits of trivia concerning “Not Fade Away”.\n\n1.When the Rolling Stones gave the song the full-on Bo treatment (complete with shaking maracas), the result was their first big British hit - (#3) released on Feb. 21, 1964.\n\n2.It was the A side on the first Rolling Stones U.S. release.\n\n3.It’s been performed 530 times by the Grateful Dead (their 7th most performed song).\n\n4.Be the first to correctly tell the bartender the last interesting fact (the one I’m thinking of) and receive a FREE appetizer from \"FRIED OUT IN THE BASEMENT\" on our menu.\n\nDON’T FORGET!:\n\nEvery Wednesday OPEN JAM! And HIPPY CUSINE NIGHT featuring unique retro fare reminiscent of the 60's such as falafels, humus(the dippy part), pitas, and unusual (not your usual) salads.\n\nThis event will regularly occur every Wednesday night in conjunction with our blues, classic rock, bluegrass (and Sitar) Open Jam.\n\nPictures from last week’s open jam.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?:\n\nThe Obamas' dog, Bo, is also said to be named after Bo Diddley.\n\nFINALLY:"
