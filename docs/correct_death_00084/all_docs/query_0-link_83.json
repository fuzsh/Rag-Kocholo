        "text": "Bo Diddley, a founding father of rock ‘n’ roll whose distinctive “shave and a haircut, two bits” rhythm and innovative guitar effects inspired legions of other musicians, died Monday after months of ill health. He was 79.\n\nMr. Diddley died of heart failure at his home in Archer, Fla., near Gainesville, spokeswoman Susan Clary said. He had suffered a heart attack in August, three months after suffering a stroke while touring in Iowa. Doctors said the stroke affected his ability to speak, and he had returned to Florida to continue rehabilitation.\n\nThe legendary singer and performer, known for his homemade square guitar, dark glasses and black hat, was an inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, had a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, and received a lifetime achievement award in 1999 at the Grammy awards. In recent years he also played for the elder President Bush and President Clinton.\n\nMr. Diddley appreciated the honors he received, “but it didn’t put no figures in my checkbook. If you ain’t got no money, ain’t nobody calls you honey.”\n\nBorn Ellas Bates on Dec. 30, 1928, in McComb, Miss., Mr. Diddley was later adopted by his mother’s cousin and took the name Ellis McDaniel, which his wife called him.\n\nThe name game\n\nThe name Bo Diddley came from other youngsters when he was growing up in Chicago, he said in a 1999 interview. “I don’t know where the kids got it, but the kids in grammar school gave me that name,” he said, adding that he liked it so it became his stage name.\n\n(Other times, he gave somewhat differing stories on where he got the name. Some experts believe a possible source for the name is a one-string instrument used in traditional blues music called a diddley bow.)\n\nHis first single, “Bo Diddley,” introduced record buyers in 1955 to his signature rhythm: bomp ba-bomp bomp, bomp bomp, often summarized as “shave and a haircut, two bits.” The B side, “I’m a Man,” with its slightly humorous take on macho pride, also became a rock standard.\n\nThe company that issued his early songs was Chess-Checkers records, the storied Chicago-based labels that also recorded Chuck Berry and other stars.\n\nHoward Kramer, assistant curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, said in 2006 that Mr. Diddley’s Chess recordings “stand among the best singular recordings of the 20th century.”\n\nContinuing influence\n\nMr. Diddley’s influence was felt on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nBuddy Holly borrowed the bomp ba-bomp bomp, bomp bomp rhythm for his song “Not Fade Away.” The Rolling Stones’ bluesy remake of that Holly song gave them their first chart single in the United States, in 1964.\n\nMany other artists, including the Who, Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Costello copied aspects of Mr. Diddley’s style.\n\nMr. Diddley was also one of the pioneers of the electric guitar, adding reverb and tremelo effects. He even rigged some of his guitars himself.\n\nDespite his success, Mr. Diddley claimed he only received a small portion of the money he made during his career.\n\nLike other artists of his generation, he was paid a flat fee for his recordings and said he received no royalty payments on record sales. He also said he was never paid for many of his performances.\n\n“I am owed. I’ve never got paid,” he said. “A dude with a pencil is worse than a cat with a machine gun.”\n\nMr. Diddley won attention from a new generation in 1989 when he took part in the “Bo Knows” ad campaign for Nike, built around football and baseball star Bo Jackson.\n\nCommenting on Jackson’s guitar skills, Mr. Diddley turned to the camera and said, “He don’t know Diddley.”\n\n“I never could figure out what it had to do with shoes, but it worked,” Mr. Diddley said. “I got into a lot of new front rooms on the tube.”"
