        "text": "GAINESVILLE â€” In one his best-known songs from the 1950s, Bo Diddley once proclaimed himself \"I'm a Man.\" But at his funeral Saturday and at a musical celebration in his honor Saturday night, he was lionized as a friend, legend, benefactor and family member.\n\nDiddley, whose real name was Ellas Bates McDaniel, also was saluted earlier in the day with a parade and festival renamed after him, Yulee Diddley Day, in Archer, where he had lived for more than 20 years.\n\nAt Diddley's funeral, with hundreds in attendance, not only was Saturday declared \"Bo Diddley Day\" by Alachua County, the cities of Archer and Gainesville and other entities, but Gainesville Mayor Pegeen Hanharan unveiled plans to rename in Diddley's honor the Downtown Community Plaza, where Diddley had performed on numerous occasions, the last being in 2006.\n\n\"He is by far the most talented musician who had ever played the Downtown Plaza and he it did for nothing,\" Hanrahan said during the service.\n\nAt Diddley's funeral at the Showers of Blessings Harvest Center in Gainesville, proclamations, stories and songs flowed in a service that was part funeral, part celebration and part American music lesson, with emotions ranging from rousing to tear-inducing.\n\n\"This is the homecoming of a great man, a legend who touched many hearts around the globe,\" Karl Anderson, who served as the funeral's master of ceremonies, told the crowd.\n\nAs the building filled with family, friends and fans of the longtime Archer resident, the choir from his church, the Archer Church of God in Christ, began leading refrains of the famous Diddley song bearing his name, singing \"Hey, Bo Diddley!\" with the crowd answering back: \"Hey, Bo Diddley!\"\n\nOnce the service began, Anderson spared little time before mentioning \"the syncopated beat they named after him\" and defining Diddley's place in popular music.\n\n\"Whereas James Brown took it to the bridge, Bo Diddley took it all the way,\" Anderson said before introducing speakers, friends and dignitaries who ranged from Diddley's sole surviving sibling, his brother Kenneth Haynes, to Alachua County Commissioner Rodney Long, Gainesville Mayor Hanrahan and Archer Mayor Laurie Costello, among many others.\n\n\"His syncopated rhythm has been used by countless musicians since he created it in the 1950s,\" Long said. \"So to the family, we thank you for sharing this man with the entire world,\" Long said to Diddley's family members sitting in the front rows. Among them were Diddley's four children, 15 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.\n\nDiddley's presence and legacy as a literal co-creator of rock 'n' roll was so strong and palpable during the service that, as Anderson told the crowd, no one dared play the guitar in the band assembled at the pulpit.\n\n\"There's drums, bass, synthesizers, organ and piano but no lead and rhythm guitar, because no one wants to come in here and compete with Bo,\" he said.\n\nMountains of flowers around his casket were so vast that their peaks of red, green, white and yellow nearly obscured the view of Diddley's casket. Among the arrangements were one from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers of orange roses, lillies and feathers, and others from guitarist Jimmie Vaughan, singer-guitarist George Thorogood, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and not one - but two - life-sized flower arrangements of Diddley's box-shaped guitar in red roses and carnations."
