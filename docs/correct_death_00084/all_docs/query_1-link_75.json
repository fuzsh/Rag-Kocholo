        "text": "Sad note.\n\nWanted to comment on cause of his death -- complications from diabetes.\n\nFolks, diabetes is becoming, if not already is, an epidemic in this country.\n\nMuch of it preventable because it is caused, in large part, by our\n\ninsanely gross overconsumption of sugar and corn syrup in our diets --\n\nand of other \"simple\" carbs that convert way too easily into glucose and\n\nraise our blood sugar to levels the human body is not designed to absorb.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who was recently informed by his doctor that\n\nmy blood sugar levels had been spiking to near-diabetic (pre-diabetic)\n\nlevels -- said to be from eating too much of the wrong stuff and\n\ncompounded by not getting enough exercise. Scared the crap out of me,\n\nand hopefully spurring me to make changes!!\n\nI'm not posting the above with specific regard to the late Mr. Hill or\n\nhis condition. But just as a healthy reminder to us all.\n\nFrankly, folks, if we the American public do not start taking better\n\ncare of ourselves in terms of eating and exercise and other lifestyle\n\nchoices, then frankly our society is going to be bankrupted by health\n\ncare costs, no matter who is paying for it (i.e., whether individuals,\n\ninsurance companies, employers, or Uncle Sam pays!). Serious. This\n\nstuff REALLY gives me the blues when I think about it!!\n\n--Steve Hoffman\n\n\n\nMyself and about a hundred others (maybe 200 others) were fortunete\n\nenough to see Bo Diddley Jr. in Columbus just over 5 years ago. It\n\nwas a marketing stroke of genius by our own Sean Carney (but we expect\n\nno less from Sean). What I recall most from that night was that there\n\nwere a bunch of women in the club (Blues Station in DT C-bus) for\n\nsomeone's birthday party and Bo Diddley Jr. was playing to them,\n\nsaying into his mic numerous times, \"It's my birthday too\" (lol). I\n\nbelieve a handful of us CBA (East) officers hung out with Bo at one of\n\nour officers homes after the gig till almost sunrise listening to Bo\n\ntell us stories.\n\nAs for diabetes, I know its bad. I have to keep it in the back of my\n\nmind with one uncle already passed away, earlier this decade, due to\n\nnon-treatment of it, and my father on treatment for diabetes (and one\n\nyounger brother scared enough that he changed his diet due to the\n\npotential of having this disease).\n\nIn Louisiana, we call it \"The Sugar.\" I know I've spoken to several\n\nof you fellow Blues-Lers about the health of one musician in Opolupus\n\nwho has already had both legs amputated in the last 18 months due to\n\ndiabettes. Our bass player for the houseband @ Teddy's Juke Joint is\n\nsupposed to be on a diet for his diabettes and laments about his feet\n\nbothering him if he has to stand too long (be it @ Teddy's w/Selwyn\n\nCooper or on the road w/Rockin' Dopsie Jr).\n\nI've been told (but unable to substantiate) that many of the musicians\n\nin Acadiana have some form of diabetes. At least once a week I\n\nsee/hear a story about the \"health crisis\" here in Louisiana. Most of\n\nwhich I would say has been brought upon ourselves due to ingrained\n\n(family) traditions and lack of trust of outsiders (re: experts).\n\nYou want to help one another, but you can't wait till its too late.\n\nSandor\n\nOn Thu, Oct 29, 2009 at 12:57 AM, Steve Hoffman\n\n<steveh...@starpower.net> wrote:\n\n> Sad note.\n\n>\n\n> Wanted to comment on cause of his death -- complications from diabetes.\n\n>\n\n> Folks, diabetes is becoming, if not already is, an epidemic in this country.\n\n>\n\n> Much of it preventable because it is caused, in large part, by our insanely\n\n> gross overconsumption of sugar and corn syrup in our diets -- and of other\n\n> \"simple\" carbs that convert way too easily into glucose and raise our blood\n\n> sugar to levels the human body is not designed to absorb.\n\n>\n\n> And I say this as someone who was recently informed by his doctor that my\n\n> blood sugar levels had been spiking to near-diabetic (pre-diabetic) levels\n\n> -- said to be from eating too much of the wrong stuff and compounded by not\n\n> getting enough exercise. ï¿½Scared the crap out of me, and hopefully spurring\n\n> me to make changes!!\n\n>\n\n> I'm not posting the above with specific regard to the late Mr. Hill or his\n\n> condition. ï¿½But just as a healthy reminder to us all.\n\n>\n\n> Frankly, folks, if we the American public do not start taking better care of\n\n> ourselves in terms of eating and exercise and other lifestyle choices, then\n\n> frankly our society is going to be bankrupted by health care costs, no\n\n> matter who is paying for it (i.e., whether individuals, insurance companies,\n\n> employers, or Uncle Sam pays!). ï¿½Serious. ï¿½This stuff REALLY gives me the\n\n> blues when I think about it!!\n\n>\n\n> --Steve Hoffman\n\n>\n\n> George Willett wrote:\n\n>>\n\n>> We received word this morning that David Hill, better know as ï¿½Bo Diddly\n\n>> Jrï¿½\n\n>> passed away last night at Habana Healthcare in Tampa, FL. ï¿½He had his\n\n>> second\n\n>> leg amputated last week due to complications from diabetes. ï¿½Hereï¿½s a link\n\n>> to Bo jamming with Damon Fowler.\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\n>> http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=9168289\n\n>>\n\n>> George\n\n--\n\nSandor Gulyas\n\nM.A. Geography - Louisiana State Univ.
