        "text": "GAINESVILLE - Rock 'n' roll pioneer Bo Diddley, whose famous beat became a building block of rock 'n' roll and inspired generations from Bruce Springsteen to Tom Petty, died early Monday at his home near Archer.\n\nThe 79-year-old musician died of heart failure, said spokeswoman Susan Clary.\n\nBorn Ellas Otha Bates in McComb, Miss., he had suffered a stroke while on tour in Iowa in May 2007, and suffered a heart attack three months later.\n\nHe had been recovering at home near Archer in Alachua County, where he had lived for more than 20 years.\n\n\"He gave the world so much,\" said Scott Free, a guitarist and longtime family friend who performed with Diddley in the 1980s after he had begun dating the singer's daughter, Tammi McDaniel. \"He was really, really sweet - a really generous person almost to a fault.\"\n\nWith Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis, Diddley became one of the architects of rock 'n' roll in the mid-1950s.\n\nThe guitarist/singer/songwriter scored major pop hits with \"Bo Diddley\" and \"I'm a Man\" in 1955 on Chicago's Chess Records, and drew attention to rock 'n' roll's backbeat on a label primarily known for the blues.\n\nFrom there, his \"dunt da dunt da dunt, da dunt dunt\" beat became an integral and instantly identifiable part of rock 'n' roll's grammar.\n\nAnd his sound influenced artists in styles as diverse as rockabilly, punk, hip-hop, British invasion pop and others. \"It's not the number of notes you play, it's the notes you select,\" Free said about the beat.\n\nOver the years, Diddley variously claimed to have adapted the beat from music he heard in church, from trying to play the Gene Autry song \"Jingle Jangle,\" and from attempting to play his guitar like a drum.\n\nThe \"Bo Diddley beat\" could be heard in countless rock and hits, from Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\" and The Who's \"Magic Bus\" to Elvis Presley's \"His Latest Flame,\" Tom Petty's \"American Girl,\" George Michael's \"Faith\" and Bruce Springsteen's \"She's the One.\"\n\nDiddley's \"Who Do You Love\" was memorably covered by guitarist George Thorogood in 1978 and his music was featured on the soundtracks of such films as \"Boys Don't Cry,\" \"The Color of Money,\" \"Dirty Dancing\" and \"La Bamba,\" and in a series of Nike ads in 1989, in which Diddley appeared with football/baseball star Bo Jackson.\n\nBorn on Dec. 30, 1928, in McComb, Miss., Diddley was raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, and moved with her to Chicago at age 7. He later took her surname, becoming Ellas McDaniel.\n\nAccounts of the origin of his stage name, Bo Diddley, vary widely, but he had begun to use it by 1954, when he recorded \"I'm a Man\" and his namesake song at Chess Records' studios on the south side of Chicago.\n\nIssued as a single, \"Bo Diddley\" hit No. 1 on Billboard's R&B Singles chart in 1955, while its flipside, \"I'm a Man,\" was on the charts for 11 weeks.\n\nDiddley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. His last recording, \"A Man Amongst Men\" (Code Blue/Atlantic) received a Grammy nomination.\n\nHe had continued to perform into 2007, until he suffered a stroke in May 2007, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, followed by a heart attack in August.\n\nDiddley is survived by his children, Evelyn Kelly, Ellas A. McDaniel, Tammi D. McDaniel and Terri Lynn McDaniel, as well as 15 grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.\n\nPrivate and public services are planned for this weekend.\n\nStar-Banner reporter shares memories of Bo Diddley. 2A\n\nThe \"Bo Diddley beat\" could be heard in countless songs, from Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\" and The Who's \"Magic Bus\" to Elvis Presley's \"His Latest Flame,\" Tom Petty's \"American Girl,\" George Michael's \"Faith\" and Bruce Springsteen's \"She's the One.\""
