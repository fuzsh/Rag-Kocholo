        "text": "â€” A dude with a pencil is worse than a cat with a machine gun. - Bo Diddley\n\nBo Diddley, who died June 2 at age 79, understood that he was owed. Like a lot of the original generation of rock 'n' rollers, he received a flat fee for his recording sessions. He never got a penny in royalties for some of his songs. All the obituaries published last week mentioned Bo's complaint, the millions that were diverted from him by the stroke of a pen.\n\nMaybe you could look at it a different way, if you're determined not to be sentimental. You could point out he was a full-grown man - spell that M-A-N - when he signed away those rights, and that it happened before anybody knew there was real money in rock 'n' roll anyway."
