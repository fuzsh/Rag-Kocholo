        "text": "TONY EASTLEY: When he was young Bo Diddley could have been a violinist but the young man from Mississippi fell in love with the sound of electric guitars and for decades the instrument was synonymous with his particular brand of rhythm, blues and rock and roll.\n\nBo Diddley who was 79, died at his home in Florida overnight.\n\nThe legendary singer and songwriter transformed rhythm and blues to rock and roll in the 1950s with a new hard-edged guitar sound as well as a driving beat behind it.\n\nHis signature rhythm pattern inspired artists from Buddy Holly, to David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen to U2.\n\nEmily Bourke reports.\n\n(Sound of Bo Diddley playing guitar)\n\nEMILY BOURKE: The heavy guitar beat and driving rhythm thrust blues music into a new era and it made Bo Diddley one of the fathers of modern music.\n\nBorn Ellas Bates in Mississippi in 1928, he was adopted by this mother's cousin and moved to Chicago.\n\nHe took violin lessons as a young boy but was drawn to the guitar after seeing John Lee Hooker.\n\nAs a teenager he started crafting his own violins and guitars and it was then that he was nicknamed Bo Diddley after the one-stringed African guitar the Diddley Bow.\n\nHe started playing music on Chicago street corners in the 1940s but shot to fame in 1955 when he topped the R and B charts with hits including Bo Diddly, Who Do You Love, Before You Accuse Me, and Mona.\n\nHis band was different from many others.\n\nHe had a woman in it and unusual instruments like electric violin and maracas.\n\n(Sound of Bo Diddley playing)\n\nBO DIDDLEY: I mainly play chords and stuff like that in rhythm. I'm a rhythm fanatic. I play the guitar as if I were playing drums. That is the thing that makes my music so different.\n\nI do licks on the guitar that a drummer would do.\n\nEMILY BOURKE: While he inspired his contemporaries like Buddy Holly in the 1950s, he also influenced the 1960s British bands The Rolling Stones, the Who, and The Animals.\n\nIn the 1980s he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him 20th on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nUp until 2006 he was still performing, touring the world and inspiring the current crop of performers.\n\nLast year he suffered a stroke and a heart attack. Overnight he died of heart failure surrounded by more than 30 members of his family.\n\nHis grandson said the family sang a gospel song and he said 'wow' with a thumbs up.\n\nBo Diddley was 79.\n\n(Sound of Bo Diddley playing guitar)\n\nTONY EASTLEY: Emily Bourke reporting."
