        "text": "BRONSON — Rock 'n' roll legend Bo Diddley had often complained before he died of being “ripped off” by the musical revolution he helped found, having received no royalty payments for his biggest hits, only flat recording fees.\n\nNow, almost three years after Diddley's death, his family stands to begin receiving the payments long denied the rock icon — as the publishing rights to his earliest songs, which he signed away early in his career, return to his estate.\n\nBut in order to receive those royalty payments, his 22 heirs first will have to prevent the sale of those publishing rights.\n\nDiddley's attorney and two agents/managers are seeking to sell the publishing rights to his entire music catalog for $4.3 million to pay off possible tax debts for his estate, estimated to be worth about $6 million. For the total sum, the rights to each song would be sold as they revert back to the estate over the next several years.\n\nThe sale of publishing rights would mean Diddley's heirs — six children and 16 grandchildren — would be out about $400,000 a year in record royalties for the next four decades.\n\nIn a hearing in Levy County Circuit Court on Jan. 27, Judge Robert Roundtree Jr. postponed a decision on the sale until Diddley's attorney can provide an accounting of the total estate and the family can provide details of a possible leasing of the music rights instead of an outright sale. The next hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. on March 14.\n\nDiddley's heirs, particularly his oldest son, Ellas Anthony McDaniel, and Diddley's granddaughter Jatonne Mitchell, are fighting to keep ownership of the publishing rights of 311 songs, including his biggest hits, “I'm A Man,” “Who Do You Love” and “Love Is Strange.”\n\nThey allege that Diddley's attorney, Ron Stevens of Bronson, and Diddley's agents/managers, Faith Fusillo and Margo Lewis of New York City, took advantage of the singer, who had only an elementary school education. Diddley's will named Stevens the trustee of his estate, and Fusillo and Lewis received a percentage of royalties through a contract they had with Diddley.\n\nThe family, however, alleges the trio did not explain to Diddley that:\n\n* It would be Stevens — and not the family — who would have control over his estate, including his music.\n\n* His longtime managers would get 30 percent of anything of Diddley's that sold, including his image, public performance (radio and television play) rights and — if they remain with the estate — royalties from his publishing rights.\n\n* The family would divide the remaining 70 percent of royalties and fees among the 22 heirs.\n\n“His fiduciary obligation to my family has not been rendered,” McDaniel said about Stevens. “For my whole family, this has got to stop.”\n\nStevens, Lewis and Fusillo deny that Diddley did not understand that they would be in control; they say he wanted it that way, just as he kept his family out of his business dealings when he was alive.\n\nStevens, Fusillo and Lewis explained that they had tried to do what was best for Diddley, including filing lawsuits to recoup some of Diddley's financial losses as well as to protect his image. They say they now are trying to do what is best for the estate.\n\nStevens, Fusillo and Lewis said the family, most of whom live in rural Archer or Bronson, does not have a good grasp of the music industry, royalties, copyright laws or marketing. They told Judge Roundtree that in addition to covering tax bills, money from the sale would be used to help pay for a lawsuit to try to win back the rights to all of Diddley's music, in perpetuity. They said they had promised the singer they would do that after he had signed away those rights early in his career.\n\nIn e-mail exchanges with The Gainesville Sun, Stevens said he was limited as to what he could publicly discuss.\n\n“The rules of the Florida Bar to my best knowledge limit and/or preclude me from providing most of the answers and/or information you have requested,” Stevens wrote in response to questions about billing and how legal matters had been explained to Diddley. “Sadly this position can often be taken as having something to hide; I can only do my best to assure you that such is not the case. You probably have no way of knowing just how much I would love to fully address each question you have posed.”\n\nDiddley's family provided his will and other documents to The Sun. The will is filed in Levy County under his birth name, Ellas Otha Bates McDaniel.\n\nIn the will, Diddley made Ron Stevens trustee of an irrevocable trust and personal representative of his estate, which allows Stevens to “sell or convey any part of my estate.”\n\nThe will also specifies that Diddley's longtime managers, Fusillo and Lewis, will “continue to manage and perpetuate my entertainment business and affairs domestically and internationally in perpetuity according to acceptable industry standards they receive as compensation a total of 30 percent of all gross revenue collected by them.”\n\nThey said in court last month that their arrangement with Diddley for nearly 30 years when he was alive was also a flat 30 percent fee, which paid for three jobs: managing his career, booking his shows and taking care of his business matters.\n\nA well-known Nashville singer and songwriter said 5 to 15 percent for a manager alone is reasonable. Lewis and Fusillo also act as agent and business manager. An official from CMG Worldwide, which represents and manages the intellectual property of dead celebrities for their heirs, said 30 percent was a fair amount to charge.\n\nBut Judge Roundtree said “the reasonableness of the fees” seemed extreme, especially for the proposed deal.\n\n“I think somebody needs to sharpen their pencil and rework this,” Roundtree said. But Roundtree added that Fusillo and Lewis also were responsible for Diddley having any money at all at the end of his life.\n\nThe family now has hired Atlanta entertainment attorney Kendall Minter and his Fort Lauderdale colleague Frank Scruggs to represent them — and to contest the will.\n\n“The game plan is restore to the family their appropriate rights to the estate so that they have some input as to what's going on with the legacy that ... their grandfather and their father left them,” Minter said.\n\nEarning money from songs is a tangled web of people wanting a piece of the pie. There are several revenue streams for recording artists: recording royalties; publishing copyrights; writer's copyrights; public performance rights, which are paid to publishers and writers when songs are played on the radio or television or on stage; and mechanical royalties, which are paid to publishers by record companies when records are purchased. The publishing rights to his first two songs, “Bo Diddley” and “I'm A Man,” will return to his estate in March.\n\nRecords provided by the family show that in the first quarter of 2010, the Diddley estate received $41,209 in royalties on Diddley's work. Stevens declined to reveal what the latest quarter's royalties were. However, in a December 2009 letter to the family, he said that, “After 2011 Margo and Faith estimate an annual gross income of $400K yearly from royalties, in addition to other sources of income they are able to generate on your behalf.”\n\nThe estate fight is an echo of Diddley's early days in the music industry, when Muddy Waters and Diddley made their way from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago, bringing with them the slow, heart-wrenching music known as the blues, along with the fast-paced sounds of what became rock 'n' roll. Diddley, with his self-designed square guitar and slowed-down riffs on “shave and a haircut,” is given credit for being one of the founding fathers of rock 'n' roll, developing a rhythm now named for him.\n\nIn 1954 in Chicago, Diddley wound up recording for two Polish immigrants, brothers Leonard and Phil Chess, under their labels, Chess and Checker Records.\n\nDiddley had a huge hit in 1955 with “I'm A Man,” and the flip side of that 45, “Bo Diddley.” But the Chess brothers paid Diddley a flat, one-time fee for those two songs, the amount of which remains unknown.\n\nAccording to all involved, the story is the same for most of his other hits with Chess Records. Other well-known black artists with Chess also alleged the same problems. Diddley's main source of income was from touring and from his writer's copyrights.\n\nAfter Diddley began questioning the Chess brothers about royalties and more money, his music gradually stopped being played on the radio and Diddley has said in numerous interviews that he realized he had been blackballed by the industry.\n\nDiddley then signed a contract in 1971 to sell his writer's copyrights for $10,000 to the Chess family. The contract states that the sale was “forever.” That writer's catalog is what Fusillo and Lewis said they want to get back for the estate.\n\nDiddley continued to tour until the night he had a stroke in May 2007. “I guess because I was a little country black boy in Chicago, I got ripped off,” Diddley told an interviewer in 2003 about the Chess brothers.\n\nIn fact, Diddley was plagued by financial woes throughout his career, becoming the poster child for musicians who didn't realize they were signing away their rights to future royalties for pennies on the dollar. Diddley often trusted the wrong people, including his former manager, Marty Otelsberg, who helped himself to Diddley's bank account for decades. A judge in Los Angeles awarded Diddley more than $500,000 in 1994 from Otelsberg's estate.\n\nStevens filed a petition in January with the Levy County Court, hoping to get authorization to sell the publishing rights to Diddley's music catalog, which one appraiser estimated to be worth about $4.3 million.\n\nStevens explained in court documents that the need for the sale stems from two IRS issues:\n\nA “transaction” Diddley made in 2007 on his public performance rights for $1.54 million. At the time, Stevens said, he, Lewis and Fusillo believed the transaction was a loan, but the IRS has since declared it was a sale, on which Stevens says the estate will owe a substantial amount of taxes.\n\nTaxes the IRS says will be owed on the $4.3 million value of the publishing rights.\n\nRoundtree agreed that anything more than the $2 million cap of a non-taxable inheritance would be subject to a 55 percent tax rate. Stevens said there is simply not enough money in the estate account to pay the government.\n\nFusillo confirmed that Diddley sold some, not all, of his public performance rights in November 2007 for $1.54 million.\n\nBut Diddley's granddaughter and caretaker, Jatonne Mitchell, and the other heirs question how Diddley could have sold anything in November 2007 — six months after a stroke left him debilitated and with aphasia. He was unable to speak coherently or, Mitchell said, understand everything happening around him, let alone sign a legal document. Mitchell said her grandfather repeatedly began yelling, “What did I just do?” after Fusillo and Lewis left the house with the contract.\n\nFusillo said the sale was made in order to obtain cash for Diddley's health care following his stroke, as he had no supplemental health insurance and they didn't want to wipe out his savings. Fusillo had power of attorney to sign his name, but she said she did not want to be seen as taking advantage of that privilege. Instead, she said she and Lewis flew to Florida, and she met for an hour with Diddley, explained the situation and he signed the paperwork.\n\nFriends and family connected to Diddley say that selling his music rights is the last thing he would have wanted.\n\nThe family is working with attorney Kendall Minter of Atlanta to try to gain control over the estate.\n\nMinter, a native of New York City and a graduate of Cornell Law School, has represented numerous artists and the estates of artists. Minter said in a telephone interview that, when he saw Diddley's will, he was “shocked.”\n\n“Based on the fact that Bo, when he made the will, completely entrusted the care and well-being of his entire family for the rest of their lives to a couple of managers in New York and a sole practitioner attorney that he had done business with, without any real accountability,” Minter said. “And that's the unfortunate aspect for the family — they have very little, if no, say in the running of the estate. The estate was set up for their well-being.”\n\nDiddley's children and grandchildren are simply frustrated and angry.\n\n“We'll be lost forever if this goes through,” said Anthony McDaniel, Diddley's oldest son. “The fire sale of this would be a million-something for (Lewis and Fusillo), Mr. Stevens would get $400,000, and the family would get nothing after the taxes are paid.”\n\n10 R&B hits between 1958 and 1963. 1996 Album “A Man Amongst Men” nominated for a Grammy. 1987: Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 1998: Inducted into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame.
