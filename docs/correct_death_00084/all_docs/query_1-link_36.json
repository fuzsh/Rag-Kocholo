        "text": "Bo Diddley, the legendary rhythm 'n' blues pioneer who influenced artists from Buddy Holly to the Rolling Stones to U2, died last night aged 79.\n\nHis heart finally gave out after months of ill health at his home in Archer, Florida.\n\nThirty-five members of his family, including his wife of 15 years, Sylvia, were at his bedside when he said his last word \"Wow\" and gave a thumbs-up as the gospel song Walk Around Heaven played.\n\nAnd the loss felt after five decades of hits was summed up by his manager's tribute: \"One of the founding fathers of rock 'n' roll has left the building he helped construct.\"\n\nDiddley, who had had two strokes and a heart attack, was among a group of black artists like Chuck Berry and Little Richard who crossed the 1950s US racial divide with music that appealed to and was emulated by whites.\n\nBorn Ellas Bates in McComb, Missouri, his first single, Bo Diddley, topped the charts.\n\nBut the greatest mainstream success of a song with his distinctive beat was Holly's Not Fade Away - covered later by the Rolling Stones.\n\nLast night Mick Jagger said: \"Bo was a wonderful original who was an enormous force in music and a big influence on us. He was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him. We'll never see his like again.\"\n\nFour times wed and a father of five, Diddley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and awarded a lifetime Grammy in 1998.\n\nStill touring and recording until recently, he said: \"I was the first dude out there.\""
