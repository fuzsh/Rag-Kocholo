        "text": "GAINESVILLE Diddley died in June 2008. Officials honored him Friday by unveiling a mural and renaming the downtown space the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. Diddley lived in Archer, a few miles southwest of Gainesville, and played at the plaza in 2006.\n\nDiddley's grandson Garry Mitchell thanked the city at the ceremony, and he and other family members gave city officials one of Diddley's guitars.\n\n\"Gainesville's been really good to my granddad,\" Mitchell said. \"Thank you for your encouragement and your prayers. Long live Rock and Roll!\"\n\nDiddley's family plans to unveil his tombstone in Bronson, also southwest of Gainesville, at 10 a.m. Sunday.\n\n---\n\nInformation from: The Gainesville Sun, http://www.gainesvillesun.com"
