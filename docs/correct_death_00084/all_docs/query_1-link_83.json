        "text": "As I suspected would happen after Bo Diddley’s death, BBC Radio 2 has decided to replay its three-part Bo documentary from 2007. The first installment was broadcast last Friday, July 4, but you can still listen to it via the BBC’s Listen Again feature. Here’s the page for the show with the Listen Again link. Don’t wait too long—the BBC will probably remove the link to the first show when the second one airs this Friday (and the second will be replaced by the third on the following Friday).\n\nIt’s been about a year and a half since I heard this show, but I remember enjoying it greatly. Roger Daltrey is a surprisingly good as the host.\n\nIf you prefer listening on your iPod to listening at your computer, I suggest you look into Rogue Amoeba’s Audio Hijack Pro, which I use and am very happy with, or Ambrosia’s WireTap Studio, which is newer and has gotten good reviews. Both programs allow you to record streams at a time of your choosing, e.g., in the middle of the night when you’re not otherwise using your Mac. There are stream-recording applications for Windows and Linux, too, but I have no idea which ones are thought to be best.\n\nHere’s a groovy Bo clip from (I would guess) the late 60s/early 70s. Not as rocking as the clip from the Big TNT Show, but notable because it may be the only time you’ll see Bo with a natural."
