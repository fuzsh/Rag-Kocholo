Andersen. If you have read my review of the first book, The Devil’s Apprentice, you would be familiar with Philip.\n\nPhilip is a good boy, but he ends up in Hell by mistake. And on top of that, he is chosen to be the Devil’s Apprentice. Even though he’s always be good, he is not good at being bad. A danger occurs in Hell and the Devil is dying. When Philip solves the mystery, he returns on Earth to continue his normal life.\n\nBut when the future of the underworld is threatened once again, they need Philip’s help. Death’s Die has been stolen, the one that decides when each person is going to die. Because of that, immortality is now spreading. Philip goes back to hell to solve the mystery, but during his adventures he discovers some horrible truths…\n\nI really have no clue why it took me quite a long time to get to the second book, but I am so happy that I finally got to read it, and endeavour this story.\n\nIt is so unique and I am in love!\n\nThe chapters just flow through – even better than the first book – and within minutes you are captured in this world, full of good and evil, or decisions being made that question your moral time and time again, in a very understandable way for young adults as well.\n\nThe story of the Die of Death, and the scenes related to it were my favourite. I love what Kenneth created, and how Death rolls a dice at the beginning of each life, that determines how many years each person gets to live. I loved how everyone had their own hourglasses and the mysterious snake that guards them.\n\nWe get to see the Purgatory in this book too. Only for a moment, but it was wonderful to read about it. It reminded me so much of Dante’s inferno, and I loved it! There was also the theory of reincarnation, told by a dog – a scene that was quite powerful! We even got a glimpse of Heavan, a few mentions here and there, that made me want to know more.\n\nI like Philip as a character, but Satina was my hero! She has the best comment on everything, and they make such a good team with Philip. Also – did you know Hell has its own newspaper? It’s called Hell Times! So cool!\n\nI loved this book. I cherish it. And I can’t wait to see what happens next and I highly recommend it to you – especially this month, as it’s Spooky October already!\n\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nJanuary 5, 2020\n\nThanks to the author for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nThis series is such a unique book series. I remember writing the review for the first book and I was reminded a bit of Harry Potter, but then the dark version with demons and devils. I still feel that way, I also feel that the book is growing with Philip and the story gets a bit darker already. The book talks more about his personal life and his fear of losing loved ones.\n\nA longer review can be found at BiteIntoBooks\n\nA fun, fun series to read. Excellent writing, excellent world building. It all leaves no questions what so ever. The book has likable characters and adds new characters in this second book as well. I loved that the book took me on a trip exploring this other world even further and I can't wait what the third book has in store for me.\n\nMarch 28, 2020\n\nThis was originally published as part of a blog tour over at my blog, The Grimoire Reliquary.\n\nWhen I read The Devil’s Apprentice last year, I enjoyed it well enough, though I had a number of issues with some of the prose and saw the revelations coming from a mile away. How does its follow up compare? Read on to find out!\n\nThe Die of Death follows up six months after the conclusion of Apprentice. Philip has been marked by his time in Hell – no longer the angelic boy he used to be, our young protagonist has made some new friends. Prone to mischievous behaviour and white lies, Philip is having a grand old time.\n\nThat is, until he is struck by lightning and finds himself down the familiar steps to Hell. It’s not there that he’s destined to go, however – because Mortimer, cantankerous old personification of Death that he is, has work for Philip.*\n\nWhat The Devil’s Apprentice did well, this continues to do in the same vein. A return to Hell makes for plenty of fun, blood-curdling moments but the exploration of both the domain of Death and of Purgatory made for welcome additions to the tapestry of the underworld, or the afterlife, or wot-have-it. The characters remain true to themselves, and all the old, well-established characters make a comeback. They bring with them old friendships and adversarial relations, new revelations of forgotten crimes.\n\nPerhaps what I enjoyed more here than in the previous book of the series has to do with the twists and turns. In Apprentice none of the revelations towards the closing third of the novel surprised me. Die held a few surprises I did not see coming, along with the ones I inferred. It’s a slyer novel than the one before it – and that’s something I can appreciate.\n\nMortimer, especially – old Death himself started off as someone I disliked and his standing with me only grew worse. Andersen, bless his talented writerly heart, turned it around!\n\nPhilip is more interesting by far in this one. The story flows better, the dialogue and prose are stronger. You will be surprised. This one does plenty right, and I’m happy to recommend it to people who enjoyed the previous one and to those who, like me, were on the fence at the prospect of reading the follow-up to the previous one.\n\nMy score for The Die of Death is a 4 out of 5 stars. It’s a fun second chapter, and I enjoyed it, and that’s all that matters.\n\n*Writing a variation of my name this many times makes me a touch more megalomaniacal than usual.\n\nI’m not sure I’ll pick the next one up anytime soon – there’s another blog tour a little while from now, but I’ll admit to some reluctance on my part about participating. A case of oversaturation, perhaps.\n\nFebruary 28, 2020\n\nI’ll try to write this review without just gushing and saying “read it”… But, you need to read this series! I honestly feel like it could be the next Harry Potter!!….Dark Harry Potter?? Ok, honestly I hate comparing it like this, because I like this so much better! I know… Sacrilege. You’d get what I mean if you read it.. And, have a bit of a dark side.\n\nThe life lessons in this novel, and I do mean that literally. There are so many questions: “Is Death pre-determined?” “What is a Fate worse than Death?”, “What would you give up for someone you Love?”…. Better question “Who do you Love?” (I hope you’re all hearing the Bo Diddley song from the La Bamba Soundtrack. Because, I know I am.\n\nI loved that this series has been so cohesive, insightful, and full of really smart mythology. The best fiction is based in truth, and I really feel that Kenneth B Andersen realizes that. You can really tell he’s put a lot of thought into the areas of Hell, who would be in them, and how they would best suffer….Ok. I just realized how that may sound. But, It’s a wonderful mystery that really gets you thinking and feeling.\n\nI think that anyone would love this book and this series. But, I’ll focus on any fans of (dare I say) Harry Potter, and any fans of Piers Anthony’s “Incarnations of Immortality”\n\nJanuary 27, 2020\n\nFirst off, don’t let the title of this book fool you. Although Death is indeed a physical, human-like being in the story, it isn’t actually about him dying like you might at first assume by the title. Death, the creepy old man that he is, rolls dice with another HUGE player in the game of life and afterlife, to determine the life-span of humans. I know, crafty, right?! I thought that aspect was pretty cool myself!\n\nThe character of Death was introduced in Book 1 of the series, of course, and continues to maintain a huge ‘roll’ in the Great Devil War tale as a whole… as he should be!\n\nIn The Die of Death, his die has been stolen!! *gasp* Who would do such a thing?! Thus is the mystery of this installment of the series. Phillip is the young boy who was meant to be the Devil’s accessor in book one -by mistake, mind you- but who solved the conundrum of the Devil knocking on Death’s door rather than assuming his role in the underworld. In book two, Phillip has been brought back to hell in order to help Death out in solving this new mystery. He makes a deal with Death, that he will do his best in finding the culprit and returning his die for an exchange of ONE roll. Phillip wants very badly to extend the life of his dying mother on earth. She’s very sick and is running out of time.\n\nWhile he’s in Hell, for the second go around, many things have changed, yet many things remain the same. Hell is still it’s devastating self, full of monsters, evil doers, the torturing of the condemned all around, AND bonding friendships oddly enough. Satina, the tempter/mini-devil who’s also Phillip’s bestie/crush, was waiting for Phillip at the gate. She brings Phillip to Death’s house, where the two are introduced to his basement.\n\nThis dark and creepy place holds the hour glasses of time for each and every human, the sand within reveals their most important memories, along with the way they die. Yet, because of the missing Dice all humans born during its absence are stuck in a strange state of immortality. They can’t die, if Death cannot play his part in their predetermined game of life-span dice rolling. These humans have an hourglass that is tipped on its side. Once Phillip makes his agreement with Death, he begins the grueling task of searching for clues. What he and Satina uncover, one step at a time is shocking!\n\nI really enjoyed every single page of this book. It’s written very well, and it reads in a fun lighthearted way. At one point, Phillip even goes to devil school with Satina, where all the little devils are itching to tourture him in one way or another. He isn’t like them, he’s more of an angel, so naturally they’re at odds. They get the admiration of him out the way quick, because he did save them from the worst young devil of all in the first book. After that, the trickery and evil doings begin. That’s kind of a fun journey inside of Phillip’s bigger mission.\n\nAt another point in the book, Phillip is tricked by another condemned soul that had escaped years before, yet comes back to try and luer Phillip out of hell. He makes Phillip believe that he’s his father and he’s come to take him to Heaven where he belongs. Who this soul actually is, is a shocker too!\n\nBy breaking back into Hell, and trying to get Phillip away from solving the mystery he actually winds up giving Phillip and Satina just the clue they’ve been looking for! Hands down five stars AGAIN. Kudo’s Kenneth, you’ve created quite the world, here in Hell. As well as all the places beyond Hell for that matter! I’m looking forward to reading the rest of the series!\n\nApril 8, 2020\n\nThe Die Of Death, by Kenneth B Andersen is a fantastic and fun sequel to The Devil’s Apprentice! This book is full of brilliant world-building, interesting characters and fun twists that keep you thoroughly entertained.\n\nSynopsis: Philip’s days in Hell have changed him for the better, he now has friends to spend his time with and no longer follows every single rule applied to him. But, Philip misses his friends in Hell, though he may see them sooner than he thinks. When Death discovers an important item of his has been stolen he realises the future of the underworld is in danger, and Death needs Philip’s help to set things right again. As Philip helps to save the underworld again, he also comes across a shocking truth about his own life. Can Philip save the future of the underworld again? And can he cope with the newly revealed truths of his own life?\n\nThis review may contain spoilers for the first book in the series, review here: The Devil’s Apprentice.\n\n— Light, Comical, Direct But Balanced and Metaphorical —\n\nThe Writing Style/Narrative. Unsurprisingly, Andersen manages to maintain his light, comical, direct but balanced and metaphorical writing style flawlessly in this fascinating sequel. The language is relatively simple and direct meaning you can fly through the story, but he effectively uses complex and vivid metaphors to draw attention to key details and to create a strong image of the world he has created – the balance is perfect and makes the book suitable for all age ranges.\n\nMoreover, Andersen’s writing style is incredibly engaging, he masterfully creates pathos for characters and situations and easily makes you feel connected to the world and characters he has crafted, from the moment you open the book you are hooked and that attention never wavers. He cleverly weaves together comedy, danger and suspense creating strong atmospheres that draw you in and have effective pay-offs which keep you intrigued, shocked and satisfied throughout the whole story.\n\nAgain the story is told from the third person perspective of Philip – and again it is still a very effective choice. Philip is still a child, but has developed a lot since the first book – he is still a good child but is more flexible and has friends now. This means that his perspective is even more intrguing than before because now he is more inclined to do ‘bad’ things, so he is a little bit more unpredictable. Despite being a young child, you can easily connect with his perspective in this book because the events he has to deal with are ones relevant to us all.\n\nThe perspective gives us a lot of insight into Philip, his thoughts, emotions and motivations but also keeps us blind to the other characters motives. This allows a sense of mystery and suspense to be created and the tension works very well alongside the story because it keeps you interested. Much like with the first book, I really enjoyed this perspective, even more so now with Philip being more developed, and thought it worked wonderfully.\n\n— Brilliantly Unique Story And Was Incredibly Fun —\n\nThe Story/Plot. Andersen is a fantastic story teller. This series has a fresh perspective on Hell/the underworld and has a unique storyline that never fails to entertain. We follow Philip as he is returned to Hell in order to help Death recover a stolen item that, if not returned, can cause a lot of trouble for Hell and its future.\n\nThis was a brilliantly unique story and was incredibly fun to read. The story is well paced from start to finish with well timed action filled scenes that are mixed in with fun, comical scenes as well as more serious ones. This worked incredibly well and was very effective, I loved this sequel as it added a great dynamic and extra elements to the world we already know. Andersen crafted a very intriguing story and a very well developed underworld and this book develops it even further – we learn a lot more about how Death and his Die works, about Life, and even about what is outside of Hell.\n\nMoreover, the villain(s) of the story are fascinating, the way they influence the story and create tension and conflict is very cleverly done, it is subtle but effective and slowly builds to create a fantastic climax. This perfectly sets up for the next book in the series and makes you want to read more immediately.\n\nI really enjoyed the concept of this story and the focus on Death, it gave us a new perspective and insight into the character of Death but also the world Death lives in. This allowed a lot of themes to be explored, most importantly life and death and the effects of immortality. It is done in a very gentle but powerful way that younger readers can easily understand and older readers can relate to and analyse.\n\nI also loved the Earth aspect of the story and seeing how Philip’s life has changed now that he has grown. His new friendships on Earth and ability to actually relate to other children was a wonderful development that I hope continues through the rest of the series. Watching Philip’s life change, seeing him be much happier and actually enjoying his childhood with multiple friends was very interesting, even if he did miss his friends in Hell.\n\nI can’t say too much more about the story as it is easy to spoil, but I really enjoyed the direction Andersen took. I cannot wait to see where Andersen takes us in the next book, I look forward to seeing the world develop more as the series goes on and am excited to see how the characters grow.\n\nThe Characters. I loved the characters in this story, I loved them in book 1 and now I love them even more. Each of the characters we know have been incredibly well developed, they have grown and become more multi-dimensional.\n\nPhilip. Philip has grown a lot over the course of this story, he has become more social, more lenient, happier and more unpredictable. Philip is still a very kind child, a ‘good’ child who will not do ‘bad’ things for the sake of doing so but is a little more selfish and more likely to stand up for himself. I like how Philip has developed and find his character to be surprisingly easy to relate to and connect with. Philip’s slight unpredictability adds a lot to the story and makes him more realistic, he is more emotional but still determined to be helpful and that makes him a great character overall.\n\nPhilip’s relationship with Satina also develops naturally and realistically. They make a great pair as they have very different personalities but are also incredibly compatible, they balance each other out and encourage each other to be better. It is an excellent dynamic that works perfectly.\n\nSatina. I love Satina, she has also changed a lot as well, her character has developed wonderfully. Satina is a devil, specifically a trickster, and is great at encouraging people to carry out misdeeds but she is also surprisingly sweet and kind aswell. Satina is very clever, determined and headstrong, but can also be very emotional, shy and awkward. Her character is very strong and and interesting and is a brilliant contrast to Philip, but they also have some similarities and so make an incredible team.\n\nLucifer. So Lucifer is not as prominent in this book as he is in the first but we see a significant change in him now that he is restored to full health. Lucifer is stronger, more powerful, and more confident. Lucifer is great, his character is still brilliant and how he has bonded with Philip is one of the best things in the story. He is absolutely thrilled to have Philip back and treats hime like a son, they have a fantastic relationship and I cannot wait to see how it develops later on in the series.\n\nDeath. Death has a smaller but significant role in the first book and we get to see a lot more of him in this one and it was excellent. Death’s character is fascinating, he has distinctive views, is very direct and incredibly domineering and yet is reasonable and surprisingly kind. I loved the insight we get into Death’s character in this book, it really expands the world we are reading about. I hope to see more of him as the series goes on because I love the depth he added.\n\nOverall. This was a fantastic story, and a brilliant sequel, it was fun, entertaining and full of twists and turns to keep you intrigued. The characters were well developed, their relationships developed naturally and their lives and insight added a lot of depth to the world.\n\nI will definitely be continuing with this series because I am so excited to see how the world and characters develop as it goes on. This is a series that I would definitely recommend to all fantasy lovers who want a fun but multi-dimensional story filled with dynamic relationships and in-depth characters.\n\n*I received a kindle copy of this book from @The_WriteReads in order to participate in a #blogtour*\n\nJuly 6, 2019\n\nI’ve said it before but I’ll say it again, I am loving these books! If you’ve read my review of The Devil’s Apprentice, you’ll know just how impressed I was with the characters and world building in the story. It’s so unique and fun! Yes fun! Sure, it’s a little dark but it such a great reading experience!\n\nBook #2 in the series is no different! Philip “dies” again but this time he is summoned back to Hell for Death himself! After saving the “Great Devil”, Death is convinced Philip is the only one who can help him find his die and save the entire Underworld.\n\nAll of our favourite and not so favourite characters are back, and there are even a few new additions too! Philip happily reunites with Satina, and the rest of his friends whom he has been missing topside.\n\nTogether, they go on an incredible journey through the Underworld, meeting friend and foe, and uncover a darker conspiracy then they originally thought, even for Hell.\n\nGuys, these books are so fun! And like a good book series, both characters, and plot are developing nicely. I can’t wait to read what happens next!\n\nJanuary 27, 2020\n\nOriginal Review at Jaunts & Haunts\n\n3.5/5\n\nI gave this book three and a half die-rolling stars.\n\nIt pained me to give this book this rating to be honest. Reading the first book, I fell in love with the creepy world of Hell that we were introduced to and the main character Phillip.\n\nHowever, this time around, there were some things I couldn’t ignore that bugged me. Don’t get me wrong, there was plenty of great stuff in this book, I just felt it paled in comparison to the first one.\n\nSo in a nutshell, Phillip has moved on with his human life on Earth. He’s no longer the goody two shoes that he once was, and in return he’s beginning to make friends at school and actually enjoy life.\n\nBut when he’s out with his new friends being mischievous, events occur that make him think that something is after him, and it wants him dead. Soon, Phillip finds himself in Hell once more, only this time the stakes are higher.\n\nSomeone has stolen Death’s die that gives mortals their lifespan, and unless Phillip can find it, all humans born will be immortal. Can Phillip find the culprit of this evil deed before his world is irreversibly changed?\n\nThis book had a lot of pros going for it.\n\nFor starters, Phillip as a character was much more interesting this time around. Instead of being the innocent do-gooder, he’s become his own person with his own flaws. I think he was better fleshed out as a character this time around.\n\nThe concept was, again, really great. Immortals walking the Earth? Yeah, that can’t be. I was invested in this story very quickly and wanted to see how things turned out. Hell was fleshed out even more than the last time, and I enjoyed that as well, especially from Death’s part of that universe.\n\nThe writing style didn’t really change and was primarily easy to read, and that’s probably my favorite thing about YA novels. The pages turn fast.\n\nHowever, there were some things that I didn’t enjoy this time around.\n\nIn the first book, though the novel revolved around Phillip, it remained plot-driven in my eyes. This time around, it felt more character-driven. It’s just personal preference, but I prefer the plot to be the main driver in a novel.\n\nConnecting with my previous point, the plot felt disjointed in certain areas. Things start out really well, but after that, things fall off for a while for me. The characters begin looking for the die, but about a third in something happens and it feels like they simply stopped looking for it. Eventually things did get back on track, but the entire time I kept asking myself why they stopped looking for the die. I mean, that’s why he’s there.\n\nThere were small bits where I got a tad confused or the conversation had a little too much back and forth, like when Satina and Phillip are navigating the stairs to Hell. They have this dialogue where they are theorizing what happened, but it goes a bit too far and overreaches to where I just had to skim over it.\n\nIt definitely wasn’t a dealbreaker, but I’ll admit it was an annoyance.\n\nAll this being said, I enjoyed my time reading The Die of Death. It was vivid, entertaining, and I am hoping that I enjoy the next book a bit more than this one. That ending really hooked me!\n\nNovember 30, 2018\n\nWhen I reviewed the first book in this series for Rosie’s Book Review Team, the author was kind enough to send me the second. There are, at least for the moment, four more to come (you can check them in the author’s website), and I, for starters, I’m looking forward to them.\n\nThe second book in the series picks up where the first one left, a few months after the protagonist, Philip visited Hell, and we see what has happened to him when he went back to life. Things are looking up for him. He has made some new friends, and he has become more popular. But then, strange things start to happen, he cheats death a few times, but eventually…\n\nThis time he is brought back to the Underworld (well, Underworlds), by Death himself, because Lucifer and Mortimer (Death) think he is the boy for the job. This time, the job involves retrieving the die of death (as you might have surmised from the title) that has been stolen. With Satina’s help (his girl-demon-friend) he starts investigating, and the search gets more desperate when the stakes become much higher and more personal.\n\nI really enjoyed this book. Although there are reminders of what had happened in the first book in the series, and I guess regular readers of the genre might be able to pick up the clues quickly enough and follow the story, I would advise reading the books in the right order. There is much background covered in the first book that is relevant to the second book’s adventures, one gets a much better sense of how the different characters have evolved, and there are beautiful details and insights that would be lost if this book was read on its own.\n\nFor those of us who enjoyed the first book, this novel allows us to meet some of our favourite characters again (and some, perhaps, not as favourite), we discover some wonderfully creepy new locations and characters (death’s horse and his home are chilling, but I was particularly taken by the Purgatory), there are new dark jokes, and we get to know the fate of some interesting historical figures, like Hitler, Epicurus, and even Elvis!, and there are plenty of adventures. There are red-herrings and betrayals as would pertain a book about Hell, but I was gripped by some of the themes touched upon, like immortality (and, of course, mortality), fate, sin and guilt, getting old. If you’ve always wondered what it would be like to be immortal, this book will give you pause. (Yes, in most stories, the immortal are eternally young, but what would happen if they grew old?)\n\nAlthough the book starts slowly, because trying to find clues about the whereabouts of the die proves hard and frustrating, the adventures soon pick up, and there are rich details all throughout the story that we need to pay attention to if we don’t want to miss anything. The rhythm increases quickly, and once Philip returns to Hell, we know we are in for a wild ride.\n\nAs I said when talking about the first book, this is a book for young adults and adults, especially those who enjoy dark adventures and fantasy with paranormal elements included. But, although the cruelty and violence are not described in extreme gory detail, this is a book that some would include into the horror category, and I would not recommend it for children or adults who are squeamish or scare easily. Some of the topics are also quite difficult, as we have broken families, illness, death, and matters of heaven and hell, and I’d recommend parents to check the book first themselves.\n\nThe book is well-written, has great characters (we get to see a more reflective Philip, who has to confront personal challenges and make some extremely difficult decisions), and it succeeds in building up the world of the series and in increasing its complexity. We also get a sample of the next book in the series, The Wrongful Death, which is scheduled for publication in the spring of 2019, at the back of the novel. Personally, I can’t wait.\n\nMarch 22, 2021\n\n\"The Die of Death\" is the second installment in The Great Devil War series by Kenneth B. Andersen. Check out my review of the first book The Devil’s Apprentice! This series follows a middle-grade boy Phillip, who finds himself in hell after being accidentally killed. He doesn’t belong in hell since he is inherently very good-natured. The first book narrates his dilemma of whether he should to be good person or embrace his bad side which is brought out by staying in Hell. He meets some very interesting people in hell including Lucifer, a talking cat Lucifax, Hell’s gatekeeper Grumblebeard and a devil-girl Satina with whom he forms a growing friendship. Laced with humor and having undertones of deeper themes, this series has all the components of a good YA fantasy series.\n\nAt the start of the book, Phillip has returned to normal life at school. However, his time in Hell has changed him. He has become good at lying to people, which was impossible for him a few months ago. He plays pranks on people and doesn’t do his homework. Strangely, he also keeps having near-death experiences. Then suddenly, he finds himself in the Other-world again.\n\nDeath is a major part as well as a character in this book. I liked that the plot was not similar to the first book and more like the start of something bigger. The hourglass concept was very interesting. The writing was more developed than the first book and I enjoyed it in this part more. Phillip’s emotional struggle was shown very clearly. Satina’s character felt a bit different in this book. I still can’t quite figure her out, and I’m hoping to know her better in the upcoming books. I liked how Phillips and Satina’s relationship slowly developed. There was a focus on characters other than Phillip as well in this book such as Grumblebeard and Ravine. The characters did come off as a bit ridiculous at times instead of funny. Also, I feel that at the beginning of the book, it took too much time to explain why Phillip was sent to Hell.\n\nIn terms of originality, this series does follow the trope of a regular boy being special and destined for something bigger. But the way that the author has created the world and executes the plot, it doesn’t feel the same as other YA fantasy series.\n\nThe enjoyed the ending and it was well-done. It was unexpected, and I could see that the story isn’t over.\n\nCheck out my book reviews, recommendations, and other content on Travelling Through Words and my bookstagram!\n\nOctober 28, 2022\n\n4.5 stars\n\nBack in November the author reached out to me and asked me if I would be interested in reading and reviewing his book The Devil's Apprentice which is the first book in this series. I have to admit that I almost turned it down solely because I wasn't a fan of the cover but then I read the synopsis and was intrigued. I am so glad I didn't turn down reading the first book because it became a favorite and now I am here to review book 2. The author was kind enough to provide me with books 2-4 and I am participating in a blog tour for all 3 of them.\n\nThis book picks up 6 months after where book one left off and once again Philip ends up back in Hell. This time to help Death because the Die of Death was stolen. I will say the beginning was a little slow going for me at first but things quickly pick up.\n\nJust like with the first book this one is imaginative except this time we not only get descriptions of Hell but we also the realm of Death and Purgatory. Kenneth does an awesome job with describing everything that I was able to picture what it would be like.\n\nThe chapters are short which I love and it's was a quick engaging read. This one did seem a little darker to me but it wasn't over the top. I can't wait to start reading the third book.\n\nMay 12, 2021\n\nThis is the second book in The Great Devil War series. I really enjoyed the first book, and the second book was no different! I still stand by my opinion that this reads on the younger side of YA even though it’s a little dark. In this installment, Phillip has to help Mortimer (death) find his die and save the underworld again. It was nice to return to this world and see these characters again, especially Satina who I really enjoyed from the first book! It was also nice to see Phillip’s character development – he went from a goody-two-shoes to completely evil and back in the first book, and here we see him finding a middle ground and really coming into his own.\n\nThis is a very quick series to read, and was really enjoyable. My only complaint would be that Phillip seems a little juvenile, especially when you look at what kids are really like today but at the same time it’s refreshing to have a kid be so….well, childlike!\n\nThe mystery aspect of this book was fun as well, and overall this was a fun, engaging, and fast paced read! It’ll be interesting seeing where this series goes next!\n\nNovember 30, 2011\n\nUdmærket, men jeg kunne bedre lide første bind i serien.\n\nMay 24, 2020\n\n3.5 stars rounded up\n\nIt was nice to come back to Philip's story and see what happens in the second book of The Great Devil War series. Quite a bit of time has passed since we last met Philip and as we know from book one, he experienced quite a lot of growth (in both good and bad ways!) since his time spent in Hell as the Devil's apprentice. Sure, in many ways, Philip is still a 'good boy' but he's certainly no longer an angel. It was nice to see him slowly start to make friends in this book and to see the change in Sam, the infamous school bully, become Philip's 'guardian angel' of sorts! If there's one element I wish we saw more of, it would be Philip's time on earth, as it seems there's a fair bit that happens but we don't get to see it.\n\nWhile the main focus of the story is on solving the mystery of who stole Death's die, there were other minor storylines that came together really neatly in the end. I feel like this book really sets the foundation of the unrest that's brewing amongst the devils ever since book one ended. Surprisingly, we don't spend that much time with Mortimer (Death) although I found his parts, especially in his house with the hourglasses, really intriguing. Unlike how the Devil really grew on me in the first book, I don't think that really happened with Death, although he wasn't as scary as he was made out to be in book one. We also see less of Lucifer and Lucifax, which was a little disappointing, but we spend a lot more time with Philip, Satina, Ravine and Grumblebeard. As morbid as the descriptions are in the book (as to be expected in a book about hell), the cheeky and dry humour from the characters and their interactions really had me chuckling a fair bit. I also love the regular references to characters that we know of in real life (like Hitler) and these little character easter eggs, alongside the mystery and humour, kept me thoroughly entertained throughout the read.\n\nI will say that the burgeoning romance between Philip and Satina isn't really working for me though. I feel like it's a little forced and I wish that their relationship stayed platonic rather than the awkward pre-pubescent romance vibes that we get between them. That said, it doesn't play a major role in the story although Philip does moon a lot over Satina :)\n\nThe exploration of morality and the way that Andersen brings hell to life on the page continues to make this series one of the more unique stories I've had the pleasure of reading. I'm becoming even more curious about Andersen's inspiration for this book! I mean, besides the obvious. Overall, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next in the great devil war and I have a feeling that the storyline will really pick up after this book!\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\nBook source ~ Tour\n\n14-yr-old Philip Engel has survived relatively unscathed during his time as apprentice to Lucifer. He’s been sent back to Earth with a soul that’s a little less angelic which garners him some actual friends at school. When Death comes knocking though, back he goes to the Underworld. Mortimer’s Die has been stolen and he desperately needs Philip’s help to find it before the natural order of things is completely out of whack. Satina, his devil friend, is there to help while they look for clues and track it down. But they’re having a hard time making any headway. Well, this is Hell after all. Did he think it would be a walk in the park?\n\nAre you looking for an easy read that will keep you guessing and have you rooting for the little guy? Then look no further. This book is a great way to pass the day. Philip is a smart cookie and a wonderful character and side characters aren’t too shabby either. The mystery isn’t easy to solve and there’s drama, humor, and danger along the way. Keep in mind that Philip and Satina are young adult. Very young adult at 14, so adults, at times, might be like, you idiot! Use your brain! But they are young and have no wisdom yet. So, don’t get too upset when they screw up. It’s all a part of growing up. Yes, even in Hell. I look forward to book III!\n\nApril 5, 2020\n\nThis is the second book in the Great Devil War series and I enjoyed it as much The first one, The Devil’s Apprentice.\n\nThe story continues where it left off in book one, with Philip a changed boy, no longer the “angel” he was at the beginning of his journey.\n\nThis time, Philip dies again for all intents and purposes and reaches Hell. He is greeted by Satina, a demon friend he made in his previous journey to Hell, that he had missed dearly. Thus he learns that he’d been summoned by Mortimer, Death himself to help solve a mystery and save Hell once more. Isn’t it funny how the fate of the underworld came to depend on the mystery-solving skills of an 11-year old human boy?\n\nJoking aside, Philip is no longer the good boy who’d help anyone without expecting anything in return. His previous time in Hell has shaped him in ways that life on Earth had failed to. He’s more cunning and even strikes a deal with Death for his help.\n\nDuring his adventures in Hell, Philip learns that immortality isn’t as desirable as one might think and that Death isn’t meaningless.\n\n“Death isn’t an unfortunate consequence of life; on the contrary, Death is what makes life worth living. Men and women value only that which they might lose. Don’t you see? Without death, life is uninteresting and utterly meaningless.”\n\nWhen something he discovers on Mortimer’s shelf affects him deeply, he strikes a bargain with Death and undertakes the quest he was brought in for: recovering the stolen die of Death, the die with a hundred faces that determines how many years every human lives, in exchange for a favor.\n\nRead the whole review here: https://www.summonfantasy.com/book-re...\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n2.25⭐️\n\nNie podoba mi się to, w jaki sposób przedstawieni są Diabeł i Śmierć - jaki to autorytet, gdy 13-sto letni chłopiec rozwiązuje problemy, z którymi oni sobie nie radzą\n\nJuly 13, 2024\n\nBanger opfølger. Godt nok får bogen kun fire stjerner, men der er ingen tvivl om, at Dødens Terning er en nærmest perfekt opfølger. Der er så meget, som jeg elsker ved den her bog, så lad os kigge på det, ikkeeee?\n\n- Kenneths univers bliver stærkt udbygget. Bogen omhandler adskillige områder, som ikke befinder sig i Helvede. Dødens rige, Ydergård og Skærsilden spiller alle vigtige roller i bogen, og er en velkommen forandring, der gør, at bogen ikke føles som om, at den træder vande. Man er over 100 sider inde i bogen, før Filip kommer til Helvede igen, og omkring halvvejs, før Lucifer dukker op. Men det er ikke blot udenfor Helvede, at verdenen bliver bygget videre på. Også indenfor porten bliver der udforsket nyt territorie. Straffe for de fordømte, såsom Galgedalen, Isfloden og Mareridsmosen gør underriget til et endnu mere gyseligt sted, men der er også andre tilføjelser. Både inddragelsen af Satinas skole samt alderdomshjemmet gør, at verden føles lidt mere levende (haaaa) og gør den på samme tid også lidt mere menneskelig, for mangel på bedre beskrivelse.\n\n- Skumleskægs karakter bliver uddybet en del. Ikke nok med at han oplever kærlighed, så bliver hans baggrund og synd også udforsket, hvilket gør en allerede venlig karakter endnu mere sympatisk.\n\n- Plottet, som omhandler tyveriet af dødens terning leder til nogle ret heftige temaer. Spørgsmål om mortalitet, udødelighed og straffen af evigt liv bliver udforsket på en måde, der giver en et godt perspektiv. Det selvsamme plot bygger også til noget større, og folk, som har læst serien før, ved, at handlingen i bogen er meget vigtig for senere hændelser, især slutningen på bogen.\n\n- Aziel er tilbage, og selvom han kun kortvarigt optræder i bogen, så er de par kapitler, hvor han optræder, super effektive i at opbygge hans karakter. Man får et stærkt indblik i, helt præcist for forskruet og ondskabsfuld han er, men på samme tid også hvor intelligent og intimiderende han bliver.\n\n- Filip og Satina. Yes please, it's too cuuute.\n\n- Ravine. Yas queen, slay that shit.\n\nFordi alle er glade, og du er glad og jeg er glad, så skal vi da haaaa' en rigtig banger sang på programmet. 'Legend Has It' af Run the Jewels, fra deres fantastiske (og bedste) album, 'Run The Jewels 3' (meget kreativ titel).\n\nIgen plagierer jeg en, som er mig meget kær, når jeg siger: Toodles!\n\nDecember 23, 2019\n\nI liked the first one but I think I actually liked this one better. I love how Kenneth is really good with story telling. He builds a world up and makes me feel like I'm there with Phillip. The only thing I wish is that Phillip wasn't so juvenile. With the way kids are now he doesn't really seem to fit. But he is a likeable character!\n\nRead\n\nMay 3, 2020\n\nMy Rating: 4.5 stars\n\nThis Review is part of #TheDieofDeath #UltimateBlogTour hosted by TheWriteReads\n\nThanks a ton, Dave from @TheWriteReads and the author-Kenneth B. Andersen, for giving me this opportunity and providing me with a free e-book copy of ‘The Die of Death’ on exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.\n\nJust like the previous book in the series, The Die of Death has a cover captivating enough to grab the reader’s attention at first sight. Mortimer -the Death himself, with facial features so keen & cold, has been shown riding a nightmarish three-legged Hel Horse. The Valley of Gallows has been pictured in the background, where the bodies of the condemned have been shown hanging from the gallows. This fascinating portrayal of the theme of the story ignites the urge in the reader’s mind to delve into the story without any delay.\n\nIt could have been a normal day for Phillip as he is hanging out with his school friends and being mischievous. However, when Death himself has decided to pay a visit to Phillip, how can he not have premonitions? Phillip this time has been called from Life to the depths of Hell for quite a different purpose. It is the matter of Life and Death. The Die of Death has been stolen! That very die which when rolled determines the life span of a mortal person! How hard is it to imagine what immortality feels like?\n\nDeath is a word feared by most. No Human being wants to be lost in oblivion. Death is perceived as an antipathetic and an unfortunate event. Something we are always scared of. But death is not a word to be despised. We realise that good cannot exist without evil, similarly Life has no practicality or worth without the existence of Death. An eternal life or the power of immortality is desired by many, however have we thought of the consequences? With passing time, we become old, debilitated, powerless, the meaning of our very existence starts fading away. A mortal life gives a human being the significance, the worth of existence that he/she deserves.\n\nEven Devils do not have the pleasure of experiencing a life full of utmost satisfaction, their immortality being the paramount cause!\n\nI LOVE how K.B. Anderson every time, through his splendid way of storytelling, ingeniously gives a significant message out to the readers.\n\nIn Die of Death, we get to accompany Philip into the deeper corners of the underworld. So many new places in and around Hell are discovered. The Valley of Gallows- where the bodies of the condemned are hanged, with the noose so tight around their neck that it penetrates the flesh, incapacitating them so much that not a word is heard but only moans, moans filled with distress and horror. The ground is so wet with tears and blood that not a single footprint can be left unnoticed. The Purgatory -where the sins of the condemned are cleansed as they ascend to Heaven. The high mountain cliff ablaze with a flame black in colour burns their sins. The souls desperately repenting their deeds are struggling to climb up the steep hill, their bodies set ablaze with the flame that burns their sins so vehemently that the air around feels scorching and piercing. We also get to pay a visit to Death’s humble abode! A place outside the gates of Hell where there is no pandemonium. The darkness and the coldness here is so piercing! The sky is always dark like hell except that in Death’s place the sky is full of gloom and delirium. The incessant depths of forest is dull and colourless and full of dead and hunchbacked flowers, the trees and air feel like fall, dead leaves resting on the ground, the branches of trees extending like conjoined skeletal forearms! The only place where you can feel alive, amidst the smell of death, is inside the basement of Death’s house which is full of myriads of hourglasses with the swift movement of sand inside. The hourglasses determine Life and death unveiling the many deeds that a mortal being is capable of in his lifetime. The basement is certainly the best place that I have visited in the underworld! The narrative is so brilliant that you can form a crystal clear image in your head and you feel like you are actually living and experiencing and seeing things in real!\n\nPhilip’s emotions are manifested on a greater level in this book of the series. Time and again Philip finds himself lost in a cobweb of critical situations. Situations which can never be avoided by Philip as his whole life and happiness revolve around them! Quite often while reading I found my eyes almost teary and could feel the horripilation on my arms. How much despairing and stressful can it be for a fourteen-year-old boy to choose between things which are eminently significant in his life? Philip’s business in Hell is to find the stolen die but it is not that simple since his own life has been miserably connected to the event that makes it an inescapable and herculean experience all together!\n\nBesides, albeit Philip’s visit in Hell and his previous achievement at saving Lucifer’s life and unmasking the murderous devil child has gained him quite a huge number of fan followers in the underworld, Philip has also managed to ignite hatred and repugnance within the minds of some devils in Hell and also vile and vicious creatures in the Outer Reach. The past has not been forgotten or forgiven. The malicious and acerbic shadows still lurk within and outside of Hell.\n\nWill Philip be able to retrieve the Die of Death from the obdurate fists of the thieves? Or shall he lose and kill his most priced possessions? How much of the past has been forgotten?? Shall the egregious shadows of evil once again visit Philip?? Is Philip ready to have his mind jumbled up sadistically?\n\nTo sum up I would say that I have a feeling that the quality of the stories in the series will keep on towering more and more. K.B. Andersen is an excellent penman! It was indeed a good decision signing up for the tours!\n\nThe amazing world-building and the impeccable expression of the characters and the author’s imaginative mind has been put down in black and white so finely that it keeps the readers going and turning the pages. In ‘The Devil’s Apprentice’ I found myself lagging behind a bit midway, but ‘The Die of Death’ has been certainly a more enjoyable journey for me! You cannot get your eyes off the pages of the book. The narrative is fast paced with a quality of language which is easily understandable. The ambiance and the mood that has been built in the story is so perfect to keep a reader engaged for a longer period of time. Each and every chapter is full of mysteries and adventures which are so excellently fascinating and entertaining! Guess The concept behind each and every book of the series keeps on getting better and more riveting! I am so eagerly looking forward to reading the next book ‘The Wrongful Death’ in the series! 10/10 recommending ‘The Devil’s Apprentice’ and ‘The Die of Death’ to all the fantasy lovers out there and to other readers in general who would enjoy reading something different!\n\nCheck out my Blog: https://musingsofanepeolator.home.blog/\n\nApril 13, 2020\n\nThis book was provided for review by the author and The Write Reads. Thank you!\n\nThe Die of Death by Kenneth B. Andersen is the second book in his very popular The Great Devil War series. Picking up roughly six month after the events of the first book in the series – The Devil’s Apprentice – we are once again reunited with the main character Philip.\n\nMuch has changed for Philip since his time in Hell. No longer the ‘goody two shoes’ that he was in the first book, he has made new friends from old enemies. He still remembers his old friends from Hell though and after a terrible storm one night, he is reunited with them on an all too familiar staircase.\n\nAs in the first book, the majority of the story takes place in Hell. And again, as with the first book, Andersen has out done himself in bringing the place to “life”. His descriptions of the places Philip and Sabine visit make it quite easy to picture. The addition of the lands of Purgatory and of Death’s domain also serve to expand this particular universe.\n\nWhile the actual setting of The Die of Death is wonderfully rounded out further in this second book, it is the changes that the actual characters go through that truly help move the story along. Mortimer – aka Death – is better rounded out and as the book goes on we truly see the kind of person he is. And we come to realize, just as Philip does, that death is a part of life and is not something to be feared.\n\nSometimes, the second book of a series is not as strong as the first. This is simply not true with The Die of Death. It easily holds its own and is as enjoyable as the first book. I loved reading it and look forward to reading the rest of the series.\n\nMarch 29, 2020\n\nHow I read this: free review copy for blog tour, also purchased\n\nThere are so many reasons I love this series and this book. I sometimes worry about sequels, but I really shouldn’t have for this one – the sequel to The Devil's Apprentice certainly didn’t disappoint! It read just as easily, in fact, I finished it in one day and immensely enjoyed it. Can’t wait to get my hands on the next one! Here's a full review on my blog, if you want to find out more about why I recommend reading it:\n\nhttps://avalinahsbooks.space/die-of-d...\n\nI thank the author and The Write Reads tours for giving me a free copy in exchange to an honest review (I have also purchased my own copy). This has not affected my opinion.\n\nBook Blog | Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter\n\nApril 5, 2019\n\nPhilip's adventures as the Devil's apprentice have changed him—in a good way. Although he misses his friends in Hell, he has made new friends in life. But when the future of the underworld is threatened once again, Philip’s help is needed. Death's Die has been stolen and immortality is spreading across the globe. Philip throws himself into the search—and discovers a horrible truth about his own life along the way.\n\nThe Die of Death is volume 2 in The Great Devil War-series.\n\nPicking up a few months after the conclusion of the first book, Philip has never done better in his life!\n\nI really liked how the world in the story is expanded.\n\nA fantastic and unpredictable book where anything can happen. We meet all the beloved characters again\n\nSurprising ending that leaves one speculating what will happen next.\n\nReally great book and I can't wait to read the next one.\n\nI received a free copy via the author and this is my own voluntary honest review.\n\nOctober 5, 2023\n\nMorsom, velskrevet og letlæst fantasybog.\n\nJeg fløj igennem bogen på en weekend og var rigtig godt underholdt undervejs.\n\nAt følge drengen Filip på hans ture til helvede er bestemt ikke kedeligt. Djævelen, Døden, Skærsilden, Hitler og Judas - intet eller ingen er for stor til at få en omgang humor med på vejen når denne forfatter fortæller sine historier.\n\nBogen giver derudover et vigtigt og indsigtfuldt billede af nødvendigheden af selve døden - måske et lidt tungt emne for en børnebog, derfor er det også endnu mere beundringsværdig når moralen er så eminent godt leveret som tilfældet er her.\n\nJeg glæder mig meget til at læse videre i serien.\n\nApril 16, 2019\n\nAnother great book following the first. Couldn’t read it fast enough\n\nMarch 31, 2020\n\n*First and foremost, I have received a free e-copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.*\n\nThis series really took me by surprise. I mean it in the best way possible. As I said in my first review, I was afraid it wouldn't be my cup of tea (for reasons unknown to me), but the first book turned out to be a great, super fun and original adventure story. I'm happy to report the second book didn't disappoint either!\n\nWe start not too long after we left off. After his time in Hell, Philip comes back changed - he makes new friends and leaves his angel ways behind. He's not quite the devil he's turned into under Lucifer's wing, but he's definitely easier to tempt and give into some not-so-innocent fun. Just as he thinks he is back for good - the underworld needs him again! The die of Death has been stolen.\n\nI want to start with saying it was such a pleasure returning to this world. I didn't realise just how attached I got to it until I went back to the story. Hell is an interesting place, and we find out even more about its rules and inner workings. Just like in the first book we meet a few biblical and historical figures, and those small references interwoven in the story really add a lot of depth to the overall world building. Andersen adds so much richness to the world, expanding the underworld and showing us the outer perimeter of Hell and Mortimer's house, as well as telling us about more sinister places I'm sure we'll visit in the later books.\n\nI said it before and I'll say it again - Philip is a great protagonist to follow. He's incredibly likeable, even when he strays, and you really root for him throughout the story. I loved seeing all the other characters, too! When Philip comes back to Lucifer's palace, it's like a family reunion. It's heart warming as Philip comes from a broken family and has never met his father. I really like how consistent the characters stay in the second book - in some books, especially in sequels, the secondary characters tend to loose their personality a bit, especially if they're taking the back burner after being one of the mains in the first book. Instead they become plot devices. That wasn't the case in The Die of Death.\n\nI loved the plot and pacing of this one. Philip is back in Hell to find Death's missing die. Without it, Death can't establish the length of the humans' life - and that makes them immortal. While investigating the missing die, Philip discovers something about his own family and things get even more complicated. There's never a dull moment in The Die of Death. The plot is gripping from start to finish, with more intrigue added as we go. First book talked a lot about morality and in this one we focus more on immortality and what it means to live forever. I really like that there is depth to each of those stories other than just the adventure story we see on the surface. My only qualm is the subplot with Philip's father and the fact that it was done twice. I understand where it came from, but it made the ending seem a bit repetitive and predictable.\n\nI can't wait to continue with the series and I'll be picking up the third book real soon, as this was a pleasure to read!\n\nApril 14, 2020\n\nI just want to place my initial reaction in the aftermath of reading the first 50 pages:\n\nOh wow. When I say that the first 50 pages of Die of Death is a whirlwind of action and I was on the edge of my seat, thinking WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?!\n\nIt’s an understatement.\n\nI think one of the things that I thoroughly enjoyed from Kenneth B. Anderson’s Devil’s Apprentice, which is book one of The Great Devil War, I claimed that the action element and the pacing of the novel was one of its strengths. There is something always happening and you feel that it is a high stakes situation. You get emotionally invested in the triumphs and tribulations of the characters.\n\nI had so much fun reading this book and it was exactly what I needed right now with everything going on (STAY INSIDE AND WASH YOUR HANDS AND JUST BE SAFE PLEASE, ESPECIALLY YOU AUSTRALIANS I SEE YOU STILL AT THE BEACH GO THE FUCK HOME). I didn’t realise how much I missed the characters of Philip and Satina and GRUMBLEBEARD MY PRECIOUS (he redeems himself at the end thankfully, I was STRESSED).\n\nIf this post feels slightly chaotic it is because I am currently, slighty chaotic.\n\nThe world, the mythology and the cast of characters blew me away again. I might have to say that The Die of Death might be my favourite of the series, well, of the two I have read because I found it so much more engaging as well as hilarious. The amount of times I laughed out loud surprised me! In this book, we find out more about the different ‘levels’ so to speak, of the Underworld, of the different punishments and positions of various ‘Devils’. It also brought forward an interesting discussion surrounding death, mortality and immortality which I found to be quite powerful especially considering the demographic and audience of the books.\n\nI think for me the character that I hold a new connection too would have to be Mortimer, or Death. There is a scene at the end of the book which I won’t disclose because of spoilers and i do want to keep this review spoiler free. But this scene was so heartwarming and made me absolutely adore Mortimer. If you know which scene I’m talking about – tell me I’m wrong! I had tears in my eyes, not going to lie. His character was both morally ambiguous but empathetic – we got to see Death as mortal and it was a humbling experience for him, I think. Well, I believe he realised something about maybe himself or the world and I just really enjoyed his character.\n\nPhilip was exactly the same and I enjoyed his character. He goes through slightly more emotional growth, I feel, in this book. I am beginning to see his maturity develop has he grows up and I cannot wait to see how he matures over the course of the series. BUT CAN I JUST SAY HOW MUCH I HATE FREAKING AZIEL LIKE I KNEW HE WOULD COME BACK BUT I WAS HOPING HE WOULD NOT AND WHEN HE DID I ACTUALLY SCREAMED.\n\nThe pacing and the action as well as the twist and turns of the plot itself was magnificent. I read this book in a few hours in one sitting, that is how much I enjoyed the pacing and the plot and the characters. It was just such a fun freaking time.\n\nMy only criticism, and its not really a criticism just a little pet peeve, is that I really wish Satina had more of a role, so to speak, in the overall action and mystery-solving. I really enjoy her character but I feel as though sometimes she is just there to provide a sort of side-kick character on the periphery as well as the love interest for Philip. She doesn’t really give anything else to the story and I think that is something which is lacking in the plot – strong, female characters as most are men or male-creatures.\n\nOverall, I had such a fun time reading this book and I cannot wait to read the third book in the series. I rated The Die of Death by Kenneth B. Anderson 4 out of 5 stars. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to lovers of fantasy as well as re-tellings(?) – it is fast paced, interesting and high-stakes sort of action.\n\nI just want to thank The Write Reads for the opportunity to read and review this book as part of the blog tour. And I urge you all to check out the other stops on the blog tour as well! We have a really great time doing these and I hope you all enjoy the reviews and all the good stuff that comes out of it.\n\nDecember 13, 2019\n\nThe cover of The Die of Death was the first thing that I noticed about the book. It is one of the more arresting covers that I have seen, ever. It caught my eye and made me wonder what the book was going to be like.\n\nThe Die of Death is the 2nd book in The Great Devil War series. You cannot read this as a stand-alone. It will help if you read the previous books to understand what was going on in this book. I can’t stress this enough. You will be lost if you decide to read The Die of Death first.\n\nThe Die of Death is billed as a young adult fantasy. Because of the subjects discussed and portrayed, I would suggest that an older teen (16+) read the book.\n\nThe Die of Death’s plotline was fast-paced. But, it wasn’t so fast that I had issues following the plotline. The author knew when to slow down enough for critical scenes to be absorbed. Also, there were no dropped storylines or characters. I loved it!!\n\nPhilip was different in The Die of Death. His time in Hell had changed him. He stood in a more morally gray area. He was still a “good” boy, but there was an edge to him. I wasn’t surprised when he died again. But I was surprised when he was tasked with finding Mortimer’s dice. With Satina’s help (and I loved how teed off she was with him at the beginning), he started to dig into who had the dice. I did not doubt that he would find the dice. But I was surprised at the twists and turns that the story took to get there. Philip visited Purgatory (which was nothing like I imagined) and spent time at Mortimer’s house. I can’t go much after that because of massive spoilers. All I will say is that I wasn’t expecting Philip’s storyline to turn out the way it did.\n\nI loved that the author took evil historical figures and peppered them throughout the book. I had a deep sense of satisfaction when I saw that Jack the Ripper was being chased by the women he murdered.\n\nPhilip and Satina’s developing romantic relationship was cute. There were a few “aww” moments with them during the book. I hope that they stay strong in the next book!!\n\nLucifer was a considerable presence in the book. I am still trying to wrap my head around him being fatherly to Philip. Not something I would even think to say when I think of the devil. I will say that I didn’t agree with his decision, and yes, it did hasten things up quite a bit.\n\nThe storyline involving the dice was interesting. I wasn’t expecting who took it. I did think it was another person, so, yes, I was surprised. But, I was also saddened by why the person took it. The hourglasses also saddened me along with the bargain Philip made with Mortimer.\n\nThe end of The Die of Death was bittersweet. I wasn’t surprised at who was in Mortimer’s basement. I also wasn’t surprised at what that person did and attempted to do. He got what was coming to him. There was also a perfect lead in to the next book, which I can’t wait to read!!!\n\nApril 4, 2020\n\nThe story picks up not too long after the events that concluded The Devil's Apprentice. Philip is back above ground, so to speak, after his adventures in Hell. In the first book, Philip was accidentally sent to the underworld in a case of mistaken identity and found himself being groomed to take over the top job by the head honcho Satan himself. Philip learned a lot about himself during the time he spent in Hell, including his capacity to shed his goodie goodie persona for one that was a little more devious.\n\nTurns out he will need to harness all of the evil skills that he learned during his first sojourn as he is called back to the fiery pits of Hell to solve a mystery. It seems that Mortimer, who is actually \"Death\" has a bit of a problem that he needs fixing and 11 year-old Philip is the only one that can undertake the mission. The mission in this case is to try and recover the stolen Death's Die. If the Die is not recovered soon, immortality will spread across the globe in the living world and nobody will ever experience death, they will just live forever. You can see how this would cause a huge overpopulation problem right?\n\nPhilip undertakes the quest with not an insignificant amount of reservation, but what choice does he really have? When Death comes calling everyone must answer or face the consequences. But the mission is not without its travails and Philip soon discovers more about himself than he ever bargained for along the way. It's a race against time and death itself in this humorously enjoyable Satanic sequel.\n\nI enjoyed THE DIE OF DEATH even more than I did its predecessor. This is such a fun romp through the underworld and along the way we encounter various historical figures of dubious renown, which really lent a lot more to the story this time around. Whereas the first book dealt a lot with Philips situation and his training, this book focuses more on a mystery that is pretty exciting and engrossing and Philip just gets to be himself. We experience everything that happens through his eyes and what a fun journey it is.\n\nKenneth B. Andersen truly has written a very accessible YA fantasy series that any age group of reader can enjoy. The wonderful biting humor and satire are what make this book and series such a joy to sink yourself into. I found THE DIE OF DEATH to be a fast read with great world-building and a main character in Philip who you can really see maturing before your eyes. I look forward to getting to read book 3 very soon and reviewing that one on the next Blog Tour!"
