        "text": "William S. Burroughs, 1914–1997\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs was a Beat Generation writer known for his startling, nontraditional accounts of drug culture, most famously in the book 'Naked Lunch.'\n\nWilliam Burroughs became one of the founding figures of the Beat Movement. An addict for years, he crafted books like Junky and Naked Lunch, which were harrowing, often grotesque looks at drug culture. He is cited as a major influence on countercultural figures in the world of music as well and worked on several recording projects.\n\nSchool and Travels\n\nBorn on February 5, 1914, in St. Louis, Missouri, Burroughs was born to Laura Lee and Mortimer Burroughs. Burroughs was named after his famous grandfather, an inventor who was a pioneer in adding-machine technology.\n\nBurroughs attended prep schools and later studied English literature at Harvard University, where he graduated in 1936. He traveled to Europe and met and married Ilse Klapper for the purpose of allowing her entry into the United States. The two ended the union upon their entry into the states.\n\nMeeting Fellow Beats Ginsberg and Kerouac\n\nTrying different career paths to no avail, Burroughs eventually traveled to New York and met writers Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac in the mid-1940s. The three would be heralded as starting the Beat Movement, an artistic outpouring of nontraditional, free expression.\n\nDuring the mid-1940s, Burroughs and Kerouac collaborated on a novel about the murder of a friend—And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks—that was published decades later posthumously. Burroughs developed a relationship with Joan Vollmer during this time as well and they would live together as husband and wife starting in 1945. Burroughs was also open about his attraction to men, and he and Ginsberg had been lovers.\n\nBurroughs had started to use opiates and descended into heroin addiction. He was also a gun enthusiast and, while living with his family in Mexico City in 1951, played a drunken game of target practice with Vollmer and accidentally shot her to death. He did not receive major prison time, yet would struggle with demons for years to come as a result of the killing.\n\nWriting 'Junky' and 'Naked Lunch'\n\nBurroughs published his first novel, Junky, in 1953 under the name William Lee. The work featured an unflinching, semi-autobiographical look at drug, or \"junk,\" culture. He continued to travel and eventually ended up in Tangiers, strung out and running out of financial resources. He realized he would perish if he didn’t change his path and so traveled to London to receive apomorphine treatments, which he credits as curing his addiction.\n\nWith the help of Ginsberg and Kerouac, Burroughs wrote the novel Naked Lunch in Tangiers, which continued to follow the exploits of William Lee in a disturbing drug culture journey. The book featured nonlinear narrative forms with elements of sadomasochism, metamorphoses and satire. Published in 1959, the book wouldn’t be released in the United States until the 1960s due to a highly publicized governmental ban over its content, which pushed Burroughs into the spotlight. He became a figure both acclaimed and spurned.\n\nAround the time of Lunch's release, inspired by artist Brion Gysin, Burroughs began to experiment with the cut-up technique, where random lines of text were cut from a page and rearranged to form new sentences, with the intention of freeing reader's minds from conventional, linear modes of thought. Using this technique with elements of satire and sci-fi, the 1960s saw Burroughs releasing novels like The Soft Machine (1961) and Nova Express (1964), which indicted consumerism and social repression, and the nonfiction work The Yage Letters (1963).\n\nMusical Influence\n\nBurroughs played with audio cut-ups as well via tape recordings. He released his first album in 1965, Call Me Burroughs, which featured his readings of text from Naked Lunch and The Soft Machine. Burroughs not only made waves in the literary world but became a huge influence for many musical artists of the day. The acts Soft Machine and Steely Dan took their names from the writer’s work and Burroughs went on to collaborate with artists of the avant-garde like Laurie Anderson, Sonic Youth and Genesis P-Orridge.\n\nBurroughs continued his literary pursuits as well in the early 1970s, publishing The Wild Boys: A Book of the Dead (1971) and Exterminator! (1973) and penning a screenplay, The Last Words of Dutch Schulz. By the end of the decade, he worked on a book with Gysin that delved into their cut-up philosophy—The Third Mind (1978).\n\nBurroughs would face family tragedy yet again as his son Billy Burroughs Jr., also a writer, succumbed to substance addiction and died from alcohol-related trauma in 1981.\n\nIn 1983, Burroughs was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and in 1984 was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France. Jack Kerouac called Burroughs the \"greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift,\" a reputation he owes to his \"lifelong subversion\" of the moral, political and economic systems of modern American society, articulated in often darkly humorous sardonicism. J. G. Ballard considered Burroughs to be \"the most important writer to emerge since the Second World War,\" while Norman Mailer declared him \"the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius.\"\n\nDeath\n\nBurroughs died in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1997.\n\nThe POETRY OF WILLIAM BURROUGHS:\n\nAn Ongoing Attempt to Collect the Poetry of William S. Burroughs:\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs is generally considered a novelist. To make the case that he was also a poet is neither revisionist nor perverse but absurd. After all, Burroughs paid about as much obeisance to genre or medium as he did to the law. His work consistently ignored the traditional boundaries between forms of creative production — to the point where, if you were really to collect Burroughs’ “poetry,” you would be hard-pressed to explain why you might leave out Naked Lunch. It may well be the most “poetic” text he ever wrote.\n\nAnd what of the cut-up? Is it poetry, prose, or something else altogether? Oliver Harris has broached the question in his essay “‘Burroughs Is a Poet Too, Really’: The Poetics of Minutes to Go.” Harris writes that, in Minutes to Go, poetry “is not understood in terms of words on the page but as the ‘place’ reached by a particular use of chance operations on pre-existing words.” It is a method “to be grasped by doing,” not a “content to be understood by interpretation.” This insightful analysis could serve as an introduction to this somewhat quixotic attempt to collect the poetry of William Burroughs, and Oliver Harris has very graciously allowed RealityStudio to republish it.\n\nPoems by William S.

Pool covered with green slime in a ruined French garden. Huge pathic frog rises slowly from the water on a mud platform playing the clavichord.A Sollubi rushes into the bar and starts polishing The Saint's shoes with the oil on his nose....\n\nThe Saint kicks him petulantly in the mouth. The Sollubi screams, whirls around and shits on the Saint's pants. Then he dashes into the street. A pimp looks after him speculatively....\n\nThe Saint calls the manager: \"Jesus, Al, what kinda creep joint you running here? My brand new fishskin Degagees...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Saint. He slipped by me.\"\n\n(The Sollubi are an untouchable caste in Arabia noted for their abject vileness. De luxe cafes are equipped with Sollubi who rim the guests while they eat -- holes in the seating benches being provided for this purpose. Citizens who want to be utterly humiliated and degraded -- so many people do, nowadays, hoping to jump the gun -- over themselves up for passive homosexual intercourse to an encampment of Sollubis.... Nothing like it, they tell me.... In fact, the Sollubi are subject to become wealthy and arrogant and lose their native vileness. What is origin of untouchable? Perhaps a fallen priest caste. In fact, untouchables perform a priestly function in taking on themselves all human vileness.)\n\nA. J. strolls through the Market in black cape with a vulture perched on one shoulder. He stands by a table of agents.\n\n\"This you gotta hear. Boy in Los Angeles fifteen year old. Father decide it is time the boy have his first piece of ass. Boy is lying on the lawn reading comic books, father go out and say: 'Son, here's twenty dollars; I want you to go to a good whore and get a piece of ass off her.'\n\n\"So they drive to this plush jump joint, and the father say, 'All right, son. You're on your own. So ring the bell and when the woman come give her the twenty dollars and tell her you want a piece of ass.'\n\n\" 'Solid, pop.'\n\n\"So about fifteen minutes later the boy comes out:\n\n\" 'Well, son, did you get a piece of ass?'\n\n\" 'Yeah. This gash comes to the door, and I say I want a piece of ass and lay the double sawski on her. We go up to her trap, and she remove the dry goods. So I switch my blade and cut a big hunk off her ass, she raise a beef like I am reduce to pull off one shoe and beat her brains out. Then I hump her for kicks.\"\n\nOnly the laughing bones remain, flesh over the hills and far away with the dawn wind and a train whistle. We are not unaware of the problem, and the needs of our constituents are never out of our mind being their place of residence and who can break a ninety-nine year synapses lease?\n\nAnother installment in the adventures of Clem Snide the Private Ass Hole: \"So I walk in the joint, and this female hustler sit at the bar, and I think, 'Oh God you're poule de luxe already.' I mean it's like I see the gash before. So I don't pay her no mind at first, then I dig she is rubbing her legs together and working her feet up behind her head shoves it down to give herself a douche job with a gadget sticks out of her nose the way a body can't help but notice.\"\n\nIris -- half Chinese and half Negro -- addicted to dihy-dro-oxy-heroin -- takes a shot every fifteen minutes to which end she leaves droppers and needles sticking out all over her. The needles rust in her dry flesh, which, here and there, has grown completely over a joint to form a smooth green brown wen. On the table in front of her is a samovar of tea and a twenty-pound hamper of brown sugar. No one has ever seen her eat anything else. It -is only just before a shot that she hears what anyone says or talks herself. Then she makes some flat, factual statement relative to her own person.\n\n\"My asshole is occluding.\"\n\n\"My cunt got terrible green juices.\"\n\nIris is one of Benway's projects. \"The human body can run on sugar alone, God damn it.... I am aware that certain of my learned colleagues, who are attempting to belittle my genius work, claim that I put vitamins and proteins into Iris's sugar clandestinely.... I challenge these nameless assholes to crawl up out of their latrines and run a spot analysis on Iris's sugar and her tea. Iris is a wholesome American cunt. I deny categorically that she nourishes herself on semen. And let me take this opportunity to state that I am a reputable scientist, not a charlatan, a lunatic, or a pretended worker of miracles.... I never claimed that Iris could subsist exclusive on photosynthesis.... I did not say she could breathe in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen -- I confess I have been tempted to experiment being of course restrained by my medical ethics.... In short, the vile slanders of my creeping opponents will inevitably fall back onto them and come to roost like a homing stool pigeon.\"\n\nMany an ill-starred actor has felt the icy blast of Slashtubitch's displeasure: \"Get out of my studio, you cheap four-flushing ham! Did you think to pass a counterfeit orgasm on me! THE GREAT SLASHTU-BITCH! I could tell if you come by regard the beeg toe. Idiot! Mindless scum!! Insolent baggage!!! Go peddle thy ass and know that it takes sincerity and art, and devotion, to work for Slashtubitch. Not shoddy trickery, dubbed gasps, rubber turds and vials of milk concealed in the ear and shots of Yohimbine sneaked in the wings.\" ( Yohimbine, derived from the bark of a tree growing in Central Africa, is the safest and most efficient aphrodisiac. It operates by dilating the blood vessels on the surface of the skin, particularly in the genital area. )\n\nSlashtubitch ejects his monocle. It sails out of sight, returns like a boomerang into his eye. He pirouettes and disappears in a blue mist, cold as liquid air...fadeout....\n\nOn Screen. Red-haired, green-eyed boy, white skin with a few freckles... kissing a thin brunette girl in slacks. Clothes and hair-do suggest existentialist bars of all the world cities. They are seated on low bed covered in white silk. The girl opens his pants with gentle fingers and pulls out his cock which is small and very hard. A drop of lubricant gleams at its tip like a pearl. She caresses the crown gently: \"Strip, Johnny.\" He takes off his clothes with swift sure movements and stands naked before her, his cock pulsing. She makes a motion for him to turn around and he pirouettes across the floor parodying a model, hand on hip. She takes off her shirt.\n\nHer breasts are high and small with erect nipples. She slips off her underpants. Her pubic hairs are black and shiny. He sits down beside her and reaches for her breast. She stops his hands.\n\n\"Darling, I want to rim you,\" she whispers.\n\n\"No. Not now.\"\n\n\"Please, I want to.\"\n\n\"Well, all right. I'll go wash my ass.\"\n\n\"No, I'll wash it.\"\n\n\"Aw shucks now, it ain't dirty.\"\n\n\"Yes it is. Come on now, Johnny boy.\"\n\nShe leads him into the bathroom. \"All right, get down.\" He gets down on his knees and leans forward, with his chin on the bath mat. \"Allah,\" he says. He looks back and grins at her. She washes his ass with soap and hot water sticking her finger up it.\n\n\"Does that hurt?\"\n\n\"Noooooooooo.\"\n\n\"Come along, baby.\" She leads the way into the bedroom. He lies down on his back and throws his legs back over his head, clasping elbows behind his knees. She kneel down and caress the backs of his thighs, his balls, running her fingers down the perennial divide. She push his cheeks apart, lean down and begin licking the anus, moving her head in a slow circle. She push at the sides of the asshole, licking deeper and deeper. He close his eyes and squirm. She lick up the perennial divide. His small, tight balls.... A great pearl stands out on the tip of his circumcised cock. Her mouth closes over the crown. She sucks rhythmically up and down, pausing on the up stroke and moving her head around in a circle. Her hand plays gently with his balls, slide down and middle finger up his ass. As she suck down toward the root of his cock she tickle his prostate mockingly. He grin and fart. She is sucking his cock now in a frenzy. His body begins to contract, pulling up toward his chin. Each time the contraction is longer.\n\n\"Wheeeeeeee!\" the boy yell, every muscle tense, his whole body strain to empty through his cock. She drinks his jissom which fills her mouth in great hot spurts. He lets his feet Hop back onto the bed. He arches his back and yawns. Mary is strapping on a rubber penis: \"Steely Dan III from Yokohama,\" she says, caressing the shaft. Milk spurts across the room.\n\n\"Be sure that milk is pasteurized. Don't go giving me some kinda awful cow disease like anthrax or glanders or aftosa....\"\n\n\"When I was a transvestite Liz in Chi used to work as an exterminator. Make advances to pretty boys for the thrill of being beaten as a man. Later I catch this one kid, overpower him with supersonic judo I learned from an old Lesbian Zen monk. I tie him up, strip off his clothes with a razor and fuck him with Steely Dan I. He is so relieved I don't castrate him literal he come all over my bedbug spray.\"\n\n\"What happen to Steely Dan II\"\n\n\"He was torn in two by a bull dike. Most terrific vaginal grip I ever experienced. She could cave in a lead pipe. It was one of her parlor tricks.\"\n\n\"And Steely Dan II\"\n\n\"Chewed to bits by a famished candiru in the Upper Baboonsasshole. And don't say 'Wheeeeeeee!' this time.\"\n\n\"Why not? It's real boyish.\"\n\n\"Barefoot boy, check thy bullheads with the madame.\"\n\nHe looks at the ceiling, hands behind his head, cock pulsing.\n\n\"So what shall I do? Can't shit with that dingus up me. I wonder is it possible to laugh and come at the same time? I recall, during the war, at the Jockey Club in Cairo, me and my asshole buddy, Lu, both gentlemen by act of Congress... nothing else could have done such a thing to either of us.... So we got laughing so hard we piss all over ourselves and the waiter say: 'You bloody hash-heads, get out of here!' I mean, if I can laugh the piss out of me I should be able to laugh out jissom. So tell me something real funny when I start coming. You can tell by certain premonitory quiverings of the prostate gland....\"\n\nShe puts on a record, metallic cocaine be-bop. She greases the dingus, shoves the boy's legs over his head and works it up his ass with a series of corkscrew movements of her fluid hips. She moves in a slow circle, revolving on the axis of the shaft. She rubs her hard nipples across his chest. She kisses him on neck and chin and eyes. He runs his hands down her back to her buttocks, pulling her into his ass. She revolves faster, faster. His body jerks and writhes in convulsive spasms.\n\n\"Hurry up, please,\" she says. \"The milk is getting cold.\"\n\nHe does not hear. She presses her mouth against his. Their faces run together. His sperm hits her breast with light, hot licks.\n\nMark is standing in the doorway. He wears a turtleneck black sweater. Cold, handsome, narcissistic face. Green eyes and black hair. He looks at Johnny with a slight sneer, his head on one side, hands on his jacket\n\nPistol Poem No. 2\n\nby WILLIAM BURROUGHS\n\nWho Controls The Control Men\n\nWho Controls The Men Control\n\nWho Controls Control Men The\n\nWho Controls Control The Men\n\nWho Controls Men The Control\n\nWho Controls Men Control The\n\nWho The Control Men Controls\n\nWho The Control Controls Men\n\nWho The Men Controls Control\n\nWho The Men Control Controls\n\nWho The Controls Control Men\n\nWho The Controls Men Control\n\nWho Control Men Controls The\n\nWho Control Men The Controls\n\nWho Control Controls The Men\n\nWho Control Controls Men The\n\nWho Control The Men Controls\n\nWho Control The Controls Men\n\nWho Men Controls The Control\n\nWho Men Controls Control The\n\nWho Men The Control Controls\n\nWho Men The Controls Control\n\nWho Men Control Controls The\n\nWho Men Control The Controls\n\nControls The Control Men Who\n\nControls The Control Who Men\n\nControls The Men Who Control\n\nControls The Men Control Who\n\nControls The Who Control Men\n\nControls The Who Men Control\n\nControls Control Men Who The\n\nControls Control Men The Who\n\nControls Control Who The Men\n\nControls Control Who Men The\n\nControls Control The Men Who\n\nControls Control The Who Men\n\nControls Men Who The Control\n\nControls Men Who Control The\n\nControls Men The Control Who\n\nControls Men The Who Control\n\nControls Men Control Who The\n\nControls Men Control The Who\n\nControls Who The Control Men\n\nControls Who The Men Control\n\nControls Who Control Men The\n\nControls Who Control The Men\n\nControls Who Men The Control\n\nControls Who Men Control The\n\nThe Control Men Who Controls\n\nThe Control Men Controls Who\n\nThe Control Who Controls Men\n\nThe Control Who Men Controls\n\nThe Control Controls Men Who\n\nThe Control Controls Who Men\n\nThe Men Who Controls Control\n\nThe Men Who Control Controls\n\nThe Men Controls Control Who\n\nThe Men Controls Who Control\n\nThe Men Control Who Controls\n\nThe Men Control Controls Who\n\nThe Who Controls Control Men\n\nThe Who Controls Men Control\n\nThe Who Control Men Controls\n\nThe Who Control Controls Men\n\nThe Who Men Controls Control\n\nThe Who Men Control Controls\n\nThe Controls Control Men Who\n\nThe Controls Control Who Men\n\nThe Controls Men Who Control\n\nThe Controls Men Control Who\n\nThe Controls Who Control Men\n\nThe Controls Who Men Control\n\nControl Men Who Controls The\n\nControl Men Who The Controls\n\nControl Men Controls The Who\n\nControl Men Controls Who The\n\nControl Men The Who Controls\n\nControl Men The Controls Who\n\nControl Who Controls The Men\n\nControl Who Controls Men The\n\nControl Who The Men Controls\n\nControl Who The Controls Men\n\nControl Who Men Controls The\n\nControl Who Men The Controls\n\nControl Controls The Men Who\n\nControl Controls The Who Men\n\nControl Controls Men Who The\n\nControl Controls Men The Who\n\nControl Controls Who The Men\n\nControl Controls Who Men The\n\nControl The Men Who Controls\n\nControl The Men Controls Who\n\nControl The Who Controls Men\n\nControl The Who Men Controls\n\nControl The Controls Men Who\n\nControl The Controls Who Men\n\nMen Who Controls The Control\n\nMen Who Controls Control The\n\nMen Who The Control Controls\n\nMen Who The Controls Control\n\nMen Who Control Controls The\n\nMen Who Control The Controls\n\nMen Controls The Control Who\n\nMen Controls The Who Control\n\nMen Controls Control Who The\n\nMen Controls Control The Who\n\nMen Controls Who The Control\n\nMen Controls Who Control The\n\nMen The Control Who Controls\n\nMen The Control Controls Who\n\nMen The Who Controls Control\n\nMen The Who Control Controls\n\nMen The Controls Control Who\n\nMen The Controls Who Control\n\nMen Control Who Controls The\n\nMen Control Who The Controls\n\nMen Control Controls The Who\n\nMen Control Controls Who The\n\nMen Control The Who Controls\n\nMen Control The Controls Who\n\n3.
