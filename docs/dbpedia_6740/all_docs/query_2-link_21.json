Burroughs on texts by a range of canonical writers, from William Shakespeare and Arthur Rimbaud to William Wordsworth and James Joyce. Burroughs selected the source texts, cut them up, and juxtaposed the fragments to select random word combinations and create new compositions. Only made available in the archives since 2010, The Travel Agency is on Fire will fascinate scholars and Burroughs fans alike, as they illuminate the experimental processes that underlie Burroughs' work.\"--Publisher's website (viewed 05/07/2015)."
