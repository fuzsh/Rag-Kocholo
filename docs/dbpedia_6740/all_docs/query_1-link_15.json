        "text": "Satire has the power to persuade and influence the reader to view the poets/authors viewpoint and used to expose various flaws within society such as foolishness, corruption, or racism. Bruce Dawe, a poet famous for his use of satire, criticises aspects of his society during the end of the 1960s, and the start of the 1970s in the following poems; “ A Victorian Hangman tells his love,” a poem criticising blind obedience of such a cruel and inhuman act, and “Weapons Training,” of how our attitude to certain races changes when at war and how cruel and harsh we can become. Bruce Dawe is widely recognised as Australia's most popular poet, born in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1930 and was educated at Northcote High School, Melbourne. “Dawe writes with…\n\nAlthough swift uses satire, I think it's not the best way to touch the subject, a subject that cannot be taken to lighten and that is not funny. In the first place, hunger and poverty cannot lead us to mockery or black humor because they are very…\n\nAlso, he states that he is not bent on his real ideas alone to fix the problem. Therefore, he says if there are any better ideas, that others should do it. He did not refute the opposing claims to leave room for those who may have better ideas than Swift and therefore, he is not so bent on his ideas. The weakness in Swift’s argument is that it does not account for how the people would feel about helping the poor. They may not feel the need to do anything for the poor; such as feeding them or giving them food.…\n\nHowever, it is insufficient just to humor one 's shock over the contention, or to grin at the jokes. Is Swift simply having some good times, or does he have something genuine to say? The subject of bias against the lower classes is uncovered in this piece, for example, the possibility that the bodies of the poor youngsters could be utilized for dress of wealthy people. Swift proposes, and additionally his statement that the proprietors have as of now \"ate up\" the poor babies ' folks, that the rich live to the detriment of the poor people. By alluding to the individual, \"a very worthy person,” Swift advances his parody of the privileged societies by suggesting that there are individuals so separated from the lower classes that they may agree with this shocking proposition.…\n\nBy proposing to treat the lower-class like livestock, the upper class becomes outraged at the dehumanization, and realizes how they have already dehumanized them. The satire prompts readers to form a counterargument to the proposal, which reveals the parallels between the proposal and their current treatment. When a reader makes their own realizations, and form their own conclusions, it increases the likelihood of them taking action, as opposed to being told how to act, proving Swift’s satire to be the most effective tone for his…\n\nThe usage of satire in this book is so that the readers can better understand why the underclass are making these types of decisions. It also helps explain why people like to jump to conclusions. An example of satire is when Miss Caroline scolded Scout for already knowing how to read. This is confusing to both Scout and the readers. Why would a teacher tell her student not to read?…\n\nIn 1729, Jonathan Swift wrote, “A Modest Proposal”, a satirical proposition, in response to the more modest but equally ridiculous proposals that had previously been sincerely proposed by others. “A Modest Proposal” was meant to criticize the Irish people, mainly the upper class, for their logical but callous approach to the poor. While poverty appears to be the obvious reason for his motivations, it seems he is also satirizing the current attitudes and viewpoints of the wealthy Irish citizens. He is able to use a combination of a reason-based approach and set a tone of humor and slight disgust to appeal to the patriots, the religious, the rich, the commoners, and the beggars of Ireland. Swift keeps the tone of the paper formal and logical,…\n\n“Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody’s face but their own” (Swift). Beholders are intended, through guidance of satiric narrative, to recognize a sense of social injustice or political plights and that there are wrongs occurring that need to be fixed. In some satires, as in Swift’s own A Modest Proposal, the use of absurd, blatant exaggeration is intended to capture an idle audience’s attention regarding the social state of the poor. Yet even in such a direct satire, there exists another layer of meaning. In regards to A Modest Proposal, the interchange between the voice of the proposer and Swift’s voice introduces another medium of criticism, as well as the opportunity for readers to reflect on how…\n\nThe predominantly satirical writer, Jonathan Swift, wrote many pieces in response to other works of literature. During the enlightenment period, Swift wrote an essay titled “A Modest Proposal” as a response to enlightened thinkers. Jonathan Swift took the enlightened, everything should have reasoning, way of thinking and wrote a work of satire resulting in “A Modest Proposal.” The setting was in Ireland where areas were overpopulating and women could not afford to care for their children, which resulted in the women becoming beggars. Jonathan Swift took this situation to create his work of satire from the point of view of an enlightened thinker.…\n\nSatire is a genre in literature while sometimes could be graphic and performing arts. Usually, satire is a comical piece of writing which authors would use humor, irony, exaggeration or ridicule makes fun of an individual or a society to expose its stupidity and shortcomings in an indirect way. And its essential purpose is to put out constructive social criticism which uses wit as a weapon to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. Moreover, writers expect that whom he criticizes for would improve and overcome the weakness. And fictional character is which stands for real people to expose and condemn their corruption in satire texts.…\n\nSatire is used in literature to criticize and point out society’s flaws. The criticism is usually masked in humour. Irony is commonly used in satires to expose flaws, an effective example is John Smith’s A Modest Proposal, in this essay he effectively uses irony, to communicate his argument about the poverty in Ireland. Similarly, in Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale she criticizes the society that women live in. Atwood uses satire to display the oppression of women in political, religious and social aspects through the use of allusions to the Cultural Revolution, Salem Witch Trials, the Taliban and the Old Testament.…\n\n“ “Those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery…” Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.” Mollie represents the Russian middle class, consisting of people who were acquisitive, didn’t want to give up their luxuries, and didn’t care for the revolution. This demonstrates satire because it mocks the middle class of Russia, saying that the bourgeois were selfish and materialistic. Another humor tool is a hyperbole, which exaggerates something to make it seem better or worse.…\n\nA Critical Analysis of Irony in “A Modest Proposal” by Jonathan Swift Jonathan Swift was an Anglo-Irish essayist, political pamphleteer, satirist and poet. He wrote numerous works, many of which dealt with Irish/British political tensions and religious issues. He was known as a Dublin’s foremost citizen until his death. His best known works include “Gulliver 's Travels” (1726) and “A Modest Proposal” (1729).…"
