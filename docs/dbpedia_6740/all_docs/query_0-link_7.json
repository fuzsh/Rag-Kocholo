        "text": "1914-1997\n\n\"Language is a virus from outer space.\"\n\nBirthplace\n\nSt Louis, Missouri, US\n\nEducation\n\nHarvard, US\n\nOther jobs\n\nParental support allowed him to avoid the daylight world of work, though at one point he set up as a Texas farmer, growing oranges, cotton and marijuana.\n\nDid you know?\n\nHe has loomed large in popular culture, naming a musical genre - heavy metal - and in 1993 modelling for Gap.\n\nCritical verdict\n\nAlways assured of adolescent adulation, from Naked Lunch on (\"strident and illiterate to its heart of pulp\"), critical reaction has been sharply divided - though his surprising endurance was proof that if you last long enough, the establishment develops an affection for you. The cut-up technique can make mid-period Burroughs taste over-chewed (if you've read Naked Lunch, then you've read The Soft Machine), but his last major work, the 80s Western Lands trilogy, was praised for its new discipline and narrative accessibility (while still including plenty of homoerotic cowboys, Egyptian gods and putrefying giant insects).\n\nRecommended works\n\nJunky and Queer have a raw power; The Western Lands is his most achieved work.\n\nInfluences\n\nJonathan Swift, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac\n\nNow read on\n\nTrack down JG Ballard's Atrocity Exhibition, with a preface by Burroughs. As the ultimate rebel, Burroughs was the god of rock gods from Patti Smith to Kurt Cobain, and his bitterly laconic spoken-word recordings are worth a listen.\n\nAdaptations\n\nDavid Cronenberg's Naked Lunch purported to film the unfilmable, but was forced in its search for plot to turn to the author's life story.\n\nRecommended biography\n\nLiterary Outlaw: The Life and Times of William S. Burroughs by Ted Morgan is compulsive and well-researched; Burroughs's Letters are in the pipeline.\n\nCriticism\n\nThe Adding Machine, an essay collection, is a cogent introduction to Burroughs's thought.\n\nWork online\n\nÂ· 'Letter from a Master Addict'\n\nBurroughs writes to the British Journal of Addiction, 1956"
