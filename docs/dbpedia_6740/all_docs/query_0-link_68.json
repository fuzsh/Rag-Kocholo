        "text": "NAKED LUNCH 50th Anniversary Edition\n\nby William S. Burroughs,\n\nEdited by James Grauerholz and Barry Miles\n\nGrove Press, 299pp, $30.50\n\n***\n\nNaked Lunch, published in Paris in 1959, was initially greeted by a prudish display of purse-lipped indignation. Then amidst a rising tide of acclaim, William S. Burroughs's druggy anti-novel was translated into a dozen languages and eventually sold a million copies worldwide.\n\nBefore he died at 83 in 1997, Burroughs did Nike commercials, plaques were erected in front of the houses where he once lived, and entire online \"communities\" were devoted to his work. Now generally considered a classic, his most famous novel has influenced everybody from J. G. Ballard, Hunter S. Thompson and William Gibson, to Barbara Gowdy, not to mention the jazz rock band Steely Dan, named after the dildo that stars in one of Burroughs's more pornographic fantasies.\n\nAt the time of its publication, Naked Lunch was revolutionary and audacious. It was the last great work of the modernist avant-garde that began with Joyce and Eliot and it was also a pioneering work of frankness on matters sexual, especially of the gay variety. It also was, as Mary McCarthy pointed out, the first global novel, boldly exploring the planet from New York to Morocco to the Upper Amazon to Scandinavia.\n\nIn ways more than geographic, it also set an exhilarating standard for high literary bravery and adventurousness. Naked Lunch was the naked truth, and Burroughs, scion of a distinguished family, was the original American psycho, daring to view life under the most unsparing of operating room lights. Consequently, it's never been a book for the squeamish, nor do most women like it much. With its catalogue of human sacrifice and forcible sodomy, obsessed with the orgasm of the hanged man, unwatered by the quality of mercy, it remains nothing less than a encyclopedia of the monstrous and nightmarish.\n\nBurroughs's American aristocrat's sense of entitlement, combined with a pervasive feeling of social rejection as a homosexual, resulted in his being possessed by gusts of murderous hate, which he dubbed \"the ugly spirit.\" Accordingly, he writes as a connoisseur of horror, in love with plagues, disasters, shipwrecks, riots, a zealous promoter of chaos and disruption. For diabolic Willy Lee Burroughs, the nighttime is always the right time.\n\nReread in our current climate of cozy bourgeois domestic fiction, Burroughs's sociopathic desire to rip the joint, even though conceived in response to the repressive McCarthy period, has produced a work that retains all of its power to make you laugh out loud, even if some of his \"routines,\" such as the famous Talking Asshole, now bear the stamp of the Golden Oldie.\n\nAs well as everything else, Naked Lunch is still the most original political satire since Jonathan Swift and Gulliver's Travels. When the book first appeared, Terry Southern called it an \"absolutely devastating ridicule of all that is false, vicious, and primitive in American life.\" Considering some of Burroughs's more cracker-barrel characters, such as The County Clerk, of Pigeon Hole, Texas, you feel that Burroughs has invented the likes of Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck from beyond the grave, along with giant interstellar insects.\n\nNaked Lunch is prescient in much else. Fifty years ago, Burroughs predicted the worldwide spread of what he was pleased to call \"the narcotics industry.\" Writing his novel in Tangiers in the mid-fifties, Burroughs remarked on the similarity between fundamentalist Muslims and Americans. He observed the \"continual crises of fear and rage\" on both sides. The suicide bomber in Yemen who concealed an IED up his posterior, where it was undetectable by airport security before it was detonated by cell phone, has walked right out of the pages of Burroughs's novel. (Goddamn it, Al, intestines everywhere.)\n\nNaked Lunch is written in a remarkable charged prose that lunges like a live wire, ready to shoot off sparks of poetic imagery in a deliberately fractured syntax. \"Mel the waiter,\" he writes, \"overdose after a cure, turning blue around the lips under the neon lights in a cheap hotel, flash on and off and the dropper hanging to his arm full of blood like a glass leech...\" It's a style so hard-boiled as to make Raymond Chandler seem effete.\n\nYet, with its melancholy imagery of deserted city streets à la Eliot, Burroughs's fiction is delicately poetic. The prose rhythms of Naked Lunch have a metallic hard bop syncopation - note the unusual placement of the phrase \"flash on and off.\" Taken together with his constant use of the historical present, à la Damon Runyon, Burroughs's utterly distinctive voice marries technological metaphor with the underworld slang of the 1920s and 1930s. He adopts the argot of the carny, the small-time vaudevillian, the grifter, the petty thief, already dated when Burroughs picked up on it when he dealt heroin in the Times Square area of New York in the 1940s. And there's nobody as hard-boiled as a drug dealer or a male hustler. (\"Think I'm innarested to contact your horrible old condition? I'm not at all innarested.\")\n\nWhen Burroughs wrote about heroin in Naked Lunch, it was part of his notably tongue-in-cheek self-image as an exotic immoralist in the line of Baudelaire and Oscar Wilde, the \"brilliant young decadent novelist who lives in a re-modelled pissoir in the native quarter.\" Fifty years on, drug use is drearily commonplace, about as exotic as the pimply kid next door.\n\nAll the same, Master Addict though he undoubtedly was, Burroughs might have been the greatest narc who ever lived, so thorough is his knowledge of both drugs and the drug trade. Not only had he read most of English and French literature when he came to write his novel, he had also studied anthropology and medicine. He sifts through both addicts and their drugs with a steely scientific detachment.\n\nSmall wonder that Marshall McLuhan found him a kindred soul; Burroughs had none of the usual literary humanist's antipathy to science and technology. After all, as is well known, Burroughs's grandfather invented the adding machine, founding the company that bears his name. Less well known is the fact that his uncle, Ivy Lee, was an illustrious pioneer of PR, burnishing the public image of John D. Rockefeller. The mad scientist of literature, Burroughs merely put these distinguished antecedents to wildly subversive use in his fiction. His motto: Write it and it happens.\n\nNobody in his right mind would venture into the nightmare of drug addiction after a reading of Naked Lunch. Nonetheless, Burroughs, with his madly innovative approach, in this book transformed the image of drug use from something shabby, seedy and down-at-heel, to that of a serious-minded and adventurous pursuit and thus made it respectable amongst young people. And, despite all the fatuous Wars on Drugs, that's a rumble nobody can cool.\n\nExistence itself, as defined by Burroughs, is infinitely fluid. The categories are always mixed. The identity of both individuals and their societies are never stable. After all, the decadent master addict of Naked Lunch, in his last notebook entries, written shortly before he died, spoke of \"love love love\" like a blushing schoolgirl.\n\nAt high school in north Toronto, a few years after its publication, Naked Lunch created a lot of rolling-around-on-the floor laughter among my crowd of aspiring hipsters. One girl's mother was sufficiently scandalized by the salty language in the book that she called in the cops. A few years later, Burroughs's junkie surgeons such as Dr. \"Fingers\" Schafer, The Lobotomy Kid, heavily influenced the twin drug-addicted gynecologists portrayed by Jeremy Irons in the film I wrote with David Cronenberg, Dead Ringers.\n\nI met ol' Willy Lee hisself when he was on the set of Cronenberg's subsequent adaptation of his most famous novel. Dead Ringers won plenty of awards but nothing was as sweet as the praise, delivered in surprisingly headmasterish fashion, from the author of Naked Lunch.\n\nNorman Snider's darkly humorous political satire Casino Jack, starring Kevin Spacey and Kelly Preston was filmed this summer."
