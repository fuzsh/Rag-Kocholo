        "text": "1914 William Seward Burroughs II was born on 5.2.1914 in St. Louis, Missouri. His father, Mortimer Burroughs, was the son of William Burroughs I, an inventor, who perfected the mechanism of the calculator in the 1880’s and founded the international firm, Burroughs. 1927 He devoured the book, You Can’t Win by Jack Black, the memoirs of a professional thief and opium smoker, whose scenery and personages exerted a powerful influence on the 13-year-old. It would provide the model for Burroughs’ first novel, Junky. Attempts in writing. Burroughs feels to be an outsider and becomes aware of his homoerotic affinities. 1930 – 1931 William S. Burroughs’ parents sent him to the expensive boarding school, “Los Alamos” in New Mexico. The Los Alamos Ranch School was closed in February 1943, making room for the test ground of the “Manhattan Project”, the development of the first atom bomb by J. R. Oppenheimer. 1932 – 1936 William S. Burroughs was studying English literature at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In George Lyman Kittredge’s courses on Shakespeare, he learned entire passages by heart. 1936 – 1937 Burroughs went to Vienna and enrolled to study medicine at the university. In Dubrovnik he became friends with Ilse Klapper, a Jewish woman, who had fled the Nazis in Hamburg. When he went back to Dubrovnik, he decided to marry Ilse Klapper, in order to enable her to immigrate to the USA. The marriage took place in Athens and was dissolved a few years later in the U.S. 1938 With his boyhood friend, Kells Elvins, Burroughs moved into a small house in Cambridge, Massachusetts and signed up for courses on Navajo language and Mayan archeology. Together Burroughs and Elvins wrote the story, Twilight’s Last Gleaming, the depiction of a catastrophe at sea modeled on the Titanic and the Morro Castle. As a consequence, Burrough’s writer’s block, which had lasted for years, came to an end. 1939 In August, Burroughs went to Chicago and signed up for five lectures by Graf Alfred Korzybski, the author of the Theory of General Semantics. Burroughs went back to New York and met Jack Anderson there, with whom he began a sexual relationship. In despair at Anderson’s coldness and infidelity, Burroughs cut off the end of his little finger on his left hand with poultry shears. That led to his psychiatrist persuading him to have himself admitted to the Bellevue psychiatric clinic. 1942 – 1943 Burroughs lived in a pension in the run-down district of Chicago North Side. Here he found the milieu of Jack Black’s You Can’t Win. He found a job as an exterminator with A. J. Cohen Exterminators. Two friends from St Louis arrived in Chicago: Lucien Carr and David Kammerer. 1943 Carr shifted in the spring to Columbia University in New York, and Kammerer and Burroughs followed him. Lucien Carr met Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. He introduced his two new friends to Burroughs and Kammerer. Kerouac moved into the flat of his girlfriend, Edie Parker and Joan Vollmer. The flat became the focus of the newly formed circle of friends. The trio of Burroughs, Ginsberg and Kerouac was to form the heart of the literary Beat Movement. 1944 Carr stabbed his admirer, Kammerer, and confessed to Burroughs and Kerouac. Kerouac and Burroughs were arrested temporarily because they had not reported the murder. They processed the act in the jointly composed novel And the Hippos Were Boiled in their Tanks. The book was published after Carr’s death in 2008. 1945 On 6 August, the U.S. dropped the atom bomb, “Little Boy” on Hiroshima, followed by “Fat Boy” on Nagasaki on 9 August.
