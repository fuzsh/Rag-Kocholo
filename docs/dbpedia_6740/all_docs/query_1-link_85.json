        "text": "By Steve Finbow.\n\nAudrey Szasz, Zealous Immaculate, (Amphetamine Sulphate, 2022).\n\nLet me start this at a tangent. A few weeks ago, I stated that I planned to take a break from editing my new book set in Quattrocento Florence and spend a month reading for pleasure rather than reading for research purposes. The first book I would read would be Geoff Dyer’s The Last Days of Roger Federer: And Other Endings and declared myself a fan of Dyer’s previous work but that I disliked his novels and did not read much fiction these days. I do not think the novel is a redundant form and I know from experience how difficult they are to construct – and I use that phrase rather than “to write”. Short stories, in comparison, are like finely honed dugout canoes (monoxylons / einbaums – one tree), compared to the Harland & Wolff frame benders, gantry cranes, scaffolding and riveting required for a novel.\n\nSo, after that tangential opening, let me flipflop and state that I have read a few novels over the past couple of years and some of the most interesting have been by New Juche and Audrey Szasz. In 2021, after reading Szasz’s Tears of a Komsomol Girl (Infinity Land Press, 2020), I wrote that I thought it, “an oneiric masterpiece of dissimulation in which, in her violent erotic dreams, a serial liar meets a serial killer. Szasz’s writing reads like controlled frenzy, a limpid prose which – antithetically – contains all of the darkness and monsters we refuse to acknowledge. We might even have a genius on our grubby hands.” So, no pressure.\n\nIn the opening pages of Zealous Immaculate, Szasz presents her character in first-person present tense – Tamara – a young girl in a children’s home – or, the Kafkaesque “The Children’s Home.” Tamara has a damaged left hand and is also unable to speak. Immediately, Szasz proclaims her Otherness – there is an institution, Tamara doesn’t know why she is there, she cannot communicate either by voice or by writing – if she could write, she would do so in a language no-one at the home could understand – and we are not sure if this language is cryptophasia or a cryptolect, or indeed an idio(t)lect – would anyone properly understand her (reader, society, therapist) even if she could speak and/or write? This is maximal Otherness, a detachment from the rules of the game, not only societal but literary. In Szasz’s world nothing is true but everything is permitted – sort of, kind of.\n\nSzasz provokes us with her language of repetition – sometimes reminiscent of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Samuel Beckett – of whose works she has probably read little or none of – but takes it further and creates a character and a style of writing that is not so much transgressive as an embodiment of alterity – alterity-lit, anyone? Her infrequent and yet fresh use of simile and metaphor reminds me of something David Mitchell – the author of Cloud Atlas, not the panel-show comedian – once told me about using one or less similes/metaphors per page and rigorously enforcing that rule.\n\nSzasz makes it clear from the start that we must not feel sympathy for Tamara – she is what she is and, in a writerly way, also says “Fuck you” to any reader that would like a bit of coddling, a bit of cuddling – hands off, focus, concentrate! “I’m not in pain – I’m just bored – I don’t care about your grief – I don’t care about your suffering – I don’t care about anyone.” This is somewhat new and you’ve probably not read anything like this before, so strap yourself in, this is going to be one helluva ride.\n\nWhat follows are tales of child abuse and need, desire and power, the Stockholm syndrome, of puberty and grooming, of bodily discovery and mucal dread, of absence and longing, of a language omnipresent because of its absence. Tamara’s muteness intensifies her ability to self-communicate, to invent a monologue which attempts to analyse as it flees, desires to understand as it retreats, endeavours to map the world it is enclosed within without ever seeing the territory.\n\nThe figures of power are represented by capitalized occupations – the Director, the Caretaker, the Nurse, the Guard, the Doctor – as if doing were the existential evidence of existence; whereas Tamara – if that is her name – is concentrated on being in whatever degraded essence of the Other. Yet in conjunction with her masochistic submission comes power, the power of the imagination – and Szasz’s imagination is extraordinarily vivid in fantasy and in detail and in dissimulation and escamotage.\n\nWhat Tamara is looking for is home, not the Home, and her use of cliched phrases grasps for the knowable within the abject, some kind of hope, some kind of saviour; familiar phrases offer normality but they are always cruelly snatched away, the uncanny takes control, the desire turns into perversity, the hope to pain, “The mystery solved. Sliding into place. The glass slipper. The glass house. The crystal castle. The castle in the sky. The sky on fire. Baby my hearts on fire. Oh baby when you kiss me. It’s like I’m fully in love. It feels like it – it feels like I’m in love. Love me tender. Fucking skewer me.”\n\nJulia Kristeva argues:\n\nThe abject is related to perversion. The sense of abjection that I experience is anchored in the superego. The abject is perverse because it neither gives up nor assumes a prohibition, a rule, or a law; but turns them aside, misleads, corrupts; uses them, takes advantage of them, the better to deny them. It kills in the name of life – a progressive despot; it lives at the behest of death – an operator in genetic experimentations; it curbs the other’s suffering for its own profit – a cynic (and a psychoanalyst); it establishes narcissistic power while pretending to reveal the abyss.\n\nNarcissism, one of the foundations of all art and of all artists, makes us at once victim and predator – roles are reversed and swapped – the passive and the active blur, the modes of longing and dread merge. Tamara constantly professes her normality while manifesting her Otherness, as if her self were caught between enjoying her suffering and struggling for some higher state that she can only apprehend in the suffering of others. Like the written page, Tamara constantly stares into herself as it/she evolves – but as she has to write with her right hand (her wrong hand), the writing and the self develop perversely, what is normal becomes pathological becomes normal eternally in some vibrating glitched image of what it is to be alive – Tamara feels things most people would not want to experience, Szasz writes about subjects most people would find uncomfortable and locks the reader in an eternal recurrence of lust and shame, inclusion and exclusion.\n\nAll of Szasz’s work so far – Plan for the Abduction of J.G. Ballard co-written with Jeremy Reed (Infinity Land Press, 2019), Invisibility: A Manifesto (Amphetamine Sulphate, 2020), Tears of a Komsomol Girl and her various published shorter works, deal with the non-normative. Why is that? I think Georges Canguilhem has a theory,\n\nThis point of view is that of vital normativity. Even for an amoeba, living means preference and exclusion. A digestive tract, sexual organs, constitute an organism’s behavioural norms. Psychoanalytic language is indeed right to give the name poles to the natural orifices of ingestion and excretion. A function does not work indifferently in several directions. A need places the proposed objects of satisfaction in relation to propulsion and repulsion. There is a dynamic polarity of life. As long as the morphological or functional variations on the specific type do not hinder or subvert this polarity, the anomaly is a tolerated fact; in the opposite case the anomaly is felt as having negative vital value and is expressed as such on the outside. Because there are anomalies which are experienced or revealed as an organic disease, there exists first an affective and then a theoretical interest in them. It is because the anomaly has become pathological that it stimulates scientific study.\n\nAnd if we replace “scientific study” with “literary imagination”, we get somewhat close to Szasz’s subject matters and her reinvigorative reanimation of sadism and masochism, of inward terror and institutionalized horror. “Internal systems, self-control, attended to and properly ordered, the best sex of my life, in the role of step-daughter, pupil, student, slave, or employee – let it stay forever now – cuffs and shoulders, elegant grandeur, my youth drained or deposited with ironic charm – time or money spent between lethargy and apathy – and I sometimes work up the energy to really start hating myself – somebody please lend me a fully loaded pistol so I can blow my brains out, preferably in public.”\n\nSzasz’s work is a form of confrontation – it challenges our ideas of love, of care, of family, of bodies, of sex, of dependency, of desire; it is as much in your face as it is visceral and genital, it dares you to turn the page, to bear witness. Kristeva again,\n\nContemporary literature… seems to be written out of the untenable aspects of perverse or superego positions. It acknowledges the impossibility of Religion, Morality, and Law – their power play, their necessary and absurd seeming. Like perversion, it takes advantage of them, gets round them, and makes sport of them. Nevertheless, it maintains a distance where the abject is concerned. The writer, fascinated by the abject, imagines its logic, projects himself (herself) into it, introjects it, and as a consequence perverts language – style and content. But on the other hand, as the sense of abjection is both the abject’s judge and accomplice, this is also true of the literature that confronts it. One might thus say that with such a literature there takes place a crossing over of the dichotomous categories of Pure and Impure, Prohibition and Sin, Morality and Immorality.\n\nThe sense of alterity also emanates from the unnamed location of the narrative – like Robbe-Grillet’s In the Labyrinth, Kazuo Ishiguro’s under-appreciated The Unconsoled and Han Kang’s The White Book, the loci intensifies the feeling of the uncanny and the Other. Without a name, nothing can be fixed, nothing can be permanent – like Tamara, the narrative is an inchoate swirling mass of longing and desire in which any permanent happiness, any fixity and haecceity is sublimated and reinvented. “We are foreigners in a not-so-strange land – eerily familiar – ornery – some looking-glass realm – defectors glimpsed momentarily through a glacial chasm – cut adrift in my own thoughts, I dissociate, assess my options, mechanically, methodically. Emotions suppressed – I cannot afford to be enveloped by sensations of disgust – or hateful romance – or dare I say it, stilted limerence?” As there are no geographical points, the narrative – although driven and dynamic – refuses to be pinned down, rejects the device of plot and spins in its own linguistic vacuum. Although I have named a number of authors, it is hard to determine Szasz’s predecessors. There is no anxiety of influence here but an anxiety of creativity, a nervous energy that erupts in a scintillating prose, even when she is writing about the banal and of being bored and splendidly but duplicitously indifferent.\n\nIn a similar way to all good Menippean satirists – Jonathan Swift, Nikolai Gogol, Mikhail Bulgakov, Vladimir Nabokov and William S. Burroughs – Szasz is a moralist, skewering and nipple-clamping our lazy attitudes to society, sex, family, human rights – and like the above writers, she is also very funny, even in the darkest sections of the novel,\n\n“My name is Minnie Mouse. I squeak incessantly like a little rodent. God told me to gas you then skin your corpse. Your skin so soft, so luxurious. I’d look good as a lampshade. Light of my life. Fire in my groin. Put it inside me. I want to feel it. I need to lose gracefully, like a good sport. I need to step aside. I need a pump-action shotgun and a shopping mall full of unwilling victims. I need a shot of rhythm and blues. Just give me some of that rock and roll music, any old way you choose it. If you wanna dance with me. Takes two to tango. Takes one to know one. One of a kind. One in a million. A million mouths sucking your tits. A thousand fingers flicking my switch. Milk it. By it. Love it. Own it. Bought and sold. Used and abused.”\n\nThis is what Menippean satirists do best, the shifting from high to low culture, from high to low registers, a transience of styles, an exploration of her own personal Gehinnom.\n\nThe obvious example of this is Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland in which Alice’s curiosity is the cause of her adventures, whereas Tamara’s plight seems to stem from prevarication and an oscillating on/off switch of desire and indifference,\n\n“Curiously, there is a hole in the floor, just a hole, with no railing around it at all, just a hole. For some reason it reminds me of a hole for a fireman, the kind you see on the upper floor of a fire station, but without the fireman’s pole, just a spiral staircase going down to the lower levels. I follow behind the man and the woman. They both seem tall, statuesque. I go down with them through the hole in the floor. We go down the steps, around and around. Then we reach a different level. On this level everything is clean and organised. I do not know where I am. I’m in front of a door. Just a regular door. The door opens. The man and the woman usher inside. It is a dark, narrow room. Opposite the door the entire wall is just a big pane of glass like a shop window. There is a pink fluorescent light above the window. I know that I am sixteen years old. I am wearing my sailor dress. My hair is styled in neat plaits, but for some unknown and inexplicable reason it is completely blonde. How did they do this to me? I am confused when the woman coats my lips in a layer of red lipstick and motions for me to sit on a little bed next to the window. “\n\nLet’s return to Kristeva for further analysis,\n\n“We may call it a border; abjection is above all ambiguity. Because, while releasing a hold, it does not radically cut off the subject from what threatens it – on the contrary, abjection acknowledges it to be in perpetual danger. But also because abjection itself is a composite of judgment and affect, of condemnation and yearning, of signs and drives. Abjection preserves what existed in the archaism of pre-objectal relationship, in the immemorial violence with which a body becomes separated from another body in order to be – maintaining that night in which the outline of the signified thing vanishes and where only the imponderable affect is carried out. To be sure, if I am affected by what does not yet appear to me as a thing, it is because laws, connections, and even structures of meaning govern and condition me. That order, that glance, that voice, that gesture, which enact the law for my frightened body, constitute and bring about an effect and not yet a sign. I speak to it in vain in order to exclude it from what will no longer be, for myself, a world that can be assimilated. Obviously, I am only like someone else: mimetic logic of the advent of the ego, objects, and signs. But when I seek (myself), lose (myself), or experience jouissance – then “I” is heterogeneous. Discomfort, unease, dizziness stemming from an ambiguity that, through the violence of a revolt against, demarcates a space out of which signs and objects arise. Thus braided, woven, ambivalent, heterogeneous flux marks out a territory that I can call my own because the Other, having dwelt in me as alter ego, points it out to me through loathing.”\n\nThe reverse of an artist’s narcissism is self-loathing, of crippling doubt and Szasz somehow creates a narrative and a prose style that balances these two opposing forces – as I wrote earlier, it is a literature of confrontation and alterity and yet also of caring and the gift, of the truth and of unreliability, it wants so much to have you understand yet hates you for attempting any kind of empathy, it wants you, it hates you, come here, now fuck off,\n\n“I get off on this. You say you want love. You’re looking for love. Whatever that is. But I just want to hurt you. That’s what I get off on. I wanted to see you suffer. I wanted to brutalise you. I wanted to own you completely. And it was too easy. You surrendered too quickly. Maybe if you’d shown some restraint I could have respected you. But that’s never going to happen. I wanted to keep you for myself. I wanted to just own you, and play with you, toy with you. And now I do. Sometimes I would actually like to kill you, repeatedly if it were possible. If I couldn’t have you, then I probably would kill you. But I have got you. That’s the difference. I’ve got you but you’ll never have me. And you know as well as I do that this is forever. You’re going nowhere.”\n\nIn Cut Piece – first performed in Kyoto, Japan, in 1964 – Yoko Ono sat on a stage fully dressed while members of the audience were given scissors and invited to cut away her clothes until she was naked. Ono sat impassive throughout the event. Szasz’s writing (her writing is extremely performative) is a kind of Auto-Cut Piece, in which she lacerates her own psyche and fantasies until she – or at least her characters – are left bare and raw for all of us to witness; as Marcia Tanner wrote in Bad Girls about Ono’s participation piece, it feels “more like a rape than an art performance.”\n\nThere is another artist who comes to mind when reading Szasz and that is Sarah Lucas – someone Szasz has probably never heard of. There is an overlapping of humour and humiliation, eroticism and disgust, social satire and self-revelation, the absurdity and exploitation of the male gaze on and of female human anatomy, the bravery to push art (writing) to the furthest boundaries of convention and taste and to do so with humour and defiance.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR"
