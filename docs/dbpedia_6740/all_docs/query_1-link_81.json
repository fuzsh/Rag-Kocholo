        "text": "Jack Kerouac (Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac) was born in Lowell, Massachusetts on March 12, 1922. His father, Leo Alcide Kerouac was a job printer. His mother, Gabrielle Ange Kerouac (nee Levesque) was a shoe-factory worker. Both parents were French-Canadian, and Jack Kerouac grew up in a predominantly Roman Catholic, French-Canadian community in Lowell. He was recognized as an outstanding athlete, and won a football scholarship to Columbia University. Prior to attending Columbia he spent a preparatory year at Horace Mann School for Boys, where he wrote for school publications. He became determined to be a major American writer during his high school years; the early materials in his Archive reflect this youthful determination.\n\nKerouac entered Columbia in 1940 but after breaking his leg during his first football season his academic interest declined, and he spent his time on independent reading, including the work of Thomas Wolfe, whose work exerted an influence on Kerouac's writing for many years afterwards. He left Columbia during the fall of his sophomore year in 1941, and spent the following years working at a variety of odd jobs. After nearly two years in the merchant marine he enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943 but was released from duty after six months for psychological reasons, honorably discharged as an \"indifferent character.\" He spent the remainder of World War II in the merchant marine.\n\nDuring this period, when in New York, he associated with a bohemian group of students around the Columbia campus. This group included Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs. Both appear, thinly-disguised, in several of Kerouac's novels, and he would later give each writer the title for their best-known works -- \"Howl\" and \"Naked Lunch.\"\n\nAfter marrying Edith Parker in 1944 he embarked upon a series of cross-country journeys, moving continuously between New York, Denver, San Francisco, Mexico City, and back to New York. These travels became the basis of his novel \"On The Road.\" Kerouac traveled extensively with Neal Cassady, an inspiring, charismatic drifter from Denver with whom he shared a hunger for philosophy, theology, literature, sex, drugs, sensation and salvation. His marriage to Edith Parker was annulled in 1945.\n\nHis father's death, in 1946, spurred him to begin writing the novel published in 1950 as \"The Town and the City,\" a minor critical but not financial success. With the advance for \"The Town and the City\" Kerouac was able to move himself, and his mother, to Colorado, where he began to formulate the narrative that would eventually become \"On The Road.\"\n\nAfter the advance money ran out he returned to New York and, between 1948 and 1949, enrolled at the New School for Social Research, where he attended Alfred Kazin's classes on the visionary poet William Blake. Kerouac married Joan Haverty in November 1950. The following year, inspired by reading a 23,000 word letter from Neal Cassady, he spent three-weeks typing the 175,000 word first draft of \"On The Road\" on a constructed paper scroll. The completion of this draft coincided with the demise of his second marriage.\n\n\"On The Road\" was published in 1957; its publication was hailed by Gilbert Millstein, reviewing it for The New York Times, as \"a historic occasion.\" Millstein was unequivocal in his praise of the novel, regarding it as \"the most beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'beat' and whose principal avatar he is.\"\n\nDeveloping and refining his style, which he called \"Spontaneous Prose,\" Kerouac produced eight more books over the next few years, as publishers capitalized on the attention generated by the publication of \"On The Road.\" He wrote \"The Subterraneans\" in three Benzedrine-fuelled days of manic writing in 1957.\n\nKerouac was the first of the beat writers to look to Buddhism and the East for inspiration, calling himself \"a religious wanderer\" or \"dharma bum.\" He became, however, increasingly alienated from his fans in the 1960s, bewildered by the radical politics of the new counter-cultural currents that he had played a large part in setting in motion. He continued to drink heavily, shunned literary society, and withdrew to St. Petersburg, Florida, or his home-town of Lowell, where he lived with his ailing mother and his third wife, Stella, whom he married in 1966.\n\nHe died on October 21, 1969, as a result of complications brought on by alcoholism.\n\nChronology\n\nBorn in Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nLeo Kerouac takes his son to Rockingham Park to see his first horse race.

The Archive was delivered to the Berg Collection shortly thereafter. Because the archive was unprocessed and because the Library was contractually obligated to prevent copying, in its broadest definition, of the archive's contents, until 2006, or until the appearance of the estate-authorized biography of Kerouac -- whichever came first -- access to the archive was forbidden, except to those given permission by the estate for the purpose of fulfilling prior publication obligations, in concert with the estate. However, the Library was contractually permitted to display material from the archive in exhibitions and presentations, and material was so displayed by the Berg Curator in this manner, most significantly in the exhibition \"Victorians, Moderns, and Beats: New in the Berg, 1994-2001\" (displayed April 26-July 27, 2002); also, \"Passion's Discipline: The History of the Sonnet in the British Isles and America\" (displayed May 2-August 2, 2003) contained the draft of a Kerouac sonnet.\n\nPrior to the archive's purchase, beginning in the late 1980s, the Berg regularly purchased or, occasionally, received as gifts, a variety of Kerouac papers, including manuscripts, typescripts, notebooks, journals, diaries, correspondence (both by and to Kerouac), and photographs. Many of these items were cataloged; their descriptions, present in the card catalog, may now also be accessed on the Berg website, or through CATNYP, under the title \"Jack Kerouac Collection of Papers, 1942-1969.\" (The Kerouac Archive proper, for which this finding aid was produced, is titled \"Jack Kerouac Papers.\") Many more items that were purchased or received as gifts remained uncataloged and were placed in the Berg's backlog, which was accessed via an in-house database, the contents of which were made available to researchers. Researchers were made aware of the existence of Kerouac material in the backlog through interactions with Berg staff in the reading room, through off-site reference exchanges, and through the \"Recently Acquired and Cataloged\" link on the Berg's website.\n\nThe backlog Kerouac papers included, most notably: 4 autograph notebooks for Maggie Cassidy; 11 autograph notebooks for Some of the Dharma; 3 autograph spiral notebooks for Satori in Paris; 15 autograph notebooks of literary sketches; autograph notebook for Tics; autograph notebook for Daydreams; 6 autograph notebooks for Mexico City Blues; 10 autograph notebooks for Passing Through; 11 notebooks for Book of Dreams; typescript for Book of Dreams; manuscripts/typescripts of about a dozen poems; over 100 autograph letters (and about 20 typed letters) signed by Kerouac. Researchers should also be advised that the Berg has comprehensive collection of Kerouac imprints, many of which feature significant inscriptions by the author, as well as journals, anthologies, broadsides, and ephemera containing his writings.\n\nIn addition, the Berg contains other significant Beat holdings, most notably the William S. Burroughs Archive, but also, primarily in its backlog at present, papers of important Beat writers, such as Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and Philip Whalen, as well as an extensive collection of Beat publications by these authors, including broadsides, pamphlets, journals, and ephemera.\n\nThe processing of the Jack Kerouac Archive was made possible, in part, through the generous assistance of the Gladys Kreible Delmas Foundation."
