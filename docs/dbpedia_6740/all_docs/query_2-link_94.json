You take your dad's army uniform and your mom's Easter hat and your brother's motorcycle and your sister's purse and stitch them all together and try to make something meaningful out of it.\"\n\nTom Waits (1973): \"I listen to AM radio a lot cause I don't have an FM, I listen to Ray Charles, got a lot of old Ray Charles records, let's see - Diana Ross [laughs] - I like her a lot, got some old Billie Holliday records, I listen to her, and Mose Allison, I'm real fond of Mose Allison, Dale Evans, Miles Davis, a little bit of everything. I try to integrate different styles in my writing, it's important to do that. With a piano it's easier for me to write, I can find a lot more things that I could never find on guitar so it helps with writing on the piano. I played guitar before I played piano, I'm no technician, no big fancy fingers.\" (Source: Folkscene 1973, with Howard and Roz Larman (KPFK-FM 90.7). Date: Los Angeles/ USA. August 12, 1973)\n\nQ (1973): Did you always want to be a musician? TW: \"Yeah, I guess so, I couldn't think of anything else I really wanted to be, seems to be today nobody wants to be anything but, nobody wants to be a baseball player anymore or anything - everybody wants to be a rock n roll star. I was always real interested in music, it never really struck me to write until I guess about the late 60's, about '68 or '69 I started writing, up until then I just listened to a lot of music, played in school orchestras, played trumpet in elementary school, junior high, high school, went through all that and hung around with some friends of mine that played classical piano and picked up a few little licks here and there, played guitar and stumbled on the Heritage - and actually the first real songwriter I really saw and really got enthused about was Jack Tempchin and that was in about 1968 at the Candy Company on El Cajon Boulevard, he was playing on the bill with Lightning Hopkins and he was real casual and everything, it was just something I wanted to try my hand at, so I tried my hand at it, I don't know, I guess you get better as you go along, the more music you listen to and the more perceptive you become towards melody and lyric and all. The only place really to play in San Diego were folk clubs. I used to go to a lot of dances. I played in a band in junior high called The Systems... I played rhythm guitar and sang. I listened to a lot of black artists, quite a few black artists. I had a real interest in that - James Brown and the Flames were real big, I went to O'Farrell Junior High School, all black junior high school, and I went out to Balboa(?) and saw James Brown - he knocked me out, man, when I was in 7th grade. So I've kept up on that scene too and I listen to as many different kinds of music as I can.\" (Source: Folkscene 1973, with Howard and Roz Larman (KPFK-FM 90.7). Date: Los Angeles/ USA. August 12, 1973)\n\nTom Waits (1974): \"Various groups, mainly junior high, doing Surfaris, and Ventures, and Beach Boys, and that sort of thing. Nothing like what I'm trying to do now. Actually, the first songwriters on record, I guess, were James Brown and Ray Charles. The first album I ever bought was \"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\". I was going to Farrell Jr. High and James Brown was my idol at the time. But the first real songwriters I came into first-hand contact with were around San Diego. All local people at the Heritage and the Candy Company and the Back Door and eventually Jack Tempchin, Ray Bierl, and Ted Staak (credited by LC as being San Diego's first folk songwriter, now living a recluse in Oregon). There weren't that many, but the ones that were playing here were all worth listening to.\" (Source: \"From Bouncing To Hooting To Playing The Road\" San Diego's Weekly (USA) Vol. 3 No. 27.

TW: \"Well, I've read all of his work, actually I've discovered some magazine articles by him that are in some very colourful magazines like Rogue and Cad - magazines like that. he used to publish stories and there were a lot of articles written about him in those skin magazines. But I've read everything I can get my hands on by him.\" Interviewer - Any other writers? TW: \"Oh, yeah, Charles Bukowski is probably one of the most colourful and most important writers of modern fiction, poetry and prose, in contemporary literature right now. I'd say he's at the vanguard in my book, he just levels me, I've been reading Charles Bukowski.\" (Source: Folkscene 1974, with Howard and Roz Larman (KPFK-FM 90.7) Source: audio tape.

TW: \"Yeah, I listen to him and I like Mose Allison, I think he's a very economical songwriter with his - he's so damn stylized that you can't help but love him to death - he's like honey poured all over you - I admire him a great deal. I still listen to \"These Foolish Things Remind Me Of You\" - now was that George Gershwin or was that Cole Porter?

I soaked it in like a sponge. I sat on the door and I listened to as much as I possibly could and I don't know, right now, the songwriters that I admire - I admire Johnny Mercer, Oscar Hammerstein and George Gershwin - Cole Porter, Randy Newman - I don't know, I just don't listen to that much country music anymore.\" (Source: Folkscene 1975, with Howard and Roz Larman (KPFK-FM 90.7).

I still enjoy listening to him for what he had to offer. He was a real bebop prosody cat, certainly a real pioneer in the 50's along with Ken Nordine and Jack Kerouac, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso, all those cats. He did a lot of nightclub dates but for the most part he's not any sort of a household word now, He was kind of a ghost out of the 50's that kind of left before he arrived.\" (Source: WAMU Radio Interview.

I like Randy Newman a great deal, I like London Wainwright.\" (Source: WAMU Radio Interview. Date: Washington, DC. April 18, 1975)\n\nTom Waits (1975): \"Even though I was growing up in Southern California, he [Jack Kerouac] made a tremendous impression on me. It was 1968. I started wearing dark glasses and got myself a subscription to Downbeat ... I was a little late. Kerouac died in 1969 in St Petersburg, Florida, a bitter old man... I became curious about style more than anything else. I discovered Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti ... Ginsberg still comes up with something every now and again.\" (Source: \"Not so much a poet, more a purveyor of improvisational travelogue\". New Musical Express.

It's Jack Kerouac telling stories, with Steve Allen playing piano behind him. That album sort of sums up the whole thing. That's what gave me the idea to do some spoken pieces myself.\" (Source: \"Not so much a poet, more a purveyor of improvisational travelogue\". New Musical Express.

That makes me a little different, I guess. I love Nelson Algren's work, and I love Charles Bukowski, the poet. He has this new novel out, Factotum, and it's terrific. Talks about all the lousy jobs he had to take to be a poet. Lemme see. Oh yeah, I like Johnny Rechy: City of Night, Numbers and The Fourth Angel. Rechy is writing a script based on City of Night and I might get involved doing the music. He's another one who was never fairly appreciated.\" (Source: \"Play It Again Tom\".

I was listening to Lord Buckley and Lenny Bruce too.\" MH: You obviously didn't hear those guys on the radio. What did you listen to when you were growing up? TW: \"It was mostly the hit parade, that kind of stuff. There are a lot of composers I like: George and Ira Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer, bless his soul, Cole Porter... \" MH: That stamps you as somewhat of a trowback these days, more than a little out of sync with tha mainstream of the American music scene. TW: \"Well, I do like some of the current people. I like Martin Mull, Randy Newman... Another composer I like is Bob Dorough. He wrote Baltimore Oriole back in the '50s; nowadays he writes mostly for kid shows. The first time I got hip to him was on an album called Poetry And Jazz, John Carradine was on it reading some Dylan Thomas stuff. Dorough did a Ferlinghetti poem, something called A Dog, I think.\" (Source: \"Bitin' the green shiboda with Tom Waits\". \"Down Beat\" magazine. Marv Hohman. Chicago. June 17, 1976)\n\nTW (1976): \"Hey, did you ever read that Kerouac novel - it's out in Grove - called Pic? It was written about '56, published after he died, it was written like a Mark Twain story, all in phonetic black jargon.\" MH: What about Mexico City Blues? Do you know that? TW: \"Yeah, Kerouac had Charlie Parker in there, The Wheel Of The Quivering Meat Conception, a lot of real strange ones. I liked that a lot.\" (Source: \"Bitin' the green shiboda with Tom Waits\". \"Down Beat\" magazine. Marv Hohman. Chicago. June 17, 1976)\n\nMH (1976): Hohman: As far as pianists go, who do you listen to and admire? Waits: I like al Red Tyler, Huey Piano Smith, all of Art Tatum, Professor Longhair. I like Mose Allison a lot; we did a Soundstage show together a while back. What's Thelonious Monk doing now? The best thing he had out was called The Man I Love. The last time I saw him in San Diego, his son was playing drums. I certainly admire him. I love his private solo version of 'Round Midnight, the way it drags and pulls at your heartstrings. Al Cohn and Steve Gilmore played that one night in a storeroom of some club in New York, it just killed me, man. It's such a low, moanin' lonesome, real tragic style. As far as other musicians go, I like Charles Mingus, Tampa Red, Bo Carter, Memphis Minnie... I saw Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra at the Spectrum in Philadelpia a while back, Ella was amazing.

December 14, 1976)\n\nTom Waits (1976): \"I went to a predominantly black junior high school in San Diego, where the only music was black hit parade - James Brown, the Supremes, Wilson Pickett - but by then I'd had a lot of incongruous musical influences: jazz, Gershwin, Porter, Kern, Arlen, Carmichael, Mercer, Louis Armstrong, Stravinsky, Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt. During the height of rock and roll, I kept a low profile. I used to read Hubert Selby, Kerouac, Larry McMurtry, John Rechy, Nelson Algren. My reading now is mostly limited to menus and street signs. I liked comedians and storytellers: Wally Cox, Harry the Hipster, Rodney Dangerfield, Redd Foxx, Lord Buckley. I worked in a gas station, didn't do major repairs - Mrs. Ferguson would come in and want her tires rotated; kids want a dollar's worth; fill 'er up; ding, ding - and I worked in a jewelry store, drove delivery trucks, cabs, a Tropic ice-cream truck. Was a firefighter in a town near the Mexican border - brush fires, mostly. Drank coffee, played checkers, looked at Playboy, threw darts. Then I got a job as doorman at a night club in L.A. and I listened to all the acts from the door. I heard bluegrass, comics, folk singers, string bands. At the same time. I was picking up people's conversations in all-night coffee shops - ambulance drivers, cabdrivers, street sweepers. I did research there as an evening curator, and I started writing gingerly. I thought at some point I'd like to forge it all into something meaningful, and give it dignity.\" (Source: \"Blues\", The New Yorker. December 27, 1976 by James Stevenson)\n\nTW (1976): \"I wasn't thrilled by Blue Cheer, so I found an alternative, even if it was Bing Crosby\". \"I kept a pretty narrow scope on things,\" Waits says of those days. (Source: \"Smelling like a brewery, lookin' like a tramp\". Rolling Stone: David McGee. January, 1977)\n\nTW (1977): \"I listened to all kinds of music there. All kinds of stuff from rock to jazz to folk to anything else that happened to walk in. One night I saw a local guy onstage playing his own material. I don't know why, but at that moment I knew that I wanted to live or die on the strength of my own music. I finally played a gig there. Then I started writing down people's conversations as they sat around the bar. When I put them together I found some music hiding in there.\" (Source: \"Smelling like a brewery, lookin' like a tramp\". Rolling Stone: David McGee. January, 1977)\n\nTW (1977): \"I'm learning about stuff, too. Through the songs I'm writing now I'm changing my attitude towards things. I'm becoming a little more shrewd, a little more ...\" DG: Cynical? TW: \"Yeah. I don't take things at face value like I used to. So I dispelled some things in these songs that I had substantiated before. I'm trying to show something to myself, plus get some things off my chest.

Rolling Stone: David McGee. January, 1977)\n\nTW (1977): \"Most of the people I admire, they usually smell funny and don't get out much. It's true. Most of them are either dead or not feeling well.

Keyboard players that I was listening to, and continue to listen to, are Bill Evans, Mose Allison, [Thelonious] Monk, Art Tatum, Huey Piano Smith, Professor Longhair, Doctor John. But of the cats I admire, there's no trace of my admiration for them in my own style, you know what I mean? If I said I listen to Thelonious Monk, you wouldn't be able to go and find out where that comes into my playing. \"I think Mose Allison. has been a strong influence on more artists than you can name, The Beatles, The Stones, Dylan.

April, 1977)\n\nDF (1977): Waits has never been much of a fan of what was considered \"commercially acceptable,\" by AM or FM standards. As a teenager growing up in the Los Angeles of the mid-Sixties, Tom showed little interest in the Haight-Ashbury, acid-rock sounds, or the black-light posters and incense that went with them. Instead, he began discovering gems from his parents' dusty collection of 78s. \"Wasn't anything real eclectic,\" he concedes, \"Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Gene Krupa, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller - nothing real 'inside.' But as an alternative to Blue Cheer, it was a welcome relief. I saw The Mothers once when I was about: fifteen or sixteen; I hated it. They were on a bill with Country Joe And The Fish, and I walked out. I wasn't a snob or anything - I just thought it was a waste of time.\" (Source: \"Tom Waits - Offbeat Poet And Pianist\". Contemporary Keyboard magazine, by Dan Forte. April, 1977)\n\nJH (1979): Did you ever meet Kerouac? TW: \"No, I used to dream about him. I remember one dream I had very clearly. I was in the kitchen in this apartment somewhere out in the Mid-West. There was a party and I was sat on the floor in this kitchen, and Kerouac came banging through the door. He was dragging this Mexican girl along by the hair, and he threw her up against the refrigerator and started slapping the shit out of her. He was screaming something, and she was screaming. And then I woke up.\" JH: Did you attach any special significance to that kind of experience then?

John Hamblett. London. May 12, 1979)\n\nQ (1979): Did he get \"Burma Shave\" from the Nick Ray movie, They Live By Night, from 1947? TW: \"Yeah, that's the one. In fact that's a great story. Very sad at the end where he gets mowed down at the motel. Farley Granger does soap operas now, I think. He was in Minneapolis and this woman disc jockey played it for him and he got a real kick out of it. He always played the baby-face hood. He don't work much any more. I guess Sal Mineo got most of his roles. Yeah, I used that. I kept coming back to that movie image. Also, I have a lot of relatives in this little town called Marysville, and a cousin, her name is Corrine Johnson, and every time I'd go up there from Los Angeles in the summers, she was always like you know 'Christ man - I gotta get outa this fucking town. I wanna go to LA.' She finally did. She hitch-hiked out and stood by this Foster Freeze on Prom Night. Got in a car with a guy who was just some juvinile delinquent, and he took her all the way to LA where she eventually cracked up. Burma Shave was a shaving cream company.

It was released about the time I got back from New York, in April sometime. It was a wonderful picture, I mean it, but it didn't make it. It wasn't no \"Towering Inferno,\" just a small picture with a lot of feeling. It was set on skid row in Los Angeles, Fifth Street, downtown. The locals call it \"the nickel.\" The film was about a couple of old friends who were reunited after some years. One had cleaned up and moved off the nickel and the other was still there, and dying from it. The one who'd cleaned up went back to find his old pal.

People banging on steam pipes, thousand boots coming down on a wood floor at the same time. That chorus of men singing, kind of a 'Dr.Zhivago'-feel to it. It was the way I originally perceived it. I abbreviated some of the scope and wanted bass marimba to give it kind of an exotic feel. So, you get the note and you get that kind of a tall wood clang with the attack.... But I originally saw this... the theme for some late night activity in the steam tunnels beneath New York City. Where allegedly there are entire communities of ladies and gentleman living under difficult circumstances beneath the subways.

Just to capture the mood more than anything of a marching marine or whatever walking down the wet street in Hong Kong and missing his wife back home. I worked in a restaurant in a sailor town for a long time. It's Porkcola National City. So, it was something I saw every night. It was next to tattoo parlour and country&western dance hall and a Mexican movie theatre. So I imagined this Chinese pinwheel in a fireworks display spinning, spinning and turning and then slowing down. As it slowed down it dislodged into a windmill in Illinois. That same of... and then looked down on us. A home. Where a woman is sitting in the living room sleeping on chairs with the television on.

There are times when you work on a song and end up repeating in the second verse what you already said in the first. So I thought I would be more appropiate if it's just like a feeling of a sailor somewhere in a cafe, who opens his wallet and turns to the guy next to him and shows him the picture while he's talking about something else and says: \"Oh, here. That's her.\" and then closes his wallet and puts it back in his pants. It relates in some way to \"Shore Leave\" in the sense that it talks about Illinois.

He has a washburn guitar strapped on the side of his mule and when he gets the crow he pulls the strings back and shoves this bird inside the guitar and then the strings make like a jail.

Everything was closed. When I woke up in the morning there was a pentecostal church right over the road. I walked over there with leaves in my hair and sand on the side of my face. This woman named Mrs. Anderson came. It was like New Years Eve... Yeah, it was New Years Eve. She said: \"We're having services here and you are welcome to join us.\" So I sat at the back pew in this tiny little church. And this mutant rock'n'roll band got up and started playing these old hymns in such a broken sort of way. They were preaching, and everytime they said something about the devil or evil or going down the wrong path she gestured in the back of the church to me. And everyone would turn around and look and shake their heads and then turn back to the preacher. It gave me a complex that I grew up with. On Sunday evening they have these religious programs where the preachers they are all bankers. They get on with these firering glasses and 700 $ suits. Shake their finger at America.

Everybody gets in [like Jimmy Durante] \"Everybody wants a get inta the action.\" Eh, my little girl said- she has a word called, the word is \"strangels.\" It's a cross between \"strange\" and \"angels.\" Strange angels. Strangels. They're called \"strangels.\" Or I said, or you could have \"braingels.\" Those are the strange angels that live in your head would be \"braingels.\" We just went around and around with it, and it wound up in \"The Ocean Doesn't Want Me Today.\" [clears throat] That little suicide note on the album. Yeah, kids. Great for the... Hey, kids write thousands of songs before they learn how to talk. They write better songs than anybody. So, you hope you can write something a kid would like.\" (Source: \"Morning becomes Eclectic \". KCRW radio Interview: Chris Douridas. Rebroadcast January 2 1998. Original broadcast 1992 (?))\n\nTom Waits (1992): \"My dad was very musical, my mother also. They both sang. We had music in the house. We had Bing Crosby. We had Harry Belafonte. We had Marty Robbins... Uh, A lot of Mariachi music. My dad loved, and still loves. He's a Spanish teacher, so that's what we listened to more than anything else, really. I wasn't allowed to listen to any of that hot rod music. So, I don't know where your musical education usually comes from, a little bit you heard when you were a kid, and then you're off on your own expedition, and what you do with it is up to you, how you integrate it. I have always felt like I'd find things that have fallen off a truck. Like the sound of this, I'll find some way to integrate it. I go at it like the Eyeball Kid. I try to sorta annex this, change this, I don't know how it all comes together, but once you have musical confidence, and that usually comes from being naive enough to explore without feeling self-conscious, cause you really do want songs to like you as much as you want to like them, and there are things about music that... There are places in music that you can only go if you're an idiot. That's the only way you can get in.\" (Source: \"Morning becomes Eclectic \". KCRW radio Interview: Chris Douridas.

He's got arms like a fisherman. He's physically very strong, and he can outlast you. You think you can stay up late? You can't even come close. He can stay up for a week--on coffee and stories.\" (Source: \"Tom Waits' wild year\". Musician: Mark Rowland. January 1993)\n\nTom Waits (1993): \"I have learned a great deal about music from other musicians, and from listening to the world around me. But when I was a kid growing up in Whittier, there was a red-headed boy named Billy Swed who lived with his mom in a trailer by the railroad tracks. Billy is the one who taught me how to play in a minor key. Billy didn't go to school. He was already smoking and drinking at the age of 12, and he lived with his mom at the edge of a hobo jungle on a mud rain lake with tires sticking up out of it. There was blue smoke, dead carp, and gourds as big as lamp shades. You could get lost trying to find their place--through overgrown dogwood and pyrancantha bushes, through a culvert under a freeway, and through canyons littered with mattresses and empy paint cans.\" (Source: \"Tom Foolery - Swapping stories with inimitable Tom Waits\". Buzz Magazine: May 1993)\n\nTom Waits (1993): \"I've always loved songs of adventure, murder ballads, songs about shipwrecks and terrible acts of depravity and heroism. Erotic tales of seductions, songs of romance, wild courage, and mystery. Everyone has tried at one time or another to live inside a song. Songs where people die for love. Songs of people on the run. Songs of ghost ships or bank robberies. I've always wanted to live inside songs and never come back. Songs that are recipes for supersitution or unexplained disappearances.\" (Source: \"Tom Foolery - Swapping stories with inimitable Tom Waits\".

He was crawling through a bitter and distracted version of \"Tennesee Waltz\" when he suddenly stopped the band (the members of which were all wearing matching pink jumpsuits). The room screamed with feedback as he threw his drink against the wall and stabbed an amplifier with a mike stand, telling the six business suits in the audience they were all bloodsuckers. He laughed nervously as he sweated in the spotlight and delivered a purely psychotic confession that resembled a cross between an execution and a striptease. In a style somewhere between a pimp and a preacher, he told stories of being a hairdresser in Puerto Rico and wanting to make it in Hollywood someday. He then lit up and sang \"I Who Have Nothing\" a cappella. I was there, and I knew that I wanted to get into show business as soon as possible.\" (Source: \"Tom Foolery - Swapping stories with inimitable Tom Waits\".

All the sounds on the (midway), you know...I still haven't got a really good metal sound -- when you see like swords in a real sword fight, or a real anvil with a real hammer. I'm still looking for the ultimate sound of a real stress metal clang. I wanna hear, really hear, really the clang of all clangs. Real clang. JJ: I used to work in a sheet metal factory, and there were some great sounds, tossing the stuff around, moving it, the metal scraps and stuff. TW: Yeah, right. I gotta collect those sounds. Tchad Blake, my engineer (on 'Bone Machine'), oh man, he's got a -- (He'd) got into India, a street, and stand in a fish market with his mike on, and record the bicycles, the bells on the handlebars. Ching-a-ching! Ching-a-ching! And the chings are coming in and ching-ing out, and it's a wonderful movie for the ears. You can just reach out and like, you can see the fish. Whoa! And trains, I've got a lot of trains on tape. Real chugs that are like a rhythmic chug, you just can't believe it. Like you pee your paints. And the TING ting ting as the bell's coming up.\" (Source: \"Straight No Chaser\" Jim Jarmusch. October 1993)\n\nTom Waits (1993): \"Hey, that pygmy stuff that you sent me really flipped me! It really got me listening, because we struggled for a couple days with getting the sound of a stick orchestra inside the studio for \"Earth Died Screaming\". We tried every configuration and position of the microphone, and finally I said, \"Well, why don't we go outside, isn't that where all these recordings are made?\" And five minutes later we had a mike up, we were hitting it, it was there. It was that simple.\" (Source: \"Straight No Chaser\" Jim Jarmusch. October 1993)\n\nJJ (1993): Ken Nordine. Did you do some stuff with Ken Nordine? TW: \"Yeah. He's most known for his records, 'Word Jazz', 'Sound of Word Jazz', 'Colors'. He worked with a small jazz group and made records in the '50s, and they're really stories, those strange little stories, little Twilight Zones from the dark recesses of his brain. Little worlds you go into. He has little conversations with himself, as if he's got the little guy with the pitchfork on his shoulder that's telling him, \"Yeah, kiss her.\" \"Well, I don't know.\" \"Go ahead, kiss her.\" JJ: ...and the voices overlap. TW: \"Yeah, Ken Nordine.\" JJ: Yeah, Ken Nordine. Where does he live, in LA? TW: \"Chicago.\" JJ: He's a strange little addition to American culture. TW: \"Yeah, he's really remarkable.\" (Source: \"Straight No Chaser\" Jim Jarmusch. October 1993)\n\nTom Waits (1993): \"I love reference books that help me with words, dictionaries of slang or the 'Dictionary of Superstition', or the 'Phrase and Fable, Book of Knowledge', things that help me find words that have a musicality to them. Sometimes that's all you're looking for. Or to make sounds that aren't words, necessarily. They're just sounds and they have a nice shape to them. They're big at the end and then they come down to a little point that curls. Words, y'know, for me are really, I love 'em, I'm always lookin' for 'em, I'm always writin' 'em down, always writin' down stuff. Language is always evolving. I love slang, prison slang and street idioms and --\" (Source: \"Straight No Chaser\" Jim Jarmusch. October 1993)\n\nJJ (1993): You like rap music because of that, right? TW: \"Oh yeah, I love it. It's so, it's a real underground railroad.\" JJ: It keeps American English living. Rap, hip-hop culture and street slang is to me what keeps it alive, and keeps it from being a dead thing. TW: \"Yeah, it happens real fast, too. It's....and it moves on, in like three weeks maybe something that was very current is now very passe. As soon as they adopt it, they have to move on.\" JJ: It's an outsider's code, in a way. TW: \"Well, it's all that dope talk that came because you had to have conversations, that whole underground railroad thing where you had to be able to talk to somebody in the presence of law enforcement, and have law enforcement totally unable to understand anything of what you were saying. I don't know if people really acknowledge as much as they should how the whole Afro-American experience, how it has given music and lyricism, poetry to daily life. It's so engrained that most people don't even give it credit.\" (Source: \"Straight No Chaser\" Jim Jarmusch. October 1993)\n\nTW: \"A lot of those Alan Lomax records that he did, song collecting in the '30s, captures that. He also captured just sounds, sounds that we will no longer be hearing, eventually, like he captured just the sound of a cash register that you really don't hear anymore.\" (Source: \"Straight No Chaser\" Jim Jarmusch. October 1993)\n\nJJ (1993): What writers do you like? TW: \"'Course Bukowski, the new collection is great, the 'Last Night of the Earth' poems. The one called \"You Know and I Know and Thee Know\"...there's some beautiful things in there, very mature, and (with an) end of the world sadness. And Cormac McCarthy I like. He has a new novel called 'All the Pretty Horses'.\" (Source: \"Straight No Chaser\" Jim Jarmusch. October 1993)\n\nTom Waits (1993): \"I learned a lot from working with Robert Wilson. He's an actor; every physical gesture, every movement onstage, he did it first. And he puts his actors through the wringer. When we were getting 'The Black Rider' together, I went onstage for an hour to stand in for somebody who was sick, and it was like, 'He's using these people like clay.' And this particular group of German actors were thrilled, they'd melt themselves down, pour themselves into any mold. \"By the end we were all transformed. I know the experience changed me. Things you planned turn out to be meaningless, and that which you accumulated without knowing it becomes your real treasure, your innocence, your confidence.

TW: \"I heard a Mexican guy working with the horses today and the way he spoke to the horses was so musical, so beautiful, the way he would shape his body to get the right sounds. \"I've always thought that in Mexican culture songs lived in the air, music is less precious and more woven into life,\" Waits says. \"There is a way of incorporating music into our lives that has meaning: songs for celebration, songs for teaching children things, songs of worship, songs to make the garden grow, songs to keep the devil away, songs to make a girl fall in love with you. My kids sing songs they have made up that I listen to and know by heart, and these songs have become part of our family life. You have to keep music alive in your life or else music becomes an isolated thing, just a pill you take.\" (Source: \"The music of chance\". Spin Magazine: Mark Richard.
