        "text": "William S. Burroughs is one of the greatest writers of our times. His talent\n\nhas brought him fame, and along with it, many burdens. Daily, Burroughs is\n\nswamped with fan mail, unexpected visitors and interview requests. And if\n\nthat wasn’t enough to keep him occupied, strange rumors have begun circulating\n\nabout him. Burroughs, who rarely grants interviews, speaks with Ron Whitehead\n\nin an attempt to counter the public’s false speculation about him.\n\n“His Swiftian vision of a processed, pre-pakeaged\n\nlife, of a kind of elctro-chemical totalitarianism, often\n\nevokes the black laughter of hilarious horror.”\n\n—Playboy\n\n“Burroughs is the greatest satirical writer since\n\nJonathan Swift.”\n\n—Jack Kerouac\n\n“The only American writer possessed by genius.”\n\n—Norman Mailer\n\n“Burroughs shakes the reader as a dog shakes\n\na rat.”\n\n—Anthony Burgess\n\n“An integrity beyond corruption…Burroughs\n\nconvinces us he has seen things beyond description.”\n\n—John Updike\n\n“One of the most dazzling magicians of\n\nour time.”\n\n—John Rechy,\n\n“The Ticket is Exploding”\n\n“With suffering comes humility and with it\n\nin the end, wisdom.”\n\n—J. Swift\n\nAt 82, William Seward Burroughs II, El Hombre Invisible, Literary\n\nOutlaw, Commandeur de l’Ordre de Arts et des Lettres, is rapidly becoming\n\nthe most respected, highly regarded writer in America, in the world.\n\n“All at once I snapped my fingers a couple of times\n\nand laughed. Hellfire and damnation! I suddenly\n\nimagined I had discovered a new word! I sat up in\n\nbed, and said: It is not in the language, I have\n\ndiscovered it – Kuboaa. It has letters just like\n\na real word, by sweet Jesus, man, you have discovered\n\na word!…Kuboaa…of tremendous linguistic\n\nsignificance. The word stood out clearly in front\n\nof me in the dark.”\n\nBurroughs? No. Knut Hamsun. In 1890, with the publication of\n\n“Hunger,” the first purely psychological novel(yes I’m ready to argue), Hamsun\n\nturned the literary world upside-down and spun it around. In 1959, 69 years\n\nafter Hamsun’s breakthrough, with the release of “Naked Lunch,” William S.\n\nBurroughs, explorer in the most real mythological sense, whose search for The\n\nWord has, does and will take him anywhere outside and inside himself, did what\n\nonly a small handful of “literari” have achieved in the history of writing:\n\nHe forever redirected the course of literature in a way that permanently\n\naltered language, culture and seeing.\n\nSo, what the hell is Old Bull Lee up to? Retired and enjoying good\n\nhealth, does he rest on his arse? No. He is busy working his arts off,\n\ndreaming, seeing, reading and representing new and old visions on paper,\n\ncanvas, vinyl,tape, disk, CD-Rom, your brain and mine.\n\nDream long and dream hard enough\n\nYou will come to know\n\nDreaming can make it so\n\n—William S. Burroughs\n\nBut rumors abound: He’s kept tied to his bed and forced to use a\n\nchamber pot; he still takes heroin; he moved to central America (USA) because\n\nland was cheap and he knows it’s about to become beachfront property since\n\nEast and West coasts willbe falling into oceans any day now; he’s dead; he\n\nshoots obsessed, fatal-attraction European midnight visitors with a shotgun.\n\nCome on people. Wake up. Sober down. William Burroughs is\n\nharassed day and night by folks from around the world showing up, without\n\ninvitation, notice or warning, banging on doors and windows, camping in his\n\nyard, trying to get a glimpse of the legend.\n\nThe man is 82. Let’s show respect for his privacy as we do for his\n\nwork, as we would expect and demand given the good fortune of being in his\n\nposition. He receives requests every day for interviews, visits, readings,\n\nrecordings and films. He does what he can, and always, always in the\n\nfriendliest manner. (And no, he hasn’t shot or threatened anyone.)\n\nWilliam’s latest books include “My Education: A Book of Dreams” and\n\n“Ghost of Chance.” Recent audiowork includes “Naked Lunch,””X-Files CD,”\n\nplus, he is now in studio recording “Junky” and enjoying it so much he may go\n\nright into “Queer.”\n\nTwo historic Burroughs events are taking place this summer. The Los\n\nAngeles County Museum of Art (you can contact them at 212-857-6522) is\n\npremiering the exhibition “Ports of Entry: William S. Burroughs and the Arts”\n\non July 16 through October 6. The event, curated by Robert Sobieszek, is the\n\nfirst-ever retrospective surveying Burroughs’ career, with 153 works,\n\nbeginning with his 1960s and early 1970s photocollages, scrapbooks, and his\n\ncollaborations with Brion Gysin on photomontage “cut-ups.” The exhibition\n\nwill also include Burroughs’ later shotgun art and recent abstract painting,\n\nand will explore how his work has influenced today’s cultural landscape,\n\nresulting in the absorption of his ideas and routines into newer art,\n\nadvertising and current popular culture.\n\nThe second event is The New Orleans Voices Without Restraint\n\nINSOMNIACATHON at the Contemporary Arts Center and The Howlin’ Wolf Club, the\n\nlargest Beat gathering of the year, where Mayor Mark Morial, James Grauerholz,\n\nDoug Brinkley, and others will speak with Burroughs over the phone. (For more\n\ninformation contact Ron Whitehead at 502-568-4956.)\n\nYes, the ticket is exploding. The walls of the literary world, the\n\nworld of culture, are crumbling, and through the gaping holes strides the\n\ndrawling wordslinger with an attitude, William Seward Burroughs II.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs: Hello?\n\nRon Whitehead: William?\n\nWSB: Yes.\n\nWhitehead: Ron Whitehead.\n\nWSB: Well, well, Ron Whitehead.\n\nWhitehead: How the hell are you?\n\nWSB: How what?\n\nWhitehead: How are you?\n\nWSB: Well, I’m fine, thank you.\n\nWhitehead: As you recall, I produced your “Published in Heaven: Remembering\n\nJack Kerouac poster and chapbook,” plus I sent you my “Calling the Toads” poem\n\n& I’m right now producing the William S. Burroughs/Sonic Youth 7″ vinyl\n\nrecording for our audio series.\n\nWSB: Oh, of course, yes, yes.\n\nWhitehead: I just received letters from Rene in Amsterdam. He says that after\n\nmy reading at the Meer den Woorden Festival in Goes, Holland he started having\n\ndreams in which you and I taught him how to save the world. I’m forwarding\n\nthe letters to you.\n\nWSB: How old is he? I think I remember him. What does he look like?\n\nWhitehead: Early 20s. Blond. Handsome. Friendly. Intelligent. Knows the\n\nhistory of the Beats inside out. He writes from a mental hospital in\n\nAmsterdam.\n\nWSB: Hmm. Not sure. Perhaps.\n\nWhitehead: Reason I’m calling is that Doug Brinkley has asked me to produce an\n\nevent in New Orleans in August. It will be the largest Beat gathering of the\n\nyear. RANT for the literary renaissance and The Majic Bus will present the\n\nevent, called Voices Without Restraint: 48-Hour Non-Stop Music & Poetry\n\nINSOMNIACATHON. As part of the event, we’ll hold a City of New Orleans\n\nPresentation Ceremony, dedicating to you the historic marker which will be\n\nerected at your Algiers home, which was made famous by Jack Kerouac in “On the\n\nRoad.” And we’d like to have a live phone conversation with you during the\n\npresentation.\n\nWSB: Why certainly. Yes, yes. I’m honored.\n\nWhitehead: Good. Just a few questions.\n\nWSB: Fine. Shoot.\n\nWhitehead: Why did you decide to settle in Algiers, which at that time was\n\nhome to various military bases, rather than in one of the traditional bohemian\n\nneighborhoods?\n\nWSB: Yes. Because it was a hell of a lot cheaper. Real estate there was the\n\ncheapest. I got that house for $7,000 something.\n\nWhitehead: Any memories of different New Orleans neighborhoods you visited,\n\nmusic, riding the ferry?\n\nWSB: The Quarter, strange plays…Didn’t get around too much.\n\nWhitehead: The New Orleans Police have come under attack recently — imagine\n\nthat — for corruption. A cop hired executioners to kill a woman who signed a\n\nbrutality complaint against him. Louisiana police cars have “So no one will\n\nhave to fear” inscribed on their sides. Do you have any observations about\n\nthe New Orleans police, about the illegal search of your home there, or the\n\nfirearms they confiscated?\n\nWSB: No. They never laid a finger on me, as far as any brutality goes. They\n\ndid lead me to believe that one of them was a federal agent when he wasn’t.\n\nHe was a city cop. So there was an illegal search. But I didn’t know it at\n\nthe time. The next day, I was arrested. There was someone with me I hardly\n\nknew. He was just introduced to me. He had one joint on him. He’d thrown\n\nout larger amounts but still had one, and they found it right away. Then the\n\nnext day they went in and took my car and I never got it back, though I wasn’t\n\nconvicted of anything. See, they can confiscate your property even though\n\nyou’re not convicted of anything. And that’s really scary sinister.\n\nWhitehead: Both our political parties are looking like a bird with two right\n\nwings.\n\nWSB: Exactly.\n\nWhitehead: The police are gaining more powers daily as our personal freedoms\n\nare disappearing.\n\nWSB: See, that’s what I say. The whole drug war is nothing but a pretext to\n\nincrease police power and personnel, and that, of course, is dead wrong. So\n\nmany created imagined drug offenses.\n\nWhitehead: New Orleans has North America’s largest magic community. In\n\nrecent years you’ve spoken bluntly about your interest in magic. In New\n\nOrleans did you encounter magic in any form?\n\nWSB: No, I didn’t.\n\nWhitehead: There may be irony in having a literary marker commemorate your\n\nAlgiers home, a place where you lived briefly, perhaps unhappily. Did you\n\nproduce any writing there?\n\nWSB: Oh yes, quite a bit. And I wouldn’t say I was particularly unhappy\n\nthere.\n\nWhitehead: So it wasn’t all that bad?\n\nWSB: No, it wasn’t. Not at all.\n\nWhitehead: Jack Kerouac devoted a large section of “On the Road,” on the New\n\nOrleans visit.\n\nWSB: Oh well, Kerouac was writing fiction. What he did when he wrote about\n\nme…he made me out with Russian Countesses and Swiss accounts and other\n\nthings I didn’t have or didn’t happen and so on. Yet…some truth, some\n\nfiction.\n\nWhitehead: You have dramatically influenced music, literature, film, art,\n\nadvertising and culture in general. Are you intrigued by that influence? How\n\ndid you first become conscious of other people’s perception of you as icon?\n\nWSB: Well, slowly of course. Over time. Reading the paper, magazines,\n\njournals, that sort of thing.\n\nWhitehead: The request for interviews becomes absurd after a while. This is\n\nthe first and last one I intend to do. I feel uncomfortable in the position\n\nof interviewer.\n\nWSB: Yes, it becomes absurd because interviewers generally ask the same\n\nquestions, say the same things.\n\nWhitehead: Recently you’ve been barraged with interview requests, especially\n\nin relation to the deaths of Timothy Leary and Jan Kerouac.\n\nWSB: Yes, of course I knew Leary, but barely knew, didn’t really know Jan.\n\nJames knew her, was friends with her, but I didn’t.\n\nWhitehead: Hunter S. Thompson, who I like so much, is, like me, from\n\nLouisville and you’re from just up the road in St. Louis. I recently visited\n\nHunter at his home in Colorado. Hunter said he thought he was a pretty good\n\nshot until he went shooting with you.\n\nWSB: I’ll put it like this: Some days you’re good and some you aren’t.\n\nWhitehead: You must have been good that day. Hunter was real impressed.\n\nWSB: Well, he gave me a great pistol.\n\nWhitehead: Like Hunter, some people would say that you’re a Southern\n\ngentleman with a world literary reputation, but both you and Hunter have\n\nescaped the Southern-writer label. Any comments?\n\nWSB: I escaped the label because I didn’t and don’t write about the South.\n\nWhitehead: Do you have a personal favorite of your own readings? I know\n\nyou’ve been in the studio recording “Junky.”\n\nWSB: No, I don’t have any special favorite.\n\nWhitehead: Other than Brion Gysin, is there anyone you miss the most?\n\nWSB: When you get to be my age there are more and more people you have known\n\nthat you miss. Brion, Antony Balch, Ian Summerville are ones I think of right\n\naway I was quite close to.\n\nWhitehead: Diane di Prima is underrated, underappreciated in the world. Her\n\nautobiography will be released by Viking Penguin in April ’97. I hope she’ll\n\nfinally receive credit that’s long overdue.\n\nWSB: Yes, I hope so too.\n\nWhitehead: You’ve had much to say about Samuel Beckett. Beckett’s mentor,\n\nJames Joyce, was an anarchist who devoted his life work to undermining and\n\ndeconstructing the dominant paradigm of patriarchy in government, religion,\n\nfamily and literature. I’m doing research asking The Beats what influence\n\nJames Joyce had, if any, on their writing. How do you feel about Joyce?\n\nWSB: Well he’s great, a very great writer. Any modern writer is bound to be\n\ninfluenced by Joyce. Of course, by Beckett as well.\n\nWhitehead: I had a long conversation with Allen Ginsberg about Bob Dylan.\n\nAllen talked about his personal feelings towards Dylan and also about Dylan’s\n\nwork. Allen said he felt like Dylan would be remembered long after The Beats\n\nand he added reasons why. This is a strong statement, especially coming from\n\nAllen Ginsberg. Do you have any comments on this?\n\nWSB: No, I don’t. Not in any cursory way. Of course, I’ve listened to and\n\nknow his music and met him a couple of times, but I don’t have any strong\n\nstatements to make.\n\nWhitehead: John Giorno is giving me an out-take from The Best of Bill CD box\n\nset he’s producing. As part of White Fields Press’ Published in Heaven\n\nseries, I’m producing a 7″ vinyl recording with you on one side and Sonic\n\nYouth on the other. Lee Ranaldo has stopped by to visit you. How much are\n\nyou able to keep up with music today?\n\nWSB: Some much more than others. I’ve worked with and am very good friends\n\nwith Patti Smith and Jim Carroll.\n\nWhitehead: How do you feel about this historic marker?\n\nWSB: Fine. Fine. It’s an honor like the French Commandeur de l’Ordre des\n\nArts et des Lettres. Commander of Arts and Letters. Commander of Arts and\n\nLetters."
