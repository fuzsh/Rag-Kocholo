        "meta_description": "William S. Burroughs (1914–1997) was an American author, painter, and spoken-word performer who has had a wide-ranging influence on American culture. Jack Kerouac called him the “greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift.” Norman Mailer declared him “the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius.” A postmodernist and a key figure of the beat generation, he focused his art on a relentless subversion of the moral, political, and economic conventions of modern American society, as reflected in his often darkly humorous and sardonic satire. He wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six short-story collections, and four collections of essays. No fewer than five books of his interviews and correspondence have been published. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1983 and in the following year was appointed to the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.",

        "text": "Praise for Books\n\n“Like nothing else being published in the United States today…Burroughs is one of the most ambitious and original novelists working in America…A remarkable piece of sustained narrative invention, a comic meditation on death in the guise of a novel.” —New York Times Book Review\n\n“Burroughs is the greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift.” —Jack Kerouac\n\n“A sermon blast of language…Burroughs is the Martin Luther of hipsterism, welding his decree on the silicon doors of the solar system.” —Newsweek\n\n“It’s a comedy and a nightmare of Bosch-like visions, extraordinarily precise vivid visualizations, outrageous ideas like mind bombs.” —Allen Ginsberg\n\n“It is in books like The Ticket That Exploded that Burroughs seems to revel in a new medium for its own sake—a medium totally fantastic, spaceless, timeless, in which the normal sentence is fractured, the cosmic tries to push its way through bawdry, and the author shakes the reader as a dog shakes a rat.” —Anthony Burgess, New York Times bestselling author\n\n“Burroughs is the greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift.” —Jack Kerouac\n\n“Cities of the Red Night is not only Burroughs’ best work but a logical and ripening extension of all of Burroughs’ great work.” —Ken Kesey, author of One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest\n\n“Burroughs possesses a special literary gift…[Naked Lunch] takes a coldly implacable look at the dark side of our nature.” —New York Times\n\n“The Western Lands illuminates and puts into perspective the whole body of work of the Grand Iconoclast, who has altered the concept of the novel more powerfully—some would say ‘violently’—than any other writer of his time.” —Los Angeles Times\n\n“Burroughs writes with a beauty and efficiency unmatched by any living writer.” —Chicago Sun-Times\n\n“Powerful…A raging torrent of words and images…Burroughs, like Dalí, first draws from his insanity, then selects with reason. And what a master of the mother tongue he is—sculpted sentences, poetic prose, riffs that make you gasp in amazement…More accessible and murkily poetic than ever.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review\n\n“[Burroughs’] Swiftian vision of a processed, prepackaged life, a kind of electrochemical totalitarianism, often evokes the black laughter of hilarious horror.” —Playboy\n\n“The voice in The Soft Machine is talking about time…[It] slips deliberately and frequently, sometimes ironically and sometimes not…rattles off elliptical allusions, throws away joke after outrageous joke, shifts gear in mid-sentence, never falters. It is precisely this voice—complex, subtle, allusive—that is the fine thing about The Soft Machine and about Burroughs.” —Joan Didion, New York Times bestselling author\n\n“Cities of the Red Night is Burroughs’ masterpiece. In it, the world ends with a bang—and a barely perceived whimper, disguised by the wicked smile of one of the most dazzling magicians of our time.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review\n\n“Ever since Naked Lunch…Williams S. Burroughs has been ordained as America’s most incendiary artist.” —Los Angeles Times\n\n“Burroughs’ visionary power, his comic genius, and his unerring ability to crack the codes that make up the life of this century are undiminished.” —Washington Post Book World\n\n“Hypnotic…outrageous. [Burroughs] can think of the wildest parodies of erotic exuberance and invent the weirdest places for demonstrating them.” —Harper’s\n\n“One of the wildest rides into the Wild West, and other parts known and unknown, we will ever have.” —Washington Post Book World\n\n“The power of his imagination often carries his comedy far into the buried recesses of the psyche.” —New Republic\n\n“One of the most interesting pieces of radical fiction we have.” —Nation\n\n“One should approach Cities of the Red Night as the Wagneresque capper of all the five or six homosexual planet-operas Burroughs has scripted since he found a genuine new style in Naked Lunch…It’s as if we had gotten hold of a black ticket to his unconscious, and anyone who makes the trip will see sights and feel feelings that are unique and mind-bending beyond anyone else’s description.” —Washington Post Book World\n\n“William S. Burroughs’ classic tale…is invigorated by this enthusiastic reading. Mark Bramhall offers a professional performance peppered with every trick of the actor’s trade to make it a resonating effort. He approaches the work with such energy that the story seems like a new entity, freshly relevant and timely. Listeners will lose themselves in the journey of junkie William Lee as he makes his way from bizarre destination to even more bizarre destination in this unforgettable novel.” —Publishers Weekly\n\n“The trilogy…is completed here, and the result is a divine comedy….A significant work on its own merits…Burroughs speaks more directly than usual, sometimes in the guise of old, forgotten novelist William Seward Hall, sometimes forthrightly and freely in his authorial voice. As a result, Burroughs fans will find this narrative vivid, horrifying, beautiful, and sad.” —Publishers Weekly\n\n“Macabre, funny, reverberant, grotesque.” —New York Review of Books\n\n“A moving personal saga as well as a record of revolutionary vision.” —Chicago Tribune\n\n“In Mr. Burroughs’ hands, writing reverts to acts of magic.” —New York Times\n\n“Cities of the Red Night is the most complete and most devastatingly sardonic statement of William Burroughs’ apocalyptic vision. Through his mordant satire of cultural aspirations, homosexual eroticism, and political power, he focuses our gaze into the abyss. His cold, surgical language creates beauty through a terror that we are just able to bear…A modern Inferno.” —Newsday (Long Island, NY)\n\n“If Naked Lunch is one of your favorites from the Beat Generation, you MUST, MUST listen to this audio performance! Hallucinatory visions will fill listeners’ minds as narrator Mark Bramhall tells the maddeningly fragmented story of drug addict William Lee, who moves in and out of various states of consciousness as he flees the police, taking to the road and eventually landing in Mexico. Bramhall deftly delivers the nonlinear vignettes that comprise this basically plotless novel, creating a narrative drive that will keep listeners tuned in…The only one who might have done a better job of narrating is Burroughs himself.” —AudioFile\n\n“The title refers to the place in ancient Egyptian mythology where souls journeyed in search of immortality. Characters from Burroughs’ earlier works reappear; the dreamlike prose stylistically a mixture of straight-forward and surrealistic narrative…as Burroughs explores such themes as addiction, mortality, the survival of the species, and the quest for eternal life. Essential for all serious literature collections.” —Library Journal\n\n“A great, an essential novel…[It] prefigures much that has occurred in history, the popular media, and high and low culture in the last four decades.” —The Commercial Appeal\n\n“He was 20th-century drug culture’s Poe, its Artaud, its Baudelaire. He was the prophet of the literature of pure experience, a phenomenologist of dread…Burroughs had the scary genius to turn the junk wasteland into a parallel universe, one as thoroughly and obsessively rendered as Blake’s.” —Salon\n\n“Mark Bramhall’s powerful, fully vocalized performance is searing. The characters, with a multitude of accents and a variety of disorders, are individualized memorably and in keeping with the intent of the text. The novel, turns the profane into art. The reading turns the squalid into richness of subject matter. Not for everybody, but an important classic, nevertheless, and a superb narration.” —SoundCommentary.com\n\n“William was a shootist. He shot like he wrote—with extreme precision and no fear.” —Hunter S. Thompson"
