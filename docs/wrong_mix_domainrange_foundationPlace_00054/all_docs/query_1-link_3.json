        "text": "Hi everyone - I am looking for a new role and would appreciate your support. Thank you in advance for any connections, advice, or opportunities you can offer. #OpenToWork\n\nHello, New York associates. Join me for an event on June 8 at 6pm at the The New York Society Library. I'll be reading from my book of all things egg, followed by a discussion with bestselling novelist Kirstin Chen. I loved her recent book Counterfeit, which is filled with intrigue, female friendships, and pirated handbag schemes. Hope to see you there! https://lnkd.in/epJjf9-a\n\nHi DC! Did you know that clowns immortalize their makeup and costuming on eggshells? Join me for a conversation about eggs--and bagels--at KRAMERBOOKS AND AFTERWORDS, INC. on May 17th at 6pm. I'll be reading a bit from my new book Egg: A Dozen Ovatures, an unconventional history of the world's largest cellular workhorse, from chickens to penguins, art to crime, and more. A conversation with Cathy Barrow, most recently the author of Bagels, Schmears, and a Nice Piece of Fish will follow. RSVP at the link below--we'd love to see you there! https://lnkd.in/ezY7mWya\n\nI just started reading Lizzie Stark's excellent and entertaining book Egg. And was reminded of the \"cosmic egg motif\" -egg symbolism representing the foundation of the universe in many cultures. The book speaks to me as a feminist, chicken lady, and designer. I think the magic of the original Mamava pod and our ability to establish the category was due in part to the egg like shape -representing both harmony and structural security - eggs represent a bodacious optimism, which also happens to be one of our brand values."
