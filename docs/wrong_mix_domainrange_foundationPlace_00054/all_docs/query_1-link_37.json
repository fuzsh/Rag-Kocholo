        "text": "Important Notes\n\nWhat you need to bring will vary according to when you are travelling. Generally speaking, we recommend you pack as lightly as possible and make sure that you are able to carry and lift your own luggage, and walk with it for short distances. As well as your underwear, toothbrush and other items you always need to pack for travel, below are some items that you specifically need for this trip.\n\nIntrepid provide an individual duffel bag to carry your trekking gear. The weight limit per person is 10kg each. Porters carry two bags each as well as a their own backpack. Porters weight limit is 25kg each.\n\nPlease keep the weight and bulk of your trek bag to a minimum by bringing clothes made from lightweight material. Don't pack too much clothing; one or two changes will be all you need. However, as the weather conditions in the Himalayas are often unpredictable, be prepared for all eventualities, be it rain, unseasonable cold or heat. For the trek all of your gear should be packed into plastic bags to protect it from the weather dry clothes are essential for your comfort.\n\nYour trek leader will assist you in packing your kitbag and can advise what to bring and what can be left behind in Kathmandu.\n\nDay pack Your day pack must have the capacity for the items you will be carrying on a day's walk rain jacket, spare trousers, warm clothing, water bottles, camera equipment, washing items and other personal effects. A hip/waist strap provides additional comfort. You should consider day packs of at least a 30 to 40 litre capacity. You only need to carry your day pack when trekking each day.\n\nSLEEPING BAG & INNER SHEET\n\nA good quality, warm sleeping bag is essential while trekking as only blankets are provided at tea houses. Please note that sleeping bags, are readily available to buy or hire in both Kathmandu at very reasonable rates. Your group leader can assist you in hiring gear after your joining meeting. If you plan to hire a sleeping bag we recommend that you bring an inner sleep sheet, which adds another layer of warmth. In winter a thermal inner sleep sheet is warmer. If you bring your own sleeping bag, please think about the time of year of your trek. We recommend a four season bag with a rating to around -10c. In Winter (Dec-Feb) a five seasons bag is recommended.\n\nWATER BOTTLES\n\nIt is essential to bring 2 x 1lt water bottles to refill along the way.\n\nWhile trekking, boiled or safe drinking water is available to purchase in tea houses.\n\nHowever, you should also carry a water purification method. Options include\n\npurification tablets available from camping stores or pharmacies eg. Micropur.\n\n2% tincture of iodine, available from pharmacies, used at 4 drops per litre of water and left for at least 20 minutes longer in very cold weather.\n\nESSENTIALTREKKING EQUIPMENT\n\nTrekking boots (broken in)\n\nGaiters + spikes (for winter departures Dec-Feb only can be hired in Kathmandu if required)\n\nWaterproof 3/4 season jacket and trousers (can be hired/purchased in Kathmandu if required)\n\nCamp footwear (ie sneakers, thongs or booties)\n\nSeveral pairs of high quality hiking socks\n\nT-Shirts highly recommended are synthetic t-shirt styles that wick away moisture\n\nThermal underwear/layers\n\nDown jacket (can be hired/purchased in Kathmandu if required)\n\nWarm mid layers (fleece/micro fibre)\n\nTrousers lightweight, loose fitting, trekking trousers (can be purchased in Kathmandu)\n\nShorts or skirt for summer\n\nTracksuit or fleece pants for even\n\nSleeveless fleece and extra layers for winter departures (Dec-Feb)\n\nWarm hat & sun hat\n\nScarf/neck warmer\n\nGloves and mitts waterproof and warm.\n\nSunglasses with UV protection\n\nHead torch (w spare batteries)\n\nSunscreen and lip balm\n\nLight weight towel or sarong\n\nPersonal first aid kit\n\nBiodegradable wet wipes/toilet paper\n\nHand sanitizer gel\n\nTrail mix/nuts/muesli bars (bring zip lock bags from home)\n\nOPTIONAL GEAR\n\nPocket knife\n\nInsect repellent\n\nEar plugs\n\nWalking poles\n\nExtra zip lock bags\n\nHot water bottle (winter months)\n\nCASH\n\nBefore departing on your trek, make sure you have enough Nepalese currency to purchase meals and drinks during the trek in the smaller denominations where possible, there are no ATM's and it can be harder to change a NPR1000 note.\n\nOTHER GUIDES & FURTHER TRAVEL\n\nFor other guides to packing for treks\n\nIf you are spending further time in the region, please see some ideas for regular travelling gear to pack.\n\nfurther advice on what to pack, see our Everest Base Camp packing guide here\n\nPassport and visas\n\nPASSPORT\n\nYou’ll need a valid passport to travel internationally and most countries require your passport to have a minimum of 6 months validity, so remember to check the expiry date.\n\nWe need your passport information to get everything ready for your trip so it’s important that the information on your booking matches your passport exactly. Please take care to provide the correct details. We recommend carrying a copy of the photo page of your passport while travelling and leaving a copy at home with family or friends.\n\nVISAS & ENTRY REQUIREMENTS\n\nMany countries require a visa and obtaining the correct visa for your trip and any countries you may transit through is your responsibility. We recommend you check your visa requirements as soon as you have booked your trip. This will ensure you have time to prepare your documents and for your visa application to be processed. You can check the entry requirements for your nationality on your government's foreign travel advisories, consular websites or on our page here: www.intrepidtravel.com/visa-entry-requirements\n\nTravel insurance\n\nTravel insurance is compulsory on all our trips for those travelling internationally. We require that at a minimum you are covered for medical expenses including emergency repatriation. If you are travelling within your home country or region please confirm before travel that you are entitled to access the public medical system easily should an accident occur. We strongly recommend all travellers have a policy that also covers personal liability, cancellation, curtailment and loss of luggage or personal effects. For international trips, you will not be permitted to join the group until evidence of travel insurance and the insurance company's 24-hour emergency contact number has been sighted by your group leader or local representative.\n\nIf you have credit card insurance your group leader or local representative will require details of the participating insurer/underwriter, the level of coverage, policy number, and emergency contact number rather than the bank's name and your credit card details. Please contact your bank for these details prior to arriving in-country.\n\nFor travellers who reside within the European Union, Switzerland or USA the requirement to purchase travel insurance cannot be compulsory. However the purchase of travel insurance is still highly recommended, and travellers from these regions who decline travel insurance when travelling outside of their home region must sign a Travel Insurance Waiver Form at the Group Meeting, recognizing personal responsibility for emergency medical and repatriation costs should they arise.\n\nFor assistance with travel insurance or other services, please visit the link below:\n\nResponsible travel\n\nOur Responsible Travel Policy outlines our commitment to preserving the environment, supporting local communities, protecting the vulnerable, and giving back to the places we travel. All our trip group leaders or local representatives, suppliers, and staff are trained on these principles and are core to us delivering sustainable, experience-rich travel.\n\nExplore the different parts of our Responsible Travel Policy by visiting:\n\nELEPHANT PERFORMANCES & ELEPHANT RIDING:\n\nWhile we respect each individual’s decisions while travelling, Intrepid does not include elephant rides or unnatural performance activities on any itinerary, and we recommend you bypass these activities should they be offered to you during your stay. Professional wildlife conservation and animal welfare organisations, including World Animal Protection, advise that contrary to common belief, captive elephants remain wild animals and despite good intentions, unfortunately, many venues are unable to provide the appropriate living conditions elephants require and this ultimately impacts their well-being. While there is some merit in the argument that the money you pay for the activity goes towards keeping the elephants and their mahouts employed, we know that it also fuels demand for elephants to be captured in the wild or captive-bred. We thank you for your support in improving the welfare of these majestic creatures. Further information is available on the below link:\n\nPORTERS:\n\nOur porters are valued members of our trekking teams. We operate our treks according to standards that provide respectful, safe, and fair working conditions not only in Nepal, but on all our trips globally. For more information on porter welfare, see\n\nNEPAL\n\nDress codes are quite relaxed in tourist areas of Kathmandu and Pokhara, but much more conservative in other parts of the country. Remove shoes before entering certain temples and holy places and be aware that non-Hindus may not be permitted at some religious sites. Dress modestly, take care not to offend, and ask your group leader or local representative if you are unsure if something is appropriate.\n\nClimate and seasonal\n\nALTERNATIVE ITINERARY DUE TO FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS:\n\nWeather conditions in the Himalayas can change rapidly, which frequently results in the need for changes to be made to our intended itineraries. Flights throughout Nepal, particularly in high mountain areas, can be delayed or cancelled due to poor weather conditions. Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla are particularly prone to these delays which has the potential to vary the itinerary of all departures in the Everest region. Our contingency plans in case of bad weather preventing the fixed wing aircraft flight from Kathmandu to Lukla are as follows:\n\nDay 2 - We will attempt to board our booked fixed wing flight as per the itinerary. If this flight is cancelled we will return to our hotel in Kathmandu for an additional night.\n\nDay 3 - We will again attempt to board our booked fixed wing flight. If this flight is cancelled but helicopters are available and permitted to fly to Lukla we will use our best endeavours to charter a helicopter to transport the group. Travellers will need to use their emergency fund to cover the cost of this chartered helicopter. The exact cost will depend on how many travellers are in your group and could be up to US$500. If we reach Lukla on Day 3 by either fixed wing aircraft or helicopter we will then follow the same itinerary to Everest Base Camp, but descend over one less day in order to take our return flight from Lukla on Day 14.\n\nDay 4 – If both fixed-wing planes and helicopters are unable to reach Lukla on the morning of day 3, then on day 4 we will drive back to Kathmandu by private vehicle. While we will not be able to reach Base Camp itself on the altered itinerary to Langtang - Gosainkunda Trek, our travellers have still found it a highly enjoyable trek with superb views of snow caped mountains and visit the beautiful lake - Gosainkunda. This lake is sacred for both Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims.\n\nWe also advise allowing a few extra days in Kathmandu at the end of your trip should your return flights from Lukla be delayed due to weather conditions.\n\nSEASONAL INFORMATION:\n\nNepal's climate varies greatly depending on the season:\n\nJUN - SEP: the monsoon rains (mostly at night) bring landslides in regional areas. Cloud cover often obscures mountain views with rain, mud, and leeches deterring most trekkers at this time of year. Treks running in September can be hot and very humid at lower altitudes. See what it's like to trek during monsoon here:\n\nMAR-APR: Spring brings warm weather and spectacular rhododendron blooms. A popular time to visit and one of the peak times to trek.\n\nOCT - NOV: Clear skies and warm days make autumn the peak season.\n\nDEC - FEB: Winter brings cold temperatures and snow to the mountains. Good trekking, but remember to rug up.\n\nSome towns, including Kathmandu, experience very high levels of seasonal smog which can lead to decreased scenic visibility.\n\nFeedback\n\nCan’t stop thinking about your adventure?
