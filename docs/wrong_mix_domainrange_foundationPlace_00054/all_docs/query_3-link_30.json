Prior to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in `ion-java` for applications that use `ion-java` to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize Ion text or binary encoded data into the `IonValue` model and then invoke certain `IonValue` methods on that in-memory representation. An actor could craft Ion data that, when loaded by the affected application and/or processed using the `IonValue` model, results in a `StackOverflowError` originating from the `ion-java` library. The patch is included in `ion-java` 1.10.5. As a workaround, do not load data which originated from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with.2024-01-037.5CVE-2024-21634\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comapache -- dolphinschedulerImproper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache DolphinScheduler.

This would allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker could access production resources if they were bound to the worker. This issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2. Whilst wrangler dev's inspector server listens on local interfaces by default as of wrangler@3.16.0, an SSRF vulnerability in miniflare https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-fwvg-2739-22v7 (CVE-2023-7078) allowed access from the local network until wrangler@3.18.0. wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2 introduced validation for the Origin/Host headers.2023-12-298CVE-2023-7080\n\ncna@cloudflare.com\n\ncna@cloudflare.com\n\ncna@cloudflare.com\n\ncna@cloudflare.com\n\ncna@cloudflare.comcode-projects -- client_details_systemA vulnerability was found in code-projects Client Details System 1.0.

Prior to version 1.2.0, there is a potential for a mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file and also allow for certain tags at the same time. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized output. This is patched in OWASP AntiSamy .NET 1.2.0 and later. See important remediation details in the reference given below. As a workaround, manually edit the AntiSamy policy file (e.g., antisamy.xml) by deleting the `preserveComments` directive or setting its value to `false`, if present. Also, it would be useful to make AntiSamy remove the `noscript` tag by adding a line described in the GitHub Security Advisory to the tag definitions under the `<tagrules>` node or deleting it entirely if present. As the previously mentioned policy settings are preconditions for the mXSS attack to work, changing them as recommended should be sufficient to protect you against this vulnerability when using a vulnerable version of this library. However, the existing bug would still be present in AntiSamy or its parser dependency (HtmlAgilityPack). The safety of this workaround relies on configurations that may change in the future and don't address the root cause of the vulnerability. As such, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to a fixed version of AntiSamy.2024-01-026.1CVE-2023-51652\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comcampcodes -- online_college_library_systemA vulnerability was found in Campcodes Online College Library System 1.0.

A security vulnerability was found in CubeFS HandlerNode in versions prior to 3.3.1 that could allow authenticated users to send maliciously crafted requests that would crash the ObjectNode and deny other users from using it. The root cause was improper handling of incoming HTTP requests that could allow an attacker to control the amount of memory that the ObjectNode would allocate. A malicious request could make the ObjectNode allocate more memory that the machine had available, and the attacker could exhaust memory by way of a single malicious request. An attacker would need to be authenticated in order to invoke the vulnerable code with their malicious request and have permissions to delete objects. In addition, the attacker would need to know the names of existing buckets of the CubeFS deployment - otherwise the request would be rejected before it reached the vulnerable code. As such, the most likely attacker is an inside user or an attacker that has breached the account of an existing user in the cluster. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation besides upgrading.2024-01-036.5CVE-2023-46738\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comcubefs -- cubefsCubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A vulnerability was found during in the CubeFS master component in versions prior to 3.3.1 that could allow an untrusted attacker to steal user passwords by carrying out a timing attack. The root case of the vulnerability was that CubeFS used raw string comparison of passwords. The vulnerable part of CubeFS was the UserService of the master component. The UserService gets instantiated when starting the server of the master component. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. For impacted users, there is no other way to mitigate the issue besides upgrading.2024-01-036.5CVE-2023-46739\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comcubefs -- cubefsCubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. Prior to version 3.3.1, CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific, sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining higher privileges. When CubeFS creates new users, it creates a piece of sensitive information for the user called the \"accessKey\". To create the \"accesKey\", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy to guess and thereby impersonate the created user. An attacker could leverage the predictable random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user to obtain higher privileges. The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than to upgrade.2024-01-036.5CVE-2023-46740\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comcubefs -- cubefsCubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A vulnerability was found in CubeFS prior to version 3.3.1 that could allow users to read sensitive data from the logs which could allow them escalate privileges. CubeFS leaks configuration keys in plaintext format in the logs. These keys could allow anyone to carry out operations on blobs that they otherwise do not have permissions for. For example, an attacker that has successfully retrieved a secret key from the logs can delete blogs from the blob store. The attacker can either be an internal user with limited privileges to read the log, or they can be an external user who has escalated privileges sufficiently to access the logs. The vulnerability has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than upgrading.2024-01-034.8CVE-2023-46741\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comcubefs -- cubefsCubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. CubeFS prior to version 3.3.1 was found to leak user's secret keys and access keys in the logs in multiple components. When CubeCS creates new users, it leaks the user's secret key. This could allow a lower-privileged user with access to the logs to retrieve sensitive information and impersonate other users with higher privileges than themselves. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than upgrading CubeFS.2024-01-034.8CVE-2023-46742\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.com\n\nsecurity-advisories@github.comgoogle -- androidIn keyInstall, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check.
