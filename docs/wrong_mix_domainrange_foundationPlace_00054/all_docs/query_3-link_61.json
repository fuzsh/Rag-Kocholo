        "text": "Trip Suitability\n\nAt Imaginative Traveller, we want you to enjoy your trip to the fullest extent possible, so we ask you to take a moment to read through the following information and make sure you're fully aware of the kind of trip you will be joining.\n\nImaginative Traveller trips and adventure travel in general can be quite demanding and there are risks and hazards that are inherent in such trips. Long driving days can sometimes be uncomfortable and tiring. Many of the places we visit are off the beaten track and so do not have the infrastructure that we are accustomed to in western society. Accommodation can vary greatly in standards and when wild camping on an Overland trip we rely entirely on our own provisions.\n\nYou will have the opportunity to take part in many exciting activities and excursions, some of which are included whilst others are optional (i.e. hiking the Inca Trail, trekking to see Mountain Gorillas) these require a certain level of fitness, so it's important that you read through the trip notes thoroughly and make your own conclusions as to whether you feel that you are fit and healthy enough to enjoy this trip to its fullest. Some activities may have higher risks than you are used to and you must judge whether or not you wish to, or have the physical ability to take part. All travellers are also required to carry their own bag and lift it into storage areas, get on and off public transport or if on an Overland trip - be able to manage the 2-foot step on and off the Overland truck.\n\nWeather conditions in certain areas can also make physical activity more challenging. This also applies to our trips that travel at altitude.\n\nIt is extremely rare for us to have to refuse anyone a space on our trips for medical reasons. If at the time of booking you have any concern at all about a medical condition that may prevent you from participating fully in the trip, please let your travel agent or Imaginative Traveller know as soon as possible. If upon disclosure, our operator is of the opinion that the trip is not suitable for you, then we reserve the right to cancel your booking or alternatively to limit your participation in certain activities.\n\nWhilst we don't want to put anyone off experiencing one of our trips, we ask that you read through the trip notes for the trip you have selected carefully and realistically self assess your ability to complete the trip as described. Please consult with your Dr and/or us if you have any doubts.\n\nA positive attitude and an open mind are just as important as your ability to get involved and fully participate on your group trip.\n\nBooking Conditions\n\nValid from 1st May 2019\n\n(updated on 23 April 2019)\n\nTerms Used\n\na) These conditions apply to all tours sold by or through Imaginative Traveller (hereinafter called 'Imaginative Traveller'), but operated by Intrepid Travel Group UK Ltd.\n\nImaginative Traveller is a trading name for Dragoman Overseas Travel Ltd.

Prices & surcharges\n\nOur trip prices are subject to variable and seasonal pricing, both of which are standard practice within the travel. Our trip prices are subject to variable and seasonal pricing, both of which are standard practice within the travel industry. This means our trip prices may vary at any time in accordance with demand, market conditions and availability. It is likely that different passengers on the same trip have been charged different prices. Your best option if you like the price you see is to book at that time. Once you have received a quote the price will be locked in provided you pay the required deposit prior to the quote's expiry. Any reduced pricing or discounts that may become available after you have paid your deposit will not apply. If you wish to cancel your booking to take advantage of a cheaper price, full cancellation conditions apply. The most up to date pricing is available on our website. Prices are based on currency exchange rates as of June 2018; note that prices may vary depending on which currency the booking is made. We reserve the right to impose surcharges up to 56 days before departure due to unfavourable changes in exchange rates, increases in airfares or other transportation costs, increases in local operator costs, taxes, or if government action should require us to do so. In such instances, we will be responsible for any amount up to 2% of the trip price and you will be responsible for the balance. If any surcharge results in an increase of more than 10% of the trip price you may cancel the booking within 14 days of notification of the surcharge and obtain a full refund. Should the cost of your trip decrease by more than 2% due to the changes mentioned above then any refund due will be paid to you. Please note that travel arrangements are not always purchased in local currency and some apparent changes have no impact on the cost of your travel due to contractual and other protection in place. Air Passenger Duty is included in the price of your air inclusive trip. Please note that a surcharge may be applied to all purchases made by credit card.\n\n6.

We may cancel a trip at any time prior to departure if, due to terrorism, natural disasters, political instability or other external events it is not viable for us to operate the planned itinerary. If we cancel your trip, you can transfer amounts paid to an alternate departure date or receive a full refund. In circumstances where the cancellation is due to external events outside our reasonable control refunds will be less any unrecoverable costs.

All travellers under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a legal guardian, or in lieu of a legal guardian, by an escort over the age of 18, appointed by their legal guardian. The legal guardian or their designee will be responsible for the traveller under the age of 18's day to day care. If a legal guardian elects to designate an escort in their lieu, they will be required to complete and sign a relevant document, to delegate their authority.\n\nPlease note we cannot guarantee triple or adjoining rooms for families; accompanying adults may be required to share with others in the group on a twin share basis.\n\nVariations: A minimum age of 18 applies to many Overland adventures, while a lower minimum age applies to Family trips and Short Break Adventures. Please check with your consultant at the time of enquiry. All bookings for our Family trips must include a child under the age of 18.\n\nMaximum Age: For the majority of our trips we have no upper age limit though we remind you that our trips can be physically demanding and passengers must ensure that they are suitably fit to allow full participation. We are able to provide details on mandatory health requirements; however, we are not medical experts. It is your responsibility to ensure that you obtain proper and detailed medical advice at least two months prior to travel for the latest health requirements and recommendations for your destination.\n\nYou must be older than 18 years and younger than 30 years on day 1 of your trip to travel on our 18 to 29s Adventures.\n\nPre-existing medical conditions: If at the time of booking or at any time before departure you have a medical condition that may prevent you from participating fully in the trip, or may affect others on the trip, you must let us know as soon as possible. You will be required to provide evidence that this condition has been disclosed to your travel insurance company.\n\n13. Small groups & combination trips\n\nAt times we can have groups with small numbers of travellers. Many of our trips are designed to fit with other departures to create a longer \"combination\" trip; this means that some of your group may have already been travelling together for some weeks when you commence your trip. If you would like to know how many people are booked on your trip or any combination trip it is part of please ask prior to making your booking.\n\n14. Passport and visas\n\nYou must carry a valid passport and have obtained all of the appropriate visas, permits and certificates for the countries which you will visit during your trip. Your passport must be valid for 6 months beyond the duration of the trip. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in possession of the correct visas, permits and certificates for your trip; please refer to the Essential Trip Information for details. We are not responsible if you are refused entry to a country because you lack the correct passport, visa or other travel documentation.\n\n15. Travel insurance\n\nTravel insurance is mandatory for all our travellers and should be taken out at the time of booking. Your travel insurance must provide cover against personal accident, death, medical expenses and emergency repatriation with a recommended minimum coverage of US$200,000 for each of the categories of cover. We also strongly recommend it covers cancellation, curtailment, personal liability and loss of luggage and personal effects. You must provide your travel insurance policy number and the insurance company's 24 hour emergency contact number on the first day of your trip; you will not be able to join the trip without these details. We also require evidence that any medical conditions have been disclosed to your travel insurance company prior to the start of the trip. If you have travel insurance connected to your credit card or bank account please ensure you have details of the participating insurer, the insurance policy number and emergency contact number with you rather than the bank's name and credit card details.\n\n16. Flexibility\n\nYou appreciate and acknowledge that the nature of this type of travel requires considerable flexibility and you should allow for alternatives. The itinerary provided for each trip is representative of the types of activities contemplated, but it is understood that the route, schedules, itineraries, amenities and mode of transport may be subject to alteration without prior notice due to local circumstances or events.\n\n17. Change of itinerary\n\nWhile we endeavour to operate all trips as described we reserve the right to change the trip itinerary. Please refer to our website before departure for the most recent updates to your itinerary.\n\nBefore departure: If we make a major change we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible if there is time before departure. The definition of a major change is deemed to be a change affecting at least one day in five of the itinerary. When a major change is made you may choose between accepting the change, obtaining a refund of money paid on the land portion of the trip only or accepting an alternative tour offered.\n\nAfter departure: We reserve the right to change an itinerary after departure due to local circumstances or events outside of our control. In such emergency circumstances the additional cost of any necessary itinerary alterations will be covered by you. Please note we are not responsible for any incidental expenses that may be incurred as a result of the change of itinerary such as visas, vaccinations or non-refundable flights.\n\n18. Authority on tour\n\nOur group trips are run by a group leader. The decision of the group leader is final on all matters likely to affect the safety or well-being of any traveller or staff member participating in the trip. If you fail to comply with a decision made by a group leader, or interfere with the well-being or mobility of the group, the group leader may direct you to leave the trip immediately, with no right of refund. We may also elect not to carry you on any future trips booked. You must at all times comply with the laws, customs, foreign exchange and drug regulations of all countries visited, and you also agree to travel in accordance with our responsible travel guidelines.\n\n19. Acceptance of risk\n\nYou acknowledge that the nature of the trip is adventurous and participation involves a degree of personal risk. You will be visiting places where the political, cultural and geographical attributes present dangers and physical challenges greater than those present in our daily lives. We use information from government foreign departments and reports from our own contacts in assessing whether the itinerary should operate. However it is also your own responsibility to acquaint yourself with all relevant travel information and the nature of your itinerary. You acknowledge that your decision to travel is made in light of consideration of this information and you accept that you are aware of the personal risks attendant upon such travel.\n\n20. Limitation of liability\n\nWe will accept liability for the negligence of our staff or agents causing death or physical injury to persons or loss or damage to personal property only to the extent it is obliged under the applicable law. Our obligations, and those of our suppliers providing any service or facility included in your holiday, are to take reasonable skill and care to arrange for the provision of such services and facilities. This acceptance of liability is subject to clause c. below.\n\nIn other circumstances we are responsible to you for the proper performance of this contract. This acceptance of liability is subject to clause c. below.\n\nWe shall not be liable for any damage or loss if the failure to carry out the contract is:\n\nattributable to you.\n\nattributable to a third party unconnected with the provision of the services contracted for and the event is unforeseeable or unavoidable.\n\ndue to unforeseen and unusual circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had to be exercised.\n\ndue to political disputes, border closures, refusal of visas, industrial action, climate or other matters of a similar nature and any other force majeure.\n\ndue to an event which the Company, even with all due care, could not foresee or forestall.\n\nExcept in cases involving death, injury or illness, any liability covered under clause b. above is limited to3 times the price paid. In the case of damaged property the liability is limited to a maximum amount equal to the amount paid by or on behalf of the owner of the property. In all cases the Company specifically excludes all liability for indirect or consequential loss or expense including loss of profits and in all cases our liability will be limited in accordance with and/or in an identical manner to the contractual terms of the companies that provide the transportation for your travel arrangements.\n\nWhere your trip arrangements involve travel by air, rail or sea, or hotel accommodation, the compensation is limited by the following international conventions respectively: Warsaw Convention as amended 1955, Bern Convention 1961, Athens Convention 1974 and Paris Convention 1962. We are to be regarded as having all benefit of any limitation of right to claim or compensation contained in these or any conventions..\n\nour acceptance of liability in clauses a and b above is subject to assignment by you of your rights against any agent, supplier or sub-contractor which is in any way responsible for the unsatisfactory arrangements or your death or personal injury.\n\nFlight Notice, Flight Information and EU Blacklist.\n\nThis is a notice required by European Community Regulation (EC) No.889/2002. This notice cannot be used as a basis for a claim for compensation, nor to interpret the provisions of the Regulation or the Montréal Convention, and it does not form part of the contract between the carrier(s), us and you, nor part of a claim. No representation is made by the carrier(s) or us as to the accuracy of the contents of this notice.\n\nAir carrier liability for passengers and their baggage:\n\nThis information notice summarises the liability rules applied by Community air carriers as required by Community legislation and the Montréal Convention.\n\nCompensation in the case of death or injury: There are no financial limits to the liability for passenger injury or death. For damages up to 100,000 SDRs (approximately £80,000 / €120,000) the air carrier cannot contest claims for compensation. Above that amount, the air carrier can defend itself against a claim by proving that it was not negligent or otherwise at fault.\n\nAdvance payments: If a passenger is killed or injured, the air carrier must make an advance payment, to cover immediate economic needs, within 15 days from the identification of the person entitled to compensation. In the event of death, this advance payment shall not be less than 16000 SDRs (approximately £13,000 /€19,300).\n\nPassenger delays: In case of passenger delay, the air carrier is liable for damage unless it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or it was impossible to take such measures. The liability for passenger delay is limited to 4150 SDRs (approximately £3,300 / €5,000).\n\nBaggage delays: In case of baggage delay, the air carrier is liable for damage unless it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or it was impossible to take such measures. The liability for baggage delay is limited to 1000 SDRs (approximately £800/€1,200).\n\nDestruction, loss or damage to baggage: The air carrier is liable for destruction, loss or damage to baggage up to 1000 SDRs (approximately £800) In the case of checked baggage, it is liable even if not at fault, unless the baggage was defective. In the case of unchecked baggage, the carrier is liable only if at fault.\n\nHigher limits for baggage: A passenger can benefit from a higher liability limit by making a special declaration at the latest at check-in and by paying a supplementary fee.\n\nComplaints on baggage: If the baggage is damaged, delayed, lost or destroyed, the passenger must write and complain to the air carrier as soon as possible. In the case of damage to checked baggage, the passenger must write and complain within seven days, and in the case of delay within 21 days, in both cases from the date on which the baggage was placed at the passenger's disposal.\n\nLiability of contracting and actual carriers: If the air carrier actually performing the flight is not the same as the contracting air carrier, the passenger has the right to address a complaint or to make a claim for damages against either. If the name or code of an air carrier is indicated on the ticket, that air carrier is the contracting air carrier.\n\nTime limit for action: Any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of arrival of the aircraft, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived.\n\nBasis for the information. The basis for the rules described above is the Montreal Convention of 28 May 1999, which is implemented in the Community by Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97 (as amended by Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002) and national legislation of the Member States.\n\nIn accordance with EU directive (EC) no. 2111/2005, Article 9, we are required to bring to your attention the existence of a ‘Community list' which contains details of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban within the EU Community. The Community list is available for inspection at www.air-ban.europa.eu. In accordance with EU Regulation 2111/2005 we are required to advise you of the actual carrier operating your flight/connecting flight/transfer. We do this by listing carriers to be used or likely to be used on our confirming documents. The airline may use wide and narrow-body jets. Any changes to the actual airline after you have received your tickets will be notified to you as soon as possible and in all cases at check-in or at the boarding gate.\n\n21. Optional activities\n\nOptional activities not included in the trip price do not form part of the trip or this contract. You accept that any assistance given by your group leader or local representative in arranging optional activities does not render us liable for them in any way. The contract for the provision of that activity will be between you and activity provider.\n\n22. Claims & complaints\n\nIf you have a complaint about your trip please inform your group leader or our local representative at the time in order that they can attempt to rectify the matter.
