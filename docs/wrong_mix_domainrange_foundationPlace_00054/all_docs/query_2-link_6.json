Moreover, with the rapid growth in population and urbanization, there is an increasing demand for energy. Therefore, energy consumption management has become a crucial aspect of modern society.\n\nWith the advancement of technology, several solutions can be developed with the use of wireless sensors, Home Area Network (HAN) devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nIoT networks are proven to be very successful when it comes to monitoring and controlling tasks in several applications like smart homes and buildings, e-health, etc. A smart home is a residence that uses IoT technology to automate various systems and appliances, including lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) [1].\n\nTherefore, this technology is utilized to monitor the unnecessary consumption of electricity in buildings and helps in controlling smart appliances remotely. For example, smart lighting can turn off when a room is unoccupied, and appliances can be automatically switched off when not in use. This results in optimized energy consumption and saving money on utility bills for smart home users. An illustration of a technology-enabled smart home is shown in Figure 1.\n\nImprove efficiency and reduce consumption\n\nFurthermore, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the technology that enables machines to learn and think like humans, smart home energy management solutions can be made even more efficient by analyzing patterns in energy consumption and providing insights to help reduce energy waste.\n\nThe use of AI has become a popular solution to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption. This is done using IoT-enabled appliances in smart homes, which have sensors that gather data on energy consumption and then use that data to optimize energy usage. AI can analyze this data to identify patterns in energy use and make recommendations for optimizing energy usage while considering the user’s comfort [2].\n\nFor instance, a smart thermostat can adjust the temperature in a home based on occupancy and outdoor temperature, reducing energy usage when no one is home or when it is unnecessary to maintain a specific temperature.\n\nSmart homes can also be integrated with renewable energy systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, to help reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. AI can optimize the use of renewable energy by predicting when the most energy will be generated and then using that energy when it is most needed.\n\nLook to Copenhagen!\n\nBeyond smart homes, AI can also be used to optimize energy consumption in commercial buildings, such as office buildings and shopping centres. When implemented on a large scale, AI is also playing a critical role in the development of sustainable smart cities. These cities use cutting-edge technologies and infrastructure to improve the quality of life for residents while reducing their environmental impact.\n\nAI can help manage the energy consumption of entire communities by analyzing data from sensors and devices and using predictive models to forecast energy demand and optimize energy distribution.\n\nFor instance, AI can be used to analyze patterns of energy consumption in different parts of the city and adjust the distribution of energy accordingly. This can help balance the load on the energy grid, reduce energy waste, and lower costs.\n\nOne example of smart city implementation is Copenhagen which began to use AI to optimize its heating system [3]. The system uses AI to analyze weather patterns and optimize heating in buildings, reducing energy consumption by a significant amount.\n\nWhat are the challenges?\n\nThe future of AI-enabled energy management solutions at the smart home and city level is very bright. One key advantage of AI in energy management is its ability to learn and adapt over time. As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms become more accurate, enabling more effective energy management. This is particularly important in the context of smart cities, where the volume of data generated can be enormous. AI can help manage this data and make sense of it, providing insights that can inform energy policies and infrastructure planning.\n\nThe benefits of using AI in energy management bring some challenges as well. One of the main challenges is ensuring data privacy and security. The use of AI involves collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, and this data might contain sensitive information about users in smart homes.\n\nMoreover, the users also become less willing to share their home energy consumption data with the service providers. However, this challenge can be mitigated with the use of an edge computing framework with AI technology [4]. Edge computing framework does not require the sharing of users’ data with the central server. It processes the data at end users and performs intelligent decisions.\n\nAnother challenge is the need for interoperability between different systems and devices when it is extended over the smart city level. Thus, it requires the development of common standards and protocols to ensure interoperability and compatibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of AI in energy management has the potential to transform the way we use and manage energy. With the ongoing success of smart homes, researchers and experts are now looking to apply AI to larger areas such as smart cities. The use of AI in smart cities has the potential to be transformative in terms of sustainable energy management. While there are challenges that need to be addressed, AI can play a critical role in building a sustainable future for upcoming generations.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Alam, M.R., Reaz, M.B.I. and Ali, M.A.M., 2012.

From the stage in Halden, she led the audience through some examples of her fascination with AI – and some of the challenges.\n\n– The better we make machines at explaining themselves, the better we will make them in justifying themselves. I don’t want to enter a future where machines are excellent at justifying bad decisions.\n\nMagnus Carlsen and SHAP\n\nShe also gave a glimpse of the complexity of explainable AI (XAI).\n\n– You cannot test your way to understanding a sizeable machine-learning model because of the Curse of Dimensionality, which refers to a set of problems that arise when working with high-dimensional data.\n\nStrümke also presented a vast problem that, although she has been researching it for several years, she considers as a possible unsolvable problem: Machines will model non-human concepts.\n\nIn addition, chess players like Magnus Carlsen and Garry Kasparov, stop signs and speed limit signs, and SHAP (a mathematical method for explaining predictions of machine learning models) are among the elements in Strümke’s presentation.\n\nWhy attend AI+ 2023?\n\nThe AI+ Media Team asked Dr Strümke a few questions after her speech. One of them was “Who would you like to see on stage or in the audience at AI+ 2023?”, and this is what she answered:\n\nGlenn Henriksen argued in his speech that we expect a higher level of precision from machines and computers than we do from humans. Is this fair, or are we forsaking efficiency for no good reason?\n\nBy Lars Johannessen, May 12, 2022\n\nHead of Technology and System Development at Justify, Glenn Henriksen gave us an interesting look into the use of artificial intelligence in processing legal forms and documents. He set the scene by proclaiming that Justify aim to make law accessible for more people. In terms of being able to understand, but more importantly by making it cheaper. The way to do this, according to Glenn, is by scaling without adding more humans to the tasks, and this is where AI comes in. Software and machine learning have the potential to free up a lot of time that is spent on reviewing standardized forms and documents. There is however a challenge connected to this, and that is that humans can make errors and fill out forms wrongly in an almost infinite number of ways.\n\nRead more and see the pictures fraom day 1!\n\nThis poses a challenge for AI and machine learning because there can suddenly be an error in a document that is unlike anything the software has seen or trained on. Glenn went on to explain that perhaps this is not the greatest issue after all.\n\n– Ok, so let us say it (the software) discovers an anomaly. We will have it flag that document and send it over to a human who can go through it. The software goes back to processing thousands of documents, and the human resource will go through the few ones that are flagged, Glenn explained.\n\nThis led to the point that Glenn was making, we want our software to be without flaw, when we know that humans are not. If we expect ai and machine learned software to be perfect right out the gate, we might be let down. Glenn summarized it by saying “Ai is overestimated in short term, and underestimated long term.”. Ai and machine learning works best over time, with substantial amounts of data to train on, so the best way to do this is to start using them.\n\nDay two of AI+ started with two parallel sessions taking place simultaneously – AI for beginners at Brygga kultursal, and AI for experts at Institute For Energy technology (IFE). Ruth Astrid Sæter, the hostess of this years AI+ conference opened the session at Brygga kultursal and introduced Karl-Magnus Haugen, CEO at airMont to the stage for his talk on how simple, stupid data becomes intelligent with AI.\n\nAt the same time in IFE’s auditorium, Division Director for Digital systems at IFE, Tomas Norlander welcomed the audience who joined the AI for experts session welcome and gave a short introduction to his background in AI and IFE’s history in regards to nuclear science and use of AI. Tomas then invited Alexandre de Oliviera e Sousa, Solutions Manager at Cognite AS to take the floor for his talk on AI in industrial context.\n\nThe two sessions the continued in parallel until lunch was served. The AI for beginners crowd got to hear Jan Erik Gausdal, senior advisor at Eye-share, talk about “How can AI simplify accounting tasks in your business?”, followed by Associate Professor at Østfold University College, Lars Vidar Magnusson explain AI in “Top-down image analysis”. Elisabeth Haugsbø, Head of Data at HUB Ocean, rounded of the session by explaining how “Data grooming for AI” is done.\n\nThe audience at AI for experts was treated to affiliated professor at Arcada University of Applied Sciences, Roberto V. Zicari’s talk on “Trust and AI”. He was followed by Jørgen Torgersen, CTO of Railway Robotics, and Christian Svalesen, Data Scientist at BearingPoint, talk about their project “AI for railway maintenance”. Andreas Risvaag, full-stadd developer at Heimdall Power finished the expert session with his talk on “A startup approach to AI for power grid efficiency” and how AI is used in preventing breaks and issues in the power grid.\n\nPost lunch was opened by Henrik Fagerholt, Product Manager at Gyldendal Rettsdata, talk about “Lawyers, Law Tech and AI”. Henrik was followed by Dr. Inga Strümke, XAI researcher, TEDx speaker, and Particle Physicist at NTNU deliver an entertaining and somewhat unnerving talk on explainable AI. Inga stated that “Machines might be, and probably are, modelling non-human concepts”, and that self-driving cars have been proven to be mislead by pieces of tape strategically placed on stop signs, making them read it as a speed limit signs instead. Following Inga was Glenn Henriksen, focusing on the possibilities of AI in processing legal documents and regulations for AI.\n\nAs the last speaker, Torgeir Andrew Waterhouse, Founder and Partner at Otte, took the stage to deliver his views on “Security and society” and AI. Torgeir gave an enthralling speech on how we could merge democracy, economy, autonomy, and technology into our daily lives. He also pointed out that the need for cyber security has never been greater, and that we as society need to be more aware of this.\n\n– One in four leaders think that they cannot be exposed to cyber-attacks. One in four leaders needs to leave their job, Torgeir proclaimed.\n\nThe day ended with a panel debate consisting of Torgeir Waterhouse, Elisabeth Haugsbø, Henrik Fagerholt, and Dr. Inga Strümke. The panel debated issues related to how AI will affect society, how we as humans should relate to AI and machine learning software and answered questions from the audience. A long day of captivating talks, inspiring ideas, and some possible spine-chilling outcomes of AI marked the end of this year’s AI+ conference. We hope to see you again in Halden for next year’s conference!\n\nBy walking across the stage, the robot dog Spot showed artificial intelligence in practice and made everyone in Brygga kultursal stretch their necks as he entered the spotlight at the first day of the AI+ conference.\n\nBy Anja Lillerud, May 4, 2022\n\nSitting together with the AI+ 2022 hostess Ruth Astrid Sæther on the stage sofa, Nils-Ola Widme from Abelia and Annita Fjuk from Digital Norway which were the speakers to enter the podium after the opening speech held by Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, were informed that they would receive a special gift from an even more special gift presenter.\n\nFrom the side of the stage, a blue robot dog entered the spotlight carrying two books on his back. As this is not an everyday sight even for AI enthusiasts, the four-legged robot got everyone’s attention while crossing the scene towards the three people on the sofa.\n\n– Please welcome Spot, Sæther said.\n\nThe robot dog is developed by Boston Dynamics and Spot is a platform which Institute of Energy Technology (IFE) uses in research projects. IFE is also one of the initiators to the AI+ conference together with Smart Innovation Norway, eSmart Systems, Halden kommune and Cluster for Applied AI.\n\nHistorical soldiers and modern technology\n\nThis year’s conference is the third in a row, but it is the first full scale hybrid version with live audience. Halden is of course the place with Brygga kultursal as the conference venue surrounded by the historical city square and the harbor and protected by the Fredriksten fortress on top of the hill southeast of the city center.\n\nA pre-opening of the conference took place on Monday with the social event AI & Beer where associated professor at Østfold University College, Henrik Skaug Sætra, talked about AI for the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHistorically dressed, the Fredrikshald Borgerbevæpning welcomed the guests standing in the sunshine outside the venue Tuesday morning. Fredrikshald Borgerbevæpning is an organization driven by volunteers aiming to preserve and bring the history of this civilian force which guarded the city from 1644 until 1881, to life.\n\nThe historical soldiers were a nice contrast to the subject of the two-day AI+ conference – the modern and rapidly growing technology of applied artificial intelligence.\n\nWide range of speakers\n\nAfter a cultural kick off with the percussionist Aleksander Kostopoulos who gave the audience a really wakening performance both visually and audially, the Mayor of Halden Anne-Kari Holm wished everyone a warm welcome to the town, and the Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre held the opening speech digitally.\n\nStøre spoke warmly about the national AI network and the importance of Norway keeping track of the AI development.\n\nThroughout the day, speakers from Equinor, Digital Norway, Inmeta, Microsoft, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Chronos, Seidr, AI clinic, Oslo university hospital, Kristiania University College, Østfold University College, University of New South Wales in Sydney, Elhub, Abelia and VNNOR held presentations within some of the five topics of this year’s conference:\n\nSmart City and mobility\n\nAI enabled techonoly\n\nSecurity, ethics and regulations\n\nEnvironment and sustainability\n\nEnergy\n\nFrom speeches to dinner\n\nAt lunch, the participants had a short walk through the southern part of the town to eat in Haldens Klub, Norway’s oldest eatery of their kind established in October 1786.\n\nThe second part of day 1 began with a second performance by percussionist Aleksander Kostopoulos, and 4,5 hours later, when host Ruth Astrid Sæther wrapped the day up and wished everyone a nice evening, members from Fredrikshald Borgervæpning were ready to give a historical guided tour through the city center.\n\nDuring the afternoon, the conference venue got rearranged turned into a fantastic dining area with great decorations. The first day of AI+ 2022 ended with a pre-drink, a three-course dinner, speeches, and entertainment.\n\nThe AI film “Ex Machina” was shown at the Halden cinema theatre after an initiative taken by AI+.\n\nAround 200 people attended the first day physically and about 100 people watched it digitally, and day 2 offers several interesting presentations and new meetings between people.\n\nOne of today’s most long-term and desirable business resource is data. For decades, Norwegian companies have collected and stored data, and with AI as a constantly and rapidly growing technology, we finally have the tools to utilize much of the large amount of stored data.\n\nBy Anja Lillerud, May 2, 2022\n\nNorway and Norwegian industry are in a unique position regarding the scale of data accessible. Only five years ago, the focus both politically and industrially was Norwegian investments in AI and AI research.\n\nAlready then Director Azure Cloud & AI Jon Jahren at Microsoft Norway questioned the direction of Norwegian AI development.\n\n– Practically all the algorithms you will need are already open-sourced and the cloud vendors are making them increasingly easy to use, so that’s not where the real value lies, he explains.\n\nHence, Norwegian companies should concentrate on collecting data and utilize it in the best possible way instead of using resources on developing their own algorithms.\n\n– The data is the gold of any company. Be sure to secure the business gold and let the major tech vendors handle and develop AI, says Jahren.\n\nHow to become data-driven\n\nIn recent years, more and more companies have been aware of the importance and value of their data, and they have tended to change the use of their data resources and their approach to AI.\n\nAt Microsoft’s AI business school, they sum up the journey to become a data-driven organization in three bullet points:\n\nFocus on being a data-driven company\n\nImplement it through an including and joint change of the business’ culture\n\nThe use of AI must be responsible and ethical\n\n– The first bullet point is about being aware of the data you collect and how it can be utilized. It’s also a matter of making the necessary tools needed to implement the change available in the organization, explains Jahren.\n\nAdopting AI\n\nAnother challenge Microsoft faces, is the different industries’ and managers’ fear of the unknown. And even though AI increasingly has become a public domain the last years, it is still unfamiliar to numerous people.\n\nThe fear relates not only to one’s own competence, but also to the risk by using AI. Issues regarding ethics and privacy are highlighted, not because of the privacy itself, but because of the AI solution and whether it is secure enough.\n\nOne of Microsoft’s major tasks is the work they are doing on developing tools which are using explainable AI. Towards the customers, the algorithms in explainable AI can explain the choices that were made along the way and what is the reasoning behind the result.\n\nAnother important task to solve, is what is called differential privacy. In an ideal world, it is possible to build AI models from person sensitive data without the algorithm identifying the data. As an example, Norwegian health organizations have thousands of registers containing valuable data who when being ran through an algorithm can reveal patterns and correlations that humans are unable to see.\n\n– We know there are information hidden in the data that can avert serious illness and improve patient predictions. But as of now, we don’t how to use the data and AI while at the same time ensuring privacy, says Jahren.\n\nA third challenge to handle, is confidential computing. If you need to store or share personal information, you need a secure way to do so. When using a cloud, you must be sure that the cloud supplier under any circumstances doesn’t have an opportunity to access your information. Such solutions are becoming much cheaper and easier to use contributing to an increased adoption of AI into businesses.\n\n– Solving issues like these mentioned, is probably one of the most important contributions from Microsoft, says Jahren.\n\n– Responsible AI is important\n\nSince both trust and reliability are important elements for succeeding a transformation and for adopting AI in an organization, Microsoft have created their own principles and adheres to them to ensure that their AI is responsible.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, AI must be:\n\nFair and unbiased\n\nReliable and safe\n\nInclusive\n\nTransparent\n\nAccountable\n\nAssuring privacy and security\n\nBecause of these principles, Microsoft decides to reject some projects. This is to preserve their integrity. In some cases, the large international company requires a declaration from their AI users to allow them to download the software.\n\n– We cannot control everything and everyone, but by setting clear ethical considerations for usage, we express our opinion and make the user aware of the purpose of the algorithm, says Jahren.\n\n– AI brings new opportunities to mankind\n\nThe last decade, AI has become more public, but we are still in the starting pit. The Director Azure Cloud & AI at Microsoft Norway is excited to be a part of the era.\n\n– This new technology brings new opportunities to mankind. The algorithms have become so sophisticated and detailed that they solve issues just as good or even better than humans. Humanity is experiencing a boost by AI enabled applications that I find exciting, says Jon Jahren.\n\nAnd because of AI being a commonplace, he knows Microsoft will face new and more challenging tasks.\n\nAI is surrounding us and affecting our everyday life, hence there exists a wide range of expectations regarding AI and functionality in the society. The bank customers expect AI solutions to make their bank relation easier and more secure. At home you deal with AI software in your robotic vacuum cleaner and refrigerator.\n\n– There is an anticipation regarding both the functionality of our products and that we offer products solving the tasks that the consumers or businesses need to be solved. This must be done without causing a major competence gap in the market, so it is accessible for a wide audience of developers and users. The days when AI was related only to PhDs in white overcoats are gone, says Jon Jahren."
