Thank you everyone. Dan Mazur reports live from basecamp.\n\nThis is Dan Mazur calling with the final dispatch from our spring climbing season. I am currently in Everest/Lhotse basecamp and all of our members and staff are down from the hill. It's a beautiful sunny day here. There are a few puffy clouds, light winds, crystal clear blue skies, and birds are flying around hovering on the air currents. As I speak to you I am looking up at Mount Everest and the mighty Khumbu Glacier Icefall, which looks like an enourmous frozen river of white diamonds. Occasionally an avalanche pops off from one of the subsidiary peaks which ring this corrie our basecamp lies within. These avalanches are noisy and impressive, but luckily they never touch basecamp.\n\nThis year we were blessed with great success. I am very thankful, and perhaps even a bit surprised with how lucky we were. Of course, the maxim: 'good luck follows hard work' might hold true in this case.\n\nMany of our team members, men and women from around the world, climbed to the top of Everest, our world's highest mountain, as well as to the summit of Lhotse, the fourth highest, and thank god we had no serious accidents.\n\nEveryone tried very hard and achieved their personal goals, whether that was trekking to basecamp, or achieving a personal high point, such as the summit of easy Island Peak, or getting up to high camp on Everest or Lhotse. We commend all of our team members on doing their very best.\n\nThis is SummitClimb. A lot of very dedicated staff and a great team in basecamp (Dan Mazur).\n\nWe faced a lot of challenges this year, especially with the closure of Tibet due to the Chinese Olympic torch parade on Everest.\n\nHowever, our members, leaders, and staff showed the patience, flexibility, and determination which good mountaineers need, and we made the best of the season.\n\n4 of our Members reached the summit of Lhotse, the world's fourth highest peak.\n\nWe placed the First Dutchman on the summit of Lhotse, and the first Greek on the summit of Lhotse.\n\n4 of our sherpas climbed to the summit of Lhotse.\n\nWe had excellent expedition leadership from Arnold Coster and Sam Mansikka.\n\nWell, thanks for listening and watching and for your great support. Please tell all of your adventurous friends to join our fun teams of men and women from around the world. Our company survives on word-of-mouth.\n\nThis is Dan Mazur from SummitClimb.com signing off. I will look forward to a chance to chat with all of you and meet you soon. So please send me an email, or give a phone call. Ok thank you very much, and Bye for now!\n\nPs. Please remember to check out our leader-in-training program. We are always trying to get new leaders to join SummitClimb.com . Thanks!\n\nPps. Would you like to receive a colour Himalayan postcard? Please send us your postal address so we may post one to you or any of your friends and family interested in trekking and climbing. Thank you. back to top\n\nUpcoming Trips-\n\nWe try to keep the momentum going here at SummitClimb, so I would like to mention a few upcoming trips:\n\nWe are now working toward our July trip to Mustagata, the world's easiest 7500 metre, 25,000 foot peak, which is perfect for snowshoeing, skiing, racquetting, and snowboarding. The leader is Mustagata expert Jon Otto, who has climbed it 8 times and speaks fluent English and Chinese. There is still time to join our team of men and women from around the world, if you hurry. Climbing Mustagata would qualify you for Mount Everest (photo right by Brad Jackson: Mustagata seen from acclimatization camp at 3600 metres/11,800 feet with Karakul Lake reflecting the mountain).\n\nThis is Kristine O'Brien and Gary Kellund resting at camp 2, 6200 metres/20,300 feet on Mustagata (K. O'Brien and G. Kellund). Our all female team, the \"Lipstick Blondes\" from the UK, in between camp 1 and camp 2 on Mustagata (www.lipstickblondes.com).\n\nFor the autumn, in September we encourage you to join us on Cho Oyu , the world's sixth highest and most accessible of the fourteen highest mountains, known as 8000 metre, 26,000 foot high mountains. Cho Oyu is located beside Mount Everest. Also in September we offer an expedition to Shishapangma, the lowest of the 8000 metre peaks, and located next to Cho Oyu. The leaders will be me, Dan Mazur and Samuli Mansikka, both of whom have multiple ascents of Cho Oyu, Shishapangma, and Everest. We are relaxed friendly and very competent and safe leaders. This is our 8th Cho Oyu expedition and our 3rd Shishapangma expedition. So please let us know and come on and join our fun group of men and women from around the world. Doing these climbs would qualify you for Mt. Everest. Oh by the way, we heard a rumour that a few members might want to ski these. Wow, that might be something to watch.\n\nCho Oyu at sunset. Our team at ABC on Shishapangma leaving for camp 1 (Dan Mazur).\n\nIn October, we offer the exciting climb of 7000 metre, 23,000 foot high, Mount Ama Dablam, known as Asia's most famous rock, ice, and snow peak. It's a technical mountain, but very climbable. We fix rope from camp 1 to the summit, and the hardest move is French 4, British severe, or North American 5.7 . Our leader is Summit Climb expert and all around nice guy Arnold Coster. This is our 12th Ama Dablam expedition and we have had great success with this peak. It's a really fun and accomplishable technical climb, there is no snow-slogging as basecamp is on grass. This has become a very popular climb for technical climbers who want to test their skills safely at altitude. So please come on and join our fun group of men and women from around the world. Climbing Ama Dablam would qualify you for Mt. Everest.\n\nSean Foxcroft, our leader in training from Manchester, shows us you don't always have to pull on the rope as he frees the Yellow Tower on Ama Dablam (Dan Mazur).\n\nWell, I could go on about exciting trips we have coming up in spring of 2009 like Lhakpa-Ri and the North-Col for those who want to try their hand at 7000 metre, 23,000 foot high peak climbing, get qualified for Mt Everest, or perhaps even transition right to Mount Everest or Cho Oyu immediately afterward. This has become a very popular trip for us. back to top\n\nSummit photos on Lhotse 2008.

This unknown team decided it would be best to walk through the ice-fall roped together in lock-step, just one metre apart. Hmmmm, we are not sure this is such a good idea (video by Diane Walker)? Everest closed? Everest closed !?!? On 6 May, this enormous Russian-made Nepal-Air-Force helicopter landed in basecamp and 12 troops and dignitaries spewed out to make warning speeches about international security and sweep basecamp and inspect all of the tents for illegal communications equipment, flags, etcetera. Everest remained closed to climbers from 1-8 May while the Chinese Olympic torch team went to the summit. Our sincere thanks to the Nepal-Air-Force for their professional conduct during this difficult situation and for their assistance in air-evacuating one of our sherpas who suffered an apparent stroke on the way to camp 1 (video by John Shelton-Smith).\n\nLadder crossing\n\nDiane Walker films Stefanos Voutselas crossing a treacherous ladder in the Khumbu Icefall.\n\nSherpa dance\n\nEven some of the strongest sherpas in the world need to have a ceremony before heading off to climb Everest. Here our super-star climbing sherpas shake a leg at our puja ceremony before heading up to the summit to help our team members get to to the top and back down safely (video John Shelton-Smith).\n\nDescending ladders\n\nStefanos Voutselas films Les Williams descending the big scary 3-section ladder at the top of the Khumbu Ice-fall.\n\nback to top\n\n30 May, 2008\n\nHere is a translated Finnish and Dutch report from our international team members telling the events of summit day on Lhotse (27 May, 2008):\n\nFinnish translation:\n\nTerveisia Everest/Lhotse –perusleirista, jossa Summitclimbin Lhotse 2008 –retkikunta vetelee viimeisiaan.\n\nSaavutimme Lhotsen 8516-metrisen huipun eilen 27.5 klo 8:00 Herman Kristenin (Hollanti), Ron Hoglinin (Kanada), Thilen (Nepal), sirdarimme Jangbun (Nepal), seka toisen Jangun kanssa.\n\nSaavuimme perusleiriin 3.5 ja aloitimme akklimatisoitumisen ja leirienperustamisen 6.5 pitamamme Puja-seremonian jalkeen. Viimeisen rypistyksen huipulle aloitimme 23.5 nousemalla kakkoseen, jossa pidimme lepopaivan ennen, kuin 25.5 nousimme kolmoseen 7000 metriin. 26.5 kiipesimme Lhotse-ylaleiriimme 7800 metriin, jossa lepailimme ennen, kuin keskiyolla aloitimme kiipeamisen kohti Lhotse-kuluaaria.\n\nHuippuyo oli upea ja saa taydellinen! Kuluaarin huippua lahestyessamme puuskainen tuuli tosin lisaantyi. Saa oli kirkas, joten maisemat avautuivat upeasti, mita korkeammalle kiipesimme.\n\nSaavutimme pikkuruisen, lumisen huipun klo 8:00 ja paasimme kurkistamaan vuoren toiselle puolelle Lhotsen jattimaisen etela-seinan paalta. Kirkkaassa saassa naimme Kanghenjungalle ja Shisha-Pangmalle saakka puhumattakaan lahempana sijaitsevista Makalusta, Cho Oyusta ja Everestista.\n\nNautimme kauniista saasta ja nakymista puolisen tuntia ennen, kuin laskeuduimme jyrkkaa Lhotse-kuluaaria takaisin ylaleiriimme. Laskeuduimme viela samana paivana kakkoseen, josta saavuimme perusleiriin eilen 28.5.\n\nNyt viela perusleirin pakkaamista ja kolmen paivan trekki Luklaan, josta lennamme Katmanduun.\n\nUskon, etta kaikki retkikuntamme jasenet ovat tyytyvaisia nopeaan reagointiin, joka johti Lhotsen-matkan toteutumiseen kevaan Cho Oyun –retkikunnan peruunnuttua. Itse ainakin olen ja voin todella suositella Lhotsea – On huikeaa kokea Everestin ensinousunreitti, jolta poiketa kiipeamaan yksi upeimmista kiipeamistani kuluaareista!\n\nKiitos kaikille, jotka seurasivat paivityksia Summitclimb.com ‘News’ –sivuilla!\n\nSamuli Mansikka\n\nExpedition Leader\n\nSummitclimb International Lhotse Expedition 2008 back to top\n\nSamuli Mansikka, the second Finn atop the summit of Lhotse (Herman Kristen). Tile and Jangbu Sherpa atop the summit of Lhotse (Sam Mansikka).\n\n...\n\nDutch translation:\n\nEerste Nederlander op de top van Lhotse (8516m)\n\nOp 27 mei om 8:00 is Herman Kristen (40) de eerste Nederlander die de top van Lhotse (8516m) heeft bereikt. “Het is ongelofelijk om in 2008 als eerste Nederlander op de top van 1 van de 14 achtduizenders te staan. Vanwege de demonstraties in Tibet, ben ik uitgeweken naar Nepal. Normaal gesproken had ik een van de makkelijkst te beklimmen achtduizender Cho Oyu (8201m) beklommen, maar i..p.v. daarvan is het LhotseLhotseMt. Everest staat en lang niet dezelfde uitstraling heeft als Mt. Everest. Mt. Everest beklimmers beschouwen Lhotse zelfs zwaarxer dan Everest, vanwege onder meer.de steile wanden tot wel 55-60 graden. Chinezen bedankt!” is een geweldig mooie berg, maar helaas maar weinig beklommen. Waarschijnlijk omdat Lhotse in de schaduw van geworden. back to top\n\nView from the top of Lhotse. That's Lhotse middle in the foreground. Lhotse middle was the highest unclimbed peak in the world up to a few years ago. In the background is Makalu (Samuli Mansikka).\n\n27 May, 2008\n\nLhotse team summits! The Lhotse team just radioed. They all summitted. The weather is calm and sunny. We wish them a safe descent.\n\nSam reports in live (click here to listen)\n\nHello everyone. It’s Sam Mansikka, the leader of SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition 2008 calling on the 27th of May at around 11:00 a.m.\n\nI’m really happy to tell you that we’ve just returned from the summit. Ron Hoglin, Herman Kristen, and I, as well as our sherpas, Jangbu 1 and Jangbu 2, all summited at around 8:00 a.m. Oh man, we had the most beautiful summit day. The views were so clear that we could see all of the way to Shishapangma, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga. Jangbu said that we could see all of the way to Tingri in Tibet and Namche Bazaar in Nepal.\n\nWe are back safely in our high camp now at 7800 metres/25,600 feet and our plan is to get down to camp 2 today. Tomorrow we will continue the rest of the descent to basecamp. For basecamp festivities, we’re looking forward to taking showers and eating pizza and other delicacies. We might even open a few pints of beer too.\n\nI’ll call you when we get back to basecamp and tell you more about the climb we did today. For right now, I can say it’s a very beautiful and steep climb up the Lhotse Couloir. The summit is fantastic, small and pointy, with the greatest views of all of the surrounding mountains.\n\nThis was Sam and SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition 2008 with summiters Ron Hoglin, Herman Kristen, and the 2 Jangbus. Bye, bye. back to top\n\nRon Hoglin, the second Canadian atop the summit of Lhotse (Sam Mansikka). Herman Kristen, the first Dutchman atop the summit of Lhotse (Sam Mansikka).\n\n26 May, 2008\n\nLhotse team heading for the summit!\n\nSam reports in live (click here to listen)\n\nHello everyone. It’s Sam calling for SummitClimb news on the 26th of May.\n\nI’m in Lhotse high camp with Canadian Ron Hoglin and the Dutchman Herman Kristen, as well as our three sherpas. We’re feeling pretty good and the weather looks promising, so we’re planning on leaving for the summit at 11:00 pm this evening. We aim to reach the summit right after sunrise.\n\nI heard that there were 6 summits on Lhotse this morning, so I’m pretty sure we’ll have a solid trail to follow and a good chance of making it to the summit.\n\nI’ll call back either from the summit or the high camp after the summit push. This was Sam for SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition 2008. Bye. back to top\n\nWe could not make this climb without the icefall doctors, who maintain the treacherous route of wobbly ladders spanning gaping crevasses through the khumbu icefall. Here are two of six doctors: l-r dampe tamang, and ang kami sherpa (Dan Mazur).\n\n25 May, 2008\n\nLhotse group moving up to camp 4. Summit attempt day after.\n\nSam reports in live (click here to listen)\n\nHello everyone. This is Sam calling from Everest/Lhotse camp 3 at 7000 metres/23,000 feet on May 25th.\n\nThe summit push is on. I’m here with the Dutchman Herman, Canadian Ron, and our awesome sherpas Jangbu 1 and Jangbu 2. The weather is nice. It has been a bit cloudy, but they roll away every once in a while, giving the most beautiful views of Pumori and Nuptse.\n\nOur master plan is to climb up to camp 4 tomorrow pretty early, so we get a good rest once we’re up there. We’re drinking some water, having some snacks, and just resting before we start the final push to reach the summit of Lhotse, 4th highest mountain on Earth. We might start as early as 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. so that we make it up to the summit by sunrise.\n\nRight now the weather looks very good and I’m pretty sure we will climb up to camp 4 tomorrow. So if everything goes well we might be summiting on the 27th very early in the morning. I’ll let you know more when we climb up to camp 4 tomorrow.\n\nThis was Sam from SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition 2008. I’ll get back to you soon. Bye. back to top\n\nOur awesome 2008 international Lhotse team (Les Williams).\n\nIan de Bruyn crossing a ladder in the ice-fall (Diane Walker).\n\n21 May, 2008\n\nSecond Lhotse group moving up now.\n\nSam reports in live (click here to listen)\n\nHello everyone. This is Sam calling from Everest/Lhotse basecamp on May 21st. We’re sitting here in our dining tent eating a delicious meal together.\n\nI mentioned earlier that some of our Lhotse members were on a tight schedule, so they did not have enough time to properly acclimatize to safely make it to the summit. Stefanos, Diane, Ian, Les and Johnny are leaving basecamp soon to catch their flight back home, so they are now finished with their climbing. I’m sure that all 5 of them learned a lot on the expedition and had a very rich experience. I certainly hope to see them again, either here in the Himalaya or elsewhere in the world. I personally would love to go climbing with anyone of them anytime. Les, Stefanos and Johnny all climbed up to camp 3 at 7000 metres/23,000 feet. Diane and Ian climbed up to the Yellow Band at around 7400 metres/24,300 feet.\n\nOur first summit group is on their way. Our two-time Everest summiter Ron, Herman and Bert are now in camp 2, but they plan to have a rest day before they head for the higher camps and the summit. They are being accompanied by 2 of our sherpas. I’m looking forward to hearing summit reports on the 25th.\n\nOur second summit team is very small and mobile, with Roger, Janbu and me. We plan to leave basecamp on the 23rd, so we hope to start our final climb from camp 4 to the summit on the 27th.\n\nThere were so many people climbing up from camp 3 to camp 4 yesterday and I’ve already heard a few unconfirmed summit reports. The weather was perfect last night, so I wouldn’t be surprised to hear about a large number of summits happening this morning. Arnold, our Everest leader, reported about 4 summits from our team, so I hope to know more about it soon.\n\nThe first trek group is leaving basecamp on the 24th, while our first summit team will be climbing from camp 3 to camp 4 and our second team is having a rest day in camp 2. We’ll call you soon to let you know how we’re doing here. This was Sam from SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition 2008. Bye. back to top\n\n20 May, 2008\n\nLhotse members summit!\n\nHello SummitClimb news. This is Arnold calling from Lhotse camp 3 at about 7000 metres/23,000 feet.\n\nYesterday we went for the summit of Lhotse with Harris, Lakpa, Jangbu, Maya, and me. Unfortunately, Maya, Jangbu, and I turned around because we thought it was too windy. Harris was feeling stronger and continued, making it to the summit with Lakpa. So Harris is the first Greek to make it to the summit of Lhotse and I think that is great news!\n\nToday it was a little windy, but the weather seems good. The weather forecast is good for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, so the guys should be fine. I'm heading to camp 2 right now to get some good food. I'll keep you informed. Bye, bye. back to top\n\nOur team members ascending above camp 3 looking down to the Western Cwm (Bruce Manning, 2007).

Mr. Kiriakakis is the first Greek to reach the summit of Lhotse, and we are very proud of him and his excellent sherpa Lakpa.\n\nHere are two photos:\n\n1. Haris on the summmit at 10:00 am on 19 May. He is sitting on a snow ledge. He is clipped to the rope because it was a fifty degree slope and the wind was buffeting him very strongly. The true summit is above his head about 1 metre, but it is a hollow snow cornice where it is not safe to stand. Haris is sitting on the highest safe point at the summit. Lakpa took the photo with Haris' camera.\n\n2. Lakpa Sherpa standing a little below Haris, facing towards the summit while Haris took the photo.\n\nHaris is proud to be the first Greek to reach the summit. This is important to him because it was a very difficult climb and he faced a lot of challenges and overcame these, to be alone in a wind and snowstorm on the top with Lakpa Sherpa, doing it for the honour of his country and to show that Greek people can face the highest challenges in the world successfully and safely. back to top\n\n18 May, 2008\n\nLhotse team heading for the summit!\n\nHello SummitClimb news. This is Arnold calling from Lhotse camp 4 at 7850 metres/25,750 feet.\n\nI'm here with Harris, Lakpa, Jangbu, and Maya Sherpa. We're resting right now for the rest of the night and at about 12:00 a.m. we will set off to attempt Lhotse and see what happens.\n\nI'll keep this dispatch short and hopefully tomorrow I'll have some good news with our first summits. So stay tuned and I'll call tomorrow with more news. Bye, bye. back to top\n\nHi, this is Sam calling on May 18th from Everest/Lhotse camp 3 at a bit over 7000 metres/23,000 feet.\n\nI'm here with Roger, Herman, and Bert, who are finalizing their acclimatization before descending to either basecamp or camp 2 before their final rest and summit push. Tomorrow on the 19th Diane, Ian, Johnny, Stefanos, and Les are climbing up here to join me. On the 20th they are planning to climb up to camp 4. Unfortunately, Diane, Ian, Stefanos, and Johnny do not have enough time to go for the summit, so they'll try to get up to 8000 metres before they go back to basecamp, start their hike out and fly back to Kathmandu to catch their flights home.\n\nIt's pretty beautiful here right now, clear weather and completely calm. We had a bit of snow in the afternoon, but as usual it died in the evening, so it's gorgeous right now. Pumori looks so small from up here and you can see very far out across the Himalaya.\n\nThis is our first night in camp 3. We'll see how the members are doing and whether they want to take a very good rest in basecamp or summit from camp 2 a few days earlier. This was Sam from SummitClimb's international Lhotse expedition 2008. I'll call back soon. Bye. back to top\n\n17 May, 2008\n\nGroup camp 3. Summit attempts soon!\n\nHello SummitClimb news. This is Arnold, the leader of the Everest/Lhotse expedition.\n\nI’m calling from camp 3 right now at about 7200 metres/23,600 feet. I’m on a summit push to climb Lhotse with Maya Sherpa, Harris, Lakpa, and Jangbu Sherpa. Today we had a very hot day climbing to camp 3, so we’re a little bit dehydrated, but everybody is fine.\n\nLet’s see what happens with our group tomorrow, when we will climb to Lhotse camp 4 at 7850 metres/25,750 feet. Our plan is to summit Lhotse on the 19th. So far the weather gods are in our favour. Let’s see what happens. I’m very optimistic, but you never know with the weather. I’ll talk to you again tomorrow. Thank you for following our news. Bye, bye. back to top\n\nClimbers in the Western Cwm.

Bert, Les, Roger, and Herman are planning to finalize their acclimatization program by sleeping up in camp 3 before returning to basecamp for a final rest before their summit push.\n\nStefanos, Diane, Ian, and Johnny will try to climb up to 8000 metres/26,200 feet this time before heading back to Kathmandu to catch their flights back home. This trip has been the best possible training for them if they ever decide to return to attempt Everest. I really hope to get to climb with them again in the future.\n\nDuring the past 2 days in basecamp we’ve been talking about our home countries and sharing our travel experiences, whether it is island hopping in Greece, cycling in Japan, fishing in New Zealand, touring in Scandinavia, or exploring Africa. Besides talking, we’ve been spotting avalanches and trying to catch them on film and memory cards. It’s been pretty warm here the last few days, so there have been quite a few big ones we’ve witnessed.\n\nIn a couple of days we’ll stay in the high camps. I hope the weather cooperates and we get to meet our goals, enjoying a few nice days up there.\n\nThat is all for now. I just want you to know that we are all having so much fun here and I think that we have a superb team. I definitely think that having fun is the most important thing on an expedition like this. So we’ll get back to you soon. This was Sam from SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition 2008. Bye. back to top\n\n14 May, 2008\n\nSam reports in live (click here to listen)\n\nHi, this is Sam, the leader of SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition calling on May 14th.\n\nOur whole team has now returned to basecamp after a good trip to the higher camps. On the 11th we climbed to camp 2, where we had a rest day on the 12th. Yesterday the whole team climbed up to our soon to be camp 3 at a bit over 7000 metres/23,000 feet and all returned to camp 2 for the night. The day before yesterday the weather looked kind of bad, but it changed dramatically overnight, so we took the chance to push our acclimatization by visiting camp 3.\n\nThe next time we will go up will be to sleep in camp 3 in order to finalize our acclimatization for the summit push. If the weather allows, we will climb up to camp 2 on the 17th and camp 3 on the 18th. For now, everybody is doing well and we’re happy to be back in our comfortable basecamp with private tents and a bit more variable foods than what we get in the high camps.\n\nI guess the only bad thing is that yesterday my ibook failed because of the altitude, so now I might need to start reading instead.\n\nDinner is supposed to be soon and I'm wondering what the menu is today. I guess we'll probably be having pizza and some pasta or something delicious like that. That is all for today. I'll get back to you soon. This was Sam for news of SummitClimb's international Lhotse expedition 2008. Bye. back to top\n\nTent secured in Camp 3 (Tunc Findik).

It snowed last night and today, so they are going to head back down to basecamp tomorrow if it doesn't let up. They are all doing well and having a good time hanging out and telling stories. back to top\n\n9 May, 2008\n\nHi everyone. This is Sam calling on May 9th.\n\nToday we had a rest day in basecamp. This morning was beautiful, but now it is snowing a bit. We hope it will stop soon since we’re preparing to enter the ice-fall tomorrow. This time we are planning to sleep in camp 2 and also in camp 3.\n\nEveryone is doing well. We went to see Christian, our Everest team’s doctor today because one of our members had a blocked nose. He gave us some nasal spray, which I’m sure will help. Craig looked over Stefanos, who had some stiffness in his back, but he’s better now. Craig has been enthusiastically collecting oxygen saturation data for his friend Christian’s study. He usually does it after meals, so it’s been: meals, saturations, and a few rounds of Uno.\n\nBesides climbing, we’ve been talking about Chevy Chase movies, 80’s music, goldfish in a tank, and everything in between. So we’re having a good time here with a lot of flapping. Everyone’s excited to go climbing tomorrow. I just hope the weather allows us to follow our planned program.\n\nThat’s about it for today. I’ll get back to you soon. This was Sam from SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition 2008. Bye. back to top\n\n8 May, 2008\n\nHello everyone. This is Sam from SummitClimb's international Lhotse expedition.\n\nAll of the members have now been through the ice-fall. Ron climbed to camp 1 yesterday and returned to basecamp by lunchtime. He is super strong. Johnny and Stefanos climbed halfway up the ice-fall and returned to basecamp.\n\nDiane, Ian, Roger, Herman, Bert, Les and I slept in camp 1 at 6000 metres/19,700 feet.\n\nThe ice-fall really is somewhat easier this year, with only a few ladder crossings. Of the course the route is long and very strenuous, with 700 metres/2300 feet of elevation gain, zigzagging through the ice maze.\n\nSo now the team is resting in basecamp until we hit the ice-fall again in a few days. We'll get back to you soon. This was Sam from SummitClimb's international Lhotse expedition 2008. Bye. back to top\n\n5 May, 2008\n\nHello SummitClimb news. This is Sam calling from Gorak Shep on May 5th.\n\nWe had a very nice day today. After breakfast we hiked up to Pumori advanced basecamp at 5600 metres/18,400 feet. The views are brilliant from there. You can even see the north face of Everest from there, not to mention the views of our route. It was a great acclimatization hike and I think the whole team will be a bit more comfortable with the altitude now.\n\nIn the afternoon we practiced ice-fall techniques on a brilliant rope course our sirdar, Jangbu, put up for the team members. Everyone got to ascend and abseil, giving them a good chance to check and access their equipment.\n\nWe will have a puja in basecamp tomorrow and after that we are ready to enter the ice-fall on the 7th. The team is doing well and we’re looking forward to start climbing Lhotse, the 4th highest mountain on the planet. This was Sam for SummitClimb’s international Lhotse expedition.

This is Sam calling from Gorak Shep on May 4th.\n\nThe Lhotse team is now in Everest/Lhotse basecamp and everyone is feeling good. Today the members have been organizing their gear, taking showers, and taking it easy. It has snowed a bit, but it will melt as soon as the sun comes up.\n\nRon has been telling us stories about his Everest climbs, Stefanos about spear-fishing off the Greece archipelago, and entertaining us with his 24 hour talent show.\n\nTomorrow we will hike up to Pumori advanced basecamp to acclimatize ourselves and to get good views over the ice-fall. In the afternoon we will be practicing ice-fall techniques. May 6th is our puja day and the on the 7th we will explore the ice-fall to camp 1 before returning to basecamp for the night. Many on the team are saying that the ice-fall is easier this year, with less ladder crossing than usual. We're looking forward to it.\n\nWell, that's all for today. There is not much going on in basecamp, which was pretty much what we planned. We'll back to you after tomorrow's hike.\n\nThis was Sam, international Lhotse Expedition 2008.

They had a nice hike and we are now happy to have them with the team.\n\nTomorrow the team members will rest in basecamp and organize their gear. We will have a puja on May 6, so no climbing before that. Everyone is feeling fine. No one is having any altitude related issues and we are looking forward to climbing in a few days.

Our plan for tomorrow is to hike up to basecamp.\n\nBert and Les, who have been trekking in the area, might already be there or we'll hook up with them on the way into Gorak Shep. We're really looking forward to basecamp after the long hike in and having a few rest days before starting the climb.\n\nThat is all for today. I'll get back to you soon.

I think it was a very good blessing and a ceremony to remember. After that we did a short 2 hour hike to Pheriche. The walk was beautiful with views over the huge south face of Lhotse, Ama Dablam, Kantega and we even got a glimpse of Pumori.\n\nIn Pheriche a few of us went to the Himalaya Rescue Association lecture on altitude related issues. The doctor who gave the talk was brilliant, so I can easily recommend this lecture to anyone who visits the area. So tomorrow we will hike another 2 hours to Dughla to 4600 metres/15,000 feet. That is all for now. Bye. back to top\n\nNamche Bazaar, the capital of the Sherpa people.

We started at around 8:30 and walked to Tengboche in about 4 hours. Once arriving, we had a really good meal with plenty of noodles and at the end we had apple pie. Ron said the apple pie was the very best he’s ever had.\n\nFrom Tengboche it was a pretty easy hike up to Pangboche, taking us about 2 hours. We had excellent views of the south face of Lhotse and Nuptse while walking up to Pangboche before the clouds rolled in, which seems to happen every afternoon along our trek. We missed the views of Ama Dablam from the clouds, but in the morning it’s always clear and very beautiful here, so we'll get to see it then.\n\nTomorrow we will continue on to Pheriche for one night. That’s supposed to be a very short hike, taking about 2 ½ hours from here. Everyone is feeling good and we’re having so much fun.\n\nThis was Sam from the SummitClimb international Lhotse expedition. I’ll call back soon. Bye. back to top\n\n28 April, 2008\n\nHi Summitclimb news readers.\n\nWe have had the most relaxing day here in Namche. The members have been enthusiastically trying the local bakeries, had showers and sent e-mails to family and friends. Some of us made short hikes up the hillsides around Namche. Diane and Ian actually went out there before breakfast! What do they say about early birds?\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday) we will hike up to Pangboche at around 4000 metres/13,100 feet. The hike there is just amazing with the most beautiful views over Ama Dablam and the massive Nuptse-Lhotse south face, with Everest peaking from behind. On the way we will pass the Tengboche Monastery and I am sure that the lodge they have there might be the best imaginable place to have lunch at.\n\nEveryone's looking forward to tomorrow and seeing the point where we're headed - the 8516-metre/27,932 foot high summit of Lhotse.\n\nSo everyone's feeling strong and positive and is happy to be here.\n\nThat is all for now. Sam. back to top\n\n27 April, 2008\n\nHello, this is Sam Mansikka, the leader of Summitclimb's International Lhotse expedition. Here's our greetings to Summitclimb News from Namche (3400 metres/11,200 feet) on Sunday, 27th of April.\n\nAfter an exciting flight to Lukla yesterday we hiked to Phakding for the night.\n\nIt is beautiful here and everyone's enjoying the hike so much! There's a good amount of \"positive feeling\" in the air, as Stefanos would say.\n\nWe have a very international group consisting of 10 members representing 8 nationalities. We have Diane and Ian from South Africa, Ron from Canada, Johnny from Denmark, Roger from England, Stefanos from Greece, Herman and Bert from Holland, Les from New Zealand and me, Sam from Finland. Bert and Les arrived early and telephoned two days ago to say they are having lots of fun trekking to Gokyo and then planning to walk over the Cho La Pass, where we'll meet up with them at Gorak Shep in a few days. We are planning to reach base camp on May 3rd to start our climb.\n\nOh, mobile phones seem to work fine here so I'll call you soon with more news about our expedition to the world's 4th highest mountain.\n\nStay tuned to SummitClimb.com for more dispatches!\n\nThis was Sam for Summitclimb's International Lhotse 2008 Expedition. back to top\n\n25 April, 2008\n\nAll of our team members have arrived.

This morning they went to the airport early to send all of our expedition equipment and materials via cargo flights.\n\nOur team managers Mr. Murari Sharma and Deha Shrestha have been taking care of all of the last minute preparations, plane tickets, budgets, etcetera.\n\nWe met for a team breakfast and orientation this morning at the Nepa/Beijing Hotel and had an enjoyable discussion of our plans for the flight, trek, and climb.\n\nWe conducted the final review of each member's personal climbing equipment and supplies.\n\nOur team members are completing the final bits and pieces of their shopping and packing their bags for the trip to basecamp and those bags which they will leave behind in the store.\n\nAfter our team dinner tonight we will head for bed early, as it's a 4 am start in the morning, when we set off for the airport and fly to Lukla.\n\nHope the skies are clear! back to top\n\nA view of Swayambhunath Stupa, the \"Monkey Temple\". It is the most ancient and enigmatic of all the holy shrines in Kathmandu valley. Swayambhunath's worshippers include Hindus, Vajrayana Buddhists of northern Nepal and Tibet, and the Newari Buddhists of central and southern Nepal. Each morning before dawn, hundreds of pilgrims will ascend the 365 steps that lead up the hill, file past the gilded Vajra (Tibetan: Dorje) and two lions guarding the entrance, and begin a series of clockwise circumambulations of the stupa. On each of the four sides of the main stupa there are a pair of big eyes. These eyes are symbolic of God's all-seeing perspective (Elselien te Hennepe).\n\n23 April, 2008\n\nOur Lhotse expedition is arriving in Kathmandu. This expedition was supposed to be the Cho Oyu expedition, but since Tibet has been sealed off to foreigners due to the Chinese Olympic torch relay, 9 Cho Oyu members and the leader decided they would like to have a go at Lhotse instead of canceling their trip.\n\nThe weather has been warm and sunny and Kathmandu has been quite peaceful (photo right by Tunc Findik in May 2007: The Lhotse face).\n\nOur team is looking good and we have been hanging around together quite a bit. Yesterday we checked all of the group equipment like tents and ropes.\n\nOur super-skillful sherpas Jangbu and Shera are doing the equipment purchasing and packing, and Jai Bahadur, who cooks amazing and tasty dishes, has been organizing the food.\n\nOur Lhotse team will have four climbing Sherpas: Jangbu (1), Jangbu (3), Lakpa (1), and Pasang (2), as well as Shera supporting.\n\nMr. Murari Sharma and Mr. Deha Shrestha have been busy running around Kathmandu getting all of the permits and everything sorted out.\n\nWe had a lovely dinner last night at the Roadhouse in Thamel and then went for a nice dessert at the New Orleans Café.\n\nToday we have been checking the team member's equipment and doing the shopping for needed items.\n\nTomorrow the rest of our team arrives.
