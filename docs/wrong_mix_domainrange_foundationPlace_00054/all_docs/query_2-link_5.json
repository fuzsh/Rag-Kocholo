        "text": "Had a great Friday last week participating in Deloitte’s Impact Day! For 25 years, #ImpactDay has been an incredible day of service and purpose at Deloitte. I was extremely proud to spend the day making NICU graduation caps with colleagues and our friends from March of Dimes. The day a family brings home their child from the NICU is a moment of immense joy and celebration, and these caps are a small but heartfelt way to commemorate that milestone. Thank you to Seth Shank , Sarah Burinsky , Brandon Gressett and our good friend Danielle Naman from MoD for organizing this fun and impactful event. I came to the event with low expectations of my craftiness, but was pleasently surprised by the results! (Thanks for the step by step instructions Seth and Sarah!) Looking forward to next year’s impact day and our continued collaboration with March of Dimes. Here’s to many more years of making a difference! #DeloitteImpactDay #MarchOfDimes\n\nVery excited to participate in the Alliance for Health Policy 9th annual Signature Series on AI in Health kickoff as a member of a sponsoring organization at the Thought Leader Workshop on April 25th.
