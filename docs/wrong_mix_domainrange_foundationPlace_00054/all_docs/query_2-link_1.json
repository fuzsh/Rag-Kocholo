        "text": "More than 30% of employees still have access to a previous employers’ digital assets according to My TechDecisions. Only 59% have notified the company. As many as 70% of employees who were let go have used «forgotten» accesses to cause intentional harm to previous employers. Some friendly advice from Kantega SSO about how to reduce your company’s exposure to risk for «cyber exits»: https://lnkd.in/d-WbYWPZ Kantega Marit Collin Frode Standal Steinar Line Simen Burhol Elias Brattli Sørensen Ksawery Buczkowski August Heltne Mats Johan Pedersen Jon Espen Ingvaldsen, PhD Espen A. Fossen Skule Johansen Mari Helene Fuglem Dave Rosenlund Gløer Langslet Erik Turøy Midtun Kirsti Merethe Tranby Per Landquist Faris Aranki - Strategy and Emotional Intelligence Sirpa Nordlund\n\nI joined Pål Myren and Anna-Karin Østlie on a panel recently focusing on DORA and their experiences as stakeholders in financial organs that must comply. Here’s what I learned from my interaction with Pal. - Start now. Paul started immediately, reading the directive, breaking down each pillar, and performing a gap analysis. This saved the team time and resources. - Value the input of stakeholders. Paul's decision to involve other responsible teams early, gain their buy-in, and start implementation built awareness and made the teams feel integral to the project's success. - Role-play and test. Running through DORA scenarios across your team is critical. - Cloud ICT compliance. Being cloud native does not absolve you of responsibility; understanding your tenant’s responsibility in an as-a-service app will be critical. Pal shared a lot more, but I found the focus on stakeholder management and departmental buy-in critical. DORA is so expansive and deep that you’ll need your organization aligned to move quickly. Hear this directly from Pal at 7:15 in the video below. https://lnkd.in/ezZdxmje\n\nAtlassian #Team24 is always an epic event with so many interesting people and exciting news 🔥 Stop by booth 60 to chat about identity access management, user offboarding, or other security topics! 🔐 We're committed to solving problems in this space for both Cloud and Data Center. Also, join our raffle for the chance to win one of these lovely Marius patterned backpacks, and say hi to our trolls 🎒 🇳🇴 #atlassian #atlassianteam24 #jira #sso Kantega SSO Kantega Ksawery Buczkowski Simen Burhol"
