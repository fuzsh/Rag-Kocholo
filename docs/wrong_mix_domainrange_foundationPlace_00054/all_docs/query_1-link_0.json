        "text": "Here's a thought 👉 the more intuitive your #HelpDesk is the faster customers will find what they need. Would you agree? There's an insightful article by Katarzyna Kornaga on the Deviniti blog with recommendations on how to configure a #JiraServiceManagement Portal that your customers (and agents!) will 💙💙💙. I heartfully recommend the article in it's entirety (look for the link in the comment 😉 ), but if you'd like a sneak peak, here is my digest of the featured tips: 👉 Step 1: Organize services clearly. Group services logically. Use headings like “Tech Help” or “Billing” so users can navigate intuitively. 👉 Step 2: Simplify request forms. Simplify the process for customers by creating straightforward request forms. Use specific headings and ask only for the information you truly need. 👉 Step 3: Use automation wisely. Improve response time and efficiency with smart automation. Set up automatic replies to let customers know their request is received or update them on their inquiry’s status. Keep the human touch, though! A personalized approach is the key to success in business. 👉 Step 4: Provide helpful FAQs and knowledge bases. Support customers to find answers independently by providing easy-to-read FAQs. Make your Knowledge Base clear and accessible. Self-service will surely be appreciated not only by your customers but also by agents. 👉 Step 5: Get feedback and improve. Encourage customer feedback! Then, act on the feedback accordingly. This will demonstrate your commitment to making their experience seamless and enjoyable. Did I miss anything? Let me know if you would add something to the list 👇. #jira #customerportal #serviceportal #jsm #servicemanagement\n\nLet's forge 🛠️ an awesome #ACE together! Have you heard of #Forge, Atlassian's development platform for building secure, reliable and scalable apps for #Jira and #Confluence #Cloud? 👉 Marta Jarzębska 👈 Software Engineer at Atlassian, will be speaking about “What is Forge, and how can it empower Jira?” at our upcoming #AtlassianCommunityEvent in #Gdańsk in just a little more than a week. But, wait there's more! ⭐ Adam Stępień from Deviniti will dive into “Request management with Atlassian; not bad, but can we do better?” ⭐ Ed Gaile from Appfire will share insights on “Providing context for context switching - learn how to navigate the complexities of team workflows seamlessly.\" ⭐ Fun Man Andy from Tempo Software will be presenting “Unleash the Beast: turning Frogs into Princes - a customer success story” I will be making sure we don't run out of 🍕 & 🍻 . 📍Check out the full agenda & register to join us at the #Atlassian office in Gdańsk 👉 https://shorturl.at/CCR7T 📅 July 15th 5:00-8:00 PM CET ✉️ RSVP Incidentally, when looking for an engineering & Gdańsk themed image to illustrate this post with I thought of the nearby shipyard. But what commonalities (if any) do a forge and a crane share? Here's some Thursday-food-for-thought on this topic from #ChatGPT: 1. #Transformation and #Creation: Both a forge and a crane are tools used to transform raw materials into something useful and valuable. 2. #Power and #Strength: They symbolize power and strength. A forge harnesses the power of heat, a crane uses mechanical strength. 3. #Precision and #Skill: Both require precision and skill to operate effectively. 4. #Enabling #Construction: They are essential tools in the construction and manufacturing industries. A forge is critical in producing tools and parts, while a crane is vital for assembling large structures. So now you know 😉.
