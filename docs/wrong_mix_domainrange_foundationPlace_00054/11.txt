I joined Pål Myren and Anna-Karin Østlie on a panel recently focusing on DORA and their experiences as stakeholders in financial organs that must comply. Here’s what I learned from my interaction with Pal. - Start now. Paul started immediately, reading the directive, breaking down each pillar, and performing a gap analysis. This saved the team time and resources. - Value the input of stakeholders. Paul's decision to involve other responsible teams early, gain their buy-in, and start implementation built awareness and made the teams feel integral to the project's success. - Role-play and test. Running through DORA scenarios across your team is critical. - Cloud ICT compliance. Being cloud native does not absolve you of responsibility; understanding your tenant’s responsibility in an as-a-service app will be critical. Pal shared a lot more, but I found the focus on stakeholder management and departmental buy-in critical. DORA is so expansive and deep that you’ll need your organization aligned to move quickly. Hear this directly from Pal at 7:15 in the video below. https://lnkd.in/ezZdxmje
