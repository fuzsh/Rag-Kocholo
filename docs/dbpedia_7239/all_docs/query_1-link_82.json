        "text": "I don’t mention it often enough, but I am Asian-American. My mom is from Hong Kong, my birth dad is from Idaho. They met and fell in love in New York, but that is a story for a different time. Still, the fact that I am Asian-American does little to define me in the day to day. I don’t look particularly Asian. I’m not fluent in the language. I’m not the type who’s big on “representation,” or gets upset when someone attempts a funny Chinese accent. I’m proud of my heritage and my parentage, but it usually takes an awful lot to offend me.\n\nWell, “an awful lot” is what I experienced fairly recently, while researching a piece I wanted to write about Asian representation in Star Wars. I was going to be brief — just a few snide remarks about Rose Tico in The Rise Of Skywalker, and how her relative absence from the movie is indicative of Hollywood’s offhanded treatment of Asian people throughout history. Little did I know that the problem was far more pervasive than I initially thought. I mean, I knew, just not to the extent that it affected my outlook. And the Chinese side of me is angry and ashamed that I’ve spent this long with my head in the sand. (In typical fashion, my American side just wants a sandwich).\n\nSo let’s take a look at Asian (mis)representation in film. Not a deep dive into every social injustice faced by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (et al.) actors and filmmakers throughout the decades, but a cold, hard look at some of the silliest trends and absurdities that plagued Hollywood from the Silent Era to (yep) The Rise Of Skywalker, and how racism informs so much of our cinema experience whether we realize it or not.\n\nWith some notable exceptions during the Silent Era (Anna May Wong and Sessue Hayakawa, for instance, made enough of a splash to pave the way for future Asian stars), Asians were typically played by white actors in yellowface — makeup, like blackface, applied to actors to make them look Oriental. This was due to common prejudices of the time. Examples of yellowface in silent films include Mary Pickford in Madame Butterfly (1915), Richard Barthelmess in Broken Blossoms (1919), Lon Chaney in Shadows (1922), and Harry Agar Lyons in The Mystery Of Fu Manchu (1923).\n\nThe Fu Manchu connection is especially interesting. Created by author Sax Rohmer to cash in on the “Yellow Peril” panic of the early 1900s, the nefarious Dr. Fu Manchu appeared in over a dozen films — played exclusively by white men. This is either because the role degraded Asian actors, or (more likely) because Asian leads just weren’t bankable at the time. Actors who played Fu Manchu — Warner Oland (1929 thru 1931), Boris Karloff (1932), Christopher Lee (1965 thru 1969), and Peter Sellers (1980) — often hid behind exaggerated makeup and silly facial hair.\n\nAs an antidote to the Yellow Peril came Charlie Chan, Earl Derr Biggers’s “honorable detective” who starred in 40-plus films and was actually occasionally played by East Asian actors (George Kuwa in 1926, Kamiyama Sojin in 1927). The character, however, didn’t become popular with U.S. audiences until Warner Oland was cast as the title role in Charlie Chan Carries On (1931). Oland played Chan for 16 films until his death in 1938, when he was succeeded by Sidney Toler for 11 films; yet despite the character’s popularity as a wise, heroic figure as opposed to the conniving Asian stereotypes of so many films, the character was later criticized for being equally problematic, thanks to his fortune cookie-cutter English and subservient nature. By the time he made his final big-screen appearance, played by Peter Ustinov in 1981’s Charlie Chan And The Dragon Queen (the tagline for which read, “MURDERER WHO TURN VICTIM INTO HUMAN BAKED POTATO HAVE REAL APPETITE FOR CRIME”), Chan had also been written off as a racist relic of the past.\n\nAttitudes about Asian culture prevailed throughout the decades, now with the added bonus of synchronized sound, so you could hear yellowface’d actors speak in silly accents to go along with their squinted expressions. And not just B-list stars but A-listers, too. Stars like Sylvia Sidney in Madame Butterfly (1932), Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young in The Hatchet Man (1932), Katharine Hepburn in Dragon Seed (1944), John Wayne (as Genghis Khan!) in The Conqueror (1956)…\n\n…Marlon Brando in The Teahouse Of The August Moon (1956), Robert Donat in The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness (1958), Sean Connery in You Only Live Twice (1967, where he only disguised himself as Japanese, but still), and Peter Ustinov in One Of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing (1975).\n\nStudio mandates also kept Asian actors from accepting certain roles. Once Paul Muni was cast as a Chinese farmer in The Good Earth (1937), for example, Hays Code anti-miscegenation laws decreed that an Asian actress could not play his wife, so Luise Rainer was cast instead. (Irony alert: Anna May Wong was originally approached to play Rainer’s part until Muni was hired. Wong was then offered an unsympathetic secondary part but turned it down. For her efforts, Rainer went on to win the Best Actress Oscar at the 10th Annual Academy Awards.)\n\nRacism, of course, is the baseless, irrational fear of someone with a different skin color than you — and the natural inclination to “hate” that person or think of them as “inferior.” It’s a disease. And like any disease, it evolves. After Anglo-Asian relations soured in the wake of WWII, all attempts to pay “respect” to Asian cultures went out the window, and resorted to poking fun at them instead. Characters became cartoons. Sometimes literally, as in Lady And The Tramp (1955), The Aristocats (1970), and La Ballade des Dalton (1978)…\n\n…or — more controversially — in live-action, as in Breakfast At Tiffany’s (1961) or Sixteen Candles (1984), where Asians were portrayed as either buck-toothed buffoons, or sex-obsessed and effeminate (accompanied by a gong sound whenever they enter or exit a room).\n\nOf course, it’s easy to forget how societal norms often cause us to adopt offensive racist behavior. And to their credit, actors like Mickey Rooney and Gedde Watanabe have long since regretted perpetuating Asian stereotypes by going for the easy laugh.\n\nAlthough much less prevalent during the ’80s, ’90s, and 2000s, Asian misrepresentation continued to rear its ugly head. Actors trying to go “legit” by appearing in yellowface, like Oscar winner Linda Hunt in The Year Of Living Dangerously (1982) and Joel Grey in Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins (1985).\n\nOr playing full-on cartoon caricatures, like John Leguizamo in The Pest (1997), Eddie Murphy in Norbit (2007), Rob Schneider in I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry (2007), and David Carradine in Crank 2: High Voltage(2009, which is especially egregious since Carradine notoriously played a Shaolin monk in TV’s Kung Fu).\n\nThen, in the 2000s and 2010s, another evolution. Since the examples cited above were now considered “quaint” or “old hat” by most of Hollywood, filmmakers no longer even attempted to pass off white actors as Asian characters. Instead, they simply “whitewashed” characters so that they were no longer Asian at all.\n\n21 (2008), based on the MIT Blackjack Team that cheated Las Vegas casinos out of millions of dollars, replaced most of its real-life Asian-American counterparts with white leads. In Annihilation (2018), Natalie Portman played a character of Asian descent (though author Jeff VanderMeer didn’t clarify this until his follow-up novel).\n\nThe Last Airbender (2010), adapted from the popular Nickelodeon cartoon about Inuit and East/South Asian cultures, featured a mostly white cast. Tilda Swinton co-starred in Doctor Strange (2016) as The Ancient One, a character who is predominantly Asian in the comics. And Emma Stone, for whatever reason, played “half-Swedish, one-quarter Hawaiian, and one-quarter Chinese” in Aloha (2015).\n\nFor adaptations of Japanese manga, Hollywood decided it was best for marketing purposes to populate their casts almost exclusively with white faces. Which is more or less why we got Emil Hirsch and Christina Ricci in Speed Racer (2008), Justin Chatwin in Dragonball Evolution (2009), Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise in Edge Of Tomorrow(2014), and Scarlett Johansson in Ghost In The Shell (2017).\n\nIt’s pointless, I suppose, to whine and cry about a bunch of rules and knee-jerk reactions that have long since become outdated. And to be fair, Asians have earned their share of respectability over the decades, thanks to superstars such as Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Noriyuki “Pat” Morita, Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li, and Donnie Yen. Even over the past few years, U.S. releases filled with Asian actors — Crazy Rich Asians (2018), Searching (2018), Always Be My Maybe (2019), and The Farewell (2019) being some of the more recent examples — have become increasingly profitable at the box office.\n\nRacist attitudes continue to manifest themselves in popular entertainment, however. You see it in Hollywood’s recent attempts to pander to Chinese markets, by setting huuuuge chunks of mainstream blockbusters in Far East countries (Transformers: Age Of Extinction [2014]), or by casting iconic Chinese stars only to minimize their roles or cut them from U.S. theatrical prints entirely (Wang Xueqi in Iron Man 3 [2013], Zhang Jingchu in Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation [2015]). You see it in films that sideline Chinese characters in favor of (fictional) white protagonists (Birth Of The Dragon [2016]).\n\nThis past summer, a Bruce Lee “cameo” in Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood drew mocking laughter from audiences — just not for the reasons you’d expect. Never mind that the performance by actor Mike Moh is pretty much a spot-on impersonation of Lee. Never mind that he’s accurately portrayed as a hot-headed braggart. What’s curious is the reaction to that spot-on, historically accurate portrayal. Lee’s posture in the film, the sounds that he makes, the fact that most people watching OUATIH probably have no idea who Bruce Lee even is, let alone the cultural impact that he had on American cinema… audiences seem to accept this character as a caricature, because that’s how they’ve been programmed to respond to it. (Film critic Walter Chaw explains this strange dichotomy better here.)\n\nThis kind of “systemic racism” is tougher to tackle because it’s so deeply ingrained. No one who isn’t overtly racist wants to be labeled a racist. And yet, despite the efforts of actors, screenwriters, producers, directors, and PR firms, sometimes acting in the “best interests” of their studio can have a negative effect, as we just learned with Star Wars.\n\nLet me backtrack a bit. I didn’t make a fuss of it at the time, but watching The Last Jedi in 2017, it was refreshing to see the Asian side of me finally represented in one of the most influential film franchises in history. Asian philosophy has always had a strong influence on Star Wars, from the concept of qi (“life force”), to Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress and Kagemusha. (The word “Jedi” itself is derived from Jidaigeki, period dramas encompassing the Edo period of Japanese history.) But aside from the occasional reference to Chinese and Japanese cultures, the only Asian characters in a Star Wars film up to that point had been these guys. The Last Jedi was different. With The Last Jedi, we got an Asian character who (for once) wasn’t presented as a buffoon, or comic relief, but as a bright shining light for others to follow. And so of course, toxic fandom took it as ample opportunity to throw Rose Tico under the bus.\n\nBy now, the drama surrounding Rose and The Last Jedi has been well documented. The hate, the online harassment, the sexist, racial epithets that drove Vietnamese actress Kelly Marie Tran to delete her Instagram account (“It wasn’t their words,” Tran wrote in a 2018 op-ed for The New York Times, “it’s that I started to believe them”)…. The Last Jedi may have its issues, but the fact that so many “fans” chose to confront those issues by stooping to bigotry and name calling is very telling, especially for a film that spends the majority of its time questioning the very notion of Star Wars.\n\nBut then, as The Rise Of Skywalker kicked off its box office assault last December, a weird reality began to set in. Turns out that Rose, who’d played such an integral part in The Last Jedi (in fact, I’d argue that she played the heart of the entire Star Wars franchise), had been sidelined in Episode IX. Not just sidelined, but relegated to a glorified cameo role — one minute and 16 seconds of screen time in a two-hour and 20-minute film, to be exact. Reports vary as to why this is so; either because Tran’s scenes with a CG’d Carrie Fisher weren’t “photorealistic” enough, or that the screenplay simply couldn’t accommodate so many plot threads and characters.\n\nWhich, fine. That’s not what angers me. What finally gets me so thoroughly, violently upset is the idea that somehow, the bigotry has been validated. That because of the conscious/unconscious decision to cut Rose from the film, all the trolls and toxic fans who led the charge in smearing the character’s — and Kelly Marie Tran’s — good name now feel… appeased. That they’ve been listened to. That it’s ultimately more important to kowtow to fan expectations than to give all people of color a seat at the table. It’s an accidental win for the other side, and it’s the worst kind of feeling.\n\nAnd yet… it all still sorta feels the same, doesn’t it? Leafing through the sad, sordid history of racism and prejudice on film (for Asians or African-Americans or Latinos or whatever), you realize that it’s symptomatic of our culture to mock and fear what we don’t understand. It’s an endless cycle. And it’s a hard truth we all need to learn sometime. I keep thinking about two photos of Tran, one where she’s dolled up for The Last Jedi’s L.A. premiere in 2017, and the other for The Rise Of Skywalker just three short months ago. In the first, she wears a red, strapless fairytale dress, and she’s positively glowing — her cheeks soft, eyes beaming. Proud and ecstatic to be walking the red carpet for the first time. Innocent. In the second, she’s wearing a blue sequined gown, only she seems a bit more… emboldened this time, steely-eyed, her cheeks rigid. Confident, austere even. She’s got her armor on. Study your history enough, and you get an inkling of exactly how she feels."
