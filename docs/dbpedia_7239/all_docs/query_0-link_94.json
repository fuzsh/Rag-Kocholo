        "text": "In D.W. Griffith’s 1919 feature film Broken Blossoms, a young girl, Lucy Burrows, is abused by her alcoholic prizefighting father, Battling Burrows. She meets Cheng Huan, a kind-hearted Chinese man who falls in love with her. As Cheng nurses Lucy back to health, the two form a bond as unwanted outcasts of society.\n\nThe new play Unbroken Blossoms by Philip W. Chung is the story of the silenced voices behind this real silent film Broken Blossoms. Chung’s play is a historical reimagining of the making of the boundary-breaking Hollywood classic that shines a light on the collateral damage in the search for “authentic” representation, and asks what price we pay for our art.\n\nFrom the press release:\n\nThe year is 1919 – and Hollywood’s first onscreen interracial love story is about to go before the cameras – between a white actress and a white actor in yellowface makeup. The movie in question is Broken Blossoms, the director is the notorious D.W. Griffith, and the lovers are being played by Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess, in the roles of “Lucy Burrows” and “Cheng Huan.”\n\nThis is the subject of East West Players next World Premiere play, Unbroken Blossoms by Philip W. Chung (KCET/Artbound’s East West Players: A Home on Stage) and directed by Jeff Liu (EWP’s The Brothers Paranormal & Chinglish), a historical reimagining of the making of this actual boundary-breaking Hollywood classic.\n\nIn Unbroken Blossoms, Moon, an idealistic family man, and James, a cynical, aspiring filmmaker, are hired as the Chinese American consultants for Broken Blossoms, and must contend with the outsized ego of the film’s director D.W. Griffith, who is attempting to belie criticisms of racism after the recent release of his controversial film The Birth of a Nation.\n\nBased on actual events, this story of the silenced voices behind the real silent film Broken Blossoms illuminates a historical conflict just behind the silver screen.\n\nArtsBeatLA spoke with playwright Philip W. Chung in advance of the world premier of his play at East West Players. Unbroken Blossoms continues East West Players 2024 season from June 27 through July 21, 2024 at the David Henry Hwang Theatre in Downtown LA.\n\nWhat was the impetus to tell this story, to write this play?\n\nPhilip W. Chung – As an Asian American working in film and theater, I’ve often been critical of how Asians and other marginalized communities have been negatively portrayed in our media. And I’ve just as often received pushback from people who make the argument that “it’s only a movie” – that the images we see in the media don’t have any harmful influence on our lives. But I believe the best counter-argument to this view is found in the film that many consider the first crowning cinematic achievement: director D.W. Griffith’s 1915 silent epic, The Birth of a Nation.\n\nWhile The Birth of a Nation did advance the craft of filmmaking in unprecedented ways and, arguably, helped turn film into a true art, it was also a work that was aggressively anti-Black that painted the Ku Klux Klan as America’s saviors. The KKK had all but disappeared by 1915, but Griffith’s movie was so successful that it inspired a massive re-launch of the group and, over a hundred years later, we’re still feeling the effects of that moment. I can’t think of a better argument for how the “reel” world has a direct impact on our “real” world.\n\nI wanted to explore this relationship between the “reel” and the “real”. I’ve also always been interested in Hollywood history and I had recently watched Arthur Dong’s great documentary Hollywood Chinese where I learned that Griffith had employed two Chinese American consultants on his 1919 film, Broken Blossoms. Broken Blossoms tells an interracial love story between a white woman and a Chinese man, but of course the Asian character is played by a white actor in yellow face – a historically common practice in Hollywood. The story of the making of Broken Blossoms from the pov of those two consultants seemed like the perfect way to explore my various interests.\n\nBroken Blossoms is notable for its portrayal of interracial romance, but it has also been criticized for perpetuating racial stereotypes and exoticizing Asian characters.\n\nWhy did D. W. Griffith feature miscegenation in his movie Broken Blossoms? Is he sympathetic to race relations or is he seeking to exploit a controversial topic?\n\nBroken Blossoms does exoticize its Chinese character. It does feature “yellow face” with a white actor made up to look Asian. But in defense of the film, I do think it was progressive in its own way for 1919. This was a time of anti-Asian sentiment and legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Act, which limited immigration from China. So while the Asian man in the film comes off as a stereotype, he’s still presented as a more nuanced, sympathetic figure.\n\nWe know that Griffith was surprised and disturbed by the accusations of racism that followed the release of The Birth of a Nation. While he never apologized for making that movie, I don’t think it’s an accident that a number of the films he produced afterwards, including Broken Blossoms, made more of an argument for tolerance. Though he denied being a racist, I also don’t think he was necessarily sympathetic to race relations. If anything, my interpretation of Griffith in the play is that he was driven by more of a personal, selfish motive. I think making a film like Broken Blossoms was, at least partially, a way to control his self-image and help advance the argument that he wasn’t a bigot.\n\nHow does your play focus on the behind-the-scenes making of Broken Blossoms? Will we see the Chinese American consultants butting heads with Griffith and the film industry censors?\n\nAs an Asian American, I still find myself often “code switching” depending on who I’m interacting with. So I’m fascinated by what the version of code switching must have been like in 1919. While the two consultants in my story, James B. Leong and Moon Kwan, have strong and, often, differing opinions about their roles on the production, they still have to navigate the reality of being Chinese in 1919.\n\nHow they behave when they are spending time alone with each other in the play is very different than when they are in the presence of Griffith or a white movie star like Richard Barthelmess, whom they are tasked with turning into a believable Chinese man. There’s a lot of fun we have in the play with their code switching, which I hope the audience will find entertaining and humorous, but the very real dramatic consequences of what happens when you step out of line as an Asian is also something we explore. I can’t say enough about how our talented cast really makes those moments memorable and surprising.\n\nThe press notes mention that your play “shines a light on the silenced voices behind a real silent film” – how does it do that?\n\nAlthough my play is historical fiction, James B. Leong and Moon Kwan were not only real people, but filmmakers themselves. It still blows my mind that there were Asian Americans like them working in Hollywood back then. In fact, Leong produced and directed his own feature film, Lotus Blossom, just a few years later in 1921.\n\nThis notion of “shining a light on the silenced voices” is another major reason why I wanted to write this play. Even as someone who has been steeped in Hollywood film history as I was, I had never heard of Leong and Kwan until Arthur Dong’s documentary. As one of my characters says in the play, there’s really no historical record of what they did on the production or that they were even really there.\n\nEven though my versions of Leong and Kwan are fictionalized, I hope the play inspires audiences to seek out more information about them and, in turn, that leads them further down the rabbit hole to learn about their other filmmaking contemporaries. Artists like Marion E. Wong, the first Asian American to produce and direct a feature film in 1916, or Sessue Hayakawa, the first Asian movie star who started his own studio in 1918. And there’s so many others like Anna May Wong, Oscar Micheaux, Lois Weber – they weren’t white men so they may not be remembered as much as someone like Griffith is today, but they were as important to the history of cinema in their own right.\n\nIs there anything else audiences can expect from this world premier?\n\nWhen I started writing this play almost a decade ago, I have to admit the world of 1919 felt very distant and more like a faraway relic. 1919 was a year that saw the Spanish Flu global pandemic, violent Black-White race riots all over America dubbed the Red Summer, war in Europe, anti-Asian sentiment, and a Hollywood on the verge of collapse – all these events are present in my play. But who could have predicted what would happen to our world post-2020 and that my play would suddenly feel modern and relevant in a way that I could not have imagined in a million years? So through no planning or insight of my own, Unbroken Blossoms feels more like a contemporary play than it did when I started work on it. And while, sadly, that says something about how far we haven’t come as a society in the past hundred years, I hope it also moves audiences to reflect on the progress we have made and find inspiration in the lives of our pioneers to continue moving forward.\n\nTickets to Unbroken Blossoms may be purchased online at eastwestplayers.org or by calling (213) 625-7000.
