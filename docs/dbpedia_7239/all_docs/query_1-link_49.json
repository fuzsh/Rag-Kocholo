        "text": "Seeing baby faced Anna May Wong, just one year out of high school at 17 and in her breakout role, is enough to make this film worth checking out. The film was shot in two-color Technicolor (red and green), which I found added to the images, rather than awkwardly detracting from them as I feared it might. Unfortunately, the plot is typical of the period, a variation of the popular Madame Butterfly story of 1898, and it’s pretty maddening.

The final product is astonishing, that is beyond dispute, but unfortunately I cannot say the same about the film itself. However I must make one thing clear, The Toll of the Sea is the kind of film where my heart tells me ''it's a great film'' but my brain tells me ''no, it's not''. Desperately, it leaves…"
