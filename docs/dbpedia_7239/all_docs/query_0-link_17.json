Robinson and Loretta Young William A. Wellman\n\nMakeup artists had noticed that audiences were more likely to reject Western actors in Asian disguise if the faces of actual Asians were in near proximity. Rather than cast the film with all Asian actors, which would have then meant no star names to attract American audiences, studios simply eliminated most of the Asian actors from the cast.[4]\n\n1932 Frisco Jenny Helen Jerome Eddy William A. Wellman\n\nHelen Jerome Eddy, portrays Frisco Jenny's loyal servant Amah.\n\nAlthough not a success on the original release, in recent years, Frisco Jenny has been among the pre-Code films rediscovered and re-evaluated thanks to theatrical revivals and cable television screenings.[5]\n\n1932 The Mask of Fu Manchu Myrna Loy as Fah Lo See Charles Brabin\n\nCharles Vidor 1932 Thirteen Women Myrna Loy George Archainbaud\n\nUrsula Georgi (Myrna Loy), a half-Javanese Eurasian woman who was subjected to harsh bigotry from the other women during her school days due to her mixed-race heritage. Georgi exacts revenge by using a suborned swami to manipulate the women into killing themselves or each other.\n\nNot a popular success either critically or financially, Thirteen Women has achieved a \"cult classic\" status in recent years. A pre-Code era film, modern critics have stated that its theme was ahead of its time and out of step with the tastes of 1930s cinema patrons.[6]\n\n1933 The Bitter Tea of General Yen Nils Asther Frank Capra\n\nGeneral Yen was a box office failure upon its release and has since been overshadowed by Capra's later efforts. In recent years, the film has grown in critical acclaim. In 2000, the film was chosen by British film critic Derek Malcolm as one of the hundred best films in The Century of Films.\n\nAccording to a New York Times review, Nils Asther's make-up is impressive, with slanting eyes and dark skin. He talks with a foreign accent.[7]\n\nToshia Mori who in 1932 became the only Asian actress to be selected as a WAMPAS Baby Star, an annual list of young and promising film actresses, was billed third in the film's credits, behind Barbara Stanwyck and Asther. This was her most significant film role; she returned to minor characters in her subsequent films.\n\n1934 The Mysterious Mr. Wong Bela Lugosi William Nigh\n\nBela Lugosi stars as Mr. Wong, a \"harmless\" Chinatown shopkeeper by day and relentless blood-thirsty pursuer of the Twelve Coins of Confucius by night.\n\nThey did not even bother to disguise Lugosi's thick Hungarian accent. It was directed by William Nigh, who three years later directed Boris Karloff in the Mr. Wong detective films.\n\n1936 Broken Blossoms Emlyn Williams as Cheng Huan John Brahm\n\nRemake\n\n1937 The Good Earth Paul Muni as Wang Lung\n\nLuise Rainer as O-Lan\n\nAll of the Lead Roles Sidney Franklin\n\nAll of the lead roles were played by actors in yellowface while all the extras and minor roles were played by Asians.\n\nLuise Rainer won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as O-Lan.\n\n1937 Lost Horizon H.B. Warner Frank Capra\n\nH.B. Warner as Chang, an ancient Chinese man who rescues the plane crash survivors and takes them to Shangri-La. Warner lost the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor to Joseph Schildkraut for The Life of Emile Zola.[8]\n\n1937–1939 Mr. Moto film series Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto film series\n\nBetween 1937 and 1939 eight motion pictures were produced by 20th Century Fox starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Kentaro Moto.\n\nUnlike in the novels, Moto is the central character, wears glasses, and no longer has gold teeth. He is still impeccably dressed in primarily Western suits, only wearing a yukata when he is relaxing at home.\n\nThe stories are action-oriented due to Moto's liberal use of judo (only hinted at in the novels) and due to his tendency to wear disguises.\n\n1938 Shadows Over Shanghai Paul Sutton Charles Lamont\n\nPaul Sutton is in yellowface and portrays a Japanese officer.\n\nVictor Sen Yung changed his name to Victor Young.\n\n1939 Island of Lost Men Anthony Quinn Kurt Neumann\n\nAnthony Quinn is in yellowface and portrays Chang Tai, a \"Chinese\" agent.\n\n1939 The Mystery of Mr. Wong Boris Karloff William Nigh\n\nBoris Karloff was in yellowface as the detective.\n\nAmongst the Asians in the background: Chester Gan, Lotus Long as the maid, Lee Tung Foo as Mr. Wong's Butler and door opener.\n\n1940 The Letter Gale Sondergaard William Wyler\n\nSondergaard plays a Eurasian, a trope of the Dragonlady.\n\nVariety said, \"Sondergaard is the perfect mask-like threat\".[9]\n\n1942 Little Tokyo, U.S.A. Harold Huber as Takimura, American-born spy for Tokyo, June Duprez as Teru Otto Brower\n\nWhile other works had used Asian make-up to ridicule or vilify Asian features, this B movie used yellowface directly to deny a group of Asian Americans their civil rights.[10] Twentieth Century-Fox seized on one of the most controversial aspects of the homefront, the roundup and internment of people of Japanese descent on the West Coast. Little Tokyo basically developed the theme that anyone of Japanese descent, including American citizens, was loyal to the emperor of Japan and a potential traitor to America.[11][12]\n\nThe movie employed a quasi-documentary style of filming. Twentieth Century sent its cameramen to the Japanese quarter of Los Angeles to shoot the actual evacuation. However, after the evacuation, night shots were difficult in the deserted \"Little Tokyo\". Night scenes were filmed in Chinatown instead. Chinese actor Richard Loo played one of the lead Japanese roles in the film.\n\n1943 Batman J. Carrol Naish Lambert Hillyer\n\nJ. Carrol Naish is in yellowface and portrays Dr. Tito Daka, a Japanese mad scientist. The speaking roles of Japanese Navy sailors were also played by actors of non-Japanese descent in yellowface.[citation needed]\n\n1944 Dragon Seed Katharine Hepburn, Walter Huston, Aline MacMahon, Turhan Bey, Agnes Moorehead, J. Carrol Naish, and Hurd Hatfield Harold S. Bucquet and Jack Conway\n\nBased on a best-selling book by Pearl S. Buck, the film portrays a peaceful village in China that has been invaded by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese war. The men in the village choose to adopt a peaceful attitude toward their conquerors, but Jade (played by Hepburn), a headstrong woman, stands up to the Japanese.\n\nAline MacMahon was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actress.\n\nIn Lion of Hollywood author Scott Eyman wrote that this was one of the worst of all MGM pictures (p. 364).[13]\n\n1946 Anna and the King of Siam Rex Harrison, Linda Darnell, and Gale Sondergaard John Cromwell\n\nAt the 19th Academy Awards ceremony, the film received two Oscars; for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction (Lyle R. Wheeler, William S. Darling, Thomas Little, Frank E. Hughes)[14]\n\nGale Sondergaard was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n1946 Ziegfeld Follies Fred Astaire and Lucille Bremer Lemuel Ayers, Roy Del Ruth, Robert Lewis, Vincente Minnelli, Merrill Pye, George Sidney, Charles Walters\n\nLimehouse Blues: Conceived as a \"dramatic pantomime\" with Astaire as a proud but poverty-stricken Chinese labourer whose infatuation with the unattainable Bremer leads to tragedy. The story serves as bookends for a dream ballet inspired by Chinese dance motifs.\n\n1955 Blood Alley Anita Ekberg, Berry Kroeger, Paul Fix, and Mike Mazurki William A. Wellman\n\nDespite the star power of its lead actors and director, Blood Alley received a lukewarm reception from critics.[15] The New York Times proclaimed, \"Blood Alley, despite its exotic, oriental setting, is a standard chase melodrama patterned on a familiar blueprint.\"[16]\n\nFar better were Paul Fix, Berry Kroeger, and Anita Ekberg, who weren't the most convincing \"Chinese\" in the world but who seem to fit right in with the blood-and-thunder proceedings.[17]\n\n1955 Love is a Many Splendored Thing Jennifer Jones Henry King\n\nSet in 1949–50 Hong Kong, it tells the story of a married, but separated, American reporter (played by William Holden), who falls in love with a Eurasian doctor originally from Mainland China (played by Jennifer Jones), only to encounter prejudice from her family and from Hong Kong society.\n\nApart from Jennifer Jones, the rest of the family were cast with East Asian actors.\n\nThe film won Academy Awards for Best Costume Design, Color, Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture and Best Music, Song (for Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster for \"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing\").\n\nIt was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Jennifer Jones), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color (Lyle Wheeler, George Davis, Walter M. Scott, Jack Stubbs), Best Cinematography, Color, Best Picture and Best Sound, Recording.[18]\n\n1956 The Conqueror John Wayne, Susan Hayward, Agnes Moorehead, Thomas Gomez, and others Dick Powell\n\nThe picture was a critical and commercial failure (often ranked as one of the worst films of the 1950s). Wayne, who was at the height of his career, had lobbied for the role after seeing the script and was widely believed to have been grossly miscast. (He was so \"honored\" by The Golden Turkey Awards.)\n\n1956 The King and I Yul Brynner and Rita Moreno Walter Lang\n\nBrynner (who was born in Asia, in Vladivostok,[19] which is now in Russia, and has both European and Asian ancestry including Swiss and Mongolian Buryat) reprised his role as King Mongut of Siam from the original Broadway production.\n\nMoreno, who is of Puerto-Rican heritage, played Tuptim.\n\nThe film was banned in Thailand (formerly Siam in King Mongkut's days).\n\n1956 The Teahouse of the August Moon Marlon Brando Daniel Mann\n\nBrando spent two hours a day for the standard prosthetic eyepieces and makeup. His role was made all the more noticeable because he is the only actor in yellowface in a sea of Asian extras and secondary characters.[20]\n\nBrando actually attempted an \"authentic\" Japanese accent and he even has some Japanese dialogue.\n\n1957 Sayonara Ricardo Montalbán as Nakamura Joshua Logan\n\nA movie dealing with racism, prejudice, and interracial marriage in post war Japan\n\n1958 The Quiet American (1958 version) Giorgia Moll as Phuong Joseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nAdaptation of Graham Green's novel.\n\n1958 The Inn of the Sixth Happiness Curd Jürgens and Robert Donat Mark Robson\n\nThe two leads, British actor Robert Donat and German actor Curt Juergens, portrayed Chinese characters.\n\nThe filmmakers have also been criticised for casting Ingrid Bergman, a tall woman with a Swedish accent, as Gladys Aylward who was in fact short and had a cockney accent.\n\n1961 Breakfast at Tiffany's Mickey Rooney Blake Edwards\n\nRooney's performance of Japanese character Mr. Yunioshi was later criticized in subsequent years as an offensive stereotype.[21][22]\n\nThe 2009 DVD re-release of the film included \"a brief and necessary featurette on the character of Mr. Yunioshi, offering an Asian perspective on yellowface\".[23]\n\n1961 The Devil's Daffodil Christopher Lee as Ling Chu Ákos Ráthonyi 1961 The Terror of the Tongs Christopher Lee as Chung King and others Anthony Bushell 1961 Flower Drum Song Juanita Hall Henry Koster\n\nThe film and stage play were based on the 1957 novel of the same name by the Chinese-American author C.Y. Lee.\n\nIn 1960, producer Ross Hunter cast Anna May Wong in Flower Drum Song. However, Wong became ill in December 1960 and was replaced by Juanita Hall.\n\nThis movie was unusual (for its time) in featuring nearly all Asian-American cast members (one of the few speaking white parts being that of a mugger), including dancers, though two of the singing voices were not Asian ones. Starring in this movie were Nancy Kwan, James Shigeta, Benson Fong, James Hong, Reiko Sato and the original Broadway cast members Jack Soo, Miyoshi Umeki and Juanita Hall (an African-American actress who previously played the Pacific Islander Bloody Mary in the Broadway and film productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific).\n\nIn 2008, Flower Drum Song was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[24]\n\n1962 The Manchurian Candidate Henry Silva John Frankenheimer 1962 A Majority of One Alec Guinness Mervyn LeRoy 1962 Dr. No Joseph Wiseman, Zena Marshall, Marguerite LeWars Terence Young\n\nIn the first James Bond film Canadian actor Joseph Wiseman played the titular villain, self-described as half-Chinese and half-German. Kenyan-born English actress Zena Marshall played the villainess Miss Taro. White Jamaican model Marguerite LeWars played the minor role of photographer Annabel Chung.\n\n1963 55 Days at Peking Flora Robson Nicholas Ray 1963 Have Gun - Will Travel Bethel Leslie, William Schallert Richard Boone\n\nBethel Leslie in two roles in the episode, \"The Lady of the Fifth Moon\", as well as William Schallert appeared in yellowface makeup in this episode which is full of stereotypical dialog with Schallert narrating the episode presenting his voice in an East Asian stereotypical pitch and accent.\n\n1964 7 Faces of Dr. Lao Tony Randall George Pal 1965 Pierrot le fou Anna Karina Jean-Luc Godard\n\nLead actress Anna Karina donned yellowface makeup during a mid-film skit satirizing the American involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\n1965 Genghis Khan Robert Morley, James Mason and others Henry Levin 1965 Marco the Magnificent Anthony Quinn, Robert Hossein and others Denys de La Patellière, Noël Howard\n\nAdventure film based on the travels of Marco Polo. Anthony Quinn plays Kublai Khan.\n\n1965 Gilligan's Island Vito Scotti\n\nScotti portrayed a Japanese sailor who was not aware that World War II had ended in two episodes: \"So Sorry, My Island Now\" (Season 1, Ep 15) and \"Diogenes, Won't You Please Go Home\" (S1 E31).\n\n1965 Get Smart Leonard Strong and Joey Forman\n\nLeonard Strong guest stars as \"The Claw\" in two episodes of season 1; \"Diplomat's Daughter\" and \"The Amazing Harry Hoo\", where he would pronounce his name as \"The Craw\" due to his stereotypical inability to pronounce the letter L, and would angrily respond \"Not Craw, Craw!\" whenever addressed by his mispronounced name.\n\nHe is joined by Joey Forman in \"The Amazing Harry Hoo\", who plays the role of \"Detective Harry Hoo\", a parody of Charlie Chan. Forman reprises his role as Harry Hoo in the season 2 episode: \"Hoo Done It\".\n\n1965 The Return of Mr. Moto Henry Silva Ernest Morris\n\nIn 1965, Mr. Moto's character was revived in a low-budget Robert Lippert production filmed in England starring Henry Silva.\n\nIn Mr. Moto Returns, a.k.a. The Return of Mr. Moto, Mr. I.A. Moto is now a member of Interpol.\n\nThe extremely tall Silva conveyed an almost James Bond-like playboy character; in the fight scenes he is clearly not proficient in martial arts. He speaks in a lazy 'Beatnik' manner.\n\nNowhere in the film is it even mentioned that Moto is Japanese. He is referred to as an \"oriental\" and, oddly, in the trailer, Moto is referred to as a \"swinging Chinese cat\". It is only when he is disguised as a Japanese oil representative, Mr. Takura, that a more stereotypical portrayal of a Japanese businessman is given.\n\n1966 7 Women Woody Strode and Mike Mazurki John Ford 1967 The Time Tunnel Arthur Batanides, Vitina Marcus, and others Sobey Martin\n\nThe episode \"Attack of the Barbarians\" takes place in 13th century East Asia and all Mongol characters, including Batu Khan are played by white actors in makeup.\n\n1968 Bewitched Richard Haydn R. Robert Rosenbaum\n\nHaydn portrays Japanese businessman, Kenzu Mishimoto in \"A Majority of Two\" (Season 4, Episode 29)."
