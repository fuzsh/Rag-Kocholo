        "text": "In David H. Hwang’s play \"M. Butterfly\" the protagonist and opera singer Song Liling utilizes gender strategically to get Rene Gallimard to fall in love with “her” but also to solicit sensitive information from him. Liling’s performance as a woman, who is biologically a man, is an allegorical critique of western assumptions about the “east” and stereotypes of women in general. Judith Butler’s notion of “gender as performance” complements and serves to advance the explicit and implicit commentary made throughout the text. Furthermore, this notion relates to Helene Cixous concept of female language and Gayatri Spivak’s argument about imperialism and cultural representation. This paper uses a framework of Butler, Cixous, and Spivak’s arguments to illustrate Hwang’s commentary and critique throughout \"M. Butterfly\".\n\nThis essay combines a close historical reading of a relatively unknown play, The Shanghai Gesture (1926), with an analysis of its transformation into a film by Josef von Sternberg in (1942). Key to my argument is how concepts of female and domestic identity interact with race precisely within the genre of the theatrical female melodrama and the cinematic form. By foregrounding genre and form as a key part of understanding this play, I show how race and gender could be ambiguous or undefined. This is illuminated when the medium and genre shift. In 1942, the play was remade into a film by Josef von Sternberg. The racial and gender ambiguity of the play becomes masculinized (and neutralized), particularly under cinema’s voyeuristic gaze and the pressures exerted upon the director and the studio by the motion picture production codes."
