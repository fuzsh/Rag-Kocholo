        "text": "Dorothy Dandridge accomplished many things in her short life; she was the first Black woman nominated for the best-actress Oscar and the first Black woman on the cover of Life magazine. But she was also plagued by ghosts. In her perceptive, often humorous autobiography, Everything and Nothing: The Dorothy Dandridge Tragedy, published in 1970—five years after her death—Dandridge and cowriter Earl Conrad lay out her search for love in candid, often luscious prose. “If it is possible for a human being to be like a haunted house,” she writes, “maybe that would be me.”\n\nThe primary ghost in Dandridge’s life was her only child, Harolyn Suzanne “Lynn” Nicholas, born in 1943 during her first marriage to dancing legend Harold Nicholas. Lynn was severely intellectually disabled, a condition Dandridge blamed on her delayed birth (Nicholas had gone golfing and left her without a car). “She’d hug me tight, crushing into my breasts,” Dandridge writes. “I have known quite a few men, since then, but I tell you, you cannot get that feeling from anything else in the world. Except this: I knew that to everyone else she was hideous.”\n\nDue to the brutal medical norms of the times, Dandridge was eventually convinced by doctors to give Lynn to a caretaker. “On the outside I said to myself, ‘I’ve had it, I’ll give her up.’ Inside I never gave her up. It was myself that I began giving up.”\n\nTo fill the hole in her heart, Dandridge threw herself into destructive romances and focused on her career as a singer and actor. In the process she encountered another ghost: that of Jim Crow. “While experiencing what seemed to be a full acceptance, I encountered not-yetness,” she writes. “Whites weren’t quite ready for full acceptance even of me, purportedly beautiful, passable, acceptable, talented, called by the critics every superlative in the lexicon employed for a talented and beautiful woman.”\n\nPills and Champagne would dull the pain—but the haunting never ceased until her death by an accidental overdose in 1965, at the age of 42. “Dorothy Dandridge, a sensitive beautiful Black woman lived a life during which she did not fail,” a defiant Earl Conrad writes in his foreword to Everything and Nothing. “The failure was that of others, Black and white, but mostly white.”\n\nThe Black Belt Treadmill\n\nBorn in Cleveland in 1922, Dorothy Dandridge had what she called a “crying childhood.” Her father was absent; her mother, Ruby (who would later have a successful acting career on shows like The Amos ’n Andy Show), worked as a cook, performing the poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar in churches on weekends. As a toddler, the adorable Dandridge made a splash performing the poem “In the Morning” for her weary mother one night, and Ruby saw a way out. “You ain’t going to work in Mr. Charley’s kitchen like me,” she told her daughter. “We’re going to fix it so you be something else than that.”\n\nShe was aided in her quest to make her daughter a star by her partner, Eloise Matthews, a.k.a. Auntie Ma-Ma—a severe piano teacher who physically and mentally abused Dandridge throughout her childhood. While Ruby wrote skits at the kitchen table, Auntie Ma-Ma taught Dandridge and her sister, Vivian, to sing and act like prim, proper ladies.\n\nSoon Ruby decided to take her daughters’ act, dubbed “the Wonder Kids,” on the road. “Mother arranged with the National Baptist convention for Vivian and me to perform at churches in a different state each month,” Dandridge writes. This contract was the family’s ticket out of poverty—“a little like having a deal with MGM for white folks.”\n\nThe whole family, including the hated Auntie Ma-Ma, went on the road. Onstage Ruby did acrobatics; the girls dressed as boy urchins and told wholesome jokes that mysteriously made the adults laugh. Dandridge describes one of their bits:\n\nVivian: I see you’re goin’ fishing. What bait you use, worms?\n\nMe: I bait the hook with cigarette butts.\n\nVivian: Gosh, what you catch with that?\n\nMe: Smoked fish.\n\nLiving on the road was hard and cramped, especially in the hot, racist South. “So many towns, cities, halls, churches…and I really saw so little,” Dandridge writes. “For all those years we slept mostly four abed. My mother and Auntie Ma-Ma slept the length of the bed, and Vivian and I were at their feet. I remember feet pushing against me night after night...When we rode a train, they used to have me curl up in a ball so they could go half fare…a time arrived when I said, ‘I have to stretch out. You’ll have to pay full fare for me from now on.’”\n\nBut there were bright spots, like a gig in Hawaii that introduced Dandridge to the wonders of volcanoes, hula, and puppy love with a local boy. By 1934, Dandridge and Vivian were performing with Etta Jones as “the Dandridge Sisters.” There were bit roles in Hollywood films and a gig at the famous Cotton Club backing Cab Calloway. That’s where Dandridge met the man who would become her first husband, Harold Nicholas.\n\nAt one gig, while she was decoratively sitting on the lap of famous dancer Bill “Mr. Bojangles” Robinson, he gave Dandridge some advice she would fail to heed. “By then he was losing his eyesight, but he spotted me as pretty. ‘Keep away from the wolves,’ he said, adding, ‘like me.’”\n\nStyle Over Substance\n\nDuring World War II, the Dandridge Sisters were booked at the Palladium in London, a city Dandridge adored even as being there meant she had to find shelter from German bombs. “During the Blitz I would take a blanket with me…and pass the time in conversation with the English. It was in the shelters that I developed an affinity with the English which has been with me always,” she writes. “When the attacks became frequent, we didn’t always go below. We sat in the hotel room and coolly drank tea like the English.”\n\nBeing a devoted Anglophile, Dandridge was already primed to fall for the actor Peter Lawford when he came to see her show at the New Frontier in Las Vegas in the early 1950s, with fellow stars June Allyson and Van Johnson. (She and Nicholas were separated, formally divorcing in 1951.) By night’s end Lawford and Dandridge peeled away from the party and found themselves alone in his car on a lovers’ lane: “Peter put his arms around me and began kissing me in a delightful, gallant English style, if kisses can have nationality,” she writes. “I liked being with him.”\n\nDandridge was enamored with the sociable Brit. He “had a free and easy style of living, talking, and thinking,” she recounts, “and he had—he’ll want to kill me for this—a touch of Errol Flynn about him.” Dandridge found comfort in cooking food from her childhood and invited Lawford into her kitchen sanctuary. One night she was cooking chitlings, one of her favorites—much to Lawford’s nauseous disgust. “Honestly,” he said, “I can’t understand anybody eating it.”\n\nOne evening, when Lawford appeared with Gary Cooper’s patrician wife, Rocky, Dandridge decided to perform a little experiment. “I thought, I’ll serve them chitlings in a tall stemmed glass,” she writes. “I’ll chop them up fine and make them into an hors d’oeuvre. I’ll put a little paprika on top, some Tabasco sauce, and parsley on the side. I’ll serve chitlings the way they’ve never been served before. I’ll set the whole thing up with pretty little forks…and serve it steaming hot.”\n\nThe ruse worked, and Lawford asked for a second helping.\n\nThe affair soon fizzled, and Dandridge came to feel conned by Lawford and his charming ways. Dandridge had let herself fall hard, knowing Lawford was ambitious and would never marry a Black woman. Still, she admits in her book, “If I were honest with myself…I would have to admit that I wanted nothing better than to hear him say, ‘marry me.’”\n\nThe Moth Men\n\nDandridge came to hate the vulnerability of working in nightclubs, growing particularly disgusted by the ravenous men constantly vying for her favors. “I wonder if I can convey how many of these you will meet if you are a roving singing star,” she writes. “You occupy a position somewhat like a flame in relation to hovering moths. The moth-men flicker around you, but they don’t get burned—you do if you don’t watch out.”\n\nThe situation was particularly delicate when the moth-man was one of the most powerful forces in the entertainment industry. In the 1950s, Dandridge was singing at El Rancho in Las Vegas. One day a creepy lackey convinced her to attend a “party” being held by Columbia studio head and notorious sexual predator Harry Cohn. Dandridge reluctantly agreed. But when taken to his hotel suite, she found herself not at a party but alone with Cohn—who started to tell her all he could do for her career.\n\nDandridge knew what was expected in return. “I was supposed to warm up, to register delight, happiness, gratitude. I was supposed to reach a sympathetic hand across the table, and he would pick it up from there. Maybe we would both stand. God knows what; maybe we would both get right down on the floor, for there wasn’t even a casting couch in this barren office. But I never reached out my hand.”\n\nSoon after rejecting Cohn, Dandridge got help from a fellow female performer when bubbly actor Marie Wilson came to see the show. “She met me in my dressing room, and it was instant friendship,” Dandridge recalls. “‘Wait here,’ she said…She returned to my dressing room with Gene Cook, theatrical editor for Life, and she suggested to him that he do a picture spread of me.”\n\nThe subsequent 1951 spread in Life was “as big a boost for my career as anything Harry Cohn could do,” Dandridge remembers. “And I didn’t have to crawl into a strange bed with a strange-looking little man for it to happen.”\n\nOn the Couch\n\nLike Marilyn Monroe, her fellow student at the Method-based Actors’ Laboratory, Dandridge was a devotee of psychoanalysis, crediting her doctors with frequently saving her life. In 1952, while singing in a show with Desi Arnaz at La Vie en Rose, she met a man just as interested in Freudian theories as she. According to Dandridge:\n\nHarry Belafonte and I had the same press agent, a woman. Harry was at the Village Vanguard, and the agent said to me, “There is only one person I know who is more beautiful than you. It’s a man, and he’s in New York now.” The agent told Harry the same thing; there was only one person more beautiful than he, and it was a woman and she was now in New York.\n\nDandridge went to the Village Vanguard to see Belafonte. “I went backstage, and when I saw him, I said, ‘Oh my goodness, he is just beautiful.’ He simply said, ‘Dorothy.’”\n\nThe two beauties began a passionate affair and found they had much in common, including their interest in psychotherapy. Therapy helped alleviate the pain and mental turmoil caused by their status as famous Black entertainers. According to Dandridge:\n\nIf you find yourself suddenly projected into a Caucasian orbit…you have an inner experience that is hard on the nerves. You must be at your best with each instant, for…you are ‘carrying the negro race.’ Negroes everywhere will recognize what I am talking about, but unless they have been thrown into the experience of having daily to deal with large numbers of Caucasians, they won’t be able to grasp what this experience can do to your neurological and psychological system.\n\nBut this love of therapy proved detrimental to a relationship. “When the language of love merges with the argot of psychiatry,” Dandridge writes, “a routine difference of opinion over a fouled-up dinner engagement” could sound like this:\n\nHarry: Look, let’s not start rejecting each other.\n\nMe: That’s easy for you to say. I’ve been a pile of anxiety here for hours.\n\nHarry: You don’t have to act that dependent, you know. You could have found things to do.\n\nMe: I expected you at eight o’clock. Why do you give me five hours of upset and insecurity?\n\nHarry: Maybe it’s because I suspect you’ll castrate me and I’m trying to defend myself.\n\nThe romance didn’t last. “Harry was searching for someone with whom he could be comfortably, clearly the dominant figure,” Dandridge laments. But they would remain friends and star together in the films Bright Road, Carmen Jones, and Island in the Sun.\n\nCold Steak and Cucumbers\n\nExcited about the prospect of playing the potentially career-making lead in the film Carmen Jones, Dandridge secured a meeting in 1954 with the legendary Austrian-born director Otto Preminger.\n\nUpon entering Preminger’s office, Dandridge encountered a type she knew well. “Otto was ugly,” she writes. “Many of those little men who run Hollywood are ugly. It is the folklore of Hollywood; the ugliness is much commented upon, it is known and understood that out of their ugliness they fashion an armor of toughness with which to prey, and rule and succeed, and these alone are the kings of Hollywood.”\n\nPreminger was equally nonplussed by Dandridge, telling her she was all wrong for the role of Carmen, a hard-living sex worker. She was too lovely and sophisticated, “a model, a beautiful butterfly.” Dandridge was unimpressed with his unimaginativeness, retorting, “I’m an actress. I can play a nun or a bitch.”\n\nShe began to embark on a campaign to prove Preminger wrong. “I hurried to Max Factor’s Studio and looked around for the right garb. I would return looking like Carmen herself. I found an old wig which, I was told, Cornel Wilde wore in one of his pictures,” she writes. “I put on heavy lipstick, worked spit curls around my face. I made myself look like a hussy.” Finally, she went to the gym for a hardcore workout to achieve “a tired look as If I had worn out a bed.”\n\nDandridge got the part. She soon got something else, a “daddy” lover, after Preminger suggested they participate in what he called a “two-two-two” while filming. “He intimated that it was good for the picture, for the people involved…If star and director know each other heart and soul—and the rest—the spark of it all might well leap into the beauty of the film.”\n\nDandridge became completely obsessed with Preminger. “He took over on me exactly as he would one of his moving picture productions. I was a production too; my dress, my life, my friends, who I saw, where I went, my perfume, my manner, my career…I did as Otto advised.\n\n“He put Champagne into my life. Always the best, only the best—that was his motto…‘Drink the richest and the best. Never settle for anything less.’”\n\nFor a time it seemed Preminger’s advice was working. Dandridge was a sensation in Carmen Jones and garnered an Oscar nomination for the role. But Dandridge came to view the four years she spent with the controlling (married) Preminger as time lost. He advised her to not take supporting roles (including one in The King and I that would be played instead by Rita Moreno) and to focus on nightclub singing.\n\nBy the time they shot 1959’s infamous Porgy and Bess, costarring Sidney Poitier, the relationship was over, and Preminger was verbally abusing her in ways he usually meted out to lesser actors. “I realized that we were in a game—I to get him, he to lose me. I had bitter nights of weeping. No one will ever know how I wept,” she writes of their relationship’s demise. “In the morning I rose like an automaton, went through my paces, off to the gym where I whirled like a dervish, then on through the rest of the dizzying day. Cold steak. Cold cucumbers. Cold.”\n\nDo Re Me\n\nBy the 1960s, Dandridge was breaking down. “I was moving around in a neurotic haze, having spasms before or after singing, sneaking in drinks, taking pills to dehydrate myself,” she writes. “I threw myself away on a few men, thinking I might as well have an orgasm as there isn’t much else.”\n\nThere was a disastrous marriage to failing nightclub owner Jack Denison, which was filled with drinking and intense fights. “Some people kill themselves with drink, others with overdoses, some with a gun; a few hurl themselves in front of trains or autos. I hurled myself in front of another white man,” she dryly recalls.\n\nDandridge was forced to file for bankruptcy after a bad investment in oil wells, and Lynn was returned to her after she failed to pay her caretaker. They had no choice but to move out of the star’s beautiful house in the L.A. hills. Lynn played the piano while the movers carted out Dandridge’s hard-earned possessions. She describes the scene:\n\nEver since early childhood she had liked to sit at the piano and play ‘do-re-me’…over and over for hours…once in a while she turned around coyly on the stool and wanted me to applaud. The truckmen noted the single themed concert and got the idea. They applauded too.\n\nPapers kept arriving and I, grinning as if this were all a routine ritual, served hamburgers, and coffee, applauded my daughter and patted the dogs. Yet inwardly I could see and feel my whole career in show business—and my whole personal life—tapping right off stage.\n\nBroke, Dandridge was forced to put Lynn in a state mental institution. She tried to climb out of her financial hole by working constantly in nightclubs, but it was never enough. She was further heartbroken when many of her friends told her not to write her autobiography, that her story was not a credit to her race. By 1965 she was tired, bewildered, and overwhelmed by heartache."
