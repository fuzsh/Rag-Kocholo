        "text": "Overview\n\nGallery\n\nSynopsis\n\nRelationships\n\nIt's fine now. Why? Because I am here!\n\nAll Might in \"Izuku Midoriya: Origin\"\n\nToshinori Yagi (八 (や) 木 (ぎ) 俊 (とし) 典 (のり) , Yagi Toshinori?), also known as All Might (オールマイト, Ōru Maito?), is the former No. 1 Pro Hero who bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace (平和の象徴, Heiwa no Shōchō?). He teaches Foundational Hero Studies at U.A. High School.\n\nAll Might was the eighth holder of the One For All Quirk after receiving it from Nana Shimura. He has since passed the torch onto Izuku Midoriya, whom he is training to be his successor. After using up all the embers of One For All to defeat All For One, All Might retired and ended his era as the world's greatest hero.[3]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nIn his empowered form, Toshinori is a massive man with an equally muscular and well-defined physique, his design resembling a typical Western comic book superhero. He has chiseled features on his face with a strong jawline, pronounced cheekbones, and bushy eyebrows. He has short blond hair, swept backward, with two distinct tufts sticking above his head, leaning slightly to each side. His robust features regularly cast a dark shadow over his face, hiding everything but his bright blue eyes.\n\nToshinori's Golden Age hero costume consisted of a skin-tight blue bodysuit decorated with a red symbol that somewhat resembles a \"Y\", designed with a white diamond at its center, with white lines connected to it that trace from his chest to his back shoulders; the lines trimmed with the aforementioned red symbol. The symbol appeared to have wings on the side that ran from atop his torso before ending around his back, over which a similar red and white design was absent of the white diamond. Large white patches lined with red covered each side of his hips before ending at his lower thighs, and he wore a gold belt with a silver buckle with red eyes. His forearm sleeves were colored in gold; each had white lines covered in blue accents over his wrists, spiked fins on the sides of his arms, and his feet were covered in shin-length gold boots trimmed with white and red accents.\n\nIn his true form, after sustaining permanent damage from All For One, Toshinori's declining health reduced him to a very skinny man with sharp, angular features and long limbs, his neck extended, his eyebrows absent and the sclera of his eyes turned black. His hair is wavy, with two long strands coming down from his hairline and framing his face. He possesses a large scar covering most of the left side of his chest, having lost his stomach and some of his lungs' respiratory system. It is common for him to spout blood from his mouth when excited or surprised. He typically wears baggy clothing to accommodate the change in body mass between forms, but after Toshinori's tenure as a hero, he starts wearing clothes that fit him in his regular form, as he no longer needs big clothes that fit his muscle form.\n\nIn his early career, Toshinori was a lean but fit young man with the same hairstyle as his true form. In his empowered state, his facial features were noticeably softer. In both his normal and empowered form, Toshinori did not have shadowed eyes on his face, fully showing his white sclerae while retaining the deep blue irises of his eyes, possibly showing how he was not a shell of his former self.\n\nDuring his final confrontation with All For One in the Final War, Toshinori dons a high-tech suit of armor dubbed the \"Armored All Might\" from his car, Hercules. The mechanical suit resembles his old hero costume and comprises several robotic pieces that can be detached and applied. It covers Toshinori's entire body, exposing only his mouth so he can still show his iconic smile.[4] Throughout the battle, Toshinori's legs are crushed, and the suit is destroyed.[5]\n\nAfter being saved from death by Katsuki and Izuku, All Might's eyes regain their white sclerae, like in his younger days, albeit still covered by shadow lines,[6] as well as his eyebrows being visualized in the aftermath of the Final War. After his legs were crushed, All Might is bound to a wheelchair while he continues to recover from his injuries.\n\nEight years later, All Might has acquired more wrinkles around his face, though his eyebrows and the white sclerae of his eyes have remained. He has also regained his ability to walk.[7]\n\nGallery[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nAll Might's hero persona appears to be derived from comic book superhero stereotypes: exuberant and filled with dramatic flair. He always protects and saves innocent people with a huge smile. The habit of smiling was ingrained in him by his mentor, Nana Shimura, who believed that the ones who smile are the ones who are the strongest. Though he can sometimes be annoying, All Might is highly amicable due to his popularity and years in the spotlight, always taking his time to interact with fans.\n\nOnce All Might reverts to his true form, he becomes reserved and solemn, avoiding attention in direct contrast to the grandiosity of his hero identity. While he's an optimist, he still ensures his goals are grounded in reality. When a Quirkless Izuku tells him about his goal of becoming a hero, All Might commends him for having a dream but reminds him to stay realistic and suggests he enter another profession that helps people. He considered the harsh words necessary to save the boy from long-term frustration. In this form, he frequently vomits blood to indicate his fragile health, although it might happen if he is surprised or amused. Regardless of which form All Might is currently taking, two personality traits always present in him are his optimism and oafishness.\n\nSince his youth, All Might had always carried a single yet burdensome goal: to become a pillar of hope that people could always rely upon during harsh times. After obtaining One For All from Nana, All Might became a hero and a legend, thanks to his seemingly endless competency and charisma. No matter who or what he faced, All Might would stand up triumphantly every time, one battle after another, inspiring the world and sending fear to the hearts of villains everywhere. All Might has a chronic ability to save as many people as possible, a trait shared with his successor. He exhausted himself and fell behind on his other hero duties, such as filing paperwork. Though he was embarrassed by it, he still gratefully accepted the offer of Sir Nighteye and (later) Naomasa Tsukauchi to file his reports.\n\nAfter his fight against All For One, he considered it necessary to keep his weakened state hidden from the public for the sake of keeping up morale. Unfortunately for All Might, injuries inflicted on his body were starting to take a toll on him. Despite the concern and warnings from some of his close associates, All Might's determination to preserve society from evil prevented him from relinquishing his role as the Symbol of Peace. His smile, a gesture that served to calm others, started becoming more of a way for All Might to hide his fears and insecurities from the general population. As time passed, All Might began to forget some of the basic principles of heroism until Izuku, in a brave attempt to save Katsuki Bakugo from the Sludge Villain's attack despite being Quirkless, rekindled his heroic spirit and taught him that something can always be done to fight injustice.\n\nAbove all else, he considers self-sacrifice the most noble action, coming in many forms for All Might, such as physically on the battlefield and mentally, sacrificing so much of his time that he barely has a private life. He believes in this core value so much that he dropped Sir Nighteye's preparations for a successor on a whim after witnessing Izuku's single act of selflessness to save Katsuki. This selflessness has aided All Might well to become a symbol, as civilians trust his words, \"Do not fear\", truly knowing he won't hesitate to save them. The dismissal of his safety eventually caught up to him, causing issues with his work and personal life. As a U.A. Teacher, he couldn't help but be distracted assisting people on his morning commute, shortening his time with his students. It also estranged All Might from Sir Nighteye, who disagreed on whether he should avoid his prophesied death or continue hero work. All Might attempted to ignore his prophesied death, keeping it secret from Izuku for a long time. At Inko Midoriya's request, he gained a new resolve to avoid it entirely; he found a more excellent value in his own life, knowing Izuku needed him as a mentor, not just a savior.\n\nIzuku has compared All Might's personality to their mentor Gran Torino since both play dumb quite often. All Might is far more intelligent and perceptive than his campy image would suggest. He has a tactical mind regarding battle strategies and public speaking. Assessing a villain's threat level, All Might skilfully applies the necessary force and avoids injuries when possible. If he's in control, he even makes dramatic performances out of their defeats as examples to other villains. His presence alone decreased Japan's crime rate to 3%. He's aware of villain tactics, such as monologuing, and actively ignores them. Only the most manipulative of villains, like All For One, can bring out rare instances of anger in All Might, such as catching him off guard and giving him a mortal injury, as well as mocking his late master, Nana, causing All Might to rise in anger, saying that he would destroy All For One's wicked ambitions and bitterly stating that the villain would die in prison.\n\nDespite his battle intelligence, his incredible powers and fame make him dissociated from others' capabilities, and Gran Torino asserted this made him ill-suited to teaching. Sometimes, All Might underestimates his students and is outsmarted as a result. Lacking teaching experience, he required a script to convey his first lesson to Class 1-A. He is reprimanded occasionally by his fellow teacher, Eraser Head, for being sometimes unavailable for his teaching duties. However, All Might bringing his typical attitude into his teaching can be beneficial, creating an energetic and motivating environment. While his U.A. coworkers respect him as a Pro Hero, they can get frustrated with his presence's conflict with the school, such as attracting journalists. He has also faced criticism from the media for attracting villains to U.A.\n\nFor Izuku especially, All Might has a habit of projecting himself onto his protégé and overestimating his limits. While All Might grew accustomed to being able to use One For All at 100% instantly, Izuku received grave injuries when he did so. After receiving multiple scoldings from Recovery Girl for encouraging Izuku's self-destructive behavior, they both realized that the boy needed to be his own hero and develop at his own pace. This self-identity is reflected when All Might told Endeavor, after the latter took his place as the Number 1 Pro Hero, to figure out what kind of symbol he wanted to be. While All Might wishes to inspire others, he is not self-righteous and sees the value of different ideologies. He also respects other professions outside of heroes, such as the Police Force, while others tend to underappreciate them.\n\nAll Might always prioritize the lives of others over his own, considering them his responsibility. Still, All Might is deeply aware that saving everybody in the world is an impossible task, which is why he sought to become a symbol who could inspire others to take action as well. While All Might is seen smiling, laughing, and being cheerful most of the time, he is highly protective of his students, showing a rare instance of rage if they're in danger. All Might is willing to go above his limits for their safety, alleviating their worries through his trademark smile. Even after his retirement, he remains ready to support the Heroes during major operations such as Mission: Humarise and the Final War.\n\nDespite having the best intentions of becoming a symbol that everyone could rely on, All Might's debut and tremendous rise in the world of Heroes also led to unintended consequences; as a result of his immense power, society began to over-rely on both him and other Heroes in general, to the extent where they would become downright ignorant in thinking that a Hero would always appear on the scene and rectify any situation, becoming more like bystanders and spectators in the process. Unfortunately, this was the very opposite of what he wanted to inspire in people, and would also be the primary catalyst of his mentor's grandson becoming a villain when no one turned to help him, causing him to be found by All For One. In other extreme cases, Endeavor would go to horrible lengths to surpass All Might, such as creating his son, Shoto, and brutally training him from a young age to have him surpass All Might as his father's successor. Furthermore, fanatics such as Stain believed that All Might was the true example of what every hero should be and killed those the Hero Killer believed were unworthy and did not meet his standards.\n\nAnother negative aspect of All Might's drive to be the Symbol of Peace is that he tends to have a self-deprecating view of himself, not seeing himself as the paragon most people view him as, but instead feeling the full brunt of his responsibilities (though he can at times be humorously self-absorbed, such as having a ringtone and email notification of his own voice). Following the injuries given to him by All For One, which limited his muscle form to only a few hours a day, All Might was aware that he wasn't the powerful hero he once was in his prime, but still put on a brave face to fight villains and put the public at ease, knowing that he couldn't continue being the Symbol of Peace forever, a problem that even All Might couldn't outrun. Due to the stresses of acting like the ideal hero while fearing being found out in his hero persona, he seems to have developed a minor case of imposter syndrome. As a result of this and his selfless nature, All Might has a habit of placing burdens on himself and being very self-critical. When Izuku left him behind to deal with All For One's forces and began distancing himself from everyone in fear for their well-being, All Might fell into harsh dejection, chiding his now-retired self for being unable to help and feeling as though he was only dragging everyone down in his now powerless state. It would take Stain, of all people, to show All Might that there are still civilians and heroes who recognize the heroic legacy he left behind and will continue fighting for what's right, even in the face of hopelessness.\n\nAll Might has a fatherly attitude towards his students (his successor Izuku, in particular) and takes pride in helping their development as future heroes, being quick to give encouraging advice and celebrate their accomplishments, but he's also not afraid of pushing them further, even if he ends up going a bit too far. All Might has the habit of adding \"young\" (少年, Shonen?) to the surname of his students whenever he is speaking out loud or thinking to himself (ex. \"Young Midoriya\").\n\nHowever, he is the most ruthless of all the teachers during the Final Exams Arc. Like his hero persona, All Might can put on a theatrical villain one, doing it to bring out the full potential of others with rough love. His sheer intimidation alone was, according to Izuku, similar to that of Stain. When Katsuki stated that he'd rather lose than seek Izuku's assistance, All Might was more than willing to force Katsuki to lose. He also punched Katsuki hard enough for him to vomit, showing he will not hold back and is ready to injure his students if that means they'll pass the exams properly. All Might would even go as far as to crack Izuku's back and crush them both under his boot (all of which earned him a severe scolding by Recovery Girl). He later admitted that while he cares a lot about saving people (like Izuku), he also cares a lot about winning (like Katsuki).\n\nAbilities[]\n\nOverall Abilities: While officially earning the rank of the Number 1 hero of Japan, All Might was also well-recognized as the strongest and greatest hero in the world. He was the \"Symbol of Peace\" and such a deterrent against crime that villains were primarily discouraged by his presence in society, single-handedly bringing near-absolute stability throughout Japan, a stark contrast to the rest of the world. He defeated All For One, infamously known as the world's most powerful villain, twice, a feat that all the previous wielders of One For All could not. Despite winning, All Might suffered a gruesome injury at the hands of All For One that limited his maximum power output going forward, gradually reducing his sheer might and how long he could use his power.\n\nAfter his Quirk was constrained by his injuries, and even after he passed it onto Izuku, relying on the residual energy of One For All, All Might's power and capabilities were still unmatched by any other hero, despite his strength and time limit decreasing more rapidly. Against Izuku and Katsuki, who are among Class 1-A's elites, he completely dominated them in their fight, even while wearing high-density weights. Forced to break the limiter placed on his Quirk again, All Might defeated All For One by using up his remaining power reserves.\n\nEven though he is unable to keep his hero form for more than a few seconds after his rematch with All For One, All Might still keeps a keen intuition and sharp reflexes, which helped him hone his skills as a hero ever since he acquired his powers. This intuition is shown in his observations regarding Izuku's use of One For All, and the fact that he was capable of catching one of Mei Hatsume's \"babies\" coming in from behind with minimal effort in his standard form.\n\nDespite his skinny physique in his true form, he is actually quite physically able, but isn't as powerful as when he possessed One For All. Even then, he retains some of the fighting skills necessary for the Final War. With his new support item, the Armored All Might, he was able to stand up against his arch-nemesis, All For One, whose body was being rewinded back to his physical prime due to the effects of the reversed-engineered Quirk-Destroying Drug. Despite All For One becoming younger and more powerful, All Might can compensate for his lost power by applying some of his students' skills and Quirks into the Armored All Might, enabling him to fight more creatively instead of relying on brute force like before. He also uses All For One's mental instability to distract him, mainly using his still-exposed smile to trigger his rage.\n\nTrained Muscles: Usage of One For All requires the user to have strong muscles, as One For All is a lot to handle and could cause the user's body to be blown apart if they don't possess the necessary body strength. Gran Torino said that All Might, in particular, had a strong body that allowed him to master One For All much faster than previous users.\n\nIndomitable Will: All Might's will is evident in all his actions as a hero. He is known for saving people with a smile and his catchphrase, \"I am here,\" two facets of being the Symbol of Peace. During the pinnacle of his battle against the U.S.J. Nomu, All Might remembered his resolve to be the Symbol of Peace, and his resolution allowed him to push beyond 100% of his power to defeat the artificial human finally. Another prominent spectacle featuring All Might's willpower was during his last two showdowns with All For One.\n\nOne of All For One's primary strategies in their fight was to wear down All Might psychologically, such as taunting All Might by mentioning the latter's former mentor and predecessor, Nana, as well as revealing that Tomura Shigaraki is her grandson. The first taunt enraged All Might, while Tomura's kinship to Nana made him despair greatly. However, despite the guerrilla warfare employed by All For One, All Might remember Nana's teachings on heroism and re-established his will, enabling the weakened hero to muster up some of his remaining power to continue fighting. Worn out of his muscle form and faced with inevitable defeat at the hands of a virtually unscathed All For One, All Might could still channel what was left of One For All to defeat All For One in a single strike. All Might possess a powerful presence that has struck fear into others, such as Izuku and Katsuki, during the Final Exam. This aura was strong enough to cause two villains to freeze in terror even though they'd been prepared to kill him and despite him being powerless.[8] Even when All For One crushed his spine and legs, destroyed his armored suit, and blew him away, All Might's unwavering spirit presses him on to keep fighting.[5]\n\nTeaching: While All Might has shown to be a poor teacher on occasion, as he lacks proper teaching practice and required a script for his first lesson, he does show to have his exceptions regarding training and hero practice. All Might was able to help train Izuku Midoriya's skinny body into a muscled vessel for One For All, having created a training regimen that would allow Izuku to train up his body and safely inherit his Quirk in the limited space of ten months. Furthermore, he realized that Izuku had been deliberately pushing himself to go even further, revealing that he designed the regimen so Izuku could train his body correctly but without completely exhausting himself. This insight shows that All Might greatly understands physical training and the human body's limits. His first practical battle lesson was also designed realistically, with him giving the villain team earpieces to communicate and a map of the building. In contrast, the hero team would only go in without said advantages, replicating a similar experience to heroes storming a villain's hideaway without proper preparation. He also assigned 1-A's partners randomly, as Izuku pointed out that Pro Heroes often have to team up on the spot and use their collaborative skills.\n\nFollowing his retirement, it is revealed that he's studied teaching more intently from a guidebook, as he commended Izuku for having developed his fighting style and was also seen advising Kyoka Jiro during 1-A's Ultimate Move training. This counsel shows that All Might has improved in providing verbal advice and feedback to his students, realizing the steps he needs to take to motivate them without giving them the complete answer.\n\nFormer Quirk[]\n\nOne For All (ワン・フォー・オール, Wan Fō Ōru?): Transferred to him from Nana Shimura, Toshinori's Quirk allowed him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, significantly enhancing all of his physical abilities to a superhuman level, resulting in unbelievable feats of strength, speed, agility, and durability. Unlike other known users of this Quirk, Toshinori was noted to have an innate instinct for wielding it, mastering it almost instantly with no aid from his teachers. Also, seemingly unique to him, Toshinori's mastery of this Quirk enabled him to morph himself into a towering, powerfully built man to hide his identity from society.\n\nAll Might was so proficient with One For All that he was widely known as the world's most powerful person. During the peak of his abilities, he's been shown to deal with many threats at once in mere seconds effortlessly, and even after being grievously injured by All For One and having started the process of transferring One For All to Izuku, he was still capable of achieving tremendous feats above everyone.\n\nDespite no longer possessing One For All, Toshinori still has a connection with the Quirk. During the time he held One For All, a portion of his consciousness was imprinted into the Quirk itself, creating a vestige in One For All's mental landscape. This connection allows Toshinori to unconsciously provide the other vestiges information that he learns while also allowing Toshinori to sense the vestiges in One For All and Izuku through a kind of psychic link similar to All For One's connection with Tomura.\n\nImmense Strength: All Might's most distinguishable trait was his boundless levels of physical strength. A single punch from All Might could not only defeat a villain but completely change the weather subsequently. It also can destroy several city blocks from the wind pressure it creates. Despite becoming severely weakened since first meeting Izuku, All Might's pure, overwhelming strength is still comparable to that of a nuclear device. He quite literally beat the Shock Absorption out of Nomu, forced Izuku and Katsuki into fleeing rather than continue fighting him head-on, and clashed with All For One's attacks and cancel out their highly destructive power with brute strength alone. After defeating Nomu, All Might himself admitted that, compared to his prime, in which he could've defeated Nomu with five hits, it took over 300 blows to defeat the bio-engineered creature. This comparison is another testament to All Might's weakened state.\n\nImmense Speed: With his immense physical strength, All Might also possessed equally impressive speed. When he arrived at the U.S.J., All Might moved a remarkable distance from the gate and simultaneously incapacitated villains in the blink of an eye. Tomura even says that he could not track his movements despite the latter being slower than he once was. All Might was also able to defeat multiple Nomu swiftly and travel 5 kilometers from the League of Villains Bar towards All For One's location at the Nomu Factory, all in thirty seconds after the Nomu was warped by All For One himself. However, according to All For One, this was much slower than what All Might was initially able to accomplish in his prime. Even in his weakened state, he was fast enough to travel from Might Tower to the Tokyo Egg in seconds. In his prime, he proved swift enough to single-handedly defeat the army of Instant Villains created by All For One and save nearby children all in three seconds.[9]\n\nImmense Durability: All Might held extreme durability, to the point of being almost entirely invulnerable to attacks. He sustained no life-threatening damage from his battle with the U.S.J. Nomu and took point-blank, full-power explosions from Katsuki without showing any signs of injury. All Might even survived All For One's enhanced Air Cannon, a move that can cause catastrophic, city-wide damage due to being amalgamated with many other Quirks and emerged virtually unharmed, albeit with only some minor scratches.\n\nImmense Stamina: In his prime years, it was noticed that All Might has never been shown to be exhausted, even when fighting against multiple villains. The only time that All Might was shown to be panting and out of breath was against All For One and the U.S.J. Nomu, and those cases were only due to the injury he received from the former six years prior that also limited All Might from using the maximum output of One For All. In his prime, All Might could do more than seventy-two consecutive hours of hero work and still had enough energy to respond to an emergency call in Osaka.[10]\n\nUltimate Moves[]\n\nCalifornia Smash (カリフォルニア スマッシュ, Kariforunia Sumasshu?): All Might attacks with a frontal somersault to build up momentum and air pressure and is then released in a smash.\n\nCarolina Smash (カロライナスマッシュ, Karoraina Sumasshu?): All Might runs towards an enemy while keeping his hands in a cross position, then in a downwards cross chop to the enemy's head. This move is first used against Tomura, but it is intercepted by a Nomu, who withstood the full force of the attack, seemingly unharmed.[11]\n\nDetroit Smash (デトロイトスマッシュ, Detoroito Sumasshu?): All Might performs that same attack as Texas Smash except this move is with a downward punch instead of a straight punch. The punch is powerful enough to create a shock wave large and powerful enough to clear the weather. This move is first used to save Izuku and Katsuki from the Sludge Villain.[12]\n\nDouble Detroit Smash (ダブルデトロイトスマッシュ, Daburu Detoroito Sumasshu?): All Might and Izuku use One For All at 100% and combine their Detroit Smash attacks to create a smash more powerful than anything they can accomplish alone. First used this move to defeat Wolfram.[13]\n\nMissouri Smash (ミズーリースマッシュ, Mizūrī Sumasshu?): All Might runs towards an enemy while keeping his hand flat and hits the enemy on the head while running past them in order to knock them out. This move is first used against Habit Headgear.[14]\n\nNebraska Smash (ネブラスカスマッシュ, Neburasuka Sumasshu?): While throwing a punch, All Might rotates his arm to create a tornado. This move is first used to destroy a swarm of two hundred Mini-Bombers.[15]\n\nNew Hampshire Smash (ニューハンプシャースマッシュ, Nyūhanpushā Sumasshu?): All Might punches the air while in the air to propel himself backwards towards his enemy and smashes his body into the enemy, crushing and injuring the enemy with his great weight. This move is first used to propel himself at Izuku.[16]\n\nOklahoma Smash (オクラホマスマッシュ, Okurahoma Sumasshu?): All Might whirls around while enemies have latched onto him, spinning with enough force that when they are released, they are easily thrown through concrete. This move is first used against Nomu however it was named during the Kamino Ward Incident.[17]\n\nTexas Smash (テキサススマッシュ, Tekisasu Sumasshu?): All Might throws a punch in order to create wind pressure in order to blow objects and people away. This move is first used to save Izuku from the Sludge Villain.[12]\n\nUnited States of Smash (ユナイテッド ステイツ オブ スマッシュ, Yunaiteddo Suteitesu Obu Sumasshu?): All Might throws an immensely powerful punch and smashes his target into the ground. As All Might's final and strongest move, the impact of this smash is so great that it can not only reverberate shockwaves and leave massive craters in the ground, but also spawn twisters powerful enough to carry nearby buildings. This move was used to defeat All For One and marked the end of All Might's hero career.[18]\n\nShoot Style Smash (シュートスタイル スマッシュ, Shūto Sutairu Sumasshu?): Using the Armored All Might support item, All Might delivers a powerful kick to his opponent.[4] This move is directly inspired by Izuku and his Full Cowl - Shoot Style technique.\n\nStats[]\n\nPower 6/5 S Speed 6/5 S Technique 6/5 S Intelligence 6/5 S Cooperativeness 6/5 S\n\nToshinori's stats, according to the Ultra Archive Book\n\nPower 6/6 S+ Speed 6/6 S+ Technique 6/6 S Wits 6/6 S Charisma 6/6 S+\n\nToshinori's stats, according to the Ultra Analysis Book\n\nEquipment[]\n\nHigh Density Weights (超圧縮おもり, Chō Asshuku Omori?): All Might and the rest of the teachers use these bracelets to give themselves a handicap while they are fighting their students during the Final Exams Arc.\n\nAir Pressure Shooting Torso Armor: At one point, All Might wore armor over his torso that was designed to aid him in releasing shots of pressurized air. It was designed to work with 20-30% of his power. Due to All Might's close-range fighting style, the bulky armor ended up being more baggage than it was worth, and it kept breaking, so All Might decided to stop using it.\n\nHercules (エルクレス, Erukuresu?): During the Dark Hero Arc, All Might begins driving a heavily armoured car known as Hercules, which has been shown to be able to survive a point-blank grenade explosion with minimal damage.\n\nArmored All Might (アーマードオールマイト, Āmādo Ōru Maito?): During the Final War Arc, as All Might prepares to face All For One once more, this car, alongside the briefcase All Might has been carrying since he obtained Hercules, breaks apart and form themselves around his body as a protective suit of armor.\n\nBattles & Events[]\n\nBattles & Events\n\nHistory\n\nNana Shimura vs. All For One\n\nAll Might vs. L.A.

He also had less of a role in the story, being just a veteran hero who would encourage the main character to try to become a hero even if he didn't have a Quirk, instead of a recurring mentor figure.\n\nAll Might's preliminary designs were also deemed \"lame\" by Horikoshi's editors, prompting him to make All Might more imposing and slightly younger-looking.\n\nAll Might's real name contains the kanji for \"eight\" (八, ya?), \"tree\" (木, gi?), \"genius\" (俊, toshi?) and \"law\" (典, nori?).\n\nAccording to All Might's Volume 1 profile:\n\nHis favorite things are movies and the cedars from Yakushima.\n\nDrawing a frontal shot of All Might is extremely taxing to Kohei Horikoshi, likely due to the excessive amount of shading present in his design.\n\nIn his true form, All Might's glistering pupils are meant to represent his strength and purity when his muscle form isn't active.\n\nHis catchphrase \"I am here\" (Dub: \"A Phone Call is Here!\") is his phone's ringtone.\n\nThe same thing goes for his email, which has a notification sound of \"An email is here!\".\n\nAll Might's hero agency is located somewhere in Roppongi in Minato, Tokyo.\n\nDuring his time as a hero, the true details of All Might's Quirk were kept secret, to the point where it was one of the world's greatest mysteries. Whenever asked about it in interviews, he would simply joke and dodge the question.[19]\n\nAll Might's signature moves are named after states and cities in the United States, with his ultimate move being called United States of Smash.\n\nIn addition, his costume colors are also based off the United States' flag colors (red, white, and blue).\n\nAll Might's rankings in the Popularity Polls are as follows:\n\nAll Might ranked 5th in the First Popularity Poll\n\nAll Might ranked 6th in the Second Popularity Poll.\n\nAll Might ranked 7th in the Third Popularity Poll.\n\nAll Might ranked 10th in the Fourth Popularity Poll.\n\nAll Might ranked 13th in the Fifth Popularity Poll.\n\nThe anime mistakenly depicts All Might's scar on the left side of his stomach, rather than the left side of his chest, as it is in the manga.\n\nAll Might is a non-drinker, likely due to him lacking a stomach as well as health reasons related to his injury.[20][21]\n\nAll Might shares his birthday with Cow Lady.\n\nAll Might wielded One For All the longest of any of the users, for a total of forty years.\n\nAll Might makes a cameo in Chapter 10 of the Shonen Jump/Marvel crossover book, Deadpool: Samurai.\n\nHis appearance also featured both reused and newly drawn art by Horikoshi himself.\n\nAll Might's Japanese voice actor, Kenta Miyake, also voices Dark Might.\n\nDuring the Jump Panel at San Diego Comic Con in 2018, Horikoshi answered a question, stating that All Might is not based on anyone in real life, but rather Son Goku from the Dragon Ball series.[22]\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"It's fine now. Why? Because I am here!\"[23]\n\n\"I smile to show the pressure of heroes and to trick the fear inside of me.\"[12]\n\n\"I cannot simply say 'you can become a hero even without power'.\"[12]\n\n\"I really am pathetic. Even though I admonished you, I wasn't putting what I said into practice! Pros are always risking their lives!\"[12]\n\n\"You can become a hero!\"[12]\n\n\"You're next.\"[18]\n\n\"Now, it's your turn.\"[24]\n\n(To All For One) \"You must remember the endless warring that got us here... and now I hear that Tomura Shigaraki's hatred is even affecting your original body... so I'm thinking... you won't be able to ignore me. Isn't that right? I... am here.[25]\n\n(To Naomasa) \"We've known each other long enough that you should realize something, my dear friend!! Not once... in my entire life... have I gone into battle expecting to lose!!\"[4]\n\nReferences[]\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nU.A.
