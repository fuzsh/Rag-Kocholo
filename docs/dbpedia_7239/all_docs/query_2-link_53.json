        "text": "Robert B. Mantell, dean of American Shakespearean actors, made his début as a screen star yesterday simultaneously in the Riverside Theatre and the Academy of Music. The picture, which was from the studios of William Fox, was entitled \"The Blindness of Devotion.\" If the title does not suggest the scenario, read this from the program:The story combines beauty, love, hatred, revenge, and action in a powerful and interesting manner. The plot deals with the marriage for money of Renee Delaveaux, an adventuress, to Count de Carney. The Count is the guardian of Pierre Cavereaux, a young soldier who, while visiting the Count, carries on a disgraceful intrigue with Renee. Another complication arises when Pierre, growing tired of Renee's fascinations, meets and loves Bella, the Count's beautiful niece. The Count discovers the liaison between Renee and Pierre but Bella, who is also aware of the affair, disarms suspicion by entering into a loveless marriage with Pierre. The sleeping demon in Renee's soul is aroused by this action and she attempts to poison the Count but fate rules against her, bringing this remarkable drama to a climax of overwhelming power and surprising realism.Undoubtedly Mr. Mantell is paid well for his services in his new field of endeavor, and he should be. For an actor who has devoted so many years to the classics, and who could probably recite from memory every line Shakespeare ever wrote in a play, to have to grimace through such a wordless drama must be something of a trial.John Luther Long's story, \"Madame Butterfly,\" after having been dramatized and made into an opera has finally reached the movies. A picture version was shown yesterday in the Strand, with Mary Pickford in the rôle of Cho Cho San. David Belasco explained at great length last week that the picture was not based on his version. The screen arrangement was taken directly from Mr. Long's book. Miss Pickford made an attractive Japanese maiden, her diminutive stature being well adapted to the character. But notwithstanding her size and her black wig, she looked more Occidental than Oriental.Another Famous Players film is \"Still Waters,\" exhibited in the Broadway Theatre. Marguerite Clark is its star, and in the rôle of a child of the circus who finally is restored to the grandfather who became estranged with his daughter when she married a circus performer she is alluring in her girlish and fragile beauty. The grandfather is a canal boat captain, whence the title. In addition to scenes along the canal there are some glimpses of circus life.One feature of the movies in their favor is their silent nature. Were they otherwise a nervous person could not patronize them, so full of shooting are they. But with the camera as a silencer one may sit and watch with immunity. In the new Triangle film, \"The Lily and the Rose,\" for instance, the husband, being disappointed, shoots himself, as movie husbands are apt to do. But so quietly does he do it, thanks to the silent cinema, that the audience doesn't realize he is dead till the Rose finds him The photography of the picture is unusually good."
