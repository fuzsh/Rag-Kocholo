        "text": "I didn’t like this film because of the sheer lack of action, adventure and no taste of interest, but more of actual truth. My view on it is that the point of a film is to enjoy it and sacrifice general knowledge for interest and a hook to the reader. The film itself is more about logic than entertainment, thus not giving the standard entertainment expected of an average black and white film from the 90s. The film is like a sort of 3rd person autobiography of a blind and deaf girl by the name of Helen Keller. She had been hit by an illness from the age of about 8 months so it didn’t come all of a shock to her. Her father recruited a young and also short sighted teacher to help Helen in her life.(To see what happens in further depths of the film I recommend you watch the film itself). I’m assuming this film won an Oscar film award by its life-like/realistic standards, NOT by entertainment and popularity as is currently the usual winning terms and goals of a modern day idea of a decent film. Overall this film is not good or perfect, but at the same time not a let down. So I will not tell you whether to do or do not watch this film, I am going to leave it on you to decide. (Happy Easter everybody :)\n\nPrint this review"
