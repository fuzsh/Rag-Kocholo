A long lens shot of Martin Scorsese posing for photos on the lawn of All Souls College.

Following the Encaenia ceremony itself the honorary degree recipients and VIP's make their way to All Souls College for lunch. Following leisurely drinks on the lawn they file into the Dining Hall. I suspected that the Graduands would enter the hall last so I hung around for a while and got this shot through the gates just as he was about to disappear inside.

From Wikipedia : "Martin Charles Scorsese (born November 17, 1942) is an American director, producer, screenwriter, actor and film historian, whose career spans more than 50 years. Scorsese's body of work addresses such themes as Sicilian-American identity, Roman Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, faith, machismo, modern crime, and gang conflict. Many of his films are also known for their depiction of violence and liberal use of profanity.

Part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential filmmakers in cinematic history. In 1990, he founded The Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation, and in 2007 he founded the World Cinema Foundation. He is a recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award for his contributions to the cinema, and has won an Academy Award, a Palme d'Or, Cannes Film Festival Best Director Award, Silver Lion, Grammy Award, Emmys, Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and DGA Awards."
