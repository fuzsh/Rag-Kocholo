        "text": "This chapter begins with a discussion of the influence of Little Italy's history on Scorsese's work, before turning to establish the theoretical foundation for considering his relationship to and representation of urban space. From there, the author consider four of the director's films such as Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, After Hours, and Gangs of New York. Chronologically, these films represent a diverse cross section of the director's career, but thematically all are linked in a shared engagement with the city spaces of New York. In offering close readings of the roles of boundary and transgression in these films, the author aims to highlight the important ways in which Scorsese's films focus attention on cinema's engagement with the urban, and helps to think about the ways in which the cinema, as a storytelling medium, helps to produce new understandings of urban space.\n\nTracing the collaboration between Dylan and Scorsese from the 1960s to the Netflix original 'The Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese' (2019), this article argues that the mutual respect of the two artists rests on a shared contestation of borders between fact and fiction. In the spirit of romanticism, both Dylan and Scorsese manage to maintain their unique style as they continue to create new teams as well as audiences.\n\nAlthough Martin Scorsese's interest in matters of immigration is well-explored, especially in regard to larger European communities like the Italian and Irish Americans, there is still a lack of scholarly attention to Scorsese's cinematic treatment of African Americans. A close reading of both \"Gangs of New York\" and \"Taxi Driver\" will serve as a starting point to tease out how depictions of African Americans in these movies fit into Scorsese's larger American narrative.\n\nThis discussion of 'Goodfellas' was not included when my thesis was published as 'Bakhtin & The Movies' in 2009. Written in 2000, it brings together the various Bakhtinian concepts used earlier in the work and focuses them on a case study of 'Goodfellas'. The concepts I try to demonstrate in the film include 'dark carnival', chronotope, biography and Author/Hero (polyphonic) relations. Scorsese's use of popular music and other temporal/narrational aspects are also addressed."
