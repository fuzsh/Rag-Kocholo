        "text": "Ken Loach (born June 17, 1936, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England) is a British director whose works are considered landmarks of social realism.\n\nLoach studied law at St. Peter’s College, Oxford, but while there he became interested in acting. After graduating in 1957, he spent two years in the Royal Air Force and then began a career in the dramatic arts. He worked first as an actor in regional theatre companies and then as a director for BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) television.\n\nIn the 1960s Loach directed several docudramas for a television series called The Wednesday Play. One of the productions, Cathy Come Home (1966), explored the disintegration of a working-class family and examined the intertwined issues of unemployment and homelessness. In doing so, it helped bring the discussion of homelessness into the British mainstream. In 2000 Cathy Come Home was ranked second by the British Film Institute on a list of the all-time top 100 British television programs.\n\nLoach continued to address social issues on television and later in theatrical releases as well. His first feature film, Poor Cow (1967), focuses on the life of a working-class woman whose husband is in jail. It was followed by the poignant Kes (1970), about a boy, abused at home and school, who befriends a fledgling kestrel. That film received much acclaim, including a nomination for best picture at the British Academy Film Awards. Loach investigated similar themes of class and society in such films as Which Side Are You On? (1984), a television movie that provoked controversy for its sympathetic look at striking coal miners. He gained further attention with Hidden Agenda (1990), a political thriller set in Northern Ireland, which shared the jury prize at the Cannes film festival. Loach’s next two films were relatively lighthearted, even comic, affairs, though they remained grounded in the everyday realities of the British working class: Riff-Raff (1991) depicts the travails of a London construction crew, and Raining Stones (1993) follows a man searching for money to buy a dress for his daughter. The latter took the jury prize at Cannes. Loach also received praise for Ladybird Ladybird (1994), a downbeat portrayal of a single mother struggling to hold her family together in the face of bureaucratic obstacles.\n\nLoach’s subsequent films included Bread and Roses (2000), starring Adrien Brody, which tells a story of janitors in Los Angeles in pursuit of better working conditions, and The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), an affecting portrait of Irish Republicans in 1920 during their fight against British rule. The latter won the Cannes film festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or. Route Irish (2010) depicts the quest of a security contractor in Iraq to determine the true cause of his friend’s death, and The Angels’ Share (2012) tells the comedic tale of a young Glaswegian hooligan whose nose for Scotch whisky inspires him to steal from an expensive cask. The latter movie earned another jury prize at Cannes. Loach’s film I, Daniel Blake (2016), about a man who survives a heart attack only to deal with government and medical bureaucracies, also won the Palme d’Or. In Sorry We Missed You (2019), a family’s attempt to use the gig economy to get ahead leaves them increasingly far behind."
