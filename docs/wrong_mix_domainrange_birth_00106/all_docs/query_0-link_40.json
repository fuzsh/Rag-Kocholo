        "text": "1. FINAL PROJECT Professor Catalin Zidaru Student Aliaksandra Rabtsava December 16,2014 Client: The Museum of Modern Art (MoMa) Mission statement: Founded in 1929 as an educational institution, The Museum of Modern Art is dedicated to being the foremost museum of modern art in the world, by establishing, preserving, and documenting a permanent collection of the highest order that reﬂects the vitality, complexity and unfolding patterns of modern and contemporary art. Exhibition of Martin Scorsese: “SIMPLE IS HARD”\n\n2. When we think about Martin Scorsese, what are the ﬁrst images and thoughts that come to our mind? Is it a speciﬁc movie or a scene of his, a character or an actor that he introduced in his works? Or may be it is a picture of him enthusiastically generating ideas during the movie-shooting? My goal for the exhibit “Simple is hard” is for each and every visitor to ﬁnd what it is,that he/she envisions when thinking about Martin Scorsese, at the same time adding more information focusing on his best works and understanding his words “Sometimes when you’re heavy into the shooting or editing of a picture, you get to the point where you don’t know if you could ever do it again. There’s no such thing as simple. Simple is hard”. By no means, the exhibition makes an attempt to have a ﬁnal say on a career that’s far from over. Instead, it’s like the beginning of an adventure, a digging into the depths of an incomplete creation. WHO: Martin Scorsese is an American icon. If there ever were a quintessential American director that captured Americana so well throughout his whole career, it would be Martin Scorsese. Martin Charles Scorsese is an American ﬁlm director, screenwriter, producer, actor, and ﬁlm historian.He was born November 17, 1942, in Flushing, New York. Martin Scorsese is known for his gritty, meticulous ﬁlmmaking style. Scorsese’s passion for ﬁlms started at a young age, as he was an 8-year-old pint-sized ﬁlmmaker. In 1968, he completed his ﬁrst feature-length ﬁlm, Who’s That Knocking at My Door?, but it wasn’t until he released Taxi Driver nearly 10 years later that he skyrocketed to fame for his raw formula of storytelling. Scorsese was raised a devout Catholic and even entertained the idea of entering the priesthood before deciding to pursue ﬁlmmaking instead. Although his parents “didn’t get” his mania for movies, Scorsese felt he was headed in the right direction when a 10-minute comedy short earned him a $500 scholarship to New York University.After completing his MFA in ﬁlm directing at NYU in 1966, Scorsese brieﬂy worked at the university as a ﬁlm instructor. In 1973, he directed Mean Streets, his ﬁrst ﬁlm to be widely acknowledged as a masterpiece.The ﬁlm showcased elements that have since become trademarks of Scorsese’s ﬁlmmaking: dark themes, unsympathetic lead characters, religion, the Maﬁa, unusual camera techniques and contemporary music. Directing Mean\n\n3. Streets also introduced Scorsese to Robert De Niro, sparking one of the most dynamic ﬁlmmaking partnerships in Hollywood history. The past decade has also highlighted a renewed vigor in Scorsese’s feature-ﬁlm offerings. Leonardo DiCaprio has become Scorsese’s go-to actor for lead roles, starring in Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006) which won Scorsese his ﬁrst Best Director Oscar—and Shutter Island (2010). WHAT: “SIMPLE IS HARD”(name of the exhibit) -Some episodes from the director`s documentary and some of the scripts/drafts of his most recognizable movies to be able to penetrate into his thoughts and understand even in more details what he wanted to deliver making this or that movie; -A special guest, whose career was inﬂuenced a lot by Martin Scorsese and who has worked on 5 movies with him; -Martin Scorsese himself will appear at the press-conference,which will take place towards the end of the exhibition; WHY:Martin Scorsese is a signiﬁcant ﬁgure,whose body of work has spanned from the late 1960s to the present day,making him America`s greatest living director. Answering the question “WHY” from my own prospective, i can say,that this producer hooked me,because i believe in my brother, who has always wanted to be a director/producer and a cameraman in Hollywood. I`ve always been close with my brother, but now, living in different countries our relationships became even warmer and more important to me. He is 7 years older, so since i can remember myself I have always heard about his dream becoming a Hollywood director and my mom always supported him, so did I.My brother followed his dream and graduated from a Film Academy in Minsk. Unfortunately, in Belarus( my home country) ﬁlm industry is not as developed as it is in the USA, but my brother is mostly happy with what he does working on a popular TV-channel, shooting weddings and sometimes scenes for russian movies with a hope to get bigger opportunities in his career. Reading Martin Scorsese`s biography and his way of becoming who he is today, i think of my brother and want to encourage him by telling about this American icon. TREATMENT:\n\n4. As we enter the exhibit we hear a contemporary music, the one that is often used by the director in his movies. Young ladies in ofﬁcial dresses are welcoming all the guests handing out the booklets with Scorsese`s short biography and ﬁlmography. The big room is very light and spacious, gives the feeling of freedom, helping us to feel the way Martin Scorsese felt making his movies. First,we see pictures of Martin in his 20-30th (the beginning of his career) telling us about his ﬁrst works. Then we are moving to another part of the room and can learn about his life within the next 20-30 years with the highlights on the most popular events and achievements in his career. All this pictures are hanging on the white walls; we see him in school, shooting movies, receiving awards as well as photos with other celebrities. On entering another room we can see 5 tablets on stands,where we can see the producer`s scripts and storyboards with his own handwritten notes, diagrams and other various scribblings to give us an idea of his speciﬁc method of crafting every single shot in his works. Moreover, we are able to watch some episodes from his most popular movies as well as most captivating trailers on a big screen. Throughout the exhibition we can see 5 persons with special badges, designated to answer our questions and talk to us about Martin Scorsese`s life and works. On the whole the atmosphere is very relaxed and appealing. The highlight of the exhibit will be a press-conference involving Martin Scorsese himself and Leonardo DiCaprio. This part of the exhibit will take place around 6 pm and a medium-size conference room will be set up for this. There will be journalists from TV-channels, magazines and newspapers.

MOMA / WELCOMING HALL / DRINKS As people proceed inside of the building, they will ﬁrst ﬁnd themselves in a medium size room with a pop music playing quite loudly,making the atmosphere relaxed, so that the visitors feel free to mingle and be able to perceive the exhibition. The color of the walls is tan, which symbolizes elegance and trust. There will be hanging posters of Scorsese`s most recognizable movies on it. This room will have a little bar, where 3 bartenders will be glad to provide the guests with drinks. catalin: what exactly do you mean by “perceive the exhibition”? this is very broad 3 INT. MOMA / A HALLWAY / INTRODUCTION In order to go further, the visitors will walk through the hallway. It has very light walls and high ceilings, but it`s dark there, so all the guests will focus on are 2 big plasma screens on both sides featuring Martin Scorsese`s documentary. I am giving this room a special purpose: an introduction and helping the guests to tune in the desired fashion. catalin: what is the documentary about? 4.INT.MOMA / EXPOSITION #1 Walking with the drinks to the next room visitors will appear in a big spacious room/hall with high ceilings and white walls, it can ﬁt about 400 people. 4 music speakers are set up in the corners of the room playing contemporary music.\n\n6. One side of the room is devoted to Martin`s life in his 20-30th and the beginning of his career as a director. It has 70 pictures on the wall,all of them telling us his story,showing his life in speciﬁc situations and some of them have paragraphs next to them with more details and explanations. On the other side of the room there are about 70 pictures as well; they are narrating the visitors about the continuation of his career: Martin during the movie shoots, most successful movies, received awards. Besides, there will be pictures making an emphasis on the correlation of M. Scorsese with the famous actor- Leonardo DiCaprio,whose career was inﬂuenced by Martin a lot. Leaving this room, I would like every visitor to feel like they gained more information about Scorsese`s life, more details about the process of a movie making and have a clear understanding of how much effort Martin put in order to become who is is today. catalin: is there a speciﬁc you would like your audience to go through these segments? if so, how are you planning on doing that? or will the people just walk in and ﬁrst see whichever segment they choose to 5. INT. / VIDEO ROOM / EXPOSITION #2 This room is a little smaller then the ﬁrst one, 3 walls are white and one is of a green color,which gives the feeling of freshness, new ideas and growth. The light is muted. There are 5 tablets on stands,which show the producer`s scripts and storyboards with his own handwritten notes, diagrams and other various scribblings to give a visitor an idea of his speciﬁc method of crafting every single shot in his works. No music is played, since there is a big screen on the green wall featuring episodes from his most popular movies as well as the most captivating trailers. In the rooms with expositions #1 and #2 there are 5 young men in suits with special badges, designated to answer visitors` questions and talk to them about Martin Scorsese`s life and works. In this room they also help to operate the stands if needed. 6. INT. / PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM The climax of the exhibit will be a press-conference involving Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio. This part of the exhibit will take place in a big conference room. It is located on the second ﬂoor,where people can get taking nice spiral stairs. The number of visitors,who can attend this part of the exhibit is limited.\n\n7. They are the ﬁrst 100 people to get the tickets online and 100 to get it on the day of the event. The press-conference will be held about 1 hour. catalin: what are the remaining 300 people supposed to do? you had 400 people in scene 4 There will be set up a stage with tables,chairs and microphones for the main guests. The closest area to Martin and Leo will be separated by special signs, where there will be journalists and correspondents from TV-channels, magazines and newspapers.

Let us introduce to you Martin Scorsese, an American ﬁlm director, screenwriter, producer, actor, ﬁlm historian and Leonardo DiCaprio,a famous actor, who Martin S. has worked with on 5 great movies and whose life he inﬂuenced enormously. 7. INT./ EXT./ HALL LEADING TO THE EXIT OF MOMA The visitors won`t leave the exhibit unnoticed. During the last hour of the exhibition, on exiting the building they will feel like they are celebrities.

It won`t be too loud and\n\n10. annoying, but it will be of a good quality and distinctive, so that even being not close to the museum itself, people can already anticipate something captivating coming closer. Lighting 3 small light projectors will be above the poster “Simple Is Hard”, so that when it gets darker, people could still be able to see it and it would draw their attention. Scene 2 Sound There will be a mixture of lots of sounds, since it is a “mingling area”. A pop music will be playing as a background. Lighting There will be a panel of purple lights above the bar to make it standout. Scene 3 Stereo Sound The 2 plasma screens showing the documentary is the zest of this hallway and whatever is on it should be perceived the right way, which is possible with the right high quality sound. Stereo sound in this room will create the illusion of space and dimension, which will give the documentary a decent weight and signiﬁcance. Acoustics This hallway has high ceilings, stone walls and no furniture, rugs or curtains, so the sound will hit its hard surfaces and little of it will be absorbed. The reﬂected sound will be loud, and bouncing off the surfaces it will sound brighter and sharper . Lighting The light will be muted since the attention of the audience will be on the screens. Scene 4 Sound The music will be played as a background, so that it does not distract the audience from the pictures and they could communicate with each other and stuff members. Lighting It is light in the room, so that the visitors could easily behold all the pictures. Apart from all the small lights along the perimeter of the room, there will be a big high chandelier (very close to the ceiling) to make the room look pure and give it the needed importance. Scene 5 Stereo Sound\n\n11. Stereo sound is important here as there is a big screen featuring certain episodes from the movies. It provides the visitors with a sense of depth, a spatial awareness of the visual image ( scenes from movies and trailers) and sound. However, this sound will be a background one for those focusing on the tablets. Sound Together with stereo sound coming from the screen there will be softer and more quiet sounds coming from people using the tablets and possibly talking with stuff members. This room is for both purposes, to use the stand and to watch everything that is on the screen. Reverberation Reverberation is important here since there will be a mixture of different sounds and they should be distinctive. Scene 6 Sound/Acoustics The sound in the conference room is extremely important, since there will be a lot of speaking. It is expected that the audience won`t have any problems understanding what the guests are saying. The conference room will require some more of upholstered furniture and acoustic panels to reduce acoustic reﬂections. Audio Mixer Since there will be a mixture of different sounds, an audio mixture will be used to control all of them coming from different sources. Lighting Lighting is important because it will affect the video and how the guests( their make up, clothing etc) will appear on the camera. The stage will be more lighted then the other part of the room. A couple light projectors will be set up. Microphones Different kinds of microphones will be used in this scene. Shotgun microphone will be used to pick up sound from the distance. Directional microphones will be set up right on the tables as they pick up the sound directly in front of it. Besides, there will be back up directional microphones in case the main ones fail. Scene 7 Microphones Handheld microphones will be used by journalists to interview both the VIP guests and the visitors.\n\n12. Camera microphones will be needed as well for the interviews. Lighting Lighting is important here, since focusing on the the red carpet, it will give it importance and fabulosity. The correct lighting will make people look good on the camera both for pictures and video. WEBSITE INFORMATION Goals The main goal of the website is to inform, then advertise and as a result of that- sell. The website will help to increase awareness about the director and give detailed information for those who are interested; it will advertise the exhibition, thus attracting more visitors. Demographics The demographic of this website will be focused on people who are interested in directing, shooting movies as well as people, who love Martin`s movies. Age 15-55 mostly. Timing Taking into consideration that the budget is not a problem, I would give the website 6 weeks. All the needed professionals will be hired and the timeframe for them will be 1 months; it will include building and testing. I’m leaving 2 extra weeks in case I don’t get what I expected and there is time to ﬁx it,since launching itself is a fast process. Design The User Experience Design will be used. I think it is very important to examine how the user feels; when it comes to feelings, it is so hard to resist, that is why exactly this model will be great for this kind of website. Plus, it will be easy and quick to navigate,pleasant to look at and reliable. The wireframe and site map The wireframe will be created and presented as sketches on a whiteboard by business analysts, user experience designers, developers and visual designers. Information: Once opening the website, the user will see Martin`s Scorsese`s picture, there will be music playing, one of those that he usually uses in his movies, so his fans will deﬁnitely recognize it and already feel closer and more involved in the exhibition."
