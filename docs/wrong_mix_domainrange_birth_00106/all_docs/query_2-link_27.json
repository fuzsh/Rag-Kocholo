        "text": "Roger Corman\n\nAmerican writer and director\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 16, 2024, 4:11 AM ET (Daily Star)\n\nOscar-winning screenwriter Robert Towne dead at 89\n\nRoger Corman (born April 5, 1926, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.—died May 9, 2024, Santa Monica, California) was an American motion picture director, producer, and distributor known for his highly successful low-budget exploitation films and for launching the careers of several prominent directors and actors, notably Francis Ford Coppola, Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich, and Jonathan Demme.\n\nEarly life and first film\n\nIn 1940 Corman’s family moved from Detroit to Beverly Hills, California, near Hollywood—a move that inspired young Roger’s love of motion pictures. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Corman earned an engineering degree from Stanford University. He broke into the film industry in 1948, where he began working as a messenger at Twentieth Century-Fox. He was soon promoted to script reader. After a one-year hiatus during which he studied English literature at the University of Oxford, he coproduced his first film, Highway Dragnet, in 1954.\n\nKing of the B-movies\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nCorman’s second film, Monster from the Ocean Floor (1954), was made in six days on a budget of $12,000; it was the first of his movies to follow what was to become his standard method of operation: inexpensive productions shot in the minimum amount of time, often in less than one week. That same year he also produced The Fast and the Furious for American Releasing Corporation, which later became American International Pictures (AIP), for which Corman produced and directed many of his most noted films. In 1955 he directed his first feature film, Five Guns West, a romantic western. The titles of many of Corman’s films of the 1950s—The Beast with a Million Eyes (1955), It Conquered the World (1956), Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957), Teenage Cave Man (1958), Night of the Blood Beast (1958), The Brain Eaters (1958), The Cry Baby Killer (1958; the film that marked Nicholson’s screen debut), and A Bucket of Blood (1959)—indicate why he earned the nickname “King of the Drive-in” or “King of the B-movies.”\n\nThe Little Shop of Horrors\n\nIn 1960 Corman produced and directed the cult classic The Little Shop of Horrors, which was shot in two days and one night on a leftover set, with a memorable cameo by Nicholson. At AIP, he sought out young (and thus inexpensive) filmmakers, many of whom went on to stellar careers. Coppola and Bogdanovich each had early credits reediting Soviet sci-fi films (Battle Beyond the Sun [1959] and Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women [1968], respectively) for Corman. The postapocalypse yarn Last Woman on Earth (1960) was written by Robert Towne, who would later become renowned as the writer of the neo-noir film Chinatown (1974); Corman also drafted Towne as an actor, but Towne disguised both contributions under the pseudonym Edward Wain.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe films\n\nDuring the 1960s Corman directed eight lavish gothic horror films based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, including House of Usher (1960), The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Raven (1963), The Haunted Palace (1963), and The Masque of the Red Death (1964). All but one of the Poe films starred Vincent Price, and these films featured such other established actors as Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff, Ray Milland, and Peter Lorre.\n\nOther cult classic films\n\nNot all of Corman’s work of the period was confined to the horror genre, however. The Intruder (1962) was a serious parable about race relations, with William Shatner as a rabble-rousing racist in the South. The Wild Angels (1966) was a sordid biker film that was based on the exploits of the Hells Angels and starred Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, and Nancy Sinatra. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre (1967) was a relatively faithful account of the notorious 1929 slaughter, starring Jason Robards as Al Capone. The Trip (1967), written by Nicholson, featured Fonda as a director of TV commercials who experiences surreal visions after a first experience with LSD, while Bloody Mama (1970) was a violent portrayal of the Ma Barker story, starring Shelley Winters, with Robert De Niro as one of her twisted sons.\n\nNew World Pictures\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn 1970 Corman left AIP and formed New World Pictures, an independent company that produced and distributed the work of such young artists as John Sayles, Martin Scorsese, Joe Dante, Jonathan Demme, and James Cameron. Its first film, The Student Nurses (1970), was shot in three weeks for $150,000 and grossed more than $1 million. Other New World releases included horror, blaxploitation, and women-in-prison films. The profits from these low-budget features allowed Corman to act as the American distributor for a number of prestigious foreign films, including Ingmar Bergman’s Cries and Whispers (1972), Federico Fellini’s Amarcord (1973), and Volker Schlöndorff’s The Tin Drum (1979). Corman sold New World Pictures in 1983 and founded Concorde-New Horizons, a company devoted strictly to movie production.\n\nOther projects and legacy\n\nIn a career reaching from the 1950s to the 2010s, Corman produced or directed hundreds of films. Despite their blatantly low production values, the majority of Corman’s films are surprisingly entertaining and literate, and they are often characterized by a campy, self-deprecating humor. His influence on contemporary American cinema was enormous, in large part because of his discovery and promotion of young actors and directors. Though Corman officially retired from directing in 1971, he made a comeback with the well-received Frankenstein Unbound (1990).\n\nAn occasional actor, Corman typically appeared in the films of those whose careers he had helped. He had minor roles in Coppola’s The Godfather: Part II (1974) and in such Demme films as Philadelphia (1993), The Manchurian Candidate (2004), and Rachel Getting Married (2008). Other notable films included Apollo 13 (1995).\n\nCorman cowrote (with Jim Jerome) an autobiography, the aptly titled How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime (1971). In 2009 he was given an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement. Two years later he was the subject of the documentary Corman’s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica This article was most recently revised and updated by René Ostberg."
