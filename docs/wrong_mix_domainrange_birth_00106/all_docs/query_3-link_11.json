        "text": "This article originally appeared in the April 1994 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\nEdith Wharton invented the semi­otics of real estate. She could parse a block of New York like a sentence and tell you what the location of each house signified. The moves of her characters—the brownstones or man­sions that they buy, sell, build, lose or inherit—help define them.\n\nMartin Scorsese's New York—the Little Italy of his childhood and his early films—was as much of a cir­cumscribed, defining province as Wharton's. As a boy he observed its boundaries: He never even ventured as far north as Greenwich Village. As a man and an artist, he has reckoned with its pull. \"I'm a die-hard New Yorker, but I've spent my life mak­ing movies and living on location. When I was ready to make a home for myself, I didn't know what style of living in Manhattan would make me feel most comfortable. It depends where you start from. I started from the Lower East Side tenements. I certainly wasn't going back to Elizabeth Street. But where did I belong?\"\n\nScorsese settled that question de­finitively two years ago, when he moved to an Upper East Side townhouse with a walled garden—not so grand as the mansions of The Age of Innocence, but built in the same period. The neighborhood, he says, \"has a small-town feel to it, even with a busy avenue on the corner.\" And in the small hours of the morning, when the traffic has subsided, he can sometimes hear the sound of a horse and carriage passing under his windows. It helps him imagine, he says, what Wharton's New York felt like.\n\nThe townhouse has also given the director \"a sense of permanence\" that until now was elusive. \"I've tried high-rise apartments and I still love the views, but they're not personal enough. I've tried lofts too, and there are beautiful spaces with beautiful light, but the industrial, downtown neighborhoods reminded me too much of the streets where I grew up. When I was living in a loft and editing my films in the same space, I didn't have enough distance from my work. It's not just that you can't close a door: When you're editing a film it seems to permeate your living arrangements. And in the bleaker moments—the moments of despair—it felt as if I'd never left where I came from.\"\n\n1 / 6\n\nMost modern artists are susceptible to such bleakness, but it's naive to expect that their decor will look like their imagery. Joseph Beuys probably didn't have a blood-stained hyena carcass under his coffee table, and the only artifacts in Martin Scorsese's house that recall mean streets are a bottle of grappa and a piece of turquoise pottery from Positano on the sideboard in his dining room. His rooms are warm, decorous, elegant in a manly fashion and unpretentious. How unpretentious? There's a plaid doggy bed in a corner of his kitchen and a box of tissues on the phone table next to the Eames chair. It looks as if he actually pays his bills at the Victorian desk in his library. He eats alone at a farmhouse table on a well-washed cotton placemat, watching the Discovery channel. His dishes are the kind a man buys for himself when his wives have kept the wedding presents.\n\n\"Marty has an austere, almost monastic sensibility,\" says his designer, Karen Houghton. \"All his possessions have a personal meaning for him or a reference to one of his movies. He's not a materialist, and since I'm not one either, I think that's one reason we get along.\" Houghton, who is based in Nyack, New York, met Scorsese through mutual friends in the film world. She designed his previous apartment—a seventy-fifth-floor space that had a spectacular view and a minimum of furniture. \"It was a sleek, cool place,\" she reflects. \"He was up with the hawks, and he could see up the Hudson River. I think Marty needed a warmer life, and here he has one. The house is grounded and complete—it's a welcoming home.\"\n\nScorsese says he worked with Houghton the way he would with a production designer. \"She came to the set and showed me photographs and swatches, and I made decisions.\" Houghton describes her client as \"very direct and accessible. He has high expectations but he gives you a lot of freedom. He also gave me an excellent definition of what he wanted.\"\n\nThe decor of each floor in the town house has a different mood, adapted to its function. The first-floor dining room opens to the garden, and Scor­sese wanted it to have \"a provincial country feeling.\" The fourth-floor study is the director's lair: He works and reads there, listens to music, screens films and watches a television that he often keeps tuned to the American Movie Channel. \"I don't really like television,\" he admits. The violence? He smiles. \"No, that doesn't bother me. It's the commercials, the situation comedies and the rock videos that are absolutely terrifying.\"\n\nHoughton's greatest challenge was the open living space on the second floor. The old dumbwaiter shaft, now an elevator, bisects it and couldn't be repositioned, so she created two separate reception areas—\"pockets of intimacy,\" as Scorsese puts it—making the most of the natural light with pale wood floors, ecru walls and recessed lighting. In the rear is a parlor of subdued Napoleonic elegance that can seat ten or twelve for a screening. In the front is a sophisticated library where the designer has mixed an up­ holstered sofa with an antique Lavar Kermin rug, a Victorian desk, a wall of bookshelves, and side chairs with an Empire line. \"I love the way Marty looks when he sits there,\" she says. But Houghton was also prepared to integrate the Eames chairs from his last apartment. \"He's the right type of person for an Eames chair, and that's not true of everyone. Some men should have their Eames chairs taken away from them.\"\n\nFilmmaking is a cross between military and court life: It all takes place in public. That's probably why Scorsese is so protective of his privacy. \"Between films,\" he says, \"there are days at a time when I don't do anything except hole up and read. My daughters visit, and occasionally there's a guest for dinner—but that's all. And when the work comes in, the time has to be cut out ruthlessly for it.\"\n\nBut what strikes a visitor to Scor­sese's town house is less his solitude than his attachments—the power of the presences around him. Director Akira Kurosawa gave him the Japa­nese prints over the desk and the two ceremonial dolls—an emperor and empress—in the library. A vitrine is filled with talismans and career me­ mentos. Ken Takakura bestowed the samurai stirrups on the mantel in the living room. The guitar hanging like a piece of sculpture on the wall is an original Stratocaster—\"a pure one\"— that Robbie Robertson played in The Last Waltz, Scorsese's 1978 film about The Band. As for the remarkable col­lection of movie posters hanging in every room and hall, it's only when you've seen The Age of Innocence (1993) that you recognize the tone of reverence, authority and tribal pride that Scorsese adopts when he talks about them. He's an old New Yorker showing you his family portraits.\n\nRelated: See More Celebrity Homes in AD"
