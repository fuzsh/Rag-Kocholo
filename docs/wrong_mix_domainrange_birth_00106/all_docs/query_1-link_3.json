        "text": "Martin Scorsese, who made the classic films Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, will be given the degree at a ceremony on June 20 in recognition of his ‘outstanding contribution’ to his field.\n\nHistorian Professor Mary Beard, of Cambridge University, will also add an honorary degree from Oxford to her long list of achievements.\n\nThe Roman scholar, known for her books and television work, also has an honorary degree from the University of Madrid.\n\nChoreographer Sir Matthew Bourne, former president of the supreme court Lord Neuberger and social scientist Professor Helga Nowotny are among the other recipients this year.\n\nAlso included are public policy expert Professor Robert Putnam and Lord Stern, who led the government’s review on the economics of climate change.\n\nThey will be presented at a special ceremony, known as Encaenia, which sees academics parade through Oxford.\n\nProfessor Roger Goodman, Chair of the committee on honorary degrees, said: “This year’s nominees are all being recognised for a distinguished body of work and cover a fascinating range of areas of achievement.\n\n“We look forward greatly to welcoming them to Oxford and honouring their work in June.”"
