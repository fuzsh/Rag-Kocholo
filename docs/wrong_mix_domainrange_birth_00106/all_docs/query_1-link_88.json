What draws audiences to theaters? François Truffaut, like Fellini, Bergman or Scorsese, worked with an autobiographical material and Totally Truffaut follows the coded inscription of major life events in his films from his illegitimate birth to his passionate but doomed relationship with Catherine Deneuve. I focus first on the process that embeds experience into fictions, and more specifically into visual forms and patterns. I also try to define the mode of perception film language triggers in the spectator. When entering a movie theater, we expect perceptual pleasure. Truffaut's creative work is devoted to distilling this drug to audiences, an ambition central to the evolution of his style. These two issues are closely connected and Totally Truffaut follows, film after film, their crisscrossing paths. It also highlights the essential role several great actresses-Jeanne Moreau, Françoise Dorléac, Jacqueline Bisset, Isabelle Adjani, Fanny Ardant or Catherine Deneuve- played in the creation of the films\"--\n\nUniform Title\n\nTout Truffaut.
