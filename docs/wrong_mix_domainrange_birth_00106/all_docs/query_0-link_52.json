She went on to produce a documentary on the subject of kindness, and another more recently on pickleball. She was a member of The UCLA Center of Storytellers and Scholars Advisory Board.\n\nIsabelle married Hollywood producer Bradley Thomas in 2018, with the couple sharing two children together, twins Poppy and Grace. She was also the stepmother to Lucy and Charlie, Thomas’ older kids from his previous marriage to actress Hillary Matthews.\n\nThomas is one of the producers behind Martin Scorsese‘s latest film Killers Of The Flower Moon, which earned 10 nominations for this year’s Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor.\n\nIsabelle and Thomas attended various premieres and red carpet Hollywood events together over the years, and they were most recently pictured together at the 2024 BAFTA Tea Party at the Maybourne Beverly Hills on January 13.\n\nIsabelle’s family has requested that their privacy be respected at this time.\n\nFor help and advice on mental health:"
