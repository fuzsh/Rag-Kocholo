Many of his films are also known for their depiction of violence and liberal use of profanity.\n\t\n\tPart of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential filmmakers in cinematic history. In 1990, he founded The Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation, and in 2007 he founded the World Cinema Foundation. He is a recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award for his contributions to the cinema, and has won an Academy Award, a Palme d'Or, Cannes Film Festival Best Director Award, Silver Lion, Grammy Award, Emmys, Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and DGA Awards.&quot;\n\t\n\t<a href=\"http://www.dgphotos.co.uk\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">My Website</a> : <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/dgphotos\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Twitter</a> : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dsgphotos\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Facebook</a> : <a href=\"https://instagram.com/dgphotos.co.uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Instagram</a>  : <a href=\"https://www.photocrowd.com/dgphotos/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Photocrowd</a>\n\t\n\t© D.Godliman",
