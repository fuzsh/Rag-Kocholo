        "text": "Introduction\n\nArtistic Solutions to Sociological Problems\n\nAaron Baker\n\nAmong critics and other filmmakers, Martin Scorsese is widely regarded as one of the most important contemporary directors. Marc Raymond (2002) has written that Scorsese is the greatest American filmmaker of his generation, and his stature was demonstrated by a British Film Institute international survey of filmmakers, in which Raging Bull (1980) finished second only to Citizen Kane (1941) in a poll of the Top Ten Films of all time. Yet Scorsese's often violent stories of sin and redemption within contexts of social conflict, his films' hybrid combination of Hollywood genre with European art cinema stylization and narrative ambiguity, have until recently limited their appeal with large audiences. Only in four of his last five features, The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010), and Wolf Street (2013) – genre films built around the star power of Leonardo DiCaprio, was Scorsese able to reach $100 million in earnings, and finally win his first Academy Award. Actor Harvey Keitel explained the Academy's long-standing disregard for Scorsese as an indication of the director's aesthetic standards when he commented: Maybe he got what he deserves…exclusion from the mediocre (Dougan, 2004: xxi).\n\nScorsese's stature is built partly on virtuoso filmmaking technique, exemplified by his collaboration in eight films with the physical transformation and painstaking preparation used by Robert De Niro to redefine film acting, with Michael Chapman's chiaroscuro black and white cinematography and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing in Raging Bull, or his execution with Chapman of the tracking shot showing Travis Bickle's carnage at the end of Taxi Driver (1976) or the four-minute long take done with cinematographer Michael Ballhaus through the Copacabana kitchen in GoodFellas (1990). Part of Scorsese's prominence among critics and other filmmakers has come also from his encyclopedic knowledge of movie history, a reputation created by the numerous allusions in his films, his work on behalf of film preservation, and by his documentaries, A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American Movies (1995) and Il Mio Viaggio in Italia (1999) about his debt to Italian cinema. His knowledge of popular music is the equal of such cinéphilia, and as Michael Baker comments in this volume, Scorsese uses the affective power of rock music…to deliver moments of narrative might, stylistic swagger, and staggering emotional import. Some of these combinations of music and image are therefore as notable as his other demonstrations of virtuoso form: the use of The Rolling Stones' Jumpin' Jack Flash with slow motion and stylized lighting as De Niro's character makes his entrance in Mean Streets, The Animals' House of the Rising Sun in Casino (1995), and the sequence in GoodFellas tracked by the piano coda of Derek & The Dominos' Layla are just three examples. Roger Ebert has written that of all directors of his generation and younger, he may make the best use of rock music in his films (Ebert, 2008: 4).\n\nScorsese's filmmaking is at its most inspired telling stories on the margins of urban life, especially in his native New York, which he often shows as a place created by the externalized subjectivity of characters destabilized by conflict and paranoia. Even after three films, The Departed, Shutter Island, and Hugo (2011), that left New York for Boston, Boston Harbor, and Paris, respectively, as part of his appeal to a larger audience, Scorsese has returned to New York for The Wolf of Wall Street. In his chapter in this volume about the director's contribution to the omnibus film New York Stories (1989), Murray Pomerance states that His films are New York films, no matter their putative location. Whether set in New York or not, the strong urban flavor of Scorsese's movies can be traced to how, coincident with his taste for stylized expressionism, he grounds his stories in a diverse social reality through a documentary style of location shooting done on city streets and colloquial language. Yet despite this tension of expressionism and realism, his movies ultimately make a stronger gesture toward self-conscious allusion and virtuoso form as a reminder of their own fictionality and the power to assert Scorsese's and the viewer's control over the narrative even as the characters conversely often find little success through their actions. Robert Kolker calls this self-reflexive tendency in Scorsese's films the director's statement about the existence of the camera, the eyes behind it, and their ability to create, own and express ideas…the triangulation the film creates with itself, film history, and the viewer (Kolker, 2011: 197).\n\nScorsese's four most highly acclaimed films demonstrate this synthesis of allusion, style, and authorship. In Mean Streets, he combined noir spaces with French New Wave discontinuity style to represent the conflict faced by Charlie (Harvey Keitel), as he tries to reconcile his sexual desire for his girlfriend Teresa (Amy Robinson), and to move up by impressing this loan shark uncle, with a Christian duty to follow the dictates of his faith against extramarital sex and to look out for his wayward friend, Johnny (Robert De Niro). In Taxi Driver, Scorsese contrasts neorealist images of New York with allusion to John Ford's captivity narrative in The Searchers (1956) and compositions and camera movements drawn from Psycho (1960) and Frenzy (1972) to underscore the paranoid delusion with which Travis Bickle (De Niro) sees his world. In Raging Bull, realist mise-en-scène and noir imagery invoke Hollywood boxing films such as The Set Up (1947) and Somebody Up There Likes Me (1950) to show how the anger created by economic exploitation not only fuels the intensity of De Niro's Jake LaMotta in the ring, but also metastasizes outside it into sexism, racism, and homophobia. LaMotta expresses his frustration about the manipulation of his boxing career in violent jealously about the relationships between his wife Vicky (Cathy Moriarty) and other men, in a dark point of view shot of African American rival Sugar Ray Robinson as a monstrous figure, and through aggressive threats to sodomize another opponent and one of the gangsters whom he sees as rivals for Vicky's affections. GoodFellas uses the crime film convention of gangsters living large to parallel wise guy greed and consumption with similar pathologies in 1980s American society as a whole. When David Chase pitched his gangster drama The Sopranos to HBO executives as about how America is a country so despoiled with materialism that…it even makes a gangster sick, he was making a Scorsese-like allusion modeled on the descent into addiction and paranoia that brings down Ray Liotta's character at the end of GoodFellas.\n\nFor a filmmaker of Scorsese's stature, surprisingly few books have been written on his work. One of the best is by Robert Casillo, who views Scorsese primarily in relation to his ethnicity and religious identity, describing the filmmaker as a chronicler of the epic of Italian America (Casillo, 2006: xi). Casillo regards Scorsese's Italian American films as his best, stories of outsider status and the struggle for assimilation based on the experience of his Sicilian family in New York. For Scorsese, organized crime is an important part of Italian American culture, and while Casillo acknowledges the criticism of negative stereotypes for Italian Americans, he rejects the assertion that the Mafia is an example of what Edward Banfield called the amoral familialism of Southern Italian culture, the greater allegiance to immediate family rather than community, government or laws. Casillo instead views the Mafia as a voluntary organization that requires the choice to separate from family in the interest of ambition, similar in that sense to how assimilation and acculturation for immigrants require the same separation and assertion of individual identity (Casillo, 2006: 23).\n\nAs Casillo points out, Scorsese's film career was made possible because of an instance of such separation, in his case from the common practice among Italian immigrants of making children quit school and go to work to help support the family. Instead, Scorsese's education at New York University (NYU) provided him with not only the skills to make film his profession but formed also the basis of his knowledge of the medium that allows him to critique the assumptions of commercial cinema. While Scorsese is often seen as making films primarily about men, Robert Kolker, another critic who along with Casillo has done some of the best writing on Scorsese's career, describes how this focus on male identity is part of a critique of commercial cinema's normative assumptions about masculinity. Kolker notes that in Taxi Driver Scorsese uses Travis Bickle vigilante violence to comment that\n\nwhile individuals may do brave deeds, the concept of the hero and heroism is a culturally constructed myth. It begins in epic poetry and lives on in movies that posit violent individual action as a social good, rendering the community passive and helpless in the face of the man of action. Taxi Driver allows the viewer to assume the position of the hero's admirers. (Kolker, 2011: 250–251)\n\nBut after invoking what Robert Ray calls the outlaw hero, whose violent unilateral justice is so common in Hollywood movies, Scorsese ends Taxi Driver with a reference to Bernard Herrmann's score to Psycho to imply that Travis is more sociopath than hero.\n\nWith his focus on Scorsese's ethnicity and religion, Casillo might interpret this critique as not just about Hollywood's idea of masculinity but also about what he calls a Southern Italian code of masculine honour and its obsession with pride and retaliatory violence (Casillo, 2006: xviii). Therefore, if the critique of antisocial violent masculinity in Taxi Driver comes through Scorsese's allusion to Hitchcock, it may also be motivated by the director's Catholic values; Casillo explains that it is such contradiction between Scorsese's religious morality and exposure to wise guy culture that prompted him to call his book about the director Gangster Priest (Casillo, 2006: xiv).\n\nLesley Stern also reads Scorsese's emphasis on violence as part of a critique of normative masculinity in the chapter entitled Meditation on Violence from her book The Scorsese Connection. She compares Raging Bull to Emeric Pressburger's and Michael Powell's 1948 film The Red Shoes, noting how both movies focus on performance, boxing and ballet, respectively, as rituals of obsession, which she describes as at the same time magical and cruelly violent (Stern, 1995: 19). Stern goes on to interpret the ritual of boxing in Raging Bull as about defining masculinity, and she asserts that\n\nalong with other Scorsese films, [Raging Bull] exhibits an obsessive fascination with as well as repulsion for, the problems and experiences of masculinity…masculine fantasies and masculinity as fantasy. (Stern, 1995: 24)\n\nIn Stern's view, the LaMotta character's limited dominance in the ring is offset by his pathology outside it, demonstrating that this fantasy is the association of masculinity with power as illusory (Stern, 1995: 27).\n\nBesides Casillo, Kolker, and Stern, another useful source on Scorsese is Vincent LoBrutto's much quoted biography that benefited from cooperation with the filmmaker himself. Marc Raymond, whose overview of Scorsese's career opens this volume, has also published a book about his films that places them within a social context and looks at his work within the documentary form and on film preservation. In his chapter in this volume, Raymond offers a revisionist examination of how Scorsese's biography has been written and its bearing on his critical reputation as a filmmaker. What Raymond (2013) concludes is that the\n\ncritical community shares the conviction that great filmmaking negotiates between the two extremes of Hollywood and the avant-garde. It is in this aesthetic, which will become increasingly popular throughout the years, that Scorsese's reputation will be built.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Raymond focuses at length on the controversy over The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and how most critics sided with Scorsese, turning him into a martyred genius. In Raymond's view, such portrayal of Scorsese as the maligned artist made possible his ascendancy to the post of greatest filmmaker of his generation.\n\nThis elevated position, Raymond argues, allowed Scorsese in recent years to move toward the Hollywood mainstream without suffering too much damage to his critical reputation. This is an appraisal with which Robert Kolker disagrees, stating that Scorsese's transition from eight movies with De Niro to projects with Leonardo DiCaprio has coincided with a capitulation to large-scale productions infused with the commercial values of Hollywood stardom. Kolker states: De Niro's characters seethe from within; DiCaprio seems always to be impersonating someone (Kolker, 2011: 256–257).\n\nThe chapters in this volume have been arranged in four parts. Part One, entitled The Pious Auteur, includes five chapters that build on Casillo's work by focusing on how not only Scorsese's Catholicism and ethnicity, but also an extensive knowledge of film history, have impacted his movies. Scorsese's background, particularly his upbringing in New York, his Italian American family and neighborhood, and his religious training, have played a prominent role in his films. He has explained the extreme violence in his movies as the influence of growing up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and seeing fights and bloodshed on a regular basis as a boy. In high school, Scorsese planned to enter the seminary, but wound up at NYU where he studied cinema, yet Catholicism continued to be a central theme in his films. As Scorsese has stated: My whole life has been movies and religion. That's it. Nothing else (Kelly, 2004: 6).\n\nDavid Sterritt offers an insightful overview of religion in Scorsese's films. He traces how not just Catholic belief but a range of religious ideas can be found in his work and regards this thematic emphasis as putting him at odds with…the American film industry at large, which has a powerful belief in genre, formula, and noncontroversial narrative as the surest routes to popularity and profit. By analyzing a range of his films, including Mean Streets, The Last Temptation of Christ, Kundun (1997), After Hours (1985), and Shutter Island, Sterritt shows how Scorsese has injected signs and signifiers of his distinctive religiosity into a broad array of movies in a variety of genres.\n\nBesides the role of religion in his films, Part One also includes two chapters that examine how Scorsese's ethnicity and extensive knowledge of film history intersect through the influence of neorealism and Italian cinema more generally. Giorgio Bertellini and Jacqueline Reich analyze Scorsese's representation of aggressive masculinity – what they term his penchant for unregimented, rebellious male characters through the lens of Italian cinema. According to Bertellini and Reich, Scorsese's invocation of Italian cinema, in particular the films of Fellini, Rossellini, Pasolini, Bertolucci, and Visconti, creates a filmic pastiche that fosters an intellectually rich probing of American screen masculinity.\n\nThe result is that Scorsese's filmmaking is best understood in their view as an aesthetic profile positioned between American and European cinema. His link to Hollywood comes from how he has repeatedly employed genre elements from the gangster film, boxing film, and melodrama, as a means of paying homage to the American films of his youth, yet while also challenging their conventions, and using them as vehicles for his complex portraits of male heroes and anti-heroes. Central to this critique are the ambiguous endings in many of Scorsese's films, in which masculine redemption and restoration is not by any means a given.\n\nBecause film scholars have often sought to establish a line of influence from Italian cinema in general, and neorealism in particular, to Scorsese's films, Laura Ruberto argues for the need to created an in-depth understanding of the latter movement to better understand that influence, and that in fact such an understanding will show in her view that it is Scorsese's efforts as an activist and advocate for film on an international scale, rather than his cinematic and televisual productions, that best link him to the tenets of neorealism.\n\nRuberto notes that critics have often seen the neorealist influence in Scorsese's formal style, what she describes as stylistic characteristics that lend Scorsese's films a documentary-like feel…his use of true-to-life characters, on-location shooting, and his favoring of a hand-held camera. Stories that the filmmaker has himself told of watching Italian films on television with his neighbors and family as a boy in New York have also contributed to the idea of their influence on his work.\n\nBut in fact Ruberto argues that it has been Scorsese's restoration work through the nonprofit organization he founded, the World Cinema Foundation (WCF), that has been most significant in demonstrating the influence of neorealism on him by helping to support a cinematic alternative to Hollywood cultural hegemony. She states:\n\nthe mission and goals of the WCF are in line with much of neorealism at its most theoretical: using cinema to give voice to peoples and stories that usually remain unheard and unseen within a dominant culture…alternative cinematic narratives, ones which promote subaltern cultural trends, not dominant consumerist ones.\n\nIn Part One Robert Kolker also interprets Scorsese's two film history documentaries, A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American Movies, and My Voyage to Italy as demonstrating how the films he makes are a product of those films that have nurtured his imagination. Kolker observes that My Voyage to Italy is organized in chronological order, looking at Italian cinema from the postwar neorealists to Fellini's 8½ (1963). The documentary offers a history of an evolving Italian cinema after World War II that quickly became international and enormously influential on American film and Scorsese's work in particular. By contrast, A Personal Journey offers more of a practitioner's rather than a critic's view of American film, and the categories that Scorsese sets up in that film reflect the director's dilemma's rather than the critic's assessments. For Kolker, A Personal Journey is therefore fundamentally about how to manage the constant tug of war between personal expression and commercial imperatives.\n\nBased on his chapter in this volume grounding the director's career in his historical knowledge of cinema, it's not surprising that Kolker has elsewhere described Scorsese as interested more in the medium than the politics that drive it (Kolker, 2011: 193). As true as this may be, nonetheless, the chapters in Part Two of this volume look at how the identities of social groups, their definition, and the conflicts between them are prominent themes in Scorsese's films. As Matt Lohr states in his chapter, Italian American culture, while prominent in Scorsese's films, is balanced by a range of other identities, in particular that of Irish Americans. Lohr writes that in Scorsese's movies we see\n\nupper-crust WASPs (The Age of Innocence), American southerners (Cape Fear), Jews both American (Casino) and ancient Middle Eastern (The Last Temptation of Christ), even Tibetan Buddhists (Kundun). But aside from his own ethnic group, Scorsese's cinema has examined no subculture more closely than that of the Irish-American, and what he has depicted both differs from and resembles the Italian-American experience in telling and surprising ways.\n\nGangs of New York and The Departed are the central focus of Lohr's analysis. He states that these two films show\n\nthe struggles of the earliest Irish to set foot on American shores; detailed their efforts to assimilate into the mainstream through methods legal, criminal and prejudicial; [and] compared and contrasted their pragmatic, ground-level Catholicism with the more spiritually inclined style practiced by Italian Americans.\n\nIn his analysis of two more Scorsese films, New York, New York (1977) and Casino, Lohr demonstrates that their portrayal of Irish American men and women both reinforce and subvert stereotypes of maternal nurturing and male irresponsibility and alcoholism. Lohr calls these representations of Irish identity in Scorsese's films a valuable contribution to American cinematic ethnography.\n\nWhile Lohr juxtaposes Scorsese's representation of the Irish to his Italian American films, Robert Casillo, in his chapter in Part Two, parallels those movies from the latter group about the Mafia with the period film set in nineteenth-century New York, The Age of Innocence. For Casillo, the high society New York families in The Age of Innocence and the Mafia families in such films as Mean Streets, Raging Bull, and GoodFellas are both patriarchal, and hierarchical in their organization,…adhere to multiple codes and taboos which ensure, first, the unity, coherence, and harmony of the group,…its difference from the outer world.\n\nFor Larissa Ennis, what she calls off-white gangster films such as GoodFellas respond to the threat that multiculturalism presented to white privilege in the 1990s by ascribing to contemporary white masculinity the social disadvantage that ethnic groups associated with organized crime in the first half of the twentieth century had experienced. Gangster films of the 1990s displace contemporary anxieties about diminishing cultural hegemony and decentered white masculinity into a past when wiseguys are recent immigrants, and they inhabit a world of social inequality. By imagining white men as victims of America's history, off-white gangster films expiate the guilt attached to race-based privilege and dramatize a fantasy of shared trauma that resonates with the contemporary psychic wounds that whites feel as a result of their identification as the agents of a historical record of oppression and injustice.\n\nWhile the dominance of male characters in Scorsese's films has been much commented on, and some critics like Robert Kolker (2011), Jon Cavallero (2011), and Fred Gardaphe (2006) have analyzed his critique of dominant masculinity, in my chapter about two movies released in 1974, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore and Italianamerican, I show how they center around female protagonists, in the first to shift away from Hollywood's masculinism and tell a story from a woman's perspective, and in the latter to demonstrate the strong matriarchal tendency in Italian immigrant culture.\n\nIn his chapter that concludes Part Two, Jon Cavallero (2011) points out that since 2000, Scorsese has directed more television programs than feature films, yet that work for television remains undervalued when critics assess the director's career. Cavallero argues that Scorsese has used his prestige as a filmmaker to shift the usual model of television authorship, which tends to favor the showrunner or writing staff, to one more akin to feature filmmaking, which tends to favor the director. Cavallero tests this view by analyzing two of Scorsese's television projects, a documentary made for PBS in 2003, The Blues, in which his interest in music and cultural identity are explored, and the pilot episode in 2010 for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire in which Scorsese revisits the issues of ethnicity in relation the history of organized crime that have been central to several of his films.\n\nScorsese's visual style is a combination of Hollywood intensified continuity, documentary realism, expressionist distortion, and French New Wave discontinuity. Kolker, in A Cinema of Loneliness, describes this mix of contrasting formal tendencies as characteristic of Scorsese's movement across filmic boundaries from documentary, experimental, and stylized art cinema to commercial genre filmmaking. As a result, Scorsese at times employs realist techniques such as handheld camera and what appears to be improvisational acting along with stylized lighting, slow motion, and allusion that reminds us that movies are about other films at least as much as they are about reality (Kolker, 2011: 188–191). But despite such diversity, Kolker regards Scorsese's films as fundamentally melodramatic, using narrative, music, and mise-en-scène to express strong emotions. The worlds he portrays are rarely comfortable or set in reassuring spaces, and Scorsese will often position the viewer with the point of view taken by an alienated protagonist (Kolker, 2011: 195). Slow motion in these situations then becomes what Kolker calls a signifier of distorted perception (Kolker, 2011: 237).\n\nThis complex mix of forms and genres in Scorsese's films is engaged by the analysis in many of the chapters in this volume, but in Part Three, Murray Pomerance and Brendan Kredell focus in particular on Scorsese's portrayal of urban space.\n\nKredell traces how his representation of the city relies heavily upon the territoriality of urban space…divided and bounded…negotiated, contested, and occasionally transgressed. Kredell shows how much of the dramatic tension in Scorsese's narratives derives from the challenges to the settled spatial order of cities that these acts of transgression represent, and that the constraints on movement such transgressions violate are predicated in large part in Scorsese's films on the notion that city space is raced, gendered, classed, and divided by culture.\n\nCharacterizing Scorsese as fundamentally a New York filmmaker, Pomerance links that spatial identity to the filmmaker's conception of the creative process. Nick Nolte's Lionel Dubie character in the Life Lessons segment of New York Stories is an abstract expressionist painter who is a product of the downtown art scene of the 1980s both in his style of painting and as a star of the SoHo galleries. As for Scorsese the filmmaker, creative integrity, self-expression, and form are essential to Lionel, but he also has to navigate the business of art if only to be able to continue working.\n\nScorsese's creative relationship with Robert De Niro has been a central component of his film career, and Colin Tait looks at their collaboration in a new light cast by information drawn from the personal papers that the actor donated to the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas. Tait finds that De Niro's role in the films he made with Scorsese has been undervalued and that his contributions on films such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver blur the lines between acting, screenwriting, and directing, prompting us to rethink ideas of authorship.\n\nThree chapters in Part Three examine music as a central component of Scorsese's aesthetic. In his chapter, Michael Baker points out how popular music is a major feature of Martin Scorsese's work. Besides his use of it to deliver moments of narrative might, stylistic swagger, and staggering emotional import, he has also contributed to the emergence and evolution of the rockumentary genre. The term rockumentary is a portmanteau word that Baker defines as documentary films about rock music and related idioms, and usually feature some combination of performance footage, interviews, and undi­rected material. Baker writes that the rockumentary genre developed in the 1960s as popular music became central to Western youth culture, but gained notoriety with the blockbuster Woodstock (1970), a film that made the top 10 in box office that year and on which Scorsese worked, designing the split screen compositions that showed the symbiotic relationship between the performers and their audience.\n\nGiuliana Muscio analyzes Scorsese's use of music in three of his Mafia movies, Mean Streets, GoodFellas, and Casino, with the assumption that it can become an autonomous stylistic component,…utilizing the director's musical taste as an audio signature, as identifiable as the filmmaker's visual expressivity. Muscio chooses these three movies because she interprets the inclusion of both American popular music, and also songs typical of the Italian immigrant culture, such as sceneggiata (drama with songs) and mac­chietta (comic songs), as communicating his cultural identity as an Italian American.\n\nLike Muscio, Anthony Cavaluzzi analyzes Scorsese's compilation of American and Italian music, here on the soundtracks of Who's That Knocking at My Door (1968) and Mean Streets. He shows that both films focus on a small, closely-knit group of young Italian/American men in New York City, and use high energy popular music, the music of the streets, heard on jukeboxes and car radios to define and comment on their violent male-centered universe.\" Cavaluzzi also describes how, in Mean Streets, Scorsese contrasts that popular music of the young men with the traditional Neapolitan songs of the immigrant Italian culture, that communicate a different value system that is based on family and tradition.\n\nScorsese has made more than 50 feature-length films. Therefore, choosing those to emphasize as his most important is difficult. Whether or not some that should have been included were not, certainly the six chosen for special attention in Part Four of this volume are worthy. Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and GoodFellas were easy choices; they are widely regarded as Scorsese's best – Roger Ebert calls them the masterpieces of his career. I have also included two more, The Last Temptation of Christ and Hugo. Marc Raymond argues for the importance of The Last Temptation of Christ because of how it cemented Scorsese's reputation as a serious artist, allowing him to move in the latter part of his career toward the commercial mainstream.\n\nAs Guerric DeBona persuasively argues in his chapter on Hugo, it not only demonstrates Scorsese's versatility and ability to work in new genres and with the latest 3-D technology, the film also celebrates the cinéphilia that has been such an important part of his career and allows him to present a critical commentary on the current state of the American film industry.\n\nThe chapters about the very canonical Scorsese films (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and GoodFellas) all attempt to offer new perspectives on their content and construction. Stefan Sereda analyzes Mean Streets as an example of independent film, which he calls an endeavour that groups films on the basis of their holding in common varying industrial and aesthetic diversions from more dominant filmmaking modes, especially Hollywood cinema. Using Chuck Kleinhans's idea that independent film is best understood on sliding scale, nearer or farther from Hollywood, Sereda notes how Mean Streets typifies the category as involving the contributions of an auteur director, and as what he calls a dependie that was made outside the corporate media system but got distribution from Warner Bros. Applying David Bordwell's definition of European art cinema, Sereda points out Scorsese's use of realism, authorial expressivity, self-reflexive or discontinuous aesthetic overtures, and ambiguity in Mean Streets to show how it departs from and challenges mainstream Hollywood production. But ironically, on the thematic level, the film is about the failure of independence, as the attempts by the two main male characters (Johnny Boy and Charlie) to resist conformity to the rules of neighborhood lead to violence against them. As Sereda puts it, Through Charlie's story, Scorsese offers a meditation on the impossibility of independence within the patriarchal capitalist system, despite its ostensible insistence on individualism.\n\nIn his chapter about Taxi Driver, Michael High offers a timely new approach to the alienation and violence that define the film's main character, Travis Bickle (De Niro). High points out that most readings of this much-analyzed film have seen Travis as suffering from a pathological mental condition. However, using trauma theory, High reads Bickle as an interplay of external stimuli and internal frailty. High sees Bickle, a Vietnam veteran, as demonstrating the effects of psychological trauma from his experience in the war, with the resulting dialectic of impotence and power, failure and success, that results from such an experience.\n\nLeger Grindon has written extensively on the Hollywood boxing film, but in his chapter about Raging Bull, he, like Colin Tait, draws on new information from the Robert De Niro Papers at the Harry Ransom Center to reinterpret the production history and form of the nine boxing sequences in the film. Grindon shows how they combine an art cinema emphasis on character subjectivity with the intense physical interaction, the exchange of blows typical of the Hollywood fight film. By moving the view of a spectator from the usual placement outside the ring into the center of the fight, Scorsese helps put the viewer inside the psyche of the title character, Jake LaMotta, but in such proximity to the blood and violence of prizefighting that the subjectivity typical of the art film is combined with the action of genre film to create what Grindon calls subjectivity characterized by sensation rather than reflection.\n\nBambi Haggins's chapter examines what she calls a spectatorial experience of seduction in watching GoodFellas. Despite the film's problematic representation of racism, sexism, violence, and the capitalist and consumerist American Dream, she admits, \"Nevertheless, I love GoodFellas, almost against my will. Haggins goes on to carefully analyze all the violent betrayal and exploitation of others that the wise guys engage in to pursue their self-interest, but nonetheless concludes that the spectator's sense of right and wrong occupy a significantly grayed moral space at the film's end.\"\n\nAs she summarizes,\n\nour sensibilities have changed: we have been acculturated and acclimated to the life…an interested tourist who daydreams about going native.…Who hasn't wanted to not shy away from confrontation but to court it – for your own purposes? Who hasn't wished to have someone ‘taken care of’ – in a non-lethal way, of course?\n\nIn attempting to describe the appeal of GoodFellas despite its sexism, racism, and violence, Haggins gets at a fundamental quality of Scorsese's films: their ability to create the sympathy we feel for alienated outsiders who struggle for success, even if with hatred and violence that leave them destined for failure.\n\nReferences\n\nCasillo, R.

Scorsese's biographical history is by now very familiar to the culture, as are many of his films, and there seems little debate that Scorsese is a supremely talented and historically important director. Thus, what I'd like to offer is a kind of revisionist look at his biography, or, perhaps, a historiography of Scorsese's biographical history. How has the Scorsese narrative been developed, and why has the story been told this way? Connected to this, what has been left out by this particular approach? This chapter aims to both give an overview of Scorsese's vast and impressive work as well as offer a review and critique of the critical literature on Scorsese to this point.\n\nScorsese was born in November 1942 in New York's Little Italy, and his Italian-Catholic identity has been emphasized in numerous studies. As a child, he suffered from asthma, which prevented him from physical activity and led to his love of cinema. This biographical detail does contextualize Scorsese, but from a very personal perspective. What is often overlooked is the importance of where and when Scorsese came of age. If the French Cinematheque and postwar social conditions gave birth to the French New Wave auteurs, New York of the 1950s certainly contributed to the filmmaker Scorsese would become. Within the history of cinema exhibition, it can be argued that there is no time and place quite as rich and varied, and almost certainly not in America. The apex of Classic Hollywood was reached by 1946, and it was already beginning its decline as Scorsese reached film-going maturity. But this led to Hollywood experimenting with different styles and formats (color, widescreen), so that the 1950s can be seen as a Golden Age aesthetically if not commercially. And as Hollywood was in decline and closing theaters, the art-house cinema circuit was just beginning, with New York as the epicenter (see Wilinsky, 2001). Even local television, often considered the enemy of film, added to Scorsese's education by replaying old Hollywood films and, more importantly, films from the Italian Neorealism movement. As Scorsese explains in his 1999 documentary, My Voyage to Italy, his large extended family would often watch these rather terrible prints of such classics as Paisan (Roberto Rosselini, 1946) and La Terra Trema (Luchino Visconti, 1947) on local Italian television, and despite the poor quality the impact was still felt. Without this particular convergence of forces, it is highly unlikely a cinematic outlier like Scorsese would have emerged.\n\nThis extends to Scorsese's formal education in cinema. Across the United States in the 1960s, more and more children were attending university, including many who came from working-class backgrounds. At the same time, film programs were opening and expanding rapidly, as the 1960s explosion of world cinema created widespread demand in what was now considered the most important art form of the twentieth century. Scorsese entered New York University (NYU) in 1962 and eventually moved into the Film department, completing his master's degree in 1966. He made two acclaimed short films, What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This? and It's Not Just You, Murray, both of which are hybrid works combining elements of popular entertainment such as Hollywood and vaudeville with a playful, New Wave sensibility. They are calling cards, not unlike the numerous independent films that flood film festivals today. The only truly experimental work Scorsese has made was 1967's The Big Shave, a short completed outside of NYU with financial support from Jacques Ledoux, curator of the Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique in Brussels. The resulting six-minute short was not only Scorsese's most experimental work but also his most overtly political. The differences between this film and Scorsese's earlier shorts can be related to their differing institutional contexts. Scorsese did not produce The Big Shave within the academic institution, and the film differs dramatically from those earlier shorts. Rather than being a New Wave exercise in Hollywood revision, The Big Shave exists as a narrative in only the barest sense: an unknown man shaves in front of a mirror in an all-white room until he cuts himself and is covered in blood, all to the tune of Bunny Berigan's version of I Can't Get Started. The film then ends with two title cards: Whiteness by Herman Melville and Viet '67. The film won the Prix L'Age d'Or at the Festival of Experimental Cinema in Belgium, and belongs to what Pierre Bourdieu refers to as a field of restricted production (see Bourdieu, 1993), a field Scorsese would abandon when he chose a career in Hollywood.\n\nAlso coming out of the NYU context is Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door, aka Bring on the Dancing Girls, I Call First, and J.R. Originating in 1965 as a master's thesis film, it would evolve with multiple titles over the next few years, reaching its final form in 1969 with the addition of a nude scene, dictated by a distributor but fitting very well thematically with the original film. It marked Scorsese's first attempt at, as Leighton Grist puts it, entering the marketplace, (and) developing a style (Grist, 2000: 24). Subsequent writing on the film, which is rather substantial compared with the writing on the short films, emphasizes the work as an apprenticeship for the masterpiece to come, Mean Streets (1973), and hence judges the film in relation to this more professional standard: \"Who's That Knocking at My Door presents a patchwork of jerky transitions, unintegrated stylistic contrasts and varying standards of cinematography and picture quality (Grist, 2000: 31). Grist's comments represent a wide consensus on the film as technically crude because Scorsese still had not learned to properly\" channel his talent. This critical community shares the conviction that great filmmaking negotiates between the two extremes of Hollywood and the avant-garde. It is in this aesthetic, which will become increasingly popular throughout the years, that Scorsese's reputation will be built.\n\nFor a different perspective, consider former NYU and Scorsese student Peter Rea's illuminating comments on both films:\n\nI think Who's That Knocking has some of the most creative things he's ever done. I think it blows away Mean Streets. The use of slow motion when it is going across the people laughing, and, I just think there are things in that movie that are so powerful. I mean he's jump-cutting, he's playing with the medium and having fun with it. Of course I think Mean Streets is great as well. I went to L.A. after NYU, I was there for a brief period of time, and he (Scorsese) was cutting Mean Streets. And one of his other students was there working on it as well. So I saw an early cut of it. I saw a lot of stuff that I thought was amazing but they cut out of the movie. Kind of outrageous stuff, dream sequences. (author's interview)\n\nRea, as primarily a filmmaker and a production teacher, appreciates very different aspects of Scorsese's work than those within the academic interpretative community because he belongs to this field of cultural production himself. The changes in style from Who's That Knocking at My Door to Mean Streets are best considered not as a maturation (which implies a clear hierarchy) but as a shift in the type of audience that appreciates each respective work. The vagaries of production and distribution that are used to denigrate Who's That Knocking at My Door apply equally to Mean Streets or any other work of art: Since most artists want the advantages of distribution, they work with an eye to what the system characteristic of their world can handle. What kinds of work will it distribute? What will it ignore? What return will it give for what kind of work? (Becker, 1982: 94). With this in mind, it is useful to compare the two films with the reception of John Cassavetes's Shadows, a film that went through two different versions and thus can be considered as two separate texts. The first cut of the film, which unfortunately is no longer available to be screened, was praised by Jonas Mekas as a great example of underground cinema and was used by Mekas to promote the idea of a New American Cinema. However, when Cassavetes re-edited the film in order to de-emphasize formal experimentation and focus more on characterization, Mekas rejected the film as overly conventional. For Cassavetes, the second version represented a maturation of his filmmaking, rejecting the overindulgence in cinematic style of the first version. A similar split in critical perspective is seen with Who's That Knocking at My Door and Mean Streets. The later film may be more mature, but it is also more widely acceptable and intelligible in terms of style. To place this opposition within a hierarchy, as most critics of the two films have, works well as an auteurist narrative of growth, but also justifies and defends a certain approach to cinema (namely Hollywood, however New) while rejecting another (experimental). Throughout his career, Scorsese's work will repeatedly be used to mediate different ideas and notions of what cinema should be. And although Scorsese is often seen as an outsider to Hollywood, this mediation usually takes the form of an implicit justification of its approach to cinema.\n\nA failed project from this period also has served to reinforce this narrative. Scorsese's first professional directing job actually took place two years before his move to Hollywood and four years before his directing job for Roger Corman, Boxcar Bertha (1972). In 1968, Scorsese was hired to direct The Honeymoon Killers, scripted by Leonard Castle. But after a week of shooting, Scorsese was fired from the job and replaced by Castle himself. The film was released in 1970 and has developed a significant cult following, eventually being released by the prestigious Criterion Collection DVD company. Scorsese's comments on this incident reveal a great deal about the cultural field of filmmaking:\n\nI had been fired from The Honeymoon Killers in 1968 after one week's shooting, and for a pretty good reason too. It was a 200-page script and I was shooting everything in master shots with no coverage because I was an artist! Since the guys with the money only had enough for a $150 000 black and white film, they said we just couldn't go on; there would have to be close-ups or something. Of course, not every scene was shot from one angle, but too many of them were, so that there was no way of avoiding a film four hours long. That was a great lesson. From 1968 to 1972 I was very much afraid I would get fired again. So when I started on Boxcar Bertha I drew every scene, about 500 pictures altogether. (Thompson and Christie, 1996: 34)\n\nScorsese's comment here that he was an artist is clearly meant to be self-mocking, but is also a conventional parody of the self-important experimental filmmaker who will not submit to the demands of working in the industry. Given that Scorsese was making these comments retrospectively in order to position his own subsequent career, they served as a self-justification more than a self-critique. Because of the auteur theory, the idea of producing art within the system was considered possible, and art was no longer contingent on being separate from commercial concerns. When Scorsese looked back on his younger filmmaking self as pretentious and unreasonable, he implicitly passed judgment on others who insist on this point of view. Moving from New York and independent filmmaking and into the world of Hollywood commercialism can be read as selling out to the system. Scorsese's comments argue against this by seeing financial interests as inevitable to the making of film. What was a very clear professional and ideological decision by Scorsese is turned into common sense.\n\nBefore leaving NYU for Hollywood in the fall of 1970, Scorsese worked as an instructor at the university, was a key part of the editing team on the landmark documentary Woodstock, and organized the collective documentary Street Scenes 1970. This film documented the protests that occurred in May 1970, first concerning the bombing of Cambodia and then the student shootings at Kent State. Street Scenes 1970 is one of the lost artifacts of Scorsese's career and, ironically, the cause of this missing piece of Scorsese's history is Scorsese himself. If Street Scenes is mentioned at all by Scorsese critics, it is usually seen as an anomaly or curiosity, especially given the less political nature of the rest of his career. What is not mentioned is how Scorsese has exercised tight control over his personal print of the film, which is the only one currently known to exist. He has thus effectively suppressed it, despite his reputation as a preserver of film history. And the reason for this suppression is not the political content; rather, it is an authorship controversy over the film that occurred after it played at the New York Film Festival in September 1970. Many of the collective felt Scorsese was receiving credit as the film's auteur, despite it being made as a group project with Scorsese as supervisor and editor, not director. Scorsese's sensitivity over this issue, still lingering decades later, has caused him to make the film unavailable even to researchers. This is unfortunate because the film is an important document in a key and still relevant American historical moment, and because it distorts the more political nature of Scorsese's pre-Hollywood career.\n\nFor example, without Street Scenes, Boxcar Bertha has been read not as a politically radical text (one of the more overtly radical of Scorsese's career, in fact), but as a stepping-stone on the road to further greatness (Figure 1.1). Boxcar Bertha stands as Scorsese's entrance into Hollywood as a director because of its unambiguously commercial nature, even if it was made on the margins of this industry. It is an example of a Roger Corman-produced exploitation film, one of the many in the lovers-on-the-run genre. These same qualities excluded the film from serious consideration as art, as the now often told Scorsese anecdote shows:\n\nI showed Boxcar Bertha in a rough-cut of about two hours to John Cassavetes. John took me back to his office, looked at me and said, ‘Marty, you've just spent a whole year of your life making a piece of shit. It's a good picture, but you're better than the people who make this kind of movie. Don't get hooked into the exploitation market, just try and do something different.’ Jay Cocks, who was then the Time film critic, had shown him Who's That Knocking at My Door and he had loved it. He said I must go back to making that kind of film and was there anything I had that I was really dying to make. I said, ‘Yes, although it needs a rewrite.’ ‘Well, rewrite it then!’ (Thompson and Christie, 1996: 38)\n\nweb_c1-fig-0001\n\nFigure 1.1 Working-class hero crucified. Boxcar Bertha (1972). Directed by Martin Scorsese. Produced by American International Pictures (AIP).\n\nThe frequency with which this story gets told and retold proves its symbolic value to the narrative that is Scorsese's career (see Keyser, 1992: 37 and Grist, 2000: 61–62). The story both praises and critiques Scorsese, stressing his immense talent as an artist as well as the failure of that talent to be properly realized within the exploitation market. It features Cassavetes in the role of supportive yet critical mentor/father, guiding the young disciple to his proper place as an artist, stressing the importance of personal work. Although the exploitation market was the contemporary equivalent of the Classical Hollywood B film that Scorsese so admired, it was not the place, according to Cassavetes, in which serious, personal work could be accomplished. Personal work for Cassavetes meant stories about people, not about film technique, as in auteurism. As previously discussed, Cassavetes's first film, Shadows, had an early version that was more experimental in technique that he eventually abandoned for a second version that was more focused on the characters and their relationships. He argued that, the first version was an interesting film from a technical point of view, but it had nothing to do with people (Carney, 2001: 80). Throughout the rest of his career, Cassavetes would continue to follow this principle, and although he would become an almost mythical figure within the context of independent cinema, he would be relatively ignored by Film Studies as a discipline and marginalized within the canon (see Kouvaros, 2004). Scorsese avoids this marginalization by virtue of his closer ties to Hollywood, a closeness foreshadowed by his involvement with Corman and Corman's own relationship vis-à-vis the major studios.\n\nWhat was left behind was the more overtly political material dealing with the oppression of the working class, racial minorities, and women, to which Scorsese would never really return. It would take ideological critics to draw out implicitly in Scorsese's Hollywood films what was explicit in Boxcar Bertha and some of the earlier student work. With the essential disappearance of Street Scenes 1970 from Scorsese's oeuvre, the politics of Boxcar Bertha can seem very antithetical to his career arc. But read as the first film after Street Scenes, the early credit sequence of Boxcar Bertha, detailing the clashes between the police and the workers, can be seen as a direct continuation of the police–student battles featured in the earlier documentary. And while it was a commercial picture, its political agenda was politically to the left of anything coming out of Hollywood. It features a group of heroes that includes a communist union leader, an African-American justifiably fighting racism with violence, and a woman who lives freely with different lovers and even as a prostitute without being punished for her lifestyle. Its villains are rich, powerful white men and their underlings. And while the character of Bertha and the actress Barbara Hershey are still treated as sexual objects for the voyeuristic gaze of the camera (after all, this is exploitation filmmaking), there is an argument to be made that Bertha is a more progressive female character than any of the women in Scorsese's future pictures. Although labeled a whore by those in power, Bertha is constantly seen as sympathetic despite her breaking of the social conventions of womanhood. The constantly lauded movement of Scorsese away from this exploitation material and back into more personal work constantly overlooks the fact that a more progressive social vision was abandoned as well.\n\nIt is with Mean Streets that Scorsese begins to establish himself as an auteur with a personal vision. But what is often ignored is how much of a Hollywood film Mean Streets is, and the fact that given the American context, Scorsese's movement into making films for Hollywood was a necessary contingency for his eventual canonization. Although Mean Streets is produced independently, it was made for studio distribution and has a technical polish and generic grounding that Who's That Knocking at My Door lacked. Scorsese rewrote an earlier draft of the script, at that point titled Season of the Witch, following Cassavetes's advice in 1972. In the process, Scorsese attempted to remove some of the more explicit cultural signifiers that would confuse a mainstream audience. Following the advice of his then partner Sandy Weintraub, the daughter of the studio executive Fred Weintraub who first brought Scorsese to Hollywood in 1970 to edit Medicine Ball Caravan, Scorsese worked to streamline his sensibility to fit the marketplace: \"I took out a lot of religious stuff – it was still called Season of the Witch at this stage – and put in things like the pool-hall scene\" (Thompson and Christie, 1996: 38). What results is a curious mixture of elements that allows Mean Streets to be discussed as an authentic, personal vision of New York's Little Italy as seen through one of its own members while eliminating some of the more obscure religious and ethnic specificity. The two titles of the film, the original Season of the Witch and the subsequent Mean Streets, encapsulate this duality. Understanding the title Season of the Witch requires a deep knowledge of Italian culture, as Robert Casillo argues:\n\nThe title Season of the Witch has its merits and is arguably preferable to the present one, being more closely related to the film's themes, narrative and characters. Such an argument, however, depends partly on the likely possibility that Scorsese grasped the significance of witches, witchcraft, and the related belief in the evil eye or mal occhio in both southern Italian and Italian American society. …Its unsuitability lies in the fact that, while witches have a specific significance in southern Italian society and its earlier Italian American off-shoots, these meanings would have been lost on most American viewers. (Casillo, 2006: 486, 491)\n\nHowever, Casillo ignores the fact that more than just the title of the film had changed. Although the specific references to Italian Catholic culture are still present in the film, they are no longer of central importance to the film's meaning. The change to the title Mean Streets was not isolated; it was part of a larger movement within the script and film as a whole to make the film more socially intelligible to a wider constituency.\n\nThe reference to Raymond Chandler in the title is merely one of many allusions the film makes to American popular culture, especially Hollywood cinema, as an attempt by Scorsese to locate Mean Streets within a filmmaking tradition. The characters in the film may be from a culturally specific group, but this culture has now been transformed by its connection with the world of mass entertainment represented by Hollywood cinema. Scorsese's own comments on the film stress these twin influences: [A]t the same time as giving this accurate picture of Italian-Americans, I was trying to make a kind of homage to the Warner Brothers [sic] gangster films (Thompson and Christie, 1996: 43–45). In fact, the film is full of references to Hollywood that situate Mean Streets as the New Hollywood film it was trying to be. There are three clips shown from other films, The Searchers, The Big Heat (Fritz Lang, 1953), and The Tomb of Ligeia (Roger Corman, 1964). Two Hollywood World War II films, The Pride of the Marines (Delmer Daves, 1945) and Back to Bataan (Edward Dmytryk, 1945), are referenced in the dialogue, and one scene features a poster for Point Blank (John Boorman, 1967). The variety of films here and how they are deployed speaks to Mean Streets as a film consciously trying to position itself within a group of ambitious Hollywood films reworking the conventions of its past.\n\nMean Streets received almost unanimous support from the mainstream press and was the first Scorsese film to receive widespread critical attention. But the few negative notices of the film strongly convey the critical environment and how Mean Streets was positioned within it. These reviews also indicate the direction Scorsese would turn in his subsequent work. Richard Schickel's review for Time is ambivalent, noting both admiration for the film's realism and dissatisfaction with the lack of connection to the characters: It is impossible to care as deeply as he does about people whose minds and spirits are stunted (Schickel, 1973: 102). Because of this inability to relate to the characters, Schickel concludes that, one leaves the film with the sense of having endured a class in social anthropology rather than an aesthetic experience. One recalls here Andrew Sarris's argument that truly great cinema needed to be de-contextualized from its social and historical milieu. The connection is not accidental. In 1973, Schickel produced the television series The Men Who Made the Movies, featuring seven Classical Hollywood filmmakers: Alfred Hitchcock, George Cukor, Howard Hawks, Vincente Minnelli, King Vidor, Raoul Walsh, and William Wellman. This series would have been inconceivable without the influence of auteurists like Sarris, and the selections greatly reflected the overturn in critical taste Sarris promoted (all but Wellman were highly regarded by Sarris in his rankings). For Schickel, these classical filmmakers offered aesthetic experiences not on display in Mean Streets, and they grounded their personality in their formal style rather than their social milieu. Despite the mainstreaming of the text, Mean Streets remained too grounded in sociology for many auteurists.\n\nIn 1974, following the critical success of Mean Streets, Scorsese would make his first film financed by a Hollywood studio. This was very much a film of the period: how the personnel were assembled, how the film was shot, and how the genre of the woman's melodrama was dealt with were indicative of how New Hollywood worked (see Grist, 2000: 98–122). The driving force behind the film was Ellen Burstyn, who was coming off a major hit, The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973). Burstyn had a script written by Robert Getchell and she and Warner Bros. were looking for a director. As Scorsese describes the situation, because I was receiving a lot of scripts now, Sandy Weintraub read it first and said it was really interesting. I thought it was a good idea too, dealing with women for a change (Thompson and Christie, 1996: 49). At one level, the film was a calculated move on Scorsese's part, as he has admitted. However, I would argue that it was not quite that simple. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore cannot be explained as a Hollywood mass cultural product to be defined in opposition to the modernist rigor of Scorsese's masterpieces. Rather, it needs to be seen, as do all Scorsese's films, as playing an important role in establishing Scorsese's reputation, and its mass culture status was paradoxically both a detriment to its critical reputation while playing an important role in establishing Scorsese's eventual high art status."
