        "text": "In Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, the drunken, self-disparaging Englishman Mike Campbell is asked how he went bankrupt: 'Two ways,' Mike says. 'Gradually and then suddenly.' That's the story of how I became a film critic. 'Gradually' was the process that began when I was four and saw my first film. 'Suddenly' was the point at which I was invited 25 years later, in 1962, to be the deputy film critic of The Observer. As Samuel Goldwyn once said, looking back over his career: 'We've all passed a lot of water since then.'\n\nMy first movie memory derives from 1937. I'd just started school in Leicester, where my father, who kept being shifted around by the company he worked for, was based. Due to his constant moves, I became acquainted with the cinemas of half-a-dozen towns. Because he was an insurance man, we could never agree about Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, which became one of my favourite pictures when I was 10. He saw it as a slur on his profession, less through the homicidal activities of life-insurance salesman Fred MacMurray than because claims investigator Edward G Robinson kept trying to avoid paying out on policies.\n\nAnyway, it was a Saturday morning in 1937 and my parents were chatting over breakfast about how they'd spent the previous evening. They were talking about 'the pictures' and I was intrigued. I had never seen a film or heard of television, we didn't have a telephone, and our only direct contact with the outside world came from the radio in the sitting room. I bombarded my father with questions about 'the pictures'. He was worn down by my persistence, and perhaps there was a certain guilt, as for all I know they'd left me alone when they went to the cinema down the hill or asked a neighbour to look in.\n\nDad gave in and took me to the cinema that very afternoon. I was entranced by the vast auditorium and by the imposing commissionaire, his waxed moustache bristling, the ribbons of his Great War medals on the chest of his uniform, and by the usherette who showed you to your seats in the dark if you arrived late and was there with her tray of chocolates, ice-cream and cigarettes in the breaks.\n\nMost important, when the curtains parted and the lights went down there were the immense close-ups of the characters, at once gigantic and intimate, the abrupt switches of location, the swirling action seen from so many different angles.\n\nIt was overwhelming and all experienced in semi-darkness. Addiction soon set in and my father would take me into the cinema, leaving me there during the performances that ran from early afternoon to around 10 o'clock. Thus I became acquainted with a resonant phrase - real and metaphoric - of the great days of cinema: 'This is where we came in!' For members of my generation, seeing a Pinter play was like entering a cinema after the film has started and I think he might have had this in mind. We're the same age and I know the cinema influenced him because I once wrote that the cricket-loving Charters and Caldicott duo played by Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne in The Lady Vanishes and other movies were like Pinter characters and he happily confessed his admiration.\n\nI can't remember what those first films were. But I have vivid memories of all the films I saw in 1939, one of the greatest years in movie history: Gone With the Wind, Stagecoach, Jesse James, The Wizard of Oz, Le jour se lève, La règle du jeu, Ninotchka, Gunga Din and so many others. If I were on a desert island with the films of a single year, it would be that one. Most significant perhaps was The Four Feathers. I saw it just after the outbreak of the Second World War and identified with the young hero who doubted if he had the courage to go into battle and resigned his commission on the eve of his regiment's departure for service against the Mahdi in the Sudan. Little did I know that 13 years later I would be an infantry officer involved in a similarly futile imperial mission in Egypt, or that 25 years after that I would be drinking with the film's star, Ralph Richardson, after recording his contribution to a 75th birthday radio tribute to Graham Greene, who said of it in his Spectator film column that 'it cannot fail to be the one of the best films of the year'.\n\nGreene is the greatest weekly film critic this country has ever had and I have never been more privileged than I was in 1979 coming from Cannes to Antibes bearing news of the world premiere of Apocalypse Now, Coppola's transposition of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness from the Congo to Vietnam. Greene was Conrad's greatest living disciple, the author of The Quiet American, the most highly regarded work to have come out of the Indo-China wars. I was dining with him that night after recording an interview for my radio programme to mark his 75th birthday and he questioned me closely about the film, being particularly tickled by the idea of both narrators working for 'the Company', in one case the Belgian exploiters of the Congo, in the other the CIA.\n\nI came to love the news, comedy shows, documentaries, poetic features and big band music on the radio. But during the Second World War and its immediate aftermath, movies were my deepest source of solace, entertainment and instruction. We didn't have a gramophone until I was 16 and I'd never seen a subtitled film until my father's company transferred him and us to Bristol where an enticingly scruffy cinema, the Tatler, showed foreign films. In the school library, I discovered Paul Rotha's deeply serious The Film Till Now, published just after the coming of sound. Just as Monsieur Jourdain, Molière's bourgeois gentilhomme, was astonished to hear that what he spoke was prose, so I was amazed to discover that what had preoccupied me for the past decade was art.\n\nFor a shilling I bought and still cherish Roger Manvell's Pelican paperback Film, which was at the time the UK's most influential book on the cinema. I read the weekly Picturegoer (printed in sepia tone), which combined gossip with sensible reviews. It was there I made my modest first entry on to the national scene - a letter attacking the political bias (right-wing of course) of cinema newsreels, which were part of most cinema programmes until the last one expired in 1967, long after they were made redundant by TV.\n\nCinemas came to be for me what pubs were for boozers, places to celebrate for their character as much as for the quality of the intoxicating fare they provided. The smarter picture houses belonged to the national chains - the Odeons, the Gaumonts and the ABCs. But I came to prefer the small, sometimes insalubrious independent cinemas, often described as 'fleapits', that dotted every town in the country. They offered better value for money and you could always find old flicks, still in distribution in ragged prints after several decades, at these places.\n\nUnless you could persuade your parents to take you to an A-certificate film (under-16s had to be accompanied by a parent or guardian), youthful moviegoing involved attaching yourself to lone patrons as they approached a cinema, offering them your ninepence and asking: 'Can you take me in, mister?' Often they'd take us in without accepting our money, and in my experience they didn't take sexual advantage. The 'U' certificate we thought too tame for the racy product we sought and there was a third certificate, 'H' for Horror, given mostly to inoffensive flicks like Frankenstein and Dracula that nowadays invite a PG for the DVD version. Only those over 16 could see them and I recall venturing into central Liverpool aged 13, wearing a pair of my father's trousers tucked into my armpits, a battered trilby on my head. Handing over my shilling at the box-office was far more terrifying than anything in the double bill of House of Frankenstein and Dracula's Daughter that lay ahead.\n\nCinema introduced me to literature, music and, more dangerously, to history. After seeing a postwar rerelease of the 1938 film Suez starring Tyrone Power as Ferdinand de Lesseps, I got into a painful losing debate on the Suez Canal with my history teacher at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby ('But sir, I think you'll find that Disraeli did give the money to de Lesseps'). I went from favourite pupil to pariah in five minutes in what proved to be one of the most instructive experiences of my life. Taking the producers of Khartoum to task for historical solecisms in a 1966 Observer review was probably my revenge for that humiliation.\n\nFrom Picturegoer, I graduated in 1951 to Sight & Sound, which I first read about in the weekly film column that Richard Winnington contributed to the liberal News Chronicle, our family's daily paper. The knowledgeable Winnington saw movies in a social context and, in this respect, resembled the way my newly discovered critical mentor, the 20th century's greatest man of letters, Edmund Wilson, viewed literature. From Sight & Sound, I learnt a new and more discerning vocabulary of contempt and appreciation from Gavin Lambert, Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and Penelope Houston.\n\nMy ambitious headmaster at Bristol Grammar School, John Garrett, a friend of Auden, Isherwood and Britten, was obsessed with beating Manchester Grammar School in the unofficial league table of scholarships and places at Oxbridge. Keen to turn the sows' ears in his sixth form into decent pigskin wallets, he told their largely lower-middle-class parents that they should have the Guardian, the Times, The Observer and the Sunday Times in their homes, not the Express, Mirror or Mail. So I became a reader of what John Osborne's Jimmy Porter was to describe as 'the posh Sundays'. Six years later, in July 1956 in the foyer of the Royal Court Theatre during the interval of Look Back in Anger, I approached Osborne and congratulated him on being (did I really say this?) 'a spokesman for our generation'. I came to read CA Lejeune in The Observer and her rival Dilys Powell in the Sunday Times. Garrett circulated The Spectator around the sixth-form common room, thus introducing me to my idol Kenneth Tynan, and in reaction I went out and bought its political antagonist, the New Statesman. Time magazine became my guide to America before I discovered the New Yorker. I was puzzled by the fact that the film section of the New Statesman was headed 'The Movies' while that of Time was labelled 'Cinema'. It took me a while to appreciate the difference of attitude this implied.\n\nAs a sixth-former, I read Eisenstein, Béla Balázs and any other book on cinema I could find. There weren't that many. Now I have three book-lined rooms dedicated just to the cinema, including 50 books on Hitchcock (including a pop-up one) and 30 on film noir. I joined the Bristol Film Guild, helped launch a school film society and became a member of the Bristol University Film Club, sitting twice a week on the hard, steeply raked benches of lecture theatres. There I saw the silent classics like Battleship Potemkin and Fritz Lang's Metropolis. It was a magical experience, when I was teaching at the University of Texas in 1972, to have an expansive lunch with Lang, then retired and cruising the university circuit, and he was as imperious as I expected. He'd seen Hitchcock's The 39 Steps on TV the night before. 'So they call this a classic?' he rasped. When I flinched, he added: 'Don't repeat that.'\n\nThat frozen-bum experience of film clubs, of which we would now say 'no pain, no gain', made us initiates of a sort of Masonic-like fraternity, sharing, to use EM Forster's comforting phrase, 'a secret understanding'. I was thus puzzled, physically and aesthetically, when I came up to London, a city I hardly knew, to visit the chief sites of the 1951 Festival of Britain, one of which later became the National Film Theatre.\n\nI was also there to visit the theatre, my predominant passion at that time. Eight plays in a week, for a total investment of a pound, then my pocket money for two months. More expensive was a visit to the plush Curzon Mayfair to see Max Ophüls's La Ronde. I loved the film's décor and mise-en-scène (terms I'd learnt from Sight & Sound), but most memorably found myself in a more comfortable, more opulent ambience than any cinema I'd visited.\n\nThere was not much Curzonian comfort for me over the next couple of years, which I spent in the army, first at various barracks in Britain, and then for more than a year with an infantry battalion in the Suez Canal Zone. During that period, I saw just three subtitled movies. Most pictures provided by the Army Kinema Corps were American and shown in open-air cinemas (you needed to take a blanket on winter evenings). There was no TV and no one thought of providing us with wireless sets. Few soldiers owned one. I didn't possess a radio until I was 26, a TV set until I was 28 and was 43 before I could afford colour TV.\n\nReading in military Egypt was a daylight activity. As a result of the War Department's parsimony (similar to what's now going on in Iraq and Afghanistan), there was a shortage of water and electricity. At 3am, water would appear in the showers and we'd rush out to bathe. A few minutes after nightfall, power would fail all over the desert camps, leaving us with feeble oil lamps to light our tents.\n\nBut after the electricity packed in three nights running at the nearby open-air cinema just as Marilyn Monroe was getting into her shower in Niagara, there was a mood of near mutiny in the surrounding camps. In consequence, a generator was installed in the cinema and it became a nocturnal oasis of light and comfort. I got the chance to see Ford's The Quiet Man, Anthony Mann's The Naked Spur and other films several times and was becoming aware of studio styles. Over the years I came to recognise that there were major characteristics - visually, thematically, generically, socially - that gave a distinctive aura to the movies that unrolled before us.\n\nEach studio raised different expectations: their lighting was different, their regular actors had a different shared persona. Thirty years of moviegoing was crystallised in 1969 when I published my first book on the cinema, The Movie Moguls, a portrait of the men who created the great Hollywood studios.\n\nDuring my absence overseas CinemaScope arrived in Britain and there had been a brief vogue for 3-D movies. Because the Rank organisation believed Scope films wouldn't catch on, they didn't invest in widescreens. They thus found themselves short of product when 20th Century-Fox made most of the major films in the new format. So some bright buyer acquired the rights to Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear, and it proved a big success. This, we thought, was the start of a revolution. Sadly it was the only foreign subtitled movie to get a full release on the Odeon circuit.\n\nThere followed three blissful years at Oxford where I wrote my first serious film criticism, was vice-chairman of the film society and co-scripted a movie that brought scholarships to its producer and director. I went to the States on a journalism scholarship, made my first visit to the Radio City Music Hall (my future wife, it transpired, was in the same audience to see Doris Day in The Pajama Game) and my first visit to Hollywood.\n\nAfter returning married to England, I worked briefly at the Bristol Evening Post (occasionally going on dim reporting assignments with Tom Stoppard, who worked on the rival paper), then got a job as a producer with the BBC North American Service.\n\nExcept for a year off to work on the New Statesman, I stayed with the BBC for the next 31 years. While employed mostly on political programmes, I started to do short film and book reviews that were syndicated by the BBC in the States, and also to write on films, unpaid, for the weekly newspaper of the National Union of Students. After two years, I moved over to Broadcasting House to work for domestic radio. The head of talks intended that I should work on Today or on the Ten O'Clock programme.\n\nThen came the greatest piece of luck I ever had. The producer of the Sunday lunchtime programme The Critics dropped out and, at short notice, I was asked to stand in. This was a weekly show in which six critics would discuss a book, film, play, broadcast and exhibition. It attracted several million listeners. I produced The Critics for the next three years and the arts became my speciality. Until 1990, I produced a variety of weekly arts programmes on Radio 3 or Radio 4. The Critics was an education. Suddenly, I had power in the cultural world. Only the TLS employed more critics and they were anonymous in those days.\n\nThe newly appointed arts editor of The Observer, Richard Findlater, an authority on drama and closely involved with Ken Tynan in fighting for the creation of a National Theatre, asked me out for lunch. He wanted my advice on new younger contributors for his pages. He asked me if I'd be interested in writing on film, knowing this to be a passion of mine. We parted with his suggestion that I write a trial column for him to consider. Returning home, I told my wife about the meeting. She said: 'Well, you've seen this week's films, why don't you write it tonight?' So I did - on Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, Bryan Forbes' The L-Shaped Room and How the West Was Won. That trio said something about the excitement of movies at the time: great films coming from Europe (Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, the French New Wave) as well as from Asia, a new realism in the British cinema and the western entering its last great decade.\n\nThree days later, I was invited to be Penelope Gilliatt's deputy and after waiting for a week I received permission from the BBC to take on occasional reviews, provided, as the Corporation's stern memorandums always went, that it was done at home, in my own time, and that no reference was made to my connection to the BBC. A couple of years further on, my request to accept an invitation to stand in as the Financial Times TV critic was refused. In handing down this rejection, one of my literate BBC superiors added a few lines in verse to the formal memorandum that concluded: 'Alas and alack/ You'll get the sack/ You can do Roger Vadim/ But not Kenneth Adam.' Adam was director of BBC Television.\n\nOn a journalism course I took at Indiana University, the professor asked the class to make a list of the publications they'd like to write for and those they thought they might actually write for. Within a decade, I had written for most of my choices. The Observer was top of that list. But what was, as we now say, my project? First, it was to bridge the gap between arthouse and so-called popular cinema, to be equally rigorous about both, but neither to revere film as art nor despise it as commerce. Second, I wanted to find a style and language that would encourage readers to look at film as a distinctive medium that combined all the other arts while realising itself as the great new art of the 20th century.\n\nIn my second term at Oxford, I wrote an enthusiastic review in Isis of Hugo Fregonese's Civil War western, a little gem called The Raid, which had been released without a press show in the second half of a double bill. All the university's cineastes went to see it, admired it and my local reputation was made. Something similar happened on the third or fourth occasion I stood in at The Observer. Joseph Losey's anti-nuke political thriller The Damned opened without a press screening as the bottom half of a Hammer double-bill at the now long defunct ABC Edgware Road. I revered Losey, thought this a stunning film made under considerable difficulty and led with it. As a result, United Artists brought it into their Piccadilly Circus showcase cinema, the Pavilion. The leading critics, who'd been away in Cannes, went to see it and waxed lyrical. I received a letter on Losey's notepaper, which I first thought to be a hoax, but which was genuine. He thanked me for praising the film and for not overpraising it. He told me later I'd prepared the way for The Servant, the first film he'd had a free hand in since he was forced to leave Hollywood.\n\nI didn't become the paper's full-time movie critic in 1967 as I hoped. I was told that in the discussions about appointing a successor to Penelope Gilliatt, someone had said that I was 'too obsessed' with film and another had described me as 'neurotic'. Hardly disqualifications for a job at The Observer, I thought, but there you are. Novelist Penelope Mortimer was appointed and I became film critic of the London Magazine, then deputy critic of the Times and a reviewer of books, movies and plays for numerous papers and magazines, while continuing to write about films on TV for The Observer. My TV notes were initially unsigned and then until 1987 attributed to 'Leigh Woods' because I was prevented by the BBC from commenting publicly on broadcasting matters.\n\nThe paper finally got around to offering me the movie column on a permanent basis in 1973, but I was reluctant to quit the BBC. I was worried I might get stale and yet be forced to go on writing. When it was offered again in 1977, I knew it would be the last chance. The BBC gave me permission to do it for a year. This has stretched out for three happy decades.\n\nThe job was simpler in the 1960s and 1970s. Fewer films were shown to the press, seldom more than three or four a week. Nowadays, there are invariably seven and often as many as 11, most released as pre-publicity for domestic versions on DVD. There was in those days the expectation that the movies were dying as a popular medium, that they would become a cottage industry. Films from all over the world would fill the gap left by a moribund Hollywood and a new purity would redeem the cinema. This hasn't proved to be the case. The bearded movie brats from film schools - Scorsese, Lucas, Spielberg, Coppola, De Palma, Milius - absorbed the lessons that foreign movies taught, reassessed the American cinema of the past under the tutelage of the French director-critics of the Nouvelle Vague, and gave it new life. But their extravagance led to clean-shaven men in suits taking control of Hollywood, and they have proved more concerned with the bottom line than were the industry's founding moguls, who were as interested in prestige as they were in money.\n\nI love seeing movies as much as I ever did, but I don't like going to the cinema as much. Virtually all the little independent cinemas have disappeared. The larger cinemas, converted or newly built, lack character. Just as the vogue for Art Deco was getting under way, the Odeon Leicester Square was gutted of its prewar glory. I nearly wept in May 1972 driving into London from Stansted after some months of teaching in Texas, and passing two of my favourite cinemas, both closed down during my absence. One was the magnificent Astoria, Finsbury Park, beloved of John Betjeman, which is now a Pentecostal church. It had a marble entrance hall with a fountain and goldfish in the pool and a star-filled ceiling. The second was the Tolmer, across the Euston Road from Warren Street station. It reeked of cigarette smoke and disinfectant and always showed double bills. To me, all ports are different, all airports much the same. Cinemas have become as anonymous as airports.\n\nThere have been major changes in the ranks of people who review films and the way they review them, and the reception of their writings. There were occasions 50 and 60 years ago when film distributors acted to suppress certain critics.\n\nE Arnot Robertson brought an unsuccessful action for libel against MGM when they wrote to the BBC saying she was unfit to broadcast about their movies. Dismissive reviews by Milton Shulman led film companies to withdraw advertising from the London Evening Standard. Its Canadian proprietor, Lord Beaverbrook, successfully called their bluff, but shortly thereafter Shulman switched to covering theatre. Now the larger companies are indifferent to critics. Reviews aren't important for big-budget films. They are important to art-house movies, which in itself produces problems. Should critics give an easier ride to dedicated, cash-strapped, cinephile distributors of serious films?\n\nWhen I started reviewing, most of the national critics had begun seeing films in the silent era. For them all, the Second World War was a significant experience. The male critics always wore ties and suits, the women blouses, skirts and hats. Nowadays, there are few suits and ties at press screenings. Except at festival time, elaborate hospitality is rare. Premieres precede the release of films by up to a fortnight as events designed to get on to the news pages and deflect critical assessment.\n\nMost of today's critics have grown up with TV and take the existence of reference books, Wikipedia and DVDs for granted. They know more and are more knowing, and have become habituated to the violence, erotica and no-expletive-deleted dialogue their liberal elders fought for in a battle to free the cinema from censorship. But surviving combatants of that struggle are, secretly, a little shocked by what they see on the screen nowadays.\n\nWhat have I done these past 70 years, apart from sit through around 14,000 films and be paid for doing what I like? I may have helped a few careers (Martin Scorsese, Stephen Frears, Walter Hill, Terence Davies, Bertrand Tavernier, Neil Jordan, Christopher Nolan) and encouraged readers to think about the contributions of cinematographers, editors, composers, production designers. I hope I've contributed to creating a climate that looks at cinema and its history in a more comprehensive manner.\n\nFor eight years in the 1960s and 1970s, I served on the British Film Institute's Production Board, working under two Ealing stalwarts, Michael Balcon and Michael Relph, helping to encourage young film-makers. At one minor but significant juncture, I played an interesting role at the 1986 Cannes Festival when I was on the jury. Sydney Pollack, the gifted director, presided over nine fellow jurors, all major figures in the movie business, among them singer Charles Aznavour, director István Szabó, cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli, and octogenarian production designer Alexandre Trauner, the only member of the jury allowed to leave for a pee during screenings. The single occasion when trouble loomed came when one of the jurors, the suave French producer Alexandre Mnouchkine, suggested that the Oscars were a Hollywood fix. Pollack bristled. His eyes narrowed. He was briefly a frightening presence. 'Absolument pas,' he said. There was a palpable silence and we all went back to business.\n\nI thought that there was going to be the usual wrangling and that I would be marginalised as a low-paid foreign critic. To my surprise, this proved not to be the case. Only a few weeks before Cannes, I'd written a scathing review of Pollack's Oscar-winning Out of Africa. An artist and true gentleman, he interrupted me when I began some sort of apology for the piece. So we hit it off from the start. He presided and decisions were reached amicably. My contribution was to persuade my fellow jurors to give the Palme d'Or for the best short movie to Jane Campion's 10-minute film Peel. Partly as a result of this, the Australian Film Commission financed her first feature, Sweetie.\n\nThe Palme d'Or for 1986 went to Roland Joffé's The Mission, and the special jury prize was awarded to Russian émigré André Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice, which went unmentioned in the Soviet press. I thought we, the jury, had done a good job. But as my wife and I stood in the foyer of the Palais du Festival after the presentations, a gentleman in a white tuxedo (who turned out to be a French producer) asked: 'You are a member of the jury, no?' 'Yes,' I said, preparing myself to accept a compliment. 'You have disgraced yourselves,' he replied. 'This will be remembered as a night of shame.'\n\nThat is the price you pay for being a critic and I'm surprised it hasn't happened more often. Mostly I get pleasant letters from readers, seeking information or sharing moviegoing experiences, and from film-makers for noting aspects of their work that others had missed. Critics are frequently charged with being sadists, but they could as easily be thought of as masochists for the abuse they're supposed to be happy to attract. It's true that it's not the reasoned letters that finish up on the letter board, but the vituperative ones. For several years, I kept an unsigned, crudely written note (from Leeds, I think) pinned above my desk. It attacked me for having given away the plot of some now long forgotten thriller and began: 'You cunt! You fucked up my weekend!' It stood beside an autographed photograph of Satyajit Ray and Akira Kurosawa, walking thoughtfully together in front of the Taj Mahal, taken during a trip I made with them to Agra from a festival in Delhi in the 1970s. When I wonder whether writing about the cinema is worthwhile, I look up to that photograph for reassurance."
