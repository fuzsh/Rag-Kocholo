But perhaps the most remarkable thing about this letter - and certainly the reason it merits inclusion here - is the letterhead on which it is written. Across the top of the single page, in simple blockletters, is the author's name: Martin Scorsese. The director makes clear in the text why this particular cause is so dose to his heart. Having grown up on Elizabeth Street, the neighborhood and residents of the Bowery became clear catalysts for turning me into a storyteller. Whether it's Mean Streets or Gangs of New York, the inﬂuence of The Bowery - the grittiness, the ambience, the vivid atmosphere - is apparent. (Scorsese, 2013) As Scorsese's letter to the Planning Commission suggests, he intuitively under stands the ways in which city space is divided and bounded.

Today, that edge has been ratiﬁed in the administrative organiza tion of space at the municipal level.' My interest in this letter involves Scorsese's motives in intervening in a neighborhood zoning dispute. The letter underscores a core concern that motivates much of the director's urban cinema: the myriad ways in which space is organized and divided within the city. Throughout his career, we can trace the importance of space in his ﬁlms, often in the emphasis he places on organizing cinematic space in a way that respects the cultural signiﬁcance of neighborhoods and boundaries. Indeed, to cal Scorsese a \"New York director\" is something of an overstatement, since so many of his ﬁlms mine the even more speciﬁc geography of Lower Manhattan. Implicit in this emphasis on boundaries, of course, is the act of boundary crossing, of transgression. Here, I aim to demonstrate how Scorseses ﬁlms map out a portrait of the city that relies heavily upon the territoriality of urban space. As beﬁtting a child of Little Italy, Scorsese - like the protagonists of the fUms he makes - consistently demonstrates an intuitive understanding of the ways in which city space is divided and bounded. His ﬁlms explore how those boundaries are negotiated, contested, and occasionally transgressed; as I show, much of the dramatic tension in Scorsese's narratives derives from the challenges to the settled spatial order of cities that these acts of transgression represent. This chapter begins with a discussion of the inﬂuence of Little Italy's history on Scorsese's work, before turning to establish the theoretical foundation for considering his relationship to and representation of urban space. From there, I consider four of the director's ﬁlms: Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), Aﬁer Hours (1984), and Gangs of New York (2002). Chronologicaly, these ﬁlms represent a diverse cross section of the director's career, but thematically all are linked in a shared engagement with the city spaces of New York, in ways that I will discuss in greater detail later in the text. In offering close readings of the roles of boundary and transgression in these ﬁlms, I aim to highlight the important ways in which Scorsese's ﬁlms focus our attention on cinema's engagement with the urban, and help us to think about the ways in which the cinema, as a storytelling medium, helps to produce new understandings of urban space. Little Italy Boundaries, of course, are not mere accidents of cartographical happen stance; instead, they are subject to a continual and discursive process of Borderlines: Boundaries and Transgression in the City Films of Martin Scorsese 333 renewal and contestation.^ The borderlines that deﬁne city space in one era may cease to have relevance in another; Scorsese's own Little Italy neighbor hood serves as a stark reminder of this process at work. What was once a thriving center of Italian-American life in New York (documented in Scors ese's 1974 ﬁlm of the same name) was by the turn of the millennium reduced to, by the director's own admission, \"a fagade\" of Italian culture (Tonelli, 2004). Quoted in a New York magazine story on efforts to staunch the decline of Italian-American culture in the neighborhood, Scorsese reﬂected on the change he's wimessed over his lifetime, remarking that \"Little Italy was a place that existed for maybe 50, 60 years, and now it's all over. It was a stop ping point for people.\" The place where Scorsese grew up is now largely a historical artifact. Its status as a historically protected district ensures its continued survival in some recognizably \"Italian\" guise, if only in the form of a concentration of restau rants and Italian-oriented shops that allow the neighborhood to function as what Richard Alba, in the same New York article, calls \"an authentic urban village.\" Bill Tonelli, the author of the essay, ampliﬁes this point, describing the formerly mean streets of Little Italy as now \"an open-air theme park of nineteenth- and twentieth-century European immigration to the Lower East Side. It's the city's last vestige of noble Caucasian poverty, a touchstone of the American rags-to-riches tale.\" But in terms of its demographic composition, the day has long since passed when Italian immigrants and their descendants made up a majority of the residents in the area; the gradual northward expansion of Chinatown (imme diately to its south), coupled with the more recent gentriﬁcation of Lower Manhattan emanating out of SoHo (immediately to its west), has squeezed the neighborhood on both sides. In concluding his reminiscence, Scorsese observes this phenomenon at work: \"What's amazing to me is that the neigh borhood is now a chic place. It gives it new life.\" Biographers and critics often cite Scorsese's experience of growing up in Little Italy as central to an understanding of his body of work.' To be sure, the director's upbringing instilled in him a particular understanding of cities - raced, classed, gendered, and marked by ethnicity - that informs his ﬁlms throughout his career. Yet as his remarks in the New York article suggest, the Little Italy of Scorsese's childhood is a ﬂeeting concept, a loose signiﬁer for a particular constellation of social, cultural, and economic conditions that pre vailed in a speciﬁc place at a speciﬁc time. Scorsese describes those environs succincdy to Christie and Thompson; At this time [of his childhood] the Italian-American community lived in a series of about ten blocks, starting from Houston Street down to Chinatown at Canal Street. The three main blocks were Elizabeth Street, Mott Street, and Mulberry Street. Little Italy was very sharply deﬁned, so often the people from one block wouldn't"
