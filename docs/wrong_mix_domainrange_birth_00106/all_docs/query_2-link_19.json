        "text": "The jury described him as an uncontested major figure of contemporary cinema.\n\nNew York-born of Italian descent, Scorsese has produced and directed dozens of fiction and documentary films, including Taxi Driver, Cape Fear, Casino and The Wolf Of Wall Street.\n\nThe 75-year-old has also worked on popular TV series and performed as an actor.\n\nThe jury described his work as “transcendent”, uniting “mastery, innovation and classicism”.\n\nThe 50,000-euro (£43,700) award announced on Wednesday is the first of eight prizes, also including social sciences, sports and scientific research, handed out annually by a foundation named for Crown Princess Leonor.\n\nThe awards are presented each autumn."
