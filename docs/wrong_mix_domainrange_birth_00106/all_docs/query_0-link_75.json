        "text": "(2 of 2)\n\nFor a while, she was known as the woman who said no to Leo. Leonardo Di Caprio had wanted to play the title role in American Psycho, her film of Bret Easton Ellis' incendiary novel about a yuppie murderer, and Harron declined. But after Di Caprio dropped out, she made the $6 million movie with Christian Bale. Anyone who saw her I Shot Andy Warhol, with Lili Taylor as would-be assassin Valerie Solanas, could spot the Canadian-born Oxford graduate's mulishness and taste for beguiling sociopaths. Also her love of period Manhattan. \"The Ellis novel has enormously violent sections,\" she says. \"But there's also some great satirical stuff about the late '80s. It's better than Bonfire of the Vanities.\" The film, which has just been given an NC-17 rating (for sex, not violence), may set off a bonfire of its own. Meanwhile, she's already nurturing her next big project: at 47, she is six months pregnant with her second child by her husband, director John Walsh.\n\nLISA KRUEGER Committed\n\nAt a precocious 19 she was in Paris studying film, yet this San Francisco native took more than a decade to get working on her debut feature, Manny and Lo. \"There's no way I could blast out of film school at 19 and tell someone, 'Hand me a million bucks and I'm going to make a work of genius,'\" she says. \"First I had to prove myself to myself. Maybe it's my Catholic upbringing.\" Krueger, now 39, toiled for indie gurus Jim Jarmusch and Abel Ferrara, then found salvation at the Sundance lab. \"They start treating you like a filmmaker, and you just say, 'Whoa, I can make my movie.'\" On Manny, she says she took the $500,000 budget \"way too much to heart. I cut scenes while we were shooting because I was nervous about the money.\" The 1996 critical hit got her lots of meetings and spec scripts, but this director really wanted to write. So she did: Committed is a $3 million road romance with Heather Graham and Casey Affleck. Krueger's advice to novices: \"Let another person worry about the money. You worry about the movie.\"\n\nJAMIE BABBIT But I'm a Cheerleader\n\nShe apprenticed with John Sayles and Martin Scorsese, but Barnard grad Babbit's boldest inspiration was Amy Heckerling, auteur of Clueless. Says Babbit: \"I want a career like hers: do TV commercials, videos, everything!\" An open lesbian, she read an article about \"homosexual conversion camps\" and fashioned a $1.2 million comedy around them. Cheerleader may not be Clueless, but neither is the 29-year-old Babbit. \"It's no surprise women can direct films,\" she says. \"It's surprising they're being given the opportunity to do so--and taking it.\""
