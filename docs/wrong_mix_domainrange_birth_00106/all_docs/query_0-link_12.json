        "text": "Daily news regularly puts the spotlight on all sorts of famous people. Although we are not fond of juicy information, we inevitably have an idea about a given political figure, a movie star, a Royal Highness, or a skilled sportsman.\n\nThose well-known faces draw our interest and seem familiar to us, because we watch their successes or their setbacks day by day.\n\nAstrology may also be considered as an interesting filter to better define their personality, and to guess whether the events they experience are confirmed by their planets' activities. Astrology does not reveal everything, of course, but using the dominants and other peculiarities of the natal chart, we can see whether the astrological portrait matches the collective image or offers unsuspected additional nuances.\n\nAfter Cindy Crawford and Katy Perry, here is an article about the legendary director Martin Scorsese.\n\nYou can also read all the articles about personalities who hit the headlines.\n\nAccording to the astrological tradition a big difference between the image projected and the real personality is always considered with caution. But it may give good results! This is for instance the case of the movie director Martin Scorsese, a typical Scorpio fuelled by a Leo Ascendant.\n\nToday, his work is among those which impose themselves with their strength and their boldness. It is not surprising that the man was able to win over the most brilliant circles of the cinema, because two powerful signs rule his chart. Scorpio is mightier, for it shelters  in zodiacal order  Mars, Mercury, and a tight Venus-Sun conjunction. It is interesting to note that this luminary, ruler of the chart, acts as a pivot from the 8th sign, and that it is involved in the two configurations delineated below.\n\nThe most specific one is perhaps the T-square formed by the Sun, Venus on the Ascendant, and Uranus. It points to the first problems Scorsese experienced in his life. At 14, the New Yorker of Italian origin suffered from his puny constitution which prevented him from practising sports but enabled him to discover movie theatres. He contemplated becoming a priest for some time. He was already attracted by religion, a topic he finds fascinating during his whole life, but his undisciplined bent, a quite Scorpio feature, put an end to his desire.\n\nHe will manage to take advantage of his nonconformist nature in order to explore different facets of Catholicism in numerous films. The most famous one is probably The Last Temptation of Christ, which caused a scandal, of course, since it showed that the son of god indulges in Satan's worldly and carnal pleasures, and that he ends up happily on the cross. The outcry, and even the violence stirred by this version  a death occurred at a demonstration against the show  definitely proved the importance of the Scorpio touch which expressed itself in every way.\n\nFortunately enough, Scorsese's natal chart also has many assets, such as a Grand Trine pattern linking the Venus-Sun duet to the Moon in Pisces and to Jupiter in Cancer. Therefore, the Water element is strengthened, and harmony prevails among these gentle planets. Thus, as a counterweight to Scorpio's inner violence, Scorsese is also able to behave with kindness and empathy, as well as to aim at self-fulfilment. The cinephiles who have seen The Age of Innocence, Scorsese's first film in period costumes, know this very well.\n\nActually, if we go through his abundant filmography, we discover a list of stories dealing with the will to succeed and drama: Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Godfellas stage characters leaving mainstream society, or gangsters pushing back the envelope. Even though they are caught, they remain superb. Having accomplished their mission or having taken up a challenge, they manage to cope with prison or to get a new ordinary job without qualms, because non-hero roles are extremely meaningful to Scorpio. Whenever Scorsese takes on personages consumed with ambition, there is nothing he enjoys more than describing their fall: Casino, or more recently, The Wolf of Wall Street, ridicule the nouveaux riches, their excesses, and their behaviour driven by greed. It must be underlined that no sign is more ambiguous than Scorpio when it comes to material wealth, since it is both fascinated and disgusted by it.\n\nAlthough he remains discreet about his private life, Scorsese is well-known for having very tightly collaborated with two actors, the charts of whom are in harmony with his own chart. The astrologer notices that he shot eight films with the Leo Robert De Niro, which led him to win recognition in all festivals and to be showered with awards. During these last years, it is a Scorpio like himself who followed on with five projects, Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nWhile De Niro is perfect for roles of aggressive and charismatic characters, DiCaprio inspires more inner explorations by dealing with topics such as psychiatry or personal growth issues.\n\nIt seems that Scorsese fared well in 2015 when Saturn transited his Sun and his Venus. This return is activating his Grand Trine, and there is a serious possibility that it yields some sort of achievement, which may be interpreted as the reward of efforts put forth during his long career. Because simultaneously, Jupiter transiting the Leo Ascendant often promises highlights.\n\nYou can also read the Astrotheme astrological portrait of Martin Scorsese.\n\nAt 72, Scorsese looks in great form and hungry for new adventures. He just received prestigious honours, the 2015 Lumière Prize in Lyon (France), the city where the cinema began. This probably moved a man in love with cinematographic art. Let us underline that Scorsese's 4th House is very powerful and indicates the importance of his roots, his Italian-American origins, as well as that of films. While at the ceremony in Lyon, he announced the project of a documentary on Bruce Springteen... with Robert De Niro, 20 years after their first encounter. In 2016, progressed Jupiter in Virgo may herald that he is getting back to classic films made with care.\n\nYou will also find below the interactive horoscope of Martin Scorsese:\n\nSelect an object to display more information\n\nSelect an object to display more information\n\n* A planet less than 1° from the next House cusp is considered to be posited in the said House. 2° when the AS and the MC are involved"
