        "text": "The Honorands were:\n\nProfessor Mary Beard\n\nClassicist\n\nMary Beard was born in Shropshire and studied Classics at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she went on to complete her PhD. In 1984 she became a Fellow of Newnham and - at that time – the only female lecturer in the Faculty of Classics. She became a Professor of Classics at Cambridge in 2004. Since 1992 she has been the Classics editor of the Times Literary Supplement.\n\nHer research focuses on Roman cultural history, and she is particularly well known for her work on Roman religion, and, more recently, on humour and laughter in Ancient Rome. In addition, her publications span a wide range of topics, from scholarly articles to popular history. She has written on subjects as diverse as classical art, women in power, and academic life. Her most recent works are Women & Power: A Manifesto (2017) and Civilisations: How Do We Look / The Eye of Faith (2018),\n\nAlongside her scholarship, she has done significant work in journalism, helping to improve public understanding and enjoyment of the Classics, through her writing, public lectures, and appearances in the media. She has presented a variety of television and radio programmes, including Pompeii: Life and Death in a Roman Town (2010), Meet the Romans with Mary Beard (2012), and Julius Caesar Revealed (2018). She is one of the most recognisable academics in contemporary public life, and plays an active role in debate on social media, through her blogs and columns, and on programmes such as Question Time.\n\nShe is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of the British Academy. She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2013 for services to classical scholarship, and was awarded the Bodley Medal in 2016. She has also been Visiting Sather Professor of Classical Literature at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nSir Matthew Bourne\n\nChoreographer\n\nSir Matthew Bourne was born in London. He began his training in dance comparatively late in life, at 22, studying Dance Theatre at the Laban Centre for Movement and Dance. After graduating, he co-founded the dance company Adventures in Motion Pictures (AMP), becoming sole artistic director in 1991. He danced professionally for fourteen years, giving his last performance in 1999.\n\nHe created many award-winning works for AMP, including Nutcracker! (1992). Perhaps his best-known work is his production of the ballet Swan Lake, first staged in 1995, in which the traditionally female swans are played by men. Swan Lake became the longest-running ballet in the West End and on Broadway, and has been performed around the world. This was followed by Cinderella (1997) and The Car Man (2000), a bold reinterpretation of Bizet’s opera Carmen, set in an Italian-American community in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2002 he launched a new dance company, New Adventures, which is now one of the most successful dance companies in the UK. As well as reviving some of these iconic productions, New Adventures has added new productions to the repertoire, including the recent Sleeping Beauty (2012) and The Red Shoes (2016). Several productions have been broadcast as part of the BBC’s Christmas seasons, while others have been screened in cinemas worldwide.\n\nIn addition to producing ballets, Sir Matthew has also directed and choreographed musical theatre, including Mary Poppins (2004), for which he won an Olivier Award for Best Theatre Choreographer.\n\nSir Matthew has been recognised by over 40 international awards, and is the only British director to have won the Tony Award for both Best Choreographer and Best Director of a Musical. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2001 for services to dance, and knighted in 2016, when he was also awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award.\n\nDavid Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury\n\nJudge\n\nLord Neuberger was born in London, and read for his undergraduate degree at Christ Church, Oxford.

In 2004 was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal and member of the Privy Council. In this role he decided numerous important cases, including decisions on the admissibility of evidence obtained under torture.\n\nIn 2007, he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and in 2008, Master of the Rolls and Head of Civil Justice for England and Wales. In 2012, he succeeded Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers as President of the Supreme Court, a post which he held until 2017.\n\nLord Neuberger has given public lectures and speeches throughout the world, on themes such as privacy, freedom of information and uncertainty. Between 2006 and 2007, he led an investigation for the Bar Council into widening access to the Bar. He also served on the Panel on Fair Access to the Professions. Since 2010 he has been a Non-Permanent Judge of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.\n\nUnusually among senior judges, he read for an undergraduate degree in Chemistry, and he has retained an interest in science.

His 2013 film, The Wolf of Wall Street, received DGA, BAFTA and Academy Award nominations for Best Director, as well as a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination for Best Film. His latest feature, Silence, is based on the acclaimed novel by Shusaku Endo.\n\nScorsese has directed numerous documentaries including the Peabody Award-winning No Direction Home: Bob Dylan and Elia Kazan: A Letter to Elia; as well as Italianamerican, The Last Waltz, A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American Movies, Il Mio Viaggio in Italia, Public Speaking, and George Harrison: Living in the Material World, for which he received Emmy Awards for Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Nonfiction Special.\n\nScorsese co-directed The 50 Year Argument in 2014 with his long time documentary editor David Tedeschi.

He then taught at the University of Michigan, before going to Harvard University, where he has spent the majority of his career, including several years as Dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government. He is currently the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at Harvard.\n\nPutnam’s research interests include social capital, the bases of democratic stability, and the links among diversity, equality, and community. In particular, he has emphasized the public benefits of social interaction and civil engagement. Much of his earlier work dealt with British politics and transatlantic relations.\n\nHe has written fifteen books, translated into twenty languages. Among them, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (1995) has been particularly influential, identifying a decline in civic, social and fraternal organisations, and the social capital which they generate. American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us (2010), with David Campbell of Notre Dame, won the American Political Science Association's Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award for the best book on government, politics, or international affairs. His latest book, Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis (2015) investigates the growing class gap in the opportunities available to American young people.\n\nHe is a fellow of the US National Academy of Sciences, the British Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. In 2006 he received the Johan Skytte Prize for his contributions to political science, and in 2013, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama for \"deepening our understanding of community in America”. His advice about actionable ideas for civic renewal has been frequently sought by national and grassroots leaders on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nNicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford\n\nEconomist\n\nLord Stern studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge before completing his DPhil in economics at Nuffield College, Oxford.\n\nHe has taught at many universities around the world, including Oxford, MIT, the Ecole Polytechnique; and the Collège de France.
