        "text": "Helena Buescu, \"Conspiracy: Theories and Practices\"\n\nConspiracy is a comparative topic that can be approached from quite different angles. Some of its characteristics, though, remain the same. We will investigate, through texts that belong to various times and cultures, how conspiracies are both social and personal, how they are linked to politics, passion, ethics, and aesthetics. There even exist ontological conspiracies. Or, to rephrase this: are all conspiracies ontological, and, if so, how? What is common to all conspiracies considered? What varies between them? And in which ways are they significant?\n\nHelena Carvalhão Buescu is professor of Comparative Literature at ULisboa. Main areas of interest centre on the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as theoretical issues in comparative and world literature. She regularly collaborates with international Universities, in Europe, United States, Brazil and Macau. She has authored ten books, and published more than one hundred articles, in both Portuguese and international periodicals. She founded and directed the research Centre of Comparative Studies (ULisboa) and served in international boards such as the Institute of World Literature, the International Comparative Literature Association, the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes, or the International Network of Comparative Humanities.

Works by Molière, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, James Joyce, Higuchi Ichiyo, Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Clarice Lispector, Eileen Chang, Salman Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Ang Lee will be explored in light of debates over world literature and globalization from Goethe and Auerbach to contemporary scholars including Pascale Casanova, Franco Moretti, Emily Apter, Shu-mei Shih, and the Warwick Research Collective.\n\nDavid Damrosch is Director of the Institute for World Literature and Professor and Chair of the Department of Comparative Literature at Harvard University and director of Harvard’s Institute for World Literature. His books include What Is World Literature? (2003), The Buried Book: The Loss and Rediscovery of the Great Epic of Gilgamesh (2007), How to Read World Literature(2d. ed. 2017), and Comparing the Literatures: Literary Studies in a Global Age (2020).

This seminar will address different ways in which cosmopolitanism has been theorised, debated, practised, attacked and defended, and how ideas of transnational citizenship have shaped literary texts. We will explore cosmopolitanism’s complex and sometimes fraught relationship with ideas of nationalism, globalisation and w orld literature. We will interrogate how theories of cosmopolitanism are affected by gender, class and identity politics. Texts covered by the seminar range from works by Kwame Anthony Appiah to Baudelaire, Herder, Georg Simmel, Rabindranath Tagore, Virginia Woolf and Stefan Zweig.\n\nStefano Evangelista is Associate Professor of English at Oxford University. He specialises in nineteenth-century English and comparative literature. His publications include British Aestheticism and Ancient Greece: Hellenism, Reception, Gods in Exile(2009) and edited volumes on the reception of Oscar Wilde in Europe and literary cosmopolitanism in the fin de siècle.

Venkat Mani, \"Exiles, Migrants, and Refugees: Borderlines of World Literatures and Global Histories\"\n\nWe are living, once again, in times of forced migration and refuge. In the 1990s, the number of refugees from the former Yugloslavia was highest since the Second World War. For 2019, the United Nations’ High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates 70.8 million forcibly displaced people around the world, highest since the recorded data available since the two World Wars. The proliferation of refugees and stateless people in the world has coincided with the resurgence of exclusive nationalism, and divisive rhetoric centered on securing and insulating borders. The widespread rhetoric of walls and barbed wires on national borders are manifestations of a much longer history of frontier politics, whose roots can be traced back to European colonialism and the ideological geo-political divisions in the wake of the Cold War. In the current times, the rise of majoritarian supremacies, resurgence of populism and nationalism, as well as slow, incessant pressures on natural resources and the current climate crisis are major causes of forced migrations.\n\nFrom the current vantage point, in this seminar we will engage with a range of texts and historical contexts in the twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries that led to the creation of exiles, migrants, and refugees. Central to the seminar is migration as a comparative critical framework. What do historical moments of forced migration and refuge impact our understanding of national and world literatures? How does an engagement with exilic and refugee figures broaden and deepen our comprehension of world literature? How does reading history and literature together enrich our understanding of aesthetic and political representations? These questions will serve as catalysts for our seminar. The aim of the seminar is threefold. First, by engaging with conceptual histories of the terms “exiles,” “migrants,” and “refugees,” we will develop a differentiated understanding of “willful” and “forced” migrations. Second, by refracting European examples with those from the non-Euro-American world, we will try to cultivate a global framework of literary and historical comparison. And third, by locating narratives of exiles, migrants, and refugees at the intersection of “world literature” and “global history”—two terms that have gained traction in the twenty-first century scholarship—we will foster a wider and deeper understanding of fault lines of race, ethnicity, sexuality, language, and religion.\n\nReadings for the seminar include texts by thinkers such as Hannah Arendt, Edward Said, and Hayden White; historians such as Sebastian Conrad, Peter Gatrell, Ranajit Guha, Ayesha Jalal, and Mark Mazower; world literature scholars such as David Damrosch, Debjani Ganguly, Lital Levy, Aamir Mufti; and short prose by literary authors such as Ismail Kadare, Sayed Kashua, Saadat Hasan Manto, Viet Thanh Ngyuen and Atiq Rahimi. By reading literature and history together, we will explore how authors and artists engage with historical events, and subvert, resist, or challenge dominant official narratives by providing alternative, “unauthorized” accounts.\n\nB.

This seminar will explore this question by posing a hypothesis and testing it through a reading of poets writing at the periphery of empire. We will attempt to articulate two world systems and one world republic: the idea of the modern capitalist world system as a dynamic political- economic entity consisting of centers and peripheries in Immanuel Wallerstein’s sense, the modern imperial discursive and conceptual world system that operationalized and later codified a hierarchy of human difference and finally the modern world republic of letters, as Pascale Casanova elaborates it, centered in 19th century Paris and for the purposes of this seminar, on Baudelaire’s invention of modern lyric. The argument to be tested at the center of this seminar is how Roberto Schwarz’s concept of “misplaced ideas,” the innovations produced by the discrepant importation of the novel form into Brazil, can help us articulate a rigorous concept of modern world poetry grounded in the materialities of a modern world system. We will ask: how have poets crafted their lyric modernity partly through a poetic engagement with those dimensions of European modernism and aestheticism that touch upon the civilizational and racial difference that fix them in their imperial peripheries? To put another way, how might racial difference, broadly understood, inflect modern form? We will consider a range of modern poets on the periphery of empire including CP. Cavafy, Aimé Césaire, Derek Walcott, Miraji, W.B. Yeats and any other poets seminar participants may wish to suggest.\n\nNatalie Melas teaches Comparative Literature at Cornell University where she is also resident director of the Institute for Comparative Modernities.

This seminar reexamines the points of intersection between these two disciplines and the possibilities for the “world” in “world literature” and “world cinema” to overlap to a larger extent than is currently thought. Does world cinema, both as an object of study and as a discipline, originate in world literature? Could world cinema, despite its much shorter history, circulate texts of world literature in a fresher way? Exploring these and other questions, this seminar will look at cinema and literature as temporal arts that find their specificity in the ways they engage with different culturally embedded representations of time. We will focus on films that take time not only as theme but as structural principle and as a means of creation and worlding. Discussions will include conceptual intersections between the national, the transnational, the global and the world, the circulation of cinema and literature between the avant-garde and mainstream circuits, and the relation of simultaneity and/or sequentiality between world cinema and world literature. Sources include literary texts by Proust, Woolf, Basho, Cao Xueqin, Arseny Tarkovsky, and Yourcenar, and films by Martin Scorsese, Stephen Daldry, Raúl Ruíz, Andrei Tarkovsky, Akira Kurosawa and Wong Kar-wai. Secondary readings include texts by Raúl Ruíz, Andrei Tarkovsky, Pheng Cheah, Dudley Andrew, Peter Cooke, and Esther C.M.
