        "text": "David Damrosch, \"Globalization and Its Discontents\"\n\nThis seminar will trace the problematic of global world literature over the course of the modern period, looking at the rise of capitalist markets, the shifting of centers, peripheries, and semi-peripheries, and the interplay of empires and broader global frameworks in the age of (semi-)global English. Works by Molière, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, James Joyce, Higuchi Ichiyo, Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Clarice Lispector, Eileen Chang, Salman Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Ang Lee will be explored in light of debates over world literature and globalization from Goethe and Auerbach to contemporary scholars including Pascale Casanova, Franco Moretti, Emily Apter, Shu-mei Shih, and the Warwick Research Collective.\n\nDavid Damrosch is Director of the Institute for World Literature and Professor and Chair of the Department of Comparative Literature at Harvard University. His books include What Is World Literature? (2003), The Buried Book: The Loss and Rediscovery of the Great Epic of Gilgamesh (2007), How to Read World Literature(2d. ed. 2017), and Comparing the Literatures: Literary Studies in a Global Age (2020).

This seminar will address different ways in which cosmopolitanism has been theorised, debated, practised, attacked and defended, and how ideas of transnational citizenship have shaped literary texts. We will explore cosmopolitanism’s complex and sometimes fraught relationship with ideas of nationalism, globalisation and w orld literature. We will interrogate how theories of cosmopolitanism are affected by gender, class and identity politics. Texts covered by the seminar range from works by Kwame Anthony Appiah to Baudelaire, Herder, Georg Simmel, Rabindranath Tagore, Virginia Woolf and Stefan Zweig.\n\nStefano Evangelista is Associate Professor of English at Oxford University. He specialises in nineteenth-century English and comparative literature. His publications include British Aestheticism and Ancient Greece: Hellenism, Reception, Gods in Exile(2009) and edited volumes on the reception of Oscar Wilde in Europe and literary cosmopolitanism in the fin de siècle.

While standardization and the formatting of language and cultural practices are often identified as a consequence of an increasingly globalized world, literature, and in particular anglophone literature today opens up new vistas.\n\nDespite the linguistic ubiquity of English as a language gone global, contemporary anglophone world literature spans a variety of situations and ways of relating to English -- with monoglot anglophone writers, bilingual writers who were born or sometimes still live in a situation of diglossia -- from which it results that anglophone literature is written alongside other languages and other cultural contexts. This increasingly complex map of linguistic genealogies and cultural crisscrossings constitutes a decisive entry point into our understanding of a world largely dominated by the ubiquity of the English language, as this language has branched out in two radically different directions : the ‘Globish’ -- a form of English simplified for the benefit of non-native speakers in technical and commercial dealings and transactions -- and increasingly complex rhizoming forms of English which testify to the renewed vitality of English today. Rather than focus on the cultural common ground and the areas of overlap which the linguistic hegemony of the English language would seem to offer, the seminar will investigate the zones of friction and tension which continue to be expressed, those moments when rather than flow the texts express the resilient ruggedness of our ‘globalized world’.\n\nThe seminar will consider a large variety of literary, linguistic and epistemological issues which will be approached contrapuntally, through the dual focus of theorization (Walter Benjamin, Pascale Casanova, Julia Kristeva, Jacques Derrida, Edouard Glissant, Barbara Cassin, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Jacques Lecercle, Achille Mbembe, Salikoko Mufwene, Vladimir Jankélévitch) and literature (John Agard, Monica Ali, Joseph Conrad, Cristina Garcia, Rudyard Kipling, Jhumpa Lahiri, V.S. Naipaul, Marlene Nourbese Philip and Arundhati Roy).\n\nFrançoise Král is Professor of English and postcolonial studies at Université Paris Nanterre. Her research fields include postcolonial literatures and cultures, critical theory, contemporary 20th and 21st century Anglophone literature, diaspora studies, and more recently the digital humanities vs the precarious body , a topic on which she coordinated a seminar series at the Collège International de Philosophie in Paris (2019-2020). She is the author of several books, including her monographs Critical Identities in Contemporary Anglophone Diasporic Literature (Palgrave, 2009) Social Invisibility in Anglophone Diasporic Literature and Culture: The Fractal Gaze (Palgrave, 2014) and Sounding out History (2018). She is a founding member of the international interdisciplinary research network Diaspolinks and has edited several collected volumes (Re-presenting Otherness (Publidix, 2004), Architecture and Philosophy: New Perspectives on the Work of Arakawa and Gins (co-edited with Jean-Jacques Lecercle, Rodopi, 2011)) as well as journal issues including a special issue of Commonwealth Essays and Studies, Crossings (37.1 autumn 2014), LMA (2018) and a special issue of The Journal of Postcolonial Writing (2019).\n\nSession 1: Rethinking Babel\n\nUmberto Eco, from The Search for the Perfect Language.\n\nGeorge Orwell. 1984.

Not only is writing about exile a specific mode of producing a particular version of the world; it is also a way of thinking about movement, mediations, transfers, and boundaries. Crucially, exile is one of the foundational discourses of modernity that interrogates memory, identity, and language. Today’s notion of world literature is inseparable from a transnational and cosmopolitan perspective, which is intimately – and in a characteristically contradictory manner –linked to exilic experiences and the practice of exilic writing. In this course, we will analyse artefacts (literature, but also some paintings, two texts which fall in the genre of “philosophy of history”, a play, and a film) by European, Indian, Japanese, and American authors in order to begin to think about how exile and exilic writing have been inscribed in the very notion of world literature with which we work today.\n\nGalin Tihanov is the George Steiner Professor of Comparative Literature at Queen Mary, University of London. He has published widely on German, Russian, and East-European cultural and intellectual history. His most recent research has been on cosmopolitanism, exile, and transnationalism. Amongst his recent authored and edited books are Narrativas do Exílio: Cosmopolitismo além da Imaginação Liberal (2013) and Enlightenment Cosmopolitanism(2011, ed. with David Adams). Tihanov is winner, with Evgeny Dobrenko, of the Efim Etkind Prize for Best Book on Russian Culture (2012), awarded for their co-edited A History of Russian Literary Theory and Criticism: The Soviet Age and Beyond(2011). He is Honorary President of the ICLA Committee on Literary Theory, member of Academia Europaea, and Honorary Scientific Advisor to the Institute of Foreign Literatures at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Tihanov has held visiting appointments at Yale University, St. Gallen University, the University of Sao Paulo, and Peking University.\n\nSession 1: Exotopy and Inbetweenness\n\nVerse selections from the Bible (Psalm 137, “By the rivers of Babylon…”); Ovid, “Tristia” and “Ex Ponto”; and Agha Shahid Ali, “When on Route 80 in Ohio”, in Away: The Indian Writer as an Expatriate, ed.

Questions of language, memory, identity, transnationalism and cosmopolitanism – and how they relate to one another – are once again in the spotlight, this time with the purpose of drawing some tentative conclusions while engendering a productive uncertainty about the epistemological status of these notions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDelia Ungureanu, \"Localizing Time: World Literature and World Cinema\"\n\nTwo rising disciplines of the past couple of decades – world literature and world cinema – developed in parallel rather than in conjunction, despite sharing a body of theoretical knowledge and the need to adapt their objects to a globalized world. This seminar reexamines the points of intersection between these two disciplines and the possibilities for the “world” in “world literature” and “world cinema” to overlap to a larger extent than is currently thought. Does world cinema, both as an object of study and as a discipline, originate in world literature? Could world cinema, despite its much shorter history, circulate texts of world literature in a fresher way? Exploring these and other questions, this seminar will look at cinema and literature as temporal arts that find their specificity in the ways they engage with different culturally embedded representations of time. We will focus on films that take time not only as theme but as structural principle and as a means of creation and worlding. Discussions will include conceptual intersections between the national, the transnational, the global and the world, the circulation of cinema and literature between the avant-garde and mainstream circuits, and the relation of simultaneity and/or sequentiality between world cinema and world literature. Sources include literary texts by Proust, Woolf, Basho, Cao Xueqin, Arseny Tarkovsky, and Yourcenar, and films by Martin Scorsese, Stephen Daldry, Raúl Ruíz, Andrei Tarkovsky, Akira Kurosawa and Wong Kar-wai. Secondary readings include texts by Raúl Ruíz, Andrei Tarkovsky, Pheng Cheah, Dudley Andrew, Peter Cooke, and Esther C.M.
