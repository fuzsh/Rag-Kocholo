When Golden State Warriors point guard Shaun Livingston retired on Friday, a number of his fellow NBA contemporaries paid tribute to the 34-year-old veteran.

One of those players who acknowledged Livingston’s contributions was Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters.

It was during Waiters’ first season in the NBA, after he had been drafted fourth overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers, that he and Livingston had their only professional connection. In December 2012, Livingston was signed by the Cavaliers and played 49 games for them that season.

Livingston went on to play the following year with the Brooklyn Nets before spending the last five of his 15 NBA seasons with the Warriors. His timing was impeccable as the Warriors won three of the next four NBA titles.

The Heat were the second of the nine NBA teams that Livingston played with, though that amounted to a cameo during his lengthy career. That’s because he played in just four games of the 2008-09 season before being dealt to the Memphis Grizzlies in January 2009.

Waiters’ career is nearly at the halfway point of Livingston’s time in the NBA. Beginning his fourth season as a member of the Heat, Waiters is hoping to stay healthy after playing in just 120 contests over his first three seasons in Miami. By delivering steady numbers, he will also most likely remove himself from any further trade talk that’s surrounded him in the past year.
