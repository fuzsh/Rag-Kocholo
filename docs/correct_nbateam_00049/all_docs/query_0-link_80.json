        "text": "JULY 11TH: The signing is official, the Warriors announce via press release.\n\n“We are very happy that Shaun made the decision to join our team,” Warriors GM Bob Myers said. “He is a veteran player who, we believe, adds a lot to our roster with his versatility. He possesses the size and skills to play both backcourt positions, which will provide Coach Kerr with added depth and options throughout the season.”\n\nJULY 1ST: The Warriors have reached agreement on a deal with free agent point guard Shaun Livingston, league sources tell Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports (via Twitter). It’ll be a three-year deal with a partial guarantee in the final season of the contract, Wojnarowski adds (on Twitter). Livingston will earn $16MM, which is the full midlevel exception, according to Sam Amick of USA Today (on Twitter). Golden State is hard-capped at a projected $81MM after using the full mid-level on Livingston, tweets Ken Berger of CBSSports.com.\n\nThe Spurs, Wolves, Kings, Hornets, and Magic all reached out to the 6’7″ guard at the official start of free agency. The Warriors weren’t as heavily linked to Livingston, but it appears that they have come away with one of the more impressive reserve one guards in this year’s free agent crop.\n\nThe Nets were facing an uphill battle to keep Livingston in Brooklyn. The guard’s decision to sign with the Nets for the veteran’s minimum last summer was largely tied to his relationship with coach Jason Kidd, who will now be manning the sidelines in Milwaukee. Since Brooklyn is a taxpaying team and only own Livingston’s Non-Bird Rights, the Nets were only able to offer him a contract with a starting salary of $3.278MM through the taxpayer’s mid-level exception, which is smaller than the non-taxpayer’s version he’ll be receiving. After resurrecting his career last season, Livingston found a much better payday elsewhere. His Non-Bird rights would have afforded him just 120% of the minimum salary for next season, which meant it was taxpayer’s mid-level or bust for Brooklyn.\n\nPhoto courtesy of USA Today Sports Images"
