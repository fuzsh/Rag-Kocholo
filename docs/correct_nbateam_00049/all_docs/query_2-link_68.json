        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. (CBSNewYork/AP) — Golden State made a move to fill an important role behind point guard Stephen Curry on the first day teams were allowed to speak with free agents, and it came at the Brooklyn Nets' expense.\n\nThe Warriors and guard Shaun Livingston agreed to a three-year contract worth about $16 million Tuesday night, a person familiar with the deal said. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because teams can't sign free agents until the NBA's moratorium ends July 10.\n\n\"We intend to enter into a player contract with Shaun Livingston once the moratorium period ends,\" Warriors general manager Bob Myers confirmed in a statement. Per league rules, Myers could not comment further.\n\nYahoo Sports first reported the agreement.\n\nThe Warriors are hoping Livingston can bring some relief off the bench behind Curry, which proved problematic at times last season after Jarrett Jack left for Cleveland in free agency. Golden State started the season with Toney Douglas before trading him to Miami and acquiring Jordan Crawford and Steve Blake in separate trades. Crawford and Blake are not expected back.\n\nThe 28-year-old Livingston averaged 8.3 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists with Brooklyn last season. The veteran guard started 54 games — several when point guard Deron Williams was injured — to help the Nets rebound from a horrific start and reach the second round of the playoffs.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Livingston is a big, versatile point guard that would seem to fit well in new coach Steve Kerr's system, which is predicated on ball movement and slashing. Livingston is known for his good instincts and strong post game, and his defense has improved throughout his career, which was nearly cut short by a severe knee injury.\n\nLivingston's days on the court seemed over when he tore three ligaments and dislocated his left kneecap with the Los Angeles Clippers in a game against Charlotte on Feb. 26, 2007. Livingston, who skipped college and was the No. 4 pick in the 2004 draft, missed an entire season and played in just 12 games with Oklahoma City and Miami when he returned in 2008-09.\n\nLivingston has worked his way back ever since, and he became a solid rotation regular for the Nets last season. The Warriors will be the ninth team he has played for in his professional career.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories\n\n(TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
