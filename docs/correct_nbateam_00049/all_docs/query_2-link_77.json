        "text": "After five seasons and at least three championships with the Warriors, Shaun Livingston has a complicated situation to manage with general manager Bob Myers this summer in regards to his status for the 2019-20 season. In July 2017, they negotiated a three-year contract with a partially guaranteed final season, reportedly $2 million of a $7.7 million total salary. To make matters even more layered, the Warriors and Livingston negotiated a guarantee date of June 30, meaning Myers will have to make a decision on Livingston before knowing what happens in free agency. There are a series of different paths that are possible, each of which illuminates different wrinkles of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nRetirement\n\nLivingston has been uncommonly candid about the possibility of retiring, especially in this April interview with Anthony Slater. The purest iteration of this decision would be the 33-year-old announcing his retirement before that June 30 guarantee date. Doing so would give the Warriors the ability to let him out of his contract and avoid paying the $2 million, though they could theoretically choose to do so anyway, as the Spurs did with Tim Duncan’s final season. That would be a generous gesture, but any money they pay Livingston counts against both the salary cap and luxury tax — and 2019-20 will be the franchise’s first season in the repeater tax.\n\nThe biggest reason this scenario is unlikely: it would be a massive act of charity on Livingston’s part to benefit a profitable sports team. He and his representation negotiated that $2 million and he has a right to it. Sacrificing that money without a cogent reason — or sure-fire understanding that the Warriors will pay it, anyway — is so illogical it seems like the least likely outcome at the moment, even if the final result sounds similar.\n\nDelayed retirement\n\nThe biggest difference between this scenario and the one above is timing. Here, Livingston does not play another NBA game but fails to make a formal retirement announcement before June 30. Having such an early guarantee date makes this incredibly easy, as he may be genuinely deciding during that window. In fact, there is a possible offshoot of this in which Warriors management helps influence Livingston’s verdict by retaining or waiving him before his decides.\n\nIf the Warriors cut Livingston before his guarantee date and no team claims him off of waivers, he will collect $2 million with the freedom to do whatever he wants, including retiring, signing with another NBA team, playing in a different league or even returning to the Warriors at a lower salary than his scheduled $7.7 million. Livingston’s only requirement to head down this path is not announcing anything formally until June 30, whether he has made his decision or not.\n\nHowever, this scenario brings some significant complications for the Warriors. First, there is a chance the front office would like to have Livingston on the roster next season should he be interested — but fully guaranteeing him at $7.7 million would be a big commitment, particularly with the luxury-tax concerns.\n\nOn top of that, having $2 million in dead money on the books or $666,667 stretched over three seasons is avoidable if Myers can find a trade partner. The complication there is that unless there is a team that wants Livingston at his full-contract value, the deal has to happen in June (before the start of the next league year) and that makes the situation much harder. Since no teams have cap space left this league year, the Warriors would have to find a team that has a trade exception worth at least $7.7 million with a general manager who does not mind losing $2 million in flexibility before knowing anything about how free agency turns out. The Warriors could offer more than enough cash to cover Livingston’s partial guarantee, but that does not create additional cap space or luxury-tax wiggle room for the acquiring team. Presumably, that limitation raises the asking price in terms of cash or assets should anyone even be interested.\n\nA clear understanding of those complications and the incentives of the parties involved may lead to a third path that helps the Warriors without materially affecting Livingston.\n\nDelayed-delayed retirement\n\nUnless he retires and leaves the money on the table, Livingston will make at least $2 million for the 2019-20 season from the contract he signed in 2017. The June 30 guarantee date made total sense from his perspective when he agreed to it, but the last two years have changed the situation and made it much harder to find a workable solution for the Warriors.\n\nWhile the CBA has rigid rules on renegotiating contracts, owners and players deliberately carved out a few adjustments that do not count as renegotiations and one of them is changing guaranteed salary. This happens in buyout negotiations and sometimes in trades, as Ryan Anderson gave up some guaranteed money for 2019-20 to facilitate his move from Houston to Phoenix last summer.\n\nIn this case, Livingston would not need to give up any guaranteed money whatsoever but instead push back his full guarantee date to some later point in the offseason. He makes the same money, especially if he’s not playing next season but this gives the Warriors and potential trade partners more time to assess the situation after at least the start of free agency. In addition, shifting that date past the July moratorium would allow Myers to negotiate with teams that have cap space this summer, which is a significant portion of the league. Once the dust has settled with the major free agents, some franchises will have some flexibility, making it far easier to negotiate a trade in which the Warriors send Livingston’s $2 million in exchange for cash and maybe a weak second-round pick. The heavily reduced opportunity cost opens the door for a deal that gets the money off the Warriors’ books for salary-cap and luxury-tax purposes.\n\nThe most significant complication here from Myers’ perspective is that trading Livingston closes the door on him being on the Warriors for the 2019-20 season. Livingston may decide that himself by retiring, but having the option for an Andrew Bogut-like short-term return would be enticing due to Livingston’s connection with the players and fit in Steve Kerr’s system. Still, a delayed guarantee date allows Livingston more time to decide what he wants without losing any money.\n\nWhile there is absolutely a chance Livingston plays in the NBA next season either to start the season or joining up later on for a stretch-run contract, these scenarios will all be under consideration and carry financial consequences for the Warriors no matter what happens in free agency this July."
