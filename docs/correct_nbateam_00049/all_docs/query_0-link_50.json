        "text": "Wed, Jan 7, 2009 at 12:00am\n\nLIVINGSTON DEALT, THEN WAIVED\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies acquired guard Shaun Livingston and cash considerations from the Miami Heat for a 2012 conditional second-round draft pick.\n\nWhat does it give the Memphis Grizzlies\n\nLivingston has already been waived by the Grizzlies, who get cash in the deal in return for helping the Heat get under the luxury tax threshold. The Memphis Commercial Appeal reports the pick is protected unless it is in the draft's final five players (Nos. 56-60) so the Grizz lose little. Team GM Chris Wallace told the Commercial Appeal, \"We made a little money off it.\"\n\nWhat does it give the Miami Heat\n\nThe Grizzlies likely won't get much from the pick, but losing Livingston's contract gets them under the NBA's luxury tax threshold (meaning they now don't have to pay the dollar-for-dollar tax on the amount they would have been over the limit). They also get a one-year, $850,000 salary-cap exception if they decide to trade for another player."
