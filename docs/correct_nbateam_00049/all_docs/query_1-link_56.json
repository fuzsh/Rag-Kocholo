        "text": "If you want to achieve #FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), consider skipping the kids. If you do have children, you'll likely find that much of your money shifts from funding your retirement to providing the best life possible for your kids. Not only are children expensive, but they also consume significant energy and time. As a result, your capacity to earn more and boost your income may be reduced. Here is a situation where you can’t have your wagyu steak and eat it too. Retiring with kids is impractical and impossible for most.\n\nAfter the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump, the probability of him becoming the next President has significantly increased. Let's dive into what a Trump presidency could mean for your investments and overall financial landscape.\n\nIf you want to get rich quicker than the average person, consider being greedier when others are greedy. It runs counter to the adage, \"be fearful when others are greedy,\" but in my 25 years of trying to build wealth, I've noticed that the people who took the most risk made by far the most money. Let me share some of my regrets for being too cautious over the years.\n\nInstead of viewing your tenants as destroyers of your rental property, view them as guardians. This mental shift will help you own your rental for longer, thereby increasing your chances of building greater wealth over time.\n\nI’m finding the journey to be way more fun and exciting than the destination. If you’re on the path to FI, take a step back once in a while and appreciate how far you’ve come. Fight on! And Happy July 4th.\n\nHave you ever dreamed of living and working in the paradise that is Honolulu, Hawaii? Before you pack your bags, let me share the challenges of living there. If you can overcome these hurdles, you might just find yourself living a longer, happier life!\n\nWhen it comes to finance, everything is relative. To understand where we stand and make optimal financial decisions, we need to make comparisons. Here are the most important and relevant personal finance ratios to help you make better spending, saving, and investing decisions.\n\nBuilding wealth requires a balance between delaying gratification and seizing the moment to live your best life. I explore the dilemma of whether to buy your dream home now or wait for a better price. I'll then provide a rational framework to help you decide when to make your move. The last thing you want to do is hoard your money and then be too old to enjoy it.\n\nWith mortgage rates remaining high, recasting your mortgage is becoming a more attractive option than refinancing. Recasting allows you to lower your monthly payments by paying down extra principal. Let me illustrate this with an example and explain how recasting is similar to an ARM reset after the introductory rate period ends.\n\nAfter 21 years of searching, I still haven't found the perfect house. There's always something missing. However, I've learned a lot about what makes an ideal home for raising a family in a big city. Whether you have one kid or many, whether you work from home or not, I'll cover all the important considerations you might not be thinking about before making your largest investment."
