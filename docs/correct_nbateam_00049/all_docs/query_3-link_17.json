        "text": "Dallas head coach Jason Kidd has found Exum’s resurgence reminiscent of Shaun Livingston, the lanky ball-handler who joined Kidd’s 2013-14 outfit in Brooklyn, and parlayed that strong campaign into a three-year deal with the champion Golden State Warriors. Livingston was the fourth pick out of high school in 2004, a promising 19-year-old rookie, before a devastating knee and leg injury curbed his third season. “[Exum] had setbacks with injuries,” Kidd says. “Coming back and finally getting into the league. Understanding his basketball IQ is extremely high. He knows how to play the game.”\n\nStarring Keith David, Salli Richardson and Michael B. Jordan, Pastor Brown was released in 2009 and later aired on TV through Lifetime. A 2008 story from The Hollywood Reporter describes Oakley and former NBA player Shaun Livingston as executive producers. Not only was Oakley unpaid for his investment in Pastor Brown, but he wasn’t paid any profits, either. Worse yet, Oakley asserts, Belser illicitly used Oakley’s NIL to assuage additional investors “that Pastor Brown had legitimate and substantial financial partners” and then enter into various production agreements.\n\n“The Bay!” Shaun Livingston said, raising his voice. “Being in Oakland, the fans, seeing the passion that the Bay had. The diversity. All of it was attractive. And they accepted me as one of their own. It was good. The first thought that comes to mind is, ‘Thank you!’ The fans, and I’m talking about the real ones, the people that were there before there was the Splash Brothers, before all the nicknames and brands. To the real fans and the people that supported the team and the players, investing their time and energy and money, I just want to say: ‘Thank you.’”\n\n“It was the timing,” Livingston, 37, said of his decision to leave Golden State’s front office. “It was more about home and family, watching my kids grow up. Being there for the kids. They’re at the age where I want to be more involved. I don’t want to miss out on those moments. “This was about doing what’s important. I don’t want to look back and regret this. I’d rather regret not working with the Warriors than not being there with my kids.”\n\nShaun Livingston: 'Kobe Bryant shot a fadeaway with the left on me, how disrespectful is that!'"
