        "text": "Shaun Livingston officially retires from NBA\n\nShaun Livingston announced his retirement from the NBA on Friday morning. He played a major role on Golden State, helping the team win three titles in five straight appearances. Livingston had the great pleasure of making the Finals every year as a Warrior, and was well-regarded as a role model in the locker room.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nLivingston suffered a gruesome knee injury back in 2007. Nearly every part of the knee was affected, including the ACL, PCL, lateral meniscus, MCL, patella, and tibiofibular joint. He needed three months of rehabilitation to even be able to walk again, and his career appeared to be over. But Livingston made a remarkable comeback to the NBA, hopping around many different teams, before finally joining the Warriors, where he helped end their 40-year title drought. Coach Steve Kerr stated in August that he hopes Livingston \"can be involved with our organization for many years to come\".\n\nShaun Livingston to be waived by Warriors\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are releasing fan-favorite Shaun Livingston after spending the last five years in the Bay, winning three championships.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nThe Warriors are continuing their youth movement and getting further under the salary cap by shedding the contract of the 33-year-old veteran. Livingston did, however, have his worst season with the Warriors last season, only averaging 4 PPG and 1.8 APG. Despite this transaction, Livingston still has a strong desire to continue playing, and will likely have several suitors.\n\nShaun Livingston (personal) will play on Saturday\n\nShaun Livingston will play on Saturday against the Rockets after being away from the team for the birth of his second child.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nLivingston is a minor part of the Warriors rotation so he should be left on the waiver wire."
