        "text": "The Golden State Warriors are hiring former guard Shaun Livingston as their director of players affairs and engagement, he told The Athletic's Marcus Thompson II.\n\nLivingston said the position carries more significance for him as a Black man; before his hiring, seven of the top eight executives in the Warriors' basketball operations department were white men, Thompson notes.\n\n\"I always wanted to take this path,\" Livingston said. \"At the same time, with everything that's going on, there's more purpose in this job now, although I think there has always been purpose with it.\n\n\"I understand I may be the only brother in the office doing this. At the same time, there's more purpose in me doing this job, especially as a Black person right now.\"\n\nLivingston, 35, will be the highest-ranking Black executive in Golden State's front office since Mitch Richmond, who served as the organization's director of player personnel in 2008, according to Thompson.\n\nLivingston played five seasons with the Warriors from 2014-19 before announcing his retirement almost exactly one year ago. During his stint in the Bay Area, the Warriors made five consecutive trips to The Finals and won three championships.\n\nPrior to his time in Golden State, he played with eight different franchises over a decade."
