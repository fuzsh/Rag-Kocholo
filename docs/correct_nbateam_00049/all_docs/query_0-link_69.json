        "text": "Livingston, the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft, chipped in six points and three assists in just over 18 minutes of playing time as the Tulsa 66ers dropped their eighth straight decision with a 99-96 loss to Rio Grande Valley in an NBA Development League game.\n\nWith the loss, Tulsa fell to 7-28 overall, 3-15 at home.\n\n\"I’ve just been ready for the opportunity to play,” said Livingston, who hadn’t stepped on the court since he was a member of the Miami Heat in December. \"Everything felt really good to me in the first half. I was just happy to be out there and playing again.”\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the 66ers announced they had acquired the 6-foot-7 point guard, who has played in 149 regular-season NBA games. But it is perhaps his horrifying knee injury and subsequent comeback that has garnered the most attention.\n\nDuring the 2006-07 season, Livingston appeared in 54 games for the Los Angeles Clippers, but things changed quickly for him against Charlotte on Feb. 26 when he landed awkwardly after driving to the basket. He had torn three ligaments and dislocated his kneecap in his left leg. At the time, it was described as \"the most serious injury you can have to the knee,” by the Clippers’ team physician.\n\nThree weeks later, he had reconstructive surgery, putting an end to his season. Livingston also missed the 2007-08 season, learning how to walk, run, and jump again.\n\n\"I’d say it’s probably 85-90 percent back,” Livingston said.\n\nLivingston, who became the fourth Illinois Mr. Basketball to jump from high school to the NBA, joining Darius Miles, Kevin Garnett and Eddy Curry, began his NBA comeback earlier this season with the Heat, appearing in four games, totaling 41 minutes. A salary cap casualty in Miami, Livingston hopes his road back to the NBA will begin in Tulsa.\n\n\"I want to play a couple of games and see where the health of my knee is,” said Livingston, who has career averages of 7.3 points, 4.7 assists, 3.1 rebounds while shooting 44 percent from the field and 71 percent from the free throw line. \"I want to be able to have some teams look at me and see where I am. I hope to finish out the year on an NBA roster.”\n\nThat \"NBA roster” could end up being the Thunder’s. The 66ers are the Thunder’s NBDL affiliate and the two teams are owned by the same group. The Thunder also has an open roster spot for the rest of the season.\n\nLivingston made an immediate impact in Tulsa’s game against Rio Grande Valley on Saturday night. Entering the game with 2:08 to play in the first quarter, Livingston hit his first two shots, including a buzzer-beating jumper that gave the 66ers a 30-28 lead.\n\n\"You could tell the moment he stepped on the court that he has an extremely high basketball IQ,” Tulsa head coach Paul Woolpert said.\n\n\"Shaun will make the rest of the 66ers look better, and that’s the highest compliment that I could pay to any player.”"
