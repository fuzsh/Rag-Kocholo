        "text": "Shaun Patrick Livingston (born September 11, 1985) is an American professional basketball executive and former player. He entered the league directly out of high school and was selected fourth by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2004 NBA draft. During his 15-year career, Livingston played 959 games for nine teams and won three NBA championships as a member of the Golden State Warriors—in 2015, 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn February 2007, Livingston suffered a debilitating knee injury that damaged almost every part of his left knee. It took Livingston about a year and a half to return. Between 2008 and 2010, he played only 22 league games. Livingston has also played for the Miami Heat, Oklahoma City Thunder, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Bobcats, Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Brooklyn Nets, and Tulsa 66ers. He played his last five seasons in the league with the Warriors and retired from professional basketball in September 2019."
