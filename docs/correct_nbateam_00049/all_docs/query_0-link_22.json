        "text": "The Miami Heat are giving Shaun Livingston a second chance at an NBA career.\n\nThe free agent point guard signed Friday. He hasn’t played since seriously injuring his left knee 19 months ago. Several other teams showed interest in Livingston this offseason, including Portland, Minnesota and the Los Angeles Clippers, who drafted the 6-foot-7 guard with the fourth overall pick in 2004.\n\nLivingston averaged 7.4 points and 4.8 assists in parts of three seasons with the Clippers. He was injured on Feb. 26, 2007, tearing three knee ligaments and dislocating his kneecap.\n\nThe Heat cut point guard Tre Kelley to make room on the 20-man training camp roster."
