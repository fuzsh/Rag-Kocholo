Shaun Livingston hasn't had a typical NBA career. Over the course of his 14 years in the league, the Peoria, Illinois native has played for ten different teams. In 2007, while playing for L.A. Clippers, Livingston suffered one of the more gruesome injuries in basketball history, injuring almost every part of his left knee.

In the last few years, the 32-year-old's career has served as an inspirational comeback story, as he's helped the Golden State Warriors win two championships in three years. With the NBA season about to tip off, Shaun Livingston dropped by The FADER for a word association exercise about his memories from each team he's played for, from the strictly enforced dress code with the Miami Heat to playing against Michael Jordan in practice with the Charlotte Hornets.
