The Memphis Grizzlies acquired point guard Shaun Livingston and cash considerations from the Miami Heat on Wednesday.

In return, Miami received a conditional second-round draft pick in 2012.

Livingston, 23, has averaged 7.3 points, 4.7 assists, 3.1 rebounds and 26.8 minutes in 149 NBA games since he was drafted fourth overall out of high school by the Los Angeles Clippers in 2004.

But had he remained on Miami's roster beyond 7 p.m. ET, the contract he signed Oct. 3 would have been guaranteed.

Livingston made only four appearances with the Heat, averaging 2.3 points, 1.0 assists and 10.3 minutes.

He was a healthy scratch the last 13 games.

Livingston is attempting to come back from a knee injury suffered Feb. 26, 2007, when he tore three ligaments and dislocated a kneecap on a layup in the first quarter of a 100-93 Clippers victory over the Charlotte Bobcats.

Livingston's left knee buckled in a grotesque fashion as he landed awkwardly, leaving him howling in pain and forced to leave on a stretcher.

He sat out the entire 2007-08 NBA season before resurfacing in Miami.
