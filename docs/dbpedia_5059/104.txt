Inter modal hubs play a critical link among commercial, retail, residential and recreational spaces. IRSDC with the approval of Ministry of Railways has decided to undertake the redevelopment of Thakurli Railway Station at Dombivli, Maharashtra.

The inter-modal hub at Thakurli Junction would be restructured with a host of amenities and also be integrated with different modes of transport.

The project, sprawled over 100 acres has been designed to maximize the functionality of urban space, by provision of residential lots (50%), office lots (20%), retail (20%), and hotels (10%).

The prime objective of the development is to connect the fragmented road network into a nested and intertwined grid that can carry an optimum volume of motor vehicle across the site efficiently.
