Altogether, 15 persons, including co-owners of TRP game zone and RMC officials have been arrested,\" said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime), Parthrajsinh Gohil.\n\n\"It emerged during the investigation that the blaze spread and engulfed the entire structure within 3-4 minutes due to highly-inflammable construction materials such as foam sheet, plastic and wood, with sparks flying from the welding work being carried out at that time,\" he said.\n\nThe crime branch stated that foam sheets being used as insulators for cooling at the facility aided in the rapid spread of the blaze, Gohil said.\n\nHowever, contrary to earlier reports petrol or diesel was not found at the site, he added.\n\nThe arrested persons include co-owners of the game zone and RMC officials.\n\nFinancial dealings of Prakash Jain, one of the main co-owners of the game zone who died in the fire, and other accused are being investigated and auditing is being carried out regarding their banking transactions, income tax, and Goods and Services Tax returns and will be used as evidence, Gohil said.\n\nForensic examination of signatures on government documents will also be used as evidence, he added. -- PTI\n\n23:21 Engineer jumps off Atal Setu, search on\n\nA 38-year-old engineer, under stress due to financial worries, allegedly jumped off the Atal Setu transhoubour bridge here on Wednesday afternoon, police said.\n\nSearch was on for him, said an official late in the evening.\n\nK Shriniwas, resident of Dombivli, jumped into the sea after parking his car on the Nhava Sheva end of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (also known as Atal Setu) around 12.30 pm, he said.\n\nNavi Mumbai Police has launched a search for him with Atal Setu rescue teams, coastal police and local fishermen, the official added.\n\nShriniwas, who left his residence around 11.30 pm last night, had spoken to his wife and four-year-old daughter over phone hours before taking the drastic step, the official said.\n\nAs per his family, he was facing a serious financial problem.\n\nEarlier, he had attempted suicide by drinking a floor cleaner liquid while working in Kuwait in 2023, the official said. -- PTI\n\n22:55 Firing should scare Salman: Bishnoi's brother to shooter\n\nFire shots in such a manner that it scares Bollywood superstar Salman Khan -- this was the blunt, one line message given by jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi's younger brother Anmol to one of the gunmen involved in the shooting outside the actor's Mumbai home, police said in a chargesheet filed in the case.\n\nThe Mumbai police's crime branch, probing the sensational firing case, earlier this month filed a 1,735-page chargesheet before the special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court.\n\nConspiracy of firing at the actor's house was hatched with the intention of establishing a stronghold and supremacy in the country's financial capital with the aim of getting pecuniary and other advantages for the Bishnoi gang, according to the chargesheet.\n\nThe chargesheet included various investigation papers incorporated in three volumes. One such document is the transcript of an audio chat between Anmol Bishnoi and arrested shooter Vickykumar Gupta.\n\nIn one of the conversations, Anmol Bishnoi is heard instructing Gupta to carry out the firing thoughtfully and everywhere, even if it takes more than a minute and should be done in such a manner that it scares 'Bhai' (Salman), the chargesheet said.\n\nFurther, he asks Gupta if he smokes. When the latter replies in the affirmative, Anmol Bishnoi tells him to smoke while firing so that he comes across as a fearless individual in CCTV cameras installed in the area, according to the voluminous police document.\n\n\"You will create history by doing this job and your name will be there in all newspapers and other media,\" it said, citing their conversation. -- PTI\n\n22:34 Bengal assembly passes resolution to scrap NEET\n\nThe West Bengal assembly on Wednesday passed a resolution to scrap NEET and bring in its place a new entrance test for medical aspirants.\n\nThe moves a few days after the Karnataka cabinet gave its nod to bring a resolution in the assembly against NEET.\n\nWest Bengal's resolution, tabled by state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay on Tuesday, condemned the National Testing Agency (NTA), alleging it was unable to conduct a free and fair entrance test for students interested in a career in medical science.\n\nIt urged the West Bengal government to resume conducting joint entrance examinations in the state.\n\nSpeaking in favour of the resolution, state Education Minister Bratya Basu said, \"I have got to know from the media that question papers were leaked for Rs 30-40 lakh. The future of 24 lakh children in the country is being ruined. Leave this test to us. We can conduct it in a transparent manner.\"\n\nBasu said the date for announcing the results of the NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test) was rescheduled to June 4, the day when the results of the Lok Sabha elections were declared.\n\n\"I believe that it was preponed to cover up something else. NEET scam is just the tip of the iceberg,\" he said.\n\nThe state education minister said there are two stages of the NEET \"scam\".\n\n\"One is the grace marks and another is number fraud. This year, 67 people secured 720 to appear first in the NEET exam. But last year, the number was only two or three. It is not clear who was given how much grace marks,\" he said, adding that the Trinamool Congress has been against NEET. -- PTI\n\n21:53 Don't travel to Manipur, J-K: US advisory for India\n\nThe United States has asked its nationals not to travel to Manipur, Jammu and Kashmir, the India-Pakistan border, and parts of central and eastern parts of the country where Naxalites are active.\n\nIn a revised travel advisory for India, the State Department said it has updated to reflect information on the northeastern states.\n\n\"Exercise increased caution in India due to crime and terrorism.

Violent crime, such as sexual assault, has happened at tourist sites and other locations. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning. They target tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities, the travel advisory said.\n\nThe US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in rural areas. These areas stretch from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal. The US government employees must get special authorization to travel to these areas, it said.\n\nPlacing Manipur at \"Level 4: Do Not Travel\", the State Department said: \"Do not travel to Manipur due to the threat of violence and crime.\n\nOngoing ethnic-based civil conflict has resulted in reports of extensive violence and community displacement.

The flight test fully met all the trial objectives validating complete network centric warfare weapon system consisting of Long Range Sensors, low latency communication system and MCC and Advance Interceptor missiles,\" it added.\n\nThe performance of the missile was monitored from the flight data captured by range tracking instruments deployed at various locations, including an onboard ship, the statement said.\n\nThe Phase-II AD Endo-atmospheric missile is an indigenously developed two-stage solid-propelled ground-launched missile system meant for neutralising many types of enemy ballistic missile threats in the altitude bracket of endo to low exo-atmospheric regions, it said.\n\nA number of state-of-the-art indigenous technologies developed by various DRDO labs have been incorporated into the system, it said.\n\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh said the successful flight test has again demonstrated the country's ballistic missile defence capability.\n\nCanadian MP Chandra Arya\n\n20:56 Indo-Canadian MP gets threat from Khalistanis\n\nA prominent Canadian MP of Indian origin on Wednesday said the country was being \"polluted\" by Khalistani extremists who were \"abusing\" the freedoms guaranteed under the Charter of Rights, days after a Hindu temple was vandalised in Edmonton.\n\nAmidst rising Hinduphobia in Canada, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir was vandalised with alleged hateful and anti-India graffiti on Monday morning in Edmonton in Alberta state, about 3,400 km west-northwest of Ottawa.\n\nChandra Arya, a member of Parliament from Nepean in the House of Commons, said in a post on his X account that separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun of Sikhs for Justice released a video demanding that Arya and his Hindu-Canadian friends go back to India after he (Arya) condemned the vandalism of the Hindu temple and other acts of hate and violence by Khalistan supporters in Canada.\n\n\"We Hindus have come to our wonderful country Canada from all parts of the world. From every country in South Asia, many countries in Africa and Caribbean, and many other parts of the world, we have come here and Canada is our land,\" Arya, a member of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party, wrote.\n\n\"We have made and continue to make immense positive and productive contributions to the socio-economic development of Canada. With our long history of Hindu culture and heritage, we have enriched the multicultural fabric of Canada, he said.

Now that the leader of the opposition raised issues on the budget, which was presented and tabled in the house yesterday.\"\n\n\"Just to the point he raised, I have not named many states and only spoken of two states. There are a few points I would like to make here as to what happens in a speech. The Congress party has been in power for a very long time in this country and they have presented so many budgets that they would know clearly that in every budget, you don't get an opportunity to name every state of this country,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll take this example: between the vote on account which was presented on February 1 this year and the full budget that was presented yesterday for this year, I have not named very many states. The Cabinet, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, decided to set up a port at Vadhvan, but Maharashtra's name was not included in the budget yesterday. Does this mean that Maharashtra feels ignored?\" she said.\n\nThe Finance Minister said that 76000 crores have been announced for Mahrashtra for that project. \"Maharashtra's name was not taken on vote-on-account. The state's name was not mentioned even yesterday; does that mean the state got ignored?\" she stated.\n\nAdding further, she said, \"And I can take the name of so many different states that have so many major projects. If the speech does not mention the name of a particular state, does that mean the schemes and programmes of the government of India, the externally aided assistance that we obtain from the World Bank, ADB, AIB and so on, do not go to these states?\"\n\n\"They go as per routine, and, in the expenditure statement of the government, the department-wise allocation of the government mentions all this,\" she stated. \"I am saying with responsibility that this is a 'deliberate attempt' of the opposition parties led by the Congress to give the people the wrong impression that their states were not allocated funds or schemes,\" said Sitharaman.\n\nChallenging the Congress, the Finance Minister said, \"I would challenge the Congress party that for all the budget speeches they have delivered. Have they named every state of the country in each of their budget speeches? This is an outrageous allegation,\" she stated.\n\nThis comes after Mallikarjun Kharge condemned the budget presented yesterday and claimed that no other states other than Andhra Pradesh and Bihar received anything. \"Sabke thali khali aur sirf do ke thali mai pakoda aur jalebi. Ye do states ko chodkar, kisi ko kuch nai mila. Neither Tamil Nadu Kerala nor Karnataka got anything.

BJP leader and former union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hit out at the opposition, especially Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, following the verdict, accusing him of defaming India's examination globally with his strong words.\n\nHis choice of words were violative of Parliament's dignity and the dignity of the office of the Leader of Opposition, a position Gandhi holds, Prasad said. He also dismissed Gandhi's criticism of the budget as a \"kursi bachao budget\", saying it was not the BJP's fault if people have repeatedly rejected him and his party in the elections.\n\nDefending the government's action on the NEET row, the BJP leader said the probe in the matter was handed over to the CBI and the candidature of 155 examinees was cancelled. He highlighted the enormity of the exam, noting that over 23.5 lakh students took it at 4,750 centres across 571 cities. Gandhi was using words like \"fraud\" to attack the entire examination and now the court has made it clear that there was no systemic breach in the sanctity of the test, he said.\n\n\"Will Rahul Gandhi apologise...,\" he asked, claiming that paper leaks were rife during the governments led by the Congress.

This is from an Instagram handle called @brownhistory.\n\nIt says:\n\n\"In 2005, Trilochan Singh Oberoi, a Sikh man, applied for a job as a prison guard in California. He passed all the tests and interviews but was denied the job because he refused to shave his beard for religious reasons. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) told him he had to shave because \"gas masks must fit tightly to protect correctional officers from tear gas and pepper spray...\n\n\"In 2008, Oberoi won an appeal in California's State Personnel Board, which determined that the CDCR was discriminating against him. Oberoi argued that Sikhs are able to wear gas masks and comply with safety rules and pointed out that Sikhs have worn gas masks in the US Army. He also highlighted that \"beard exemptions were allowed for individuals with medical needs.\"\n\nIn 2011, Kamala Harris, who was then California's Attorney General, came onboard and represented the CDCR. She argued in court that Oberoi should not be employed unless he first shaved his beard. Her arguments sparked outrage from many civil rights organizations. 34 groups, including the ACLU and the ADC, penned a letter to then-Californian governor Jerry Brown, criticizing the state's actions against Oberoi's rights. They viewed Harris' stance as demeaning to religious minorities and contradictory to the Attorney General's duty to uphold civil rights for all Californians.\n\n\"Only after civil rights groups drew attention to the case did the state settle with Oberoi, granting him compensation for lost wages and discrimination, along with a managerial position in the CDCR.\n\n\"Harmeet Dhillon, Oberoi's lawyer (who represented him for free on behalf of the Sikh Coalition), said in an interview that, \"what I take away from that is [Harris] will only do the right thing when there is political scrutiny from her allies on it. All of the same facts were there throughout those four years,' she continued, \"The case law didn't change, the facts didn't change, only the political circumstances changed, and that's what finally led to the case resolving and my client being hired by the CDCR.\"\n\n10:04 Nifty, Sensex yet to cheer Budget, mkts in red\n\nIndian Benchmark indices opened in negative territory as the Union budget proved to be a non-event to the market participants.

PTI\n\n09:07 July 21 was world's hottest day in at least 84 years\n\nThe Earth experienced its hottest day in at least 84 years, with the global average temperature reaching a record high of 17.09 degrees Celsius on July 21, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).\n\nThis follows a series of monthly heat records -- June marked the 12th consecutive month of global temperatures reaching or exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.\n\nEvery month since June last year has been the warmest on record.\n\nPreliminary data from C3S showed that July 21 was the hottest day since at least 1940, surpassing the previous record of 17.08 degrees Celsius set on July 6, 2023.\n\nWhat stands out is the significant difference between the temperatures since July 2023 and all previous years.\n\nBefore July 2023, the Earth's daily average temperature record, set in August 2016, was 16.8 degrees Celsius. However, since July 3, 2023, there have been 57 days with temperatures exceeding that previous record.\n\nCarlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said the difference between the temperatures over the past 13 months and previous records is staggering.\n\n\"We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate continues to warm, we are bound to see new records in the coming months and years,\" he said.\n\nAnalysis shows that 2023 and 2024 have seen significantly higher annual maximum daily global temperatures compared to previous years.\n\nThe 10 years with the highest daily average temperatures are from 2015 to 2024.\n\nThe global average temperature usually peaks between late June and early August, driven by the northern hemisphere's summer.\n\nThe land masses in the northern hemisphere warm up faster than the southern hemisphere's oceans can cool down. With global average temperatures already at near-record levels, a new daily average temperature record was not completely unexpected.\n\nC3S scientists attributed the sudden rise in daily global temperatures to much higher-than-average temperatures over large parts of Antarctica. Such large anomalies are not uncommon during the Antarctic winter and also contributed to record global temperatures in early July 2023.\n\nThe Antarctic Sea ice extent is almost as low as it was last year, leading to above-average temperatures over parts of the Southern Ocean.\n\nAs the global average temperature typically peaks between late June and early August, scientists expect it to rise and peak around July 22 or 23, 2024, before decreasing.\n\nThe European climate agency said whether 2024 will be the warmest year ever depends largely on the development and intensity of La Nia.\n\nWhile 2024 has been warm enough to surpass 2023, the exceptional warmth of the last four months of 2023 makes it too early to predict with certainty which year will be warmer.\n\nClimate science non-profit Berkeley Earth estimated last week that 2024 has a 92 per cent chance of setting a new annual heat record.\n\nThere is a 99 per cent chance that 2024 will have an annual average temperature anomaly of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, it said.\n\nAt the 2015 UN climate talks in Paris, world leaders committed to limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period average to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nHowever, a permanent breach of the 1.5-degree Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement refers to long-term warming over a 20 or 30-year period.\n\nThe Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.2 degrees Celsius due to the rapidly-increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere.\n\nThis warming is considered to be the reason behind record droughts, wildfires and floods worldwide. -- PTI\n\n08:36 At first campaign rally, Kamala Harris says...\n\nRepublican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations, while hers is a people powered campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris said on Tuesday addressing her first election rally, a day after she became the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations. He is trading access in exchange for campaign contributions. A couple months ago, you all saw that, at Mar-a-Lago, he literally promised big oil companies, big oil lobbyists, he would do their bidding for $1 billion in campaign donations,\" Harris, 59, said in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n\"On the other hand, we are running a people-powered campaign. We just had some breaking news. We just had the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. Because we are a people-powered campaign, that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency,\" Harris said addressing her maiden campaign rally, less than 50 hours after she entered the race after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.\n\n\"This campaign is also about two different visions for our nation. One, where we are focused on the future. focused on the past. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead,\" she said amidst cheers from the audience.\n\n\"A future where no child has to grow up in poverty, where every worker has the freedom to join a union, where every person has affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid family leave. We believe in a future where every senior can retire with dignity. So, all of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because here's the thing: we are all here. When our middle class is strong, America is strong,\" she said.\n\nHarris alleged that Trump wants to take the country backward.\n\n\"He and his extreme Project 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class. Like we know we got to take this seriously.\n\n\"Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill,\" Harris said.\n\n\"They intend to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back then to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what that was like? Children with asthma, women who survived breast cancer, grandparents with diabetes. America has tried these failed economic policies before, but we are not going back.. And I'll tell you why we're not going back,\" she said.\n\n\"Because ours is a fight for the future. It is fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now, Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands. We, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote. We'll make sure every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted,\" Harris said.\n\n\"We, who believe that every person in our nation should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence, will finally pass red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban. We, who believe in reproductive freedom, will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do,\" she said. -- PTI\n\nIMAGE: US Vice President Kamala Harris walks on stage at her first campaign event as a candidate for president at West Allis High School in West Allis, Wisconsin, on July 23, 2024.
