        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe train started its commercial run on October 1, a day after it was flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gandhinagar. There is no change in the departure timing of the train at 6.10 AM from Mumbai Central and at 2.05 PM from Gandhinagar. But the arrival timetable of the train at all the enroute stations and destinations is changed.\n\nIn a good news for Mumbai travellers, the Railway has reduced the travelling time of the newly-introduced Vande Bharat superfast express train from today. According to a release issued by the Western Railways (WR), the Vande Bharat Superfast Express will take five minutes less to cover Mumbai Central to Gandhinagar distance and it will arrive 20 minutes early at Mumbai Central from Gandhinagar.\n\nThe WR said the revised timetable will kick in from October 5. The Vande Bharat train runs six days a week between Mumbai Central and Gandhinagar stations.\n\nThe train started its commercial run on October 1, a day after it was flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gandhinagar.\n\nThere is no change in the departure timing of the train at 6.10 AM from Mumbai Central and at 2.05 PM from Gandhinagar.\n\nBut the arrival timetable of the train at all the enroute stations and destinations is changed.\n\nAs per the revised timetable, the Gandhinagar-bound Vande Bharat express will reach its destination at 12.25 PM instead of the current 12.30 PM. It will reach Mumbai Central at 8.15 PM instead of the current timing at 8.35 PM.\n\nThe train, which connects the capital cities of Maharashtra and Gujarat, is the third Vande Bharat Express in the country. The first such train was started on New Delhi-Varanasi route, while the second one on New Delhi-Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra route, an official said.\n\nThe train provides passengers aircraft-like travelling experience and advanced safety features, including Kavach technology, an indigenously developed Train Collision Avoidance System.\n\nRailways is trying to introduce more Vande Bharat trains in India. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently said the country will have 400 'Vande Bharat' trains in future. He also said that the advanced version of Vande Bharat trains will be able to attain maximum speed of 200 km per hour (kmph).\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n15 Atmanirbhar stocks to include in your portfolio this Independence Day\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\nThree reasons why Tata Motors has taken a contrarian view on hybrids\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
