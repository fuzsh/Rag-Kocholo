Under the scheme, OSOP outlets at railway stations are allotted for showcasing, selling and giving high visibility to indigenous /local products.\n\nThe pilot of the scheme was started oÂ­n 25.03.2022 and as oÂ­n 01.05.2023, 728 stations are covered with 785 OSOP outlets in 21 States and 3 Union Territories across the country. For the sake of uniformity pan-India, the stalls are designed by National Institute of Design offering convenient storage space as well space for display/ showcasing of products.\n\nIn Karnataka, 21 OSOP stalls are operational in various railway stations in Karnataka. â€˜One Station oÂ­ne Productâ€™ are specific to that place and include artefacts made by indigenous tribes, handlooms by local weavers, handicrafts etc.\n\nProduct categories, under this scheme, include the following:\n\n1.
