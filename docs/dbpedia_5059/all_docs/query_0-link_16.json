        "text": "#rainAccidents #Connectivity #Safety #Accountability One more TrainAccident (in Andhra this time) 14 people Killed and 50 injured. Just months after the horrific three-train collision in Odisha that killed 280. Andhra CM has promptly requested PM #Modi and #UnionRailwayMinister Vaishnaw to inspect all rail lines in the country. Since #Railways is a central subject, the CM could easily pass this on to the Centre. And the BJP govt at the Centre could not blame the state govt here a non BJP one , nor it could cite evils of dynasty (AP is also a dynasty-ruled state, a friendly one) as the reason for the mishap. Now, CM, PM, RM, Officials, Opposition leaders, all would visit the hospital and see the injured survivors . Games Powerfuls play! But how about #TrainPassengers Is train journey safe? Or, Just to be left to their horoscope? Some time back I had placed a post captioned #RailwayMinisterThen #RailwayMinisterNow https://lnkd.in/g9xAdGXB It was about the TrainAccident in 1956 in TN. The RailwayMinisterThen submitted his resignation to Nehru within hours and went home. Nehru’s entreaties to him to wait and act didn’t have any effect on him. He was more loyal than the King himself in sticking to the spirit of the constitution and the principle of Accountability in a ParliamentaryDemocracy. His name, #LalBahadurShastri For him the concept of the cabinet minister being #ConstitutionallyRresponsible for what happens in the ministry entrusted to him is unexceptionable. Today’s India does not seem to care about #ConstitutionalRresponsibility of #CabinetMinisters for their departments. The country and the media do not EVEN seem to mention it. When #Parliament itself is feeble and unable to play its watchdog role, what use talking about Govt’s Accountability to Parliament and People. The story today does not stop here. There is huge Gung-ho about #Infrastructure & #Connectivity Nobody can be against Infrastructure/Connectivity See how it works. PM’s Vision about Connectivity has resulted in expansion of train services. It was PM’s Vision to discern and discover the connection between Trains and Connectivity NONE else among 1.4 bn Indians knows the connection between Trains and Connectivity! So, the new trains will bear the name NAMO, the discoverer of this connection. And who mentions this Unique Vision of the PM? The PM himself ! The PMO. If you think the PM and the PMO are different................. Just acouple of days ago I had placed another Post #Namo names trains #Namo” https://lnkd.in/gNZ3JE7Y All these are fine. Only one question How about Safety And #AccountabilityForSafety\n\nhighlights For the second consecutive day, there was a technical fault in the plane taking off from Patna airport.Vistara flight from Patna to Delhi faces technical problem for the second day After about two hours, the technical problem was resolved and the flight UK 718 was sent. Patna. Big news is coming from Patna, the capital of Bihar, where the flight from Patna Airport to Delhi has malfunctioned for the second consecutive day. This time again a technical problem has surfaced in the Vistara Airlines flight from Patna to Delhi, due to which the passengers faced a lot of trouble. Actually, when Vistara flight UK 717 reached Patna from Delhi and was ready for flight as UK 718, it was found that there was a technical problem in the aircraft and there was difficulty in flying the aircraft. After this, the plane was brought back and after solving the technical problem for about 2 hours, the plane was again sent to Delhi. During this time, passengers had to face problems for 2 hours. Passengers were continuously asking questions about the flight to the airline personnel. However, the plane left for Delhi two hours after time. the plane went fine yesterday Let us tell you that yesterday also there was a technical problem in the same plane and people had to face a lot of problems.

I booked a flight from Delhi to durgapur (RDP) on 1/8/'24 due to an emergency (death in family). I took a connecting flight (6E2716, 6E 603) from Del to Durgapur Via Mum. My flight from Del to Mum was scheduled at 1:45 am and the onward flight was scheduled for 6:45 am, that would land in RDP by 9:20 am.Although I had another flight (6E5013)at 02:00 PM (which was both cheaper and direct) but l didn't take it as had to reach RDP in the morning itself. On 31st July around 10 pm on my way to Del airport, got to know that the 1:45 am flight (6E2716) got cancelled. I was in trouble. Somehow got the boarding pass for another flight scheduled at 3:35 am(6E2766). It was connecting to the same flight (6E603) in mum for RDP (didn't take it earlier to avoid short layover). I reached airport pretty early and waited whole night. No arrangement was made by Indigo in Delhi airport for passengers whose flight got cancelled.For the 3:35 am flight we had to wait for almost an hour to start as the craft was'nt ready. It took off after 4:30 am. By the time l reached Mumbai the connecting one (6E 603) had left. There l had fallen sick (due to sleepless night, starvation, stress) and was having dizziness and shivering so the doctor advised to avail wheelchair. Indigo staffs gave me two options. Either to go to kolkata and get a cab from there to Durgapur or going back to Delhi and get that 14:00 flight (6E5013) and reach durgapur (I couldn't take hotel and stayed there for night as had to reach by that day). In both the ways l was reaching home much late. (I had paid more and had taken all the hassle just to save that time, but both my time and money got wasted this way) Anyway, l chose the second one as I wasn't left with energy to take a 4.5 hrs long drive(kol to RDP). So came back to Del by flight(6E2139). Landed in Del at 12:36 pm. Pleaded the staffs to take to the respective gate (from terminal 2 to 3). Due to the change in terminals there was confusion among the staffs themselves and they took me somewhere else (terminal 2 itself) then again I went to terminal 3 and by then they started saying I couldn't take that flight too. I was in a really bad physical and mental state. They said that there are so many flights, they'd send me in another two hours but l knew there was NO flight like that. Had l missed that one l couldn't reach that day. My friend also called Indigo up. Finally, one Indigo staff Abdul Somat ( not sure about the name) took me to the gate and I got the flight. Finally, reached Durgapur at 4 pm. This 4 pm flight (6E5013) was quite cheaper than the one (6E2716+6E 603) l had taken just to save time which didn't happen. I would like to know who will compensate the physical and mental trauma? Who will compensate the time and money wasted? I would expect you to provide me with generous compensation for the ordeal I had to face due to you. #IndiGo #IndiGoirlines\n\nWhat is the main problem of Indians? I was flying from New Delhi to Kolkata. I was sitting on the aisle seat for a change. I didn’t want to pay extra for a window seat and since it was a late night flight, there wasn’t anything to look outside the window. Since I had the aisle seat, I boarded the flight after most of the passengers had boarded so that I didn't have to move if the passengers in the window and middle seat arrived after me. It was an uneventful journey. The flight landed and soon as it stopped on the tarmac, the clacking sound of seat belts engulfed the entire cabin and people got up from their seats. The cabin crew requested the passenger to be seated but nobody cared about it. They were already in the process of getting their bags from the overhead bins. Soon, the aisle got blocked with passengers queuing up to deboard. Just then, the passengers on my left who were in the middle seat and the window seat asked me to give way so that they could get their bags and join the queue on the aisle. There was no space to get out. People were standing next to me and I don't understand what's the hurry to deboard the aircraft! It's better to remain seated than block the aisle like school kids queueing up to leave after school gets over. There's no point in queuing up; you are not going anywhere. Yet they stand like this for 10 minutes before the aircraft’s door opens. Strangely, I have seen this behaviour only with Indians. Citizens of other nations hardly do this. On my international flights, I have seen very few people get up as soon as the flight lands. Even on those flights, one can easily make out from their faces that the ones who get up are mostly Indians. The basic aviation guideline is to remain seated till the gate opens and after that, you are supposed to exit row-wise. I wonder what these people will do in case some Indian airline is required to do an emergency evacuation. Everyone will block the aisle to get to the emergency exits first and nobody will be able to get out ultimately.

( The probability - close to Zero … Reality - 2 ) Well thats how life is .. Wednesday 1 - Delhi - Lucknow As the plane was landing , a passenger in the earlier row … got an attack of ‘fits’. As blood started coming from nose , it was a case of medical emergency . And in this instance, there was no doctor in the flight . Fortunately , as the flight had landed , the medicos on ground were able to handle . Wednesday 2 - Delhi - Mumbai It was the time , when food was being been served . And suddenly there was an announcement- ‘ There is a medical emergency and if any doctor is in the plane , do raise your hand ‘ Fortunately, a doctor was in. The doctor was able to check the basic vitalities and the pulse was good . So finally , all was well and the traveller became better . But this set me thinking…. The probability of close to Zero , became 100% . ( Its time that all of us need to know the basics of medicine - First Time Response skills, need to be in place ) Risk Management at all times , irrespective of what is the nature… At Bellwether Associates , the ‘3 bucket strategy’ along with V-C-P ( Vision to forsee- Courage to buy - Patience to hold ) has stood the test of time. At Auxano Capital its not the count of investments, but the nature of investments , the moat & USP , which is the key . Learnings of risk can also come from the unlikely of all places. #risk #management #investment #travel #medicos #airlines\n\nYou were informed in installments that your flight is delayed by 13hrs. Had the worst experience with Air India Limited. I booked a flight from Mumbai to Delhi, it was at 12:30 am. I was waiting in the lounge and was informed that the flight had been delayed by 2 hours, and would depart by 2:30 am, I thought no big deal I can wait 2 hours more. Then after an hour at 1:30 am, they announced that it was delayed by 4 hours, I was still calm at this point though my night sleep was already sacrificed by this time. But after an hour I was informed again that the flight would depart by 1:30 pm from Mumbai instead of 6:30 am. Imagine a delay of more than 12 hours! In the same lounge, some people were waiting to attend their 📍 Grandfather's funeral 📍 Their court marriage. I had lost my patience, it was crazy, and guess what? Though the government has issued general guidelines regarding delays, refunds, cancellations, etc. It depends upon the airline to adhere to it. A person is entitled to hotel accommodation, a full refund, food or refreshments but it hardly happens doesn't it? I also came across a case where when a family decided to sue Air India Limited because they missed their connecting flight due to a 15-hour delay, and they were issued compensation after 20 years. As if the flight delay wasn't enough, the court delayed justice too by \"tarikh pe tarikh\". Hence, I know people just tolerate and move on. Have you faced any such incidents? Do share with me. #AirIndia #Delhi #Mumbai #flights #delay\n\nStaggering 54% Indian Railways Subsidy: \"Help to poor\" or \"misallocation of resources\" Over crowded trains and hapless passengers have become the hall mark of Indian Railways. A day before on my trip from Kolkata to Durgapur in Rajdhani, I was robbed of my seat by a family of 8 people, a couple and 6 kids, It was a mere 1:45 minute journey and looking at young children I silently agreed to the torture. This is something that has not happened only to me, it has become hall mark of Indian Rail. With a 54% subsidy on passenger fare the railway ministry is not doing any public good. What is happening is that because of meagre resources that they have, they are extremely understaffed, there are no Ticket checkers, no security, the cabin stink as any Indian road side public toilet. The governance is so week that they are afraid of even charging a fare to break even. what is the result: 1. People are travelling more, the extremely low cost is not a burden for them, one can get a general ticket on a 1000 kms route for as less as INR 500 to 700 or USD 8 to 10, these are globally unheard of yield per KMs. 2. Railways do not have resources to ensure safety, quality, hygiene, on-time performance. On every factor there is a sharp deterioration. The average speed of goods train has come down to less then 25 KMs per hour, the average speed of much touted Vande Bharat is down from 84 to 73 KMs per hour. 3. Railways are a big competition to Airlines, and a big drag on Air fares. Even this year Indian Airlines are going to loose USD 400 million as an industry. So rails are impacting sustenance of Aviation. But then, populism vs rationalism, Politicians in India always know what pays well in India. #moca #indianrailways\n\nAGAIN! AGAIN! AND AGAIN! Is traveling with Indian Railways really safe? The recent derailment of the Howrah-CSMT Express near Chakradharpur, killing at least two people and injuring nearly 150, is a glaring example of failure and negligence by the Indian railways. Despite a similar accident just two days before, authorities did not clear the derailed goods wagons, leading to this tragic collision. How can we trust a system that ignores such clear dangers? Why were the necessary safety checks not done? Who is responsible for ensuring the tracks are safe? This incident shows a shocking lack of responsibility from railway officials. They should have acted immediately to ensure the tracks were safe, especially knowing there had been a previous accident. Instead, their inaction led to more loss and suffering. How often are these tracks inspected? What protocols are in place to prevent such accidents? Are the current safety measures sufficient? The passengers who depend on these trains for safe travel deserve better. Their lives should not be put at risk due to incompetence and neglect. Why are the lives of passengers not given the utmost importance? Why are those responsible not facing consequences for their failures? What steps will be taken to ensure such incidents do not happen again? It's time for those in charge to face real consequences for their failures. An investigation must be conducted, and those responsible should be held accountable. The safety of passengers should always be the top priority, and it is clear that the current system is failing in this fundamental duty.
