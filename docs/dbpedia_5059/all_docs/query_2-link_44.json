        "text": "The Supreme Court has quashed a 2015 notification of the Bihar government by which it had deleted 'Tanti-Tantwa' caste from the Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) and merged it with 'Pan/Sawasi' caste in the Scheduled Castes list.\n\nA bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Prashant Kumar Mishra said the state government had no competence or authority to tinker with the lists of Scheduled Castes published under Article 341 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Scheduled Castes list specified under the notification under Clause-1 can be amended or altered only by a law made by the Parliament, the bench said.\n\nIt said as per Article 341 neither the central government, nor the President can make any amendments or changes in the notification issued under Clause-1 without a law made by the Parliament, specifying the castes in relation to the states or Union territory, as the case may be.\n\n\"We have no hesitation in holding that the resolution dated July 1, 2015 was patently illegal, erroneous as the state government had no competence/ authority/ power to tinker with the lists of Scheduled Castes published under Article 341 of the Constitution,\" the bench said in its verdict pronounced on Monday.\n\nIt added that the submission of the state government that resolution dated July 1, 2015 was only clarificatory is not worth considering for a moment and deserves outright rejection.\n\n\"Whether or not it (Tanti-Tantwa caste) was synonymous or integral part of the Entry-20 ('Pan/Sawasi' caste) of the lists of Scheduled Castes, it could not have been added without any law being made by the Parliament,\" it said.\n\nThe bench said the Bihar government knew very well that it had no authority and had accordingly forwarded its request to the Centre in 2011 for inclusion of 'Tanti-Tantwa' in the list of Scheduled Castes as a synonym of 'Pan, Sawasi, Panr'.\n\n\"The said request was not accepted and returned for further comments/ justification/review. Ignoring the same, the State proceeded to issue the circular dated July 1, 2015,\" it said.\n\nThe bench said the state government may be justified in deleting 'Tanti-Tantwa' from the Extremely Backward Classes list on the recommendation of the State Backward Commission, but beyond that to merge 'Tanti-Tantwa' with 'Pan, Sawasi, Panr' under Entry 20 of the list of Scheduled Castes was nothing short of 'mala fide exercise for whatever good, bad or indifferent reasons, the State may have thought at that moment'.\n\nIt said whether synonymous or not, any inclusion or exclusion of any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within the castes, races or tribes has to be done by law made by the Parliament, and not by any other mode or manner.\n\n\"The submission that the recommendation of the Commission for Extremely Backward Classes was binding on the State, is not a question to be determined here, inasmuch as, even if we accept the submission, such recommendation could relate only to the EBC. Whether or not to include or exclude any caste in the list of EBC would be within the domain of the Commission,\" it said.\n\nThe bench further stated that the Commission would have no jurisdiction to make recommendation with respect to any caste being included in the Scheduled Castes lists and, even if it makes such a recommendation, right or wrong, the State has no authority to proceed to implement the same when it was fully aware that the Constitution does not permit it to do so.\n\n\"The Provisions of Article 341 sub-Clause-1 and sub-Clause-2 are very clear and discrete. There is no ambiguity or vagueness otherwise requiring any interpretation other than what is mentioned therein. The State of Bihar has tried to read something in order to suit its own ends for whatever reason, we are not commenting on the same,\" the bench said.\n\nIt said the Patna high court fell in serious error in upholding the 2015 notification on a completely wrong premise without referring to Article 341 of the Constitution.\n\n\"The impugned resolution dated July 1, 2015 is, hereby, quashed,\" the bench ruled.\n\nIt said the action of the State is found to be mala fide and de hors the constitutional provisions and the State cannot be pardoned for the mischief done by it.\n\n\"Depriving the members of the Scheduled Castes covered by the lists under Article 341 of the Constitution is a serious issue. Any person not deserving and not covered by such a list if extended such benefit for deliberate and mischievous reasons by the State, cannot take away the benefit of the members of the Scheduled Castes,\" it said.\n\nThe top court said since it has found fault with the conduct of the State and not of any individual member of the 'Tanti-Tantwa' community, it does not wish to direct that their services may be terminated or that recovery may be made for illegal appointments or withdrawal of other benefits which may have been extended.\n\n\"We are of the view that all such posts of the Scheduled Castes reserved quota which have been extended to the members of the 'Tanti-Tantwa' community appointed subsequent to the Resolution dated July 1, 2015 be returned to the Scheduled Castes Quota and all such members of the 'Tanti-Tantwa' community, who have been extended such benefit may be accommodated under their original category of Extremely Backward Classes, for which the State may take appropriate measures,\" it said. -- PTI\n\nSenior Janata Dal-Secular MLA H D Revanna on Tuesday told the Karnataka Legislative Assembly that his son and former MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of sexually abusing several women, should be hanged if he has committed wrongs.\n\nThe emotional former minister also targeted the Director-General of Police, Alok Mohan, calling him 'unfit' to be a top cop.\n\n\"If my son has committed wrongs, let him be hanged. I won't say no,\" Revanna said.\n\nHe said, \"I have not come here to defend things or to have a discussion. I have been a lawmaker for 25 years. I have spent 40 years in political life. Against me, some woman is brought to the Director-General's office and the DG gets the complaint filed. He is 'nalayak' to be the DG. He is unfit to be DG... This is a shameless government.\"\n\nMembers from the ruling Congress side took strong objection to this. Even Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was heard suggesting that Deputy Speaker Ramappa Lamani, who was in the chair, expunge the comments.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar said, \"He (Revanna) is making allegations against the officials. Let him give notice, and then let him be given a chance for discussion if injustice has happened to him.\"\n\nRevanna made his intervention after Leader of the Opposition R Ashoka drew a comparison between the manner in which Special Investigation Teams (SIT) are probing the Hassan sexual abuse case and the alleged financial irregularities in a the state-run Karnataka Maharshi Valmiki Scheduled Tribes Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nFour separate cases have been registered against Revanna's 33-year-old son Prajwal Revanna, all of which are being investigated by a SIT.\n\nIn the recent Lok Sabha polls, Prajwal failed in his bid to retain the Hassan parliamentary constituency.\n\nThe cases of sexual abuse came to light after pen drives containing explicit videos allegedly involving Prajwal Revanna were reportedly circulated in Hassan ahead of polling day April 26.\n\nThe JD-S suspended Prajwal from the party following the cases filed against him. Prajwal's father H D Revanna and mother Bhavani are out on bail.\n\nThey have been accused of kidnapping and confining an alleged victim of their son Prajwal's sexual assaults. -- PTI\n\nColonel Bhuwanesh Thapa (retd), the father of Captain Brijesh Thapa, who was killed in action in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's Doda, remembered his son and said that he is \"proud\" that his son has done something for the nation and for the security of the nation.\n\nSpeaking to ANI, Col. Bhuwanesh Thapa (retd) on Tuesday said that the government is taking action against the terrorists.\n\n\"I could not believe when I was informed that he was no more. He always wanted to be in the Indian Army, right from his childhood. He used to wear my Army dress and roam around. Even after he had done his engineering, he still wanted to go to the Army. He cleared the exam in one go and was admitted into the Army. I feel proud that my son has done something for the nation and for the security of the nation. The only sad part is we won't be able to meet him again; otherwise, I am happy that he sacrificed his life for his country,\" he said.\n\nNilima Thapa, the mother of Captain Thapa, said that she is proud of her son, who sacrificed his life for the country. \"He won't return to us. At 11 pm, we received the news. He was a very decent guy. He always wanted to join the Army. We used to tell them that life in the Army is tough. I am very proud of my son who sacrificed his life for the country. The government will take action. Unfortunately, we lost our son,\" the mother of the Captain told ANI.\n\nYogesh Thapa, uncle of Captain Brijesh Thapa urged the union government to act against the terrorists. Yogesh Thapa said that the loss they have suffered can never be coped with.\n\nYogesh Thapa said that Captain Brijesh Thapa was killed last night, adding that his body will be handed over by Wednesday. \"He was my brother's son. He was killed in action last night in Doda. We are waiting for his body to arrive, after which we will go to Darjeeling. His parents live in Darjeeling. He joined the service 5 years ago. He was born and brought up in Army areas. He was unmarried. His father is a Colonel in the army. We are expecting the body to be handed over by tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"It is easy to say he sacrificed his life for the country, but the loss we have suffered as a family can never be coped with,\" he added.\n\nFour army personnel, including a captain, died after being injured in a gunfight with heavily armed terrorists in Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Tuesday while reinforcements were rushed in to track and neutralize the militants.\n\nThose killed in the encounter have been identified as Captain Brijesh Thapa, Naik D Rajesh, Sepoy Bijendra and Sepoy Ajay, they said.\n\nThe Commissioner of Railway Safety has said the Kanchanjunga Express accident involving a goods train was \"waiting to happen\" due to lapses at multiple levels in managing train operations in automatic signal zones, and \"inadequate counselling\" of loco pilots and station masters.\n\nIn its probe report into the June 17 accident in West Bengal's Darjeeling district that left 10 persons dead, including the loco pilot of the goods train, the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) also recommended implementation of the Automatic Train-protection system (KAVACH) on top priority.\n\nThe CRS said wrong paper authority or T/A 912 to cross defective signals was issued to the loco pilot of the goods train involved by authorities concerned. Further, the paper authority didn't mention the speed that the goods train driver was supposed to follow while crossing the defective signal.\n\nConsidering various lapses on part of the rail administration, the CRS said, \"Due to improper authority and that too without adequate information, such an incident was an \"accident-in-waiting\".\n\nThe CRS, in its probe, found that besides the Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train, five other trains entered the section from when the signals turned defective until the accident happened on that day.\n\n\"In spite of issuing the same authority, different speed pattern was followed by loco pilots,\" it said. The CRS noted that only the Kanchanjunga Express followed the norm of moving at a maximum speed of 15 kmph and stopping for one minute at each defective signal while the rest of the six trains, including the goods train involved in the accident, didn't follow this norm.\n\nThis shows that \"action to be taken when T/A 912 is issued to them is not clear. Some of the loco pilots have followed the 15 kmph rule while most of the loco pilots did not follow this rule.\n\n\"The absence of proper authority and that too without adequate information created misinterpretation and misunderstanding about the speed to be followed.\" PTI had first reported that the T/A 912 didn't mention speed restriction which the CRS has also flagged in its report as a major reason for the accident.\n\nThe Congress on Tuesday hit out at the Centre after four soldiers were killed in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's Doda, with Rahul Gandhi asserting that the government should take full responsibility for the repeated security lapses and take strict action against the culprits.\n\nFour army personnel, including an officer, died after being injured in a gunfight with heavily armed terrorists in Doda district, officials said on Tuesday. The latest incident comes a week after a terrorist ambush on an Army patrol in the remote Machedi forest belt in Kathua district claimed the lives of five soldiers and injured as many.\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge said he was deeply distressed by the martyrdom of the four brave soldiers, including an officer.\n\n\"Our heart goes out to the families of our bravehearts, who made the supreme sacrifice in the service of Bharat Mata. Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured, and we wish him a speedy and complete recovery,\" he said. No words of strong and unequivocal condemnation will suffice for these acts of violence being perpetrated by cowardly terrorists,\" he said.\n\n\"The spate of terror attacks that has gripped Jammu and Kashmir in the past 36 days, needs careful recalibration in our security strategy. The Modi government is acting as if everything is 'business as usual' and nothing has changed. They must know that increasingly the Jammu region is bearing the brunt of these attacks,\" Kharge said.\n\n\"We cannot endanger our national security by indulging in false bravado, fake narratives and high-decibel whitewashing. As a nation, we have to collectively fight the scourge of cross-border terrorism,\" he said. \"The Indian National Congress stands strongly with our valiant Armed Forces,\" Kharge said.\n\nFormer Congress president Rahul Gandhi paid tributes to the martyrs and expressed his deepest condolences to the bereaved families. Such horrific incidents one after the other are extremely sad and worrying, he said. \"These continuous terrorist attacks are reflecting the deteriorated condition of Jammu and Kashmir. Our soldiers and their families are bearing the brunt of BJP's wrong policies,\" Gandhi said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\n\"It is the demand of every patriotic Indian that the government should take full responsibility for the repeated security lapses and take strict action against the culprits of the country and the soldiers,\" he said. \"In this hour of grief, the entire country stands united against terrorism,\" Gandhi said. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said there have been 11 terror attacks in the last 78 days in Jammu alone.\n\n\"This is a wholly new development. While we must demonstrate an effective collective response cutting across political parties, the question must also be asked: what happened to all those grand claims made by the self-anointed non-biological PM and the self-styled Chanakya?\" Ramesh said on X. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the news of martyrdom of four soldiers, including an army officer, in an encounter with terrorists in Doda, Jammu and Kashmir is extremely saddening."
