The accused has been identified as Shabbir.\n\nNovember 21: Intelligence inputs sent to Mumbai Police by Central Agencies have hinted at Islamist militant outfits LeT, HM and IM joining forces to carry out a terror attack on a five-star hotel in Mumbai, similar to the November 26, 2008 offensive. Security agencies said a seven-member gang comprising operatives from the three outfits has apparently been dispatched to the city.\n\nOctober 21: Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley, the mastermind in the November 26, 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks (also known as 26/11) videotaped the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and its large residential colony in Mumbai for the Pakistans external intelligence agency, Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). This video, Headley revealed, was not given to the LeT. During his interrogation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in Chicago, Headley said, \"(in March 2008) Major Iqbal (who he described as his \"handler\" in the ISI) asked me to explore BARC in Mumbai and specially its staff colony as a target. He gave me the mobile phone camera (and) some counterfeit money.\" After he returned, Headley gave the video to Iqbal but did not give it to his LeT colleague, Sajid Majid.\n\nOctober 19: The ISI, Pakistans external intelligence agency, played a major role in helping prepare the November 26, 2008 Mumbai attacks (also known as 26/11), one of the planners of the attacks has told Indian interrogators. Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley, who confessed to surveying targets for the attacks that left 166 people dead, made detailed claims about support from the ISI, said Britain's Guardian newspaper. Headley described dozens of meetings between officers of the ISI and senior militants from LeT, said the paper, citing a 109-page Indian Government report into his interrogation. Guardian said Headley claimed the ISI was attempting to strengthen militant organisations with links to the Pakistani State which were being marginalised by more extreme groups. Headley claimed that at least two of his missions were partly paid for by the ISI and that he regularly reported to the spy agency, said the British daily. \"The ISI... had no ambiguity in understanding the necessity to strike India,\" Headley is cited as telling the Indian investigators, who reportedly interviewed him over 34 hours in the US in June. The documents suggest, however, that the ISI's supervision of the militants was often chaotic and that most senior officers in the agency may have been unaware of the scale of the attacks before they were launched, added the paper. Headley, who changed his name from Daood Gilani, confessed to his role in plotting the attacks after being arrested in the US. In exchange for pleading guilty to the attacks, US prosecutors agreed he would not face extradition to India or the death penalty.\n\nOctober 18: The Maharashtra Government opened arguments in the Bombay High Court on October 18 on confirmation of death sentence to Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving Pakistani LeT terrorist involved in the November 26, 2008 Mumbai attacks (also known as 26/11). The arguments began in court 49 before Justice Ranjana Desai and Justice R V More through video conference to enable Kasab hear the proceedings from the Central Jail where he is imprisoned in the high security bomb and bullet proof cell. On May 6, 2010, the trial court had awarded death sentence to Kasab. In accordance with law, death penalty was referred to the High Court for confirmation.\n\nOctober 17: Two of the three wives of Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley forewarned the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the November 26, 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks (also known as 26/11),. Headleys American wife had given the FBI in New York a tip-off on his LeT links in 2005, while his Moroccan wife, Faiza Outalha, had told authorities in the US embassy in Islamabad, less than a year before the Mumbai attacks, that Headley was plotting a terror strike. Faiza Outalha, claims she even showed the US embassy officials in Islamabad a photo of Headley and herself in the Taj Mahal Hotel, where they stayed twice in April and May 2007. \"Hotel records confirm their stay,\" the New York Times (NYT) reported. Outalha said that in two meetings with officials at the US embassy in Islamabad, she told them that her husband had many friends who were known to be LeT members. \"Despite those warnings by two of his three wives, Headley roamed far and wide on Lashkars behalf between 2002 and 2009, receiving training in small-calibre weapons and counter surveillance, scouting targets for attacks, and building a network of connections that extended from Chicago to Pakistans lawless north-western frontier,\".Mike Hammer, spokesman of the National Security Council, White House, told PTI, \"Had we known about the timing and other specifics related to the Mumbai attacks, we would have immediately shared those details with India.\" He said the US \"regularly provided threat information\" to Indian officials in 2008 before the attacks in Mumbai, adding, \"It is our Governments solemn responsibility to notify other nations of possible terrorist activity on their soil.\" He made the remarks when asked about an investigative report on the Mumbai attacks published by Pro Publica, an independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.\n\nOctober 16: One of the accused in the Pune (Maharashtra) bakery blast case had said LeT operatives were being trained in Sri Lanka. Though the training was said to have taken place in an area close to Colombo, Sri Lankan authorities denied this citing heavy presence of Security Force personnel in the area.\n\nOctober 15: The wife of a key figure in the November 26, 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks (also known as 26/11) warned US federal agents three years beforehand that her husband was training with a Pakistani militant group. The wife of David Coleman Headley warned Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents in August 2005 that her husband had undergone intensive training with LeT and was in contact with extremists. Headley's wife, who was not named in the report, called a terrorism hotline after getting into a fight with him in August 2008, the Post said. The FBI agents followed up, and interviewed her three times, the newspaper reported in a story co-authored with journalism foundation Pro Publica. She told agents that her husband \"was an active militant in the terrorist group LeT, had trained extensively in its Pakistani camps, and had shopped for night vision goggles\". Despite the warning, Headley was able to continue moving freely, travelling to Pakistan, India, Dubai and Europe in 2006, gathering information and material that made the attack possible. US anti-terrorism agencies did warn Indian counterparts about a possible LeT plot to target Mumbai in 2008, but it was unclear whether the warnings were based on Headley's wife's tip-off two years earlier. Headley was reportedly also bragging about being a US Government informant before the attacks, telling his wife and others that he is working for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and FBI. Headley did work as an informant for the DEA in the 1990s when he was known by his birth name Daood Gilani and had been arrested for smuggling heroin from Pakistan. After a second arrest and more work for the agency, he went to Pakistan, where he became radicalized, the Post reported. Then, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, he began telling people he was working for a joint DEA-FBI project. But FBI officials told the Post they did not believe Headley, who changed his name in 2006, had ever worked for the FBI. Headley, the son of a former Pakistani diplomat and a white American woman, is being held in the United States. He confessed to plotting the attacks and in exchange for pleading guilty, US prosecutors agreed he would not face extradition to India or the death penalty.\n\nOctober 8: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) received an e-mail threatening to blow up either BSE or Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi or a Mumbai-Delhi flight. Intelligence Bureau too received similar alerts stating there was a possibility of another 26/11-like terror attack through the sea route. Accordingly Security was beefed up around BSE and all along the sea coast. Also, Navy, CISF, Coast Guard personnel and fishermen were put on high alert.\n\nSeptember 28: Pakistani militant Ajmal Kasab filed an appeal in Bombay High Court challenging death penalty awarded to him for killing 166 persons in the Mumbai terrorists attacks on November 26, 2008 (also known as 26/11). Kasab challenged the death penalty saying it was a harsh punishment imposed on him and pleaded that there were lapses in evidence produced by Police in the trial court.\n\nSeptember 23: Sheikh Lalbaba Mohammed Hussain Farid alias Bilal, the LeT militant arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) for planning to commit a terrorist activities, has been granted Police custody till October 2 by the Nasik sessions court.\n\nFahim Ansari, who was acquitted by a trial court in the November 26, 2008, Mumbai terror attacks case (also known as 26/11), was produced before a sessions court in Mumbai. He was brought from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh after warrants against him, and another co-accused, Sabahuddin Ahmed, were issued to \"secure\" their presence in the case, currently at the Bombay High Court.\n\nInvestigations into the email sent by the Indian Mujahideen (IM) hours after the Jama Masjid firing incident in Delhi on September 18 have revealed that a second-hand Nokia mobile handset purchased from a shop in Dongri in south Mumbai was used to send the threat mail. However, the shopkeeper has no records of the person who bought the handset. Investigators believe that the terrorist bought a second-hand mobile to reduce the chances of getting traced.\n\nSeptember 21: Mumbai Police detained two persons in connection with the bomb blast outside the Jama Masjid (Mosque) in Delhi. Also, the e-mail purportedly sent by the Indian Mujahideen outfit was traced to Borivali in Mumbai\n\nSeptember 20: Sheikh Lalbaba Mohammed Hussain Farid alias Bilal, who was recently arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) for allegedly planning attacks on sensitive establishments in Nasik and for being the mastermind behind the German Bakery blast in Pune, was denied Police custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, citing \"slow investigation.\" The ATS has challenged the decision in the sessions court.\n\nLawyers defending LeT commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and six others charged with involvement in the in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks said that none of them will go to India as part of a proposed commission to record the testimony of key witnesses, including surviving attacker Ajmal Kasab. \"We will not go to India because of security concerns. There has been hatred among the general public against Kasab,\" senior advocate Khwaja Sultan, the counsel for LeT commander Lakhvi, said. Sultan noted that the lawyer of Fahim Ansari, one of the Indians accused of involvement in the Mumbai attacks, was shot dead. \"We cannot risk our lives by going to India when we are the counsel for the accused here,\" he added. He also claimed it would not be easy for the Indian government to provide security to the proposed commission.\n\nSeptember 16: Mirza Himayat Baig, the LeT operative arrested by the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) over his alleged involvement in the German Bakery blast case in Pune, revealed during interrogation that he had purchased the haversack and the mobile phone used in the blast from two shops in South Mumbais Crawford Market. An earlier forensic probe had found that the trigger used for the blast was an alarm ringer within the cell phone with the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) placed inside a red haversack. Baig is believed to have come to Mumbai by a private bus and stayed at a guesthouse in the Crawford Market area for a day under his operative name Yusuf. The guesthouse is a dormitory with INR 180 as daily rent. The Maharashtra ATS seized the guesthouse register in which they identified his handwritten name and signature. Documents of purchase and registers at the two shops were seized too. The agency is tracing his travels within the state and collecting evidence to establish the chain of events.\n\nSeptember 14: Mirza Himayat Baig, the alleged mastermind behind the Pune German Bakery bomb blast case, and his accomplice Ahmed Zarar alias Yaseen Bhatkal, who is still absconding, had carried a three kilogram RDX bomb from Udgir to Pune, a distance of 380km, in state transport buses before the detonators were finally attached with the bomb hours before the blast on February 13. A senior officer of the ATS said that to avoid any suspicion, the duo dared to carry the bomb in a polythene bag. \"It was easier to carry and nobody would suspect that someone is carrying explosives in a polythene bag,\" the officer added.\n\nSeptember 13: A senior Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officer said that the two militants, identified as Sheikh Lalbaba Mohammed Hussain Farid alias Bilal and Himayat Baig, who were arrested by the ATS in Mumbai in the German Bakery blast case, had plans to target sensitive places in Nasik. According to the ATS, Sheikh Lalbaba Mohammed Hussain Farid had already conducted a reconnaissance mission of the Maharashtra Police Academy, the Police Commissioner Office and the Army camp at Deolali in Nasik on the instructions of Himayat Baig.\n\nSeptember 10: The Mumbai Police are on the lookout for two foreign nationals who have reportedly sneaked into Maharashtra and entered the City to launch a terror attack during the festive season. Following inputs from intelligence agencies, an alert was sent on wireless that places of worship are likely targets. The Police, while releasing pictures of the duo, Kalimuddin Khan alias Rameshwar Pandit and Hafeez Sharif, refused to confirm whether they were from Pakistan. \"As of now, we only have information that they are foreign nationals,\" said Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Himanshu Roy. The Police asked the public to be alert and inform authorities if they spot the two persons.\n\nSeptember 9: Rakesh Maria, chief of the Maharashtra ATS told journalists in Mumbai that Himayat Baig, the alleged mastermind of the German Bakery blast case (February 13, 2010) in Pune, arrested by the ATS, received one-to-one training in bomb-making in Colombo in Sri Lanka in 2008 from Fayyaz Qazi, an absconding LeT operative. Maria said, the Sri Lankan city was chosen only as a meeting point and there was no other significance to it. Ruling out the LTTE or any other connection, he said, \"There seems to be only two reasons for choosing Colombo: the access to the country is easy as there is visa-on-arrival facility.\"\n\nMaria also said that Baig earlier received training in Bhatkal in Karnataka as well in 2007. He was trained in the methods of indoctrinating youth and the techniques to deal with Police interrogation. His primary job was to recruit and send youth for training to Pakistan. He even became a member of the Popular Front of India (PFI) for the same purpose. He was in touch with the LeT and had also been to Ashoka Mews in Pune (the media hub of the Indian Mujahideen which was busted by the ATS).\n\nSeptember 8: Mirza Himayat Baig, chief of the LeT unit in Maharashtra along with another person, Sheikh Lalbaba Mohammad Hussain Farid alias Bilal, was arrested by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on September 7.

Kasabs lawyer Amin Solkar is set to file an appeal by September 20 in the Bombay High Court. He told the court that the filing of appeal was getting delayed as the charge sheet was voluminous and also because of the refusal of trial court defence lawyers to share case papers.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued notice to the Maharashtra ATS on a special leave petition filed by Sadhvi Pragnya Singh Thakur, accused in the Malegaon bomb blast case, seeking bail by default of the ATS keeping her in \"illegal\" detention without recording her arrest.

The arrestees have been charged under the Foreigners' Act for entering the country without valid documents.\n\nJuly 19: The Bombay High Court reapplied the MCOCA to the September 29, 2008 Malegaon blast case. The case, as a result, has been transferred back to the Special MCOCA court. The High Court also held that the bail applications of the accused would be heard afresh by the MCOCA court. The court's order was with reference to an appeal filed by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), challenging the revocation of the MCOCA. A Division Bench of Justices B.H. Marlapalle and Anoop V. Mohta noted that \"all the orders [of the Special Court] are required to be quashed and set aside and all the bail applications would stand restored to the file of the Special court for being decided afresh on their own merits.\"\n\nJune 19: The Maharashtra State ATS arrested a key Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) militant, who had been on the run after firing at Narcotic Control Bureau officials in Punjab in 2009.

The judge cited lack of material evidence as the main reason for grant of bail. Samad is also a suspect in the February 13, 2010 Pune German Bakery bomb blast case. Samad was arrested on May 24, 2010 for allegedly supplying arms to three persons on August 5, 2009. Samad, a resident of Bhatkal Taluk (revenue unit) in Uttara Kannada District of Karnataka, was arrested at the Mangalore airport. Shortly after the arrest, Union Home Minister P.

Seven RDX bombs kept in first class coaches of Mumbais suburban trains exploded on July 11, 2006. The Anti Terrorist Squad said that the conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan and at least five of the 13 arrested persons had gone to that country for terror training. The Police also said Pakistan-based militant outfit LeT had used the banned organisation, SIMI, to engineer the blasts. The trial started in a special court in December 2007. However, matters could not progress as the accused had challenged the application of certain provisions of law. The legal dispute was finally settled by the Supreme Court in April 2010 before the trial court in Mumbai could hear the case again. The process involved a delay of more than two years. In 2007, Saeed Ahmed, son of serial bombing accused Sohail Shaikh Shabbir Masiullah arrested for the 2006 Malegaon blast, and Zameer Rehman, accused in the Aurangabad arms haul case, had filed petition in the Bombay high court challenging the constitutional validity of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

Kasab was given the death penalty on five counts: murder, abetment to murder, waging war, criminal conspiracy and committing terrorist acts.\n\nHe was also awarded life imprisonment on five counts: attempt to murder in furtherance of a common intention, kidnapping and abducting in order to murder, conspiracy to wage war, collecting arms with the intention of waging war and causing explosion thus endangering life and property. \"You have been given the death penalty for murdering Indian citizens, Police Officers, conspiring with Lashkar [LeT] leaders and committing terrorist acts. The court has said while giving the judgment that you shall be hanged unto death,\" Judge M.L. Tahaliyani told Kasab. The Indian Penal Code Sections under which Kasab has been given death penalty are: 302 (murder), 302 read with 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war), 302 read with 34 (common intention) and 302 read with 109 (abetment) read with 120 B.\n\nHe has been given death for the offence punishable under Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

The 1,522-page judgment convicted Kasab of conspiring to wage war, along with nine other terrorists and 20 co-conspirators in Pakistan, and of murder and abetment to murder, among other offences. Among the 20 wanted accused indicted by the court are LeT chief Muhammad Hafeez Saeed and other operatives Zaki-Ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Zarar Shah and Abu Hamza. The arguments for the quantum of sentence will begin on April 4 (today). Special sessions judge M.L. Tahaliyani at the Arthur Road jail court in Mumbai acquitted the other two accused, Indians, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed, of \"all the charges framed against them.\" The two had been accused of making and conveying maps of target locations in Mumbai. The court said: \"The preparations made for the attacks by Kasab and nine other attackers, and the co-conspirators, the training imparted to the gunmen, the arms and ammunition involved and the quantity of cartridges reached proved beyond reasonable doubt that this was not a simple case of murder but an offence punishable under Section 121 of the Indian Penal Code [IPC].\" This Section refers to \"waging, or attempting to wage war, or abetting in waging of war, against the Government of India.\" On the basis of call data records, circumstantial evidence and Kasab's retracted confession, the court found him, the other gunmen and 20 co-conspirators guilty of criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of the IPC. From the conversations with the handlers and circumstantial corroboration of Kasab's retracted statement, the court came to the conclusion that \"they [co-conspirators] were stationed somewhere in Pakistan.\" In incidents involving the nine deceased accused, Kasab has been found guilty of offences punishable under Section 302 (murder) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention) of the IPC. Under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), the court found him guilty of \"being a member of the terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Toiba.\" Kasab was held guilty of \"committing terrorist acts under Section 15 of the UAPA.\" He was pronounced guilty of offences under various sections of the Arms Act, the Explosives Act, the Explosive Substances Act, the Passport (Entry into India) Act, the Customs Act, the Railways Act and the Foreigners Act, and acquitted in some minor cases.\n\nThe Maharashtra Government will challenge the acquittal of Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed from the 26/11 case. Hours after the special court pronounced its verdict, State Home Minister R R Patil said that the Government will study on what grounds the duo was granted the benefit of doubt. \"We will seek opinion of the law and judiciary department before deciding on the future course of action, including challenging the verdict in a higher court.\"\n\nApril 7: Maharashtra Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) submitted its investigation report on the February 13, 2010 Pune bomb blast report to the State Government claiming the perpetrators of the bombing that killed 17 people have been identified and their arrest would be made soon. The report was submitted by newly-appointed ATS Chief Rakesh Maria to the State Home Department and was then forwarded to the Union Government, ATS sources said but refused to disclose the identity of the suspects. According to the sources, terrorist outfit IM is suspected to be behind the bomb blast and the suspects would be arrested in a day or two. State Home Minister R.R. Patil had told the Legislative Council on April 6 that the investigating agency had identified the suspects and more details would be disclosed after their arrest. The Police department has zeroed in on the accused.\n\nMarch 26: The investigations into the arrest of two terror suspects, who were planning to set ablaze the Oil and Natural Gas Corporations (ONGC) Bandra headquarters, revealed that they were also plotting to strike at two more places in Mumbai, including Bandras G7 cinema complex, officials said.
