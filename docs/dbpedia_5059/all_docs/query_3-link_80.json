        "text": "Suraj Water Park, one of Mumbai's well-known water resorts, was built by Muchhla Magic Land Private Limited of India and designed by the White Water West Industries of Canada. This water park is a five times Limca Book of Records record holder and is a winner of International as well as National Awards. This is an exciting water recreation paradise guaranteeing an enthralling adventure for all those who visit the park.\n\nThe International Society for Krishna Consciousness was founded by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966. It belongs to the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition, a devotional tradition based on the teachings of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. The precepts and practices of ISKCON were taught and codified by the 15th century saint and religious reformer Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and his principle associates, the Six Goswamis of Vrindavana.\n\nThe Kanheri Caves constitute a group of rock-cut monuments that are located to the north of Borivali on the western outskirts of Mumbai, the capital city of indian State of Maharashtra. Located within the forests of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the caves are 6 km from the main gate and 7 km from Borivali Station. Tourists can enter after 7:30 a.m. The Kanheri Caves demonstrate the Buddhist influence on the art and culture of India. Kanheri comes from the Sanskrit Krishnagiri, which means black mountain. They were chiseled out of a massive basaltic rock outcropping.\n\nKidZania's content is rooted in an inspirational story of idealistic kids that formed a like-minded community, which led to the creation of a nation, their own government and nationalistic symbols to celebrate their unity.\n\nBelapur Fort is a fort near the township of Belapur in Navi Mumbai (New Bombay), Maharashtra, India. The fort was built by the Siddis of Janjira. It was later conquered by the Portuguese, and then Marathas. In the early 19th century, the fort was captured by the British. After the British gained supremacy in the region, with the expansion of the Bombay Presidency, the strategic importance of the fort declined, and it fell into disuse.\n\nGhatkopar West is a suburban neighbourhood of eastern Mumbai. It is also a railway station served by Central Railway line of the Mumbai suburban railway. Ghatkopar is well served and well connected by the buses operated by the state-owned BEST. Initially the bus services in Ghatkopar East were routed through M. G. Road. Later on, the buses started plying on R. B. Mehta Road, starting with Route 386. This route is now discontinued. R. B. Mehta Road was served with route number 353 which came from Tagore Nagar, ending in Wadala Bus Depot. As the roads in the new constructed areas of Garodia Nagar, were built wider, bus routes in Garodia Nagar flourished. Also route number 497 and 493 is connect thane city, the 497 is going to Lokmanya Nagar thane and 494 is also connect the Retibandar thane"
