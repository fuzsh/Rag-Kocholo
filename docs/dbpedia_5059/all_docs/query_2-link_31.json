        "text": "What\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday has directed the CBI to submit a report indicating the status of investigation.\n\nThe judges have also directed the NTA to approve the time duration between occurrence of question paper leak and conduct of exam on May 5.\n\nThe bench was hearing close to 30 petitions seeking a direction to conduct the exam afresh on grounds such as paper leak, OMR sheet manipulation, impersonation and cheating.\n\nThe next hearing will take place on July 11.\n\nKey observations\n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the NTA said that the top 100 candidates are distributed among 95 sectors, in 56 cities, spread out in 18 states and UTs. He added that it is a “local malpractice”.\n\nTo this, the CJI asserted, “One thing is very clear. [Question paper] Leak has taken place.”\n\n“The fact that the sanctity of the exam is compromised is beyond question. Now how wide is the leak?” he added.\n\nThe CJI underscored that it is important to determine the extent of the leak before a re-test is ordered. \"Cancellation will be the last resort,\" he said.\n\nNext steps\n\nNTA has been directed by the CJI to clarify on the basis of information available as on (1) when the leak of question papers took place, (2) manner in which papers were leaked/disseminated, and (3) time duration between leak and actual conduct of exam.\n\nNTA has been asked to make disclosures on (1) the steps which were taken by NTA to identify centres/cities where leak took place, (2) modalities followed for identifying them and (3) number of students who have so far been identified to be beneficiaries.\n\nAlso\n\nThe Supreme Court Monday rejected the West Bengal government’s plea challenging the Calcutta High Court order of a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into allegations of crimes against women and land grabbing in Sandeshkhali.\n\n“Why should the state be interested in protecting someone?” court observed. More here\n\nGovt safe\n\nJharkhand CM Hemant Soren comfortably won the trust vote on Monday.\n\nHe got 45 votes in the 76-member state Assembly.\n\nThe 30-member Opposition staged a walkout.\n\nThis was the fourth floor test in Jharkhand since January 2020.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nSoren was arrested on January 31 in a money laundering case tied to an alleged land scam.\n\nHe got bail after five months on June 28.\n\nThe 48-year-old took oath as CM on July 4, within a week of getting bail.\n\nMonday’s floor test proved that the coalition government led by his JMM is not tottering.\n\nFewer MLAs\n\nThe Jharkhand Assembly has a full strength of 81 members.\n\nHowever, it is down to 76 as four MLAs (two each from BJP and JMM) were elected to the Lok Sabha, and one (Hemant’s sister-in-law Sita Soren) resigned before joining BJP this March.\n\nCabinet formed\n\nFormer CM Champai Soren, who resigned on July 3 to facilitate Soren’s takeover, took oath as a minister in his new Cabinet.\n\nTen other leaders also took oath as ministers on Monday.\n\nCongress’s Jamtara MLA Irfan Ansari, Mahagama MLA Deepika Pandey Singh and JMM’s Latehar MLA Baidynath Ram, who was excluded from the Champai Soren Cabinet, have been given berths.\n\n‘Thanks, Champai’\n\nHemant Soren made a special mention of Champai Soren who ran the coalition government in his absence.\n\nThe CM said, “Main Champai Soren ji ko dhanyavad dena chahoonga, jinhone sarkar ko chalaya bhi aur bachaya bhi (I would like to thank Champai Soren who not only ran the government but also saved it).”\n\nCrackdown\n\nDelhi Police are utilising the recently enacted Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) to dismantle criminal syndicates operating within the city.\n\nSo far, seven FIRs have been registered under the new law, with at least 11 individuals booked for their involvement in these criminal operations.\n\nCrime hotspots\n\nThe cases were registered at police stations in Amar Colony, Govindpuri, Jaitpur, Jamia Nagar, Pul Prahladpur, Sarita Vihar and Hazrat Nizamuddin.\n\nThese targeted gangs involved in various crimes, including snatching, theft, robbery, illegal possession of firearms, gambling and threatening citizens.\n\nThe focus of these investigations is to dismantle organised criminal groups.\n\nNew law\n\nBNS empowers them to take action against Section 111 (organised crime) and targets a range of offences, including kidnapping, robbery, cyber-crimes, and more.\n\nSection 2 of 111 outlines the harshest punishment: death or life imprisonment with a fine of Rs 10 lakh if the offence results in death.\n\nFor other scenarios, the subsections specify varying minimum and potentially extended sentences, and Section 112 (petty organised crime), which carries a punishment of imprisonment for a term of at least one year, which can extend up to seven years.\n\nCases\n\nIn Jamia Nagar police station, two men were booked for running an organised crime syndicate with their associates.\n\nThe FIR that was registered on the complaint of a cop read, “The syndicate has managed to instil a sense of fear in the minds of the general public due to their criminal activities. As a result, nobody is willing to depose against them openly.”\n\nIt further read that the current legal, penal and procedural frameworks have proven inadequate to curb or control the threat posed by this syndicate. They were booked under Section 112 of BNS.\n\nIn another FIR, Govindpuri police team booked two history-sheeters with a record of over 50 criminal cases.\n\nThese individuals were involved in theft, snatching and carrying illegal weapons to intimidate the public.\n\nThe other FIRs also mentioned similar situations that had led to public fear, necessitating their booking under the new laws.\n\nSubmerged\n\nHeavy rains have hit Mumbai and its surrounding areas in the last 24 hours leading to widespread waterlogging and disruption of suburban train services.\n\nSome areas in the city have recorded over 300 mm of rainfall within six hours from 1 am to 7 am.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and the Konkan belt.\n\nVikhroli's Veer Savarkar Marg Municipal School and MCMCR Powai saw the highest rainfall in the last 24 hours with over 315 mm of rainfall recorded.\n\nDisruption\n\nOver 50 flights have been cancelled due to the downpour.\n\nSeveral airlines took to X to warn passengers and urged them to check flight status before leaving for the airport.\n\nVisuals from across the city showed people wading through waist-deep waters and cars lined bumper to bumper on Mumbai roads.\n\nAll government, private and municipal schools and colleges have been shut across the city.\n\nAt Dombivli station, people waited for trains on submerged tracks.\n\nWater-logging was reported from Worli, Buntara Bhavan, in Kurla East, King's Circle area of Mumbai, Dadar and Vidyavihar Railway Station.\n\nOver 30 lakh commuters use the suburban local train services in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane, Palghar and Raigad every day.\n\nAnimals displaced\n\nMore than 30 animals, birds and reptiles were rescued in Mumbai and surrounding districts as heavy rains pounded the region.\n\nCases of lost and abandoned pets, strays, and domestic animals were also reported, along with wildlife distress calls from the city and suburbs, reported The Hindu.\n\nNo stopping\n\nThe IMD has predicted more rains for the city over this week.\n\nFairly widespread to widespread light to moderate rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning, is expected over Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Kerala and Mahe, Lakshadweep, and Coastal Karnataka, IMD said.\n\nScattered to fairly widespread light to moderate rainfall is likely over Marathwada, Gujarat Region, Coastal Andhra Pradesh & Yanam, Telangana, and Interior Karnataka.\n\nModerate rain is expected over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry & Karaikal, and Rayalaseema during the next five days.\n\nOver to Centre\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday refused to consider a plea seeking menstrual leave for female employees.\n\nThe court, however, has instructed the central government to engage in discussions with all relevant stakeholders and states to formulate a model policy on this matter.\n\nFlip side\n\nA bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud said that while the policy may encourage women’s participation in the workforce, the flip side to it is that it may dissuade employers from engaging women.\n\nIt’s a policy decision which can be attended to by the Centre and state governments, the SC said.\n\nSame stand\n\nThis is not the first time the SC has taken such a stance.\n\nIn February, it had refused to entertain a PIL that sought to compel all states to establish rules for granting menstrual pain leave to female students and working women at their respective workplaces.\n\nThe court had observed that this issue falls within the policy domain of the government.\n\nLaw in 2 states\n\nThe petitioner in the case had highlighted that only two states in India, Bihar and Kerala, currently provide menstrual leave for women.\n\nIn 1992, during Lalu Prasad Yadav’s tenure as CM, Bihar introduced two days of paid menstrual leave for female employees.\n\nMore recently, on January 19, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan announced a three-day period leave for female students in the state.\n\nSurprising turn\n\nThe leftist New Popular Front (NFP) emerged with the highest number of seats in the national assembly, followed by President Emmanuel Macron’s alliance.\n\nBut no single alliance won a working majority.\n\nTough negotiations started Monday as France faced a hung parliament.\n\nPossibilities\n\nThe NFP could form a minority government or become part of a large but unwieldy coalition, reported Reuters.\n\nBut one of NFP’s more divisive leaders, Jean-Luc Melenchon, ruled out any scope for a coalition.\n\n\"The president must appoint as prime minister someone from the New Popular Front to implement the NFP's programme, the whole programme and nothing but the programme,\" he told TV channel France 2.\n\nThe centrists, however, are open to negotiate, added Reuters.\n\nLeft’s agenda\n\nThe bloc’s key proposals included raising the minimum wage, reversing the pension reform introduced by Macron and capping key goods’ prices, said Reuters.\n\nThese, however, would likely not get greenlit in parliament without backdoor negotiations, it added.\n\nInstability\n\nThe results left France, the euro-zone’s second largest economy, in limbo just weeks before the Paris Olympics.\n\nThis could likely weaken the country’s role in the EU.\n\nIt could also make pushing domestic agendas difficult.\n\nOn Monday, the euro fell by as much as 0.4%.\n\nChin up, Macron\n\nSome experts believe Macron came out of the snap elections with his credibility intact, reported Euronews.\n\n\"He will be less weakened than we had expected and France will continue to be able to exercise its international role with a certain panache, as it has done until now,\" Federico Santopinto, director at French think tank IRIS, told the news agency.\n\nWhat about the far-right?\n\nNational Rally leader Jordan Bardella called the cooperation between the left and the centre a “disgraceful alliance” that would paralyse the country.\n\nBut Marine Le Pen is hopeful. \"Our victory has been merely delayed,\" she said.\n\nWhat\n\nBoeing is willing to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge in order to settle a US Justice Department investigation connected to two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018-19.\n\nIt will also pay a criminal fine of $243.6 million (Rs 2,033 crore), and invest at least $455 million over the next three years to strengthen its safety and compliance programmes.\n\nThe plea, which must be approved by a federal judge, would label the aircraft manufacturer as a convicted felon.\n\nWhy\n\nThe plea would facilitate the company’s efforts to move forward as it seeks approval for its planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, especially with a new CEO set to take the helm later this year.\n\nThe plea agreement will allow Boeing to avoid a trial that could subject the company’s decisions leading up to the fatal MAX plane crashes to even greater public scrutiny.\n\nKin unhappy\n\nThe crashes occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia within a five-month period and resulted in the death of 346 people.\n\nThe families of the victims have been demanding that Boeing face prosecution for these tragedies.\n\nA lawyer representing some of the families has criticised it as a “sweetheart deal” and vowed to oppose it in court.\n\nDisadvantage\n\nA guilty plea could potentially jeopardise the company’s ability to secure lucrative government contracts with entities such as the US Defense Department and Nasa, although it may seek waivers.\n\nThe issue\n\nBoeing will admit it knowingly made false representations to the Federal Aviation Administration about a key software feature used on the MAX at low speeds.\n\nThe Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software automatically pushed the airplane’s nose down in certain conditions.\n\nIt was tied to the two fatal crashes.\n\nThis software saved Boeing money by requiring less intensive training for pilots."
