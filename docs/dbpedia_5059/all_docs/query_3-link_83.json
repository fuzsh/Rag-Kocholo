        "text": "We know about the well of death game often held at fair places. In which the rider of a motorcycle or a car, risking his life, rides a motorcycle or a car in a well-shaped circle and keeps moving around at a fast pace. The game is risky and there is a fear of the driverâ€™s life in it, that is why this game has been named the well of death.\n\nA similar situation has also arisen for the local passengers traveling from Dombivli railway station towards Mumbai during peak hour. Incidents of death of passengers falling from the local trains are happening every day. Whereas in this case, instead of working towards solving the problem, the Central Railway administration gets relieved from its duties by declaring such incidents as sudden accidents.\n\nYesterday Monday morning, female passenger Riya Rajgore, resident of Dombivli, caught the local from Dombivli at 8:00 am. But due to excessive crowd in the local, she could not go inside the train, and was standing hanging at the door.\n\nAnd she fell from the train between Kopar and Diva railway stations. According to the Railway Police, he died immediately after falling from the local. The Railway Police has abdicated its duty by registering this case as an accidental accident.\n\nA similar incident happened six days ago i.e. on 23rd April, in which Awadhesh Dubey, a young man working in Mumbai after completing his MBA from IIT Patna, was traveling by morning local train from Dombivali to Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus on Tuesday. Boarded the local to. After the local Dombivali, the youth stopped at Diva station and then fell on the railway track between Mumbra and Kalwa railway station, youth Avadhesh died.\n\nAwadhesh Dubey was young, and his earning was the basis for his family. His family members are still unable to understand that,\n\nAwadhesh had boarded the local at Dombivali railway station. The local train stopped at Diva railway station, and then what happened in the train was that Awadhesh fell on the track between Mumbra and Kalwa railway station.\n\nWhen the family members of the deceased Awadhesh should get information about this from the local GRP officials, the Railway Police officials said that they did not have any information in this regard.\n\nAccording to the family members of the deceased Awadhesh, Awadhesh had a bag of his own which he kept hanging on his back. Along with this, he had his mobile and money purse while GRP told that there was no bag, mobile or money purse with the body of deceased Awadhesh. According to the relatives of the deceased, after the accident, someone stole his bag, money purse and mobile from him.\n\nBut the Railway Police did not consider the need to do any investigation in this regard and in its report had declared the deceased unclaimed with the information that no belongings were found with the deceased. But after continuous questioning and running around by his family members, they got information about the deceased Awadhesh being in Kalwa Hospital.\n\nDeepak Dubey, elder brother of the deceased Awadhesh, has complained to the higher officials of Central Railway, accusing the Railway Police of being negligent in this matter and not giving correct information and has demanded strict action against the culprits."
