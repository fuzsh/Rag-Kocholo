        "text": "Over 10 million commuters who pass through railway stations every day now have an access to fast Internet which lets them stream, research and download.\n\nNew Delhi, October 13: Indian Railways have completed the task of equipping 200 stations with free Wi-Fi service across the country. A recent tweet by the Ministry of Railways confirms the same. It says, “Free RailWire – Google super high-speed Wi-Fi service now available at 200 railway stations across India #DigitalIndiaDigitalRail”. The free Wi-Fi facility has found more takers in smaller cities as it gives the poor connectivity of high-speed broadband. As per Indian Railways, over 10 million people who pass through these railway stations every day now have an access to fast Internet which lets them stream, research and download.\n\nHighlights\n\nGoogle Wi-Fi service now available at 200 railway stations across India\n\nRailTel has taken a lead in providing fast Wi-Fi for the use of passengers\n\nGoogle’s free WiFi for over 400 Indian Railways stations is one of the biggest projects that will give a major push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Digital India’ initiative. As per Google, over five million people in the country are latching onto its free Internet service every month (about 1.7 lakh people every day). Of this, 15,000 people are accessing the Internet for the first time in their lives every day, the company said. That’s a whole lot of users.\n\nMumbai Central, a railway station in Mumbai became the first railway station in the country in January 2016 to offer free Wi-Fi facility. Railways then continued with connecting all busy stations like Bhubaneswar, Bangalore, Howrah, Kanpur, Mathura, Aligarh, Barelli and Varanasi stations with the free internet service at rail premises. The Indian Railways continued connecting other busy stations such with the free Internet service. With Larsen and Toubro, RailTel and Pune Smart City, Google brings high-speed public Wi-Fi to Pune as part of the Smart City Project.\n\nStatewise Status of Station Wi-Fi:\n\nState/UT UT Commissioned Stations Coming Soon 1.
