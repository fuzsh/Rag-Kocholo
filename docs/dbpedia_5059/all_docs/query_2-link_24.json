        "text": "UNCONTROLLED VEHICLE POPULATION & CHOCKED CITY & PEOPLE Today I came across Times of India article \"Experts worried as Mumbai's vehicle count crosses 48 lakh, 60% are two wheelers\". Do all Mumbaikar needs to worry? Yes, we must. If not, then get ready to face problem like Delhi. That's not all, it will also increase 01. Lungs related diseases for all, 02. Temperature of Mumbai, 03. Commuting time, 04. Pollution level in city, increased smog level 05. Breathing problem for citizen, 06. More risk for ailing senior citizen and infants, 07. Vehicular noise level, 08. Stress on local infrastructure, and 09. Illegal parking and Couple of years back, I had written an article on this issue. If you are interested you can refer it for more details. If you liked and found worth, share it for awareness. https://lnkd.in/dRkirj4n In this article I have valiantly mentioned about controlling vehicle population by considering following limitation 01. Total dimension (area) of city 02. Total road length and area 03. Available parking space in city residential area 04. Available parking space in city parking zone 05. Number of aged vehicle elimination from city road 06. Innovation in transport sectors and service 07. Improving current transport system 08. Creating hybrid work culture for employees 09. Vertical parking parks and facilities 10. Limiting vehicle's entry in city beyond its capacity 11. Designing real time vehicle population monitoring system 12. Developing transit zone for vehicle coming toward city I also request experts to find more effective solutions, than what mentioned above. I trust this article will reach to concern authorities and we can see some policy decision in this matter.

The recent landslide in Wayanad, Kerala is shocked entire India and me too. We lost precious lives once again. 256 people dead and 200 people missing (Ref. https://lnkd.in/d6VCUsFs). I read the report published by NRSC and ISRO. Following are the various pages in the books and its number Title page - 02 Publisher Right Page - 01 Document Control Sheet Page - 01 Message Page - 01 Forward Page - 01 Preface Page - 01 Acknowledgement Page - 01 Blank Page - 05 Table of Content Page - 01 List of Figures - 03 List of Table Page - 01 Information Page - 16 Topic Page - 04 Image Page - 45 Reference Page - 02 Bibliography - 04 This book shared data about 80000 landslides which had happened in 1998-2022. The details regarding these landslides presented in form of images. These are around 45 pages, while text information shared in 16 pages. Lots of efforts invested for drafting this book. What we want to know is reasons for these landslides. Following reasons mentioned in this book. 01. Rainfall, 02. Undercutting of slopes due to flooding or excavation 03. Earthquakes 04. Over grazing by cattle 05. Terrain cutting 06. Excessive Development and 07. Snowmelt and other natural causes As per my view, there are various reasons for such landslides. As per my understanding and view, we will witness many more such landslides and loss of life, if necessary action not taken in time. 1. Cutting trees from hill top for agriculture such as tea and coffee 2. Cutting trees from hill and hill slop for bungalow and farm houses 3. Building roads by cutting hill slope and damaging vegetation root network 4. Absence of vegetation on slope post road infrastructure development 5. Loss and damage of interconnected tap toots network 6. Monoculture tree plantation 7. Inadequate efforts of re-plantation 8. Large forest fire and loosing of base soil due to root network damage 9. Type of soil and heavy rainfall 10. Diverting forest road and diversion of river flow Like these, Natural calamities also play important role in landslide. I think, in hilly area, cutting of even single tree even from private farm, field or and land shall be completely banned / prohibited. We must stop interfering with nature and altering its natural order. As long as we keep doing such activities and harm to nature we will face such event regularly. The loss of human life is preventable but our own deliberate actions keep people dying and we do not feel remorseful about it, unfortunately.

It began as promising tool of global interaction and platform of sharing information. But every passing day, it penetrating our private life never before and causing un-restorable and irreversible havoc in individual life. All heads are down, this is common scenario everywhere. If you at home, on road, in public transport, restaurant or even at funeral. No one spared Following are the larger effects on the individual and entire society. KILL TIME AND REDUCE EFFICIENCY · Kill our precious time quickly · Affect our concentration ability · Reduces our work efficiency · Make us less productive · No new learning, no new ideas and · Mind get tired early and frequent fatigue UNSTABLE MIND AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ADDICTION · Creating uncontrolled addiction · Make one mind restless, nudge to hook to social content · Provide lots of information which one unable to absorb · Fake and real information keep mind struggling for reliability · Mind become unable to take decision · Reduce critical thinking ability and decision making · Constant validation for seeking create instability EROSION OF HEALTH AND THOUGHT DETERIORATION · Make us lonely even in large crowd · Increase feeling on loneliness and feeling of insecurity · Hi-life stories & constant comparison create sense on inadequacy develop depression · Loss of appetite, thirst, less sleep result in insomnia and heart diseases · Endless scrolling, awkward position give rise to health ailment · Give rise to anxiety and fear, strained eyes result in eyes sight and constant headache · Induce negative thoughts and give rise to criminal and careless thought process SOCIAL VALUE EROSION AND ABUSIVE POLARIZATION · Many using this as weapon to tarnish someone image and social status · Use of abusive language break someone confidence and demolish self-esteem · Uncontrolled, unrestricted, unfiltered and provoking content disturb social fabrics and relation · Polarized content divided individuals, family members, childhood friends, institutions, and professionals · Erosion of privacy, quick connection accessibility damaged social relations It is no doubt has great benefits but unchecked, uncontrolled usage pose great risk to mental, physical, social, personal relation and wellbeing of individual.

Daily basis we are sipping drop of this poison & pushing ourselves to the end of no return. We are destroying ourselves. Keep away the dazzling and glittering poison. Stay away, Stay awake and Keep “MIND and BODY SAFE” Indes Solutions\n\nINDUSTRIAL FIRE - SAFETY NO BUDGET CONSTRAINT & L1, L2, L3 Quote I managed to gather few following fire incidents occurred between January to June 2024 from Maharashtra State. 01 Jan - Fire at a gloves manufacturing factory in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. 04 Jan - Fire at Mehk Chemicals Pvt Ltd in MIDC Area of Navi Mumbai. 06 Jan - Ammonia gas leak in the storage tank caused the blast. 18 Jan - Fire Incident at Fine Chemicals, Badalapur 24 Jan - Massive Fire at Diesel Godown in Mumbai Goregaon Area 25 Jan - Fire at Asmi Industrial Complex near Ram Mandir railway station 29 Jan - A fire erupted in a factory in Navi Mumbai's MIDC area in Pawne. 02 Feb - A massive fire erupted at a factory in Maharashtra's Nashik 31 Mar - Massive Fire at Scrap Godwon in Bhiwandi 15 Mar - One worker killed in fire at chemical factory in Thane 27 Mar - Pune fire engulfs two paint companies in nasrapur industrial Zone 02 Apr - Massive fire breaks out at chemical plant in Navi Mumbai 19 Apr - Fire at a factory manufacturing plastic products in Thane 19 April - Maharashtra: Fire breaks out at chemical godown in Kalamgaon 23 Apr - S H Kelkar & Company reports fire accident at its Vashivali facility 23 May - A huge boiler blast took place in the MIDC area, in Dombivli 11 Jun - Fire at sanitary napkin factory in Bhiwandi, Thane 12 Jun - Fire at Indo-Amines, Dombivli, Thane 17 Jun - Aarti Drugs announced fire at N-198 unit located at Tarapur Many employees lost their precious life without fault, hundreds of them injured seriously and few families devastated permanently. Despite these tragic and heart-wrenching incident, 01. Many employees show irresponsible behavior at workplace, 02. Quotation and vendors are selected based on L1, L2 and L3, ignoring competency and 03. Management prefer production investment over safety needs Responsible Govt. departments taking stringent (?) action and holding occupier accountable. Their investigation will reveal the true facts but major worries about compliance of identified causes, review and tracking of the same. Safety is serious profession and responsibility. Accommodating, adjusting and tolerating with life threatening conditions at workplace is serious injustice and crime. It is also breach of trust of employees who depend on you to return home safely. Organizations, Occupiers and People's who are in responsible and decision making position must change mindset toward Safety and life protection of employees. The delay in accepting this responsibility will cost many more lives, loss of productions, paralyzed business growth and push Indian industrial Safety Culture in glacial pace. At this pace, we cannot meet global safety standards and struggle to adjust with it like today. Another decade of copy and paste will continue. Safety is Really Serious - Stay honest to your commitment. #Safety #Fire #Publicsafety #Protectlife #EHSresponsiblity #EHSaccountabiity #industrialsafety #socialsafety #safetyconsciousness\n\nGUIDELINE ON SCHOOL, CHILDREN SAFETY & SECURITY I was reading attached document about Guideline on School Safety and Security . The guideline cover almost all aspects of safety and security of school and children. It will be interesting to find out, how many parent aware of such guidelines. Like in Industrial statutory requirements, this guideline also recommends following information to be displayed on school notice board. 01. Display of School Safety and Security Plan & Classroom Safety and Security Plan 02. Display of School Safety Pledge 03. Display of child safety posters, POSCO E-Box details and Child helpline number 04. Display of Emergency medical care numbers 05. Display of School vehicle fitness certificate 06. Display of Disaster Evacuation plan 07. Display of regular mock drill details. Beside this, I strongly recommend, Ministry of Education and this Guideline shall insist on displaying 08. Name and Contact details of Fire Officer and Fire Trained Staff 09. Fire Training of Each teaching and no teaching staff 10. Display of School Building Stability Certificates, & Fire NOC details 11. Name and Contact details of First Aid Staff of school 12. Display of contact details of Fire Brigade, & Hospitals 13. Display of attached School, Children Safety and Security Guidelines Most importantly, this guideline needs to updated with \"RIGHT OF PARENT\" to assess, investigate, audit the school independently, for Safety and Security provisions of School. This will ensure transparency, trust building and adherence of these provisions by school. I urge all parents, whose children's are studying in schools and colleges, must read the Guideline on School, Children Safety and Security. You have every right to ensure whether your kid is safe at school. Your positive participation, can bring sea changes in school safety.
