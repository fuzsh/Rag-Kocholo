There are slum areas within 1.5 meters of Railway line in Sealdah South, North & Main Section. There is also dangerous encroachment in Circular Railway Line which are safety hazards for both the encroachers and Railway\n\n7.

It is apprehended this vast land belonging to the Eastern Railway property will soon be encroached by unscrupulous people . Railway authority should take proper action to prevent encroachment . more\n\nJul 10\n\nGWALIOR RAILWAY STATION STAFF QUARTER AT JIWAJIGANG CAPTERD BY LOCAL PEOPLE, more\n\nJun 25\n\nIn many european countries the railway land is not accessible by some fence. And the whole track zone is full of stone and uplifted to the rural land for stability reasons, for instant rain draining from the track zone. And this high elevated train track zone full of stone is so uncomfortable that locals won't cross the tracks; enough level crossings do the job and securised by at least red blinking lights when train is coming.... I won't say it can be immediately implicated along the many km railways in India, but at least fence should exist in urban zone along the tracks. more\n\nJun 21\n\nThe encroachment of railway land anywhere in India since been continued, supported indirectly by earlier Railway staff or the occupied persons may be relative. The honest and actual solution is to take monthly rent from them as per Govt instr / rule as stated for per Square meter rate of different cities with 11 months agreement for the great source of income of our Indian Railways. more\n\nJun 19\n\nSimply crying for population will not solve the problem, On one side we talk that one community is going to be out numbered by another minority community. Let us talk only for railway. I am of opinion that 1st Railways should start selling their used rails and Steel gauges (Steel scrap) lying every where all along rail through out India with these money only Toilets can be made better on Plate forms. more\n\nJun 18"
