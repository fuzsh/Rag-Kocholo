        "text": "WHILE I APPRICIATE THE PHOTO and that there is a certain Harmony and sync to it. I was there Multiple times since last few weeks and as a RESIDENT of Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Croporation There is a SATIS Coming up on the other side of the same FOB Where this Photo was taken and due to which the the Rickshaws are piled up here and if you have been here even in the Commotion you could simply walk by without any Hindrance by the rush and hustle of the Rickshaws SHARE AUTOS EVEN if Illegal Is a Solution that has arrived out of the need of the Population I am sure you would have also used the same at least once for whatever the reason if not the other 99% of Mumbai has. The generate recurring revenue for the Government by consuming the fuel and road way and offer customers one third the price of what they would have payed if the ride is Direct MAJORITY of a city is working class and are Hand to mouth earners Adding more busses or infra happens and take its own time such Rickshaw pooling shouldn't be Under Toned. Once the SATIS is completed Busses the commotion will be relatively lesser but still people will have Share Autos because they are quicker means of transport than a Public service that is Time bound. KINDLY acknowledge that Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Croporation is making the SATIS and is for the same reason. #KDMC #Kalyan #KalyanDombivili #dombivli My MUNICIPALITY is Doing GOOD and doing lots of work and I Appreciate that Aditya Rane and I am sure so do all of our citizens as well. And there are Many more Infrastructure work other than this that are parallelly undergoing all around Kalyan Dombivli by Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Croporation"
