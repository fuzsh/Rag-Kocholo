To be eligible for an award of contract for more than one lot, the tenderer is required to meet the sum of the qualification requirement for these lots.\n\nThe decision to consider him for award of a particular lot or combination of lots as per his eligibility will be of the employer based on overall financial advantage to the employer (Lowest cost to the employer).\n\nHowever, Tenderers should mention in the letter of tender (technical part), the order of preference of individual lots, for due consideration by the employer during tender evaluation.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe objective of the proposal is to provide a improvement with holistic planning, which allows substantial increase of station’s quality of service, in terms of comfort, facilities and pedestrian fluidity including following:\n\nFast and efficient passenger flow: To deal with the level of traffic, existing difficulties in managing passengers’ movement and dispersal.\n\nSafety and Security: To mend the decrepit structures and provide fire safety, in the station area.\n\nMaximum Passenger Convenience: To make stations equipped in terms of services, commercial facilities, amenities and waiting premises.\n\nFlexible Interiors: To take care of the fast construction, it is important to adapt the flexible/ modular interiors, so that in a short span of time, facilities can be provided.\n\nIt is planned to upgrade work consisting of provision of FOBs, elevated decks, inter connection between deck/FOBs, skywalk, relocation of service buildings, stalls, kiosks etc., improving entry/exit, improving circulating area, provision of green space, etc. at various stations of Central & Western Railways.\n\nGeneral:\n\nMumbai Railway Vikas Corporation has given consultancy contracts to M/s Intercontinental Consultants and Technocrats Pvt.

The available traffic and power blocks are limited to one to one & half hours only. All the activities above running tracks and in vicinity of track i.e., within 3.50m from the centre of tracks shall be done in these limited traffic blocks.\n\nFurther, there are a number of cables laid underground in work areas related to signalling, Power Supply, Telecom etc., entire excavation in the yards for foundation shall be done manually to avoid damages to underground utilities such as cables, water supply pipes, sewage lines etc.\n\nNo work within 2.50m from OHE wires shall be taken up without power shut down on OHE and earthing of OHE and shall be taken up only in presence of authorised competent staff of the Electrical department of MRVC/Railway.\n\nThe design and drawings of the work are developed/being developed by the consultant and approved drawings will be made available to the successful tenderer for undertaking the works on award of Tender.
