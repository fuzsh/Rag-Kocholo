        "text": "3. The Mumbai Suburban Railway is an offshoot of the first railway to be built by the British in India, and is also the oldest railway system in Asia. The first train ran between Bori Bunder (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus) and Thane, a distance of 34 km, on 16 April 1853 at 3:35 pm. The 14-coach train took 57 minutes to complete the 32 km journey, with a halt at Sion to refill the train's water tanks. Since 1991, it has faced rapid expansion. The Bombay Railway History Group has been striving to document railway heritage along this line.\n\n4. The Mumbai Suburban Railway system is operated by Indian Railways' two zonal divisions Western Railways (WR) andCentral Railways (CR). CENTRAL LINES WESTERN TRANS-HARBOUR CST – ANDHERI HARBOUR KASARA CST - KHAPOLI KARJAT CHG - VIRAR PANVEL THANE - VASHI\n\n5. Mumbai Suburban Railway services have various such designations in wide use by Mumbaikars as well as official use: Slow Semi- Fast Fast There are also women-only cars (termed ladies), and since 1992, Ladies Special trains with the entire reserved for women passengers Smart cards Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVMs) Seasional tickets (one, Qauterly semi & yearly pass)\n\n6. Train Management System (TMS) is a system implemented by Western Railway, and being implemented now by Central Railway, for integrated management and monitoring of suburban train movements and signalling, as well as planning train routes, diversions, and introduction or withdrawal of rakes in service. CR's TMS covers the major section from CST Mumbai to Kalyan, with four additional minor sections: Ambivli (Igatpuri side), Ambarnath (towards Pune beyond Kalyan), Bhiwandi Road on Vasai side beyond Dombivli, and Dativli Chord Cabin beyond Diva on Panvel side. Implementation is still in progress and is expected to be completed by 2008 or so.\n\n7. To save time, Coupon Validating Machines(CVMs) at every station… There are approximately 575 CVMs on Mumbai Suburban Railway stations. The Central Railway network has 350 and the Western Line has 225…\n\n8. Over 4,500 passengers are packed into a 9-car rake during peak hours, as against the rated carrying capacity of 1,700 Western Railway has pledged that its trains will stop running if \"even a single person\" is seen travelling on the roof. Police security in Ladies coach CCTV\n\n9. The Western and Central Railways have been using the Auxiliary Warning System (AWS), a type of Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS), since 1996.\n\n10. The Mumbai (CR) Suburban train system, operating approx. 1470 trains & handling approx. 3.5 Lakh passengers daily, is a high density, high turnaround complex network which demands extremely fast & efficient train control system.
