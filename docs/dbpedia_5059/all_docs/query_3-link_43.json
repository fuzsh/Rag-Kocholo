        "text": "The journey of K K Travels began in the year 1988 with Kedar S Kasar in the driving seat. He set out with one car but with a drive to succeed in the race.\n\nIt was a challenge to meet the requirements of the customers with just one car at the disposal. But the sincerity to serve did not go unnoticed and soon the company was associated with corporate clients.\n\nTie-ups with some esteemed multinational & large and small national companies followed and K K Travels became a force to reckon with on the road.\n\nThe Brand “K K Travels” got recognition and was further developed with sheer hard work.\n\nThe company’s cars and buses were now hired on call as well as yearly contract basis. What put it ahead in the fiercely competitive marketplace was uncompromising hard work, punctuality, safety, periodic renewal of fleet and excellent friendly back office support.\n\nIn 1995, the company rolled out air-conditioned buses for Pune – Mumbai (CSIT) airport and Pune airport transfer. The highlight of the service was residence pickup and drop within Pune City and adjoining areas.\n\nThe strategy was same; starting with a single schedule and one bus and later expanding to hourly to and fro departures between Pune and Chhatrapati Shivaji International Terminal ( Mumbai Airports )and vice versa.\n\nThe success was repeated in 2006 in Nashik city with pickup and drop facility between residence and airport. It now has daily 12 departures from both sides.\n\nThat same year in June, the company started providing a bouquet of tours and travel services that included Air Ticketing, Holiday Tours (Domestic & International), Hotel Booking, Passport & Visa Assistance; Currently run under the brand www.kktravelsonline.com.\n\nThe next year, the company shifted gears from Bus Service to Hourly Shared Cab Services for Airport transfers to meet the heavy demand for departures at shorter intervals and unfriendly traffic conditions in Pune and Mumbai Cities.\n\nThe journey so far has taken the company places with a fleet of 300 cabs and own offices in Pune, Mumbai and Nashik . All the offices are operational round-the-clock. The bookings are done online with the Pune, Mumbai and Nashik offices connected with a Server stationed in Pune.\n\nDespite the growth, the motto still remains delighting the customers on their journeys, no matter how long or short that be.\n\nIn the year 2016 , K K Travels has been granted E-recognition as a Tourist Transport Operator by Travel Trade Division, Ministry of Tourism, Government of India"
