        "text": "The actress Sophie Turner sued her husband, the musician Joe Jonas, on Thursday and requested that their two children be returned to England.\n\nThe couple announced their plan to divorce earlier this month.\n\nTurner said that Jonas had refused to give her the children’s passports, preventing them from returning to their “habitual residence” in England, according to a petition filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe children are dual citizens of the United States and Britain, according to court documents, which identified them by the initials W.R.J., born in 2020, and D.M.J., born in 2022.\n\nJeff Raymond, a representative for Jonas, said in an emailed statement that an order filed in the Florida court where the divorce proceedings were initiated restricted both parents from relocating the children. If Jonas provided Turner with the passports, the statement said, he would be violating that order.\n\n“Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also OK with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the U.K.,” the statement said. “The children were born in the U.S. and have spent the vast majority of their lives in the U.S.”\n\nTurner, who is English, and Jonas, who is American, began dating in October 2016 and married in Las Vegas in May 2019. Their marriage broke down “very suddenly,” according to Turner’s petition, which said that she learned that Jonas had filed for divorce from the news media. The statement from Jonas’s representatives denies this claim, saying that multiple conversations took place and that “Sophie was aware that Joe was going to file for divorce.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
