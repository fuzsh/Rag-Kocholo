        "text": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas have agreed to temporarily keep their two young children in New York, according to documents seen by NBC News, Sky News' US partner.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers singer filed for divorce from the Game Of Thrones star earlier this month.\n\nThe couple have agreed to an interim consent order preventing them from removing their children \"from the jurisdictions of the United States District Courts for the Southern & Eastern Districts of New York\" pending further order from the court on a petition filed by Turner on Thursday.\n\nJust weeks after news of their split became public, Turner claimed Jonas was refusing to hand over the children's passports, accusing him of \"abducting\" them and preventing them from returning to the UK.\n\nTurner's earlier court documents, filed in the Southern District of New York, said the couple's children, born in 2020 and 2022, have been wrongfully retained in New York City since 20 September from \"their habitual residence\" in England.\n\nJonas disputed that claim, adding that the Florida court where the divorce was filed \"restricts both parents from relocating the children\" and that Turner was aware of that order.\n\nHis representatives went on to say that if Jonas had handed over the children's passports it would have been \"in violation of the Florida court order\".\n\nThe children, who have dual citizenship, are currently under their father's care in New York, where they will stay until the court makes its next ruling.\n\nThe celebrity couple made England their permanent home in April, partly because of a desire to have the children educated in the country, according to court documents.\n\nClick to subscribe to Backstage wherever you get your podcasts\n\nThey also noted that due to Turner filming a new drama series in the UK in May, the children would travel with Jonas and a nanny as he began a tour with the Jonas Brothers in the US in late July.\n\nThe actress, who played Sansa Stark in Game Of Thrones, was then apparently expecting to return to the UK with the children after flying to New York in mid-September."
