        "text": "Our hearts were won over by the adorable love story of Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, one of Hollywood’s hottest couples. Their romance seemed like something out of a fairytale, from their exhilarating first encounter to their lavish wedding. Therefore, fans were shocked to learn of their divorce earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey share two daughters and have been married for almost four years. The potential conflict over custody of their children is unquestionably the most intriguing aspect of their unexpected divorce. Now, Turner, best known for playing Sansa Stark in HBO’s Game of Thrones, has initiated legal action against her estranged husband in a lawsuit that was filed in a Manhattan court on Thursday.\n\nTurner is bringing the lawsuit in an effort to demand the immediate return of her daughters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead More: “That’s terrible, he’s obviously a playboy”: Trouble in Paradise For X-Men Star Sophie Turner, Joe Jonas Gets Vile Response After Their Divorce News\n\nSophie Turner Sues Joe Jonas Over Kids’ Custody\n\nAccording to documents that PEOPLE was able to obtain, Sophie Turner filed a complaint against Joe Jonas on Thursday, demanding their daughters return to England. According to the Game of Thrones actress, Jonas, 34, “wrongfully retained” the kids and refused to give them their passports.\n\nThey allegedly decided previously that England would be the girls’ “forever home” and thus, sold their Florida residence earlier this year to make this decision, according to Turner’s complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the filing, the two parties met on September 17 to discuss the terms of their separation.\n\nHowever, in a statement given to EW, a representative for Jonas disputed Turner’s account of recent events and alleged that the Florida court handling their divorce had issued an order preventing either parent from moving the kids at this time. As per the statement:\n\n“Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the UK. The children were born in the U.S. and have spent the vast majority of their lives in the U.S. They are American citizens.”\n\nRead More: “Cheating on your soultmate is disgusting”: Joe Jonas Cheating On X-Men Star Sophie Turner With A 20-Year-Old Rumor Upsets Fans\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Jonas’s Response To Sophie Turner’s Lawsuit\n\nIn his response to Sophie Turner’s lawsuit regarding the return of their daughters to the U.K., Joe Jonas refuted her claims that she learned of their divorce from the media. He shared the following statement with ET via a representative:\n\n“After multiple conversations with Sophie, Joe initiated divorce proceedings in Florida, as Florida is the appropriate jurisdiction for the case. Sophie was aware that Joe was going to file for divorce. The Florida Court has already entered an order that restricts both parents from relocating the children. Sophie was served with this order on September 6, 2023, more than two weeks ago.”\n\nThe statement went on to add (ET):\n\n“Joe and Sophie had a cordial meeting this past Sunday in New York when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids. They have been with her since that meeting. Joe’s impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup.”\n\nAccording to the statement, less than a day after the “amicable co-parenting setup” was decided,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK. Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children’s passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately. If he complies, Joe will be in violation of the Florida Court order.”\n\nDuring an interview with Ryan Seacrest On Air With Ryan Seacrest in January of this year, Jonas revealed some rare details about the moment he proposed to Turner.\n\n“I was probably more nervous to ask her dad than I was to ask her. It just all mumbles up. You throw out there and hope that her response is good, and you look back on it, and you’re like, ‘What did I say?’ Luckily it went well.”\n\nIn 2019, Jonas and Turner got married after dating for almost three years.\n\nThe parents of two daughters, however, announced their divorce earlier this month and later confirmed it was a mutual decision via Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead More: “If you’re going to date me…”: Not MCU, X-Men Star Sophie Turner Made Joe Jonas Watch 20 Hours Worth of Movies from $9.5B Franchise if He Wanted to Marry Her"
