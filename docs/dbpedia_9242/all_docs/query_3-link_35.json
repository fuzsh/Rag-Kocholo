        "text": "Joe Jonas has fired back at Sophie Turner’s bombshell lawsuit and insisted that he did not “abduct” their two daughters.\n\nIn a statement from his rep, the Jonas Brothers band member called the lawsuit a “harsh legal position” that goes against the “amicable co-parenting setup” he believed they were working toward as recently as last Sunday when they met to discuss custody.\n\n“Less than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK. Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children’s passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately,” the rep tells Page Six.\n\nJonas’ rep also shares that the kids have been with the “Game of Thrones” alum in New York, where she was spotted with Taylor Swift, since the aforementioned meeting.\n\n“Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the US and the UK,” his rep says, noting the children were born in the US so are American citizens.\n\nHe also hit back at Turner’s claims that she found out about their divorce “through the media,” stating that she was “aware” he was going to file for dissolution following “multiple conversations.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe Miami case filing, obtained by Page Six, restricts both Jonas, 34, and Turner, 27, from relocating with their children.\n\n“This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending,” his rep continues. “When language like ‘abduction’ is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst.\n\n“The children were not abducted,” he continues.\n\nThe statement also addressed the various “disparaging” reports about Turner, such as her alleged partying contributing to their demise, amid their divorce.\n\n“Joe has already disavowed any and all statements purportedly made on his behalf that were disparaging of Sophie,” the statement continues.\n\n“They were made without his approval and are not consistent with his views.”\n\nThe rep’s statement concluded suggesting that the “X-Men: Apocalypse” star filed the lawsuit only to move their divorce proceedings to the UK and remove the children from the US “permanently.”\n\nPage Six reported Thursday that Turner filed for the return of their two kids to England after the former couple allegedly decided to make her homeland their permanent residence.\n\nShe alleged in her Manhattan lawsuit that the “Hesitate” crooner was withholding the youngsters’ passports so they couldn’t leave the country.\n\nThe duo began dating in 2016 and tied the knot in a surprise Las Vegas ceremony three years later and followed up the impromptu nuptials with an extravagant wedding in France.\n\nThe pair welcomed daughter Willa in July 2020 and a second child, whose name they have not disclosed, two years later."
