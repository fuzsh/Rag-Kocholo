He was the second child of four by his parents. Jonas and his brothers interest in music may have been inspired by their father since he was a musician and songwriter. His father was also a minister at the Assemblies of God church which resulted in Jonas and his other brothers being brought up religiously.

That same year, they had the opportunity to tour with big guys in the music industry like Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, Jump5, The Click Five and the Backstreet Boys. All this while, they were working on their debut studio album. I the latter part of 2015, Jonas Brothers released the single Mandy.\n\nHowever, their much-awaited album delayed due to managerial changes and structuring of Sony, the parent company of Columbia. To keep them active, the band was involved in Disney Channel linked soundtracks and rolled on tour with Aly & J. Eventually the band released its debut album It was About Time on August 8, 2006. However, with a declined interest in the band, Columbia records did push the album resulting in the release of 50,000 copies and later a total sale of 67,000 in the US. The Jonas Brothers were dropped from the Columbia label in 2007. The band signed a contract with Hollywood Records to release their second album.
