        "text": "What Is Joe Jonas' Net Worth?\n\nJoe Jonas is an American musician and actor who has a net worth of $50 million. Joe Jonas first rose to prominence as a member of the Jonas Brothers, a pop-rock band formed with his brothers Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas. The band gained a massive following with their energetic music and charismatic performances, becoming one of the most popular teen icons of the 2000s. Their albums, including \"A Little Bit Longer\" and \"Lines, Vines and Trying Times,\" were commercial successes, solidifying their place in the pop music landscape.\n\nJoe Jonas has also carved out a nice career away from his brothers. He released a solo album, \"Fastlife,\" in 2011, showcasing his versatility as an artist. The album ventured into more mature themes and a different sound, demonstrating his ability to evolve as a musician. Joe is also the founding member of the band DNCE, which had a massive hit with the single \"Cake by the Ocean\" in 2015.\n\nHe has appeared in various Disney Channel movies and TV shows, most notably \"Camp Rock\" and its sequel, where he played a lead role alongside Demi Lovato. These roles expanded his reach to a broader audience and added to his multi-faceted career.\n\nHis reformation of the Jonas Brothers in 2019, leading to the release of their album \"Happiness Begins,\" marked a successful comeback, showing his enduring appeal in the entertainment industry.\n\nOutside of music and acting, Joe is notable for his marriage to actress Sophie Turner. They married in 2019, and she filed for divorce in 2023. They have two children together.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJoe Jonas was born Joseph Adam Jonas on August 15, 1989, in Casa Grande, Arizona. He is the son of Denise, a sign language teacher and singer, and Paul Kevin Jonas. His father is also a songwriter, musician, and former ordained minister at an Assemblies of God Church. Joe's brothers, Kevin, Nick, and Frankie Jonas are also musicians.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers and Musical Career\n\nIn 2005, Joe teamed up with brothers Kevin and Nick to record \"Please Be Mine,\" their first recorded song. Upon hearing the song, the president of Columbia Records, Steve Greenberg, signed them as a group. They decided to name their group the Jonas Brothers after briefly considering the group name Sons of Jonas. While they worked on their debut album, the Jonas Brothers toured throughout 2005 with acts such as Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, and the Click Five, among many others. Their debut single, \"Mandy\", was released in 2005. During this time, the group began making appearances on Disney Channel soundtracks and toured with the pop duo Aly and AJ.\n\nThe group released their first album, \"It's About Time,\" in August 2006 before signing with Hollywood Records–the album had received little support from Columbia Records, and the label had no further interest in promoting the band. It was later revealed that they had been dropped from the label. The second single off the album, \"Year 3000,\" premiered its music video on the Disney Channel in January 2007. \"It's About Time\" went on to sell a total of 67,000 copies in the U.S.\n\nTheir second self-titled album broke into the top five on the \"Billboard\" 200 in August 2007, and their third effort, \"A Little Bit Longer,\" topped the charts. The group's single \"S.O.S\" became their first top twenty hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and sold over 1.5 million copies. Their fourth album, 2009's \"Lines, Vines, and Trying Times,\" also reached #1. Three years later, the band left their label. The Jonas Brothers confirmed they would be working on their fifth studio album and an upcoming tour in April 2013. The band ultimately canceled that album and their upcoming tour just days before it was slated to start on October 9, 2013. Days later, it was confirmed that the band had officially broken up. They cited \"a deep rift within the band over creative differences.\" Ten years later, in June 2019, the band reunited and released their fifth studio album, \"Happiness Begins.\" It debuted at the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 list.\n\nWhile with the Jonas Brothers, Joe tried his hand at a solo career, with his debut album \"Fastlife\" reaching #15 on the charts. In 2011, he joined Britney Spears on her European tour. After the breakup of the band, Jonas began working on a new musical project with producers Malay and Mattman & Robin. From 2015 to 2017, Joe was a founding member of the pop band DNCE, which had a huge hit with the song \"Cake by the Ocean\" in September 2015. In 2018, Jonas joined the Australian cast of \"The Voice\" as a coach. He had served as a mentor on the American version of the show the year before. In June 2018, Jonas and DJ Jonas Blue released their collaborative song \"I See Love\", for the soundtrack fo the film \"Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation.\"\n\nActing Career\n\nIn 2008, Jonas and his brothers began starring in their own Disney series \"Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream.\" Joe and his brothers made their film debut in Disney Channel's \"Camp Rock\" in 2008. The Jonas Brothers starred in their second Disney series \"Jonas\", which premiered in May 2009. It lasted for two seasons. Joe guest starred in an episode of \"Hot in Cleveland\" in 2010. He and his brothers have appeared in several other movies and TV shows, including \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,\" \"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,\" and \"Hannah Montana.\"\n\nPersonal Life/Relationships\n\nJoe's love life has been the subject of a media frenzy more than once. He dated AJ Michalka for a year after the group went on tour with Aly & AJ in late 2005. He made headlines for his volatile relationship with country music star Taylor Swift and is said to be the subject of several of her breakup songs, even though they were together for just three short months. Jonas dated singer Demi Lovato from 2008 to 2010. From 2012 to 2014, he dated graphic designer Blanda Eggenschwiler. He dated Gigi Hadid for several months in 2015–she co-directed DNCE's \"Cake by the Ocean\" music video.\n\nJoe began dating actress Sophie Turner in 2016. They became engaged in 2017. They married in May 2019 in Las Vegas and had a second wedding in June 2019 in Paris. They have two children together. Jonas and Turner filed for divorce in September 2023.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2016, Joe spent $3.7 million to acquire a brand new home in Sherman Oaks, California. In 2013, he purchased a house just off the Sunset Strip in Hollywood for $3.2 million. He sold that house for a $200k profit.\n\nIn March 2019, a still single Joe paid $5.6 million for a condo in Manhattan. He listed this unit for sale in mid-2020 for $6 million, didn't accept any offers, and re-listed it in November 2023 for $6 million. Here is a video tour:\n\nIn November 2019, Joe and Sophie spent $14.1 million on a new mansion in Encino, California. They listed this home for sale in June 2021 for $16.75 million. In October 2021, Joe and Sophie sold the house to DJ Zedd for $15.2 million.\n\nIn September 2021, Joe and Sophie paid $11 million for a mansion in Miami. The 10,400 square-foot waterfront home has a gym, pool, spa, sauna, and a dock out front to park a yacht. In November 2022, Joe and Sophie listed their Miami mansion for a little under $17 million. They accepted $15 million in August 2023.\n\nBelow is a video tour of the Miami mansion from around the time they purchased it in 2021. In the year or so that they owned the property, they painted the exterior and re-did the interior design:"
