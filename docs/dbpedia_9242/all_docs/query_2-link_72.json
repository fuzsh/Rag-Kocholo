        "text": "News of Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s divorce shocked the world, but who are their children, how old are they and what are their names?\n\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner are officially getting a divorce, confirming their separation in a statement after the Jonas Brothers singer was pictured without his wedding ring on a few recent outings.\n\nOn 5th September TMZ confirmed Joe has officially filed for divorce from Sophie, four years after their beautiful, fairytale wedding in France and one year after they welcomed their second child together.\n\nThe publication claimed the stars have been ‘having problems’ for around six months, although they have attended events together. On 14th August, Sophie posted a carousel of adorable photos of them together after watching the Jonas Brothers perform in New York.\n\nJoe and Sophie have since issued a statement on their split, confirming their decision to end their marriage was an amicable one.\n\nREAD MORE: Is Joe Jonas Dating Stormi Bree After Sophie Turner Split?\n\nREAD MORE: Jonas Brothers’ Wives And Kids: From When They Married To How Old Their Babies Are\n\nThe couple have two children together; Willa, who was born in 2020 and a second daughter who arrived in 2022, whose name has recently been revealed as Delphine. While they don’t often share much of their private life, they have opened up about their adorable family on a few rare occasions.\n\nNaturally, fans of the talented couple are heartbroken about the news of their split.\n\nBut who are Joe and Sophie’s children, when were they born and what are their names?\n\nHow many children do Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner have?\n\nJoe and Sophie have two children together, two daughters. Their firstborn arrived in July 2020 a year after they got married and their second was born in July 2022.\n\nThey kept both pregnancies mostly out of the limelight, only confirming their baby news first time around after Willa was born. Sophie later had a small ‘W’ tattooed on her wrist dedicated to her daughter.\n\nWith their second baby, Sophie confirmed the news in her interview with Elle UK. She told the magazine: “It's what life is about for me — raising the next generation. The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We're so excited to be expanding the family. It's the best blessing ever.\"\n\nThey confirmed the birth of their second baby on 14th July 2022, with Joe posting a cute tribute to his wife on Instagram a few days later, including pictures of her baby bump and throwbacks to their wedding.\n\nWhat are Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s kids called?\n\nJoe and Sophie’s oldest daughter is called Willa, which means ‘resolute protection’. It also holds a connection to Game of Thrones, the show Sophie starred in as Sansa Stark for eight years.\n\nTwo characters appeared throughout the show with the name Willa, including one who appeared twice in season five as a wilding. The other character called Willa appeared during season eight, as a servant in Winterfell whose allegiance was to House Stark. According to Nameberry, Willa originates from a short form of Wilhelmina, and its origin is from old German culture.\n\nThe couple have been secretive over the name of their second daughter, however legal papers surrounding their divorce has revealed her name as Delphine.\n\nHave Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner split?\n\nJoe and Sophie have officially separated after Joe filed for divorce in LA, TMZ reported. Their reasons for splitting aren't publicly known but it's been reported their 'different lifestyles' could be to blame.\n\nAs the speculation emerged, fans noticed Joe hasn't been wearing his wedding ring as often and was papped without it on a coffee run in New York days before filing for divorce."
