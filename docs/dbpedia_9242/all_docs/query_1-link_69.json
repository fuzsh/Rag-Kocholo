        "text": "Consisting of Joseph Jonas (Joe Jonas), Paul Kevin Jonas (Kevin Jonas), and Nicholas Jonas (Nick Jonas), the Jonas Brothers are an American pop-rock band that enjoyed extreme popularity in the 2000s. The band’s style was known to be catchy and upbeat.\n\nThe family hails from Wyckoff, New Jersey originally. Kevin Jonas was born in New Jersey, but Nick and Joe were born in Texas and Arizona. They were raised in a Christian home as their father was a preacher. After being diagnosed very young, Nick has been an ardent supporter of diabetes awareness. But that didn’t stop his noted flair for singing, and he began working on Broadway and as a solo performer before being signed by Columbia. Nick’s interest in singing led to him writing a Christmas song alongside his father in 2002.\n\nTheir acting debut came as part of the Disney Channel hit show ‘Hannah Montana’. After signing Nick, Colombia records would also sign Kevin and Joe. From 2005 they performed as a trio. Nick Jonas is the lead vocalist and plays rhythm guitar, drum and piano. Kevin Jonas plays the piano and is responsible for backing vocals, while Joe Jonas plays the keyboard and percussions and is a vocalist. Several successful collaborations took place with Miley Cyrus (as Hannah Montana and herself) between 2005 and 2008. They also appeared alongside her for her ‘Best of Both worlds’ tour.\n\nThe trio started strong, performing opening acts on tour for Kelly Clarkson and the Backstreet Boys in 2005. In 2006 they ranked 91 on the Billboard with their debut ‘It’s About Time. Initially, they performed under the name ‘Sons Of Jonas’ though this would later become ‘The Jonas Brothers’. After being dropped by Columbia Records in 2007, they were signed by Hollywood Records – a Disney-owned label.\n\nIn addition to performances, they also made several TV appearances, including starring as a group of spies in a hit TV series titled ”J.O.N.A.S.” later in 2007, solidifying their popularity among teenagers. Around this time, they also featured in a reality TV show called ‘Jonas Brothers: Living the dream,’ which portrayed their journey on the road. Around 9 million people tuned in to watch the movie, and it also featured the Jonas Brothers’ next single – ‘Burnin’ Up .’ Their presence was further heightened when they featured in Camp Rock alongside big Disney stars such as Demi Lovato and Meaghen Martin Tees.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers famously collaborated with Taylor Swift in 2008 on her song ‘Should’ve Said No.’ They would tour and release a fourth studio album ‘Lines Vines and Trying Times’ in 2009. The album would go platinum and become their second chart hit.\n\nAs of 2013, the brothers had sold over 17 million albums. Despite reaching great heights, the brothers decided to part ways. In March of 2019, they came back with ‘Sucker.’ the song became the 34th song to ever debut at number one on the Billboard hot 100 and became the first number-one single of the Jonas Brothers. Their fifth studio album, ‘Happiness Begins’ topped the US billboard 200. The brothers are currently touring the U.S.A. and Mexico.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers also have an excellent track record for philanthropy. The brothers earned approximately 12 million in 2007 and donated a whopping 10% of this to the Change For the Children Foundation. This foundation, set up by the brothers, donates to key foundations such as Nothing but Nets, the American Diabetes Foundation, and Summer Stars Camp for the performing arts. Nick Jonas also used his fame to testify in the US senate to promote additional funding for the disease. As recently as August 2021, the Jonas Brothers partnered with Feeding America to promote donations to the organization by hosting a competition for a fan to be selected to dine with the brothers at an LA restaurant.\n\nPopular Jonas Brothers trademarks\n\nTrademark registration allows you to protect your intellectual property, which can be worth more than physical property.
