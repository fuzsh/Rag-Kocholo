        "text": "''I'm definitely the guy that people assume is constantly bouncing off the walls. It's true that's me a lot of the time - I am definitely energetic. I love to 'be goofy and have a good time, but I also have a serious and more sensitive side that I don't always get to show onstage. A good friend once came to the studio while we were recording who seemed genuinely perplexed by my quiet demeanor. She said she expected me to be a lot livelier than I was and kept asking if something was wrong. I found myself explaining to her that I wasn't always the crazy guy she sees. Okay, ninety percent of the time I am, but for whatever reason, that other ten percent is a shocker! My brothers often tell me that I have the biggest heart in the world. That makes me feel really good because I genuinely care about my family, friends and loved ones. I also care about the fans who come to see us. I want to make sure they have a good time, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make their experience unforgettable.-Joe.''\n\nJoe Jonas (born August 15, 1989)[1] is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He rose to fame as a member of the pop rock band the Jonas Brothers, alongside his brothers Kevin and Nick. The group released their debut studio album It's About Time through the Columbia label in 2006, which failed to achieve commercial success. After signing with Hollywood Records, the group released their self-titled second studio album in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the Disney Channel during this time, gaining a large following through the network: they appeared in the widely successful musical television film Camp Rock (2008) and its sequel Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010) as well as two of their own series, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream (2008–2010) and Jonas (2009–2010).\n\nThe band's third studio album, A Little Bit Longer (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single \"Burnin' Up\" hit the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Their fourth studio album, while still successful on the Billboard 200 chart, saw a decline in record sales. After the group confirmed a hiatus, Joe released his debut solo studio album, Fastlife (2011), which saw moderate commercial success. After the Jonas Brothers officially parted ways due to creative differences, Jonas formed the funk-pop band DNCE in 2015, serving as the lead vocalist. The group saw the significant commercial success of their debut single \"Cake by the Ocean\", which peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nJoseph Adam Jonas was born in Casa Grande, Arizona, on August 15, 1989. He is the son of Denise (née Miller) and Paul Kevin Jonas. Jonas' father is a songwriter, musician, and former ordained minister at an Assemblies of God church while his mother is a former sign language teacher and singer. Joe has an older brother, Kevin Jonas, and two younger brothers - Nick Jonas and Frankie Jonas.\n\nCareer[]\n\n2005–2007: Breakthrough with Jonas Brothers[]\n\nIn 2005, Joe, Kevin, and Nick recorded \"Please Be Mine\", their first song recorded. Upon hearing the song, the Columbia Records president Steve Greenberg decided to sign the brothers as a group. They considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name Jonas Brothers. While working on their debut studio album, the band toured throughout 2005 with artists such as Jump5, Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, the Backstreet Boys, and The Click Five among others. The group released their debut single, \"Mandy\", in December 2005. The album was initially scheduled for a February 2006 release date, though executive changes at Columbia's parent company Sony led to numerous delays on the project's release. During this time, the group began making appearances on various Disney Channel related soundtracks and toured with Aly & AJ throughout 2006. The band's debut album, It's About Time (2006), was released on August 8, 2006. The album received little backing from the label, who had no further interest in promoting the band. During its initial run, the album only received a limited release of 50,000 copies. The album's second single, \"Year 3000\", had its music video premiere on the Disney Channel in the beginning of 2007. Dissatisfied with how the release of the record was handled, the band hoped to depart from Columbia Records and find a new label; it was later confirmed in 2007 that the group had been dropped by the label. The album went on to sell a total of 67,000 copies in the United States. Only a short period of time after their departure from Columbia Records, it was confirmed that the group had signed a new contract with Hollywood Records. While working on their new album, the group continued to gain popularity due to soundtrack appearances and promotional appearances. The group released their self-titled second studio album through Hollywood Records on August 7, 2007. The album entered the top five of the Billboard 200 in the United States, going on to sell over two million copies in the country. Joe and his brothers made their acting debut on an August 17 episode of the Disney series Hannah Montana titled \"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\". The band performed the collaboration \"We Got the Party\" with lead actress Miley Cyrus, with the episode gaining over ten million viewers and became basic cable's most watched series telecast ever. The group's single \"S.O.S\" became their first top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and has sold over 1.5 million copies in the country.\n\n2008–2010: Acting[]\n\nIn May 2008, he and the band began starring in their own Disney series Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream. Jonas made his film debut along with his brothers in the Disney Channel film Camp Rock (2008). The film's soundtrack was released on July 17, 2008, and sold 188,000 copies in its first week of release in the United States. Joe recorded the duet \"This Is Me\" for the project, with the song reaching the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song served as Jonas' first release outside of the Jonas Brothers. It has sold just over 900,000 copies in the United States. The Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008. The album became their first to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling over 525,000 copies in its first week of release. The album went on to sell over two million copies in the United States, making it their second multi-platinum album. The album was preceded by the release of the single \"Burnin' Up\" (2008), which became the band's first top five hit in the United States. Joe and his brothers starred in the 3D biopic Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience, which received a theatrical release on February 27, 2009.

The project debuted at the top spot on the Billboard 200, boasting first week sales of 247,000 copies. The album failed to match the hype of their previous efforts, failing to cross the one million copies mark in the United States. Joe was featured as a guest judge on a January 2010 episode of the ninth season of the singing competition American Idol. In February 2010, Jonas made a cameo appearance in Vampire Weekend's music video for \"Giving Up the Gun\" along with Jake Gyllenhaal, Lil Jon, and RZA. He later guest starred in a 2010 episode of Hot In Cleveland as Valerie Bertinelli's son, Will. Jonas starred in the sequel Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\n\n2011–2014: Fastlife and group disbandment[]\n\nIn 2011, it was announced that Jonas was planning on recording a solo album. Jonas hoped to incorporate elements of funk into the album, though was pressured by Hollywood Records to make a more R&B influenced album similar to releases from Justin Timberlake. Jonas released the album's lead single, titled \"See No More\", on June 3, 2011. The single failed to have much commercial success, only reaching ninety-two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. On August 4, 2011, Jonas announced via Twitter that he would join Britney Spears on her European tour starting October 16, 2011.
