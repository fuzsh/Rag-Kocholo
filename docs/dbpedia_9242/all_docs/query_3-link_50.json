        "text": "Joe Jonas has been stealing hearts alongside his brothers Nick and Kevin since 2005. While most of his fame and money have come from his work with their family band, Jonas Brothers, Joe has also found success in a solo career, which contributed to his huge net worth.\n\nWhat Is Joe Jonas’ Net Worth?\n\nJoe Jonas has a net worth of $50 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nHow Does Joe Jonas Make Money?\n\nJoe and his brothers broke out onto the music scene in 2005 as a band and quickly became teen sensations. Their early- to mid-2000s hits include “Burnin’ Up,” “S.O.S.,” “Love Bug,” “Year 3000” and many more. The band’s debut album, “It’s About Time,” sold 67,000 copies in the U.S., as CNW notes.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers shocked their fan base with the news of their breakup in October 2013, citing “a deep rift within the band over creative differences” as the reason for their split.\n\nAfter his first solo album, Fastlife, saw moderate success in 2011, Joe founded another band called DNCE in 2015 alongside Jack Lawless, JinJoo Lee and Cole Whittle. Together, DNCE released the hit “Cake By the Ocean,” which reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Adult Top 40 chart in the U.S. and became an international success.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers announced their reunion in 2019 alongside the news of their fifth album, Happiness Begins, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 list. Kevin, Joe and Nick also starred in a documentary about their reconciliation, titled Chasing Happiness. The Jonas Brothers have since released their sixth album, titled The Album, and are currently on the “Five Albums. One Night.” tour.\n\nIn addition to his work with the Jonas Brothers and DNCE, Joe has dabbled in television, having starred alongside Nick and Kevin on the Disney Channel show Jonas and the Camp Rock movies. He was also a coach on The Voice Australia.\n\nAre Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner Getting Divorced?\n\nJoe filed for divorce from his wife, Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner, on September 5, 2023, after four years of marriage, according to court records viewed by In Touch. The Jonas Brothers rocker filed paperwork in Miami-Dade County, citing that their marriage was “irretrievably broken,” according to multiple reports.\n\nThe filing came two days after reports surfaced on September 3 that their marriage was in trouble and Joe secured a divorce attorney in preparation to file.\n\nOn September 3, 2023, multiple outlets reported that Joe and Sophie had been having problems for months and were heading for divorce.. The singer has reportedly been in contact with multiple divorce attorneys in Los Angeles in preparation to file.\n\nIn Touch first reported in June 2023 that the couple, who share two daughters, had reached a “crossroads” in their relationship.\n\n“Things are tense between them,” a source told In Touch at the time. “The two have a lot on their plate right now. … It’s not surprising that there’s tension between them. But they love each other, so whatever it is they’re going through, their friends and family are confident the two will work it all out.”\n\nJust two weeks after Joe’s filing, Sophie filed documents in New York City suing her estranged husband after she claims he “wrongfully retained” their daughters in the States. According to the September 20 filing, which was viewed by In Touch, Sophie alleged that the family had been residing in the U.K. prior to their split.\n\n“The Father has possession of the children’s passports,” according to the document. “He refuses to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother.”\n\nJoe’s rep fired back, releasing a statement saying, “The children were not abducted.”\n\n“After being in Joe’s care for the past three months at the agreement of both parties, the children are currently with their mother,” the statement read. “Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the U.K. and to remove the children from the U.S. permanently.”"
