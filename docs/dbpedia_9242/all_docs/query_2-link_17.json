        "text": "Joseph Adam Jonas, popularly known as Joe Jonas, is a well-known singer and actor, who rose to fame as a member of the pop-rock band Jonas Brothers. He is also known for his roles in a few original movies and TV shows on the Disney Channel. Along with his brothers, Paul Kevin Jonas II and Nicholas ‘Nick’ Jerry Jonas, he formed the Jonas Brothers band in 2005. After gaining some popularity through music, they became even more famous through some of their appearances on the Disney Channel TV Network. They starred in Camp Rock, a Disney Channel Original Movie, in 2008, as well as its sequel Camp Rock 2. The band is also known for its philanthropic activities. After having earned an estimated $12 million in 2007, they donated 10% of it to Change for the Children Foundation. The group has received several prestigious awards, such as American Music Awards and Billboard Music Awards. Joe Jonas also released a solo album, which was named Fastlife, in 2011. It was a moderate commercial success. Though it stood at number 15 on the US Billboard 200 in its first week of release, it soon fell off the chart. After the break-up of the Jonas Brothers in the 2010s, Joe formed a new band named DNCE, which released its first single Cake by the Ocean in 2015. In 2019, the Jonas Brothers made a comeback and released their fifth studio album Happiness Begins, which topped the US Billboard 200."
