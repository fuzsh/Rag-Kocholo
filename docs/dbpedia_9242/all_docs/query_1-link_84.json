        "text": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are officially parting ways. The couple's split made international headlines after Jonas filed for divorce from his wife of four years on September 5, 2023.\n\nThe musician and actor married in 2019 and have two young children together; while they've kept their relationship fairly private throughout the years — the name of their second child was only revealed to the public thanks to their custody proceedings and court documents — the couple has given us momentary glimpses into their happier moments. Turner even once appeared in a Jonas Brothers music video with her sisters-in-law.\n\nBelow, dive into the former couple's complete relationship timeline, from the Instagram DM that started it all to their spontaneous Vegas wedding to the start of their family, and… their divorce.\n\nMarch 19, 2024: Turner asks a judge to “reactivate” the divorce case.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by People, Sophie Turner wants to \"reactivate\" her divorce case with Joe Jonas — and her legal team has already filed a formal petition to do so with a judge.\n\nOn March 19, 2024, People reported that Turner's lawyers filed paperwork in Miami-Dade County, Florida, where Jonas reportedly first filed for a dissolution of marriage in September 2013, stating that “the abatement has come to an end, and this case is to be reactivated.”\n\nThe abatement refers to the interim custody agreement the former couple reached in late 2023, which had January 7, 2024, as its end date. The agreement allowed Turner and Jonas's two children to travel freely between the United States and the United Kingdom, with the latter being their permanent residence.\n\nAfter People broke the news, a representative for Joe Jonas added that “the filing was a legal formality, and the couple continues to negotiate an amicable resolution.” Looks like custody battles are not over for these two.\n\nOctober 28, 2023: Turner is seen kissing a new man in Paris.\n\nIt seems as though Turner is ready to leave the past in the past. On October 28, the actor was spotted kissing British aristocrat Peregrine Pearson while in Paris for the Rugby World Cup finals. According to The Sun, the two were laughing and chatting before Pearson removed his hat and planted a big kiss on Turner before they drove away in separate cars, though the two were also seen together at the event.\n\nAs noted by People, Pearson belongs to one of Britain's wealthiest families and is heir to the 16,500 acre Cowdray Estate in West Sussex. He previously dated Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Denmark from 2020 to 2023. Soon after Turner was spotted kissing Pearson, The Daily Mail reported that Joe Jonas feels she's moving on “too soon.”\n\n“What is important for Joe is the well-being of his kids and finishing the tour he is on with his brothers,” a source told the British outlet. “If Sophie wants to gallivant and kiss whomever in public, he doesn't really want to play those games… Granted it feels a little too soon, he has no control over what she does and can only try to figure out the best co-parenting agenda for them both.”\n\nOctober 11, 2023: Jonas and Turner come to a new interim custody agreement.\n\nAfter “successful” mediation sessions, Turner and Jonas came to a temporary agreement regarding custody of their two daughters, 3-year-old Willa and 15-month-old Delphine. The former couple has worked out arrangements through early 2024; they're required to share further plans with the courts by December 23.\n\n\"After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the UK. We look forward to being great co-parents,\" Turner and Jonas said in a joint statement, their first since they announced their divorce together back in September.\n\nThe children will spend time with either parent for a predetermined period of time, after which they'll be returned to the other parent by either Turner or Jonas themselves or their nanny. The children are allowed to travel with their parent during their custody period, so the children can fly to the U.K. with Turner if needed. Jonas will be with them for Thanksgiving, and Turner will have them for the December holidays up until the January 7, 2024 end date. Has their custody battle come to an end? Not quite, but it seems as though they're on the path to an arrangement that works for everyone.\n\nOctober 4, 2023: Jonas skips out on court date.\n\nA Manhattan judge ruled on October 3 that Jonas and Turner's ongoing custody battle is set to go to trial. The judge set the trial date for January 2, 2024; As noted by ET, Turner appeared at the hearing virtually while Jonas was not present.\n\nAccording to ET, there was some back and forth between the former couple's attorneys; Turner's team wants the date moved up so she can get back to work in the U.K., while Jonas's team wants it pushed back to accommodate the Jonas Brothers tour and an in-person divorce hearing on Dec. 14. Jonas's lawyers shared that they expect the trial to last at least four days and have witnesses prepared.\n\nTurner and Jonas are also attending mediation sessions during their custody dispute, reports People. The four-day mediation begins Oct. 4, and Turner's lawyer Stephen Cullen shared that Jonas is hoping for joint custody of the girls. These sessions should hopefully help the former couple work out custody arrangements and a “parenting plan” until the January trial date. \"The parties are both seeing their children, which is what we all want,\" Cullen said.\n\nSeptember 25, 2023: Turner and Jonas reach a custody agreement.\n\nAfter a few days of back-and-forth statements, the former couple reached an agreement regarding custody of their two young daughters. As noted by People, Jonas and Turner are now required to keep the children in New York until further custody rules can be worked out.\n\n\"The parties have agreed to the entry of the attached proposed Interim Consent Order, without prejudice to either party's claims and defenses, prohibiting the removal of the parties' children from the jurisdictions of the United States District Courts for the Southern & Eastern Districts of New York pending further order of this Court,\" the official court docs state.\n\nIf Jonas or Turner were to violate said order and remove the girls from the approved areas, then the courts would consider that \"cause to be taken measures under Federal or State law, as appropriate, to protect the well-being of the child involved or to prevent the child's further removal or concealment before the final disposition of the petition.\" While the order is temporary, both parties have agreed to the terms.\n\nSeptember 21, 2023: Jonas disputes claims made in Turner's lawsuit.\n\nShortly after Turner's lawsuit details went public — barely two hours later — Jonas fired back with a statement of his own. According to the musician, allowing the children to go back to England would be in direct violation of a Florida court order.\n\n“After multiple conversations with Sophie, Joe initiated divorce proceedings in Florida, as Florida is the appropriate jurisdiction for the case. Sophie was aware that Joe was going to file for divorce,” the statement reads, per TMZ. “The Florida Court has already entered an order that restricts both parents from relocating the children. Sophie was served with this order on September 6, 2023, more than two weeks ago.”\n\nJonas's statement also says that if Turner moves to England for good, his wish is that the two work out a co-parenting arrangement that allows the children to live both in the United States and United Kingdom. “Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the U.K.,” says the statement. \"The children were born in the U.S. and have spent the vast majority of their lives in the U.S. They are American citizens.\"\n\nThe musician also claimed that he and Sophie had had a “cordial” meeting about the children and assumed they were on the same page, but 24 hours later, she demanded their passports — which Jonas claims is a violation of the court order.\n\n\"This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending. When language like ‘abduction’ is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst. The children were not abducted,\" his statement reads. \"After being in Joe's care for the past three months at the agreement of both parties, the children are currently with their mother. Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the UK and to remove the children from the U.S. permanently.\"\n\nSeptember 21, 2023: Turner sues Jonas for the “immediate return” of their children to England.\n\nIn an explosive development of events, Turner has filed a lawsuit against Jonas for the “the immediate return of children wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained.” According to Turner, she and Jonas had agreed to make England their family home in late 2022 and were living there in spring 2023, where she was busy filming the miniseries Joan, and Jonas kept the children during that time while on tour despite “hesitation” from Turner about the “temporary” arrangement.\n\nTurner's filing, per People, claims that they had agreed she would return for their two daughters after filming wrapped and return to London, but Jonas now refuses to hand over their passports. “The Father has possession of the children’s passports. He refuses to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother,” the documents state. Turner reports that Jonas's legal team told her legal team that he would not allow the children to return to London with her.\n\nTurner also alleges that she, like the rest of us, found out about the divorce filing in the news (\"from the media\") and that the entire unraveling of their relationship happened “very suddenly\" following an argument on August 15. Yikes.\n\nSeptember 7, 2023: Jonas and Turner reportedly faced “challenges” after their second child was born.\n\nOn September 7, TMZ published new reports that following the birth of Jonas and Turner's second baby girl in July, Turner was “struggling” and “didn't want to leave their home” or “be photographed or go to events.” Sources who were around Jonas told TMZ that he was “less than supportive” towards Turner during this time, and claims he publicly “complained” about her absence at social events. The outlet alleges the couple had faced “challenges in the relationship\" for the last six months, and their “different lifestyles” were swapped — Turner reportedly went from frequently “partying” to staying at home and Jonas went from staying at home to being very social.\n\nHowever, fans have resurfaced past comments from Turner that suggest she was never the biggest partier. In 2020, Turner told Conan O'Brien in a virtual interview that she was “loving” quarantine because she's an “introvert.” “I'm a homebody… if I could stay home all day, I would, so this is great for me,\" she said at the time. “Everything seems to be working out in my favor here… because Joe's a real social butterfly so I struggle to lock him down and have him just spend time with me. It's like prison for him, but it's great for me.”\n\nSeptember 6, 2023: Jonas performs in Arizona without his wedding ring.\n\nThe Las Vegas wedding was only a teaser. The couple tied the knot again at the Château de Tourreau in France, and their dog Porky wore a teeny tux to serve as a groomsman.\n\nMay 2019: Turner reveals she and Jonas once broke up for 24 hours.\n\nTurner shared the bombshell news that she and Jonas had actually split for a very brief period of time — exactly one day. “It was the worst day of our lives,” she told the UK Times. “For a second, we both had cold feet, then we were both like, ‘Never mind.’” The actor also shared that the two prioritized their happiness despite the constant media attention and paparazzi.\n\n“Happiness has just trumped it all,\" she shared. \"You want to be normal, go out without the fear of people hounding you, but if I'm happy then I'm not going to give that up to be private.\" She added that Jonas was an important guiding force in loving herself and finding true happiness. “He was like, ‘I can't be with you until you love yourself. I can't see you love me more than you love yourself.’ That was something, him doing that. I think he kind of saved my life, in a way.\"\n\nMay 2019: Jonas and Turner attend their first Met Gala as newlyweds.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Jonas attended the 2019 Met Gala as a newlywed couple in vibrant black and red outfits, with Turner wearing a sequined Louis Vuitton look and bright blue eyeshadow and Jonas in a colorful turtleneck. It was shortly after their Las Vegas wedding, though the couple would formally tie the knot later in France.\n\nMay 2019: Turner and Jonas get married in Las Vegas.\n\nThe celeb couple first tied the knot in Las Vegas in May 2019 — right after the Billboard Music Awards — with their friend Diplo live-streaming the unconventional Elvis-helmed ceremony. Brothers Nick and Kevin served as groomsmen, with Priyanka Chopra on bridesmaid duties for Turner. Turner wore a white jumpsuit and Jonas donned a tan suit for the seemingly impromptu occasion. Later, Turner shared some super fun never-before-seen pics from the event and it still looks like the most fun party ever.\n\nApril 2019: Turner reveals that Jonas slid into her DMs.\n\nThese days, so many great modern love stories begin with a slide into the DMs, and this includes Jonas and Turner's tale. Shortly before their Vegas wedding, Turner revealed that it all started with an Instagram message. \"We had a lot of mutual friends, and they’d been trying to introduce us for a long time. We were following each other on Instagram and he direct-messaged me one fine day, out of the blue,\" she explained. And the rest is history.\n\nOctober 2018: Turner and Jonas get matching tattoos.\n\nThe pair cemented their love with a set of matching Toy Story-themed tattoos, with Jonas sporting “To infinity” on his wrist and Turner choosing “and beyond” on hers, a reference to Buzz Lightyear's signature line.\n\nOctober 2018: The couple make their red carpet debut.\n\nJonas and Turner made their official red carpet debut at the Louis Vuitton show during Paris Fashion Week 2018, wearing coordinating gray outfits and holding hands while posing for pics.\n\nAt the time, Turner shared that she was in no rush to get married. \"I’m still like, 'Holy sh*t! I'm engaged,'\" she told Marie Claire. \"It's lovely to be engaged. Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person like I'd find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There's a sense of peace that comes with finding your person. But there's a drive that comes with your career.\"\n\nOctober 2017: Jonas and Turner get engaged."
