        "text": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are officially breaking up. Over the years, the pair has had a whirlwind romance—from sliding into Instagram DMs and starring in music videos together to getting married and having two kids—, but now their relationship is coming to an end after Joe filed divorce documents in September 2023. Here’s a look back at their relationship and current status mid-divorce.\n\nOctober 2016\n\nJoe and Sophie spark dating rumors after attending the same Halloween party. Joe dressed up as a Dalmatian and Sophie stepped out as a bunny.\n\nNovember 2016\n\nJoe and Sophie are spotted together at the 2016 MTV Europe Music Awards in Rotterdam. At the time, a concertgoer told Cosmopolitan.com that the pair were “inseparable at the bar” before sitting together. “They also kissed at one point.”\n\nAppearing on Live With Kelly as a guest cohost, Joe reveals his grand plans for Thanksgiving. “We’re going to pick our parents up and go skiing in Mammoth,” he said on the show.\n\nGuess who was also in Mammoth for Thanksgiving?\n\nBefore Thanksgiving weekend wraps, the rumored new couple are spotted together in Malibu for a wedding. Brother Nick’s photo-booth pics tell all:\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Joe, Sophie, and Nick’s fantastic weekend together closes on a high note: a photo with a teeny-tiny Game of Thrones fan. Aw!\n\nDecember 2016\n\nJoe flies to London to meet Sophie’s family, according to photos obtained by the Daily Mail. The group, which included Sophie’s parents and brother, had a “traditional pub lunch” in northwest London before going for a chilly stroll.\n\nTwo days later, People reports that they are “dating exclusively.” According to one source, “He was playing the field, but he really likes her and is willing to settle down for her.”\n\nJanuary 2017\n\nJoe and Sophie’s relationship is Instagram official as Joe makes his debut on her feed.\n\nAt the Golden Globes days later, Sophie gives Mario Lopez a sweet and short update on her relationship with Joe. “I’m not saying anything. I’m very happy.”\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nJoe leaves a fire emoji comment for Sophie after her appearance at the BAFTAs.\n\nMarch 2017\n\nJoe and Sophie continue the fire theme, arriving at Paris Fashion Week looking H-O-T.\n\nMay 2017\n\nJoe and Sophie attend the Met Gala but pose separately for photos. Don’t worry, the cameras caught them arriving at the after-party. Phew!\n\nIn an interview with InStyle published three days later, Sophie says she likes to “keep things pretty private” but offers this about her relationship with Joe: “I found it easier to date someone who understands the industry or is in that world. You realize that you’re not going to see each other all the time. And you don’t feel like a jerk when you’re like, ‘My publicist says I can’t do this….’”\n\nJuly 2017\n\nSpeaking with Marie Claire UK, Sophie opens up about what it’s like to date Joe. “You do feel like you’re living in a fishbowl. It’s frustrating [that] it’s the most mundane things that make the news—how boring!” She also reveals that while she’s “very happy” with the relationship, she’s not a big fan of their ship name, Jophie. “I prefer ‘Mophie,’” she said, referring to her longtime friendship with Maisie Williams. “What’s that thing they say? Relationships come and go but friendship is always there.”\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nAnd then there were three. Joe and Sophie announce on Instagram the newest addition to their “krew”: a little husky pupper named Porky Basquiat. And you bet Porky has his own Instagram account.\n\nHere are Porky and his humans out for a walk in New York City on a warm late summer day.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nJoe and Sophie announce their engagement on Instagram with matching photos and captions. Naturally, Game of Thrones fans wasted no time in reacting to the happy news.\n\nMaisie Williams, Nick Jonas, and Kevin Jonas also sent their congrats on social media. Everyone used the same gorgeous photo of the couple’s hands.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nSophie and Joe have an engagement party filled with celebrities. Apparently, the couple rented the private party room at NYC’s Mamo and E! News reported that they were joined by DNCE members, not to mention Nick Jonas, Kevin Jonas, and Danielle Jonas. Please prepare for a sh*t ton of pictures.\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nSophie’s Game of Thrones costar Maisie Williams confirms she is a bridesmaid, telling RadioTimes.com, “I’ve already got [a bridesmaid spot].” Love to hear it.\n\nMarch 2018\n\nSophie and Joe lowkey get matching tattoos. Well, ish. Basically, Joe gets a tattoo on his arm that looks exactly like Sophie, and a few weeks later, she gets a VERY similar tattoo on her thigh, which has tragically since been deleted from Instagram. But Joe’s lives on, so here you go!\n\nJune 2018\n\nSophie is caught FaceTiming with Joe ahead of Kit Harington and Rose Leslie’s wedding, and it’s just about the cutest thing that has ever happened.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nJoe and Sophie attend Nick and Priyanka’s wedding, looking dressed to kill:\n\nMarch 2019\n\nSophie opened up about her relationship with Joe in the March issue of Glamour UK, where she revealed that she feels much happier with her life because Joe is in it. “A lot of [my happiness now] is to do with being with a person I’ve fallen in love with, who loves me more than he loves himself and who wants to see me find my own happiness,” she said. “That was probably the biggest thing that pushed me to find who I am—and find my happiness in things other than acting.”\n\nSophie also commented on her age difference with Joe—she’s 23 and Joe is 30—but she doesn’t really think much of it. “I think once you’ve found the right person, you just know. I feel like I’m much older a soul than I am in age. I feel like I’ve lived enough life to know,” she added. “I’ve met enough guys to know—I’ve met enough girls to know. I don’t feel 22. I feel like 27, 28.”\n\nMay 2019\n\nDing dong ding…is that wedding bells I hear? Must be, because Joe and Sophie officially tie the knot, making them husband and wife. Literally two hours after the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, Joe and Sophie went to Las Vegas for a very campy wedding ceremony on May 1, complete with an Elvis Presley officiator. They exchanged ring pops as Diplo recorded the whole thing on his iPhone, and the rest was history.\n\nWhile Sophie and Joe decided to get married in Las Vegas, they still want to have a more traditional ceremony in the coming summer months. “Well, we’re going to get married this year. We’re going to have a summer wedding, which I’m looking forward to. It’s going to be a lot of fun,” Joe confirmed. “We’re going to have a flag rugby game at the wedding and a flag football game. So if all the groomsmen show up with black eyes and broken arms, I’ll be very proud.”\n\nJuly 2019\n\nWe finally get the first official pics of Sophie and Joe’s wedding, and as expected, it was insanely beautiful. The ceremony took place at Château du Martinet in Provence, Maisie was the maid of honor, and Sophie and Joe’s pets were somehow in the ceremony, which is adorable!\n\nHere’s the official pic from Jophie at their wedding:\n\nAnd since you’re curious, Sophie’s gown was designed by Nicolas Ghesquière (the creative director of Louis Vuitton), who shared his own pic of Sophie’s dress:\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nJophie hit up the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards and are all smiles ahead of Joe, Nick, and Kevin’s performance later in the evening:\n\nFebruary 2020\n\nHOLY SH*T, Y’ALL: Reports break saying that Sophie and Joe are expecting their first child together! Just Jared broke the news first, with a source of theirs claiming that “the couple is keeping things very hush-hush but their friends and family are super excited for them.” Meanwhile, another source of theirs added, “Sophie has decidedly been choosing outfits to wear on and off the carpet to accommodate her changing body.” E! News and Us Weekly also confirmed the news.\n\nJoe and Sophie have yet to say anything about this publicly, but from what it looks like, the whole world is happy for them. Yay, Jophie baby!\n\nMay 2020\n\nSophie and Joe emerged after being quarantined for months, and our fave Game of Thrones alum is visibly pregnant! While it seems unlikely at this point that she and Joe will formally announce their baby news, these pics basically confirm it.\n\nJuly 2020\n\nAnd baby makes three! According to TMZ, Sophie and Joe just welcomed a baby girl. They apparently named her Willa, which is SO CUTE!\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nSophie belatedly posts a bunch of pregnancy pics, tagging Joe, and they’re obviously adorable.\n\nOctober 2020\n\nJoe sports some new ink in honor of Sophie. After shaving his head, he gets a neck tat of her eyes:\n\nNovember 2020\n\nJoe’s not the only one with new ink—Sophie debuts a new tat of the letter “W” for Willa, to go along with her “J” tattoo for Joe.\n\nDecember 2020\n\nSophie went ahead and dropped a bunch of Instagrams in one swoop, and of course they included some Jophie gems. Check ’em out:\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nJoe posted an old pic to his IG grid of a pregnant Sophie for Valentine’s Day. “Happy Valentine’s Day to my 2 Valentines ❤️ throwback,” he wrote in the caption. Okay, this definitely has our hearts feeling some type of way!\n\nApril 2021\n\nSophie had the most iconic reaction to hearing Taylor Swift’s “Mr. Perfectly Fine” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) for the first time. ICYMI, it’s the song that, you know, only subtly shades Sophie’s man Joe. As a lil refresher: Taylor and Joe dated way back when and broke up in 2008—when her album Fearless was first being recorded. Naturally, Swifties everywhere speculated that the lyrics are potentially about him.\n\nHowever, Sophie didn’t seem too bothered because she shared a screenshot to her Instagram Story listening to the song with the caption, “It’s not NOT a bop.”\n\nTaylor even responded to Sophie listening to the track on her Instagram Story, writing back, “Forever bending the knee for the 👑 of the north.”\n\nWhere was Joe among all of this? Completely unbothered. He took to his Instagram Story too, but not to respond to the song—to show that he was out and about, with a cold drink in his hand.\n\nMay 2021\n\nWhile appearing on CBS This Morning, Joe opened up about marriage to Sophie and all things fatherhood since welcoming their first daughter, Willa.\n\n“It’s been amazing. It’s been forced time at home,” he said. “I’m always on the go, I’m always moving and traveling and touring. And to be in one place for a solid amount of time and just have my feet on the ground and be with my family, my immediate family, is time I don’t think I’ll get back.”\n\nThe biggest lesson he’s learned so far about fatherhood? The importance of sleep. “Naps are nice,” he added. “All around.” We couldn’t agree more!\n\nJune 2021\n\nJoe and Sophie celebrated two whole years of marriage (😭!!!) with *adorable* posts of never-before-seen photos of their wedding day in France.\n\n“The best two years of my life. Love you @sophiet,” Joe captioned his photo. Sophie posted to her grid too, writing, “2 years as your wife holy moly I love you bub.”\n\nJuly 2021\n\nOur fave celeb couple took a trip to the City of Love! Joe and Sophie visited Paris to attend a Louis Vuitton dinner held at the French capital. Not to mention, they looked absolutely incredible in their color-coordinated black-and-white outfits.\n\nAugust 2021\n\nSophie shared a very special birthday tribute to Instagram to celebrate Joe’s 32nd birthday. The post featured Joe standing in front of balloons and a banner with the caption, “Birthday boy 🥳,” giving us a rare inside look on the big celebration.\n\nOctober 2021\n\nJoe and Sophie shared a suuuper-romantic kiss in Fenway Park after the Jonas Brothers performed in the iconic Boston stadium for their Remember This Tour. Joe’s post led with him and Sophie in matching jerseys, but the rest of the swipes featured photos of him and his brothers smoking cigars and drinking. A vibe, if we do say so ourselves.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nOkay, I’m not kidding when I say that this of Joe and Sophie lip-syncing to a clip from Keeping Up With the Kardashians lives in my brain rent-free.\n\nMarch 2022\n\nWilla is going to be a big sis! Multiple outlets reported that Joe and Sophie are expecting their second child! We are over the moon for these two!\n\nMay 2022\n\nSophie and Joe show up at the Met Gala looking divine in Louis Vuitton and the pics are truly *chef’s kiss*.\n\nAnd just look at the way he looks at her. 🥺 Needless to say, these two are clearly in love.\n\nOn May 4, a few days after attending the star-studded event, an interview with Elle UK is published where Sophie talks about how she feels about welcoming her second baby. “It’s what life is about for me–raising the next generation...The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We’re so excited to be expanding the family. It’s the best blessing ever.”\n\nShe also admits to the magazine that she’s keen to move back to the UK. “I miss England so much...The people, the attitude, everything. I’m slowly dragging my husband back. I really love living in America, but for my mental health, I have to be around my friends and my family. And also for my daughter—I would love her to get the education and school life that I was so lucky to have. England would ideally be the final destination, but [Joe] might take quite a bit of convincing!” Oop! Looks like we’ll have to stay tuned for a potential move across the pond. 👀\n\nJune 2022\n\nIn a People cover story interview, Joe revealed he’s excited to be a dad to another baby. 🥹 “You really don’t know what to expect. I think [I’m] maybe a little less nervous [this time], but I’m just excited,” he said about his growing family. “It’s such an amazing part of life.”\n\nJuly 2022\n\nIt’s official: Joe and Sophie welcomed another baby girl on July 14, 2022, according to a report by People.\n\nAugust 2022\n\nAugust may be slipping into a moment in time, and Joe Jonas just vocalized his favorite album by his ex, Taylor Swift. What a time to be alive! During a TikTok livestream with Sophie, the alleged “Mr. Perfectly Fine” spoke about his favorite T. Swift album.\n\n“1989, hands down. The best,” Sophie said, adding that Reputation was “inspired by, or partly inspired by” her Game of Thrones character, Sansa Stark. “That’s pretty cool,” Joe added. “And 1989 is a great album. Bangers. Bangers!”\n\nWhen it came time for Joe’s 33rd birthday, Sophie sent well wishes for her husband with a sweet Instagram Story. “Happy birthday my love,” she wrote.\n\nJoe also shared a video outside El Carajo, a restaurant in Miami.\n\n“Pretty cool restaurant for the birthday night,” he said as he showed off the sunset and gave a tour of the spot. “Wifie with the BDay dinner win,” he captioned the post.\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nJoe and Sophie hit their first red carpet together since the birth of their second baby. The couple attended the premiere of Joe’s film Devotion at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2022.\n\nOctober 2022\n\nJophie looked trés chic as they took on Paris Fashion Week. They sat front row for Louis Vuitton’s Womenswear Spring/Summer 2023 show on October 4.\n\nThen on October 15, the couple hit up the second annual Academy Museum Gala and they looked *so* in love. Feast your eyes on this beautiful moment:\n\nAnd, of course, the appearances didn’t stop there. Sophie and Joe also attended the opening night of Topdog/Underdog on Broadway in NYC on October 20.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nOn November 3, Joe and Sophie took a stylish stroll through New York City’s West Village, and suddenly I’m requesting a full ’fit check video on Joe’s TikTok, TYSM.\n\nDuring an , Joe offered some context on why he keeps his relationship with Sophie fairly private.\n\n“I want to feel like an open book,” he said. “But when we started dating, I realized that I didn’t have a ton of stuff that was just for me. And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.”\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nNew year, new Jophie content! On January 17, Joe made an appearance alongside his brothers, Nick and Kevin, for On Air With Ryan Seacrest and opened up about the moment he asked Sophie’s dad for his blessing to marry the Game Of Thrones alum.\n\n“I was probably more nervous to ask her dad than I was to ask her,” Joe said, adding, “It just all mumbles up and then....You throw it out there and you hope that the response is good. Luckily, it went well.”\n\nOn January 30, Sophie supported Joe as he was honored with his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with his brothers. The couple posed alongside Kevin and Danielle Jonas, their nieces Valentina and Alana, and Nick and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. I, for one, can’t get over the *glory* of the Jonas family, as pictured below:\n\nEach JoBro had a chance to speak at the podium to give their thanks, and of course, Joe gave a silly shout-out to his wife. “Sophie, what up, homie? You’re my partner in crime. You keep me motivated and inspired every day. I strive to be as cool as you,” he said. “You got any plans after this?”\n\nWhile their daughters weren’t in attendance, Joe still gave a nod to them as he said, “To my little ones at home, Daddy loves you to the moon and back.”\n\nMarch 2023\n\nThe couple stepped out in coordinating black outfits for the Vanity Fair Oscars Party on March 12, and I literally can’t get over how hot they look:\n\nThey made their way back to the West Village for a casual stroll and some shopping on March 27.\n\nApril 2023\n\nOn April 14, Joe and Sophie headed to the UK for the after-party of his Cup of Joe DJ set at 26 Leake Stree.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nAfter a few months of radio silence on the Jophie front, we’ve finally been graced with more cute content from the couple at the Jonas Brothers’ Yankee Stadium concert on August 12. Of course, Ms. Sophie was in the audience cheering her husband on—complete with a “Mr. Perfectly Fine” friendship bracelet. She really said she’s a Swiftie first and Mrs. Joe Jonas second!\n\nThe actor posted a photo dump commemorating the occasion, featuring sweet pics with Joe:\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nOn September 3, TMZ reported that Joe and Sophie’s marriage may be coming to an end. 💔A source told the outlet, “Joe had his people contact and consult with at least 2 L.A.-area divorce lawyers and he is on the cusp of filing divorce docs to end his marriage to Sophie.” The report also claimed the couple has had “serious problems” over the last six months, and Joe has allegedly been seen without his wedding ring.\n\nAnother insider told People Joe has retained a divorce lawyer, although the couple still hasn’t confirmed or denied whether the rumors are true. On the night of September 3, Joe performed onstage alongside his brothers during their Austin, Texas, tour stop at the Moody Center, and he still wore his ring:\n\nThen on September 4, he seemingly debunked divorce rumors when he posted a black and white backstage photo where his ring is *clearly* visible. 👀\n\nFans were quick to point out this detail in his comments section, writing, “He really said: here’s the ring. now shut up\" and “Joe out here squashing all the rumors 💍.”\n\nBut a breaking report from Today revealed the rumors are actually true, thanks to official court documents. The outlet obtained a petition for dissolution of marriage that was filed by Joe (!!) on September 5 in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The petition states, “The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken” and asks to split custody of their two young daughters as “it is in the best interests of the minor children.” The docs also said Joe and Sophie signed a prenup.\n\nOn September 6, the former couple released a statement confirming the news that read, “Statement from the two of us: After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage. There are many speculative narratives as to why, but truly, this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”\n\nThe joint post came just one day after a source shed more light onto the situation to People and shared, “They were not separated, but they’ve been living separate lives for months,” and that they “haven’t gotten along in a while, but they’re hoping to resolve this all amicably.”\n\n“As far as custody goes, this literally all just happened, so they’re figuring it out in real time,” the insider added. “They did have a prenup. As a family, they were based in Florida. The kids were with him the last few months, traveling with him with family while he’s been on tour. Sophie’s been working in the UK.” At the time, there are also many, many reports as to why the celebs split, including theories that divorce was a “last resort for Joe,” that the musician captured ring cam footage of “Sophie saying and/or doing something that made him realize the marriage was over,” that the Jo Bro was “less than supportive” of Sophie after the birth of their second child, and that the two were reportedly “living separate lives for months.”\n\nTL;DR: A *lot* was said about the potential reasons as to why things soured between Joe and Sophie. But what we knew for sure by September 21 was that the Game of Thrones alum filed legal docs in federal court claiming that Joe was illegally keeping their children in New York City and preventing them from returning to England, per TMZ.\n\nAdditionally, the outlet claimed that the actor wanted a court order “demanding” that Joe “produce the passports and return the kids to her” and that in April of 2023, the couple made England their “permanent home.” Sophie also reportedly claimed in the docs that she and her now ex had planned to raise their children in the United Kingdom and previously discussed them attending school there. And exactly why their children were in the United States was even answered, as TMZ claimed that Sophie recalled that she, “with some hesitation,” agreed they could stay with Joe during the Jonas Brothers’ U.S. tour because she was filming a “very intense” movie. But the plan had always been that in September, she would “collect the children and return home to England.”\n\nIn that same report, TMZ also dropped the bombshell news that, apparently, Sophie and Joe had an argument on August 15 and the musician filed for divorce on September 1...and she found out on September 5 through the media. Additionally, the actor added that though they had both agreed the kids would follow her to England in September, on the 19th of that month, Joe’s attorney contacted her team and relayed that the kids would not be returning to England.\n\nAnd within mere hours of this ^^, Joe’s team issued a statement to Page Six saying that the musician had thought that he and Sophie were meeting on Sunday to work on an “amicable coparenting setup,” which Sophie’s “harsh legal position” jeopardized.\n\n“Less than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK. Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children’s passports, so that she could take them out of the country immediately,” Joe’s rep said, adding that “Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father and is of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the UK.”\n\nAs for claims that Sophie found out about the split via the media? The rep added that she was indeed “aware” that he planned to file due to “multiple conversations.” They also added, “This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending. When language like ‘abduction’ is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst. The children were not abducted.”\n\nPlus, towards the end of the month, an insider revealed to Us Weekly the subject of *that* Ring Cam footage Joe allegedly saw, said that it was simply of Sophie talking about her ex somewhat negatively to a friend: “It wasn’t anything more than that, but that was the final straw.”\n\nMeanwhile, another source noted that Joe's busy tour schedule took a toll on the relationship: “Being a mom on the road is not easy, even when you have unlimited resources. It was just hard for them to settle into a regular routine because of Joe’s career especially.”\n\nOctober 2023\n\nOn October 3, a New York judge ruled that Sophie and Joe will head to trial on January 2 in Manhattan in regards to Sophie's legal filing against Joe. In the meantime, however, the couple has a temporary agreement not to take their daughters out of New York as they figure out their custody situation. Plus, the former couple is set to try and get a head start by resolving some of their issues during four days of mediation—which begin the following day on Wednesday, October 4.\n\nSophie's lawyer, Stephen Cullen, reportedly said in court on Tuesday, October 3 (via People) that they'd go “full hog” in order to resolve the situation, and that they wanted an “amicable resolution.”\n\nJoe's lawyer, Richard Min, meanwhile declared “let there be mediation,” and noted that their team was “optimistic they have given space to mediate, and four days is enough time.”\n\nOn October 10, following the mediation, Page Six reported the good news that the former couple's “amicable resolution on all issues between them is forthcoming.” Per the court docs, the couple's children, Willa, 3, and Delphine, 1, are set to stay with the Game of Thrones star from October 9 to October 21. Additionally, the celeb will be able to travel with her daughters in the U.S. and U.K. within that timeframe. Then, following those dates, beginning on the 21st, the girls will stay with Joe until November 2, and their parents will continue to hand off custody until January 7, 2024. The outlet also revealed that Willa and Delphine will spend Thanksgiving with their father and Christmas with mother.\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nSophie child abduction lawsuit against Joe was officially dismissed. The Los Angeles Times reported that \"attorneys for the former couple asked the New York judge overseeing their case to drop the suit in light of an agreed-upon parenting plan,\" while the New York Times reported that the lawsuit was dismissed \"with both parties’ consent\" on January 17.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nTMZ reported that Joe and Sophie \"failed to has out a settlement\" in mediation, and that Sophie filed documents asking a judge to \"reactivate\" divorce proceedings and impose a \"court ordered settlement.\"\n\nJoe's rep notes that \"The filing was a legal formality, and the couple continues to negotiate an amicable resolution.\"\n\nAnd that’s pretty much all we know right about now, but we’ll be updating you with the latest!"
