        "text": "Background\n\nJoe Jonas is the son of Denise and Paul Kevin Jonas. He and his brothers began homeschooling after Jonas finished seventh grade. His love for music originated from his father, who loved music and could play several instruments. His father encouraged the brothers to sing the song ‘Please Be Mine’ to David Massey, who eventually signed a deal with them, forming the group Jonas Brothers.\n\nJonas was only 16 years old as the frontman of the Jonas Brothers music group when they released their debut single, ‘Mandy,’ in 2005. The world immediately fell in love with the brothers and their voices. So they released their debut studio album, “It’s About Time,” a year later.\n\nAlso, in 2006, the Jonas Brothers did a cover of the hit song ‘Year 3000,’ by a band called Busted, including a music video that premiered on Disney Channel in January. They signed with Disney Channel in 2007 and embarked on their first tour, “When You Look Me in the Eyes Tour.” On June 20, 2008, Jonas and his brothers starred in the musical “Camp Rock,” alongside Demi Lovato. The brothers also got their own Disney comedy series, “Jonas,” which revolved around their lives as influential singers.\n\nThe brothers eventually went their separate ways, and Jonas went on to form the band D.N.C.E., which released its first debut single, ‘Cake by the Ocean,’ in 2015. The next year the group released its debut album, “D.N.C.E.”\n\nSoon, Jonas and Sophie Turner started sparking dating rumors. A year after the rumors were confirmed, Jonas proposed to Turner, on October 15, 2017. The Jonas Brothers also reunited, through their song ‘Sucker,’ which included an over-the-top music video with their partners, Priyanka Chopra, Danielle Jonas, and Sophie Turner. Jonas and Turner tied the knot with two wedding ceremonies, one in Las Vegas and another in France. The pair also welcomed their first in July 2020."
