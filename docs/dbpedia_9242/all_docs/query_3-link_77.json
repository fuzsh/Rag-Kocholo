        "text": "When they started dating in 2016, Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner quickly became one of Hollywood's favorite couples thanks to their unfiltered social posts (see: Sophie posting Taylor Swift's \"Mr. Perfectly Fine,\" allegedly about Mr. Jonas). They tied the knot in 2019 and eventually welcomed two daughters, Willa and Delphine, together. In September 2023, their love story ended when Joe filed for divorce in Miami, Florida as court docs stated that \"The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.\" Since then, a buncha drama has unfolded, from Sophie attempting to sue Joe to mediation and a custody battle over their children.\n\nThings seem to be good between the pair now as they're both back on the dating scene, but it got messy for a sec once they split—and we've got all the details. Find a full timeline of Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner's divorce drama ahead.\n\nSeptember 3, 2023\n\nEverything (publicly) started when TMZ reported that the couple was headed for divorce. Sources with \"direct knowledge\" told the outlet \"Joe had his people contact and consult with at least 2 L.A.-area divorce lawyers and he is on the cusp of filing divorce docs to end his marriage to Sophie.\" The source also dished that they had been having \"serious problems\" for at least six months before the report surfaced. That same day, People also reported that Joe had retained a divorce lawyer.\n\nEagle-eyed fans on Twitter also pointed out that Joe had been periodically seen without his wedding ring:\n\nSeptember 4, 2023\n\nThe *very* next day, Joe seemingly debunked the divorce rumors with a photo of him visibly wearing his wedding band.\n\nSeptember 5, 2023\n\nBut... the rumors ended up being true, according to a breaking report from Today. Joe filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in Miami-Dade County, Florida, according to court documents obtained by the publication. The petition stated that \"The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken\" and asks to split custody of their two young daughters as \"it is in the best interests of the minor children.\" The docs also revealed that Joe and Sophie signed a prenup.\n\nAn insider also shared more info with People, saying, \"They were not separated, but they've been living separate lives for months,\" and that they \"haven't gotten along in a while, but they’re hoping to resolve this all amicably.\"\n\nThe source added, \"As far as custody goes, this literally all just happened, so they’re figuring it out in real time. They did have a prenup. As a family, they were based in Florida. The kids were with him the last few months, traveling with him with family while he’s been on tour. Sophie’s been working in the UK.\"\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\nJoe and Sophie released a joint statement confirming the news via their Instagram accounts:\n\nAn anonymous source also told Page Six that \"divorce was a last resort for Joe.\"\n\n\"He never wanted to break up his family, but he had to take what he felt was the best course of action for his girls,\" the insider added. \"An unhappy home isn’t a home, and the truth is that he and Sophie were going through it this year. There’s a lot of noise out there, but it wasn’t a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back situation like it’s being reported.\"\n\nTMZ also released a cryptic report that alleged Joe \"saw/heard\" something that \"involves a ring camera\" which was the \"last straw in his decision.\"\n\n\"Joe had access to a ring cam that he said captured Sophie saying and/or doing something that made him realize the marriage was over,\" the report read. 😳\n\nSeptember 7, 2023\n\nJoe and Sophie's divorce seemed to keep TMZ in business, because the outlet dropped another report that claimed Joe pressured her into attending events after she gave birth to Delphine in 2022. The report alleged that he was \"less than supportive\" as Sophie wanted to stay home and avoid paparazzi. Despite this, she ended up attending \"several events with Joe,\" including one where she made it \"clear she was uncomfortable and didn't want to be there.\" TMZ's sources revealed that \"Joe complained Sophie was MIA and felt she needed to get out more\" when she skipped another event.\n\nSeptember 21, 2023\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, TMZ reported that Sophie filed legal documents that said Joe was \"unlawfully keeping their children in New York City\" and that she wanted them \"returned\" to England with her. Per the court docs, Sophie and Joe agreed to make England their \"permanent home\" with their daughters.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Sophie agreed \"with some hesitation\" to have the kids stay with Joe while he was on tour with the Jonas Brothers as she was shooting a \"very intense\" time-consuming series. They reportedly agreed to have Sophie return to New York to \"collect the children and return home to England.\" However, the docs allege that Joe \"refused to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother.\"\n\nAND! In the same report, TMZ claimed that the former couple had a huge argument on August 15, which resulted in Joe filing for divorce on September 1. \"She found out September 5 through the media. She adds they had both agreed the kids would follow her to England in September, but on September 19, Joe's attorney contacted her people and said the kids would not be returning to England,\" the article read.\n\nThe very same day all of this bombshell information was dropped, Joe's rep told Page Six that the musician referred to the lawsuit as a \"harsh legal position\" that goes against the \"amicable co-parenting setup\" he thought they were working on the week prior.\n\n\"Less than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK. Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children’s passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately,\" Joe's rep said. The rep also debunked that reports of Sophie finding out about their divorce through the media were false and that she was \"aware\" it was coming after having \"multiple conversations\" with Joe.\n\nHe explained that their children—who had been with Sophie in New York after grabbing dinner with Taylor Swift—are US citizens. \"Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also okay with the kids being raised both in the US and the UK,\" the rep added.\n\nSeptember 25, 2023\n\nReports surfaced that Sophie hung out with Taylor multiple times in New York amid her divorce drama.\n\nWhile she was out on the town, more ~legal stuff~ was going on with Joe as they signed an \"interim consent order\" that \"prohibits both of them from removing their kids from the state.\"\n\nSeptember 27, 2023\n\nRemember that Ring cam footage that was reportedly the \"last straw\" for Joe? Well, an insider spilled to Us Weekly that it was actually NBD. The cam allegedly caught Sophie speaking about Joe \"somewhat negatively\" with a friend, and according to the source, \"It wasn’t anything more than that, but that was the final straw.\"\n\n\"Nobody thought things would get this nasty between Joe and Sophie,\" the insider added. \"Friends are hopeful they can be mature for the sake of the kids, but neither one is going to acquiesce to the other. This could go on for a very long time.\"\n\nThe source noted that the Game of Thrones star \"didn't want to always be 'the Jonas brother's wife' and that she wasn't about the tour wife life. \"Being a mom on the road is not easy, even when you have unlimited resources. It was just hard for them to settle into a regular routine because of Joe’s career especially,\" they said.\n\nAnother source revealed that the pair had only been communicating through lawyers, and that Sophie found Joe to be \"too controlling.\" \"She also said Joe liked to flirt a little too much while out in public, but then he wouldn't like it when she would get too close to her male friends. It was clear their marriage was crumbling,\" the second source explained, adding that \"Sophie is focused on motherhood, coparenting her girls with Joe and her work projects, in that order. She didn’t plan on being a single mom, but that’s what’s happening, so she’s making the best of it.\"\n\nSeptember 28, 2023\n\nAccording to Page Six, Sophie and her daughters reportedly started living in Taylor Swift's Tribeca home during her legal battle with Joe.\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\nSophie went to dinner with Taylor, Blake Lively, Brittany Matthews, and other friends at Emilio's Ballato Italian Pizzeria in SoHo.\n\nOctober 1, 2023\n\nSophie attended the Kansas City Chiefs vs. New York Jets game with Taylor and friends at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nOctober 2, 2023\n\nTo support her claims that they wanted England to be their \"permanent home,\" Sophie provided courts with a letter written by Joe to an Oxford homeowner regarding a property they were hoping to purchase. According to Page Six, the letter was written on June 16 (aka a few months before Joe filed for divorce 😬).\n\nThe outlet published portions of the letter, which read, \"When my wife and I decided we were going to spend more time in the UK and search for a permanent home, our daughter expressed three unwavering requirements: having chickens, a pony, and a Wendy house. While many of the houses we viewed met this criteria, the moment we turned the corner and caught sight of the charming blue shutters adorning [redacted], we experienced a sense of magic unlike anything we had felt before.\" Joe added, \"I have been completely charmed by the idea of dropping my children to school on the boat and being able to spend a leisurely afternoon cruising to the pub with friends on my very own boat.\"\n\nA source also revealed to People that \"They did not buy the house. The house is in escrow, the sale never closed.\"\n\nOctober 3, 2023\n\nA New York judge ruled that the former couple was heading to trial for Sophie's legal filing against Joe on January 2, 2024. According to People, Sophie's lawyer, Stephen Cullen, reportedly said in court that they'd go \"full hog\" to ensure they reached an \"amicable resolution\" via a 4-day mediation that would begin on October 4. Joe's lawyer, Richard Min, added that their team was \"optimistic they have given space to mediate, and four days is enough time.\"\n\nTheir divorce proceedings were put on hold as they worked out a resolution during their mediation.\n\nOctober 10, 2023\n\nPage Six reported that after their mediation, an \"amicable resolution on all issues between them is forthcoming.\" According to court docs obtained by the outlet, their children would stay with Sophie from October 9 to October 21 and they would be able to travel between the US and UK in that timeframe. The girls would then stay with Joe from October 21 to November 2, celebrate Thanksgiving with him, and spend Christmas with Sophie. The docs also revealed that Joe and Sophie were set to hand off custody until January 7, 2024.\n\nOctober 28, 2023\n\nAs divorce drama and legal stuff between Sophie and Joe began to calm down, the X-Men actor was spotted kissing British aristocrat Peregrine Pearson in photos obtained by The Sun. According to a source, Sophie and Peregrine \"arrived together at the chauffeur pick-up location outside of [the Gare du Nord railway station]. It looked like they might have both come on the Eurostar from London. They stood there for a few minutes and were chatting and laughing a lot. He then took his hat off and leaned in to give her a big kiss. After the kiss they parted ways.\" 👀\n\nNovember 1, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, a source told Us Weekly that Joe wasn't \"concerned\" about Sophie's dating life and that dating was \"not on his radar.\"\n\nAnother anonymous source dished that \"Sophie is open to the idea of dating again. She isn’t fully committed to anybody at the moment, but she’s definitely putting herself out there and keeping her options open.\"\n\nNovember 4, 2023\n\n*Coughs* Three of Joe's exes (Taylor, Sophie, and Gigi Hadid) hung out for dinner in NYC. Selena Gomez and Brittany Mahomes were also in attendance!\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nSophie's new gal pal via Taylor, Brittany Mahomes, told Us Weekly that she'd \"love to set her up\" with one of Travis Kelce's friends. \"Brittany knows Sophie is newly single and has hung [out] with her before when Sophie attended one of the [Kansas City Chiefs] games. She would love to help play matchmaker,\" the source said.\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nJoe was reportedly ~salty~ about Sophie and Peregrine's v public makeout sesh, according to the Daily Mail. A source said, \"If Sophie wants to gallivant and kiss whomever in public, [Joe] doesn't really want to play those games.\"\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\nSophie was reportedly dating a couple of people after her split from Joe, but began growing closer to Peregrine (who she was photographed kissing again). \"Things are still fairly new,\" an insider told Us Weekly at the time. \"But she's really happy with how things are moving along.\" While it was \"too soon to tell if there’s long term potential\" with Peregrine, the source said it looked like \"things might be headed that way\" (spoiler alert: they did).\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\nSophie posted an Instagram photo dump to celebrate the new year, writing, \"2023 was the year of the girlies. 2024s forecast is looking fairly consistent\" alongside pics with gal pals Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter. Anddd she was kinda right to do so!\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\nA few months after Joe reportedly slammed Sophie for dating again, he and Stormi Bree were photographed boarding a private jet in Cabo San Lucas. He also posted an Instagram Story featuring an instrumental of \"I Think of You\" by Rodriguez, which has some preeeetty romantic song lyrics. 👀\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nSophie's child abduction lawsuit against Joe was officially dismissed! According to the Los Angeles Times, \"Attorneys for the former couple asked the New York judge overseeing their case to drop the suit in light of an agreed-upon parenting plan,\" and the lawsuit was dismissed \"with both parties' consent\" on January 17, per the .\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nNearly two months after the child abduction lawsuit was dismissed, TMZ reported that Joe and Sophie \"failed to hash out a [divorce] settlement\" in mediation. According to the report, Sophie filed documents asking a judge to \"reactivate\" divorce proceedings and impose a \"court-ordered settlement.\" Joe's rep added that \"The filing was a legal formality, and the couple continues to negotiate an amicable resolution.\"\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nSophie is the latest star to land on the cover of , and she got candid about the \"shocking\" aftermath of her divorce with Joe. She revealed that when rumors claiming she would rather go partying than raise her daughters, Willa and Delphine, started circulating, it was \"the worst few days of [her] life.\"\n\nShe shared, \"I remember I was on set, I was contracted to be on set for another two weeks, so I couldn't leave. My kids were in the States and I couldn't get to them because I had to finish Joan. And all these articles started coming out.\"\n\n\"It hurt because I really do completely torture myself over every move I make as a mother—mum guilt is so real!\" the 28-year-old added. \"I just kept having to say to myself, 'None of this is true. You are a good mum and you've never been a partier.'\"\n\nShe and Joe faced a whirlwind of legal drama and eventually reached an agreement (see above for all the deets). \"There were some days that I didn't know if I was going to make it,\" she said of the custody battle. \"I would call my lawyer saying, 'I can't do this. I just can't.' I was just never strong enough to stand up for myself. And then, finally, after two weeks of me being in a rut, she reminded me that it was my children I was fighting for. Once anyone says to me, 'Do it for your kids,' I'm doing it. I wouldn't do it for myself, but I'll find the strength for them.\"\n\nWhile the pair seem to be in a good place as they share custody of their kids, Sophie added that watching the fallout happen through headlines was \"unfathomable.\"\n\n\"I mean, it's unfathomable the amount of people that will just make shit up and put it up based on a picture,\" Sophie told the outlet. \"A picture might tell a thousand words, but it's not my story. It felt like I was watching a movie of my life that I hadn't written, hadn't produced, or starred in. It was shocking. I'm still in shock.\"\n\nAlso May 14, 2024"
