        "text": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner's last big red carpet appearance was in August at the MTV VMAs, and that's how it'll remain for now. The couple opted not to attend tonight's American Music Awards in Los Angeles, even though Jonas is nominated with his brothers for two major awards: Favorite Duo or Group - Pop/Rock nomination (against BTS and Panic! at the Disco) and Favorite Song - Pop/Rock for \"Sucker.\"\n\nJonas has been at work on the East Coast the past couple days. The singer performed with his brothers in Brooklyn last night on their Happiness Begins tour, and will perform in Toronto on Tuesday. Flying from New York to Los Angeles for one night and then back up to Toronto within a day is a real trek. The boys performed live from Boston instead.\n\nTurner has kept a pretty low profile for the past couple weeks, but she does have a new project that was recently announced for Quibi. The thriller series is called Survive and is based off Alex Morel's novel of the same name, Variety reports. The show will follow \"Jane (Turner), who has to fight for her life when her plane crashes on a remote snow-covered mountain. Paul (Corey Hawkins) is the only other remaining survivor and together they embark on a harrowing journey out of the wilderness, battling brutal conditions and personal traumas.\"\n\nTurner told Variety she was thrilled the play the character. “I couldn’t be more honored to portray the role of Jane in Survive for Quibi,” she said. “She’s a complex character fighting against the odds to not only save her life, but to also find her own source of strength and courage. I only hope this can impact anyone struggling with self-worth to understand they are braver than they know and to seek the support they need.”"
