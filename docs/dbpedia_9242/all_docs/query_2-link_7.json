        "text": "Joseph Adam \"Joe\" Jonas (born August 15, 1989) is an American singer, musician, actor, and dancer who had dated Taylor Swift from July to October of 2008. Five of Taylor's songs, \"Forever & Always\", \"Last Kiss\", \"Better than Revenge\", \"Holy Ground\", and \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\", are speculated to be about him.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers[]\n\nJoe first became well known as one-third of the pop-rock band The Jonas Brothers, which consists of him, his older brother Kevin, and younger brother Nick. He has also worked as an actor, appearing in the 2 Camp Rock movies on the Disney Channel as well as guest starring on such shows as Hot in Cleveland and Hannah Montana.\n\nBesides his work with The Jonas Brothers, Joe also launched a solo career, releasing his first solo album, Fastlife, on October 11, 2011.\n\nTaylor was featured in the Jonas Brothers' concert film Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience, singing \"Should've Said No\".\n\nDNCE[]\n\nIn 2015, Joe formed a new band called DNCE which features JinJoo Lee on guitar, Cole Whittle on bass and keyboards, and former Jonas Brothers drummer Jack Lawless on drums. The band premiered their debut single \"Cake By the Ocean\" on New York's Z100 on September 14, 2015. The single is off of their debut EP, SWAAY, which was released on October 22, 2015.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nBesides Taylor, Joe has dated singer-actress Demi Lovato, actress Camilla Belle, Twilight actress Ashley Greene as well as models Blanda Eggenschwiler and Gigi Hadid. He married Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, whom he now has two children with. The pair were together since 2016 until Jonas filed for divorce in 2023. Swift and Turner were seen together on multiple occasions shortly after their split.\n\nRelationship[]\n\nJoe and Taylor dated from July 2008 to October 2008. Despite the supposedly cruel way the relationship ended (Taylor claims that Joe broke up with her over a 27 second phone call), they are now friends. Joe and his ex, Gigi Hadid, even used to hang out with Taylor and her then-boyfriend, Calvin Harris. Him and Taylor are now friends, supporting each other, as seen through their social medias. Joe commented on how he planned to get The Eras Tour tickets for him and Turner.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nJoe's sister-in-law is Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, who is married to his brother Nick. Some have speculated that there is a feud between her and Taylor, due to Taylor's relationship with Tom Hiddleston. This, though, is very unlikely and a stretch.\n\nJoe's ex-wife, Sophie Turner, appears along with Priyanka Chopra and Danielle Jonas, wife of Joe's brother Kevin, in the music videos for the Jonas Brothers' hit singles \"Sucker\" and \"What A Man Gotta Do\"."
