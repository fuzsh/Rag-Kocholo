As well as Hannah Montana, he and his brothers Nick and Kevin starred in Camp Rock in 2008 and had their own Disney Channel TV series called Jonas Brothers: Living The Dream.\n\nAs the Jonas Brothers, they have released six albums, have been nominated for two Grammy’s and hold the Guinness World Record for Most Entries into the U.S. Top 20 by a group in a year.

This comes from his earnings as one of the Jonas Brothers and of DNCE, whose hits include ‘Cake By The Ocean.’\n\nBy comparison, his older brother Kevin is reportedly worth $40 million (£32million), while younger brother Nick has an estimated net worth of $70 million (£57million).\n\nWhat is Joe Jonas’s height?\n\nJust like age and net worth, Joe is right in the middle of his two brothers, measuring 1.7m tall, while older brother Kevin stands at 1.75m and younger brother Nick is 1.67m.

His children had been the subject of a custody dispute recently but the pair seem to have come to a peaceful arrangement now with both Willa and Delphine staying in their New York home for now.\n\nWho are Joe Jonas's ex-girlfriends?\n\nHere’s one thing for sure, Joe has great taste in girlfriends.\n\nSophie is not the only famous love interest this Jonas brother has had. He also dated Taylor Swift in 2008. One of Taylor's hits, 'Mr Perfectly Fine' is rumoured to be about Joe. Something Sophie - a self-confessed Swiftie - made fun of when she posted a screenshot of the track playing to her Instagram Stories, saying “It’s NOT not a bop!” and tagging Taylor.\n\nJoe also dated Gigi Hadid in 2014 and 2015. They met at the Grammy Awards which Gigi attended with her music producer father, David Foster. After they split, Gigi would go on to have a six-year relationship with Zayn Malik.\n\nAnd In 2010 Joe Jonas also dated his Camp Rock co-star Demi Lovato. The relationship only lasted a short time. At the time, Jo told Teen Vogue: “When I met Demi, I knew right away that our friendship was really strong.” He went on to say how important that friendship was to him and that he didn’t “want to lose that ever.\" Joe and Demi remain on good terms.\n\nHere's one thing for sure, Joe Jonas sure has great taste in girlfriends!"
