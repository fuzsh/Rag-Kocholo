        "text": "Sophie Turner has filed a petition against Joe Jonas for the return of their two children to England, according to court documents filed in the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe musician filed for divorce from the actress earlier this month.\n\nJonas, Turner says, is wrongfully retaining their two children in New York City from their habitual residence in the U.K.\n\nAccording to Turner’s petition, a plan had been in the works for over a year between the perpetually traveling former couple to secure a permanent residence in England, which they have now done, so that their young children can attend school there.\n\n“The Mother is fully involved in all of the children’s schooling, medical care, dental care, cultural activities, extracurricular activities, and other activities in England,” the petition reads. “The Mother provides all of the children’s day-to-day care in England. England is the children’s habitual residence.”\n\nJonas is currently on tour with the Jonas Brothers in the United States, and according to Turner’s petition, she and Jonas had agreed that their children should travel with their father and a nanny in August while she filmed an ITVX drama series.\n\nThe family had planned to meet up in New York after Turner had completed her work commitment, the petition states, and then Jonas and Turner had previously agreed that she would return to England with their children on Sept. 20, 2023.\n\nJonas, according to Turner, blindsided her and upended their plans when, following an argument 0n Aug. 15, he filed for divorce on Sept. 1, something the actress says she only found out about through the media days later.\n\nTurner’s petition says that, in his divorce filings, Jonas is seeking a timesharing schedule for the children to be ordered by the Florida state court based on the incorrect claim that the children have been living in Florida for the past six months.\n\nLast week, the petition continues, Turner met up with Jonas to discuss the established plan of returning to England with the children on Sept. 20.\n\nHowever, the former Disney star allegedly “has possession of the children’s passports... refuses to return the passports... and refuses to send the children home to England” with Turner.\n\n“After multiple conversations with Sophie, Joe initiated divorce proceedings in Florida, as Florida is the appropriate jurisdiction for the case,” a representative for Jonas, who added that Turner was aware that Jonas was going to file for divorce, told The Daily Beast in an email.\n\n“The Florida Court has already entered an order that restricts both parents from relocating the children. Sophie was served with this order on September 6, 2023, more than two weeks ago.”\n\n“Joe and Sophie had a cordial meeting this past Sunday in New York, when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids,” the rep continued. “[The children] have been with her since that meeting. Joe’s impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup.”\n\n“Less than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK. Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children’s passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately.”\n\nJonas is seeking to share parenting duties with Turner and is comfortable with the children, who were born in the United States, being raised in both the U.S. and the U.K., the rep said.\n\n“Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the UK and to remove the children from the U.S. permanently.”\n\n“Joe has already disavowed any and all statements purportedly made on his behalf that were disparaging of Sophie,” the rep concluded. “They were made without his approval and are not consistent with his views. His wish is that Sophie reconsider her harsh legal position and move forward in a more constructive and private manner. His only concern is the well-being of his children.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Turner’s attorney for comment."
