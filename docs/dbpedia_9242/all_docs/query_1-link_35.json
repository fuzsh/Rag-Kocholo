        "text": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas have reached a temporary decision over their daughters' residence a week after the \"Game of Thrones\" star sued the Jonas Brothers singer.\n\nTurner and Jonas share 3-year-old daughter, Willa, and a second daughter, who was born in July 2022 and whose name remains private.\n\nThe former couple filed an interim consent order on Monday in the southern district of New York amid Turner's lawsuit against Jonas for the return of their children to England.\n\nIn the consent order reviewed by USA TODAY, the parties agreed that they will not remove their daughters from \"jurisdictions of the United States District Courts for the Southern & Eastern Districts of New York pending further order of this Court.\" This includes all five boroughs in New York City, Long Island and counties up to Westchester.\n\nTurner and Jonas – who are in the midst of divorce – made the agreement \"without prejudice,\" meaning they cannot use this decision against one another at their upcoming court date.\n\nA pretrial conference with regard to the actress' lawsuit is scheduled for Oct. 3.\n\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" star claims in a lawsuit filed Thursday in the southern district of New York that she met with the Jonas Brothers singer on Sunday where they were \"to discuss their separation,\" according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nJonas disputed the claims via his rep Thursday, alleging a Florida court issued an order blocking either parent from relocating their children. Jonas alleged that if he complies with Turner's request to let the children go to England, he \"will be in violation\" of the court order, a copy of which USA TODAY has obtained and reviewed.\n\nTurner alleged the children were supposed to be returned Wednesday, but said Jonas withheld their daughters' passports and \"refuses to send the children home to England.\" Jonas' rep Jeff Raymond said in a statement to USA TODAY that the couple \"had a cordial meeting\" in New York, \"when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids. They have been with her since that meeting.\"\n\nJonas filed for divorce against Turner in Miami-Dade County court on Sept. 5, according to court documents reviewed by USA TODAY. In the petition, Jonas requested \"shared parental responsibilities\" between himself and Turner for their two daughters as well as enforcement of their April 2019 prenuptial agreement.\n\nThe singer claimed the children have been living with Jonas in Miami \"and other locations throughout the United States\" in his petition, something the \"Dark Phoenix\" actress refutes in her filing.\n\n\"The children have lived in England since April 10, 2023,\" Turner's filing states, adding that in December 2022 when they were in England for Christmas, she and Jonas confirmed they would make the country their \"forever home.\"\n\nSophie Turner's lawsuit in detail: Actress sues for return of 2 children, ex Joe Jonas disputes claims amid divorce\n\n\"All throughout their marriage, and particularly after their children were born, the parties often discussed their desire to raise their children in England and for their children to attend school in England,\" Turner's suit says, adding that the couple \"regarded England as a safe location to raise their children.\"\n\nThursday's petition was filed under The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, both of which provide solutions for children internationally abducted from one parent.\n\n\"When language like 'abduction' is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst,\" Jonas' rep said in the statement Thursday. \"The children were not abducted. After being in Joe's care for the past three months at the agreement of both parties, the children are currently with their mother. Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the UK and to remove the children from the U.S. permanently.\"\n\nContributing: Erin Jensen, KiMi Robinson"
