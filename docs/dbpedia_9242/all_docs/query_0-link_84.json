        "text": "A rockstar dad and an amazing actress for a mom, Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas’ kids got it all. The married couple loves to keep their children private from the public eye.\n\nIn an interview with Harper’s Bazaar UK, Turner explained that she and Jonas had quite a few mutual friends try to set them up, but it just never ended up happening. She said it must have been fate, though, because “[they] were following each other on Instagram, and he direct messaged [her] one fine day, out of the blue.” Bold move! But clearly, it worked in his favor. It’s also a technique that the JoBros seem to really like. Nick Jonas slid into his now-wife’s Twitter DMs with the line, “I think we should connect.” FAst forward a year later, he popped the question and the two married Vegas style in 2019.\n\nNews emerged from TMZ, then by People, that the super couple was heading for a split according to anonymous insiders. “Sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ … Joe had his people contact and consult with at least 2 L.A.-area divorce lawyers and he is on the cusp of filing divorce docs to end his marriage to Sophie,” the tabloid said, observing that he’s gone with and without his wedding ring on public outings.\n\nTMZ also stated that Jonas takes care of his children “pretty much all of the time,” when he’s on tour with the Jonas Brothers. The gossip site reported that Jonas has filed for divorce and is repped by Tom Sasser who handled Tiger Woods’ divorce. The two have a prenup in place and will have joint custody of their kids.\n\nOn October 10, 2023, Jonas and Turner came to the end of a “successful” mediation. “After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the UK,” the pair said in a statement to Page Six Tuesday. “We look forward to being great co-parents.”\n\nPer court documents, the pair agreed that Turner would be able to take the girls back to the UK from October 9 to 21, then Jonas would have them until November 2. The exes will continue to swap custody through January 7, 2024, meaning they will spend Thanksgiving with their father, while Turner will have them over Christmas.\n\nOn September 21, 2023, Page Six reported that Sophie Turner sued Joe Jonas. The Game of Thrones actress filed for “the immediate return of children wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained,” the documents, which were obtained by Page Six, stated.\n\nTurner claimed in the filing that the “wrongful retention” began September 20, 2023, and alleged that the former couple would make England their “forever home” and would begin looking for schools for their older daughter, Willa, in the country. “The parties were both excited for the family’s move to England,” the documents stated, adding that it was the reason why the two sold their Miami home.\n\nThe family officially relocated from Miami to England on April 10, 2023, but Jonas and Turner “agreed with hesitation” that the children travel with the Jonas Brothers member on tour, since he had time to spend during the day.\n\n“The children would then at least be able to spend some time during the day with one of their parents until the Mother finished her filming commitments,” the documents explain, noting that the daughters traveling on tour would only be a “temporary arrangement” when she was filming Joan.\n\nTurner also claimed that Jonas retains the children’s passports “The Father has possession of the children’s passports,” the documents claim. “He refuses to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother.” Turner is also planning to have a similar lawsuit in the UK since it would allegedly be a “breach” of her custody rights.\n\nJonas previously gushed about fatherhood. “It’s been amazing to be a dad and to learn every day more about myself and what that’s like,” Jonas told PEOPLE. “It’s what life is about for me – raising the next generation,” Turner told Elle UK. “The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We’re so excited to be expanding the family. It’s the best blessing ever.”\n\nSo who are Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas’ kids? Read more to find out."
