For the Elimination challenge, the chefs cook breakfast inspired by a dinosaur's diet for the kids and their parents.\n\nMother Dearest\n\nAdrianna has to un-invite Navid to her magazine premiere party after Victor arranges for her to go with Joe Jonas to boost her image.\n\nBoyz II Dead\n\nGeils and Tanner investigate the mysterious death of a reunited boy band member while Tribeca finally meets with Sgt.
