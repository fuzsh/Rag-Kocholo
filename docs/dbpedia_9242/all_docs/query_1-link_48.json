        "text": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner have reached a temporary agreement over the custody of their two children, according to court documents obtained by \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nAfter a four-day mediation period, which ran Oct. 4-7, the former couple's lawyers filed a second interim consent order Oct. 10 that outlines when the children will be with each of their parents between October and early January.\n\nThe order stipulates that Jonas and Turner each \"may temporarily travel with the children to the United Kingdom and/or to any state in the United States of America\" while the children, who were born in 2020 and 2022, are with them.\n\n\"After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the UK. We look forward to being great co-parents,\" Jonas and Turner said in a joint statement obtained by \"GMA.\"\n\nThe first interim consent order was also vacated with this filing, which prohibited either parent from removing the children from New York.\n\nThe new filing also stipulates that \"the parties shall jointly submit a status report letter to this Court on or before Dec. 23, 2023, which shall address the status of mediation and of these proceedings.\"\n\nIn a letter filed Oct. 10 by Turner and Jonas' attorneys on their behalf, the former couple stated that the \"parties believe that an amicable resolution on all issues between them is forthcoming.\"\n\n\"Good Morning America\" has reached out to reps for Jonas and Turner for comment.\n\nThe mediation was an initial pre-trial conference to work out details of Turner and Jonas' divorce, specifically, a basic parenting plan for their children.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the former couple agreed to an interim consent order that prohibited both parties from \"removing their two children … or causing the children to be removed from the jurisdictions of the United States District Courts for the Southern & Eastern Districts of New York pending further order\" of the court, according to court documents obtained by \"GMA.\"\n\nBoth of the couple's children are dual citizens of the U.S. and U.K., according to an earlier court filing.\n\nThe agreement to keep their kids in New York City came after Turner filed a lawsuit against Jonas for the return of their children to England, nearly three weeks after the \"Game of Thrones\" star and Jonas Brothers singer announced their divorce in early September. According to Turner's filing, the petition stemmed from \"the wrongful retention\" of their children \"in New York City from their habitual residence of England.\"\n\nAt the time, a representative for Jonas told \"GMA\" previously that the former couple had a \"cordial meeting\" Sept. 17 and that Turner had been with the children ever since.\n\n​​\"Joe's impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup,\" the statement said. Less than 24 hours after the meeting, Turner requested to take the children to England immediately and demanded their passports, according to Jonas' representative.\"\n\nJonas' representative said Turner's request was a violation of an earlier court order restricting both parents from relocating the children.\n\nJonas filed for divorce from Turner \"on or about Sept. 1,\" claiming that their marriage was \"irretrievably broken.\"\n\nIn a joint statement shared to their respective Instagram accounts, the former couple said, \"There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.\"\n\nJonas and Turner got engaged in 2017 after a year of dating. They married in a Las Vegas wedding chapel in May 2019 and held a second ceremony at the Chateau de Tourreau in France a month later.\n\nThe former couple, who are largely private when it comes to their personal life, have not shared publicly the names of their children, or their exact birth dates."
