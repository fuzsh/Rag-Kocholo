Joe descends from the same Jonas line.\n\nIt is not publicly known who Joe’s biological paternal grandfather is.\n\nJoe’s paternal grandmother, now Cecilia Lucas, was born under the name Cecilla/Cecilia Paulette Jonas (the daughter of Paul Adam Jonas and Nellie May/Mae Fox). Cecilia was born in North Carolina. Paul was the son of Henry Walter Jonas and Nora Lee/Leigh Campbell. Nellie was the daughter of Nathan/Walter Henry Fox and Elizabeth/Lizzie Mae Hamilton. Through the Jonas line, Joe is descended from German immigrants to the United States in the 1700s.\n\nJoe’s maternal grandfather was Gerald “Jerry” Miller (the son of Henry J. Miller and Agnes Marie Carroll). Gerald was born in The Bronx, New York. Henry was the son of Henry J. Miller and Anna Kelly, who was of Irish origin. Agnes was born in New York, to Irish parents, Michael Carroll and Bridget/Bridgette Lyons.\n\nJoe’s maternal grandmother is Frances Madonia (the daughter of Fortunato Angelo “Frank” Madonia and Margaret Anna Berard). Fortunato was born in New York, the son of Angelo Madonia and Maria Chimero, who were of Italian descent, with Maria’s family being from Sicily. Margaret was born in Bennington, Vemont, the daughter of Milton Dewey Berard and Anna Mary/Rose Ducharme, who were of French-Canadian ancestry.\n\nSources: Genealogy of Joe Jonas – https://www.geni.com\n\nInformation on Joe’s paternal great-grandfather, Paul Adam Jonas – http://www.findagrave.com\n\nObituary of Joe’s paternal great-grandmother, Nellie May/Mae (Fox) Jonas – http://www.legacy.com\n\nDeath record of Joe’s maternal great-grandfather, Henry J.
