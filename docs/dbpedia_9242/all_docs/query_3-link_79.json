        "text": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner were the golden couple of music-meets-magic until they weren’t. Their seemingly fairytale marriage came to an end when Joe filed for divorce after four years of marriage, leaving many fans with more questions than answers about what really happened between them.\n\nWhy Is Joe Jonas Getting Divorced From Sophie Turner?\n\nLife & Style confirmed that Joe filed for divorce from the Game of Thrones star on September 5, 2023, via online court records. According to multiple outlets, the DNCE frontman stated that his marriage was “irretrievably broken.” The news came just two days after rumors about the couple’s status circulated, with multiple reports claiming that they were “heading for divorce.”\n\nWhat Went Wrong Between Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner?\n\nThree months before Joe filed for divorce, In Touch reported that he and Sophie were “at a crossroads” in their marriage after seven years together.\n\n“Things are tense between them,” the source explained at the time. “The two have a lot on their plate right now. … It’s not surprising that there’s tension between them. But they love each other, so whatever it is they’re going through, their friends and family are confident the two will work it all out.”\n\nSophie and Joe had been spotted together just three weeks before their split was confirmed, as the actress joined the crowd during the Jonas Brothers’ opening night of tour on August 12, 2023.\n\nFollowing news of their divorce, reports surfaced claiming that the former couple were at different stages in life, pointing to Sophie’s partying as a factor in their split. Sources later told TMZ that Ring camera footage of Sophie seen by the DNCE rocker was allegedly the final nail in the coffin.\n\nWill Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner Have Joint Custody of Their Children?\n\nJoe and Sophie have two daughters together – 3-year-old Willa and their 1-year-old daughter, Delphine. According to multiple reports, the couple’s kids have been staying with Joe in Miami, but that “it is in the best interests of the minor children that the parties have shared parental responsibility.”\n\nSophie sued Joe on September 20, 2023, in a Manhattan court requesting “the immediate return of children wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained,” in documents obtained by Life & Style, asking that the kids be returned to her native England. The actress claimed that during a family visit to her homeland over Christmas 2022, she and Joe jointly decided that they would look for their “forever home” in England, select a school for their older daughter and settle their family there."
