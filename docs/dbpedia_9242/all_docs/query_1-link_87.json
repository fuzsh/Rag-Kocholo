        "text": "Sophie Turner has filed a lawsuit against Joe Jonas for allegedly refusing to return the pair's children to England amid their divorce.\n\nTurner and Jonas share 3-year-old daughter, Willa, and a second daughter, who was born in July 2022 and whose name remains private.\n\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" star claims in a lawsuit filed Thursday in the southern district of New York that she met with the Jonas Brothers singer on Sunday where they were \"to discuss their separation,\" according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nJonas is disputing the claims, his rep said in a statement to USA TODAY Thursday, alleging a Florida court has issued an order blocking either parent from relocating their children. USA TODAY has obtained and reviewed a copy of the court order.\n\nTurner alleges that the children were supposed to be returned on Wednesday, but Jonas has withheld their daughter's passports and \"refuses to send the children home to England.\" Jonas' rep Jeff Raymond said in the statement that: \"Joe and Sophie had a cordial meeting this past Sunday in New York, when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids. They have been with her since that meeting.\"\n\nJonas alleges that if he complies with Turner's request to let the children go to England, he \"will be in violation of the Florida Court order.\" USA TODAY has reached out to Turner's reps for comment.\n\nJonas filed for divorce against Turner in Miami-Dade County court on Sept. 5, according to court documents reviewed by USA TODAY. In the petition, Jonas requested \"shared parental responsibilities\" between himself and Turner for their two daughters as well as enforcement of their April 2019 prenuptial agreement.\n\nIn Turner's lawsuit, she alleges she found out about Jonas' divorce filing through the media, while a rep for Jonas claims \"Sophie was aware that Joe was going to file for divorce.\"\n\nThe singer claimed the children have been living with Jonas in Miami \"and other locations throughout the United States\" in his petition, something the \"Dark Phoenix\" actress refutes in her filing.\n\nSophie Turner, Taylor Swift step out for girls night amid actress' divorce from Joe Jonas\n\n\"The children have lived in England since April 10, 2023,\" Turner's filing states, adding that in December 2022 when they were in England for Christmas, she and Jonas confirmed they would make the country their \"forever home.\"\n\n\"All throughout their marriage, and particularly after their children were born, the parties often discussed their desire to raise their children in England and for their children to attend school in England,\" Turner's suit says, adding that the couple \"regarded England as a safe location to raise their children.\"\n\nAccording to Turner's filing, the couple entered into contracts for a home on July 7 to be settled on Dec. 2. Per the docs, the former couple decided the children would \"travel with (Jonas) and the nanny for a vacation in August,\" as Turner was slated to star in a new series for ITVX throughout August with a filming schedule that \"was very intense, with long hours during the daytime when the children would be awake.\" Then Turner would \"return home to England with the children\" on Sept. 20, the suit states.\n\nTurner's suit gives insight to the couple's split, claiming \"the breakdown of the parties' marriage happened very suddenly,\" alleging an \"argument\" on Aug. 15 that preceded Jonas' divorce filing in early September.\n\nThursday's petition was filed under The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, both of which provide solutions for children internationally abducted from one parent.\n\nTurner also shared in her filing that she plans to file a case in England. Jonas' custody of their children is a \"breach\" of Turner's \"rights of custody under English law,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"When language like 'abduction' is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst,\" Jonas' rep said in the statement Thursday. \"The children were not abducted. After being in Joe's care for the past three months at the agreement of both parties, the children are currently with their mother. Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the UK and to remove the children from the U.S. permanently.\"\n\nContributing: KiMi Robinson"
