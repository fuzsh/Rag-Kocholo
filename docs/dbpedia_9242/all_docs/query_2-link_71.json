        "text": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas have welcomed their second child!\n\nA rep confirmed the happy news to People on July 14. “Joe and Sophie are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl,” the rep said. This early July birthday comes almost exactly two years after Turner and Jonas welcomed their first baby girl, Willa, on July 22, 2020. That’s two summer babies for the young couple!\n\nThe Game of Thrones star announced her second pregnancy by cradling her growing baby bump at the 2022 Met Gala on May 2. She then confirmed the news in an interview with Elle U.K., which was published just a few days later.\n\n“It’s what life is about for me—raising the next generation,” Turner said at the time. “The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We’re so excited to be expanding the family. It’s the best blessing ever.”\n\nTurner and Jonas first got married in a quirky Las Vegas wedding in 2019, followed by a more traditional ceremony in France. Now that Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra have welcomed their own child via surrogacy, a baby girl named Malti Marie Chopra Jonas, all three members of the Jonas Brothers are officially girl dads.\n\nBefore the Met Gala, Sophie Turner discussed how becoming a parent has helped her become a better actor. “The empathy is heightened; the feelings about family are just like overflowing,” she said on the UnWrapped podcast. “It’s made me a better actor for becoming, you know, becoming a mother.”\n\nShe continued, “The concept of family has made me an entirely much more emotional person. You know how you see your parents, as they get older, become way more sensitive? Like, I’ve never seen my dad cry, and now I see him cry all the time. I feel like that.”"
