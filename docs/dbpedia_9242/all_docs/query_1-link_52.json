Have an account? .\n\nReports suggest that Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are heading for a divorce.\n\nThe pair married in 2019 and have two children together, whom they keep out of the spotlight.\n\nHere's everything they've said about their two daughters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner got married in 2019.\n\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner started dating in 2016 when she was roughly 20, and he was roughly 27.\n\nTurner told Harper's Bazaar UK in 2019 that Jonas messaged her on Instagram, and their pair soon met in person in London.\n\nA year into dating, the pair announced their engagement, and they got married in 2019.\n\nOn Sunday, TMZ reported that Jonas may be looking to divorce Turner, and People reported that Jonas has retained a divorce lawyer.\n\nRepresentatives for Jonas did not respond to a request for comment from Insider. A spokesperson for Turner declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonas and Turner share two daughters, who were born in 2020 and 2022.\n\nJonas and Turner welcomed their first child on July 22, 2020.\n\nTMZ first reported that Turner had given birth to a girl, whom they named Willa, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAlmost two years later, the pair welcomed a second child, though this time they did not reveal the baby's name.\n\nIn July 2022, representatives for the couple told People: \"Joe and Sophie are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2021, Turner celebrated her first Mother's Day with Willa.\n\nIn March 2021, Turner celebrated her first Mother's Day as a mom by sharing a short post on her Instagram story.\n\n\"I'm so grateful to the two loves of my life for making me a mama. @JoeJonas and my beautiful baby girl,\" Turner wrote in her Instagram story. \"It's my favorite job I've ever had.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2021, Joe told CBS' \"This Morning\" that he was grateful that the pandemic allowed him to spend more time at home.\n\nAppearing virtually on CBS' \"This Morning\" in May 2021, Jonas was asked about becoming a father and parenting during the pandemic.\n\n\"It's been amazing. It's been forced time at home — I'm always on the go, I'm always moving and traveling and touring,\" the \"Sucker\" singer said.\n\n\"To be in one place for a solid amount of time and having my feet on the ground and be with my family, my immediate family, is time I don't think I'll get back. I'm so thankful and grateful.\"\n\nAsked for advice for new parents, Jonas added: \"Naps are nice. All around.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2022, Turner said that being a mother had improved her acting.\n\nIn May 2022, Turner appeared in her first acting role after giving birth to Willa.\n\nTurner played the daughter of Michael Peterson, a novelist accused of killing his wife, in HBO Max's \"The Staircase.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on The Wrap's \"Unwrapped\" podcast, the \"X-Men\" star was asked whether becoming a mother had helped her with the new role.\n\n\"I think it certainly adds a different perspective,\" Turner said. \"I feel like the empathy and the concept of family has made me entirely a much more emotional person. The empathy is heightened. The feelings about family are just, like, overflowing.\"\n\n\"It's made me a better actor becoming a mother because as an actor, the only way to become a real brilliant actor is to experience as much life as possible and to bring those experiences in,\" Turner added. \"So this is just another little part of life that I'm experiencing that I get to bring in and hopefully, it helps my performance one way or another.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2022, Turner spoke to Elle UK about being a mother and preparing her oldest daughter for a sibling.\n\nTurner told Elle UK: \"It's what life is about for me – raising the next generation. The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We're so excited to be expanding the family. It's the best blessing ever.\"\n\nTurner added that Willa did not fully understand yet that she was about to gain a sibling.\n\n\"But she is a lot clingier than normal, so I think she has an idea. She wants Mummy all of the time – she's claiming her territory,\" the \"Game of Thrones\" star said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurner also spoke to Elle UK about moving to the UK.\n\nIn her Elle UK interview, Turner said that she moved her family to Atlanta while filming \"The Staircase\" so that she could have stability.\n\n\"It's difficult, because I'm someone who doesn't like change. I like consistency and, with the job I have, it's not attainable. So, I move everything – my daughter, my entire house. There is no more staying in hotel rooms,\" Turner said. \"We get a house and commit to it. I couldn't not go home to my daughter at the end of the day. Joe's job is bouncing around from city to city every night. I have a longer amount of time in one place, so it makes sense for me to have her with me.\"\n\nTurner also said that she missed England and wanted to move back to the UK permanently.\n\n\"The people, the attitude, everything. I'm slowly dragging my husband back. I really love living in America but, for my mental health, I have to be around my friends and my family,\" she said. \"And also for my daughter – I would love her to get the education and school life that I was so lucky to have.\"\n\nTurner added: \"My parents' house is the epitome of the English countryside – horses, sheep, cows...\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurner said that she doesn't want her oldest daughter to become a nepo baby.\n\nTurner told Elle UK that she doesn't want her daughter to be caught up in the world of showbiz.\n\n\"I'm very protective of the life we've built. Every time Joe and I do a red carpet together, we make sure it's for the right reason and makes sense for our careers. You never want to market yourself as a celebrity couple. It's not that cool,\" she said. \"And my daughter never asked for any of this.\"\n\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" star added: \"I know what it can do to your mental health to be in this industry, and to be photographed every day and have the comments. It's not something I want her to deal with unless she says, 'This is what I want to do.'\"\n\nTurner also said she doesn't want her daughter to become a nepo baby.\n\nTurner said: \"We're quite strict about that. We'll encourage her to do whatever she wants but I don't think we would professionally let her do anything until she's 18. I also feel quite strongly about my daughter not becoming a nepotism child.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2022, Jonas was asked about how he felt about baby number two.\n\nIn a cover interview for People in June last year, Jonas said that he was more prepared for his second child.\n\n\"You really don't know what to expect. I think maybe a little less nervous, but I'm just excited,\" Jonas said. \"It's such an amazing part of life.\"\n\nThe DNCE frontman added: \"It's been amazing to be a dad and to learn every day more about myself and what that's like. Living in a new city, and it's a very exciting time. I'm very much looking forward to the future on all things.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurner briefly mentioned Willa in a video for British Vogue.\n\nIn May 2022, Turner participated in British Vogue's \"In The Bag\" YouTube series, in which celebrities share the contents of their handbag.\n\nIn the video, Turner pulled out a bag of fruit rolls and explained that it was for her daughter.\n\n\"I simply cannot leave the house without a snack for her because then my life would be made a living hell and I would get yelled at by my child,\" Turner said. \"These are her faves, and I'll just never leave the house without them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August 2022, Jonas said he's still learning to balance his career with parenting.\n\nJonas spoke about balancing his music career and family life in an interview with People.\n\n\"It's an adjustment period,\" he said. \"Just something that I'm learning as I go, I think I can now work a little bit harder to take time off. I'm still trying to figure it out. Some weeks are a little bit more challenging than others, but it makes it a lot easier when you enjoy your gig\"\n\nJonas added: \"I wake up every day just thrilled to be able to go make music or act and create different projects and have a beautiful family, so it feels like a dream come true.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonas said he feels like \"a kid raising kids.\"\n\nIn an interview with Mr. Porter in November 2022, Jonas opened up again about being a parent.\n\nHe said: \"I'm a little less scared. You don't need to check their pulse constantly to make sure they're breathing. You get over those fears.\"\n\nHowever, he added: \"I feel like a kid raising kids.\"\n\nJonas also explained why he and Turner are so private about their family life.\n\n\"I want to feel like an open book,\" the 34-year-old singer said. \"But when we started dating, I realized that I didn't have a ton of stuff that was just for me. And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonas gave his daughters a shout-out when he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn January 2023, the Jonas Brothers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nPeople reported that during his speech, Jonas gave a shout-out to both of his children, who weren't present at the event.\n\n\"To my little ones at home, Daddy loves you to the moon and back,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurner accidentally shared a video of her daughter in May 2023.\n\nIn May, People reported that Turner accidentally shared a video of her Willa on Instagram before immediately deleting the post.\n\nShe told her followers via her Instagram story to delete any copies of the video.\n\n\"Earlier today I made an honest mistake accidentally posting a video of our daughter on instagram stories,\" she wrote. \"We have always advocated for our kids' rights to privacy so sharing this publicly is something that is against anything I stand for.\"\n\nTurner continued: \"Our children deserve the right to grow up out of the public eye, to learn and grow in private. If I ever were to post anything of our kids, know that it is unquestionably a mistake. I would greatly appreciate if anyone who has reposted on any of other platform, please delete the video.\"\n\nRead next\n\nSophie Turner Joe Jonas\n\nAdvertisement"
