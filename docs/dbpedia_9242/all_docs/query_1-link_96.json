        "text": "Sophie Turner is suing Joe Jonas for the return of their two young children to the UK.\n\nCourt documents allege the Jonas Brothers singer, who filed for divorce earlier this month, is refusing to hand over the children's passports, according to NBC, Sky News's US partner.\n\nJonas, meanwhile, has urged Turner to \"reconsider her harsh legal position and move forward in a more constructive and private manner\".\n\n\"His only concern is the well-being of his children,\" his representative said.\n\nHis statement also condemned the use of language such as \"abduction\" calling it \"misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst\", according to NBC.\n\n\"The children were not abducted,\" the statement said. \"Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the UK and to remove the children from the US permanently.\"\n\nTurner - who was spotted out in New York last night with Taylor Swift, who also had a relationship with Jonas - claimed she heard about Jonas filing for divorce through the media.\n\nA joint statement from the former couple this month described the decision to divorce as \"amicable\" and \"mutually decided\" following \"four wonderful years of marriage\".\n\nHowever, while Jonas filed his documents on 1 September, Turner did not find out until four days later, the petition said.\n\nTurner's court documents, filed in the Southern District of New York, said the couple's children, born in 2020 and 2022, have been wrongfully retained in New York City since 20 September from \"their habitual residence\" in England.\n\nThe children are currently with Turner in New York, court documents said, with Jonas allegedly refusing to allow them to cross the Atlantic to England.\n\nThe documents said the youngsters, who have dual citizenship, are \"fully involved and integrated\" in daily life in England, with the older child attending school, and both involved in playdates and cultural activities.\n\nTurner has \"never consented or acquiesced to the removal of the children from England\", the court documents said.\n\nThey said that Turner - who played Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones - and the singer made England their permanent home in April, partly because of a desire to have the children educated in the country.\n\nThey moved into a rented property in May and made an offer on a permanent home in July, with a plan to move in in December, the filing said.\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nStrictly star shaves her head in cancer treatment\n\nSaudi prince 'will continue sportswashing' to boost economy\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nBecause Turner began filming a new drama series in the UK in May, they decided the children would travel with Jonas and a nanny as he kicked off a tour with the Jonas Brothers in the United States in late July, NBC reported.\n\nThe plan, according to the petition, was for the children to stay with Jonas and his extended family until Turner finished filming.\n\nShe was then apparently expecting to return to the UK with the children after flying to New York in mid-September.\n\nBut that was before the divorce was announced.\n\nHowever, the statement from Jonas disputed that claim, adding that the Florida court where the divorce was filed \"restricts both parents from relocating the children\" and that Turner was aware of that order.\n\nJonas's representative said he and Turner had a \"cordial\" meeting on Sunday in New York after she flew there to be with the children.\n\n\"Joe's impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Less than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK.\n\n\"Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children's passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately. If he complies, Joe will be in violation of the Florida court order.\""
