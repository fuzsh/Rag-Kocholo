Following the intimate Las Vegas ceremony, the duo – who began dating in 2016 — held a second wedding in Sarrians, France, in June 2019.\n\nUs confirmed in February 2020 that the lovebirds were expecting their first child together. Turner gave birth to their daughter, Willa, five months later. In March 2022, Us confirmed the twosome were expecting baby No. 2 and their second daughter, whose name has yet to be revealed, was born that July.\n\nWhile both Turner and Joe have largely kept their relationship out of the spotlight, the Jonas Brother gave a shout-out to his family during his Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony in January 2023. \"To my little ones at home, Daddy loves you to the moon and back,\" he said. \"Sophie, what up homie? You're my partner in crime. You keep me motivated and inspired every day. I strive to be as cool as you. You got any plans after this?\"\n\nScroll down to relive the pair's relationship:\n\nCredit: Courtesy Sophie Turner/Instagram\n\nJune 2021\n\nTurner paid tribute to her husband on his first Father’s Day since welcoming their daughter, Willa, in July 2020.\n\n\"Happy Father's Day to the ultimate dad and all the dads out there,\" the U.K. native wrote via Instagram in June 2021. \"Grab that cooler, pick up your spatula, strap on those sandals and get to grillin'. Joe you are the best baby daddy, It's my greatest joy to watch.\"\n\nThe Game of Thrones alum also shared a snap of the singer to her Instagram Story, writing, “Happy 1st Father's Day to this cool cat.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Joe Jonas/Instagram\n\nJuly 2021\n\nThe musician joked about his and Turner’s go-to coronavirus pandemic activities on WSJ.com's “My Monday Morning” series, noting the couple got “very into” LEGOs. \"My wife and I probably built 10 monstrous LEGOs. It was also quite funny, because I was super focused on helping her but then I was getting easily distracted and playing Fortnite,” Jonas explained. \"At first, we argued about it, and then it was like, she loves her organization and it’s completely different from the way I would build it. [I said], 'You do you. I’ll be here for support. I’ll make the cocktails for us.’\"\n\nCredit: Steve Sands/NewYorkNewswire/Shutterstock\n\nNovember 2022\n\n\"I want to feel like an open book,\" the musician told Mr. Porter, explaining why he and Turner prefer to keep their romance relatively private. \"But when we started dating, I realized that I didn't have a ton of stuff that was just for me. And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.\"\n\nHe went on to recall past experiences in his career where \"a small thing has been blown out of proportion,\" adding: \"It's had this trickling effect, which is partially why I decided to take a mental health break from social media. Now I'm addicted to not knowing what's going on.\""
