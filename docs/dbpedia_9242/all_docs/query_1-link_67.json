        "text": "Sophie Turner has sued her ex-husband Joe Jonas, claiming he refused to give her their children’s passports so they could return to England, The New York Times reports and court documents reviewed by The FADER confirm. Her petition to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York demands her children’s return to their country of “habitual residence.” The two children, born in 2020 and 2022, are dual citizens of the U.S. and United Kingdom, according to the petition. The lawsuit comes two weeks after the couple announced their divorce via separate but identical Instagram posts, calling their separation a “united decision.”\n\nIn a written statement, Jonas’s representative Joe Raymond told The Times that an order from the Florida court where the divorce was filed prohibited both Jonas and Turner from relocating their children, and that Jonas would be in violation of that order if he sent them back to England. “Joe is seeking shared parenting with the kids so that they are raised by both their mother and father, and is of course also OK with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the U.K.,” Raymond said, adding, “The children were born in the U.S. and have spent the vast majority of their lives in the U.S.” The petition indicates that Jonas’s decision to file for divorce took Turner by surprise, a claim Raymond denied in his statement."
