        "text": "After four years of marriage and two kids, Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are getting divorced.\n\nJonas filed for a dissolution of marriage from Turner on Sept. 5, 2023. According to documents obtained by PEOPLE, the filing claimed \"the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.\"\n\nThey addressed their split on Instagram the following day, saying it was \"a joint decision.\"\n\nThe Game of Thrones actress and Jonas Brothers musician first connected through Instagram DMs in 2016. While Turner didn't expect to like Jonas at first, they fell hard for each other after one evening at a British pub.\n\nA year later, Jonas popped the question, and in 2019, the couple tied the knot twice: first in a surprise ceremony in Las Vegas and later at a lavish affair in the French countryside. According to Turner, getting married only changed their relationship for the better.\n\n\"I feel as though the only thing that's changed for me is having this incredible sense of security. Just the word 'husband' and the word 'wife': they solidify the relationship. I love being married. I think it's wonderful. I'm sure we'll have our hiccups, but right now the security and the safety are everything,\" she told Elle in 2020.\n\nTurner and Jonas welcomed two children together during their marriage: daughter Willa in 2020 and daughter Delphine in 2022.\n\nFrom their Instagram connection to their divorce, here's everything to know about Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner's relationship.\n\n2016: Joe Jonas slides into Sophie Turner's DMs on Instagram\n\nLong before Jonas and Turner met in person, they had mutual friends who were trying to set them up. While their friends failed at playing matchmaker, the pair did follow each other on Instagram sometime in 2016 — and Jonas ended up sliding into Turner's DMs.\n\n\"We had a lot of mutual friends, and they'd been trying to introduce us for a long time,\" Turner explained, adding, \"We were following each other on Instagram and he direct-messaged me one fine day, out of the blue.\"\n\nOctober 2016: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner meet for the first time\n\nNot long after connecting on Instagram, Jonas invited Turner to hang out while his tour was passing through the U.K. Turner's friends thought it would be \"hilarious\" and convinced her to agree.\n\nThe two arranged to meet up at a bar and, just in case Jonas was a catfish, Turner brought along her \"rugby boys\" to keep her safe. While she expected Jonas to \"show up with security,\" she was pleasantly surprised when the singer arrived with a friend.\n\n\"He didn't bring security. He brought a friend, and they drank just as hard as the rest of us. I remember the two of us spending only a couple of minutes on the dance floor, and then we just found a space far in the corner and we just talked. We talked for hours, and hours, and hours. And I was, like, not bored. It wasn't contrived. It wasn't small talk — it was just so easy. And soon we were, like, inseparable. I went on tour with him,\" Turner shared.\n\nOctober 31, 2016: Joe Jonas attends a Halloween party with Sophie Turner\n\nThat same month, Jonas and Turner attended a Halloween party together. Although they didn't post about the event, a friend shared a group shot that included them both. In the snap, Turner could be seen in a bunny costume while Jonas was dressed as a dalmatian.\n\nNovember 6, 2016: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are spotted at a Kings of Leon concert\n\nJust a few days later, Turner and Jonas were spotted together for the first time in public while attending a pre-MTV Europe Music Awards Kings of Leon concert in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Fans snapped photos of the duo looking cozy together, and a concertgoer told PEOPLE they were seen kissing at the event.\n\nNovember 24, 2016: Sophie Turner spends Thanksgiving weekend with Joe Jonas\n\nAt the end of November 2016, Turner and Jonas spent Thanksgiving weekend together. They kicked off the holiday with family at Mammoth Mountain in California before jetting back to Malibu for a friend's wedding a few days later. The couple was even spotted together in photo booth pictures shared by Jonas' younger brother Nick.\n\nDecember 7, 2016: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are confirmed to be exclusively dating\n\nShortly after their holiday weekend together, sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Jonas and Turner were officially dating — and had no plans to see anyone else.\n\n\"They're dating exclusively. He was playing the field, but he really likes her and is willing to settle down for her,\" the source shared.\n\nDays earlier, Jonas was spotted on a stroll with Turner's parents as they enjoyed an afternoon outing in London. Later that day, Jonas and Turner were captured sharing a kiss.\n\nJanuary 1, 2017: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner make things Instagram official\n\nTurner and Jonas kicked off 2017 in a big way by making their social media debut. On Instagram, Turner posted a photo of Jonas riding on the back of a boat while smoking a cigar. She simply captioned the snap, \"Miami daze.\"\n\nJuly 25, 2017: Sophie Turner opens up about their relationship for the first time\n\nAfter more than half a year of dating, Turner opened up in an interview with Marie Claire UK about her relationship with Jonas for the first time. While she said she was \"very happy,\" she added how difficult it could be to date while in the public eye.\n\n\"You do feel like you're living in a fishbowl! It's frustrating [that] it's the most mundane things that make the news — how boring! There are really no other headlines?\" Turner said when asked about the relationship.\n\nSeptember 2017: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner adopt their dog Porky\n\nIn September 2017, Jonas and Turner expanded their family with the addition of a Siberian Husky puppy named Porky Basquiat. Turner shared the news in an Instagram post, writing, \"Meet the newest addition to the krew @porkybasquiat 🐶\"\n\nJust a few months later, the couple also brought home Porky's brother Waldo Picasso.\n\nOctober 15, 2017: Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas announce their engagement\n\nAbout a year after the couple first began dating, Jonas and Turner announced they were engaged. In matching Instagram posts, they shared a photo of Turner's hand with her engagement ring on display. Jonas captioned the image, \"She said yes,\" while Turner fittingly wrote, \"I said yes.\"\n\nThe couple received an outpouring of support from their famous friends and family, including Jonas' brother Nick, who wrote, \"Ahh! Congratulations to my brother… and sister in law to be on your engagement. I love you both so much.\"\n\nApril 11, 2018: Sophie Turner opens up about being engaged\n\nIn April 2018, Turner got candid about her engagement to Jonas, explaining that it was a different kind of fulfillment than having success in her career.\n\n\"It's lovely to be engaged. Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person, like I'd find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There's a sense of peace that comes with finding your person. But there's a drive that comes with your career,\" she shared.\n\nOctober 3, 2018: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner make their red carpet debut\n\nJonas and Turner finally made their red carpet debut in October 2018 at the Louis Vuitton show during Paris Fashion Week. The couple posed in ​​chic color-coordinated gray and black looks, and Turner even shared a snap from inside the event.\n\n\"With my love in Paris,\" she captioned the image.\n\nDecember 2018: Sophie Turner hosts the Jonas family for Christmas in England\n\nIn late 2018, the engaged couple spent the holiday season in London alongside the entire Jonas family — including newlyweds Nick and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. The festivities included a holiday meal at the Turner household, which was documented on Instagram.\n\n\"​​Family,\" Turner captioned the photo, where she could be seen sitting around a table with her parents as well as the Chopra and Jonas families.\n\nMarch 7, 2019: Sophie Turner opens up about how Joe Jonas helped her find her happiness\n\nIn March 2019, Turner got candid in a cover story for Glamour UK about finding happiness following an \"identity crisis\" as a teenager. She explained that after growing up faster than she probably should have, Jonas helped her find herself again.\n\n\"A lot of [my happiness now] is to do with being with a person I've fallen in love with, who loves me more than he loves himself, and who wants to see me find my own happiness. That was probably the biggest thing that pushed me to find who I am — and find my happiness in things other than acting,\" she shared.\n\nMarch 1, 2019: Sophie Turner stars in the Jonas Brothers' music video for \"Sucker\"\n\nLater that month, Turner starred in the Jonas Brothers' video for \"Sucker\" alongside Kevin Jonas' wife Danielle and Nick Jonas' wife Priyanka. Turner later said during an interview with USA Today that making the video was \"a lot more chaotic\" than any of her other acting projects.\n\n\"[With Game of Thrones] you have to be done with this scene by a certain time and you have to say these words and stand at exactly these spots, because otherwise it wouldn't work. Whereas with a music video, it's just much more kind of free and loose and improvisational,\" she explained.\n\nMay 1, 2019: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner tie the knot in Las Vegas\n\nThat same month, Jonas and Turner surprised fans when they tied the knot in a last-minute wedding at the famed A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. The couple walked down the aisle just hours after the Billboard Music Awards — and brought many of their famous friends along for the affair. While Diplo live-streamed the wedding on his Instagram, Dan + Shay provided the musical entertainment. The couple even sealed the deal with Ring Pop wedding rings.\n\n\"We had to get legally married in the states, so we thought it'd be really fun to get all of our friends, invite them out, and do an impromptu wedding. And we actually had some people that I didn't really even know that well there,\" Jonas later revealed to GQ.\n\nWhile Jonas' brothers Nick and Kevin were there to witness the nuptials, he admits that the whole thing \"blew up\" in his face because he later realized he had forgotten to tell his parents about the surprise wedding.\n\nJune 29, 2019: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner get married again in France\n\nJust a month after their Vegas wedding, Jonas and Turner jetted to France for their official ceremony and celebration. The extravagant but private affair was held at Le Château de Tourreau in Sarrians, France, and only the couple's closest family and friends were in attendance. Guests included Jonas' brothers, who served as groomsmen, as well as Turner's Game of Thrones costar Maisie Williams, who was her maid of honor.\n\nFollowing the wedding, Jonas and Turner remained coy about the event and chose to only share one photo with the public at the time.\n\nJune 2020: Sophie Turner is photographed with a baby bump\n\nIn June 2020, Turner was spotted with a growing baby bump while out with Jonas in Los Angeles. While they never formally announced the pregnancy, a source told PEOPLE that same month that the couple was busy prepping for the birth of their first child.\n\n\"They are definitely preparing for the baby,\" the source shared. \"She and Joe are both very happy.\"\n\nJuly 22, 2020: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner welcome their daughter Willa\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Turner gave birth to the couple's first child. They waited several days to make an official announcement about the baby girl, with their reps telling PEOPLE in a statement, \"Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas are delighted to announce the birth of their baby.\"\n\nWhile they didn't share the little girl's name at the time, TMZ reported that the new parents named their daughter Willa.\n\nSept. 27, 2020: Sophie Turner shares photos from her pregnancy\n\nTwo months after welcoming their daughter, Turner shared a series of photos from her pregnancy. In one snap, the actress could be seen showing off her bump while in the pool with one of the couple's dogs, while another picture showed Jonas placing his hand on Turner's stomach.\n\nJune 29, 2021: Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas post never-before-seen pictures from their wedding\n\nOn the couple's second wedding anniversary, they finally shared photos from their wedding weekend in France. On Instagram, both Turner and Jonas posted pictures from inside the lavish affair, which appeared to include a DJ set from Diplo, a performance from the Jonas Brothers and one very large wedding cake.\n\n\"The best two years of my life. Love you @sophiet,\" Jonas wrote on Instagram, while Turner penned, \"2 years as your wife holy moly I love you bub.\"\n\nMay 4, 2021: Joe Jonas opens up about quarantining with Sophie Turner and Willa\n\nAlmost a year after welcoming Willa, Jonas appeared on CBS This Morning and discussed how \"amazing\" it had been to spend time with his family during quarantine.\n\n\"It's been forced time at home … I'm always moving and traveling and touring. And to be in one place for a solid amount of time and just have my feet on the ground and be with my immediate family, is time I don't think I'll get back. I'm so thankful and grateful,\" Jonas shared.\n\nSeptember 2021: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner move to Miami\n\nShortly after selling their Los Angeles home, Jonas and Turner picked up their small family and moved to Miami — although Turner later told Elle UK she would ultimately like to live in England.\n\n\"We're very lucky to live in Miami. We have good weather and live by the water,\" she shared, adding, \"I really love living in America but, for my mental health, I have to be around my friends and my family. And also for my daughter – I would love her to get the education and school life that I was so lucky to have. England would ideally be the final destination, but [Joe] might take quite a bit of convincing!\"\n\nOctober 25, 2021: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner celebrate the 5th anniversary of their first date\n\nIn October 2021, Jonas shared a sweet montage on TikTok to commemorate the five-year anniversary of meeting Turner for the first time.\n\nIn the video, the couple could be seen celebrating the milestone with a night out while \"Hesitate,\" the song Jonas wrote for Turner, played in the background.\n\nMay 2, 2022: Sophie Turner shows off her baby bump at the Met Gala with Joe Jonas\n\nIn May 2022, the couple stepped out on the Met Gala red carpet together.

While speaking about her love of being a mother with Elle UK, Turner revealed that the couple was getting ready for the arrival of a new addition.\n\n\"It's what life is about for me — raising the next generation. The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We're so excited to be expanding the family. It's the best blessing ever,\" she shared.\n\nJune 15, 2022: Joe Jonas says he's \"excited\" about being a dad again\n\nDuring PEOPLE's cover story with the Jonas Brothers, the singer briefly opened up about becoming a dad again.\n\n\"You really don't know what to expect.

I'm still trying to figure it out. Some weeks are a little bit more challenging than others, but it makes it a lot easier when you enjoy your gig … I wake up every day just thrilled to be able to go make music or act and create different projects and have a beautiful family, so it feels like a dream come true.\"\n\nNovember 11, 2022: Joe Jonas explains why he keeps his marriage to Sophie Turner private\n\nIn an interview with MR PORTER, Jonas shared why he avoids talking about his relationship with Turner.\n\n\"I want to feel like an open book,\" he told the publication. \"But when we started dating, I realized that I didn't have a ton of stuff that was just for me. And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.\"\n\nJanuary 30, 2023: Sophie Turner supports Joe Jonas at Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony\n\nTurner, who was dressed in a fiery red ensemble, sat front row to watch the Jonas Brothers receive their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEach brother was given an opportunity to speak — and Jonas made sure to give his wife a special shout-out.\n\n\"Sophie, what up homie. You're my partner in crime. You keep me motivated and inspired every day. I strive to be as cool as you,\" he said. \"You got any plans after this?\"\n\nThe couple's two daughters weren't present for the event but Jonas made sure to mention them during his time at the podium.\n\n\"To my little ones at home, Daddy loves you to the moon and back,\" he said.\n\nSeptember 5, 2023: Joe Jonas files for divorce from Sophie Turner\n\nDocuments obtained by PEOPLE confirmed that Jonas filed for divorce in Miami, with the file claiming \"the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.\"\n\nThe file also confirmed the former couple have a prenup in place.\n\nSeptember 6, 2023: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner release a statement about their divorce\n\nJonas and Turner opened up about their split in a joint Instagram post.\n\n“After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” the statement read. “There are many speculative narratives as to why, but truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children,\"\n\nSeptember 9, 2023: Joe Jonas addresses rumors surrounding his divorce\n\nWhile on stage during a Jonas Brothers show in Los Angeles, Jonas seemed to address his split from Turner.\n\nBefore singing the group's song \"Hesitate,\" which was inspired by Turner, Jonas opened up to the crowd. \"It's been a crazy week,\" he said.\n\n\"I just want to say, if you don't hear it from these lips, don't believe it. Okay?\" he added. \"Thank you, everyone, for the love and support to me and my family. I love you guys.\"\n\nSeptember 21, 2023: Sophie Turner sues Joe Jonas to have their children returned to England\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in a Manhattan court on Sept. 21, 2023, and obtained by PEOPLE, Turner requested for her two daughters to be returned to England. The suit against Jonas calls for \"the immediate return of children wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained\" that began on Sept. 20, according to Turner's legal team.\n\nThe documents claim that the former couple agreed to have England as their \"forever home\" and were in the process of buying a house in the English countryside in April after selling a Miami property. During this time, Turner began filming the Joan miniseries and reportedly agreed to have their kids accompany Jonas on tour because he had more daytime hours for them, though she had \"hesitation\" about the \"temporary arrangement.\"\n\nAfter Jonas filed for divorce on Sept. 5, Turner \"reiterated\" the plan to move to England but on Sept. 19, Jonas' attorney allegedly confirmed to Turner's legal team that he wouldn't be turning over the passports nor give consent for the move.\n\nThe suit states, \"The Father has possession of the children’s passports. He refuses to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother.\"\n\nJonas responded to Turner's suit the same day, calling Turner's claim he is withholding their daughters' passports \"misleading.\" A representative for the musician said in a statement, \"This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending. When language like 'abduction' is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst. The children were not abducted.\"\n\nOctober 28, 2023: Sophie Turner is seen kissing a new man amid divorce from Joe Jonas\n\nTurner was photographed kissing British aristocrat Peregrine \"Perry\" Pearson in Paris. They were also spotted at the final match of the men's Rugby World Cup with a group of friends.\n\nJanuary 17, 2024: Sophie Turner drops \"wrongful retention\" claims against Joe Jonas\n\nIn court documents obtained by PEOPLE, a judge approved Turner's filing to dismiss the \"wrongful retention\" claims she made against Jonas \"with prejudice, and without attorneys’ fees, expenses, costs and/or disbursements awarded to either party.\" The news came after their parenting agreement had been approved in the U.K. on Jan. 11.\n\nMarch 18, 2024: Sophie Turner asks judge to \"re-activate\" her divorce from Joe Jonas\n\nTwo months later, Turner asked a judge to \"re-activate\" her divorce case with Jonas, according to court documents that were filed by her attorneys in Miami-Dade County, and obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nThe papers stated that \"the abatement has come to an end and this case is to be re-activated.”\n\nA rep for Jonas told PEOPLE, \"The filing was a legal formality, and the couple continues to negotiate an amicable resolution.\"\n\nMay 15, 2024: Sophie Turner says parenting criticism after divorce news \"hurt\"\n\nIn an interview with British Vogue, Turner said that she was on set filming Joan in the U.K. and apart from her kids, who were in the U.S., when \"all these articles started coming out.\"\n\n\"It hurt because I really do completely torture myself over every move I make as a mother — mom guilt is so real!\" she said. \"I just kept having to say to myself, 'None of this is true. You are a good mum and you've never been a partier.' \""
