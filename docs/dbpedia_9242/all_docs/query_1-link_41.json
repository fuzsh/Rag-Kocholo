        "text": "Joseph Adam \"Joe\" Jonas (born August 15, 1989) is an American singer, musician, actor and dancer. He shares the lead singer role with his younger brother Nick of the Jonas Brothers, a pop-rock band made up of him and his two brothers, Nick and Kevin. He starred as Joseph Lucas in the Disney Channel original series Jonas.\n\nJoseph Adam Jonas was born in Casa Grande, Arizona. He is the son of Denise (n√©e Miller), a former sign language teacher and singer, and Paul Kevin Jonas, Sr., a songwriter, musician and former ordained minister at an Assemblies of God church. He is of Irish (from his maternal grandfather), Cherokee, Italian, and German descent.\n\nIn early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. After hearing the song, \"Please Be Mine\", written and performed by all the brothers, Daylight/Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act. After being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers\"."
