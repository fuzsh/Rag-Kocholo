        "text": "News broke of Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s split in early September, and since then, the separation has taken several turns.\n\nAfter releasing an initial joint statement, the former couple have been at odds with each other on custody issues, leading to further legal disputes and shocking allegations.\n\nHere, we break down all the details.\n\nMarch 18, 2024: Sophie requests to “reactivate” divorce proceedings.\n\nTurner’s lawyers filed paperwork Miami-Dade County, Florida that stated, “The abatement has come to an end and this case is to be re-activated,” according to documents obtained by People.\n\nJanuary 17, 2024: Sophie drops her wrongful retention lawsuit.\n\nPer court documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Turner asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit she filed in September 2023, which claimed Jonas had wrongfully retained their two children by refusing to give her their passports so that they could return to the United Kingdom with her. The former couple have reportedly agreed on a new parenting plan, and the case officially closed Wednesday.\n\nOctober 11, 2023: Joe files to dismiss their divorce case in Miami.\n\nPage Six reports that Jonas filed to dismiss his petition for dissolution of marriage in Miami. In court documents obtained by the outlet, the former couple reached “various agreements” and want to “pursue an amicable resolution of all issues.”\n\nHis pursuit to dismiss the case comes shortly after the two completed a four-day mediation, during which they came to an agreement for an interim custody arrangement.\n\nThe duo affirmed the success of the mediation in a statement released to the outlet: “After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the U.K. We look forward to being great co-parents.”\n\nOctober 10, 2023: Joe and Sophie reach temporary custody agreement after mediation.\n\nThe former couple “engaged in a productive mediation” that resulted in an interim custody arrangement for their two children, according to documents obtained by People.\n\nThe two agreed to have daughters Willa, three, and Delphine, one, stay with Turner from October 9 to 21, during which time they will be allowed to travel to England and throughout the United States. Afterward, Turner or the children’s nanny will take the kids to Jonas, whom they will remain with until November 2 and who retains the same travel permissions. From there, the girls will return to Turner until November 22, head back to Jonas until December 16, and then switch again to Turner’s care until January 7.\n\nFor custody arrangements thereafter, the documents state “that the parties shall jointly submit a status report letter” before December 23, which will outline the then-current status of their mediation.\n\nOctober 3, 2023: A judge sets a trial date to determine custody of Joe and Sophie’s kids.\n\nA Manhattan judge officially set the trial date for January 2, 2024, multiple outlets reported. The trial will determine the custody agreement and living situation of their two daughters, Willa and Delphine. Turner appeared virtually for the hearing, while Jonas did not make an appearance, per Entertainment Tonight.\n\nThough the trial will not occur until next year, the couple’s lawyers revealed during the hearing that Turner and Jonas are about to enter a four-day mediation that will focus on resolving issues in their ongoing divorce, including the creation of a custody plan, according to People. Turner’s lawyer reportedly claimed in court that Jonas is “looking for … a 50-50” joint custody arrangement. The lawyer added that “the parties are both seeing their children, which is what we all want.”\n\nSeptember 25, 2023: Joe and Sophie agree to keep kids in NYC.\n\nTurner and Jonas agree to keep their two daughters in New York for the time being as they continue to sort out their custody agreement, per documents filed on Monday and obtained by People.\n\nSeptember 21, 2023: Joe talks about parenthood onstage at a tour stop.\n\nHours after Turner files her lawsuit against him, the Jonas Brothers perform a show at Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center. As the band prepares to perform “Little Bird”—a touching ballad that each brother dedicates to his own kids—Joe gives a shout-out to parents who might relate to the lyrics.\n\n“This next one is all about being a parent,” he says, per video footage published by fans. “We have any parents in the house? If you play a role in someone’s life, shout-out to you, too. Or, if you’re trying to [have kids], best of luck.”\n\nSeptember 21, 2023: Sophie sues Joe, claiming their children are being wrongfully detained.\n\nThe actor files a lawsuit in New York City over the “wrongful retention” of their two kids, three-year-old Willa and a one-year-old daughter referred to as D. in legal documents. In the suit, which was obtained by People, Turner alleges that the breakdown of their marriage happened “very suddenly” after an argument on August 15, and that she learned about the divorce filing “through the media” days later.\n\nThe court documents claim, “The Father has possession of the children’s passports. He refuses to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother.” (Jonas’s attorney reportedly confirmed to Turner’s team on September 19 that, not only will he not hand over the passports, he is also withholding consent for his daughters to move to England.)\n\nSeptember 6, 2023: Sources claim this was the last straw.\n\nTMZ reports that Jonas saw or heard footage of Turner doing something that was the “last straw in his decision,” before filing for divorce. The report reads: “Joe had access to a ring cam that he said captured Sophie saying and/or doing something that made him realize the marriage was over.”\n\nSeptember 6, 2023: A source said early on that Joe and Sophie intended to keep things “positive.”\n\nAn insider tells People the former couple is focused on having a “collaborative” relationship dynamic as they navigate their divorce.\n\n“People are trying to be negative towards both of them, but they are trying to keep things as positive as possible knowing there's always a lot of tension in a divorce,” the source says. “They’re two incredibly scrutinized people. This is incredibly stressful for them, but everything between them has been very collaborative.”\n\nSeptember 6, 2023: They release a joint statement.\n\nIn a joint message shared on Instagram, the couple says, “Statement from the two of us: ‘After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage. There are many speculative narratives as to why, but truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.’”\n\nSeptember 5, 2023: Joe files for divorce.\n\nThe singer files for divorce in Miami-Dade County, Florida. In public records obtained by CNN, Jonas says the marriage is “irretrievably broken.”\n\nSeptember 3, 2023: Breakup rumors emerge.\n\nTMZ reports that the couple are considering divorce, with a source telling the outlet that Turner and Jonas have had “serious problems” for at least six months. The news follows fan speculation that the pair is splitting up based on photos taken in recent weeks, in which the stars can be seen without their wedding rings.\n\nOne source tells the outlet the singer has been taking care of the pair’s children “pretty much all of the time,” as his band is touring the United States, while Turner has been filming in the United Kingdom."
