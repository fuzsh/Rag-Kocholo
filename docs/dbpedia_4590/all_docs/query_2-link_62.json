        "text": "In the early years of the Academy, requests for investigations, experiments, or reports of a scientific nature came largely from departments or agencies of the federal government that lacked research facilities; few came from federal scientific agencies. Not until 1883 did the Academy appoint its first committee to apprise itself of problems arising in federal laboratories and, as a secondary mission, to work for closer relations between the Academy and the government. 1\n\nIn 1908, the Academy was asked by Congress to prepare a plan for the reorganization and consolidation of federal laboratories, whose proliferation had resulted in a tangle of duplicated effort. It found \"nearly every department of the Government … involved to a greater or less extent\" in scientific research, and the scientific agencies so entrenched in their departments that any real consolidation had become impractical, if not impossible. The Academy could only recommend establishment of a permanent board to maintain a watch on these agencies in the government and submit its periodic findings to Congress for review. 2 That counsel was not acted upon.\n\nFrom time to time thereafter the Academy warned that the ''vast scientific effort\" in these government agencies was destined to increase in complexity and importance, and offered to provide continuing constructive criticism and advice on their operation. In 1925, Academy President A. A. Michelson formed a special committee to make a survey \"of problems of the Government closely related to the present work of the academy\" and \"to study the relation of the academy to greater problems as set up by the Government.\" 3\n\nBut the government set no problems before the Academy, great or small; and the Academy remained, as John C. Merriam said four years later, \"a potential adviser of the Government,\" constrained to \"inform itself as fully as possible regarding the role of science and research in the Government, and especially concerning its objectives, its organization, and the available means for its support … solely … [for] purposes of information for the academy itself.\" 4\n\nFederal expenditures for research agencies, which had been negligible before World War I, soared to almost 2 percent of the national budget during that conflict, only to fall below half of 1 percent in the early twenties—approximately $13 million. Less than a decade later, with postwar advances in science and technology, industrial demands on the government, and the consequent expansion of its scientific agencies, federal research funds were slightly over 1 percent of the total budget, amounting almost to $40 million. 5\n\nWith the onset of the Depression in 1931, President Hoover decreed economies at all levels of the federal establishment, including its research agencies. The Economy Act of June 1932 called for further cuts, as well as reduction of all government salaries by more than 8 percent. 6 A year later the new Roosevelt Administration, promising rigid economy in federal expenditures in order to fight mounting unemployment, cut bureau budgets by 25 percent and made the order retroactive by impounding current appropriations. When rumors spread that the Administration intended further slashes in the funds of federal research agencies, the Academy was at once alerted, and President William W. Campbell, noting the \"intense anxiety\" everywhere for the future of research, publicly called attention to \"the one and only purpose of the academy,\" its obligation to advise the government in just such matters, and offered its services. 7 In May 1933, having received no response to his offer, Campbell left Washington for the summer."
