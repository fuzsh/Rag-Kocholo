The family atmosphere appealed to him, and Professor Kenneth Monroe inspired him to major in history. Earning a master’s degree in African history at the University of Oregon, Harry also did graduate work at Multnomah Seminary. His plan to serve with a missionary agency in Africa fell through when they turned him down because of his youth, so he got a job with the Ethiopian government teaching high school. Undaunted by a lack of textbooks about Ethiopia, Harry wrote his own, completing both a history and a geography book about the African nation. An avid traveler, he also authored “Ethiopia: Land of Enchantment,” illustrating it with his own photographs. The book became a best-seller and led to his membership as a fellow of the Royal Geographic Society of Great Britain. When his contract with the government ended, Harry joined the Society of International Missionaries, where he met his wife, Blanche, and they raised four children in Ethiopia. Harry planted churches and founded and directed an institute that trained teachers, but his major contribution was establishing the largest private school system in Ethiopia. He worries about keeping busy now that he has retired. He intends to garden, keep up with his 11 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and travel as much as possible. At the age of 85, Harry has visited 83 countries including Indonesia, Italy and Argentina. In 2008, Harry and Blanche completed sixty years of ministry—30 years in Ethiopia and 30 years as owners of the Monterey Bible Bookstore in Monterey, Calif.

There is a quiet assurance of the triumphant grace of God reigning in a man who put his whole trust in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. His living and his dying are a simple but profound testimony echoing the apostle Paul’s declaration, “To me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.” Jonathan was one of the first elders appointed by Brother Lee in the mid-1950s in San Francisco until he moved to Sacramento around 1960.
