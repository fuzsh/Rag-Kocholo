        "text": "Caldecott Medal winner (above) and Newbery Medal winner (below)\n\nOn January 17, during the American Library Association (ALA) Midwinter Meeting in Boston, the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the ALA, announced the winners of the prestigious Caldecott and Newbery awards for children's works published in the U.S. during 2004. Kevin Henkes' Kitten's First Full Moon (Greenwillow Books, a HarperCollins imprint), a title selected by independent booksellers in May 2004 as a Children's Summer Book Sense Pick, won the Caldecott Medal for illustration. Cynthia Kadohata's Kira-Kira (Atheneum Books for Young Readers, a Simon & Schuster imprint) was awarded the Newbery Medal, which recognizes a distinguished contribution to American literature for children.\n\nHenkes' award marks Greenwillow's first ever Caldecott Medal, according to Josette Kurey, senior manager for publicity, HarperCollins Children's Books. \"We are thrilled beyond belief,\" she told BTW. \"We are not quite over the shock and craziness of it. This couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.\"\n\nAt Atheneum, Kira-Kira editor Caitlyn Dlouhy tried to describe the \"indescribable.\" Also the executive editor for Atheneum's Books for Young Readers, Dlouhy had seen Kira-Kira, Kadohata's story of Japanese-American sisters set in the American South of the 1950s and '60s, go through \"rewrite after rewrite, to make it as strong as it could be. To realize that other people believe in a book that you believe in so deeply, it's incredible. My head is spinning.\"\n\nBoth houses indicated to BTW that the books were reprinted in mass numbers as soon as the awards were announced. No problems are anticipated for delivery to stores. According to Josette Kurey, senior manager of publicity, HarperCollins Children's Books, the first print for Kitten's First Full Moon was 60,000, and the reprint on Monday was 150,000.
