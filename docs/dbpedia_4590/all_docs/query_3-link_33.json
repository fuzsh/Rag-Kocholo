        "text": "Cavendish physicists have discovered two new ways to improve organic semiconductors. They found a way to remove more electrons from the material than previously possible and used unexpected properties in an environment known as the non-equilibrium state, boosting its performance for use in electronic devices. Transport in...\n\nA major new research hub led by the University of Cambridge and UCL aims to harness quantum technology to improve early diagnosis and treatment of disease. Q-BIOMED will be delivered by an outstanding team of researchers from academia, the NHS, charities, government and industry to exploit quantum-enhanced advances for...\n\nThe annual Mark Warner Prize for talented theoretical physicists has been awarded to Ziyou Lu for his outstanding work in Experimental and Theoretical Physics in Part II (3rd year) of the Natural Sciences Tripos. The level of mathematics required for the theoretical physics courses are higher than the other courses, but I...\n\nThe completion and handover of the Ray Dolby Centre, the new home for the Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics at the University of Cambridge, has taken place on Thursday 30th May 2024. Designed by Jestico + Whiles and completed by Bouygues UK, this state-of-the-art facility will support the Cavendish’s world-...\n\nCambridge physicists Hannah Übler and Harry Cliff are amongst the new cohort of ten emerging UK science leaders to be awarded an Ernest Rutherford Fellowship by the UKRI Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). This prestigious honour recognises the most promising early-career Particle Physics, Astronomy and...\n\nCambridge researchers have discovered that a ‘single atomic defect' in a layered 2D material can hold onto quantum information for microseconds at room temperature. This underscores the broader potential of 2D materials in advancing quantum technologies. Each new promising system will broaden the toolkit of available...\n\nResearchers based at the University of Cambridge have discovered a way to stop the quantum dance of atoms ‘seen’ by electrons in carbon-based organic molecules. This development will help improve the performance of light emitting molecules used in displays and bio-medical imaging. These molecules also have a wide range of...\n\nThe 2023-24 Photography Competition showcased a multitude of captivating images commemorating various facets of our theme, '150 years of excellence in the Cavendish'. The diverse range of submissions, covering interdisciplinary research in chemistry, Physics of Life, semiconductor physics, quantum states, and astrophysics...\n\nJesús Arjona Martínez, a PhD student, has been recognised as one of the ‘ Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe 2024’ for his current research at the Cavendish Laboratory . Martinez, part of Professor Mete Atatüre’s research group, focuses on the development of quantum communication aimed at creating perfectly secure digital...\n\nScientists at the University of Cambridge suggest molecules, vital to the development of life, could have formed from a process known as graphitisation. Once verified in the laboratory, it could allow us to try and recreate plausible conditions for life's emergence. A big part of life is simplicity. It’s order. It’s coming..."
