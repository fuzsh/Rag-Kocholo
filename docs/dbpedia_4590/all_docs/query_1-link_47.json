        "text": "Harold L. Osher & Peggy L. Osher – “As citizens we can all aspire to challenge, educate, and share with others. There are moments when we are touched deeply by selfless acts of individuals that truly benefit the community as a whole. Harold and Peggy Osher, through their many contributions and selfless acts, benefit our state and embody the finest ideals of the true spirit of community.\n\nTheir partnership in this endeavor, enduring in its nature and powerful in its impact, is beautiful to observe. Peggy and Harold complement one another. Their union is reflected in their relation­ships with their family and friends, with the community, and with this University. Our state is indeed enriched by their presence.\n\nHarold L. Osher was born in Portland and grew up in Biddeford. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Bowdoin, and continued his studies at Boston University where, as a member of the Begg Honor Society, he earned his M.D. Dr. Osher completed his residency at Boston City Hospital. While in his residency, he met Peggy Ann Liberman, a native of St. Louis, Missouri, who was then a sophomore at Wellesley. They were married in Peggy’s junior year. Harold then took a cardiology fellowship at Beth Israel Hospital as Peggy completed her degree in English literature at Wellesley. They settled in Portland, where Harold served for many years as head of cardiol­ogy at the Maine Medical Center.\n\nFor nearly thirty-five years, Harold and Peggy have provided an inspirational record of commitment and support to this community. Harold Osher has been a president and Maine director of the Ameri­can Heart Association, a Fellow and Governor of the American College of Cardiology, and recipient of the Outstanding Service Award from the Maine Heart Association and the New England Regional Heart Committee for his work in pioneering cardiac services in Maine. He has served on the USM Quincentennial and Convocation Committees, established the Osher Lecture Series and the Osher Acquisitions Fund at the Portland Museum of Art, and volunteered his service as Research Fellow in Historical Geography at the University of Southern Maine.\n\nPeggy has served as a director of United Way, the Maine Medical Center, and Key Bank. For the past 29 years she has served as a trustee of the Portland Museum of Art and currently holds the positions of co-chair for the Friends Group and chair of the Education Committee there. She has been an active and positive force in the development of United Way, Maine Medical Center, Wellesley College, the United Jewish Appeal, and other nonprofits across the region.\n\nTheir civic responsibility is matched by their generosity. They have made two extraordinary gifts to this state-the Winslow Homer Graphics Collection at the Portland Museum of Art and the outstand­ing Osher Cartographic Collection of rare, antique maps to the University of Southern Maine.\n\nWhat moves a community forward? What differentiates one community from another in terms of quality? What is at the heart of democracy? It is the dedication of citizens to a greater good, the commitment of individuals to acts beyond themselves to benefit all, with a view to the growth and advantage of others. Harold and Peggy exemplify these ideals. With these Doctor of Humane Letters de­grees, we signify to all the esteem, pride, and gratitude we feel for Harold and Peggy Osher. In a selfless and striking way they embody the true spirit of community and exemplify the true meaning of citizenship.\n\nEdward S. Godfrey – “For over 30 years, Dean Ed Godfrey has been an esteemed colleague, teacher, dean, judge, advisor, and confidante. Equally important, he is beloved and honored by leaders and citizens through­out Maine and a valued friend to a generation of Jaw students, many of whom are now practicing lawyers, judges, elected officials, and business leaders.\n\nEdward S. Godfrey is the founding dean of the University of Maine School of Law. In the School’s first decade, Dean Godfrey hired outstanding faculty and staff, built a first class law library, secured national accreditation, opened the state and regional job markets to its graduates, and established the School’s record of service to the state of Maine. With these accomplishments, he certainly is one of the important architects of public higher education in Maine and of the University of Southern Maine in particular. The immense respect in which Dean Godfrey is held by the legal and governmental communities in Maine was demonstrated by his ap­pointment as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, where he served from 1976 to 1983. His accomplishments on the Court are the subject of a symposium issue of the Spring 1995 Maine Law Review.\n\nUpon his retirement from the Court, Dean Godfrey returned to the academy. A graduate of Harvard College and Columbia Law School, he had previously held faculty appointments at Albany Law School Union University and as the Carl Hatch Professor of Law and Public Administration at the University of New Mexico. Since 1984, Ed Godfrey has graced the University of Southern Maine and the Law School with his presence as dean emeritus, maintaining an active teaching schedule, pursuing scholarly and community projects in­cluding service as chair of the Maine Labor Relations Board, and, most important, serving as an invaluable member of the faculty.”\n\nGerald E. Talbot – “For more than 30 years, Gerald E. Talbot has been a persistent advocate of civil and human rights and an outspoken opponent of racism, discrimination, and hate. Working with a broad spectrum of community leaders, he was instrumental in reviving the NAACP in Portland during the 1960s and served as the new group’s first president in 1964. Gerry Talbot reminded us all that discrimination and racism were problems everywhere, and that they needed to be recognized and addressed. He has been Maine’s conscience in the fight for civil rights and dignity for all Maine citizens.\n\nGerry Talbot was elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 1972 where he served three terms. He was the first African American to serve as legislator in the state of Maine; he has also served on the Maine State Board of Education (1979-84), the Governor’s Task Force on Human Rights (1968), the U.S. Commis sion on Civil Rights, Maine (1972-76, 1992-present), and the Port­land Community Task Force on Bias Crime. He is currently a member of the Board of Visitors of the Muskie Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Southern Maine and the Academic Affairs Committee on Minority Retention of the Faculty, Staff, and Students at the University of Maine.\n\nGerry Talbot has built a unique collection of books, papers, artifacts, and documents pertaining to the African American experi­ence and to his own family history, whose roots in Maine go back to the 1700s. On February 28, 1995, Gerry Talbot donated this collec­tion to the University of Southern Maine, thereby initiating the new African American Archives of Maine. Thanks to his generosity, the story of the African Americans who settled in Maine will be pre­served and celebrated as part of the fabric of our shared American heritage.\n\nAs a critic, Gerry Talbot has shown us the evils of discrimination and hate wherever he found them; as an activist, Gerry Talbot has worked tirelessly to make our society more just and humane; as an educator, he has brought the experience of African Americans directly to children and adults across the state. Moved by his conviction to make our society better, Gerry Talbot is an example for us all of the enduring power of each citizen. The fabric that is America is immeasurably stronger and more beautiful because of Gerry Talbot.”\n\nLois Lowry – “As a critically acclaimed writer of more than 20 children’s books, Lois Lowry presents serious issues in ways that have delighted, enter­tained, provoked, challenged, and, in tum, earned the devotion of young adult readers around the world. Lois Lowry has a special gift that allows her to see the world through a young person’s eyes. She uses this gift to create stories that engage her readers in thoughtful exploration of important concerns, to look beyond what is familiar and comfortable.\n\nThe feelings, questions, and conflicts faced by Anastasia Krupnik, the most famous character in ten of Lois Lowry’s books, have struck a particularly responsive chord in thousands of young readers. Teachers who use her books report that The Giver, which in 1994 earned Lowry her second Newbery Award, the most prestigious honor in children’s literature, provokes more class discussion than any other book they have come across in recent years. Reviewers of The Giver observed that this richly provocative novel of “”a chilling, tightly controlled future society … will haunt readers long after they turn the final page.”” Number of Stars, for which Lowry received her first Newbery Award in 1990, also is a favorite of teachers because it focuses on the Holocaust and the efforts of the Danish people to protect their Jewish citizens during the Nazi occupation in World War II. Lois Lowry also is recipient of the Boston Globe-Hom Book Award, the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award, the California Young Reader’s Medal, and the Mark Twain Award.\n\nFor the many University of Southern Maine graduates who pursued their degrees as nontraditional students and for whom literature and the humanities have enriched their lives, Lois Lowry provides an especially compelling example. She started college at Brown University but left before completing her studies to marry and raise a family. When her youngest child began school while living in Falmouth, Lowry decided to continue her own education. She enrolled at USM and graduated with a degree in literature in 1973. Before beginning her career as an author, Lowry worked as a freelance writer and photographer for the Maine Times and the Portland Press Herald. Soon her articles and photographs appeared in Down East and Yankee magazines, the New York Times and the Boston Globe. Lowry returned to campus most recently in the summer of 1994 as the keynote speaker at USM’s popular Children’s Literature Conference.\n\nA passion for writing, the unique ability to communicate with young readers, and numerous prestigious awards from critics and colleagues in her professional field are evidence of a career of exceptional excellence and accomplishment. We are doubly blessed that Lois Lowry also is an alumna of the University of Southern Maine. For her contributions to the literacy and awareness of young people, her ability to bring light into the dark corners of human experience, we award her this Doctor of Humane Letters.”\n\nHarry Sky – “When Harry Z. Sky retired in l 989 after 27 years as Rabbi of Temple Beth El in Portland, those who know him well understood that the event was more a transition or commencement exercise than the conclusion of a career. Much like the proverbial Eveready Bunny, Harry Sky just keeps going, and going, and going …. How fortunate we are that he continues to be an active teacher, scholar, and citizen. Harry Sky is a model of lifetime commitment to intellectual vitality and service to the commu­nity. Indeed, he demonstrates to all of us how to pursue each stage of our lives with purpose and vigor.\n\nA graduate of Yeshiva University and the Jewish Theological Semi­nary, and a student at the Carl Jung Institute in Switzerland, Harry Sky has held adjunct teaching appointments at USM, the University of New England, Bangor Theological Seminary, and Nasson College, and he has lectured at Bates, Bowdoin, and Colby colleges. He is the author of Meditations for the School System and Discoveries from lnner Journeys, and his sermons have appeared in Best Jewish Sermons, a collection of inspirational readings for American public schools. Harry Sky was instrumental in organizing the Portland Chapter of the NAACP, and he participated in the 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 March on Selma, Alabama. He also has served as president of lnterfaith Clergy and as a board member of the General Theological Library of Portland.\n\nOver just the past few years, Harry Sky has been the visionary advocate for and leader of USM’s Senior College, which designs programs and courses to provide the “”intellectual stimulation necessary to the vital trilogy of mind, body, and spirit.”” Because of Harry Sky, Senior College has become a very important ingredient in the lives of over 400 “”students”” in southern Maine.\n\nHarry Sky’s outlook on life is summed up in the maxim of the great rabbinic sage, Hillel, that is quoted above. Because he continues to be a valued resource for both the University community and our broader Portland community, the University of Southern Maine is pleased to award Harry Z. Sky the Doctor of Humane Letters degree.”\n\nJohn Wallach – “In 1993 John Wallach founded Seeds of Peace. This unique conflict resolution program brings together Arab and Israeli teenagers, along with other young people from war-torn regions, to the Seeds of Peace International Camp in Otisfield, Maine. At this camp, called ‘The Miracle in the Maine Woods,”” more than 1,000 teens nominated by their governments have worked together in an environment free from preju­dice, anger, and fear. Here, Israeli and Palestinian flags fly proudly beside the flags of Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Tunisia, Morocco-flags from throughout the Middle East.\n\nThrough the International Camp and follow-up programs, Seeds of Peace is educating a new generation of Middle East leaders, leaders who can work toward a future of mutual understanding. In the words of Yassir Arafat, on the opening of Jerusalem’s Seeds of Peace regional center, “”The Center is for the future of the children of Palestine and the children of Israel. We should protect and preserve it. We have to continue the peace of the brave.””\n\nJohn Wallach, who left a twenty-five year career as the Hearst Newspapers’ foreign editor to create Seeds of Peace, has attained many prestigious honors. He received two Overseas Press Club awards, The Edward Weintal Prize, and the Edwin Hood Award-the highest honor presented by the National Press Club-for his work in uncovering the Iran-Contra affair. In 1979, President Carter presented him with the Congressional Committee of Correspondents Award for his coverage of the Egyptian-Israeli Camp David Summit.\n\nAs a journalist, John Wallace built bridges of understanding that won him widespread recognition. In 1991 President Mikhail Gorbachev awarded him the highest civilian honor, the Medal of Friendship, for founding the Chautauqua Conference. In 1997, he received the Jordan­ian Legion of Honor from His Majesty King Hussein.\n\nWith his wife, Janet, he also co-authored three books about the Arab­Israeli conflict: Still Small Voices, The New Palestinians, and Arafat: In the Eyes of the Beholder, published in Hebrew, French, Geiman, Chinese, Swedish, Dutch, and Japanese. His new book, Rehumanizing the Enemy, which is the first study of the methodology of Seeds of Peace, is being published by the United States Institute of Peace.\n\nIn recognition of his distinguished career as a journalist and his passionate commitment to world peace, the University of Southern Maine is proud to present the Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters tc John Wallach, president of Seeds of Peace. “\n\nBarbro Osher – Biography to be added.\n\nBarney Osher – Biography to be added.\n\nKirk Pond – KIRK P.

He and Beth Leonard opened Gulf of Maine Books in Brunswick 38 years age as a community hub. “We saw the bookstore as central to a community of ideas,” Lawless says, in reference to the shop’s support of local and small presses, as well as the diversity of perspectives and opportunities for conversation that it offers.
