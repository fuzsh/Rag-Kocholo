        "text": "\"Lord Rutherford\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Lord Rutherfurd or Andrew Rutherford, 1st Earl of Teviot.\n\nErnest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, [7] (30 August 1871 â€“ 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand physicist who was a pioneering researcher in both atomic and nuclear physics. Rutherford has been described as \"the father of nuclear physics\",[8] and \"the greatest experimentalist since Michael Faraday\".[9] In 1908, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances.\" He was the first Oceanian Nobel laureate, and the first to perform the awarded work in Canada.\n\nQuick Facts 44th President of the Royal Society, Preceded by ...\n\nClose\n\nRutherford's discoveries include the concept of radioactive half-life, the radioactive element radon, and the differentiation and naming of alpha and beta radiation. Together with Thomas Royds, Rutherford is credited with proving that alpha radiation is composed of helium nuclei.[10][11] In 1911, he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus.[12] This was done through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering during the gold foil experiment performed by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, resulting in his conception of the Rutherford model of the atom. In 1917, he performed the first artificially-induced nuclear reaction by conducting experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles. As a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which he initially called the \"hydrogen atom\", but later (more accurately) named the proton.[13][14] He is also credited with developing the atomic numbering system alongside Henry Moseley. His other achievements include advancing the fields of radio communications and ultrasound technology."
