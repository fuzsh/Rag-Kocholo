        "text": "Nobel Prizes or Other Prizes for Highest Honors of a Field\n\nSeveral fields of human cultural and scientific development are not included in the list of Nobel Prizes, because they are neither among the prizes established as part of Alfred Nobel's will nor, in the case of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, sponsored afterwards by the Nobel Foundation. While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,[1] several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not covered by the official Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\nNobel Prize in Literature\n\nNobel Peace Prize\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.[1]\n\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. Some have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold. The distinguished prizes not conferred by the Nobel Foundation include (with the year when a prize was first awarded in brackets):\n\nJohn von Neumann Lecture Prize (1960)[2][3][4]\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss Prize (2006)1[5][6]\n\nGeorge David Birkhoff Prize (1968)2[7][8]\n\nNorbert Wiener Prize (1970)2[7][9]\n\n1: The Gauss Prize is awarded every four years to one mathematician on the occasion of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM). It was awarded for the first time at the 2006 ICM, and so far only few mathematicians have received the medal.\n\n2: The Birkhoff Prize and the Wiener Prize are both awarded jointly by AMS and SIAM. The recipient must be a member of one of the two societies. In 1967, these two prizes were established at the same time. The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting. Now they are usually awarded at joint mathematics meetings.\n\nSee also ICIAM Prizes (1999),[10] William Benter Prize in Applied Mathematics (2010).[11][12]\n\nAbel Prize (2003)[13][14][15]\n\nFields Medal (1936)1[16][17][18][6]\n\nChern Medal (2010)2[19]\n\nSalem Prize\n\nWolf Prize in Mathematics (1978)3[20][21][22]\n\n1: The Fields Medal is awarded every four years to two, three, or four mathematicians under 40 years of age on the occasion of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM).\n\n2: The Chern Medal is awarded every four years to one mathematician on the occasion of the ICM.
