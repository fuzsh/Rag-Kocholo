He was responsible for a great number of discoveries that were related to radioactivity and nuclear physics. Throughout his life he won many awards like the Nobel Prize for chemistry and the Copley Medal. He also made many discoveries. He discovered alpha and beta rays. And he created the theory that the atom is mostly empty space which Ernest Walton and John Cockroft proved correct.\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/copley-medal/ Copley Medal | Royal Society Copley Medallist 2022.
