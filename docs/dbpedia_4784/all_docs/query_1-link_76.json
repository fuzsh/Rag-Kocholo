        "text": "David Weetman\n\nDavid Weetman made 10 Betfred League 1 appearances for Cornwall last term. He scored four tries – including one each on his debut, and full debut.\n\nThe player assistant coach, who hails from Tyneside, came through the youth ranks at amateur side Cramlington Rockets before joining Newcastle Thunder.\n\nHe found opportunities limited at Kingston Park and moved to Cornwall’s divisional rivals Workington Town. Sadly, Weetman suffered a serious leg injury whilst playing for the Cumbrians against London Skolars.\n\nBut he battled back to full fitness and made a handful of loan appearances for Midlands Hurricanes in 2022.\n\nOnce his spell in France was over, Cornwall beat off stiff competition from a whole host of clubs for Weetman’s signature and the Choughs have done likewise to tie the popular Geordie down for the next two seasons.\n\nKyle Marvin\n\nKyle Marvin holds dual Canadian and British citizenship, is comfortable playing as an outside back in the centre or on the wing.\n\nHe has previously represented clubs in England and Canada, whilst also playing rugby union whilst residing in North America. Most notably, Marvin has experience in the National Conference League with Rochdale Mayfield – Cornwall’s first ever Betfred Challenge Cup opponents.\n\nJack Sander\n\nJack Sander cut his formative rugby teeth with local rugby union side Wadebridge Camels. Sander progressed from the mini and junior section through to the first team at Egloshayle before studying at Oxford University, where he first tasted rugby league.\n\nPlaying at centre, Sander represented the Dark Blues in their traditional Varsity match against Cambridge. He also represented Oxford on a European tour where they played and defeated the Polish national side.\n\nCallum Abbott\n\nCallum Abbott is the son of Cornwall RLFC head coach Mike, made his debut for the Choughs in the side’s home defeat at the hands of Oldham in August last year.\n\nIt was nearly a dream debut for Abbott as he seemed set to score a try with his first touch of the ball. However, play was pulled back for an infringement, dashing Abbott’s hopes of scoring one of the fastest debut tries in professional rugby league history.\n\nBorn in St Helens, Abbott played for amateur clubs Leigh Miners and Haydock Warriors before relocating to Cornwall.\n\nWhilst in the Duchy, Abbott has represented the Cornish Rebels and as a teenager, played for the side when they faced a St Helens academy outfit at the Totally Wicked Stadium in 2017.\n\nChristian Bannister\n\nChristian Bannister switched codes after previously being on the books of Championship rugby union side Coventry.\n\nBirmingham born, Bannister has also played for National League side Bournvillie in the 15-man game as either a second-row, or back-row forward.\n\nMorgan Punchard\n\nMorgan Punchard made his Cornwall bow against eventual third tier champions Dewsbury in June 2023, on loan from divisional rivals Hunslet.\n\nAfter performing admirably against the Rams, Cornwall’s next game was against the Parksiders, with Punchard not able to play against his parent club, under the terms of his loan agreement.\n\nHowever, the half-back wasn’t included in the Hunslet matchday 18 and before Cornwall took to the field again against London Skolars, Punchard had moved to the Mem on a permanent basis.\n\nIn total, Punchard made eight appearances for Cornwall in 2023, with 50 per cent of the matches he featured in were victories for the Choughs.\n\nDavid Weetman\n\nDavid Weetman made 10 Betfred League 1 appearances for Cornwall last term. He scored four tries – including one each on his debut, and full debut.\n\nThe player assistant coach, who hails from Tyneside, came through the youth ranks at amateur side Cramlington Rockets before joining Newcastle Thunder.\n\nHe found opportunities limited at Kingston Park and moved to Cornwall’s divisional rivals Workington Town. Sadly, Weetman suffered a serious leg injury whilst playing for the Cumbrians against London Skolars.\n\nBut he battled back to full fitness and made a handful of loan appearances for Midlands Hurricanes in 2022.\n\nOnce his spell in France was over, Cornwall beat off stiff competition from a whole host of clubs for Weetman’s signature and the Choughs have done likewise to tie the popular Geordie down for the next two seasons.\n\nDarcy Simpson\n\nDarcy Simpson can play in the second-row or centre. He made the move to Cornwall from Queensland, Australia, in December 2023.\n\nSimpson holds both an Australian and British passport and most recently, he has been playing in the Queensland Cup for Brisbane Tigers – the competition winners in 2023. He has also gained state representative honours by playing for Queensland’s under-21 side.\n\nDuring his formative rugby league years, Simpson was part of former NRL premiers North Queensland Cowboys’ regional academy.\n\nMatt Ross\n\nMatt Ross plied his trade in the third tier for London Skolars last term. Previously, Ross, a loose forward, has also played for relegated Keighley Cougars and former Super League outfit Toulouse Olympique.\n\nKeighley born, Ross has also gained representative honours with England students. And earlier this year, alongside fellow Chough Harry Boots, he played for Wales against Cumbria in a representative fixture as part of Kyle Amor’s testimonial.\n\nRoss is eligible for Wales through his Welsh father and he will be keen to get more international appearances under his belt whilst at the Memorial Ground.\n\nLiam O’Callaghan\n\nLiam O’Callaghan joined the Choughs from former divisional rivals London Skolars, who he represented in both of the past two seasons.\n\nO’Callaghan, an Ireland ‘A’ international, came through the academy system at Super League outfit London Broncos, before going on to represent hometown team Hemel Hempstead and Oxford in League 1.\n\nComfortable playing at either loose forward on in the hooking berth, O’Callaghan will add further versatility to an already exciting looking Cornwall roster for 2024."
