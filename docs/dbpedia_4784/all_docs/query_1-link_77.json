        "text": "Agree in spirit but the Vegas Golden Knights and Seattle Kraken were successful because the NHL has mechanisms for parity beyond a cost cap. They were essentially allowed their pick of players from the rosters of every other team in the league with a few protected exceptions per team and also given priority picks in the rookie entry draft. Even normal season with no expansion teams results in the worse teams getting priority exclusive rights to better prospects similar to what the AFL does. That mechanism doesn't exist in Super Rugby either.\n\nI think the issue of talent dilution would still have been a problem even if Australian rugby teams had gone with that model of expansion. The existing teams already struggled to win against their NZ counterparts and there would be a long-term imbalance in developing players up to the challenge anyway.\n\nNot a supporter of \"Shrink to Glory\" by any means but there are just so many facets to the problem.\n\nThat’s my point. Aussie, sa expansion were done poorly.\n\nOne of the problems with Super rugby expansion was it was always just a money grab with little thought of how things would work or how they related to any specific supporter base, the competition itself never really grew in value it was simply just adding content, there was never any sustainability to the whole thing, even now the problem with Super Rugby has is not enough people give a shit.\n\nWhen you had a Japanese team playing home games in Singapore against teams from South Africa you knew the gig was up, the fact that they signed off on that showed just how fucked up the whole thing had gotten.\n\nThe concept has always been smashing a square peg into a round hole, the whole thing will eventually collapse as is is doing so, the RA are in a real bind because they themselves are broke so any rescue package is simply borrowed money, to a concept that will continue to die.\n\n100%\n\nthe calls for a commissioner who could run this with a more singular vision amd\n\nFocus on actual growth fell on deaf ears cause everyone was worried about protecting their patch and lo and behold things fell apart.\n\nI don’t really know how it becomes relevant to the broader public again. Lots of hard work in the darkness for a decade. Current structure but more games.\n\nIf they aren’t trying for more games from 2025 onwards I’m completely lost as to what they are doing\n\nThey were, but they would have been manageable if done right. No more then 2 games in a row in crazy time slots.\n\nPretty hard to avoid 2 games in a row at crazy times, unless you add more travel, if you travel from NZ/Aus to SA or reverse, you have to get all your games over and done in that area. I actually didn't mind, and liked the Saffas being in comp, and to me a game played at night in Perth is as crazy a time as any played in SA.\n\nI not sure expansion was as much about money as hoping to expand game. Noone in their right mind thought Jaguares, Rebels , a couple of SA teams were going to produce a lot more money.\n\n100%\n\nthe calls for a commissioner who could run this with a more singular vision amd\n\nFocus on actual growth fell on deaf ears cause everyone was worried about protecting their patch and lo and behold things fell apart.\n\nI don’t really know how it becomes relevant to the broader public again. Lots of hard work in the darkness for a decade. Current structure but more games.\n\nIf they aren’t trying for more games from 2025 onwards I’m completely lost as to what they are doing\n\nThe problem is vested or self interest of those involved, as this is essentially glorified trial teams for each other national teams, there is no genuine push for change as for lack of a better description, the boat maybe sinking but everyone is getting paid.\n\nIf the clubs were separate private entities reliant on growth to survive the competition would have evolved a long time ago as commercial interests would have ensured that happen.\n\nBut they are essentially sub teams of each's national unions who are using this to enable them to produce test teams, it does work in NZ as it is the dominant code, but Super Rugby is barely surviving in NZ with a lack of interest (this is from a country where the game is meant to be a religion)\n\nIn Australia the whole thing has been unmitigated disaster. Rugby has so few options here as it is tied to a wage & cost structure that it just cannot generate, that is why the only option they will pursue is shrink to greatness as with self interest, everyone wants to be paid.\n\nIn the long run the demise of rugby here will come down to one thing. Without genuine domestic growth, you will slowly kill both the grassroots and the Top end.\n\nWhile I don't support a fully amateur competition, I think I would support a semi-professional one. This would still involve all the top players playing overseas and picking the Wallabies from Europe and Japan.\n\nThe Argie model and it's working pretty well. I mean all the top elite Pumas players play in Europe. There are something like 200 Argie players playing at professional level in Europe. So the Board only have to pay the wages of semi-professional teams like Pampas and Dogos and obviously the Sevens team. You save a lot of money BUT with that kind of structure you can't compite against against powerfull rugby nations like NZ, SA, France or Ireland. You would be at the same level of Wales, Scotland and Italy forever\n\nThe Argie model and it's working pretty well. I mean all the top elite Pumas players play in Europe.

Not necessarily endorsing the idea. So far, we have a Twiggy figure who wants to splash cash on the Rebels. Surely there is a PE option that can service our needs in a perceptively ethical manager (i.e. perceptions are good).\n\nnormally steer clear of ethical sponsor chat but I think SA is probably where I draw the line as I said in another chat.\n\nWould love a Melbourne Twiggy tho.\n\nSaudi Arabia in talks to buy stake in Leicester, Gloucester, Northampton and Newcastle rugby clubs\n\nExclusive: Stadium naming rights and a rugby academy in Saudi Arabia are on the cards if a deal goes through\n\nJust throwing it out there for discussion.

I also cant have the hypocrites screaming about it from their iPhone on X"
