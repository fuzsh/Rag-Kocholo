        "text": "Rugby is an exciting full-contact sport that was founded in England in 1823, when a schoolboy named William Webb-Ellis became bored with kicking a soccer ball and decided to pick up the ball and run with it. This event resulted in the formation of what was called rugby, because it was founded at Rugby School in Warwickshire. However, the sport was not formally organized in a national competition (the Rugby Football Union, or RFU) until 1871.\n\nRugby quickly took off in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, and also developed a large following in the colonies of Australia and New Zealand. However, some important socioeconomic differences began to be revealed as the game spread.\n\nYoungsters who played rugby in school were generally from upper-class families. They strictly played the game for fun, as players were not allowed to play professionally at the time.\n\nHowever, rugby players in the northern parts of England – specifically Lancashire and Yorkshire – were the common people, mainly blue-collar workers. As such, they simply couldn’t afford to take significant time off work in order to play rugby, and their teams suffered because of it. Therefore, these northerners decided to devise a scheme to get paid professionally.\n\nAs rugby began to take off in northern England, the southern amateurs didn’t like that these would-be working-class professionals up north were trying to be compensated. In 1892, the RFU disciplined Bradford and Leeds – two northern rugby clubs – for paying players who had to miss work. However, the RFU was already paying southern players who had represented England abroad, such as the 1888 rugby team that toured Australia.\n\nThe furious northerners argued that the RFU had shown blatant favoritism towards the southern clubs, as well as stacking the deck against them in games and not giving them representation on any sport-related committees. In response, the RFU banned professional rugby teams nationwide.\n\nHowever, all was not lost for the northerners, as they had created their own league in 1888, featuring a dozen teams. They called themselves the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The two sports officially separated in 1895, with the south becoming rugby union and the northerners sticking to what is now known as rugby league.\n\nSIMILARITIES BETWEEN LEAGUE AND UNION\n\nThe two codes of rugby have the same basic ideas:\n\nPlayers can run forward with the ball or kick the ball forwards, as long as it touches the ground first (a drop-kick).\n\nPlayers cannot throw or deflect the ball forwards (a knock-on) and must throw the ball backwards or sideways.\n\nPlayers can score in different ways:\n\nA try is when a player who has possession of the ball touches it down on his opponent’s in-goal area.\n\nA conversion kick occurs after a try and is very similar to an extra point attempt in American football.\n\nPlayers can also score by kicking the ball through the uprights (a penalty goal) or during gameplay (a drop goal). Again, the ball must be drop-kicked on the ground.\n\nBoth rugby league and rugby union fields are 100 meters long.\n\nBoth codes have the same tackling rules (anywhere below the shoulders) and similar penalties.\n\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN LEAGUE AND UNION\n\nRugby league features 13 players a side, while rugby union is 15-on-15.\n\nIn rugby union, a try is five points, but it is four points in rugby league. Likewise, a drop goal is worth three points in union, but only one point in league. Conversion kicks and penalty kicks are worth two points in both codes.\n\nRugby union places a large emphasis on winning possessions via mauls and scrums, when both teams fight for the ball against each other while holding their teammates tight.\n\nIn rugby union, a ruck is what happens when a player is tackled by an opposing player. The player who got tackled must let go of the ball, while his teammates push the opposing players away. However, in rugby league, the tackle is uncontested, and the player(s) who made the tackle must retreat ten meters.\n\nIn rugby union, a team has unlimited possessions and can therefore control the clock. However, in rugby league, a team has only six chances to score a try. On the sixth attempt, a player will usually kick the ball long to the other team, just like an American football punter would. This was designed by the original NRFU players in order to keep the scores close and make sure both teams had even possessions.\n\nThese rules may seem like minor differences, but the modern versions of both league and union are very different in practice. Rugby union matches are both brutal and methodical, requiring precise kicks and ball disposals, as it’s all about strategy and knowing what to do to get your team in position to score. Rugby league is much more simple and straightforward, and many American football fans who watch league on TV will be able to follow it very quickly. In order to play league, you must be quick and agile. Union is generally more physical, but also isn’t as fast-paced as league.\n\nRugby union is the de facto code played in most schools around the world, and when fans and players talk about “rugby,” they’re generally referring to union. The game is played widely around the world, as it remains a major sport in the UK, as well as in Pacific islands such as New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. The US, South Africa, Japan, France, and Ireland are some other notable nations that compete on an international scale, either in rugby union or the abbreviated form known as rugby sevens (I played both union and sevens when I was an undergrad at New Mexico State University).\n\nRugby league is more of a localized niche sport, as only a handful of countries play it. The only country where league is more popular than union is Australia, and it has a particularly large following in the states of New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nIn addition, league is widely played in southern France, New Zealand, Wales, the Pacific islands, and the northern parts of England in which it originated. League is also the national sport of both Papua New Guinea and the Cook Islands.\n\nMAJOR RUGBY LEAGUE COMPETITIONS\n\nSuper League (England/France)\n\nCastleford Tigers\n\nCatalans Dragons (France)\n\nHuddersfield Giants\n\nHull F.C.\n\nLeeds Rhinos\n\nLeigh Centurions\n\nSalford Red Devils\n\nSt Helens F.C.\n\nWakefield Trinity\n\nWarrington Wolves\n\nWidnes Vikings\n\nWigan Warriors\n\nNational Rugby League (Australia/New Zealand)\n\nBrisbane Broncos\n\nCanberra Raiders\n\nCanterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\n\nCronulla-Sutherland Sharks\n\nGold Coast Titans\n\nManly-Warringah Sea Eagles\n\nMelbourne Storm\n\nNewcastle Knights\n\nNew Zealand Warriors\n\nNorth Queensland Cowboys\n\nParramatta Eels\n\nPenrith Panthers\n\nSt George-Illawarra Dragons\n\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs\n\nSydney Roosters\n\nWests Tigers\n\nNational Rugby League (Tonga)\n\nCapital Warriors\n\nFuekafa Rabbitohs\n\nHa’akame Broncos\n\nHa’ateiho Spartans\n\nHalaloto Green Barbarians\n\nHavelu Bulldogs\n\nKolomotu’a Eagles\n\nLapaha Knights\n\nMu’a Saints\n\nNakolo Raiders\n\nSilapeluua Crusaders\n\nVaini Doves\n\nDigicel Cup (Papua New Guinea)\n\nAgmark Gurias\n\nBintangor-Goroka Lahanis\n\nEnga Mioks\n\nGulf Isapea\n\nHela Wigmen\n\nLae Snax Tigers\n\nMendi Muruks\n\nMount Hagen Eagles\n\nPort Moresby Vipers\n\nTNA Lions\n\nWaghi Tumbe\n\nVodafone Cup (Fiji)\n\nCity Stormers\n\nDavuilevu Knights\n\nDees Cees Nadera Panthers\n\nLautoka Crushers\n\nMakoi Bulldogs\n\nMalawai Sea Eagles\n\nNabua Broncos\n\nNadi Eels\n\nNamatakula Saints\n\nNamotomoto Raiders\n\nNaviago Sharks\n\nPolice Sharks\n\nSabeto Roosters\n\nSaru Dragons\n\nNational Competition (New Zealand)\n\nAkarana Falcons\n\nCanterbury Bulls\n\nCanterbury Development Team\n\nCounties Manukau Stingrays\n\nSouthland Rams\n\nTaranaki Sharks\n\nWaikato\n\nWellington Orcas\n\nCook Islands Rugby League\n\nAitutaki Sharks\n\nArorangi Bears\n\nAvatiu Eels\n\nNgatangiia-Matavera Sea Eagles\n\nTakuvaine Warriors\n\nTitikaveka Bulldogs\n\nTupapa Panthers\n\nMAJOR RUGBY UNION COMPETITIONS\n\nPremiership Rugby (England)\n\nBath\n\nBristol\n\nExeter Chiefs\n\nGloucester\n\nHarlequin\n\nLeicester Tigers\n\nNewcastle Falcons\n\nNorthampton Saints\n\nSale Sharks\n\nSaracens\n\nWasps\n\nWorcester Warriors\n\nSuper Rugby (Australia/New Zealand/South Africa/Argentina/Japan)\n\nBlues (New Zealand)\n\nBrumbies (Australia)\n\nBulls (South Africa)\n\nCheetahs (South Africa)\n\nChiefs (New Zealand)\n\nCrusaders (New Zealand)\n\nForce (Australia)\n\nHighlanders (New Zealand)\n\nHurricanes (New Zealand)\n\nJaguares (Argentina)\n\nKings (South Africa)\n\nLions (South Africa)\n\nRebels (Australia)\n\nReds (Australia)\n\nStormers (South Africa)\n\nSunwolves (Japan)\n\nWaratahs (Australia)\n\nTop 14 (France)\n\nAviron Bayonnais\n\nUnion Bordeaux Bègles\n\nCA Brive\n\nCastres Olympique\n\nASM Clermont Auvergne\n\nFC Grenoble\n\nLyon OU\n\nMontpellier Hèrault\n\nSection Paloise\n\nRacing 92\n\nStade Rochelais\n\nStade Français Paris\n\nRC Toulonnais\n\nStade Toulousain\n\nRugby Football Union (England)\n\nBedford Blues\n\nBristol\n\nCornish Pirates\n\nDoncaster Knights\n\nEaling Trailfinders\n\nHartpury College\n\nJersey Reds\n\nLondon Scottish\n\nNottingham\n\nRichmond\n\nRotherham Titans\n\nYorkshire Carnegie\n\nAll-Ireland League\n\nBallynahinch\n\nBallymena\n\nBanbridge\n\nBuccaneers\n\nClontarf\n\nCork Constitution\n\nDolphin\n\nDublin University\n\nGarryowen\n\nLansdowne\n\nNaas\n\nOld Belvedere\n\nOld Wesley\n\nShannon\n\nSt Mary’s College\n\nTerenure College\n\nUCC\n\nUCD\n\nUL Bohemians\n\nYoung Munster\n\nCurrie Cup (South Africa)\n\nBlue Bulls\n\nBoland Cavaliers\n\nBorder Bulldogs\n\nEastern Province Kings\n\nFalcons\n\nFree State Cheetahs\n\nGolden Lions\n\nGriffons\n\nGriquas\n\nLeopards\n\nPumas\n\nSharks\n\nSWD Eagles\n\nWestern Province\n\nPro12 (Italy/Scotland/Wales)\n\nAironi (Italy)\n\nBorder Reivers (Scotland)\n\nCeltic Warriors (Wales)\n\nBridgend (Wales)\n\nCaerphilly (Wales)\n\nCardiff (Wales)\n\nEbbw Vale (Wales)\n\nLlanelli (Wales)\n\nNeath (Wales)\n\nNewport (Wales)\n\nPontypridd (Wales)\n\nSwansea (Wales)\n\nNational Rugby Championship (Australia)\n\nBrisbane City\n\nCanberra Vikings\n\nCountry Eagles\n\nMelbourne Rising\n\nPerth Spirit\n\nQueensland Country\n\nSydney Rays\n\nWestern Sydney Rams\n\nMitre 10 Cup (New Zealand)\n\nAuckland\n\nBay of Plenty\n\nCanterbury\n\nCounties Manukau\n\nHawke’s Bay\n\nManawatu\n\nNorth Harbour\n\nNorthland\n\nOtago\n\nSouthland\n\nTaranaki\n\nTasman\n\nWaikato\n\nWellington\n\nDigicel Cup (Fiji)\n\nLautoka\n\nMacuata\n\nNadi\n\nNadroga\n\nNaitasiri\n\nNamosi\n\nNavosa\n\nNorthland\n\nOvalau\n\nRewa\n\nSuva\n\nTavua"
