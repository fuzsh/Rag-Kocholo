Nine clubs competed for the first premiership and the Royal Agricultural Society Challenge Shield, culminating in a grand final between Eastern Suburbs and South Sydney.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Teams\n\n3 Season summary\n\n4 Ladder\n\n4.1 Ladder progression\n\n5 Finals\n\n5.1 Final\n\n6 Statistics\n\n6.1 Points\n\n6.2 Tries\n\n7 Footnotes\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\nHistory\n\nEarly in the 20th century in Sydney, the game of rugby football was contested in competitions that were affiliated with the Rugby Football Union based in England. Only a decade earlier, a breakaway version of rugby had begun in England, with the Northern Rugby Football Union being formed as a direct consequence. The reasons for this split were ultimately based around the fact that clubs had wanted to compensate their players for time away from work due to injuries and travelling. After the Rugby Football Union denied the clubs' requests for compensation, many northern English clubs split away from the Rugby Football Union and entered a new competition, which implemented gradual rule changes to the rugby game in an attempt to make a more attractive game for crowds. When crowd numbers started to rise, clubs were able to afford to pay players benefits as a direct result of increased gate takings. This new game was known as rugby league.\n\nIn 1906 in Sydney, crowd numbers for rugby matches began to increase significantly following the emergence of special player, Dally Messenger, whose individual skill was considered a pleasure to watch. It was around this time that the discontent of players with their rugby clubs for continually failing to shift away from the amateur culture of the Rugby Football Union was starting to show. Even though bigger crowds had brought increased revenue to the game, players ended up failing to see any of the increased revenue going back to them. But in the latter half of 1907 and unknown to the general public, Dally Messenger secretly agreed to sign on to play in a professional rugby competition that would start the following year, run by the New South Wales Rugby Football League. It would turn out to be Messenger's popularity that would ensure the success of the new competition.\n\nOn 8 August 1907 a group of leading rugby players and supporters met at Bateman's Hotel, George Street, Sydney and resolved to form the New South Wales Rugby Football League.[2] Early in 1908, a number of Rugby Football Union clubs held meetings across Sydney and Newcastle to decide whether or not breakaway clubs should be formed in preparation for the new Rugby Football League's premiership that was to start in the following months. The popularity amongst players in support of the new competition was overwhelming, with only some players deciding to continue playing in the traditional amateur Rugby Football Union competition. The Rugby Football League clubs that were formed were essentially breakaway clubs, and in most instances, teams continued the use of their team colours into the new competition. A key aspect of the new code was that players would be paid for playing the game. Adopting the playing rules of the rebel Northern Union of England, the new competition began in earnest in Australia on Easter Monday, 20 April 1908.\n\nTeams\n\nEight teams contested the first round of the season; seven teams from Sydney and one team from Newcastle. Another Sydney team, Cumberland, joined the competition in the second round, making it Nine teams in total.\n\nBalmain, formed on 23 January 1908 at Balmain Town Hall\n\nCumberland, formed on 20 April 1908 at Horse and Jockey Hotel, Homebush\n\nEastern Suburbs, formed on 24 January 1908 at Paddington Town Hall\n\nGlebe, formed on 9 January 1908\n\nNewcastle, formed on 8 February 1908 at Pike's Rooms, Bolton Street, Newcastle\n\nNewtown, formed on 14 January 1908\n\nNorth Sydney, formed on 7 February 1908\n\nSouth Sydney, formed on 17 January 1908 at Redfern Town Hall\n\nWestern Suburbs, formed on 4 February 1908\n\nThe jerseys of the 9 teams for the 1908 season are shown below.\n\nBalmain Cumberland Eastern Suburbs Glebe Newcastle Newtown North Sydney South Sydney Western Suburbs\n\nSeason summary\n\nAll four games of the premiership's opening round were played on 20 April 1908. Two games were held at Wentworth Park and the other two at Birchgrove Oval. In total, 3000 people attended at each venue for the back-to-back matches, with Glebe, Balmain, South Sydney and Eastern Suburbs winning their respective matches over Newcastle, Western Suburbs, North Sydney and Newtown. In all, ten regular-season rounds were played, to be followed by two semi-finals and then a final.\n\nThe season was a financial disaster for the New South Wales Rugby Football League. The competition had a distinct lack of star players, was hurt by a number of refereeing problems and suffered from a lack of exposure from the conservative press. Many players who had switched over from rugby union were sacked from their weekday jobs and were no longer allowed to enter the Sydney Cricket Ground, home of the New South Wales Rugby Union. The five captains that had moved from rugby union were also publicly ostracised.\n\nThe season's highest crowd came in the second round when South Sydney beat Cumberland in front of 20,000 people. Due to Cumberland having just been admitted into the premiership, this match was played 2 weeks after the other 3 games of round 2 had been completed. South Sydney consequently played their second match of the \"round\" because of this.\n\nAt the end of the season, Eastern Suburbs' Horrie Miller was the competition's top points scorer and top try scorer.\n\nLadder\n\nTeam Pld W D L B PF PA PD Pts 1 South Sydney 9 8 0 1 1 194 53 +141 18 2 Eastern Suburbs 9 8 0 1 1 183 90 +93 18 3 Glebe 9 7 0 2 1 106 63 +43 16 4 North Sydney 9 6 0 3 1 155 66 +89 14 5 Newcastle 9 4 0 5 1 151 116 +35 10 6 Balmain 9 3 1 5 1 86 113 -27 9 7 Cumberland[3] 8 1 0 7 2 38 191 -153 6 8 Newtown 9 1 1 7 1 70 148 -78 5 9 Western Suburbs 9 1 0 8 1 47 190 -143 4\n\nLadder progression\n\nTeam 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 South Sydney 2 6[4] 6 6[4] 8 10 12 14 16 18 2 Eastern Suburbs 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 14 16 18 3 Glebe 2 4 6 8 10 10 12 14 16 16 4 North Sydney 0 2 4 4 6 6 8 10 12 14 5 Newcastle 0 2 4 6 6 8 8 10 10 10 6 Balmain 2 2 3 3 5 7 7 7 7 9 7 Cumberland[3] – 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 4 8 Newtown 0 0 1 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 9 Western Suburbs 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 4 4\n\nFinals\n\nThe competition was decided on which side had the most premiership points at the end of the year. After the regular season had completed, the top four teams played an extra round in order break the deadlock between South Sydney and Eastern Suburbs which both ended up on 18 points. After these two teams won their respective semi-finals, a final was played. South Sydney overcame a depleted Eastern Suburbs side to take away the inaugural premiership.\n\nSemi-finals Final 15 August 1908 - Agricultural Eastern Suburbs 23 North Sydney 10 29 August 1908 - Agricultural South Sydney 14 Eastern Suburbs 12 15 August 1908 - Wentworth South Sydney 16 Glebe 3\n\nFinal\n\nSouth Sydney Position Eastern Suburbs Webby Neil FB Bill King Frank Storie WG W.

Cochrane SR Ted Briscoe Harry Butler LK Bob Mable Arthur Hennessy Coach\n\nBoth teams were weakened by the absence of players selected to travel to England on the first Kangaroo tour.[5]\n\nThe following is a report from The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on the final between South Sydney and Eastern Suburbs.\n\n\"The final match to determine the premiership in the first grade of the Rugby League was played on the Agricultural Society's Ground on Saturday in perfect weather. The match was shorn of much interest on account of prominent members of both teams being absent, on their way to England. In accordance with the League rules, one-third of the profits of the match will be devoted to charity. The game, which was brilliant, and at times rather rough, resulted in a victory for South Sydney by 14 points to 12. The winners deserved their victory.\n\nSouth Sydney lost the toss, and kicked off from the southern end, an easterly wind blowing across the ground, and the sun shining strongly against them. Play hummed from the beginning. South Sydney having the better of matters, the forwards putting in splendid work. Getting the ball from the scrum repeatedly, South Sydney's backs executed several brilliant bursts, but the tackling of their opponents was very safe. However, they broke through once, Conlin making a beautiful feinting run, and then passing to Senior, on the wing, the latter scoring a pretty try.\n\nImmediately afterwards Herb Brackenrigg kicked a penalty goal for Eastern Suburbs. South Sydney now attacked strongly, and appeared likely to score, but Horrie Miller, intercepting a yard or so from his own line, raced the whole length of the ground and scored a beautiful try behind the posts. Brackenrigg converted, making the scores 7 points to 6 in favour of Eastern Suburbs.\n\nOn resuming South Sydney obtained the upper hand, forwards and backs playing brilliantly. They made repeated dashes, but could not break through for a long time. Once Storie got across, but was tackled. Then the three-quarters made fine dashes on either wing. From the last of these, which ended on the line, Golden scored a try, which Green failed to convert. Just before half time, Edward Fry marked at Eastern Suburb’s 25, and Conlin kicked a fine goal, South Sydney leading by 8 points to 7.\n\nThe second half proved exciting from start to finish, Eastern Suburbs at first attacked and South Sydney got out of the difficulty by forcing. South Sydney now became aggressive, the three-quarters combining very neatly. They repeatedly penetrated the defence, but could not put the finishing touch to the movements for some time. At length Levison obtained a scrum and passed to Conlin, on the wing. The latter dashed for the line, and scored. The kick at goal failed. South Sydney 11 points to 7.\n\nEastern Suburbs put in fine work. Dan Frawley and Brackenrigg dribbling almost to the line. Then McNamara dropped a field goal from centre, which reduced South Sydney's lead to 2 points. McNamara almost repeated the performance a few minutes later, South Sydney rallied, and Levison getting from a scrum at the 25 passed in to Butler, who scored. The kick at goal failed.\n\nPlay now became very rough, several players being knocked out temporarily, and the referee had to administer cautions. Near time, Eastern Suburbs came with a rush, and Miller scored a good try, which Brackenrigg failed to convert.\n\nThere was no further scoring, South Sydney winning by 14 points to 12.\"\n\n14\n\nSouth Sydney Tries Senior, Golden, Conlin, Butler Goals Conlin 1/4 Field Goals\n\n12\n\nEastern Suburbs Tries Miller 2 Goals Brackenreg 2/2 Field Goals McNamara\n\nStatistics\n\nPoints\n\nPlayer Team P T G FG Pts 1 Horrie Miller Eastern Suburbs 15 1 0 47 2 Herb Brackenreg Eastern Suburbs 2 17 0 40 3 Arthur Butler South Sydney 6 11 0 40 4 Stan Carpenter Newcastle 2 16 0 38 5 Albert Conlon Glebe 1 17 0 37 6 Dick Green South Sydney 6 8 0 34 7 Harry Glanville North Sydney 2 14 0 34 8 Alf Latta Balmain 4 10 0 32 9 Bill Bailey Newcastle 9 1 0 29 10 Jack Scott Newtown 5 6 0 27\n\nTries\n\nPlayer Team P T 1 Horrie Miller Eastern Suburbs 15 2 Bill Bailey Newcastle 9 3 Daniel Frawley Eastern Suburbs 8 4 Dick Green South Sydney 6 4 Harry Butler South Sydney 6 4 Arthur Butler South Sydney 6 4 Frank Storie South Sydney 6 4 Tommy Anderson South Sydney 6 4 Billy Cann South Sydney 6\n\nReferences\n\nWhiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian (2006) The History of Rugby League Clubs, New Holland, Sydney\n\nRugby League Tables - Notes The World of Rugby League\n\nRugby League Tables - Season 1908 The World of Rugby League\n\nPremiership History and Statistics RL1908\n\nSouth Sydney Claim Rugby League Title RL1908\n\nNew South Wales Competitions 1908 The Vault\n\nHistory - Introduction North Sydney Bears"
