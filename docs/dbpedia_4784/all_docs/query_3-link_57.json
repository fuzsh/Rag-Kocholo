        "text": "FRIENDSHIP — Esther Mae (Lash) Lane, 94, has passed to a new life and hope in Jesus Christ, her Lord and Savior, in the early morning hours of August 5, 2024 at Chase Point in Damariscotta, Maine. Born in Friendship on August 31, 1929, Esther was one of fourteen children born to Robert and Levilda Carter Lash.\n\nShe is survived by her only brother, Philip and wife Janice Lash; sisters-in-law, Lucille Lash, Lois Lash, and Alice Johnson and husband, Paul.\n\nIn November 1947, Esther married Robert “Bob” Lane of Friendship. Together they raised four children. In 1951 Bob was owner, designer and builder of the Penobscot Boat Works in Rockport. Much of their activity involved outings on the Gale II for picnics, overnight explorations on the shores and islands along the coast of Maine. In 1966, the couple purchased land on Cranberry Island in Muscongus Bay where they built their cottages which the family continues to enjoy today. (Esther celebrated her 90th birthday on her beloved island home with many friends and family.) Before Bob’s early retirement in 1975, he built his cruising houseboat, the Star of Maine. He and Esther sailed every winter to the Bahamas for ten years. After this time, they built their home returning to Friendship, Maine.\n\nEsther was a homemaker, loved making treats with her children on Sunday afternoons alternating between popcorn ball, fudge, pulled taffy or hand churned homemade ice cream. She told hilarious stories about her growing up in her large family, was instigator of all the fun Fourth of July parades and picnics on Cranberry Island. She enjoyed driving the backroads of Maine with her sisters going from free coffee in Rockland to free muffins in Damariscotta. She loved chocolate candy and dried fish. She loved to go “antiquing” and had a knack of envisioning the beauty of a beat-up old bureau, bed or dilapidated chair. Dad would fix the drawer or chair rung; mom could match the stain and do the sanding and finishing to perfection. They were a good team.\n\nEsther’s greatest legacy and foremost role as our mother was down on her knees in prayer to make sure each of her four children had a personal relationship to God and to his son, Jesus Christ. She instilled in us the love for God, for the Bible and its promises and the love for singing the hymns of faith. She loved sharing her faith with others. She loved the nation of Israel.\n\nEsther is also survived by her four children and their spouses: Gale and Gary Bailey of Camden; Daniel and Beth Lane of Deer Isle; Doug Lane of Damariscotta; and Lorna and Philip Street of Washington. Her grandchildren, spouses and great-grandchildren are Karen and Ryan Stephenson, Owen, Andrew and Austin of Wheat Ridge, Colorado; Nathaniel and Diane Lane, Esther and Emelia of Deer Isle, Maine; Andrea and Christopher Wheeland, Asa and Nadia of Winooski, Vermont; Erica and Jeremy Elwell and Honor of Nobleboro, Maine; Maria and Kris Lermond and Cora of Round Pond, Maine. She has many nieces and nephews and a large extended family.\n\nEsther is predeceased by her husband of 67 years on January 15, 2015, her granddaughter, Marcia Eileen Bailey and great- grandson, Mark Philip Elwell; brothers: Austin, John, Harold, Robert, Douglas, Paul, Winfield, and Howard Lash all from Friendship; and sisters: Mary, Eleanor, Myra, and Carolyn all from Friendship.\n\nOn Monday, August 19, at 2 p.m., family and friends are invited to a celebration of Esther’s life at the graveside service at the Friendship Old Village Cemetery where she will be laid to rest. Rev. Alan Chamberlain will officiate the service.\n\nThe family of Esther Lane wish to thank Bartlett Woods in Rockland and Chase Point in Damariscotta for the excellent and loving care extended to our mother.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her memory to the Advent Christian Church, PO Box 9, Friendship, ME 04547.\n\nArrangements are in care of Burpee, Carpenter and Hutchins Funeral Home, Rockland, ME.\n\nThis is the scripture verse for the stationary:"
