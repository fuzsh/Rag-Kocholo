COVID 19 has disrupted all sports, but rugby league with the community at heart has stood strong and the leadership from the National Rugby League to keep this great sport functioning has been nothing short of outstanding. The interest in rugby league, particularly over the last 12 months has been the strongest for several years and this has also been reflected in the Newcastle Rugby league competitions. This is a year in review, 2021"
