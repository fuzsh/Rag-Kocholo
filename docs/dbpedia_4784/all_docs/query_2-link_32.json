        "text": "Team Harris is announcing former Maine GOP Executive Director Tony Payne, the Honorable Roger Katz, and the Honorable Peter Mills as Republican co-chairs of the campaign in Maine as part of the launch of Republicans for Harris, a grassroots organizing coalition to further our outreach efforts to the millions of Republican voters who continue to reject the chaos, division, and violence of Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda. As former Republican legislators and leaders, these co-chairs will play a pivotal role in facilitating Republican-to-Republican voter contact, including by hosting Republican-featured events, door knocking, phone banking, spearheading letter-to-the-editor campaigns, and building local networks with Republican organizations, businesses, and community groups.\n\nWhile Trump has turned off many Republican voters in Maine – including 27,000 voters who cast their ballot for Nikki Haley in the primary – Team Harris has made clear that there’s a home in our campaign for Republican voters who care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people.\n\n“I truly believe Donald Trump is a danger to our democracy and that’s what drives me to be here. He tells us in no uncertain terms he would ignore the United States Constitution if it suits his purpose. We should take him at his word. As a lawyer, I know a tough prosecutor when I see one. The contrast is pretty stark between the seasoned district attorney and Attorney General and the convicted felon, convicted by a jury of his own peers,” said Republican for Harris Co-Chair, the Honorable Roger Katz, in a news release. “We can disagree about policy issues… but this is a binary choice: it is Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. The choice is so clear. I hope that whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or an independent you’ll see that clear choice and vote to uphold and support our democracy in November.”\n\n“Let’s get real, Trump’s motivation to be president is to be the star of his revenge tour. By contrast, President Harris will be motivated to fight for a brighter future that lets people get ahead,” said Republican for Harris Co-Chair and former Executive Director of the Maine Republican Party Tony Payne. “I call on my fellow Mainers and Republicans to join me in speaking unequivocally, loudly and relentlessly in opposition to Trump and to cast our ballots for the future of America and the Kamala Harris administration.”\n\n“My sister’s proven it’s okay to be a Democratic prosecutor. I’m confident Kamala Harris can do just as good a job at the national level. I’m so pleased that Harris is running… and I’ll do everything I can to support her,” said Republican for Harris Co-Chair, the Honorable Peter Mills.\n\n“Donald Trump’s MAGA extremism is toxic to the millions of Republicans who no longer believe the party of Donald Trump represents their values and will vote against him again in November. Donald Trump said he doesn’t want these voters, but Vice President Harris and our campaign are working 0vertime to earn the support of my fellow Republicans who care about defending democracy and restoring decency – all of which would be torn away in a second Trump presidency,” said National Director of Republican Outreach Austin Weatherford. “The Harris campaign understands the power of showing up, making your case, and earning the support of a voter. That is the backbone of our program: showing up and taking the time every single day to earn the vote of Republicans who believe in putting country over party, and know that every American deserves a President who will protect their freedoms and a commander-in-chief who will put the best interests of the American people above their own.”"
