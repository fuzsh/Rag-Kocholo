        "text": "Class 2A, Region 2 welcomes two new coaches and a new team to the fold for the 2024 season as seven of the teams try to dethrone Cottonwood as region champion.\n\nAl Gilmore is the new head coach at Geneva County and Tanner Harris is new at Houston County, where he grew for awhile and later served as an assistant coach.\n\nProvidence Christian is the new team after dropping from 3A.\n\nAbbeville, Ariton, G.W. Long and Samson round out the region.\n\nAbbeville breakdown\n\nThe time is now: Abbeville has plenty of returning starters and loads of experience. Head coach LaBrian Stewart expects his team to be a true contender this season.\n\n“Every year when coaches say we’re young and we’re developing … we’ll we’re getting older,” Stewart said. “It’s like playing with a puppy. They’ve got soft teeth and now our teeth are hard.\n\n“So I tell people, ‘Beware, we bite.’ It’s a group of kids that want to win. They’ve been working and taking ownership of the team. As a head coach, that makes my job easier because you’ve got kids who understand our rules and procedures. This is a group I’m excited about.”\n\nVeteran QB: Ahmod Billins is a quarterback Stewart has plenty of confidence in.\n\n“Going into year 23 of my career, this will the first time being a head coach where I have the same quarterback for three years, and I have a chance to have Ahmod Billins for four, Lord willing,” Stewart said.\n\n“He’s grown. I remember when the kid was 5-10 and 140-something pounds. He’s now 6-2, 173. I’ve been real proud of him. He’s always had the work ethic, but the leadership and maturity is getting there. He’s been in that same offense, and he gets it.”\n\nNewcomers: Stewart has recruited a couple of players from the basketball team, including senior defensive end Brandon Buck, Jr., who stands 6-foot-5 and weighs 215 pounds.\n\n“Think about it … they know how to win; they know how to compete,” Stewart said. “We can’t have kids walking the halls and not playing as many sports as possible. It builds that competitive spirit.”\n\nAriton breakdown\n\nSeeking a bounce back: After two-straight 10-win seasons and one region title, Ariton slid to a 6-5 record and a third-place region finish last year.\n\nHead coach Steven Kilcrease feels enough talent is returning that can help the Purple Cats make a move back up to the region’s upper echelon.\n\n“We lost some players from last year that you can’t replace, but we have a really good nucleus coming back that we feel good about,” Kilcrease said. “We have six starters back (on offense), but probably have eight or nine that started at some point. We have seven returning starters on defense.”\n\nA different Senn at QB: One of the losses is Ian Senn, a four-year starter at quarterback now playing college ball at Troy.\n\nBut the last name of the starting quarterback will remain the same as younger brother Addison (So., 6-1, 200) takes over. He was the starting QB last year before Ian Senn was moved back after playing wide receiver.\n\n“People were doubling Ian out there and it was hard to get the ball to him, so we made the move to put Ian back (to QB),” Kilcrease said. “It wasn’t anything Addison was doing. It was we had to get the best player the football.”\n\nWhile Ian Senn had the ability to make people miss tackles with shifty moves and quickness, the younger Senn is a physical runner.\n\nFront seven a strength of defense: Defensively, Ariton features depth in its front seven.\n\nUp front Jamariion Govan, Gabe Jones, Bowen Jones and Jared Schanter all return as starters. Corde Scott is expected to join the mix.\n\nTrey Connell, the team’s strongest player with a 600-pound squat and 400 bench press, leads the linebacker group. Wells Ganey, Parker Wimberley, Tristan McGuire, Tucker Woodham, Tate Kilcrease, Bryson Messer and Tristan Silivent are others that will play linebackers.\n\nCottonwood Breakdown\n\nBuilding off momentum: What will the Bears do from an encore after compiling a 10-2 record and quarterfinal appearance in the playoffs?\n\nCoach Dustin Harrison is confident his team can pick up from where it left off.\n\n“People have asked this offseason what kind of team we are going to have, and it’s a 100 percent truth that I tell them that our success this year is going to be based on what we do this offseason and this fall leading up to Week 1,” Harrison said. “If we will do the things it takes and have a champions effort each day when we come in and work, then our team has the potential to be much better than last year. If our players don’t take that ownership, then we could go backwards. The ball is our court.”\n\nOffensive weapons: Braylon Morris returns at quarterback and Klete Meadows and King Campbell are terrific running backs. There are also four returning O-linemen in Charlie Abshire, Kain Campbell, Dylan Burks and Jayden Tran. Jayden Garrett returns at wide receiver.\n\n“One of the greatest things about our team this year is each skill player specifically really compliments each other,” Harrison said. “We’re excited to see what we can do to attack with those different skill sets that we have.”\n\nDefensive leaders: Kain Campbell is a senior defensive tackle and Dylan Burks a senior nose guard. Jayden Garrett returns for his senior year at linebacker. Senior linebacker Aly Bakr will be counted on, as will sophomore defensive end Ty Booker. The secondary is anchored by Meadows and King Campbell.\n\nGeneva County breakdown\n\nNew man in charge: Al Gilmore enters his first year as head coach following a six-year stint as an assistant at Elba.\n\n“We have really put them through the grinder this summer and they have responded tremendously,” Gilmore said.\n\nKeep an eye on him: Gilmore believes the Bulldogs have one of the best running backs in the area in senior Brennan Hall.\n\n“He is probably one of the best kept secrets in the Wiregrass,” Gilmore said. “No one knows his name, but I’ve got a feeling if things go the way that I think they are this year, then I think a few people may recognize his name at the end of the year.”\n\nAll-around talent: Caden Hutchings, a junior, is expected to start at quarterback and also play on defense, at either linebacker or strong safety.\n\n“Probably one of the more talented quarterbacks I’ve had in my career as far as ability to throw the ball and run,” Gilmore said.\n\nIn the trenches: Look for senior Bailey Broxton (6-2, 265) to anchor both sides of the line.\n\n“He’s lost about 40 pounds and has really leaned up,” Gilmore said. “He’s committed to his senior year and has really put the time in. He’s probably our strongest overall football player and has been a senior leader for us this summer.”\n\nG.W. Long breakdown\n\nMixed experience for Rebels: Though seven starters return on offense and eight on defense from last year’s 7-4 playoff team, the G.W. Long Rebels enter the season with mixed emotions.\n\n“We are cautiously optimistic,” G.W. Long head coach David Watts said. “We have a lot of guys back, especially on the fronts on both sides. Those guys are now older, upperclassmen and a little more physically mature. We just have to figure out some things at the skill positions where we lost a lot of guys. We have some good young ones, and we feel good about those guys, but they just haven’t been necessarily through it.”\n\nNew QB: One of those “young ones” is sophomore Preston Williams, the QB starter.\n\n“He is a very good athlete,” Watts said. “He just doesn’t have a ton of experience there obviously. At the end of the year, when Bryson (Hughes) got hurt, he stepped up and got to play. He had a good game against Goshen in the playoffs, throwing for over 300 yards. We are optimistic about what he can do.”\n\nStrong OL/LB: The Rebels return four returning starters on the offensive line, including tight end Blayne Wood. Hunter Kerchner, Grayson Haynes and Marvin McCleod return in the heart of the OL.\n\nLong returns four returning starters at linebacker – Landon Grubbs, Wood, Eben Pritchett and McLeod.\n\nHouston County breakdown\n\nHarris returns home: Tanner Harris spent his toddler years in Columbia and later returned to Houston County for a few seasons as an assistant coach. After leaving for a job in north Alabama, he is now back as the head coach.\n\n“That place is home,” said Harris, who lived in Columbia until 4 years old and coached at HCHS in 2020-21. “Being away for a couple of years and coming back now, I have loved every second of it. It is great being with the kids. I missed them the last couple of years, so to be able to come back and be able to be their head coach is a dream come true.”\n\nSpeed/physicality: Harris inherits a team built on speed and physicality.\n\n“Our 4x100 team won the (Class 1A) state championship last year and three of those guys play for us,” Harris said. “Even going back and watching film, you could tell they were physical and hit you. When you can run and be physical, that is pretty good starting point.”\n\nThe members of that winning relay team playing football are running back/linebacker Azariel Todd, running back/wide receiver/linebacker Deyshaun Wynn and quarterback/safety Zy’Kevious Neal-Culver.\n\nAlabama State bound: Todd, a 6-foot, 210-pounder, has committed to play at Alabama State where he is expected to play linebacker.\n\n“He is coachable and works his tail off for you,” Harris said. “Every day in the weight room he is bringing it 100 miles per hour. He soaks up everything on the field on offense and defense.”\n\nProvidence Christian breakdown\n\nEagles drop back down: The 2024 season sees Providence Christian dropping down to Class 2A after eight seasons in Class 3A.\n\nWhile in a new classification, there is familiarity for head coach Kenny Keith. Six of the seven other region teams are the same as when PCS was in 2A, Region 2 in 2015. The only exception is Abbeville is now in instead of Houston Academy.\n\nSkill players to lead PCS: Keith and the Eagles hope to soar behind returning skill players.\n\n“Our quarterback (Craig Pittman) has been playing for three years,” Keith said. “(Fullback) Calvin McClintock has been playing a long time. He will be a senior this year. (Running back) Kyser Sims has been playing for a couple of years, so we have some people that have a lot of experience. They will have to lead the team.”\n\nWide receivers Christian Sutton (Sr.) and John Martin Byrd (Jr.) also return as starters.\n\nBack end returns on defense: The Eagles have only one returning starter on the defensive line but return three starters in both the linebacker area and in the secondary.\n\nThe returning linebackers are Sawyer Bienvenu, Tyler Sharp and McClintock, while the secondary returning starters are defensive backs Sutton and Byrd and safety Colson Love.\n\nSamson Breakdown\n\nBuilding the right way: Jason Wambles enters his seventh year as head coach and is five wins away from being the all-time winningest coach at Samson.\n\n“When I got there, the principal hired me and said, ‘Coach, we want to get them in the weight room and reestablish some discipline and win a couple of games early in the program,’” Wambles said. “We have had a good run. We made the playoffs a couple of years and had a couple of good seasons.”\n\nStrong-armed signal-caller: Quarterback Chase Ray, who at 6-3, 220, throws with the best of them, even if Samson relies more on the run.\n\n“He can make any throw on the field,” Wambles said. “He’s a pocket passer. He threw for around 1,200 yards last year with nobody to really throw to. He’s going to have few more guys this year, but they are still young guys. Again, he won’t be able to do what he’s really good at (throwing) a lot for us.”\n\nJT Yarbrough is a junior running back who will be counted on.\n\nDefensive talent: The Tigers return six starters, though none are seniors – four juniors and two sophomores. Ben McKenzie is someone to keep an eye on.\n\n“Ben McKenzie is just going to be a 10th grader but he is already being recruited,” Wambles said. “He’s 6-3, 200 pounds and is a defensive end and tight end type.”\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
