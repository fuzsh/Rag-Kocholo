        "text": "Experienced hooker Michael van Vuuren has bolstered Newcastle Falcons’ front-row ranks by joining on a one-season deal.\n\nThe 31-year-old arrives from South African side Emirates Lions, for whom he played last season in the United Rugby Championship and EPCR Challenge Cup.\n\nEnglish-qualified Van Vuuren boasts Premiership experience from his time playing for Wasps, Bath, Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers - also spending a season in Paris with Stade Francais.\n\nHis spell at Wasps saw him scoring two tries against Newcastle Falcons last season, with the former South Africa Under-20s international who having also represented Free State Cheetahs and Eastern Province Kings in his homeland.\n\nFalcons head coach Alex Codling said: “I worked with Michael a few years back when I was head coach at Ealing, and he brings a lot of experience.\n\n“He’s one of those players who helps glue a team together, and his set-piece work is really strong. He has a deep knowledge and passion around that area of the game and he’s also played a lot of Premiership rugby, so he knows the competition and how things work.\n\n“He’ll add a great deal to the group because he knows the game and has a very calm and dependable nature. He’s one of those guys who just gets on with it and works really hard for the team, so I’m looking forward to him getting started next week.”\n\nVan Vuuren, who lands in the UK this weekend, said: “I’m incredibly excited about joining Newcastle.\n\n“Having played up there a few times I know it’s a very difficult place to come to as an opposition player. In fact, the very first game I played in England back in 2015 was up at Newcastle, and I thought I was going to die of hyperthermia!\n\n“All joking aside, though, I know it’s a great club up there and the fans get right behind the team, so I’m looking forward to experiencing that and getting stuck in.”\n\nRelishing the opportunity to link up again with Alex Codling, the hooker said: “Codders is a tough coach but he’ll get the best out of the boys, and I know a few of them from my time at Wasps. It’s going to be good to link up with them and to experience Newcastle, because I’ve only heard good things about the city and the club.\n\n“I’ve wanted to work with Codders again for quite a while because I have huge respect for him, and I jumped at the chance when the opportunity came up. I also know the talent in the squad up there, and it’s a good move for me.”\n\nGiving supporters an idea of what to expect from their most recent acquisition, Van Vuuren added: “I pride myself on my set-piece in terms of my line-out throwing and scrummaging, and I like to get the ball in hand around the park.\n\n“If I can run some good lines and link up with people, then great, but it all starts with the set-piece work.”\n\nThe hooker becomes Newcastle Falcons’ 13th new signing ahead of the 2023-24 season, following the previously-announced arrivals of Rory Jennings (London Irish), Murray McCallum (Edinburgh), Eduardo Bello (Saracens), Cameron Hutchison (Edinburgh), Hugh O’Sullivan (London Irish), Tim Cardall (Melbourne Rebels), Louis Brown (Coventry), Ollie Leatherbarrow (Exeter Chiefs), Kiran McDonald (ex-Munster), Bryan Byrne (Bristol Bears), Josh Bainbridge (Coventry) and John Kelly (Doncaster Knights).\n\nThe Falcons have also promoted five players into their senior academy, with Newcastle University graduate Adam Scott joined by England Under-18s internationals Jacob Oliver, Ben Redshaw, Finn Baker and Isaac Keller."
