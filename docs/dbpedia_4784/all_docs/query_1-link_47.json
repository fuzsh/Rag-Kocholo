        "text": "Primary school pupils from all across the Duchy have had their first taste of rugby league as part of the Cornwall School Games.\n\nStaff and players from Cornwall RLFC, along with those from our developmental arm the Cornish Rebels, helped stage four qualifying events with the winning school from each going through to a finals day.\n\nSupported by the Choughs’ retail partner Whirlwind Sports, the finals day took place at Poltair School with the rugby league competition taking place at Poltair Park, home of football club AFC St Austell.\n\nThe four winners from the qualifying events were St Hilary (Penzance), Stithians, Newquay Junior Academy and Bishop Cornish (Saltash).\n\nA series of round-robin games took place to determine the two teams that would contest the final to decide the outright winners and who would play in the third and fourth final.\n\nSt Hilary and Sithians would contest the final to be crowned Cornwall School Games Rugby League champions for 2022 with Choughs hooker Sam Gilder refereeing the match.\n\nPlaying touch rules with one point awarded for each successful try, it was St Hilary who prevailed 2-0 with the outstanding Isso Rhodes scoring both tries. Rhodes, a pacy runner with great feet and hands, she was only called up to play at the last minute and as a year five pupil, was younger than most of the other players who took part.\n\nIn the third and fourth place final, it was Newquay Junior Academy who took the spoils. Amongst the Newquay teaching contingent who made the short trip from the Atlantic Coast was Fijian rugby union star Josh Matavesi.\n\nThe 31-year-old Camborne born centre has played in rugby union’s top flight for Worcester Warriors, Newcastle Falcons and Bath. Currently, he plies his trade overseas in Japan with Toyota Industries Shuttles Aichi.\n\nRob Butland, co-founder of the Cornish Rebels and Cornwall RLFC commercial manager, said: “For such a long time now we have enjoyed supporting the Cornwall School Games calendar as Cornish Rebels and have developed close links with the amazing school games organisers.\n\n“This year is doubly special because it’s been three years since we’ve had all of our finalists in one place for the annual Cornwall School Games finals day.\n\n“Every primary school in Cornwall has the opportunity to play touch rugby league as part of the route to the games and once again we will be offering support to all of Cornwall in the 22-23 academic year.”"
