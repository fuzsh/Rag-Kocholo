        "text": "Words by Rod Thompson for Newcastle Weekly.\n\nNewcastle Rebels coach Adam Bettridge admits he “can’t wait” for the opening showdown of the 2023 NSWRL Country Championships next month.\n\nThe highly-respected mentor was buoyed by his team’s endeavours against the Newcastle Knights’ NSW Cup outfit in front of a respectable crowd at the Cessnock Sportsground on Saturday 11 February.\n\nIn searing temperatures, with the mercury topping 38 degrees, the Rebels – missing the likes of South Newcastle Lions’ Ryan Glanville, Macquarie Scorpions’ Matthew Moon, and Cessnock Goannas duo Brayden Musgrove and Jayden Young from the original squad – eventually succumbed 32-24 in the final minutes of the showdown.\n\nAnd, to be fair, the Tooheys Newcastle Rugby League (Real NRL) representatives were the better side for 80% of the match.\n\nThe Rebels led 20-0 at half-time, with the fixture being played in four 20-minute quarters.\n\nBut, the Knights slowly clawed their way into the game, due to their fitness – and posted the last try as the final siren sounded.\n\n“It was a good effort for our first hit-out,” Bettridge said.\n\n“Those conditions were tough out there.\n\n“So, I thought the boys tried really hard.\n\n“They began brilliantly and, as you can see by the starting line-up, I think they were pretty good.\n\n“It was disappointing to concede points at the end.\n\n“However, you have to treat it on its merits… not only was it our initial outing, we’ve had six training sessions, the weather probably took its toll later on.\n\n“We’ll definitely be better for the run.\n\n“If we just keep working hard towards that round one match, we should be alright.”"
