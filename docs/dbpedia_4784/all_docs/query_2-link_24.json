        "text": "NEWCASTLE will banish Yankuba Minteh to the youth team if he refuses to leave this summer.\n\nSunSport revealed yesterday that Minteh is refusing to join Lyon despite Newcastle accepting a bid from the French club because of his desire to stay in the Premier League.\n\nNow the transfer row with the Gambia international has escalated.\n\nMinteh wants to join Everton, who have held talks with his representatives, but have yet to agree a fee with Newcastle and are unlikely to do so this week.\n\nNewcastle's desire for a quick sale is fuelled by concerns they will be charged for breaching PSR rules if they don't sell players by Sunday's accounting deadline, which could lead to a points deduction.\n\nOther possible player sales have failed to materalise this month leading to Newcastle accepting an offer that could reach £40m from Lyon for Minteh, which would resolve all their PSR issues.\n\nMinteh is digging in however, despite being told that he does not currently feature in Eddie Howe's plans for next season.\n\nSunSport has learned that the 19-year-old is currently visiting family in Gambia and has no plans to return to Europe which, given the need for medical, will make it difficult for a transfer to be concluded this week.\n\nMinteh has never played for Newcastle as he was sent on loan to Feyenoord immediately after his £6.5m signing from Danish club Odense Boldklub last summer.\n\nWhile Minteh does not feature in Howe's plans for next season Newcastle sources indicated that the manager would look at him training if he remains at the club next month.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nMinteh made 37 appearances for Feyenoord this season while on loan from the Magpies.\n\nHe also scored 11 goals and provided six assists.\n\nThe 19-year-old earned his first international cap for Gambia in September and has since made six appearances for the national team."
