Picture by NSWRL\n\nJeremy Thurston has played just one game for Western Rams but he has quickly become one of their most important players.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nFresh off six tries in the Country Championships opening round against Northern Tigers, Thurston will once again line up for the Rams when they feature in the competition's semi-final on Sunday.\n\nAwaiting the Western group are Newcastle Rebels, a side who defeated South Coast Dragons last weekend to advance through to the final four and set up a heavyweight clash at Wollongong's Collegians Sports Stadium.\n\nThurston's six tries was the highlight in Western's 64-18 win over the Tigers earlier this month and the strike centre believes the group are ready for their next challenge.\n\n\"There is a really good feeling within the team and we are pretty confident,\" he said.\n\n\"There were a couple of little things we can improve on.\"\n\nThe only Dubbo CYMS representative in the side, Thurston is one of only three players from the city who were in Cameron Greenhalgh's team for round one.\n\nIn his first match in Western colours, Thurston admitted the team is in a really good place ahead of their meeting with the Rebels.\n\n\"It was good, it was nice to just be around the boys,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got a really good team with some great players in there.\"\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nHaving not played much representative football in the past, Thurston said he had never played with the majority of the squad before until their trial match at Young.\n\n\"Not really, it was pretty much the first time other than the trial we have a few weeks ago,\" he said.\n\n\"It was the first real game and hit out, I've played with 'Justo' (Justin Toomey-White) and 'Aka (Alex Ronayne) a little bit but that's about all of them.\"\n\nRonayne and Thurston teamed up late last year in the Koori Knockout, representing Bourke Warriors while Toomey-White has also shared the field with the Dubbo CYMS star.\n\nCo-captaining the side, Thurston believes Toomey-White and Ronayne have earned all the respect they are given.\n\n\"They are really good leaders,\" he said.\n\n\"Guys like Clay Priest and Jack Littlejohn as well, there a few captain-coaches in the side.\"\n\nGreenhalgh's side is largely made up of Forbes Magpies players after the group won the inaugural Peter McDonald Premiership against Thurston's Dubbo CYMS.\n\nJust months after battling for the title, Thurston laughed about how quickly things have changed and what it is like to team with NSW Country representative Mitch Andrews.\n\nBookmark\n\nMake sure you are signed up for our breaking and regular headlines newsletters\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nFollow us on Instagram\n\nFollow us on Google News\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.\n\nWEEKLY\n\nSport\n\nThe latest news, results & expert analysis.\n\nWEEKLY\n\nNote from the Editor\n\nGet the editor's insights: what's happening & why it matters.\n\nWEEKLY\n\nFootyHQ\n\nLove footy?
