        "text": "Masters Rugby League is strictly a social version of the sport for players aged 35+ for Men’s Masters and 30+ for Women’s Masters. The aim is for enjoyment, fitness benefits and social aspects whilst players engage in a version of Rugby League modified for ‘the older player.’\n\nThe most important rule is \"everyone has to buy a drink for their opposite number!”\n\nThe Spirit of Masters:\n\nMasters is non-competitive\n\nMasters does not welcome nor allow rough or over vigorous play\n\nMasters is about enjoyment and having a good time – on and off the pitch!\n\nThere are no winners; no champions; no leagues; no cup finals\n\nAll games end in a 0-0 draw\n\nThe rules are slightly modified to cater for older players, where safety is paramount.\n\nGames are 13 players a side, with up to 7 substitutes. Each player wears one of six different coloured shorts, depending on their age, which relates to different levels of contact. There is a mix of tackles from full-contact, limited contact, and non-contact. There are no conversions and no turnovers. The sixth tackle results in a scrum to the defending side.\n\nEach game lasts 50 minutes (25 x 2 halves) on a 100m x 60/68m pitch, which can all be modified at festivals.\n\nTeams are separated into men’s and women’s formats.\n\nPlease see the full rule document at the bottom of this page for further details."
