        "text": "Newcastle boss Steve Diamond admitted his team âdid not get off the busâ after they suffered a crushing 85-14 Gallagher Premiership defeat against Bristol at Ashton Gate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile Bristol surged into the play-off positions, Newcastle were left to reflect on a 15th successive league loss of the season.\n\nâI thought we had taken a couple of steps forward over the last month, but that was certainly a step back. It gives us a line in the sand,â Falconsâ consultant director of rugby said.\n\nâWe never touched the ball for the first 15 minutes and they were 21 points up. We didnât get off the bus at all. It was not a positive vibe.\n\nâAll we can do is take them back home and get them ready for Sale next week.\n\nâI said when I came back in that we would have three or four games and I would be making decisions, and that is what we will do.\n\nâItâs a tough world out there and we are obviously not up to it in certain areas, which was evident today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nâIt is 15 (Premiership) games without a win so it is very difficult to have any positivity in the building when you keep losing every week.\n\nâWe have been close in the last couple of weeks and today it looked like a completely different team. Bristol were outstanding today â they would probably have put 25-30 points on anybody in the league â and it is a tough learning day.â\n\nBristol reeled off a fifth successive Premiership victory as they moved into fourth spot with three regular season games left.\n\nPat Lamâs team scored more than 50 points for the third home game in a row, posting a club-record Premiership win as they ran in 13 tries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey claimed seven first-half touchdowns â Siva Naulago, James Dun, Max Malins, Magnus Bradbury, James Williams, Ellis Genge and Benhard Janse van Rensburg all scored â with fly-half AJ MacGinty adding six conversions.\n\nFurther tries followed in the second period for Harry Randall, Kieran Marmion, Jake Heenan, Virimi Vakatawa (2) and Van Rensburgâs second â Williams kicked three conversions and Van Rensburg one â while Newcastle posted scores from wing Adam Radwan and fly-half Brett Connon, who also added two conversions.\n\nBristolâs remaining three Premiership fixtures are Leicester away, Saracens at home and Harlequins at the Twickenham Stoop, but they are a team with momentum and could take some stopping.\n\nLam said: âI am really pleased for the whole squad. Everyone is pushing hard, everyone understands their roles.\n\nâIt was a good day. The players were ruthless in terms of getting their jobs done for the team.\n\nâWe have put a real emphasis back on our skills, our mindset, our teamwork and being fearless. When I look around the place, the boys are enjoying themselves.\n\nâThe table means nothing until the last round is finished, which is when it counts. Now we go to Leicester and if you get a win there, it is always cherished.â"
