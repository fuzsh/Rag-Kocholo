        "text": "\"I thought we started pretty well, we started off how we wanted to play and we matched them for that 10-15, I thought a couple of bounces of the ball go the other way and different things can happen,\" Gorrell said.\n\n\"It's just a cruel game because you can be not far away and get five tries put on you in a short space of time.\n\n\"It didn't cost us the game but there were a few things that went against us that were pretty tough. The pass off the ground just before half-time, it didn't cost us the game but it made it hard for us. If you get a couple of those calls, especially just before half-time, do things change? At half-time, I still thought we could win and you take away those six points and you definitely can.\n\nIt appeared as though the opening try broke the shackles as Newcastle went on to score another four times in the space of 13 minutes. Bradley scored a second, Timanu Alexander crossed for a double, while Joe Woodbury ran 95 metres to cross for an intercept try.\n\n\"Talking to them, they've been training three days a week since January. We don't have that luxury. When you look at that, you're behind the eightball from the word go,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of them have been in the system at the Knights and played NSW Cup and you could tell that, just in some moments, they found their front nearly every time, they were an out-and-out good footy side.\n\n\"I thought we competed and kept turning up but even at the end, we couldn't get a bounce of the ball. That's rugby league, you can have those days."
