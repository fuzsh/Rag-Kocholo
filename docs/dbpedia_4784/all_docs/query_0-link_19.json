Eight teams contested during the season for the premiership and the Royal Agricultural Society Challenge Shield; seven teams from Sydney and one team from Newcastle, New South Wales.\n\nAt the begninning of the season, the nearly broke NSWRFL had met and kicked out its founders Henry Hoyle, Victor Trumper and J J Giltinan.[1] Part-way through the season, Edward Larkin was appointed full-tme secretary of the NSWRFL.[2]\n\nAlso in 1909 north of the border, the Queensland Rugby Football League got its club competition started for the rebel football code of rugby league.\n\nContents\n\n1 Teams\n\n2 Ladder\n\n2.1 Ladder progression\n\n3 Finals\n\n4 References\n\nTeams\n\nThe teams that made up the 1909 premiership season were the same as the 1908 season with the exception of Cumberland who were dissolved, being unable to field a competitive team. Their last premiership match turned out to be a 45-0 loss at the hands of North Sydney on 25 July 1908, a game where the team had to \"borrow\" two of North Sydney's officials in order to make up a 13-man side. Seven of Cumberland's players ended up going to Western Suburbs the following year, but only three of these players were able to play another premiership match.\n\nBalmain, formed on 23 January 1908 at Balmain Town Hall\n\nEastern Suburbs, formed on 24 January 1908 at Paddington Town Hall\n\nGlebe, formed on 9 January 1908\n\nNewcastle, formed on 8 February 1908 at Pike's Rooms, Bolton Street, Newcastle\n\nNewtown, formed on 14 January 1908\n\nNorth Sydney, formed on 7 February 1908\n\nSouth Sydney, formed on 17 January 1908 at Redfern Town Hall\n\nWestern Suburbs formed on 4 February 1908\n\nSouths lost only one game in the regular season, to Newcastle in Newcastle, 3 days after the Novocastrians had beaten a New Zealand Maori team.\n\nThe jerseys of the 8 teams for the 1909 season are shown below.\n\nBalmain Eastern Suburbs Glebe Newcastle Newtown North Sydney South Sydney Western Suburbs\n\nLadder\n\nTeam Pld W D L PF PA PD Pts 1 South Sydney 10 9 0 1 210 41 +169 18 2 Balmain 10 8 0 2 130 62 +68 16 3 Newcastle 10 5 0 5 144 93 +51 10 4 Eastern Suburbs 10 5 0 5 167 141 +26 10 5 Glebe 10 4 0 6 62 159 -97 8 6 Newtown 10 3 1 6 73 107 -34 7 7 North Sydney 10 2 2 6 104 157 -53 6 8 Western Suburbs 10 2 1 7 42 172 -130 5\n\nLadder progression\n\nNumbers highlighted in green indicate that the team finished the round inside the top 4.\n\nNumbers highlighted in blue indicates the team finished first on the ladder in that round.\n\nNumbers highlighted in red indicates the team finished in last place on the ladder in that round\n\nTeam 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 South Sydney 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 18 2 Balmain 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 3 Newcastle 2 2 2 2 2 4 6 6 8 10 4 Eastern Suburbs 2 4 6 6 8 10 10 10 10 10 5 Glebe 0 2 4 4 4 4 6 8 8 8 6 Newtown 0 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 5 7 7 North Sydney 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3 4 6 8 Western Suburbs 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 5 5 5\n\nFinals\n\nIn 1909 semi-finals were played amongst the four highest placed teams. Top two finishers South Sydney and Balmain were able to win their respective semi-finals. However, after the New South Wales Rugby League had planned a match between the Australian rugby union and rugby league teams that would upstage the premiership final, both South Sydney and Balmain unofficially agreed to not play out a final. But unknown to Balmain, South Sydney turned up ready to play. Another version states that Balmain refused to play in protest against the match being held at Souths' home ground.[3] The final was deemed to be a forfeit as a result, with South Sydney claiming their second premiership in as many years.[4] Requests from Balmain for the match to be played at a later date were refused by the League.[5] Conflict over whether there was an agreement between the two clubs not to play a final[6] caused a deep seated resentment towards Souths by Balmain which lasted many years.\n\nSemi-finals Final 14 August 1909 - Wentworth Balmain 15 Eastern Suburbs 8 14 September 1909 - Showground South Sydney Balmain (forfeit) 14 August 1909 - Agricultural South Sydney 20 Newcastle 0\n\nMembers of the South Sydney side who showed up on Grand Final day and won by forfeit were:\n\n• Arthur Butler • Arthur Conlin (c) • Harry Butler • Howard Hallett • T.Anderson • J.Davis • Frank Storie • Ed Fry • Dick Green • Jack Coxon • W.Cann • P.Carroll • Arthur Hennessy (coach)\n\nReferences"
