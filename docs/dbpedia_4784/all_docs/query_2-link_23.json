        "text": "Singer/songwriter/guitarist Louisa Stancioff will appear at Belfast Summer Nights on Thursday, Aug. 8, North Haven Community Days Fest on Saturday, Aug. 10, and the Camden Art Walk on Thursday, Aug. 15. Stancioff was interviewed on May 13.\n\nThe Chesterville native has deep ties to Knox County. Her father grew up in Camden and Rockport. Stancioff has fond memories of spending summers in the area with her family.\n\n“It was a really magical time. My sister and cousins and I would stay with my grandfather. He was wonderful, really welcoming,’ Stancioff said.\n\nA few years ago, Stancioff began to seriously dedicate herself to her music. She moved to Los Angeles to record songs with a band. Stancioff planned to stay only a short time and return to Maine for a summer farm job, she said.\n\n“But then pandemic hit and I ended up staying in L.A. longer,” said Stancioff. She still wanted to make music and had a group of songs with a similar general vibe that all went together.\n\n“‘When We Were Looking’ is melancholy, sweet, a psychedelic dream like album,” said Stancioff. She did not realize she was making a break-up album until interviewers started describing it that way.\n\n“It’s a transition album. It’s not about one person, one relationship – I’m in transition for the entirety of it. Physically and mentally transitioning, traveling through different states and moving to different places.\n\n“I’m in and out of relationships and still kind of processing them from afar, and experiencing good and bad thing surrounded by friends and lovers,” said Stancioff.\n\nThe moody, etherial music tends towards maudlin lyrics. On ‘Cigarette,’ Stancioff sings “I’ll be your cigarette/Pick me up in the morning/Cause you’re not done with me yet.” Another track on this post-pandemic album is named “Quarantine.”\n\n“Seams” features ethereal lilting vocals with slow, atmospheric guitar strumming with the chorus lyrics “I opened up my seams/you crawled in like a dream.”\n\nStancioff return to Maine about four years ago. She lived in Camden and performed around the region. At a Boston performance, she was approached by a Maine-based producer, Sam Kassirer. They worked together to create and release “When We Were Looking” this spring.\n\n“I love playing in Maine; I love being in Maine, it’s my safe and happy place. But I want to get out in the world and have new experiences, too. All the songs on my next album are about small town living, this area.\n\n“If I’m feeling creative, I can write a song about anything. I’m looking to be inspired,” said Stancioff. She was recently inspired by local punk/girl rock band Bonnie.\n\n“It was fun to groove to their songs! I want to write a song like that, something we can play at parties - write a song just for the sake of dancing,” the singing, songwriter, guitar player said.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to recording another album. I have a lot of songs written, and it will be a bit more upbeat. I really want to have more of an exciting set to perform,” said Stancioff.\n\nEarlier this year Stancioff has toured with Oshima Brothers and Blitzen Trapper. In October, she will travel across New England and the midwest with Molly Parden and Eliza Edens."
