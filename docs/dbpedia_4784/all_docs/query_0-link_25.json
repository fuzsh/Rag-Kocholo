Porter, who won the last\n\nOnkaparinga (S.A.) Cup with Lord Gren-\n\nville, and who brought Germaine and\n\nShootover to this colony, is in Perth on a\n\nvisit from the goldfields.\n\nMr. S. J. Chipper has received a letter\n\nfrom Mr. J. J. Wilkinson, the goldfields\n\nhandicapper, coniplimeuting him upon\n\nthe skill and efficiency he_/displayed in\n\nstarting the fields at the Coolgardie Cup\n\nmeeting with Polain's patent machine.\n\nA meeting of the directors of the newly\n\nfloated Canning Park Turf Club will be\n\nI held during the early part of the ensuing\n\nweek. Rules and regulations for the future\n\nmanagement of the company will be\n\nadopted and the shares willalo be allotted\n\nto the several subscribers.\n\nReceipts, which serve the purpose of\n\nlicensed certificates, await the following\n\njockeys to whom registration was granted\n\nrecently by the Western Australian Turf\n\nClub committee at the office of the club :\n\nW, Powell, T. McNamara, J. Thomas, A. J.\n\nMurray, E. Grifilu, A. Kirkpatrick, T.\n\nDriscoll, T. Torpey, F. Spencer, E. 0.\n\nTrewartha, D. McLanders, Vf. Jackson and\n\nJ. Eobertson.\n\nThe death is reported from Wanganui\n\n(N.Z.) of the thoroughbred stallion Van-\n\nguard, by Traducer from En Avant. Van-\n\nguard had a very successful career on the\n\nturf, and was a member of a string of race-\n\nhorses with which Mr. W Robinson visited\n\nthis colony some years ago. A number of\n\nuseful horses have been sired by Vanguard,\n\nthe best of them being, perhaps, Skir-\n\nmisher.\n\nSir Eupert Clarke has decided to con-\n\ntinue to keep his late father's colours on\n\nthe turf, and, desireus of being represented\n\nin the classic events, he has purchased\n\nfrom James Scobie the 2-year-old colt\n\nRanfurly, by Eiridspord, from Nina. Ean\n\nf urly is engr ged in the Maribyrnong Plate\n\nand other important races. He will con-\n\ntinue to be trained by his present mentor\n\nat Dowling Forest.\n\nDuring last week the fullowing wagers\n\non the Catiifield Cup have been laid by a\n\nleading firm in Melbourne :-¿20Û0 te ¿650,\n\nEeka ; ¿ÍÍC00 to £90, Malto ; ¿lOoO to ¿40,\n\nBoselia; and ¿1000 to £30, Locksmith.\n\nThe doubles, Malto and Malto, Eoseila and\n\nRosella, and Eeka and Eeka, for the two\n\ncups, have also been laid to the extent of\n\n¿65000 each. Another prominent member\n\nof the ring reports the following business .\n\n-Caulfield Cup, ¿1000 'to ¿50, Malto ;\n\n¿500 to ¿25, Amberite. Melbourne Cup :\n\n¿1000 to ¿50, Maltp; ¿1000 to ¿40, The\n\nMerry Boy ; ¿500 to ¿15, Fucile.\n\nWriting of the Indian horse trade the\n\nPlanters' Gazette says:-\"The private\n\nmarket has, to a great extent, declined.\n\nThe bike has played old Harry with it ;\n\nand, outside array requirements, the only\n\ninquiries are for pairs, polo ponies, and\n\nracers. For pairs we must still look to\n\nAustralia. In polo ponies the preference\n\nso far is for Arabs and country breds, the\n\nAustralian not taking so readily to the\n\ngame as the others do. To buy racehorses\n\nand make the game pay requires the judg-\n\nment to buy and the capacity to sell of a\n\nTeddy Weekes, and more importers will\n\nburn their fingers than will make profits,\n\nif they go in largely for that branch of the\n\nbiz.\"\n\nWriting under date of August 31, a Fre-\n\nmantle correspondent \"Gr. L. B.\" who\n\ngives me permission to supply his namo\n\nand address to anyone desiring the same,\n\naddresses me in the following terms :\n\n\" I believe there'are a lot of people that\n\nfancy the racehorse Paul Pry is capable of\n\nwinning the Caulfield Cup. According to\n\nreports he is very much fancied ; in fact,\n\nbacked t<> win a good sum, that is if he\n\ncatches the judge's eye. Now, if there is\n\nanyone that fancies he has a chance, per-\n\nhaps they will take up the wager that I\n\nam going to offer, that is, I will take ¿20\n\nto ¿10, or ¿40 to ¿20 that he does not run\n\nfirst, second, or third. I will deposit the\n\nmoney with you or any approved person.\"\n\nMr. \"Naylor,\" or th» warmest supporter\n\nof Paul Pry, will hardly rush to accept\n\n\" G.L.B.'s \" wager.\n\nAccording to a Melbourne exchange Mr.\n\nR. A. Molesworth is desirous that an Eng-\n\nlish rule of racing bearing on objections\n\nshall be adopted mVictoria, and ho has\n\ngiven notice tor the special meeting of the\n\nV.R.C., which is to be called to consider\n\nthe new rules of racing, that a new rule\n\nbased on rule 166 of the English Jockey\n\nClub be adopted. This rule sets eut \" that\n\nevery objection shall he decided by the\n\nstewards, but their decision shall (if they\n\nare not the stewards of the Jockey Club) be\n\nsubject to appeal to the stewards of the\n\nJockey Club, so far as relates to points\n\ninvolving the interpretation of the rulesj or\n\nto any question other than a question of\n\nfact, on which there shall be no appeal,\n\nunless by leave of the Stewards and with\n\nthe consent of the Stewards of the Jockey\n\nClub.\" Mr. Molesworth's motion will, of\n\ncourse, substitut» the words \" Committee\n\nof the Victoria Eacing Club \" for \" Stewards\n\nof the Jockey Club \" in the above-quoted\n\nrule. Had such a rule been in force when\n\nthe Tim Swiveller-Sainfoin case arose there\n\ncould have been no appeal to the V.E.C.\n\nCommittee, unless the Caulfield Stewards\n\nhad been agreeable. The present V.B.C.\n\nrules, as well as the new rules proposed by\n\nthe Committee, give the Committee power\n\nin cases of appeal \" to draw inferences of\n\nfact.\"\n\nMENZIES TURF CLUB.\n\nANNUAL CUP MEETING.\n\nSECOND DAY'S EACING.\n\nLOBD HOPE WINS A DOUBLE.\n\nMenzies, September 3,\n\nThe second day's racing ot the Annual\n\nCup Meeting of the Menzies Turf Club\n\nheld to-day was very successful.

CHRISTIAN BROS.'\n\nCOLLEGE MATCH.\n\nTO THE SPORTING EDITOR.\n\nSIR,-I notice in your columns of Monday,\n\nthe 30th instant, a reply to my letter in\n\nreference to the disputed football match,\n\nHigh School v. Christian Bros.' College. I\n\nshould deem it a great favour if you would\n\npublish the following remarks upon the\n\nsaid subject, and in reply both to the letter\n\nsigned by the captain of the C.B.C. team\n\nand the one over the name of \"Lover of\n\nFair Play,\" who is, I should say, from the\n\ntenor of his language and the information\n\nwhich he appears to have at his disposal, a\n\ndevoted and ardent supporter of the\n\nChristian Bros.' College. Both these\n\nwriters have acknowledged that the player\n\nMcCarthy had no business to take part in\n\nthe match. This was practically my whole\n\nmatter of complaint, and should at once\n\nsettle the question by declaring, as is the\n\nusual custom, any score made during the\n\nperiod in which the infringement took\n\nplace null and void. But in order, appar-\n\nently, to escape this punishment, it is\n\nstated by both-and there seems to be a\n\nwonderful amount of concurrence in the\n\ntwo statements-that the only goal the\n\nChristian Bros. scored, and through which\n\nthey wish to decide the match, was put up\n\nbefore McCarthy came on the field. This I\n\ntotally disagree with. They have at-\n\ntempted very artfully to ameliorate the\n\noffence which has been committed by call-\n\ning attention to the age of the player in\n\nquestion and ?va?li? together the prin-\n\nciple involved. Why should an outsider\n\nbe asked to play if he is not better\n\nthan others more entitled? I should\n\nthink to represent their school. Ability\n\nis of more consequence than age.\n\nDoes it not prove that they were greatly\n\nafraid of the result, and to equalise the\n\nplay determined to have this assistance at\n\nall hazards? The previous match played\n\nonly a fortnight before proved that, with a\n\nvery weak team, we were fully able to hold\n\nour own, for the result was a draw. This\n\nundoubtedly accounts for McCarthy's in-\n\nclusion in the second and last match of the\n\nseason. Surely honesty is better than\n\nvictory. I have played with the High\n\nSchool football team for the last four sea-\n\nsons, during which time we have never\n\nsuffered defeat in school matches, and I am\n\nvery positive that we should never have\n\ndreamt of resorting to such a method of\n\nstrengthening our team. In this colony it\n\nis purely a matter of loyalty to the pre-\n\nvailing custom, as there are no rules by\n\nwhich a selection of bona-fide scholars can\n\nbe enforced. The \"Lover of Fair Play\"\n\nsays that in New South Wales the custom\n\nis to allow players to take an active part in\n\nthese matches for the remainder of the\n\nseason after they have left school. I should\n\nnot care to refute this statement, but I\n\nhave been very credibly informed that this\n\npractice does not prevail either in England\n\nor in the other Australian colonies. I\n\nwonder if he would care, while advocating\n\nthe interests of the Christian Brothers'\n\nCollege, to see the High School put a team\n\nthus constituted into the field. Hardly a\n\nplayer in the present team would be\n\ndeemed capable of a place. Perhaps the\n\nmost amusing part of the C.B.C. captain's\n\nletter is the last paragraph, where he says\n\nthat it is his desire to see \"healthy rivalry\n\nwith other teams,\" and in the face of this\n\nacknowledges that he had in his\n\nteam a player who was in no way quali-\n\nfied to take part in the game.\n\nIf this constitutes \"healthy rivalry\" then\n\nperhaps he will kindly explain what is\n\nmeant by this term, for I cannot see at\n\npresent that his action is in harmony with\n\nhis wish. As regards the substitute which\n\ntook McCarthy's place at half-time, I dis-\n\ntinctly stated in my former letter, which I\n\nstill strictly adhere to, that he had no per-\n\nmission from me to play, and I did not\n\neven know that he was taking part in the\n\ngame, until the third-quarter was nearly\n\nover, when I considered it too late to\n\nprotest, and not wishing to again create a\n\ndisturbance neglected to call attention to\n\nit. The \"Lover\" again I think is rather\n\nrash when he says that without the per-\n\nmission of the opposing captain, one player\n\nis allowed to take the place of another who\n\nhas to leave the field. He is either totally\n\nignorant of the rules of the Victorian As-\n\nsociation, or has been outrageously misin-\n\nformed.-Yours, etc., F. G.

The club is not yet\n\naffiliated with tho League, but Mr. E. Û.\n\nLaw, tho chairman of the council, will\n\nvisit the Murchison port during the course\n\nof a week or so, and the club will then\n\ncomply with the necessary conditions. I\n\nAt the ordinary monthly meeting of the\n\nLeague Council to be held on Wednesday\n\nevening next, the 3th inst., the following\n\nmotions, of which due notice havo been\n\ngiven, will in addition to the general\n\nbusiness be considered :-1. \" To rescind\n\nportion of clause 2 of the Racing and\n\nRecord Committee's report of June 29th,\n\ndealing with the tenderingfortheL.

In many cases performances\n\nare not given, and in others the form is\n\nnot signed by the competitor but by a\n\ndeputy. Of ceurse .these irregularities\n\nrender the competitor liable to disqualifica-\n\ntion, and in fact in the case of a rider who\n\nhas sent in such informal entry being\n\nsuccessful, the League rules render him\n\nliable to bo prosecuted. The Racing and\n\nRecord Committee have wisely determined\n\nto reject any nominations which are not\n\ncorrectly made.\n\nThe members of the Eacing and Eecord\n\nCommittee will act as clerks of the road at\n\nthe League championship contest this after-\n\nnoon, and Mr. E. B. White has kindly\n\nplaced the services of the Eoyal Enfield\n\ntriplet at the disposal of Messrs.

The actual winner of the race will\n\nsecure the title of 25 miles road champion-\n\nship of the colony, and the team scoring Hie\n\ngreatest number of points will secure for\n\ntheir club the premiership over the distance,\n\nThere are five teams competing, each com-\n\nposed of three riders. The only country\n\nclub represented is tho Northam, and the\n\ntrio which they have sent down is a\n\nparticularly good one. J. P. Clairs and E.\n\nChidlow are, perhaps, two of the best road\n\nriders in the colony, and their companion,\n\nE. Clairs, will take a lot of beating. Two\n\nclubs from Fremantle and both the metro-\n\npolitan clubs have enterad their teams,\n\nand as all of the riders who will compete\n\nare the best men in the colony, a par-\n\nticularly inteiesting and closely-contested\n\nrace should eventuate.\n\nThe fsllowing are the isams :\n\nPerth C.C-J.

They left Melbourne several\n\nmouths ago, and reached the United States\n\nby way of Paris and Loudon. It is Parson's\n\nintention to remain in this country for the\n\nremainder of the season, and if he finds\n\nhimself in condition, he will enter open\n\ncompetition on the National Circuit. Par-\n\nsons will be remembered as the Australian\n\nrider who defeated Zimmerman during the\n\nlatter's trip to the Antipodes, and the\n\nresult of the competition is the warmest\n\nkind of a friendshijj which lias sprung up\n\nbetween the two. Zimmerman was one of\n\nthe first to greet Parsons on his arrival,\n\nand the Australian will visit \" the Skeeter'1\n\nat his Jersey home. The Australian was\n\nvery ill in London, and has not bean on a\n\nwheel for months. Ho will commence\n\ntraining at Manhattan Beach, and hopes\n\nto ba in condition for riding in a few\n\nweeks.

Howell, Ellis, and Phillips, three\n\nprominent members of tlie Swan Club, who\n\nhave been suffering from typhoid, have\n\nnow fully recovered, but are uot yet quite\n\nstrong enough to participate in the next\n\nregatta. What with typhoid and members\n\nleaving for the goldfields and elsewhere,\n\nthe Swan Club was unable to send any\n\ncrews to the regatta held at Fremantle on\n\nthe 26th June last. But it is to be hoped\n\nthat members will bestir themselves now\n\nand once more come out and uphold the\n\nprestige of their club as they have so well\n\ndone in the past.\n\nI may mention that, weather permitting,\n\non next Saturday week the club will hold a\n\npicnic at Coohe-Cooho Hill, near Belmont,\n\non the Guildford portion of the Swan\n\nRiver. The last picnic held was a com-\n\nbined one with the W.A.R.C., at which a\n\nfootball match was played, the Swan River\n\nClub winning by 5 goals to «ti.\n\n(Notes by \" Streak.\")\n\nThe annual regatta of the West Aus-\n\ntralian Rowing Club, which takes place on\n\nSaturday, the 9th October next, is already\n\nengaging the attention of members at the\n\ndifferent sheds, particularly the W.A. and\n\nSwans. I have not heard that any of the\n\nPort crews have started training, but no\n\ndoubt tho seasiders will, as on previous oc-\n\ncasions, be well represented. Subject to\n\nalteration, the following crews of the\n\nW.A. Rowing-Club have been selected\n\nto take part in the Regatta :\n\nMaiden Sculls: L. C. J. Magennis.\n\nMaiden Pairs: K. Messer, F.
