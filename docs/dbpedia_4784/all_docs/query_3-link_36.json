        "text": "For some reason, Leica the wonder dog (it’s a wonder she’s a dog!), made several executive decisions recently.\n\nAbout six months ago Leica abandoned her crate. She gave us no notice, no explanation. Just suddenly she decided to take up residence on our living room couch, across from the fireplace and TV and within earshot of the radio which she often has tuned to a classical music station or old James Taylor songs. We have no idea why she made this decision. Maybe she was annoyed by my snoring or frequent (and annoying) awakenings during the night. Good sleeps are not part of my repertoire.\n\nThen, fairly recently, Leica made another decision. This move came, again unannounced, during our recent heat wave. At unpredictable times during the night she would arrive alongside our bed and leap onto us, wagging her tail with one of her favorite stuffed animals (often a well battered and decomposing stuffed squirrel she has owned since her youth), tramp around on top of us, then curl up at the foot of the bed in a perfect direct line with the window fan. We have come to suspect that the breeze created by the fan appealed to her, regardless of the time on the clock. Three to 5 a.m. is often her arrival time!\n\nLeica is a furry Labradoodle. Her coat is a dark complex with a fine hair underneath some courser more curly (especially in the summer heat with humidity) fur. Even with her “summer cut” she clearly is quite unhappy with the heat, not unlike yours truly! We have decided that heat is a contributing factor in her recent migration to the duvet cover. As heat accumulates in the couch area, the window fan in our bedroom gained appeal. How could you blame her? The problem is somewhat more challenging because she is reluctant to leave her perch once reaching a more reasonable hour.\n\nThese recent developments have led me to share today’s photograph. I realize this image is totally out of synch with the season, but it occurred to me that Leica and I are not the only planetary items melting in this uncommon heat. As much as I have worked a variety of jobs over the years, outside in the very warm (Cameroon comes to mind!), I am unable to adjust my internal thermostat. The heat sets off some engine trouble icons on my dashboard.\n\nIn the winter, at least, I can pile on more layers. In the summer, there is only so much I can “take off” before the abandon ship alarm goes off!\n\nSo today’s photo is a visual reprieve. The “Little Dippers” group has abandoned, for the most part, the warmer waters that gather at Hendrick’s Head beach. The water temperature in the cove is flirting with the 60F temps now. In the attached photo the water temperature is often in the 40s. Granted, these hearty souls are not seeking heatlessness. They are experiencing the benefits of cold water immersion. Although we are unable to appreciate these benefits right now, I am hoping that the visual provided may help cool the brain and provide some “existential” relief in these challenging times.\n\nEven Leica the wonder dog has been known to take the occasional dip. Nothing like a good dose of ocean water to add new fresh fragrance to the duvet cover!"
