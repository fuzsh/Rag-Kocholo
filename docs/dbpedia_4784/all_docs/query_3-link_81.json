        "text": "Team USA rolled through their quarterfinal against Brazil on Tuesday, winning 122-87 with lights-out 57.7/48.4/89.5 shooting splits as a team. Joel Embiid also had his best performance of the Paris Olympics so far. He started and racked up 14 points (5-of-6 shooting, including 3-of-3 from deep), seven rebounds, one assist, and one block in the first half, and was effective being used to switch more on defense. Embiid rested the second half due to some ankle discomfort, but if it was nothing serious, hopefully heâ€™ll be back in action on Thursday.\n\nJoel Embiid had a bit of ankle discomfort and told Steve Kerr at halftime."
