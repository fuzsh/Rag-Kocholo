        "text": "When the NRL season kicks off tomorrow night, it's likely none of the players that take the field at AAMI Park will give any thought to the significance of the date.\n\nMarch 11 might be simply another day on the calendar, but it marks exactly 25 years since the culmination of a bitter court dispute that threatened to tear the game apart, and ultimately resulted in seven clubs taking the extraordinary decision to forfeit a match.\n\nIn the summer of 1995-96 the name of Justice James Burchett was as familiar to rugby league fans as Andrew Johns, Brad Fittler and Ricky Stuart.\n\nThe Federal Court judge faced the unenviable task of mediating between the Australian Rugby League and News Limited, who were looking to form a breakaway Super League competition.\n\nIn 1995, News Limited had signed a host of leading players to rich deals for its new competition, nicknamed \"Super Greed\" by ARL loyalists.\n\nBut the rebel competition hit a hurdle in February 1996, when Justice Burchett found in favour of the ARL. In his full orders, handed down on March 11, he banned Super League until 2000, and ordered the players to return to the ARL-run competition.\n\nAs the legal manoeuvrings took place behind the scenes, a stay was granted just days later which allowed the rebel players to choose their own destinies, although the clubs were still bound to return to the ARL.\n\nFormer New South Wales and Australian outside back Chris Johns, who was acting as the spokesman for the breakaway group, declared a rival competition, named Global League, would be up and running inside two weeks, even as the ARL announced plans for a March 20 kick-off to the season.\n\nBut the rebel players continued to plan their own competition, while one headline quoted Canberra's Laurie Daley accusing the ARL of treating the players \"like dogs.\"\n\nFor his part, Daley maintains he was taken out of context.\n\n\"I made the comment that 'We've been treated like a dog today – we've been kicked in the guts',\" he wrote in his autobiography Laurie – Always a Winner.\n\n\"The headline in the paper certainly did not convey that meaning.\"\n\nThe then-chairman of the ARL, Ken Arthurson, hit back at Daley, highlighting just how unpleasant the time was for the game.\n\n\"I have to admit I have never heard a more unfair comment in all my life,\" Arthurson said.\n\n\"Most of those blokes, Daley included, are being paid in excess of the prime minister's money. If that's being treated like a dog, I wish someone would treat me like one.\"\n\nThe matter came to a head on what should have been the opening round of the 1996 season, with just four of the ten scheduled matches going ahead.\n\nBrisbane, Canterbury, North Queensland, Canberra, Cronulla, Penrith and the Western Reds all forfeited their opening matches, while Auckland was only prepared to field a second-string outfit. It was the first time since 1909 that matches had been forfeited.\n\nArthurson called the weekend \"dispiriting\" and in an address to the crowd at WIN Stadium before the season-opener between Illawarra and Wests, condemned the rebels.\n\n\"I didn't think I would see the day when players went on strike because their clubs didn't have the guts to tell them what their contractual obligations were,\" he said.\n\n\"The players are people who have been made wealthy by the game.\n\n\"Now they are turning their backs on a game that has given them everything.\"\n\nJust 30,198 spectators attended the four matches that weekend, with only 5,631 bothering to watch the Roosters play the Tigers at the 40,000 capacity Sydney Football Stadium.\n\n\"It was clear the game's traumas were having a devastating effect on its popularity and no one could take any joy from that,\" Daley wrote.\n\nThe final nail in the Super League coffin, at least for 1996, came when the Federal Court lifted a stay on an order which meant News Limited could no longer pay the players to sit on the sidelines.\n\n\"That was a body blow to our plans and effectively put a gun at the head of the players,\" Daley wrote.\n\n\"The cracks in Super League's wall that first started to appear after the original judgement was handed down burst wide open after this latest development.\n\n\"The threat that they would not be paid was too much for the rebel players and even though they continued to support Super League, they flooded back to their clubs.\"\n\nDaley wrote that he found himself \"backed into a corner\" having been such a vocal supporter of Super League, but he \"risked everything\" if he held out any further.\n\nThe Canberra five-eighth was one of the last players to return to the ARL competition, writing that sitting out the season on principle wouldn't help anyone.\n\n\"It wouldn't be good for the game, it wouldn't be good for the fans who have been so supportive – and the one who would suffer most would be me,\" he said at the time.\n\nDaley returned but Gorden Tallis was one who didn't, choosing instead to sit out the 1996 season. Having played with the ARL-aligned St George in 1995, he'd signed with Super League, and rather than return to the Dragons, he elected to wait until 1997 when he could join Brisbane.\n\nIt was an acrimonious period for the game, with two years of infighting preceding a split competition in 1997. The feelings of most rugby league supporters are perhaps best summed up by former Souths boss George Piggins.\n\n\"The years 1995-1996 were bloody awful ones for rugby league, with the game on the paddock almost totally submerged by what was happening off it,\" Piggins wrote in his book Never Say Die.\n\n\"Fans stayed away in droves and TV and radio ratings plummeted.\n\n\"Rugby league was changed forever.\""
