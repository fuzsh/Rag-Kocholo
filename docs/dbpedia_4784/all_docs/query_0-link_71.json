        "text": "Book British-Serbian Relations from the 18th to the 21st Centuries is the most comprehensive thematic collection of papers covering this field and is the result of two conferences held in London and Belgrade in 2017 and 2018. The book has been edited by S. G. Markovich and contributions have been written by authors from leading universities and institutions in the United Kingdom, Serbia, Montenegro and Hungary (London School of Economics, University College London, University of Belgrade, Institute for Balkan Studies of the Serbian Academy etc.). Additionally to scholars contributions have been written by current and previous diplomats of Great Britain and Serbia. The authors are: Cedomir Antic, Sasa Knezevic, David Norris, Bojan Aleksov, Zorica Becanovic Nikolic, Slobodan G. Markovich, Dragan Bakic, Dusan Babac, Eric Beckett Weaver, Radmila Radic, Zoran Milutinovic, Milan Ristovic, Vojislav Pavlovic, Ranko Bugarski, Nenad Sebek, Vukasin Pavlovic, Boris Hlebec, Vesna Goldsworthy, Katarina Rasulic, Lord Randall of Uxbridge, Amb. Denis Keefe, Amb. Aleksandra Joksimovic, David Gowan, Amb. Branimir Filipovic, Christopher Coker, Spyros Economides, and James Ker-Lindsay. The book covers the period from the visit of Dositey Obradovich to London in 1784/85 to 2018. Political, diplomatic and cultural relations of the two nations during the course of more than 230 years have been covered. The first two sections include the main episodes in the history of mutual political and cultural relations such as the Eastern Crisis, the roles of William Gladstone and Miss Irby, extraordinary relations during the Great War, relations of the Church of England and the Serbian Orthodox Church, studies of Shakespeare among Serbs, connection of British women and Serbia, the role of Serbian anglophiles, relations of the United Kingdom with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Communist Yugoslavia, and the relations of the dynasties of Windsor and Karageorgevich. In the third section the role of institutions that acted as intermediaries between the two cultures are analysed such as: the Department of English Language of the Faculty of Philology of the University of Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian sections of BBC and the English Speaking Union. There are also contributions on educational co-operation under international sanctions, a review of English-Serbian and Serbian-English dictionaries, but also an essay of what is it like to be an Anglo-Serbian writer. The last section is an analysis of diplomatic and political relations in the 21st century covering various aspects of a developed mutual co-operation, but also a series of sensitive issues such as the Kosovo Question, the impact of UN interventionism, but also a wider question of Serbia’s relations with the West.\n\nAfter sketching a relatively low level of knowledge about Britain in Serbia and vice versa prior to the Great War, the paper highlights the closer encounter of Serbia, the United Kingdom and the United States that occurred during the Great War, as well as the effect of that encounter on the subsequent Anglo-Serbian cultural relations. Specifically, the pertinent links during the Great War are analysed through (1) the stipends provided to Serbian schoolboys/students in Britain, (2) the stay of Serbian intellectuals in Britain, and (3) the impact of British-Serbian war cooperation on the Macedonian/Salonica Front; also taken into account is (4) the impact of Serbian volunteers from the United States. Subsequent Anglo-Serbian/Yugoslav cultural relations in the inter-war period are further analysed with regard to (1) Brits/Americans residing in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, (2) the continual British educational schemes for Serbian students, (3) the emergence of organised English language instruction in Serbia, and (4) the impact of numerous inter-war Anglophile associations in Serbia/Yugoslavia. The experience of the Great War is viewed as the turning point which paved the way for all subsequent forms of Anglo-Serbian (Yugoslav) cooperation in the fields of education and culture.\n\nBritish women are by far the most ubiquitous foreign women in recent Serbian history. Consequently, their story was often told, their travelogues that often cast a positive light on Serb and Serbia translated and re-published, and their humanitarian and unique military contributions celebrated. As British women are remarkable for often displaying different of alternative views from their male counterparts this article examines these specificities by illuminating some common motivations and trajectories that characterised these women and thier experiences with Serbs and Serbia. Moreover, it examines how much the tow sides knew and understood each other and what this relationship brought forward. Its time span stretches from the first contact until the Second World War before the relationship patterns changed and became much more complex.\n\nThis paper seeks to examine the outlook of the Serbian Minister in London, Mateja Mata Bošković, during the first half of the Great War on the South Slav (Yugoslav) question – a unification of all the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in a single state, which was Serbia’s war aim. He found himself in close contact with the members of the Yugoslav Committee, an organisation of the irredentist Yugoslav émigrés from Austria-Hungary in which two Croat politicians, Frano Supilo and Ante Trumbić, were leading figures. In stark contrast to other Serbian diplomats, Bošković was not enthusiastic about Yugoslav unification. He suspected the Croat émigrés, especially Supilo, of pursuing exclusive Croat interests under the ruse of the Yugoslav programme. His dealings with them were made more difficult on account of the siding of a group of British “friends of Serbia”, the most prominent of which were Robert William Seton-Watson and Henry Wickham Steed, with the Croat émigrés. Though not opposed in principle to an integral Yugoslav unification, Bošković preferred staunch defence of Serbian Macedonia from Bulgarian ambitions and the acquisition of Serb-populated provinces in southern Hungary, while in the west he seems to have been content with the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, part of Slavonia and an outlet to the Adriatic Sea in Dalmatia. Finally, the reception of and reaction to Bošković’s reports on the part of the Serbian Prime Minister, Nikola Pašić, clearly shows that the latter was determined to persist in his Yugoslav policy, despite the Treaty of London which assigned large parts of the Slovene and Croat lands to Italy and made the creation of Yugoslavia an unlikely proposition. In other words, Pašić did not vacillate between the “small” and the “large programme”, between Yugoslavia and Greater Serbia, as it has been often alleged in historiography and public discourse.\n\nThe paper discusses British diplomats in the Principality of Serbia and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1837 till 1919. In that period there were 14 British heads of mission in the rank of consul-general, minister resident and minister plenipotentiary. Basic data on British diplomats are given as well as some information on the role that their wives played in the Serbian society. The second part provides a list of eight Serbian heads of the Serbian mission in Britain and three chargés d’affaires. Two Serbian semi-diplomatic missions are also mentioned (from 1854 and 1863). Basic data on the diplomatic and other achievements of Serbian diplomats in London are given since many of them had very important non-diplomatic careers in Serbia.\n\n\"– Road to Great War – Serbian Intellectuals and Austro-Hungarian Policy in the Balkans (1894–1914)\", Serbian Political Thought, № 1 (2014), 67–89. ISSN: 1450–5460. Abstract The generation of Serbian Intellectuals who were active in the political and public life of Serbia at the turn of 19th and 20th century were considering problems of maintaining the attained independence of Serbia, a search for reliable support in foreign policy, integration of the nation and further economic, social, and cultural development. In the Europe characterized with complex relationships between the great powers, ambitious imperialist plans, instability and conflicts which were leading to the Great War (1914–1918), the Serbian intelligentsia, prevailingly educated in European university centers, was striving to find ways of accomplishing the idea of liberation and unification. The change of orientation in Serbian foreign policy, which began in the last decade of 19th century and was definitely confirmed with the raise of the Karadjordjević Dynasty to the Serbian throne (1903), was a manifestation of the need of Serbian politicians and intellectuals to facilitate liberation from economic dependence, development of the state and the national idea, by edging away from the reliance on Austria-Hungary. From the Congress of Berlin (1878), via the Customs War (1906–1911), the Annexation Crisis (1908) and the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the interest of Serbian intellectuals in the policy of Austria-Hungary in the Balkans was growing and intermingling with issues of the overall further development of Serbia. The aim of this paper is to shed a light onto the origins and development of the interest and the thinking of Serbian intellectuals regarding the policy and interests of Austria-Hungary in the Balkans in the period which immediately preceded World War I. The attitudes and thoughts of Serbian intellectuals which were published in periodicals (the Serbian Literary Gazette /Srpski književni glasnik/ and the Work /Delo/), press, brochures and books, are viewed in the context of Austro-Hungarian imperial thrust into the Balkans, which started with the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was definitely confirmed with the act of annexation and war plans. The efforts of Austria-Hungary to control the entire Balkans and occupy its central areas have also been studied in light of the confrontation between the two blocs of European powers, perception of the place of the Serbs and Serbia in the complicated international relations of the time, as well as in light of development of the Yugoslav idea, which was present among Serbian intellectuals prior to World War I. Keywords: Serbian intellectuals, Serbia, Austria-Hungary, the Balkans, the late 19th and early 20th century, the Great War (1914–1918)."
