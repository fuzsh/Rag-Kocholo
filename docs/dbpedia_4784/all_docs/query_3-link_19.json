        "text": "The Wests Group Australia\n\nOur mission is to bring pride, respect and success to our region through our commitment to members, rugby league, community and sporting excellence.\n\nThe Wests Group Australia (Wests) is a Newcastle owned and operated not-for-profit membership based organisation that provides entertainment, accommodation and dining, function and fitness facilities across the region. Our vision is to be our members third place, creating personalised experiences that excite, entertain, and inspire. We develop and nurture Rugby League as our primary sporting focus, in addition to other sports and impactful community projects. We strive to be a good corporate citizen and leader in our region.\n\nOur portfolio includes registered clubs Wests New Lambton (Western Suburbs (N’cle) Leagues Club) and Wests New Lambton Bowling Club, Wests Mayfield, Wests City, Wests Nelson Bay and Wests Cardiff. The Clubs are a source of enjoyment for thousands of members and visitors each day who come to enjoy the entertainment, bar and dining options.\n\nAccommodation is provided by The Executive and The Gateway, Newcastle and The Anchorage in Port Stephens, while Balance Collective is a state of the art Newcastle-owned chain of fitness centres offering exceptional facilities over two sites.\n\nIn 2016 we opened NEX, the Newcastle Exhibition & Convention Centre, which is a premium exhibition, entertainment and conference space in the heart of Newcastle city.\n\nIn 2017, we acquired The Newcastle Knights, an Australian professional Rugby League Football Club based in Newcastle, New South Wales.\n\nThe Knights compete in Australasia’s premier rugby league competition, the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership. The Knights joined the top tier competition in 1988; 79 years after the previous Newcastle based team, the Newcastle Rebels, had departed the Sydney competition with the formation of a separate league competition based in the Newcastle region.\n\nThe club has won two NRL premierships over its history (1997 and 2001) and produced such players as Andrew Johns, Danny Buderus, Matthew Gidley and Paul Harragon. Additionally, the Knights made history by winning the NRLW premierships in 2022 and 2023, becoming the first team to win back-to-back premierships. The Knights’ home ground is McDonald Jones Stadium, which competes on an international level with a capacity of 28,000.\n\nAt the core of our operation is a commitment to outstanding customer service, and a dedication to providing quality venues, food and entertainment for our members. Today, Wests is one of the largest private employers in the area, and an economic driver for the Hunter region.\n\nWe have been a proudly integral part of our local communities since we opened our doors in 1960, and offer substantial financial and in-kind support for schools, sporting teams and charities that make a real difference in our community."
