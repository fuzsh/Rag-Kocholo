        "text": "CAMDEN — Camden resident and artist Bayard S. Chanler, 70, passed away peacefully at home in late July. Born on July 7, 1954, in New York City, Bayard spent his childhood in Tuxedo Park, New York, and Palm Beach, FL, and enjoyed summers in Maine on Islesboro and 700 Acre Island. He was inspired to paint by three artists: his great uncle Robert Winthrop Chanler, Claude Monet, and Peter Max.\n\nBayard developed a unique and captivating style, particularly known for his floral and marine landscape paintings. His work has been showcased at Double Door Gallery, The Seven Knots Gallery, the Islesboro Historical Society, and LaRouche on Newbury Street in Boston. His pieces were collected by prominent figures such as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Kelly Preston and John Travolta, John Train, and the esteemed interior designer Sister Parish.\n\nBayard was known for his warm and loving personality, always showing genuine interest in the lives of his friends and loved ones. Bayard’s love of the arts spanned mediums. When he wasn’t painting, Bayard could often be found rewatching one of his favorite movies, a live concert recording, or assisting with visual merchandising at Margo Moore in Camden.\n\nHe is survived by his brother, William of Danvers, Massachusetts, and his two nephews, Michael of Portland, Maine, and James of Medford, Massachusetts. His family and friends will greatly miss him."
