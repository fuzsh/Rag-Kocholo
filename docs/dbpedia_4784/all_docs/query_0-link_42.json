        "text": "This week we will be mostly concerning ourselves with rugby's 'Core Values'…\n\nWelcome to Loose Pass – our weekly assortment of disjointed thoughts. This week we will be mostly concerning ourselves with rugby's 'Core values'…\n\nThe shame of it all, hey? Dean Richards allowed to walk away after being jailed for his part in the Lockerbie bombing…\n\nWe joke, of course, but the level of vitriol that has been heaped on the disgraced coach makes Abdel Baset al-Megrahi look like Mr Popularity.\n\nRichards deserves a bashing, of that there is no doubt. He cheated and, which is worse, lied about it and forced others to join him in his deception.\n\nBut when push came to shove he admitted he had made a massive mistake and fell squarely on his sword. So isn't it time we left him to grieve over the passing of his reputation in peace?\n\nThose that continue to thirst for his blood do so in the name of rugby's “core values”, but kicking a man when he is down runs contrary to the Corinthian standards that Richards's persecutors purport to uphold.\n\nRugby's “core values” extend far beyond respecting the laws of the game. They include compassion and generosity of spirit. You help your opponent to his feet after a tumble and you shake his hand and share a joke after a scuffle.\n\nRugby likes to consider itself a family, but families don't throw their own to the wolves. Rugby should support Richards as he attempts to rebuild his career – indeed, his life. Surely our “core values” include showing a little mercy?\n\nNo man is beyond redemption and one suspects that Richards is already on the path to righteousness – it won't take him the duration of his three-year suspension to comprehend the errors of his ways. Let's cut him some slack.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\n\nRichards will take solace in the resurrection of his former apprentice, Lawrence Dallaglio. An assassination attempt by the News of the World almost put pay to Dallaglio's career but he rose, Lazarus-like, from the ashes to cement his place among the greats of the game.\n\nHis rehabilitation (if such a process was needed) was so complete that he now sits on the RFU's ridiculously named 'Image of the Game Task Group' that has been “charged with cleaning up the sport and rebuilding its damaged reputation”.\n\nThe divergent fortunes of the two men bring to mind a passage from Dallaglio's autobiography. It's a story that sheds light on the enigma that is Dean Richards and rugby's esoteric internal principles – those “core values” if you must.\n\nOver to big Lol, who is reminiscing about his third senior game for Wasps, played out at Welford Road…\n\nIt was the first line-out of the match. Back of the line-out, Dean Ryan, Buster White and myself for Wasps; John Wells, Dean Richards and Neil Back for Leicester. The ball is coming toward us, I'm looking at it as a naÃ¯ve youngster would. Next thing I know, I am on the floor and my nose is across my face. Through the stars that are sprinting this way and that, Dean Ryan is talking to me.\n\n'Right, you know what's happened here,' he said. 'Next line-out, you're going to have to clock him one.'\n\nI said, 'You're talking about Dean Richards, I can't clock him one.'\n\n'If you don't hit him, he's going to be at you all afternoon. That'll be it for you. You're going to have to smack him one.'\n\nMy whole rugby career flashed before me in that moment. He had just asked me to hit Dean Richards, a legend I had watched on television and revered. But I had come from a boarding school background where you learn to take orders. Captain says, 'Clock him one' and so you do it. Next line-out, I timidly threw a punch at Richards, actually it was a fair punch but it was still the apprentice version of what he had thrown.\n\nLeicester went on to give us a right trouncing, but Dean Ryan was right. Dean Richards left me alone after I threw my punch. After the game he came over and bought me a drink, we had a chat and he's been a friend ever since.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\n\nTwickenham might not be able to abandon Richards, even if its preening Mary Whitehouses would like to.\n\nEngland once built a team around this man. Tens of thousands chanted his name as he mauled his way to back-to-back Grand Slams. As a coach he had instant success with Leicester Tigers and turned Quins, perennial under-achievers, into title contenders. Not only that, he practically schooled England's current head coach.\n\nMen like that don't come around too often and England's pool of coaching talent is particularly thin. Half the teams in the Guinness Premiership boast non-English head coaches, and their number could be up to seven if rumours linking a certain Scot to the Stoop are to be believed. England just can't afford to dismiss talent.\n\nGP coaches 2009/10: Bath: Steve Meehan (Australia); Gloucester: Bryan Redpath (Scotland); Harlequins: tba; Leeds Carnegie: Andy Key (England); Leicester Tigers: Richard Cockerill (England); London Irish: Toby Booth (England); Newcastle Falcons: Steve Bates (England); Northampton Saints: Jim Mallinder (England); Sale Sharks: Kingsley Jones (Wales); Saracens: Brendan Venter (South Africa) London Wasps: Tony Hanks (New Zealand); Worcester Warriors: Mike Ruddock (Wales).\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\n\nIncidentally, only five sides have ever bagged back-to-back Grand Slams: Wales in 1908/1909; England in 1913/1914, 1923/1924 and 1991/1992; France in 1997/1998.\n\nThere, that's one you can discharge in the pub. No, please don't thank us – 'tis all part of the service!\n\n————————————————————————————————————————\n\nRugby's appetite for sprints over marathons grows deeper by the day. The new Magners League season will culminate in play-offs contested by the top four finishers and England's new 12-team Championship – formally National One – will see the top eight finishers split into two groups of four playing home and away before semi-finals and a final.\n\nYes, that's right: an eighth-placed finish in the league will be rewarded with a shot at promotion to the Guinness Premiership. Does that seem sensible?\n\nWe shall be watching the competition with interest if not excitement – the temptation to coast through the beginning of the season will be too much for most teams to bear.\n\nMore worryingly, the format is also bound to impact the physical shape of the sides and the type of rugby which they play. Why bother nurturing a hulking pack when the important part of the season is played on the firm surfaces of spring and early summer?\n\nRugby's appeal as a game for all sizes has been under threat for some time, but this cash-driven craze for knock-out rugby"
