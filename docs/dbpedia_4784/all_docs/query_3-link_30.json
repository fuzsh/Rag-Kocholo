        "text": "At the same time, the regular season expands to 16 matches with each team will playing a double round-robin within its home conference, and single matches against four teams from each of the other conferences.\n\nThe Finals Series expand to six teams, with the conference winners joined by the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation. The two conference winners with the most competition points received a first-round bye.\n\nIn 2011 the Reds became the first Australian team outside the Brumbies to win a title, winning Super Rugby with a victory over the Crusaders in what was dubbed the battle of the hardship teams - with Queensland hit by floods and Christchurch rocked by a earthquake which disrupted both team's season.\n\nThe Chiefs went back-to-back the following two years with wins over the Sharks and Brumbies respectively, the Waratahs held the trophy aloft in 2014 with a thrilling win over the Crusaders while the Highlanders beat the Hurricanes to keep the trophy in the final season of Super Rugby as we knew it.\n\n2016 - 2017\n\nIn 2016, the evolution of Super Rugby continued with three new sides introduced to an expanded four-conference 18-team. The Kings from South Africa returned to the fray, along with new teams: the Jaguares from Argentina; and the Sunwolves from Japan, taking Super Rugby to new places, new markets and new crowds.\n\nThe 18 teams were arranged in four conferences.\n\nThe season comprised 135 regular season matches played across 17 rounds. After the regular season an eight-team, three-week, seven-match finals series determined the overall winner.\n\nRegular Season Pool Matches (two-year rotation)\n\nEach team played 15 matches (and has two byes).\n\nEach team will played 6 matches within its Conference\n\nEach team will played 9 matches against other Conference teams\n\nEach team had eight home matches and seven away matches (alternated over the two-year rotational draw cycle)\n\nInternal and cross conference opposition ‘swapped’ over the two-year draw cycle.\n\nQualify for finals\n\n4 Conference winners (host quarter-final)\n\n4 wildcards places\n\nWildcard spots:\n\nBest placed runner-up team (based on tournament points) from either Africa 1 or Africa 2 Conference\n\nThree next best teams (based on tournament points) from either the New Zealand or Australian Conferences\n\nQuarter-final Draw\n\nThe teams winning places in the Finals (Conference winners and wild cards) ranked 1-8 based on the final number of competition points attained and the following order.\n\nQF 1: 1 v 8\n\nQF 2: 2 v 7\n\nQF 3: 3 v 6\n\nQF 4: 4 v 5\n\nRank 1-4: Conference winners - rank determined by final number competition points\n\nRank 5-8: Wild card rankings determined by final number competition points\n\nSemi-final Draw:\n\nSF 1: Winner QF 1 v Winner QF 4\n\nSF 2: Winner QF 2 v Winner QF 3\n\nFinal:\n\nWinner SF1 v Winner SF2\n\n2018 - 2019\n\nIn a brave move that recognised that the 18-team format did not work, was confusing and had diluted the standards of the competition, SANZAAR announced in April 2017 that the tournament in 2018 would be restructured. The 18-team, four Conference format was changed to a 15-team, three Conference format. Gone from the competition were the Force (Australia), Kings and Cheetahs (South Africa). The Jaguares remained in the now one South African Conference while the Sunwolves joined the Australia Conference.\n\nAustralian Conference: Brumbies, Rebels, Reds, Waratahs, Sunwolves\n\nNew Zealand Conference: Blues, Chiefs, Crusaders, Highlanders, Hurricanes\n\nSouth African Conference: Bulls, Lions, Sharks, Stormers, Jaguares\n\nEach team played 16 regular season Conference matches that included eight matches within their own Conference (home and away) and four matches against teams from each of the other Conferences (home or away). This was 120 matches in the regular season with a seven-match, eight-team finals series.\n\nPoints Tabulation\n\nCompetition points were awarded in all Regular Season matches on the following basis:\n\nWin: 4 points\n\nDraw: 2 points\n\nLoss: 0 points for a loss of 8+ points\n\nBonus: 1 point for a loss between 1-7 points\n\nBonus: 1 point for scoring 3+ tries more than the opponent\n\nBye: 0 points\n\nFinals Series\n\nQuarter-final Hosts (4 teams)\n\nThree Conference winners\n\nBest Wildcard team – (based on tournament points) regardless of Conference\n\nQuarter-final Wildcard spots (4 teams)\n\nFour next best Wildcard teams (based on tournament points) regardless of Conference\n\nTie Breaking Rules:\n\nIn the event two or more teams equal on tournament points for any position in their respective conference at end of regular season, the following applied to determine final conference positions:\n\nMost wins from all matches;\n\nHighest aggregate points difference from all matches;\n\nMost tries from all matches;\n\nHighest aggregate difference of total tries for versus tries scored against from all matches;\n\nCoin toss.\n\nQuarter-final Draw:\n\nThe teams winning places in the Finals were ranked 1-8 based on Conference Winners and the final number of competition points attained and the following order.\n\nRank 1-3 Conference winners determined by final number competition points\n\nRank 4 – Best Wildcard team based on tournament points\n\nRank 5-8: Wild cards determined by final number competition points\n\nQF 1: 1 v 8\n\nQF 2: 4 v 5\n\nQF 3: 2 v 7\n\nQF 4: 3 v 6\n\nSemi-final Draw:\n\nSF 1: Winner QF 1 v Winner QF 2\n\nSF 2: Winner QF 3 v Winner QF 4\n\nFinal:\n\nWinner SF1 v Winner SF2\n\nSuper Rugby Reformatted (2020)\n\nDue to circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and governments putting in place strict border controls and limits on international travel, SANZAAR had no option but to suspend the 'regular' 2020 Super Rugby season. Eventually with only seven rounds played in the delayed regular season SANZAAR declared the 2020 competition void after further disruption. There was no winner of Super Rugby in 2020.\n\nHowever, SANZAAR and its member unions agreed to ensure Super Rugby returned to the field of play later in 2020 through a series of reformatted domestic competitions once government restrictions/quarantine procedures allowed it.\n\nFirst to kick-off was New Zealand on June 13. Australia followed in July, with South Africa following suit in October that year.\n\nResumption of Super Rugby\n\nInvestec Super Rugby Aotearoa was the first professional rugby competition in the world to have fans return en-masse in the Covid-19 era when the competition kicked off in Dunedin on June 13 when the Highlanders played the Chiefs at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin. The Crusaders won the round robin tournament after finishing top of the table [there was no final series].\n\nSuper Rugby Aotearoa competition format\n\nNew Zealand’s five Super Rugby clubs (Blues, Chiefs, Hurricanes, Crusaders and Highlanders).\n\n10-week round-robin (20 matches). Top of table declared winner.\n\nEight matches per club – four home, four away and two byes each.\n\nTwo matches per weekend – Saturday and Sunday.\n\nMatch venues: FMG Stadium Waikato, Hamilton; Sky Stadium, Wellington; Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin; Auckland and Orangetheory Stadium, Christchurch.\n\nLaw trials: Golden point tiebreaker [extra-time to be played in event of a draw at full-time; first points scorer to win]; the ability for teams to replace red carded players after 20 minutes; a renewed focus from referees on ensuring a fair contest at the breakdown.\n\nSuper Rugby AU (Australia)\n\nRugby Australia confirmed its domestic competition as part of SANZAAR’s solution for the remainder of the Super Rugby season. The remodelled domestic competition had a planned start date of early July.\n\nRugby Australia confirmed that the Western Force had officially signed on to join the four Australian Super Rugby teams in an Australia-based competition to be known as Vodafone Super Rugby AU. Due to travel restrictions the Sunwolves (part of the Australian Conference) were unable to compete in the tournament.\n\nThe Brumbies finished top of the table to secure home field advantage in the Final. They won the Final beating the Reds [second] who had previously beaten the Rebels [third] in a qualifying Final.\n\nSuper Rugby Australia competition format\n\nAustralia’s for Super Rugby clubs (Brumbies, Rebels, Reds and Waratahs) plus Western Force.\n\n12 weeks: 10-week round-robin, two week finals series (22 matches).\n\nEight matches per club in round-robin – four home, four away and two byes each.\n\nTwo matches per weekend – Friday and Saturday.\n\nMatch venues: Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane; CBUS Stadium, Gold Coast; GIO Stadium, Canberra; McDonald Jones Stadium, Newcastle; Brookvale Oval, ANZ Stadium, Leichhardt Oval and Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney.\n\nLaw trials: Goal-line dropout when attacking player held up over the line; goal-line drop out when a kick into in-goal is forced by defending team; marks only allowed in the in-goal area; the ability for teams to replace red carded players after 20 minutes; 50/22 - a kick taken from within the defending team’s 50m area that travels into touch within the opposition’s 22m area having first bounced in the field of play results in a lineout throw to the kicking team; 22/50 - A kick taken from within the defending team’s 22m area that travels into touch within the opposition’s 50m area having first bounced in the field of play results in a lineout throw to the kicking team; Super Time point tiebreaker [extra-time to be played in event of a draw at full-time; first points scorer to win]\n\nSuper Rugby Unlocked (South Africa)\n\nThe reformatted 2020 Super Rugby tournament in South Africa comprised seven teams that competed in a single-round, home or away series of matches over seven weeks. Like Aotearoa, there was no final series with the winner being the team with the most number of tournament points after the seven rounds.\n\nThe competing teams were the four Super Rugby clubs: Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers, plus the Cheetahs, Pumas and Griquas. The Bulls won the competition finishing first on the table [several matches were cancelled due to the pandemic].\n\n2021 Super Rugby\n\nThe ongoing effect of the pandemic and its effect on international travel and cross border sports tournaments meant that the 2021 season was also modified until certainty, vaccines and confidence in international travel could be restored. With Super Rugby due to kick-off in February at the start of the southern hemisphere season uncertainty remained and therefore domestic Super Rugby tournaments were again scheduled.\n\nHowever, the South African Rugby Union decided that for the present future its Super Rugby teams would compete in an expanded Pro 14 tournament in the northern hemisphere, so its teams (Bulls, Lions, Sharks, Stormers) would not compete in a Super Rugby tournament [like Super Rugby Unlocked in 2020).\n\nNew Zealand and Australia scheduled domestic Super Rugby tournaments as in 2020 with Super Rugby Aotearoa and Super Rugby AU kicking off in February. Both tournaments to comprise a round robin home and away, and New Zealand added a final match for 2021 with the top two qualifying for the Final. Australia maintained its 2020 tournament format with a two-match Finals series.\n\nIn an exciting move NZ Rugby and Rugby Australia also announced a Trans Tasman tournament to be played in May/June following the completion of the two domestic tournaments.\n\nThe tournaments to feature all 10 Super Rugby teams with each Australian team to play each New Zealand team [home or away] in 25 crossover matches before a Final.\n\nThe Final will be played between the top two placed teams on the combined competition table with the team who finished first to host the decider.\n\nSuper Rugby PACIFIC (2022 - present)\n\nThe world’s best provincial competition kicked off a new era in 2022 with Super Rugby Pacific to take the game to fresh heights, following an agreement between Rugby Australia (RA) and New Zealand Rugby (NZR).\n\nOn 18 February 2022, the new 12-team competition welcomed the introduction of Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika who joined the five Australian and five New Zealand sides - a tournament delivered by the joint venture partnership between RA and NZR.\n\nThe competition structure for Super Rugby Pacific is as follows:\n\n12 teams (alphabetical order) with Blues, Brumbies, Chiefs, Crusaders, Fijian Drua, Highlanders, Hurricanes, Melbourne Rebels, Moana Pasifika, NSW Waratahs, Queensland Reds, Western Force\n\n18-week competition window from 18 February to 18 June 2022 and 24 February to 24 June 2023\n\n91 matches in total\n\nTeams will play 14 regular season matches with each team to host seven matches\n\nTeams will play 8 teams once and 3 teams twice with a focus on derby matches\n\nOne competition table with teams ranked 1 to 12 based on competition points\n\nThree-week playoff format involving the top eight teams on the overall competition table with quarters, semis and final as follows:\n\nQuarterfinals – 1 v 8, 2 v 7, 3 v 6 and 4 v 5 with the top ranked team hosting\n\nSemi-Finals – top ranked quarter-final winner hosts against lowest ranked quarter-final winner & 2nd highest ranked quarterfinal winner hosts 3rd highest ranked quarterfinal winner\n\nFinal – top ranked semi-final winner hosts the other semi-final winner\n\nRoll of Honour\n\nSuper 12\n\n1996 Blues\n\n1997 Blues\n\n1998 Crusaders\n\n1999 Crusaders\n\n2000 Crusaders\n\n2001 Brumbies\n\n2002 Crusaders\n\n2003 Blues\n\n2004 Brumbies\n\n2005 Crusaders\n\nSuper 14\n\n2006 Crusaders\n\n2007 Bulls\n\n2008 Crusaders\n\n2009 Bulls\n\n2010 Bulls\n\nSuper Rugby\n\n2011 Reds\n\n2012 Chiefs\n\n2013 Chiefs\n\n2014 Waratahs\n\n2015 Highlanders\n\n2016 Hurricanes\n\n2017 Crusaders\n\n2018 Crusaders\n\n2019 Crusaders\n\n2020 No Winner [cancelled due to pandemic]\n\nSuper Rugby Unbroken (RSA)\n\n2020 Bulls\n\nSuper Rugby Aotearoa (NZ)\n\n2020 Crusaders\n\n2021 Crusaders\n\nSuper Rugby AU (Australia)\n\n2020 Brumbies\n\n2021 Reds\n\nSUPER RUGBY TRANS TASMAN\n\n2021 Blues\n\nSuper Rugby Pacific"
