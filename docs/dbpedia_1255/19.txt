MediaCoder is a universal media transcoding software actively developed and maintained since 2005. It puts together most cutting-edge audio/video technologies into an out-of-box transcoding solution with a rich set of adjustable parameters which let you take full control of your transcoding. New features and latest codecs are added or updated constantly. MediaCoder might not be the easiest tool out there, but what matters here is quality and performance. It will be your swiss army knife for media transcoding once you grasp it.
