I've tried using cuda.exe in Hydra and from commandline with Virtualdub's external encoder feature. I've tried using different versions of Mediacoder which supports cuda encoding with CudaH264Enc but I am having no luck at all. I'm pretty sure that I was able to use Mediacoder in the past but it will not work now.\n\nI have an EVGA GTS450 on a Gigabyte EP35-DS3P with a Q6600 CPU and 4GB of G.SKIL DDR2 1066 memory.\n\nWhat would cause cuda not to work and is there a program that I can use to see if it is working and force it to work if it is not working?\n\nI wasn't getting an error with Mediacoder before, it just kept jumping to the x264 encoder but after reinstalling the newest version I got a pop window saying that something was blocking the Cuda thread and asked me if I wanted to continue. Cuda.exe always crashes at the same point with Hydra and Virtualdub when cuda is called to start encoding.\n\nI really don't know what to do besides installing XP again but it's becoming a tiresome task and not fixing the problem. I've installed all the VB redistributables and net framework versions.\n\n9 Replies\n\nmaniacvvv\n\nOmnipotent Enthusiast\n\nTotal Posts : 9897\n\nReward points : 0\n\nJoined:\n\nLocation: Miami Beach FL\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRibbons : 165\n\nRe:Can't get cuda encoding working (permalink)\n\nWelcome to the EVGA forums\n\nPlease post you current Nvidia driver version\n\nnoviceal\n\nNew Member\n\nTotal Posts : 32\n\nReward points : 0\n\nJoined:\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRibbons : 0\n\nRe:Can't get cuda encoding working (permalink)\n\nTry loading [link=mailto:Folding@Home]Folding@Home[/link] for XP.

Installed MB drivers. Installed EVGA driver off of Installation disk (260.63 I believe). Downloaded Hybrid.7z and tried to run Hybrid.exe. It crashed instantly (I think you have to install VB 2010 to cure that). Open Virtualdub from my unzipped folder and directed the external encoder to the cuda.exe file in the Hybrid folder and clicked save to encode the video, expecting a crash and to my surprise, it encoded a 219MB video using the cuda encoder in 38 seconds. :)\n\nIt wasn't quite as fast as I thought it would be at 188fps but from the command line, I guess it was expected. I guess I can go ahead and install my printer, scanner and graphics tablet and all my programs and drivers. I don't think I'll install SP3 or any updates.\n\nIf anyone is interested in using the external encoder feature in Virtualdub to encode H264 with cuda, there is a thread on the Virtualdub forums to teach you how to create the encoder sets.\n\nYou can download the Hybrid program from Videohelp or Selur's website\n\nOpen Virtualdub abd under optios, select external encoders\n\nCreate a new encoder Profile: (cuda)\n\nType: video encoder\n\nProgramm: Path to Cuda.exe\n\nCommand arguments: --resolution %(width)x%(height) --input - --sar 1x1 --format YV12 --control_mode cq --fps %(fps) --profile high --level auto --offload partial --measure FPS --showFrameStats 100 --deinterlace true --frame_typ frame --pframe_dist 1 --gop_max 250 --dynamicGOP true --pquant_min 12 --bquant_min 15 --iquant_min 10 --deblock true --cavlc false --nal_typ auto --sps_pps false --slices auto --output \"%(tempvideofile)\"\n\nOutput filename: %(outputname)\n\nLaunch parameters: all enabled\n\nCreate a new Encoder set: (cuda)\n\nVideo encoder: the profile you just created (cuda)\n\nFile description: 264\n\nFile extension: 264\n\nTo encode the video: File -> Export -> Using external encoders -> select the just created encoder set -> click Ok -> enter output name + Save\n\nmaniacvvv\n\nOmnipotent Enthusiast\n\nTotal Posts : 9897\n\nReward points : 0\n\nJoined:\n\nLocation: Miami Beach FL\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRibbons : 165\n\nRe:Can't get cuda encoding working (permalink)\n\nDo yourself a favor, set a RESTORE point.. now while everything is working.\n\nThen do NOT put everything back in at once.\n\nSetup a very small 30sec render for testing, then put things back in slowly! One or two at a time and reboot after each install.\n\nRun the test render after items are installled and the computer has been rebooted.\n\nThis should give you a known recovery point and help point out \"where' problems occur\n\nZ.PricyWolf\n\nCLASSIFIED Member\n\nTotal Posts : 2560\n\nReward points : 0\n\nJoined:\n\nLocation: Japan\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRibbons : 2\n\nRe:Can't get cuda encoding working (permalink)\n\nDarrellS011\n\nCan't get...\n\nme too, Only a Mediacoder Away\n\nbut, none problem.\n\nbcuz It may be the specification of side Mediacoder.\n\nThere here, it's seriously.\n\nI still Away.\n\nAnd You can go to that forum.\n\nThey're here,\n\n・Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 12 (Only to Sony AVC.\n\n・Badaboom\n\n・Super LoiLoScope\n\n・PowerDirector 7\n\n・ArcSoft TotalMedia\n\n・Theater vReveal\n\npost edited by ZonePricyWolf -\n\n122-CK-NF68-AR / 122-CK-NF68-A1 / 132-CK-NF78-A1 / 132-YW-E178-A1 / 132-YW-E179-A1 / 151-IB-E699-KR\n\n128-A8-N303-TX / 512-P3-N973-TR*2 / 012-P3-1570-AR*2 / 012-P3-1572-AR / 03G-P4-3788-KR\n\n⊰━━━━━━━≪☆≪ ☆･.*--ﾟ– ☆⊲･*-.-ﾟ– ☆･⊲⊰.-･-*-ﾟ- ☆-⊰･*-.-ﾟ– -\n\nReynard11\n\nNew Member\n\nTotal Posts : 15\n\nReward points : 0\n\nJoined:\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRibbons : 0\n\nRe:Can't get cuda encoding working (permalink)\n\nI'm no expert on this stuff but I use Powerdirector 9 occasionally which uses CUDA to great effect. Last time I went to use it, it was working extremely slow... almost unusable. Turns out every NVidia driver after 301.42 doesn't allow CUDA to work with that software. (of course Cyberlink released a patch for PD10 & 11 but not 9 leaving me out in the weeds if I wanted to use a Kepler card and still get the CUDA benefits with the program... but that's another story! )\n\nAnyway, I went back to that driver (301.42) and back to the speed I came to know and love. Might be worth a try."
