Programming Some functions of JavaScript or of other programming languages, as parts that I made when I programmed something or for my web pages.\n\nParts that I will introduce may be with JavaScript, because I don't have a programming language on my Windows95 now.\n\nBut any of them may be help for other programming languages. Doodle My opinions or ideas for events around me, or articles I see on the Net. Exclude things too personal.\n\n(only in Japanese text)\n\nEach columns have a written date, but I change descriptions or add some comments to them at any time I want. So, if you've read the past columns at that time, that does not mean you've read all my comments at late time. Pleas check each column's date of changes/adds on index page of doodle, or check changes/adds dates on each column pages. Graphics Character graphics etc. that I made. Misc Miscellaneous page. Such as memorandum about color printer, how to make 3D-image by flatbed scanner, bunch of low techs or how to boot-up DOS mode with Windows Me, Clearance sale info etc. Gate An entrance pages for only my acquaintance. About Me Self introduction. What's New Enumeration for changing pages by seriese in time.(end of this page). Links Web sites that I am interested in.\n\n(It must contain few dead-links, because I sometimes check them.)"
