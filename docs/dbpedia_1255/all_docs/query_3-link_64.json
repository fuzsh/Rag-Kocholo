It puts together most cutting-edge audio/video technologies into an out-of-box transcoding solution with a rich set of adjustable parameters which let you take full control of your transcoding. (Copy of the Vendor Homepage: http://www.mediacoderhq.com/ ) Abstract Advisory Information: ============================== An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a local buffer overflow in the official MediaCoder v0.8.45 software client. Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline: ================================== 2016-07-28: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory) Discovery Status: ================= Published Affected Product(s): ==================== Mediacoder HQ Product: Media Coder - Software Client 0.8.45 Exploitation Technique: ======================= Local Severity Level: =============== Medium Technical Details & Description: ================================ A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the official MediaCoder v0.8.45 software. The vulnerability allows local attackers to overwrite the registers to compromise the local software process. The classic buffer overflow vulnerability is located in the software MediaCoder. An attacker can manipulate the bit EIP register in order to execute the next instruction of their choice. Attackers are able to for example execute arbitrary codes with process privileges. The attacker includes a large unicode string to overwrite the EIP register of the process. Finally the attacker is able to takeover the process by an overwrite of the active program process to compromise the computer system. The security risk of the buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.0. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege or restricted system user account without user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in computer system manipulation and compromise of the computer system. Proof of Concept (PoC): ======================= The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account and without user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue. Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ... 1. Launch MediaCoder.exe 2. Run the code in perl and a file format (.txt) will create 3. Click File - Add URL 4. open the file (.txt) and copy paste characters http://AAAAAAA .... 5. Made a double click on the link 6. Software will crash with Access violation 7. Successful reproduce of the local buffer overflow vulnerability! --- Debug Session Logs [WinDBG] --- Access violation - code c0000005 (!!! second chance !!!) eax=00547c38 ebx=01e2bb48 ecx=91543bdb edx=80000000 esi=002b07c6 edi=00547c38 eip=41414141 esp=0014f464 ebp=41414141 iopl=0 nv up ei pl zr na pe nc cs=001b ss=0023 ds=0023 es=0023 fs=003b gs=0000 efl=00210246 41414141 ?? ???
