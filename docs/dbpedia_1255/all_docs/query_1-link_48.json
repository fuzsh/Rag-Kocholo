The other half is the media object path. complete these fields:\n\nQueue Name\n\nQueue Path On-Line\n\nQueue Path Off-line\n\nOn-Line Access Type\n\nOff-Line Access Type\n\nIn the Queue Path On-Line field, enter a path that points to the location of OLE objects, images, or URLs. The queue path is the second half of a properly defined queue for a media object. The first half is the name of the media object. A valid queue path for a network location might be \\\\server1\\share3\\images\\financial. To set the queue for a CD ROM, use cd: in the pathname; the system automatically substitutes the appropriate drive letter when it resolves the path.\n\nIn the Queue Path Off-line field, enter a local path that points to the location of OLE objects, images, or URLs. The queue path is the second half of a properly defined queue for a media object. The first half is the name of the media object. A valid queue path when working off-line might be d:\\data\\media\\images."
