        "text": "Reserved pricing is for customers that have predictable and consistent ongoing usage. It is ideal for workflows where encoding jobs are queued up and processed over time. With reserved pricing, there isn't a Basic or Professional tier division, as each purchased reserved transcoding slot supports the full suite of capabilities. Optional add-on features including Dolby Audio and Audio Normalization are available for an additional fee, and are billed per minute of output. Dolby Vision encoding, Accelerated Transcoding, Automated ABR, AV1 encoding, InSync FrameFormer frame rate conversion, and 8K resolution processing are not available in reserved pricing. For more information, please see the reserved queues documentation.\n\nTo use reserved pricing, you pay for reserved transcode slots, which are billed at a fixed monthly rate with a minimum 12-month commitment. You can purchase multiple slots using the console and apply them to your reserved queues. A simple calculator is available in the console to provide an estimate of how many slots are required. You will need to first run a typical job in an on-demand queue using the simulate reserved queue feature, observe how long the job takes to complete, set a maximum desired turnaround time, and the calculator will estimate the number of reserved transcode slots required.\n\nYou may incur additional charges if you use AWS Elemental MediaConvert with other AWS services. For example, you may incur charges from Amazon S3 for storage of source and transcoded media files, Amazon S3 for data transfer when your Amazon S3 bucket is in a region other than the one in which you submitted your transcoding job, Amazon CloudFront for CDN delivery, and AWS Lambda for creating watch folder processing. For more information about Amazon S3 charges, including pricing for transferring your content out of AWS, see Amazon S3 Pricing."
