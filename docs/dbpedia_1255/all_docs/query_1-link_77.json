        "text": "Han, I appreciate very much your quick and clear reply.\n\nelan0.log says: “Preferred media framework ‘NativeWindows’ can not handle: file:///Z:/filename.mpg”. Strange, since the files were converted from asf to mpg1 using SuperConverter. However, after I converted them to mpg2, they are displayed.\n\nOn the other hand, Elan recommends to uninstall the mpg2 codec that came with K-lite codec pack, which in turn are necessary to enable WMP to display the mpg1 files.\n\nTom, I think WMP (in fact Direct Show) can handle regular mpg-1 files without having to install any additional codec. If you are only working with mpg-1 files you could uninstall any mpeg-2 codec you have.\n\nIf you have had a warning message from ELAN advising you to uninstall an mpeg-2 codec, you probably have an older Elecard codec installed. You could consider to purchase the latest Elecard mpeg-2 codec/plugin. The main problem that we know with that one is, that it is no longer possible to play mpg-1 files in slow motion in ELAN after installing it. In our experience the older Elecard codecs are more problematic.\n\nThe mpg1 files that I produced with Super Converter (build 24 or 25) are not displayed in WMP11, and ELAN sticks with initializing them. After installing K-Lite codec pack (except mpg2 codec), WMP11 does display these mpg1 files well, but ELAN still does not. Rather, ELAN now recommends uninstalling the mpg2 codec.\n\nOn the other hand, with or without k-lite codec pack, ELAN easily displays mpg2 files produced with Super.\n\nUnfortunately, here arises a separate problem. If running in Media synchronisation mode, ELAN does not keep the mpg2 files synchronized. After two minutes, they differ for more than 30 seconds. I am not sure, if this might be due to different resolution of the 2 simultanenous videos (1024x768 vs. 1280x800).\n\nIt would be interesting to see which “filter” is used to play mpg-1 in case you have uninstalled K-Lite. In the ELAN log locate the line “Filters in the filter chain:”, listing the used filters. Just above the\n\nindex: x name: file:///…\n\nthere is the media splitter. If no special codecs have been installed this should be “MPEG-I Stream Splitter”. If this is the case and the file is not correctly played, there’s probably something wrong with the mpg-1 encoding.\n\nWe known of 2 mpeg-2 video’s running out of sync with any playback rate other than 1 (system and codec dependent). If 2 video’s are running out of sync it is pretty much beyond the control of ELAN (whether a different resolution/dimension is causing this or not).\n\nThe mpg1 files in question can not played at all by ELAN, their initialization never comes to an end. They have in common that they were created with SUPER, using MEncoder.\n\nToday, I converted the same original asf files to mpg1 with MediaCoder, using FFmpeg. These ones can be handled by ELAN with ease.\n\nI was not expert enough to foresee that MEncoder does something to mpg1 files that cant be dealt with by ELAN.\n\nAs for synchronization, after 120 sec of running, these files differ by 30 seconds.\n\nelan0.log :\n\nFilters in the filter chain:\n\nindex: 0 name: Default DirectSound Device\n\npin: 0 name: Audio Input pin (rendered)\n\nindex: 1 name: Video Renderer\n\npin: 0 name: VMR Input0\n\nindex: 2 name: ffdshow Audio Decoder\n\npin: 0 name: Out\n\npin: 1 name: In\n\nindex: 3 name: MainConcept MPEG Video Decoder\n\npin: 0 name: Video In\n\npin: 1 name: Video Out\n\nindex: 4 name: MPEG-I Stream Splitter\n\npin: 0 name: Input\n\npin: 1 name: Video\n\npin: 2 name: Audio\n\nindex: 5 name: file:///Z:/Video/Aufnahmen/Morae/_simultan/2008,01,01 14 04 41.scr.mpg1.mpg\n\npin: 0 name: Output\n\nMedia splitter filter name: MPEG-I Stream Splitter\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.3333334\n\nMillis per Sample: 40.0\n\noffset: 0\n\nduration: 1747983\n\nNo media export functionality available\n\nClean up media player…\n\nUsing Windows Native Media Player DS\n\nFilters in the filter chain:\n\nindex: 0 name: Default DirectSound Device\n\npin: 0 name: Audio Input pin (rendered)\n\nindex: 1 name: Video Renderer\n\npin: 0 name: VMR Input0\n\nindex: 2 name: ffdshow Audio Decoder\n\npin: 0 name: Out\n\npin: 1 name: In\n\nindex: 3 name: MainConcept MPEG Video Decoder\n\npin: 0 name: Video In\n\npin: 1 name: Video Out\n\nindex: 4 name: MPEG-I Stream Splitter\n\npin: 0 name: Input\n\npin: 1 name: Video\n\npin: 2 name: Audio\n\nindex: 5 name: file:///Z:/Video/Aufnahmen/Morae/_simultan/2008,01,01 14 04 41.scr.mpg1.mpg\n\npin: 0 name: Output\n\nMedia splitter filter name: MPEG-I Stream Splitter\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.3333334\n\nMillis per Sample: 40.0\n\noffset: 0\n\nduration: 1747983\n\nUsing Windows Native Media Player DS\n\nFilters in the filter chain:\n\nindex: 0 name: Default DirectSound Device\n\npin: 0 name: Audio Input pin (rendered)\n\nindex: 1 name: Video Renderer\n\npin: 0 name: VMR Input0\n\nindex: 2 name: ffdshow Audio Decoder\n\npin: 0 name: Out\n\npin: 1 name: In\n\nindex: 3 name: MainConcept MPEG Video Decoder\n\npin: 0 name: Video In\n\npin: 1 name: Video Out\n\nindex: 4 name: MPEG-I Stream Splitter\n\npin: 0 name: Input\n\npin: 1 name: Video\n\npin: 2 name: Audio\n\nindex: 5 name: file:///Z:/Video/Aufnahmen/Morae/_simultan/2008,01,01 14 07 11.scr.mpg1.mpg\n\npin: 0 name: Output\n\nMedia splitter filter name: MPEG-I Stream Splitter\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.6\n\nMillis per Sample: 40.0\n\noffset: 0\n\nduration: 2320509"
