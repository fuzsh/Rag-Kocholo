        "text": "MediaCoder is a universal audio / video encoder that bundles a wide range of well-known media codecs and tools in one simple, intuitive GUI. The software is updated on a regular basis in order to provide users with the latest versions of the applications it includes.\n\nIn other words, Media Coder converts between various audio and video formats. It might come in handy for encoding files to fit the media format requirements of modern playback devices.\n\nUser interface\n\nThe interface may be a little overwhelming at first because there are so many features included here. Advanced users will surely get a kick out of MediaCoder, while rookies may activate the \"Simple\" mode for hiding several tweaking parameters from the main panel or use the configuration wizard and follow the built-in steps.\n\nSupported file formats and other handy features\n\nYou first need to select the source file you wish to convert, whether it's a video or audio track, the format of the output file, additional settings if you want to, and Start Transcoding (or hit F5 on your keyboard).\n\nMediaCoderâ€™s list of supported formats includes MPG, VOB, AVI, RMVB, MOV, MP4, MP3, OGG, AAC, WAV for input and AVI, MKV, MP4, Xvid, DivX, H.264, MPEG for output, to name the most important ones.\n\nExtra tools to play with\n\nThere are a lot of additional features for each file type, too. For example, if you want to convert a file to XviD format, you can enable high quality mode, greyscale, cartoon, quarter-pixel, or global motion compensation, while a FLAC output file's compression level can be configured. The time for each file to complete conversion is excellent, and the quality is fairly maintained overall.\n\nBottom line\n\nTo conclude, the general look and feel for MediaCoder is that it was created for advanced users. The wide range of parameter options is outstanding, but it cannot be comprehended by computer beginners."
