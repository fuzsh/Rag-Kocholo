Feeling our pain, blogger Andrew Flusche details how to extract the audio from your video podcasts so that you, too, can listen to it on-the-go.\n\nUsing previously mentioned open source transcoding app MediaCoder, Andrew demonstrates the process in a few simple steps. While this won't work well for some video podcasts (when the visual aspect is necessary), the author points out that there are video podcasts, like The Merlin Show, that don't always need the video to get the gist. If there is a point in the audio you didn't understand, you can always consult the video when you're back at your computer."
