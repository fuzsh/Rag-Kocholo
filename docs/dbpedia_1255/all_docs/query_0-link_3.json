In this mode, MediaCoder can be used to benchmark your hardware with media transcoding based on the your transcoding settings. During the process, the media content will be transcoded as in normal mode. The difference is there is no file created on hard drive and a benchmark result will be shown on the end of the procedure.\n\nThe steps to perform transcoding benchmark are as simple as following:\n\nAdd files used for benchmarking\n\nSet up transcoding parameters\n\nSet task mode to “Benchmark”\n\nClick Start button to start benchmarking\n\nRead the rest of this entry >>\n\nMediaCoder has some part of its GUI written with XUL which requires Mozilla’s Gecko engine to render.

However, as is reported by some users, MediaCoder’s XUL interface is not working as expected in their Firefox. Also some people don’t want to accept Firefox to be installed into their system for some reasons. An alternative to get XUL interface shown is by using XULRunner, the XUL runtime package.\n\nIt is exteremely simple to get MediaCoder work with XULRunner. First, download XULRunner and extract the files from the package to some place. Start MediaCoder and go to Options menu and choose Browser setup. Click the “…” button, navgiate to the XULRunner folder and choose xulrunner.exe. Click OK button to confirm and it’s done.\n\nCreating a file that will playback on an IPOD device (H.264/MP4 Basic Setup)\n\nMany MediaCoder users want to be able to playback media content with their portable devices.

This article describes how to use MediaCoder to convert just about any playable media file for playing back on an IPOD device.\n\nRead the rest of this entry >>"
