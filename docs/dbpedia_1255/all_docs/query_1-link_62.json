I think this may work because I have tried using an encoding program called Mediacoder which has separate exe files for the GUI and the encoder itself, allowing me to use Virtu MVP to just force the encoder to I-GPU mode.\n\nRight now in OBS, I am still able to use quicksync to encode if I use Virtu MVP but unable to use Game Capture (I'm guessing it's because OBS isn't seeing my dedicated graphics anymore). Of course the second virtual monitor works fine but a clunky workaround."
