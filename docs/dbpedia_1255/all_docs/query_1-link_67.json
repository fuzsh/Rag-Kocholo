(Sansa Media Converter) uses the term “convert” meaning to actually Transfer the file (video or audio, etc) ONTO sansa device.\n\nWhat I am trying to do is _ Convert or Change _ over a WVA video file onto a video file that Sansa Fuze supports.\n\nMy library (http://www.suffolkwave.org/16B6FCC8-3B43-4E8B-BCFC-AE60354E6EBB/10/380/en/Default.htm) has tons of videos and audiobooks plus music for free. I have no problems with audio books transfering over to Sansa.\n\nI have tried to find AND have downloaded many programs such as:\n\nhttp://www.downloadvideos-convert.com/\n\nMediaCoder - Universal Media Transcoder Free Download\n\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/\n\nhttp://www.avs4you.com/downloads.aspx?prod=36\n\nMediaconverter.org\n\nplus MANY more…\n\nI have contacted so many different forums too.\n\nNobody seems to help.\n\nSansa Tech, forget about it…they are NO help at all!"
