I could really use some suggestions for a tested and working workflow. Thanx\n\n/eX\n\nit does not natively support streaming I think\n\nogg theora just happens to be both a fixed file and a stream file format.\n\nbut you will realize that various common handles cease to work with streaming as there is no file size thus no progress for example and things like that.\n\nWhen I’m in the position to create any kind of video streaming my first stop is always the same, VLC actually.\n\nI’ve not tested it with unity as I have no need for video streaming, only used it for web located movie files.\n\nBut to be on the sure side: you have it completely implemented for usage as found in the example at ScriptReference - WWW.movie?\n\nIncluding the audioclip assignement\n\nThanx Dreamora, VLC did actually support conversion to ogg with Theora AND Vorbis\n\nWhen trying to convert from a WMV I got choppy results, but then I tired another from uncompressed QT and I got good results.\n\nThanx again. Ironic, I use VLC for playback but didn’t realize I could use it for conversion\n\n/eX\n\nIf you want to request it as feature, don’t go to the thread, as thats a bit of useless. Instead check out feedback.unity3d.com if the ticket already exists, if not, add it"
