        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nThanks for all the effort so far.\n\nThe error posted by drKuli is exactly what I am getting as well. No video is available and the file is very small. It looks like only the audio is wrapped in the new container or something.\n\nI also use a 32 bit version (on vista), but I have been looking in to going 64 bit as my machine already has 4 Gb.\n\nI have a work laptop available with windows 7 64 Bit. I will test the procedure on that as well (I am sure my boss wont mind ;-))\n\nAs for the software that came with the camera. It will definitely not suffice for my editing needs. As a long term pinnacle user I expect a little bit more. The reasons I want to use Lightworks are very plain and simple:\n\nA. I like the fact I can play with the same toys the big boys are using.\n\nb. I like the fact that some day it will work on Linux and I can dump windows all together (video editing has still left me using windows)\n\nc. After playing around a bit with the lightworks interface I am really starting to enjoy it.\n\nSo for now I won't delete pinnacle from my system, but hopefully with the efforts of everybody here some day soon I can..\n\nI will get back to this forum post once I have tried conversion on the 64 bit system.\n\nI could also shoot some sample with the 1080p setting and upload that, if you are interested. Sofar I have not used the 1080p setting as it produces lager files and I want to add the final film to blue-ray format (on DVDs, or file for my media center) anyway so there is not much point not using the AVCHD format.\n\n@shaunthesheep\n\nCan you tell me:\n\na. What the file size for the MPG-I frame files is (is it much bigger?)\n\nb. How long it takes to transcode?\n\nc. Do I need to keep in mind any special steps or tools in the trans-coding process?\n\nSorry to ask all the questions, but I have very little free time (with kids and all), so any problems I can avoid helps me be more productive."
