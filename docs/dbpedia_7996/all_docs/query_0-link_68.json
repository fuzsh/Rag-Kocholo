        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger knew his distant pal Rob Lowe would be back one day.\n\nThe Terminator star put Lowe on blast for siding with his ex-wife Maria Shriver after their 2011 divorce on a recent episode of Lowe's Literally podcast. Schwarzenegger and Shriver separated after 25 years of marriage shortly after the actor admitted that he had fathered a son, Joseph Baena, with their housekeeper.\n\n\"Let the story be told that, since I got divorced from Maria, you haven't been around much because you wanted to prove to her that you're loyal to her and not to me,\" Schwarzenegger told Lowe. \"Even though we didn't have any of those things, we always had friends that were loyal to me and her and didn't get involved in all this stuff, but you did.\"\n\n\"I think she got custody,\" Lowe replied.\n\nSchwarzenegger recalled once asking Shriver why Lowe wasn't \"showing up\" for any of their proposed hangout sessions.\n\n\"Every time I run into [Lowe], he says, 'Let's smoke a stogie together. Yeah, I'm coming down to L.A. I have an apartment now in L.A. because I'm doing my TV shows in L.A.' Because Rob, of course, is working day and night,\" he said. \"If he does not have a TV show, or if a TV show gets canceled, then he has, three seconds later, another TV show. It doesn't stop with the TV shows or with the movies or with all this stuff, so he's in front of the camera all the time.\"\n\nDuring one such encounter, Schwarzenegger said that Lowe invited himself over to smoke at his house one weekend, but did not actually attend.\n\n\"I said, 'Sure, come over, when are you gonna come?' [Lowe] said, 'This coming weekend, I guarantee you,' and, of course, now it's years later and now, finally, we're doing a podcast,\" he said. \"I was just like, this is crazy. But, all jokes aside, I have to say that I missed you. Why? Because, I mean, you and I, we had just so many things in common. So many crazy stuff.\"\n\nThat includes a memorable ski trip that the pair took to Sun Valley. \"We were skiing with Clint Eastwood and all of those guys and had a wonderful time, so we really had a lot of fun, and you came over to the house all the time,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"I kinda missed all that stuff.\"\n\nDuring Lowe's absence from his life, Schwarzenegger said that he hoped one day the 9-1-1: Lone Star actor would eventually \"wake up and say, 'You know, I can hang out with Arnold again and Maria's not going to decapitate me.'\"\n\nLowe accepted and, ultimately, agreed with Schwarzenegger's assessment of his behavior after the couple's divorce. \"I can't disagree with anything that's been said here. I can't disagree,\" he admitted. \"Maria's scarier than you to me. I'm way more scared of Maria than I'm scared of you.\"\n\n\"Well, apparently,\" Schwarzenegger quipped.\n\nLowe continued, \"And it's true, I'm a casualty of the divorce, but I'm now exerting my own will and I'm back. I'm back! This is the beginning of the bike rides, of the feeding cookies to Lulu and Whiskey,\" he said, referring to the former California governor's pet donkey and miniature horse.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" Arnold said.\n\nListen to Schwarzenegger and Lowe discuss their friendship in the podcast above.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRelated content:"
