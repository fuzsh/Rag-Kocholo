        "text": "_\n\nMarriages in the entertainment world often come to an end, but when a couple who seemingly beat the odds calls it quits, it just hits differently. Wonderwall.com is rounding up the shocking Hollywood splits that happened after a couple was together for a decade or longer, starting with this divorce… Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver wed in 1986 and became a Hollywood power couple. They welcomed four children together but shocked the world when they announced their split in May 2011. The same month they shared that they were separating, news broke that Arnold had fathered a child with one of their household staffers, illuminating the real reason for the demise of their 25-year marriage.\n\nKeep reading for more couples who threw in the towel after lengthy marriages…\n\nRELATED: The shortest celebrity marriages\n\n_\n\nClint Eastwood's first marriage, to Maggie Johnson, was incredibly lengthy by Hollywood standards. The couple wed in 1953, welcomed two children and remained married for 31 years before finally splitting. But in retrospect, it's clear why the partnership dissolved: Clint fathered two children outside of the marriage during their time together.\n\nRELATED: Biggest celebrity breakups of 2022\n\n_\n\nClint Eastwood's second marriage was lengthy as well — and it too came to an end after 17 years in 2013. In 1996, he wed news anchor Dina Ruiz; they welcomed his youngest child, daughter Morgan, that same year. The couple surprisingly had a reality show on E!, \"Mrs. Eastwood & Company,\" that debuted in 2012 and followed Dina's life — and their marriage actually ended when the series was airing. The couple actually quietly split in 2012, with Clint allegedly getting angry about the reality show and the airing of his normally private life. He was reportedly then contacted by Erica Fisher, the ex-wife of one of Dina's high school pals, Scott Fisher. Erica was concerned that Dina and Scott had struck up a recent close friendship, and unfortunately, once the cameras stopped rolling, the real drama began: Clint reportedly started dating Erica as his marriage to Dina came to and end. Dina went on to marry Scott in 2016.\n\nRELATED: Celebrity couples with big age gaps\n\n_\n\nThe reality TV curse strikes again? Hulk Hogan married Linda Claridge in 1983. The couple welcomed daughter Brooke and son Nick during their marriage and went on to star on a VH1 reality show, \"Hogan Knows Best,\" beginning in 2005. The show ran for two years and the same year it ended, their 24-year union did as well. Linda filed for divorce in 2007 and later revealed she suspected Hulk had been having an affair at the time of their split.\n\n_\n\nLate Hollywood legend Jerry Lewis had a 35-year run with his first wife, singer Patti Palmer. The couple shared six children — all boys, five biological and one they adopted together. Despite their seemingly happy union, once they broke up in 1980, the truth about their marriage started to come out. In 2011, Jerry himself opened up about his affairs with Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich, shedding light on why Patti was the one who filed for divorce.\n\n_\n\nTwo members of the band Sonic Youth had a very lengthy marriage in the world of rock 'n' roll. Vocalist-guitarist Thurston Moore and vocalist-bassist Kim Gordon married in 1984. Ten years later, they welcomed daughter Coco. They were wed for 27 years — until Thurston had an affair with an art book editor 20 years his junior that torpedoed his marriage in 2011. Their divorce was finalized in 2013. Kim later told ELLE, \"We seemed to have a normal relationship inside of a crazy world. And in fact, it ended in a kind of normal way — midlife crisis, starstruck woman.\"\n\n_\n\nKris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner married in 1991 and seemed to have a solid union when their reality show, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" debuted in 2007. Viewers watched their happy family — they shared daughters Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner and Caitlyn served as a stepfather to Kris's four children from a previous marriage — on E! for six years before they announced their surprising split in 2013. Their divorce was finalized in 2015, and shortly after that, Caitlyn publicly came out as a trans woman.\n\n_\n\nGwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale were a match made in rock 'n' roll heaven. The musically and genetically gifted duo were together for almost 20 years before ending their relationship. After nearly 13 years of marriage and three sons together, the couple found themselves in the midst of a nanny cheating scandal in 2015 and went their separate ways.\n\n_\n\nHarrison Ford's second marriage, to screenwriter Melissa Mathison, spanned 17 years. Two of his four children came from this union, which began in 1983. They split in 2000, though their divorce wasn't finalized until 2004. Melissa walked away with one of the biggest divorce settlements in Hollywood history at the time — a reported $85 million, according to Forbes. She passed away from cancer in 2015.\n\n_\n\nChris Rock and Malaak Compton-Rock, who said \"I do\" in 1996 and welcomed two children, were married for 20 years when they pulled the plug in 2014. Chris later admitted he'd cheated with three women during two decades of matrimony.\n\n_\n\nThough they never wed, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins had a very lengthy relationship that kicked off in the late '80s. The duo moved in together in 1988 after meeting on the set of \"Bull Durham\" and went on to welcome two children — sons John and Miles (she also had daughter Eva with Italian filmmaker Franco Amurri prior to dating Tim). They went their separate ways in 2009 after 21 years together, shocking Hollywood.\n\n_\n\nA split that rocked the reality world is up next! Nine years after the debut of their hit TLC show, \"Little People, Big World,\" stars Matt Roloff and Amy Roloff announced their shocking split. The couple had met at a Little People of America convention in 1987 and wed that same year, then went on to have four children together. They announced their divorce in 2015, then finalized things the following year — with cameras continuing to roll afterward.\n\n_\n\nAnthony Hopkins' second marriage reportedly came after an affair he had during his first. He wed Jennifer Lynton in 1973, a year after his split from his first wife. He and Jennifer were wed for 29 long years. They never had children. The duo reportedly drifted apart after moving between the U.K. and Hollywood, with Jennifer ultimately opting to stay in England.\n\n_\n\nThe news that Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet's marriage was over rocked Hollywood in January 2022. The couple had been together for 16 years — ever since Jason met the actress at a jazz club — and married for four when they revealed they were ending their romance, during which they'd welcomed two kids together.\n\n_\n\nThe country music world was stunned when legend Reba McEntire and manager Narvel Blackstock divorced in 2015 after 26 years of marriage. They'd wed in 1989 and a year later welcomed their only child together, race car driver Shelby Blackstock. Reba later revealed the split was not her choice.\n\n_\n\nRobert Redford's first marriage, to Lola Van Wagenen, lasted nearly three decades. They wed in 1958 and welcomed four children together before ultimately divorcing in 1985. The couple notoriously kept their relationship very private and never opened up about the reason for their split.\n\n_\n\nBravo fans watched the sweet relationship between Erika Jayne and Tom Girardi for years on \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.\" This meant that the news that they were ending things in November 2020 after 21 years of marriage — they tied the knot in 1999 after meeting at a restaurant where Erika worked as a waitress — came as a shock to many. The reason for their split became a little more clear a month later when it was revealed that Tom and his legal firm were in serious financial trouble.\n\n_\n\nCaptain & Tennille were not only a successful musical group — they were also a power couple in the music world for 39 years. Daryl Dragon and Toni Tennille wed in 1974 and a year later, their song \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and later won a Grammy for record of the year. Their surprising split came in 2014 due to intimacy issues, Toni told the \"Today\" show. \"Sex is not love, sex is not intimacy,\" she said. \"He just couldn't be affectionate, he couldn't just give me a hug. … And I don't blame him because he came from a very, very difficult family and he had a famous but overbearing father,\" she continued, referring to conductor-composer Carmen Dragon, adding, \"He was raised quite differently than I was. None of this is his fault.\"\n\n_\n\nIn Hollywood, reaching nearly two decades of marriage seems like an impossible feat. Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas almost did it but fell a couple years short when they announced their surprising split in 2014, 18 years after they wed.\n\n_\n\nMorgan Freeman's second marriage lasted nearly three decades but came to a surprising end in 2007. He was wed to Myrna Colley-Lee from 1984 — shortly after the end of his first marriage — until their divorce was finalized in 2010.\n\n_\n\nSome couples just seem destined to be together — like Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan. Their fairy tale romance started on the set of \"Step Up\" in 2006 and led to a 12 year relationship that came to a startling end in 2018 when the couple called it quits after nine years of marriage and one child together, daughter Everly."
