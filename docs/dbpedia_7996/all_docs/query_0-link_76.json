        "text": "The hills are alive with words of enlightenment, according to Maria Shriver.\n\nThe journalist reflected on her high-profile divorce from ex Arnold Schwarzenegger during the Feb. 6 episode of the Making Space with Hoda Kotb podcast, sharing that she visited a cloistered convent soon after the split \"to be in silence and look for advice.\"\n\nDescribing the experience as \"a scene out of The Sound of Music,\" Shriver recalled how the convent's Reverend Mother helped open her eyes and find a new outlook on life.\n\n\"The Reverend Mother there said to me at the very end, she said—and I actually have written about this, but I haven't shared—she said, 'I think you came here looking for permission,'\" Shriver shared, before referencing Julie Andrews' role in the iconic film. \"She says, 'You can't come live here, but you do have permission to go out and become Maria.' I was like, sobbing.\"\n\nThe 67-year-old went on to explain how she realized her full potential after that profound conversation. \"I had never given myself permission to feel, to be vulnerable, to be weak, to be brought to my knees, and the world did it to me,\" Shriver told host Hoda Kotb. \"And then I was like, 'Okay, God, let's go. I'm gonna take this and learn everything I can about my role and what I need to learn.'\"\n\nThe former couple, who finalized their divorce in 2021, have maintained a cordial relationship since their breakup. Most recently, they reunited to celebrate their son Patrick's birthday in September.\n\nLooking back, Shriver—who is cousin to Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of late President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis—said she often felt \"invisible\" living in the shadow of someone else.\n\n\"I would find myself getting angry at people who came up and didn't acknowledge that I existed when I was standing next to Arnold, or when I was standing next to my uncle or somebody,\" she shared on the podcast. \"And then I [realized] they were teaching me a lesson that it's not about whether they see me. Do I see me? Am I visible to me?\"\n\nAs she explained, \"It's not about other people seeing you, it's about you seeing yourself. And that took me a really long time, a really long time to learn.\""
