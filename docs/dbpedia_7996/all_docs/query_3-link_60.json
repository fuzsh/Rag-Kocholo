        "text": "IT would be hard to find anyone on the planet who doesn't know who Arnold Schwarzenegger is.\n\nWhen the Hollywood actor-turned-politician isn't busy taking over the world, he enjoys his home life with his girlfriend, Heather Milligan.\n\nWho is Arnold Schwarzenegger's girlfriend, Heather Milligan?\n\nBorn on November 9, 1974, Heather Milligan is a physical therapist by profession.\n\nShe is best known for being Arnold Schwarzenegger's girlfriend.\n\nHeather received her MBA at the University of Nevada and trained as a competitive gymnast for 20 years.\n\nNow, she has a practice called Elite Ortho Sport, where she treats professional athletes for their sports injuries.\n\nShe has even participated in Arnold's famous strength competition, the Arnold Strongman Classic, by treating some of the participants.\n\nIn a 2024 interview on Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast, New Heights, Arnold got candid about Heather and how he's learned about football because of her.\n\n\"I learned the game. I learned the rules, and then later on, around 10 years ago, I fell in love with Heather, with my girlfriend, who is a physical therapist who treats a lot of the football players and boxers and UFC fighters and basketball players,\" he said on the podcast.\n\n\"And she’s really a fanatic about sports, especially about football.\n\n\"So now I’m sitting with her, and she’s explaining if I have any questions. It never stops. This is really what has happened in the last few years.\"\n\nHow long have Arnold and Heather been dating?\n\nThe couple has been together since 2013, when they were spotted kissing in Santa Monica.\n\nFor some, a 28-year age gap could be a problem, but not for these two.\n\nOver a decade after they were first seen together, they are as loved up as ever.\n\nDuring their time together, the two have traveled the world and are often seen getting fresh air around their neighborhood.\n\nArnold revealed the two have a lot of qualities in common in an interview with People.\n\n\"We have so many things in common,\" he told the outlet. \"I think the world of her.\"\n\nDoes the couple have any children together?\n\nArnold and Heather do not share any children. However, Arnold has five kids of his own.\n\nHe has four with his ex-wife, Maria Shriver.\n\nHis eldest, Katherine, was born in 1989, followed by Christina in 1991. Their son Patrick was born in 1993, followed by Christopher in 1997.\n\nHe is also the father to Joseph Baena, who was born on October 2, 1997, after Arnie had an affair with his housekeeper.\n\nJoseph was born just five days after his son Christopher.\n\nWhen did Arnold and Maria divorce?\n\nBefore Arnie met Heather, he was married to Maria Shriver.\n\nHe met the television journalist, who is the niece of former President John F. Kennedy, at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977.\n\nThey got married in 1986 but unofficially ended their marriage of 25 years in May 2011.\n\nAfter over a decade, since Maria filed her request for a divorce in 2011, she and Arnold officially divorced on December 29, 2021.\n\nIn his interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Arnold called the divorce \"very, very difficult in the beginning.\"\n\nHe said he still loved Maria and that the two were \"good friends and very close.\"\n\n\"If there’s Oscars for how to handle divorce, Maria and I should get it for having the least amount of impact on the kids,\" he said."
