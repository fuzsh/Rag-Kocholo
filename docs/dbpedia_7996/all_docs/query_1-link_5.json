Arnold admitted to fathering a child outside of his marriage.\n\nArnold's youngest — Joseph Baena — was born to his mistress in October 1997, only a month after Arnold and Maria welcomed their son Christopher. However, it would be years before Arnold confessed to his past transgressions.\n\nIn January 2011, following his term as California governor, Arnold finally shared the news with his wife and kids. They announced their separation four months later in May, which was the same month Arnold came clean to the public about his affair as well.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,” he told the Los Angeles Times of his affair. “I understand and deserve the feelings of anger and disappointment among my friends and family.\n\n“There are no excuses and I take full responsibility for the hurt I have caused. I have apologized to Maria, my children, and my family. I am truly sorry,” he added.\n\nIt took years, but by December 2021, their divorce was finalized.\n\nSo, where does Arnold Schwarzenegger’s relationship with Maria Shriver stand now?\n\nWhile the romantic chapter of their story may have come to an end, Arnold and Maria have maintained their relationship as co-parents to their four kids and two grandchildren. In fact, the family still celebrates special occasions together.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he shared that although their divorce was devastating, he and his ex-wife still have a lot of love for one another.\n\n“If there's Oscars for how to handle divorce, Maria and I should get it for having the least amount of impact on the kids,” he said of their split. “The sweetness and kindness you see in them, that's from my wife. The discipline and work ethic is from me.\""
