        "text": "Seven times Mr. Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger has had a full and colorful romantic life. Even before dating and marrying Maria Shriver, Schwarzenegger had relations with many other high-profile individuals. That said, the revelations about his affair were without a doubt, a dark phase in Schwarzenegger’s life. However, he ensured that he worked towards rebuilding the relationships with his children.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s love life has been a rollercoaster with a lot of ups and downs. With that being said, let’s take a look at all the people that the bodybuilding legend has dated to this point.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s first known relationship\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has already made a name for himself in the bodybuilding sphere during his early 20s. He was madly in love with the sport and aspired to move to the United States and become a bodybuilding legend. A short while after, Arnold moved to the U.S. in 1968. This was when he met a college student, Barbara Outland, and the couple had the time of their lives, living together, barbecuing, etc.\n\nHowever, the two broke up later because of the lifestyle differences that they had. Barbara Outland Baker told The Telegraph, “I was in his shadow… I just wanted to get married and have children. But he was someone with so much focus, nothing could get in his way.”\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s open relationship\n\nAfter breaking up with Barbara in 1975, Schwarzenegger started dating 25-year-old Hollywood hairdresser Sue Moray in 1977. However, the couple were in an open relationship and dated for around four years. Regarding the nature of their relationship, Moray told The Sunday Times, “When he was in town, he would be committed to me and I would live with him and go to work from his house. But when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted and to date anyone else we wanted.”\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger meets Maria Shriver\n\nIn 1977, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver met for the first time at the Robert F. Kennedy Pro Celebrity Tennis tournament. The duo met each other for the first time at the event and started dating shortly after that. During this time, Schwarzenegger was dating Moray as well. Eventually, she got skeptical about Schwarzenegger and Shriver. “All he ever said about Maria was that she was ‘just a friend,’ but I didn’t believe him,” Moray told the Standard.\n\nWATCH THIS STORY | “Gripping Pain on My Ribs”: weeks After Heart Surgery, 55 Yo Elite Bodybuilder Unveils Terrifying Hospital Experience\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s affair with Brigitte Nielsen\n\nBy the 80s, Schwarzenegger became a household name, thanks to his roles in Hollywood. Even though he was still in a relationship with Maria Shriver, ‘The Austrian Oak’ had an affair with his co-star in the movie ‘Red Sonja.’ Arnold claims that Brigitte Nielsen wanted to marry him, but he rejected her offer. This is one of the only two affairs that Arnold has himself confirmed.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger marries Maria Shriver\n\nGiven his past record, Maria Shriver was a bit skeptical when Arnold proposed to her. She rejected Arnold’s marriage proposal two times before finally saying yes. Back in August 1985, when the couple visited Thal, Austria, Shriver finally accepted the marriage proposal. However, she was still a bit in doubt and said, “Hey, Arnold, what’s so special about today? Have I been especially good lately? Have I gotten really beautiful?” per The Times.\n\n‘Arnie’s rumored affairs with Gigi Goyette and Rachel Ticotin\n\nEven though Arnold has never admitted to seeing Gigi Goyette, she has openly talked about her relationship with ‘The Austrian Oak’ on multiple occasions. According to her, the duo first met when she was just 16 years old. However, they started dating each other years later, when she was in her 20s.\n\nAnother rumored affair of Schwarzenegger was with ‘Total Recall’ star Rachel Ticotin. Although their relationship was a brief one, the bodybuilding sensation was still seeing Maria Shriver.\n\nMaria Shriver comes to Arnold’s rescue\n\nDespite all the hardships and challenges that Arnold went through, one constant in his life has always been Maria Shriver. Amidst the rumors circulating about his affair with Rachel Ticotin and Gigi Goyette, Shriver was always there to take his side. During one of his political campaign speeches, Shriver took the mic and said in a speech, “I wouldn’t be standing here if this man weren’t an A-plus human being. I wouldn’t be taking my time, I wouldn’t have left my job that I love, I wouldn’t be doing any of this if I didn’t believe in this man.”\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger and his affair with housekeeper\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger also had an affair with the family housekeeper Mildred Baena. Back in 1997, she gave birth to a lovely baby boy whom she named Joseph. Years later, she noticed how Joseph looked just like Arnold. Schwarzenegger revealed the truth about his affair to his family back in 2011, after which Shriver decided to leave Arnold. The couple, however, finally got divorced much later, in 2021.\n\n‘The Governator’s current relationship status\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAfter separating from Maria in 2011, Arnold started dating again two years afterward when he met physical therapist Heather Milligan, who is 27 years younger than Arnold. Despite dating for more than a decade now, the couple has no plans of getting married as of now. Only time will tell if Arnold is ready to tie knots again.\n\nRead More: “She Didn’t Have Much Faith in Me”: Ex-Wife Maria Shriver Feared Arnold Schwarzenegger Would Struggle in One Specific Area as Governor of California\n\nDespite dating Heather, Schwarzenegger continues to maintain a good relationship with Maria Shriver.
