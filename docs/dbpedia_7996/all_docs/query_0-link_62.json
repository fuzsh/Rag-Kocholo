        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger and ex-wife Maria Shriver famously parted ways in 2011 after his affair with housekeeper Mildred Baena.\n\nThe “Terminator” star, 76, will be on an upcoming episode of friend Rob Lowe’s podcast “Literally!” — and in a new clip obtained by Entertainment Tonight — the former politician joked that Lowe, 59, took Shriver’s side in the divorce.\n\n“Let the story be told that since I got divorced from Maria, you haven’t been around much,” Schwarzenegger guffawed.\n\n“I think she got custody,” the “West Wing” alum replied.\n\nThe ex-bodybuilder went on: “You wanted to prove to her that you’re loyal to her and not to me.”\n\n“So, because even though we didn’t have any of those things, we always had friends that were loyal to me and to her, and they didn’t get involved in all of this stuff,” Schwarzenegger said.\n\n“But I mean, you did,” he teased. “It was, like, unbelievable how all of a sudden I said to Maria, ‘Why is Rob not showing up?'”\n\nThe “Kindergarten Cop” star then confessed that he and Lowe don’t hang out as much as they used to and he misses the “Parks & Recreation” actor.\n\n“We had a lot of fun. And you came over to the house all the time. I kind of missed all that stuff,” Schwarzenegger said.\n\nHe added: “But you know, maybe eventually you’re gonna wake up and say, you know, ‘I can hang out with Arnold again and Maria’s not gonna decapitate me.'”\n\nSchwarzenegger and the broadcast journalist, 67, married in 1986. They remained cordial after their split and share children Katherine, 33, Christina, 32, Patrick, 30, and Christopher, 26.\n\nThe Austrian-American entertainer had fathered son Joseph Baena with the housekeeper in 1997.\n\nSchwarzenegger opened up about the extramarital affair with People in an interview published earlier this month, saying it was his “f–k-up.”\n\n“My chapter with Maria will continue on forever,” he divulged at the time. “Even though it’s a different relationship, there’s no reason for me to feel anything other than love for her.”\n\nHe added: “We always made it very clear that the kids should not suffer because of [my affair]. And [Shriver] has her things, her relationship, I have mine [with Heather Milligan], but we always communicate about the kids, about the holidays, about birthday parties and Mother’s Day parties and Christmas.”"
