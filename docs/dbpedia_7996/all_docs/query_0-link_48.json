        "text": "Maria Shriver was spotted for the first time since her ex-husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, shared intimate details of his affair in his newly released documentary.\n\nThe former First Lady of California made her way through a very busy LAX on Thursday with a stoic expression on her face while accompanied by her youngest daughter, Christina, 31.\n\nShriver looked casual for the outing, wearing a pair of black pants, a shirt, a jacket and sneakers.\n\nIt’s the first public appearance the mom of four, 67, has made since the “Terminator” star, 75, disclosed personal details of his affair with their former housekeeper Mildred Baena, with whom he shares son Joseph Beana, now 25.\n\nIn the Netflix doc “Arnold,” which was released on June 7, Schwarzenegger shared how he broke the news of the affair to his and Shriver’s four children: Katherine, 33, Christina, 31, Patrick, 29, and Christopher, also 25.\n\n“I had to go to my kids and explain it to them,” he said. “The reason I feel reluctant talking about it is because every time I do, it opens up the wounds again. I think that I have caused enough pain for my family because of my f–k up.”\n\nThe former Governor of California admitted that Shriver, their children, his youngest son, Joseph, and Mildred all suffered from his actions.\n\n“I am going to have to live with it the rest of my life,” he added. “People will remember my successes and they will also remember my failures. This is a major failure.\n\n“I had failures in the past in my career, but this is a whole different ball game, dimension of failure.”\n\nShriver filed for divorce from the “Commando” actor in July 2011 after he admitted to fathering Joseph. However, their divorce was not finalized until December 2021.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nIn February, the journalist shared that she was left “sobbing” after she sought advice from a convent’s reverend mother following their split.\n\nAlthough their marriage ended more than a decade ago, Schwarzenegger said that he and his ex-wife have an amicable relationship and have done a great job raising their kids.\n\n“She and I are really good friends and very close, and we are very proud of the way we raised our kids,” he told the Hollywood Reporter last month. “Even though we had this drama, we did Easter together, Mother’s Day together, the Christmases together, all birthdays — everything together.”\n\nThe former bodybuilder continued, “If there’s Oscars for how to handle divorce, Maria and I should get it for having the least amount of impact on the kids.\n\n“The sweetness and kindness you see in them, that’s from my wife. The discipline and work ethic is from me.”\n\n“Arnold” is now streaming on Netflix."
