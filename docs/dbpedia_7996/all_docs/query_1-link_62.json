She wants to know if you are the father of Joseph (Baena).’ And I was like — I thought my heart stopped, and then I told the truth.”\n\nSchwarzenegger and Shriver were married in 1986 and share four children together, but he had an affair with their housekeeper in the ’90s. The revelation that he had fathered a son — Joseph — after indulging in an affair with his former housekeeper Mildred Baena came to light in 2011 when he was still governor of California.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“There are no excuses and I take full responsibility for the hurt I have caused. I have apologized to Maria, my children and my family. I am truly sorry.”\n\n“‘Yes, Maria, Joseph is my son,'” he recalls telling her in the upcoming Netflix doc. “She was crushed because of that. I had an affair in ’96. In the beginning I really didn’t know. I just started feeling the older he got the more it became clear to me and then it was really just a matter of how do you keep this quiet? How do you keep this a secret?”\n\nSchwarzenegger says he was “reluctant” to talk about his past indiscretion because it just opened up old wounds. His marriage to Shriver crumbled in the wake of the revelation and they officially divorced in 2021 — 10 years after they split.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I think that I have caused enough pain for my family because of my f*** up. Everyone had to suffer. Maria had to suffer. The kids had to suffer. Joseph. His mother. Everyone,” he says.\n\n“I am going to have to live with it the rest of my life,” Schwarzenegger says in a candid scene from the series. “People will remember my successes and they will also remember my failures. This is a major failure. I had failures in the past in my career, but this is a whole different ball game, dimension of failure.”\n\nSchwarzenegger goes on to call Joseph a “fantastic man” who “makes me proud.”\n\n“It was wrong what I did. But I don’t want to make Joseph feel that he is not welcomed in this world — because he is very much welcomed in this world,” he said. “I love him and he has turned out to be an extraordinary young man.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBaena has largely kept out of the public eye, but she did recount the moment she revealed the affair to Shriver in an interview with Hello! in 2011.\n\n“Last summer, I brought Joseph over to the house. Until then, he hadn’t been around very much,” she said. “After that, people in the house started whispering about how much they looked like each other.”\n\nBaena said that eventually Maria asked her if Arnold was Joseph’s dad: “Maria would ask if I needed to talk to her, and I kept saying no. Finally, she asked point blank. Maria asked me directly if Joseph was Arnold’s son, and I just broke down. I dropped to my knees and I was crying, saying that yes he was and I was so sorry.”\n\nIn a recent profile with The Hollywood Reporter, Schwarzenegger owned his lapse in judgment, but said he and Maria are in a good place now.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“It was my f*** up. It was my failure,” he said. “(The divorce) was very, very difficult in the beginning. Eventually, you move on. I have a wonderful girlfriend, (physical therapist) Heather Milligan, who is very successful. I’m really proud of her, and I love her. At the same time, I love my wife. She and I are really good friends and very close, and we are very proud of the way we raised our kids.\n\n“Even though we had this drama, we did Easter together, Mother’s Day together, the Christmases together, all birthdays — everything together. If there’s Oscars for how to handle divorce, Maria and I should get it for having the least amount of impact on the kids. The sweetness and kindness you see in them, that’s from my wife. The discipline and work ethic is from me.”\n\nArnold hits Netflix this Wednesday.\n\nmdaniell@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger guns for laughs and thrills in Netflix's 'True Lies'-inspired 'FUBAR'\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger spotted biking around Toronto with pal Tom Arnold\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
