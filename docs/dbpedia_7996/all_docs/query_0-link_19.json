        "text": "JFK’s brother, US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, made a move for the White House in 1968. However, he was shot and later died in Los Angeles following a win in the California primary during his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nHowever, many Kennedy family members are still thriving today – with Maria Shriver being one of them. So what do we know about the 68-year-old?\n\nMaria Shriver carved a career in journalism\n\nDuring the early days of her career, the award-winning journalist, broadcaster and author carved a career path for herself that was different from her famous family members.\n\nImmersed in the political scene from a young age, Shriver credits her decision to go into journalism to when she was told to join the press corp in the back of the plane during her father’s vice-president bid for the democratic party in 1972, she wrote in her book, Ten Things I Wish I’d Known Before I Went Out into the Real World.\n\nBecoming the first lady of California\n\nShriver met and later married action superstar Schwarzenegger in 1986 following close to a decade of courtship. Her life as a journalist, wife and mother pivoted when Schwarzenegger found his political calling and entered into the running to become the governor of California.\n\nJoining her then-husband on the campaign trail in 2003, she stepped back from her role at NBC News due to a conflict of interest. She ultimately left her role in 2004 following her husband’s win. Still, she would occasionally appear on NBC as a special reporter.\n\nThe couple ultimately divorced in 2021 after a 10-year separation.\n\nShe’s an advocate for women\n\nShriver followed in her mother’s footsteps when it came to giving back to the community. Eunice founded the Special Olympics in 1968, an organisation that gave a platform to athletes with special needs to compete and engage in sports.\n\nDuring her time as first lady of California, Shriver advocated for women’s rights, leading The Women’s Conference. Under her leadership, the group became the largest meeting of women in the country, according to an LA Times article from 2007. The conference featured meetings and seminars that advocated for everything from work-life balance for mothers, to maintaining mental wellness among women.\n\nShe was also the driving force behind the country’s first Alzheimer’s organisation for women, the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement.\n\nAnother Kennedy aims for the White House\n\nSpending her entire life in the limelight and no stranger to media attention, Shriver is once again making headlines as her family’s legacy becomes a talking point. Her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr is running as an independent candidate in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nShriver had not always seen eye to eye with her cousin’s politics though. Most notably, RFK Jr gained a loyal fan base during the Covid-19 pandemic for his anti-vaccination stance and adamant objection to shutdowns.\n\nThe ad used images of Shriver’s uncle and mother, to which Bobby responded, “Respect for science, vaccines and healthcare equity was in her DNA. She [Eunice Kennedy Shriver] strongly supported my healthcare work at @ONECampaign and @RED, which he [RFK Jr] opposes.”"
