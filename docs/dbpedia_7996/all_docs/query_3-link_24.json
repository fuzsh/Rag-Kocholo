        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has seen a lot of ups and downs and different incidents in his life. He has traveled from Austria to America, dabbled in several different industries, and met thousands of people. The Austrian Oak has been a seven-time Mr. Olympia winner, along with being a huge movie star and the governor of California. Not only was his career extremely colorful, but his love life was even more vibrant.\n\nThe 76-year-old has fallen in love, and even married, and has fallen out of love as well. Arnie has five children, and now he is even a grandfather. However, is he still married? If not, then why did his marriage break? Is he dating someone? Let’s find out.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s first known relationship\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe Austrian Oak had already started becoming famous in the bodybuilding world during his early 20s. His first love was bodybuilding, and he wanted to be a winner and moved to the United States to become a bodybuilding legend. After he moved to the US in 1968, he met a college student, Barbara Outland, and the two youngsters enjoyed the life of living together, having fun, and falling in love with each other.\n\nHowever, shortly after that, they broke up because of different goals and dreams. According to the Telegraph, Barbara Outland had a dream of having a family and getting married. However, Arnie was chasing his dreams and nothing was getting in the way of that.\n\nRead More: 61-Year-Old Grandma Continues Inspiring Bodybuilding Journey as She Hits NPC Stage in Latest Contest\n\nAfter this break up in 1975, the bodybuilding star started dating 25-year-old Hollywood hairdresser Sue Morey in 1977. This relationship went around for four years and both agreed to have an open relationship. Finally, after having two partners, Arnie met someone who was going to change his life forever.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger meets the Kennedy princess\n\nIn 1977, when Schwarzenegger was already starting to become a blockbuster Hollywood actor, he met Maria Shriver for the first time at the Robert F Kennedy Pro celebrity tennis tournament. The bodybuilding icon went with Maria Shriver that very evening after the tournament to Hyannis Port after she had invited him. They started dating shortly after that. The Terminator star and the journalist from a major political family were in a relationship for nine years.\n\nThey tied the knot in 1986 and welcomed four children together. During the marriage, Arnie also fulfilled his goal of becoming the former governor of California. He has always thanked his wife and partner of 25 years for her support throughout all hardships. Whatever problems he had, she was always there to guide him through them.\n\nThe Governator had confessed his love for his wife on several occasions. On one such occasion, he had said,“ I fell in love with Maria. Not because she was a Kennedy, but because she had an extraordinary personality.” He had said that he could see that she was a rebel, which resonated with his character. However, things were not always rosy in their marriage. However, allegations of affairs in a celebrities’s life is always a hindrance.\n\nArnie had never admitted to having an affair with Gigi Goyette but she had openly talked about the relationship with him on multiple occasions. Another affair that was rumored was with Rachel Ticoin even though the relationship was short-lived.\n\nDespite all these hardships, Maria Shriver had come to his rescue. During one of his political campaign speeches, Shriver even took the mic and gave a speech,“I wouldn’t be standing here. If this man weren’t an A+. I wouldn’t be taking my time. I wouldn’t have left the job that I love. I wouldn’t be doing any of this if I didn’t believe in this man.”\n\nHowever, even this support might have not been enough because something happened in their life that made Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger get a divorce in 2011.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s affair with his housekeeper\n\nThe reason that their marriage fell apart was because Schwarzenegger had an affair with the family housekeeper, Mildred Baena. The affair was so serious that they even had a son together named Joseph Baena. She gave birth to him in 1997, and years later, she started to notice how Joseph looked exactly like Arnold. After 10 years of hiding the truth, he knew that it wouldn’t be feasible, and therefore he confessed about his affair to the family in 2011.\n\nArnold even looked after his son, and provided for him, even in this difficult time. After learning about the affair, Shriver decided to separate from Arnold and the couple finally got divorced, but only in 2021 was the decision made legally.\n\nEven after the split, he keeps contact with his family and all five children and even supports them. Similarly, his children also support him and his wife is supportive of him as well. The 76-year-old only speaks good things about his wife to this date. However, after his divorce from Shriver, Arnie went on to be in another relationship for over 10 years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n‎Arnold Schwarzenegger’s current relationship\n\nAfter separating from Maria Shriver, in 2011, he found love again two years later with his physical therapist Heather Milligan, who was 27 years younger than him. They are still going strong and have been dating for more than a decade. However, they haven’t made public any plans for getting married.\n\nMilligan has a degree in Physical Therapy and her own company named OrthoSport. She has more than 20 years of experience in the field. Arnie met her in 2013 when he had to treat his shoulder injury. That was the start of their decade long relationship.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch This Story: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s late friend and training partner disclosed the unknown truth about bodybuilding in a resurfaced video\n\nDespite all these ups and downs, Arnie shared a very good relationship with Maria and his children. He loves the resilience and determination of his girlfriend, Heather, who he respects a lot. What do you think about this colorful relationship story of Arnold Schwarzenegger?"
