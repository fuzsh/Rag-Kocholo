        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver were married for almost 35 years. Having said that, they spent the last 10 years of that time separated, after it was revealed that Arnold fathered a child outside of wedlock early in the marriage. While such a fact is certainly going to cause a rift in any relationship (and it did ultimately lead to divorce) the Terminator star says that he and his ex-wife are still in the first chapter of their relationship.\n\nIn Schwarzenegger’s new book, Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life (via People) Arnold says that while Shriver made the decision to split, there was no fight between them. Namely because Arnold apparently accepted all fault in the situation, and the two agreed to separate in a way that didn’t hurt their family. He explained…\n\nSchwarzenegger and Shriver are certainly no longer together, but they also are going to be together forever, because they have a family, that has only continued to grow, and now includes Chris Pratt and his children, and they must all be attended to. As such, the actor says that he and Shriver are in constant communication regarding their family. And so while the relationship has changed, it will never end. He continued…\n\nKatherine Schwarzenegger, the wife of Chris Pratt, has spoken about how she actually hopes she has a relationship with her famous husband that is similar to what her parents had, despite the issues. She says that both her parents gave her advice about dealing with celebrity so they were clearly on the same page there."
