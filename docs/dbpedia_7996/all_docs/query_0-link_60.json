        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has opened up on the devastating moment that he told his ex-wife, Maria Shriver, of his affair.\n\nThe Terminator actor, 75, married the journalist, 67, in 1986, and they welcomed four children together – Katherine, Christina, Patrick and Christopher.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t to last and the author filed for divorce in 2011, following 25 years of marriage, after she learned that the bodybuilder had secretly fathered another son, Joseph Baena, with their housekeeper, Mildred Baena, years before.\n\nIn his new series on Netflix, simply titled Arnold, the former politician reflected on the moment that he informed his former partner of his betrayal.\n\n‘Maria and I went to counseling once a week,’ he said, via People. ‘And in one of the sessions the counselor said, “I think today Maria wants to be very specific about something. She wants to know if you are the father of Joseph.” And I was like – I thought my heart stopped, and then I told the truth.’\n\n‘“Yes, Maria, Joseph is my son,”’ he recalled telling her. ‘She was crushed because of that. I had an affair in ‘96. In the beginning I really didn’t know. I just started feeling the older he got the more it became clear to me and then it was really just a matter of how do you keep this quiet? How do you keep this a secret?\n\n‘I think that I have caused enough pain for my family because of my f**k up. Everyone had to suffer. Maria had to suffer. The kids had to suffer. Joseph. His mother. Everyone.’\n\nArnold confessed that he was ‘reluctant’ to discuss the affair so openly in his Netflix special – which is released on June 7 – because it ‘opens up the wounds again’.\n\nBut he insisted that he doesn’t want to make Joseph, now 25, feel like he is ‘not welcomed in this world’.\n\nThe outlet reports that he added: ‘I love him and he has turned out to be an extraordinary young man.’\n\nMaria announced her split from Arnold in May, 2011, after more than two decades of marriage – but their divorce wasn’t finalized until 2021.\n\nDays later, the Twins actor publicly apologized for the affair during a candid chat with the Los Angeles Times.\n\n‘After leaving the governor’s office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,’ he said at the time. ‘I understand and deserve the feelings of anger and disappointment among my friends and family.\n\n‘There are no excuses and I take full responsibility for the hurt I have caused. I have apologized to Maria, my children and my family. I am truly sorry.’\n\nArnold is available to stream on Netflix on June 7.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Holly Willoughby forced to speak to Ruth Langsford hours after being branded ‘big mouth’ by Eamonn Holmes"
