        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger blames himself for his “difficult” 2011 split from ex-wife Maria Shriver.\n\nWhile comparing himself to his role in the new Netflix series “FUBAR,” the actor discussed whether his character Luke’s marriage failing due to infidelity was “deliberately autobiographical.”\n\n“We were laughing about it — it feels like it’s a documentary,” he told the Hollywood Reporter in a new interview published Tuesday.\n\n“The difference is, in the show, he doesn’t consider it cheating because [seducing CIA assets] was part of his profession. His wife moved on because he never was home, and now he has this dilemma with the daughter because she has the same job and it’s going to screw up her relationship, too.”\n\nSchwarzenegger added, “But in [my real-life marriage to Shriver], it was my f–k-up. It was my failure.”\n\nThough the “Terminator” star said his character is “deep down still in love with his wife,” he denied missing being married in real life and gushed about his romance with girlfriend Heather Mulligan.\n\n“[The divorce] was very, very difficult in the beginning,” the former bodybuilder explained. “Eventually, you move on. I have a wonderful girlfriend, [physical therapist] Heather Milligan, who is very successful. I’m really proud of her, and I love her.”\n\nWhile Shriver, 67, and Schwarzenegger, 75, ended their marriage 12 years ago, he said they have an amicable relationship and have done a great job raising their four kids: Katherine, 33, Christina, 31, Patrick, 29, and Christopher, 25.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“She and I are really good friends and very close, and we are very proud of the way we raised our kids. Even though we had this drama, we did Easter together, Mother’s Day together, the Christmases together, all birthdays — everything together.”\n\nHe continued, “If there’s Oscars for how to handle divorce, Maria and I should get it for having the least amount of impact on the kids. The sweetness and kindness you see in them, that’s from my wife. The discipline and work ethic is from me.”\n\nThe former first lady of California filed for divorce in July 2011 after the “Commando” actor admitted to fathering son Joseph Baena, 25, with their longtime housekeeper Mildred Patricia Baena. However, their divorce was not finalized until December 2021.\n\nIn February, Shriver reflected on the divorce, sharing that she was left “sobbing” after she sought advice from a convent’s reverend mother after their split.\n\n“[She said], ‘You can’t come live here … but you do have permission to go out and become Maria.’”\n\nThe journalist said she recalled giving herself “permission to start learning” as she left the covenant."
