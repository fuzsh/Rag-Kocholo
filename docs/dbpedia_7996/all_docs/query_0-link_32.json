However, the former First Lady of California has many achievements of her own. The 68-year-old is an Emmy Award-winning journalist, author, activist and entrepreneur. Today, her estimated net worth stands at $200 million.\n\nThe majority of her net worth comes from her lineage and divorce settlement with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Shriver is the only daughter of politician and former US ambassador to France, Sargent Shriver, and philanthropist Eunice Kennedy. The 68-year-old is also the niece of the late 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. Besides her lineage and marriage with Schwarzenegger, Shirver’s initiatives have also contributed to her net worth.\n\nMaria Shriver: A philanthropist in her own right\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nGrowing up in a family of people who served the nation, Shriver felt the pressure to live up to them. Maria Shriver believed she would have to live to the Kennedy name, so she became ambitious from a young age. As he neared adulthood, Shriver found her passion in journalism. So, she pursued a career in media after earning a B.A. in American studies from Georgetown University in 1977.\n\nShe started as a writer and producer at KYW in Philadelphia.

Maria Shriver co-hosted Today on NBC for three years and then reported for Deadline from 1998 to 2004.\n\nWhile her career in reporting may not have earned her millions, she earned recognition and awards. Maria Shriver won two Emmys and a Peabody Award, among many others. By the mid-2000s, she had also embarked as an activist for women’s rights and raising Alzheimer’s awareness. After losing her father to the disease, Shirver made it her life’s goal to fund research to eradicate the disease.\n\nSince starting her initiative, the 68-year-old has established The Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic. The journalist has slo started a company with her son, Patrick Schwarzenegger. Shriver and Patrick Schwarzenegger have raised millions in funding for their protein bar company, Mosh.\n\nHowever, Mosh isn’t your regular protein bar because it was made to support brain health. Maria Shriver has used her company as an aid to further Alzheimer’s awareness, as brain health is key to staving off the incurable disease. They also reinvest the profits to grow the company and help fund Alzheimer’s research. However, the 68-year-old net worth ballooned after her divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2021.\n\nThe end of a long chapter with Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver separated in 2011 after 25 years of marriage. Shortly after Arnold Schwarzenegger ended his second and final term as the Governor of California, rumors started circulating that the former governor had fathered a child with housekeeper Mildred Patricia Baena. Later, Schwarzenegger confessed the truth behind the rumors to Shirver.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs the events unfolded and the world got to know about the existence of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s fifth child, Shriver filed for divorce. Although she had filed for divorce in 2011, shortly after the extramarital affair came to light, it took the couple another 11 years to settle things. In 2011, Shriver’s lawyers told Hollywood Life that she may get half of Arnie’s then-estimates net worth.\n\n“Maria Shriver is certainly entitled to a generous amount in the settlement, one that is consistent with her lifestyle. If Arnold’s net worth is $300,000 million she should get half of that plus child support,” her lawyers told the news outlet. However, in the final settlement, the court came to a slightly different decision.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe jury ruled that Maria Shriver was entitled to half of Schwarzenegger’s earnings from 1986 to 2011. Despite the drawn-out divorce, the pair have moved past the incident that tore apart their family in 2011. Thankfully, both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver continued to fulfill their duty toward their children and are on talking terms."
