        "text": "The former first lady has moved out after 25 years of marriage. Maria Shriver helped bolster Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign against charges that he groped women during his movie career.\n\nBy Mark Z. Barabak Los Angeles Times Staff Writer May 9, 2011, 7:58 p.m.\n\n<!-- sphereit start -->Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, have separated, with Shriver moving out of their Brentwood mansion while the two determine the next step in their 25-year marriage.\n\nShriver has been residing apart from the actor-turned-politician for the last few weeks. The former first couple confirmed the separation in a joint statement released Monday after questions were raised by The Times.\n\n\"This has been a time of great personal and professional transition for each of us,\" the statement read. \"After a great deal of thought, reflection, discussion and prayer, we came to this decision together. At this time, we are living apart while we work on the future of our relationship.\n\n\"We are continuing to parent our four children together. They are the light and the center of both of our lives.\" We consider this a private matter and neither we nor any of our friends or family will have further comment. \"We ask for compassion and respect from the media and the public.\"\n\nOver the years, the couple's marriage has come under close scrutiny, especially during the 2003 recall of Gov. Gray Davis, when The Times reported on Schwarzenegger's lengthy history of groping women. At the time, Shriver defended her husband, helping lift him to victory in the free-for-all contest.\n\nSince Schwarzenegger left office, it had seemed as though the two were living separate lives. Shriver has worked on her women's empowerment website, guest edited an issue of Oprah Winfrey's magazine and promoted causes near to her heart, such as Alzheimer's research. She struggled with the death of her father, Sargent Shriver, in January, and took her son Patrick and some of his friends on an East Coast college tour in April.\n\nShriver, 55, spoke openly about the uncertainty she felt about moving on to the next phase of her life.\n\n\"It is so stressful to not know what you're doing next,\" Shriver said in a March 28 YouTube video to supporters. Though there was no intimation of a split, Shriver appeared without her wedding ring. \"I'd like to hear from other people in transition,\" Shriver said. \"How did you get through it? What were three things that enabled you to get through your transition?\"\n\nThe former governor, 63, told a Times reporter in April that he yearned for a show business comeback. It was later announced that Schwarzenegger had signed on to star in three films, including another installment in the \"Terminator\" series.\n\n\"The whole industry has not come up with a new line of action heroes so [people say] let's go see the mature ones -- that's what I call them, the mature ones -- because there's nothing new around,\" Schwarzenegger said in the interview. \"That's good news for me.\"\n\nThe couple met in 1977, when NBC's Tom Brokaw introduced Shriver to Schwarzenegger at a charity tennis tournament. The two married in 1986, and have four children.\n\nWith their marriage, the Republican Schwarzenegger entered one of the most storied Democratic dynasties in America; Shriver is the daughter of the late Eunice Kennedy Shriver.\n\nTheir odd-couple political match was a source of endless interest to outsiders, and good-natured ribbing on the part of the couple, who often found themselves on opposites sides of political campaigns. In 2008, Shriver delivered a high-profile endorsement of Barack Obama on the eve of the California primary. Schwarzenegger backed the GOP nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nSchwarzenegger was immensely popular in his first year in office, animated by dramatic Hollywood-style campaigning. But he left office last January sobered by years of budget difficulties and suffering from a fractious relationship with legislators from both parties.\n\nShriver emerged as perhaps the most prominent and powerful first lady in California history, promoting volunteerism and assuming control of cultural institutions like the state history museum in Sacramento.\n\nShe also presided over the state's annual California Governor's Conference on Women and Families, turning the event into an affair that drew tens of thousands of women, a raft of celebrity attendees and a crowd of corporate sponsors.\n\nPerhaps her most crucial role as political helpmate came in the waning days of the recall election, after The Times report on Schwarzenegger's behavior. At a rally in San Diego, the actor acknowledged before several hundred chanting supporters that, \"Yes, I have behaved badly sometimes.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is true that I was on rowdy movie sets,\" he went on, \"and I have done things that were not right, which I thought then was playful. But I now recognize that I have offended people. And to those people that I have offended, I want to say to them, I am deeply sorry about that, and I apologize.\"\n\nAppearing alongside her husband later that day at a news conference, Shriver blunted the political impact of the story by vouching for Schwarzenegger, saying the sexual misconduct allegations \"show why really good people don't want to go into politics anymore.\"\n\n\"I don't get into specifics,\" she told reporters. \"As I say to my children, it always takes great courage to do -- stand before anybody and apologize,\" she said. \"I think that's what Arnold did today. I think he handled it and his statement speaks for itself.\"\n\nThe two celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary on April 26, a day they let pass without public comment, in contrast to their usual stream of commentary in various social media.\n\nTheir postings over the last few months offered a picture of a couple leading separate lives. Since Schwarzenegger left office, he has been jetting around the world, heading to Brazil's Xingu River with director James Cameron, to Nigeria for a paid speech, to London for Mikhail Gorbachev's 80th birthday party, to Val d'Isère in France for skiing and to Washington, D.C. to attend a White House summit on immigration reform.\n\nIn late March, Schwarzenegger announced a collaboration with famed comic book creator Stan Lee, saying, \"I have never had a conversation with Maria about any of this. I think it will be a big surprise.\"\n\nShriver mentioned the East Coast college tour and, in early April, visited the Bahamas while Schwarzenegger headed to Cannes to receive the Legion D'Honneur medal and promote his project with Lee.\n\nhttp://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-mew-arnold-maria-separate-20010510,0,961258.story\n\nSchwarzenegger fathered child with employee\n\nBy Adam Nagourney and Jennifer Steinhauer\n\nNew York Times\n\nPosted: 05/17/2011 07:03:25 PM PDT\n\nUpdated: 05/17/2011 07:03:26 PM PDT\n\nvar requestedWidth = 0;\n\nif(requestedWidth > 0){ document.getElementById('articleViewerGroup').style.width = requestedWidth + \"px\"; document.getElementById('articleViewerGroup').style.margin = \"0px 0px 10px 10px\"; } LOS ANGELES -- The stories were flying around eight years ago, when Arnold Schwarzenegger was in the midst of his unlikely attempt to unseat Gray Davis, California's Democratic governor: Schwarzenegger, married to Maria Shriver, had fathered a child with a woman who worked at the couple's Brentwood estate.\n\nSchwarzenegger's advisers had heard it. So had top aides to Davis, whom Schwarzenegger would go on to unseat. But in the closing days of what was a circus of a campaign, the rumors got pushed aside as Schwarzenegger dealt with a barrage of seemingly more credible allegations that he had groped and molested women during his years as a movie star, charges that Shriver battled back forcefully, contributing in large part to his victory.\n\nIn fact, Schwarzenegger acknowledged Tuesday, he had fathered a child with a member of his household staff a few years before running for office, a secret that he said he hid from his wife and that aides said he kept from them. Through much of her pregnancy and for the eight years that Schwarzenegger served as one of the highest-profile U.S. governors, the woman continued to work in the couple's home. Some of their friends, looking back, said they now believe the child was an occasional presence in the house in the gated community at the end of Mandeville Canyon Road.\n\nThat deception by Schwarzenegger ended Monday night when the governor, responding to an inquiry from The Los Angeles Times, released a statement\n\nacknowledging his child. Shriver -- his wife of 25 years, a former TV news correspondent and a member of the Kennedy family -- issued her own statement Tuesday reflecting what her friends described as the devastating and utterly shocking collapse of a marriage that had captured national attention. Shriver had moved out of the house and into a Beverly Hills hotel earlier this year.\n\n\"As a mother, my concern is for the children,\" she said. \"I ask for compassion, respect and privacy as my children and I try to rebuild our lives and heal. I will have no further comment.\"\n\nThe family scandal unfolded in real time on social networks. One of their sons, Patrick, 17, posted his distress on his Twitter account, although he presented his name as Patrick Shriver, rather than Patrick Schwarzenegger.\n\n\"Some days you feel\" terrible, he wrote, borrowing lyrics from a Fort Minor song, including a profanity to convey that feeling. He added, \"Some days you want to quit and just be normal for a bit, yet I love my family till death do us apart.\"\n\nHis sister Katherine, who is 21, wrote: \"This is definitely not easy but I appreciate your love and support as I begin to heal and move forward.\"\n\nThe disclosure set off a clamor in a city that has always been intrigued by the celebrity wattage produced by this literal marriage of show business and politics. Reporters and camera crews crowded around the looming stone gates near the couple's home, craning for a sight of the former governor. Schwarzenegger and Shriver found themselves back in the sights of two websites that have feasted on their marriage before: TMZ and Gawker.\n\n\"The Schwarzenegger love child scandal has arrived,\" Gawker announced.\n\nAssociates of Schwarzenegger and Shriver, pointing to the request for privacy, offered only scant details. The child was said to be a boy, about 14 years old. Several friends said the mother was working around the house, pregnant, at the same time that Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple's four children, Christopher, who is 13. The woman and the child did not live in the house.\n\nBy every account, Schwarzenegger made no mention of the situation to Shriver or to the team of political consultants he brought in during the 2003 recall election against Davis, and in the re-election campaign in 2006.\n\nFriends of both Schwarzenegger and Shriver expressed astonishment not only at his actions but also that he eluded detection by the public and his family over the course of his very public life. Schwarzenegger told his wife about the affair only late last year, when his public service career had come to end, and shortly after the mother of his son left the job with severance after working for the family for 20 years.\n\n\"After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago,\" he said in a statement. \"I understand and deserve the feelings of anger and disappointment among my friends and family. There are no excuses, and I take full responsibility for the hurt I have caused. I have apologized to Maria, my children and my family. I am truly sorry.\"\n\nDemocrats who worked for Davis during the recall election said they were not surprised at the revelation, noting that rumors about Schwarzenegger's infidelity were a constant backdrop of the campaign.\n\n\"In 2001 when he first came forward and indicated that he might run for governor there were rumors coming to us constantly about affairs and children,\" said Garry South, a Democratic consultant in Los Angeles.\n\nThat year, Schwarzenegger threatened to sue South, who worked for Davis at the time and sent reporters copies of Premiere magazine detailing Schwarzenegger's issues with women.\n\n\"There were always (stories) about kids,\" he said, \"how there was a son out there, some kid he had been supporting.\"\n\nPeter Ragone, who was a senior adviser to Davis at the time, said: \"There were all sorts of rumors flying around like this. Voters knew what they needed to know on this topic with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and honestly they just didn't care.\"\n\nNone of Shriver's political advisers agreed to speak on the record about the episode; nor did her friends or family members. Shriver has always benefited from careful image management and keeping a close cadre of friends and confidants who circle the wagons in times of trouble. One of the last public events that Shriver and Schwarzenegger attended together was the funeral of her father, R. Sargent Shriver, who died in January. Some who attended said that the two were polite to each other but in no way warm; Shriver gave a heart-rending and pointed eulogy, as her husband looked on, praising her father for teaching her brothers how to properly treat women.\n\nhttp://www.mercurynews.com/politics-government/ci_18083022\n\n8701girl;3378489 said:\n\nNow thats something i didnt see coming...\n\nThat's because Schwarzenegger hired Barresi & Pellicano to keep alot secret.\n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/LegalCenter/story?id=1625097&page=1\n\nHollywood 'Fixer' Now Has Some Celebrities Fearing the Worst\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nPrint\n\nSingle Page\n\nFont Sizes\n\nFeb. 16, 2006\n\nIn a town that's no stranger to scandal, this might be one of the biggest -- a massive wiretapping scheme that might reveal Hollywood's darkest secrets and implicate some of the leading lawyers in show business and their celebrity clients.\n\nIt all centers on the actions of one man -- private eye to the stars Anthony Pellicano.\n\nThe 61-year-old came out of Chicago with a reputation for tough tactics and a knack for getting the dirt on just about everybody. Pellicano was the quintessential Hollywood gumshoe, boasting a client list that read like a who's who: John Travolta, Farrah Fawcett, Kevin Costner, Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger among them.\n\n\"Pellicano is the last-resort guy, and no matter what you have to do to put a fire out for a celebrity, that's what you gotta do,\" said Paul Barresi, a former porn star and freelance private investigator who worked for Pellicano.\n\nBut other private investigators said that Pellicano employed some questionable tactics in getting information.\n\nPrivate eye Richard DiSabatino, who has known Pellicano for more than a decade, put it this way: \"He broke the law to satisfy his clients. And normal PIs don't do that.\"\n\nThe Fixer\n\nBut Pellicano's wise-guy persona was tailor-made for Hollywood. His mystique actually became the stuff of movies. Travolta reportedly modeled the lead character in \"Get Shorty\" -- mob-guy-turned-movie-man Chili Palmer -- after him.\n\n\"He was very friendly with him. With ... Travolta,\" said DiSabatino. \"You know the fact where, uh, Chili Palmer would always say, 'Look into my eyes'? Well, that was Pellicano's favorite saying.\"\n\nHe called himself the \"sin-eater\" -- the ultimate Hollywood fixer. But his own \"sins\" have landed him in trouble with the law. He already served 2½ years in prison on weapons charges, and he's now facing a 110-count federal indictment for racketeering and conspiracy.\n\n\"What he did was basically set up wiretaps and listened in on people's communications that they believed were private without them knowing,\" said George Cardona, the U.S. attorney prosecuting the case.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Pellicano's gift for getting dirt was primarily a highly sophisticated illegal eavesdropping scheme. Pellicano allegedly paid two phone company employees thousands of dollars to help him listen in on Hollywood's secrets.\n\nCelebrity Secrets\n\nWith the reams of information Pellicano allegedly got from the wiretaps, he seemed able to solve clients' problems with ex-wives, business rivals and even the law. With his reputation on the rise, it seemed that everyone in show business with a crisis came calling.\n\nWhen Michael Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy in 1993, it was Pellicano who produced a tape he said proved the boy's family was trying to extort money from the pop star. Eventually, the family agreed to settle, and no criminal charges were brought against Jackson.\n\nIn 1991, when a British tabloid paid a woman $30,000 for her story alleging an affair with Kevin Costner, his lawyer hired Pellicano and the story was killed before it appeared in the United States.\n\nDuring the messy public divorce of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Pellicano was on the case for Cruise. But unbeknown to Pellicano, DiSabatino was hired by Kidman.\n\n\"So I put her on scramblers immediately,\" DiSabatino said. \"So that, uh, if there was anybody who was eavesdropping, it wasn't gonna happen.\"\n\nDiSabatino said that some of the ugly headlines that surfaced around that time weren't an accident.\n\n\"What became very obvious was that he had a contact in one of the tabloids,\" he said.\n\nActually, Pellicano had several tabloid reporters on the payroll.\n\nPaul Barresi, the first man ever to appear on the cover of Hustler magazine, worked as an investigator for Eddie Murphy's lawyer when the star was arrested for picking up a transsexual prostitute. (No charges were ever brought against Murphy.) Barresi also regularly freelanced for Pellicano.\n\n\"Whenever there was a damaging story involving a celebrity client that involved sex, then I was involved,\" Barresi said.\n\nBarresi said that Pellicano hired him to \"get dirt on\" Sylvester Stallone. In addition, the the actor's phone was allegedly bugged by Pellicano when Stallone was in the midst of a bitter lawsuit over stock losses at Planet Hollywood.\n\n\"He may very well have wanted the dirt to use against Stallone. Maybe Stallone crossed him. I don't know. But I never asked questions,\" Barresi said.\n\nNot Above the Law\n\nAnd Pellicano wasn't just getting the dirt and dishing it. There were also times when he allegedly got physical. When hired by billionaire financier Leonard Green to help with his divorce from his wife of five years, Jude Green, she said he delivered his \"beware\" message in person.\n\n\"I pulled up at the dog groomer and this man blocked my car, I couldn't get out,\" said Green. \"And then he came up to the window and thrust his face. I came out, and I asked him to move his car and he sort of like shoved me. No matter where I went that day, he was in my face blocking my car and constantly.\"\n\nThe experience was more than a little unnerving. \"I just remember my heart beating out of my chest and really being terrified,\" she said.\n\nLater, the FBI told Green that Pellicano had been monitoring her home telephone calls. And Green said there was more -- telephone threats, damage to her property's gate and more than once, she said, her car's brakes were tampered with.\n\n\"Pellicano had a reputation in Hollywood as a bully for hire,\" DiSabatino. \"So people would hire him and they would like when he'd talk to people and threaten them.\"\n\nEventually, Pellicano got so big that even the future governor put him to work. The Schwarzenegger campaign, reeling from allegations of sexual harassment, asked Pellicano to investigate the actor's entire past to find every kind of claim an opponent might throw at him.\n\nBarresi got the call. \"Pellicano said to me, 'I want you to find out everything you can about Schwarzenegger. Get all the dirt you can,'\" he said.\n\nPellicano bragged about the Schwarzenegger job, said DiSabatino.\n\n\"And I asked him, 'What was the outcome?' And he laughed. He said, 'The outcome is he shouldn't run for anything,'\" said DiSabatino.\n\nPellicano, of course, got it wrong about the future governor. But perhaps a bigger mistake was that he began to believe his own hype.\n\nIn 2002, Pellicano allegedly threatened a Los Angeles Times reporter. The FBI raided Pellicano's office and found explosives, a detonator and hand grenades.\n\nIn 2004, Pellicano was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for illegal possession of dangerous weapons. He was set to be released earlier this month -- until the wiretapping charges were handed down Feb. 6, after a three-year federal investigation.\n\nPellicano has pleaded not guilty to the charges, but he remains in custody.\n\nMeanwhile, some big names in Hollywood are holding their breath. It seems the style that made this Tinseltown gumshoe so sought after just may be his undoing.\n\n\"He felt that he was untouchable,\" said Barresi. \"And he also probably felt protected.\"\n\nother links:\n\nhttp://www.callawyer.com/story.cfm?pubdt=NaN&eid=877922&evid=1\n\nThe year was 2001, and Schwarzenegger was thinking seriously about running for governor. But a lot of nasty rumors were floating around about the movie star's personal life. What might an enterprising investigator find out about him if he really tried? Barresi believes he was hired to go through that exercise. (Two weeks after Barresi submitted his report, which has never been leaked to the public, Schwarzenegger announced that he wasn't going to run, and it wasn't until the summer of 2003, when then-Gov. Gray Davis was in complete meltdown, that he changed his mind.)\n\nBarresi is a really bad guy.\n\nHe even had links to Heath Ledger:\n\nhttp://www.hollywood.com/news/Ledgers_Family_Found_Out_About_Tragedy_from_the_Media/5050220\n\nThe private investigator, Paul Barresi, tells In Touch Weekly magazine that Bell and Ledger were very close.\n\nBarresi, a family friend, tells the publication, \"His mother and father heard of his death on the news. We are all devastated. The whole family is devastated over his death, and more so over having to learn of his death from the media.\"\n\nBut he insists reports that Ledger may have taken his own life are ridiculous.\n\nHe adds, \"The last thing that Heath would want to do is throw it all away. He was very happy living in New York.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger fathered child with employee\n\nBy Adam Nagourney and Jennifer Steinhauer\n\nNew York Times\n\nPosted: 05/17/2011 07:03:25 PM PDT\n\nUpdated: 05/17/2011 07:03:26 PM PDT\n\nvar requestedWidth = 0;\n\nif(requestedWidth > 0){ document.getElementById('articleViewerGroup').style.width = requestedWidth + \"px\"; document.getElementById('articleViewerGroup').style.margin = \"0px 0px 10px 10px\"; } LOS ANGELES -- The stories were flying around eight years ago, when Arnold Schwarzenegger was in the midst of his unlikely attempt to unseat Gray Davis, California's Democratic governor: Schwarzenegger, married to Maria Shriver, had fathered a child with a woman who worked at the couple's Brentwood estate.\n\nSchwarzenegger's advisers had heard it.

Some who attended said that the two were polite to each other but in no way warm; Shriver gave a heart-rending and pointed eulogy, as her husband looked on, praising her father for teaching her brothers how to properly treat women.\n\nhttp://www.mercurynews.com/politics-government/ci_18083022\n\nWow!"
