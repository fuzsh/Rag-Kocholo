        "text": "The first major survey of the work of conceptual artist Jennifer Bolande, now on view at Inova/Kenilworth, at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, spans three decades and a variety of media. Bolande emerged and developed her conceptual aims during the 1980s in New York’s East Village when she was rooted in the milieu of the Nature Morte Gallery and the first-generation Metro Pictures group. Her unique fusion of photography and sculpture is conceptually subtle and challenging, eliciting a range of reactions from critics over the years. Art critic Holland Cotter, writing in the New York Times, praised her \"low-key wit, lively inventiveness and a subtle eye for metaphor.\"\n\nBolande, a professor of art at UCLA and a winner of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2007, visited Milwaukee for the opening of her show. While in town, she sat down for a conversation with artist and writer David Robbins, whom she met when the two were young artists together in 1980s New York.\n\nDavid Robbins: Why is the exhibition titled “Landmarks?”\n\nJennifer Bolande: “Landmarks” was the title of my first show, almost 30 years ago. It seemed fitting to bookend this epoch with the same title. The word “landmark” may refer to an event, a place or an object. I’m often inspired by images, objects or situations that subtly confuse time and space.\n\nDR: The exhibition appears very diverse, and juxtaposes works from different phases of your art. There are many different media — photography, sculpture, film, drawing — yet the whole is very focused and disciplined. A viewer senses a strong underlying consistency.\n\nJB: In organizing this exhibition (Inova curator) Nicholas Frank and I chose to emphasize relationships and repetitions of major elements — themes, materials, methods-.....- To be able to see many works from different phases together, in dialog, in the same room, is a rare opportunity for any artist. It’s exciting.\n\nDR: Your first retrospective is also your first exhibition in Milwaukee. For people who may not be familiar with your work, let’s give them a door in. Take the simple example of an audio speaker, which recurs in your work, sometimes as an image, sometimes as an object that you’ve fabricated.\n\nJB: Speakers have appeared in varied guises with different emphases in my work over the years. A speaker communicates to us symbolically as well as literally. I think of speakers as sites of expectation — you look at it waiting for something, whether vibration or information, to emerge from it. But is this about speaking or listening? In using a speaker in my work, am I engaging an authoritative voice or struggling against someone else’s? There’s not only one read.\n\nDR: In using images of microphones or speakers or movie marquees, as you do, are you trying to isolate the act of communication itself as a material — how a sensory experience works or how information comes to us through the senses, and what that information is, exactly? We’re immersed in communication media. It’s the artist’s job to make us look more deeply at that experience.\n\nJB: One of my favorite artists, Michael Snow, once said he wanted “to make seeing palpable.” I’m in sympathy with that goal. These technologies are extensions of our bodies, and like our bodies they evolve over time. A movie marquee, for example, is becoming a thing of the past. What does it mean for an important symbol of communication to become dated? How do we locate ourselves now?\n\nThe artifacts and fragments that I select from the cultural landscape tend to be things that have somehow lost the significance that they once had and are becoming obsolete or forgotten. I identify objects and images that are on the brink of extinction, archive and study them, then bring them back into circulation, reanimating them and giving them new lives, new locations, new meanings.\n\nDR: Given that, it makes sense that photography, which is a universal archiving medium, would play a central role in your work, both as subject and as material.\n\nJB: Photography is the beginning point for a lot of my work. I wouldn’t call myself a photographer but, rather, someone who works with photographs. I’m interested in the ways photographs convey meaning. Early on I resisted the (Henri) Cartier-Bresson use of the camera to capture a “perfect moment,” preferring instead to work with found images that engaged time in other ways. For many years I also rebelled against the idea of photography as a window into another world. I rejected the frame and sought other, more sculptural ways of employing photographs.\n\nDR: “Landmarks” includes some examples of these photo-objects. You have been widely credited with being one of the inventors of this, more physical way of using photographs. In a work from the 1980s you used what was probably the world’s largest found photograph, from a giant Kodak sign in Times Square. You’re not just in the studio making things, you’re out in the world, encountering. I remember, from when we lived next door to each other on West 46th Street in New York, the time you hauled up the stairs a giant “O” from a Texaco sign!\n\nJB: I washed it in my bathtub!\n\nDR: Not most people’s everyday experience. What’s more important: the adventure that you have in making the work, or the finished work?\n\nJB: I’d ask it another way. Is the “art” in the object, the adventure, the editing, or the actual making? Is it in the reordering of my understanding to accommodate that experience or material, or in the resituating or construction of a new context for something?\n\nDR: Art is performing as something that generates experiences and stories — life material.\n\nJB: There is always a part of my working process that takes me on an adventure in the world. I fall in love with things from the public domain, orbit them for a time, and allow them to carry me into territory which is foreign to me. I notice something and then I pay attention to it, and that leads me to something else. It’s a twisty indirect path, a process of discovering what the focus should be. I study things over time, sometimes for years, to understand what it is, and what its attraction is for me-.....-.\n\nYou can start from the tiniest or most apparently mundane thing and it can lead to large and unexpected realizations — as William Blake said, you can find the universe in a grain of sand. But how you open that grain of sand onto the universe, that’s the question. That’s what you need to invent and discover. Even just making a photograph, often what you get is not what you thought you were after, and you have to be able to separate the two. I’m interested in separating out what’s being projected onto situations, what I’m projecting onto situations, and what’s really there.\n\nThe survey of Bolande's work will be on view at Inova/Kenilworth, 2155 N. Prospect Ave., through Aug. 8.\n\nVisit Jennifer Bolande's web site for more information about her work. To learn more about David Robbins, you might explore his High Entertainment book or his Ice Cream Social project.\n\nTop and bottom images are installation views of Bolande's current show at Inova. The middle image is \"Milk Crown,\" 1987, cast porcelain. It is also on view as part of the show.\n\nNote from Mary Louise: I would like to personally thank Jennifer Bolande and David Robbins for taking the time to have this discussion and share it with the readers of Art City. It's much appreciated."
