After their departure, begins correspondence with Cage that lasts during Kelly’s time in France.\n\nTravels with Coburn in July to Brittany, meeting French actress Arletty; decides to spend summer on Belle-Île-en-Mer. With Coburn, calls upon Alice B. Toklas in Paris to see the collection of her late partner, Gertrude Stein.\n\nSees exhibitions on Matisse, Kandinsky, and Gauguin.\n\nReturns to Belle-Île-en-Mer where he makes his first shaped work out of wood, Wood Cutout with String I.\n\nAfter sketching several drawings based on large windows observed at the Musée National d’Art Moderne, creates Window, Museum of Modern Art, Paris, using two joined panels for first time.\n\nIn December, visits Coburn in Mediterranean town of Sanary; together they travel to Antibes to visit the Musée Picasso.\n\n1950\n\nMeets French critic Michel Seuphor and early supporter of Mondrian.\n\nExhibits for first time in Europe at “Premier Salon des Jeunes Peintres,” Galerie des Beaux-Arts, Paris, with Wood Cutout with String III, (1949).\n\nAfter being introduced to Jean (Hans) Arp through Seuphor, travels with Coburn and Youngerman in February to Arp’s studio outside of Paris in Meudon-Val-Fleury, where he is impressed by the collages of Arp and the late Sophie Taueber-Arp.\n\nSees Matisse’s large-scale cutout Zulma (1950) at Salon de Mai, Paris.\n\nMeets Georges Vantongerloo, Alberto Magnelli, Francis Picabia, and Alexander Calder.\n\nInvited by Félix Del Marle, secretary general of the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, to show at their fifth Salon in Paris, where Kelly displays six works, including Window, Museum of Modern Art, Paris and Relief with Blue, their public debut; White Relief is rejected based on consensus that it is not art.\n\nVisits Arp again with Coburn.\n\nIn August, stays at La Combe, the villa of Youngerman’s in-laws in town of Meschers; earlier that year Youngerman had married french actress Delphine Seyrig, and her father Henri Seyrig, an archaeologist, will make the first purchase of a Kelly work, Antibes (1950) (EK 21), in 1951—the only sale Kelly will make in France.\n\nAt La Combe, draws shadows of a metal staircase; the motif becomes basis for series of four works, including La Combe I and La Combe II , a folding screen and his first work using several joined panels.\n\nBy fall, support from GI Bill runs out, and he begins teaching art classes to children at the American School. In December, is invited by Denise René to present his work to her gallery’s artists for consideration, but is refused, despite René’s support.\n\n1951\n\nIntroduced by Eduardo Paolozzi to Louis Clayeux, the director of Galerie Maeght, Paris.\n\nWith Youngerman and new friend George Koskas, convinces bookstore owners John Koenig and Jean-Robert Arnaud to turn the cellar of their shop into a gallery for young artists as very few Parisian galleries are showing emerging artists.\n\nAt the newly named Galerie Arnaud, the first exhibition features Youngerman, the second in April, is Kelly’s first solo show, with thirty works made since June 1949, including Window, Museum of Modern Art, Paris, Gate-Board, Window V, White Relief, Relief with Blue, La Combe I, Ormesson, and La Combe II.\n\nShows again at the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles with six works, such as Ormesson and La Combe II.\n\nHis position at the American School is terminated after the director sees his show at the Galerie Arnaud. Hired as night security guard under auspices of the Marshall Plan, allowing him to paint during the day.\n\nSeeks grant support by writing to Hilla Rebay, director of the Non-Objective Museum of Art, New York (which will be renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum the following year). In desperate need of money, later in the year, applies for a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship proposing a book project titled Line Form Color. In April of the following year, learns he is rejected.\n\nFor its seventy-fifth anniversary, the Boston Museum School mounts exhibition of former students, so Kelly ships La Combe III (1951) to Boston; the only abstract work in the show, the painting is sent to Cage in New York when exhibition closes and remains there until Kelly returns to the States in 1954.\n\nWith Youngerman and new friend Alain Naudé, visits Paris studio of Brancusi, forming a lasting impression.\n\nIncluded in group exhibition, “Tendance,” at Galerie Maeght, Paris, displaying five works, such as Cité and Meschers; the latter is admired by Braque, as well as by Gustav Zumsteg, a Swiss textile manufacturer and art collector, who commissions Kelly to create fabric designs, allowing him to give up his security guard job. Also through Galerie Maeght, meets Miró.\n\nReturns in November to Sanary, spending time with Coburn, Anne Weber, a classmate from the Boston Museum School, and Naudé.\n\nMakes Colors for a Large Wall, his largest work to date made of sixty-four joined panels each painted a monochrome color.\n\n1952\n\nMeets François Morellet, who is included in same group show as Kelly at a gallery in Nantes. Remains in Sanary until May and makes Red Yellow Blue White and Painting for a White Wall; the former is made with dyed cotton and marks the first time Kelly separates his panels across the wall, incorporating interstitial spaces in his work for the first time. With leftover fabric, designs a dress for Anne Weber.\n\nTravels to Marseilles to see Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation, still under construction at the time. Moves to Torcy, a village east of Paris.\n\nWrites to Jean-Pierre Hoschedé, Monet’s stepson, who invites him to visit Giverny where he and Naudé see Monet’s late Nymphéas paintings haphazardly stored. Inspired by this visit, paints next day at his Torcy studio Tableau Vert, his first single-canvas monochrome, which he wraps up because he thinks it unsuccessful; will not return to a single-canvas monochrome until 1966 with Yellow Piece, also his first shaped “cutout” made from canvas.\n\nFeatured in two group exhibitions, one in Caracas, and the other at Galerie Maeght, Paris, “Tendance,” where he shows four works, including Colors for a Large Wall, Méditerranée, and Fête à Torcy, and where he meets Alberto Giacometti, later visiting the sculptor’s studio.
