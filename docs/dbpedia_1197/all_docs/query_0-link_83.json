        "text": "(Special note: Inova will be closed on Gallery Night & Day due to flood-related issues on campus).\n\nThough Jennifer Bolande’s conceptual work has spanned more than two decades, it has remained remarkably consistent in its themes of transience, obsolescence, discovery and landscape.\n\nWe are truly fortunate to have a show of this internationally recognized artist’s work here in Milwaukee and so tenderly curated by Nicholas Frank and his team at Inova, at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.\n\nMuch already has been written about Bolande, a New York-based and Ohio-born artist, but save that heavy reading for after the show, or ignore it altogether. It’s my intention to give you enough of an introduction to pique your interest, and no more.\n\nHave you seen Harold Edgerton’s 1957 photograph of a splash of milk that looks like a coronet? If so, then you might get a deeper meaning of temporality and artistic parallels than the rest of us when you see Bolande’s porcelain sculpture “Milk Crown,” from 1987. If not, I believe you may still find a lovely, delicate statement on the beauty of a frozen moment in time. In other words, give it a chance and take from it what you will.\n\nBecause Bolande’s themes are so universal, so simple and accessible, most of us can bring our own experiences to the discussion. Although she experiments with all sorts of media, including photography, drawing, sculpture and assemblage, the threads of ideas remain on target no matter what the year.\n\nGlobes, for example. Bolande hunts for globes in strangers’ windows and then photographs them in order to incorporate them into her works. A fun and natural question for a visitor to the show is: What do the globes mean? In the sculpture “Topology House,” from 2002, Bolande has assembled many images of globes peeking from people’s windows and built an unlikely plywood house of them, mesmerizing the viewer (this one, anyway) with ideas of capturing the whole world in one’s window, or even better, in somebody else’s.\n\nBolande is a master of rhythm and repetition for poetic effect, and one should consider how the works have been arranged in this show as well. Themes and imagery repeat in a kind of visual rhyming verse. Globe, globe, globe. Flag, flag, drum, drum. Map, map. Mountains.\n\nOne poignant example of this visual strumming is found in three works that feature the image of the Lever House, a glassy, modernist skyscraper in New York: “Appliance House” a lightbox sculpture of the building, “Trailer for Appliance House,” a video work and “Landmark Acquisition,” a drawing on a newspaper ad for the structure, all from between 1998 to 2000. There is a spot in this exhibit where you can stand and see all three of these works and compare them for the sake of visual punning — a very thoughtful arrangement.\n\nThe artist Constantin Brancusi famously quipped, “What is real is not the external form, but the essence of things.” Submit yourself to the work of Bolande while you have the opportunity, and you will be invited to catch those glimpses with her.\n\n“Landmarks” a show of work by Jennifer Bolande remains on view through Aug. 8 at Inova, 2155 N. Prospect Ave.\n\nStacey Williams-Ng is an artist, the arts writer for Milwaukee Home & Fine Living magazine and a regular Art City contributor.\n\nNote from Mary Louise: This is the first major survey of the work of Jennifer Bolande, a professor of art at UCLA and a Guggenheim Fellowship winner. When in town for the opening of the show, she sat down for a conversation with artist and writer David Robbins, whom she met when the two were young artists together in 1980s New York. That exchange waspublished at Art City and in the Journal Sentinel.\n\nImages (from top): \"Milk Crown\" and \"Topology House\" by Jennifer Bolande; installation views of \"Landmarks.\" Images courtesy the artist and Inova."
