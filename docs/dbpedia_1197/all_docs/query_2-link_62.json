He has earned 10 No. 1 songs as a writer, including Kelsea Ballerini and Kenny Chesneyâs âHalf Of My Hometown,â Maren Morrisâ âThe Bonesâ and âI Could Use A Love Song,â Thomas Rhettâs âIt Goes Like This,â Blake Sheltonâs âSure Be Cool If You Did,â Keith Urban and Miranda Lambertâs âWe Were Us,â David Nailâs âWhatever Sheâs Got,â Jake Owenâs âBeachinâ,â Jason Aldeanâs âLights Come On,â and Michael Rayâs âThink A Little Less.â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nRobbins penned four cuts on Morrisâ album Girl (2019 CMA Album of the Year) including her Grammy-nominated, 2021 ACM Song of the Year, 2020 CMA Song of the Year, 2020 AIMP Song of the Year, and two-week country No. 1 single, âThe Bones.â The smash single was also No. 1 at Hot AC, No. 1 at Adult Contemporary radio, a 19-week No. 1 at Billboardâs Hot Country Songs, No. 9 on Billboardâs Top Hot 100 Songs of 2020, No. 2 on Billboardâs Top Country Songs of 2020, and has accumulated 1 billion total audience spins on iHeart Radio.\n\nHe is a CMA Triple Play Award winner for penning three No. 1 songs in a 12-month period, and was ASCAP Song Of The Year winner for Rhettâs âIt Goes Like This.â Robbins also received a 2021 ASCAP Pop Award for âThe Bonesâ being one of the most performed pop songs of the year. As a producer, Robbins has produced hits such as Maddie + Taeâs âDie From A Broken Heartâ and Canaan Smithâs âLove You Like That,â as well as a No. 1 album for RaeLynnâs Wildhorse.\n\nâ\n\nâJimmy is a one of a kind talent and we couldnât be more excited to be working with him at Boom,â shares Boom Sr. Director, A&R Shaina Botwin. âJoe Fisher signed Jimmy to his first publishing deal over 10 years ago, so itâs a sweet reunion to be working alongside him again now with our partners at Cinq and our admin partner Warner Chappell.â\n\nâ\n\nâWe couldnât have picked a better partner in Boom, and a better creator in Jimmy, to kick off our venture into Nashville,â shares Cinq Music President Barry Daffurn. âThings are off to a great start, and weâre extremely excited for what the future holds.â\n\nâ\n\nâI am so excited to be working with Boom and Cinq,â says Robbins. âIâm really looking forward to growing and expanding my writing world in this new partnership and canât wait to see what we do together!â"
