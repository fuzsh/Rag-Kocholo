        "meta_description": "Listen to Ep. 36: Lindy Robbins from And The Writer Is...with Ross Golan. Our next award-winning guest is without a doubt a lyrical genius. Born and raised in Los Angeles, this unstoppable hitmaker has been singing, with large thanks to her musically gifted father, since she was 3 years old. Growing up she preformed in theatre, cabaret and comedy improv, then moved to the Big Apple where she joined an acclaimed vocal quartet before realizing her love of music resides in songwriting. She is responsible for crafting David Guetta’s #1 hit \"Dangerous (feat. Sam Martin)\", the top 10 charting single \"Skyscraper\" for Demi Lovato, as well as the 2006 Disney Radio Song of the Year \"Cinderella\" by The Cheetah Girls and most recently, \"No Goodbyes\" off Dua Lipa’s self titled album. With writing credits for major artists such as Jason Mraz, One Direction, Brandy, Fifth Harmony, Rachel Platten, Faith Hill, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys and Toni Braxton, it comes with no surprise that this multi-platinum songwriter is one of the most highly sought after in the game. She is an ASCAP Pop Award winner for the songs \"Want to Want Me\" by Jason Derulo, \"Classic\" by MKTO, \"Tonight, Tonight\" by Hot Chelle Rae, and \"What’s Left of Me\" by Nick Lachey. It is our sincere pleasure to announce, And The Writer Is…Lindy Robbins!",

        "text": "Ep. 189: Tuff Morgan (peermusic)\n\n17:23|\n\nWe’re excited to announce a special bonus interview with Tuff Morgan, the VP of A&R at peermusic. Ross recently sat down with Tuff to discuss the publishing world, and everything they do over at peermusic. Read below to find out more about peermusic ad listen to this conversation on any platform you find your podcasts! peermusic is somewhat uniquely situated, in that they are privately owned and also have a sizable global footprint, operating from 39 offices across 32 countries. This enables them to give their clients the best of all worlds—global reach paired with personal attention and less “red tape” allowing them to move quickly to maneuver on behalf of their writers. Their global reach also enables them to provide a high level of international creative collaboration opportunities for our songwriters, cross-cultural and global songwriting camps, a strong global administration infrastructure, and global sync teams working together to increase the value for their writer’s song catalogs. But while they offer the benefit of working with a global company, they really have a family environment and work very close with their writers. This is from the top down. The company has been led by the same family, the Peers, since its inception nearly 100 years ago. They are now in their third generation of Peer family leadership. They work to sign the best talent and are a champion for songwriters and artists, from those just starting out to those topping global charts. And as an indie, it’s fair to say that they do prefer to keep their roster highly curated because their creative teams work very hard to ensure that their writers and artists are seen, heard, prioritized and supported at every stage of their careers. I think this is what helps make peermusic a first call for those in the industry.\n\nEp. 187: James Blunt\n\n01:10:49|\n\nToday’s guest is a songwriting legend who has knocked out seven albums over two decades, sold over 20 million records worldwide, and garnered countless accolades. After serving in the British Army, this writer's career launched into the stratosphere with one of the most evergreen evergreens ever. Following the success of his debut album, our guest continued on a streak of emotionally rich smashes — solidifying himself as one of the most prolific songwriters of his generation. However, it’s not just smashes that have kept this bloke relevant. This writer is funny as hell and his personality is a fixture on social media. All the way from the countryside in the UK, this family man’s humility and perspective shine a light on how authenticity is an artist’s most important quality.And The Writer Is…James Blunt!\n\nEp. 185: Billy Steinberg\n\n01:27:21|\n\nToday’s guest is a songwriting hall of fame who has been a fixture in the writing scene for decades. Defining and launching careers one lyric at a time, this writer has crafted anthems for Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Whitney Houston, Heart, The Bangles, Pretenders, Linda Ronstadt, Jojo, Demi Lovato, and many more. As much as these songs launched these artists into space, they also established this writer as one of the best writers in pop history. A Californian from humble beginnings, this writer has shown that the craft of songwriting can be as timeless as the songs themselves. And The Writer Is…Billy Steinberg!\n\nEp. 183: James Bay pt.2\n\n59:51|\n\nToday’s three-time Grammy Award-nominated, two-time BRIT Award recipient, claimed top honors at the Ivor Novellos not just because he is an authentic crooner but because he is a prolific song craftsman. His work is known globally but his story started at open mic nights. His raw talent was captured on camera by a fan and uploaded via YouTube, which caught the attention of RCA Records, propelling him into the star he is today. His introspective storytelling and commitment to his craft have allowed him to touch the hearts of fans from all different backgrounds. All the way from the United Kingdom, this advocate for WaterAid, tiptoes a fine line between rafter-reaching rock glory and tender folk songcraft.And The Writer Is…James Bay!\n\nEp. 182: Gracie Abrams\n\n01:33:23|\n\nToday’s guest is one of the leading young voices in the pop world. With her breakout hit in 2019, this writer instantly connected with listeners, and through hard work and a steady stream of releases, she has built a fiercely loyal fanbase. Her debut album came out in early 2023 and received high praise for its poetic honesty and depiction of the trials and tribulations of growing up. Following this release, our guest had an explosive year: performing as an opening act for Taylor Swift on her Eras Tour and receiving a nomination for Best New Artist at the 66th Grammy Awards. Her single with Noah Kahan marked her first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and gave the world a glimpse of her superstar power. Her sophomore album is set to release this summer, and we’re so excited to see what more this young artist has in store. And The Writer Is…Gracie Abrams!"
