        "text": "Ryah Ludins was born in 1896 and, with her parents and three younger siblings, emigrated from Russia to the United States in 1904. They settled in the Bronx near the Grand Concourse, and her father became an architect. Ludins attended Teachers College at Columbia University from 1917 until 1925. In 1922, she earned a BS in Fine Arts and a Diploma in Education (Teacher of Fine Arts), and she completed a graduate program in 1925. Simultaneously, she entered the Art Students League in 1923, taking a year of life classes with Kenneth Hayes Miller. Later in the 1920s, she went to France where she studied with André Lhote, and she would eventually also visit the Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City. Settled back in New York, she taught summer sessions at Teachers College in 1929, 1932, 1936, and 1938 (Leon Polk Smith was among her students). Ludins was employed in the mural division of the Works Progress Administration and completed a fresco called Central Park for Bellvue Hospital. She also continued to have a robust artistic exchange with Mexico, creating murals for the State Museum at Morelia, Michoacan. She must have hear about Hayter and his studio through her New York network, and she produced at least one engraving entitled Bombing (1945) which she exhibited with the Atelier 17 group twice, first at the Willard Gallery (1945) and again at the Leicester Galleries (1947). Unfortunately, an impression of this print has not yet been located. Ludins produced a number of lithographs throughout her career, most of which represent landscapes, seascapes, and urban scenery. In her final years, Ludins lived and taught at the Hotel Chelsea, where she passed away in 1957.\n\nArchives\n\nRyah Ludins portfolio, circa 1920-1950, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nBartlett, Eliot.
