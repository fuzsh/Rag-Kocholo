        "text": "“The one thing about Lenny’s music which was so tremendously important was that there always was a kinetic motor—there was a power in the rhythms of his work, or the change of rhythms in his work and the orchestration—which had a need for it to be demonstrated by dance.”\n\n-Jerome Robbins on Leonard Bernstein's Music\n\nBernstein broadened his musical palette when he met the dancer-turned-choreographer Jerome Robbins in the fall of 1943. Intrigued by the conductor/composer, Robbins asked Bernstein to write the music for his next ballet. Following the success of Fancy Free in 1944, the two legendary figures collaborated to create two more masterful ballets: Dybbuk and Facsimile, and two hit Broadway musicals: West Side Story and On the Town. Robbins later created a suite of dances from West Side Story for New York City Ballet. Robbins also choreographed a work to Bernstein’s Symphony No. 2: Age of Anxiety.\n\nIn 1971, Bernstein invited the accomplished choreographer Alvin Ailey to choreograph his Mass: A Theatre Piece for Singers, Players and Dancers, which was composed for the inauguration of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn addition to these works, many choreographers around the globe have found inspiration in Bernstein's concert works, on which to set their own choreography.\n\nLeonard Bernstein at 100\n\nThe Leonard Bernstein Centennial brought exciting choreographies to life and revisited time-honored dance works. Bernstein and Jerome Robbins’ first collaboration, the ballet Fancy Free, had 96 performances by major ballet companies in New York, Paris, Boston, San Francisco, Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Washington, DC. The Royal Ballet’s Bernstein Celebration, which included new ballets by Wayne McGregor, Christopher Wheeldon, and Liam Scarlett, was screened to 1,287 theaters throughout Europe, Asia and Australia, and later released on DVD. Kim Brandstrup set a new ballet to the music of Dybbuk in Germany. New York City Ballet premiered Justin Peck’s Easy, set to Prelude, Fugue & Riffs.In addition to new ballets, modern dance choreographers such as Larry Keigwin, Tom Gold, Doug Varone, and Kyle Abraham, found inspiration in the music and celebration of Leonard Bernstein.\n\nBALLETS\n\nFancy Free (1944)\n\nChoreography by Jerome Robbins\n\nCommissioned by Ballet Theatre\n\nWorld Premiere: 18 April 1944 / (Old) Metropolitan Opera House, New York, NY / Ballet Theatre Orchestra / Leonard Bernstein, conductor\n\nFacsimile: Choreographic Essay for Orchestra (1946)\n\nChoreography by Jerome Robbins\n\nCommissioned by Ballet Theatre\n\nWorld Premiere: 24 October 1946 / Broadway Theatre, New York, NY / Leonard Bernstein, conductor\n\nOther Versions:\n\nParallel Lives (1986), Gerard Charles, choreographer, Milwaukee Ballet\n\nDancing On (1988), Peter Breur, choreographer, First Performance: Croatian National Theater, Zagreb, Yougoslavia / Vjekoslava Suteja, conductor\n\nBernstein Dances (1998), John Neumeier, choregrapher, The Hamburg Ballet, Germany\n\nDybbuk (1974)\n\nChoreography by Jerome Robbins\n\nCommissioned by the New York City Ballet\n\nWorld Premiere: 16 May 1974 / State Theater, Lincoln Center, New York, NY / New York City Ballet / Leonard Bernstein, conductor\n\nOther Versions:\n\nSuite of Dances (from The Dybbuk Variations), Jerome Robbins, choreographer, First Performance: 17 January 1980 / State Theater, Lincoln Center, New York, NY / New York City Ballet / Robert Irving, conductor\n\nLeah (2001), Alexei Ratmansky, choreographer\n\nVerweile doch...
