        "text": "By of the\n\nInternationally known artist David Robbins, who is based in the Milwaukee area, has been giving serious thought to what's funny for some time now.\n\nIn his new book, \"Concrete Comedy,\" he fashions an entirely new category of artist, connecting the antics of William Wegman and Andy Kaufman, of Ed Ruscha and Albert Brooks.\n\nThis is a natural extention of Robbins' earlier work and ideas. He was one of the first, after all, to make a connection between the art and entertainment worlds.\n\nHis 1986 artwork \"Talent\" commented on the nature of fame in the art world when art-world celebrity was a relatively new concept. The work featured a series of headshots of star artists, including Cindy Sherman, Jenny Holzer and Jeff Koons.\n\nLater, Robbins created a multi-platform project called \"The Ice Cream Social,\" a classic, American pasttime transformed by Robbins into a fun and intellectual art experiment. The project included a TV pilot for the Sundance Channel, a dance party-talk show featuring many Milwaukee artists and personalities.\n\nIn the new book (2011 Pork Salad Press), which I've just dipped into, Robbins once again resists the distinction between artist and entertainer. In it, he describes a comedy of objects and gestures that surfaced in the early part of the 20th century and that has found its way into fashion, architecture, advertising, design, music -- and art."
