        "text": "Jeff Rovner is a fine art photographer specializing in conceptual art. Through his photographs, he seeks to reveal order, beauty, and meaning in our chaotic world.\n\nHe is also the inventor of CONCEPT COMPANION, a tool to improve conceptual thinking.\n\nJeff was born in Washington, DC, in 1957. He earned his law degree from George Washington University in 1982. Before pursuing a full-time career as an artist, Jeff was a corporate attorney, technologist, and university professor. He is also a magician member of The Magic Castle.\n\nJeff’s artistic mentors have included photographers from the Magnum Photo Agency, National Geographic, and the Leica Akademie. Some of Jeff’s photographs are showcased in his 2016 book The Values of Le Petit Cirque, which includes a foreword by the co-creator of Cirque du Soleil.\n\nHe is a Board member and art exhibitor at the Laguna Beach Festival of Arts, a juried, annual two-month art show and performance venue that attracts more than 200,000 visitors each summer. He has exhibited his art at the Festival continuously since 2017.\n\nIn 2019, at the invitation of the United Nations, Jeff exhibited photographs from his Artificial Intelligence portfolio in Geneva, Switzerland, during the UN's AI for Good Global Conference. His work is held by dozens of corporate and private collectors.\n\nYou can learn more about Jeff’s artistic background in his VoyageLA profile.\n\nJeff shares a home in Laguna Beach with his wife and Theodore, their immense and unusually demonstrative cat. He (Jeff, not Theodore) looks forward to speaking with you.\n\nARTS LEADERSHIP\n\n2021 - Present Member of the Board of Trustees, Festival of Arts Foundation\n\n2019 - Present Member of the Board of Directors, Festival of Arts of Laguna Beach\n\nEXHIBITIONS\n\n2024 Festival of Arts, Laguna Beach\n\n2024 Laguna Art Museum, California Cool Art Auction\n\n2023 Festival of Arts, Laguna Beach\n\n2022 Festival of Arts, Laguna Beach\n\n2021 Festival of Arts, Laguna Beach\n\n2021 Summer Collective Art Show, Ritz Carlton Laguna Niguel\n\n2020 Festival of Arts, Laguna Beach (virtual exhibit)\n\n2019 Festival of Arts, Laguna Beach\n\n2019 United Nations AI For Good Global Summit, Geneva, Switzerland | video begins at 10:45\n\n2018 Festival of Arts, Laguna Beach\n\n2017 Festival of Arts, Laguna Beach\n\nBOOKS\n\n2018 Cirque Noir Cirque Blanc\n\n2016 The Values of Le Petit Cirque (foreword by Cirque du Soleil co-founder Gilles Ste-Croix)\n\nUSE OF PHOTOGRAPHS IN OTHER WORKS\n\n2024 Peace is Radical: ReflectSpace Gallery presents Shepard Fairey exhibition\n\n2024 Shepard Fairey - The Iconic Icon\n\n2024 Milan celebrates Shepard Fairey\n\n2023 Art Inscribed: Writing Inspired by the 2023 Festival of Arts\n\n2023 24 Hour Magic (Opening of OCMA), Orange Coast Magazine, pp. 82-87 (Jan 2023)\n\n2020 Otherworldly Scenes in Cappadocia, Turkey, Orange Coast Magazine, pp. 18-20 (2020)\n\n2018 Art-Inspired Writing Contest\n\n2018 Cover Illustration for Heather Holley's We All Need A Hero, sung by Chloe Beth Jones\n\n2017 Nobel Institute, Program to Accompany Nobel Peace Prize Concert\n\n2017 Cover Illustration of The Consolations of Philosophy, by Peter Morrison\n\nART EDUCATION\n\n2022 Natural Light Portrait Workshop with Peter Coulson\n\n2022 Photo Nomad Jordan Photography Workshop with David Samuel Robbins\n\n2021 Leica Akademie Workshop with Mark DePaola\n\n2019 Leica Akademie Workshop with Joey Carman\n\n2019 Leica Akademie Portraiture Workshop with Al Satterwhite\n\n2018 Leica Akademie Workshop with William Albert Allard\n\n2017 Leica Destination Burma Photography Workshop with Craig Semetko\n\n2016 Magnum Photos Los Angeles Workshop with Constantine Manos\n\n2014 National Geographic Paris Photography Workshop with Cotton Coulson & Sisse Brimberg\n\n2011 Leica Akademie Street Photography Workshop with Craig Semetko\n\nOTHER EDUCATION\n\n2008 Leadership Institute, Kellogg School of Northwestern University\n\n2008 Leading and Sustaining a Culture of Innovation, Kellogg School of Northwestern Univ.\n\n1982 JD, The George Washington University Law School\n\n1979 BS (Zoology), University of Maryland\n\nPRESS\n\n2023 Not just a game: The role of Artificial Intelligence, Stu News Laguna\n\n2023 Festival of Arts presents multimedia works and much more, Orange County Register\n\n2021 Festival of Arts Debuts New, Free Smartphone App, Stu News Laguna\n\n2020 Festival of Arts Expands New FOAVirtual, Stu News Laguna\n\n2019 Photographer Jeff Rovner Elected to Festival of Arts Board of Directors, Stu News Laguna\n\n2019 FOA Board of Directors Previews 2020 Pageant, Stu News Laguna\n\n2019 Emerging Artists Showcased at Junior Art Awards Ceremony, Stu News Laguna\n\n2019 Check out Jeff Rovner’s Artwork, VoyageLA\n\n2019 Timeless Wonder of Festival of Arts, Stu News Laguna\n\n2018 Writing Contest Begets a Book, Laguna Beach Independent\n\n2018 Laureates to Host Writing Contest, Laguna Beach Independent\n\n2018 Literary Scene Enlivened in Laguna, Stu News Laguna\n\n2018 The Art of Design, Laguna Beach Magazine, pp. 48-50\n\n2018 The Wizardry Behind Jeff Rovner's Stunning & Mystical Fine Art Photography, Stu News\n\n2018 Photographer Jeff Rovner Featured at LOCA Art Club Event, Stu News Laguna\n\n2018 LitLaguna’s LB Expression, Spoken-Word and Hooping, Stu News Laguna\n\n2017 Festival's Rejuvenation Visible Inside as Well as Out, Laguna Beach Independent\n\n2017 How the Circus Came to Town, Stu News Laguna\n\n2017 Behind the Magic of Le PeTiT CiRqUe, Stu News Laguna\n\n2017 Laguna Life & People Profile, Stu News Laguna\n\n2013 ’Gnome Home, Laguna Beach Independent\n\nCirque Performance photos\n\nGallery of selected people and places\n\n© 2024 Jeffrey Scott Rovner.
