        "text": "​​Without galleries — the point of entry for both artists and buyers — there would be no art market. But these businesses are also legendary for their lack of transparency. Information, especially about finances, seems opaque ​and secretive by design​.\n\n​​With this in mind, we set out to learn the ​​basic mechanics of running a gallery in New York​ City circa 2023 ​— what it costs, for everything from rent to insurance to other, less ​anticipated ​​expenses​. New York was a natural area of focus, as it is home to more than 760 galleries with at least one paid employee; that’s 16 percent of all similar galleries in the U.S., more than any other city, according to a 2020 analysis by the art economist Clare McAndrew. While much attention in the press is ​​lavished on the handful of megagalleries routinely selling multimillion-dollar paintings, we focused on a group of art dealers with five or fewer full-time employees who are more representative of the small or midsize businesses that make up most of the industry.\n\nMost dealers get into the game for a simple reason: They want to help build the careers of the artists they love and help other people fall in love with them, too. Along the way, they pick up a skill set that ranges from charming wealthy collectors by night to applying drywall by day.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
