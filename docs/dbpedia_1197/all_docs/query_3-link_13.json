        "text": "David Robbins spent about a year in Andy Warhol's Factory as a young artist. Robbins, who initially made a name for himself in the 1980s with conceptual works about the art machine, has shown work internationally and returned to the Milwaukee area about a decade ago. In recent months, he's been exploring the idea of creating TV commercials for art -- including a freshly made suite of ads for the show of late Warhol works at the Milwaukee Art Museum. What follows is a Q&A between David and I about his years with Warhol and the new ads. After that, you will find an embedded video with the Warhol commercials themselves. Robbins hopes to air the ads on actual TV in the coming weeks. Enjoy.\n\nMary Louise: David, tell me about how and when you crossed paths with Andy Warhol?\n\nDavid: Working for Andy Warhol Enterprises was my first job in New York, in '79, after I'd graduated from college. I had a friend who worked at Interview magazine as a receptionist. She was leaving to get married, and she recommended that they hire me for that position. My job developed from there. During the week I worked for the magazine and, later, for Andy's TV show, and on Saturdays I would come to the office and do extra work. Saturdays were quiet, with usually just Andy and Vincent Fremont, who then was vice-president of AWE, present. Mostly I'd busy myself with organizing some cluttered corner of the Factory, but occasionally I'd hand Andy paint while he worked. That was my big contribution to his art! For him it meant nothing, I'm sure, but as I did it I'd think \"I'm handing Andy Warhol blue paint.\" Slightly surreal, to a kid from Whitefish Bay. I'd also escort Andy to book signings and events such as that. So I got to know him a little bit.\n\nMLS: How did working for Andy influence you as an artist?\n\nDR: I think the main influence came from seeing what it meant to be an artist who was at the top of the art world. Andy was the king of New York. He knew everyone and, because he was Andy Warhol, could pursue projects with anyone. There was real social, cultural, and financial power concentrated in his activities. Seeing that up close was fascinating, but it also liberated me from having to strive to replicate it; I'd seen it, and I could pursue...another model. That mattered, because I wanted to become an artist-- which meant that after a while I had to leave; you can't stay at the Factory and have your own career as an artist. I stayed a little more than a year, then I quit. I'm the only person who worked there who subsequently had a real, self-sustaining career as an artist. I wish Andy had lived to see that come about. He'd have been really surprised!\n\nMLS: This isn't the first time you've made commercials for art exhibits. What gave you this idea initially and what's the goal?\n\nDR: I started doing them about six months ago, to promote exhibitions at Green Gallery East here in Milwaukee. I did them because there have never really been TV commercials for art exhibitions. Until fairly recently the assumption had been that a general audience wasn't interested in \"that wacky art world,\" where weirdos like Andy Warhol operate. But that assumption isn't quite as true as it once was. In the past ten or twenty years the mainstream audience has become more comfortable with contemporary art. The numbers for museum attendance, world-wide, are huge, many people collect contemporary art, and thousands of kids graduate every year with the ambition to be a professional contemporary artist. All of that suggests that the gap between art and the mainstream has narrowed. In an information society, art doesn't seem quite so distant and strange. TV commercials for art exhibitions are just another step in an ongoing process. Perfectly logical, in a way.\n\nTelevision has become an underutilized resource. Today everybody thinks they should be putting their stuff online, on the Internet, while TV, a medium from an earlier phase of technology, sits there right in front of us! For a little bit of money your work can be broadcast to thousands of people, right in their homes. Just buy a little TV time and put the stuff on the air. (Bobby Ciraldo and Andrew Swant and I also do that with our TV show, Something Theater.) Actually, it's sort of weird that most people will see my commercials online, because it really isn't their intended context. But you can't have everything!\n\nMy TV commercials are really made out of the corner of my eye. They're not \"my art\" or \"my project\" or anything. I make them for fun, to promote art or artists or exhibitions. Still, I've found that, before releasing them to the public, I do feel an anxiety similar to opening an exhibition. Will people like them? Are they good enough? Am I alone in thinking this interesting or attractive? Those sorts of fears pop up before putting out the ads. I don't put nearly the work into them that I put into making a movie, book, or artwork, but it still takes effort to make something that communicates something of the art or the exhibition without becoming insular. The commercials have to perform as real commercials. That said, one can still explore the \"TV commercial\" as a form. What makes a TV commercial? What are the rules? It's a specific form, and I can play with the form. Some of the Warhol ads are little art history lessons, for example. Can you put that sort of thing into a commercial?\n\nBut the meat of the matter is just in the idea of doing them--an artist making commercials for art, sincerely, and inserting them into mainstream broadcasting culture. That's really the thing that is being \"created\"--that relationship. What they look or sound like is secondary.\n\nMLS: Are there any challenges associated with making a commercial for a Warhol show in particular\n\nDR: The obvious thing to avoid is anything that apes one of Andy's own visual strategies--the replication of images, the misregistration of images, the sometimes lurid color combinations. You have to refer to Warhol's visual sensibility without replicating his style. Another challenge is that so many people have an idea about Warhol! You have to dislodge that, because the exhibition at the art museum doesn't include the things that people already know.\n\nThere were also hard practical realities to consider. For instance, I couldn't show any of the paintings. It would have been too expensive to do so because of the fees attending the reproduction rights. When I make commercials for gallery exhibitions, I can show the art and build the commercial around that. But with a museum exhibition, you can't show the art because to do so is too expensive. It's absurd, of course, but that's the reality of it. So I had to work with those constraints, and invent ways around them.\n\nMLS: What are the challenges of making something that will both genuinely connect with a mainstream broadcasting culture and also communicate something essential about the artist?\n\nDR: That's exactly the challenge, to strike that balance. The commercials aren't really made for artists. Artists already have their ideas about Warhol, right? The commercials are made with a general audience in mind.I trust the audience's intelligence, and that trust gives me freedom to explore the \"TV commercial\" form. The choices I make, the images that I choose to combine and the way I combine them may be designed to challenge the audience a little--but only a little, because the main work of the commercial is to attract you to the product. You may not know how or why you're attracted--and there are lots of ways to attract, it can be intellectual or sensual or subliminal--but there has to be attraction on some level. I can't interfere with that. Discovering the many different varieties of attraction is a big part of why it's fun making these things.\n\nMLS: Is it important for you to make these commercials independently, separate from, for example, the museum itself?\n\nDR: It is. I undertake these on my own, for my own reasons. They promote the show, but there is also an unavoidable subtext. Making commercials for any exhibition at any museum stirs up questions about control. Who in the end owns art? Who owns a museum? Artists have been raising such questions for years. Andy did it himself. He's the guy who got the ball rolling in terms of photographic, mass-produced images, their control, and their use in art. Since then, many artists have contributed to that investigation. I'm extending that tradition with contemporary technology. In an earlier period, I might have responded to an exhibition by writing a review, having my say, and publishing it somewhere. I could say what I wished and make it public. The same conditions and freedoms apply to video and the Internet. I can promote the exhibition, and the work of an artist I've given a lot of thought to. I could also be critical of an exhibition, of course. But the TV commercial form is all about promotion and attraction, not critique.\n\nIf the product was, say, Miller beer, I couldn't make my own commercial, my own promotion. There'd be all sorts of \"brand integrity\" and ownership issues attached. But art has a different life in the culture. Art is always open to interpretation. Art can't be controlled or branded in the same way that beer might be.\n\nMLS: Why do you think this show in particular is worth seeing?"
