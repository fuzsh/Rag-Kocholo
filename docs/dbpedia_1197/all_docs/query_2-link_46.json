        "text": "'Bad Blood' is a protest song to help build awareness about the public Infected Blood Inquiry. It highlights government negligence surrounding the blood scandal of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nSamantha's brother has a rare blotting disorder called haemophilia. Back in the early 1980s, Tim, and many others like him, were given a regular blood treatment... an injection of a substance called Factor VIII that was contaminated with HIV and Hepatitus C. Many men and young boys died, and are still dying to this day, as a result of it.\n\nThere is an ongoing public inquiry presenting a huge amount of evidence showing that the government were aware of the dangers at the time, but still ignored the facts, and continued with the supply chains for this deadly treatment for years afterwards, primarily to save money. During which time, many more haemophiliacs died of Aids and Hep C who simply shouldn't have. Many who were infected with HIV were not even told they had it and some children were tested on without parental consent.\n\nIt is a truly shocking scandal on a huge scale. Thirty years on and government officials still won't admit any responsibility, and have destroyed lots of evidence trying to cover it up.\n\nWe all know the power of songs... Samantha and her co-writer, David Annis hope you will help break the silence by sharing this protest song on social media, and by listening to it on spotify to raise funds for both The Haemophilia Society charity, and non-profit organisation, Factor 8, who are core participants in the inquiry, and advocates on behalf of the victims and their families."
