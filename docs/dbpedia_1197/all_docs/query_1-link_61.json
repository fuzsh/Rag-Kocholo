        "text": "Dr. David P. Robbins, a mathematician who broke codes and cryptological problems for the government and devised an algebraic formula that became widely recognized in the mathematical world, died on Sept. 4 at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 61.\n\nThe cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.\n\nAs a mathematician with the Institute for Defense Analyses, which provides research to the Defense Department, Dr. Robbins worked on making and breaking codes. Many of the codes and problems he deciphered were deemed intractable by the National Security Agency, and his solutions often earned him awards from the government.\n\nMuch of that work remains classified and has never been described to the public. But in 1996, he received the security agency's Exceptional Service Medal for his contributions to national security, an honor rarely bestowed.\n\n''He would frequently come up with new ways of solving complex mathematical equations,'' said Dr. David Lieberman, former director of the institute's Center for Communications Research. ''There were a lot of projects where the N.S.A. would anticipate spending millions of dollars and David would come up with a way of solving it for only thousands. Then he would teach others how to use those same methods he came up with.''\n\nDavid Peter Robbins was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 12, 1942. He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard and his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He taught at Phillips Exeter Academy and at Washington and Lee University, among others, before joining the defense institute in 1980.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Deborah; a son, Matthew Eli, of Princeton; his stepmother, Sheila Robbins of New York; two sisters, Marjorie Robbins Friedlander of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Ann Aknin of Dana Point, Calif.; a half brother, Peter Robbins of New York; a stepbrother, Thomas Hardy of Worcester, Mass.; and two stepsisters, Barbara Morgan of Sayreville, N.J., and Meredith Hardy of Palm Desert, Calif.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
