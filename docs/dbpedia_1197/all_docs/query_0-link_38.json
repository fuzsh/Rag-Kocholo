        "text": "An American singer, songwriter, music publisher, and NASCAR driver, Marty Robbins was one of the most popular country music performers in the 1950s through 1980s.\n\nMartin David Robinson was born on September 26, 1925, in a shack in the desert outside Glendale, Arizona, then an agricultural outlier of Phoenix. The sixth of nine children in a nomadic family, he learned early to fend for himself. The family lived a hardscrabble life and relied on public assistance. Robinson, throughout his life, was torn between extreme shyness and a craving for attention and appreciation. He became the class clown in school, and he enjoyed entertaining his fellow students with his singing and harmonica playing.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nRobinson enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II. His combat service in the South Pacific included delivering U.S. Marines ashore during the invasion of the Solomon Islands on November 1, 1943. He was the ramp operator on a landing craft (LCM) that participated in the first and third invasion waves. When the surf smashed the LCM, the crew was stranded on Bougainville Island.\n\nWhile in the service, Robbins took up the guitar. After the war, Robinson returned to Phoenix and pursued a singing career, playing in a downtown supper club and modeling his repertoire after a favorite performer, the singing cowboy Gene Autry. Taking the suggestion of a friend to change his name to Marty Robbins, he was hosting a show on KPHO-TV when Grand Ole Opry star Little Jimmy Dickens came to Phoenix. Dickens recommended him to Columbia Records for a contract, and Robbins moved to Nashville and the Grand Ole Opry in 1953. He and wife Marizona raised their children, Ronny and Janet, there.\n\nSoon bearing the nickname “Mr. Teardrop” for his emotive performances, Marty Robbins placed 94 songs on Billboard’s Country Singles charts in a thirty-year career, four of them after his death. Beginning with the autobiographical \"I’ll Go On Alone\" in 1953, sixteen songs topped the charts. They included “Singing the Blues,” which held the number one spot for 13 weeks in 1956, and “A White Sport Coat (and a Pink Carnation)” in 1957. His Hawaiian songs, rockabilly hits, teen ballads, gunfighter ballads, pop standards, and dozens of songs of various tempos showcased his versatility. He starred in western, country music, and car racing movies and hosted television shows, including The Marty Robbins Spotlight.\n\nRobbins was extraordinarily versatile, but Western songs were his favorite music. His most famous album, Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs, was released in 1959 and remains popular today. His signature song, “El Paso,” entered 1960 as the number one single on both the country (7 weeks) and pop (2 weeks) charts for Billboard. At 4:40 in length, the song far exceeded the usual 2:30–2:50 time of most pop and country recordings of the day, but that did not deter radio disk jockeys from keeping the song on heavy play for months after its release, Drawing on both the Mexican corrido tradition and the Western ballad, it has long since entered the country music canon. When asked in 1982 how many times he had sung the song, he replied, “Tell me how many personal appearances I’ve made since 1959, and then I will know.”\n\nHe received two Grammy awards, the first in 1960 for “El Paso” and another in 1970 for “My Woman, My Woman, My Wife.” He was honored with the first Man of the Decade Award from the Academy of Country Music (ACM) in 1970. (The award was renamed Artist of the Decade when presented to Loretta Lynn ten years later.)\n\nRobbins wrote most of his own music and placed the songs in his publishing companies. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1975. On October 11, 1982, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Two months later, on December 8, 1982, his fourth heart attack took his life at age 57. He died in Nashville, Tennessee."
