        "text": "Tall and soft spoken, Robert Moore possesses a sincerity and courtesy reflective of his Idaho farm upbringing. Robert was born in1957 in Burley, Idaho. He was raised near the Snake River which sparked his appreciation for nature. He is a contemplative, quiet individual. At a young age, he discovered art as a way to freely express his feelings. His practical background and belief in discipline led him to earn a Bachelor of Science degree with teaching credentials in art from Eastern Oregon State.\n\nRobert prefers painting on location to best express the immediate impression of each subject. His use of vivid colors and frequent high-key values reveal a spiritually inspired joy. His travels have taken him to China, Europe, Canada, and extensively throughout the United States.\n\nRobert has been profiled in numerous magazine articles including Western Art Collector, Southwest Art, Wild life Art, Big Sky Journal, and Art of the West. Robert Moore was selected in 2012 to receive the Governorâ€™s Award for the state of Idaho for Excellence in the Arts."
