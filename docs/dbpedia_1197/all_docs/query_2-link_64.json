a carnival for carnivores and saboteurs while you’re still fighting the last war you’ll die fighting the last war armed with lip service, self parody usual business, fake sincerity under siege in your secret city choking on slow motion remedies poison courses trojan horsemen open doors while you’re still fighting the last war you’ll die fighting the last war a carnival for carnivores and saboteurs while you’re still fighting the last war for how long? what’s the past for if it looks you in the eye but the lessons pass you by when your task force fails the crash course console yourself you tried but i wanna do better than survive a carnival for carnivores and saboteurs while you’re still fighting the last war for how long?
