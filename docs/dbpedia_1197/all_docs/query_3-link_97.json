        "text": "A discussion of art and entertainment and their conflictual relationship\n\nA regular contributor to magazines such as “Real Life” (in the 1980s), “Purple Prose” (in the 1990s), and “Artforum,” David Robbins is one of the first to investigate the art world’s entrance into the culture industry. His work as much as his writings bear witness to reflections on the spectacle, the transformation of the position of the artist in the visual system, and the future role of the spectator in art.\n\nThe publication also brings together his key interviews with Richard Prince or Allan McCollum, his writings on television, Hollywood, and Warhol, and contributions to his “Institute for Advanced Comedic Behavior.”\n\nThe book is part of the Positions series, co-published with Les Presses du réel and dedicated to artists’ writings."
