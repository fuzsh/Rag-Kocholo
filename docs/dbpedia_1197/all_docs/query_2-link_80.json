By awarding two $2500 grants to musicians actively performing contemporary music, we can support the projects that will contribute to their professional development. This financial support can allow artists to secure live performance opportunities, recording/studio time, produce music video content, and develop marketing assets and/or strategies. In addition to the financial support, The Music Hall team will help make valuable connections with industry professionals for grant recipients.\n\nEven more exciting, the two musicians selected will both be invited to open for Jason Mraz at this year’s Emerging Artist Benefit Concert!!!\n\nEligibility\n\nSubmissions are currently limited to individuals or duos who are:\n\nActively performing contemporary music\n\nNot signed to a major label or a major booking agency\n\nA current resident of a New England state, or has 5+ years of previous residency in New England.\n\nAt least 18 years of age, or has written consent from parent/guardian.\n\nLegally able to receive taxable income in the United States.\n\nCriteria for Selection\n\nAll applications are reviewed and evaluated by The Music Hall’s Emerging Artist committee, comprised of Music Hall employees, board members, and select members chosen by the curatorial team.\n\nApplications are evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\nQuality of the artist’s creative works submitted\n\nLevel of alignment with the vision of The Music Hall’s Emerging Artist Series\n\nFeasibility of the proposed project within the parameters of the grant\n\nApplication Process\n\nSubmissions for this year’s emerging artist grant have closed.\n\nReporting\n\nThe Music Hall requests that grant recipients share the impact of the award.\n\nAccessibility\n\nNo person on the basis of race, color, national origin or ancestry, native language, disability, age, religion (creed), gender or gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or military status shall be excluded from participation in, or be denied benefits of, or otherwise be subject to discrimination of services, programs and employment provided by The Music Hall."
