        "text": "Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho explained why Real Madrid are so dominant in the Champions League.\n\nEx-Roma boss Jose Mourinho explained that Real Madrid’s malleability is why they are European champions for a record 15th time, as they are not enslaved by a specific football philosophy.\n\nMourinho was himself a former Real Madrid coach, and he led them to a historic LALIGA triumph when they became the first team in the Spanish top-flight to cross the 100-point mark; however, the Champions League remained elusive across Jose’s three-year stint at the club.\n\nReal Madrid are champions again\n\nLos Blancos defeated Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in Wembley to lift their 15th Champions League title, eight more than the next best, AC Milan, with seven.\n\nLos Merengues have been incredibly dominant in terms of winning competition; however, on the field of play, they are comfortable with playing on the backfoot.\n\nMourinho highlighted this quality, explaining that Real Madrid fans will not care that they allowed Manchester City to have all the ball in favour of counterattacks, nor will they lose sleep over their team's less than glamorous first half performance against Dortmund, as the end, for Madrid faithfuls, justifies the means.\n\nJose believes that the quality of not being tethered to a playing philosophy is responsible for their unparalleled success in the competition.\n\n“This is Real Madrid. They can be humble,” Mourinho said on the TNT Sports broadcast of the Champions League final, per Sean Gillen.\n\n“Ask Real Madrid fans if they were unhappy to change their philosophy against Man City. Ask them if they’re unhappy that they got dominated first half. Ask them. They don’t sell philosophies. They put cups in the office.”\n\nMeanwhile, Mourinho believes that Ten Hag's inability to get the best out of Jadon Sancho contributed to the winger's failings at Manchester United.\n\nRelated content"
