        "text": "A headline member of the midfield ranks at La Liga giants Real Madrid has on Friday secured for himself a prestigious individual accolade.\n\nThe player in question? Federico Valverde.\n\nUruguayan international Valverde, for his part, is fresh off another stellar performance on the continent in midweek.\n\nEn route to Real Madrid’s eventual 3-3 stalemate with Manchester City in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, the 25-year-old shone on both sides of the ball, a relentless source of drive and quality.\n\nNot only that, but Valverde proved himself decisive on the scoresheet, too.\n\nWith his side trailing by three goals to two late in proceedings at the Santiago Bernabéu, the all-action midfielder connected with Vinícius Jr’s clever cross to direct a stunning volley into the far corner of the visitors’ net.\n\nThis proved the key goal in ensuring that Carlo Ancelotti’s troops will not head to Manchester facing a deficit when it comes to the tie.\n\nAnd, as alluded to above, on Friday, such exploits on Valverde’s part have been aptly recognised.\n\nAs confirmed in a statement across the official social media platforms of the UEFA Champions League, the Real Madrid star has secured the award for Goal of the Week in the competition:\n\nConor Laird | GSFN"
