        "text": "Real Madrid star Brahim Díaz has this afternoon seen his recent efforts in the club’s colours aptly recognised.\n\nThis comes amid confirmation of the Spaniard receiving his award for the February Player of the Month in Carlo Ancelotti’s squad.\n\nBrahim, for his part, lined out for Los Blancos on six occasions last month, four of which came from the off.\n\nAnd, across this stretch, he notched a pair of goals, including, most notably, a stunning individual effort en route to his side’s Champions League Last-16 first-leg downing of RB Leipzig.\n\nHis other strike, meanwhile, ensured that Real departed the latest edition of the Madrid Derby with a share of the spoils.\n\nGoals aside, though, the 24-year-old’s all-round contribution to boss Ancelotti’s ranks has long been of the highest standard.\n\nLooking a player reborn since his return to Spain’s capital from Italian giants AC Milan, Brahim has added a whole new element of guile and unpredictability to Real’s ranks in the final third.\n\nIn turn, after confirmation of his POTM status was confirmed two weeks ago, he has on Wednesday officially secured his prize for February.\n\nThis comes as the Spaniard’s 2nd since returning to the Santiago Bernabéu, after he was also voted Los Merengues’ best player in December.\n\nConor Laird | GSFN"
