        "text": "Another year has passed and another Ballon d'Or is in the bag for Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThe Real Madrid star has swept up football's individual honours once again after helping his club to yet another Champions League title during the 2016-17 season.\n\nHe is off to a strong start in 2017-18, too, scoring a remarkable nine goals in his first six European games this term.\n\nGoal has teamed up with Google Trends to answer the questions you're asking about the 32-year-old as 2018 approaches.\n\n1. HOW MANY BALLONS D'OR HAS RONALDO WON?\n\nRonaldo has won the Ballon d'Or five times, tying Lionel Messi for the record number of wins by claiming the 2017 prize.\n\nHe has dominated the award of late, winning four of the past five, and has also won the Men's Player of the Year gong at The Best FIFA Football Awards in both years since that honour's inception in 2016.\n\nRonaldo and Messi were the first players to win the Ballon d'Or four times, and now they sit at least two ahead of everyone else in history.\n\n2. HOW MANY GOALS HAS RONALDO SCORED?\n\nAt the time of writing, Ronaldo has scored 544 club goals and 79 international goals for a total of 623 in 886 games.\n\nIn the club game, the bulk of his goals - 421 - have been scored for Real Madrid, with 118 for United and just five for Sporting before he was snapped up by the Red Devils.\n\nThough completely accurate historical records are hard to find, we do know that Ronaldo is the all-time top goalscorer in Europe's top-five leagues (England, Spain, Italy, France and Germany).\n\nHe has won the European Golden Shoe four times, the Premier League Golden Boot once and the Pichichi Trophy for the top scorer in La Liga on three occasions.\n\n3. HOW MUCH IS RONALDO WORTH?\n\nRonaldo's net worth is estimated to be somewhere in the range of £200 million to £250m.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Ronaldo earned more than any other athlete on the planet in 2016 at $88m (£72m). He placed joint-fourth on their list of the top 100 celebrities behind singer Taylor Swift, band One Direction (who were counted together as a group) and author James Patterson.\n\nMessi placed eighth, on $81.5m (£67m), and LeBron James was 11th at $77m (£63m).\n\nWhen Ronaldo's accounts were published amid the controversy over his tax affairs, they revealed an income of over £190m before tax in 2015. Twenty million of that was made in Spain, which lines up with reports of a £365,000-a-week wage at Real Madrid.\n\n4. HOW OLD IS RONALDO?\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985 in Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira and is currently 32 years old.\n\n5. WHO IS BETTER: MESSI OR RONALDO?\n\nThat's a matter of opinion.\n\nRight now, Ronaldo and Madrid are enjoying as much success as ever having won back-to-back Champions League titles and he has bagged four of the past five Ballons d'Or.\n\nHis latest triumph saw him draw level with Messi by winning the Ballon d'Or for a fifth time overall.\n\nThe argument for Messi stems from the fact that his goalscoring record is better than Ronaldo's - Messi has 536 goals in 638 club games while Ronaldo has 544 in 739 - and he is, most would agree, a more creative and visionary player.\n\nBut Ronaldo did not have the luxury of coming through the system at Barcelona or playing in the magical Pep Guardiola team that dominated European football.\n\nThe fact that Ronaldo has now matched Messi for Champions League wins despite that and also landed a major international honour in the European Championship - despite Portugal being a much smaller country than Argentina - has led many to claim that his is the more impressive career.\n\n6. WHO DOES RONALDO PLAY FOR?\n\nRonaldo plays for Real Madrid and Portugal.\n\nHe joined Madrid from Manchester United in 2009 in a deal said to have been worth €94m (then £80m), which was a world record at the time.\n\nRonaldo has since made nearly 400 appearances in all competitions for Madrid, scoring at better than a goal-per-game rate, and has won La Liga twice and the Champions League three times.\n\nAt United, he won three Premier League titles and his first Champions League having joined the club from Portuguese side Sporting, where he came through the youth ranks, in 2003.\n\nRonaldo has won 143 caps for Portugal at the time of writing, scoring 75 goals and winning the European Championship in 2016.\n\n7. HOW MANY KIDS DOES RONALDO HAVE?\n\nRonaldo has quadrupled his number of children in half a year.\n\nAlready the father to Cristiano Jr. (pictured above), he welcomed twins Eva Maria and Mateo - reportedly born to a surrogate mother - in June.\n\nThen, in December, his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez (also pictured above) gave birth to his second daughter, named Alana Martina.\n\n8. HOW MUCH DOES RONALDO MAKE A WEEK?\n\nRonaldo is reported to make £365,000 a week at Madrid, which brings his annual salary up to around £19m. That contract will run until 2021.\n\nHe makes much more than that overall, though, when his endorsements and business ventures are added into the equation. Forbes say he earned £72m in 2016 - more than any other athlete on the planet.\n\n9. HOW MANY TROPHIES HAS RONALDO WON?\n\nA lot.\n\nIn total, for club and country, Ronaldo has won 24 team honours in his career so far. He will be hoping to make it 25 at this month's Club World Cup (which he has already won three times).\n\nRonaldo won three Premier League titles with Manchester United and has claimed two with Real Madrid. He has won the Champions League four times, three of which came in Spain.\n\nThe first trophy Ronaldo won was the Supertaca Candido de Oliveira - the Portuguese Super Cup - with Sporting back in 2002.\n\n10. HOW DO I DRAW CRISTIANO RONALDO?\n\nThis one is a bit beyond us, but here's a useful guide for starters.\n\nJust make sure it turns out better than this."
