        "text": "Darrell James\n\nFootball 8/7/2024 2:02:00 PM Kane McGuire\n\nCrosby Named to Comeback Player of the Year Award Watch List\n\nOne of 89 nominated players for the award\n\nRUSTON â€“ Marquis Crosby was one of 89 college football student-athletes from 67 different schools to be named to the 2024 Comeback Player of the Year Award Watch List, as announced by the College Sports Communicators in association with The Associated Press and the Fiesta Bowl Organization.\n\nThis news comes one day after Crosby was also named to the 2024 Doak Walker Award Watch List, which was announced by the PwC SMU Athletic Forum.\n\nCrosby, a running back from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, missed almost the entire 2023 season due to injury with his lone action coming at UTEP.\n\nThe redshirt junior looks to get back to his 2022 form, a season that saw him make 10 starts in the backfield while rushing for a team-high 918 yards to go along with nine rushing touchdowns (three games of multiple TDs).\n\nHe tallied four 100+ rushing games that season, highlighted by a 197-yard rushing performance during the Bulldogs 52-17 win over Stephen F. Austin.\n\nSince 2018, the award has recognized college football student-athletes for overcoming injury, illness, or other circumstances. At the conclusion of each season, in a vote by a panel of college football writers, editors, and sports information directors, three college football student-athletes are honored as Comeback Player of the Year Award winners at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl.\n\nSUPPORT LA TECH ATHLETICS\n\nChampionships require championship resources.
