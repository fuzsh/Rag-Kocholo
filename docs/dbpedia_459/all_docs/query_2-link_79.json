        "text": "Despite boasting an incredible 17 European Cups between them, fixtures pitting the two clubs against each other remain a relatively rare occurrence.\n\nThe Reds currently lead the head-to-head record, with three victories to Real's two, and we are guaranteed to have another outright winner in the Ukrainian capital on Saturday night.\n\nTake a look back at the sides' five previous clashes below.\n\nBenzema bags Bernabeu winner\n\nLiverpool's last appearance in the Champions League threw up a glamorous group-stage meeting with the competition's most successful team.\n\nBut, with Brendan Rodgers' side having endured a poor start to the Premier League season and an Anfield clash with league leaders Chelsea on the horizon, the boss made seven changes to his starting XI for this trip to Spain.\n\nIn the absence of rested captain Steven Gerrard, the Reds produced a battling performance in the Santiago Bernabeu but were ultimately undone by Karim Benzema's early tap-in.\n\nRodgers' decision to make changes in Europe came under further scrutiny when his team suffered a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea four days later, while their Champions League hopes were subsequently ended by disappointing draws with Ludogorets Razgrad and Basel.\n\nAnfield silenced on Champions League return\n\nLiverpool endured a chastening reminder of the standards expected in Europe's premier club competition as they went down to a disappointing Anfield defeat in the third group-stage fixture of their return to the tournament.\n\nThe Reds had beaten Ludogorets at home and suffered defeat away at Basel ahead of this hotly-anticipated game, but failed to strengthen their bid for a place in the knockout rounds.\n\nA Benzema brace followed Cristiano Ronaldo's opener as Carlo Ancelotti's team took a 3-0 lead into half-time and, though the hosts rallied after the break, they rarely threatened to produce a comeback.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho hit the post from distance as the second half wore on, but Rodgers' team were well beaten by their Spanish opponents.\n\nReal ripped apart in Round of 16\n\nOne of Anfield's most famous evenings saw a star-studded Real Madrid team ruthlessly ripped apart as Rafael Benitez's Reds marched onto the quarter-finals.\n\nThe opening goal typified the hosts' greater desire on the night as Fernando Torres hassled Pepe into surrendering possession before poking Dirk Kuyt's subsequent cross home with just 16 minutes gone.\n\nGerrard doubled the lead from the penalty spot soon after, and the captain made it three in the second half as he brilliantly controlled Ryan Babel's centre into the top corner.\n\nAndrea Dossena then capped an unforgettable week on a personal level as he followed up the fourth goal in a 4-1 away win over Manchester United by consigning Real to a similarly crushing defeat.\n\nYossi wins it after Benitez tactical masterclass\n\nThe foundations for another run into the latter stages of the Champions League were laid in this trademark Benitez away win at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nLiverpool spent 90 minutes frustrating an attack featuring Gonzalo Higuain, Raul and Arjen Robben before netting late on through Yossi Benayoun.\n\nHardly renowned for his heading ability, the Israeli forward rose highest to nod home Fabio Aurelio's 82nd-minute free-kick to hand the Reds an important away goal.\n\nThat the visitors could only call on talismanic skipper Gerrard for the final two minutes of the game following his recent return from a hamstring injury made the victory all the more impressive.\n\nKennedy clinches the cup in Paris\n\nThe first ever meeting between the two teams came in the biggest fixture of them all - the European Cup final.\n\nThe Reds were aiming to lift the trophy for a third time in just five years, while Real were targeting their first victory since the club's early dominance of the tournament was capped with a sixth win back in 1966.\n\nUnusually for an era where teams were largely comprised of homegrown players, Real counted an English superstar among their number in Laurie Cunningham.\n\nHowever, the former West Bromwich Albion winger was shackled throughout by Phil Neal, while the full-back on the other side of the pitch, Alan Kennedy, popped up with the winner eight minutes from the end of normal time.\n\nIn overseeing this victory, Bob Paisley became the first manager to win three European Cups - a feat that has only been matched since by Carlo Ancelotti."
