He retired in 2017 as the most-capped player in Roma’s history. However, his post-retirement life hasn’t gone as he would have predicted. Totti became the club director of Roma after his retirement. But, two years later, he resigned from the position accusing the then-club management of not involving him in the club’s decision-making.\n\nEarlier this year, Totti separated from Ilary Blasi after 17 years of marriage. The couple was reportedly involved in ‘The War of the Wardrobe’ as they stole each other’s belongings. Totti and Blasi’s divorce has been an ugly one, with allegations of cheating and mental health issues.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRoma legend Francesco Totti married TV personality Ilary Blasi in 2005.

I hid the bags, hoping for an exchange,” Corriere della Sera reported. “All she has to do is return the watches, and this is over.”\n\nHowever, according to a recent NY Times report, Ms. Blasi has managed to recover the handbags. Totti reportedly stole his wife’s handbag collection from Dior, Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Chanel. He also raided her Jimmy Choo, Amina Muaddi, Le Silla, Casadei, and Gucci shoe collections.\n\nTotti and Blasi still share a villa together.
