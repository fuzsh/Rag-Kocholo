        "text": "HOPEWELL, Va. (WWBT/Gray News) - A Virginia high school community is grieving after a 15-year-old junior varsity football player died after collapsing at practice.\n\nA Hopewell High School student, who was reportedly named Jayvion Taylor, collapsed at football practice Monday evening while his team took a water break after about 40 minutes of drills, WWBT reports.\n\nTwo coaches attempted CPR before paramedics arrived and took the teenager to the hospital. He did not survive.\n\nGrieving friends of the 15-year-old embraced each other on the field Tuesday. They say he was positive, funny and someone who was always there for his friends.\n\nThe high school said in a statement: “He was the most genuine and remarkable student” and that he was “a light to all who met him.”\n\nEven the Virginia Tech football team paid its respects on X.\n\nHowever, one school employee, who asked to remain anonymous, says the school hasn’t had an athletic trainer since last school year. A trainer, they say, would be better qualified for handling situations like this.\n\n“That comfort of having a trained medical professional on site, just in case anything were to happen, was always there. But then, they cut the trainer,” the employee said.\n\nAccording to the school, a contract for athletic services begins Aug. 12. However, the job posting for an athletic trainer from July 29 is still on their website.\n\nThe employee says no school staff member ever wants to experience this.\n\n“This is our worst nightmare,” they said. “I’m not saying having a trainer would have saved that young man’s life, but I feel like it would have at least definitely given us a better fighting chance.”\n\nNow, the employee is calling on accountability from the school.\n\n“Some people need to be held responsible,” they said.\n\nThe high school was closed Tuesday because of issues with its air conditioning, but it was offering grief counseling to staff and students. It will be open Wednesday and offer those same services."
