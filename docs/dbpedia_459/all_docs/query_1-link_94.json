        "text": "Bayer Leverkusen are enjoying the greatest success of their 120-year history right now, and will prove to be stern opponents for us when we face off at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nAhead of the game, get prepared for their visit by swotting up on the German giants’ past and present, as they look towards a glittering future with Xabi Alonson at the helm:\n\nThe history\n\nThe club were founded in 1904 by employees of the pharmaceutical company Bayer which is based in the city. Over the next 30 years they gradually worked their way up from the fourth tier to the second, and in the 1950s they spent five years at the highest level. They first competed in the new national Bundesliga in 1979/80, where they have remained ever since.\n\nIn 1988, they secured the first major trophy by lifting the UEFA Cup after an incredible second-leg comeback against Espanyol, and the German Cup followed in 1993. They were labelled “Neverkusen” around the turn of the millennium as they finished runners-up four times, lost the league title on the final day in 2000, and then ended the 2001/02 campaign empty-handed when on course for a Treble that included a Champions League final loss to Real Madrid.\n\nHowever, after a 20-year period of little success except for regular Champions League qualification, Alonso’s arrival has revolutionised Leverkusen. He guided them to a first league title last term, and completed a domestic double by also lifting the German Cup to claim their first pieces of silverware for 31 years.\n\nThe stadium\n\nTheir home is the BayArena, and has been since 1958. Originally called the Ulrich Haberland Stadium after a former club president, it started with a capacity of 20,000 before it was redeveloped in the 1990s and became the nation’s first all-seater stadium.\n\nThat was also when it got its current name, and further improvements in the late 2000s saw the capacity increase to its current total of 30,200. It hosted matches in the 2011 Women’s World Cup and has been selected to be the home of German national team fixtures from time to time.\n\nThe manager\n\nAlonso has quickly enjoyed similar success in the dugout to his playing career, which saw him start at hometown club Real Sociedad. He won the Champions League with both Liverpool and Real Madrid, and as well as lifting La Liga once, he won three Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich. Then midfielder was a key part of the Spain squad that won European Championships either side of the 2010 World Cup.\n\nHe ended his playing days in 2017 and after coaching at Real Madrid’s academy, he was handed the reins of Sociedad’s B team. He won promotion to the second tier for the first time since 1962, but couldn’t prevent relegation after one season at that level.\n\nAlonso arrived at Leverkusen in October 2022 who were suffering their worst start since 1979, but a sixth-place finish was achieved as well as a run to the Europa League semi-finals, but that was just the start of something special.\n\nLast season\n\nThe 2023/24 campaign was the greatest in Leverkusen’s history, as they won their first-ever league title, remaining undefeated in their 34 matches by winning 28 and drawing six to finish 17 points clear at the top.\n\nThey broke a European record by going 51 matches unbeaten in all competitions during a single campaign, which ended when they lost to Atalanta in the Europa League final. However they bounced back by claiming the German Cup to complete an undefeated domestic double.\n\nThe squad\n\nThe crown jewel in the Leverkusen squad is Florian Wirtz, who was named Bundesliga Player of the Season last term. The 21-year-old registered 18 goals and 20 assists in all competitions and was a key player for Germany at a home European Championships last summer.\n\nDefender Jonathan Tah and midfielder Robert Andrich joined him in that squad, while Alejandro Grimaldo won the competition with Spain and hit double figures for Bundesliga goals from left-back. Fellow wing-back Jeremie Frimpong was part of the Dutch side in the tournament, while goalkeeper Matej Kovar featured for the Czech Republic.\n\nHe was Leverkusen’s cup keeper last term, while Finish international Lukas Hradecky is the usual number one. Nigerian striker Victor Boniface finished top scorer last term with 21 goals in 34 games, and then there’s Granit Xhaka, who needs no introduction to our supporters, who played in 50 of the 53 games last term.\n\nThe summer so far\n\nAlonso has strengthened his ranks by bringing in three new faces so far. Teenage centre-back Jeanuel Belocian has arrived from Rennes for £12.9 million despite only playing 53 senior club games, before Leverkusen returned to the French side to prise away forward Martin Terrier [above] for £17.2 million.\n\nFormer Manchester City midfielder Aleix Garcia has also been acquired from Girona for £15.5 million, but defender Josip Stanisic has returned to Bayern Munich after his loan deal ended.\n\nPre-season has seen them beat third-tier side Rot-Weiss Essen 2-1 thanks to goals from former Southampton winger Nathan Tella and Czech striker Patrik Schick, before Terrier and Wirtz found the net in a 2-2 draw against Lens last Saturday.\n\nThe previous meetings\n\nWe have only played Leverkusen twice in competitive action before, which came in the Champions League back in February 2002. We drew 1-1 at the BayArena after a last-minute Ulf Kirsten goal cancelled out Robert Pires’ opener after Ray Parlour was sent off, then a week later, we ran rampant at Highbury by cruising to a 4-1 victory.\n\nPires and Thierry Henry netted in the first seven minutes, before Patrick Vieira and Dennis Bergkamp added further goals to the scoreline in the second half to put us on the brink of the quarter-finals.\n\nHow to watch\n\nTickets for the game have sold out, but you can watch all the action live on Arsenal.com and the official app by purchasing a Match Pass.\n\nCoverage starts an hour before kick-off, and provides the best possible build-up throughout the evening as our preparations for the new season ramp up with the big kick-off just a week and a half away!"
