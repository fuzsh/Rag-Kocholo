        "text": "On Tuesday Real Madrid confirmed that winger Vinicius Jr had signed a contract extension that will now keep him at the club until the summer of 2027. “It was a dream to come this far,” said the Brazil international in a press statement. “It's very difficult to get here, but it's even harder to stay here. Being able to stay here for so many years is an honour.” Since making the move to LaLiga, Vinicius Jr has won no less than nine major trophies and undoubtedly cemented his place in Carlo Ancelotti’s side as one of the club’s most important players. However, that success in the Spanish capital was far from assured when he first made the move from Brazil and over the course of the last five years the young winger has had to work remarkably hard to become the star that he is today.\n\nHow much has Vinicius Jr’s market value improved at Real Madrid?\n\nVinicius Jr made the move to Madrid in July 2018, when the Spanish giants signed the winger from Flamengo in a deal worth €45 million. Upon arriving at the club, the Brazilian talent had a market value of €35m, which quickly jumped to €70m by the end of his first season at the club. However, over the course of the next two years the forward’s form and standing at Los Blancos was far from consistent and in turn his market value dropped down to €45m and hovered around that mark until the start of the 21/22 season. And then things took a dramatic change for the young player.\n\nNaturally, winning the Champions League that season had a profound impact on the player and the club as a whole. Vinicius Jr’s role in that continental success was evident for all to see and in return his market value began to steadily rise at Madrid. Since then, the winger’s market value has risen from €50m to where it now stands at an impressive €150m. Not only does that now make Vinicius Jr the most valuable player in LaLiga and the joint third most valuable player in the world, but it also points to a 275% increase in value since 2021 - the highest increase in market value for any player in Spanish football in that period.\n\nHow Vinicius Jr became such an important player for Real Madrid\n\nAlthough the young winger made the move to Madrid in 2018, it was the 21/22 season that really projected Vinicius Jr into the limelight and where many now consider him to be among some of the best players in the world. A tremendous start to the LaLiga campaign saw the winger bag no less than five goals and three assists in his first six league games and he more or less never slowed down, bagging in total 22 goals and 20 assists in 52 games across all competitions.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most pivotal performances came in the Champions League, where Vinicius Jr picked up two goals and three assists in the knock-out rounds. Most notable of which was his goal in the final against Liverpool, which won Madrid their fourteenth Champions League trophy and the player his first major European title. And since then the Madrid star has gone from strength to strength. So much so that since the start of the 21/22 season Vinicius Jr has bagged 53 goals and assists in 76 games. A remarkable tally that has been bested by only five players across Europe’s top leagues in that time."
