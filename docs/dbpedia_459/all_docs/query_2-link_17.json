        "text": "1990/91 - 1991/92\n\nThe 1990/91 season started well for Real Madrid as they won the Supercopa de España, defeating FC Barcelona 5-1. However, their form in La Liga was inconsistent, and they finished the season in third place, 10 points behind champions Barcelona. Their only other trophy of the season came in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, where they defeated Austria Vienna in the final.\n\nThe jerseys in 1990/91 were manufactured by Hummel, the club's kit supplier since 1985. The purple details on the home kit marked a departure from the traditional all-white Real Madrid kit, but they were a popular addition with the fans.\n\nThe 1991 /92 season was also a disappointing one for Real Madrid. Radomir Antić, the club's manager, was sacked in January 1992 and replaced by Leo Beenhakker.\n\nBeenhakker was able to improve Real Madrid's form, and they finished the season in second place, just two points behind Barcelona. However, they were unable to win the Copa del Rey, losing 2-1 to Atlético Madrid in the final.\n\n1992/93\n\nThe 1992 /93 season was a mixed bag for Real Madrid. They won the Copa del Rey, but they finished second in La Liga and were knocked out of the UEFA Cup in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe season started well for Real Madrid as they won their first three La Liga games. However, they then went on a bad run of form, losing four of their next five games. Benito Floro, the club's manager, was sacked in December 1992 and replaced by Jorge Valdano.\n\nValdano was able to improve Real Madrid's form, and they finished the season in second place, just two points behind Barcelona. They also won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Zaragoza 2-0 in the final. However, they were knocked out of the UEFA Cup in the quarter-finals by Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThe club jerseys were made by Hummel again in 1992/93. The home jersey added a collar this year and kept purple accents like the previous home kit. The away jersey was blue and had the same collar as the home, with a sublimated pattern.\n\n1993/94\n\nIn the 1993/94 season, Real Madrid finished fourth in La Liga, marking their worst finish since 1980. They also failed to win the Copa del Rey or the European Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nHummel continued with the purple accents for the home jersey, featuring an updated purple button-up collar. The away kit from that season had a similar style to the home kit but used purple as the base colour with white accents.\n\n1994/95\n\nThe 1994 /95 season was a successful one for Real Madrid. They won La Liga, marking their first league title in five years. They also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League.\n\nThe season started well for Real Madrid as they won their first four La Liga games. They then went on a poor run of form, losing three straight games in November 1994. However, they were able to recover and finish the season in first place, 10 points ahead of Barcelona.\n\nReal Madrid changed kit manufacturers for the first time since the 1980s in 1994, switching over to Kelme. The home jersey retained the classic white base with purple accents, featuring Kelme striping down the sleeves. The away jersey used different shades of purple and had a collar.\n\n1995/96\n\nIn the 1995 /96 season, Real Madrid had their worst league finish since 1976 /77, ending the season in sixth place in La Liga. They also failed to win the Copa del Rey or the UEFA Champions League.\n\nThe jerseys remained the same as the 1994 /96 season with purple and white bases and a collar. The club did noticeably use slightly altered versions of these shirts in the Champions League, however.\n\n1996/97\n\nThe 1996 /97 season was a successful one for Real Madrid. They won La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League, where they were knocked out by Borussia Dortmund.\n\nReal Madrid essentially kept the same home kit from the previous season with some very minor changes by Kelme. The away and third kits for this season featured wild purple and white patterns, making them two of the more iconic alternative kits in the club's history.\n\n1997/98\n\nThe 1997/98 season was a bittersweet one for Real Madrid. They failed to retain their La Liga title but made up for the domestic disappointment by winning the UEFA Champions League with a 1–0 victory over Juventus in the Amsterdam final. The European Cup title was Real Madrid's 7th overall and their first since 1966. Real Madrid finished the La Liga season in 4th place, 9 points behind champions Barcelona.\n\nThe Real Madrid jerseys in the 1997/98 season were manufactured by Kelme again, ditching the sleeve piping and opting for a fairly traditional home kit with purple accents on the sleeves and collar. The away shirt was a purple base with black and white accents on the sleeves and collar.\n\n1998/99\n\n1999/00\n\nReal Madrid won the UEFA Champions League for the eighth time in their history in 1999/00. They also reached the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey but finished fifth in La Liga.\n\nThe Champions League final was an all-Spanish affair, with Madrid facing Valencia at the Stade de France. It was a relatively comfortable final for Madrid, who won 3-0 thanks to goals from Morientes, McManaman, and Raul.\n\nIn the 1999/00 season, adidas kept the same home kit for Real Madrid and opted for a lighter blue away jersey and a black third kit with gold highlights, which was used in the Champions League.\n\n2000/01\n\nThe 2000–01 season was a successful one for Real Madrid as they won the La Liga title for the first time in four years. They also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League but were eliminated by Bayern Munich.\n\nReal Madrid started the season under new manager Vicente del Bosque, and they quickly established themselves as the favorites to win La Liga. They signed Luís Figo from Barcelona in the summer transfer window, and he quickly became one of the team's key players.\n\nReal Madrid finished the La Liga season in first place, five points ahead of Valencia. They scored 81 goals in the league, the most of any team. Raúl González was the team's top scorer with 24 goals.\n\nAdidas kept the same away and third kits for the 2000/01 season. They changed the home kit with blue and grey accents on the traditional white base, featuring a dark blue collar.\n\n2001/02\n\nIn 2001/02, Madrid signed Zinedine Zidane from Juventus in the summer transfer window. Zidane couldn't lead them to victory in the league this season; however, they did win the UEFA Champions League for the ninth time in their history. Real Madrid finished the La Liga season in third place, behind Valencia and Barcelona.\n\nAdidas simplified the Real Madrid jerseys for the 01/02 season with a plain white home kit, a black and white away kit, and a light blue and black third shirt used for European competitions.\n\n2002/03\n\nThe 2002–03 season was a successful one for Real Madrid as they won the La Liga title for the 29th time in their history. They also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League but were eliminated by Juventus. Ronaldo arrived from Inter Milan this season and had an immediate impact with 30 goals in all competitions.\n\nAdidas remained the kit manufacturer for the 2002/03 season with an all-white home kit, an all-black away kit, and an all-purple third kit without a collar.\n\n2003/04\n\nThe 2003/04 season was a disappointing one for Real Madrid. They finished fourth in La Liga and were eliminated from the Copa del Rey in the semi-finals and the UEFA Champions League in the quarter-finals. The arrivals of David Beckham and Michael Owen from the Premier League kept the fans excited in what was otherwise a poor season for Madrid.\n\nThe home kit for the 2003/04 season featured a white base with black accents and was sponsored by Siemens Mobile. The iconic 3-stripe branding ran down the sleeves of all three kits this season, with a dark blue away kit and a lighter blue third kit.\n\n2004/05\n\nThe 2004/05 season was a trophyless one for Real Madrid. They finished second in La Liga and were eliminated in the UEFA Champions League in the round of 16. Real Madrid were eliminated from the Copa del Rey in the quarter-finals by Real Zaragoza. They lost the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and they drew the second leg 1–1 in Zaragoza.\n\nThe home jersey for 04/05 was very similar to the season before but included a collar. The away jerseys were quite basic, with a plain black away kit and a blue third shirt.\n\n2005/06\n\nReal Madrid started the season under new manager Fabio Capello, and they were expected to challenge for the La Liga title. However, they were unable to match Barcelona's consistency, and they finished the season in second place, 12 points behind the champions. Ronaldo was again the club's top scorer.\n\nThe Real Madrid kits for the 2005/06 season kept the same template across all the jerseys. The home kit was white with black accents, the away kit was dark blue with white accents, and the third kit was grey with black accents.\n\n2006/07\n\nReal Madrid were back to winning ways in 06/07, winning La Liga for the first time in 4 seasons. They also reached the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League but were eliminated by Bayern Munich.\n\nReal Madrid finished the La Liga season in first place, six points ahead of Barcelona. They scored 66 goals in the league, which was the most of any team. Ruud van Nistelrooy was the team's top scorer with 25 goals.\n\nAdidas employed the iconic teamgeist template for Real Madrid this season across all three jerseys. The home jersey was white with the adidas logo moved centrally. The away and third kits were the same style in black and dark blue.\n\n2007/08\n\nReal Madrid won back-to-back La Liga titles in 07/08 for the first time since the 80s. The club failed to make an impact in domestic cup and European competitions, bowing out of the Copa del Rey and the Champions League in the round of 16.\n\nAdidas took inspiration from the Real Madrid shirts of the 90s for this season, with the home kit featuring purple accents again. The away jersey was dark blue with gold adidas branding, and the third kit was a black base with a bright green pattern.\n\n2008/09\n\nReal Madrid came back to the pack in 2008/09, finishing second in La Liga, behind Barcelona, and were eliminated from the Copa del Rey in the round of 16 and the UEFA Champions League in the round of 16.\n\nReal Madrid started the season under new manager Juande Ramos, and they were expected to challenge for the La Liga title. However, they were unable to match Barcelona's consistency, and they finished the season in second place, nine points behind the champions. Gonzalo Higuaín was the team's top scorer with 22 goals.\n\nThe Real Madrid jerseys in 2008/09 were sponsored by BWIN and again manufactured by adidas. The kits for this season reverted back to tradition with a white and black home kit, a dark blue away jersey, and a black third shirt.\n\n2009/10\n\nThe 2009/10 season was a transitional one for Real Madrid, but it was also a season of great promise. The club had signed Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká in the previous summer transfer window, and they were expected to challenge for all major trophies.\n\nReal Madrid started the season under new manager Manuel Pellegrini, and they made a strong start to the campaign. They won their first five La Liga matches, and they also beat FC Zurich and AC Milan in the UEFA Champions League group stage.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid's form dipped in the second half of the season, and they were unable to maintain their challenge for the La Liga title. They finished the season in second place for the second season in a row.\n\nAdidas made some slight adjustments to the home kit this season, adding some yellow accents and raising the collar. The away jersey for 2009/10 was dark blue with bright blue accents, and the third kit used a dark grey base.\n\n2010/11\n\nReal Madrid started the season under new manager José Mourinho, and he quickly made his mark on the team. However, Madrid finished 2nd again in La Liga for the 3rd season in a row, and frustrations were growing.\n\nReal Madrid finished the La Liga season in second place, four points behind champions Barcelona. However, they were able to beat Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final, thanks to a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThe home kit for Real Madrid in 2010/11 was a white base with deep blue accents and had the adidas badge moved back out to the right chest. The away and third kits were the same template as the home but in a black and purple colourway, respectively.\n\n2011/12\n\nThe 2011/12 season was a historic one for Real Madrid, as they won their 32nd La Liga title and set a number of league records. Real Madrid also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League but were eliminated by Bayern Munich. The team was managed by José Mourinho, who was in his second season at the club.\n\nThe Real Madrid home kit this season was a white base with gold trimming and a smart collar, with BWIN as the major kit sponsor for the 5th season in a row. The away kit was a black base with gold trimming, and the third kit was all red.\n\n2012/13\n\nIn the 2012/13 season, Real Madrid won the Supercopa de España but finished second in La Liga and were eliminated from the Copa del Rey in the quarter-finals and the UEFA Champions League in the semi-finals.\n\nReal Madrid started the season under José Mourinho, and they made a strong start to the campaign. They won their first five La Liga matches, and they also beat Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League group stage.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid's form dipped in the second half of the season, and they were unable to maintain their challenge for the La Liga title.
