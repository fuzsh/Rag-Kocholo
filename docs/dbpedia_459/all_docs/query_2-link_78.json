        "text": "Scottish Premiership club Motherwell once played Real Madrid in the final of the Copa del Rey and won.\n\nThe club had finished second in the Scottish top flight in the 1926/27 season when they were invited to a special post-season edition of the Spanish competition, along with Swansea City.\n\nBoth British clubs headed to Madrid for the exclusive competition, with the official version having been won by Real Union against Real Madrid that season.\n\nMotherwell would face fellow foreign guests Swansea in the semi-finals before heading to the final where they eventually clashed with the famous Los Blancos.\n\nThe semi-final match marked the first time two sides from the United Kingdom faced each other on Spanish soil.\n\nIt was the Scots that booked their place in the final, edging Swansea 4-3 as King Alfonso XIII of Spain watched on in attendance.\n\nThe King even went on to tell publications that the match was a “brilliant display of scientific football.”\n\nMotherwell were poised to face five-time Copa del Rey winners Real Madrid, though the Scottish side also had their squad boosted by players from other Spanish clubs.\n\nWhat's the most bizarre football tale you love to tell down the pub? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nMeanwhile, Madrid were yet to win the first of their 33 La Liga titles with the competition only being formed two years later.\n\nWhat followed on 17 May 1927 was a stunning 3-1 victory for the visitors.\n\nDundee and Dundee United had previously won in the Spanish capital in the 1920s but Motherwell, in conquering Madrid, became the first Scottish club to actually leave with silverware."
