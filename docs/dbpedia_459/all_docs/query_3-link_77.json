Since its inception in December 2021, Wave FC has broken every major single-game attendance record (home opener, regular season, and playoff), won the NWSL Shield, became the first expansion team to make and win a playoff game, have its players win awards like Golden Boot, Coach of the Year, Goalkeeper of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, and Rookie of the Year – all while fostering a diverse community of game changers in our San Diego community whose aim is to lower barriers of entry, create new opportunities for underserved groups, and inspire the next generation of leaders.\n\nOur club’s vision is to be a force for good through the game of football and drive meaningful impact for women and girls not only on the field but in the workplace, at home, and in society. Wave FC is led by President Jill Ellis, former head coach of the US Women’s National Team (USWNT) and two-time World Cup champion. Together with Head Coach Casey Stoney, the club is bringing the highest level of world-class, professional soccer to San Diego. On the field, the club is represented by established international stars like Alex Morgan, Naomi Girma, Abby Dahlkemper, and Kailen Sheridan, as well as some of the brightest young talents in fútbol in 2022 U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year Jaedyn Shaw and San Diego native Melanie Barcenas.\n\nWave FC plays its home matches at the brand-new Snapdragon Stadium in Mission Valley, where the club and its supporters come together each week to celebrate the beautiful game and create a thrilling home-field advantage that only San Diego can deliver."
