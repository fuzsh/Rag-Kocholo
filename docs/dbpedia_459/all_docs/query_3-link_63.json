        "text": "Steven Gerrard has been appointed coach of Saudi side Al Ettifaq, having previously decided against taking up the position, the Saudi Pro League club said.\n\nThe former Liverpool and England midfielder said last month that he would not be taking up an offer to join the team. However, the 43-year-old has had a change of heart and has become the latest big name to join the growing league.\n\n“Where legends are found. We’re thrilled to announce Steven Gerrard is our new head coach,” Al Ettifaq wrote on Twitter on Monday.\n\nGerrard guided the Rangers to their first Scottish Premiership title in 10 years in 2021 before leaving for Aston Villa, where he was sacked last October after winning just two of the opening 12 Premier League games\n\nGerrard’s move is the latest in a number that have followed since Al Nassr signed Cristiano Ronaldo last December. Former Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema joined Al Ittihad in June.\n\nN’Golo Kante, Ruben Neves, Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy and Marcelo Brozovic have also moved to the Saudi Arabian league.\n\nAl Ettifaq, based in the city of Dammam, finished seventh in the top-tier Saudi Pro League last season."
