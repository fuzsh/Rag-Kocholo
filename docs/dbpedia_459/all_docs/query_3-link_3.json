The following, however, are permitted:\n\nOne clear bag no larger than 12\" x 6\" x 12\" or a one-gallon clear freezer bag (Ziploc or similar).\n\nGuests may carry a small clutch bag or purse no larger than 5\" x 9\", with or without a strap.\n\nDiaper and medical bags are allowed with no size restrictions. Bags will be checked and tagged by security upon entering Allianz Field.\n\nStarting in the 2024 season, bag check will no longer be available. Please refrain from bringing bags to Allianz Field to ensure a quick and easy entry.\n\nFor more information regarding the Allianz Field clear bag policy, please reach out to MNUFC guest experience at experience@mnufc.com or see the full AâZ fan guide."
