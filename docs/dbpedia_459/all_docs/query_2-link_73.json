        "text": "After suffering very disappointing losses in their respective semifinal games, Egypt and Morocco will battle for the bronze medal tomorrow, August 8 at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nBoth teams were on their way to a chance at reaching the gold medal game when a last minute goal from their opposition changed everything for these teams.\n\nEgypt was up 1-0 until the 83rd minute when French player Jean-Philippe Mateta got the equalizer. After going into extra time, it was still anyone's game until nine minutes into extra time where France added their second goal. France ended up winning 3-1 in extra time, sending Egypt to the bronze medal game.\n\nMorocco was up 1-0 early in their match, Spain tied the game at 65 minutes. It seemed like extra time was on the horizon for these teams until Spain scored at the 85th minute, giving them the lead. Spain won 2-1 and crushed Morocco’s dream of the gold medal game.\n\nBoth of these teams will have a chip on their shoulder after losing in a deflating way. With motivation like that, any outcome for this game is possible.\n\nMorocco might have the edge over Egypt because of their goal scoring ability. Morocco has a total of 11 goals in the Olympics, while Egypt only has five. All eyes will be on Moroccan star Soufiane Rahimi as he has six goals in five matches.\n\nEgypt never quite dominated in any of their games this Olympics. Their wins consisted of one goal wins and a win in penalty kicks, and then one tie. With a lack of firepower up top, Egypt’s defense will have to be rock solid if they would like to contain the Moroccan’s offense.\n\nBoth of these teams will be competing for their first Olympic medal in men’s soccer.\n\nThey will take the field on Thursday, August 8 at 11 a.m. ET. Who is going to bring their first soccer Olympic medal back to their country?"
