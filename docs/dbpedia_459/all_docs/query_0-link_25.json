Version 2 Cornhole Wraps - Set of 2\n\nRating Required\n\nName Required\n\nEmail Required\n\nReview Subject Required\n\nComments Required\n\nFinish: (Required)\n\nSqueegee: (Required)\n\nI understand this is for just the wraps and boards are not included: (Required) Yes\n\nCurrent Stock:\n\nAdding to cart… The item has been added\n\nAdd to Wish List\n\nCreate New Wish List\n\nDescription\n\nFAQs\n\nIf you are looking for a great way to customize your cornhole boards, there is nothing better than these wraps. They fit any regulation sized cornhole boards (24″x48″), are easy to apply, and make for a great way to upgrade your game.\n\nOur wraps are printed on 3M Vinyl using the best Eco - Sol inks and are made of High Quality Vinyl that features Rapid Air technology. This feature helps eliminate the chances of getting any air bubbles when installing your wraps.\n\nWe use TrueVis printing technology which produces vivid and long-lasting colors that look amazing on any cornhole board.\n\nThe holes are not pre-cut on our cornhole wraps. This allows for easy installation of the wraps on your boards. The holes can easily be cut out with a knife once they are applied onto the boards. The picture of the wraps on our site shows where the holes would go if your boards are regulation size.\n\nWe can mix-and-match our cornhole wrap designs. If you're interested, please place an order for one of the sets as normal. Then, during checkout, just leave us a message letting us know what you would like the other wrap to be.\n\nWhat is a Squeegee?\n\nA squeegee is a small flat plastic tool that is used to help apply the wraps and get out air bubbles.\n\nTo Laminate or Not to Laminate?\n\nThese cornhole wraps come laminated or unlaminated. We highly recommend laminated cornhole wraps - they extend the life of the wrap and are easier to apply. They do not require a clear coat; however we do recommend a coat or two for extra protection and a great playing surface. Unlaminated wraps are a raw decal and will require a clear coat.\n\nPrice includes two wraps (cornhole skins), one for each board.\n\nCornhole wraps ship within 2-3 days of placing the order.\n\nCornhole boards and bags are not included.\n\n1. What is Cornhole?\n\nFor more information about cornhole, please visit our What is Cornhole page.\n\n2. What are the rules to play Cornhole?\n\nFor an entire breakdown of the cornhole rules, please visit our How To Play page.\n\n3. Why should I purchase from Custom Cornhole, LLC?\n\nIf you're looking for great cornhole sets and accessories at affordable prices then you've come to the right place! All of our cornhole sets are hand-made and ship to your door in days.\n\nOur goal is to produce a wide variety of premium grade cornhole boards at reasonable prices. All of our boards are built with quality material that meets the specifications of the American Cornhole Association (ACA).\n\nOn top of that, our prices can't be beaten. Most other companies charge well over $100 to ship their boards. We guarantee to ship your boards for no more than $40 anywhere in the country.\n\n4. Where is Custom Cornhole, LLC located?\n\nCustom Cornhole was founded and operates out of Bend, Oregon.\n\n5. Can I return my bags or boards?\n\nAfter 7 days, all sales are final.\n\nOrders/Items can be returned for exchanges only within 7 days of purchase. If an exchange is made, the customer is responsible for both the return shipping of the original product and shipping charges for the new product to be shipped.\n\nDamaged Packages\n\nOccasionally packages are damaged in transit and must be replaced. We must be notified of a damaged package within 5 business days of receiving the package. We will handle the pickup of the damaged package and ship a replacement product.\n\nCornhole Bag Replacement Policy\n\nAll of our cornhole bags are guaranteed for 30 days after date of purchase.

This guarantee only covers the stitching not the fabric itself. For more information please visit our Terms and Conditions page.\n\n6. How long will it take for my cornhole order to arrive?\n\nIt all depends on what you order. All of our stock bags, accessories and decals will ship in less than 48 hours after the order is made. Most of our boards sets also ship within 48 hours. It's the custom boards and bags that take a little longer. Once we get your approval of the mock-up, custom orders take roughly 5 business days to produce.\n\n7. Can I get my cornhole order rush shipped?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot rush ship orders. We have selected a FedEx service that we felt offered our customers the best, least costly shipping for their product. Airfreight of packages with these dimensions and weight are very cost prohibitive.\n\n8.

What are the dimensions of a cornhole board?\n\nWe manufacture only American Cornhole Association approved equipment. Boards are 4 feet in length, 2 feet in width and 1 foot high at the highest point. The hole is 6 inches in diameter.\n\n11. What type of wood is used for the cornhole boards?\n\nWe use half inch cabinet grade plywood for the top and premium 2x4's for the sides.\n\n12. Do the legs fold out?\n\nYes.\n\n13.

Can you put two different boards together?\n\nYes we can! Just let us know the specific board designs you would like to put together, and we will create a custom link for you to finalize your order.\n\n16.
