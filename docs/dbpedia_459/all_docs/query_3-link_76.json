Hopefully it brings me luck and support from the Hammer fans! And thank you to the club for allowing me to use the crest on the bag! #coyi.\"\n\nHorschel won the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play in March and revealed afterwards he had received a message of congratulations from West Ham stalwart Mark Noble, who is set to watch him and meet him during Wednesday's practice session in Sandwich.\n\n\"Mark Noble sent me a text,\" he said after beating Scottie Scheffler in the final at Austin Country Club.\n\n\"I've never met Mark, but he got my number from Francesco Molinari and sent me a text yesterday. That was one of the coolest things, and we were texting back and forth.\""
