        "text": "There was a time when there was no Clasico in Spanish women’s football. Instead, there were different rivalries across a range of clubs.\n\nLevante, Athletic Bilbao, Rayo Vallecano, and Espanyol were the strongest sides of the 2000s. At that time, Barcelona were still an adolescent team yet to reach maturity. Real Madrid were not there at all, and nor was their arrival expected any time soon.\n\nOver the following decade, Barca and Atletico Madrid were the dominant clubs, battling with each other for major transfers and trophies in Spain (Barca have won seven of the past 11 Liga F titles, Atletico three, Athletic one).\n\nReal Madrid created their own team only in 2020 after absorbing CD Tacon in 2019. So it is difficult to speak of an eternal rivalry with Barca that mirrors their male counterparts.\n\nNow though, there can be no doubt: the rivalry is heating up. Part of that has to do with sporting reasons — over the years Real Madrid have become much more competitive and on Thursday night came close to clinching a first victory over Barca.\n\nIn their Supercopa semi-final on Thursday, Barca ran out 3-1 winners, but only after extra time. The Catalans had Irene Paredes sent off in the 59th minute, but that in itself was a reflection of the intensity driving Madrid — and their conviction that they could finally win, in what was the 10th meeting between the sides.\n\nOff the pitch, there is plenty going on, too. There is real tension between the teams over the evolving and bitter dispute between a large number of Spain’s best internationals and the country’s football association.\n\nThis is the story of a new and emerging Barca-Madrid divide. It’s only going to get bigger — and the wider conflicts behind it remain unsolved.\n\nBarcelona and Real Madrid’s women’s teams met for the first time at the start of the 2019-20 season and the scoreline was one-sided: 9-1. There was a reason for that.\n\n“We were already identified as Real Madrid, but we were still CD Tacon,” says David Aznar, who was retained as head coach when the takeover was completed.\n\n“We had a unique mix of world stars who had just joined, like (Sweden internationals) Kosovare Asllani and Sofia Jakobsson, and a base of players making their debut in the top flight. Newcomers to professional football.”\n\nSara Ezquerro was part of Tacon’s promotion from the second tier the previous year and experienced the sudden transition.\n\n“When I found out we were going to be Real Madrid I thought I could die peacefully,” she says.\n\n“We were living a dream, but it was a tough few months of adaptation. When players like Jakobsson and Asllani arrived, many people took photos with them as if they were fans. It was normal, we admired them a lot.\n\n“One day, they told us if we wanted to be professionals, we had to normalise it and treat them as team-mates, not as idols. We had psychologists to help us and the year ended better than it started.”\n\nThat 9-1 defeat to Barca showed there was a gulf in class, but that has narrowed sharply.\n\nAfter that game, Madrid found balance and stability and avoided relegation. Staying up was their goal for the season.\n\n“The matches against Barca were a barometer for the project. We wanted to see at the end of each game whether or not we were closer to their level,” says Aznar.\n\nTheir second meeting of that first season ended in a 6-0 Barca win. The next campaign, 2020-21, Barca again won both times — 0-4 and 4-1 — but Madrid had progressed.\n\nWith Alberto Toril as manager, they came second in the league that season, but still 25 points behind Barca, who scored 167 goals, conceded 15 and lost only once. Real had, though, qualified for the Champions League.\n\nThen came 2021-22, the season of five Clasicos.\n\nThe first was in the Supercopa de Espana semi-finals. Barca won 1-0 with a goal from Alexia Putellas in the 91st minute.\n\nThe two La Liga meetings ended in 3-1 and 5-0 wins for the Catalans. But the big duel was in the Champions League quarter-finals. After a 3-1 win for Barca in the first leg in Madrid, the second leg at the Camp Nou was the setting for a historic match in women’s football.\n\nSome 91,553 fans attended the match, a world record for a women’s game, surpassing the 90,195 set at the 1999 World Cup final between China and the United States at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.\n\n“I went to the stadium to watch the game. I looked at the players I knew. I looked at them and wondered if they had ever imagined being part of something so big,” says Ezquerro, who now plays for Real Oviedo.\n\nNow there could be no doubt: the sporting rivalry shared by their male counterparts was felt between these Barca and Madrid teams, too. But with a difference. A difference that is perhaps particular to women’s football.\n\n“All of us involved in women’s football are involved in making it grow. We all have a common goal. There is competitive tension, but there is a lot of attention to detail and few situations of conflict,” Aznar says.\n\nEzquerro adds: “Rivalry and fanaticism in women’s football is much healthier. It is a fanaticism of love for a team, leaving aside other political aspects.”\n\nThat is why what came next was so surprising, shocking almost: the image of Barcelona’s Aitana Bonmati refusing to shake hands with Madrid goalkeeper Misa in the first Clasico of this season on November 6 last year.\n\nThere is an explanation behind it, a complicated one. This is where we reach the ongoing dispute between a large number of Spain’s internationals and the country’s FA.\n\nIn July 2022, Spain’s disappointing elimination from the European Championship accentuated an already existing malaise among the national team’s players. They had been one of the favourites but failed to convince in the group stage and were knocked out in the quarter-finals by hosts and eventual winners England.\n\nAt the next call-up after the Euros, in September, team captains spoke to manager Jorge Vilda and explained players believed a change was needed in both training and tactics. Complaints also focused on the coach’s management of the squad, that Vilda exercised too much authority over them.\n\nSources close to the Barcelona dressing room, who have asked to remain anonymous to protect their positions, claim some players saw national-team training as a waste of time compared to the high-level routines they were used to at their club.\n\nPlayers also felt Vilda’s managerial style was too controlling. In the first few years of his time in charge of Spain — he was appointed in 2015 — he would ask players to keep their room doors open until midnight and check who was in which room. When coming back from a walk outside, they would be asked who they’d been with and be requested to show the contents of shopping bags if they brought some back.\n\nThe players, in their conversation with Vilda after the Euros, told him they were going to convey their feelings to Luis Rubiales, the president of the Spanish FA, who publicly supported the coach.\n\nOn September 1, Spain internationals Irene Paredes, Jennifer Hermoso, and Patri Guijarro came out at a press conference. They denied they had asked for Vilda’s resignation, as had been reported, and that they instead wanted to “convey a message of general unease”, adding they were convinced the group “could achieve great titles”.\n\nVilda appeared at another press conference to express his surprise at the situation and said that he was “not thinking of resigning”.\n\nThen, later that month, on September 23, the Spanish FA received 15 emails from players saying that they would not return to the national team if the concerns they had raised were not addressed\n\nAll the letters said exactly the same thing: they wouldn’t return if the situation wasn’t reversed because it was “affecting their health”.\n\nThe federation replied in a statement in which it made clear it “would not allow the players to question the continuity of the national coach and his coaching staff” and that it “would only count on committed players, even if they have to play with youth players”. When Spain beat Argentina 7-0 in September, seven players made their debuts.\n\nThe statement concluded: “The players who have resigned will only return to the national team in the future if they accept their mistake and apologise.”\n\nThe 15 players who sent the letter were Aitana Bonmati, Ainhoa Moraza, Patri Guijarro, Lucia Garcia, Leila Ouahabi, Mapi Leon, Ona Batlle, Laia Aleixandri, Claudia Pina, Andrea Pereira, Mariona Caldentey, Sandra Panos, Lola Gallardo, Nerea Eizagirre and Amaiur Sarriegi.\n\nThey were supported by Paredes — who did not want to send the letter because she felt singled out after the press conference she gave on September 1 — Hermoso, and Alexia Putellas, who did not sign because she was still injured.\n\nNone of the seven Real Madrid players who had been part of the Euro 2022 squad sent such a letter. Sources close to some of those players, who asked to speak anonymously in order to protect their positions, claim they received pressure from the club not to do so. Real Madrid deny this is the case.\n\nThe international future of those 15 players is unclear. None have been included in Vilda’s two call-ups since. Neither have Paredes or Hermoso. Vilda has the full support of the Spanish FA and will be the team’s coach for this year’s World Cup, which runs from July 20 to August 20 in Australia and New Zealand. The next call-up will be on February 13 and there is uncertainty about what will happen.\n\nThursday night was another Clasico played amid this storm and it was clear the rivalry has flared up. You could see it in the players’ celebrations and in their hunger for victory. The women’s Clasico has taken the final step.\n\nReal Madrid are narrowing the gap, but Barcelona are still a long way ahead. They have spent a lot of time and money in pursuit of their aim: becoming the best in Europe.\n\nYet there is a great thirst, from both sides, for this new and emerging domestic rivalry, which may well be mutually beneficial.\n\nLluis Cortes was the Barcelona manager when Real Madrid was created. Now in charge of Ukraine, he recalls that first meeting back in September 2019.\n\n“The preparation for the game was the same, but on an emotional level we were all aware that playing against Real Madrid was a special match,” he says.\n\n“At the beginning, there were doubts about whether or not it could be labelled a Clasico. It was a debate we had in the dressing room. Atletico Madrid were the team that had challenged us for titles.\n\n“I think we thought it wasn’t a Clasico, but unconsciously we knew it was.\n\n“When they arrived at the Johan Cruyff Stadium and we beat them 9-1, it was a bit of a letdown. But little by little they have been getting closer, although Barca is still a long way off.\n\n“When we talk about Spanish football, the Clasico is Barca-Real Madrid. Nobody moves as much as these two clubs. It’s good for both.”\n\n(Top photo: Getty Images; design: Samuel Richardson)"
