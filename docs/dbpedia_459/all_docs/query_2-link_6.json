        "text": "There is an air of invincibility around Real Madrid in the Champions League.\n\nReal Madrid have won the trophy 14 times and have not lost a European final since 1983 when Sir Alex Ferguson ’s Aberdeen beat them in the Cup Winners’ Cup. It is little wonder that history and success leaves many opponents beaten even before the game kicks off. It is why there will also a feeling of inevitability at Wembley on Saturday night.\n\nJude Bellingham will take centre stage at Wembley as Real Madrid’s latest superstar but it also the experience within their ranks which makes Borussia Dortmund huge underdogs. Veterans Luka Modric, Nacho and Dani Carvajal can all win the trophy with Madrid for a sixth time.\n\nToni Kroos, 34, will be playing his final club game for Real Madrid as he retires after the Euros and he has won four with the Spanish giants and got a medal when Bayern Munich won it in 2014 even though he missed the final through injury.\n\nThat experience and know-how is the reason why, even when Real Madrid face difficult moments, they have an inner strength from the club’s DNA to make them believe they can turn any situation around.\n\nThey were losing to Bayern Munich with two minutes to go in the semi final and yet still found a way to win as two-goal hero Joselu turned it around that night.\n\nThat is why Real Madrid believe their name is written on the trophy and Carlo Ancelotti - another serial winner who has won it four times as a coach and twice as a player - admits their history gives them an unshakeable belief.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who will win the Champions League final? Comment below.\n\nIt is ten years since 64-year-old Ancelotti lifted the first of his two European Cups with Real Madrid and he admits the current squad keeps him young but he also says that history is the reason why they keep winning.\n\nAncelotti said: “I think there is something special in this club, It can be the history, the character, the quality of the players. It has happened so many times it cannot be a coincidence.\n\n“I still feel young, it is true that the first time I was in the final with Real Madrid was 10 years ago and a lot of things have happened, this generation were able to do a fantastic job in this club.\n\n“The players who were here and still here so thanks to those players, this club to reach something that is really unbelievable. Throughout the season my team has proven two very important things: quality – which is fantastic in every case.\n\n\"With another important component which is sacrifice for the team, the collective attitude of my team – it has been able to prove that. Sacrifice plus quality is going to be the key for tomorrow's game.”\n\nDortmund have brought 60,000 fans to London and Wembley will be a sea of yellow even if Real Madrid arrived with an unmistakable feeling of confidence bordering on arrogance.\n\nThis is a final in England’s national stadium with Bellingham against Jadon Sancho as the sideshow as Dortmund’s on-loan Manchester United winger with plenty to prove. But, ultimately, Real Madrid will feel the story is about them.\n\nAncelotti added: “This is the most important game of the season for us and we must have plenty of respect for our rival. They deserve to be in this final.\n\n“I'm very happy to be here, it is not my first time and I hope it is not the last! I think the last few days I have had a good time and been happy, I am confident in my players, I know they are going to give it all on the pitch.”"
