        "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla. – Florida Gulf Coast University women's soccer swept the Atlantic Sun Conference's preseason player of the year honors Wednesday and was picked No. 1 overall in the ASUN Coaches Poll, as announced by the league office.\n\nFGCU and Southwest Florida are home to the Preseason ASUN Player of the Year, the Midfielder of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year and Goalkeeper of the Year. The Eagles also earned nine of the 12 first-place votes, while Lipscomb obtained three for second place.\n\nAshley Labbe captured the highest preseason honor, the ASUN Player of the Year. 2023 ASUN Tournament MVP Erika Zschuppe was named the Midfielder of the Year. Reese Mendenhall was credited with the Defender of the Year, and Olivia Molina grabbed the Goalkeeper of the Year nod from the league.\n\nKendal Gargiula appeared on the Preseason All-ASUN Team as well, giving FGCU five of the nine available spots on the preseason list.\n\n\"I'm really pleased to see the ladies receive recognition for their hard work and success,\" head coach Jim Blankenship said. \"This dedicated group has been instrumental in our tournament successes. I am sure as the season goes on, they will have a huge impact on our achievements and continue to set a high standard.\"\n\nASHLEY LABBE\n\nASUN Preseason Player of the Year\n\nLake Worth, Fla. | Grad.\n\n2023 Honors:\n\nASUN First Team\n\nASUN All-Tournament Team\n\nASUN Fall Winner for Life\n\nUnited Soccer Coaches All-South Region Third Team\n\nUnited Soccer Coaches Scholar All-South Region\n\nLabbe started in 17 contests for the 2023 championship-winning Eagles. She missed five matches due to injury, but still managed to record a team-leading 34 shots on goal, which also paced the conference. Labbe recorded 66 shots a season ago, including one in the NCAA First Round against No. 2 seed Texas Tech. Her 66 shots tied teammate Zschuppe for the team and ASUN lead. She averaged 3.88 shots per match, which ranked 18th nationally.\n\nLabbe tallied the third most goals on the squad with six, tying for 6th overall across the ASUN. She was also third on the team and 6th in the ASUN in total points with 15 points, adding three assists. The Lake Worth native found the back of the net in three consecutive matches against Queens, Austin Peay and Lipscomb. She provided the game-winner against Lipscomb, and also connected on a game-winner in FGCU's ASUN Quarterfinal win over Austin Peay. Labbe was one of only three Eagles with two or more game-winners last season. She played the full time in three matches, totaling a vital 1,308 minutes on the pitch.\n\nERIKA ZSCHUPPE\n\nASUN Preseason Midfielder of the Year\n\nKirtland, Ohio | Jr.\n\n2023 Honors:\n\nASUN First Team\n\nASUN Tournament MVP\n\nASUN Player of the Week (1x)\n\nUnited Soccer Coaches All-South Region First Team\n\nTopDrawer Soccer's Top 100 List\n\nZschuppe scored the infamous hat trick to spark the Eagles' come-from-behind victory in the 2023 ASUN Championship match over North Alabama. She scored all three goals in a span of 14 minutes. She also scored the tying goal in ASUN Quarterfinal win over Austin Peay. Zschuppe tallied a team-leading 10 goals and eight assists in 2023, worth 28 points. She emerged second in the ASUN in total goals, but first in overall points.\n\nThe Ohio native had three game-winners, including against in-state rivals South Florida and FIU. She appeared on SportsCenter's Top 10 Plays with a crossover goal off the post. Zschuppe recorded two shots, one on goal, in the NCAA First-Round battle against No. 2 seed Texas Tech. For the season, she fired 66 shots to tie for the team lead, 25 of those were on goal which ranked second most on the squad.\n\nREESE MENDENHALL\n\nASUN Preseason Defensive Player of the Year\n\nPhoenix, Ariz. | Sr.\n\n2023 Honors:\n\nASUN First Team\n\nUnited Soccer Coaches All-South Region Second Team\n\nMendenhall anchored FGCU's back-line defense, tallying 1,972 minutes and tirelessly chasing down countless through balls. She accumulated the second most minutes played on the team a season ago. Mendenhall played the full time in 18 contests and recorded at least 82 minutes on the pitch in every match.\n\nThe Arizona native helped to produce 10 clean sheets, second most in ASUN and 14th nationally. She also played a vital role in FGCU's seven shutouts in ASUN play. She was a part of a defensive squad that held opponents to 10 shots or less in six matches.\n\nOffensively, she notched five assists for third most on the team and fifth overall across the ASUN. Mendenhall had back-to-back assists in wins over North Florida and Jacksonville, and provided an assist in FGCU's ASUN Quarterfinal win over Austin Peay.\n\nOLIVIA MOLINA\n\nASUN Preseason Goalkeeper of the Year\n\nTampa, Fla. | So.\n\n2023 Honors:\n\nASUN All-Freshman Team\n\nASUN All-Tournament Team\n\nASUN Goalkeeper of the Week (1x)\n\nTopDrawerSoccer's Top 100 List\n\nMolina broke the program record for the most saves in a single season with 117. Her 117 saves ranked second in the ASUN and ninth nationally. She led the ASUN in save percentage ( .867), placing 12th in the country, and was third across in the league saves per game at 5.32.\n\nThe freshman produced 10 clean sheets, seven clean sheets in ASUN play to guide the 2023 championship-winning Eagles to 12-5-5 record and 7-1-3 mark in conference. She held No. 2 seed Texas Tech scoreless for nearly 80 minutes in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, tallying eight saves.\n\nThe Tampa native had a season-high of 12 saves in a win over South Florida, and snagged five saves in the ASUN Championship match as the Eagles advanced on penalty kicks. Molina surrendered only 18 goals as a freshman and finished the season ranked No. 61 overall in TopDrawerSoccer's Top 100 List."
