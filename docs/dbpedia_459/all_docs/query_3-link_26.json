If the venue/local club has an all-inclusive ticket/section, this does not apply for U.S. Soccer events unless explicitly listed.\n\nHow can I purchase a suite?\n\nFor suite information, please email tickets@ussoccer.org.\n\nHow can I purchase ADA tickets?\n\nTo purchase ADA tickets, please click on the order page through ussoccer.com for the event you are looking to attend. For all U.S. Soccer controlled matches, ADA tickets are available through the primary purchasing page, which can be accessed through ussoccer.com To look for all ADA options, please look for the ADA or Wheelchair icon on the main page during the buy flow. If you have difficulty finding ADA seating on the primary purchasing page, please contact tickets@ussoccer.org.\n\nHow can I purchase a ticket in the Organized Supporters Section?\n\nIf you are interested in Organized Supporter tickets, please visit the ‘Match Hub’ page for the match you are looking to attend. Under Ticket Info and How to Purchase, you will find a link to purchase Organized Supporter tickets. If there is no link listed, tickets may not be on sale yet.

Where can I find information on gates, parking, prohibited items, bag policy, merchandise locations, etc.?\n\nPlease visit the Match Guide on our website for the specific match you are attending. The Match Guide is usually posted on our website two weeks prior to the event and also emailed to purchasers in the week before the match. While every match is different, gates generally open 90 minutes prior to event start time. Parking lots generally open 4 hours prior to gates opening. Most stadiums use the clear bag policy and merchandise can be purchased at stands along the concourse, but please be sure to check the Match Guide for specifics, including prohibited items.\n\nCan my group be mentioned on the videoboard?\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to fulfill this type of request.\n\nCan I or my soccer club walk out with the players or be ball kids?\n\nWhile we appreciate your interest and willingness to participate as a player escort/ball kid, all positions are part of contractual rights to U.S. Soccer partners.\n\nAre there any meet & greet or autograph/picture opportunities?\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to fulfill these types of requests.\n\nCan I purchase a match-used ball?\n\nSubject to availability, match balls for home U.S. Soccer matches can be purchased at www.ussoccer.com/upgrade\n\nHow else can I make my match day experience memorable?\n\nPlease visit www.ussoccer.com/upgrade to purchase offers that may include pre-game field level access to watch warmups, a captain’s armband, post-game photo in the goal, post-game penalty kicks. All upgrades are subject to availability.\n\nIs re-entry allowed at U.S. Soccer matches?\n\nFans may not exit and re-enter the stadium using the same ticket.\n\nDoes U.S. Soccer have any travel packages or airfare/hotel/rental car offers?\n\nThis is usually not offered for U.S. Soccer events unless specifically noted on that match page."
