It may be that with your experience I can come to a more or less reasonable conclusion....\n\nSuppose a stage takes 4 hours, or 6 hours of walking. From that, how long you are actually, on average, between when you leave and when you arrive?\n\nObviously it depends on the elevation gain, the terrain, your physical fitness, your fatigue, the landscape, the hours of sunshine, the weather, random factors (I want to stop 2 hours to look at the sea, I had a little inconvenience...) etc... But, you know, the roughest estimate is better than nothing (aka \"the best is the enemy of the good\", Voltaire).\n\nSo, on average, does it seem reasonable to you, based on your personal experience, to assume that for a typical route the time spent on the road is for example 1.5 that required by the walk? More? Less?\n\nExample: if the route takes 4 hours from A to B, will it actually take me 6 hours to get to my destination?\n\nAny experience will be infinitely appreciated....\n\nmichal.don\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2022 - Camino del Norte, 2024 - Camino Francés\n\nWednesday at 1:01 PM\n\n#2\n\nWith all the caveats you mentioned, yes, I'd say, on average, for me, x1.5 is a decent guess.

Maybe some days i did not exactly start it in the right point or end it in the right point, but i guess with all the variables involved (as you already aknowledged) it might be better than nothing:\n\nWalking days: 29\n\nTime on Camino: 174h\n\nTime moving: 140h\n\nSo for me closer to 1,25x than 1,5x, but theres outliers to both ends of the spectrum.\n\nLindsay53\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 2019\n\nPortugues 2022\n\nVDLP 2023\n\nWednesday at 1:11 PM\n\n#4\n\nAfter reading your post I got out my diary and opened at a random entry. I departed at 0600 and arrived at 1500, covering 36 kilometres, working out at 4 kph. Looking at other entries this is a typical average speed for me. As I know I actually walk faster than this, around 5 kph, it works out about x 1.25\n\nRoland49\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCF 07/2019, CP 07/2023\n\nWednesday at 1:39 PM\n\n#5\n\nExtremely hard to predict.

Average walking speed is between 2.5-4.0 mph. But, that’s quite a big range. As I know that I walk closer to the higher end of that range, my walking day would be shorter than for a slower walker even with breaks, sight-seeing, and lolly gagging figured in. The other factor that I’ve found to determine the time required to cover a certain distance is whether I’m walking solo or with a partner. When walking with my wife, we tend to take more time to smell the roses (and I thank her for that). The general goal that I set daily is the time I want to arrive at my destination. My preference is to finish my walking day between 1-2 in the afternoon. So, whether I’m closer to 1 or to 2 doesn’t really matter.

I'm okay with walking downslope but not upslope, so elevation killed me. A typical stage for others taking 6h took me longer than that, probably 9h or so, therefore for timing wise I guess I'll need 1.5x more to finish a stage (around 2km+ per hour)\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nUs:Camino Frances, 2015 Me:Catalan/Aragonese, 2019\n\nWednesday at 2:41 PM\n\n#9\n\nIf you want to make a project of this you can search for many members Camino stages at Wikiloc.com. Each recorded track has the distance, average speed, moving time and total time.\n\nOne I saw for Sahagun to Mansilla de las Mulas was 22 miles with an average speed of 2.6 mph.

That makes the ratio 610 minutes / 510 minutes = 1.2\n\nThis method can be used to average out many walks over a stage and to compare averages of many stages to find which will slow you down more because of rests or sightseeing or availability of bars.\n\nRRat\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPlanning 2017\n\nWednesday at 3:56 PM\n\n#10\n\nI was asking myself a question.

Some people liked to take long breaks at a cafe. In my case, I would take a break of about 10 minutes every two hours. That was just enough time to enjoy a coffee or a soda. Long breaks killed me and I tried to finish before lunch if a day was less than 20 miles. In my case, I averaged 3 miles an hour or just under including breaks, whether it was flat or included hills. I calculated walking time by simply dividing the milage by 3 and that is how I planned my day. I never looked at elevation charts because if you are going from point A to point B, it does not matter what the elevation change is, You just deal with it as you come across it.\n\nC clearly\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMost years since 2012\n\nWednesday at 4:23 PM\n\n#12\n\nyou can search for many members Camino stages at Wikiloc.com.

For example, here is one of my days on the Invierno, which I didn't upload. Notice that my walking speed was respectable, but compare the moving time to the total time.

You don't have to walk many before you realise 'okay, I need to subtract /add an hour to this... '\n\nI've done some checking and my average on Camino is probably around the 1.25, however there are a few exceptions where it is significantly higher. That's typically caused by either a/ a site of particular interest along the way or b/ the days company.\n\nOccasionally one meets up with a fellow Pilgrim(s) who is very good company but somewhat slower, life's too short to just pass on by ...\n\nTypically I just tend to look at something that is ballpark 25/30 kilometres ahead as my goal for the day. When I get there I get there. If I'm still feeling good, my current location isn't that interesting, and there's somewhere else just five k's or so later I might take a break for half an hour or so and then just wander on. I almost never leave before 8, sometimes I'm done by 14.00, occasionally it's been nearer (or literally)19.00. Some people make a big thing about having enough time to get the washing dry but as I walk with Merino Gear it really doesn't matter. It either dries out the next day, or goes on me a little damp - no big deal. (I don't walk in winter!)\n\nIf I've booked somewhere I'll typically tell them if I anticipate arriving later, or call/send them a message to let them know that I'm still coming if I anticipate it being after 17.00.\n\nWith the exception of interesting destinations, for me it's just about the distance that I'm likely to feel comfortable with walking. Which you figure out with a little training and confirm with experience.\n\nJuspassinthru\n\nin our minds, we're vagabonds, you and I\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Francés 2017, Inglés 2019, Aragónes 2024\n\nWednesday at 6:40 PM\n\n#18\n\nI was asking myself a question.

I consider age, fitness, general health in the moment and terrain the most important for me in trying to answer your question. So, I’m 67, better than average fitness for my age and in good health but I was nursing a sore knee. I looked at my time/distance stats on 5 different stages including flats, ascents, descents and mixed. I averaged 3.75K/hour across the Arogónes/Francés this spring including stops so I was walking faster obviously but your question includes breaks and side trips. Your pace may be slower in the beginning until you walk yourself into Camino shape. Interestingly, I walked slower in the rain which surprised me. I guess it’s such a beat-down (for me) that I was just plodding along.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nJustOneGuy\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nSeptember 2024 by bike.

E.g., wet weather, moderate or strenuous terrain, time spent at second breakfast, how are my feet feeling, did I encounter a pilgrim who just may be my new best friend, did I consume more than one glass of vino tinto the evening before, is this the day I used the pilgrim mouse trap to get over the train tracks before Astorga, etc.\n\nI'm intrigued by the signage on the trails in Switzerland.

Though I doubt that it makes a significant difference to my overall pace. I am quite introverted and although I can keep up a sociable front for a while it can quickly be quite tiring. I often feel the need to ration my interactions with others. Walking the less travelled routes I usually find it much easier and more comfortable to drop into conversation with the far smaller number of pilgrims I meet.

I have never been interested in calculating my speed while on Camino because there are too many variables to consider. I am in the minority here, and know I am slow and accept it. I definitely smell the roses along the way, be it picture taking, being fascinated by \"little somethings\" I see, or being pooped going up a steep hill. I am mainly interested in the kilometers I want to walk per day as listed on Gronze or a guidebook after taking a quick look at the \"hills\" shown. I do not walk in winter so arriving before dark is never a problem.\n\ntrecile\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious routes 2016 - 2024\n\nYesterday at 6:55 PM\n\n#41\n\nSchedule? What is that? Just allow a few days more than you think you might need, then a few more for some time on arrival.\n\nI agree.\n\nI make a rough schedule to determine how many days it should take me to walk a particular route in order to book my flights. Then I add in at least five days for the \"what ifs\". Such as what if I get sick, what if I'm injured, what if I want to take it slower, etc. No need to take a taxi or bus when you've allowed yourself enough time.\n\nmotero99\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances 2019\n\nCamino Portugues (2023)\n\nYesterday at 8:38 PM\n\n#42\n\nI have always made a schedule, but none has lasted more than 3 days. I may learn something on the way, such as stop before or after the Briely stage stops, sometimes I feel especially good and go further and others am dragging and stop short. Planning gives cofidence, but more importantly the confidence to modify things as you go along.\n\nJustOneGuy\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nSeptember 2024 by bike.

Planning gives cofidence, but more importantly the confidence to modify things as you go along.\n\ndo you mean the schedule for the day (departure and arrival times) or do you change routes during the day, perhaps sleeping earlier or later?\n\nI certainly don't like to have a rigid schedule, however, at least knowing how long I EXPECT to take is important in my opinion, to know whether I arrive at night or during the day. Especially for those, like me, who are in their first experience with the camino.\n\nThen I certainly wouldn't worry about respecting it, at least most of the times.\n\nCWBuff\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances & Finisterre 05-07/22 Fran 26? d Nort 27?\n\nYesterday at 11:51 PM\n\n#44\n\nYep to this Robo\n\nYou could for funs sake try and come up with an algo for how long it should take , plus or minus how the day unfolds ...\n\n4 hours walking\n\neating time +45\n\nmeeting a nice person +1hour\n\nbumping into annoying person -30 mins (speeded up)\n\ndinner large +60 mins\n\nstone in shoe +5\n\nblister trouble +60\n\npacking pizza oven + +\n\netc etc ...

At the worst day of my blister suffering I went from Villafranca Montes de Oca to Santovenia de Oca in 7 hours. At that time it felt to me like I was crawling (each step was a 100000000000000000000000 daggers in my feet)\n\nAnhalter\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2019 CF, 2022 CF, 2024 Primitivo\n\nToday at 12:01 AM\n\n#45\n\nI certainly don't like to have a rigid schedule, however, at least knowing how long I EXPECT to take is important in my opinion, to know whether I arrive at night or during the day. Especially for those, like me, who are in their first experience with the camino.\n\nI understand your concern, i guess i had the same at some point, but in practice, it is not a problem.\n\nLets assume some worst case szenario: you walk slow and need to rest often. Lets say you cover 2,5km \"on track\". Lets say you are aware of it and set foot \"on track\" at 07:00. Given the circumstance, you will likely not want to walk more than 25km anyways. So you'll arrive at 17:00. And all was good.\n\nSince by my personal experience people move faster, sometimes cover less and sometimes cover more distance, in practice, it is no issue whatsoever. Yes, sometimes things will not work out and someone will arrive at 20:00 in a village, but that is by far the exception, not the rule."
