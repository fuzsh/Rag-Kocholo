        "text": "Australian Cap Number: 179\n\nDebut: 24-Jun-2012 v New Zealand (in Wollongong) International Friendly (D1-1) age 17\n\nCaps (Goals): 90 (19)\n\nMajor Tournaments: 2015 FIFA World Cup, 2018 AFC Asian Cup (Jordan), 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup (France), 2020 Olympic Games (Tokyo), 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup (India), 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup (Australia & New Zealand).\n\nCurrent Club: Real Madrid CF\n\nPrevious Clubs: Canberra United, Brisbane Roar, Washington Spirit (USA), Melbourne Victory, Portland Thorns (USA), Everton FC, Manchester City\n\nHailing from the Gold Coast, Hayley started her senior career with Canberra United in 2011 and won the premiership and championship that same season. She also won another premiership with Canberra United in 2016-17 and Brisbane Roar in 2017-18.\n\nAn attacking winger with incredible pace, Raso headed to the NWSL with Washington Spirit for a season before signing for Portland Thorns FC in 2016.\n\nHayley won the NWSL Shield in 2016 and NWSL Championship in 2017 before suffering an almost career-ending injury, fracturing three vertebrae in her back after an on-field collision while playing for Portland in 2018.\n\nA horrific back injury kept Raso out of the game for months, after breaking three vertebrae in a sickening collision. The forward was motionless on the ground after the collision and rushed to the hospital for immediate scans.\n\nNot only was Raso suffering a life-altering back injury, but she was also at a crossroads mentally. After being sidelined for what felt like forever, Hayley would make a dream comeback for Australia.\n\nRaso nervously waited on the sideline to make her return, donning her signature ribbon, coming on as a substitute against New Zealand in the Cup of Nations, and scoring almost immediately in front of adoring fans that knew the journey she had been through to step foot on the pitch.\n\nRaso would go on to make her Women's World Cup debut in France in 2019, with all shades of doubt if she would ever represent her country as a distant memory.\n\nSince that fateful day in 2018 Raso's career has continued to flourish; making her Women's World Cup debut, debuting at Tokyo 2020 and lifting the Conti Cup with Manchester City in England."
