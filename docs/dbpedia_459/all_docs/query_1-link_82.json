        "text": "Luis Suarez scored a sensational hat-trick as Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid 5-1 in the Clasico at Camp Nou on Sunday, leaving Julen Lopetegui facing the sack.\n\nMadrid’s coach watched as his team, ninth, ran aground against the league leaders, even though Lionel Messi was out injured.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho put Barcelona ahead after good work from Jordi Alba before Suarez won and converted a penalty.\n\nMarcelo struck early in the second half to put Madrid back in the game but Suarez hit two more as Barcelona finished in rampant fashion, with Arturo Vidal adding the fifth.\n\nHere are five talking points from the encounter...\n\n1. If Messi doesn’t get you Suarez will\n\nAhead of the Clasico all the talk was about this being the first Clasico since 2007 without Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nAlthough Barcelona’s best player was injured and forced to watch on from the sidelines, in Suarez, the Catalans still have plenty of firepower, while Madrid never replaced Ronaldo.\n\nAnd it was Uruguayan forward Suarez who made the difference, earning and converting a penalty as well as bagging a brilliant header before dinking the ball over Courtois for his hat-trick.\n\nThe striker now has eight goals in the Clasico since making his Barcelona debut, more than any other player in the fixture - more than Messi, more than Ronaldo. And this was the first hat-trick in the Clasico since Messi’s in 2014.\n\n2. Lopetegui goes down swinging in last stand\n\nAfter an inept first half performance, Real Madrid coach Julen Lopetegui might as well have started the journey back to Spain’s capital to start clearing out his office. Barcelona could have been four or five up at the break.\n\nHowever at half-time the coach tinkered, changing his 4-4-3 which was ripped to shreds and going for a bold 3-5-2, with Casemiro at centre-back and Isco in the hole instead of on the left wing.\n\nIt had an instant effect, with Barcelona unable to cope with the formation switch.\n\nMarcelo struck and Modric hit the spot, with Benzema missing a great opportunity to equalise. On another day Madrid might have levelled. In the end it wasn’t to be, with Suarez finally caving Madrid’s ceiling in and Arturo Vidal adding to the humiliation.\n\n3. VAR demonstrates its worth in Clasico\n\nReferee Jose Maria Sanchez Martinez was not going to award a penalty after Raphael Varane and Luis Suarez clashed in the box, but a voice in his ear told him he needed to take a second look at the incident.\n\nThe official ran over to the touchline, watched the video, saw the French defender’s clumsy collision with his Uruguayan opponent and realised that, yes, a foul had been committed.\n\nHe pointed to the penalty spot and Suarez doubled Barcelona’s lead. In years gone by that incident would have gone unpunished. It was too tricky for a referee to see in real-time and make a decision, too much riding on it to gamble, easier to let it go.\n\nNow there is a safety net and VAR was used quickly and efficiently to ensure justice was served.\n\n4. Luis Enrique cutting off his nose to spite his face with Alba\n\nJordi Alba is the best attacking left-back in the world and he showed it again in the Clasico with a superb assist to set up Coutinho for the opening goal.\n\nAnd yet the Barcelona man isn’t in the Spain squad because of a silly falling out with coach Luis Enrique during the latter’s time at Camp Nou.\n\nAlba is enjoying a brilliant season and capped it here with a superlative performance, a thorn in Madrid’s side throughout.\n\nGiven Spain’s struggles in recent years, including their 3-2 defeat by England in Seville earlier in October, perhaps it’s time for Lucho to change his mind and bring the Barcelona man back into the fold.\n\nOr maybe it’s all a ruse and the Spain coach is showing his true colours, allowing Alba to stay fresh and be one of Barcelona’s most potent weapons.\n\n5. Courtois endures tough Clasico debut\n\nEarlier Sunday Chelsea thrashed Burnley 4-0 to go second in the Premier League, keeping the pressure on leaders Liverpool .\n\nThe Belgian goalkeeper might have been part of the Blues title tilt but instead forced his way out of Stamford Bridge to join Madrid. A dream move, he said.\n\nIt has turned into a nightmare. Courtois, who doesn’t even get to play in Champions League games with Keylor Navas used there, shipped FIVE in his first Clasico, a true humiliation.\n\nMadrid are shipwrecked, ninth in the table, playing terrible football, and all he can do is watch his former team-mates turn on the style in west London."
