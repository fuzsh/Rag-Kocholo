        "text": "NORMAL, Ill. – For the first time this fall, the Redbird football team heard head Coach Brock Spack utter the crucial phrase \"We Are Live!\" signifying the team's first full-contact drill of training camp, as full pads went on for the first time Tuesday morning at Hancock Stadium. Tuesday's workout focused on work in the Red Zone and featured three specific situations during the team period at the end of the practice.\n\nPractice Highlights:\n\n• Practice began with the special teams circuit and position drills, before the passing under pressure drill … the defense made the first play of the session as Cam Wilson broke up the first pass attempt of the drill … Jake Rubley rebounded with two-straight completions before giving way to Tommy Rittenhouse at quarterback, who started three-for-three before being sacked by Jalan Gaines.\n\n• The 7-on-7 period followed, with Rubley completing 5-of-6 attempts with two completions to Brett Kasper … Rittenhouse was 4-for-6 during the drill, with connections to Scotty Presson Jr., Jalen Carr, Tommy Donovan and Braden Contreras … Jimmy Makuh was also solid on the opposite side of the field, going 4-for-4 as he found Brady Probst, Quinten Johnson and Valient Walsh for solid gains.\n\n• As the action moved to the team period, things got started in the red zone with the offense starting at its own 25 yard line … the first-team unit was held to a field goal by the defense, but put points on the board via a 33-yard field goal make by Ian Wagner … the second-team unit needed just one play to find the endzone, as Rittenhouse connected with Carr in the corner for a 25-yard touchdown … the third team was backed up following a pair of pass breakups from Doreon Dubose to forced a third-and-long situation, but freshman running back Matt Lawson ripped off a 19-yard gain to move the chains … he followed that up with an eight yard run to the two yard line that set up a 2-yard touchdown pass from Makuh to Donovan for a score.\n\n• The next scenario featured the offense backed up at its own 2-yard line needing to get some breathing room … the first-team unit picked up a first down on its first play from scrimmage, but was then shut down by the defense and Amir Abdullah who recorded a tackle for loss in the series … the defense then forced a three-and-out on the next two series to set up the final scenario of the workout.\n\n• The final team session allowed the offense to attempt to drive the field from its own 34 yard line … the first-team unit was back up on second down on a tackle for loss by Jalan Gaines, but later converted a fourth-down attempt on a run by Josh Robinson to move the chains … however, the defense rallied and forced a punt after a pass breakup by Teon Parks … the second unit went three-and-out after breakup by Wilson on third down forced a punt as well … the final drive of the practice was a solid one for the offense, as it began with a 32-yard completion from Makuh to Walsh that moved the ball to the defense's 34 yard line … three-straight runs by Lawson moved the ball to the three yard line, but a sack by Mark Haering and a false start by the offense moved the team back and stalled the drive.\n\nUp Next:\n\nThe Redbirds return to the field on Thursday morning at 8:30 a.m. for practice No. 7 of fall training camp.
