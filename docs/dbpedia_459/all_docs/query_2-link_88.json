        "text": "The USWNT brought the dramatics again as Sophia Smith scored the game-winning goal in extra time against Germany.\n\nIt was no secret this was going to be a tougher game than what USA fans saw in the group stage. In the first meeting between these two teams, the Americans beat down on the Germans in a 4-1 win.\n\nLooking at the scores, one would assume these games were completely different, but that is not the case. Both contests were evenly matched, each team would have their chances and had control over the ball at times. In the first game the Americans capitalized on these chances, but Tuesday goals were a lot tougher to come by.\n\nThe German goalkeeper, Ann-Katrin Berger, was a brick wall in the net. Facing ten shots, and only allowing one through in the 95th minute of the game. Without Berger in net, there is no doubt this could have been a very different outcome.\n\nBut the same goes for USWNT’s Alyssa Naeher. Naeher faced seven shots and had a terrific last minute save with her foot while she was midair. After seeing replays, it was likely to be called back for offsides, but there is no doubt that is the type of save that can drive a team to winning a gold medal.\n\nStar center defender, Naomi Girma, was as perfect as can be in this game. Scooping up every loose ball and stopping everything in her path. “She’s the best defender I’ve ever seen. Ever,” said head coach Emma Hayes after their win.\n\nThe trio of Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Mal Swanson came up big for the Americans once again.\n\nJust a few minutes into extra time, Swanson split two defenders and sent Smith racing into the box, a foot race between the defender and the goalkeeper, Berger. Smith got there just in time, one touched it past Berger and into the back of the net.\n\nThe remainder of the game was about controlling the ball and playing defense. The Americans did not want to sit too low, they played five in the back to compact and crowd the middle.\n\nIn the end, Smith’s goal proved to be enough to send the Americans to their first gold medal game since 2012.\n\nThe USWNT will take on familiar foe Brazil in the gold medal game on Saturday, Aug. 10 at 11 a.m. ET."
