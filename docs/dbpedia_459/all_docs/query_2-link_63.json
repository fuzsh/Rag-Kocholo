        "text": "Liverpool take on Real Madrid on Saturday in a repeat of the 2017/18 Champions League final.\n\nOn that occasion, a double from Gareth Bale helped the La Liga giants to the trophy in a 3-1 victory.\n\nNow the pair will battle it out once more for UEFA's prize trophy in Paris on Saturday night.\n\nAnd no matter what happens on the pitch, both clubs are set to make a lot of money from this season's Champions League.\n\nBut who will make the most? talkSPORT.com takes a look...\n\nLiverpool\n\nIf Liverpool win the Champions League, they will bag themselves a cool £93million in prize money alone.\n\nFor reaching the group stages, the Reds earned £13.1m. This was supplemented by £2.4m for each group stage win and £784,000 for each draw.\n\nThe Reds won all their group games, so earned another £14.4m.\n\nLiverpool also picked up some income from UEFA because of their coefficient ranking.\n\nUEFA then awarded Klopp's men £8.1m for reaching the knockout rounds plus £9.1m for making it to the quarter-finals.\n\nLiverpool received a further £10.5m for reaching the semi-finals and £13.1m for making it to the final.\n\nIf they win, they would add £3.8m for lifting the trophy and an extra £3m for playing the UEFA Super Cup.\n\nThis is just the prize money they will make and doesn't include the fees from broadcasting and the 30% they will take from UEFA's prize pot for finishing second in the Premier League.\n\nReal Madrid\n\nIncredibly, Real Madrid will make more than the Reds even if they lose in Paris.\n\nThis is mainly down to their coefficient ranking. The La Liga giants have been pretty much Champions League ever-presents, so they are entitled to more money.\n\nThey will also receive more revenue because of their past performances in the tournament.\n\nReal have won UEFA's premier competition four times in the last ten years, so they earn more than the Reds, who have reached the final in three of the last five years.\n\nTherefore, if Carlo Ancelotti's side lose, they will take home £98m, and if they win, they will earn £102m in prize money plus all of the broadcasting and matchday income."
