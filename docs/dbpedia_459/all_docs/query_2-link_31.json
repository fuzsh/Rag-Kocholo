        "text": "On March 6, 2012 Real Madrid celebrated another landmark as they ushered in their 110th year since the club's formation.\n\nWith over a century of football, history, triumphs, records, controversies, dramas and star players, there has certainly been no shortage of highlights to choose from to commemorate the club's 110th anniversary.\n\nAs we reach the end of the week of their celebrations, Goal.com compiles 110 interesting facts you may or may not know about Real Madrid.\n\n1. The first direct incarnation of the club was known as Football Club Sky formed in 1895. In 1900, the club split into New Foot-ball de Madrid and Club Espanol de Madrid. The latter club's president Julian Palacios eventually led a breakaway to help create Sociedad Madrid FC on March 6, 1902.\n\n2. Madrid CF's first two official club presidents were both Catalans. Joan Padros Rubio presided over the board from 1902 to 1904 and was succeeded by his brother Carles Padros Rubio from 1904 to 1908.\n\n3. Three years after Madrid FC was formed, they won their first official title after defeating Athletic Bilbao to lift the Copa del Rey in April 1905.\n\n4. Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stefano became the first player to win the Pichichi award four times in a row from 1956 to 1959. He has five wins in total.\n\n5. Real Madrid are the only club to win La Liga five times in succession. They accomplished this feat on two occasions, the first between 1961 and 1965, and the second between 1986 to 1990.\n\n6. Madrid have never won the treble. But they achieved the double (either La Liga plus Copa del Rey or La Liga and the European Cup) on six occasions.\n\n7. Madrid's all-time top scorer is their iconic former No. 7 Raul with 323 competitive goals, 228 of them in La Liga, which is also a club record.\n\n8. Real's biggest defeat in La Liga was against Espanyol when they lost 8-1 in 1929-30.\n\n9. Real have been European champions on nine occasions. Their biggest win in the competition was a 9-0 victory over Danish side Boldklubben 1909 in 1961-62.\n\n10. Cristiano Ronaldo scored Real Madrid's fastest hat-trick when he took just 10 minutes to bag his treble in the 6-2 win at Sevilla in May 2011.\n\n11. Madrid's biggest victory in La Liga was an 11-2 win over Elche on 7 February 1960. Their biggest victory in any competition was against Barcelona when they beat the Catalans 11-1 in a Copa del Rey (known then as Copa del Generalisimo) semi-final in 1942-43.\n\n12. Ferenc Puskas scored a total of 12 goals in the 1959-60 European Cup campaign, the most goals a Madrid player has scored in a single season in Europe's premier club competition.\n\n13. The first ever Clasico played was on May 13, 1902. Barcelona defeated Madrid 3-1 in a friendly match.\n\n14.

Miguel Munoz is the club's longest serving coach, totalling 15 years and 604 competitive matches. He won 14 titles during that span.\n\n16.

On December 17, 1922, Real Madrid saw Juan Monjardin become their first Spanish international when he played in a match against Portugal.\n\n18. Madrid have claimed the Copa del Rey on 18 occasions and there was an 18-year gap between their last two victories, in 1993 and 2011.\n\n19. The first ever competitive Clasico was on May 19, 1902 in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, which Barcelona won 3-1. It was also to be Madrid FC's first official game.\n\n20. FIFA named Real Madrid as the 'Best Club of the 20th Century'. It is the only club to be awarded the honour.\n\n21. Madrid FC's first game after formation was a match between the club's members. One team were blue and the other wore red. They eventually adopted their all-white shirts from London-based club Corinthians FC in 1902.\n\n22. Madrid have appeared in the semi-finals of the European Cup/Champions League 22 times, a record in the competition.\n\n23. David Beckham won just two trophies in his four-year spell at Madrid, claiming the Spanish Supercopa right at the beginning of his time at the capital club, and adding La Liga in his very last game for Real.\n\n24. Raul's final competitive game in the famous white shirt was on April 24, 2010 in the 2-1 La Liga win at Real Zaragoza.\n\n25.

Madrid participated in the European Cup 26 times prior to the tournament being renamed the Champions League.\n\n27.

Madrid played their first match at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu (then named Nuevo Estadio Chamartin) in a 3-1 victory over Os Belenenses. Sabino Barinaga scored the first ever goal on the ground.\n\n34. Although now 34, Alberto Rivera is the youngest player to debut for Madrid's first team in the league at 17 years and 114 days, beating the previous record set by Raul by just 10 days. Rivera is also the club's youngest goalscorer in the La Liga when he netted in the 2-0 win over Celta Vigo in June 1995 in that same debut game.\n\n35. Santiago Bernabeu was Madrid's club president for almost 35 years from September 1943 to June 1978.

Cristiano Ronaldo set a new La Liga record in 2010-11 by netting 40 goals in a single season.\n\n41. However, Marca, who awards the Pichichi prize, claimed it was 41 goals, including a free kick which had deflected off Pepe against Real Sociedad although officially, the referee had awarded it as an own-goal.\n\n42. Madrid sold Robinho to Manchester City in 2008 for €42.5 million, the highest transfer fee Real have received for a player.\n\n43.

Real Madrid were the first ever club champions of the world when they defeated Penarol 5-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu in the inaugural Intercontinental Cup back in 1960.\n\n52. One of Madrid's nicknames, Los Merengues - in reference to their all-white kit resembling a cake made entirely of egg white - was first coined in the magazine Espana Sportiva on January 3, 1917.\n\n53. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a club record 53 goals in all competitions in the 2010-11 campaign.\n\n54. Madrid have qualified for 54 out of 56 Uefa club competitions. They only missed out in 1977-78 and 1996-97.\n\n55. It was in January 1955 that the club decided to rename their stadium in honour of former president Santiago Bernabeu.\n\n56.

The Bernabeu played host to the Euro 64 final, the 1982 World Cup final, the European Cup finals in 1957, 1969 and 1980, as well as the 2010 Champions League final.\n\n60.

Madrid defeated their own B' team Castilla 6-1 to win the 1980 Copa del Rey.\n\n62. In his first one and a half seasons at Madrid, Mesut Ozil has already changed his shirt number four times. He was given the No. 26 upon his arrival and throughout pre-season, but changed to No. 19 for his official debut. He then took over the No. 23 left vacant by Rafael van der Vaart's departure, and at the start of the 2011-12 term, he inherited the No. 10.\n\n63. Real Madrid were the first club in the Spanish top flight to win back-to-back league titles, successfully defending the crown they won in 1931-32 in 1932-33.\n\n64. Ronaldo made his Real Madrid bow as a 64th minute substitute against Alaves in October 2002. He scored twice on his debut in the 5-2 win.\n\n65. Current supremo Florentino Perez, who turned 65 on March 8 - two days after the club's anniversary - is the only man apart from Adolfo Melendez to have served two separate stints as Real's president.\n\n66. The Madrid that won the 1966 European Cup were known as the Ye-ye team. This was because they had a young all-Spanish generation of players starring the likes of Amancio Amaro, Pachin, Pirri and Manuel Sanchis. The name Ye-Ye comes from the catchy chorus of the Beatles song 'She Loves You' (yeah yeah yeah) - and the team earned the nickname after four players famously posed for Marca wearing Beatles wigs.\n\n67. Predrag Mijatovic's 67th minute goal in the 1-0 win over Juventus in the 1998 Champions League final gave Madrid their seventh European Cup to put an end to a 32-year wait from their last triumph in 1966.\n\n68.

Real Madrid have won 72 major titles overall in the following competitions: La Liga, Copa del Rey, Spanish Supercup, European Cup/Champions League, Uefa Cup, Uefa Supercup, Intercontinental Cup.\n\n73. Madrid's 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1959/60 European Cup final is the highest-scoring final in the competition's history. The victory gave Real their fifth straight continental crown and were thus allowed to keep the trophy.\n\n74. Zinedine Zidane was signed by Madrid from Juventus for €74 million, currently the second most expensive football transfer in history.\n\n75. Zizou joined Juve in 1996, a year after they had won the Champions League. The Frenchman went on to play in two losing finals with the Old Lady before eventually lifting the European Cup in 2002 with Madrid.\n\n76. Jose Mourinho's current 76.77 win percentage for Real Madrid is the best of any of the club's coaches who was in charge for more than one game.\n\n77. Iker Casillas is the only remaining player from the Galactico era and the only current Madrid squad member who has won La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Champions League, Intercontinental Cup, Uefa Super Cup, Spanish Supercup, as well as a European Championship and World Cup with Spain.\n\n78. Former Madrid playmaker Guti had the name 'Guti.Haz' on the back of his shirt from 2007-08 onwards. The H in the 'Haz' stands for his second surname Hernandez, the A is for his son Aitor and Z for his daughter Zara.\n\n79. In 2010, Real Madrid became the first club in any sport to generate a revenue of over €400 million in a single year according to the Deloitte.\n\n80. In 146 league encounters against local rivals Atletico Madrid, Real have won 80 times, losing 35 and drawing 31.\n\n81. This is the 81st La Liga edition. Real Madrid have taken part in all 81 seasons, the only club in Spain to do so along with Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao.\n\n82. In the 82nd minute of the 4-2 win over Almeria on December 5, 2009, Cristiano Ronaldo saw his penalty saved by Diego Alves. That was the last time CR7 failed to convert a spot-kick and he is now on a run of 21 successful conversions in La Liga, just four behind the all-time record of 25 set by Barcelona's Ronald Koeman.\n\n83. In the 1982-83 season under coach Alfredo Di Stefano, Madrid completed a \"bridesmaid's treble\" when they finished runners-up in La Liga, the Copa del Rey and European Cup Winners' Cup.\n\n84. In the 1984-85 campaign, Madrid went nine games without a victory in the league, the club's worst winless run.\n\n85. This season after 25 rounds of matches in La Liga, Madrid have already scored 85 times at an average of 3.4 goals per game. At this rate, they will score 129 goals by the end of the campaign.\n\n86. In 217 official Clasico matches against Barcelona in all competitions, Madrid have won 86, losing 85 and drawing 46. Los Blancos have scored 364 goals and conceded 351.\n\n87. During the 1987-88 season, Madrid won a club record 18 out of 19 league games at home. They would go on to repeat the feat in 2009-10.\n\n88. Kaka has made 30 appearances in all competitions so far this season for Madrid and has provided 11 assists in total, just three shy of his all-time high in a single campaign which came in 2008-09 with Milan.\n\n89. Miguel Munoz has the honour of scoring Madrid's maiden goal in the European Cup. Alfredo Di Stefano was the scorer of the club's first goal in an European Cup final, after his side had gone 2-0 down against Stade Reims in the 1956 showpiece event.\n\n90. Xabi Alonso is the most expensive Spanish player that Madrid have signed. He cost the club €30 million when he joined from Liverpool in 2009. Sergio Ramos is the second most expensive at €27m.\n\n91. With 96 La Liga goals from 88 appearances, Cristiano Ronaldo has a league-record ratio of 1.09 goals per game. The second best is Telmo Zarra with 0.91 goals per game.\n\n92. Jose Mourinho's famous unbeaten home record in league games ran for nine years and two months before it was ended by Sporting Gijon's 1-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu on April 2, 2011.\n\n93. Real Madrid's own record unbeaten streak at home spanned nine seasons lasting 121 matches from 1956-57 to 1964-65.\n\n94. Madrid paid Manchester United a football transfer record €94 million for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.\n\n95. Alfredo Di Stefano currently holds the record for making the most consecutive La Liga appearances for Madrid. He played 171 league games in a row spanning five years and 148 days.\n\n96. Manuel Pellegrini set a new points record of 96 for Real Madrid in 2009-10, but it was not enough to win La Liga, nor to save him his job.\n\n97. In the 1997-98 season, Madrid kept a club record seven consecutive clean sheets in La Liga.\n\n98. Ferenc Puskas and Santillana are Madrid's joint-top scorer in Copa del Rey matches with 49 goals each.\n\n99. On September 1999, Iker Casillas made his first-team debut as a substitute for Bodo Illgner in the 2-2 draw against Athletic Bilbao at San Mames.\n\n100. On their 100th anniversary, Madrid famously lost the Copa del Rey final at home to Deportivo La Coruna.\n\n101. Arthur Johnson scored Madrid's first ever goal on May 13, 1902 in a 3-1 defeat to Barcelona. Jaime Lazcano scored the club's first ever La Liga goal. Their 1000th club goal was scored by Pahino. Gento scored their 2000th, Juanito their 3000th, Ivan Zamorano their 4000th and Guti grabbed the team's 5000th.\n\n102. Apart from Madrid's first ever goal, the club won all of their matches when they netted their landmark goals above.\n\n103. From September 24, 2011 to December 7, 2011, Madrid strung together 15 victories in succession in all competitions, the club's longest winning streak. Their record winning run in La Liga is also 15, set in 1960-61.\n\n104. Despite a glorious era as the club president from 1943 to 1978, Santiago Bernabeu had only eight games under his belt as a Madrid coach, winning five matches and losing the other three.\n\n105. Cristiano Ronaldo took just 105 games in all competitions to reach a century of goals for Madrid.\n\n106. Luis Molowny was appointed Madrid coach on four separate occasions (eitherpermanently or as caretaker), more than any other coach at the club.\n\n107. Madrid hold the Spanish record for most goals in a league campaign, with a haul of 107 under John Toshack in 1989-90.\n\n108. Alfredo Di Stefano's first stint as Madrid coach lasted 108 competitive matches from April 1982 to April 1984. He won 63 games, drew 23 and lost 22.\n\n109. Di Stefano returned to the Madrid hot-seat from November 1990 to March 1991 and picked up his only silverware as coach when he won the Spanish Supercup.\n\n110. As they celebrate their 110th anniversay, Madrid are first in La Liga 10 points clear at the top and have won their last 10 Primera Division matches.\n\nMadrid have claimed the Copa del Rey on 18 occasions and there was an 18-year gap between their last two victories, in 1993 and 2011"
