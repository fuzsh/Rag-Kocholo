        "text": "French forward on fire in Catalunya\n\nHas fired Blancos in Copa del Rey final\n\n60-year wait for treble brought to a close\n\nWHAT HAPPENED? The French striker, who is the current holder of the prestigious Ballon d‚ÄôOr award, was at his brilliant best against Barcelona on Wednesday in the second leg of a heavyweight Copa del Rey semi-final clash. Benzema put in another masterclass of ruthless finishing, as he helped the Blancos to overturn a one-goal first leg deficit, with history being made in the process as he brought a 60-year wait for hat-trick heroics in Catalunya to a close.\n\nüèÜ TOP STORY: Benzema blows Barcelona away\n\nüì£ HAVE YOUR SAY: Is it time for Klopp to leave Liverpool?\n\nüö® MUST READ: PSG would be CRAZY to keep Messi\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: Vinicius Junior opened the scoring for Real against Barca, although Benzema came close to claiming that effort as well as he bundled home from close range just after the ball had crossed the line. The prolific 35-year-old was not to be denied, though, and registered a stunning second-half treble when netting in the 50th, 58th and 81st minutes."
