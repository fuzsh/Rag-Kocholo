        "text": "See also The Terrible Ten. . . . To the Berlin made Flash Gordon\n\nFor background of some ITV Children's serials . . . My research into Romper Room,\n\nDetails of a few BBC Children's serials.\n\nIn these days of whole channels devoted specially to children, it's hard to realise that 5pm each weekday once offered children an hour of programmes dedicated solely to us- before dad came home from work, and while mum got the tea!\n\nThe BBC offered numerous highbrow programmes in the 1950s, the Sunday serials based on classic novels were perhaps the pinnacle, aimed at the family weekend audience. But the BBC also took children to far flung posts of the empire. The trouble was that, frankly, I didn't want more education after a day full of it at school, and with homework also looming! So stuff David Attenborough, to hell with Armand and whatever her name was, bring on Sooty, and Billy Bunter, and Garry Halliday! My least favourite show was Huw Weldon who condescendingly introduced talented youngsters for us to admire, All Your Own, was the programme. It was never mine, the idea was to provoke us into higher things, but it didn't work for me.\n\nPicture Question: Who took over from Harry in the 1970s?

A chamber quartet whose instruments became ever more wildly eccentric, leading to glorious extermination.\n\nThe Family Grocer is Michael Palin whose customer David Jason is served with a tin of boot polish instead of the groceries he requests.\n\nScience for Sixth Forms- this seems to be an echo of a schools broadcast the scriptwriters must have watched. An experiment with a pencil demonstrating gravity- obvious, but a good punchline.\n\nThe Bonzo Band perform a long skit about Frankenstein.\n\nThe Stool Pigeon is a nice take off of the No Hiding Place genre. An incredibly poorly disguised copper infiltrates a villainous gang, with a choice final revelation.\n\nCaptain Fantastic (David Jason)- he receives messages in his lunchbox (well this was really a kids' show), and goes in pursuit of a moving tree.

These were tales about an ordinary middle class family.\n\nConstance Fraser was Mrs Appleyard, Douglas Muir (first series: Frederick Piper) Mr Appleyard. Their children were played by Patricia Fryer /Carole Oliver (Margaret), Derek Rowe (Tommy), David Edwards (John), Dawson France (William) and Sheila Martin (Ann). Other semi-regulars: Barbara Brown as Hazel Foster, Robert Dickens as Ronnie Grant, Tommy's chum, and CB Poultney as Mr Spiller 'The Nuisance.' Also in earlier series Tessa Clarke as Janet Appleyard.\n\nOne interesting appearance came in #9.6 on April 20th 1957, with Susan Hampshire.\n\nHere's my review of the only surviving programme:\n\nSeries 10: Family Treat (December 29th 1956, 5.15pm)\n\nPost Christmas gloom is hovering, \"I don't want to smile.\" Only Tommy is at all jolly, and he proposes cheering everyone up by going to the local panto... he'll pay!\n\nThe only snag is that there are several hangers-on, like Mr Spicer. No matter Mr George Appleyard is volunteered to pay for them. However the gossip is that this is the worst panto ever, which is why tickets have been so easy to come by.\n\nSince Tommy's paying for the family, it is important everyone must pretend they are really enjoying themselves. In fact the theatre is almost empty, the Appleyards' party squashing into a box.\n\nUndoubtedly the gossip is correct, \"it's awful,\" admits Tommy, though everyone shows a brave face, forcing the laughter. Hazel persuades them that they must enjoy themselves. This is a dangerous premise for any story, and it is inevitable that watching the excerpts from Dick Whittington falls flat, because it supposed to be flat. Mr Appleyard is obliged to sing a solo, then a magician enlists Tommy's aid, surely an unwise move, and turns \"really nasty\" when he is upstaged.\n\nAs Tommy's pound note has been burned during the trickery, he cannot stand the supper planned for afterwards, but they are able to buy some fish and chips, and the gloom is lifted when Ronnie shows up to wish them all A Happy New Year\n\nMenu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nGarry Halliday\n\nMy review of the only surviving programme:\n\n3.3 The Outcast (January 30th 1960)\n\nIf you are of a certain age, you will recall BBC's children's Saturday serials starring the dashing pilot played by Terence Longdon. Aided by his faithful but dim friend and co-pilot Bill Dodds (the ever reliable Terence Alexander), the sinister Voice was their arch enemy. He was played by Elwyn Brook-Jones, and I always shivered whenever Halliday brushed with him- he was the ultimate villain! He interviews his accomplices and victims via closed circuit telly. If our faded memories are sometimes over generous to old programmes, I'm pleased to report that seeing Garry Halliday again was every bit as pleasing as over fifty years ago. True I am a trifle older, but though of course this is very dated as regards the cheap sets, it's nevertheless a well done children's drama. Bill Dodds was even more entertaining than I recalled and The Voice was almost as scarey as he appeared to a young lad.\n\nSo popular was the series, that eight six part adventures were screened from 1959 to 1962. Series 4 and 6 were lucky to get one extra part, so altogether 50 half hour stories were made.\n\nThe second series in autumn 1959 had Garry Halliday running his own charter company carrying freight and occasional passengers to Paris. Filming was done at Ferry Field Airport Lydd. Jennifer Wright joined the cast as air hostess Jean, with Richard Warner as Dr Edmundo, in business with The Voice. Also appearing were Jeremy Burnham, Juno Stevas, Hamilton Duce and Frederick Treves, whom I liked very much in this programme.\n\nSeries 3 started in January 1960 and was a story of vanishing scientists. Sadly Elwyn Brooke-Jones died and he vanishes from the programme after this.\n\nThe sixth series in January 1962 was titled Garry Halliday and the Secret of Omar Khayyam. Apart from the main stars, Bill Kerr appeared as Eddie Robins, Maurice Kaufmann as Adolph Traumann, and Hugh Latimer as Temhani.\n\nThe seventh series following on from this one was Garry Halliday and the Gun Runners, again with Bill Kerr, Maurice Kaufmann and Hugh Latimer. Alan Tilvern also featured as General Hasheme. The final series were six self contained adventures.\n\nA contemporary reviewer wrote these words of praise: \"Children must have loved it. I know I did. The characters were vivid, the script was good, often witty. Bill Dodds is talking about his latest girlfriend. 'You wait till you meet her. She's not a bit like me. Just as well really, eh?'\" The reviewer concluded, \"Trouble has been taken over its preparation and whole sections of it were filmed... produced with good pace by Richard West.\"\n\nTo the Children's Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Outcast\n\nHere's the gist of the frightfully BBC voice which recaps the previous two episodes: \"Garry Halliday is up against his old enemy The Voice, now engaged in a colossal scheme to kidnap five world famous atomic scientists and sell them to the highest bidder. Two scientists have already been kidnapped. Now The Voice plans to take another, Professor Mundt and his secretary Martin. At the suggestion of Inspector Potter, Halliday's plane has been chartered to fly Mundt back to Frankfurt, to the annoyance of Mr Smith-Clayton of the Home Office. Bill Dodds is on the plane as well as his fiancee Sonya, who is acting as stewardess. The only others in the plane are three security men, but they are headed by O'Brien, The Voice's principal lieutenant.\"\n\nProf Mundt is seized, despite protests from Smith-Clayton (Peter Myers, who does a fine impression of a British silly ass type).\n\n\"Alter course please, Captain Halliday.\" Has he any choice?\n\nSonya: \"A rather gruesome chap is pointing a gun at me.\" But Bill does his 'card trick,' and in a filmed sequence the result of the punchup is that Garry retakes control. The victorious heroes radio the bad news to their enemy.\n\nThe Voice: \"it's almost a pleasure to have you as my antagonist.\" But he has a card up his sleeve, for Garry's normal stewardess Jean Willis has been kidnapped, and Garry has to concede.\n\nBill remonstrates with his boss in vain over his mysterious change of heart: \"look here, I know I'm a bit of an ass sometimes, but I'm not as stupid as all that.\"\n\nGarry is forced to land in a remote mountainous area, apparently in Switzerland. O'Brien hands him £15,000 to make it seem Garry is in with the gang. Naturally he refuses, but Smith-Clayton sees it as proof that Garry must be a traitor.\n\nWith the gang clearing off with the professor, and the plane disabled, Garry Bill and Sonya start to walk. Garry reaches a telephone exchange and tries to warn Inspector Potter. But local police arrest him.\n\nThe Voice gloats to Jean, revealing this scheme to discredit Halliday. And once thoroughly disgraced The Voice is going to enjoy killing him, \"humanely if possible.\"\n\nThere's an angry scene in the police station. Our heroes are locked in a cell, \"what are we going to do, Garry?\"\n\nSadly, I don't think we're ever going to find out\n\nTo Garry Halliday\n\nTo the Children's Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Flower of Gloster (Granada, 1967)\n\nOriginally planned in 10 parts but shown in 13. In the title role is a 72ft canal barge, that starts its journey in Wales, making its way by 220 miles of canal to the Pool of London. It is supposed to be delivered there by a boatyard owner, who falls ill, so his children Mike aged 10 and Liz aged 12 with the help of old friends Richard and Annette, deliver it for him. Deadline date is July 14th. Actual shooting began towards the end of May 1967. The older children are: Richard O'Callaghan (Richard) and Annette Robertson (Annette). The youngsters: Elizabeth Doherty (Elizabeth) and Michael Doherty (Michael). Script: Chris McMaster- though a lot of the dialogue seems improvised, only O'Callaghan at all comfortable with this. Director: Mike Beckham. Producer: Bill Grundy.\n\nAmazingly, this was Granada's first belated attempt at a children's drama serial, and it sure shows. The story cannot decide if it is drama, comedy or documentary, and trying to be all three, it falls between all three camps. Following the tradition of the Children's Film Foundation, little effort is made to obtain young child actors who can actually act, giving the production an appallingly amateur feel, only compensated by the fine location shooting.\n\n1 The Accident (Wednesday September 27th 1967 5.25pm)- July 4th: restoration of the barge is complete, Jim and his eldest son Dick are to deliver it from North Wales to London when Jim collapses. We have met his children cycling on the Llangollen viaduct- Mike even falls in! Under Dick's charge, with Liz as his second in command, the barge sets off. Rival to reach London first is Evans, another barge owner (Talfryn Thomas)\n\n2 The Cut- Along Chirk Viaduct the barge begins its (very) slow progress, Mike cycling as far as the tunnel to see them off. Is it Liz's fault that the barge gets damaged? She fetches help, while to fill in time, Mike wanders off to learn about boat restoration. Up and running again, Liz cooks a bite for Dick to eat, the result is that the barge runs into the bank. Another near disaster is when she takes the tiller, but then decides she can also do the washing up. They bump, literally, into old Charlie, a barge man through and through for some extempore chat. Then they reach their first lock. Here Dick is sent the odd message, where is Mike?\n\n3 The Boy- The industrial landscape around the Anderton Boat Lift where the engine overheats delaying progress. Liz finds Mike hiding in the hold. Next morning we spend a lot of time watching them wake up\n\n4 The Girl- Audlem Locks where Mike and Liz start some horseplay and leave it to Dick. Liz goes shopping and Mike learns about a coal barge. After Dick tells them off, Mike takes the tiller and runs down a dinghy. Dick rescues the nice girl in it from drowning and retrieves her things. Her name is Anne, and she's stranded. Come with us, suggests Dick\n\n5 Betton Woods- An angry barge owner warns that these woods are haunted. Running out of fuel, they have to moor here overnight, \"I don't like it.\" Like two babes in the wood, Mike and Liz go exploring, Dick and Anne miss them and search for them. A few spooky noises is the sum total of their scares, and these come from some badger expert who tells them all about his hobby\n\n6 The Dog- Anne punts as Dick tows the barge \"only a mile.\" A horse helps them reach Market Drayton where they take on fuel. To pay for repairs to Anne's dinghy, Dick strips down a rowing boat, while Mike has to peel spuds. Anne befriends a stray dog which joins the party, they name it Baskerville\n\n7 Lost- this is actually a story! The wretched Baskerville runs off, the gormless Mike pursues and disappears. An angry Dick moors at Wolverhampton to reprimand Mike on his return, \"this is not a pleasure trip.\" Anne's navigational skills lead them into a dead end, where yobs pelt them with stones. Dick grabs one of the horrors, forcing them to tow the barge for a distance\n\n8 The City- Day Six, the barge is stuck in mud. They are helped to get moving by a man who tells them the history of industrial canals for ages. While Dick arranges to earn some extra cash, the children shop at the Bullring, Liz buys useless stuff, Anne helps a lost boy, Mike is carted away by police, while Dick waits impatiently for them to return\n\n9 Life and Death- 'Chocolate' Charlie helps them tow through 50 locks to Braunston Junction. Here they meet up again with Jack. Liz has to fetch a midwife, and they make way for a funeral barge, before entering The Tunnel\n\n10 The Tunnel- Blisworth, the longest tunnel on their journey, spookily interesting. Engine trouble strikes, \"we'll never get out of 'ere.\" But they do, by \"legging\" it, then Mike explores the waterways museum\n\n11 The Deadline- an episode with more structure. 65 miles to go, and three days to make it! But Newell the new owner of The Gloster says he wants his boat by tomorrow! However the children don't know that, and are messing about in a dinghy. Then they enjoy themselves in the maze at Woburn, an improvised game of the Frontier. After a trip to the fairground, Mike gets himself lost inside the abbey. He's found in Victoria's bedroom, and they dash off, \"we'll never make it!\" (Not sure if the lady who shows them round Woburn Abbey is the Duchess herself, Nicole Milinaire formerly a tv producer of series such as Sherlock Holmes, Dick and the Duchess- be nice if it was)\n\n12 The Hitch- a torch is the only help as they travel through the night, only stopped by an obstreperous lockkeeper. Now it's a race to get to London ahead of Dan Evans' boat, The Vigilant (last seen in story #1). Some naughty sabotage sees The Gloster drifting with \"a hell of a bang.\" The rudder is jammed, valuable hours lost releasing it\n\n13 Late - The boat is spruced up as they travel through Little Venice. Evans on The Vigilant tries a last trick, sending his son Dai to set the locks around Kentish Town against the Gloster. The Vigilant catches them up and takes a different route to the Thames. Anne is left to steer the barge while Dick cycles to The Vigilant and shoves Evans in the canal! They find a river pilot to take them on the Thames, under Tower Bridge, past the Houses of Parliament to meet the buyer Mr Newell at Lambeth Pier. It is noticeable that by now Mike and Liz are hardly involved at all\n\nChildren's Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nORLANDO (1965-8, Rediffusion)\n\nAn interesting series, a spin-off from the series Crane, but screened on children's tv. Crane has quit Morocco, so his sidekick Orlando returns to Britain to run a boatyard. The opening theme music was 'Walk in a Nightmare,' (aka Hellraisers) and by contrast, the stories ended with 'Make Us Laugh.'\n\nMy review of 2.27 Rhyme- But No Reason (11th October 1966).\n\nNo sign of the divers who have been exploring the cave, Orlando and Co are scouring the seas from the cliff top. \"We have to do something,\" but wise Orlando knows that all that can be done is wait.\n\nOne of the explorers, Trevor (John Steiner), Miss Tully's nephew, leaves Steve behind in the cave. Orlando perceives that Steve must be \"in serious trouble,\" so descends the cliff face to the rescue.\n\nTrevor's actions convince Jenny that he must be one who killed his uncle, but Miss Tully just cannot accept this. To find out the truth Jenny goes off to look in Cmdr Tully's yacht for his missing diary.\n\nIn the cave Orlando discovers an unconscious Steve. Trevor must have done it. Even Miss Tully has to reluctantly agree, \"he might have killed you.\"\n\nThe secret message is now in Orlando's hands, but what on earth does it mean?\n\nIn a candle H and R\n\nTake you to a place not far\n\nWhere the cranes can never fly\n\nYet they soar towards the sky\n\nStart here go left and left once more\n\nWhich brings you to the secret door\n\nThere's no red herring to this clue\n\nBut a Jack to Gill will give it you.\n\n\"Haven't a clue what it means.\" After his adventures, Orlando is laid up in bed, but at least that gives him ample time to study this puzzle. Steve tumbles to the menaing of one line, Zoo, that's where cranes never fly.\n\nIn Jenny's unsuccessful search for the diary on the yacht, she stumbles on this message also, but is stopped in her tracks by Trevor, who must have that diary as well. At a chandlery, Trevor and his mate bust in, \"the stakes must be very high\"\n\nTo Children's Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Barnstormers\n\n3 The Lost Treasure 5 The Trap 6 Camberley's Quest 7 The Spanish Casket 8 A Door to Nowhere 9 Rusty in Danger, 10 Old Alexander's Secret\n\nGood to report that the series has been partly rescued, Unlike many CFF films, the children's acting in this is not amateurish. That most interesting child star Dennis Waterman appeared as Mike, Gerald Rowland as Rusty, Peter Hempson as Philip, Patricia Wilson as Sarah, and John Pike (late of 'Ivanhoe' and 'The Old Pull n Push') as Alan. Tina Martin as Miranda, Susan Purdie as Elizabeth and Jeffrey Shankley as Peter appeared after the first story. Joy Thwaites wrote the scripts, and the director was Marc Miller.\n\nThe five children, their leader Mike, decide to form their own dramatic society and write and produce their own play. But they need to find a suitable venue and hit on a deserted 18th century water mill that stands in a stream outside their village. As the production takes shape they discover interesting facts about the mill. One rumour claims a pirate once lived here and hid his treasure within its walls. Secret passages and a concealed trapdoor confirm the tale. A property speculator hears about the treasure and attempts to buy the mill for redevelopment.\n\nThe first episode was screened March 3rd 1964. It was 'Mystery at the Mill' in which the children, wanting to make the most of their holidays, try to join The Tudor Players. They are also intrigued by a strange light in an old mill. Also in this story were Gillian Webb as Miss Brentford and Peggy Ann Wood as Mrs Smith.\n\nEpisode 2 (Mar 10th)- also appearing were Gillian Webb, and Nadine Hanwell.\n\nEpisode 3 was 'The Lost Treasure' (Mar 17th) and introduced Henry Soskin as Mr Selbourne, whom Sarah and Rusty meet as they start rehearsals for their play.\n\nEpisode 4 was 'Enter a Stranger' (Mar 24th) in which the future of the Mill is threatened.\n\nEpisode 5 (Mar 31st) The Trap\n\nEpisode 6 was 'Camberley's Quest' (April 7th) in which the mystery of the casket grows deeper.

Mike leads the gang down steps which lead to the river, \"nothing much to see,\" is the disappointing verdict. However Philip spots AM, standing for the pirate Alexander Martin, scratched on the wall.\n\nPhilip is the outsider, secretive about his family, the others feel. The children prepare for rehearsals, finding their own costumes. Mike plays Fernando, and speaks with a foreign accent. After a few technical problems are resolved, Philip shows up as chief of police, nicely overacting. He and Mike have a stage fight, \"are you all right?\" Rusty finds this unconvincing. He is still eager to find the treasure.\n\nWith Sarah, he goes in search of a casket suitable for a prop. On film we see them walking along the village and entering a shop owned by Mr Selbourne, who tells them how, when a lad himself, he searched in the mill for the treasure. \"Did you ever find it?\" No, but Martin vanished one night, nobody knows where to. He shows them a painting of Martin's daughter, he calls her \"beautiful\" though the children are dubious about that.\n\nIt is Philip who discovers a casket for their play, and look, it's just like the one in the painting of Miss Martin!\n\nBarnstomers\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n5 The Trap\n\nWho has slunk into the mill and destroyed the children's model of a rocket? Who was last to leave? Alan.\n\nHe is evasive, but is surprised to see the broken rocket, \"it wasn't me.\" He admits he had gone back to the mill in search of the secret tunnel, but without success. But he remembers spotting a green van nearby. Alan notices the intruder had dropped a chewing gum wrapper. It's a clue.\n\nAt the shop, Mr Selborne is taking delivery of some furniture, from delivery lad Joe. With his nephew Edward, he speculates on the identity of a stranger who has purchased two candlesticks. This man Ludgate is very keen on buying the mill.\n\nA fountain pen provides another clue. Three of the children go in search of the green van, they see it driving away. Eddie is able to tell the children who drives the van.\n\nWhile they have gone, the stranger arrives at the mill in his Jag. Rusty is on guard, and watches the man nosing around. He picks up the casket. Seeing Rusty, he offers him ten shillings for it. The price is upped to £2, \"no thank you.\"\n\nJoe is back at the mill searching for his pen. He teases Rusty, and to teach him to keep away from the mill, the children set a trap. Mr Selborne and Eddie are informed by the children of a secret, which they pass on to Joe, \"they think they've found the treasure.\"\n\nHere comes Joe with his two mates. They are encased in a net and smothered in feathers, all jolly fun. But that stranger phones his boss Camberley, about his plans to demolish the mill\n\nBarnstomers\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nCamberley's Quest\n\nLudgate is ordered by Camberley, his brother-in-law, to get that casket off the children. He calls at Selborne's shop to examine the painting of the woman with the casket- so he can be sure of getting hold of the right casket.\n\nThe children are making papier mache props for their play, and have scheduled it for the 20th. Tickets will sell at two shillings, and Sarah proposes they donate some of their profits to the starving of the world. Everyone will invite their families, all except Philip.\n\nConcerned about the fight scene, they approach Eddie for advice. He agrees to come and watch their next rehearsal, \"quite a play!\" He suggests an ending to parallel the beginning.\n\nWhile they rehearse, Ludgate sneaks into the mill, spots the casket, and takes it away. But he is stopped. \"We don't want to sell it,\" they tell him. Eddie recognises him. \"I assure you it's not for sale.\" Exit Ludgate, with dark muttering about the mill being pulled down. He reports back to Camberley, who is naturally not pleased.\n\nPhilip asks Mr Selborne about the casket, and learns what the letters on it mean.\n\nLudgate returns to the mill and seizes the casket, covering it with newspaper, and this time he gets away with it. The children find it missing- he has left a £5 note\n\nBarnstomers\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Spanish Casket\n\n\"I've never seen a £5 note.\" But how much is the casket actually worth? Philip believes it to be \"a priceless antique,\" as they start arguing about the disappearance of their casket. Sarah tells Eddie, who worries \"they'll take it to London.\"\n\nThey scour the town in search of the thief. It's Rusty who spots Ludgate, who tells his boss Joe Camberley that he has been followed. That's true! The children accost him in a teashop, and swap the parcel he is carrying for a cheap imitation casket, wrapped in newspaper.\n\nLudgate warns them to keep away from the mill, because the new owner is going to pull it down. \"Keep out of the mill,\" reiterates Joe, even though in actual fact he has not completed the purchase of it. There's a nice moment as Camberley unwraps the newspaper to discover the fake casket.\n\nMr Selbourne is very excited when Philip shows him the casket. The letters on it, V - II look like Roman numerals.\n\nBack at the mill the children enjoy something like a midnight feast. Philip explains the numerals, clue to the opening of the secret passage. They discover a rusty handle and eventually get it pulled, revealing a damp passageway. Since it is so dark, they decide, perhaps improbably, to get some equipment and explore on the morrow. One snag however is that Philip's diary is missing and the children fall out when he accuses them of hiding it, \"I'm not coming back.\"\n\nAn enjoyable episode with darkly lit scenes and lots of jolly fun\n\nBarnstomers\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nA Door to Nowhere\n\nWhy has Philip gone off in a huff? The children start arguing, bad timing, with dress rehearsal tomorrow. Rusty is all for exploring the tunnel now, \"I wasn't going far.\" He's certain they'll find a treasure in there.\n\nBeatrice (Nora Nicholson), with whom Philip is staying, advises him \"to make his own way.\" His resentment is better understood by the other children, when they find a newspaper cutting about his parents' death in an air crash.\n\nWithout Philip, Eddie has to help out, though rehearsals encounter some problems, exacerbated by Rusty's unintentional errors.\n\nA young reporter comes to watch them as Eddie demonstrates how to make a person up to look old \"with shadows and wrinkles.\"\n\nBeatrice warns Philip that though the tunnel is \"exciting,\" it is also very dangerous, so \"forget about it, it leads nowhere.\" The reporter is shown the entrance by Rusty.\n\nThe Alderman (AJ Brown) investigates complaints about \"hooligans\" at the mill, \"you've no right to be here.\" However they explain that they have permission from Beatrice. So he stays and watches their rehearsal.\n\nEver more impatient, Rusty commences to explore the tunnel on his own.\n\nNote: end credits missing\n\nBarnstomers\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRusty in Danger\n\nRusty has left the rehearsal, to search for the treasure in the tunnel. The alderman and reporter are enjoying the play, \"everything like a real theatre.\" Backstage Philip reflects with Alan about his parents' air crash.\n\nThe alderman allays their fears about Ludgate, \"you're not hooligans,\" and the children resolve to get the historic barn listed. Eddie suggests a newspaper article to promote their cause.\n\n\"Where's Rusty?\" They hear his dog howling below, and Mike and Philip go into the tunnel to find him. Sarah has to stay at the tunnel entrance, it's \"cold, goes on for miles.\" Rusty creeps along, \"I've been miles and miles and miles.\" Noises make him scared. \"The sooner we find Rusty and get out of here, the better.\"\n\nThe alderman is teaing with Beatrice, who becomes alarmed when she hears about their exploring the \"dangerous\" tunnel. Her brother John had nearly died in it.\n\nSarah decides she's waited long enough, and goes for help, \"I do hope nothing awful's happened.\" Inside the tunnel, Rusty slips, \"I think I'm stuck.\" Mike finds a chocolate paper, \"that means Rusty's still down here.\" A rumbling noise, of the swelling river. As the rumbling increases they find Rusty at last, but how to get him free?\n\nBarnstomers\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOld Alexander's Secret\n\n\"It just happened,\" moans Rusty, stuck in the tunnel, \"I'll be here for ever and ever.\" But he is freed by Mike and Philip, yet a small fall blocks their quick exit, \"the roof is caved in.\"\n\nSarah has dashed to get Alan to help, and they peer into the dark tunnel, and hear the noise of the rising river. Sarah goes to phone for more help- from Eddie this time. He warns her not to go down the tunnel.\n\nThe three lads \"can't get back to the mill.\" Philip suggests they try going down the tunnel, which they do, Rusty ever hopeful of finding the treasure. It's exciting but scarey, picking their way along the damp tunnel, and they stumble on an old chest. Locked! But Rusty is triumphant.\n\nAlan and Eddie wait at the mill while firemen, unseen, unblock the tunnel.\n\nThe chest is opened, but disappointingly all that is inside is \"a real gun\" and a key. But a key \"to what?\" They explore further and come across a ladder. Up they climb.\n\nBeatrice is sitting quietly at home when a creaking sound greets her ears. It's the boys- \"we didn't mean to frighten you.\"\n\nHappy again, the Barnstormers prepare for their play, Eddie their producer. There's good news about the mill, for Beatrice has decided not to sell it.\n\nOnly the one disappointment. \"There wasn't any treasure,\" sighs Rusty. But that key fits their casket, and inside, amazingly, they discover diamonds!\n\nBarnstomers\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nORLANDO.

I was brought up on this latter, and recall poignant scenes such as the terrible moment when father is taken away, the kindly Old Gentleman, and of course the happy reunion. That wonderful composition by Grieg so well fits the mood of the story.\n\nIn this version Jenny Agutter played Bobbie, a role she was to recreate in Lionel Jeffries' better known 1970 film version. The other children were replaced in the film, a pity, because the youngest Phyllis is always the best part and Gillian Bailey gives her an enthusiastic quality even if she falters at times. Neil McDermott as Peter seems not to have had any other screen roles. The reliable Gordon Gostelow is Perks, more authentic for me than the film version, though perhaps Mother (Ann Castle) doesn't make quite the appealing impact as that of Dinah Sheridan's film character.\n\nIn June 2017, Gilli Bush-Bailey (Phyll) wrote to me: \"I remember the excitement of night-filming on the train and the cold of Yorkshire in March and then the sunny days too as we sat on the fence for the title sequence the fun of it all and the strange rags put in my hair overnight so I had suitably curly hair in the morning . I was 12 years of age . A long time ago . But lovely memories\" To Children's Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1 The Visitors\n\nPlaying with Peter's new clockwork train in their cosy suburban home, young Phyllis causes the engine to crash. But rely on their father, Tom, when he comes home, he'll mend it!\n\nWhen he does get in he's tired, but kindly examines the broken locomotive. \"Is there any hope?\" Perhaps there is for the train, but not for father when two strange men come knocking at their door. It makes for a poignant scene as heated voices can be heard in the adjacent room before father makes a hurried departure, \"It's a mistake,\" are his parting words.\n\nRuth the maid (Mary Healey, not convincing) won't reveal anything to the children as she tucks them in bed. Mother looks in evidently distressed, whispering to Bobbie the eldest, \"I can't tell you anything more tonight, love.\"\n\nIn their posh sitting room next morning, mother explains she's going to be very busy, for they are going to move to the country, adding ominously, \"we're going to be very poor.\" The volatile Ruth is sacked for nearly blurting out the story, indeed there are to be few comforts when they quit their suburban luxury. Nevertheless they can still manage a taxi to take them to the station! Their destination, Waterloo, while a Great Western locomotive transports them a long, long way.\n\nIt's night when they reach their lonely destination, Perks the Porter, a friendly face, directs them to Three Chimneys. \"It looks so dark,\" but kindly Perks loans them a lantern for the walk.\n\nHousekeeper Mrs Viney ought to have got things ready, but she hasn't. The cottage is so bare compared with their London home. No fire, no food!\n\nTo Railway Children\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n2 The Coalminers\n\nIt's no easy job lighting a fire with damp sticks. Bobbie can't manage it. And washing is no fun either, using the pump with only cold water.\n\nThe children wave to a passing train, then walk on to the station to return Mr Perks' lantern. The friendly porter kindly gives them \"a tour of inspection\" before they go back home for breakfast. The house is still very cold, but mother has found where the provisions are so the food warms them up.\n\nMother is attempting to write stories to earn some money, but her room where she writes is very cold. Peter thinks he has an idea.\n\nHe and Bobbie help themselves to some of Mr Perks' coal supply while Phyl distracts the porter with reminiscences of his childhood. This ploy works for several visits, Perks remembering his own naughty days outwitting a farmer, nicely echoing the children's own antics.\n\nNow mother can write in warmth, until that inevitable day when Perks catches them at it, \"got you, me young varmint.\" Even more cutting is his \"I thought you were my friend,\" to Phyllis.\n\nHis Nibs, the stationmaster, is apprised, he's the man to deal with them. He uses the word \"stealing.\" But their motive strikes a chord, and Bobbie apologises, and so they are forgiven, \"jolly decent.\"\n\nContrite, they return home. A nice little vignette of childhood innocence\n\nTo Railway Children\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n3 The Message\n\nAfter returning from London, a tired mother seems to be hiding something from Bobbie. They have a heart to heart about father who is \"abroad,\" that's what mother says. She does seem unwell and having retired to bed, Phyllis asks the doctor to visit.\n\nDr Forrest diagnoses a fever and prescribes medicines and food to help cure her. But how to pay?\n\nPeter has dared to go back to the station to collect a parcel, and had been relieved to find the stationmaster promising to let \"bygones be bygones.\"\n\nWaving to a passing train, an old gentleman in the first class carriage kindly waves back to the children. That gives Peter an idea. He tears up a sheet and paints a message on it. When the train next passes the old gentleman sees the message to watch for Phyll at the station. She hands him an appeal for help. Bobbie has had her own scheme, asking Dr Forrest if he can be paid on an installment scheme.\n\nPerks brings up a basket to Three Chimneys. It's sent \"from your friend on the 9.15,\" the old gentleman. Perks adds his own offering of sweet briar cuttings.\n\nMother is on the mend, pronounces Dr Forrest and she is able to come downstairs, to a meal cooked by Bobbie. They have to explain how they have been helped to a shocked mother. \"Who is this man?\" All they can reply is, \"he's not really a stranger.\" No, he certainly wasn't\n\nTo Railway Children\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n4 The Foreign Gentleman\n\nThe children are waiting for the 3.27 train, mother has gone to see a solicitor. He is advising her not to proceed.\n\nA passenger alights from a train, he has a hat and a beard, foreign. Perks wants his ticket, but he seems not to understand. Passengers gather round, as well as the three children, trying to work out what language he speaks.\n\nPeter has a smattering of French and this prompts the man to issue of torrent of French which Peter can't hope to grasp. Wait for Mother, she can speak the language. As they wait, Peter shows the visitor his stamp collection, and works out the man is Russian.\n\nMother is soon conversing with him. His name is Ivan, a famous author whose family had been deported. He's looking for them in this country having been released from prison himself. Ivan is taken to Three Chimneys, though Dr Forrest confides to Mother that he doubts the wisdom of harbouring such a person.\n\nPeter's brilliant scheme is to ask The Old Gentleman to locate Ivan's family. They leave a letter to him with the stationmaster. Mr Inglewood that's the Old Gentleman's name, and 'His Nibs' is mightily impressed that the children know him.\n\nDays later, Perks, seemingly the postman, delivers Mr Inglewood's reply. It's good news, he has made \"all the necessary arrangements.\" But less good news, for among the old newspapers Perks brings, Bobbie notices an article about her father's imprisonment. Phyll notices that Bobbie is upset, in a superb scene, a tearful Bobbie doggedly keeping the dark truth to herself.\n\nNext morning a more cheerful Ivan bids farewell and Dr Forrest sees his train off\n\nTo Railway Children\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n5 The Secret\n\n\"What's he done wrong?\" Bobbie asks her mother about her father's imprisonment. And when told the answer is nothing, \"that's not fair.\" But mother is fighting to get the case reopened.\n\nPeter and Phyllis speculate on what the pair can be talking about. \"A talking-to,\" they decide it must be.\n\nA worried mother asks Dr Forrest privately about Bobbie. \"She'll grow up,\" he confidently asserts.\"\n\nThen it's down to the station to see Perks, only to find they must have offended him somehow. Some secret they have kept from him. Gradually he gets it out, something to do with his missing the farewell to the foreign \"prince.\" Something about their not \"letting him in on things.\"\n\nPeter finally puts his request, the reason why they have come. To get his clockwork locomotive repaired. Perks says he'll \"think about\" it.\n\nThe three children are playing when they see a tree falling on the railway line (though it looks more a branch to me). As they fail to shift it, Bobbie and Phyll remove their red petticoats to wave and warn the driver of the next train, \"it's coming!\"\n\nRather too quickly, the express does stop. Bobbie faints. But the train is saved.\n\nDown at the station the stationmaster and Perks are puzzling why the \"fast\" hasn't yet come through. Peter and Phyllis dash in to enlighten them.\n\nBobbie is taken home where kindly Dr Forrest pronounces she'll soon be \"as right as rain.\" Perks brings his \"hearty vote of thanks,\" and, more sheepishly, their petticoats, and apologises for his former abruptness. A happy scene as he confides to Phyll that there'll be an official vote of thanks shortly\n\nTo Railway Children\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n6 The Rescue\n\nFrom Jabez Inglewood, to the three railway children, an invitation to a presentation in honour of their great deed.\n\nThey don their Sunday best for the great occasion, \"you do look nice.\" Down at the station, it is all spruced up, Perks providing flowers from his own garden.\n\nTo rousing cheers, and a speech from their old gentleman himself, the children receive hearty congratulations, as well as presentation watches. Peter tries to reply with his thanks, off the cuff, \"it was rather fun,\" he admits. Light refreshments follow, during which Bobbie takes aside Mr Inglewood, and shows him the press cutting about her father's imprisonment. Bobbie explains her mother had tried everyone she could to help exonerate him, and now she's \"so thin and tired looking.\" Her rather naive appeal touches him though he is rather nonplussed, \"I remember the case distinctly.\" He promises to look into it though he \"cannot guarantee anything.\"\n\nThere's one further request, this from Phyllis to the \"engineer,\" the train driver involved in that rescue. As Perks can't manage to mend Peter's broken locomotive, could he? He says he'll take it to the repair shed.\n\nDays later, a paper chase with boys from the local school. The children watch as the hare runs past, pursued by the pack. The route goes through the railway tunnel (surely their headmaster would be sacked nowadays for infringing health and safety?). At the other end, the children watch them emerge, but for some reason there's one lad less, so the children resolve to find out if he's stuck in the pitch black tunnel.\n\n\"I want to go back,\" cries Phyll. As they grope through the darkness, a train hurtles into the mouth of the tunnel, and the children have to dodge into a recess in the wall\n\nTo Railway Children\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7 The Meeting\n\nA train flashes past in the dark tunnel, then, alone, Peter searches for the boy. Groans point him in the right direction and there's Jim (Christopher Witty) lying in the middle of the track, his ankle injured. In the dark, the two girls join them.\n\nWith another train due (how the last missed Jim, who knows?), Peter and Phyllis run to the signalbox and the signalman wires a warning to Mr Barnes. Bobbie comforts Jim who is in some pain and they talk and hold hands. Rescue arrives and Mr Perks helps Jim to Three Chimneys. A reluctant mother makes him comfy, and there's a surprise for them all when it turns out Jim is in the care of his grandfather who is none other than Mr Inglewood! He visits his grandson and thanks everyone, finishing with a quiet word to Bobbie. He's hopeful of some good news soon.\n\nDr Forrest is soon able to declare Jim is well enough to return to school. \"A swiz,\" declares Peter, and Jim's sorry to leave also. So is Bobbie, as the three children bid him farewell.\n\nBut when The Green Dragon passes, all the passengers mysteriously cheer, Dr Forrest smiles over the \"wonderful news,\" and all the locals greet Bobbie warmly as she undertakes an errand down to the station. Here Mr Perks and the stationmaster greet her royally, Mr Perks with a blushing kiss, then the famous scene of father stepping off the train, nicely understated compared with Lionel Jeffries' film version. That is dramatic and atmospheric, this is merely over in a flash, but it is equally effective with the lovely theme music gentle in the background as the two leave the station and wend their way to Three Chimneys. Peter and Phyll each receive a big hug then mother and father quietly walk into the house. Outside, the three railway children dash down to the trackside for a final happy wave to the next train\n\nTo Railway Children\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMr Pastry (BBC)\n\nRichard Hearne was a superb children's entertainer, now unjustly neglected by a generation who thirst after crudity in humour, a thing that Richard always vehemently avoided.\n\nHis long running appearances on Children's Television made for gentle fun-loving enjoyment, that us innocent children thoroughly appreciated. He made many one off short films, but I think the first series was Mr Pastry's Progress, fifteen minute stories, shown in late 1950/ early 1951. Three series were made in the early Sixties- details. In these, I particularly liked Barbara Hicks as Miss Print, a fine foil to Pastry's antics.\n\nIt seems very few of his tv shows both for BBC and also ITV survive. If you have any of his tv programmes or can add more data, I'd love to hear from you! Most interesting to see, would be his 1957 A-R series for adults, Highland Fling. And of course, we can only speculate how his interpretation of Dr Who might have turned out. However, thankfully, some of his numerous Ed Sullivan TV Shows in America are still around as are his British feature films.\n\nMr Pastry Learns to Ski\n\nA 1956 BBC film short as Mr Pastry demonstrates how not to ski. Fairly predictable clowing around on Norway's ski slopes, some scenes shot in Geilo, accompanied by a dreadfully typical running commentary of the era. Mr Pastry leaves his hotel to suffer an avalanche of snow from the roof. Then to the ski school where he knocks over all the other pupils like ninepins. Lesson One is on a slalom, after smashing through the gates Mr Pastry narrowly misses careering into a train. He takes a railway trolley and narrowly escapes crashing into a huge express. Next day on the bobsleigh he zooms downhill, faster and faster, don't panic, the steering wheel has come off in his hand! He winds up on a rooftop, in one piece. Then it's the plane home, he leans out of the cockpit to wave goodbye\n\nAsk Mr Pastry\n\n7 Forty Eight Hours' Rest (May 6th 1961)\n\nAccording to Mrs Spindle, Mr Pastry is doing the oddest of things, he has despatched soap flakes instead of cornflakes to one mystified customer. The vicar has another complaint, instead of the underwear he has ordered, he has been sent some frilly knickers. Perhaps Mr Pastry has been overdoing it. He needs some peace and quiet for a man his age.\n\nBut to young Stoker, he proves he is at the peak of his powers. He jumps over some chairs, then leaps over a wall very acrobatically. But Miss Print insists, \"get him to bed at once!\"\n\nMr Pastry explains to Stoker that there is nothing wrong with him, though perhaps he is worried about the forthcoming band contest, as well as the need to call the plumber. However, merely to please Mrs Spindle, he does agree to take to his bed.\n\nThe spare room, she orders. Stoker is happy to sort out the bandsman who needs extra practice, and call the plumber over the faulty tap.\n\nAfter some nicely timed slapstick with his waistcoat, Mr Pastry really decides he has been overdoing it, and is tucked into bed. Of course that is the start of his troubles. Miss Print kindly plugs in an electric blanket, which promptly blows up, then the vicar sends some large flowers which tickle him and droop over his bed. Then the phone rings, no rest here. Mr Pastry chucks the offending objects out of his window, so there is no rest for the poor policeman standing outside his window!\n\n\"You're being a bit baughty,\" he is ticked off. The phone rings yet again, in a typical Mr Pastry sequence of mayhem, building up with more objects out the window, kindly friends returning them, the plumbers badly fixing the pipes so the wall collapses, water everywhere\n\nReturn sadly to the Children's Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nA little more about BBC Television Series with Mr Pastry\n\nRichard Hearne's final three series were\n\n1 Ask Mr Pastry (1961)\n\n2 Mr Pastry's Progress (1962)\n\n3 Mr Pastry's Pet Shop (November/ December 1962)\n\nRichard Hearne starred in these series of six stories each. The scripts for Ask Mr Pastry were written by Patrick Campbell and Vivienne Knight. The producer was David Goddard. He also produced Mr Pastry's Progress, and Mr Pastry's Pet Shop, these scripts by James Cairncross.\n\nMr Pastry was supported in the series by Barbara Hicks as Miss Print. Scruffy the dog played Buckingham in series 2.\n\nDetails of other stories appreciated\n\nMr Pastry main page\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBONEHEAD (1960-2)\n\nOne of BBC Children's Television great comedies written and produced by Shaun Sutton, who described the series as \"a weekly reminder that crime doesn't pay.\" A one-off made its mark in 1957, leading, after a long pause, to this run of three series, which launched three and a half years later.\n\nThe ever popular Colin Douglas was in the title role, \"an amiable, gentle giant, eager to carry out The Boss' last order- if only he could remember what it was.\" The Boss, played by the superb Paul Whitsun-Jones, was \"bursting with boyish enthusiasm,\" longing to be \"the Napoleon of the Underworld.\" The absurdly named Happy was portrayed by Douglas Blackwell. He gloomily follows from disaster to disaster, pessimistically certain of failure.\n\n1.5 Going Straight (Sat Oct 29th 1960, 5.25pm) - As Boss and Happy emerge from jail, Boney greets them with \"did you have a nice time?\" Efforts to keep in paid employment end in sackings but a fortuitous discovery of a stolen safe by Bonehead leads our gang to a warehouse. The Plan: drop the safe from a great height to smash it open. Posing as policemen they proceed to the tall building. However, there they meet up with an old safe cracker friend, who kindly opens their safe for them, only to learn it is empty. Arrival of the real police results in a Keystone Cops-type chase\n\n3.1 Let's Pretend (July 14th 1962)- The Boss' latest plan: Rescue eccentric shortsighted millionaire Mr Popkiss (Reginald Barratt) and claim £50 a time for each saving act. Disguised as a plumber, a gardener and a window cleaner our gang calls at his mansion. The old bucket on top of the head trick fails, as well as falling into the lily pond, so it's desperate measures: blow the house up! But this only results in a flooding farce, into which falls quite unnoticed the pathetic Popkiss. Maybe this was nearly the pinnacle of black and white children's tv comedy\n\nChildren's Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFreewheelers\n\nSouthern TV's most successful serial ran for 104 episodes (eight series of thirteen stories each) between 1968 and 1973. Producer Chris McMaster said Freewheelers was not intended to be \"way out, with it or trendy. Scientific facts would be correct and the deadly devices within the bounds of possibility,\" although he did admit his plots were influenced by Danger Man and The Avengers. Certainly the first few series achieved a fine balance of thrills and fun, deserving to be placed alongside these great series, if only in a junior capacity.\n\nThe first serial entitled Menace! in 5 episodes starred Geoffrey Toone as the villain Von Gelb, and\n\nRonald Leigh-Hunt as Col Buchan (not episodes 1 and 2), with the children Tom Owen as Bill Cowan, Gregory Phillips as Chris Kelly (not 1.1), Mary Maude as Terry Driver, plus Ronald Govey (Monk) and Michael Brennan (Boone), Script: James Hopes.\n\nLocation shooting for series 1 was done in Portland, Botley, Portsmouth, Hayling Island, the Isle of Wight, and Southampton Docks.\n\n1.1 The Sleepers (April 4th 1968) - my review\n\n1.2 No Smoke (April 11th 1968) - my review\n\nAlso in this episode were: Ivan Beavis (Bryant), John Swindells (Alf), and Michael Murray (Cmdr Bell).\n\n1.3 The Camp (April 18th 1968) - my review.

Ronald Leigh-Hunt is the only original cast member left, and there are now children stars in Wendy Padbury as Sue Craig, Adrian Wright as Mike Hobbs, and Leonard Gregory as Steve Walker.\n\n6.1 Nero (September 27th 1971) - Ryan and Burke (Richard Shaw and Michael Ripper) have escaped prison and are lurking on Shanklin Pier where Steve, Mike and Sue spot them. But they run off and land in a crumbling mansion where Professor Nero (Jerome Willis) recruits them to rob a ship, The Dragon, of the cargo of gold bullion worth six million that it is transporting. Now this ship happens to be where our Three are working as waiters...\n\n6.2 Operation Seagull - The gas Somnol has knocked out nearly everyone on The Dragon, enabling Ryan and Burke to remove the crates of gold. But Mike and Steve hide in the boxes and are able to alert Col Buchan that their hq is Bickley Manor, where the gold is melted down into frying pans. The money raised from their sale will fund Nero's ace project\n\n6.3 Medusa - The Department of Oceanography Cambridge is where Professor John Barnet, now missing, had worked on making larger plankton to solve the world food shortage, code name Medusa, and Nero looks like the prof! His assistant Dr Jo Bell (Jenny Till) tells Col Buchan all this while the boys find out Operation Seagull is an air display. When Mike learns too much, Soapy (Lawrence James) places a bomb in the plane Mike is to pilot, but luckily his plot fails. Col Buchan takes Jo to Paris for a meeting of Achilles, a scientists' club that Barnet belonged to, but once there he is knocked out\n\n6.4 Mayday - Ryan and Burke shoot at Steve's plane, \"they've got my right wing!\" He's able to land at Stockbridge, safely. All sixty scientists at the Achilles meeting have disappeared, where? Sue joins Colin (Mike Lewin) to find the answer, no luck at Hartland Point, and Col Buchan has his own methods, by joining the arrested Ryan and Burke as a fellow prisoner. A fake rescue for them is staged and they are tailed by Mike and Steve to Portsmouth, where they join a training ship\n\n6.5 Pirates - Bodinnick Lighthouse, that's Nero's hq. Joining him is Mike and Steve's ship, The Malcolm Miller. Colin is wounded, and Sue captured near the giant machine Medusa, which is concealed under the lighthouse. She's tied up on the beach, at the mercy of the incoming tide\n\n6.6 The Threat - Mike and Steve swim from their ship to the shore to rescue Colin and, water up to her neck, Sue, both taken by dinghy to Polperro, though en route Col Buchan picks them up. They plan to put Sue on The Churchill, sister ship to The Malcolm Miller, that Ryan and Burke are going to hijack. At the lighthouse, one scientist, Prof John McCabe (Simon Cuff) is anxious for action, but Nero is not ready yet for Medusa\n\n6.7 Doomsday - \"The world, I have decided to destroy it,\" cries Nero. Only those 60 scientists and the youngsters from the two ships will survive as Medusa spreads o'er the earth. Later, they'll emerge into a brave new if empty world, \"he mustn't do it!\" Buchan and Jo penetrate the lighthouse to prevent tragedy, and the ships' crews are rescued. An almighty explosion, only Ryan and Burke survive, and they grab Mike and Steve as hostages\n\n6.8 Black Box - Mike and Steve get away from Ryan and Burke, given shelter by ex-Navy man Caine (Kevin Stoney). But he is now involved with the two baddies after Nero's box that tells the whereabouts of the six million in gold. The boys have grabbed this from Ryan and Burke, and on Col Buchan's yacht, they open it\n\n6.9 Cypher - Ryan and Burke get aboard Buchan's yacht, moored on Weymouth Quay, and blow open his safe to snatch back the coded message, that was in Nero's box. Prof Gotts (Ronald Adam) has told Buchan that the script is Hittite, but it's \"gibberish.\" Caine holds the only key to the code, and he has taken Steve prisoner\n\n6.10 The Parcel - Steve is rescued by Mike and Sue. Caine goes to ground, but sends a parcel bomb to Col Buchan. Luckily that's chucked into the sea. It's now a race to crack Nero's code to obtain the number of the bank account that holds Nero's fortune. Operation Red Herring, that's Caine's plan to take this gold away by yacht using the Cowes Races as a cover\n\n6.11 The Race - Caine loads the gold he's collected from The Netherlands General Bank on to his van, hiding it in a windmill- well, this is Holland. Buchan follows by car, Mark and Sue by yacht, somehow they're all in Amsterdam, and look who are also here, Ryan and Burke at a garage where Caine has placed one crate of gold\n\n6.12 Red Herring - \"It's those kid's again!\" Mike and Sue tail Ryan and Burke through the streets of Amsterdam. \"We've got to lose 'em.\" The baddies reach the ship Argus. Time to stowaway, and see the gold being carried on board. They certainly have better luck than Col Buchan, who is diverted by Caine's wiles and caught by customs with gold hidden in his tyres, put there when his car was in the garage. A neat little chase thriller\n\n6.13 Pay Off - \"We'll soon be in Rio drinking champagne,\" boasts Caine, the yacht race their cover for escape. Stowaways Mike and Sue start a punch up which tv cameras pick up, alerting Col Buchan. As Steve creates a diversion, Buchan clambers on board Caine's ship\n\nChildren's Menu\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSexton Blake (made by Rediffusion Television)\n\nChildren's Menu\n\nLaurence Payne was in the title role with Roger Foss as Tinker.

After the Palazzo Medici closes for the night, an intruder emerges from a coffin, discards his mummy bands, and creeps to the window. Opening the shutters he lets his two accomplices in. \"Mamma mia,\" is the incredibly corny line of the nightwatchman when he spots the ex-mummy, and he is powerless to stop the theft of the Painted Venetian Lady.\n\nIn Sexton Blake's flat, Tinker is hanging that same picture, though this is a copy of course. It's a good copy however, \"she's got more clothes on than some.\" But an ad in The Times has intrigued SB, someone wants to contact him as the recent purchaser of this picture.\n\nHe proves to be a shopkeeper with a foreign accent, sinister, Helmut Waltz (Wallas Eaton) who offers increasingly large sums for the copy, as SB refuses to sell. Some flimsy cock and bull story is offered why he's prepared to pay so much, \"that's a crazy one and no mistake,\" observes Tinker later.\n\nMatt lives on a riverboat, a painter, very disorganised but an expert in art, so SB turns to him. He knows of Waltz and his dubious reputation, which opinion would be confirmed if SB could see what he's up to now. His gang have broken into SB's flat, Mrs Bardell screams and SB and Tinker interrupts the theft, Tinker gives chase with Pedro while SB takes Mrs Bardell's description of the thief, \"ten foot tall.\" Inspector Coutts (Ernest Clark) is quite amused when SB turns to him to ask him to investigate this attempted robbery. He quickly recognises the handiwork of James Fisher, Jimmy the Fish, who has eluded the Yard for years.\n\nMatt has examined SB's painting, a good copy, the best copy he knows belongs to the Duke of Fontwell. Under SB's picture he finds another, probably 400 years old- it's the copy that belongs to the Duke\n\nRest of cast: Dorothea Phillips as Mrs Bardell, who appears intermittently throughout the series, Wallas Eaton as Helmut Waltz, Fredric Abbott as Matt Carnegie, Hugh Futcher as Jimmy the Fish, Ernest Clark as Inspector Coutts.\n\nHere are details of the rest of this long running series.\n\n1.2 The Lady Has Two Faces (October 2nd 1967)\n\n1.3 Search for the Lady (October 9th 1967)\n\n1.4 The Lady Is Found (October 16th 1967)\n\nThe second story was Knave of Diamonds in 5 parts.\n\nThe script was by Peter Ling (returning to the company he had worked for in children's tv for many years, after leaving to create Compact and Crossroads).

Director: Adrian Brown.\n\nThe regular members of the cast were: Malcolm Patton as Tim Cordon, Gay Emma as Betsy Alder, Geoffrey Russell and Pamela Pitchford as Mr and Mrs Cordon, James Ward as Mr Francis, a vet, and Rosemary Nicols as Sheila Dicken.\n\nThe attraction of this popular series for children, was no doubt the fact that live animals were seen.\n\nA contemporary report on the second series: \"this is a well meaning but rather self conscious serial... designed to impart a great deal of information in the form of fictionalised conversation, and within its own limits it does very well. It is disarmingly unsophisticated and rather dated in atmosphere despite references to The Beatles. It reminded me irresistibly of stories about well bred upper middle class children spending a holiday by the sea... The drama school accents of Gay Emma and Kenneth Nash contributed to this, though they both gave attractive performances. As this is education masquerading as fiction, bits of plot are stuck on merely to provide an excuse for the next painting lesson. It's hardly surprising therefore that the acting looked not so much wooden as like hardboard- useful but not real. Even that accomplished character actor Ivor Salter didn't quite succeed in injecting human interest into facts and figures about oysters!\" This is evidently a review of 2.11, and certainly the second series scripts are much more stilted.\n\nMy reviews of surviving episodes: 1.1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.8, 1.11, 1.16, 2.7, 2.10, 2.11\n\nTo Children's Menu\n\nPlot summaries: 1.1: Jan 4th 1963.
