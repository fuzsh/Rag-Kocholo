        "text": "He's been on our screens and on stage for over 50 years. Ulster-born actor Harry Towb looks back on an eventful career\n\nIN the 1950s there were still many English landladies who displayed that famous welcoming sign on their boardinghouse doors: \"No Irish, no Jews, no theatricals\".\n\nFor the then budding actor, Harry Towb, this sign spelt trouble. He found himself barred on all three counts.\n\n\"And not without justification.\" admits Towb, \"At the start of my acting career I scarcely had two pennies to rub together, let alone have enough money to pay the rent\".\n\nIt is typical of the affable Harry that he passes off prejudices he has encountered with a light-hearted remark, rather than harbour any long-term bitterness.\n\nTowb is probably the only Jew to be born in Larne. His father had a small shop in the town which supplied Irish linen. At the age of two his family moved to England, but returned in the early 1930s. Towb grew up between the Oldpark and Crumlin roads, in north Belfast.\n\nThe family's circumstances were far from comfortable, even before tragedy struck. In 1943 Towb's father died when Harry was barely 18. The teenager found himself the chief bread-winner for the family.\n\nAn education which began at Finiston PES and continued at Belfast Technical College came to an abrupt halt. Harry frankly acknowledges he struggled at first as a businessman. But, ironically, it was only once he had managed to turn things around that he decided to jack it all in, and become an actor.\n\nTowb came into the theatre as a result of one amazing week in his life.\n\nHe had made a name for himself in some amateur productions when, to his immense surprise, he received three openings for professional acting all in the space of seven days. He opted for a five-week stint with a Dublin touring company because \"I thought it would be fun\".\n\nLooking back, he marvels that his mother and sister didn't try to talk him out of it.\n\n\"I owe my acting career to the generous spirit of my mother\" Towb recalls. \"When I announced I was off to London to seek my fortune on the stage, my horrified mother made me swear only one thing. If I hadn't made the grade in a year, I would come back home to Belfast\".\n\nTowb, aged 21, left Ulster with £20 in his pocket and wearing an awful bottle green suit with heavily padded shoulders, which he believed would pass for metropolitan fashion.\n\nIt took him much more than a year to make the grade, but thanks to his ambition, tenacity and talent, make the grade he did. He can now look back on over 50 years of interesting and varied work on the stage and in films, television and radio.\n\nBy 1951 he had made the breakthrough into television which, as with so much in an actor's career, fell into his lap almost by accident.\n\n\"In about 1951 I had my first audition for a real part in a stage play. It was after this audition that the director caught sight of the back of me walking through a door.\n\n\"I was wearing my awful bottle green suit which I had bought years before in Belfast. The director called me back and said I had just the look of the person they needed to play a spiv in a new television drama.\".\n\nTHE versatile Towb was ready and able to work in any medium so long as the role was right. As an Ulster Jew he had two cultural traditions to fall back on to save himself from being typecast.\n\nHe knows how to play highly-strung emotional Jewish grandfathers as well as hard-drinking wise-cracking Irish working men.\n\nHe even managed to combine the Irish Jewish bit by playing George Nathan, the \"Jew finder in chief,\" in the 1991 sit-com, So You Think You've Got Troubles. Nathan, as president of the ailing Belfast Jewish community, seeks to persuade the militantly atheist Warren Mitchell, recently arrived from London, to join the local synagogue.\n\nTowb takes much pride in his award-winning short story, Cowboys, which he adapted into a television play. In this he played a Belfast-born American Jew who comes back to revisit the streets where he grew up.\n\nTowb warmly evokes the innocence of his own Belfast childhood, touching on the mutual misunderstanding which he acknowledges existed between the Jews and their non Jewish neighbours. But in Cowboys he also celebrated the warm friendships which emerged across Belfast's other, less well-known, religious divide.\n\nOne of his first film credits was \"Above Us the Waves\", set in the Second World War battle for the Atlantic. He also had parts in well-known films as the Blue Max, All Night Long (a \"jazzed up\" version of Othello) and, more recently, Moll Flanders and Lamb.\n\nHe will be remembered in Belfast for his chilling Uncle Connell in Stuart Parker's powerful television drama, Lost Belongings.\n\nIn the 60s he had no shortage of guest starring roles in popular TV series like Dr Who, The Avengers, Callan, The Professionals, and The Saint. However, unlike his great pal, James Ellis, Towb never had the comfort of a regular and steady role that Ellis enjoyed for many years with Z Cars.\n\nInstead, Towb's hallmark has been his versatility. He has performed in countless West End and Broadway productions.\n\nNow past his 70th year, he can still be seen on our screens, although he jokes the only roles he gets offered these days are for dying men, such as in the hospital drama, Holby City. He has parts in two films coming to our screens shortly, Conspiracy of Silence and Cheeky, and says with a twinkle in his eye he would be happy to still be acting when he's 90.\n\nHowever, family has always come first for Harry. He has been married for 38 years to actress Diana Hoddinott. They have three children and a five-year-old grandaughter, Tallula, whom he dotes over and describes as \"the real star of our clan\".\n\nAn unfulfilled ambition is to play The Dealer Solomon in Arthur Miller's The Price. So if anyone in Belfast is interested...\n\nHarry Towb has enjoyed a career spanning the Atlantic. He's met and worked with some of the best actors and actresses in the world. Looking back, he sighs with relief that as a young man he never did the wise and sensible thing.\n\nDuring those first desperate years when he struggled to earn a living, only a dogged self-belief prevented him writing home to his mother for the passage back to Belfast."
