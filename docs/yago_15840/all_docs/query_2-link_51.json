        "text": "Hoddinott History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe name Hoddinott reached England in the great wave of migration following the Norman Conquest of 1066. It is based on the Norman name Odinet, from which the more commonly known Odo is derived. Apart from the aforementioned patronymic origin, the place name could also mean \"pleasant valley,\" from the Welsh \"hawdd\" meaning \"pleasant\" or \"peaceful\" and \"nant,\" a \"glen or valley.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Hoddinott family\n\nThe surname Hoddinott was first found in Shropshire at Hodnet, a village and civil parish in the union of Drayton, in the hundred of North Bradford. 2\n\nThe first record of the place name was found in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it was listed as Odenet. 3\n\n\"The Hodnets, or Hodnetts, derive their name from the Shropshire parish of Hodnet. During the 13th century there was a powerful family in the county that took the name of De Hodenet from either the manor or the parish of the name.\" 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Hoddinott family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Hoddinott research.

For that reason, spelling variations are common among many Anglo-Norman names. The shape of the English language was frequently changed with the introduction of elements of Norman French, Latin, and other European languages; even the spelling of literate people's names were subsequently modified. Hoddinott has been recorded under many different variations, including Hodenet, Hignett, Hignet, Hodnet, Hodnett, Hodenett, Hodinett, Hodinutt, Hodinut, Hodinott, Hodinot, Hoddenett, Hoddinet, Hoddinutt and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Hoddinott family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Hoddinott Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nHoddinott Ranking\n\nIn Newfoundland, Canada, the name Hoddinott is the 429th most popular surname with an estimated 109 people with that name. 5\n\nMigration of the Hoddinott family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Hoddinott family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 104 words (7 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nHoddinott migration to the United States +\n\nTo escape the uncertainty of the political and religious uncertainty found in England, many English families boarded ships at great expense to sail for the colonies held by Britain. The passages were expensive, though, and the boats were unsafe, overcrowded, and ridden with disease. Those who were hardy and lucky enough to make the passage intact were rewarded with land, opportunity, and social environment less prone to religious and political persecution. Many of these families went on to be important contributors to the young nations of Canada and the United States where they settled. Hoddinotts were some of the first of the immigrants to arrive in North America:\n\nHoddinott Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nG. Hoddinott, who settled in Swain's Island in 1827\n\nS.
