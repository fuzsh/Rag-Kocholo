        "text": "Johannesburg Repertory Society was one of a number of important and influential amateur dramatic societies in South Africa during the 20th century.\n\nTHIS ENTRY REQUIRES EDITING\n\nFounding\n\nThe Johannesburg Repertory Playreading Society\n\nThis was a society founded by Muriel Alexander and 15 of the students from her Alexander School of Drama and Elocution on 15 November 1927, with the intention to perform serious theatre not then available from the existing commercial groups.\n\nThe Society did a public play reading of Holding Aloof by David Dainow in 1927, before it was took on the role of a full on dramatic society and was renamed the Johannesburg Repertory Society in 1928.\n\nThe Johannesburg Repertory Society\n\nIts first production under the new name was the brothers Çapek’s R.U.R. (\"Rossum’s Universal Robots\") in 1928, and by 1930 they were staging six productions a year. During the first ten years of its existence a total of sixty-six productions were mounted. The productions were of such outstanding quality that in 1932 the REPS were contracted by the commercial company African Consolidated Theatres to stage a production of Dangerous Corner for them. In 1933 they were again contracted by African Consolidated Theatres (now simply known as African Theatres) to stage Shaw’s Arms and the Man.\n\nAside from Alexander’s professional experience, the REPS also employed many other professional directors, including Joan Heymann, Gwen ffrangçon-Davies, Marda Vanne, Nan Munro, Margaret Inglis and André Huguenet. From 1933 until 1965, the REPS also published their own bimonthly magazine, Playtime.\n\nProductions\n\nInitially they used the badly-equipped Jewish Guild-hall as a venue, but from 1936 they used the Little Theatre in the new Johannesburg Library-Complex. In 1941, the REPS were invited by African Theatres to perform in the prestigious Standard Theatre, then the best venue in Johannesburg. During this time the company had to restrict its membership to 1400 members, which was the seating capacity of the theatre, but were so popular that a waiting-list had to be established. After the war ended, the REPS once again had to oscillate between the Standard and Little Theatre. However, plans to acquire an own, permanent venue came to fruition with the opening of the Reps Theatre (Johannesburg Repertory Theatre) in 1951. It was renamed the Alexander Theatre in 1960. This development allowed the membership to expand to around 4000 members (by 1955) and the REPS finally became a fully professional company, with Anthony Farmer as resident director and director of the company from 1954. When he left, he was briefly replaced (for one production) by Anthony Cullen. However, amateur productions were also continued through the REPS Associate Players, which had been originally established in 1949 to cater for younger members. The Associate Players later changed its name to the Repertory Amateur Player Section, and eventually became a completely independent organisation, the Repertory Amateur Players Society (RAPS). The society finally closed down (??) and sold the Alexander Theatre to PACT in 1978(???**).\n\nProduction highlights of their history include Shaw’s The Millionairess (1940), Coward’s Fumed Oak (1940), ***, ***, Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men (1940), Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest (1940), Ardrey’s Thunder Rock (1940), Kaufmann and Hart’s The Man Who Came to Dinner (1941), Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search of an Author (1941), Double Door (1941), Emlyn Williams’s The Late Chrisptopher Bean (1942), Clare Boothe’s The Women (1942), Giraudoux’s Amphitryon 38 (1942), O’Neill’s Anna Christie (1942), The Light of Heart (1943), The Flashing Stream (1943), Ferber and Kaufmann’s Stage Door (1943), Shaw’s The Doctor’s Dilemma (1944), Sheridan’s The Rivals (1944), Dane’s Granite (1944), Life with Father (1944), Rebecca*?
