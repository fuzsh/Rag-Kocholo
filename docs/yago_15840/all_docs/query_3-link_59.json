        "text": "Known World Service plays and series from 1980-1989, including those from Suttonelms' previous list plus various additions from all over. This can definitely be regarded as a work in progress!\n\n1980s:\n\n(00-00-198x) The Shepherd (Fredrick Forsyth, read by Tony Britton)\n\nThe 1976 novella relates the story of a De Havilland Vampire pilot, going home on Christmas Eve 1957, whose aircraft suffers a complete electrical failure en route from RAF Celle in northern Germany to RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk. Lost in fog and low on fuel, he is met and led (or shepherded) to a disused RAF dispersal field by the pilot of a De Havilland Mosquito fighter/bomber of World War II vintage, who has been sent up to guide him in. (NB: Unknown broadcast year, but it exists, at least in collectors' circles.)\n\n1980:\n\n(21-06 to 20-09-1980) HAUNTED, SERIES 1: - Tales Of The Supernatural\n\n(Various, dram Derek Hoddinott, except where noted) A BBC World Service series that included both classic and original ghost stories. (14 x 30m) (NB: Broadcast Saturdays; All info taken from a long-forgotten website, which may just refer to the author's own collection - eg. 'no credits given', etc)\n\n1: Little Girl Lost (Rosemary Timperley)\n\nWith the recent death of her second husband, Mrs. Grove now stays with her son from her first marriage, Herbert, and his wife, Sally. Sally and Herbert think she has gone mad as she continually talks to her late second husband, John, so they've called in a doctor to take a look at her. But Janet, Herbert and Sally's daughter, believes that Mrs. Grove can talk to her late husband and wants to be able to hear his voice, too. Sally feels she is losing control over her daughter as she gets closer with Mrs. Grove and begs her husband to stop it. \"Little Girl Lost\" by Rosemary Timperley was first published in 'The Bumper Book of Ghost Stories' in 1975. With Jenny Lyndon (Sally Lake), John Carson (Herbert Lake), Ruth Dunning (Mrs. Grove), Bernadette Windsor (Janet Lake), and Adrian Eagan (Doctor Raven / John Grove).\n\n2: What Was It? (Fitz-James O'Brien)\n\nIt is July 1854. Harry has just arrived No.28 Twenty-sixth Street, in New York City. It was built some fifteen or twenty years earlier by a well-known New York merchant, who five years earlier threw the commercial world into convulsions by a stupendous bank fraud. He escaped to Europe, and died not long after of a broken heart. Almost immediately after the news of his decease reached America, and was verified, the report spread in Twenty-sixth Street that No. 28 was haunted. Before it was turned into a boarding-house, the care taker and his wife, placed there by the house agent into whose hands it had passed for purposes of renting or sale, declared that they were troubled with unnatural noises. Doors were opened without any visible agency. The remnants of furniture scattered through the various rooms were, during the night, piled one upon the other by unknown hands. Invisible feet passed up and down the stairs in broad daylight, accompanied by the rustle of unseen silk dresses, and the gliding of viewless hands along the massive balusters. The care taker and his wife declared that they would live there no longer. The house remained untenanted for three years before Mrs. Moffat took over, turining it into a boarding-house. And after spending a month there, Harry was forced to acknowledge that nothing in the remotest degree approaching the supernatural had manifested itself until one night... What Was It? by Fitz-James O'Brien (31st December 1828 - 6th April 1862) was first published in \"Harper's\" in March 1859. It was the first well-shaped short story of a tangible but invisible being, and the prototype of de Maupassant's Horla. With Peter Marinker (Harry Crown), Blane Fairman (Doctor Stephen Hammond), and Helen Horton (Mrs. Moffatt).\n\n3: The Family (John Elliot)\n\nAs solicitor David Eccleston arrives at his client's (Mr. Watson) lodgings, he is met by a Detective Sergeant who gives him a letter from Watson that he feels he should read before he sees him. The letter is about something peculiar that has happened to him. It concerns a young women by the name of Carol Temple that he met late one night around 1:00 a.m. in front of the boarding house where he lived. She had no home, no parents, no relations so he invited her up to his flat to get out of the cold and have something to eat. He allowed her to stay the night though with no plans to take advantage of the situation... but he did. She left the next day under friendly terms and he didn't see her for three months until, one day, he arrived home late from a job and there she was. She tells him that she is pregnant. Whether it is his child or not he wants her to stay - he will take care of her - but she protests telling him that he must first hear her story... With George Cole (Mr. Watson), Janet Maw (Carol Temple), Peter Baldwin (Detective Sergeant Forester), John Church (David Eccleston), Elizabeth Ryder (The Nurse), Jane Thompson (The Reception), and Graham Faulkner (The Policeman).\n\n4: Walk On The Water (Rosemary Timperley)\n\nOne day, while making sandcastles on the beach as a young girl of about 8 or 9, Rachel meets a man who compliments her on her sandcastle but when her mother arrives, the man disappears. Later that day, she hears a story about something terrible happening to a man who went into the water for a swim. The next time Rachel sees this man is when she is 21-years-old and is engaged to be married to Peter. He appeared suddenly while she was on a platform waiting for a train saying only 'hello'. The appearances become more frequent to the point when, after her marriage, they are daily. Though all he ever says is 'hello', she starts to fall in love with this stranger as she becomes more and more detached from her husband. What does this man want from her and why won't he say more? 'Walk on the Water' by Rosemary Timperley was first published in \"The Eighth Ghost Book\" in 1972.

Timperley was born in London, England, and began her freelance writing career in 1960 after working as a school teacher and journalist.\n\n5: The Dream Woman (Wilkie Collins)\n\nWhile in a Inn, a doctor hears from the landlord about Isaac, an ostler, who has terrible dreams in which he tosses and turns, crying out in his sleep. He asks to see Isaac while he is sleeping to determine whether, if it is a problem with the brain, he could help. He and the landlord arrive at Isaac's room to find a restless man with a withered, woe-begone face. Isaac is talking in his sleep about a woman with \"Light gray eyes and a droop in the left eyelid; flaxen hair, with a gold-yellow streak in it\" who has a knife and is attempting to kill a man who is asleep - that man is Isaac. The landlord, knowing pretty well all about Isaac's past life, tells the doctor, little by little, the whole story of the extravagant and incredible events that have led to Isaac being in the state he is in. \"The Dream Woman\" was first published in 1855 (under the title \"The Ostler\"). aka \"Brother Morgan's Story of the Dream Woman\". With Charles Kay (Isaac Scatchard), Maureen O'Brien (Rebecca Murdoch), Richard Bird (The Doctor), Douglas Blackwell (Mr. Warren, the Landlord), and Katherine Parr (Mrs. Scatchard). Other cast members were David Timson and Danny Schiller\n\n6: The Decoy (Algernon Blackwood)\n\n\"The Decoy\" was first published in 1921 in the short story collection \"The Wolves of God and Other Fey Stories\" by Algernon Blackwood and Wilfred Wilson.\n\n7: Listen To The Silence (Unknown)\n\nMary listens to the radio at night because she is afraid of the silence. A voice calls for her saying it's her grandfather. But both her grandfathers have been dead for years and this man doesn't sound like either. He tells her that she was adopted and tells her true background. He has been trying to reach her but she has never given him the silence, the deep, deep silence he needed until this evening. The reason he came was to first tell her who she is; second, to tell her stories that made up his life. All she needs to do is open up herself to the silence and he will come again. But as she does her expectations take an unexpected turn. No credits given in this dramatisation.\n\n8: The Inexperienced Ghost (H G Wells)\n\nYou know how stuffy those English men's clubs are: \"right sort of chap, and all that rot.\" Now imagine that the very worst sort of interloper forced his way into the exclusive club - a ghost who refuses to leave. And even worse, a ghost who was a failure in life and a failure in his haunting. 'The Inexperienced Ghost' was first published in 1943.\n\n9: Christina (Daphne Castell)\n\nMiss Chaucer tells Dr. Richard that she is so depressed - in part due to the recent death of a friend - she have tried to shake it off but with no luck. Since Mary's death she has can't seem to take the same pleasure in writing, especially children stories. Also, before Mary died she had lost a lot of money - mostly to oversea investments. She has no family to turn to for hope or advise. Mary would have helped her had she been well enough. To an extent, Mary was her family. She's is alone now. It is that fact that depresses and frightens her. Dr. Richard tells her that she has to get away. A fresh environment; a new locality; to get out of London; to find a new village somewhere and make new friends - find a new rythm for her life and then rethink her future. That is what she did and that is how she came to meet Mrs. Crozier, the housekeeper, and Christina, the ghost of a child who has come back to the house where she once lived. But why? First published in \"Superhorror\" (1976), a short story and novelette collection. No credits given in this dramatisation.\n\n10: The Late Departure (Glen Chandler)\n\nPeter Harrington is a 43-year-old workaholic who is over-weight, a smoker, and has high blood pressure.

One day, after another hectic day at work, he runs to the station to catch the 11:00 p.m. train home. As he sits in one of the compartments, time starts to drift past 11:00 p.m. with no train departure. Slowly, he starts to see that all those around him, railway emloyees and passengers, act strangely towards him as none are concerned about the late departure. Where is this train going and will he ever get home? No credits given in this dramatisation.\n\n11: Esmeralda (John Keir Cross)\n\nWhen Mr. Broome finally attempts to take charge of events with one momentous act, he strangles his wife and buries her in the basement of his tobacco shop. But then he is haunted by his fantasy daughter, Esmeralda, who seems to know all of his sordid little sexual secrets. Dramatised from the short story 'Esmeralda' which was first published in \"The Other Passenger\" (1944), a collection of strange short stories by John Keir Cross (1911 - 1967) aka Stephen MacFarlane. No credits given in this dramatisation.\n\n12: A Pair Of Hands (Arthur Quiller-Couch)\n\nMore than causing goose pimples, this tender tale tugs at the heartstrings with its touching description of the antics of the \"most harmless ghost in the world.\" The pair of hands that show up in the house rented by Miss Poulton belong to a girl Margaret, who had died of diptheria at the tender age of seven. Ever since, her little hands appear every now and then to dust and clean the house with an almost obsessive desire to keep it free of infection. So unobtrusive and gentle is the dead girlÆs presence that hers is the friendliest ghost. As Miss Poulton says of this sweet spirit: she \"smoothed my pillow, touched and made my table comely, in summers lifted the heads of the flowers as I passed.\" The short story 'A Pair of Hands' by Arthur Quiller-Couch (1863 - 1944) was first published in 1898. No credits given in this dramatisation.\n\n13: Keeping His Promise (Algernon Blackwood, dram Patricia Mays)\n\nA sudden queer sensation of fear passed over himùa faintness and a shiver down the back. It went, however, almost as soon as it came, and he was just debating whether he would call aloud.to his invisible visitor, or slam the door and return to his books, when the cause of the disturbance turned the corner very slowly and came into view... This tale concerns a young man by the name of Jack Marriott who is a fourth year student at Edinburgh University. One night he is cramming for his finals when his friend, Ambrose Field, from a long time ago knocks on the door in a terrible state. His friend is close to starvation, and so Marriot feeds him and sets him to sleep. As his friend sleeps, Marriott discovers that nothing is quite as it seems with the situation. A promise that was made a long time ago seems to have come back to haunt him û literally. \"Keeping His Promise\" was first published in 1906 in Blackwood's short story collection, 'The Empty House: And Other Ghost Stories'. With Eric Deacon (Jack Marriott), Christopher Neame (Ambrose Field), David Griffin (Henry Green), Peter Tuddenham (Lord Field), and Narissa Knights (Lady Field).

His parents, converts to a Calvinistic sect, led an austere life, ill-suited to their dreamy and sensitive son. During adolescence, he became fascinated by hypnotism and the supernatural and, on leaving university, studied Hindu philosophy and occultism. Later, he was to draw on these beliefs and experiences in his writing.\n\n14: Which One? (R Chetwynd-Hayes, dram Patricia Mayes)\n\nThe story takes place in 1940.

(3 x 45m)\n\n(14-03-1982) Random Moments In A May Garden (James Saunders)\n\n(Suttonelms:) A middle-aged couple have bought a country cottage and are given the remains of an old photograph by the Surveyor who found it under the lining paper inside of one of the cupboards. It was a piece of Victorian family portrait which now only shows two little girls, photographed in a garden. We learn what they were doing there; \"Random Moments in a May Garden\" is two stories occurring in parallel in the same house, and cutting between the two. The play is an elegant domestic study set within the deceptively simple framework of a middle-aged married couple giving a small dinner-party for their friends before their move. In the background, hauntingly, is an old photograph of another family group taken in a May garden, raising the question of transience versus permanence. The play also subtly explores Sophie's doubts on the degree of her own fulfilment. James Saunders's haunting radio play was subsequently performed both on the stage on 9th June 1977 at the Questors Theatre, Ealing (London, England)\n\nand on television on 22nd May 1981 on BBC2 Playhouse. With Barbara Jefford (Sophie), Peter Jeffrey (David, Sophie's Husband), Julie Hallam (Anne), Helen Worth (Katie), Anthony Hall (The Photographer), Vernon Joyner (The Surveyor), Denys Hawthorne (Digby), Elizabeth Morgan (Ann), Hugh Dickson (Mark), and Ellen Sheean (Katherine). Produced by Richard Wortley. Reviews: \"Beautiful to listen to, a meditation on growing up and the loss of hope, written in a kind of poetic naturalism . . . and acted with feeling and with clarity.\" (The Times) \"Should have been entered for the Prix Italia but wasn't.\" (Richard Wortley) - Jim (60m) (NB: Originally broadcast 20-01-1974, and repeated on that channel 11-08-1979 and 10-08-1985.)\n\n(09 to 23-12-1982) The Midwich Cuckoos (John Wyndham)\n\nThis three-part dramatisation of John Wyndham's disturbing science fiction tale, starring Charles Kay and Pauline Yates, was first broadcast by the BBC World Service in 1982.

(NB: Repeated on BBC7, and available on BBC CD.)\n\n1983:\n\n(00-00-1983) Just Between Ourselves (Alan Ayckbourn, adap Richard Wigmore)\n\nWith Peter Vaughan, Jennifer Piercy, Nigel Anthony, Frances Jeater and Hilda Kriseman. A bittersweet comedy about love, relationships and marriage. The story lifts the covers off suburbia to reveal the seething tensions beneath. Dennis spends his spare time pottering in the garage, oblivious to the fact that he has absolutely no mechanical or DIY skills. He is equally unaware that his wife, Vera, is being driven to distraction by his possessive mother. Quote from director Gordon House (from elsewhere on Suttonelms): \"I've lost count of the number of Alan Ayckbourn's plays I've produced on radio, but one of the first I ever worked on was \"Just Between Ourselves\", a play where each scene takes place on the birthday of one of its five central characters. This is a play in which a man literally drives his wife mad. The scene in which this deeply depressed woman begs for help and he, quite incapable of understanding what she is talking about, asks her to draw up a list of household jobs to be done, is one of the bleakest scenes in the history of English Theatre. Just Between Ourselves is a great play, but shorn of the comforting laughter a theatre audience produces, it beggars belief to call it a comedy, particularly on radio.\" (90m) (NB: Repeated in Radio 4's Afternoon Theatre slot, 12-02-1984, and on BBC7, 19-06-2004, introduced by the director.)\n\n(00-00-1983) Digging Up Trouble (Grant Eustace)\n\n(00-00-1983) Just Between Ourselves (Alan Ayckbourn)\n\n(31-07-1983) Foreign Exchange (Ellen Fox)\n\nA Canadian girl decides to spend part of her pre-University year in England, away from the influence of her mother. She finds lodgings and a boyfriend, and they explore the sights of London together. But it's not long before she discovers traits in his behaviour which she does not like.

His old schoolfellow, the celebrated English cricketer A. J. Raffles, knows just the person to help a fellow out. He's a jeweller in Bond Street - and funnily enough, Raffles had planned to pay him a surprise visit that very night...\n\n2: Gentlemen & Players\n\n- When Raffles and Bunny are engaged for cricketing weeks at country estates, the playing of cricket can hardly be said to be their chief preoccupation. Bunny is an incorrigible ladies man, while Raffles takes an understandable professional interest in his fellow guests' portable property.\n\n3: A Costume Piece\n\n- Reuben Rosenthall has made his millions in the diamond fields of South Africa, and it seems only right and proper to Raffles that some of this wealth should be redistributed.

Reuben Rosenthall - Geoffrey Matthews.\n\n4: Nine Points Of Law\n\n- An advertisement in a daily paper offers £2,000 reward for anyone qualified to undertake a `delicate mission' and prepared to run a certain risk. This proves more than sufficient bait for those intrepid risk-takers Raffles and Bunny - even though the mission turns out to bee not entirely legal... Craggs - David Graham, Addenbrooke - David Buck.\n\n5: Wilful Murder Or The Return Match\n\n- Such is the nature of Raffles professional life that he is often required to work at night. So it is no surprise to Bunny when Raffles announces he has plans for the evening ahead. The surprise - and the horror - comes when Raffles calmly declares he is planning to commit murder...\n\n6: The Chest Of Silver\n\n- With Inspector MacKenzie's suspicions about Raffles professional life growing, A. J. decides the time has now come to visit Scotland. But Bunny is not to go with him: he has the responsibility of guarding Raffles illegally acquired silver plate.\n\n(00-00-1985) Second Holmes (Grant Eustace)\n\nSeries of colourful Sherlock Holmes-type adventures involving latter-day descendants of Holmes and Watson.\n\n1986:\n\n(21-01-1986) For King and Country.\n\nBBC WS Play of the Week 21.01.1986.
