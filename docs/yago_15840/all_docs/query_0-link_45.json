He attended the Finiston School and Technical College, Belfast. He then appeared on stage with a touring theatre company in Ireland, in repertory theatre in England and in London's West End, where he had a role in the musical adaptation of Bar Mitzvah Boy. He also appeared in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at the National Theatre in 2004.\n\nHe made numerous appearances on UK television including The Avengers, Home James (TV series)|, Casualty, The Bill, Minder, Doctor Who and Heartbeat. His film appearances include Above Us the Waves (1955), The Blue Max (1966), Prudence and the Pill (1968), Patton (1970) and Lamb (1985). On radio, in 1959 he appeared in the classic episode of Hancock's Half Hour \"Fred's Pie Stall\".In December 2008, Towb appeared in two episodes of the BBC soap opera EastEnders as David, Janine Butcher's fiancee.\n\nHarry Towb was also a regular presenter on the BBC Schools' programme You and Me featuring with Cosmo and Dibs. In the late 1970s, Towb appeared in a series of TV commercials advertising Younger's Tartan Special beer, which were shown on very heavy rotation in Scotland.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHarry Towb was married to the actress Diana Hoddinott for 44 years until his death. He died at his home in London from complications due to cancer. As his obituary in The Times said, \"Asked, once, why he had become an actor, Harry Towb said it was because he had always wanted to be someone else.\" His \"being fascinated by others... made him one of the finest character actors of his day,\" The Times continued. Towb, said one critic, \"can be relied upon to add distinction to any production\".\" He is survived by Hoddinott and their children (Emily, Daniel and Joshua) and three granddaughters. Towb was Jewish and in 1983 recorded a documentary, Odd Men In, about Belfast's Jewish community. He would describe his interview with Belfast-born Chaim Herzog for this documentary as his proudest moment.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n2009\n\nGardens with Red Roses (Short) as\n\nGrandad # 2\n\n2008\n\nEastEnders (TV Series) as\n\nDavid\n\n- Episode dated 19 December 2008 (2008) - David\n\n- Episode dated 18 December 2008 (2008) - David\n\n2001\n\nThe Bill (TV Series) as\n\nFrank Kennedy / Harry Taylor / George Watt\n\n- 485: Dead Man's Hand - Part 2 (2007) - Harry Taylor\n\n- 206: Settle the Score (2004) - George Watt\n\n- The Leopard: Part 2 (2001) - Frank Kennedy\n\n- The Leopard: Part 1 (2001) - Frank Kennedy\n\n- PC Smith (2001) - Frank Kennedy\n\n- Common Language (2001) - Frank Kennedy\n\n1992\n\nCasualty (TV Series) as\n\nVictor Brook / Sam Kelvin\n\n- The Sunny Side of the Street: Part 1 (2006) - Victor Brook\n\n- Tender Loving Care (1992) - Sam Kelvin\n\n2006\n\nThe 10th Man (Short) as\n\nSid\n\n2005\n\nHeartbeat (TV Series) as\n\nHugo Cummins\n\n- Mastermind (2005) - Hugo Cummins\n\n2004\n\nMy Dad's the Prime Minister (TV Series) as\n\nBackbencher\n\n- Exam (2004) - Backbencher\n\n2003\n\nCheeky as\n\nMr. Oates\n\n2003\n\nConspiracy of Silence as\n\nFather Doherty\n\n2002\n\nDoctors (TV Series) as\n\nCharlie Mills\n\n- Attention (2002) - Charlie Mills\n\n2001\n\nHolby City (TV Series) as\n\nJack Herrmann\n\n- Family Ties (2001) - Jack Herrmann\n\n2000\n\nTomb Raider: Chronicles (Video Game) as\n\nFather Patrick (uncredited)\n\n2000\n\nThe Most Fertile Man in Ireland as\n\nUncle Eugene\n\n1998\n\nClinton: His Struggle with Dirt (TV Movie)\n\n1998\n\nComedy Nation (TV Series) as\n\nVarious Roles\n\n1996\n\nSafe and Sound (TV Series) as\n\nLiam\n\n- Spare Parts (1996) - Liam\n\n1996\n\nMoll Flanders as\n\nMagistrate\n\n1994\n\nBrighton Belles (TV Series) as\n\nMichael\n\n- That Was No Lady (1994) - Michael\n\n1994\n\nThe Day Today (TV Series) as\n\nMatthew Krean MP / Chief Whip\n\n- Factgasm (1994) - Matthew Krean MP\n\n- Stretchcast (1994) - Chief Whip (uncredited)\n\n1992\n\nScreen One (TV Series) as\n\nGeorge Empson\n\n- Trust Me (1992) - George Empson\n\n1992\n\nThe Camomile Lawn (TV Series) as\n\nStranger\n\n- Episode #1.2 (1992) - Stranger\n\n1991\n\nSo You Think You've Got Troubles (TV Series) as\n\nGeorge Nathan\n\n- Getting It Off Your Chest (1991) - George Nathan\n\n- South of the Border (1991) - George Nathan\n\n- Someone to Watch Over Me (1991) - George Nathan\n\n- Old Dog, New Tricks (1991) - George Nathan\n\n1988\n\nScene (TV Series) as\n\nMr. Downes\n\n- That Green Stuff (1990)\n\n- QPR Askey Is Dead (1988) - Mr. Downes\n\n1990\n\nThe Paradise Club (TV Series) as\n\nSyd Mann\n\n- Lord of the Files (1990) - Syd Mann\n\n1987\n\nHome James!
