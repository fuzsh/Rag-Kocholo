broad shoulders above a body excessively thin. He wore a small beard closely trimmed. His hair, which was thick, was cut short and so brushed as to stand up briskly all over his head. In characteristic posture he stood erect, head up, chest out; his elbows would be drawn closely in towards his sides, and with the fingers of one hand he toyed with a jewelled ring he habitually wore on the little finger of the other. When he was vexed or surly, his lips would be compressed to one crisp straight line and his eyes became little hard points of light. Cold, inflexible, the world called him, and not without cause, but towards Dmitri and me he displayed a tenderness almost feminine. Despite which, he demanded of us, as of all his household or following, exact and immediate obedience….Introspective, essentially diffident, his true spirit imprisoned with him, he hid private impulses of exceeding sensitiveness…Those few who knew him well were deeply devoted to him, but even his intimates feared him, and Dmitri [her brother] and I feared him too.” (His ward and niece, Maria Pavlovna the Younger)\n\n“Serge will captivate you when you know him I am sure.
