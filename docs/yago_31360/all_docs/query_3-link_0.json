        "text": "German princess (1787–1847)\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Saxe-Hildburghausen (17 June 1787 Hildburghausen – 12 December 1847 Bamberg) was the child of Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg and his wife, Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She was the wife of Prince Paul of Wurttemberg and mother to his five children.\n\nCharlotte was the eldest daughter of Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, and his wife Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She was the second of twelve children. One of her godparents was Catherine the Great of Russia.\n\nAlong with her sisters, Therese and Louise, Charlotte was considered quite a beauty. Poet Friedrich Rückert dedicated one of his works, Mit drei Moosrosen, to these three young ladies. The title roughly translates to \"Three Moss Roses\".\n\nOn 28 September 1805, she married Prince Paul of Wurttemberg in an extravagant wedding, but it was not a happy marriage. They had numerous arguments, and Paul was said to have many mistresses, with whom he had several affairs. However, during their marriage, they had five children:\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Württemberg (1807–1873); married Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia, taking the name \"Elena Pavlovna\" upon her conversion to the Russian Orthodox Church.[1]\n\nPrince Frederick of Württemberg (1808–1870); married his cousin, Princess Catherine Frederica of Württemberg.\n\nPrince Paul of Württemberg (1809–1810); died at an early age\n\nPrincess Pauline of Württemberg (1810–1856); married Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau[2]\n\nPrince August of Württemberg (1813–1885); married Marie Bethge\n\nThe couple separated soon after the birth of their fifth child. The idea of divorce was rejected by the King of Württemberg. Charlotte lived in a house called Sovereignty in Hildburghausen. Her eldest daughter, Princess Charlotte, visited her there quite often. Her brother, Frederick, was also a frequent visitor.\n\nCharlotte died at the Royal Palace in Bamberg and is buried in the crypt of the House of Württemberg in Ludwigsburg."
