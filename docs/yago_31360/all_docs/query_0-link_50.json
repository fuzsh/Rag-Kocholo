        "text": "Charles (March 6, 1823 – October 6, 1891) was King of Württemberg from June 25, 1864 until his death in 1891.\n\nCharles was born on March 6, 1823 in Stuttgart as the only son of King Wilhelm I of Württemberg and his third wife Pauline Therese of Württemberg (1800–1873), one of the five children of Duke Ludwig of Württemberg and his wife, Princess Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg. Her siblings included Maria Dorothea, Archduchess of Austria; Amelia, Duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen; Elisabeth Alexandrine, Princess of Baden, and Duke Alexander of Württemberg himself the founder of the Teck branch of the family.\n\nAs the king’s eldest son he became Crown Prince Charles of Württemberg.\n\nHis father’s first wife was Princess Caroline Augusta, daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nAfter their 1814 divorce, without issue, King Wilhelm I married his first cousin, Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Emperor Paul I of Russia and Princess Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg.\n\nGrand Duchess Catherine died in 1819 after having two daughters, Princess Marie of Württemberg (wife of Alfred, Count von Neipperg) and Princess Sophie of Württemberg (wife of King Willem III of the Netherlands).\n\nFrom his parents marriage, he had two sisters, Princess Catherine (who married Prince Friedrich of Württemberg) and Princess Augusta (wife of Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach).\n\nHis paternal grandparents were King Friedrich I of Württemberg and Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (a daughter of Charles Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick and Princess Augusta of Great Britain, elder sister to King George III).\n\nHis grandmother’s younger sister, Princess Caroline married King George IV. His maternal grandparents were Duke Louis of Württemberg and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\nKing Charles I married Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia in 1846 and ascended to the throne in 1864, the daughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and Charlotte of Prussia (a daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia and sister to Wilhelm I, German Emperor).\n\nDespite their marriage, the couple had no children, likely due to Charles’ homosexuality. Charles was involved in several scandals, including a close relationship with American Charles Woodcock. In 1870, the couple adopted Olga’s niece, Vera Konstantinovna.\n\nKing Charles I aligned with Austria during the Austro-Prussian War but later sided with Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, joining the new German Empire in 1870. He died childless and was succeeded by his sister’s son, as King Wilhelm II of Württemberg.\n\nMary of Great Britain (March 5, 1723 – January 14, 1772) was the second-youngest daughter of King George II of Great Britain and his wife, Princess Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach, and Landgravine of Hesse-Cassel as the wife of Landgrave Friedrich II of Hesse-Cassel.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrincess Mary of Great Britain was born at Leicester House, Westminster, London. At the time of her birth her father was the Prince of Wales, later King George II of Great Britain and Ireland. Her mother was Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach, daughter of Margrave Johann Friedrich of Brandenburg-Ansbach and his second wife, Princess Eleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach.\n\nHer father succeeded, as King George II of Great Britain and Ireland, on June 11, 1727, and she became “HRH The Princess Mary”.\n\nUpon her mother’s death in 1737, Queen Caroline, entrusted Mary to her elder sister Princess Caroline, urging her to “do what she could to support the meek and mild disposition of Princess Mary”.\n\nMarriage\n\nA marriage was negotiated with Landgrave Friedrich II of Hesse-Cassel, the only son and heir of Landgrave Wilhelm VIII of Hesse-Cassel, and his wife Dorothea Wilhelmine of Saxe-Zeitz. His paternal grandfather was Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Cassel, and his paternal uncle was King Friedrich I of Sweden.\n\nFor the marriage, Parliament voted Princess Mary £40,000.\n\nThey married by proxy at the Chapel Royal of St. James’s Palace in London on May 8, then in person on June 28, 1740 at Bellevue Palace, Cassel. They had four sons, three of whom survived to adulthood.\n\nThe marriage was unhappy, and Friedrich was said to be “brutal” and “a boor”. Frederick reportedly subjected Mary to spousal abuse. In late 1746, Mary made an extended trip to Britain to escape his maltreatment. The couple separated in 1754 on Friedrich’s conversion to Roman Catholicism. She was supported by her father-in-law, who provided her with a residence in Hanau, as she did not wish to return to Great Britain, but to stay on the continent to raise her children.\n\nIn 1756, Mary moved to Denmark, to take care of the children of her sister Louise of Great Britain, who had died in 1751. She was the wife of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway the grandson of King Frederik IV of Denmark and Norway and the only son of Crown Prince Christian and Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.\n\nShe took her children with her, and they were raised at the royal court and her sons were married to Danish princesses.\n\nTheir eldest son, Prince-Elector Wilhelm I of Hesse (the Landgravate of Hesse-Cassel was elevated to a Prince-Elector of Hesse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803) married his first cousin, Princess Wilhelmina Caroline of Denmark and Norway (1747–1820), who was the second surviving daughter of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway and Princess Louise of Great Britain.\n\nTheir second son, Prince Charles, was elevated to the rank of Landgrave and also married his first cousin, (sister to his brothers wife) Princess Louise of Denmark, who was also a daughter of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway and Princess Louise of Great Britain.\n\nThe third son, Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel did not marry his first cousin. On December 2, 1786 in Biebrich, he married Princess Caroline of Nassau-Usingen (1762 – 1823), a remarkable heiress of a family which became extinct in male line.\n\nPrincess Mary’s husband succeeded his father as Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel in 1760, and so Mary was technically Landgravine Consort for the last twelve years of her life, despite her estrangement from her husband.\n\nMary died on 14 or 16 January 1772, aged 48 at Hanau, Germany.\n\nThe descendants of Princess Mary of Great and her husband Landgrave Friedrich II of Hesse-Cassel include (among others) King Frederik VIII of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, (wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom) Empress Marie Feodorovna of All the Russias (wife of Emperor Alexander II of Russia), King George I of the Hellenes and Crown Princess Thyra of Hanover.\n\nCaroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach (March 1, 1683 – November 20, 1737) was Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and Princess-Electress of Hanover and Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg from June 11,1727 until her death in 1737 as the wife of King George II of Great Britain and Ireland and Prince-Elector of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg\n\nPrincess Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach was born on March 1, 1683 at Ansbach, the daughter of Margave Johann Friedrich Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach, (of the House of Hohenzollern) and his second wife, Princess Eleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach.\n\nHer father was the ruler of the Principality of Ansbach, one of the smallest German states of the Holy Roman Empire; he died of smallpox at the age of 32, when Princess Caroline was three years old.\n\nPrincess Caroline and her only full sibling, her younger brother Margrave Wilhelm Friedrich of Brandenburg-Ansbach, left Ansbach with their mother, who returned to her native Eisenach.\n\nIn 1692, Princess Caroline’s widowed mother was pushed into an unhappy marriage with Elector Johann Georg IV of Saxony, and she and her two children moved to the Saxon court at Dresden.\n\nThe union proved to be unsuccessful; Prince-Elector Johann Georg IV lived openly with his mistress, Magdalene Sibylle “Billa” of Neidschutz and she became the first ever Official Mistress of a Prince-Elector of Saxony;\n\nAfter Princess Caroline was orphaned at a young age, she moved to the enlightened court of her guardians, King Friedrich I in Prussia and his wife Princess Sophia Charlotte of Hanover, the only daughter of Prince-Elector Ernest August of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and his wife Princess Sophia of the Palatinate of the Rhine.\n\nPrincess Sophia Charlotte of Hanover was the sister of Prince-Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, future King of Great Britain.\n\nAt the Prussian court, Princess Caroline’s previously limited education was widened and she adopted the liberal outlook possessed by Princess Sophia Charlotte, who became her good friend and whose views influenced Princess Caroline all her life.\n\nWhen she was a young woman, Princess Caroline was much sought-after as a bride. After rejecting the suit of Archduke Charles of Austria, a claimant to the Spanish throne and future Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.\n\nPrincess Caroline eventually married Prince Georg August of Hanover who was third in line to the English throne (and subsequently the British throne) and heir apparent to the Electorate of Hanover.\n\nPrince Georg August of Hanover was the son of Prince-Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and nephew of her friend Princess Sophia Charlotte of Hanover and Queen in Prussia.\n\nThey had eight children, seven of whom reached adulthood. Caroline moved to Britain permanently in 1714 when her husband became Prince of Wales. As Princess of Wales she joined Prince George Augustus, Prince of Wales, in rallying political opposition to his father, King George I.\n\nIn 1717, after a family row, Prince George Augustus, the Prince of Wales was expelled from court. Caroline came to be associated with Robert Walpole, an opposition politician who was a former government minister. Walpole rejoined the government in 1720, and Prince George Augustus reconciled publicly with his father on Walpole’s advice. Over the next few years Walpole rose to become the leading minister.\n\nUpon her husband’s accession in 1727, as King George II of Great Britain and Ireland, Caroline became Queen and Princess-Electress of Hanover, and her eldest son, Prince Frederick Louis, Duke of Edinburgh, became Prince of Wales.\n\nPrince Frederick Louis, the Prince of Wales, was a focus for the opposition, like his father before him, and Caroline’s relationship with him was strained.\n\nAs Princess and as Queen, Caroline was known for her political influence, which she exercised both through and for Walpole. Her tenure included four regencies, which occurred during King George II’s stays in Hanover; she is credited with strengthening the House of Hanover’s place in Britain during a period of political instability. After her death in 1737, Caroline was widely mourned by her political allies as well as by the King, who refused to remarry.\n\nDuchy of Brittany\n\nIn 1524, the Dauphin inherited the Duchy of Brittany on his mother’s death, becoming Duke François III, although the Duchy was actually ruled by officials of the French crown. In 1532, after much discourse with the Breton deputies, demands were laid before the French crown.\n\nThe Dauphin was to arrive at Rennes as Duke François III and owner of the duchy, King François I would be granted usufruct and management of it and, after the union with France, the Dauphin would sign an oath that respects the duchy’s rights and privileges.\n\nDuke François III agreed to these demand and passed an edict annexing the duchy of Brittany to France. On August 1532, 14, the Dauphin was crowned Duke François III in Rennes Cathedral.\n\nUpon King Henri II of France’s succession to the French throne in 1547, the Duchy and the crown were effectively merged, the Breton estates having already tied the succession of the Duchy to the French crown.\n\nThe Dauphin François died at the Château de Tournon on August 10, 1536, at the age of eighteen. The circumstances of his death seemed suspicious, and it is believed by many that he was poisoned. However, there is ample evidence that he died of natural causes, possibly tuberculosis.\n\nAfter playing a round of tennis at a jeu de paume court “pré[s] d’Ainay”, the Dauphin asked for a cup of water, which was brought to him by his secretary, Count Montecuccoli. After drinking it, François collapsed and died several days later.\n\nMontecuccoli, who was brought to the court by Catherine de’ Medici, was accused of being in the pay of Emperor Charles V, and when his quarters were searched a book on different types of poison was found. Catherine de’ Medici was well known to have an interest in poisons and the occult. Under torture, Montecuccoli confessed to poisoning the Dauphin and was executed.\n\nIn an age before forensic science, poison was usually suspected whenever a young healthy person died shortly after eating or drinking. There was no way to pinpoint and trace the substance after death; therefore, it was considered a quick, easy and untraceable form of homicide. There have been several other suspected cases of political murder by poison in the French royal family throughout the ages.\n\nFrançois III (February 28, 1518 – August 10, 1536) was Dauphin of France and, after 1524, Reigning Duke of Brittany.\n\nFrançois and his brother, Henri, were exchanged as hostages for their father, King François I of France, who had been captured at the Battle of Pavia. They would be hostages for three years. Made Duke of Brittany in 1532, this precipitated Brittany’s integration within the Kingdom of France. Prince François died August 10, 1536, possibly from tuberculosis.\n\nLife\n\nPrince François was the first son of King François I of France and Duchess Claude of Brittany, the eldest daughter of King Louis XII of France and Duchess Anne of Brittany. Because of the Salic Law the throne of France went to Prince François, Count of Angoulême, the son of Prince Charles, Count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy. He succeeded his first cousin once removed and father-in-law King Louis XII, who died without a legitimate son. Claudia inherited her mother’s Duchy upon her mother’s death.\n\nKing François I said of Prince François at birth, “a beautiful dauphin who is the most beautiful and strong child one could imagine and who will be the easiest to bring up.” His mother said, “tell the King that he is even more beautiful than himself.” The Dauphin was christened at Amboise on April 25, 1519. Leonardo da Vinci, who had been brought to Amboise by King François I, designed the decorations.\n\nOne of the most researched aspects of the Dauphin’s short life is the time he and his brother Prince Henri (later King Henri II of France) spent as hostages in Spain.\n\nThe king had been badly defeated and captured at the Battle of Pavia (1525) and became a prisoner of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (King Carlos I of Spain), initially in the Alcázar in Madrid. In order to ensure his release, the king signed the Treaty of Madrid (1526). However, in order to ensure that Francis abided by the treaty, Emperor Charles V demanded that the king’s two older sons take his place as hostages. King François agreed.\n\nOn March 15, 1526, the exchange took place at the border between Spain and France. King François almost immediately repudiated the treaty and the eight-year-old Dauphin and his younger brother Prince Henri spent the next three years as captives of Emperor Charles V, a period that scarred them for life.\n\nDuring his confinement in Spain, the Dauphin displayed a notably subdued demeanor compared to his more aggressive brother and seemed “to have accepted the rationale for his imprisonment reasonably well.” Nevertheless, the experience led him to become somewhat isolated, favoring black attire (like a Spaniard) and exhibiting a contemplative disposition seen as more Spanish than French.\n\nMarriage arrangements\n\nAs the first son and heir of the King of France, the Dauphin was a marriage pawn for his father. There were several betrothals to eligible princesses throughout the Dauphin’s life.\n\nThe first was when he was an infant, to the four-year-old Princess Mary of England (later Queen Mary I of England), daughter of Henry VIII of England and Infanta Catherine of Aragon; this arrangement was made as a surety for the Anglo-French alliance signed in October 1518, but abandoned around 1521 when Princess Mary was instead betrothed to Emperor Charles V.\n\nMargaret of Scotland (February 28, 1261 – April 9, 1283) was Queen of Norway as the wife of King Eric II of Norway. She is sometimes known as the Maid of Scotland to distinguish her from her daughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway, who succeeded to the throne of Scotland.\n\nEarly life\n\nMargaret was born on February 28, 1261 at Windsor Castle. She was the firstborn child of King Alexander III of Scotland and Margaret of England, Alexander’s first wife.\n\nPrincess Margaret of England was the second child of King Henry III of England and his wife, Eleanor of Provence, the second daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence (1198–1245) and Beatrice of Savoy (1198–1267), the daughter of Thomas I of Savoy and his wife Margaret of Geneva.\n\nA committee of five earls, four bishops, and four barons were tasked with ensuring that the King’s firstborn child was brought safely to Scotland. She was followed by two brothers, Alexander and David. Queen Margaret (of England) died in 1275, but letters written by the younger Margaret point to an affectionate relationship with her uncle King Edward I of England.\n\nQueen of Norway\n\nMargaret stayed unmarried until the age of 20, which is remarkably long for a medieval princess. She was finally betrothed to King Eric II of Norway, in 1281. The intent was to ease the tensions that developed between Norway and Scotland in the previous decades.\n\nAccording to chroniclers, Margaret was against the match, but her father insisted. The Scottish crown gave her and Eric the estates of Rothiemay in Banffshire, Belhelvie in Aberdeenshire, Bathgate in West Lothian, and Ratho in Midlothian as her dowry.\n\nThe treaty arranging the marriage specified that Margaret and her children would succeed to the throne of Scotland if King Alexander died leaving no legitimate sons and if no legitimate son of his left legitimate children.\n\nMargaret sailed into the port of Bergen in the early morning of August 15. Her marriage to the 13-year-old king of Norway was celebrated two or three weeks later, making her Queen of Norway.\n\nShe was crowned by Jon Raude, Archbishop of Nidaros, Christ Church, Bergen. A cultured woman, Margaret probably found it difficult to adapt to married life with an uncultured adolescent.\n\nScots reported that she tried to “cultivate” Eric by teaching him French and English, table manners, and fashion. Her mother-in-law, Ingeborg of Denmark, undermined her position as Queen and dominated the court.\n\nBetween March and April 9, 1283, Queen Margaret gave birth to her only child, Margaret, known as the Maid of Norway, in Tønsberg. She died during or shortly after childbirth, and was buried in Christ Church in Bergen. As Margaret’s brothers both predeceased her father, her daughter succeeded to the Scottish throne in 1286.\n\nChristian I (February 1426 – May 21, 1481) was a German noble and Scandinavian monarch under the Kalmar Union. He was king of Denmark (1448–1481), Norway (1450–1481) and Sweden (1457–1464).\n\nFrom 1460 to 1481, he was also Duke of Schleswig (within Denmark) and Count (after 1474, Duke) of Holstein (within the Holy Roman Empire). He was the first King from the House of Oldenburg.\n\nKing Christian I was born in February 1426 in Oldenburg in Northern Germany as the eldest son of Count Dietrich of Oldenburg by his second wife, Helvig of Holstein (died 1436). Christian had two younger brothers, Maurice (1428–1464) and Gerhard (1430–1500), and one sister Adelheid.\n\nChristian’s mother, Helvig, was a daughter of Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein, and a sister of Adolphus, Duke of Schleswig.\n\nThrough his mother, Christian was also a cognatic descendant of King Eric V of Denmark through his second daughter Richeza (died 1308) and also a cognatic descendant of King Abel of Denmark through his daughter Sophie.\n\nThrough his father, Christian was a cognatic descendant of King Eric IV of Denmark through his daughter Sophia. Christian thus descended from the three surviving sons of Valdemar II and his second wife Infanta Berengaria of Portugal. He was also a cognatic descendant of King Magnus III of Sweden.\n\nIn January 1448, King Christopher III of Denmark, Sweden and Norway died suddenly and without natural heirs. His death resulted in the break-up of the union of the three kingdoms, as Denmark and Sweden went their separate ways and Norway’s affiliation was unclear.\n\nThe vacant Danish throne was first offered by the Council of the Realm to Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, being the most prominent feudal lord of Danish dominions. The duke declined and recommended his nephew, Count Christian of Oldenburg.\n\nBefore being elected, Christian had to promise to obey the Constitutio Valdemariana, a provision in the ascension promissory of King Valdemar III of Denmark, that promised that in the future, the same person could never be both ruler of the Duchy of Schleswig and Denmark simultaneously.\n\nThe council also demanded that Christian should marry dowager Queen Dorothea of Brandenburg (ca 1430–1495), widow of his predecessor King Christopher III.\n\nOn September 1, 1448, after signing his ascension promissory, Count Christian was elected to the Danish throne as King Christian I of Denmark at the assembly in Viborg.\n\nHis coronation was held on October 28, 1449, in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, at which occasion his marriage with dowager Queen Dorothea was also celebrated.\n\nSweden elected Carl Karl Knutsson King of Sweden with the intent to reestablish the Kalmar Union under a Swedish king.\n\nKing Carl VIII of Sweden was born in October 1408 or 1409, at Ekholmen Castle, the son of Knut Tordsson (Bonde), knight and member of the privy council (riksråd), and Margareta Karlsdotter (Sparre av Tofta), the only daughter and heiress of Carl Ulvsson, Lord of Tofta. Carl was elected King of Norway in the following year.\n\nRegnal name\n\nCarl Knutsson was the second Swedish king by the name of Carl. Carl VIII is a posthumous invention, counting backwards from Carl IX (r. 1604–1611) who adopted his numeral according to a fictitious history of Sweden. King Carl VIII was the first Swedish monarch of the name to actually use a regnal number as Carl II (later retrospectively renumbered VIII), on his wife’s tombstone (1451) at Vadstena.\n\nKing Christian I of Denmark subsequent accessions to the thrones of Norway (in 1450) and Sweden (in 1457) restored the unity of the Kalmar Union for a short period. In 1463, Sweden broke away from the union and Christian’s attempt at a reconquest resulted in his defeat by the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471.\n\nIn 1460, following the death of his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein, Christian also became Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein.\n\nIn 1474 Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III elevated Christian I from Count of Holstein to Duke of Holstein, thus becoming an immediate imperial vassal of the Emperor.\n\nKing Christian died at Copenhagen Castle on May 21, 1481 at the age of 55. He was interred at the Chapel of the Magi at Roskilde Cathedral, a richly decorated chapel he and Queen Dorothea had erected to serve as a family sepulchral chapel for the House of Oldenburg.\n\nChristopher III (February 26, 1416 – January 5/6, 1448), known as Christopher of Bavaria, was King of Denmark (1440–48, as Christopher III), Sweden (1441–48) and Norway (1442–48) during the era of the Kalmar Union.\n\nHe was the son of Count Palatine Johann of Neumarkt (1383–1443) and Catherine of Pomerania (c. 1390–1426). Catherine was the daughter of Wartislaw VII, Duke of Pomerania in Pomerania-Stolp, and sister of the Scandinavian king, Eric of Pomerania.\n\nEric of Pomerania was initially co-ruler of the Kalmar Union with his great-aunt Queen Margrethe I of Denmark until her death in 1412. Eric is known as Eric III as King of Norway (1389–1442), Eric VII as King of Denmark (1396–1439) and has been called Eric XIII as King of Sweden (1396–1434, 1436–39).\n\nEric of Pomerania was ultimately deposed from all three kingdoms of the Kalmar Union, but in 1449 he inherited one of the partitions of the Duchy of Pomerania and ruled it as duke until his death in 1459.\n\nCount Palatine Johann of Neumarkt was a son of King Rupert of the Romans-Germany (1352–1410). Prince Christopher was probably born at Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz in Upper Palatinate, in Bavaria, Germany.\n\nEric of Pomerania was deposed as king of Denmark and Sweden in 1439. Eric’s nephew, Christopher, who was rather unfamiliar with Scandinavian conditions, was elected by the Danish State Council as the successor to his uncle, first as regent from 1439, and then proclaimed King Christopher III of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (Danish landsting) on 9 April 1440.\n\nHe was meant to be a puppet, as evidenced by the saying: “Had the Council demanded the stars of heaven from him, he would have ordered it.” However he succeeded in maintaining some personal control.\n\nAs a whole his rule, according to the politics of the nobility and his succession, might be called the start of the long period of balance between royal power and nobility which lasted until 1660. He was later elected King of Sweden in 1441, and King of Norway in June 1442.\n\nIn 1445, Christopher married Princess Dorothea of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1430 – November 25, 1495) in Copenhagen. Princess Dorothea of Brandenburg-Kulmbach was born in 1430 or 1431 to Margrave Johann of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, and Princess Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg (1405–1465), the daughter of Rudolf III, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg.\n\nFrom about the age of eight, Princess Dorothea of Brandenburg-Kulmbach lived in Bayreuth, where her father was ruler.\n\nIn 1443, Prince Christopher of Bavaria, the newly elected King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, inherited Oberpfalz close to Bayreuth, and a marriage was suggested between Christopher and Dorothea to secure her father’s support for Christopher’s power over his German domain. The engagement was proclaimed prior to the application of Papal dispensation for affinity in February 1445, which was approved March 10 by Pope Julius II.\n\nOn September 12, 1445, the wedding ceremony was conducted between Christopher and Dorothea in Copenhagen, followed by the coronation of Dorothea as Queen. The King had financed it with a special tax in all three Kingdoms, and the occasion is described as one of the most elaborate in Nordic Medieval history.\n\nFor himself, King Christopher III used an otherwise unknown title, Arch-King, because in his opinion he ruled an Empire, not simply three different and distinct Kingdoms, and thus he believed he ranked immediately after the European Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe Kalmar Union Treaty was changed so that the aristocracy had most of the policy-making powers, and the king lost many of the powers monarchs had acquired since Viking times. The results of this policy of balance were still not reached when he suddenly died.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1448, King Christopher III died suddenly at Helsingborg at age 31. He was the last descendant of King Valdemar IV of Denmark.\n\nKing Christopher III was buried in Roskilde Cathedral. His widow, Queen Dorothea, married the newly elected King of Denmark, Count Christian I of Oldenburg.\n\nHenry Frederick, Prince of Wales, KG (February 19, 1594 – November 6, 1612), was the eldest son and heir apparent of King James I-VI of England, Scotland and Ireland; and his wife Princess Anne of Denmark, the second daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark and Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nHis name derives from his grandfathers: Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley; and King Frederik II of Denmark. Prince Henry was widely seen as a bright and promising heir to his father’s thrones.\n\nPrince Henry was born at Stirling Castle, Scotland, and became Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland automatically on his birth.\n\nKing James VI worried that the mother’s tendency toward Catholicism might affect the son. The child’s removal to Stirling caused enormous tension between Anne and James, and Henry remained there under the care of Mar’s family until 1603.\n\nKing James VI wrote a note to the Earl of Mar in June 1595 instructing him, in the event of his death, not to deliver Prince Henry to Anne of Denmark or the Parliament of Scotland until he was 18 and gave the order himself.\n\nKing James VI of Scotland became King James I of England and Ireland in 1603 at the Union of the Crowns and his family moved south. Anne of Denmark came to Stirling to collect her son, and after an argument with the Prince’s keepers, Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar and the Master of Mar, was allowed to take Prince Henry to Edinburgh on May 28. On the following Sunday Anne took him to St Giles Kirk in her famous silver coach. Anne and Henry arrived in England, at the fortified town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, on June 1.\n\nWith his father’s accession to the throne of England in 1603, Prince Henry at once became Duke of Cornwall. In 1610 he was further invested as Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, thus for the first time uniting the six automatic and two traditional Scottish and English titles held by heirs-apparent to the two thrones.\n\nThe prince’s popularity rose so high that it threatened his father. Relations between the two could be tense, and on occasion surfaced in public. At one point, they were hunting near Royston when James criticised his son for lacking enthusiasm for the chase, and initially moved to strike his son with his cane, but Prince Henry rode off. Most of the hunting party then followed the son.\n\nPrince Henry is said to have disliked his younger brother, Prince Charles, and to have teased him, although this derives from only one anecdote: when Prince Charles was nine years of age, Prince Henry snatched the hat off a bishop and put it on the younger child’s head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Prince Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Prince Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs. Prince Charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears.\n\nPrince Henry died from typhoid fever at the age of 18, during the celebrations that led up to his sister Elizabeth’s wedding to Prince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate of the Rhine (The diagnosis can be made with reasonable certainty from written records of the post-mortem examination, which was ordered to be carried out in order to dispel rumours of poisoning.) It was reported that his last words were to ask for his sister Princess Elizabeth.\n\nAfter Henry’s death, the prince’s brother Charles fell ill, but he was the chief mourner at the funeral, which King James (who detested funerals) refused to attend. The body lay in state at St. James’s Palace for four weeks.\n\nOn December 17, over a thousand people walked in the mile-long cortège to Westminster Abbey to hear a two-hour sermon delivered by George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As Henry’s body was lowered into the ground, his chief servants broke their staves of office at the grave.\n\nPrince Henry’s death was widely regarded as a tragedy for the nation. According to Charles Carlton, “Few heirs to the English throne have been as widely and deeply mourned as Prince Henry.”\n\nHenry’s titles of Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay passed to Prince Charles, who until then had lived in Henry’s shadow. Four years later Prince Charles, by then 16 years old, was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.\n\nHad the Prince of Wales lived to succeed the thrones, he would have become King Henry IX of England, Scotland and Ireland."
