        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. Charlotte Louise Juliette Louvet was born illegitimately in 1898, but became a princess a few months before her 21st birthday when she was formally adopted by her natural father. Of which country was she installed as heir to the throne?\n\nAnswer: Monaco\n\nCharlotte Louvet, later known as Princess Charlotte of Monaco, Duchess of Valentinois, was the daughter of the future Prince Louis II of Monaco and a French singer, Marie Juliette Louvet. By 1918 Monegasque sovereignty was at risk as Louis, the only heir, had no legitimate children and Charlotte was ineligible to succeed him as a result of her illegitimate birth. A treaty made with France meant that if the Monegasque throne became vacant then the country would become a French protectorate. Luckily the law offered a loophole. Although illegitimate children were excluded from the line of succession, any adopted children were eligible. Louis promptly adopted his own daughter and she was then named as his heir, granted the status of being a princess, and given the traditional title of Duchess of Valentinois.\n\nHowever, Charlotte never became the sovereign princess of Monaco as she renounced her right to the throne in favour of her son, Rainier. He went on to become Prince Rainier III and gained international fame as a result of his marriage to the American Hollywood star, Grace Kelly.\n\n2. Princess Charlotte of Prussia suffered from ill-health throughout her life and in her letters described symptoms such as abdominal pain, facial blisters and dark red urine. This information has led modern researchers to conclude that she may have suffered from which illness - that was also thought to have afflicted Charlotte's 'mad' great-great-grandfather, Britain's King George III?\n\nAnswer: Porphyria\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Prussia was a granddaughter of Britain's Queen Victoria and the younger sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II - the ruler who led Germany into the First World War. Like many other princesses she married within her extended family - in her case to a second cousin, Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen - a tradition which undoubtedly contributed to the prevalence of inherited diseases amongst European royalty.\n\nCharlotte's only child, Feodora, was the first born Queen Victoria's 87 great-grandchildren. Feodora also suffered severe ill-health during her lifetime and eventually committed suicide following the Second World War. Modern tests carried out on the remains of both Charlotte and her daughter revealed evidence that supported the theory that their medical problems may have been related to porphyria - the illness commonly blamed for causing the 'madness' of King George III and also believed to have afflicted other members of British royalty dating back to King James I of England and VI of Scotland in the 17th century.\n\n3. Princess Charlotte of Belgium became known as the Empress Carlotta when Napoleon III appointed her husband to the position of Emperor of which country in 1864?\n\nAnswer: Mexico\n\nPrincess Charlotte, the daughter of King Leopold I of the Belgians, married Archduke Maximilian of Austria in 1857. Emperor Napoleon III of France (the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte) instigated the French invasion of Mexico in 1861, starting an episode known as the 'French Intervention in Mexico' (to give one of its many names). As part of this policy, Napoleon III decided to install an Emperor of Mexico who would be subordinate to the French government; Archduke Maximilian accepted the post in 1864 and both he and his wife sailed to Mexico. However, Charlotte's reign as Empress of Mexico was short-lived as her husband was executed just three years later by republican forces who returned Mexico to an independent state.\n\nCharlotte was in Europe at the time of her husband's death. She had initially travelled there with the intention of gaining European support for his regime, but ended up suffering a breakdown and being unable to return to Mexico. Her brother had her assessed by doctors who pronounced her insane and she spent the rest of her long life (she died in 1927 at the age of 86) living a secluded life in Italy and Belgium.\n\n4. Princess Charlotte of Clarence was the first of four grandchildren of Britain's King George III who were born in 1819, including her first cousin, the future Queen Victoria. However, she had a tragically short life, dying in what circumstances?\n\nAnswer: She died only a few hours after her birth\n\nFollowing the death in childbirth in 1817 of King George III's only legitimate grandchild, Princess Charlotte of Wales, his remaining unmarried sons (most of whom were happily living with their mistresses) were forced to rush out in search of royal wives and produce additional heirs to the throne. In 1819, four new heirs made their appearance, but the first of those babies, the daughter of Prince William of Clarence, lived for just a few hours after her birth. As her father went on to become King William IV, Princess Charlotte would eventually have become Britain's queen (rather than her first cousin Queen Victoria) if she had survived. Her mother and father went on to have a further five children, but tragically four of them were stillborn and a younger sister was born prematurely and lived for only 3 months.\n\nThe other three royal heirs born in 1819 were Prince George, Duke of Cambridge; Queen Victoria; and King George V of Hanover.\n\nAfter the death of two British princesses named Charlotte in the space of two years, the name was not given to another British princess until the birth of Princess Charlotte of Cambridge nearly 200 years later.\n\n5. Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna of Russia (who was born Princess Charlotte of Württemburg in 1807) was a noted patron of the arts. Which of the following institutions did she have a role in founding?\n\nAnswer: Saint Petersburg Conservatory\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Württemburg became engaged to Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich of Russia in 1822 at the age of 15. Mikhail was the youngest son of Tsar Paul I of Russia, who was assassinated when Mikhail was just three years old. Charlotte converted from Lutheranism to Russian Orthodoxy before her marriage, taking the name Elena Pavlovna from that point. Although the marriage lasted 25 years and resulted in five daughters, Elena and Mikhail were not believed to have been happy together.\n\nFollowing her husband's death in 1849, she became involved with many charities and organisations and patronised the arts and music - most notably the composer, Anton Rubinstein. Elena and Rubinstein were instrumental (no pun intended) in setting up the first Russian school of music, the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, in 1862. The school's alumni includes famous names such as Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich.\n\nThe State Hermitage Museum was founded by Catherine the Great in 1764 although the collection did not open to the public until 1852; the Bolshoi Ballet was founded in 1776; and the Imperial Music Choir began in 1882 and is now known as the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n6. Alexandra Feodorovna who became Empress of Russia on December 1st 1825, was known as Princess Charlotte of Prussia before her marriage to the future Nicholas I. In which aptly named palace was she born?\n\nAnswer: Charlottenburg Palace\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Prussia was born in 1797 in the Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin, the main residence of her parents King Frederick William III of Prussia and his wife, Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her full name was Princess Frederica Louise Charlotte Wilhelmina of Prussia, but she was commonly known as Charlotte.\n\nThe Charlottenburg Palace (or Schloss Charlottenburg in German) dates back to 1695 and was built during the reign of King Frederick I of Prussia and named in honour of his wife, Sophia Charlotte, who do not live to see the building fully completed. It remained a royal residence (although not always a main one) of the German royal family until the late 19th century. Although heavily damaged by bombing in the Second World War, it was repaired and restored and is now a major tourist attraction in Berlin.\n\nKing Nikola's Palace in Cetinje, Montenegro is a former seat of the Montenegrin royal family; the Winter Palace in St Petersburg was the official residence of the Russian royal family prior to the revolutions of 1917; and Alexandra Palace in London was formerly used for television broadcasting by the BBC and is not a 'palace' in the royal sense of the word.\n\n7. Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only daughter of King George IV, was named after both her grandmothers. What was the middle name that she shared with her maternal grandmother, who was also a British princess?\n\nAnswer: Augusta\n\nPrincess Charlotte Augusta of Wales was King George III and Queen Charlotte's only legitimate grandchild and her death following childbirth in 1817 caused a succession crisis for the British royal family as well as a public outpouring of grief. The whole country went into mourning with many public services including the law courts, markets, docks and shops closing for two weeks in tribute to her. Her death also led to reforms in obstetric practices after much criticism was levelled at the medical team who attended her throughout her ultimately fatal two day labour. The 21 year old princess was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor along with her stillborn son.\n\nCharlotte's parents, the future King George IV and Caroline of Brunswick, were first cousins. Charlotte's maternal grandmother was Princess Augusta of Great Britain, King George III's elder sister. The incorrect options are the names of King George III's younger sisters, who all also died at a tragically young age - Princesses Elizabeth and Louisa had both suffered life-long serious ill-health before dying aged 18 and 19 respectively while Princess Caroline Matilda managed to both marry and divorce the King of Denmark before dying at the age of 23.\n\n8. Princess Charlotte, the eldest daughter of King George III of Great Britain, was also known by which of these titles?\n\nAnswer: Princess Royal\n\nThe title 'Princess Royal' was first introduced in the 17th century by Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of King Charles I. Henrietta Maria was a French princess before her marriage and wanted to emulate the title of 'Madame Royale' that was granted to the French monarch's eldest daughter. However, the title is not granted automatically and not all of the eldest daughters of subsequent British monarchs have received it - there can only be one Princess Royal at a time and the title was not given to several princesses who had married into other European royal families before the title became vacant. Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter, Princess Anne, was granted the title in 1987, 22 years after the death of the previous holder, her great-aunt Mary.\n\nCharlotte, Princess Royal was born in 1766 and later married Prince Frederick of Württemberg in 1797. Her parents, King George III and Queen Charlotte, were notoriously unwilling to allow their daughters to mix in society or marry into foreign royal families, which explains why Charlotte was not married until the age of 31 (a late age for marriage in the 18th century) and several of her younger sisters never married at all. Charlotte eventually became Queen of Württemberg, but died childless in 1828.\n\nCharlotte's sister, Elizabeth, held the title of Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg later in life after her husband became the Landgrave (a noble title used in the Holy Roman Empire). Another sister, Mary, became Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh after marrying her first cousin, the duke of both those cities.\n\n9. In 1744, a Princess Charlotte (who later became a British queen) was born at the Untere Schloss (or Lower Castle) in the German town of Mirow. In which German Duchy, a state of the Holy Roman Empire, was she born?\n\nAnswer: Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz married Britain's King George III in 1761, and together they went on to have 15 children in their 57 years of marriage. As queen, Charlotte held the record as the longest serving consort to a British monarch until April 18th 2009, when it was surpassed by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (the husband of Queen Elizabeth II). Unsurprisingly, given the length of her tenure, Queen Charlotte's name has been given to many places around the world including the city of Charlotte, North Carolina; Queen Charlotte Sound in British Columbia, Canada; and both Mecklenburg Counties in North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nMirow can now be found in north-east Germany, in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Mirow Castle was built in 1707 by the architect Joachim Borchmann and is located near the southern end of Mirower See (a lake). The smaller Lower Castle was built in 1735 for Charlotte's father, Carl, who at that time was the heir presumptive to the Dukedom. Despite their names, neither building bears any resemblance to a typical medieval castle - there are no moats, defensive walls or towers in sight! The town is tiny, with about 3,450 inhabitants (in 2012).\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire, which covered much of central Europe in the 18th century, was split in to hundreds of smaller states including many principalities, duchies and territories as well as the larger kingdoms of Prussia and the Habsburgs (who also held nominal control of the 'empire' as Holy Roman Emperors). Caroline of Ansbach was the consort of King George II, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha was King George III's mother and Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was Queen Victoria's mother.\n\n10. Princess Charlotte Amalie served as regent of the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen for nearly 20 years in the late 18th century. During this period she was credited with 'saving' Saxe-Meiningen with which policies that wouldn't be out of place in 21st century European government?\n\nAnswer: Austerity measures and economic reform\n\nPrincess Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Philippsthal (1730-1801) became the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen at the age of 20 when she married the 63-year-old duke, Anton Ulrich. Unsurprisingly given life expectancy at the time, she was left widowed in 1763 and named as regent for her young son Karl Wilhelm. Charlotte took an active role in managing the duchy which was suffering severe economic problems and instituted a programme of austerity and economic reforms as well as appointing new government ministers. The country's finances were soon turned around and the princess' success was recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor when he placed her in charge of the economic revival of the neighbouring Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen in 1769.\n\nThrough her son, Georg, Princess Charlotte Amalie was the grandmother of Queen Adelaide of the United Kingdom (after whom the city of Adelaide in Australia was named).\n\nSince the first vaccine wasn't developed until 1796 - when Edward Jenner produced one for smallpox - and Saxe-Meiningen was a land-locked area that is now part of the German state of Thuringia, Charlotte Amalie could hardly have achieved success with either vaccination programmes or warships. She was also not known for promoting education for the masses. In fact all of the incorrect options were in opposition to the austerity measures she actually implemented.\n\nSource: Author Fifiona81\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor bloomsby before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
