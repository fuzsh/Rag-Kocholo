        "text": "Bridgerton fans will be excited to learn that the show’s prequel has been released on Netflix.\n\nQueen Charlotte will follow the story of how the young princess fell for King George III, before being forced to take over his duties as Regent.\n\nBut who was Queen Charlotte, and how much of the story is true?\n\nWhat can we expect from Queen Charlotte?\n\nFans of Shonda Rhimes’s Regency-era costume romance Bridgerton are in for a treat with this limited series prequel featuring the back story of young Princess Charlotte and her courtship and marriage to King George III.\n\nThe Netflix synopsis reads: “Centred on Queen Charlotte’s rise to prominence and power, this Bridgerton-verse prequel tells the story of how the young Queen’s marriage to King George sparked both a great love story and a societal shift, creating the world of the Ton inherited by the characters in Bridgerton.”\n\n“This is not a history lesson,” as the narrator Julie Andrews reminds us “dear readers”. “All liberties taken by the author are quite intentional.” As with Bridgerton itself, it’s more Gossip Girl than Jane Austen, with India Amarteifio playing Charlotte – a German princess who tries to escape on her wedding day. Golda Rosheuvel, meanwhile, reprises her role as the older Charlotte in a parallel set of flash-forwards.\n\nWho was she in real life?\n\nThe Royal Family’s website reads: “Born Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz on 19 May 1744, she was the youngest daughter of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Princess Elisabeth Albertina of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\n\n“Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a small northern German duchy in the Holy Roman Empire, and Charlotte was born and brought up at Untere Schloss (Lower Castle) in Mirow.\n\n“When King George III of Britain succeeded to the throne in 1760, he was 22 and unmarried and the 17-year-old Princess Charlotte was an obvious choice for a wife.\n\n“The King announced to his council in July 1761 his intention to wed the Princess, after which a party of escorts, led by The Earl of Harcourt, departed for Germany to bring Princess Charlotte to England. They arrived on 14 August, 1761 and were received by Charlotte’s brother, the current Duke, and the marriage contract was signed. Three days of celebrations followed and on 17 August the Princess departed for Britain. The voyage was difficult, with three storms at sea, arriving in London on 8 September.\n\n“At 9pm the same evening, within six hours of arrival, the wedding of Princess Charlotte and King George III took place at the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace. Their coronation took place on 22 September that year.”\n\nThe couple went on to have many children. Less than a year later, on 12 August, 1762, she gave birth to the Prince of Wales, who would later become King George IV. They had a total of 15 children over the course of their marriage.\n\nQueen Charlotte was a music fan, enjoying German music including Handel, and she was also a keen amateur botanist who loved Kew Gardens, then called Dutch House. She also founded many orphanages and was patron of the General Lying-in Hospital, which is the Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea Hospital today.\n\nDespite these interests and achievements, Charlotte is perhaps most famous because of her husband’s failing mental health, which saw her take a more active role in governing than the wives of kings usually did.\n\nThe website continues: “Queen Charlotte was kept unaware when King George III suffered his first, although temporary, bout of mental illness in 1765. However, The Regency Bill of 1765 stated that if The King should become permanently unable to rule, Charlotte would become Regent.\n\n“During the 1788 illness of the King there was conflict between the Queen and the Prince of Wales about a Regency. In the Regency Bill of 178, the Prince of Wales was declared Regent, should the King become permanently insane, but it also placed the King himself, his court and minor children under the guardianship of the Queen. After the onset of George III’s permanent madness in 1811, The Prince of Wales became Regent, but Charlotte remained her husband’s guardian until her death in 1818.\n\n“The Queen died in the presence of her eldest son, The Prince Regent, at Dutch House (now Kew Palace) on 17 November 1818 and was buried at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.”\n\nWas she black?\n\nThere has long been a theory that Charlotte was black or mixed race, though some historians dispute the idea.\n\nHistorian Mario de Valdes y Cocom says the Queen’s features in royal portraits are conspicuously African, and argues that this was commented on at the time.\n\nHe adds that Charlotte was descended from a branch of Portuguese royalty that was related to Margarita de Castro e Souza, a 15th-century Portuguese noblewoman nine generations removed. Her ancestry comes from Alfonso III and his lover Madragana, who is thought to have been a Moor, in the 13th century.\n\nHistorian Kate Williams tells The Guardian: “If she was black this raises a lot of important suggestions about not only our Royal Family but those of most of Europe, considering that Queen Victoria’s descendants are spread across most of the royal families of Europe and beyond. If we class Charlotte as black, then ergo Queen Victoria and our entire royal family, [down] to Prince Harry, are also black … a very interesting concept.”\n\nSome historians have disputed if this is possible, however, with some claiming there was no branch of the Portuguese royal family that was black.\n\nIn her review of Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story for i, Francesca Steele writes: “The colour-blind casting of Bridgerton, creating an implausibly tolerant Regency Britain, has always been a point of interest and even contentions. But here it moves from being colour-blind to intentional.\n\n“In Queen Charlotte, set several decades before the Bridgerton era, the court is extremely concerned about their new queen’s skin colour. “Paint her lighter,” commands the austere Princess Augusta (Game of Thrones’s Michelle Fairley) to a hapless court portraitist.\n\n“On Charlotte’s ascension to the throne, middle-class Black citizens are given new titles to normalise the whole thing, but it’s not clear exactly how this “great experiment” will pan out, nor whether the established white class will accept it.”\n\nHow can I watch Queen Charlotte?\n\nQueen Charlotte is streaming now on Netflix."
