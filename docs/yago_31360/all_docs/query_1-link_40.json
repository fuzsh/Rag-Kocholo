She was the youngest daughter of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Prince of Mirow and his wife, Princess Elizabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\n\nShe was a granddaughter of Adolf Frederick II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz by his third wife, Christiane Emilie Antonie, Princess of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. Her father’s elder half brother reigned from 1708 to 1753 as Adolf Friedrich III.\n\nThe children of the duke were all born at Schloss Mirow, a modest palace, or rather country house. The daily life at Mirow was nearly that of the family of some simple English country gentleman. [1] The morning was devoted to study and instruction in needlework, embroidery, and lace-making, in which the daughters were very skilfull They were brought up in the most careful way, receiving an admirable education, and being grounded in religious principles under the direction of their mother. [2] They were further directed by M. Gentzner, a Lutheran minister of many accomplishments, who had a particular knowledge of botany, mineralogy, and science. [3]\n\nMarriage\n\nWhen King George III succeeded to the throne of England upon the death of his grandfather, George II, it was considered right that he should seek a bride who could fulfill all the duties of her exalted position in a manner that would satisfy the feelings of the country at large. [4] George was originally smitten with Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of the Duke of Richmond, but his mother the Dowager Princess of Wales and political advisor Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage.\n\nColonel Graeme, who had been sent to the various courts of Germany on a mission of investigation, reported the charms of character and the excellent qualities of mind possessed by the seventeen year old Princess Charlotte. [5] She was certainly not a beauty, but her countenance was very expressive and showed extreme intelligence ; not tall, but of a slight, rather pretty figure ; her eyes bright and sparkling with good humour and vivacity; her mouth large, but filled with white and even teeth ; and her hair a beautiful light brown colour. [6]\n\nThe King announced to his Council in July 1761, according to the usual form, his intentions respecting his marriage with the Princess, and Lord Hardwicke was despatched to Mecklenburg to solicit her hand in the King’s name. [7] Charlotte’s brother Adolf Friedrich IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (reigned 1752–94) and her widowed mother, who actively sought a prominent marriage for the young princess, received him with every honour that the little Court was capable of showing him, and returned within a month after having completed all the necessary preliminaries, well pleased with his mission. [8]\n\nAt the end of August 1761 the cortege arrived that was to conduct Princess Charlotte to England: the Duchess of Ancaster, the Duchess of Hamilton, Ladies of the Bedchamber ; Mrs. Tracey, Bedchamber Woman; Earl Harcourt, Proxy for the King; and General Graeme, set out on their route. [9] A most dreadful storm of thunder overtook them, and the lightning set fire to several trees along a road through which they had to pass. [10]\n\nThey arrived nevertheless in safety at Cuxhaven, and embarked on a squadron of British yachts and warships under Admiral Anson (including the specially renamed HMY Royal Charlotte). They were nine days at sea due to a storm, the voyage being usually accomplished in about three days. Instead of going on to land at Greenwich, where everything was prepared for the reception of the Princess, Admiral Anson thought it better to make for the nearest port and docked at Harwich, where they remained at anchor for the night. This was on Sunday, the 6th of September, and landing the next morning they travelled to Essex, where they rested, and then continued their journey towards London. Arriving at St. James’s Palace on September 7th, she met the King and the royal family. The following day at nine o’clock (September 8th) the ceremony took place in the Chapel Royal and was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Secker. [11]\n\nLife as Queen\n\nUnfortunately, there can be little doubt that the early married life of the young Queen was scarcely a happy one. The King was worried with ministerial troubles, and the princess dowager, secure in the support of the favourite Lord Bute, was able to exert all the influence and authority which age and knowledge of the world and the position of a parent would give her over a young and inexperienced couple. [13] The young queen was unable to resist, and sort of palace despotism developed where her mother-in-law controlled all her actions. The king himself, strongly under his mother’s influence, was not inclined to interfere, and assumed that all was done rightly. Already she was not allowed to be too intimate with the English ladies of her household. It was laid down as being formal etiquette of the court that they should not approach her save under the direction of her German attendants. Card-playing, which she loved, was presently interdicted. [14]\n\nNaturally, too, there were the German and the English factions of dependents; each jealously contending for their royal mistress’s favour, dictating the terms and conditions of their service, and threatening to go back to Germany unless particular privileges were given them. The poor queen had about as much anxiety and trouble with her dependents as her husband had with his insubordinate ministers or servants. [15]\n\nDespite this the marriage was a success, and on August 12, 1762, the Queen gave birth to her first child, the Prince of Wales, who would later become George IV. On September 13, the Queen attended went to the Chapel Royal to offer the usual thanksgiving which took place after childbirth. The ceremony of christening the Prince of Wales, which took place at St. James’s Palace, was attended with every circumstance of splendour. The cradle upon which the infant lay was covered with a magnificent drapery of Brussels lace. [16] In the course of their marriage, they had 15 children, all but two of whom (Octavius and Alfred) survived into adulthood.\n\nAround this time the King and Queen moved to Buckingham House, at the western end of St. James’s Park, which would later be known as Buckingham Palace. The house which forms the architectural core of the present palace was built for the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 to the design of William Winde. Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham’s descendant, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1761 to George III for £21,000[17] (£3,000,000 as of 2010).[18]\n\nThe house was originally intended as a private retreat, and in particular for Charlotte, and was known as The Queen’s House[19]—14 of their 15 children were born there. St. James’s Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence.[20]\n\nInterests and patronage\n\nGeorge III and Queen Charlotte were music connoisseurs and passionate admirers of George Frideric Handel; both had German taste, and gave special honour to German artists and composers. [21]\n\nIn 1764 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, then aged eight, arrived in Britain with his family as part of their grand tour of Europe and remained from April, 1764, until July, 1765. [22] The Mozarts were summoned to court on May 19, and played before a limited circle from six to ten o’clock. Johann Christian Bach, eleventh son of the great Johann Sebastian Bach, was then music-master to the Queen, put the difficult works of Handel, Bach, and Abel before the boy. He played them all at sight, and those present were quite amazed. [23] Afterwards he accompanied the Queen in an aria which she sang, and played on theflauto traverno in a solo. [24] On October 29, they were in town again, and were invited to court to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the King’s accession. As a memento of the royal favour, his father Leopold Mozart published six sonatas composed by Wolfgang, known as Mozart’s Opus 3, and were dedicated to the Queen on January 18, 1765, dedication she rewarded with a present of fifty guineas. [25]\n\nQueen Charlotte was an amateur botanist who took a great interest Kew Gardens, and, in an age of discovery, when travellers and explorers such as Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks were constantly bringing home new species and varieties of plants, saw that the collections were greatly enriched and expanded. [26] Her interest in botany led to the magnificent South African flower, the Bird of Paradise, being named Strelitzia reginae in her honour. [27]\n\nAmong the royal couple’s favored craftsmen and artists were the cabinetmaker William Vile, silversmith Thomas Heming, the landscape designer Capability Brown, and the German painter Johann Zoffany, who frequently painted the king and queen and their children in charmingly informal scenes, such as a portrait of Queen Charlotte and her children as she sat at her dressing table.[28]\n\nThe queen also founded orphanages and a hospital for expectant mothers. The education of women was a great importance to her, and she saw to it that her daughters were better educated than was usual for young women of the day. However, she insisted that her daughters live restricted lives close to their mother, and refused to allow them to marry until they were well-advanced in years, with the result that none of her daughters had legitimate issue (one, Princess Sophia, may have had an illegitimate son).\n\nIn 2004, the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace staged an exhibition illustrating George and Charlotte’s enthusiastic arts patronage, which was particularly enlightened in contrast to that of earlier Hanoverian monarchs; it compared favorably to the adventuresome tastes of the king’s father, Frederick, Prince of Wales.\n\nUp until 1788, portraits of Charlotte often depict her in maternal poses with her children, and she looks young and contented.[29] However, in that year her husband fell seriously ill and became temporarily insane. It is now thought that the King was suffering from a genetic metabolic disorder, porphyria, but at the time the cause of the King’s illness was unknown. Sir Thomas Lawrence’s portrait of her at this time marks a transition point after which she looks much older in her portraits. Indeed, the Assistant Keeper of Charlotte’s Wardrobe, Mrs. Papendiek, wrote that the Queen was “much changed, her hair quite grey”.[30]\n\nRelations with Marie Antoinette\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 probably added to the strain that Charlotte felt.[32] Queen Charlotte and Queen Marie Antoinette of France kept a close relationship. Queen Charlotte was 11 years older than the Queen of France yet they shared many interests, such as their love of music and the arts in which they both enthusiastically took an interest. Never meeting face to face they kept the friendship to pen and paper. Marie Antoinette confided in the Queen of Great Britain upon the outbreak of the French Revolution. Queen Charlotte had even organized apartments to be prepared and ready for the refugee royal family of France to stay in.[33] After the execution of Marie Antoinette and the bloody events that followed, Queen Charlotte was said to be shocked and overwhelmed that such a thing could happen to a kingdom, and right on Britain’s doorstep.\n\nHusband’s illness\n\nAfter the onset of his madness, George III was placed in the care of his wife, who could not bring herself to visit him very often, due to his erratic behaviour and occasional violent reactions. However, Charlotte remained supportive of her husband as his illness, now believed to be porphyria, worsened in old age. While her son, the Prince Regent, wielded the royal power, she was her husband’s legal guardian from 1811 until her death in 1818.\n\nLater life\n\nThe queen died in the presence of her eldest son, the Prince Regent, who was holding her hand as she sat in an armchair at the family’s country retreat, Dutch House in Surrey (now known as Kew Palace). She was buried at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. Her husband died just over a year later. She is the second longest-serving consort in British history, having served as such from her marriage (on 8 September 1761) to her death (17 November 1818), a total of 57 years and 70 days.\n\nHer eldest son, the Prince Regent, claimed Charlotte’s jewels at her death, but the rest of her property was sold at auction from May to August 1819. Her clothes, furniture, and even her snuff was sold by Christie’s.[34] It is highly unlikely that her husband ever knew of her death, and he died, blind, deaf, lame and insane, fourteen months later.\n\nIssue\n\nSee also: Descendants of George III and Queen Charlotte"
