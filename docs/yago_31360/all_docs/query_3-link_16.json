        "text": "From this wikipedia article:\n\nAdolphe I, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (Adolph Wilhelm August Karl Friedrich of Nassau-Weilburg) (July 24, 1817 – November 17, 1905) was the last Duke of Nassau, and the fourth Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nHe was a son of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau (1792 - 1839) and his first wife Charlotte Luise Friederike of Saxe-Altenburg. Adolphe's half-sister, Sophia of Nassau, married King Oscar II of Sweden.\n\nAdolph became Duke of Nassau on August 30, 1839, after the death of his father. He supported the Austrian Empire in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. After Austria's defeat, Nassau was annexed to the Kingdom of Prussia.\n\nIn 1879, Adolphe's niece Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, the daughter of another of his half-sisters, married her distant relative King William III of the Netherlands. In 1890, their only daughter Wilhelmina succeeded to the Dutch throne, but was excluded from the succession to Luxembourg by the Salic Law. The Grand Duchy, which had been linked to the Netherlands since 1815, passed to the Dutch royal family's distant relative - the dispossessed Duke Adolphe. The Grand Dukes of Luxembourg are still descendants of Adolphe, although through female lines.\n\nOn January 31, 1844, Adolph married Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mikhailovna of Russia, niece of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. She died less than a year afterwards in childbirth with a stillborn daughter.\n\nOn April 23, 1851, he remarried Princess Adelheid-Marie of Anhalt-Dessau (25 December 1833-24 November 1916), a daughter of Friedrich, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. They had five children, of whom only two lived to the age of eighteen and to become prince and princess of Luxembourg.\n\nPrince William (1852–1912)\n\nPrince Friedrich (28 September 1854-23 October 1855)\n\nPrincess Marie (14 November 1857-28 December 1857)\n\nPrince Franz (30 January 1859-2 April 1875 Vienna)\n\nPrincess Hilda Charlotte Wilhelmine (1864 - 1952), married HRH Friedrich II, Grand Duke of Baden.\n\nIn 1892, Grand Duke Adolphe conferred the hereditary title Count of Wisborg on his Swedish nephew, Oscar, who had lost his Swedish titles after marrying without his father's approval. Wisborg (also spelt Visborg) was the old castle in the citry of Visby within Prince Oscar's lost Dukedom of Gotland, but the title itself was created in the nobiliy of Luxembourg.\n\nFrom this wikipedia site:\n\nElizabeth Mikhailovna, Grand Duchess of Russia (Moscow, 26 May 1826 - Wiesbaden, 28 January 1845) was the second child and daughter of Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich of Russia and Princess Charlotte of Wurttemberg who took the name Elena Pavlovna upon her conversion to the Orthodox faith. Through her father, Elizabeth was a granddaughter of Tsar Paul I of Russia, and a niece of both Russian emperors Alexander I and Nicholas I.\n\nElizabeth, nicknamed \"Lili\", was born in the Kremlin in Moscow and she was named after her aunt who had died eariler that month, the Empress Elizabeth, wife of Emperor Alexander I and a close friend of Elena Pavlovna. She grew up with her other siblings in the Mikhailovsky Palace in Saint Petersburg. Elizabeth was said to be the prettiest among her sisters, and like her mother, Elena Pavlovna, Elizabeth was graceful in manners and well-educated. By the end of 1843, Adolf, Duke of Nassau was visiting St Petersburg and met Elizabeth for the first time. Adolf's stepmother was Princess Pauline of Wurttemberg, Elizabeth's maternal aunt, and so he was related to the Russians in some way. Adolf and Elizabeth fell in love and they eventually got married in 31 January 1844 in St Petersburg. Elizabeth was 17 years old and Adolf was 26.\n\nAfter the wedding, the couple stayed in Russia for some time until they moved to Germany and took up residence in Castle Biebrich in Wiesbaden. Elizabeth, now Duchess of Nassau, was popular among the people.\n\nShe and Adolf were happily married and the news that she was already pregnant with their first child brought great happiness to the couple. Unfortunately, their happiness would not last long and after only a year, Elizabeth died giving birth to a daughter, who didn't survive as well. The grief-stricken Adolf ordered the construction of a Russian Orthodox church - the St. Elizabeth's Church in Neroberg Park, Wiesbaden - to house the remains of his beloved wife. The location of the church on the hill was chosen by Adolf himself so that he could always have a view of the church from his residence. Elizabeth's sarcophagus can still be seen today inside the church.\n\nToday I learned that he inherited Luxembourg due to Salic law and being the 17th cousin once removed of William III of the Netherlands, which seems insane, to put it mildly, and is apparently a record for \"farthest inheritance of a crown\".\n\nIt was semi-Salic law, actually. See Article 42 from the original Nassau Family Pact.\n\nHow in the world was there nobody in line before him?\n\nIn bygone times it was less unusual for boys and men to die prematurely, and for younger sons especially to remain unmarried, and so male lines went extinct with some frequency. The sons of Adolphe's predecessor King-Grand Duke Willem III died at fairly young ages.\n\nThere weren't any legitimately born MEN that were only born direct line males between the King and him. Plenty of men born to princesses and their descendants but no male to male to male to male etc... men between the two.\n\nThere was Georg of Merenberg, but he was a morganaut without inheritance rights.\n\nThanks, Tatiana.\n\nI see article 42 is about the extinction of the whole House, but unfortunately I can't read German so I'm unable to see the semi-Salic distinction.\n\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around \"17th cousin once removed\".\n\nNot only do I have a feeling we must have at least a few of those of current royals as members posting here, even in the Netherlands, where they famously had no boys, I don't think they were nearly at \"17th cousin once removed\", even when it was Wilhelmina and then Juliana alone!\n\nNot sure what you mean. Adolphe was Wilhelmina's father's successor because within the Dutch royal family no closer relative met the criteria - and Wilhelmina was a girl and her three half-brothers had passed away without issue.\n\nInterestingly, enough; Willem and Adolphe were also third cousins:\n\nStadtholder Willem IV - Stadtholder Willem V - King Willem I - King Willem II - King Willem III\n\nStadtholder Willem IV - Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau - Fürst Friedrich Wilhelm of Nassau-Weilburg - Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau(-Weilburg) - Grand duke Adolphe of Luxembourg\n\nAnd, just out of curiosity... who was the common ancestor for Willem and Adolphe?\n\nGreat question: I had no idea, so tried to decipher it:\n\nLUXEMBOURG\n\n1-Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (1817-1905)\n\n2-Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau (1792-1839)\n\n3-Friedrich Wilhelm, Fürst of Nassau-Weilburg (1768-1816)\n\n4-Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg (1735-1788)\n\n5-Karl August, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg (1685-1753)\n\n6-Johann Ernst, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1664-1719)\n\n7-Friedrich, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1640-1675)\n\n8-Ernst Casimir, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1607-1655)\n\n9-Ludwig II, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1565-1627)\n\n10-Albrecht, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1537-1593)\n\n11-Philipp III, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1504-1559)\n\n12-Ludwig I, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1473-1523)\n\n13-Johann III, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1441-1480)\n\n14-Philipp II, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1418-1492)\n\n15-Philipp I, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1368-1429)\n\n16-Johann I, Count of Nassau-Weilburg (1309-1371)\n\n17-Gerlach, Count of Nassau (1283-1361)\n\n18-Adolf, King of Germany (1255-1298)\n\n19-Walram II, Count of Nassau (1220-1276)\n\n20-Heinrich/Hendrik II, Count of Nassau (1180-1250)\n\nTHE NETHERLANDS\n\n1-Willem III, King of the Netherlands (1817-1890)\n\n2-Willem II, King of the Netherlands (1792-1849)\n\n3-Willem I, King of the Netherlands (1772-1843)\n\n4-Willem V, Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of the Netherlands (1748-1806)\n\n5-Willem IV, Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of the Netherlands (1711-1751)\n\n6-Johan Willem Friso, Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of Friesland & Groningen (1687-1711)*\n\n7-Hendrik Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz, Stadtholder of Friesland & Groningen (1657-1696)\n\n8-Willem Frederik, Prince of Nassau-Dietz, Stadtholder of Friesland, Groningen & Drenthe (1613-1664)\n\n9-Ernst Casmir I, Count of Nassau-Dietz, Stadtholder of Friesland, Groningen & Drenthe (1573-1632)\n\n10-Johann/Jan VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg (1536-1606)\n\n11-Willem I, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg (1487-1559)**\n\n12-Johann/Jan V, Count of Nassau-Vianden-Dietz (1455-1516)\n\n13-Johann/Jan IV, Count of Nassau-Dietz-Dillenburg (1410-1475)\n\n14-Engelbert I, Count of Nassau (1370-1442)\n\n15-Johann/Jan I, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg (1340-1416)\n\n16-Otto II, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg (1305-1351)\n\n17-Heinrich/Hendrik I, Count of Nassau-Siegen (1270-1343)\n\n18-Otto I, Count of Nassau (?-1289)\n\n19-Heinrich/Hendrik II, Count of Nassau (1180-1250)\n\n* Most recent common ancestor of all European royal thrones\n\n** Father of Willem the Silent\n\nWhy so many generations back to find a heir\n\nNext I looked into why no descendants of any previous ancestors were available (in most cases I only mention sons as daughters were not eligible):\n\n1-Willem III, King of the Netherlands (1817-1890) - 3 sons died unmarried\n\n2-Willem II, King of the Netherlands (1792-1849) - 4 sons;

Otherwise you end up with a \"King Ralph\" scenario.\n\nSemi-Salic and Salic primogeniture have been the prevailing modes of succession in modern European monarchies until several decades ago. It would be interesting to know why the Luxembourg scenario was not repeated in other monarchies; perhaps they had better luck producing male heirs within the nearest family.\n\nThanks, Somebody.\n\nWhat I mean is, even with the incredibly short and basically critical line of succession the Netherlands had for a while, I don't believe that either Wilhelmina's or Juliana's prospective heir was anything even close to 17th-once-removed, rather something you didn't need to go to the 10th century for.\n\n17th-cousin-once-removed is so astonishing I'd be astounded if even a modern peerage was inherited that way. Otherwise you end up with a \"King Ralph\" scenario.\n\nI see - however, this would have been the Dutch line of succession it they also had applied salic law (i.e., the limitation that only male-line males could inherit) (and had not put limitations such as explained by Tatiana Maria) - it was for this reason that Wilhelmina was not accepted as her father's successor in Luxembourg but could ascend the throne in the Netherlands.\n\nOf course, because the Dutch throne was open to women there would have been far more options (although the Dutch government made some changes to the law of succession to avoid the 'German cousins' (i.e., descendants of Wilhelmina's aunt) to succeed to the Dutch throne) so therefore is not comparable to a situation in which only men in male-line can inherit.\n\nThanks, Tatiana.\n\nI see article 42 is about the extinction of the whole House, but unfortunately I can't read German so I'm unable to see the semi-Salic distinction.\n\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around \"17th cousin once removed\".\n\nNot only do I have a feeling we must have at least a few of those of current royals as members posting here, even in the Netherlands, where they famously had no boys, I don't think they were nearly at \"17th cousin once removed\", even when it was Wilhelmina and then Juliana alone!\n\nAnd, just out of curiosity... who was the common ancestor for Willem and Adolphe?\n\nDespite the far removed connection between Willem III of Orange-Nassau and Adolf of Nassau, there were plenty of links between the two Houses. Of course the marriage in 1760 of Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau with Prince Carl-Christian of Nassau, direct ancestors of the current grand-ducal family.\n\nThe last Grand-Duke from the Orange-Nassau branch, King Willem III, was married with Emma von Waldeck und Pyrmont. Emma's mother (and thus Willem III's mother-in-law) was Princess Helena of Nassau, sister of Adolf of Nassau...\n\nIt is believed that Emma urged her husband to respect the Nassau Family Pact (and not alter it in favour of their daughter and heiress Princess Wilhelmina) so that her uncle Adolf's (and her mother's) Nassau branch would become a reigning dynasty again.\n\nThe links between the two Houses were pretty close via Emma and her mother Helena, respectively the wife of Willem III and the sister of Adolf.\n\nDespite the far removed connection between Willem III of Orange-Nassau and Adolf of Nassau, there were plenty of links between the two Houses. Of course the marriage in 1760 of Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau with Prince Carl-Christian of Nassau, direct ancestors of the current grand-ducal family.\n\nTrue. It would be interesting to find out who was their nearest common ancestor (in contrast to their very far removed common male-line ancestor). Perhaps Somebody or one of the other genealogy experts here knows the answer to that?\n\nIt is believed that Emma urged her husband to respect the Nassau Family Pact (and not alter it in favour of their daughter and heiress Princess Wilhelmina) so that her uncle Adolf's (and her mother's) Nassau branch would become a reigning dynasty again.\n\nI am not sure this is true, but I have heard somewhere that this influenced Grand Duke Adolph to acquiesce to Queen Wilhelmina's request for his permission to pass on the name of Nassau to her descendants. (Legally, I suppose he had no power over the name of the Dutch royal house, but apparently his consent as head of the house of Nassau was considered crucial by Queen Wilhelmina and Queen Emma.)\n\nSo, except for Adolphe his son and brother, there were no other male-line heirs among any of his predecessors descendants?\n\nCorrect. If you review one of the the family trees of the House of Nassau that are available online, it is interesting (though perhaps not unusual) how a house with so many members was reduced to so few.\n\nTrue. It would be interesting to find out who was their nearest common ancestor (in contrast to their very far removed common male-line ancestor). Perhaps Somebody or one of the other genealogy experts here knows the answer to that?\n\nI believe their nearest common ancestor would be Stadtholder Willem IV.\n\n(repeated from previous post for clarity):\n\nWillem and Adolphe were also third cousins:\n\nStadtholder Willem IV - Stadtholder Willem V - King Willem I - King Willem II - King Willem III\n\nStadtholder Willem IV - Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau - Fürst Friedrich Wilhelm of Nassau-Weilburg - Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau(-Weilburg) - Grand duke Adolphe of Luxembourg\n\nI am not sure this is true, but I have heard somewhere that this influenced Grand Duke Adolph to acquiesce to Queen Wilhelmina's request for his permission to pass on the name of Nassau to her descendants. (Legally, I suppose he had no power over the name of the Dutch royal house, but apparently his consent as head of the house of Nassau was considered crucial by Queen Wilhelmina and Queen Emma.)\n\nIt makes sense given their close relations that both of them were supportive of the other.\n\nCorrect. If you review one of the the family trees of the House of Nassau that are available online, it is interesting (though perhaps not unusual) how a house with so many members was reduced to so few.\n\nIt seems that a few generations above Heinrich II too little data is available to go back any further, so probably there are others but they are not recorded and therefore, it seems they were the last known descendants.\n\nIn the official biography of King Willem III it was stated that according experts the understanding of any Erbverein was: a treaty between sovereign princes of different Houses within a dynasty with as ultimate aim to keep the sovereign rights and possessions inside said dynasty.\n\nTherefore the Nassauischer Erbverein was originally signed by the sovereign princes of Orange-Nassau, Nassau-Weilburg, Nassau-Saarbrücken and Nassau-Usingen.\n\nNassau-Saarbrücken and Nassau-Usingen soon became extinct and were inherited by Nassau-Weilburg (since 1806 Nassau).\n\nThe four original sovereign Houses were now reduced to two. When in 1866 Nassau ceased to be a reigning House, the Erbverein became void, according some experts. That was not a generally shared opinion. But it changed in 1867 when the King of Prussia and the Duke of Nassau agreed in a Treaty with returning parts of his lost domains and a financial compensation of 15 million in golden Guilders, a gigantic fortune for that time.\n\nAccording King Willem III of the Netherlands, Grand-Duke of Luxembourg, with this Treaty the Duke of Nassau not only forfeited his sovereign rights, by doing so he had to compensate him because the purpose of the Erbverein was exactly to keep it all in the dynasty. This is documented in a correspondence between The Hague and Wiesbaden.\n\nWhen the Prince of Orange died in 1884, the King realized he had to make amendments to the Constitution of the Grand-Duchy, in which the succession was based on the Nassauischer Erbverein. The Luxembourgian Prime Minister of the time, baron Félix de Blochausen agreed with the King.\n\nIn 1884 the King announced a visit to Luxembourg and wanted to hold an Address from the Throne. His purpose was to announce that in case of his death, leaving a minor heiress, Queen Emma would become the Regentess for his successor in Luxembourg: Princess Wilhelmina. The Luxembourgian Cabinet agreed with this view. Reason: better a far away Grand-Duchess in The Hague, than a nosy Duke of Nassau in Luxembourg interrupting the sea of freedom the Cabinet enjoyed under Willem III and expected to enjoy under Wilhelmina.\n\nThe Dutch Cabinet had mixed feelings about Luxembourg. In the framework of the gigantic colonial Empire, the personal union with Luxembourg was more a side detail, but nevertheless one which could drag the Netherlands into an international conflict, after all the ministers were responsible for the King who was also the Grand-Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nIn 1884 the King's counsels Constant graaf van Lynden van Sandenburg, Rutger Jan graaf Schimmelpenninck van Nijenhuis and Julius graaf van Zuylen van Nijvelt tried to have an audience to discuss \"the Luxembourgian Question\" with the King.\n\nBut out of fear for the King's bad temper, especially when it was about matters of the dynasty and about an affair not within the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the three gentlemen requested an audience with Queen Emma.\n\nOut of dynastic feelings for her uncle and her mother, the Queen encouraged the three gentlemen to resist the attempts of Baron Félix de Blochausen (the Luxembourgian Prime Minister) to change the succession. After some time the Queen herself carefully discussed the topic with King Willem III. He indeed was open to his spouse's charm and diplomatic skills. In the end the King authorized Constant graaf van Lynden van Sandenburg to negotiate a Treaty with the Duke of Nassau. Thanks to this Treaty, the personal union between the Netherlands and Luxembourg would cease with the death of Willem III. His spouse's uncle, Adolf, Duke of Nassau, would become a sovereign prince again.\n\nIt was. The different states of the Holy Roman Empire were often inherited by other, often quite distant, male-line descendants of the ruling house when a specific ruling branch became extinct. A prominent example of a pact similar to that of the House of Nassau is the Treaty of Pavia from 1329 which regulated inheritance in the House of Wittelsbach and led to Maximilian of Pfalz-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld becoming Elector of Bavaria in spite of it being almost 500 years since the two lines split. Other examples, but to my knowledge without a specific pact, are the frequent reorganisations of the Thuringian duchies of the House of Wettin.\n\nNot quite as many generations as the examples you gave, but due to Salic Law King Henry III of France was succeeded in 1589 by a very distant cousin Henry IV (Henry III of Navarre). Their common male-line ancestor was Louis IX (1214-1270).\n\nInterestingly enough, through his mother Henry IV was also \"heir of the body\" of Louis X (1289-1316). Following the death of Louis's posthumous son John I (b-d 1316), Louis's daughter Jeanne was passed over in favor of his brother, Philip V, in the first implementation of Salic law. Jeanne was compensated with Navarre."
