        "text": "Condolences must be universal, because Aunt was extremely loved and respected, because much involved in charity work and in favor of the poor and underprivileged.\n\nDuke Ernst Anton Karl Ludwig of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (2/1/1784-29/1/1844)\n\nReading about this man you will see two things why he had so very little compassion for his elder sister Juliane and why Prince Albert was the way he was, Ernst was a selfish arrogant man who cared very little for anyone but himself he is the absolute least likeable of his family.\n\nIn Gotha on 3 July 1817, Ernest married Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg the seventeen year old daughter of Duke Augustus of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg they would have two children together but their marriage was an unhappy one because of Ernst’s infidelities and the couple separated in 1824. St. Wendel, in the Principality of Lichtenberg, was assigned as her new residence (it was an exclave of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha; see Sotnick on this period), and Louise was forced to leave her two sons behind. Biographer Lytton Strachey noted in 1921: “The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its morals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and it was rumored that the Duchess followed her husband’s example. There were scandals: one of the Court Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction, was talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.”\n\nOn 31 March 1826 their marriage was officially dissolved. Seven months later, on 18 October 1826, Louise secretly married in St. Wendel her former lover, the Baron Alexander von Hanstein (later created Count of Pölzig and Beiersdrof). In her previous marriage, she had taken great interest in the social life of the principality and was revered as its Landesmutter (literally, “mother of the region”). Nevertheless, this happy life ended in February 1831, when her secret marriage to von Hanstein was discovered and she lost her children permanently.\n\nLouise died of cancer on 30 August 1831, when she was only 30 years old. Years after her death, Queen Victoria described Louise in an 1864 memorandum: “The princess is described as having been very handsome, though very small; fair, with blue eyes; and Prince Albert is said to have been extremely like her”.\n\nIn Coburg on 23 December 1832, Ernest married his niece Duchess Marie of Württemberg, the daughter of his sister Antoinette. They had no children. This marriage made Marie both Prince Albert’s cousin and his stepmother.\n\nErnest had been eager to find a new bride after the death of his first, estranged wife, Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. While Ernest initially sought a wife of high status, he found that his age and poor reputation limited his choices. He settled for Marie, who was thirty-three years old and his niece – uncle-niece relationships were by this time becoming discouraged among European royalty, and Marie was the daughter of Ernest’s sister Antoinette.\n\nAs a result of this union, Marie became stepmother of Ernst and Prince Albert, future husband of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Marie was also their first-cousin. Ernest and his sons met Marie at Thalwitz Castle and accompanied her to the duchies to begin her marriage. She would maintain a happy relationship until death with both of her stepsons, becoming godmother (in absentia) of Victoria and Albert’s first son, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (King Edward VII) in 1841.\n\nHistorian Gillian Gill describes Marie as a “severe and melancholy lady”. Marie and Ernest would have no children, and the two quickly grew apart, largely living on separate estates. By 1843 Marie had adopted a child of “humble parentage”, though Albert cautioned her to avoid giving it hopeless aspirations to rank. He wrote, “I wish you more success than generally attends the education of poor children of the lower ranks by persons of our own.\n\nWhile Albert referred to her as “dear mama” in his letters to her, Marie opted not to attend several important events in her stepsons’ lives, such as their confirmation and Queen Victoria’s coronation (Marie cited inclement weather for the former). Albert and Marie maintained correspondence throughout their lives, which has helped historians gain a better understanding of their relationship.\n\n1, Duke Ernst August Karl Johann Leopold Alexander Eduard of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (1818-1893), he married Princess Alexandrine of Baden on 3 May 1842 they had no children and while Ernst inherited his father’s philandering ways he fathered three illegitimate children Alexandrine remained fiercely loyal to her husband.\n\n2, Prince Franz Albrecht August Karl Emanuel of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (1819-1861), the infamous Prince Albert husband to the iconic Queen Victoria and father to all her children.\n\nThere were also three illegitimate children.\n\n1, Berta Ernestine von Schauenstein (b. 26 January 1817 – d. Coburg, 15 August 1896), born to Sophie Fermepin de Marteaux. She married her first cousin Eduard Edgar Schmidt-Löwe von Löwenfels, the illegitimate son of her father’s sister, Juliane.\n\n2, Ernst Albert Bruno von Bruneck, born to Margaretha Braun. He died young in 1838.\n\n3, Robert Ferdinand von Bruneck, also born to Margaretha Braun. He was created Freiherr von Bruneck in 1856 and died the same year\n\nPrince Ferdinand Georg August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (28/3/1785-27/8/1851)\n\nFerdinand was a general of cavalry in the Austrian Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nIn Vienna on 30 November 1815, Ferdinand married Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya, daughter and heiress of Ferenc József, Fürst Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya. When Antonia’s father died in 1826, she inherited his estates in Hungary. Ferdinand then added the surname Koháry to his own.\n\nFerdinand and Antonia would have four children.\n\n1, King Ferdinand II of Portugal (1816-1885), on 1 January 1836 he married Queen Maria II of Portugal in their sixteen year marriage they had eleven children he married for a second time to Elise Friedericke Hensler a Swiss-born American actress and singer in 1869.\n\n2, Prince August Victor Louis of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1818-1881), he married Princess Clementine of Orleans in 1843 and would have five children the youngest being King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria.\n\n3, Princess Victoria Franziska Antonia Juliane Luise of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (1822-1857), she married Prince Louis of Orleans, Duke of Nemours in 1840 they would have four children.\n\n4, Prince Leopold Franz Julius of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1824-1884), Leopold married a commoner Constanze Geiger She bore him a son, called Franz in Vienna on 12 October 1860. Leopold and Constanze married six months later, on 23 April 1861. Immediately, he recognized his son, who was created Freiherr von Ruttenstein on 24 July 1862. The same day, Constanze was created Freifrau von Ruttenstein in her own right. Because the marriage of his parents was unequal (and thus morganatic), Franz was barred from the succession of Koháry and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Regardless, he died childless and unmarried on 29 August 1899.\n\nPrincess Marie Luise Viktoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (17/8/1786-16/3/1861).\n\nOn 21 December 1803 at Coburg, she married (as his second wife) Charles, Prince of Leiningen(1763–1814), whose first wife, Henrietta of Reuss-Ebersdorf, was her aunt. Charles and Victoria had two children:\n\nThe death of Princess Charlotte of Wales, the wife of Victoria’s brother Leopold in 1817, prompted a succession crisis, and, with Parliament offering a financial incentive, three of Charlotte’s uncles, sons of George III, were prepared to marry. One of Charlotte’s uncles,Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767–1820) proposed to Victoria and she accepted. The couple were married on 29 May 1818 at Amorbach, and again, on 11 July 1818, at Kew, the second ceremony being a joint ceremony at which Edward’s brother, the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV, also married his wife, Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meningen. Shortly after the marriage, the pair moved to Germany, where the cost of living would be cheaper. Soon after, Victoria became pregnant, and the Duke and Duchess, determined to have their child born in England, raced back, arriving at Dover on 23 April 1819, and moved into Kensington Palace, where she soon gave birth to a daughter:\n\n1, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Emich, Prince of Leiningen (1804-1856), he married Countess Maria Klebelsberg in 1829 and they had two children.\n\n2, Princess Feodora of Leiningen (1807-1872), she married Ernst I, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg in 1828 and they would have six children.\n\n3, HM Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India (1819-1901), she of course married her cousin Albert but reigned for sixty three years and gave her name to an era.\n\nKing Leopold I of Belgium (16/12/1790-10/12/1865)\n\nLeopold took a commission in the Imperial Russian Army and fought against Napoleon after French troops overran Saxe-Coburg during the Napoleonic Wars. After Napoleon’s defeat, Leopold moved to the United Kingdom where he married Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only child of the Prince Regent (the future King George IV), thus situating himself as a possible future prince consort of Great Britain. Charlotte died in 1817, although Leopold continued to enjoy considerable status in England.\n\nAfter the Greek War of Independence (1821–32), LeopoId was offered the position of King of Greece but turned it down, believing it to be too precarious. Instead, Leopold accepted the kingship of the newly-established Kingdom of Belgium in 1831. The Belgian government offered the position to Leopold because of his diplomatic connections with royal houses across Europe. In addition, because he was seen as a British-backed candidate, he was not affiliated to other powers, such as France, which were believed to have territorial ambitions in Belgium which might threaten the European balance of power created by the 1815 Congress of Vienna.\n\nIn 1832, Leopold married his second wife, Louise-Marie of Orléans. Louise-Marie was the daughter of Louis Philippe I, the King of the French, enstated in 1830. Leopold and Louise-Marie had four children. On 11 October 1850, Queen Louise-Marie died of tuberculosis, aged 38.\n\n1, Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium (1833-1834)\n\n2, King Leopold killed of Belgium (1835-1909), he married Archduchess Marie Henriette of Austria and had four children as well as two illegitimate children.\n\n3, Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders (1837-1905), he married Princess Marie of Hohenzollern and had five children.\n\n4, Princess Charlotte, Empress of Mexico (1840-1927), she married Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico an Archduke of Austria by birth.\n\nLeopold also had two sons, George and Arthur, by a mistress, Arcadie Meyer (née Claret). George was born in 1849, and Arthur was born in 1852. At Leopold’s request, in 1862 the two sons were created Freiherr von Eppinghoven by his nephew, Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; in 1863 Arcadie was also created Baronin von Eppinghoven.\n\nThat completes the story of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha’s a small German ducky who through marriage and being offered crowns went on the rule vast parts of Europe and while their name had changed in Britain to Windsor they still live on, their blood still flows through many royal houses in Europe both still reigning and those who have long since lost their thrones."
