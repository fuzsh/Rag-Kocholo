        "text": "Gather round, dear gentle readers.\n\nBridgerton is back in the cultural zeitgeist thanks to its new prequel charting the rise to prominence and power of Queen Charlotte.\n\nBut it's immediately clear, through the unmistakable narration of Julie Andrews, that this is not a history lesson.\n\nInstead, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story is \"fiction inspired by fact,\" where all liberties taken are \"quite intentional.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the real Queen Charlotte.\n\nWait, do I need to watch Bridgerton before starting Queen Charlotte?\n\nNo, but it wouldn't hurt, especially if you like the vibe of the show.\n\nThe six-episode prequel series goes back in time to explore how a young Queen Charlotte's marriage to King George III sparked both a great love story and a societal shift.\n\nIt's the origin story to the world of the Ton inherited by the characters in the two existing seasons of Bridgerton.\n\nBut the story also jumps forwards to the Regency era where an established Queen Charlotte berates her adult children for failing to provide her a legitimate heir (thanks in part to her sons making plenty of illegitimate heirs.)\n\nSo while the first two seasons of Bridgerton aren't required viewing, learning the backstory of characters we've come to know and love, including Lady Danbury, makes for a more satisfying watch.\n\nWhat do we know about the real Queen Charlotte?\n\nBorn Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, she was the youngest daughter of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Princess Elizabeth Albertina of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\n\nMecklenburg-Strelitz was a small northern German kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire, and Charlotte was born and brought up at Untere Schloss (Lower Castle) in Mirow.\n\nBorn on May 19, 1744, Charlotte was just 17 when a 22-year-old King George of Britain succeeded to the throne in 1760.\n\nDespite the pair never meeting, Princess Charlotte was considered an obvious choice for a wife for King George, so a party of escorts departed for Germany to bring her to England.\n\nShe really did marry within hours of arriving in the UK\n\nBecause this was the 18th century, Princess Charlotte was given away by her brother, the Duke, who accompanied her on her voyage across the sea – a storyline that's the same in the Netflix series.\n\nAt 9pm the same evening, within six hours of her arrival, Princess Charlotte and King George were married at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace.\n\nSpoiler alert, but less than a year later Queen Charlotte gave birth to her first child, the Prince of Wales, who would later become King George IV.\n\nThe royal couple would go on to have 15 children together – nine boys and six girls – with 13 surviving into adulthood.\n\nWas Charlotte really Britain's first black queen?\n\nThe subject of Queen Charlotte's ancestry gained renewed interest in 2017 when Prince Harry proposed to Meghan Markle, who is biracial.\n\nVarious outlets drew parallels between the Duchess of Sussex and Queen Charlotte, with one headline from People reading: \"Meet Queen Charlotte, the Biracial Royal Who Made History 200 Years Before Meghan Markle!\"\n\nThe theory had been popularised by one historian, but others scholars say it's a myth.\n\nMario De Valdes y Cocom, who describes himself as \"an historian of the African diaspora,\" argued back in 1997 in a piece for PBS Frontline that Charlotte was directly descended from a black branch of the Portuguese royal family: King Alfonso III and his lover, Ouruana, a black Moor.\n\nLoading...\n\nValdes also pointed to certain portraits of Charlotte to support his idea, arguing some of her features were visibly African.\n\nBut other scholars have been highly sceptical of the theory, pointing to inconsistencies in the claim.\n\n\"The problem with the theory is that it's been knocking around on the internet, reported on by the likes of The New York Times, and gained a veneer of respectability,\" historian Lisa Hilton told Insider.\n\n\"But one can say there is absolutely no credible evidence that she was black.\"\n\nAnia Loomba, a professor of literature at the University of Pennsylvania, who also teaches histories of race and colonialism, told the Inquirer if a person was described as a Moor or \"blackamoor,\" it did not necessarily mean they were black.\n\n\"The word 'blackamoor' in Shakespeare's time meant Muslim. It didn't mean black necessarily,\" she said. \"Moors could be white from North Africa.\"\n\nIn 1999, Valdes's research was reported in The London Sunday Times and The Boston Globe, prompting Buckingham Palace to respond.\n\nRobert Lacey, a historian and expert on the British royal family who has consulted on Netflix's The Crown, told Time magazine the evidence needed to say for sure whether Queen Charlotte was mixed race is thought to be lost, so \"nowadays we're just going on anecdotal evidence.\"\n\nWhile Bridgerton was initially criticised for its handling of race, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story is being hailed as the series' most political season yet through its exploration of the harsher realities for people of colour during that time.\n\nQueen Charlotte and King George lived in multiple well known royal households\n\nWhile St James was the official residence of the royal couple, the King purchased Buckingham House, which became Buckingham Palace in 1762 once they moved in.\n\nIn 1792, Queen Charlotte purchased Frogmore House in Windsor Park as a country retreat for her and her unmarried daughters.\n\nIt was here they were able to indulge in their hobbies such as painting, drawing, needlework, reading and botany.\n\nFrogmore House was where Prince Harry and Meghan's evening wedding reception was held, but is not to be confused with nearby Frogmore Cottage, which Queen Elizabeth II gifted the pair as a wedding gift.\n\nAnd yes, Queen Charlotte did introduce the Christmas tree to England\n\nIn Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, we see our protagonist demanding more decorations be added to her Christmas tree as her staff thank her for introducing them to this new tradition.\n\nThis scene is actually pretty true to real life.\n\nThe custom of displaying Christmas trees was introduced to Britain in the late 18th century by Queen Charlotte, although it was a yew tree rather than a fir that was used.\n\nThe tradition was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the 19th century, with images of their family gathering around the Christmas tree being published in the Illustrated London News in 1848."
