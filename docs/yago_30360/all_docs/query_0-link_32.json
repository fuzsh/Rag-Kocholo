        "meta_description": "A Brief History of D&E\n\n\n\n In 1998, All My Children introduced David Hayward to Erica Kane when she rushed her teenage daughter, Bianca, into the ER. Bianca was suffering from an eating disorder and in need of medical attention. \n\n\n David, a world renowned cardiologist, tells Erica that Bianca needs a feeding tube to prevent cardiac damage. From February 1998 to February 1999, we didn’t see them on screen again. \n\n\n Their story began on February 4th, 1999 during the Teens Against Addiction Benefit where a woman named, Vanessa Bennett, suffers from a medical issue that leads her to collapse on the pavement. Erica calls out for Dr. Hayward, who steps over the mysterious woman’s body. This causes Erica to question David’s morals and she begins to investigate David’s relationship with the woman. It is revealed to Erica by Adam Chandler that Vanessa Bennett is David’s estranged mother. \n\n\n A casual encounter in New York City in the midst of a blizzard forces David and Erica to begrudgingly share a car together. On the to Pine Valley, Erica discovers files in David’s bag that show the true paternity of Liza Colby’s unborn child. Erica is enraged and demands that David pull over and drop her off, which incites a fight between them. During their argument, David’s SUV collides with a truck hauling metal wiring. Erica is impaled by a piece of the metal wiring and it nearly kills her. Thankfully, David’s medical skills save her life. As a result of the accident, Erica suffers horrific facial injuries and scaring. Unable to cope, an infuriated Erica decides to seek revenge. After a break-down, Erica knocks David unconscious and he awakens in her basement and looks down to find his hand in a vice. She explains to him that he ruined her career by inadvertently scaring her face, and she planned to ruin his by crushing his dominant hand so that he could no longer perform surgery.\n\n\n During their time in the basement, David and Erica begin to open up to each other. Their relationship dynamic changes when David explains to Erica that his mother pushed his father to suicide. Erica, who had her own troubled childhood, connects with him when he tells her that he believes she is beautiful - scars and all. He realizes how much the accident has affected Erica and encourages her to go through with her initial plans and crush his hand. She refuses and lets him go instead. \n\n\n Eventually, All My Children took David and Erica to Rio where Erica has reconstructive surgery performed on her face and soon thereafter Erica and David begin their secret romance during the of summer 1999.\n\n\n Shortly into their budding romance, Erica’s unrequited feelings for her deceased ex husband, Dimitri Marrick, linger over their relationship which becomes a source of contempt between them. \n\n\n David and Erica’s relationship became public in November of 1999, after David declared his love for Erica. They spend Christmas Eve together and ring in the New Year as a couple at the 2000 Crystal Ball.\n\n\n As their relationship progresses, David proposes to Erica. She accepts his proposal but they never make it to the alter. Bianca returns to Pine Valley permanently after the loss of her father, Travis Montgomery. A grieving Bianca becomes Erica’s main focus, leaving David feeling as though Erica has distanced herself from him. David immerses himself in his work.\n\n\n Erica feels insecure about their relationship and believes David is keeping a secret from her. Their differences lead them to break off their engagement. Erica’s intuition turns out to be correct when it is later revealed that David has been treating, Dimitri, who is very much alive. When she discovers that Dimitri is alive, Erica confronts David in his office and announces that Dimitri is alive but his life has been ruined by Alex Devane. David tells her that he was a fool for thinking that she’d love him and forget Dimitri. She angrily tells him that David never came close to being the man Dimitri is. To prove that he is equal to - if not better than - Dimitri, David clears the desk and they share a steamy moment of passion until Dixie Cooney Martin walks in.\n\n\n Erica finds out that David has been secretly treating Dimitri while allowing Erica to believe that he is dead. This causes further turmoil between them.\n\n\n David and Erica continue to have an inconsistent, on/off again relationship. In October, Erica turns to him when she and Bianca are at odds, they fall into bed together, but are interrupted by a phone call.\n\n\n Obsessed with Dixie Cooney, David begins to dabble in Libidizone, a drug created to arouse hidden sexual desires. He plans to drug Tad Martin, Dixie’s husband, intending for Dixie to catch him in the arms of Leslie Coulson. \n\n\n Their romantic relationship came to an official end when Erica drank a Libidizone laced drink intended for Tad Martin. After sipping the drink, Erica performs a cabaret song in front of the patrons of the Valley Inn dining room.\n\n\n She threatens to scream if David doesn’t make love to her. A concerned Bianca, Leo, and Laura show up at David’s door, searching for Erica. Inside Erica tells them that she is fine and “David is the best”.\n\n\n When she suspected that David drugged her she told him she never wanted to see him again. Again, attempting to drug Tad Martin, David accidentally drugs an entire yacht full of Pine Valley residents after dropping a flask of Libidizone into a punch bowl. The dosing of the punch bowl leads to David’s arrest.\n\n\n In 2001, Brooke English’s adopted daughter, Laura, who happens to be Bianca’s best friend overdoses. This overdose leaves her in need of a complicated heart surgery and transplant. Erica can’t bear the thought of her daughter losing her best friend and vows to bail David out of jail long enough to perform the surgery.\n\n\n In 2003, David and Erica reunite on screen once again. Bianca has been raped and has fallen pregnant, unbeknownst to Erica. David stumbles onto a frantic Bianca, who begs him not to touch her. He soothes her and takes a sobbing Bianca into his arms. David begs Bianca not to shut him out and tells her he cares about her. She faints and David convinces her to go to the clinic.\n\n\n Later, he finds Bianca - who is contemplating suicide - on the roof of the clinic. He convinces her that she’s being irrational and talks her down. David tells her to take care of herself and promises to check up on Bianca. He keeps that promise and stands by Bianca and Erica. When David breaks the news to Erica he believes Bianca has been raped and a horrified Erica is in denial. After much internal debate, Bianca admits to Erica that she has been raped by Michael Cambias, Erica encourages her to press charges. Reluctantly, Bianca agrees but the court determines that it is too late and there isn’t enough evidence to convict Michael Cambias. This is the last time Michael Cambias is seen alive. The residents of Pine Valley all become suspects.  \n\n\n David tells Bianca that she is pregnant. Bianca decides termination is the best course of action to take but ultimately does not go through with it. As she processes her pregnancy, visions of Michael haunt her. \n\n\n Initially, David was arrested for the murder but Erica provided him with an alibi. She claimed that David couldn’t have murdered Michael Cambias because he was in bed with her all night, making love. They share a convincing kiss in Derek’s office but Jack and Derek don’t buy the act. David admits to attempting to chemically castrate Michael Cambias but he tells them he didn’t murder him. It was later revealed that Bianca shot him in self-defense.\n\n\n Unable to cope with the trauma surrounding Bianca’s rape and pregnancy, Erica begins to relive the night of her 14th birthday party where she was raped by her father’s friend, and daughter Kendall’s father, Richard Fields. Due to her PTSD and the strain of her relationship with a pregnant Bianca, Erica begins to self-medicate with alcohol.\n\n\n A drunk Erica lashes out at Bianca, causing Bianca to flee Pine Valley in the midst of a thunderstorm with Babe Chandler, her friend and JR Chandler’s pregnant wife. They arrive at a cabin where Bianca gives birth to Miranda Mona Montgomery and Babe Chandler gives birth to Adam Chandler III. They attempt to call for help but have trouble finding a signal but one call to Paul Cramer (OLTL) manages to go through. Paul, a helicopter pilot and Babe’s ex husband, rescues them. Thinking of his sister, Kelly, who was faking a pregnancy in Llanview, Paul sees this as an opportunity to deliver a baby to his sister. \n\n\n He decides on Adam Jr. This is the beginning of the infamous “baby switch” storyline. Paul hands Miranda over to the Chandlers and keeps Adam Jr. The Chandlers rename Miranda Bess, unaware that their child is with the Cramer family, leaving Bianca to grieve the loss of Miranda. \n\n\n In their grief, Kendall and Bianca begin to blame Erica which pushes her away. Erica’s father, Eric Kane, is on his death bed in Vegas. Erica goes to be by his side and ultimately decides to stay in Vegas, becoming a show-girl under the stage name Desiree Dubios. She meets casino owner, Zach Slater. Zach Slater turns out to be the brother of Michael Cambias and father of Ethan Cambias.\n\n\n During this time, David finds out that he is Babe’s father. Bianca struggles to cope with the loss of Miranda and creates a non-profit called The Miranda Center, desperate to keep Miranda’s memory alive. \n\n\n Later, Babe is told that her child has died and Bess’s true identity is revealed. Krystal and Babe insist that the baby is Babe’s until David finds figures out their scheme. He wants to tell Bianca several times but Krystal and Babe convince him that his love for Babe is stronger than his love for Bianca and he needs to support his daughter. \n\n\n In December, Babe discovers that her son is alive and in Llanview. Babe is on the run with AJ (formerly Adam Jr) when she admits to Bianca that Bess is Miranda. Bianca confronts a drunk JR about Bess’s maternity and a struggle ensues, resulting in Bianca being thrown off of a hotel balcony. Bianca returns to Pine Valley Hospital comatose. Bess’s identity is revealed to Erica by Tad, Krystal and David. Erica convinces Adam to have a doctor conduct a DNA test which confirms that Bess is Bianca’s Miranda. Pine Valley rallies around the Kane family and on a special Christmas episode, Bianca is awoken from her coma by Miranda.\n\n\n Erica vows to never forgive David for his part in the scheme that caused her family so much grief and heartache. \n\n\n In 2008, Pine Valley is hit by a deadly tornado that claims the life of Babe. This leaves Adam Jr (now called Little A) at the center of a custody battle between David and Krystal and Adam and JR. Erica, having dealt with Bianca being taken away, sides with JR and states that children should be with their parents, infuriating David who believes that JR is an unfit parent.\n\n\n During this time, Erica and Jeff Martin’s son, Josh, and Marissa Tasker (who is later revealed to be David’s daughter and Babe’s twin sister) arrive to Pine Valley.\n\n\n Kendall is being treated by David Hayward due to heart damage she sustained in the tornado. David tells Erica that Kendall needs a heart transplant to survive. Josh attempts to rob Zach’s casino and Zach fatally shoots him. Unable to be revived, Erica makes the heart-wrenching decision to let go of Josh to save Kendall. David successfully completes the transplant.\n\n\n In May of 2009, Kendall’s son, Ian, undergoes a valve replacement surgery performed by David. David realizes that the new valve developed by Chandler Enterprises is faulty, nearly resulting in Ian’s death. Erica takes over Kendall’s company, Fusion.\n\n\n Erica and Ryan Lavery begin a short-lived relationship that is interrupted when Erica and Ryan realize that Ryan’s ex wife (and Erica’s former step-daughter), Greenlee Smythe, has been kept alive by David after a ‘fatal’ accident. Greenlee returns to Pine Valley and goes on a warpath when she realizes that Erica and Ryan are together. Greenlee makes plans for a revenge marriage to David. Meanwhile, Erica and Ryan decide to break up. This causes a business war over Fusion. David and Greenlee make it appear as though Erica funneled Fusion profits meant for The Miranda Center.\n\n\n Palmer Courtland dies, leaving Erica a note to retrieve his will in Pigeon Hollow, West Virginia. David tampers with her plane, hoping to ground it in West Virginia until after Greenlee’s Fusion launch. The plane crashes into the mountains, and Erica is rescued by a man named Caleb Cooney. David is devastated when he realizes he might’ve caused Erica’s death.\n\n\n David realizes that Greenlee plans to leave him for Ryan Lavery and fakes his death, attempting to frame Ryan. Instead Greenlee is accused of murder. During this time, Zach Slater dies, leaving Pine Valley to grieve his loss. To the surprise of everyone in the courtroom, David walks into Greenlee’s sentencing. \n\n\n In 2010, David and Ryan are struggling on the rooftop of Ryan’s penthouse when a shot rings out and David collapses to the ground. Erica claims she shot David to protect Ryan. David lapses into a coma when he and Liza Colby (now serving as District Attorney) discuss filing murder charges against Erica. It is later revealed that Kendall shot David, acting out over Zach’s death and Erica covered it up.\n\n\n David recovers from the shooting and tells Erica that he knows Kendall was the shooter. He blackmails her in exchange for keeping the truth a secret.\n\n\n Once again, Kendall needs emergency surgery to save her life. Erica promises to secure David a full pardon provided that he performs the surgery on Kendall. David accepts the terms and saves Kendall’s life.\n\n\n In 2011, Erica is kidnapped and held hostage by a woman named Jane Campbell. Jane has taken extreme steps to become Erica Kane, including changing her facial structure via plastic surgery to look like Erica. \n\n\n David is the only person who realizes that Jane Campebell isn’t Erica when Jane suffers an allergic reaction and David notices the label on her epi pen says “Jane Campbell”. He promises to keep her secret if she would help him purchase Pine Valley Hospital from Greenlee.\n\n\n Jane agrees and becomes romantically involved with David. She ruins her relationship with Jackson Mongtomery and becomes engaged to David. Erica is furious when Jane tells her that she has called off her engagement to Jackson and accepted David’s proposal. She warns her that David is dangerous.\n\n\n Eventually, Jane realizes David has taken advantage of her and Erica convinces Jane to let her go. Erica escapes and searches for Jack. She arrives at ConFusion and interrupts an arguement between David and Jack. She insists that she was kidnapped and recounts the past few months to both men. David takes the opportunity to explain to everyone that Erica has suffered a break from reality and he went along with her fantasies to help her. Jack refuses to believe Erica’s bizarre story and an infuriated Erica stabs David.\n\n\n Instead of pressing charges against Erica, David insists that she needs mental help - forcing her to go to Oak Haven instead of jail. In Oak Haven, Erica meets a cast of old Pine Valley women such as: Janet Green Dillon, Marion Colby Chandler, and her arch enemy Annie Lavery. While in Oak Haven, Erica makes the discovery that previously deceased Dixie Cooney Martin has been kept alive as a patient of Project Orpheus. Project Orpheus is a project that is notorious for bringing residents back from the dead. David’s first patient, Maria Santos, died in 1997 after David arrived in Pine Valley.\n\n\n This further convinces Erica that David was involved in her kidnapping. The women of Oak Haven escape, showing up at Kendall’s door. The people of Pine Valley are shocked to see that Dixie is alive. Jack manages to track down Jane, who admits to the kidnapping. Jane takes the blame for the stabbing as an apology to Erica.\n\n\n Marissa Tasker and Bianca begin a relationship and fight for custody of AJ. They allow David to have a relationship with his grandson much to the dismay of the Chandlers.\n\n\n While on a trip to Paris with Jackson, it is revealed that Kendall’s husband, Zach, is alive. David had saved him after the plane crash. Kendall is elated when Zach returns home. Erica feels more confused and confronts David over her kidnapping. He insists that he has nothing to do with it and warns her that if she pushes him, she’ll never know who else he saved.\n\n\n This leads Erica to question who the mystery person could be. She convinces herself that David saved Mike Roy. She investigates the idea but finds nothing. During a phone call with David, she reprimands him for playing with people’s lives.\n\n\n Later, it is revealed that Stuart Chandler is the last Project Orpheus patient. The residents of Pine Valley get together for a ‘welcome back’ party in Stuart’s honor.\n\n\n The last time David and Erica are seen during the same episode is the finale on September 23, 2011. During the party, David is paid to leave but hides in the tunnels and observes the party. Erica admits to Jackson that she doesn’t want to marry him. An upset Jack storms off and Erica follows him. She declares her love for him in front of everyone, telling him that she needs him. As she chases after him, we see the barrel of a gun rise and a shot rings out from the tunnels before the screen fades to black. \n\n\n In 2013 it’s revealed that Erica is on a long tropical vacation and David returns from 5 years of prison after shooting JR in the tunnels. Marissa Tasker is dead. \n\n\n David and Erica’s First Scene | February 24 1998:\n\n\n Eric rushes a fainting Bianca, who is suffering from the adverse effects of an eating disorder, into the hospital where she meets Dr. David Hayward for the first time.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n David and Erica’s Last Scene | September 1, 2011:\n\n\n During their last scene on screen together, Erica reassures David (and herself) that she is happy and does not need the past. He tells her that he’s happy for her.",

Greenlee returns to Pine Valley and goes on a warpath when she realizes that Erica and Ryan are together. Greenlee makes plans for a revenge marriage to David. Meanwhile, Erica and Ryan decide to break up. This causes a business war over Fusion. David and Greenlee make it appear as though Erica funneled Fusion profits meant for The Miranda Center.\n\nPalmer Courtland dies, leaving Erica a note to retrieve his will in Pigeon Hollow, West Virginia.

She arrives at ConFusion and interrupts an arguement between David and Jack. She insists that she was kidnapped and recounts the past few months to both men. David takes the opportunity to explain to everyone that Erica has suffered a break from reality and he went along with her fantasies to help her. Jack refuses to believe Erica’s bizarre story and an infuriated Erica stabs David.\n\nInstead of pressing charges against Erica, David insists that she needs mental help - forcing her to go to Oak Haven instead of jail. In Oak Haven, Erica meets a cast of old Pine Valley women such as: Janet Green Dillon, Marion Colby Chandler, and her arch enemy Annie Lavery. While in Oak Haven, Erica makes the discovery that previously deceased Dixie Cooney Martin has been kept alive as a patient of Project Orpheus.

He insists that he has nothing to do with it and warns her that if she pushes him, she’ll never know who else he saved.\n\nThis leads Erica to question who the mystery person could be. She convinces herself that David saved Mike Roy. She investigates the idea but finds nothing. During a phone call with David, she reprimands him for playing with people’s lives.\n\nLater, it is revealed that Stuart Chandler is the last Project Orpheus patient.
