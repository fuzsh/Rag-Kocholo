        "text": "College News\n\nStudying Abroad at the Crossroads of Europe\n\nThe Syracuse University center in Strasbourg, France offers an incredible study abroad experience for Engineering and Computer Science students. Located in eastern France on the border of Germany, Strasbourg is centrally located with easy access to Switzerland, Belgium and Italy.\n\n“The study abroad program is part of why I choose Syracuse in the first place,” says Emma Crandall ’25. “Strasbourg was one of the places they made it really easy for me as an engineering major.”\n\n“I love the city. One of my favorite things is how easy it is to get around,” says Declan Wavle ’25. “It’s really an amalgamation of all different cultures coming together.”\n\nSpecially designed programs for second year students allow them to take required courses they need and remain on track for graduation.\n\n“Syracuse does a very good job of making sure we stay on track as engineers even when we are studying abroad,” says Arturo Venegas ’25. “I am taking almost all my courses I need to take for this sophomore year. Which is amazing since that means there is no disruption to my four-year plan”\n\n“That’s one of the best things about this program. You don’t have to sacrifice anything as an engineer,” says Tyler Lavaway ’25.\n\nSyracuse University students get to take some of their classes at France’s National Institute of Applied Science. All classes are taught in English.\n\n“You don’t have to speak French to study in Strasbourg, there is no language requirement but I always say you have to want to learn,” says assistant director Mary Boyington. “You can have a wonderful opportunity, take French classes, live with a host family and learn the French language in an everyday environment.”\n\n“It is really cool how you get to see you major done a different way and it is eye opening,” says Wavle. “You know there is a whole other world out there but you don’t experience it until you are actually there.”\n\nDigging Deep into Soil Analysis\n\nWhether he’s exploring rocky quarries, mountain biking on winding trails, or training for club gymnastics, Trygve Moler prefers the outdoors. Growing up in Montana, he spent his childhood playing in open fields and poking around the wilds, instilling in him a deep appreciation for nature.\n\n“My family camped a lot when I was younger,” he said. “I grew up living on the edges of town with fields and ditches to explore. Even as I’ve gotten older, I’ll take any excuse to be outside.”\n\nHis strong connection to the outdoors also made him aware of the current climate crisis that’s affecting Montana. Soaring temperatures, blazing wildfires, and winters that rival Syracuse’s chilly seasons have wreaked havoc on his home state.\n\n“It’s not hard to notice highly irregular snowfall, extreme forest fires, and smoke when I’m living through them. Right now, Montana is experiencing a serious heat wave,” he said. “Winter is also unpredictable. Sometimes we barely get snow, but other times we get more than expected.”\n\nThese experiences ultimately shaped Moler’s decision to pursue environmental engineering at Syracuse University and further explore his fascination with the natural world. “There really was never a question about it,” he said. “I knew I wanted to be an engineer when I saw environmental was an option. It was an immediate choice.”\n\nWith an internship under civil and environmental engineering professor, Chris Johnson, Moler has gained experience in environmental lab and field work while considering possible career paths. Alongside fellow interns in Johnson’s biogeochemistry laboratory, he’s spent his summer in New Hampshire and Link Hall analyzing phosphorus in soil samples.\n\nPhosphate, a naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus, plays a crucial role in plant growth and development, providing the essential nutrients required for root growth, seed formation, and winter survival. When there’s a sufficient amount of phosphate in the soil, plants can grow to be healthier and stronger. But when there isn’t enough phosphorus, plant growth can be slow.\n\nThe soil samples are collected from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. For decades, scientists have conducted research in the area to better understand the environment and forest ecosystems, making it an ideal spot for analyzing the role of soil phosphorus in forest health.\n\n“Hubbard Brook has a unique history, as some of the most interesting experiments in terms of soil, water, atmosphere, and wildlife took place there,” Moler explained. “It also has some of the longest-running data sets in those fields, as it was founded in the 1960s. For the purposes of my group, Hubbard Brook has the perfect climate to slow the decomposition of organic matter in the soil to a matter of years rather than months, which allows us to study how phosphorus, and many other important nutrients, cycle through the soil.”\n\nMoler’s trip to Hubbard Brook was an amazing opportunity for fieldwork. He and the team stayed in a cabin and journeyed through the wilderness on days it wasn’t raining. Trekking through lush green terrain and flowing brooks, the group used a watershed map with a grid as their guide.\n\nIn certain locations, there would be markers on the ground and on the map which would indicate the areas to collect soil samples from. The soil would be dug from the ground, placed into individual bags, and the size and volume of the soil sample would be recorded. On a typical day, each group would collect samples at between eight and 15 sites.\n\nAfter collecting the samples at Hubbard Brook, Moler and his group returned them to the lab for analysis. He and another intern would take turns preparing the samples to extract various forms of soil phosphorus. The process involved weighing soil samples, mixing acids and bases, shaking them to promote the extraction, and centrifugation to separate the solids from the liquid. The extract solutions were then analyzed for phosphate and total phosphorus.\n\nA segmented flow analyzer was used to analyze phosphate and total phosphorus concentrations in the extract solutions. This device utilizes spectrometry to measure light attenuation or transmittance to determine phosphate concentrations. Before running samples through the machine, the solution must be adjusted to a specific acidity level by adding acids and bases until the sample changes color. Once the solution reaches the desired acidity level, samples can be analyzed by the segmented flow analyzer to determine phosphate concentration in the soil.\n\n“I really enjoy my research,” Moler said. “My coworkers and the lab space are great, and I think this experience will be invaluable in the coming years. This is the most involved work I’ve ever been a part of.”\n\nWhile interning at the biogeochemistry laboratory, Moler was introduced to a field he never knew existed and soon discovered the vastness of environmental research. Something as seemingly simple as soil had extensive research and analysis. Even nutrients found within the soil like nitrogen also had entire papers and in-depth studies, which he found fascinating.\n\n“All the chemistry I’m learning is new. I didn’t even know biogeochemistry crossed over,” Moler said. “That entire area was unknown to me, and I was shocked about how deep every component of it was, including all the elements in the soil. You can read so much about it and all the experiments people have conducted. It was interesting to discover.”\n\nWhen Moler isn’t working at the segmented flow machine, he’s somewhere in the wilderness or participating in physical activities. He’s expressed interest in joining the university’s Outing Club, a pack of outdoor enthusiasts whose adventures consist of weekly trips, ranging from hiking trails to spelunking caves – there couldn’t be a more perfect club for him to join.\n\nHowever, his adventurous spirit goes beyond internships and extracurricular activities. He intends to study abroad in Santiago, Chile, which will allow him to immerse himself in a new culture, explore unfamiliar places, and practice his Spanish.\n\n“Chile was an easy choice for me. In my fourth year of Spanish, I reported on the culture, history, environment, and current affairs of Chile, so I’m already fairly invested in the country,” he said. “I think it’ll be a cool place to study and explore. I’ve also been studying Spanish for four years, so I would love to make the leap to complete fluency.”\n\nMoler considers these experiences to be vital and encourages Syracuse students to seize every opportunity to enhance their college experience through internships, extracurricular activities, and study abroad programs. Such experiences have helped him gain clarity about his future goals and career aspirations.\n\n“For jobs and internships, just get moving,” he said. “I struggled for my first semester to find any opportunities, but it just takes some time and continuous applied effort. Talk to your professors, send emails, ask questions, check on different options, apply regardless of the requirements, and things will happen, especially here in Syracuse.”\n\n“On the other hand, never take yourself too seriously,” he added. “It’s easy to get wrapped up in these big leaps and bounds that college allows us to make. But always remember to take time to have fun and play like a kid.”\n\nIn Civil Engineering We Truss\n\nThe Jesús Izcoa Moure Bridge in Puerto Rico perfectly shows how looks can be deceiving. While it may appear free of noticeable damage when driven over, standing on the bridge reveals that it moves more than expected. This is due to its design as a cable-stayed bridge, where cables play a crucial role in balancing tensions and compressions while distributing weight to the piers and beams. However, the bridge has some cracks in its structure and moves slightly more than it should.\n\nRest assured, the bridge isn’t on the verge of collapse, but it is structurally deficient. This term is used by engineers to describe structures that aren’t in the best shape but still safe to use. And it’s more common than you think. In fact, more than a third of bridges in the United States are structurally deficient as of 2022. However, recent investments in construction aim to tackle the problem of aging infrastructure throughout the country.\n\nAssisting in efforts to improve infrastructure, civil engineering student Alex Torres is currently spending the summer in his home country Puerto Rico gaining structural engineering experience. With the Carrasquillo Engineering Service Group, they’re on a mission to repair the Jesús Izcoa Moure Bridge and other structures in Puerto Rico to ensure their safety.\n\nWearing a helmet, vest, and steel-toe boots, Torres and the service group inspect cracks underneath the bridge, focusing on the beams, which act as the bridge’s support. Using scaffolding to get a better view and make their way around the structure, they also close lanes to restrict the flow of traffic as they scrape and refill areas of the bridge. This is all to balance tension and distribute weight to prevent the bridge from accumulating more pressure and collapsing.\n\n“The bridge is divided into 6 spans and each span is subdivided into 4 squares. The spaces that need to be scrapped or refilled along the bridge are being identified,” Torres explained. “The purpose is that the bridge ends up as leveled as possible and with the most reasonable slope.”\n\nTorres uses a device called Ground Penetrating Radar to avoid damaging crucial structural areas of the bridge. This device sends frequencies to the ground that bounce back when they detect iron rods in the concrete that support the bridge. The frequency data is then passed to a computer, which analyzes wavelengths and shows the highest points. This process determines the depth of any cables, wire tubes, or important structures beneath the concrete, and with this information, Torres can determine the amount of scraping required for the bridge repair that won’t cause damage to crucial areas.\n\n“The highest point in the wavelengths determines how close under the surface the rod is. Therefore, with this you can calculate the maximum clear cover which tells you how deep you can scrape without touching the rods” Torres said.\n\nBridges aren’t the only infrastructures Torres has been inspecting. He also got the chance to collect data at a structurally deficient parking garage. Using ZipLevel, a tool that measures elevation with pressure through gravity, the multilevel garage was a great opportunity for him to see other structures in need of repair and devices civil engineers utilize in the field. Torres noticed that engineers could get creative with tools, seeing firsthand how experienced engineers would use devices for different purposes.\n\n“I noticed how the engineers were analyzing ways to gather data in the field. When discussing how to approach certain repairs, one of them would come up with the idea to use a tool or device that no one else would’ve thought of using for that specific task. Sometimes you can adapt a device you used previously to something else and make it work perfectly for what you need.”\n\nDespite hours spent in the tropical heat, Torres is excited to be working on location. The opportunity to collect data and gain practical experience is invaluable to him – he’d much rather do this than input information in an air-conditioned office. He also had the chance to view a construction plan for the bridge, which provided him with more exposure to the intricacies of civil engineering – an experience he would’ve never had if he weren’t on site.\n\n“I saw a detailed plan of how the bridge was going to be built, including the materials and all the other details. It was interesting because each project has a plan like this. It’s what everyone follows when the project begins,” Torres said. “Seeing one firsthand was fascinating. When I become an engineer and start my own projects, I’ll also have to follow a plan like that. It was an amazing experience. Being able to read one so early on is a blessing.”\n\nTorres enjoyed applying lessons learned from his Engineering and Computer Science courses, like ECS 101, to his current work. Understanding bridge tensions, compressions, and force dynamics helped him make connections between his work experience and classroom education. Additionally, his familiarity with AutoCAD, a software program used by architects and engineers to create model structures, proved useful during the bridge repair process.\n\nWhen the service group isn’t collecting data or repairing damaged areas, Torres chats with the other engineers about their experiences, which provides him with an opportunity to explore different career paths within civil engineering. With the vast array of options available in this field, he’s narrowed his focus to structural and construction engineering as possible career choices after graduation.\n\n“I think it’s good to have a sense of what you would be working on after you graduate,” Torres said. “It’s motivated me to study harder in school. I’m grateful for what I’ve learned at ECS and this experience.”\n\nTorres also encouraged students to participate in various activities to make the most of their time at ECS. He emphasized the importance of pursuing one’s interests and being a part of the community. Not only has his experience allowed him to gain more exposure in civil engineering but it’s also allowed him to build a future for himself.\n\nEngineering Meets Entrepreneurship at Invent@SU 2023\n\nSix weeks. Eight teams. Three winners.\n\nAfter weeks of preparation, the Invent@SU project presentations finally took place. Faculty, staff, alumni, and sponsors gathered at the Life Sciences Complex, packing into Breed Lecture Hall to witness eight teams present their creations and showcase their entrepreneurial flair.\n\nFor six weeks, 20 Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) students spent their summer days in Link Hall designing and prototyping inventions to pitch to sponsors and compete for cash prizes. Room 369 served as a collaborative space and innovative hub where students brainstormed and perfected their pitches with help from ECS faculty. Battling for first, second, and third place, the competition this year was close.\n\nAmong the roster of Invent@SU competitors were EasyUP, a lightweight collapsible staircase to help senior citizens get back on their feet after a fall, MAJK Pain Relief, a device that provides relief for people with lower back pain, HomeTailor, a handy tool for quick and easy clothing repairs, Collapsa Crutch, an alternative to non-collapsible crutches, The Boxer, a device designed to turn excess cardboard boxes into pulp, GluTrace, a cup that measures sugar content for people with diabetes, SproutSwim, a life vest for infants, and Rising Cane, a way to assist people as they stand up from a seated position.\n\nWith just five minutes to impress the judges, students strived to leave a lasting impression, which many highlighted was just as crucial as the invention itself.\n\n“One of the biggest things I learned from this program was that engineers often only think about the engineering aspect of things. But we also must learn how the business side of things works too,” Saimun Uddin of Collapsa Crutch said. “We talked to patent lawyers and project managers… We also learned how to brand ourselves, and how to make sure you stick out when talking to sponsors.”\n\nUddin’s words about standing out in the competition proved to be true. With her teammates, Sophia Ameneyro and Seydou Diao, the trio would take home third place, winning a cash prize of $600. Their presentation demonstrated their ingenious invention’s functionality by keeping the collapsible crutch hidden in a backpack, revealing it at the end of their pitch to audience applause.\n\n“The reason I chose engineering and ECS was to get hands-on involvement,” Uddin continued. “Sometimes in undergrad, you don’t always get much practical experience. But in this program, you’re able to apply what you learn. When we were designing and prototyping for Invent@SU, we realized how much we applied the things we learned in class. It was very enriching.”\n\nIn second place winning a $1,200 cash prize was The Boxer, the cardboard pulping device. Team members Gabriel Fatade, Adedeji Oyefeso, and Ethan Yankey exuded natural charm and camaraderie, capturing the audience’s interest with their engaging presentation.\n\n“We started with a small idea and now we see the fruit of our labor,” Fatade said. “It’s amazing that people are willing to look at our invention and give it a chance. It’s honestly heart-touching. If you told me six weeks ago, we were going to create a machine for cardboard, I wouldn’t believe it.”\n\nThough Fatade was initially anxious about being a computer engineering student while his team’s invention required mechanical engineering knowledge, he learned a lot by relying on his teammates and learned some things about mechanical engineering too.\n\n“We had our ups and downs,” Fatade added. “There were a lot of mechanical things…But it gave me insight into what it’s like being on a team and taught me how to become a better team member as a whole.”\n\nTaking home a cash prize of $2,000 and winning the championship title of Invent@SU 2023 was Rising Cane. With a captivating pitch, their suits and matching pink ties displayed their teamwork and collaboration, which team member Hunter McElhinney believed contributed to their success.\n\n“We’re all one team. If everyone’s not on the same wavelength, things will go downhill quickly,” McElhinney said. “I think teamwork and consistency have gotten us through this competition. Everybody can be motivated at one point but who can stay consistent…That’s what it came down to. Getting hands-on experience, having a plan, and attacking it from all angles – when the puzzle pieces fall together, it’s a satisfying thing.”\n\nFor McElhinney and his teammates Nathaniel Paradis, Jack Sipperly, and Zach Starr, this isn’t the end. The victors plan on entering Rising Cane in other competitions at Syracuse University. Other Invent@SU teams also plan to work with Blackstone Launchpad in Bird Library to explore business plans and patents.\n\n“This year, our teams all came up with truly creative inventions,” mechanical and engineering professor Alexander Deyhim said. “The technical depth and the use of engineering calculations that went into the development of each project was highly impressive.”\n\n“I genuinely enjoyed getting up every day and coming to this program,” McElhinney added. “Even in the summertime, the last thing you want to do is work. But this really didn’t feel like work at all.”\n\nInvent@SU is made possible by our sponsors. We’d like to thank Syracuse University Trustee Bill Allyn G’59 and Janet “Penny” Jones Allyn ’60 and Michael Lazar G’65 for their program sponsorship. We’d also like to thank the 2023 partner sponsor, the Lyons Family Foundation, and the 2023 team sponsor, Ralph Folz ’90. Their generosity makes it possible for us to provide a truly transformational experience for student inventors at SU.\n\nFor more information on the program, visit invent.syr.edu.\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Professor Charles Driscoll Selected for the 2023 Clarke Prize in Water Science\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Professor Charles Driscoll has been selected to receive the 2023 Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Water Science and Technology from the National Water Research Institute. Driscoll is the University and Distinguished Professor of Environmental Systems Engineering in College of Engineering and Computer Science.\n\nThe Clarke Prize is considered one of the most prestigious awards pertaining to water science. It is awarded to thought leaders in water research, science, technology, or policy in the United States. Past honorees have included some of the most significant figures in civil and environmental engineering; the water, biological, physical, chemical, health, and political sciences; and public planning and policy.\n\nDriscoll’s research largely involves characterization and quantifying the impacts of air pollution, such as acid rain and mercury, changing climate, and land and water disturbances on the structure and function of ecosystems, and pathways of ecosystem recovery. Much of his work has focused on forests and associated aquatic resources, including long-term studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH and the Huntington Forest in the Adirondacks, NY. Recent work has included strategies for the decarbonization of sectors and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOver the past 40 years, Driscoll has advanced new analytical techniques, established and maintained long-term measurements and experiments, and developed a series of research and predictive models that simulate transformations of major chemical elements in forest vegetation, soil and surface waters in response to air pollution, climate and land disturbance. Beyond theory, he is interested in testing ‘in situ’ strategies to reverse the damaging effects of acid rain and mercury contamination, eutrophication, urbanization, and climate change. Driscoll has testified at US Congressional and state legislative committee hearings, and provided briefings to government agencies, industry and stakeholder groups on environmental issues. He has served on local, national and international committees pertaining to environmental management and policy.\n\nDriscoll will receive the award and give a lecture in Irvine, California, on October 21, 2023.

He was living just outside central London, had traveled to multiple other countries in Europe and getting an up-close look at how global companies operate.\n\n“We have a global major since we are creating software and technologies that spread around the world but we often don’t have knowledge of all the context that our work is going to be part of. So this is a valuable experience,” says Mosca.\n\nA program uniquely designed for Syracuse University computer science students allows them to take courses they need in London and stay on track for a four year graduation. Kwaku Amofah-Boafo ’24 was thrilled to be taking his required classes mixed in with experiences across the United Kingdom.\n\n“The best part of Study Abroad is interacting with the city,” says Amofah-Boafo. “Seeing that my major is computer science, visiting these places has given me the opportunity to see if I want to work abroad or work oversees in the future.”\n\nSyracuse University’s London Center is based out of Faraday House in the West End. Students can take classes there and receive support from Syracuse University faculty and staff.\n\n“I feel like Faraday House is your own little home space in London,” says Mosca. “Having the diverse faculty is cool. They are people of all different backgrounds who are either working in industry or teaching.”\n\n“The classes are smaller, you interact more and I think that leads to better experiences in the classroom and the work you do,” says Amofah-Boafo.\n\nThe Syracuse Abroad computer science program is London is designed for the fall semester of a student’s junior year.\n\n“Getting a chance to see what it is like to live here on a day to day basis and see people working has made me think about it in the future,” says Amofah-Boafo.\n\n“It is an opportunity that will change your life, how you look at the world and it is invaluable,” said Mosca.\n\nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering Student Theodore Todorov Joins Young Research Fellowship\n\nFirst-year aerospace engineering student, Theodore Todorov, has been selected as a CFSA-SOURCE Young Research Fellow at Syracuse University. For the next two years, he’ll work with assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science, Pankaj K. Jha, and his team in the Quantum Technology Laboratory on classical and quantum optics projects.\n\nQuantum optics involves studying the nature of light and how it interacts with matter. For decades, researchers have used quantum optics to better understand quantum mechanics, the study of how atomic particles interact with each other. This research has led to numerous technological developments that have now become known as the quantum revolution, or Quantum 2.0, and with his team, Professor Jha has continued conducting research on quantum technology in his lab.\n\nOffered by Syracuse University’s Center for Fellowship and Scholarship and the Syracuse Office of Undergraduate Research and Creative Engagement, the Young Research Fellows Program supports students passionate about research. With guidance from their faculty mentors, this fellowship gives students practical experience in early research and creative inquiry development.\n\nSome of Jha’s research focuses on novel materials that can be thinned down to a single layer of atoms and used to build extremely sensitive photodetectors that can detect light at the level of single photons. In the fellowship, Todorov’s projects will involve studying and characterizing these photodetectors and photon counting for space applications, including quantum communications, imaging distant objects, and extending the range of clear air turbulences.\n\nTodorov first discovered his passion for writing abstracts, collecting data, and drawing conclusions through a research course he took in high school. His fascination with telescopes, quantum optics and space exploration also piqued his interest in aerospace engineering, and following his arrival at Syracuse University, he desired to connect with other students and faculty who had similar interests – this made the fellowship program at Syracuse University more than ideal for him.\n\n“I’m happy to be a part of the Young Research Fellows Program and the community that this program wants to foster,” Todorov said.\n\n“Quantum optics and photonics for space applications is exciting research, and we are delighted to have Theodore join our team,” Jha added.\n\nThe fellowship hasn’t stopped Todorov from pursuing other projects this summer. He’s currently working with Syracuse University’s Center of Excellence in Environmental Energy Systems on research, creating sensor boxes so the team can position them around campus and measure air quality.\n\nIn the upcoming fall, he also plans to study the principles of classical and quantum optics and get trained in the Quantum Technology Laboratory in various experimental techniques and equipment, including lasers, single-photon detectors, and counters. He’ll focus on understanding and conducting classical and quantum interference experiments at the single photon level, analyzing the data, and writing a research paper by the end of the semester to present his work at a conference the following spring.\n\nProfessor Wanliang Shan Receives NSF CAREER Award for Research on Tunable Adhesion\n\nWanliang Shan, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (ECS), has received a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award to research the mechanics behind highly tunable dry adhesion for manipulating delicate and small objects.\n\nThe NSF CAREER Award supports early-career faculty with promising research and the potential to serve as academic role models. This project will significantly advance tunable adhesion for compliant manipulation, which Shan’s team has studied for the past seven years. Focused on the ability to pick up and release objects by adjusting the level of adhesion, his work has been published in high-impact journals such as Advanced Functional Materials and Advanced Materials Interfaces.\n\nShan’s team previously explored adhesion tuning using smart materials in soft pillars. Heating the smart material component with an electrical current, or power source, activates the device within seconds, resulting in a significant change in the adhesion of the soft pillars. This discovery earned Shan a patent which was issued in the Spring of 2022 and his team is currently working on an NSF Partnership for Innovation grant to explore the potential commercialization of this approach.\n\nShan’s NSF CAREER project introduces a new method for achieving tunable adhesion. Rather than using heat to activate the device, this method uses low pressure to activate adhesion which allows objects to be gripped and released efficiently at a faster rate. Shan found that a greater amount of adhesion change can be achieved within a fraction of a second compared to his previous method. This innovative approach focuses on a specific type of adhesive structure called soft hollow pillars and a provisional patent has been filed for this new approach.\n\nThe CAREER project delves deeper into understanding the mechanics behind highly tunable adhesion observed in soft hollow pillars and investigates the role of mechanical instability, specifically the buckling of thin structures under low pressure, which will give Shan insights into optimizing the design of adhesive devices. By understanding the influence of these factors, the project seeks to further improve the functionality and effectiveness of adhesive devices.\n\n“In certain applications like manufacturing, devices need fast, repetitive movements to perform tasks,” Shan says. “In other applications, however, these devices don’t require the same movements. This is why I believe both approaches to tunable adhesion are important.”\n\nShan will continue incorporating findings from research into the courses he teaches at Syracuse University. Since 2019, he’s been a faculty member of ECS, where he teaches courses on solid mechanics and soft robotics. He also intends to seek internship opportunities at relevant companies for graduate students who participate in the CAREER project, a strategy he’s used to interact with industrial partners leveraging existing NSF grants. Collaborating with the Museum of Science and Technology in downtown Syracuse, he’s also proposed education and outreach initiatives such as mechanics-enabled soft robotics summer camps. These are intended to educate the general public, especially K-12 students, about his team’s research.\n\n“There’s a significant educational aspect to this CAREER award,” Shan says. “This will be great for students and my lab at Syracuse University. I look forward to incorporating findings from this research into lecture material, both for undergrad and graduate students. The summer camps will help disseminate research outcomes to the general public and foster interest in the next generation of engineers.”\n\n“This project not only has all the fundamentals of mechanics but also carries practical ramifications for compliant manipulation,” Shan added. “Bringing this research to my classroom and the potential impact these findings will have on technology is all very exciting. I appreciate the National Science Foundation for this award for allowing me the opportunity to carry out this exciting project.”\n\nElectrical Engineering and Computer Science Professor Yuzhe Tang Receives Grant to Protect Ethereum Security\n\nYuzhe Tang, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the College of Engineering and Computer Science, and his research team have been awarded a grant by the Ethereum Foundation for research to advance the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. This grant will support Tang and his Ph.D. students in designing, developing, and evaluating the security hardening code to protect the Ethereum network stack.\n\nEthereum is a network made up of several communities and toolsets that allow users to communicate or make transactions with digital money. Since the network is decentralized, users are in complete control of their data and what’s being shared, so they don’t need to give up any personal information – all users need to access Ethereum is an internet connection.\n\nDenial of service security is critically important to the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, and the research will explore ways to protect the Ethereum network from cyberattacks, involving systematic vulnerability discovery using applied formal methods. As cyber criminals attack networks like Ethereum and security concerns grow, Tang believes this research could have a lasting impact on the current landscape of cybersecurity and blockchain platforms.\n\n“With this grant, we can help solve some of the most critical problems in the real world. We expect to continue developing code merged into Ethereum codebase,” Tang says. “I am most excited about making real-world impacts out of the research works from my group.”\n\nSpring 2023 Engineering

Jonathan Preston, associate professor of communication sciences and disorders, is principal investigator. Preston is the inventor of Speech Motor Chaining, a treatment approach for individuals with speech sound disorders. Co-principal investigators are Asif Salekin, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science, whose expertise is creating interpretable and fair human-centric artificial intelligence-based systems, and Nina Benway, a recent graduate of the communication sciences and disorders/speech-language pathology doctoral program.\n\nTheir system uses the evidence-based Speech Motor Chaining software, an extensive library of speech sounds and artificial intelligence to “think” and “hear” the way a speech-language clinician does.\n\nThe project focuses on the most effective scheduling of Speech Motor Chaining sessions for children with speech sound disorders and also examines whether artificial intelligence can enhance Speech Motor Chaining—a topic Benway explored in her dissertation. The work is a collaboration between Salekin’s Laboratory for Ubiquitous and Intelligent Sensing in the College of Engineering and Computer Science and Preston’s Speech Production Lab in the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nClinical Need\n\nIn speech therapy, learners usually meet with a clinician one-on-one to practice speech sounds and receive feedback. If the artificial intelligence version of Speech Motor Chaining (“ChainingAI”) accurately replicates a clinician’s judgment, it could help learners get high-quality practice on their own between clinician sessions. That could help them achieve the intensity of practice that best helps overcome a speech disorder.\n\nThe software is meant to supplement, not replace, the work of speech clinicians. “We know that speech therapy works, but there’s a larger issue about whether learners are getting the intensity of services that best supports speech learning,” Benway says. “This project looks at whether AI-assisted speech therapy can increase the intensity of services through at-home practice between sessions with a human clinician. The speech clinician is still in charge, providing oversight, critical assessment and training the software on which sounds to say are correct or not; the software is simply a tool in the overall arc of clinician-led treatment.”\n\n170,000 Sounds\n\nA library of 170,000 correctly and incorrectly pronounced “r” sounds was used to train the system. The recorded sounds were made by 400-plus children over 10 years, collected by researchers at Syracuse, Montclair and New York Universities, and filed at the Speech Production Lab.\n\nBenway wrote ChainingAI’s patent-pending speech analysis and machine learning operating code, which converts audio from speech sounds into recognizable numeric patterns. The system was taught to predict which patterns represent “correct” or “incorrect” speech. Predictions can be customized to individuals’ speech patterns.\n\nDuring speech practice, the code works in real time with Preston’s Speech Motor Chaining website to sense, sort and interpret patterns in speech audio to “hear” whether a sound is made correctly. The software provides audio feedback (announcing “correct” or “not quite”), offers tongue-position reminders and tongue-shape animations to reinforce proper pronunciation, then selects the next practice word based on whether or not the child is ready to increase word difficulty.\n\nEarly Promise\n\nThe system shows greater potential than prior systems that have been developed to detect speech sound errors, according to the researchers.\n\nUntil now, Preston says, automated systems have not been accurate enough to provide much clinical value. This study overcomes issues that hindered previous efforts: Its example residual speech sound disorder audio dataset is larger; it more accurately recognizes incorrect sounds; and clinical trials are assessing therapeutic benefit.\n\n“There has not been a clinical therapy system that has explicitly used AI machine learning to recognize correct and distorted “r” sounds for learners with residual speech sound disorders,” Preston says. “The data collected so far shows this system is performing well in relation to what a human clinician would say in the same circumstances and that learners are improving speech sounds after using ChainingAI.”\n\nSo Far, Just ‘R’\n\nThe experiment is currently focused on the “r” sound, the most common speech error persisting into adolescence and adulthood, and only on American English. Eventually, the researchers hope to expand software functionality to “s” and “z” sounds, different English dialects and other languages.\n\nEthical AI\n\nThe researchers have considered ethical aspects of AI throughout the initiative. “We’ve made sure that ethical oversight was built into this system to assure fairness in the assessments the software makes,” Salekin says. “In its learning process, the model has been taught to adjust for age and sex of clients to make sure it performs fairly regardless of those factors.” Future refinements will adjust for race and ethnicity.\n\nThe team is also assessing appropriate candidates for the therapy and whether different scheduling of therapy visits (such as a boot camp experience) might help learners progress more quickly than longer-term intermittent sessions.\n\nUltimately, the researchers hope the software provides sound-practice sessions that are effective, accessible and of sufficient intensity to allow ChainingAI to routinely supplement in-person clinician practice time. Once expanded to include “s” and “z” sounds, the system would address 90% of residual speech sound disorders and could benefit many thousands of the estimated six million Americans who are impacted by these disorders.\n\nWritten by Diane Stirling\n\nElectrical Engineering and Computer Science Professor Senem Velipasalar Awarded Patent for Room Occupancy Detection Platform\n\nRemembering to turn the lights off when leaving a room is easy, but letting the furnace that you’re headed out isn’t as simple. About 37% of all energy used by commercial buildings and 40% of energy used in residences go toward heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). The costs related to heating and cooling unoccupied spaces in homes and office buildings have been a challenge for decades.\n\nCurrent occupancy sensors only detect movement, so they can’t tell if someone is stationary. They also have trouble distinguishing between people and large pets, and often require an external power source and data processing. When a room is occupied, not being able to detect occupancy can cause user discomfort. On the other hand, not reliably knowing when a room is empty adds up to massive amounts of unnecessary heating and cooling costs for spaces without any people in them.\n\nA collaboration between Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Professors Senem Velipasalar and Pramod Varshney, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Professor Ed Bogucz, Professor Tarek Rakha from Georgia Tech and SRI International, a nonprofit research institute, has developed a new sensor platform, MicroCam, which addresses many of the limitations that current systems face. Their project received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) and had to meet certain requirements. The platform had to be highly accurate, low-maintenance, affordable and easily self-commissioned for consumers while still providing more than 30% energy savings.\n\n“It was important to us and ARPA-E that this platform be highly reliable, practical and inexpensive,” says Velipasalar. “This needed to be useful in real-world spaces, and it was designed to be battery-powered.”\n\nThe MicroCam is equipped with multi-modal sensors that can process motion, audio and video data. The camera can operate under daylight, low light or even no light conditions and it can be powered for more than a year on just three AA batteries – all the sensor processing is done inside one small unit.\n\n“We do not use cloud computing, everything is captured and processed on this platform,” says Velipasalar. “You are not transferring or saving data, so it alleviates privacy concerns.”\n\nWhile the MicroCam can detect occupancy, it does not share potentially private information.\n\n“It senses your presence but only sends a 0 or 1 signal to the HVAC system,” says Velipasalar. “That binary occupancy result is the only data shared with the lead platform.”\n\nIndustrial and Interactive Design Professor Don Carr and his students worked with Velipasalar and Bogucz to design a prototype case for the MicroCam.\n\n“Eventually we want a peel and stick and ideally you want to install one per room,” says Velipasalar. “If you have one of these in each room, you could monitor the entire space.”\n\nVelipasalar was granted a patent in March 2023 titled “Low Power and Privacy Preserving Sensor Platform for Occupancy Detection.” It is the sixth patent she has been awarded over her career.\n\n“This was a challenging project. We had to meet low cost and high accuracy requirements but it has incredible potential,” says Velipasalar.\n\nThe platform may have additional uses in the future including smart home integration and security monitoring. Velipasalar also sees possibilities for the MicroCam to provide activity monitoring and fall detection for families and nursing homes.\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Professor Sam Clemence to Receive Deep Foundations Institute Legends Award\n\nThe Deep Foundations Institute (DFI) and the DFI Educational Trust Legends Committee has chosen Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Sam Clemence as a recipient of one of the DFI Legends Awards for 2023.

These industry-sponsored projects are designed to support the development of teamwork, critical thinking, problem solving abilities, communication skills and other key areas of expertise that prepare students for their careers. The industry partnerships provide students with valuable real world experience and networking opportunities, and the sponsoring companies receive innovative solutions to problems and the opportunity to recruit elite, young talent.\n\nThe course is co-instructed by Kenneth and Mary Ann Shaw Professor of Practice in Entrepreneurial Leadership Alexander Deyhim, and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Professors Mehmet Sarimurat and Ed Bogucz. Professor Deyhim describes the course as an immersive experience that pushes students to achieve excellence.\n\n“The progress of each project is meticulously monitored through a gated review process. This process entails regular feedback and evaluation from multiple stakeholders, including the client, faculty members, fellow students, and a review panel,” says Professor Deyhim. “By engaging in this iterative review system, students receive valuable insights and recommendations at various stages of their project, facilitating continuous improvement and aligning their efforts with the client’s expectations. This year, seven teams completed capstone projects; the final presentations were excellent, and every single team impressed our esteemed panel of industry judges.”\n\nHere are the 2022-2023 mechanical engineering senior design capstone projects:\n\nAdditively Manufactured Cold Plate\n\nSponsor: Lockheed Martin\n\nWorking with Lockheed Martin, the team designed, tested and determined the best way to produce an additively manufactured (3D printed) cold plate to be used in various applications for the company’s numerous radar electronics. This is a critical design because Lockheed Martin’s products can reach temperatures up to KW/cm2. The team evaluated multiple designs with complex geometric flow paths and determined appropriate material for manufacturing the cold plate while considering cost and functionality.\n\nAutomated Inspection of Jet Engine Components\n\nSponsor: GE Aviation\n\nThe team advanced the development of a solution allowing the inspection of turbine discs using cameras and artificial intelligence to determine if there are any small cracks or defects that could damage the engine. The goal of this project was to design a system to remove human error and increase efficiency of the inspection process. The team assisted GE in developing an automated white light digital system for the part inspection with a focus on pass-through features.\n\nDairy Cover and Conveyor Belt Cleaners Redesign\n\nSponsor: Berry Global\n\nThe team was tasked with helping Berry Global, an international plastic packaging company, to increase the efficiency of their injection molding process. The team provided a design and prototype for a portable way to clean the cover from the ground without needing to stop production. The proposed design is an automated device that sits on the framework of the dairy covers and will sweep debris and particles into dustbins located on the two sides on the dairy cover.\n\nCompact High Efficiency Air Handling Unit\n\nSponsor: Upstate Parts & Supply Inc.\n\nCentrifugal fans have been at the forefront of cleanroom technology and have been the industry standard for a long time. Mechanical and Aerospace Professor Mehmet Sarimurat and Former Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Professor Thong Dang designed a new axial fan to be utilized in a microchip manufacturing plant (Class 1000) which uses less energy. The team’s role was to first design an FFU (fan filter unit) that can house the fan while being compatible with a high efficiency particle arresting (HEPA) filter. Once the designed FFU and fixture system were in place, the team conducted performance testing of the fan with attention being paid to how the designed system works with the fan and if the performance is superior to a traditional centrifugal one.\n\nOccupancy Based Smart Vent\n\nSponsor: WellBuilding Control\n\nWellBuilding Control is a company started by Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Professor Dr. Bing Dong, whose research focuses on heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The team was brought in to focus on developing an occupancy control HVAC system that will reduce energy consumption in heating and cooling buildings. This system will reduce carbon emissions and save money for consumers. The team concluded that an automated air register vent would be the most effective method of achieving the goal. The team then created a design and prototype of a control vent that will open and close automatically when a room becomes occupied or unoccupied to control the air flow to that room. The vent will also control indoor air quality using a CO2 sensor that will turn on a fan that will blow air and reduce the CO2 levels.\n\nDesiccant Hopper Redesign\n\nSponsor: Cryomech\n\nThe team was brought in to help Cryomech, a manufacturer of cryogenic cooling applications that use helium gas as the working fluid in a helium compressor, to design an improved hopper system. Helium compressor packages made by Cryomech use desiccant adsorbers to “clean” helium as it is cooled to temperatures as low as 4K. Currently, the molecular sieve and granular activated charcoal used in the adsorbers is being contaminated from atmospheric exposure. The team designed and created a prototype of a hopper system that will keep the desiccants clean and reduce production time.\n\nIntegrated Sustainable Building Design Competition\n\nSponsor: ASHRAE\n\nThe team entered the 2023 Integrated Sustainable Building Design Competition, specifically the HVAC Design Calculations competition. The project’s objective was to fully design an HVAC system for a laboratory facility located in Cairo, Egypt. The team submitted a 35-page technical report including all the work and calculations, along with analysis explaining the logic. For this competition, the team was required to adhere to the most up to date American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standards. Representatives from Carrier Corporation also mentored the team, assisting them with the ins and outs of learning their Hourly Analysis Program (HAP) software to get the load calculations.\n\nBiomedical and Chemical Engineering Student Spotlight: Anna-Blessing Merife\n\nHometown:\n\nAlexandria, VA\n\nActivities you have been involved with:\n\nOther than research and class work.

Cole Smith talks with FedEx President and CEO Raj Subramaniam G’89 About Leadership and Advice for Current Students\n\nRaj Subramaniam G’89 is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Corporation. He has more than 30 years of industry experience at FedEx and is responsible for several recent transformational initiatives, including revitalizing the company’s operating strategy, profitably growing the e-commerce business, and harnessing the power of global supply chain data to drive the company’s digital transformation. In a conversation with Dean J. Cole Smith, he looked back at how his time at Syracuse University as a chemical engineering graduate student helped prepare him to lead FedEx and areas where future Syracuse University graduates can make an impact.\n\nDean Smith: What are some of your favorite memories from your time at Syracuse University?\n\nRaj Subramaniam: Syracuse was my first point of entry in the United States. It holds a very special place because of that. I made so many friends in Syracuse and really got myself into the American culture. Starting with the first football game that I went to. I didn’t know what football was but I remember we had a game against Penn State and we beat them. We had a great unbeaten season the year I was there.\n\nWe formed a Syracuse cricket club and I was a captain. Syracuse University supported me and we hosted a ten team tournament in the last year I was there. My great memories of Syracuse were the friendships and the people I met and getting my first view of American culture.\n\nDean Smith: How did how your engineering education at Syracuse help prepare you for leadership roles?\n\nRaj Subramaniam: One of the core aspects of engineering is the real discipline and rigor that goes with it. Engineering is about problem solving at the end of the day. You are taking structured and unstructured problems, looking at all the data and information that is available to you and then crafting a solution to solve that problem. You have to pay attention to the details. It is a disciplined approach: It is analytical in nature, and at the end of the day when you think about the strategic decisions that you are making in a company, the mental process that you go through to arrive at a particular decision point is similar. Especially in this day and age where there is so much dynamism in the world and so much information you have to process, you have to stay disciplined. The rigor with which you apply that that discipline is very important. I think my engineering background and the core skillsets I developed through six years of engineering has stayed with me.\n\nDean Smith: When I think of FedEx I think about a commitment to logistics, sustainability and reliability. How have you seen the need for engineering and computing skills change over the years and where should a student’s focus be if they want to make an impact?\n\nRaj Subramaniam: Building a network and especially a physical network is a very hard thing to do. What FedEx has done over the past 50 years is diligently build networks connecting 220 countries around the world. The core idea of a network is that you can pick up one thing in any part of the world and get it to any other part of the world in a few days. That’s the network. For example, COVID-19 vaccine delivery – we were interested in the responsibility. We were one of only two networks that could actually deliver it. Within the United States you had to do it within 24 hours to keep the temperature stable. We have built a physical network over fifty years that is unmatched.\n\nAssociated with that is the digital network that underpins the physical network. Every day we transport millions of packages around the world and each of these packages is scanned multiple times. In other words, we have important insights on the global supply chain on a daily basis. Moving forward, as we innovate digitally, how do we empower the data on the insights that we have to create value for our customers? Supply chains are a big topic of conversations these days. As students at Syracuse look into this area, this is a very important piece of the puzzle. I think intelligent supply chains are going to be very important for success. Making customer supply chains smarter through technology is a really important thing. Providing visibility across supply chains to more efficiently manage that and to provide a sense of reliability and predictability using intelligence and data – this is an area where engineers and engineering students can play a massive role.\n\nDean Smith: There are some folks that are trying to use summary data to make inferences on reality and really the complexity of the situation is always more complicated than what a couple of pieces of data are going to give you. It’s the interactions, the models and understanding what’s really happening on the ground. The rigor of what they understand is very important but you’ve mentioned supply chain here a few times and engineers will think of that as one thing and maybe data scientists will think of it as something different and business majors might think of it as something a little different. I think from what you’re telling me it seems like a well-rounded engineer or computer scientist that’s familiar with the problems, the challenges, the languages and the industrial realities is the one that’s going to make the biggest impact.\n\nRaj Subramaniam: That is a very good point that you mentioned about the complexity. A lot of conversations are starting to say “simplify it for me, simplify it for me, simplify it for me” but the reality is that the world is complex and when you oversimplify, you can lose the essence of the matter. In today’s world, to be able to deal with the complexity and to understand the complexity and don’t form the trap of oversimplification is important. The reason why a lot of engineers are now showing up in the c-suite of several corporations is because of their ability to deal with the complexity and to be able to understand the detail behind some of the issues and actually solve the problems. I think that’s very important. In terms of the different people who look at supply chains whether it’s business or computer science or engineering – this is a very holistic feel right now. The way I’m thinking about supply chain is about making sure our customers’ operations are streamlined, our operations are streamlined and, for the consumer, there’s visibility and predictability of what’s coming to them. This involves all the aspects that we just talked about.\n\nWhether it’s a computer scientist, whether it’s an industrial engineer, whether it’s a business major: The person who can kind of put it all together will be a very valuable resource for any corporation.\n\nDean Smith: And what additional advice should we be giving to a modern engineering or computer science student?\n\nRaj Subramaniam: One of the great things about what I’ve experienced over the last 35 years since I moved to the United States has been constant change. It’s almost as if someone was looking at me and saying “okay he’s getting comfortable, let’s move the comfort zone a little bit now.” It has always been about getting outside of my comfort zone and being comfortable there. I think the ability to adapt to changing circumstances while staying true to your core beliefs is a is a very important skill to have. For me, it is about moving either moving disciplines, moving geography or trying to take on different assignments. It has been a constant for me.\n\nDean Smith: That’s critical advice. I think it’s a healthy thing to be curious. And to be comfortably uncomfortable in the way that you’re referring to allows you to keep inventing yourself.\n\nRaj Subramaniam: I’ve been a one-company person ever since I joined FedEx in 1991. I have stayed there for 31 years but within the company there has been such an element of change. I have taken different roles starting from a more analytical function to as I grew into more management roles and general management roles. It’s been a constant change and so whether you stay in one enterprise or change enterprises or change careers, you know you’ve got to be ready to change while always learning.\n\nCareer Focused: Engineering and Computer Science Class of 2022 Reporting High Placement Rate\n\nThe starting salaries for graduates receiving a Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) has grown steadily for the last six years.\n\nThe average starting salary for the class of 2022 was $76,679.

The College’s convocation will be held in the Lally Athletics Complex at 10:30am on Saturday May 13th.\n\nMurphy is the Founder and CEO of Celersys Technologies, an aerospace technology consultancy delivering technology solutions and services to commercial clients, the Department of Defense and civilian agencies. Prior to Celersys Technologies, Murphy was the President and Chief Executive Officer for Axient LLC, a high-end technology and engineering firm with over 2,000 employees. Prior to that position, Murphy served as Millennium Engineering and Integration’s Chief Executive Officer and led the company through multiple years of substantial growth culminating in a strategic sale of the company in 2021 to help form Axient.\n\nIn 2014, he was awarded the Greater Washington GovCon Award for Executive of the Year for his leadership in industry-leading growth and corporate transformation. Patrick served as the Chief Operating Officer, Vice President for Corporate Operations and Analysis, Vice President for Space Systems, and Director for Engineering at Millennium spanning over 20 years and helping grow that business to 900 employees nationwide. He served as the Chief Engineer for the Missile Defense Agency’s Advanced Technology Program Executive Office portfolio providing technical leadership for all new missile defense technologies and concepts. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Syracuse University and a Master of Business Administration from The George Washington University.\n\n“Graduating from Syracuse University nearly 35 years ago, I never envisioned one day returning to where it all started to give a commencement address. I am honored and humbled by the opportunity to share my views, experiences, and lessons and to celebrate with the College of Engineering and Computer Science class of 2023,” said Murphy. “The technical challenges of today are more complex and demanding than ever before. But the engineers and scientists graduating in the Class of 2023 are well-equipped to take these on and make a significant, positive impact on our world. I am very excited to see what heights they can reach.”\n\nMurphy is a native upstate New Yorker and currently resides in Arlington, VA with his wife Linda and dog, Maisie. He bleeds Orange with two of his children graduating from Syracuse University and currently serves on the College of Engineering and Computer Science Dean’s Leadership Council and the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department’s Advisory Board. He is life-long learner and self proclaimed geek with hobbies in pinball machine restoration, micro-processor programming, electrical device development, golfing and boating.\n\nAdvocating for Effective Environmental Action\n\nThe work of environmental engineers and scientists is governed by regulations. In international negotiations and conventions, governmental representatives make the final decisions, but representatives from non-governmental organizations are sought to inform the process. It is a critical role because input from experts shape the regulations to ensure the best possible outcomes for our environment. Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Svetoslava Todorova has been involved with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) since 2010. The UNEP is responsible for coordinating responses to environmental issues within the United Nations.\n\n“I have been passionate about participating in international efforts to address environmental issues since a young age. It has been an incredible journey to build and direct my professional life around this cause, and I am excited to make the most of this opportunity,” says Todorova.\n\nTodorova started as a science observer during the UNEP intergovernmental negotiations on mercury. Those negotiations led to the development of the Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2013. The purpose of the convention was to draft an international treaty designed to protect humans and the environment from the release of mercury compounds. Todorova made an important contribution to the treaty and continued her involvement.\n\n“One specific contribution was a sentence in the treaty text that considers the co-benefits of treatment technologies,” says Todorova. “Now, I am part of a scientific group that was formed in 2022 to develop the framework for assessing the Convention’s implementation.”\n\nTodorova’s involvement with the UNEP evolved out of the Minamata Convention. From 2017-2019 she served as a communications liaison for the Fate and Transport group under the Global Mercury Partnership, a scientific advisory body on mercury to the UNEP. In June 2022, she became a member of a working group that was tasked with the development of a framework for a future science-policy panel on the management of chemicals and waste. In October 2022, she was elected to a group tasked with developing a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention.\n\n“The group’s mandate is to provide a plan for data analysis and identify any existing gaps in monitoring, which will be presented to the 5th Conference of Parties (COP) of the Convention in October 2023 for discussion and voting,” says Todorova.\n\nThe COP is the governing body of the convention that makes decisions for its implementation and evaluation. Todorova’s involvement in the mercury negotiations has enabled Syracuse University to become an accredited observer institution, allowing students and faculty to participate in the COP.\n\n“The accredited observer status given to Syracuse University provides opportunities to contribute to the work of the UNEP,” says Todorova. “Being an accredited observer under one convention allows us to participate in the negotiation and implementation of other Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), such as the recent negotiations on a new treaty to address global environmental issues on plastics. This ensures that we have a continuous presence and input on the process.”\n\nIn November 2019, Todorova brought a group of 11 students to attend COP3 of the of the Minamata Convention as part of an Honors course on environmental science-policy. At the COPs, students have the opportunity to sit amongst policymakers and get a sense of the complexity of negotiating agreements on environmental issues. This fall another group of students will have a similar opportunity.\n\n“I am teaching The Role of Science in Environmental Governance in the fall of 2023. As part of the class, students and I will travel to Geneva, Switzerland to attend COP5 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury,” says Todorova.\n\nTodorova says Syracuse University and ECS have been very supportive of her involvement with the UNEP. Her work embodies the College of Engineering and Computer Science’s commitment to meaningful interaction with the world and positively impacting the public.\n\n“I started attending the negotiations for the Minamata Convention on Mercury while I was still a doctoral student in the civil and environmental engineering department,” says Todorova. “Over the years, my participation has been supported with the financial support of the Graduate Student Organization, the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, and the Dean’s Office at the College of Engineering and Computer Science.”\n\nLearning Through Research: Hennecys Perez Castro ’25\n\nHennecys Perez Castro is a sophomore environmental engineering major from the Bronx, NY. In her short time at the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS), Hennecys has participated in the Air Force ROTC program, a Marine officer program, she is an active member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and she is doing paid research relevant to her field of study.\n\n“Doing research creates a great baseline to explore what you want to do. Being at an R1 university means there is a lot of funding and that opens up a lot of opportunity,” says Hennecys.\n\nHennecys learned about research opportunities through ECS Laboratory Manager and SHPE advisor Mario Montesdeoca. He helped her get started as a trainee in the environmental engineering labs as a first-year student. It gave her an opportunity to ask questions and learn how to apply for a Research Experience for Undergraduates.\n\nHennecys’ first research project involved measuring CO2 and O2 concentrations from different soil depths to explore soil respiration response and testing new low-cost CO2 sensor technology. During the fall semester of her sophomore year, she presented her research at the Long-Term Ecological Research All Scientists Meeting in California and took second place in a poster competition.\n\nIn addition to her ongoing CO2 censor testing, Hennecys is facilitating a lab project under University Professor of Environmental Sy"
