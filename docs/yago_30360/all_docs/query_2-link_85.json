        "text": "Mike O’Gorman plays elite Omega Sector agent Luther on True Lies.\n\nMike O’Gorman joined Tracey on the So Many Shows podcast to talk about playing Luther on True Lies.\n\nLuther brings both humor and a super spy skillset to Omega Sector. Mike has roots in comedy and gels so well with the rest of the comedic cast. Mike works alongside Steve Howey and Ginger Gonzaga who play Harry and Helen Tasker. He is also joined by Erica Hernandez who plays fellow agent, Maria, and funny man Omar Miller as Gib who guides the team from the surveillance van.\n\nThe spy action on True Lies is absolutely entertaining, but stories about family also make up a large part of the show. Mike talks about the show’s portrayal of family at work and family at home, and how the two entities navigate their roles.\n\nWe also had some time to talk about Mike’s role on the current season of Ted Lasso, which interestingly drops on Wednesdays like True Lies. His role on Ted Lasso is not as well-liked as Luther and viewers will understand why.\n\nMike shared so many great stories about his castmates who have also collectively become very good friends off-screen. There is such wonderful chemistry among the characters, and I hope to see the series continue on with a renewal. Thanks so much to Mike for joining me on the podcast for a great conversation!\n\nWatch True Lies on CBS on Wednesdays at 10/9c or stream on Paramount+.\n\nListen to the podcast episode by pressing the play icon at the top of the post or listen via Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, or other podcast provider by subscribing to the So Many Shows podcast feed.\n\nThank you so much for tuning in and please follow our continuing coverage at SoManyShows.com\n\nICYMI: Interview with True Lies showrunner Matt Nix\n\nMusic courtesy of subscription to zapsplat.com\n\nStay connected with So Many Shows:\n\nLike us on Facebook!\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nSubscribe on YouTube"
