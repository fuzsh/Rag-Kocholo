        "meta_description": "SNEAK PEEK â€“ WEEK OF NOVEMBER 2\r\n\r\nðŸ“· \r\nWhen Adam finally remembers the night he shot Stuart, he cracks -- understandably! -- and pulls a gun on Erica and Zach. After insisting he be left alone, he flees to his brother's grave, leaving Erica and Zach stunned ... and still convinced Annie's the culprit (boy, they really don't get it, do they?). \n\nMeanwhile, Annie finally gets out of the elevator (where she was trapped -- and shared another smooch -- with soon-to-be nephew Scott) and finds Adam at the cemetery. It's definitely a grave situation (!) because Adam, unable to deal with killing his brother, now has the gun to his own head. Annie manages to talk him down, but that's just the beginning of her problems; how to keep him from confessing? Annie, ever the manipulative witch, comes up with just the right move to keep Adam from coming clean -- for now. After all, a jailed Adam can't help her get custody of Emma (or be her meal ticket). \n\nOh, did we mention that during all the above action, Adam and Annie prepare to get MARRIED!?! And, of course, something goes horribly, terribly wrong - Adam collapses! \nðŸ“· \r\n\r\nJR wants to have a baby with Marissa, but the new Mrs. Chandler is worried that JR wants another child for all the wrong reasons -- and isn't ready for the pitter patter of little feet just yet. Marissa's concern might be justified, because JR gets some bad news this week and immediately thinks about turning to the bottle. Yikes! Fingers crossed he's actually sober for the good news he's going to get. \nðŸ“· When Adam's tainted pills are brought to the hospital to be analyzed (thanks to Annie), Angie suspects David's been up to something and secretly tests the pills herself. She confronts David about the results, and he admits to switching the pill bottles. Something must be in the water at the Hubbard household, because Angie takes a page out of Jesse's book and ... well, we'd like you to see what she does and tell us if you think she's flat-out nuts or the shrewdest lady in Pine Valley (next to Erica, of course). \n\nðŸ“· \n\nA jealous Aidan tries to get between Zach and Kendall this week when he starts intercepting and sending fake messages to Zach while Kendall snoozes.  Unfortunately, his plan not only manages to create confusion between the two, but it also tips the Feds off to Kendall and Aidan's location (nice going, Aidan).  Will they be able to find another hideout ... or does someone need to get Kendall's prison jumpsuit ironed and ready? \n\nAll this, PLUS: David accuses Amanda and Jake of breaking their agreement; Liza warns Bailey about Damon; former One Life to Live star BethAnn Bonner debuts on the show; and someone else figures out the truth about Adam. Uh-oh. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n  Yeah, there's a reason why SandiÂ calls him Special Oops, and I call him Aidiot  ðŸ“·",
