However, Stuart was deliberately played to be Adam's exact opposite in personality: while Adam is ruthless, unethical, and domineering, Stuart was kind, generous, and honest. This was also reflected in their physical appearances: Adam always wears a business suit and keeps his hair slick and neat, while Stuart wore colorful cardigans with slacks and had rumbled hair. Stuart often served as his brother's conscience, attempting to sway Adam from some of his more heartless schemes.\n\nm. Joanna Yaegar\n\nm. Cindy Parker\n\nm. Marian Colby\n\nc. Scott Chandler\n\nScott is Cindy Parker's son with Fred Parker, adopted by Stuart. He is the nephew of Adam.\n\nScott is the son of Fred Parker and his wife Cindy (Ellen Wheeler). Fred was an intravenous drug user; and, through the sharing of needles, he contracted the HIV virus, which resulted in his death from AIDS. In 1988, Cindy is befriended by Jesse and Angie Hubbard, who take her and Scott into their home. Scott becomes best friends with Jesse and Angie's son Frankie, and the Hubbards are Cindy's closest supporters when she develops AIDS herself. Cindy is ostracized by many Pine Valley residents, including Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), Enid Nelson (Natalie Ross), and a hate group that sets fire to the Hubbard home. Cindy would later die but not before falling in love with and marrying Skye's uncle Stuart Chandler (David Canary), who adopts Scott.\n\nm. Annie Lavery (2010-2010)\n\na.
