        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis controlled field study examined the prevalence of selected VBP and the clinical and clinicopathological abnormalities in cats exposed to ectoparasites. Moreover, some risk factors for VBP exposure were identified using significant associations detected by multivariable logistic regression analysis between some of the investigated pathogens and independent variables.\n\nThe study was based on both antibody and molecular detection of feline VBPs under consideration to increase the possibility of evaluating exposure of cats to tested pathogens. We found that cats were extremely exposed to VBP because of the high antibody (88.3%), molecular (40%), and overall (antibody and PCR) positivity (92.4%) to at least one pathogen. Moreover, cats exposed to ectoparasites, because of their outdoor lifestyle and the lack of regular ectoparasiticide treatments (SG), showed a significantly higher molecular and overall (antibody and PCR) positivity compared to indoor cats with no ectoparasites and subjected to regular application of ectoparasiticides (CG). Exposure to multiple VBP was also very frequent, as about two-thirds of tested cats were antibody positive, 10% PCR positive and 30.1% antibody and PCR positive to more than one VBP at the time of sampling; the difference between SG and CG was significant for antibody or antibody and molecular positivity. Epidemiological similarities shared by some VBP can obviously be responsible for vector-borne co-infections but also other factors, such as pathogenic interactions between them, can delay or prevent clearance of VBI and concur to co-infections. Other studies detected a high overall blood PCR positivity to at least one VBP, i.e. 25–29.9% in Portugal [4, 17], 48.9% in northern Italy [18] and 45.4% in Cyprus [3]. Prevalence of co-infections was lower (2.2–9.8%) in those studies [3, 4, 17, 18].\n\nA small percentage of enrolled cats (12%) were antibody negative to all of VBP, and this percentage was significantly higher in the CG. However, we found a significant percentage of CG cats positive to the same VBP detected in the SG, and this may be explained by lack of compliance to ectoparasiticide treatment, low efficacy of the used ectoparasiticide, and/or non-vectorial transmission of the pathogen. For instance, in the case of L. infantum infection, pyrethroids are used in dogs for sand fly bite prevention, but almost all of these compounds are toxic to cats, and only a collar containing flumethrin and imidacloprid was able to reduce the incidence of L. infantum infection in cats [19–21]. Blood transfusion is a main non-vectorial transmission route of feline VBI but, at least for hemoplasmas, other routes are strongly suspected [22–24]. Moreover, our model of multivariable analysis did not find significant associations between exposure to any individual or multiple VBP and outdoor lifestyle or individual ectoparasiticide treatment. Attipa et al. [3] also used multivariable logistic regression to investigate risk factors of some VBPs detected in cats from Cyprus and, similarly, they did not find any association between positivity to any tested VBP and the lack of ectoparasiticide use while they found an association of outdoor lifestyle only with hemoplasma positivity [3].\n\nBased on antibody detection, R. conorii (or other cross-reacting Rickettsia species) was the most frequent agent circulating among tested cats (48.7%), and it was significantly more common in cats exposed to ectoparasites (SG). Rickettsia conorii is historically the most important zoonotic species of the Rickettsia genus in the Mediterranean area, and was recently confirmed as a possible causative agent of acute febrile illness in dogs showing a transient positive blood PCR and seroconversion [25]. Studies about the infection of cats with Rickettsia spp. of the Mediterranean spotted fever group reported the collection of infected ticks on cats, and obtained positive blood PCR and a high antibody prevalence [10, 17, 26–28]. These data support the need for prospective investigations about the pathogenic role of spotted fever group Rickettsia spp. in cats.\n\nAntibody prevalence for B. henselae was high (45.7%), as was the seroreactivity for A. phagocytophilum (26.9%), B. microti (20.3%) and E. canis (16.2%) antigens. In many previous serological studies performed by IFAT, antibody titer against tested VBP was not reported, or they were low [6, 10, 29, 30]. Interestingly, we detected high titers against B. henselae (10.7%), R. conorii (10.1%) and E. canis (3.5%) antigens; however, we cannot exclude the possibility of serological cross-reactions with other species of the same genus. This is most important for R. conorii and E. canis because we documented the exposure of cats by serology, but we were not able to find the pathogen DNA in blood as shown in other studies [31, 32]. Similarly, we did not detect DNA of Anaplasma, Hepatozoon and piroplasmids such as Babesia or Cytauxzoon. This might be a consequence of the lack of exposure, clearance or sequestration of the organisms in other tissues, or technical limitations. However, in a study performed on blood collected from outdoor cats from a confined area of Sicily, only Hepatozoon felis DNA was detected in one cat (0.3%). Therefore, it is likely that some VBPs are not common in Sicily and the Calabria region [33]. Anaplasma/Ehrlichia DNA detection is rare in cats, and more frequently A. phagocytophilum is amplified [4, 17, 31, 34], but A. platys or A. platys-like organisms were also occasionally characterised in cats in southern Europe and the seropositivity detected in this study could be due to different species of Anaplasma [3, 35]. However, Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. were not found in other studies in Greece and Spain [36, 37].\n\nHepatozoon felis distribution seems to be quite variable in southern Europe. In fact, it is very rare in Italy, but a focus was recently detected in Matera, where single cases of Hepatozoon canis and Hepatozoon silvestris infections were also seen [10, 33, 38]. Hepatozoon felis is reported in the Iberian Peninsula with a prevalence range of 1.6–13.8% [4, 17, 31, 39] and the highest molecular prevalence (37.9%) was recently found in Cyprus [3].\n\nFeline piroplasmid infection is uncommon in Europe. Piroplasmid infection is caused by Cytauxzoon spp. [39–43], Babesia vogeli, or Babesia canis [4, 17]. In Italy, DNA of B. microti was sequenced in cats from Sicily and Milan but, despite 20.3% antibody prevalence for B. microti obtained in this study, we were not able to detect piroplasmid DNA, and we cannot exclude that other Babesia spp. elicited antibody production in cats [44, 45]. Interestingly, adult cats were less likely to have antibodies to B. microti compared to those < 1 year of age. Young cats might therefore be more susceptible to Babesia spp. infection than adults but the antibody response would not persist possibly because of clearance of the infection.\n\nBartonella spp. was VBP with the highest overall (48.7%) and molecular (21.3%) prevalence in this study, and molecular prevalence was significantly higher in SG. A significant association between Bartonella spp. exposure and FIV infections or increased globulin values were found by multivariate analysis as previously reported by univariate analysis only for globulins [46] but not for FIV [3, 5]. A very high B. henselae antibody prevalence (45.7%) was also found. Two species were sequenced, and B. henselae was more prevalent (15.2%) than B. clarridgeiae (6.1%). These results confirm data obtained in 42 cats from the same area carrying ticks or fleas at the time of examination, where blood PCR positivity for Bartonella spp. was 38.1%, and B. henselae (21.4%) was more frequently detected than B. clarridgeiae (16.6%) [10]. A higher molecular prevalence was previously found in Sicily in a study using a nested-PCR where positivity was 70.6% in blood, 72.9% in lymph node aspirates, and 60.0% in oral swabs and B. henselae was the only sequenced species [8]. In other European countries, lower blood PCR prevalences were reported ranging 1–22.4%, and this might be due to the exposure of investigated cats to fleas or the assays used [3–5, 28, 31, 36, 37]. However, also in these latter studies, B. henselae was usually more frequent than B. clarridgeiae and only in one cat was B. kholerae DNA was sequenced [37].\n\nAs in other studies performed in Italy [10, 18], Cyprus [3], and Portugal [16, 47], we frequently detected hemoplasma DNA in cat blood (18.3%) and “Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum” was more commonly sequenced, compared to “Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis” and M. haemofelis. Other studies reported lower prevalence (range 7.8–14.9%) but similar species were sequenced and represented possible co-infections [12, 36, 48, 49]. We obtained significant associations by multivariate analysis between hemoplasma positivity and anaemia (OR= 2.76), adult age (OR= 4.53), FIV positivity (OR= 5.07), and increased creatinine values (OR=7.68). Interestingly, hemoplasma positive cats have seven times higher risk for an increased creatinine concentration and this association was never found before by multivariate analysis. We performed a cross-sectional study and therefore did not have the possibility to confirm chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats with high creatinine; however, in two-thirds of cats urinalysis showed inappropriate urine specific gravity that is suggestive of CKD. A causative role for variables cannot be assessed by cross-sectional investigations, and prospective surveys on hemoplasma long carrier cats should be considered. Older age of hemoplasma-positive cats was also found in two other studies using multivariable logistic analysis, and could contribute to the association between hemoplasma positivity and high creatinine concentrations [3, 49]. Hemolytic anaemia is the main pathogenic effect of M. haemofelis and less frequently of other hemoplasmas, but subclinical carriers can be found, and this may explain when in other studies multivariate analysis did not find associations between hemoplasmas and anaemia [3, 49]. Conversely, significant association with FIV was previously reported by other authors using multivariable analysis, and this comorbidity could be due to epidemiological factors (sharing of the way of transmission) or facilitation of long-term hemoplasma infections in FIV positive cats [3, 49, 50].\n\nFeline L. infantum infection can be considered an emergent VBI in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis [20]. Many studies evaluated antibody and or molecular prevalence in southern Italy, and a wide prevalence range was found by both antibody detection (2.4–59%) and blood PCR (7.1–61%) [10, 33, 51–53]. Epidemiological (endemicity, characteristics of the studied population) and technical (serological cut-off, molecular technique) differences may account for this variability. Antibody prevalence obtained in this study was within the above range (9.6%), but blood DNA detection was as low as 2.0%. Low molecular prevalence was also found by non-invasive samplings as conjunctival (1.5%) and oral (1.5%) swabs, or by lymph node aspirate (1.7%) or urine (2%). Interestingly, high parasite loads were obtained only from blood (up to 80,000 Leishmania/ml), and the clinical relevance of this finding lies in the risk of iatrogenic transmission of L. infantum by blood transfusion as reported in dogs [54, 55].\n\nCo-infection of L. infantum with “Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum”, B. henselae or B. clarridgeiae was similar to that reported in other studies [3, 10]. However, other L. infantum co-infections are known including Anaplasma/Ehrlichia spp., Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp., and Borrelia burgdorferi [3, 4, 17]."
