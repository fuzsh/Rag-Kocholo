        "text": "By\n\nIn today’s fourth new episode of Prospect Park’s All My Children on Hulu and iTunes, fans got confirmation of what they have suspected during the lead-up to the relaunch of AMC and all the teaser previews!\n\nDavid (Vincent Irizarry), who finally made his way back to Pine Valley from prison, is the man responsible for the person who has been in the coma! That man, is JR Chandler (Ryan Bittle)! In new scenes recreating the finale cliffhanger on ABC’s All My Children, viewers learn that JR shot Marissa as David tussled with him for the gun, and then David shot JR! Kudos to Vincent Irizarry as well for today’s performance as Dr. Evil!\n\nIn another critical scene, Bianca (Eden Riegel) visited the gravesite of Marissa Tasker, the woman she was in love with, before JR’s gunshot, who of course happened to also be David’s daughter! Angie (Debbi Morgan) tells Jessie (Darnell Williams) and Zach (Thorsten Kaye) about her part in David’s return to Pine Valley as the men try to figure out where Cassandra disappeared too, without letting Angie on to what is going on.\n\nDavid also is in pivotal scenes with Cara (Lindsay Hartley), where he learns that she miscarried their baby! A grief-stricken David happens upon JR’s hospital room and thinks about killing him! Meanwhile, Cara has an exchange with her brother, Griffin (Jordi Vilasuso), that David must never find out what really happened to the baby! What do you think happened?\n\nFinally, Miranda (Denyse Tontz) got mixed up in an almost, sort of, kind of three-way with “the boy of her dreams” Hunter (Daniel Colvin), which ended up with a twist! It was AJ (Eric Nelsen) to the rescue who plummeted Hunter! Elsewhere, Pete (Rob Scott Wilson) and Celia (Jordan Lane Price) continued their romantic overtures towards one another!\n\nNow below, watch the fourth episode of AMC, and remember it’s now cliffhanger Thursday for the TOLN soaps because the next all-new episode airs Monday! What was your favorite part of today’s episode? Where you surprised by the reveals? Let us know!\n\nUp Next\n\nDaytime Emmy Nominee Interview: General Hospital's Jason Thompson!\n\nDon't Miss\n\nAMC's Cady McClain, Eric Nelsen & Denyse Tontz, Darnell Williams Red Carpet Premiere Video Interviews!\n\nYou may like\n\nLindsay Hartley Temporarily Replaces Kelly Monaco as General Hospital’s Sam McCall\n\nKelly Ripa Becomes a ‘Disney Legend’ Honoree and Shares, “I Met My Smokin’ Hot Husband on the Set of ‘All My Children’ 30 Years Ago”\n\n(WATCH) ‘Santa Barbara’ 40th Anniversary Reunion: From the Red Carpet to Behind The Scenes\n\n(WATCH) Y&R’s Lauralee Bell and Michael Damian Talk Danny & Christine’s Crossover to The Bold and the Beautiful\n\nRebecca Budig on Joining the Cast of The Bold and the Beautiful: “I Just Hope That the Fans Accept Me as Taylor and That it All Works Out”\n\nRebecca Budig Joins the Cast of The Bold and the Beautiful as the New Dr. Taylor Hayes\n\nAll My Children\n\nKelly Ripa Becomes a ‘Disney Legend’ Honoree and Shares, “I Met My Smokin’ Hot Husband on the Set of ‘All My Children’ 30 Years Ago”\n\nBy\n\nKelly Ripa is now officially a Disney Legend! The morning talk show host and former All My Children star (ex-Hayley Vaughan Santos) received the honor over the weekend at the D23 event in Anaheim, California, and the home of Disneyland.\n\nThe ‘legend’ honors goes to those individuals who have significantly influenced the Walt Disney Company. Ripa received the recognition for her work in television over her three-decade career, beginning with All My Children, followed by close to a quarter-century of hosting Live! You can catch the ceremonies as they begin to stream on Monday, August 12th on DisneyPlus.\n\nRyan Seacrest presented Ripa with the honors, marking a reunion of the two who co-hosted Live! together for six seasons, before Seacrest made the decision to move back to the West Coast full-time (the talk show is shot in New York City). Upon Seacrest’s exit, Ripa’s real-life husband and former AMC co-star Mark Consuelos, (ex-Mateo Santos) took over the co-hosting gig and the ratings have seen an impressive increase ever since.\n\nTaking to the podium to accept her honoes, Kelly shared, “Thank you so much, and Ryan, thank you from the bottom of my heart.” She joked, “I’m just so glad that you finally found something else to host.”\n\nRipa continued, “This feels surreal for me, and I want to thank Bob Iger (CEO, Walt Disney Company) for this truly magical experience.” As she spoke to the cameras and the audience she also remarked, “I know what you’re thinking. Why her ? What has she ever done?”\n\nKelly said proudly that she has been with the same company for 34 years, “which my great good fortune. I owe everything to Disney. Not only my career, but my entire immediate family.”\n\n“I met my smokin’ hot husband (Mark Consuelos) on the set of All My Children 30 years ago, and from there we made our own three children (Lola, Michael and Joaquin) right backstage in the Disney Labs.” In jest, Kelly added, “HR has asked me to remind everyone of their strict, no hidden Mickey policy. Being a ‘Disney legend’ is just the pixie dust on top of the Sundae. Thank you so very much, so honored.”\n\nTaking to Ripa’s Instagram post on the event were Mark Consuelos, himself, who said, “The woman, the myth, the Disney Legend!!! Proud of you babe!!!!” In addition, former on-screen sister-in-law, now GH’s Natalia, Eva LaRue (ex-Maria, All My Children) expressed, “OH, MA, GAWD- Amazing!

The love story of Ryan and Gillian was complex. He believed that Gillian was a wealthy princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and the two were eventually married. Later, Gillian was killed when TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to Michael Fairman TV on Sunday, Mathison expressed, “Esta was somebody very, very close to my heart. We both came to New York around the same time and basically started and learned acting together. Ryan and Gillian are such a beautiful sweet couple … and hold a very, very special place in my heart.”\n\nSpeaking on TerBlanche’s love of animals and reconnecting with her in 2023, Cameron recounted, “Esta was literally one of the sweetest kindest people I’ve eve met. When she heard that my dog (Red) was sick and paralyzed last year, she volunteered to take him for a few days to try to care for him to give me a break. We hadn’t really been in touch for a long time so it came out of nowhere and after spending time with her, he learned how to walk again. 🙏”\n\nIn closing Mathison shared, “She was just a beautiful soul and had a healing spirit.” TerBlanche died unexpectedly on Thursday. The cause of death has not yet been determined.\n\nCameron also took to his Instagram Story on Sunday, sharing some images of himself and Esta with one said from All My Children, which read,”RIP my sweet princess.”\n\nWhen All My Children came to its conclusion in 2011, Ryan was reunited with Gillian one more time when he received a ‘heavenly’ visit from his princess. Now with TerBlanche’s death, it makes the scenes all the more poignant. Watch it below.\n\nShare your thoughts on Cameron’s sentiments on the death of his AMC co-star, Esta TerBlanche, and let us know if you were a Ryan and Gillian fan via the comment section below.\n\nAll My Children\n\n‘All My Children’ Favorite, Esta TerBlanche, Dies at 51\n\nBy\n\nEsta TerBlanche who played All My Children’s Gillian Andrassy Lavery died in her Los Angeles home at the age of 51. Her passing was confirmed by her godddaughter, Barbie Ashley to TMZ.\n\nAccording to Ashley, Esta died unexpectedly on Thursday. However, according to a report, medical personnel believe the she has been dead a day before she was found. The cause of death has not yet been determined and is under investigation at this time, according to Esta’s rep, Lisa Rodrigo.\n\nEsta, who hailed from South Africa, began her career early on in her life when she was crowned Miss Teen South Africa in 1991. She later starred in the South African soap opera series, Egoli: Place of Gold, as Bienkie Naudé Hartman from 1992-95.\n\nThe South African news and entertainment blog, TV with Thinnus, reported Esta’s body was found by police after workers couldn’t contact her for a number of days and alerted law enforcement. Police contacted her younger brother Henko who lives in New York, who in turn contacted her family in South Africa.\n\nBurget Mueller, EP of Egoli said of Esta: “She was the epitome of professionalism, always well prepared and brought joy to set. She was beloved under her colleagues and we were very proud of her when she left to go to America and found fame there with All My Children.”\n\nTaking to Facebook, Esta’s PR rep, Lisa Rodrigo added, “I can not believe I am posting this. It’s with a heavy heart that my friend and client Esta TerBlanche passed away Thursday of natural causes. An autopsy report is pending. I am still processing and in shock. Esta was a beautiful soul in and out. I was proud to know her and work with her. More to come in the days ahead. Thank you for the messages so far. If I haven’t gotten to you, I will soon. May she RIP with the angels that she is.”\n\nTerBlanche appeared on All My Children from 1997-2001 and the love story of Ryan (Cameron Mathison) and Gillian was one of the most popular of the day. She later returned for the AMC series finale in 2011.\n\nIn story, Ryan believed that his beloved Gillian was a princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her.

When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and they married on, April 9, 2001.\n\nWhen TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa, Gillian was killed-off when an assassin mistook her for Anna Devane and killed her. Gillian’s heart was then donated to save the life of Laura English.\n\nAt the time of her death, Esta was an animal activist, and she told Soap Opera Digest in a very recent interview: “At the moment, I am knee-deep into some animal projects. I grew up on a game farm, and just love animals. I’m working with a rescue project for some prairie dogs. And my Persian cat just had kittens, so there’s a lot of feeding going on around my house.” Esta also shared that she was eager to get back into acting, while also working on her South African cancer foundation Create Your Breakthrough.\n\nMichael Fairman TV sends our condolences to Esta’s family, loved ones and friends during this difficult time.\n\nNow below, share your remembrances and thoughts on the passing of All My Children’s Esta TerBlanche via the comment section.
