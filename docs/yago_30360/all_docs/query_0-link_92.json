        "text": "The Mama Bear Story Project is a collection of portraits and autobiographical essays from members of Serendipitydodah – Home of the Mama Bears.\n\nThe Weight of Expectations\n\nMy daughter came into this world at 6:05 p.m, screaming in protest at the bright lights and cold air. My husband cut the umbilical cord. She was taken to the other side of the room to be weighed, measured, and cleaned. Although I had only held her briefly, my arms already felt so empty without her. My husband quickly brought her back to me and laid her gently in my arms. I looked down at her face, so perfect and beautiful. The joy of finally having her and the anxiety of her life being our responsibility created a storm of emotion within me. I knew at that moment I would do anything to protect her.\n\nThose first weeks were a blur. I dealt with postpartum anxiety that I mostly kept to myself, despite my husband’s unwavering love and support. I felt guilty for being overwhelmed and anxious. Like I wasn’t a good mother if I wasn’t elated every second of the day. I was happy and overwhelmed, joyful and afraid. I sat watching her sleep, tears filling my eyes. What if I didn’t show her I loved her enough? What if her life wasn’t happy? Or what if I wasn’t enough for her?\n\nJoy and fear are often intertwined, gripping one another like a vice. How could I be so overwhelmingly joyful and terrified simultaneously? I couldn’t imagine that years later all of those feelings would come flooding back, knocking the breath out of me, until the day our daughter sat me down and told me, “Mom, I am transgender.”\n\nExpectations: I’m Having a Boy\n\nI remember the day we had our first ultrasound. Everyone in our families had been making predictions about our baby’s gender. My husband was convinced we were having a girl, I knew it was a boy. The ultrasound was performed and I gloated about being correct (joke’s on me now). This was the first day we unknowingly began laying expectations on the tiny shoulders of our unborn child. We picked a name and imagined all of the “boy” things we would do together. Everyone we talked to shared stories of their sons, grandsons, and nephews. As most new parents can attest to, we received constant unsolicited advice. Most people had good intentions, but it was overwhelming receiving different advice from everyone. I let the things people were telling us creep into my mind and make a home there. I worried that I would make the wrong choices.\n\n“Boys are a handful.”\n\n“Boys are wild.”\n\n“You gotta toughen them up.”\n\nAs the years passed, we tried our best to raise our child in a loving, open-minded home. Teaching her to love others equally and to never discriminate has always been a top priority. Living in rural Kentucky as a progressive family comes with challenges, but we always wanted our daughter to be passionate about her beliefs, stand up, and be proud. We let her explore her interests. We made plenty of mistakes and tried to learn from them. With each passing year, we held onto the expectations many parents have of their children, particularly of their sons. Although we always let her be her own person, we were still under the influence of popular ideas of what raising a boy meant.\n\nMore Expectations: Do This; Wear This\n\nFrom an early age, our daughter was shown that boys are supposed to act, dress, and exist in a certain way. Every time we let her try something new, like art lessons or cooking, someone would make comments like, “that’s for girls” or “he’ll be a good husband some day.” The seeds were planted in her mind that her worth was measured by how masculine she was. My husband and I didn’t think activities or toys were inherently feminine or masculine, but her peers, some of our family members, and other adults told her differently. I had a lot of fear that I would raise a son that wouldn’t be compassionate. My husband and I didn’t want to put another insensitive man into this world.\n\nI never fully realized how much influence society has on what we expect of our children until the day my daughter told me she is trans. When I think of that day, my heart still flutters. She paced back and forth in our living room, unable to look me in the eyes. The words spilling from her, as if her body couldn’t hold onto them any longer. I sat in complete shock, unaware I was holding my breath.\n\nAfter we talked, I felt the panic rising in my chest. I wanted her to know that I loved her and would support her no matter what, but I was afraid for her. My mind couldn’t focus on anything else. What was this going to mean for her future? What was going to happen to the relationships in our lives? The guilt consumed me. We had failed our daughter because she had held it in for so long. I was selfish for being afraid of how it was going to affect our extended family relationships.\n\nPeeling Away the Expectations\n\nThe weeks and months after that day, I drifted through the world, focused instead on this secret that sat heavily on my chest. I have learned many things since the beginning. I learned to feel all of my feelings. Every single one, even the ones that were the most uncomfortable. I will, undoubtedly, learn many more things in the years to come. The most important thing I learned in this process, my daughter is the bravest person I know. I could not be more proud of her.\n\nEven being raised in an accepting home, children fear disappointing their parents’ expectations. No matter how liberal you are, your child lives in fear of how you will react to their coming out. As my daughter said, “It’s different when it is your own child.” She is absolutely correct. It was as if she was physically weighed down by what society expected of her, what my husband and I expected of her. But I am the one that laid my expectations on her and I am responsible for taking them back.\n\nDefeat…\n\nA couple of years before she came out, she went through a time where I didn’t recognize her. She had always marched to the beat of her own drum, having her own personal style, interests, and outgoing personality, but she stopped being this way.\n\nThe first signs were outward, wearing her hair in a buzz cut and clothes the same as the boys at school. Her spirit seemed dulled, as if a dimmer was slowly being turned, threatening to take her into darkness. We told ourselves maybe it was a phase or just part of growing up. When she came out to us, we realized what was really going on; for years she had been increasingly uncomfortable in her own skin.\n\n…Then Victory\n\nAs the light started to come back into her eyes, the physical changes were symbolic of her rebirth. Her hair grew out, she wanted to give away the clothes that felt like they belonged to someone else. Throughout this transformation, I knew there was a bigger change going on within her, but I had no idea she was slowly showing us her true self. Dipping her toes into the waters of uncertainty to make sure we would be there to pull her out if the current became too strong.\n\nThat feeling I had when I first laid eyes on her came flooding back, what if I didn’t show her that my love is truly unconditional? After having time to process, I knew there was one thing I needed to do, lift the weight off of her shoulders and carry it around for a while. When I did this, I saw things through a whole new lens. Why do we expect our kids to be a person we made up in our minds instead of being the unique, beautiful souls we created? Our daughter is her own person.\n\nManaging Expectations: Joy over Fear\n\nOne of the most important things I learned, and continue to remind myself, is to feel the joy more than the fear. The world can be such an ugly place, especially with hateful legislation threatening the lives and freedoms of LGBTQIA+ people. It is easy to get enveloped in fear, but my armor is my unapologetic joy for my daughter and her future. To see her being herself is breathtaking. The small moments are what helped me break free from the tight grip fear had on me. I am lucky because I get to experience firsts with my daughter, and these will be moments we will both always remember. Having a trans child is unique in that way. Your child is old enough to remember all of their firsts with you.\n\nThe day we shopped for her Junior prom holds a special place in my heart. It started off rather disappointing. We arrived at a local bridal shop that sold prom dresses. This would be the first time my daughter had worn a dress so publicly, as she wasn’t out to everyone yet. She was nervous, as was I, but I wanted this to be a fun experience for her. The staff at the shop were awkward and after initially asking us if we needed anything, they avoided speaking to us. She took a few dresses in the dressing room, but wasn’t comfortable showing them to me.\n\nWe left feeling defeated. I was angry at the staff, but tried my best to hold it in and still make the day fun for her.\n\nNot Letting a Good Day Go Bad\n\nThe next stop was a department store that only sold a handful of prom dresses. We found two black dresses that she liked, but she was hesitant to try them on. I gently encouraged her to just try them and if she wasn’t comfortable showing them to me, then she didn’t have to. I stood outside the dressing room door taking deep breaths, anticipating her disappointment. My phone buzzed with a text. I opened it to a beautiful picture of my daughter in the dress and practically jumped for joy. I knocked on the door and told her how amazing she looked. She thanked me and changed back into her clothes. When she stepped out of the dressing room, her face lit up. I asked, cautiously, “Is this the dress?” She answered, “Yes.” The joy radiated off of her.\n\nAs we walked through the rack of clothes, my daughter tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around and she wrapped her arms around me, hugging me so tightly. “Thank you. I love you.”, she said. I hugged her back tightly. Holding on to her as if she were anchoring me to the Earth. “I love you more than anything.” I told her. Tears filled my eyes and I cried in the middle of JCPenney. I knew at that moment that everything was going to be ok. I have never doubted the decision my husband and I made. To accept our daughter for who she is and to celebrate the little things. I also came to the realization that I was going to shed more tears in this process than I had in her whole life leading up to this.\n\nFloating through the World: Unburdened by Expectations\n\nWe have noticed a change in our daughter. She seems to float through the world lighter, with a sense of self we have never seen in her before. She talks of her future often, with hope in her eyes and a genuine smile on her face. Although the weight of the world can be overwhelming, she holds her head up high. She is anchored in the security that we will never put those expectations back on her shoulders and she will never carry them for herself again.\n\nWe have lost family members due to their bigotry. I had to tell myself that it isn’t anything we did. It is their ignorance that caused this divide. I struggled at first with how our family would react. But as time went on, I realized that family is love, support, respect, empathy, kindness, strength; not genetics. I stood up for my daughter and I am proud that I didn’t back down. If someone can’t love our daughter for who she is, they never truly loved her in the first place. Unconditional love adapts to growth and change. Love is not rigid and stagnant.\n\nTL;DR\n\nWe aren’t perfect parents, but we love our daughter for exactly who she is. Parents are given a role that is often underappreciated and overlooked. We have influence over the way society views children, which inevitably influences the way society views men and women. From that first ultrasound, I began to expect certain things of my child based solely on gender. With each expectation, the weight bared down on her and threatened to crush her beneath it. I had no idea I was even doing this to her. We teach our kids to listen and learn, but that is the exact thing we should be doing. Listening to them and learning who they truly are.\n\n*This story first appeared on 2 Rules for Writing and is shared here with the permission of the author, Nicole Hawkins.\n\nSerendipitydodah – Home of the Mama Bears is a private Facebook group for moms of LGBTQ+ kids.\n\nThe members of the group call themselves “Mama Bears” and the motto of the Mama Bear community is “Together we can change the world!”\n\nThe group is private so only members can see who is in the group and what is posted in the group.

I can’t breathe, I’m about to have a panic attack.” He’d been experiencing severe depression, and only weeks before had come out to my husband and me as transgender. We were already on months-long waiting lists to get him into treatment for depression, and the startling news of his gender identity made our situation feel even more precarious.\n\nThe moment he came out to us, he took a bold step forward into his authentic self, while I took a step back from mine. I wanted to project nothing but unconditional support, but inside, I struggled to process how my daughter was now my son.\n\nHis new name and pronouns were like glue in my mouth—my tongue protested the shape of foreign words. So many questions jumbled inside me. Was his gender identity the root of his depression? What signs did I miss? Can I keep him safe? What does this mean for his future? For mine? I was a mess of contradictions—straining to morph into the fierce gender advocate my son needed, while secretly googling “what percentage of trans youth change their minds?”\n\nThere is only one first moment a child comes out to you. At 14, telling us his truth took unfathomable courage and fortitude. I wish I had a do-over. I wish I could go back to that conversation and deluge him only with love—and hold back my questions, confusion, and fears.\n\nHis text from school felt like my second chance to be useful and supportive. More than anything, I wanted to ease his pain and suffering, and let him know he’s loved and safe.\n\nA tall order for a Thursday afternoon.\n\nI paced around the house unable to concentrate on anything but how to support him through this latest bout of anxiety. Finally, I hear the squeak of the school bus brakes, hiss of the opening door, the thud of his feet stomping off snow at the back door. He walks in, shrugs off his backpack and my attempts to check in with him. These days, I can’t predict his needs from one moment to the next. His mood shape shifts from despair, to exhaustion, to listlessness. His depression and my fears are growing more powerful.\n\nNo one is more desperate than a mother powerless to save her child. We’ll try anything—even a shallow hit of dopamine-fueled retail therapy.\n\n“How about a quick trip to Target?” I ask, passing him an afternoon snack of sliced apples that I know will go untouched. He imperceptibly nods. I’ll take it. I’ve never been more thrilled to drop twenty bucks on slime and a squishmallow.\n\nDriving home from the store, we fell into heavy silence. The smallest conversations exhaust him. I bite my tongue to keep from peppering him with questions—trying and failing to quiet the voice telling me if I can keep him talking, he won’t disappear. I catch a familiar tune and reach to turn up the radio.\n\nAnd I-I believe\n\nFate smiled and destiny\n\nNatalie Merchant’s haunting voice envelopes us.\n\nLaughed as she came to my cradle\n\nKnow this child will be able.\n\nWonder. Our song. The song I sang during those long, sleepless nights rocking her in the chocolate brown glider. Lullaby, anthem, benediction, prayer. The song I sang to this child—transforming so unpredictably beside me now—back when I knew every inch. The contour of cheeks so juicy they could burst, every delicious divot, dimple, and roll.\n\nThe music transports me instantly to our childhood nursery. That season felt as exhausting and transformational as this one. Rocking and singing one cold winter night, warmed by the nubby fabric of the glider and my faded blue front-zip sweatshirt I lived in for its easy access to feed her, I grab for the boppy nursing pillow on the floor beside the chair and secure it around my waist. After she latched onto my breast, my tired head sinks back against the chair and I close my eyes. Along with the calming pleasure of oxytocin, a new awareness suddenly floods my system. Looking down at those perfect rose lips on my breast, warmth rises up through me and I connect into a new sensation that I’m suddenly aware of, an ever present, flowing channel of love. This same, specific, all-encompassing, primal love that every mother since the dawn of time has felt for her baby.\n\nDirect knowing cascaded through my body. The protective devotion, promise, and hope channeled into one tiny human—this was the love holding up the world. How did I not know? Why didn’t someone tell me? I laughed. How could they?\n\nNo this child will not suffer.\n\nThe perception dawning inside me was beyond language or even reason. It was pure truth transmittable only through the frequency of music. A vow rose up from within me—a pledge as intact and uncompromising as Merchant’s voice. I’ll remake the world and be worthy of this baby and this love entrusted to me.\n\nPart of music’s power is how it hits the bloodstream immediately. In seconds, lyrics and melody combine to pack a visceral punch. Building to a crescendo, then shattering me at the peak of transcendence.\n\nWith love, with patience, and with faith, she’ll make her way.\n\nBraking cars ahead flood my son and I in red light. On this cold night, I listen to our song with my whole body. My breath deepens and slows, recalling the vow and that love from that winter long ago. I wiggle my toes inside my shoes. My grip on the wheel loosens. My belly unclenches for the first time in days.\n\nA knowing, again, rises up inside me. More subtle than before, yet just as clear. I sit up straighter. Surer. I can face this. Whatever he needs, wherever his gender and mental health journey goes, I’ll go too. No matter what.\n\nGrateful for the cover of night, I blink back tears and steal a glace. He turns to meet my gaze. God, I’ll never tire of looking into those dark, soulful eyes. He reaches across the seat and grabs my hand. I squeeze.\n\nWith love, with patience and with faith,\n\nHe’ll make his way.\n\nI can trust my ability to accompany a different child than the one I thought I had into adulthood, into the world. Out of all the mothers in the world I’m his. Like a friend reaching out in the dark, the song returned me to myself. The incomprehensible mysteries of my life will come, and I have a renewed capacity to bear all things.\n\nHe reaches down to crank up the volume and smiles. “I love this song.”\n\nHe’ll make his way, at least for one more day. And so will I.\n\nShannon Mannon is an author and parent, who has written for USA Today, Philadelphia Inquirer, & Motherly.

Check out these essential tips to help make your journey smooth and enjoyable!\n\n* Research, research, research! Stay informed about the laws, customs, and cultural norms of your destination to understand the local attitude towards transgender people.\n\n* Ensure your travel documents match your gender identity to avoid issues at borders or airports. Be sure to book your flight with the same name, gender, and birthdate as the ID you plan to travel with. If your current ID has your dead-name on it, that’s the name you have to use when booking your flight.\n\n* Keep all updated documents on YOU. A general safety tip is to make sure you have all necessary travel documents on your person so they are available at all times. This includes your ID, passport, work permit, and green card (if applicable) among other items. Make sure your name, gender, photo, and country of origin are updated to match your government-issued photo ID. If the items are not updated with your current name, photo, and gender, make the necessary steps to update those to avoid any issues while at the airport or in another country. Any items that are not matching ( e.g. the gender on your passport does not correlate to the gender on your ID) may cause issues when traveling. Depending on where you’re from, you might have the option to mark ‘X’ on your passport (such as the case with the United States in recent years), that indicates your gender. Be prepared to have an explanation or supporting documents when traveling to countries that do not recognize an X gender marker.\n\n* Consider completing a discreet notification card. How much you disclose to the TSA is up to you. One option for quietly communicating with TSA personnel is to use a preprinted “Notification Card” to disclose a particular personal item, medical condition, or other information. This card can be printed at home or carried in a photo on your phone. You can download the template for the card from the TSA website. TSA agents are trained to recognize this card, and to take action to provide the appropriate screening procedures.\n\n* Carry documentation for your prescriptions. If you travel with medicines or hormones in your carry-on, bring proof of prescription from a doctor. This could be in the form of a pharmacy reciept or a letter from your physician stating the items are medically necessary. If you’re traveling with syringes you’re required to declare them to TSA personnel at the airport checkpoint so they can be inspected. You can tell the TSA agents directly or use the Discreet Notification Card. It’s important to keep prescribed medicines and medical devices with the pharmacy labeling intact.\n\n* Choose transgender-friendly accommodations. Look for hotels, hostels, or vacation rentals that have a history of welcoming transgender guests.\n\n* Pack wisely. Consider packing clothing and documents that align with your gender identity.\n\n* Stay connected. Save important phone numbers, like your emergency contact and insurance provider, and consider registering with your government’s travel advisory program. And always let a trusted friend or family member know where you are traveling, your flight info and where you are staying.\n\n* Be prepared for airport security. Know your rights and be ready to explain your medical procedures or medications if needed. TSA scanners are now equipped with software called Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). ATR analyzes the scan image of the body and displays an outline of a generic person with the location of anything the software identifies as an “anomaly” or “alarm” that TSA agents need to look at more closely. With ATR, according to the TSA, images of a traveler’s actual body are never viewed by humans. TSA does not disclose how ATR detects anomalies, however in some cases, ATR software can register body contours not typical for a person’s gender as anomalies. Foreign objects such as prosthetics, binding garments, or even paper or change left in a pocket will commonly register as anomalies requiring further screening. Often this consists of a limited pat-down of the area(s) where an anomaly was detected, however it can potentially involve a complete pat-down. You may opt out of AIT scans at any time, but if you do opt out of AIT screening, you will be required to undergo a thorough pat down. Pat downs will be done by an agent matching your gender identity.\n\n* Find LGBTQ+ friendly spaces. Look for local organizations, bars, or events that cater to the transgender community.\n\n* Trust your instincts. If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, don’t hesitate to seek help or change your plans.\n\n* Consider TSA precheck. TSA offers an “expedited screening” program called TSA Pre-Check for travelers at a growing number of participating airports. While the program does not guarantee that one can avoid body scans or pat-downs, participants often go through a metal detector instead of a body scanner, and may experience pat-downs less frequently. Participants can also take advantage of conveniences such as leaving shoes and belts on during screening.

He said he imagined marrying a boy someday and that he had a crush on Jacob from “Twilight.” Without hesitation, I jokingly told him I was Team Edward but that I loved him anyway, followed by a very serious conversation about why some people may be unkind to him because of who he chooses to love.\n\nI’ve always been an avid ally of the queer community. In fact, they’re my community too. Gender doesn’t matter to me. I’m attracted to what makes people human. I like a kind heart, a great sense of humor, a creative mind and just the right amount of dorkiness. People safely assume I’m not queer because I fell in love with and married a man, so I’m not attacked for my choices. I get to live my life (mostly) without judgement.\n\nI knew Jette wouldn’t have that luxury and called all my gay and trans friends for guidance. I took him to Pride events, bought him books and told him repeatedly that he is exactly who he was meant to be. I smothered him in Mama Bear love while not letting on that I had a lot of anxiety about his future. I hid the fact that LGBTQ+ youth/young adults have a greater chance of becoming victims of violence, rape, addiction and suicide. I didn’t tell him that he could get fired, evicted and have to fight for basic human rights. I exposed him to thriving LGBTQ+ celebrities and pointed out happy same-sex couples in public.\n\nIn middle school, I was prepared to aggressively address all the bullying and discrimination he faced in school, but he respectfully asked me to take a seat. I was told I was being too protective and a “bit extra.” He didn’t want any special treatment, either negative or positive for simply being who he was. It was not easy giving him the reigns, but he fought his own battles with kindness, dignity and confidence (and many tears).\n\nI was his biggest fan. His own personal rainbow-clad cheerleading squad and he wanted none of that. I still tried to push various youth groups on him so he didn’t feel alone when things got hard, but he rejected all things Pride because he already had everything he needed — an affirming family and small accepting peer group. I respected his wishes and stayed on the sidelines but I could only protect him from the rest of the world for so long.\n\nShortly after we moved to Fergus Falls, he started paying attention to politics, current events, anti-LGBTQ+ organizations and he recognized the suffering that our youth were facing in school and in their own homes. He started following activists on both sides of the fence. He watched videos showcasing hate speech and violence against the LGBTQ+ community. I’ll never forget the day, or the fear in his eyes, when he asked me if anyone has been killed for being gay.\n\nOut of the blue one day, he said: “You should start something for these kids. I don’t need this, but they do.” Saga Youth was born the very next day. When I received negative backlash for simply trying to provide kids with safe spaces and activities, I took a leap (plunge) and created Fergus Pride.\n\nJette was reluctantly supportive of an entire movement instead of a small youth group, but he understood the need and he hated it at the same time. “You shouldn’t have to fight for or celebrate your right to just live your life.” Others in the community also deemed Fergus Pride unnecessary for other reasons. They called it “disgusting,” said I was “going to hell” and that we “don’t want to send the wrong message.” Some simply said “We don’t care if you’re gay, we just don’t want to hear about it,” or “when do we get a straight celebration?”\n\nI knew I was putting myself in a tough spot and by putting a spotlight on my family and business. Other businesses wanted to support me, but didn’t want it to affect their families and businesses. A handful stood with me. Selfishly, I chose to push that boundry because I wanted my son and other youth to thrive in Fergus Falls instead of moving away. I’ve gotten a lot of messages from former residents and they all left because Fergus Falls wasn’t their safe place. I just wanted to show them, and my son, that it could be. I’m not on a mission to change anyone’s mind. Truthfully, I don’t really want to be fighting for acceptance, rights and inclusivity in a community where people, including my son, live in fear. I wanted the world Jette thought he lived in when he was younger.\n\nThis year we held the third Fergus Pride celebration. Sadly, we lost Jette in a horrific and incomprehensible drowning accident last year on June 8, just weeks before our second Fergus Pride. He was only able to attend the first one and, thankfully, I have many pictures of him basking in the light of pure love and acceptance.\n\nEvery year, more residents and businesses show their support and want to get involved and I can feel change happening everywhere. More importantly, my Saga kids see it.\n\nWatching Jette navigate through his short life without needing me to protect him taught me a lot about advocacy, acceptance and love. He loved harder than anyone I’ve ever known and his confidence never waivered. I’d like to think that if Jette was still with us, he’d be proud to call Fergus Falls his home.\n\nKrystyne is the founder and President of SAGA Youth in Fergus Falls.

He’s loud and proud and won’t back down from this fight.\n\nAnyway, a lady on a post I was looking at said she just doesn’t understand being proud of being gay/trans and announcing your sexual preference. She said “It’s so strange. But maybe that’s their intention.”\n\nThis was my response to her …\n\n“First, thank you for explaining what your confusion is around LGBTQ+ Pride. That helps me to understand where you are coming from.\n\nAs for an explanation … I’m not proud of the fact that I’m gay. It is just simply that, a fact. I live it in my normal, day-to-day, sometimes boring life with my wife, son, dogs, chickens, house, job, hobbies, etc. It’s an innate part of who I am that I didn’t choose … I’m simply me.\n\nHere’s what I am proud of though … I’m still alive. My friends, family and everyone else who are a part of the LGBTQ+ community are a beautiful, incredible group of people who continue to shine despite having to endure lifetimes of hatred and discrimination. We have been told we are sinners, unnatural, abominations, criminals, second class citizens, unworthy of love and even life itself. We have been bullied, harassed, beaten up, maimed & murdered. Despite all of that, we continue to live, love and for some of us – survive. For many of us though, survival was stripped away – sometimes directly by another’s hand, but always by another’s hatred. We celebrate with Pride because we’re still here and we have a community of fellow LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters who we love. We celebrate with Pride our courage, our love and our community. We show up with Pride while we continue fighting for ourselves and each other against people who would see us silenced, stripped of basic rights and yes, even our lives.\n\nHere’s a very brief history of Pride month because it is important to understand where this started. For many years in NYC (just as in most places in the US), the police routinely and brutally raided gay bars and clubs. On June 28th, 1969, during a raid at the Stonewall Inn, people had finally had enough and fought back. It began what would be called the Stonewall riots that would last 6 days. On the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, the first Pride parade was held. It was called the Christopher Street Liberation Day and was attended by thousands of people. It was the beginning of the gay rights movement. It was the beginning of our community saying that not only will we no longer silently accept the abuse and mistreatment we face every single day; it was our community saying that we are worthy and we aren’t going away just because you disagree with who we fundamentally are as human beings.\n\nIf this is hard to understand, then I would point to other celebrations that are about freedom, liberation, and independence. Days that include flags, parades, picnics, entertainment, and being with family, friends and like-minded community. A couple of those celebrations that I can think of right off the top of my head are Juneteenth and the 4th of July. Whether it’s these or LGBTQ+ Pride celebrations, it all started with people who were being held down, discriminated against & denied freedom, and they finally had enough and either fought back themselves or had others who fought with/for them. Every one of these groups fought for liberation and freedom, and now celebrate who they/we are.\n\nSo yes, we officially celebrate LGBTQ+ Pride in June. And… we celebrate it in hope, love and defiance any time someone tries to oppress and silence us.”\n\nThank you to all Mama Bears who are standing with their Reasons every step of the way.\n\nHappy Pride ya’ll 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️❤️\n\nTogether we can change the world!\n\nSerendipitydodah – Home of the Mama Bears is a private Facebook group for moms of LGBTQ+ kids.

I highly recommend that you watch the whole series up to this episode before reading further. IMO you won’t really be able to absorb the lessons this episode holds unless you have watched the entire series.\n\nOMG – Ted Lasso episode 9 of season 3 is one of my favorites and has all the feels!\n\nIt also has some important lessons for LGBTQ+ allies weaved into the story.\n\nFor a little background … we found out in episode 6 that one of the Richmond players, Colin Hughes, is gay. Then in episode 8 Isaac, Colin’s teammate and best friend, “accidentally” finds out Colin is gay. In episode 9 we find Isaac refusing to speak to Colin. We don’t know if Isaac is mad that Colin is gay or mad that Colin didn’t tell him … we suspect the latter because we know the spirit of the show.\n\nAs the episode continues we find Richmond in a game in which Isaac and Colin are not playing well. After the opposing team has scored, and Richmond makes another sloppy play, a disgruntled fan hurls a homophobic slur and Isaac loses it and storms into the stands to confront the fan. After Isaac is held back and then ejected from the rest of the game we find the team in the locker room at half time down a point and down a man. In the midst of confronting the circumstances they find themselves in Colin comes out to the team and Ted delivers one of his classic bizarre analogies to express the team’s love and support for Colin.\n\nHere’s the lessons for LGBTQ+ allies tucked within the story:\n\n(1) NO ONE owes their coming out story to ANYONE\n\nLGBTQ+ people don’t owe anyone their coming out story – they don’t owe it to to parents, to best friends, to teammates. They don’t owe it to ANYONE!\n\nIsaac is mad that Colin didn’t come out to him. But Colin reminds Isaac that coming out was not about anyone but himself and that coming out is scary and people have to come out in their own way and their own time.\n\nWhen someone comes out to you be grateful for the gift they have given you and thank them for trusting you with their true self.\n\n(2) COMING OUT is a JOURNEY for most LGBTQ+ people.\n\nOne of the things I love the most about Colin’s coming out story arc is we still haven’t heard him say the words “I’m gay.”\n\nEven when it is obvious that Colin has come out in the locker room we never hear Colin say the words “I’m gay.” Colin doesn’t want to come out to everyone at this time and the audience is “everyone.”\n\nLater, when Isaac finally shows up at Colin’s house to talk things out, Isaac asks if Colin will come out to everyone now, Colin says “no” and that it’s enough for now for his teammates to know.\n\nComing out is a journey for most LGBTQ+ people. Most LGBTQ+ people come out in moments spread across time.\n\nSome LGBTQ+ people say they never stop coming out.\n\nWhen someone comes out to you respect their privacy and give them time and space to navigate their own coming out journey.\n\n(3) Friends “DON’T NOT CARE”\n\nWhen we realize that Colin has come out to his teammates in the locker room we hear his teammates saying “it’s ok – we don’t care.” But saying “we don’t care if you’re gay” is not the most supportive and loving position we can take when a friend comes out to us.\n\nI won’t go into the details of the bizarre but brilliant story that Ted shares after Colin comes out in the locker room (hopefuly you have watched it before reading this), but the point of the story is that saying “it’s ok mate, we don’t care that you’re gay” is not the kind of support that good friends should offer a friend who has come out to them. And the standout quote for Ted’s story is “we don’t not care.”\n\nTed’s story reminds us that “not caring” is wrapped up in tolerance and privilege but our LGBTQ+ friends need something different from us – they need to know we are there “with” them – they need to know that now that they have come out to us they are “not alone” and we do care about who they are because we care about them and what impacts their lives.\n\nWhen someone comes out to you don’t say “I don’t care” – instead remind them how much you do care with your words and your actions.\n\n(4) It’s NOT about YOU\n\nThere’s a scene early in the episode where Colin talks to Trent (the only other person other than Isaac who knows Colin is gay at this point in the show) about the way Isaac is shunning him. I love that Trent doesn’t tell Colin to try and talk to Isaac. Trent just advises Colin to give Isaac some space. This is a great reminder that LGBTQ+ people are not responsible for our feelings when they come out to us – they shouldn’t have to educate us, explain anything to us, hold our hand, help us come to terms with anything. Coming out is not about us allies. If we have “stuff” to figure out or learn or feel we need to do those things on our own. And we should remember we don’t need to understand everything or have everything worked out within our selves to be a supportive and loving friend. When someone comes out to us don’t make the mistake of making it about you. It’s NOT about YOU!\n\n(5) GIVE LOVE\n\nAll throughout the series we see the impact Ted Lasso is having on those he comes in contact with – the press, his superiors, the team he coaches, his son etc…. and one of the people who has probably changed the most because of Ted is Roy Kent. This week we see Roy leading a press conference after Richmond has won the game Isaac was ejected from.\n\nOf course the press wants to ask questions about what Isaac did and Roy delivers a wonderful “Lassolike” analogy to make it clear that although Richmond does not support the way Isaac handled the situation they do support Isaac.\n\nThe analogy actually has a LOT of lessons wrapped up in it … lessons to remind us that everyone has “stuff” going on and that we shouldn’t judge people by one thing they do, lessons about how we should give people the benefit of the doubt most of the time and respect people’s privacy by not insisting that we know everything about them even if they are a public figure, but the most important lesson is that we should mostly be GIVING LOVE,\n\nThe world needs more love.\n\nSo, look for every opportunity to spread love, be love, give love.\n\nYour love can change the world.\n\n******\n\nThis blog is hosted by Real Mama Bears, an organization dedicated to supporting, educating and empowering families with LGBTQ+ members and the LGBTQ+ community.
