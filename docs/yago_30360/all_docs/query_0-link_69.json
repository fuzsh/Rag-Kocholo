His career began with Duke on March 02, 1996 retiring June 01, 2014 sharing eighteen years of life with his Duke family. Friends, community and family will deeply miss Michael. Ah, perfect endings. Now I’ve learned that some poems don’t rhyme, some stories don’t have a clear beginning, middle, or end. Life seems more about having to make abrupt changes-when least expected, taking a moment and making it the best moment it can possibly be. Life is not about not knowing what’s going to happen next; it’s more about the not knowing what will happen next, then fully appreciating the circumstance rather than expecting anything from it.\n\nThomas Haney, born January 14, 1942 passed away on Tuesday, December 24, 2019 at the young age of 77. Thomas had been an employee of Duke Medical Center working as a Clinical Research Coordinator II in the Medical Center’s Clinical Research Unit.

He was 90 years old, born on February 12, 1929. His career with Duke Medical Center is long, legendary, and formidable beginning in 1977. The tone of President Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address was somber—it was 1865 and hundreds of thousands of lives had been lost in the Civil War. Remarkably, his address is not remembered for its dismal tone, but for the message of healing and hope in its conclusion. His promise “to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan” is recognized today as the mission statement for the Department of Veterans Affairs and serves as an inspiration to countless veterans and those who serve them at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). Duke Anesthesiology is proud to have played a vital role in accomplishing this mission for more than 30 years. Although united by a common Veterans Affairs (VA) mission, there is much to distinguish the Durham VAMC. Many attribute the success of the VA Anesthesiology Service to the historically strong emphasis on faculty recruitment, which began with Duke Anesthesiology’s first VAMC chief, Stanley W. Weitzner, MD. Even after the Duke Department of Anesthesiology was formed, anesthesia services at the VA remained under the Department of Surgery. Dr. Weitzner was given the formidable task of establishing a separate VAMC Anesthesiology Service. “This was a radical concept in 1978,” Dr. Weitzner reflects, “we were the fourth VAMC in the entire country to succeed in this endeavor.” That was a remarkable effort made by a remarkable team. Dr. Weitzner left a deep imprint on the world of Medicine and Science, and an even deeper imprint on the hearts of those he knew and loved, particularly the members of his family.\n\nDallas Lowdermilk, passed away on Friday, December 20, 2019 at the age of 90 years. Dallas was the son of Jennie and Dallas Lowdermilk, born October 23, 1929 in Norman, North Carolina. He served in the US Navy during the Korean War and retired from Duke University as Plant Manager, Telecommunications after sharing thirty-two years of life with his Duke family. He was a member of the Civitan’s Club and a regular attendee at Duke Basketball games for nearly forty years. Dallas’s children and grandchildren were the pride and joy of his life. The legacy of his kind spirit, sense of humor, generosity, hopeful attitude, love of sports and reading will live on through them.

He was 77 years young. Joseph taught at Duke University for nearly four decades receiving acclaim for the fiction he wrote under the name Joe Ashby Porter. Joseph arrived at Duke in 1980, teaching generations of Duke students before his retirement in the spring of 2019. He taught in the English and Theater Studies Departments and became a particularly important part of the university’s creative writing program. Joe was a vital part of both the undergraduate and graduate programs, and helped teach and inspire many, many students. Joe’s literary legacy is ensured not simply through his own fiction, but also through his impact on multiple generations of creative writers who refined their skills in the English department. Joseph was born in Kentucky, where his father worked as a machinist and coal miner. He studied at Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley and taught at the University of Virginia and other institutions before arriving at Duke University. He authored four short story collections and three novels, “Eelgrass,” “Resident Aliens” and “The Near Future.” His fictional works received wide recognition, including two Pulitzer Prize nominations and a 2004 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (since renamed as the Arts and Letters Award in Literature). A noted Shakespeare scholar, Joseph published two books about Shakespeare and edited many collections. He also loved France and French literature and served as a visiting professor at the Université François-Rabelais in Tours, France. In a review of his 2006 novel “The Near Future,” a New York Times critic lauded Porter’s inventive fiction: “Sweet and fey, Joe Ashby Porter’s new novel describes a world many readers contemplating their twilight years will want to inhabit. Porter’s narrative style is vaguely cubist, with words often turned at slight angles to one another. But what the occasional sentence loses in textbook syntax it gains in color and sheer playfulness.” Porter passed away after suffering for several months from an aggressive form of cancer. He is survived by his husband of 50 years, Yves Orvoen.\n\nIrene Smith White, was born on December 29, 1935 and passed away on Saturday, December 14, 2019 at the age of 83 years.

A legacy is etched into the minds of others and the stories they share about you, carve your name on hearts, not tombstones.\n\nStephen A. Wainwright, a renowned Duke University biologist who applied engineering principals to understand organismal design, and who explored life through art, died Thursday, December 12, 2019 in Durham, North Carolina at the age of 88. The cause was Parkinson's dementia. Steve was born in Indianapolis, the youngest of three sons (brothers William and Thomas) to Guy and Jeanette Wainwright. The family owned and operated Diamond Chain, an early assembly-line company that built chains for bicycles and other machines. Diamond chains were featured in the Wright Brothers' first airplane and in Henry Ford's first automobiles, early inspiration for Steve. His parents allowed each brother an \"office\", a blank room in which they could freely explore budding interests. Steve filled his room with specimens of animals and plants as well as his own art and writing; flickers of the flames destined to become major themes for the future multifaceted academic. A lifelong scholar, Steve graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Duke University in 1953, then studied at University of Hawaii and Cambridge University before earning a Ph.D. in 1962 from University of California, Berkeley. He pursued postdoctoral work at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In 1964, he returned to Duke as a faculty member, beginning a thirty-two year run as a visionary scientist, beloved mentor, and sartorial savant. Steve was an early founder of the field of biomechanics, which applies principles of mechanical engineering to understand how animals and plants are built to accomplish daily tasks. In 1986, he co-authored Mechanical Design in Organisms, a landmark book that established the fledgling field and is still widely used today. In his research, Steve sought the general principles of organismal design, while drawing on subjects from across the tree of life, including sea fans, reef corals, sharkskin, marlin backbones, whale blubber, anemone tentacles, coconut palms and rubbery seaweeds. Steve's greatest professional passion, however, was reserved for his students. He reveled in inspiring young minds and nurturing emerging careers. With a flair for outrageous color in his dress and relentless joy in the wonders of nature, he was always eager to encourage the individual to imagine the possibilities. He leaves behind an extensive legacy of former students who now carry the field of biomechanics into new realms. Amidst the years of schooling, Steve also found time to fall in love. He met Ruth while studying at University of Hawaii where they were married in colorful Aloha shirts. They raised four children in Durham, North Carolina; Peter, Ian, Archie (deceased) and Jennifer in a household rich with art, university life, and summer research expeditions to Fanning Island, the Florida Keys and Fiji. The family eventually grew with the births of ten grandchildren (Dylan, Naomi, Yoshio, Savannah, Joshua, Ruth, Hope, Emma Caudle, Holly Caudle and Gwen Caudle). Ruth passed away in 1999 and Steve married the prominent ceramic artist, Sally Prange, until her death in 2007. Never one to allow life's tragedies to stop him, he fell in love again and in 2008 married Charlotte Vestal Brown, the founding director of the Gregg Museum of Art and Design at North Carolina State University and who shared Steve's ever-deepening love of art. In 1990, Steve created the Duke Bio-Design Studio, where researchers worked with skilled artists to build physical models of biological structures. This highly successful venture eventually became an independent company, Nekton, that built machines based on biologically inspired mechanisms such as swimming fish. This concept – to use devices found in nature as the basis for novel tools and machines – presaged yet another young discipline, known today as biologically inspired design, and Nekton became a model and resource for similar ventures. His interest in art continued to flourish and after his retirement in 1996 Steve became a devoted sculptor, drawing on insights earned studying creatures to carve wood into flowing works of art that captured the essence of the life forms he once researched. He also established a series of nonprofits that brought his passion for science and art to a wider community. The Center for Inquiry-Based Learning helps North Carolina K-8 teachers \"nurture that natural excitement children have for doing science\". SeaSaw Studio was a free after-school program for young artists that taught entrepreneurial skills to local teens. In all of these ventures, he sought to encourage both critical and creative abilities and to give life to youthful interest. Steve's early delight in animals never relented and even in his final days, he could be sparked by the sight of birds feeding at his window. Stephen spent nearly fifty years with Duke serving as a Professor Emeritus Biology, Zoology. All who knew and valued his passions will miss his presence.\n\nLinda Hanmer, born June 19, 1948 passed away on Wednesday, December 11, 2019. She was a young 71 years of age.

He put off college to join the Navy during World War II serving as a Pharmacist's Mate 3rd Class from 1945-1947.

He taught at Harvard Medical School and served as the Associate Director of Hematology at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston.

Central Office in Washington, D.C. as Director Medical Research Service. He served both V.A. HQ and the UF until moving to Texas in 1978. While in Washington and for years afterwards Dr. Newcomb testified numerous times before Congress advocating for hospital and research budgets targeted for Veteran's health care regardless of service connection. Board Certified in four states in Internal Medicine, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Dr. Newcomb practiced medicine for over sixty-three years. Following patients for decades, he published over 25 medical research articles. His research and practice is now complete, but thanks to the Duke University Anatomical Gifts Program, he will receive his final wish, self-prescribed in 2007, posthumously continuing to teach by donating his body for training the next generation of medical professionals.
