        "text": "THE HA-HA by Dave King: Howard Kapostash is the most damaged, endearing and memorable character to haunt my dreams in a very long time. Howard is a Vietnam vet with a brain injury that has left him uncommunicative – he can’t speak, he can’t write, and reading is very difficult at best. Yet, as the cards he carries with him explain, he is of normal intelligence. Howard lives in a house that he has inherited from his parents, and he rents out a few rooms to a couple of house painters and a soup chef who also uses the kitchen for her business. The four of them live together yet they all live in their own separate worlds. But when Howard’s high school sweetheart has to go into drug rehab, she dumps her nine year old son Ryan on him, claiming she has no one else to take care of the boy. At first Ryan is uncommunicative too, but slowly he becomes the impetus for all the people living in the house to come together and form a new kind of family. More importantly, Howard learns that there can be more to a damaged life than he ever dreamed possible. King has created a legacy with his eloquent, sparse prose and his unforgettable characters. 03/05\n\nTHE HA-HA by Dave King: It’s not fair that The Ha-Ha is Dave King’s first novel. It’s extraordinary; well-written, brilliantly conceived, sympathetic without ever getting near cloying. The protagonist is someone who, if the author were less skilled, might evoke pity. But this book works, and works well. It tells the story of a man who has lost almost all ability to communicate. After spending only a couple weeks in Vietnam years ago, Howard Kapostash was severely brain-injured and has spent his time since in a peculiar world. He does not speak, lacks the ability to use alternatives such as writing or signing, and has major trouble reading. He’s clearly been traumatized and may have some other concomitant psychological problems; who wouldn’t? But he’s a smart man, a caring man, when he can be. There’s nothing wrong with the guy’s intelligence. He’s spent a good part of his life maintaining huge barricades against emotional involvement, also with understandable reasons.\n\nAll my gripes about the ending are minor; this is a fluid story, a stunning debut from someone who so totally grasps the issues his protagonist lives with. Howard is 100 percent real to me. There’s sympathy but no pathos, realism without any tirades about how crappy our disabled veterans are treated. This is a powerhouse of a book and it needs to be read. 08/05 ~This review contributed by Andi Shechter.\n\nTHE HADES PROJECT by Lynn Sholes & Joe Moore: Well written but derivative religious icon thriller featuring the Holy Lance used to pierce the side of Christ at the Crucifixion. Allegedly forged by the seventh generation grandson of Adam, the Lance has been possessed by powerful men – both good and evil – until the present time. Now the Forces of Evil intend to use the ancient relic to launch the Hades Project and bring humankind to its knees. SSN reporter Cotten Stone is drawn into the fray when her best friend from high school Lindsay calls her concerned about Lindsay’s daughter, Tera. When Cotton returns to Kentucky Lindsay and Tera have both disappeared leaving behind some very disturbing evidence. Cotton calls in her friend, Cardinal John Tyler, for help. Now it’s up to Cotten Stone to save the world and confront the man who holds in his hand our destiny, a man who died more than 85 years earlier. You can blame it all on The Davinci Code. 11/07 Jack Quick\n\nHAIKU by Andrew Vachss: In his first post-Burke book, Vachss (Another Life) pens the story of a ragtag band of homeless men living on the streets of a cold, unnamed city. Ho is an elderly sensei who walked away from a successful life as a martial arts instructor after the death of one of his students, and the band includes damaged veteran Ranger, degenerate gambler Michael, ex-con and ex-gang leader Lamont, the mentally ill Target, and Brewster. Ho leads them around the city, scrounging for money, food, and shelter. One night a woman in a Rolls Royce dumps something in the river, and they decide to try to identify what it is and blackmail her. But that plot is soon forgotten in favor of a story line about the demolition of the abandoned building that houses Brewster’s pulp fiction collection. Lots of description and character development slow the pace of this bleak look at living on the street, and the story just meanders along without ever really getting anywhere. Fans of the grittier Burke series may miss the rapid pace and violence they’ve come to expect. 11/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch. Copyright © 2009 Cahners Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. Reprinted with permission.\n\nHAIKU by Andrew Vachss: I had enjoyed every one of the Burke books penned by Vachss, and was hoping for the best with this new series. Unfortunately, it just didn’t take for me. The characters are interesting – Ho, an elderly martial arts teacher who once was the master of a successful dojo; Michael, once a high-flying stockbroker; Ranger, a Vietnam war vet; Lamont, an ex-gang leader and poet; Brewster, a psychotic; and Target, who speaks only in repetitive verbal explosions. It starts with a mysterious white Rolls Royce and then morphs into another plot concerning Brewster’s book collection. I won’t give up, but definitely not a good start. 12/09 Jack Quick .\n\nHALF PRICE HOMICIDE by Elaine Viets: Helen Hawthorne has a new dead-end job working at a high end designer consignment shop. Wealthy women come in to sell their clothes and pocket the cash, but one woman is caught and confronted by her husband. They disappear to the dressing room to continue their argument until he storms out. But when Helen goes back there, she finds the woman with her head bashed in by a decorative pineapple, and hung by a designer scarf. Another job, another body in this series that somehow manages to combine real humor with real tragedy. Meanwhile, Helen’s fiancé insists on taking Helen home to St. Louis to get her legal troubles straightened out. To complicate things further, Helen’s ex-husband shows up trying to shake her down for more money again. Lots of plot twists and lots of laughs in this latest installment in the Dead-End Job series. 07/10 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHALFWAY TO THE GRAVE by Jeaniene Frost: Half vampire and half human, Cat Crawfield is the result of an attack on her mother by a recently turned vampire who retained a few specific human traits. Cat spends her leisure time trolling clubs and bars for vamps, playing the innocent coed, and luring them to remote places. One such evening almost lands her in trouble when she targets the wrong man. Bones, a vamp who kills his own kind, strikes a deal with Cat. In exchange for her help, he promises to find her father. Bones has been stalking a very powerful vampire who has been responsible for a kidnapping ring that has been around for decades. Recently, the kidnappings seem to have spiked in the Ohio area and Bones is determined to finally stop it. Problem is, vampires can easily detect one another. Cat, with her mixed heritage, is able to sneak amongst them without being discovered, thereby making her the perfect partner for Bones’s plan. Balancing her new hobby with her everyday life is becoming more and more difficult, however, and things are further complicated when Cat finds herself extremely attracted to this mysterious vamp. Frost’s debut is a perfect blend of romance and action. This spunky heroine and her leading man make a great team and I hope to see much more of them in the future. 11/07 Becky Lejeune\n\nTHE HALO EFFECT by M.J. Rose: Once you pick up this book, don’t plan on putting it down – you get hooked on page one when a mutilated body in a nun’s habit is found. A serial killer is on the loose in New York City and he’s going after prostitutes with a vengeance – a religious fervor, you might say. Dr. Morgan Snow is a sex therapist with a client, a top shelf call girl (at $2000 and up a pop) named Cleo Thane, who goes missing. Meanwhile Detective Noah Jordain is heading up the serial killer investigation for the NYPD and calls on Dr. Snow for some outside psychological profiling. They trade info and join forces to try and find the missing Cleo and the serial killer. Rose writes erotic better than just about anyone and with the twisting plotline and surprise ending here, apparently she can do thrillers just as well as the big boys. This is the first book of a new series and I can’t wait for the next one!\n\nTHE HALO EFFECT by M. J. Rose: The Butterfield Institute is a Manhattan sex therapy clinic and employer of psychiatrist Dr. Morgan Snow. A patient, Cleo Thane, is a successful and selective call girl who has written a memoir which includes thinly disguised portraits of many of her clients. She leaves the manuscript with Dr. Snow and then disappears. In the meantime, NYPD Detective Noah Jordain and his team are investigating a series of gory, ritualistic murders of prostitutes. Snow and Jordain are drawn to each other, but she can’t persuade him that Thane may be a victim. In a desperate attempt to find Thane, Snow goes undercover and meets some of Thane’s principal clients herself. Could be subtitled, “A Catalogue of Sexual Dysfunctions and Obscure Perversions,” but, so long as graphic sex doesn’t dissuade you, it’s a pretty interesting read. As the South Alabama judge said at the obscenity trial, “I don’t know what’s pornographic, but I know what I like.” 06/07 Jack Quick\n\nTHE HAMMER OF GOD by Tom Avitabile: How do you fight an enemy that only wants to kill us and is not subject to reason or logical persuasion? Simple – you go after them with any means at your disposal and don’t worry about the bleeding hearts that feel they must teach an implacable enemy that it is best to discuss differences and resolve them peacefully. Several major authors have written books about individuals or groups that do just that and get the job done in any manner possible. In all probability many readers concur with this approach and know that the only way to fight terrorist groups is to eradicate them. Tom Avitabile has created such an entity called the Quarterback Ops group which is headed by Bill Hiccock and reports only to the President of the United States. This is the second of these books, with a third currently being prepared. A group of terrorists is engaged in a plot to bring in nuclear weapons hidden in cold cream jars to the United States for the sole purpose of exploding them to kill as many people as possible. The Quarterback Ops Group is charged with stopping them and utilizes every means possible to go after the terrorists and stop them before they have a chance to wreak the havoc they plan. The plot is fascinating, the writing crisp and engrossing. Avitabile combines brute force where needed with scientific investigation in arriving at solutions. It is impossible to put the book down once into the action. A very complicated, but well explained area of mathematics and science is utilized in providing answers. Bill Hiccock and his team are fleshed out and handle their areas of expertise very well in order to arrive at necessary ends. Well done and insuring that the reader will grab book three as soon as available. 6/12 Paul Lane\n\nHANGING BY A THREAD by Sophie Littlefield: Clare has a keen eye for fashion and a talent for making vintage clothes into something completely new and original. She’s even started to sell her pieces to the locals in Winston. But Clare also has a unique ability that sets her apart from everyone else: with just a touch, Clare can read fabric. She can see things the wearers have done and feel their every emotion. Though she’s tried to suppress the ability and hide it from others, she is often unable. Such is the case when she comes across a beat up couture jacket found at a yard sale. The vision she has upon touching the jacket is so completely overwhelming that Clare becomes convinced she must learn what happened to the owner. But then Clare discovers that the person in question is actually a local girl who’s been missing for the past year. Clare knows something terrible happened to her and knows that she may be the only one who can figure out the truth. Littlefield’s latest is a bit of a different twist on the psychic powers spectrum. The mystery is interesting but my expectations, based on Littlefield’s previous works, was pretty high and somehow Hanging By a Thread just didn’t quite meet them. I blame it on the characters and the fact that they all seemed to flip flop between pages – changing opinions and personalities at the drop of a hat. Hanging was fun but not one of my favorites. 9/12 Becky Lejeune\n\nHANGING HILL by Mo Hayder: Although sisters Sally and Zoey live in the same town, they haven’t spoken to each other in ages. An incident when they were kids ended with them being sent to separate schools and a secret in the family’s past caused a rift that has never healed. Today, Sally is trying to put her life back together after a divorce that left her virtually penniless. Raising a teen on her own and facing mountains of debt, an interesting opportunity arises when she is offered a job working for a wealthy local with a questionable past. Meanwhile, Zoey, a Detective Inspector with the Bath police, has worked hard to get where she is, but at the expense of relationships and human connection. When a local teen is brutally murdered, the sisters find themselves reunited and forced to face the demons they’ve long been avoiding. Brilliant. Hayder’s latest is an excellent mystery and thriller with dark and surprising twists, proving once again that she is simply one of the best of the genre. Hanging Hill is out now in the UK. 05/11 Becky Lejeune\n\nTHE HANGING VALLEY by Peter Robinson: In this fourth outing for Chief Inspector Alan Banks, a rotting corpse is identified by dental work and a receipt found in the trousers pocket of the murder victim as Bernard Allen, a local youth on a visit home from Canada. The investigation leads back five years to the unsolved murder of a Private Investigator hunting for a young girl’s killer and the nearly simultaneous disappearance of a village woman. Banks ends up traveling to Canada as part of his journey through a maze of passion and possible blackmail before finding the solution in long-kept secrets. Pour yourself a pint, light up a Silk Cut and join us as we make England a safer place. A really, really good police procedural series. 10/06 Jack Quick\n\nHANGMAN BLIND by Cassandra Clark: After the death of her husband, Hildegard devotes her life to the church, and is now an abbess with the goal of starting her own small abbey. On her way to speak to the local abbot, Hildegard discovers a young man murdered in the woods. She does her duty and makes her report to the abbot’s men, also helping to recover the body. Then, with the gruesome discovery behind her, and with the abbot’s blessing, Hildegard continues on to the next part of her journey: an attempt to now secure a home for her venture. Fortunately her destination, Castle Hutton, is a familiar place for Hildegard and it’s master, Lord Roger de Hutton, a longtime friend of hers. But when Roger is poisoned and almost killed, Hildegard finds herself in the position of having to unmask the would-be murderer. While Hangman Blind neatly sets up readers for the next installment of the series, the conclusion of the two mysteries is a little too neatly wrapped up. The body in the woods is the more interesting of the two parts, but takes a backseat to the Hutton family/political intrigue. This is also a read that requires a bit of concentration if one is not familiar with the history of the time period and the hierarchy of the church: one look away, and you will find yourself lost. 11/09 Becky Lejeune\n\nHAPPILY EVER AFTER by Harriet Evans: For Eleanor Bee a job in publishing is an absolute dream come true. She’s hired on at Bluebird, one of the last independents, and embarks on the career of a lifetime… working with romance novels. Eleanor isn’t sure she believes in a happy ending herself. In fact, while they make for fun reading, she’s almost convinced the same could never happen to her. As her career progresses, Elle moves on to New York and becomes head of her own division, but true love still has not crossed her path. Can a girl really have it all in this day and age? Will she ever be swept off her feet and find Mr. Right? Elle’s story starts off well enough, fun and funny with just the right amount of snark and sarcasm. About midway the book just kind of fizzles. In fact, even just twenty pages from the end I thought there was no way the book would come to any sort of satisfying conclusion. It did, in part, but I wish Evans had been able to maintain the momentum throughout. Overall a good summer read but not one that blew me away by any means. 6/12 Becky Lejeune\n\nHAPPY HOUR OF THE DAMNED by Mark Henry: Amanda Feral may be new to Seattle’s supernatural scene, but the smart and stylish ghoul is not about to let a little thing like death stand in her way or slow her down. In fact, one night into her new gig and she’s already breaking and entering at a mortuary in search of decent cover-up. Plus, she may no longer be able to stomach Starbucks coffee, but it’s something of a relief to learn that even abovegrounders can still hold their alcohol. Course the taste for human flesh is a little less trendy, but Amanda’s even worked out a way to keep the blood off her designer duds. And when she learns that one of her fellow paranormal friends might be in trouble, she immediately sets out to help. But Amanda and her friends may be way over their heads when it starts to look as though a zombie outbreak is in the works. Mark Henry’s twisted and dirty humor makes for great Seattle underworld fun. Definitely not suitable for readers without a strong stomach, but for those of us who are blessed with such, Mark Henry delivers combination laugh-out-loud and cringe-worthy scenes that truly entertain. 01/10 Becky Lejeune\n\nHARBOR NOCTURNE by Joseph Wambaugh: When Dinko Babich, a young longshoreman, delivers Lita Medina, a young Mexican dancer, from the harbor to a Hollywood nightclub, their lives are forever changed. Their paths cross with many of the colorful characters introduced in Wambaugh’s acclaimed best-selling Hollywood Station series: the surfer cops know as “Flotsam and Jetsam,” aspiring actor “Hollywood Nate” Weiss, young Britney Small, along with new members of the midwatch. Written with Wambaugh’s unflinching eye for detail and spot-on humor, this is a good one. 12/11 Jack Quick\n\nHard As Nails by Dan Simmons: This is a hard-nosed mystery story set in Buffalo, New York and I recommend it without any reservations. Could any town be more appropriate for a tough guy than Buffalo? [Editor’s note: the reviewer is from Buffalo.] And make no mistake about it, Kurtz, the hero, is a tough guy. After seeing all of the references in Ilium, I have to believe that the invocation of Conrad’s character is no accident, as well as a tip of the hat to the ethnic stew that is the best part of the fading Queen City of the Great Lakes.\n\nIn previous books in this series, Kurtz has been to Attica, courtesy of the State of New York, for throwing his partner’s killer off a rooftop. He is still on parole, which makes it impossible for him to return officially to his old private eye business. As this book opens, Kurtz and his parole officer are walking into a parking garage when all hell breaks loose. The ride has started and it is exciting as the old wooden roller coaster at Crystal Beach amusement park which Kurtz points out is now defunct.\n\nThe story finds Kurtz in the middle of a power struggle between the remnants of two old Mob families for the drug trade in the region, as well as fending off members of the Aryan Brotherhood he offended while in the slammer. The story climaxes in a small company town bearing a strong resemblance to the Coudersport of the Rigas family. And in this case, the roller coaster is filled with bodies.\n\nThis is the book I am sending to friends for Christmas with a note, saying “I found him first.” ~This review contributed by Geoffrey R. Hamlin.\n\nHARD AS NAILS by Dan Simmons: Same war, next generation. The Farino and Gonzaga crime families continue to fight over Buffalo and on killing Joe Kurtz. Neither family trusts the other and each fears that Kurtz is working for the other side. Both sides eventually hire him to find a killer who has been taking out their low-level drug dealers. In addition, Joe and his parole officer get shot in the head in an ambush at her office. What events are related? Who is on which side? Is there anyone Joe can trust? Add the newspapers and the police and you have a fine stew. To survive all this you had better be hard as nails. 09/05 ~This review contributed by Jack Quick.\n\nHARD CURRENCY by Stuart Kaminsky: In the ninth Inspector Rostnikov novel, our hero is sent from Moscow to Cuba to solve a sensitive murder case. He takes along his assistant Elana leaving Karpo, “The Vampire” to track down a brutal serial killer in Moscow. Since the good Inspector is an avid fan of Ed McBain I thought it appropriate to share McBain’s own blurb about this one – “In Hard Currency, Stuart Kaminsky gets Russia right, and Cuba right, but best of all he gets his superb cop Rostnikov altogether right yet another time. Bravo. ” Kind of hard to add anything to that. 03/08 Jack Quick\n\nHard Eight by Janet Evanovich: Another delicious adventure featuring Stephanie Plum et al, with the usual dead body, exploding cars, with just a hint of hot sex. This time Stephanie has to find her Grandma’s next door neighbor’s missing daughter & granddaughter with nastier-than-usual bad guys on her case. Kudos to Evanovich for keeping this series amazingly fresh. A special holiday treat: the next adventure, Visions of Sugar Plums, comes out November 5!\n\nHard Feelings by Jason Starr: This is a perfect pitch Jim Thompson-esque noir novel set in modern Manhattan. Our dubious hero has a lot of problems – – a sales slump at his job, a worrisome wife and a pesky pooch among them, but his life is manageable until he bumps into an old Brooklyn neighbor at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-eighth Street. The downward spiral that results takes only a few weeks and it is told in taut prose that keeps you turning the pages all night. HARD FEELINGS gets under your skin. Well written, well executed and well worth your time. PS: Interesting note – – the Black Lizard Crime series has some of the greatest noir novels of all time. Reasonably priced, lots of great authors – – definitely worth checking out, published by Vintage Crime/Black Lizard books. ~This review contributed by Ann Nappa\n\nHARD FEELINGS by Jason Starr: Richie Segal doesn’t feel so good. First there is the job. His career as a computer systems salesman isn’t going anywhere – literally, he hasn’t closed a single sale in the six months he has been in his current job. Then there is the marriage. He suspects his wife is cheating on him, again. What not? She has just gotten a big promotion so she is the primary breadwinner, although there is the little matter of possible morning sickness. Is she pregnant? Is that why she so adamantly scolded him about “moving to the burbs and having a family?” Finally, there is Michael Rudnick, a prosperous lawyer, who had taken advantage of Richie when the two boys were neighbors growing up. All this is leading Richie back to drinking – and he can’t hold his liquor. Count on Starr to put you down and then apply a solid kick to the ribs. First rate is you are a fan of noir. 09/08 Jack Quick\n\nHARD FREEZE by Dan Simmons: Buffalo, New York ex-con and former P.I. Joe Kurtz survived his initial case after a twelve-year prison term. Now he is taking on a new challenge. While continuing to dodge a contract on his head, Kurtz takes on the task of finding a child-murderer for a gravely ill client. It’s going to be a tough winter in Buffalo – cold enough to freeze the blood. Joe continues to be in the middle between the Farino and Gonzaga crime families and his efforts to avoid being killed by them actually lead to the solution of his new case. This series is as cold as the Buffalo winters and hard as the ice that forms around Niagara Falls in January. 09/05 ~This review contributed by Jack Quick.\n\nHARD TARGET by Howard Gordon: Gideon Davis and his brother, Tillman, are not great fans of the current government. In spite of their experiences, they remain loyal to their country. So when a meth-head informant approaches Gideon and alerts him to a grand-scale plot to take down those in charge, Gideon brings his information to the authorities. Unfortunately they aren’t interested in what Gideon has to say. But Gideon and Tillman possess exactly the skills one would need to take down a terrorist plot all on their own and that’s exactly what they plan to do. Though there are few surprises to the plot, Gordon, a producer on 24 and the new show Awake, has put together a fun and fast-paced thriller. This is the second book by Gordon to feature Gideon and Tillman, though newcomers will have no problem dropping in without having read Gideon’s War. 3/12 Becky Lejeune\n\nHARD TARGET by Alan Jacobson: An explosion pulverizes the president-elect’s helicopter on Election Night. Department of Defense covert operative Hector DeSantos and FBI Agent Aaron “Uzi” Uziel must sort out who is behind the bombings, and they need a solution in just nine days. Touted by both Vince Flynn and Lee Child, I agree this is a well-written thriller that will keep you on edge all the way through. Dangers from within can be more deadly than those threats from outside. Note: Hard Target also features Jacobson’s famed FBI Profiler, Karen Vail, in a key role affecting national security. Recommended. 9/12 Jack Quick\n\nTHE HARD WAY by Lee Child: This is one of my favorite series for pure escapist fiction. The tenth Jack Reacher thriller begins while he’s enjoying an espresso in a sidewalk cafe in New York City. He is approached by a man, obviously ex-military; that is, to Jack it’s obvious as he is an ex-Army MP and extremely observant. That observing nature gets him involved in helping to solve a kidnapping for the very mysterious Edward Lane and his band of disreputable mercenaries, but nothing is quite as it seems. Fast paced as always with some nice twists, this is another exciting adventure for the hero that all women want and all men want to be. 06/06 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nTHE HARD WAY by Lee Child: In Child’s 10th Jack Reacher novel, Reacher agrees to help sinister ex-army officer Edward Lane track down his kidnapped daughter and trophy wife. Since the kidnapping of wife number one five years earlier ended in her death, Lane cautions Reacher that he will not tolerate police interference. Child’s excellent descriptions on Manhattan add to the sinister quality of the story, which is a page-turner all the way to the inevitable showdown, on a farm outside a tiny English village. 06/06 Jack Quick\n\nHARDBALL by Sara Paretsky: The 13th novel to feature gutsy PI V.I. Warshawski, last seen in 2005’s Fire Sale, has our intrepid P.I. looking for a black man who disappeared during the racial turmoil of 1967. In her search for Lamond Gadsden, Vic reconnects with some of her policeman father’s old pals as well as crooks on both sides of the law with whom she herself has a history. The path leads to a murder conviction (for the death of Harmony Newsome a young black woman from Atlanta in Chicago for the civil rights protests) that may have been tainted. Back in the current era, the apparent kidnapping of Vic’s fresh-out-of-college cousin, Petra, who’s come to Chicago to work on a senatorial campaign, makes solving the problem even more critical. Nicely done. 11/09 Jack Quick\n\nHARDCASE by Dan Simmons: Joe Kurtz is not one to mess with. So when a drug dealing thug that killed his girlfriend, the ex-PI returns the favor and gets 11 years in Attica. It’s there that he meets “Little Skag” Farino, the son of an aging Buffalo, New York mob boss. In exchange for protecting the kid’s manhood against any unwanted jailhouse affection, Kurtz gets an audience with Little Skag’s father upon his release from prison. Byron Farino is still clinging to what dwindling power he holds on the New York organized crime scene. He enlists Kurtz’s help to track down the Family’s missing accountant–a man with too much knowledge of Family business to have on the loose. But someone doesn’t want the accountant found. As the story twists and turns and the body count rises, Kurtz no longer knows who he can trust. Everyone seems to be after something, from the mob boss’s sultry yet dangerous daughter, to a hit man named The Dane, an albino killer who is good with a knife, and a dwarf who is armed to the teeth and hell-bent on revenge. About as gritty as it gets. 2/12 Jack Quick\n\nHARDLY KNEW HER by Laura Lippman: Laura Lippman has long been a favorite of the mystery genre – readers and fellow writers sing her praises alike. Their appreciation is well deserved and this collection of twisted tales is a great place for new readers to familiarize themselves with her talent. Three of the tales feature Baltimore PI Tess Monaghan. There is also a novella, Scratch a Woman, which features a recurring character from “One True Love.” Each story features a strong, manipulative, or even murderous woman. In the title story, “Hardly Knew Her,” a daughter has her revenge against her gambling father. A Mardi Gras reveler gets a little surprise when he follows two girls in “Pony Girl,” and in “Black Eyed Susan” a young boy discovers some of the strange folks drawn to Baltimore’s Preakness. A great collection of darkly humorous and slightly disturbing tales from one of the biggest talents in the genre. 10/08 Becky Lejeune\n\nHARK! by Ed McBain: The first crime novelist that I ever read was Ed McBain. My Mother gave me one of her dog-ear’d paperbacks, and told me… “You’ll like this…” I did… That’s why it kind of pains me to review this,\n\nI wish it went better. Led by Carella, and the gang, the 87Th precinct has always been the place to go to learn the ways of the Police procedural. All the boys usually worked in concert, to solve the gig. Here’s a brief synopsis…the Deaf Man is back. He kills a broad who crossed him, and of course, the 87Th gets the squawk…\n\nInitially, nothing seems to be there, but the DEAF man starts sending Carella, and the rest of the detectives letters, delivered by various couriers. Meanwhile, the Deaf Man has enlisted the help of a very opportunistic hooker, to further his cause. They become a symbiotic relationship…..Right here, He should have stopped, and went on with the mayhem. Instead, what he did was get a bunch of non-needed subplots involved, and made this all a literary game, i.e.: axioms, palindromes, oxymoron’s, any type of literary subterfuge he could think of was involved here. Personally, I don’t like to have to read when I’m reading. With that being said, it gets good towards the end. Keep your eye on the enterprising hooker. 01/06 DOC\n\nHAROLD ROBBIN’S THE DECEIVERS by Junius Podrug: The very first book I ever read in galley proof was The Carpetbaggers by Harold Robbins, back in the mid 60’s. Since Robbins’ death in 1977, his estate has tried to continue the legacy with books like this one, supposedly20completed by Podrug from notes left by Robbins. It’s kind of like delivery pizza, not that bad, not that good. Basically it’s the story of disgraced New York City art expert Madison Dupre struggling to get by with a freelance business, who ends up in Cambodia tracking art smugglers. With references to Phnom Penh as the “pit stop before hell,” and that Buddhism’s Noble Eightfold Path to enlightenment apparently permitted “endless varieties of illicit sex, some of which involved young girls who should have been in classrooms rather than backrooms” and where “household pets even got into the act.” All in the first chapter which ends in a whorehouse, well you have been forewarned. There is enough of a story to tie it all together, but basically it’s a rather tawdry romp through sexual adventure land. 11/08 Jack Quick\n\nTHE HARROWING by Alexandra Sokoloff: It is Thanksgiving break at Baird College and everyone is returning home for the holiday. Everyone, that is, but five misfits in Mendenhall dorm. They are a jock, a brain, a loner, a musician and a phony. These five have one thing in common though – each one of them feels like they don’t belong. When the teens discover an old Ouija board in the common room, they awaken a new entity in Mendenhall. This ghost calls itself Zachary and is all at once charming and terrifying. Who is Zachary and what does he want? As the teens dig deeper into this mystery they come to realize that Zachary is not what he seems. Alexandra Sokoloff’s debut is a hauntingly original and eerie spin on the standard ghost story. I think Sokoloff is a fresh new voice in the genre and sincerely hope to see more from her in the future. I highly recommend this book; it’s a perfect rainy day read. 09/06 Becky LeJeune\n\nHATER by David Moody: It begins with seemingly random attacks—a bar fight that gets out of control here, a fight in the streets there—seemingly normal occurrences in a crowded and populous area. Danny McCoyne witnesses one of the first on his way to work: a man chases and attacks an older woman, beating her to death before authorities can stop him. Just a few days later, while eating in a pub, Danny and his wife witness yet another fight. It builds so slowly that the public almost isn’t aware. Then it explodes. They say that only ten percent of the population is affected, but those who are turn on a dime. One minute they’re fine, the next they get this look in their eyes and they’re off in a fit of rage. Families have locked themselves away in their homes, afraid of turning on one another. Even the slightest hint that someone might become a “Hater” can have terrible results. Before long it’s unclear who “they” are anymore as “Haters” and suspected “Haters” come under attack themselves. Hater is a dark and brutal viral apocalypse tale, and the first in a projected trilogy. It’s a quick and shocking train-wreck of a read and definitely a new twist in horror. This first has already been optioned for film (Guillermo del Toro’s production team has purchased the rights). 06/10 Becky Lejeune\n\nHAUNTED by Kelly Armstrong: Smart-mouthed Eve Levine may be dead but as a witch she can still raise hell in the hereafter. The Fates, three elusive sisters, are the rulers of this new dimension, and they have a job for Eve. If she can defeat a demonic Nix who’s inducing people in the human realm to kill, she’ll earn her wings—literally. The catch is she can’t capture the Nix without the powers that angelhood affords. Following the action in the ever changing netherworld can be a hassle but, if you are looking for spunk, sass and strong-arm savvy, Eve is your lady. 03/06 Jack Quick\n\nHAUNTED by James Herbert: Renowned paranormal investigator David Ash has made a career out of debunking supernatural occurrences. It is just this reputation that has earned him a request from the tenants of Edbrook. It seems this stately manor may have some guests from the other side and they want Ash to investigate. Ash is welcomed to the home by Nanny Tess, her lovely niece Christina Mariell, and Christina’s two older brothers, Robert and Simon. On his very first evening in the home, Ash himself has a brush with the ghost of Edbrook. Ash is certain there must be some rational explanation behind the so-called haunting and stubbornly vows to find it before his stay at the home comes to an end. This dogged determination springs from the fact that he himself has a dark secret in his past, one that he might just have to face if life after death does in fact exist. It is my opinion that Herbert has been wrongfully overlooked by American horror fans. This melancholy ghost story is one of three intended tales featuring David Ash and is followed by The Ghosts of Sleath and an as yet unwritten third book. Though this chilling ghost story was originally published almost twenty years ago, it has recently been republished and is readily available to readers once again and can be read without its accompanying title. 11/07 Becky Lejeune\n\nHavana by Stephen Hunter: This is a book for anyone who enjoyed the Walking Tall movies and the tough simplicity of Buford Pusser. Hunter’s protagonist is Earl Swagger, like Pusser, a war hero and a cop who previously cleaned up gangs in a rural community.\n\nHavana is set in the early 1950’s, in the last days of the Big Sugar, I mean Batista, regime. Castro is coming and the effete Ivy League lads of The Company want to eradicate him. They think that sharpshooter Swagger is just the man to do it.\n\nAt the same time, the mob in New York has exiled one of their wayward troops to assist Meyer Lansky in protectng their casino operations in Havana. New York has become too hot for young Frankie who has committed the cardinal sin of whacking a cop’s horse.\n\nThe third ingredient in this mojito is the Russian secret service. They have rehabilitated a zek named Speshnev from the gulag to protect and mentor Castro and thwart Swagger.\n\nIf you like simple stories, simple heroes and believe in simple virtues, you will like this book. I personally think that the world is a much more complicated place. What saved the book for me was the Russian, Speshnev. He is a fascinating character who is two steps ahead of everyone in the game and enjoying life fully along the way. He is the Crash Davis to Castro’s Nuke Laloosh. He saves Swagger’s butt a couple of times and manages to keep Castro out of trouble too.\n\nMy suggestion to Mr. Hunter is that he ditch Swagger (unless he is making a lot of money with these books) and start a new series detailing Speshnev’s adventures throughout the Cold War period. Available 10.07.03. ~This review contributed by Geoffrey R. Hamlin\n\nHAVANA REQUIEM by Paul Goldstein: Stanford law professor Goldstein brings back his alter ego, Michael Seeley, in a new intellectual property law story. Having covered the movie business in his debut, Errors and Omissions (2006,) Goldstein returns to the entertainment industry, but instead of Hollywood, he visits Cuba. Seeley is once again working in his old New York City law firm and takes on a case to get copyrights returned to the original Cuban composers of their “Buena Vista Social Club” type music, which has been enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Reynoso is his new client, and he delivers a list of several other composers who are in the same predicament. Seeley’s job is to convince them all to sign legal documents giving him the authority to go after their music, which puts him in direct conflict with his law firm’s clients, his legal partners, the Cuban government, and eventually the State Department. VERDICT: Plodding pacing and too many under-developed characters belie this book’s legal ‘thriller’ status. Buy for larger fiction collections only. 5/12 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch Copyright © 2012 Library Journal, a division of Media Source Inc. Reprinted with permission.\n\nHAVE MERCY ON US ALL by Fred Vargas: It’s easy to see why Fred Vargas is an international bestseller! In Mercy her first American release, a plague-monger is terrorizing modern-day Paris. Cryptic messages regarding an upcoming outbreak of the “black death” appear in the local town crier’s box. At the same time, an odd symbol appears on doors all over the city. Chief Inspector Adamsberg believes it is nothing more than a coincidence until the first body appears. Adamsberg will no doubt draw comparison to a roguish Columbo. However, this brilliant, if absentminded, inspector brings with him a whole cast of supporting characters who help solve the crime at hand. Insight into Adamsberg’s private life as well as heavy character development, are what makes this an especially fascinating read. This is not a traditional mystery in the sense that the reader is not given all of the clues to solve the mystery but rather follows along as Adamsberg reveals his own deductions. Mercy will leave readers longing for more. The good news is that book two is being released in October, so they won’t have to wait much longer! 09/06 Becky LeJeune\n\nHEAD GAMES by Craig McDonald: Its hard to top what Ken Bruen had to say about this debut outing – “”You’ve got to find what you love and let it kill you.’ Jesus, I’d kill for those lines. This book just took my breath away. I am beyond impressed.” Its 1957 and Senator Prescott Bush (hmmm) wants Pancho Villa’s head. Aging writer Mason Lassiter gets caught in the cross fire between Mexican nationalists and frat boys out to place Villa’s head in Yale’s Skull and Bones Society trophy case. Following the yellow brick road, Lassiter encounters Orson Welles, Marlene Dietrich, Jack Webb and a young National Guardsman named “George W.” along with lines like “it’s a tricky thing, firing for flesh wounds with a machine gun at close range”. Call this one a comedy caper historical fiction road novel with chords of myth, history, loss and redemption, but mostly call it hilariously funny. 11/07 Jack Quick\n\nHEADS YOU LOSE by Lisa Lutz & David Hayward: Mystery fans are in for a treat with this different sort of collaboration from Spellman series author Lisa Lutz and her ex, David Hayward. With Lutz’s beginning chapter to kick things off, the two work together to create a mystery that begins with pot growing siblings discovering a body on their property. Given their choice in career, calling the cops is not an option, but their curiosity about the killing leads to their own investigation, the results of which are a surprise to even the authors. The idea was that each author would alternate chapters, there would be no plotting/outlining, and neither author would make changes to the other’s chapters. What makes this book different is that the reader knows this from the outset and the authors’ comments and notes to each other are included. As the mystery draws to an end, the authors’ snarky arguments become more and more hilarious. Unbelievably, it works: the story is fun and the authors’ notes are even more so. 04/11 Becky Lejeune\n\nHEART OF A KILLER by David Rosenfelt: David Rosenfelt has written nine novels involving his wise cracking attorney Andy Carpenter, all successful and very entertaining. They feature twists and turns in interesting plots. Two actually utilized Golden Retrievers, Rosenfelt’s favorite dogs, as part and parcel of the case that Carpenter was defending. Heart of a Killer is a stand alone novel and one of the most fascinating books I have read in a long time. Jamie Wagner is a young lawyer working for a large law firm and not very excited about the normal prospects of advancement in such firms. His supervisor calls him in suddenly and hands him a pro bono case which is one of the most interesting ideas I’ve come across. Sheryl Harrison is in her sixth year of a thirty year sentence for killing her husband, a crime that she confessed to right away. Her daughter has a damaged heart for which nothing can be done any more, and needs a heart transplant. Sheryl requires an attorney to get the state to allow her to pass her heart to her daughter – in effect via suicide.\n\nJamie takes the case and in pursuing it brings out information which is germane to a situation that the Federal government is currently investigating. A brilliant criminal computer hacker has committed several computer based crimes killing people and threatens more if he is not paid a prodigious amount of money. The hacker is a psychopathic killer and if not stopped will surely accelerate his crimes. Rosenfelt introduces a secondary character that helps Jamie and Sheryl with their case. He is incidentally the police officer that took Sheryl’s confession when he was sent to the scene of the murder and even then had the strong feeling that she could not have committed the crime. He also becomes involved with the government’s pursuit of the computer hacker. Based on Rosenfelt’s fleshing out of this character I think he might reappear in future books. The principal protagonists Jamie and Sheryl are very well done and coupled with a surprise twist at the ending of the book keep the reader absorbed and probably reading far into the night. Excellent idea, very well done and another Rosenfelt triumph. 3/12 Paul Lane\n\nHEART OF A KILLER by David Rosenfelt: Jamie Wagner is a young lawyer flying under the radar at a large firm, when he gets a career making case handed to him as part of the firm’s pro-bono work Sheryl Harrison has served four years of a thirty-year murder sentence for killing her husband, who she claims was abusive. The case is settled—there shouldn’t be anything for Jamie to do—except Sheryl’s fourteen-year-old daughter, Karen, is sick. She has a congenital heart defect and will die without a transplant. Her blood type is rare, making their chances of finding a matching donor remote at best. Sheryl wants to be that donor for her daughter, and Jamie is in way over his head. Suicide, no matter the motive, is illegal. It appears that the only way he can give Sheryl he desire is to somehow get her conviction overturned. A page turner. 6/12 Jack Quick\n\nHEART OF THE HUNTER by Deon Meyer: Thobela (Tiny) Mpayipheli aka Umzingeli, the Hunter is a hulking black motorcycle-shop janitor and former KGB-trained assassin who plied his trade in service of the struggle against apartheid. He is now a peace-loving family man, but when a plea for help comes from the daughter of an old friend, he is forced to race across the country on a motorcycle to deliver a coveted disk, chased by a homicidal special forces commander. In some ways, this is a standard thriller complete with CIA involvement, but what sets it apart is the emotional complexity of the hero’s journey and the unusual setting. There are a lot of loose ends which hopefully, may be addressed in a sequel. Definitely recommend. 02/11 Jack Quick\n\nHEART OF THE WORLD by Linda Barnes: Boston PI Carlotta Carlyle is doing some “big digging” of her own in this 11th adventure. This time, however, the case is a very personal one. Paolina, Carlotta’s teenaged “Little Sister” whom she loves like a daughter, has disappeared and no one except Carlotta seems to care. Carlyle, a part-time taxi driver and part-time PI is very believable in her native Boston as she struggles with her relationship with Mafioso Sam Gianelli. Unfortunately, she doesn’t seem to travel well. It doesn’t take long for Carlyle to begin to suspect that Paolina didn’t run away on her own, but was in fact kidnapped. She hopes the kidnappers were in the employ of Paolina’s biological father, a Colombian drug lord known as Roldan. However, there is the possibility that it was enemies of Roldan who engineered the snatch. Carlotta travels first to Miami and tracks down Roldan’s lawyer and from there it is on to Bogota. While well written, as were previous Carlyle adventures, it is here that the story begins to break down a bit. With her height and red hair, Carlotta fits pretty well into Irish dominated Boston. In Bogotá both work against her, even though she conveniently speaks Spanish. In the midst of all this Sam decides to propose to Carlotta, which leads to an emotional ending that screams for a sequel soon. Overall another good entry from Ms. Barnes, but I would suggest that future adventures remain fueled on New England clam chowder. 08/06 Jack Quick\n\nHEART-SHAPED BOX by Joe Hill: Aging rocker, Judas Coyne is a collector of the strange and macabre. Some of the items in his collection include artwork by a serial killer, a used hangman’s noose and a snuff film. When the opportunity to purchase ghost online is presented to him, it’s too good to resist even if he believes it’s a fake. The seller promises to send the dead man’s favorite suit and that the ghost of her father will surely follow. When the suit arrives, in an oversized, black, heart-shaped box, Jude hides the thing away in a closet, resigned not to think anymore about it. That night, the ghost appears. Jude soon realizes that he’s been duped in the worst way. This is no ordinary ghost. Jude has allowed an evil spirit, hell-bent on revenge, into his home and his life and now, he can’t get the ghost to leave. The not so well-kept secret about this author – he’s Stephen King’s son. By choosing the same genre as his famous father, Hill will no doubt draw comparison. This creepy debut proves, however, that Joe Hill is a superb addition to the horror genre with a style and voice all his own. 02/07 Becky Lejeune\n\nTHE HEARTBREAK LOUNGE by Wallace Stroby: Former New Jersey State Trooper Harry Rane is back in New Jersey and his wife, Cristina, is away in Seattle trying to determine how to keep their marriage together. Nikki Ennis used to work as a dancer at the Heartbreak Lounge in Asbury Park. She was pregnant when Johnny Hartow was convicted in Florida for attempted murder. She knew the best thing for her baby was to give him up at birth. Now seven years later, Johnny is back and looking for his son. Harry picks up some more bruises in this gritty sequel to the Barbed Wire Kiss, but there are a few glimmers of hope in this grim, but first rate effort. 03/10 Jack Quick\n\nHEARTBREAKER by Robert Ferrigno: Ex-undercover cop Val Duran, appears on the television quiz show Jeopardy to catch the attention of a dangerous adversary named Junior. Half the dope dealers in south Florida were glued to the tube every afternoon, making bets, yelling at the contestants. Junior once shot out a forty-seven inch Mitsubishi over a missed answer. Junior also killed Val’s former partner and threatened his only living relative, his grandmother, Grace. Val takes the old woman with him from Miami, and they hide out in Southern California. Here, he plots some serious revenge on Junior but life gets complicated when he meets a beautiful, troubled marine biologist named Kyle Abbott and her seriously dysfunctional wealthy family. Add in a gorgeous female sociopath and a Gulf War Syndrome victim and you have what could become a cliché in lesser hands, but Ferrigno has the touch with lines like “Even before dawn the freeways buzzed with ambition. It made him homesick for the sultry indolence of Miami, cruising down the A1A, windows rolled down so he could smell the oleander blooming along the median.” A good one. 03/11 Jack Quick\n\nHEARTSICK by Chelsea Cain: Set in damp Portland, Oregon, this thriller rises above the pack and draws comparisons to Thomas Harris’ Silence of the Lambs. Cain has penned a fascinating and macabre study of the relationship between a serial killer and the cop that chased her – yes, her – for ten years. Detective Archie Sheridan headed the task force until Dr. Gretchen Lowell offered to help. Turns out her idea of help was to kidnap and torture Archie for ten long days. But instead of making him her 200th victim, she turns herself in. Archie is put on medical leave and develops a serious pain killer addiction, but two years later is asked back to work when a few teenage girls are murdered and the task force is resurrected. Hoping to spin news coverage their way, a newcomer is added to the task force; Susan Ward, a crime reporter with pink hair that hides a very sharp mind. The story swings back and forth between those ten days of torture and the current case, creating a very interesting juxtaposition and a book that is impossible to put down. First in a series. 09/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHEARTSICK by Chelsea Cain: Detective Archie Sheridan worked the Beauty Killer case for ten years. In the end, the case almost killed him. Archie was kidnapped and tortured for ten days before Gretchen Lowell, the face behind nearly two hundred murders, inexplicably turned herself in. Today, Archie barely hangs on through an addiction to pain-killers, sleeping pills, and anything else that will help to drown out the pain and the memories of what happened. Oddly enough, Archie is declared finally fit to return to work when his superiors decide to reinstate the Beauty Killer Task Force. A new killer has targeted the Portland area and three teenage girls have already been found dead by his hand. This chilling mystery is essentially a story in two parts. One is the current investigation and the race to discover the identity of the After School Strangler before more girls are killed. The second story is that of those horrendous ten days and their aftermath. This creepy debut has drawn comparison to the likes of Thomas Harris and his Hannibal Lecter thrillers. I can certainly see why. Cain has harnessed Harris’s muse – let’s just hope she writes a bit faster than he does. 09/07 Becky Lejeune\n\nHEAT LIGHTNING by John Sandford: This is Sandford’s second outing for investigator Virgil Flowers, first featured in Dark of the Moon. Flowers is in bed with one his wives (the second one to be exact) when he is called out by Lucas Davenport to investigate the second murder in which the victim is found with two small caliber bullet wounds to the head and a lemon in his mouth. Both bodies were found near a veteran’s memorial. It seems obvious that the two murders are connected and Flowers fears there may be more forthcoming unless he can quickly determine what commonality there is between the two victims. A first rate police procedural. Hopefully this series will continue alongside the highly readable “Prey” series featuring Luca Davenport. 10/08 Jack Quick\n\nHEAT WAVE by Richard Castle: I am not a fan of mystery TV shows, forensic shows, any of that. I’ve never willingly watched CSI or Law & Order or any of their mutations. Yet when a friend told me about this new show last year, Castle, I immediately set up the Tivo. Why? Because the main character is a suspense writer, and the show often uses real writers as guest stars – Stephen J. Cannell, James Patterson and Michael Connelly have all been featured. The stories themselves are generally over the top, murders neatly solved in 45 minutes. It’s the characters that make this show, specifically, the main character Rick Castle, played by Nathan Fillion. The premise is Castle is a friend of the Mayor, and has somehow gotten permission to shadow a female detective on the homicide squad as research for his book. On the TV show, the first book of a series featuring this woman detective is published, and magically, it is simultaneously available for sale at bookstores everywhere.\n\nA Manhattan millionaire is found dead on the sidewalk. The trophy wife with a suspicious past becomes the first suspect. A slim volume with a mystery at it’s heart that is a simple as those on the TV show, the characters are again what make this book worth reading. Castle is transformed into “Rook”, a journalist rather than a novelist. Is it a great mystery? No. Is it especially well written? No. It’s a fun read, especially for fans of the show. Note: They have taken this gag as seriously as one can take something like this. The author bio references Castle’s fictional TV family. At the front of the book is a list of nonexistent books by this author. The author is a fictional character, and the books are a figment of his imagination. Please don’t annoy your bookseller or librarian by demanding these titles.\n\nI would love to know who really wrote this book. I suspect Stephen J. Cannell, as he has been involved since its inception and “blurbed” the book, but I haven’t been able to find out…yet. 12/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHEIR APPARENT by Twist Phelan: First issued in 2002 and the first book in a series, this is a new, revised edition that apparently smoothes out the original book to better mesh with FALSE FORTUNE, Phelan’s newest book, which will be released this fall. Young Joe McGinnis has just passed the Arizona bar when the Senior Partner of his Pinnacle Peak employer, one of the area’s most prestigious firms, dies in an automobile accident that we, the readers, are pretty certain is murder. Then on the night of McGinnis’ first date with Mia Ortiz, personal assistant to Cordelia Barrett, a wealthy client, the young couple return to Ms. Barrett’s home and find Barrett and her son both dead – sprawled in a pool of blood. Joe knows that Ms. Barrett had changed her will, an action with which her son violently disagreed. But then Mia is charged with the murder. Quite a challenge for a novice attorney. Looks like my summer will be spent catching up on this series. 05/07 Jack Quick\n\nHEIR APPARENT by Twist Phelan: Just in time for the latest installment in her Pinnacle Peak series, Phelan has decided to re-release book one, with some editing and additions. Green lawyer Joe McGuinness is lucky he was able to keep his job after the unfortunate death of his new boss. It doesn’t mean that he is happy with his new assignment. With his mentor’s position open, Joe is reassigned to the Trust and Estates, or Deadhead, division of the firm. One of their prestigious clients, Cordelia Barrett, has made some recent changes to her Last Will and Testament and it’s Joe’s job to deliver the final copy. A lucky accident leads to his meeting Mia, Mrs. Barrett’s personal assistant. On the night of their first official date, Joe and Mia discover the bodies of Cordelia and her son Sonny. Mia is arrested and the evidence seems to point to her guilt but Joe is unconvinced. Someone was not happy with the changes in Mrs. Barrett’s will. With Sonny dead and Mia behind bars, Joe must discover who could stand to benefit from the Barrett’s deaths. There are a total of four mysteries involved in this one little novel, probably a few too many for me. Otherwise, Phelan’s mystery is enjoyable and entertaining. Joe McGuinness does not appear to be the main character in the following titles of the series, but his somewhat goofy buddy Jerry Dan is part of the reason this debut was re-released in the first place. 05/07 Becky Lejeune\n\nTHE HEIST by Janet Evanovich & Lee Goldberg: This is a new series centered around ex-Navy Seal turned FBI agent Kate O’Hare. Yeah, I’m pretty sure the Seals don’t take women but it works for this story. O’Hare is after Nick Fox, a con man who has escaped capture more times that she wants to think about. She finally gets her man and he escapes from custody at the courthouse. Kate is kicked off the case and put on vacation, but her idea of a vacation is catching her man. Turns out he’s been turned and is now her partner, working to capture other con artists that are beyond the legal reach of the FBI. Tracking their mark around the world makes for additional interest as does the crew they put together. Kate is backed up by her father, retired military who has taught her how to kill a man sixteen different ways with just a tweezer. The girl’s got skills and so do Evanovich and Goldberg. I’d like to see these characters more fully developed but the basic premise is good. This appears to be the first of a new series and I’m looking forward to more. 7/13 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHELL FOR THE HOLIDAYS by Chris Grabenstein: When a customs agent’s kid gets snatched on Halloween in FBI agent Christopher Miller’s neighborhood, he goes into work mode. You may remember Miller from Slay Ride, the first terrific Christopher Miller Holiday Thriller. Miller is a kidnapping expert, but he has some family stuff to deal with – it was his daughter Angela who was kidnapped the previous Christmas by a “bad Santa”, and with the holidays approaching, her fears are resurfacing. But she is dying to go to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and her psychologist mom knows that seeing a “good Santa” can only be good for Angela. So they make hotel reservations and plan a therapeutic trip to NYC. Meanwhile, Miller wonders why there was no ransom demand, but the FBI isn’t interested, they are solely focused on international terrorists. What Miller doesn’t know is that Dr. John Tilley, a white supremacist, has a plan to take back America and unfortunately, his plan includes an ex-Marine sharpshooter with a Stinger missile and a parade target. Hell for the Holidays proves Grabenstein can do more than light and funny; the hatred being spewed made me uncomfortable at times, but the book moves at lightening speed, and I couldn’t put it down. Treat yourself to a holiday gift…12/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHELL FOR THE HOLIDAYS by Chris Grabenstein: A lightly written book about holiday terror featuring African-American Jersey City FBI agent Christopher Miller. A white supremacist group is planning to disrupt the holidays by blowing up an aircraft full of folks departing New York for Africa on the day before Thanksgiving. All the stock characters are involved, and while the plot is complicated, the punches are telegraphed loud and clear and the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired. All in all, a cozy dressed up as a thriller/ police procedural. Not unlike a Stuart Woods, although Woods does a better job of character development. I think this was one that was written for the money. 09/08 Jack Quick\n\nHELL GATE by Linda Fairstein: Alexandra Cooper is back and she’s got her hands full. First a boatload of illegal immigrants crashes on Rockaway Beach, washing up several bodies – at least one of whom was dead before she hit the water. If that isn’t enough to keep her busy, she is also dealing with a drunk driving married congressman with a crazy girlfriend who has his love child, and a politically ambitious mayor. Mike Chapman is on the case and somehow Fairstein manages to tie it all together by the end. Added bonus – learn lots about Gracie Mansion and the Federalist mansions in NYC. Fairstein provides a very entertaining read, as usual. 04/10 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHELL HOLE by Chris Grabenstein: It wouldn’t be summer without John Ceepak and Danny Boyle, back in their fourth outing on the Jersey shore. Grabenstein has been going darker with his writing (Hell for the Holidays, Slay Ride) and this book – and its cover – reflect that change. It works. Ceepak is still the honorable man that Boyle aspires to, underscored by a decision to let the kids baseball team he coaches lose rather than accept a bad call in their favor by an umpire. The lightness ends with that game, however, as Boyle is called to handle a noise disturbance with a bunch of partying soldiers home on leave from Iraq. While talking to the soldiers, they get a call to identify the body of another soldier, an apparent suicide, found in the men’s room at a highway rest stop. Boyle won’t let the men, who’ve been drinking for hours, drive, so he escorts them there. He finds a detective he’d worked with before and found incompetent, a suicide that doesn’t look quite right, and the need to talk it all over with Ceepak. This leads to several questions, chief of which are how bad is the illegal drug situation in Iraq and how far will politicians go to gain the White House. Disturbing answers await in this intricate, fast moving and terrific tale. 7/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHELL HOLE by Chris Grabenstein: It starts with the apparent suicide of Corporal Shariff Smith, an Iraqi war veteran, but it becomes very personal for super-Cop John Ceepak and his rookie sidekick, Danny Boyle, of the Sea Haven, N.J., police force when it is determined that the man was someone whose life Ceepak had saved in an Iraqi ambush. The plot is not overly complicated with a ring of local thieves, a squad of soldiers home from Iraqi, a Senator whose son may not be as advertised, and a potential new girlfriend for Danny – Auxiliary Officer Samantha “Sam” Starkey, who is as green as Danny was a few years ago. Serious but with the touch of lightness you would expect in a New Jersey beach-side resort town. 09/08 Jack Quick\n\nA HELL OF A WOMAN: AN ANTHOLOGY OF FEMALE NOIR edited by Meg Abbott: What is the best story in this anthology? An easy question – the next one. From the opening line of the first one “”Hey.” Fucking blinding light in her eyes.” to the appendix where authors, booksellers, critics, and film aficionados pay homage to favorite noir writers, characters, and performers, this one is a walk on the wild side and a must read for anyone who “likes their women on the trashy side.” The foreword is by Val McDermid and there are 24 contributors, most of whom are stalwarts in the field – Ken Bruen, Zoe Sharp, S. J. Rozan, Vicki Hendricks, 4MA’s Donna Moore, Christa Faust, and Sandra Scoppettone. To quote Debby Marsh in 1953’s The Big Heat, “We’re all sisters under the mink.” Outstanding product from the folks at Houston’s Busted Flush Press. 01/09 Jack Quick\n\nHELL OR HIGH WATER by Joy Castro: Nola Cespedes is sick of covering human interest fluff pieces. Then her boss approaches her with a real assignment: in the aftermath of Katrina, a number of sex offenders went off the map. The piece Nola’s boss has given her would involve covering the public’s opinions and perspectives as well as that of registered sex offenders living in the city. Though she’s not excited about the prospect of interviewing a bunch of perverted, and possibly even violent, criminals, it’s Nola’s one shot to make it big. Nola wants nothing more than to move to New York and make a name for herself, and she knows this is the best chance she’ll have. Meanwhile, a girl has been kidnapped — taken from a crowded restaurant in the middle of the day. It’s believed that the case is tied to two other recent murders. If Nola can connect the kidnapping and the murders with the piece she’s writing, she’ll be set. But Nola’s story places her in the middle of a shady subculture of criminals and as she pushes her limits at work, problems in her personal life are coming to a head. Hell or High Water is definitely one of those word of mouth books. The story is really too complicated to fairly sum up in a quick nutshell description, but it definitely deserves a lot of attention. Castro’s fiction debut is well plotted and features an intriguing lead character. Castro also does an amazing job with her setting. The real New Orleans comes to life in this book – the good and the not so tourist friendly but not quite bad as well. 8/12 Becky Lejeune\n\nHell to Pay by George Pelecanos: Strange & Quinn are back in this sequel to Right as Rain, and the streets of D.C. are as black and gritty as ever. The private investigators are hired to find a fourteen-year-old runaway girl from the suburbs, and it turns out she is working as a prostitute for one very bad guy. Things really spin out of control when one of the boys on Derek Strange’s PeeWee football team is killed, and Strange takes it personally. This fast moving, suspenseful story kept me turning pages until the wee hours.\n\nHELL’S BAY by James W. Hall: Thorn is back in his wildest adventure yet. He is leading a fishing expedition into the isolated lakes and mangrove swamps of Hells Bay in the Everglades when he meets up with the Bates family. They are one of Florida’s aristocratic pioneer clans with huge holdings in real estate and mining. The family matriarch Abigail has been killed and her heirs want Thorn to solve the case, claiming he is, in fact, a long lost relative. Deliverance, meet Cape Fear, in what is probably Hall’s best effort to date. You can cut the tension with one of Thorn’s sharp fishing knives while in the background the sound of banjos can be heard over the surf. Hall certainly knows his Florida and with lines like “the air smelled of snakes and damp mud and an occasional gust of a sharp insistent citrus scent that made her think of a teenage boy’s first cologne,” you are pulled right into the swamps and sloughs. 04/08 Jack Quick\n\nTHE HELP by Kathryn Stockett: Jackson, Mississippi is the setting for this amazing debut novel about the civil rights movement in the early 1960’s. Eugenia “Skeeter” Phelan is an old school, moneyed Southern belle who, unlike all her friends, is unmarried. Skeeter wants to be a writer, and applies for a position at a New York publishing house. The editor offers her the advice to “write about what disturbs you” and Skeeter does just that. Constantine, the black maid who helped raise her, mysteriously quits and moves away while Skeeter is away at college. Her parents won’t tell her why, and Skeeter is bereft. She turns to her friends’ maids, but they won’t tell her either. Then she gets the idea to write a book about how these maids really feel about their jobs, their employers and their lives. But this is the deep south, where a young man is beaten and blinded for using a white restroom even though it wasn’t labeled as such, and fears run deep. Eventually one maid agrees to talk to her, and then another, and their stories make for mesmerizing reading. Stockett includes an author’s note at the end that adds to the authenticity of the book. Book clubs are going to love this as much as I did – don’t miss it. 08/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHELP FOR THE HAUNTED by John Searles: Sylvester and Rose Mason offer up a very unique service: they help the haunted. For a while they even took their two daughters, Sylvie and Rose, along with them. But one night, Sylvester and Rose get a phone call that proves to be their last. Everyone has always been certain that Albert Lynch was responsible. After all, Albert left his troubled daughter in the Mason’s care not long before their death. Sylvie is the star witness in the case, having entered the church where her parents were killed just moments after the crime took place. Lately, however, she’s had doubts about what she believed she saw that night. Searles’s latest is a mystery wrapped up in a bit of horror package. While the book is a thriller at heart, there are some seriously creepy elements to the story. Enough to give even the most hardy horror fan goosebumps. The narrative unfolds in two timelines, Sylvie post murder and Sylvie’s own version of events leading up to the incident as she tries to determine who had a motive to kill her parents. Help For the Haunted is one of my favorite novels of the year and one that I’d highly recommend to anyone looking for a fabulously plotted and somewhat scary read. 10/13 Becky Lejeune\n\nHELPLESS by Daniel Palmer: Daniel Palmer burst on the literary scene in February 2011 with an extremely absorbing techno-thriller. It remained for him to prove that he is capable of producing the same quality novel, and with the publication of Helpless he certainly did and than some. The book is also a techno-thriller with a plot line that is both fascinating and frightening for people having so much of their lives based on computer records and actions. Mr Palmer spent a decade working on first generation web sites and his intimate knowledge of computer workings is brought to bear in Helpless, as it was in his first book, Delirious.\n\nTom Hawkins, an ex Navy Seal returns to his home town with the intention of raising his daughter Jill after the murder of his wife. He unexpectedly finds himself a suspect in his wife’s murder. While looking to extract himself from that charge he finds that evidence is presented gained from searches of his own computer and cell phone against him accusing him of buying porn photos of girls in the town and selling them, and at the same time a blog accuses him of sleeping with one of the soccer players on the girl’s high school soccer team that he coaches.\n\nThe FBI has jurisdiction in pornography marketing and sends in an agent and backup. Loraine Miles (Rainy) is the agent and after looking at the facts presented and talking to Tom becomes increasingly unsure that Tom was not framed for the crimes he is accused of. During the course of the investigation a romance begins to develop between the two.\n\nThe concept of being able to set up people as culpable for crimes committed using their own computers and cell phones is a very frightening one and looking at the accusations and facts established against Tom makes the reader aware that the same thing can happen to them if a computer expert sets his or her mind to it. Palmer makes a great case for setting up some oversight on possibly the part of the FBI to work with people who are caught in computer based accusations and are seemingly trapped. Daniel Palmer has written his first two books in the space of a year. That makes it probable that the next one will be out about the beginning of 2013. I plan to read it on the night before a day off so that when I’m done I can sleep late the next day. 3/12 Paul Lane\n\nHEMLOCK by Kathleen Peacock: A white wolf has been killing people in Hemlock and Mac’s best friend, Amy, is the latest victim. After the discovery of Lupine Syndrome, werewolves have become commonplace everywhere. The bloodlust of a newly infected werewolf is uncontrollable and anyone suspected of infection is immediately shipped to a rehabilitation camp. Everyone believes the Hemlock murders have to be the result of a newly infected suffering from bloodlust. When the Trackers are brought in to bring down the wolf, Hemlock is thrown into chaos. Some students at Mac’s school are accused of being infected while others begin to fully support and follow the Trackers themselves. Haunted by Amy’s death, Mac decides the only way to gain closure and put things right is to find Amy’s killer on her own. But her investigation turns up surprising secrets concerning those closest to her. Could the killer be someone Mac knows? Hemlock is fantastic all around—characters that feel real and are believable as teens and a pacing and plot that are quick and compelling. Hemlock is definitely a must for urban fantasy and paranormal mystery fans both teen and adult. 5/12 Becky Lejeune\n\nHenry’s List of Wrongs by John Scott Shepherd: A hilarious romp through one man’s attempt at repenting for all the wrongs he’s committed. Very enjoyable, quick read. Footnote: I read that the film rights had been sold with Jim Carrey (not my favorite actor) to star, which sort of threw a pall over the book for me.\n\nHER FEARFUL SYMMETRY by Audrey Niffenegger: It’s been a few years since The Time Traveler’s Wife but I have to admit, it was worth the wait. Niffenegger is just a great storyteller, and she keeps turning my preconceived ideas on their heads. I don’t generally care for ghost stories, at least not since I was a kid, but this book – a ghost story in its simplest incantation – kept me mesmerized. Perhaps it was the twins angle; like many people I’ve always been fascinated by identical twins. The symmetry here is in two generations of identical twins. Edwina and Elspeth had a falling out and hadn’t spoken in decades, helped by the fact that Edwina moved to America while Elspeth stayed in London. When Elspeth dies, she bequeaths her worldly goods to Julia and Valentina, Edwina’s identical twin daughters whom she never met, with the unusual request that in order to collect, the girls must live in Elspeth’s flat for one year. The bigger catch, however, is that Elslpeth’s ghost hasn’t left the flat. Julia and Valentina are delighted; the twenty year olds have dropped out of college and just floundering, and an adventure abroad for a year seems like just the escape they need. During the course of their year, they learn about their interesting neighbors, and the famous Highgate Cemetary that borders the property. Lots of family secrets are eventually revealed, but it’s the truly interesting characters that propel this story forward. A great read. 10/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch.\n\nTHE HERETIC’S DAUGHTER by Kathleen Kent: Between February 1692 and May 1693, over 150 men, women, and children from Salem and the neighboring villages were accused of witchcraft. They would all be imprisoned, and some tortured and hanged, before the harrowing event would finally come to an end. On August 19, 1692, after being prosecuted and convicted, Martha Carrier was hanged and killed. Author Kathleen Kent is a tenth-generation descendant of this fascinating woman. The Heretic’s Daughter is Martha’s story as told through the eyes of her ten-year-old daughter Sarah. Their mother daughter relationship is a strained one, but in the months leading to her mother’s arrest and death, Sarah finally begins to understand and open up to her mother. Kent’s debut is an incredible read and her passion for her subject really shines through. It’s also one of the most emotionally turbulent books I’ve read in quite a while. The Heretic’s Daughter is a powerful novel that proves what a great talent Kathleen Kent has already become. This should be on everyone’s must read list for fall. 09/08 Becky Lejeune\n\nTHE HEROINES by Eileen Favorite: The Prairie Homestead is not your typical bed and breakfast. The average guest could be rubbing elbows with some of the most famous ladies of literature and never know it. Penny Entwhistle and her mother have successfully kept their infamous guests secret up until now. Penny’s own typical teen angst threatens to blow the lid on everything her mother has worked for. When Penny reveals to members of the public that the likes of Madame Bovary and Scarlett O’Hara have been hanging out at her house, her own mother lies and says that her daughter is imagining things. This lands Penny a vacation in a mental institution she calls the Unit. Desperate to get out, Penny again risks everything by having her own knight on a white horse rescue her – not her knight of course but one visiting from yet another classic tale of romance and woe. The results could be disastrous but the trip along the way is mighty entertaining. Favorite’s debut is a fanciful tale of mothers and daughters and growing up, with a twist of romantic literature. The Heroines is an amusing read for book lovers everywhere. 12/07 Becky Lejeune\n\nHE’S GONE by Deb Caletti: Ian Keller has disappeared without a trace. The last thing Dani remembered before Ian went missing was returning home from his company party. They hadn’t fought, but she knew he was angry with her. The next morning he was gone. She thought maybe he’d gone to get coffee. Then she thought he might have run into someone and gotten caught up in a conversation. Dani ran through every possibility she could think of before she realized his car was still parked in the lot near their houseboat. And then she got worried. Did Ian leave her? It’s happened before – Ian left his first wife to marry Dani, who was married as well when they met. Or is it something worse? I’m at odds with Deb Caletti’s latest. On the one hand, the writing is fabulous. Dani’s narrative is devoted to analyzing every aspect of her relationship, trying to find a way to unravel what’s happened to Ian. On the other hand, He’s Gone is a really depressing read. 5/13 Becky Lejeune\n\nTHE HIDDEN by Bill Pronzini: The Northern California coastline is one of the most beautiful places on earth. The Coastline Killer thinks so, and is dedicated to do whatever it takes to keep it that way. Four victims so far for this “environmental activist.” Will jay and Shelby Macklin be his next victims? Does it matter to them? Their ten year marriage is coming apart at the seams, Jay is unemployed and nearly unemployable – a promising baseball career ended by injuries, the failure of his restaurant, and the heart problems he hasn’t disclosed even to Shelby. Shelby’s words, “Two people can’t live together without communicating” perfectly sum up their current situation. An EMT, She is attracted to an ER doctor but has resisted beginning an affair. Together and separately they are spending the week after Christmas at a cottage on the wild and beautiful northern California coast. Jay’s hope is that he can save their marriage, but a violent storm and the Coastline Killer make marital woes secondary to survival. Pronzini has written 70-plus novels, and The Hidden shows no drop off in quality. Not gory but suspenseful enough to make you double check the door and window locks before you go to bed tonight. 02/11 Jack Quick\n\nTHE HIDDEN MAN by David Ellis: Jason and Sammy grew up together, best friends until high school; Jason went on to college and law school, while Sammy coasted after his baby sister was kidnapped and never found. Jason became a star at a top law firm but left to practice solo after his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. Then the past comes back to haunt them both. Jason receives a $10,000 cash retainer from a mysterious “Mr. Smith” to defend Sammy, who is accused of murdering the man long ago suspected of kidnapping his sister. But he won’t plead temporary insanity, which would allow the dead man’s past into evidence, and Jason is frustrated. “Mr. Smith” has explicit ideas about how he wants the defense handled, and things start going awry when Jason deviates from the plan. Edgar-award winner Ellis (Line of Vision, Eye of the Beholder) has created an interesting character, a damaged lawyer who’s not afraid to get his hands dirty, to build this new series around. 09/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch. Copyright © 2009 Cahners Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. Reprinted with permission.\n\nHIDE by Lisa Gardner: Boston Police Sergeant D. D. Warren hooks up with Massachusetts State Detective Robert Dodge (Alone) to investigate a long abandoned underground cavern found on the grounds of the former Boston State Mental Hospital. The hospital had been shut down decades earlier, but the mummified bodies of six young girls are found below ground, somewhat reminiscent of a previous case. Annabelle Granger has spent her life running, moving from city to city with a new name every eighteen months or so at her paranoid father’s whim. Annabelle is thought to be one of the dead girls until she strolls into the police station, a beautiful young woman who bears a striking resemblance to a previous victim. Former patients and staff members of the hospital become the prime suspects in this fast paced, twisty thriller. The point of view occasionally shifts from Annabelle’s first person perspective to an omniscient narrator to easily give the reader more information than Annabelle has, but the introduction of a new, critical character towards the end of the book was rather unsettling. 02/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHIDING PLACE by Collin Wilcox: In this fourth Lieutenant Frank Hastings outing (1973) the crew is working the homicide of a girl whose body is found in Golden Gate Park. The deeper the group investigates the more complicated the chase becomes. Then a second murder raises the stakes to resolve the case quickly. Another excellent police procedural of the that era – no cellphones or computers, cigarettes are still socially acceptable, and if there needs to be a little bit of leaning to unlock some clues so be it. Nicely done and highly recommended. 12/10 Jack Quick\n\nHIGH PROFILE by Robert B. Parker: It is not a good day in Paradise when the body of Walton Weeks is found hanging from a tree. Weeks hosted a popular national radio gabfest, wrote a newspaper column, and churned out best-selling books until someone shot him and left him hanging from a tree. The next body to be found is that of Weeks’ pregnant lover. Paradise Chief of Police Jesse Stone finds himself in the middle of the highest profile case of his career as he tries to solve the double homicide with his 12-person force and remain sober during the process. He also has to contend with his ex-wife Jenn, now an investigative reporter, as well as private investigator Sunny Randall–a sometime lover—that he needs to help with Jenn. A typical Parker outing. Taut language, complex emotions, and a good mystery. One of his best. 02/07 Jack Quick\n\nHIGH MIDNIGHT by Stuart Kaminsky: Its number 6 in the World War II era adventures of LA PI Toby Peters, Detective to the Stars. This one ain’t High Noon but like that famous 1952 classic, it does feature Gary Cooper. Someone wants to make a movie with him so badly they resort to threats, blackmail, and murder. With a little help from a writer type named Ernest Hemingway, Peters stumbles over corpses, avoids stray bullets, and tries to keep from being turned into a Kosher hot dog by some menacing East Coast thugs. Remember the words of Client Eastwood as Dirty Harry, “Nobody, I mean, nobody, puts ketchup on a hot dog.” If you are a movie buff, this series is for you. 05/09 Jack Quick\n\nHissy Fit by Mary Kay Andrews: This is just a fun read. It’s about a woman who catches her fiancé banging her best friend/maid of honor on the board room table at the country club during their rehearsal dinner. She goes wild, pitches an historic “hissy fit” and storms out, then meets a wealthy young man who’s amused at her misspelled keying of her ex-beloved’s car in the parking lot. She spends the rest of the book decorating his newly purchased plantation style home (this is Southern fiction) so he can impress some hot lawyer he saw on a PBS fundraiser. She pals around with her gay best friend who convinces her she has abandonment issues since her mother’s disappearance 25 years earlier, lending a pinch of suspense to the plot. It’s light, fast moving, entertaining fun and I couldn’t put it down (and just the perfect antidote to hurricanes.) Then I went back and read SAVANNAH BLUES, which was also great fun.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF LOVE by Nicole Krauss: This is an amazing book – I borrowed it from the library, read it, then ran out and bought a copy and read it again. The “love” in the title is a love of literature, of books, of family, of laughter despite the pain of life. Unforgettable characters, a book within a book within a book that all comes together in the end, a joy! Leo Gursky is an old man who creates disturbances wherever he goes just so people will notice him – for who notices an old man? His losses are numerous, yet he keeps on keeping on and making us laugh while he does it. His lost novel, appropriately titled The History of Love, unbeknownst to him was published by another. The woman he loved and wanted to marry who couldn’t wait and married someone else. His son, a revered author, who doesn’t even know who he is. Then there is a young girl, Alma Singer, named for the main character in the book Leo doesn’t even know was published. Her search for the truth while dealing with the death of her father adds a haunting suspense that enriches the story even further. To be drawn into this world is a delight, and I am grateful. 06/05\n\nTHE HIT by David Baldacci: Will Robie was introduced in The Innocent. He is an assassin working for the CIA and charged with killing persons deemed enemies of the United States at any location necessary. A skilled killer, with no mercy, he is considered by his peers at the agency as one of the best they have handling the assignments given to him, and not questioning the reason for the kill order. Will is handed the assignment of hunting down and killing Jessica Reel, a fellow employee who has apparently gone rogue and murdered two officers of the CIA with no reason, nor any official sanction to do so. Jessica has a reputation of being almost as good as, or possibly as good as Will in handling assignments for the CIA. With David Baldacci setting up the scenario we know that all is not as initially depicted, and the reader is again treated to another engrossing novel by this master craftsman. What is the truth, and where does it lead Will is a fascinating study in what could happen when people in power find reasons to abuse that power thinking that they are the only ones knowing what is right and wrong. The plot leads us from an assignment to stop a rogue agent to a conspiracy taking place at very high government levels. With his usual talent for fleshing out people in this books, we become involved in the action, and do understand why everyone acts as they do. Another page turner by Baldacci, and a continued desire to read more books by him. 05/13 Paul Lane\n\nHIT ME by Lawrence Block: Keller, the hit man Block made famous, returns after a few years absence. When Keller’s previous arrangements blew up, he became a man named Nicholas Edwards who lives in New Orleans renovating houses, doing honest work and making decent money at it. Between his family and his stamp collection, all his spare time is happily accounted for. But now Dot ahs called and Keller is back in the trade. Keller’s work takes him to New York, the former home he hasn’t dared revisit, where his target is the abbot of a midtown monastery. Another call puts him on a West Indies cruise, taking care of a government witness. The real test comes in Cheyenne, where a recent widow is looking to sell her husband’s stamp collection. 3/13 Jack Quick\n\nHIT AND RUN by Lawrence Block: Keller is like most of us. He has a job that he works at in order to pay his bills, feed his hobby (stamp collecting) and hopefully prepare for his eventual retirement. The major difference is Keller’s a hit man. After all these years and many successful assignments he is now ready to begin that retirement, but there is just one more job. Keller really doesn’t want to go to Des Moines for the job but it has been paid for so what else can he do? After all, there are no refunds in this business. While he is in Des Moines looking at additions to his stamp collection, someone kills the charismatic governor of Ohio. Normally this would have little impact on Keller – except the police have released a picture of the alleged killer. Guess who? Now Keller is stranded in Des Moines, cut off from his associate Dot in White Plains, New York, every cop in America’s just seen his picture, his ID and credit cards are no longer good, and he just spent almost all of his cash on the stamps. The best Keller yet. 07/08 Jack Quick\n\nHIT MAN By Lawrence Block: Block is a multi talented writer, the winner of two Edgars and numerous other awards for his Scudder series, yet being the creative genius he is, he strays afield from time to time. He wrote a short story for “Playboy” called “Answers To Soldier” back in the late 70’s or early 80’s that becomes the lynch pin of this novel; what follows is a collection of brilliantly linked short stories that were published as individual efforts, but eventually became linked together.\n\nKeller is his own man. He’s the guy on the next bar stool to you. He’s a lonely guy, on the one hand craving companionship, and on the other hand, doing his job ruthlessly. He could be your next door neighbor, the guy you wave hi to every day. But when he gets the call, packs his bag, and heads out, he’s a stone killer. The problem is that Keller is not sure that this is his calling. He’s a middle aged guy who’s thinking about getting out of the biz. Block balances Keller’s skill against his own self doubt. (My favorite one in this is called “Keller’s Therapy”) And eventually Keller (and his pal Dot) realize that things have to change. After all, it’s Keller’s only gig, and Dot’s true hope. By the way, Block parlayed this into a second collection called HIT LIST, and one soon to be released (July 4, 06) called HIT PARADE. The beauty of this is that these are short stories that are all interlinked. Block is a damn genius who deserves the accolades he’s received. This is a series that both Scudder and Bernie R. fans can equally get behind. Enjoy the master at work. 05/06 DOC\n\nHIT PARADE by Lawrence Block: John Keller is a working man who ponders questions like: Does this assignment compromise my ethics? Will I ever get another job? Like all careers, his has its challenges, some imposed by circumstance, others generated by introspection. He also ponders a retirement in which he will abandon his Manhattan lifestyle for a trailer in the southwestern desert. The main difference between Keller and the rest of us is that Keller is a hit man, a contract killer who takes on assignments within his own code of ethics and performs them in how own style. You get the feeling that when Block writes about Keller he is really fantasizing for all of us about a life with no rules, or just those we make for ourselves. In any event, the stories in Hit Parade are at times humorous, thoughtful and quintessential Block at his best. 07/06 Jack Quick\n\nHOAX by Robert Tanenbaum: I was prepared to not like this book. Instead of buying it, I waited until I could get it from the library. Apparently Mr. Tanenbaum used Michael Gruber as the ghost for the first 15 Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi books, all of which were most enjoyable. Whoever has succeeded Gruber has a way to go to match his style and ability. Much of the book is a rehash of the first fifteen books while the plot is mundane – crooked politicians and priestly pedophiles. At 490 pages, it has the feel of being padded by at least a hundred pages. Nevertheless, the characters are like old friends, and while this visit wasn’t as good as some previous ones, it was acceptable. However, hopefully the new guy/gal will catch on quickly, otherwise, I will regretfully say goodbye to Karp, et al. 11/06 Jack Quick\n\nHOLD TIGHT by Harlan Coben: I have had a love/hate relationship with Coben’s books for some time now. I was his biggest champion when he wrote his first standalone thriller, Tell No One. But as he continued to write and define the “family thriller”, I started having serious issues. Coben can suck a reader in and keep those pages turning like nobody’s business, but a few books ago I noticed that he was writing himself into a corner and taking absurd, unbelievable, completely far-fetched ways out of it. That, combined with his penchant for wrapping up every loose end in the last two pages caused me to stop reading him. But I was persuaded to try his last book, The Woods, and I was delighted to find that he finally learned how to write a believable, albeit entirely too detailed, ending. Which brings me to his latest effort, Hold Tight.\n\nCoben recently penned an op-ed piece for the NY Times titled “The Undercover Parent”, about why parents should install software to spy on their children’s every move, every time they go online. He slams that ball home in this book. In lovely suburban New Jersey, one such family is weighing that very option as their teenage son’s grades are sliding and his behavior becomes erratic. The arguments both for and against are well presented, and it is an integral part of the story which includes moms getting murdered, teenage drug parties, and a teenage suicide – most of your basic parental nightmares rolled up into one riveting read – with an ending that makes sense. All in all, I’m happy to say this was an excellent read and a marvelous way to spend a few hours. 05/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHOLD TIGHT by Harlan Coben: I’m not even certain where to begin with this book. Several different subplots simultaneously take place and unbelievably they all tie in together at the end. First, Sixteen year-old Adam Baye has been distant and emotionally removed lately. His best friend, Spencer, committed suicide and Adam’s parents, Tia and Mike, take action before he follows suit. They install a spy program on his computer that allows them to receive daily reports of his computer activity. They become instantly alarmed when they view some alarming messages that Adam has received. Meanwhile, Spencer’s mother has discovered some evidence that indicates that her son did not commit suicide. She confronts Adam, his best friend, and he disappears. A murderer is on the loose, killing women and leaving their bodies so badly beaten they are not recognizable. And finally, an adolescent girl is taunted at school after her teacher makes a comment about her appearance. Four seemingly very different subplots all come to one by the end of this suspenseful book. This was my first taste of Coben’s writing and I plan on continuing the experience. 07/08 Jennifer Lawrence\n\nHOLD TIGHT by Harlan Coben: A night with a Harlan Coben book is a guaranteed night without sleep. In his latest stand-alone, parents come face-to-face with their worst nightmares. Tia and Mike Baye are concerned when their son, Adam, becomes more reserved and introverted after the suicide of one of his classmates. They go to extremes by installing a program on his computer that will track all of his activities online. Each day, the company responsible sends them a report, and each day is the same mundane stuff. Everything changes when Tia comes across a disturbingly cryptic instant message, and an e-mail about a party Adam is to attend. Mike plans to take Adam to a hockey game, to keep him from going to the party, but Adam disappears. It’s not the first time their son has run off, but Mike and Tia know there has to be something more than teen angst at play here. Coben is the absolute king of suspense – no one does it like he can. In Hold Tight he weaves multiple plot lines together to create yet another page-turning thrill ride that will keep you awake all night. If you pay attention, you just might recognize some familiar faces, too. 04/08 Becky Lejeune\n\nTHE HOLLOW MAN by Oliver Harris: Detective Nick Belsey wakes up bloody and bruised after spending the night in the grass. Nearby he finds a crashed police car, not even from his district, and knows he’s the one responsible. In fact, Belsey’s life has been in a slow decline for some time now. His paychecks no longer cover the minimum payments due on his many debts and the creditors are breathing down his neck. What’s more, he’s got no place to live. When he answers a missing person’s call, he starts to think things could turn around. A normal adult disappearance wouldn’t raise any flags but this guy is rich. Still, nothing seems suspicious and the man even left behind a note before leaving. Belsey comes up with a plan to temporarily borrow the man’s identity—and money—and get the heck out of dodge. As he learns more about the missing businessman, though, Belsey decides there’s more to this case than meets the eye. And it seems someone wanted the man dead badly enough that they’re willing to come after Belsey now, too. Harris’s debut is exceptional. Belsey is a true anti-hero, a bad guy in just about every way. His only motivation is completely self-serving and everything his does is to get himself ahead. Still, I couldn’t help but like him. I hope this is to be a new series because I would love to see more of Belsey and definitely can’t wait for more from Harris. 12/12 Becky Lejeune\n\nTHE HOLLOWER by Mary SanGiovanni: Dave Kohlar has seen it, so has his sister Sally, and so did the man from Sally’s therapy group who committed suicide. Dave would like to think that he’s a fairly rational man, but when he sees the faceless creature in an overcoat and hat following him around, he’s sure he must be losing it. Then Sally flips out and has to be committed. Shortly after that, she escapes without a trace and Dave knows the creature he calls The Hollower is behind it. Then Dave meets Erik and Cheryl. They see the creature too and it’s possible that the three of them working together may be able to fight this thing. They’re joined by two unlikely allies as they set off to kill something that none of them could possibly understand. Mary SanGiovanni’s debut was a 2007 Stoker nominee for best first novel. Her story is refreshingly original and features a villain who could rival Freddie himself. The Hollower is creepy without ever going over the top. The chills are there and the ending is a killer. No worries, though, the sequel Found You is already out. 09/08 Becky Lejeune\n\nHOLLYWOOD CROWS by Joseph Wambaugh"
