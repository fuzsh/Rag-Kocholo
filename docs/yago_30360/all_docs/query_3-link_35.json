        "text": "Robert Kim, Class of 1992\n\nThe law governing equity in education is shifting rapidly these days. So rapidly that, while completing a legal casebook, you joked recently that it’s hard “to type and delete at the same time.” Fortunately, you’re a multitasker. In addition to making preK-12 education policy as a public servant and working… Continue reading »\n\nMatthew Swanson, Class of 1997\n\nYou are, respectively, the illustrator and author of critically acclaimed, very popular children’s books. You are husband and wife. You are busy parents of four, living in a hayloft on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. You are also commercial salmon fishers in Alaska (although that is a whole ‘nuther story…).

You are busy parents of four, living in a hayloft on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. You are also commercial salmon fishers in Alaska (although that is a whole ‘nuther story…). Continue reading »\n\nRebecca G. Haile, Class of 1986\n\nA refugee forced at 11 to flee violence in your native Ethiopia, you and your family wound up in what must have seemed a strange and unlikely place: Minnesota. Some might describe your subsequent life and career as unlikely too. But you’ve never allowed yourself to be limited by likelihoods. Continue reading »\n\nPhilip O. Geier, Class of 1970\n\nHere’s a radical notion: An interdependent world is ill-served when leadership develops independently. If the first time a leader encounters another culture or perspective is during a conversation on the Red Phone, we’re all in trouble! You have made it your business to ensure that future leaders benefit from early,… Continue reading »\n\nThe Honorable Anita Earls, Class of 1981\n\nLiving as a biracial child adopted into a biracial family. Being a child in a family that integrated a previously all-white Seattle neighborhood. Helping organize students at this college to combat South African apartheid. These experiences and many more informed your understanding of race in society; all of them contributed… Continue reading »\n\nPamela Council, Class of 2007\n\nImagine a place of peace and protection in a time of trauma. Deep within it: a serene, colorful, multi-tiered fountain. Wrapped by pink and magenta clouds. Sheltered by silk. This sanctuary is shielded from the everyday, closed off from the noisy and the noisome by an 18-foot protective cocoon. That… Continue reading »\n\nLina M. Khan, Class of 2010\n\nWhen you edited The Williams Record, your job was to report the news. Now, as chair of the Federal Trade Commission, you’re making headlines, not writing them. Under your leadership, the FTC accused Facebook of pursuing an illegal “buy-or-bury” strategy to thwart competition. It stopped a $4.4 billion Lockheed Martin… Continue reading »\n\nAnouk Dey, Class of 2009, and Katherine Krieg Fischer, Class of 2008\n\nThe obstacles could have paralyzed you: You were here. The problem was there. You were young, just college students. The problem had roots centuries old. There were just two of you; hundreds of thousands needed help. None of that stopped you. Deeply concerned for Iraqi refugees fleeing to Jordan, you… Continue reading »\n\nElizabeth “Libby” Hohmann, Class of 1980\n\nThe early days of the Covid-19 pandemic were terrifying. Confirmed U.S. Covid deaths grew from eight—total—in early March 2020 to more than 1,000 every day just a month later. Three weeks after that, the death toll was often 2,000 a day or more. We knew little about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Continue reading »\n\nAdena Friedman, Class of 1991\n\nYou are, in your words, a true believer in capitalism. Well, no surprise there: You’re CEO of Nasdaq, one of the world’s most important market-making and financial technology companies. You see capitalism as a system for efficiently unlocking potential, for empowering the individual and for building a better society. But… Continue reading »\n\nBruce Grinnell, Class of 1962\n\nYou were just doing what you thought was right. For a humble, working class kid from Northampton, Massachusetts, it probably felt that simple. You couldn’t have known that your actions in the spring of 1961 would alter the trajectory of your college and etch your name into Williams… Continue reading »\n\nValerie DiFebo, Class of 1984\n\nYou know, you really shouldn’t be here. When you arrived in 1980, this place wasn’t made for students like you. A woman at a school still getting comfortable with co-education. A first-gen kid at a school still building its commitment to access. Someone who waitressed in… Continue reading »\n\nNancy Baker Cahill, Class of 1992\n\nIf public art is understood to be produced by a lone maker, of physical material, in a static location for passive viewers, then you are an utter failure. You have subverted all of these assumptions and more. Your augmented realities involve teams of artists and technicians, consist of… Continue reading »\n\nCraig R. Smith, Class of 1970\n\nYou and John Keats can now both be called physician/writers. Unlike you, Keats never performed quadruple bypass on a former president. But like him, you found, later in your career, the power of words to elevate the human spirit. They were extraordinary words for an extraordinary time. COVID-19 had thrust… Continue reading »\n\nChaédria LaBouvier, Class of 2007\n\nA socially engaged scholar needs insight, dedication, and, far too often, courage. While still growing up, your precocious eye could see, before many others did, the artistic and cultural importance of the work of Jean Michel Basquiat. You passionately devoted much of your time as an undergraduate and afterwards fitting… Continue reading »\n\nJason Hehir, Class of 1998\n\nWho’d a thunk that the talk of the sports world would one day be a self-described “six-foot, zero-inch lefthander who throws in the upper seventies”? But there you have been. By all accounts, you completely won the sports lockdown season, doing so from your seat in the director’s chair. As… Continue reading »\n\nWole C. Coaxum, Class of 1992\n\nIn the efforts to change systems that oppress communities of color, you stand at the forefront. In your case, those systems are the financial ones long understood but seldom acted upon that help to drive crushing disparities of wealth. Unavailable to one-third of Americans are the traditional banking services that… Continue reading »\n\nKiat W. Tan, Class of 1965\n\nThe journey began, you have said, at the age of eleven when you encountered your first orchid. Spellbound by this rare and fragile creature, you went on to dream of some day directing the Botanical Garden in your home of Singapore. That journey took an unexpected, and at the… Continue reading »\n\nDanielle Deane-Ryan, Class of 1997\n\nCommunities of color disproportionally bear the brunt of environmental injustice and are underrepresented in the rooms where environmental decisions are made. You have dedicated yourself to reversing the latter in order to eliminate the former. In a career spanning private industry, government, and philanthropy, your strong, persistent voice has… Continue reading »\n\nMartin A. Samuels, Class of 1967\n\nIf you wanted to go all in on relieving the suffering caused by diseases of the nervous system, what would you do? Well, you would start by developing your own skills in the art and science of clinical work and diagnosis. Then you would train generations of new clinicians… Continue reading »\n\nCarina Vance Mafla, Class of 1999\n\nPublic health concerns intersect with those of human rights, and it is that dynamic that you have chosen to focus on. From Williams you moved to San Francisco to support people with HIV. After earning a degree in public health you returned to Ecuador, where you advanced lesbian rights… Continue reading »\n\nShoshana Clark Stewart, Class of 2002\n\nYou certainly have a sense of adventure. From Williams you taught eighth-grade special education in Harlem before moving to schools in under-resourced areas of Boston and Honduras. This experience in cross-cultural settings you then put to dramatic use with Turquoise Mountain, the non-governmental organization founded by Britain’s Prince Charles to… Continue reading »\n\nMike Wynn, Class of 1993\n\nYou were the first, and are likely to be the last, Williams student ever to be handed a set of keys and told, “OK, you’re a campus safety officer now.” The times were different then, but so were you, who had earned such respect as a student employee of the… Continue reading »\n\nCheryl C. Robinson Joyner, Class of 1985\n\n“Thank God for cold winters.” With that unlikely thought, you have described how Arctic temperatures in Williamstown kept you indoors, watching this new thing called MTV, which then actually played music—music by artists that you could not have imagined would in time become your clients and colleagues. After Harvard Business… Continue reading »\n\nJohn Walcott, Class of 1971\n\nSometimes old-fashioned ways are what are called for. In positions at Newsweek, U.S. News, and The Wall Street Journal, you wore out plenty of shoe leather cultivating sources here and abroad, learning how institutions and governments work, and gaining a grasp of the big picture. When U.S. leaders geared up… Continue reading »\n\nMary Dana Hinton, Class of 1992\n\nIt was an inauspicious start to an academic career—being told by your rural North Carolina school to not even think about going to college because the only option for you as a Black woman would be the military. But a change of schools, made possible by the family that your… Continue reading »\n\nAdam Schlesinger, Class of 1989\n\nYou knew it might be wrong . . . but you were in love with the dream of a life in music. It began humbly with a summer gig, playing piano at The Seafood Shanty on Martha’s Vineyard, but, hey, things could only look up. And soon they did thanks… Continue reading »\n\nWendy Young, Class of 1983\n\nA test of a society is how well it treats children—a test that you are doing your best to help our nation pass. Tens of thousands of unaccompanied children arrive in the U.S. each year, fleeing war and gang violence or trying to reunite with a parent. They have no… Continue reading »\n\nRichard Besser, Class of 1981\n\nYour parents report that you were calmly reassuring even as a child. This steadiness amid storm has characterized much of your work, even literally when you assumed leadership of the Centers for Disease Control’s Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response two hours before Hurricane Katrina made landfall. Later, as… Continue reading »\n\nIra Mickenberg, Class of 1972\n\nYour goal at graduation was to become an activist lawyer. Well, mission accomplished. While representing countless indigent defendants, including before the U.S. Supreme Court, you chafed at the great flaw in the system. For the scales of justice to balance, the counsel for the prosecution and for the defense must… Continue reading »\n\nMaxine Burkett, Class of 1998\n\nWhen on PBS Charlie Rose asked you, while still in high school, what you wanted to be when you grew up, you immediately replied, “activist.” After Williams and Berkeley Law School, that ambition got revised to scholar/activist, with your path-breaking work focused on the intellectual, legal, moral, and practical lineaments… Continue reading »\n\nSharon Burke, Class of 1988\n\nNot many people get to create a new office in the Pentagon, but that you did as the first assistant secretary of defense for operational energy plans and programs. The department each year had been burning ninety million barrels of oil—draining resources, straining delivery systems, and increasing soldier vulnerability. It… Continue reading »\n\nJeff Speck, Class of 1985\n\nAn important front in the effort against climate change turns out to be the city. We humans are causing this crisis and most of us now live in urban areas, so the effort to transform our cities into sustainable communities is vital, and one of its preeminent thinkers and planners… Continue reading »\n\nBruce Beehler, Class of 1974\n\nIt was a red-bellied woodpecker. At the age of seven, looking up from a picnic table, you locked eyes on it, an experience, you have said, that changed your life forever. It was no surprise then that your senior thesis focused on bird life in the Adirondacks, and that a… Continue reading »\n\nEliot Coleman Jr., Class of 1961\n\nThe term “celebrity farmer” verges on oxymoron except in regard to you. A self-described hippie, you pursued rock climbing, skiing, and mountaineering before deciding that your next adventure would be, with no training or experience, to turn a rocky, wooded tract on coastal Maine into a working farm. With a… Continue reading »\n\nKristin Forbes, Class of 1992\n\nYou know someone is a real monetary policy wonk when she gets married at Bretton Woods—site of the post-war conference that established the current international financial order that you have come both to study and to shape.

Central Kitchen, which you have led for the past decade, has come to provide to a large percentage of that city’s residents meals that are healthy, affordable, and locally sourced—much of it using ingredients that would have gone to waste. These meals… Continue reading »\n\nClaudia Rankine, Class of 1986\n\n“Truth is such a rare thing,” Emily Dickinson said, “it is delightful to tell it.” Delightful perhaps to tell, but not always to hear, especially when, as in much of your writing, the truth is hard and the telling of it pierces the heart. Your genre-bending work, including the book-length… Continue reading »\n\nHernando Garzon, Class of 1984\n\nEarthquake in Haiti…tsunami in Sri Lanka…bombing in Oklahoma City…while nations are still reeling in shock and the world looks on aghast, you more often than not are already on the scene treating victims.

In addition to serving students at its Boston… Continue reading »\n\nEthan Zuckerman, Class of 1993\n\nWe forgive you.

The evidence is all there. Only a former Ephlat could imagine really belting it like Elsa.

Naficy, Class of 1991\n\nTiming, so some say, is everything. In your case, this began when as a child you fled Iran with your family on the eve of revolution.

Shulman, Class of 1989\n\nFor exhibiting wisdom beyond your years, you were chosen at an early age to serve as chief of staff for the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service.

Moomaw, Class of 1959\n\nWhen your Williams department chair asked back in 1969 if you’d consider developing a course in environmental chemistry, he could not have known that he had triggered a reaction that would have global impact.
