Available in two-door hatchback, notchback, wagon, and sedan delivery body styles, all models were powered by an inline four-cylinder engine designed specifically for the Vega, with a lightweight, aluminum alloy cylinder block. The Vega first went on sale in Chevrolet dealerships on September 10, 1970.[1] Variants included the Cosworth Vega, a short-lived limited-production performance model, introduced in the spring of 1975.[2]\n\nThe Vega received the 1971 Motor Trend Car of the Year.[3] Subsequently, the car became widely known for a range of problems related to its engineering,[4] reliability,[5] safety,[6][7] propensity to rust, and engine durability. Despite a series of recalls and design upgrades, the Vega's problems tarnished both its own as well as General Motors' reputation. Production ended with the 1977 model year.[8]"
