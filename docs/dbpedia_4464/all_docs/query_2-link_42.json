Carburetors were commonly used in older vehicles and smaller engines, but have since been replaced by modern fuel injection systems in most vehicles. The carburetor responds to changes in the accelerator pedal position to alter the amount of air coming into the engine and supplies the appropriate ratio of fuel for efficient combustion. As the speed of the vehicle changes, the carburetor's throttle plate either opens or closes, and fuel is drawn into the air stream via the venturi inside the carburetor throat or injected into the stream directly by the accelerator pump. Over time, a carburetor may accumulate a buildup of leftover fuel that can clog the carburetor jets, or the carburetor seals may wear out, crack, and develop fuel leaks. Carburetors also utilize needle and seat valves along with floats that allow the fuel bowl to be filled by the fuel pump, and to shut off the flow of fuel when it is filled to reduce the risk of flooding or fuel overflowing from the bowl. If you notice a rough idle, black exhaust smoke, backfires, trouble starting, or reduced performance and sluggish or delayed acceleration, there might be an issue with the carburetor. In many cases, a carburetor can be adjusted to compensate for some of these issues, or may need to be rebuilt or replaced completely depending on the extent of the wear or damage. Carburetor rebuild kits often supply the parts needed for routine cleaning and overhauling, but if the carburetor body or other non-wear parts have been severely damaged, it may be a good idea to replace the carburetor entirely. If you need to service your older vehicle's carburetor, shop O'Reilly Auto Parts, where we carry replacement carburetors, fuel filters, and carburetor rebuild kits for a complete fuel system repair."
