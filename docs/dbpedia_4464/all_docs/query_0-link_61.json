        "text": "The late Pontiac Enthusiast writer John Sawruk was one of Pontiac’s engineers who briefly worked on the X-4 back in the day. He speculated that the very detailed information gathered by Popular Mechanics must’ve been leaked on purpose. Plus, it was him who got his picture taken without him knowing.\n\nOne of the realities of having a favorite topic, in this case a particular brand, is that you soon learn all that there is to learn about it, especially if said brand is no longer with to make new things to learn about. It doesn’t help if one is only focused on a certain time period, which also limits what one can learn. So not only learning about the existence of the Pontiac X-4 not only came to a complete surprise, but also with a degree of happiness to learn something new about one of my favorite topics: Pontiac.\n\nWhat is a North-American car company to do with the nation’s fetishism for the Volkswagen Type I (you know, the Beetle), a car that even back in its inception was as far removed as a four-wheeled conventional automobile could be (rear-engine, torsion bar suspension, air-cooled, etc.)? Why not build one? Something that made the Chevrolet Corvair seem like a Buick.\n\nEnter the Pontiac X-4.\n\nThe name comes from the engine, which is definitely the heart of this machine, and for good reason. It’s just so unique and clever! For starters, it’s not even the staple of fuel-sipping economy car engines, the inline-4. It’s an air-cooled two-stroke, X-shaped, four-cylinder radial engine, said to be the descendant of pre-WWII experimental engine X259, a GM product that was a liquid-cooled, two-stoke radial engine that found its way in test cars (outside of the Popular Mechanics article, you won’t find anything on it. I checked. Feel free to prove me wrong). In short, it’s basically an airplane engine. But it isn’t.\n\nBefore we continue, we must step back and discuss that this engine is a four-cylinder radial engine. This type of engine has its cylinders placed around the crankshaft, instead of being arranged in a line or a ‘V’. By nature, radial engines have an odd number of cylinders (3, 7, 9, etc.) to make their designs work with the four-stroke firing order. The only exception to the rule would be if the engine worked with the two-stroke firing order, that’s when the radial engine went even (2, 4, 6, etc.). If you want to be pedantic, you could say that the X-4 radial engine is just two two-stoke flat-twin engines trying to be an ‘X’.\n\nBut what an ‘X’!\n\nWait a minute. Around that time period, apart from Saab and the Japanese kei-car market, two-strokes and economy cars only worked in the USSR, at the expense of air quality! Thought was taken to minimize the bad (creating oil-fuel mixtures, emissions issues, etc.) while retaining the good (less moving parts and cheaper to produce and maintain, even more so if it’s air-cooled due to the lack of radiator, hoses, liquids, etc.). This is one of the reasons why they adapted the Scotch yoke drive instead of trying to tame the existing piston-to-crankshaft design found on radial engines, regardless of cylinder count.\n\nFurther technical stuff:\n\nThe Scotch yoke drive eliminated unbalanced secondary forces, often a problem in a four-cylinder engine. It also allowed for the crankcase to be sealed off from the piston. This feature meant that pressure lubrication could be used versus normal two-cycle fuel-oil mixture. There was no fuel/air charge in the crankcase. There was also no need to provide in any way the usual fuel/oil mix used in a conventional two-cycle. With the X-4 engine’s design, no blow-by entered the crankcase, either.\n\n–John Sawruk, ‘Radial Rumination’, Pontiac Enthusiast magazine, March/April 2007\n\nIn other words, the Scotch yoke killed a number of birds with one stone. But it wasn’t the only feat of engineering used in civilizing the two-stroke firing order.\n\nThe combustion chamber was hemispherical, one of the most efficient designs in taking care of the combustion side of things. The headland-type compression rings helped with emissions, as well as help on the power side of things (sidenote: the piston is rigidly attached to the yoke, so only the piston rings touched the cylinder wall, leading to a simpler design, and probably eliminated any chance of piston slap).\n\nPopular Mechanics said that the engine installed in the car ran two Zenith side-draft carburetors, with other forms of carburation being tested on other engines. Pontiac Enthusiast magazine said that Pontiac also experimented with direct injection. This meant that better fuel delivery, improved airflow, even a form of cylinder deactivation all would have helped in reducing emissions best left at motorcycle racing events.\n\nPer the notes of Pontiac Engineering’s Advance Design‘s Leo Hilke, John Sawruk said that the X-4’s engine had room to grow, power-wise. The 151ci/2.3L engine produced about 80HP and 138lb-ft of torque, with 200lb-ft being the goal. Coupled with a single-speed transmission with torque converter (instead of the equipped three-speed transaxle reported on PM), 0-60mph was estimated at around 12 seconds. A production 1971 Volkswagen Super Beetle does 0-60 in 18 seconds!\n\nStage II modifications would’ve included (and I quote):\n\nA 4-inch reduction in engine diameter\n\nCooling ducts, integral with the bellhousing and lower crankcase\n\nSimpler intake and exhaust manifolds\n\nImproved cylinder cooling\n\n10 pound reduction in overall mass\n\nThe only thing that I noticed that wasn’t covered on either magazine was if or not any drawbacks of the radial engine on an automotive application have been remedied as well. The X-4 engine is compact, so it doesn’t have any issues fitting inside a car like more traditionally sized versions. It also seems that the oiling system would’ve avoided (or minimized, at the least) issues with the bottom cylinders, ranging from fouled plugs to hydrolocking by excessive oil. The X-4’s compact size, its relatively simple two-stroke nature and lack of water-cooling would offset whatever difficulty a radial engine’s construction might impose to those tasked with servicing it.\n\nAs for the car itself, Popular Mechanics said the following:\n\nIt was designed by Pontiac engineers.\n\nIt has ducts and a fan to further aid cooling.\n\nIt’s speculated that the roof came from a 1966 hardtop A-body. So did the bench seat, apparently. In fact, the project started in 1966 and was still being dabbled with in 1968. The PM issue was released in April 1969.\n\nThe aforementioned bench seat provided seating for 3.\n\nThe engine is mounted in mid-ship fashion, like a Formula 1 car.\n\nThe automatic transmission’s lever was floor-mounted. The floor itself is flat and spacious (no floor hump).\n\nTiny 6.2×12 tires.\n\nStandard instrumentation.\n\nPlenty of storage space in the ‘frunk’.\n\nCoil spring front suspension.\n\n47 inches in height.\n\nIt weighed around 1,500lbs, a couple hundred pounds heavier than the 1970 Honda Z/Honda 600 coupe.\n\nThere was one more hurdle to overcome, though: the rear suspension.\n\nLook at the second Popular Mechanics cover at the beginning. The engine and transmission are directly mounted to the rear axle. Regardless if the illustrations above show a shock absorber/coil spring set-up or how cushiony the X-4’s 6.2×12 tires were, it still meant that for the most part the expensive, complex machinery that is the internal combustion engine and its transmission would have been subjected to the same punishment as a live-rear-axle! No matter how smooth and peppy the X-4’s engine would’ve been, it would all be for naught if the rear suspension wasn’t remedied.\n\nInvesting in a proper independent rear suspension would’ve been paramount, perhaps taken from the much-improved second-gen Chevrolet Corvair and adapted it so that the engine didn’t stick out the back like said Corvair. Besides, I bet GM just didn’t want to hear about small car rear suspensions; they’ve had enough with the first-gen Corvair.\n\nPM did give examples of engines solidly mounted to live rear axles from Volvo, a Ford salt flats racer (I believe it’s this one) and a White delivery wagon (with that brand name, I can’t find any proper search results), but these were built with either specific environments in mind, or strictly slow speed affairs (the jury is out on the Volvo, there’s no info anywhere on it). If Pontiac chose or was forced to choose to make the prototype’s setup work for everyday use at acceptable speeds and environments expected for the X-4’s car-type category, but was found lacking, it would’ve hindered sales, with customers preferring to pay a little more for something more refined. And since Pontiac wouldn’t have a proper small car until the debut of the Pontiac Astre in 1974, those customers would go elsewhere, hindering Pontiac sales.\n\nWhoever would’ve been tasked to make the sales pitch on Pontiac’s behalf would have to convince the higher-ups to build a car with an engine that couldn’t be used in any other automotive application, that its two-stroke firing order could be civilized with the right tech to meet increasing air pollution controls, that a radial engine could work on cars and that it could be profitable.\n\nLooking at what GM was up to at the time, the X-4’s uphill battle to production would’ve been gargantuan. There’s the fact that GM was spending money elsewhere with their favorite new toy- the rotary engine, going as far as making production goals. A little before that, GM green-lighted the so-called technologically advanced 2300 engine for the H-bodies (Pontiac Astre and Chevrolet Vega). While today we know that these two were money pits in their own right, in the case of the rotary, it became a money pit due to its wasted potential despite years of experimentation, showing the final hurdle that the X-4 had to face: a GM that gave a damn. Particularly one where GM executive/engineer-at-heart Ed Cole was no longer in the picture. Pontiac, or any division for that matter, could’ve given GM a golden goose, but if the higher-ups only cared for chicken, they’d just shelf it under “ugly duckling”.\n\nThe X-4 remained nothing more than a prototype. As an engineering project, its outer beauty had yet to blossom to what it reflected inward. Hemmings.com and long-gone Pontiac Enthusiast have drawn parallels of the X-4 and the Pontiac Fiero, something that will continue to happen on future X-4 articles until the end of time (hopefully with more pics and info). If someone believed in the X-4 as much as executive Hulki Aldikacti believed in the Fiero, the X-4 would’ve drawn another parallel with it: the bending over backwards to build a clever little car that few cared about.\n\nEven if the thought of the X-4 making it to production was entertained, one can’t ignore the possibility of it being reworked to look a little more like a normal car, with bumpers and such. An European flair in its design would’ve been likely, since cars like the 2nd-gen F-bodies and the H-bodies had such styling cues, as well as cars like the Chevrolet Corvair and the cruelly cancelled Pontiac Banshee concepts. Maybe Pontiac should’ve just gone ahead and made it with a targa t-top convertible like the Corvette; cheap, open-air fun. If proven successful, would the X-4 have been expanded? Perhaps a four-door sedan built on an extended chassis? I doubt a wagon body style like the Chevrolet Corvair Lakewood/Monza Wagon due to its slow sales. If the Pontiac X-4 was greenlighted, success or fail, it would’ve truly have been the Fiero’s predecessor. As it is, it’s yet another piece of obscure Pontiac history that I can only hope to learn more from if further pics and information resurfaces. It’ll make for an interesting topic.\n\n–Tigerstrypes\n\nReferences:\n\nOpening pic compilation:\n\neBay"
