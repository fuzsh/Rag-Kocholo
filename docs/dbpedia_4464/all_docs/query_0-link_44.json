        "text": "Last Updated on March 13, 2023\n\nOur love for the past is obvious when we say things like “blast from the past,” or “Throwback Thursday”. There’s no denying too, that older cars bring these feelings of bliss and nostalgia. What are your favorite cars from the ‘70s and ‘80s that don’t exist anymore? Perhaps you’ve driven something on this list.\n\n1970\n\nBuick Estate, 1970-1990\n\nThe Buick Estate was a luxury full-size station wagon whose production years were from 1940 to 1964, and 1970 to 1996). This car was General Motors’s flagship station wagon entry, and was available as either a Roadmaster Estate or a Century Estate. At the time, the Estate was the largest Buick vehicle and was produced using the GM B platform. The vehicle combined luxury features with cargo-carrying capabilities. After 1996, Buick didn’t offer another station wagon in the US until 2018—the Buick Regal TourX.\n\n1971\n\nDodge Colt, 1971-1994\n\nThe Dodge Colt was a subcompact car available as a two-door pillared coupe, a two-door hardtop coupe, a four-door sedan, and a five-door wagon. It featured a traditional unibody layout with rear-wheel drive and a front engine (97.5 cubic inches and four cylinders). In 1973, sedans and coupes received a rounder body, while wagons continued with the old body. Early cars have small rectangular headlights in black inserts, while later models received more aerodynamic, flush-fitting units.\n\n1972\n\nLincoln Continental Mark IV, 1972-1976\n\nThe Lincoln Continental Mark IV was a personal luxury car. The vehicle shared its chassis, roofline, doors, and inner body panels with the Ford Thunderbird. All Mark IVs have a vinyl roof, hidden headlights, a radiator-style grille, and a Continental spare tire trunk lid. The Mark IV also introduced the opera window. For the 1974 model, the company added a five mph bumper, which pushed the rear lights into the rear bodywork.\n\n1973\n\nPontiac Grand Am, 1973-1975, 1978-1980, 1985-2005\n\nThe Pontiac Grand Am was originally a mid-size car but Pontiac later made it into a compact car. The ride was marketed as “the mid-sized Pontiac with Foreign Intrigue…American Ingenuity”. The car included both luxury and sport features, which was unusual in North America at the time. In 1980, Pontiac canceled the intermediate size Grand Am and it was succeeded by the Pontiac 6000. The compact version was reintroduced in 1985, replacing the Pontiac Phoenix, but was eventually replaced by the G6.\n\n1974\n\nFord Elite, 1974-1976\n\nThe Ford Elite is a personal luxury car that went by the name Gran Torino Elite for its first model year before dropping “Gran Torino”. The mid-size two-door coupe is based on the Ford Torino, and was intended to be a junior model to the Ford Thunderbird. Ford achieved good sales during the car’s three-year run—placing third in its category. For model year 1977, Ford applied the Thunderbird nameplate to a restyled Elite and discontinued the larger Thunderbird.\n\n1975\n\nMercury Grand Marquis, 1975-2011\n\nThe Mercury Grand Marquis was first introduced as the premium model of the Mercury Marquis line of full-size sedans, but it eventually became a standalone model line in 1983. Beginning with model year 1979, the Grand Marquis shared the rear-wheel drive Panther platform as the Lincoln Town Car and the Ford (LTD) Crown Victoria. On January 4, 2011, Ford produced the last Grand Marquis and the last Mercury-branded vehicle.\n\n1976\n\nPontiac Sunbird, 1976-1994\n\nThe Pontiac Sunbird was introduced as the eventual replacement for the Pontiac Astre. It was offered as a two-door notchback coupe, a three-door hatchback, and a station wagon. The first generation of the Sunbird used the subcompact GM H platform, but following generations used the compact GM J platform. Pontiac didn’t release a model in 1981, and renamed the 1982 model—J2000. The Sunbird name returned for model year 1984. The following year, it was redesigned and renamed the Pontiac Sunfire.\n\n1977\n\nChrysler LeBaron, 1977-1995\n\nThe Chrysler LeBaron was a luxury vehicle built on the Dodge Aspen platform (F-body), but with an M-body shell. The first-year models were available as coupes and sedans. Chrysler introduced a Town & Country station wagon in 1978. In 1981, it was offered in a police package. And in 1982, the LeBaron model name was moved to the new front-wheel drive K-platform and the M-body LeBaron sedan became the Chrysler New Yorker.\n\n1978\n\nDodge Omni, 1978-1990\n\nThe Dodge Omni is the first Chrysler model line produced with front-wheel drive. This subcompact car is also Chrysler’s only world car designed by Chrysler. Chrysler Europe developed the five-door hatchback Chrysler Horizon. That vehicle became available in North America as either a Dodge Omni or Plymouth Horizon. In 1978, Chrysler sold Chrysler Europe to PSA Peugeot Citroën, but retained the rights to the Chrysler Horizon/Dodge Omni.\n\n1979\n\nFord Durango, 1979-1990\n\nDon’t blame yourself if you’ve never heard of the Ford Durango—not Dodge Durango. This two-passenger coupe utility is the result of a joint venture between Ford and travel service National Coach Works. The latter used the body of the Ford Fairmont Futura two-door coupe to design the Ford Durango. It was designed to compete against a newly downsized Chevrolet El Camino.\n\n1980\n\nFord LTD Crown Victoria, 1980-1991\n\nThe Ford LTD Crown Victoria was a line of full-size cars. It was offered as a two-door and a four-door sedan, and a five-door station wagon. In 1983, Ford changed all of its full-size cars to mid-size cars except for the LTD Crown Victoria—keeping its rear-wheel drive Ford Panther platform. The LTD Crown Victoria, and its successor—the Ford Crown Victoria—were popular among law enforcement agencies.\n\n1981\n\nFord Escort, 1981-2003\n\nThe Ford Escort succeeds the Ford Pinto, and is the first world car developed by Ford. It was introduced as a subcompact before being modified into a compact for the last two of three generations. It became the best-selling car in the United States for most of the 1980s. After 2000, the four-door Escort was sold primarily as fleet vehicles.\n\n1982\n\nOldsmobile Cutlass Cierra, 1982-1996\n\nThe Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera is a mid-size car that came available as a two-door coupe, four-door sedan, and four-door Cutlass (Ciera) Cruiser station wagon. It featured a MacPherson strut front suspension, body-color urethane bumpers, flush-mounted glass, front-wheel drive, and fuel injection. By 1988, Oldsmobile began reducing the number of vehicle options and configurations until only two trim levels and two body styles—the sedan and wagon—remained.\n\n1983\n\nDodge Charger, 1983-1987\n\nThe Dodge Charger is a subcompact, three-door hatchback/fastback. It’s a sporty version of the Dodge Omni but rebranded as a Charger, which was the name of a performance package on the Omni 024. Automotive designer and race car driver Carroll Shelby developed a sporty version of the Charger and badged it the Shelby—not Dodge—Charger Turbo. Rather than focusing on speed, Shelby modified the suspension and styling.\n\n1984\n\nDodge Daytona, 1984-1993\n\nThe Dodge Daytona was a front-wheel drive hatchback. Its name was derived from the Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, Florida. Daytona was originally available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo, and Turbo Z. In 1986, Dodge discontinued the Turbo trim. Then in 1987, the Daytona was restyled and a new trim level was introduced—the Shelby Z . For 1990, all Daytonas received a more modern interior. The 1995 Dodge Avenger eventually took the Daytona’s place.\n\n1985\n\nNot a single one of these car manufacturers introduced a new car to the US market in 1985.\n\n1986\n\nMercury Sable, 1986-2009\n\nThe Mercury Sable was a front-wheel drive mid-size car. It replaced the Mercury Marquis, which was rear-wheel drive. It was developed alongside the Ford Taurus as part of a $3.5 billion project—the most costly development Ford had ever undertaken at the time. The Sable survived five generations, but was discontinued in 2009 due to declining sales.\n\n1987\n\nOldsmobile Touring Sedan, 1987-1993\n\nThe Oldsmobile Touring Sedan is a full-size car. It was sold exclusively as a four-door sedan and built using the front-wheel drive GM C-platform. The Touring Sedan targeted buyers of import luxury sports sedans. In 1991, the Touring Sedan was reintroduced as the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Touring—a performance-oriented trim level. The exterior changed into something monochromatic instead of two-tone, and all chrome was deleted.\n\n1988\n\nDodge Dynasty, 1988-1993\n\nThe Dodge Dynasty is a mid-size four-door sedan. The Dynasty used the front-wheel drive Chrysler C/AC platform and was one of the largest Chrysler K-car variants. Trim levels included base, Premium (1988 only), and LE. Dodge introduced a Brougham package (1992-93 LE models) that included a padded “landau” vinyl roof. Its appearance was boxy and conservative compared to its competitors. And although the Dynasty was fairly popular, it only lasted two generations.\n\n1989\n\nPlymouth Acclaim, 1989-1995\n\nThe Plymouth Acclaim is a mid-size sedan. Its four-door sedan AA-body is based on Chrysler’s extended K-car platform and it was one of the last K-car derivatives produced by Chrysler. The Acclaim was initially available in three trims: base, LE (mid-range), and LX (high-end). However, the base model accounted for more than 80 percent of Acclaim sales. The Acclaim was replaced by the Plymouth Breeze in 1996.\n\nCars from the ‘70s\n\nBuick Centurion 1970-1973\n\nBuick GSX 1970-1972\n\nFord Maverick 1970-1979\n\nMercury Capri 1970-1994\n\nPlymouth Duster 1970-1976\n\nPlymouth Superbird 1970-1970\n\nDodge Demon (1971–1972)\n\nFord Pinto 1971-1980\n\nOldsmobile Custom Cruiser Wagon 1971-1992\n\nPlymouth Cricket 1971-1973\n\nPontiac Grand Safari 1971-1978\n\nPontiac Grand Ville 1971-1975\n\nPontiac Ventura II 1971-1972\n\nBuick Apollo 1973-1975\n\nOldsmobile Omega 1973-1984\n\nPontiac Astire 1973-1979\n\nBuick Skyhawk 1974-1989\n\nDodge Lancer Celeste, 1975–1981)\n\nMercury Bobcat 1974-1980\n\nPlymouth Colt 1974-1994\n\nPlymouth Trail Duster 1974-1981\n\nPlymouth Voyager / Grand Voyager 1974-2000\n\nChrysler Cordoba 1975-1983\n\nFord Granada 1975-1982\n\nPlymouth Fran Fury 1975-1989\n\nDodge Aspen (1976–1980)\n\nPlymouth Volare/ 1976-1980\n\nPontiac Sunbird 1976-1994\n\nChrysler Sunbeam 1977-1979\n\nLincoln Continental Mark V (1977–1979)\n\nPontiac Phoenix 1977-1984\n\nDodge Colt Challenger, 1978–1983)\n\nDodge Magnum (1978–1979, 2005–2008)\n\nFord Fairmount 1978-1983\n\nMercury Zephyr 1978-1983\n\nPlymouth Arrow 1978-1980\n\nPlymouth Horizon 1978-1990\n\nPlymouth Sapporo 1978-1983\n\nDodge St. Regis (1979–1981)\n\nDodge Omni 024 (1979–1982)\n\nPlymouth Champ 1979-1982\n\nPlymouth TC3 1979-1982\n\nCar’s from the ‘80s\n\nDodge Mirada (1980–1983)\n\nLincoln Continental Mark VI (1980–1983)\n\nDodge Aries (1981–1989)\n\nMercury Lynx 1981-1987\n\nPlymouth Reliant 1981-1989\n\nPontiac T100 1981-1987\n\nDodge 400 (1982–1983)\n\nFord EXP 1982-1988\n\nMercury LN7 1982-1983\n\nOldsmobile Firenze 1982-1988\n\nPontiac 6000 1982-1991\n\nPontiac Sunbird J2000 / 2000, 1982-1984\n\nChrysler E-Class 1983-1984\n\nChrysler Executive 1983-1986\n\nChrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue 1983-1983\n\nDodge 600 (1983–1988)\n\nDodge Colt Vista, 1983–1991)\n\nPlymouth Caravelle 1983-1988\n\nPlymouth Scamp 1983-1983\n\nPlymouth Turismo 1983-1987\n\nBuick Somerset 1984-1987\n\nChrysler Fifth Avenue 1984-1989\n\nDodge Conquest (1984–1986 as rebadged Mitsubishi Starion)\n\nLincoln Continental Mark VII (1984–1985)\n\nMercury Topaz 1984-1994\n\nOldsmobile Cutlas Calais 1984-1991\n\nPlymouth Colt Vista 1984-1994\n\nPlymouth Conquest 1984-1986\n\nPontiac Fiero 1984-1988\n\nLincoln Mark VII (1986–1992)\n\nBuick Reatta 1987-1991\n\nChrysler Conquest 1987-1989\n\nDodge Shadow (1987–1994)\n\nPlymouth Sundance 1987-1994\n\nChrysler Shadow 1988-1994\n\nChrysler Grand Voyager 1988-2007\n\nDodge Dynasty (1988–1993)\n\nMercury Tracer 1988-1999\n\nDodge Spirit (1989–1995)\n\nFord Probe 1989-1997"
