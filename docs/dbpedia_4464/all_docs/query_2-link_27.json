        "meta_description": "A Pontiac dealer in 1977 must have been a very confusing place to visit.  On the fancy side of the dealership you could get a full sized Bonneville, Safari, Grand Prix, and the recently downsized Catalina..which was now on par in size with a LeMans.  One your way past the performance oriented Firebird you would find smaller cars like the Phoenix and the Ventura...but eventually you'd stumble upon a few unloved things in the corner including a subcompact Sunbird and the Astre.  Where did all of these cars fit in the realm of GM's Chevy, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, GMC, Buick, Cadillac brands?...I think you'd need a pivot table to properly understand it. But here is what you need to understand -- this is a Vega powered by Pontiac's iron duke 4-cylinder...which is the only reason it is still on the road because those alloy block engines in the Vega were dreadful.
