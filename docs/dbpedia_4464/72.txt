In 1980, the Pontiac Phoenix was downsized and moved to front wheel drive, and was available as 2-door coupe or this 5-door hatchback which in 1983 recieved a minor exterior refresh.

Available engines were a 2.5 L 4 cylinder and a 2.8 L V6, mated to a 3 speed automatic or 4 speed manual transmission. This second generation was built from 1980 to 1985 and then replaced with the Grand Am.

For 1978 and 1979, the station wagon from the discontinued Astre series was added to the Sunbird line, as seen here in this 1979 Pontiac Sunbird Sport Safari Station Wagon example. They continued to use the same front fascia as the Astre with Sunbird badging. The 2.3 L engine was simultaneously discontinued.

For the 1979 model year, the Chevrolet‘s 5.0 L (305 cid) V8 engine was made optional in the notchback and hatchback, while the Sunbird Safari wagon continued for its final year with a revised vertical styled grill. The 1979 engine options included the 305-V8, 3.8L-V6 and an 2.5L-I4. (image source: coconv)

The 1981 Pontiac T-1000 was produced until 1987 on GM’s T-Platform. It had either a 1.4 or 1.6 L OHC gasoline I4 engine producing from 53 to 70 horsepower. It was pretty much identical to the Chevette, but of course had unique grille, body molding and vertical lined taillights. Here you see a 3-door and 5-door model. (image source: John Lloyd)

The 1974 Astre Hatchback GT from Pontiac was their Canadian built small economy car (which was a Vega with Pontiac trim) available only in Canada from 1973 to 1974, but was then brought to the US in 1975. Its lightweight aluminum engine was easy on gas. The interior included Premier plaid cloth and vinyl trim on deep full-foam seats. It came in three models, the hatchback shown here, as well as a coupe and a Safari station-wagon.
