LORDSTOWN, Ohio, July 22 (AP)—The world's fastest auto production center, slowed by lack of demand for the Chevrolet Vega and Pontiac Astre subcompacts it produced,’ rolled to a halt today as the General Motors Corporation prepared to restyle and rename the economy cars.

With the shutdown came the elimination of one body type—the least‐popular coupe—and the end of a controversial motor: the industry's only all‐aluminum engine.

When the plant resumes operation Aug. 22, the station wagon and hatchback bodies that have borne the Vega and Astre nameplates will have been restyled and merged into the sportier and more expensive Chevrolet Monza, Pontiac Sunbird, Oldsmobile Starfire and Buick Skyhawk lines derived from the Vegas.
