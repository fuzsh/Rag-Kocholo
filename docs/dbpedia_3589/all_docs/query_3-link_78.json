Her research interests include Postcolonial Literature and Postcolonial Life Writing, Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Counterstory, Critical Discourse Analysis and Rhetorical Analysis.\n\nMaab cherishes her coffee accompanied by reading and writing and admires watching documentary crime shows in her free time – if such time can be captured in any way… Her motto during her academic journey is: if your studies scare you with their mounting complexity, and infinite amount, scare them back with your passionate motivation, solid determination and ferocious organization! – At the end, the victory is all yours!\n\nEmail: a2altahe@uwaterloo.ca\n\nAyesha Altaher completed a BA (English Literature) at AAU and her MA (Literary Studies) at UWaterloo. Ayesha is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the department of English Language and Literature at the University of Waterloo. Her secondary field of research is Composition Studies and Pedagogy, and her primary research interest is American Literature. Ayesha is interested in exploring cultural productions, particularly literary texts, by African, Muslim, and Arabic speaking people who were forcefully relocated to the United States (enslaved) or immigrated between the late 1700s and early 1900s, as well as the representations of these groups circulating in North America print culture at the time. Ayesha is interested in how this history challenges what it means to be American.\n\nEmail: becky.anderson\n\nTwitter: @beckyanderson35\n\nLinkedIn: Becky Anderson\n\nBecky Anderson (she/her) completed a BA (English; French Studies), MA (Literary Studies), and GDip (Cognitive Science) at Waterloo. Becky is the recipient of the Provost Doctoral Entrance Award; a Jack Gray Fellowship; a W.K. Thomas Graduate Scholarship; two Ontario Graduate Scholarships; and a SSHRC Doctoral Fellowship.

He comes from a film and television background with a drive to extend documentary storytelling into new media, particularly locative augmented reality. His masters research project “The Civic Monument Reinvented and Extended through Enfranchising Documentary AR” explored how augmented reality can alter the narrative potential of civic spaces, particularly by enfranchising traditionally marginalized voices in the context of civic monuments. Jonathan’s current research continues this exploration of “Space, Time and Story” viewing AR as an opportunity to promote community, belonging, civil discourse and cultural understanding by creating meaningful ‘places’ around us, healing the schism of the dual universes we inhabit (the physical and the digital). To this end he’s exploring the cognitive underpinnings of narrative, the effects of stereoscopy and developing a new locative-documentary grammar. Jonathan received the Graduate Grade Average Award (2017-2018) and he is an enthusiastic teacher.\n\nEmail: mbano@uwaterloo.ca\n\nMahnoor Bano is a Ph.D. student in the department of English Language and Literature. She completed her BS Hons and MPhil from Pakistan working on Historiography and the female self in Postcolonial Literature.\n\nAs a Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo, Mahnoor’s research interests include postcolonial and post-partition narrative produced by female authors focusing on South Asian and African Literature particularly. Mahnoor is mainly interested in exploring thedivide seen between the literature produced by women and men and the themes it explored in connection to colonization and the partition of the subcontinent. In doing so, the work aims to centralize the marginalized female narrative while tracing the notion of ‘subaltern female self’.\n\nEmail: smcasey@uwaterloo.ca\n\nSarah Casey is an English PhD student at the University of Waterloo, with over fifteen years experience as a communications professional in the health, wellness and fitness industry. Her research project, Alternative Risk, focuses on the rhetoric of risk and disinformation, engaging with the study of risk across disciplines (sociology, anthropology, political and management sciences) to understand how risk discourse contributes to social and political polarization. She holds an MA in English (Rhetoric and Communication Design) and a BA in Rhetoric, Media, and Professional Communication, both from the University of Waterloo.\n\nSarah is an honoured recipient of the Michael Purves-Smith Paper Award from The Canadian Society for the Study of Rhetoric (2024), the UW Beltz PhD Essay Prize (2024), the Provost Doctoral Entrance Award for Women (2023) and the UW English Master’s Essay Prize (2023), and has served as a research assistant on multiple federally funded research grants.\n\nIn her spare time, Sarah can be found on the squash court, where she will be joining the Waterloo Warriors squash team for the 2024-2025 season.\n\nEmail: jdipalo@uwaterloo.ca\n\nJulia-Rose DiPalo is a PhD student in English Language and Literature at the University of Waterloo with a BA Hons (English Literature and History) from Trent University and MA (English and Film Studies) from Wilfrid Laurier University. Julia’s research is based on Canadian Literature with a keen focus on Italian Canadian women’s immigrant narratives, both fiction and non-fiction. Moreover, she is very interested in what these narratives can say about how multiculturalism functions in Canada for both, immigrants, and first-generation Italian Canadians. She takes great pride in telling the stories of her family members, ancestors, and others who underwent a similar plight on their way to Canada.\n\nEmail: hkdown@uwaterloo.ca\n\nHaley Down (she/her) is a poet and PhD student in English with an MA (Wild Writing) from the University of Essex and a BKI (Knowledge Integration) from the University of Waterloo. Her areas of interest are creative writing, eating studies, and gender and queer studies. Haley’s research is focussed on contemporary women’s writing about hunger and appetite, particularly that which is free of shame and full of enjoyment.\n\nHaley has been a recipient of the Provost Doctoral Entrance Award for Women. She is currently pursuing the Fundamentals of University Teaching certificate through the Centre for Teaching Excellence.\n\nIn addition to her doctoral studies, Haley is an assistant editor and contributing writer for Blank Spaces magazine.\n\nEmail: kduvvoor@uwaterloo.ca\n\nTwitter: @KaviDuvvoori\n\nWebsite: https://kavid.xyz/semiprof/\n\nKavi Duvvoori is a PhD candidate researching the algorithmic mediation of language.\n\nHow is it that people seem to talk with software systems like large textual models (such as ChatGPT and similar vast apparatuses joining material infrastructures, human labor, data, and algorithms) and what effects may this have on language itself? How can these systems’ harms be resisted or how could language technologies be made differently? They are approaching these questions through experiments in computational rhetoric influenced by construction grammars; through the study of algorithmic delivery and elocution; and through research/creation in conversation with queer and feminist media studies.\n\nThey studied math (Sc.B) and literary arts (A.B. Hon.) at Brown, and digital arts and new media (MFA) at UC Santa Cruz. They have a practice of writing prose and poetry with code and computational elements, with pieces in Taper, the Language Arts Observer, and the Electronic Literature Organization Conference, and a residency at the Banff Centre. Talk to them also about OrganizeUW, the campaign to form a union for teaching and research assistants at UW.\n\nTheir non-professional interests include speculative fiction, lists, linguistics, the limits of language, birds, borders, the search for ways of being that reject hierarchy and domination, simulation games, sketching,literary constraint, and sauteing. What does the language game of a profile blurb do, what does it say in implication, what does it limit and obscure?\n\nEmail: ceckert@uwaterloo.ca\n\nCarolyn Eckert, BA (English at Waterloo) and MA (Experimental Digital Media at Waterloo) is a PhD student in the department of English Language and Literature. Bridging studies in English and Communication Departments, the Rhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine (RSTM) is the field of study where I situate my research into how messages are crafted for persuasive effect and where those messages may fail. Broadly, my research investigates 1) who produces news content about pandemics (e.g., traditional news media, citizen journalists, public health officials, political leaders) 2) persuasive strategies used to inform and engage audiences and 3) intended and unintended communication impact of these messages on compliance (or resistance). This research explores pandemic rhetoric and examines figural language and argument from the perspective of Canada’s history of epidemics and pandemics, including the Spanish Flu, Polio, SARs and H1N1 as a comparative analysis to COVID-19. Following a twenty-plus year career in communications, public relations and marketing, she returned to the University of Waterloo to complete her MA (2020), begin her PhD (2020) and continues to teach part-time for Conestoga College and the Humber College School of Business. In 2021, she joined the Graduate Studies Endowment Fund (GSEF) as the graduate student Arts representative on the Project Review Committee, to review and approve funding projects that improve the graduate student experience.\n\nEmail: gwfemia@uwaterloo.ca\n\nTwitter: @_foolsbait\n\nGiuseppe Femia is an English PhD Candidate at the University of Waterloo. He previously completed a double major for his Bachelor of Arts, in English, Rhetoric, Media, and Professional Communication & Honours Arts and Business, as well as a Master of Arts, in Rhetoric and Communication Design, both at Waterloo.\n\nGiuseppe’s current research in game studies, media studies, queer studies, disability studies, and performance studies observes different types of gaming media and the appeal it has to its audience. He previously presented his work on queer reparative play and Dungeons & Dragons at the Transformative Play Initiative Seminar in Visby, Sweden, and then had it published as a peer-reviewed article in the International Journal of Role-Playing. His current observes disability representation and disabling mechanics in TTRPG narratives and systems.\n\nGiuseppe is now partnering up with other scholars researching the intersection of disability studies and game studies to broaden the horizons of the growing field.\n\nEmail: afraniczek@uwaterloo.ca\n\nAleksander Franiczek completed his BA and MA in English Literature at Western University and is currently a PhD candidate for the University of Waterloo’s English program. His doctoral research synthesizes perspectives from game studies, phenomenology, narrative theory, and critical design to consider how a player's sense of immersion in the world of a videogame can provide a means towards self-reflection through creative engagements both during and outside gameplay. As a member of both the Games Institute and Critical Media Lab, he is interested in exploring critical and alternative approaches to analyzing gameplay experiences that focalizes how personal meaning is generated in the meeting between player and program. He also helps other game enthusiasts publish their work as the Section Head of Essays at First Person Scholar, where he also features on the journal’s podcast.\n\nEmail: k2gerber@uwaterloo.ca\n\nKyle Gerber, BA (Laurier) MA (Waterloo) BEd (Laurier), is a PhD candidate in the department of English Language and Literature. He works under the supervision of Dr. Randy Harris on a dissertation titled \"Figures of Forgiveness: Rhetorical Foundations of the Mennonite Ethos of Forgiveness.\" Kyle is a recipient of the W. K. Thomas Graduate Scholarship, several Ontario Graduate Scholarships, and is the grateful recipient of a SSHRC Doctoral Scholarship. He enjoys teaching courses in rhetoric, academic writing, and science communication, and has several nominations for the TA Award for Excellence in Teaching. Kyle enjoys collaboration and academic community, and serves on the executive committee for RhetCanada. Previous research collaborations include working with RhetFig at the intersections of rhetorical figures and AI/NLP, the Critical Media Lab, and an expanded Mennonite/s Writing bibliographic database.\n\nHe is interested in rhetoric (especially Burkean) and understandings of forgiveness, as well as Canadian Literature (especially “Mennonite” writing): the question at the nexus of these interests is “what action do we symbolize when we say ‘I forgive’?” In particular, his interest has broadened to include figuration, so a central question he is pursuing is \"what rhetorical figures cluster around statements of forgiveness?\" When not taking up space on campus, Kyle enjoys working with his wife Tracy to care for their three daughters, serving as an associate pastor at a church near Wellesley, and moonlighting as a mandolin player in his side-hustle bluegrass band.\n\nEmail: kasturi.ghosh1@uwaterloo.ca\n\nKasturi Ghosh is a PhD candidate in the Department of English Language and Literature at UW. Focusing on the portrayal of vampires and other monstrous entities created by Anne Rice, Poppy Z. Brite, and Charlaine Harris, her research studies contemporary Gothic Fiction of the American South, reading it as a body of fiction that reflects both the homogeneous identity forced upon the region and the uncanny re-emergence of its global past and its diverse population. This approach complements psychoanalytical approaches by tracing the changing socio-political imaginary of the American South and its influence on the Southern Gothic, which, by the end of the 20th century, came to challenge the region’s supposedly uniform cultural and political identities. She has presented her research at international conferences like the IAMAS, NEPCA, SFU-IGA, and Louisville Conference on Lit. and Culture. Kasturi has served as the International Student Representative of SAGE for three terms (2021-2024).\n\nPrior to coming to UW for her PhD in 2020, Kasturi served as an Assistant Professor of English for eight years in her home country, India. She holds an MPhil and an MA in English from Jadavpur University Kolkata, another MA in Women’s and Gender Studies from IGNOU, New Delhi, and a BA Honours in English from Loreto College Kolkata, India. She has published papers in peer-reviewed journals. Her interests are Gothic Studies, Gender Studies, Popular Literature and Culture, and Adaptation Studies.\n\nEmail: z2jafari@uwaterloo.ca\n\nZahra Jafari is a fourth-year PhD candidate of Rhetoric in the department of English Language and Literature. She completed her BA in English Language and Literature and her first MA in Translation Studies, both at University of Isfahan. She did a second MA in Rhetoric and Communication Design at the University of Waterloo. Currently, she is working on her dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Michael MacDonald. Her project is a comparative, multimodal analysis of the representation of Iranian women in media. Zahra’s book chapter titled “Iranian Women and the Media: The Good, the Bad, and the Untold” has appeared in Minority Women and Western Media: Challenging Representations and Articulating New Voices.\n\nSome of her academic interests include: Rhetoric, Women’s Studies, Metaphor Studies, Postcolonial Literature, Shakespeare, 19th-century British Literature, and Translation Quality Assessment (TQA).\n\nEmail: mnpjohns@uwaterloo.ca\n\nMelissa Johnson is a PhD student in the Department of English Language and Literature. Her dissertation examines how the rhetorical history of hysteria has informed and continues to inform current societal and medical perceptions of contemporary women with illness and/or disability. Melissa graduated with distinction from Western University with a BA (Hons.) in English and a Minor in Sociology. She received her MA in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of Northern British Columbia where she examined the negative social and health ramifications of disseminating, legitimating, and perpetuating pathologizing discursive representations of Indigenous peoples in Canadian media. Melissa is the recipient of the Provost Doctoral Entrance Award (2018/2019). She is also an Executive Member of the Student Association for Graduates in English (SAGE) serving as Equity Liaison (2019/2020). She is committed to investigating inequities and oppression, violence, discourse and power, and especially, ableism.\n\nEmail:clawerence@uwaterloo.ca\n\nDuring my undergraduate studies at Carleton I double majored in English Literature and Linguistics, and played a lot of video games. During my Masters in English Literature at Carleton I specialized in science fiction and dystopia, and played a lot of video games. At some point I realized that I ought to combine these interests.\n\nVideo games are everywhere now: in books, in film, on your TV, on your phone, in the classroom, in the workplace. I want to make sense of their impact on our lives. People today spend as much time playing games as they might have spent reading books fifty years ago. How does that restructure our cognition? McKenzie Wark summarizes that “Games are no longer a pastime, outside or alongside of life. They are now the very form of life, and death, and time itself.\" So \"play\" isn't just about play anymore. Play has become work.\n\nI believe that it's essential to understand how we are using what we learn in games to approach challenges in our real lives. To plead ignorance is to allow external forces to co-opt those influences and manipulate them in their favour. Nick Dyer-Witheford and Grieg de Peuter warn that \"video games are a paradigmatic media of empire.\" To this I ask: what is our alternative? How can we take this cognitive capital back from the gamified office and leverage it positively? Big questions. I can't answer them on my own. That's why I'm here at the University of Waterloo.\n\nEmail: k4lubin@uwaterloo.ca\n\nKem-Laurin Lubin is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Waterloo, where she focuses on Artificial Intelligence (AI) biases and how their inherent discursivity informs the material effect on the lived experience of people, particularly the marginalized. Her research is predicated on the idea that technology is nothing short of a digital colony, mathematizing and amplifying the analogic biases and that an understanding of how AI models work can better inform how they make decisions, void of bias but also to further hermeneutic methods of assessing AI models as advanced textual forms. She is also the 2021-2022 OGS/QEII-GSST Scholarship (2021-2022) as well as President’s Graduate Scholarship (PGS) 2021. Kem-Laurin completed an Honours B.A. at the University of Ottawa and an M.A in the Rhetoric and Professional Writing stream at the University of Waterloo.\n\nEmail: dmorenoo@uwaterloo.ca\n\nLinkedIn: Diana Moreno Ojeda\n\nDiana Moreno Ojeda, BA (Art History and Theory; Philosophy minor, Los Andes University), MA (English Language Teaching, University of Tabriz), and MA (Rhetoric and Communication Design, University of Waterloo) is a PhD candidate at the University of Waterloo.\n\nHer research work is anchored at the intersection of Attitude, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Cognitive Narratology. More specifically, Diana looks at how authors deploy patterns of Attitude in science fiction to present their evaluation of AI to their readers. Attitudinal appraisal is ultimately a device for the positioning of discussions on the cultural value of our technological artifacts and their construction; but, also, for the exploration of our current definitions of intelligence, reason, and cognition.\n\nDiana is also Associate Editor of Essays for First Person Scholar, and she enjoys cooperative table-top games just as much as reading Science and Speculative Fiction.\n\nEmail: ddpinhei@uwaterloo.ca\n\nTwitter: @DakotaPinheiro\n\nDakota Pinheiro (he/him) is a PhD Candidate and Sessional Instructor in the Department of English Language and Literature and a Graduate Educational Developer (GED) for the Centre for Teaching Excellence. He completed his BA in Honours English Literature at the University of Waterloo and his MA in English at the University of Toronto. He has also completed the Fundamentals of University Teaching (FUT) certificate and is currently completing his Certificate in University Teaching (CUT) from the Centre for Teaching Excellence.
