        "text": "The U.S. defers in the choice of an interim president.\n\nBAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqi officials prevailed in their choice for president over the candidate favored by the United States, allowing a U.N. envoy yesterday to appoint an interim government reflecting Iraq's religious and cultural diversity to rule after the return of sovereignty June 30.\n\nGhazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer, a Sunni Muslim critic of the occupation, was named to the largely ceremonial post. Al-Yawer was the choice of the U.S.-picked Iraqi Governing Council, which dissolved itself immediately so that the new government can start work even before it takes power from the American-led coalition at the end of the month.\n\nAmong its first tasks will be to negotiate a crucial agreement on the status of U.S.-led international forces that will remain in Iraq after sovereignty is restored and to tackle the country's tenuous security situation.\n\nAt the U.N. Security Council yesterday, the United States and Britain circulated a revised resolution that would give the interim government control over the Iraqi arm police and end the mandate for the multinational force by January 2006 at the latest.\n\nCritics - namely France, Russia and Germany - had said the previous U.S. resolution did not go far enough in granting Iraqis genuine power over their own national affairs. Iraq's new foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, was traveling to New York yesterday to join the debate.\n\nBombings continueStrong explosions rolled through the heart of the capital even as word emerged of al-Yawer's selection. A car bomb at the headquarters of a pro-American Kurdish party killed three people, wounded about 20 and sent a mushroom cloud of smoke rising over the capital.\n\nA car bomb also exploded outside a U.S. base in the northern town of Beiji, killing 11 Iraqis and wounding more than 22 people, including two U.S. soldiers. Fighting broke out between American soldiers and radical Shiite militiamen in the southern town of Kufa and a Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad.\n\nThe new Cabinet - a prime minister, a deputy premier for securit 31 ministers who include six women - will take over day-to-day operations of government ministries immediately, although the U.S.-run Coalition Provisional Authority remains the sole sovereign power in Iraq until June 30.\n\nBritish-educated Shiite politician Iyad Allawi, a longtime opposition figure known for his close ties to the State Department and the CIA, was named prime minister on Friday.\n\nThe Cabinet draws its membership from Iraq's ethnic, religious and cultural mosaic, bringing together lawyers, politicians, academics, human rights activists, engineers and businessmen from a broad spectrum in contrast to Saddam Hussein's regime, which revolved around a Sunni Muslim clique from his hometown of Tikrit.\n\nPresident Bush said yesterday's announcement brought Iraq \"one step closer\" to democracy, but warned against a spike in violence as the date for the restoration of sovereignty draws near.\n\nElections planned in JanuarySecurity remains the primary threat facing the new government, which will rule until national elections by Jan. 31. The ceremony introducing the new government took place under tight security in the heavily guarded Green Zone headquarters of the U.S. occupation administration.\n\nHeavily armed U.S. troops and Iraqi security forces ringed the two-story building where the ceremony was held. U.S. Army helicopters hovered above and snipers were stationed on the roof. Sniffer dogs searched for bombs. Those present included L. Paul Bremer, Iraq's American governor U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S. commander in Iraq.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Allawi focused on security, saying he would ask Iraq's allies for help \"in defeating the enemies of Iraq.\" He also pledged to strengthen the arm raise soldiers' pay. Iraq's security forces, he said, will be a \"pivotal partner\" with U.S. and other coalition troops in the fight to restore security.\n\nSwitching from Arabic to English for the benefit of coalition leaders in the audience, Allawi said: \"We're grateful to the national alliance led by the Americans who have sacrificed so much to liberate us.\"\n\nMore than 800 U.S. service members have been killed since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003.\n\nCoalition troops are fighting a Sunni insurgency in the capital and areas to the west and north as well as a Shiite revolt in Baghdad and in the south. Suicide bombings have claimed hundreds of lives across the nation.\n\nThe lack of security is blamed for everything from insufficient power supplies to a slow economic recovery.\n\n\"The world and your neighbors expect you to bring about security, stability for the people of Iraq who have suffered enough,\" Brahimi, the U.N. envoy, told the new government.\n\nDeadlock threatened riftYesterday's announcement capped four weeks of deliberations by Brahimi, the coalition, the Governing Council and thousands of Iraqis whose advice and views he sought.\n\nThe deadlock over the presidency delayed the Cabinet announcement by one da threatened a rift with the Americans at a time when Washington is under pressure internationally to grant Iraqis full sovereignty.\n\nAccording to Iraqi politicians, the Americans insisted that Adnan Pachachi, a former foreign minister, become president. Most of the Governing Council wanted al-Yawer, a 45-year-old engineer and tribal leader. Pachachi, an 81-year-old Sunni Muslim, told reporters he turned down the presidency for \"personal reasons.\"\n\nThe two vice presidencies went to Ibrahim al-Jaafari, of the Shiite Muslim Dawa party, and Rowsch Shaways, speaker of parliament in the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.\n\nAt the welcoming ceremony, al-Yawer pledged to rise \"above sectarianism and divisions\" and restore Iraq's \"civilized face.\"\n\nAl-Yawer has repeatedly spoken against the U.S.-led occupation, but never advocated violence. He hails from the northern city of Mosul and has engineering degrees from Saudi Arabia's Petroleum and Minerals Universit Georgetown University.\n\nThe presidency is a symbolic position, but al-Yawer - as the highest-ranking Sunni in the government - will likely hold considerable influence through his elaborate network of contacts among the tribes and clans of Iraq.\n\nIn contrast, Pachachi came from a family that produced several top politicians over the past 50 years but has no power base in Iraq after more than 30 years in exile in the United Arab Emirates. His ties to the Americans did not help his standing among Iraqis frustrated b distrustful of the occupation.\n\nThe Bush administration official in Baghdad said the United States had no preference and was pleased with al-Yawer's selection.\n\nOne of the first tasks facing new government will be to negotiate an agreement governing the status and conduct of international troops after June 30. The Iraqis are seeking a greater say over operations of the 135,000 American troops and other coalition forces on Iraqi soil. The administration official in Baghdad said negotiations would begin \"fairly soon.\"\n\nSeveral key Iraqi figures, including Pachachi, were sharply critical of April's three-week Marine siege of Fallujah, a Sunni city west of Baghdad, in which hundreds of Iraqis died.\n\n(Published: June 2, 2004)"
