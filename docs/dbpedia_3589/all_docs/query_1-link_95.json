Pina\n\nAnalyst in Middle East Religions and Cultures\n\nForeign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division\n\nCongressional Research Service Ë The Library of Congress\n\nWomen in Iraq:\n\nBackground and Issues for U.S. Policy\n\nSummary\n\nThe issue of womenâs rights in Iraq has taken on new relevance, following the\n\nU.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, efforts to reconstruct Iraq, and recent elections for\n\na Transitional National Assembly (TNA). Over the past three years, the Bush\n\nAdministration has reiterated its interest in ensuring that Iraqi women participate in\n\npolitics and ongoing reconstruction efforts in Iraq. There has also been a widening\n\ndebate regarding the extent to which the U.S.-led reconstruction efforts have been\n\nable to enhance womenâs rights in Iraq and encourage their participation in Iraqâs\n\ngoverning institutions.\n\nAccording to some observers, political uncertainty, conservative Iraqi culture,\n\nand an increase in popular religious activism, has called into question the future\n\ninvolvement of Iraqi women in nation-building and their role in public life. Also,\n\nIraqis, in general, and Iraqi women, in particular, have complained that the volatile\n\nsecurity situation and continuing insurgency have contributed to a deterioration in\n\ntheir status. Others note that Iraqi women are making inroads into the political\n\nprocess, citing the example of the January 30, 2005 national election, which resulted\n\nin Iraqi women gaining 87 out of 275 seats in the TNA. While Iraqi women captured\n\n31% of Assembly seats, a primary challenge will be the drafting of a new permanent\n\nconstitution, which some feel must institutionalize the rights of women as equal\n\ncitizens in the state of Iraq. Another challenge Iraqi policymakers face is how to best\n\nensure Iraqi women are represented in traditionally male-dominated areas such as the\n\njudiciary, state ministries, and local government.\n\nThe U.S. commitment to Iraqi womenâs issues has evolved into greater\n\nprogramming for women in Iraq. As part of the approximately $21 billion in U.S.\n\nfunding for Iraqi reconstruction in FY2004, the United States allocated substantial\n\namounts that specifically help Iraqi women with democratic organization, education,\n\nadvocacy, and entrepreneurship. Still, U.S.-sponsored Iraqi reconstruction projects\n\nthat address womenâs issues face challenges. Although women may benefit from a\n\nrange of reconstruction and humanitarian programs, elements of Iraqi civil society\n\nand culture continue to undervalue the role of women in areas such as political\n\nparticipation and private industry. Furthermore, issues of personal status, like\n\npolygamy, continue to hamper gender equality in Iraq.\n\nRelated CRS papers include CRS Report RL33227, U.S. Assistance to Women\n\nin Afghanistan and Iraq: Challenges and Issues for Congress, by Rhoda Margesson\n\nand Daniel Kronenfeld; CRS Report RL31339, Iraq: U.S. Regime Change Efforts\n\nand Post-Saddam Governance, by Kenneth Katzman; and CRS Report RL31833,\n\nIraq: Recent Developments in Reconstruction Assistance, by Curt Tarnoff.

One of the major questions facing U.S.\n\npolicymakers is the extent to which the United States can help Iraqi women\n\nreintegrate into the political, educational, and economic spheres after a long period\n\nof decline, exacerbated by three major wars and more than a decade of economic\n\nsanctions. Advancing the political and social position of women and committing\n\nadequate resources to girlsâ education have both been linked to the achievement of\n\nefficient and stable development, particularly in post-conflict regions.\n\nCongress has taken an active interest in the issue of women in Iraq over the past\n\nfew years. Since March 2004, several congressional Members have participated in\n\nthe Iraqi Womenâs Caucus, with the intention of improving Iraqi womenâs lives and\n\nsupporting women to gain access to educational and professional opportunities. S.\n\n2144, a bill introduced in the 108th Congress as the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act\n\nFY2005, included a section expressing the âsense of Congress that the rights of\n\nwomen in Iraq, including their full participation in government and society, should\n\nbe protected following the transfer of sovereignty to Iraq in June 2004.â Another bill,\n\nH.Res. 143 (also introduced in the 108th Congress), resolved that Congress encourage\n\nongoing programs designed to support Iraqi women to participate more fully in a\n\ndemocratic Iraq.\n\nNo specific earmarks for womenâs programs have been passed in the current\n\nCongress. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs\n\nAppropriations Act, 2006 (H.R. 3057, P.L. 109-102), provides $28 million each to\n\nthe International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute to fund\n\ngovernance and rule of law programs in Iraq. The earlier version of this bill as passed\n\nin the Senate had specified that the funding should be spent in the areas of\n\nâgovernance, elections, political parties, civil society, and womenâs rights,â but the\n\nmention of women was not included in the final conference report.\n\nThe first section of this report provides an overview of Iraqi womenâs situation\n\nunder Baathist rule (1968-2003). The second section discusses the position of\n\nwomen in the immediate post-Hussein period, examining the role of the Coalition\n\nProvisional Authority (CPA). The third section examines the current situation of\n\nIraqi women, recent elections, and the impact the Transitional National Assembly\n\n(TNA) has upon women. A fourth section outlines significant issues affecting U.S.\n\npolicies toward Iraqi women, highlighting the possible outcomes of a volatile security\n\nsituation, indigenous challenges to womenâs rights (like the rise of Islamic\n\nconservatism), and of the transition to Iraqi sovereignty. A final section highlights\n\nkey U.S.-sponsored programs that address Iraqi womenâs issues.\n\nCRS-2\n\nWomen under Baathist Rule (1968-2003)\n\nUnder the relatively secular Baathist regime, which espoused a variant of Arab\n\nsocialism, women enjoyed certain legal privileges and opportunities that were\n\ndeemed, by many observers, to be more progressive than in other countries in the\n\nMiddle East. In practice, however, many Iraqi women faced various forms of\n\ndiscrimination and mistreatment. Although Iraqi women experienced significant\n\nlegal gains, their public role was often restricted. During the 1990s the restrictions\n\nbecame more evident as women were often manipulated by the Hussein-dominated\n\nBaathist regime for political aims.\n\nEducation and Labor\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Iraqi oil wealth financed a massive social sector\n\nexpansion, helping build the public service, health, and educational sectors. As part\n\nof its program to improve economic development in the country, the secular Baathist\n\ngovernment made education compulsory for boys and girls until the age of 16. The\n\nCompulsory Education Law, passed in 1976, allowed for primary school attendance\n\nto become nearly universal by the beginning of the 1990s when it reached 93%.1\n\nSome scholars argue that in addition to economic motivations, the Baathist regime\n\nsupported girlsâ education as part of a deliberate policy to weaken tribal influence.\n\nThe move challenged the existing kinship structure inherent in Iraqi society, a\n\ncultural system that historically looked unfavorably on any public role for political\n\nparticipation by women. The regime, according to one source, âmade it a policy to\n\nend womenâs isolation from the public sphere through education, work, unionization,\n\nand womenâs associations.â2\n\nWhether for economic or social reasons, the prominence of Iraqi women in the\n\nworkforce during the Baathist years was, at least intermittently, an important policy\n\nobjective. This was especially the case during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when\n\nfemale labor was needed in order to fill the economic vacuum created by the large-\n\nscale mobilization of male breadwinners. The special demands on the Iraqi economy\n\nduring and after the Iran-Iraq war, according to a United Nations report, led to\n\nincreases in womenâs industrial employment, from 13% in 1987 to 21% in 1993.3\n\nBy 1993, female employees constituted 79% of the services sector, 43.9% of the\n\nprofessional and technical sectors, and 12.7% in administrative and organizational\n\nposts. At the same time, women suffered the consequences of political repression,\n\na characteristic of Iraqi society as a whole during this period. Moreover, despite gains\n\nin employment, thousands of widowed women were forced to become the sole\n\nhousehold caretakers and to deal with the impact of a decade-long war that imposed\n\nan emotional and physical burden on a large sector of the population.\n\n1 Iraq Living Conditions Survey, United Nations Development Program, 2005.\n\n2 Shereen T. Ismael, âDismantling the Iraqi Social Fabric: From Dictatorship Through\n\nSanctions to Occupation,â Journal of Comparative Family Studies 35 (2004).\n\n3 Iraq Living Conditions Survey, op. cit.\n\nCRS-3\n\nWomen and the Government\n\nIn 1972, in line with the partyâs attempt to consolidate civil institutions under\n\nstate control, the Baathists formed the General Federation of Iraqi Women (GFIW),\n\nalso known as the Iraqi Womenâs Federation.4 The GFIW became the only legally\n\nsanctioned womenâs organization in Iraq. Despite the existence of the GFIW as part\n\nof the Baathist state, the participation of Iraqis, in general, and of women, in\n\nparticular, within the national political discourse was fairly limited. Some sources\n\nargue that in reality, men ran the state apparatus and filled most of the senior\n\nmanagement positions as Iraq remained a largely patriarchal and tribal-based society.5\n\nOthers argue that there were some women in the Baathist Regional Command (the\n\nmost senior body within the Party).\n\nAccording to a 2003 conference report on womenâs role in post-conflict Iraq,\n\nthe GFIW organization was originally conceived to âensure that regulations regarding\n\nwomen were complemented by capacity-building and literacy programs, and to\n\nsponsor educational programs on womenâs legal rights.â6 Some hypothesize that\n\nduring his presidency (1979-2003) Saddam Hussein came to support the GFIW,\n\nseeing it as a way to break old familial and tribal allegiances while redirecting them\n\ntowards a Baathist and nationalist focus.7 Some estimates indicate that in 1997, 47%\n\nof all women in Iraq belonged to the GFIW.8 Other sources provide a more modest\n\nestimate, noting that in the late 1990s, the GFIW had a reported membership of 1.5\n\nmillion women, in 222 branches across Iraq.\n\nOverall, analysts maintain that the GFIW became âa strong force in\n\nimplementing womenâs legal claims to land, and assuring them access to educationâ;\n\nit also promoted womenâs rights to marry and divorce, and in exchange, many\n\nwomen âsupported the [Baath] Party just as their leader wished.â9 Yet, throughout\n\nthe 1990s, Saddam Husseinâs government restricted the activities and rights that the\n\nGFIW secured for Iraqi women. In particular, as the Iraqi economy constricted in the\n\nlate 1990s, the government pushed women out of the labor force and into more\n\n4 For general historical information on the GFIW, see Suad Joseph, âElite Strategies for\n\nState-Building: Women, Family, Religion and State in Iraq and Lebanon,â in Women, Islam\n\nand the State, 1992.\n\n5 Daniel Henninger, âMuslim Women Seize Chance To Claim Rights,â The Wall Street\n\nJournal, March 11, 2005.\n\n6 Building a New Iraq, op. cit.\n\n7 Swanee Hunt and Cristina Posa, âIraqâs Excluded Women,â Foreign Policy 40, July 2004.\n\n8 âBackground on Womenâs Status in Iraq Prior to the Fall of the Saddam Hussein\n\nGovernment,â Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, November 2003.

Economic, social, and political\n\nrestrictions placed extreme strains upon women. While there were no official\n\nstatistics published on the rate of illiteracy among women, a trend of decreasing\n\nliteracy was being reported by the Iraqi government during the 1990s. In 2000, the\n\nUnited Nations estimates that adult illiteracy among Iraqi women was approximately\n\n45%, an increase in illiteracy from a reported 25% in 1987.13\n\nThe economic decline was also coupled with a decline in the quality of public\n\neducation sector. In some cases, young girls were required to share in domestic\n\nresponsibilities and to assist their families by earning informal wages, thus curbing\n\ntheir school attendance.14 Women endured other hardships under the strict political\n\nregime of Saddam Hussein; according to a U.S. Department of State Fact Sheet,\n\nHusseinâs regime utilized sexual assault and torture to terrorize dissidents and to\n\nelicit confessions from female prisoners.15\n\n10 Available online at [http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/wrd/iraq-women.htm]. The report\n\nstates that in 1998, the Iraqi government reportedly dismissed all females working as\n\nsecretaries in governmental agencies. In June 2000, it also reportedly enacted a law\n\nrequiring all state ministries to put restrictions on women working outside the home.

Between 1991 and 2003, the\n\nKurdish region was largely autonomous, protected by a âno-fly-zoneâ enforced by\n\nU.S., British, and French warplanes. Some argue that as a result, Kurdish-Iraqi\n\nwomen were in a better situation than their counterparts, allowing them to be\n\ninvolved in the Kurdistan Regional Government and to form womenâs organizations\n\nand networks that sought greater political and public participation of women.16\n\nHowever, in the more traditional and tribal parts of Kurdistan, the custom of âhonor\n\nkillingsâ persisted. One news report indicates that this custom might be gradually\n\neroding in the Kurdish areas following recent interventions by dozens of non-\n\ngovernmental organizations (NGOâs). 17\n\nDeterioration of the Legal Situation\n\nThe 1970 Iraqi Constitution issued by the Baathist regime declared equal rights\n\nfor all Iraqis, regardless of sex, race, language, social origin, or religion. In 1980,\n\nLaw No. 55 granted women the right to be nominated to the Iraqi National Assembly.\n\nLabor laws also required equal pay, benefits, and promotions for men and women.\n\nFor the most part, the personal status laws in Baathist Iraq were based on the 1959\n\nCode of Personal Status, which drew on various sources including Islamic law,\n\ncustomary law, and judicial precedence. Under this Code, polygamy was permitted\n\nonly with the consent of the Muslim courts in Iraq. Compulsory marriage was\n\npunishable by law. A wife was entitled to request dissolution of her marriage if her\n\nhusband did not âfulfi1 any lawful condition stipulated in [a] marriage contract.â18\n\nIn practice, these laws were often not enforced. After the Iran-Iraq war ended\n\nin 1988, some sources indicate that a man could divorce his wife without paying\n\ncompensation.19 In the 1990s, the legal situation of Iraqi women began to deteriorate\n\nfurther. In 1990, as part of an effort to gain support from Iraqâs tribal leaders and\n\nreligious fundamentalists, Saddam Hussein introduced Article 111 into the Iraqi\n\npenal code. This law exempted men from punishment for the practice of âhonor\n\nkillings,â that is if they killed female relatives who had committed or been involved\n\nin perceived sexual improprieties (even if these women were raped). Some reports\n\nsuggest that Hussein also allowed the observance of a strict interpretation of shariâa\n\n15 (...continued)\n\nRegime,â April 4, 2003.

The authorityâs mission was âto restore conditions of security and stability,\n\nto create conditions in which the Iraqi people can freely determine their own political\n\nfuture, and facilitating economic recovery, sustainable reconstruction and\n\ndevelopment.â21 Since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the formation of the\n\nCPA, the Bush Administration has stated its interest in ensuring that Iraqi women are\n\ninvolved in rebuilding and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. An August 2003 âFact\n\nSheetâ issued by the Department of State indicated that:\n\nThe U.S. is committed to helping the Iraqi people transition to a sovereign,\n\nrepresentative form of government that respects human rights, rejects terrorism\n\nand maintains Iraqâs territorial integrity without threatening its neighbors. We\n\nrecognize that the women of Iraq have a critical role to play in the revival of their\n\ncountry and we strongly support their efforts. They bring skills and knowledge\n\nthat will be vital to restoring Iraq to its rightful place in the region and in the\n\nworld. The U.S. will engage with Iraqi women to secure and advance the gains\n\nthat they have achieved so far.22\n\nFrom the start of the occupation, the Administration indicated that the CPA\n\nwould work to advance womenâs rights in Iraq. A prominent Kurdish-Iraqi woman,\n\nNasreen Barwai, was made Minister of Public Works within the interim government.\n\nSince the establishment of the CPA, there has been a widening debate regarding the\n\nextent to which the CPA was able to assist women in Iraq and to incorporate them\n\nin the reconstruction effort.\n\nIraqi Governing Council (IGC)\n\nIn July 2003, the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, headed by proconsul\n\nL.

Chapouk was\n\na teacher of fine arts in the northern city of Mosul and had previously worked for\n\nwomenâs causes.\n\nIn 2003, some observers argued that Iraqi women did not have an adequate\n\npresence in the Iraqi ministries and in the judicial infrastructure.23 In December\n\n2003, Khuzai and Chapouk enunciated their frustrations with the CPA, writing that\n\nâwomen are severely under represented in the leadership established for the\n\ntransitionâ; they asserted that, âas plans for a new governing structure are developed,\n\nthe Iraqi Governing Council and the Coalition Provisional Authority should ensure\n\nwomen their rightful place at the decision-making table.â24 This criticism, as some\n\nobservers have noted, highlights one of the challenges facing U.S. officials working\n\nto include Iraqi women in all levels of the government.\n\nPrior to the formation of the IGC Bremer reportedly promised that the IGC\n\nwould include a wide spectrum of Iraqis and would not be dominated by exiles.25 As\n\na result, one of the problems in appointing local Iraqi women lay in identifying\n\nexperienced women, who had remained in Iraq but were not affiliated with the\n\nBaathist regime, to work within the interim government. As part of its âde-\n\nBaathificationâ policy, the CPA abolished the GFIW, which had been the only\n\nofficially recognized organization for women under Baathist rule. After its collapse,\n\nsome of the GFIWâs top leaders, who had been most closely affiliated with the\n\nSaddam Hussein regime, reportedly fled Iraq out of fear of arrest and (or)\n\nprosecution.26\n\nWomenâs Rights Under the IGC. On December 29, 2003, the U.S.-\n\nappointed IGC passed Resolution 137, which would have overruled the Iraqi Family\n\nLaw that has been in effect since 1959. Resolution 137 would have placed several\n\naspects of family law, including matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance, under\n\nIslamic law. It was reported that âthe conservativesâ power might cause a problem\n\nin the future, especially when we will start debating womenâs rights.â27 Following\n\nprotests led by womenâs groups and pressure by administrator Bremer, the IGC\n\ncancelled this resolution.\n\nDespite the concern over womenâs constitutional rights, there were no Iraqi\n\nwomen on the nine-member committee drafting the Transitional Administrative Law\n\n23 One report indicates that there less than 10% of Iraqâs judges are women.

The TAL is serving as\n\nIraqâs interim constitution at least until October 2005, when a permanent constitution\n\nis scheduled to be put to a referendum. The TAL declares equal rights for all Iraqis\n\nregardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or nationality. It considers the Islamic\n\nreligion as a source of law; also, no provision in the TAL can violate Islamic\n\nprinciples. The TAL also contains a provision calling for a targeted goal of 25%\n\nrepresentation for women in the transitional National Assembly.28 It is unclear\n\nwhether this provision will remain in effect after a permanent constitution is ratified.\n\nCritics of the TAL have listed several concerns with provisions dealing with\n\nwomenâs rights. They suggest that the TAL âoffers no explicit guarantee that women\n\nwill have equal rights to marry, within marriage, and at its dissolution; It does not\n\nexplicitly guarantee women the right to inherit on an equal basis with men; It fails to\n\nguarantee Iraqi women married to non-Iraqis the right to confer citizenship to their\n\nchildren.â29 Proponents of the TAL point out that in 1990, women constituted less\n\nthan 11% of Iraqâs National Assembly, and that the 25% targeted goal would more\n\nthan double this proportion. They also note that 25% exceeds the number of women\n\nrepresented in the United States Congress and that the TAL is the only Arabic-\n\nlanguage constitution clearly indicating that âgender-specific language,â that is\n\nlanguage written in the more commonly used Arabic masculine form, âshall apply\n\nequally to male and female.â30\n\nWomen and the Transition to Iraqi Rule\n\nThe handover of limited sovereignty to Iraqis took place on June 28, 2004. The\n\nAdministrationâs plans to hand over sovereignty placed strict limits on the new Iraqi\n\ngovernment, including only partial command over its armed forces and no authority\n\nto enact new laws. The transitional government currently being formed has\n\nsomewhat expanded prerogatives. In the long run, however, what is of major concern\n\nto proponents of womenâs rights is whether any future Iraqi government would\n\nmaintain or enforce those constitutional provisions that support the rights of Iraqi\n\nwomen. It appears that the biggest challenge to Iraqi women will be seeking to voice\n\ntheir opinions and play a meaningful role in a future government.\n\nSome regarded the exclusion of Iraqi women in the writing of the TAL as a\n\nworrisome sign for the future, raising the question of whether women will be\n\ninvolved in the writing of a permanent constitution. On May 10, the National\n\nAssembly appointed a 55-member committee to begin drafting the permanent\n\nconstitution, which is scheduled to be completed by August 15, 2005, in time for an\n\n28 âLaw of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period, 8 March 2004,â\n\nAvailable online at [http://www.cpa-iraq.org/government/TAL.html].\n\n29 âInterim Constitution Shortchanges Women,â Human Rights Watch, March 5, 2004.\n\nAvailable online at [http://www.occupationwatch.org/article.php?id=3503].\n\n30 âLaw of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period, 8 March 2004,â\n\nop. cit.\n\nCRS-9\n\nOctober 15, 2005 referendum.31 Although there is no law that stipulates women must\n\nhave representation on the constitutional assembly, 9 seats are currently held by\n\nwomen. Also, NGOâs that address the concerns of Iraqi women are âamong the\n\ngroups that are organizing on the constitution the most,â ensuring that womenâs\n\nissues continue to gain attention.32\n\nOther questions have been raised about the enforcement of current and future\n\nlaws that provide equality for women. Even if a future Iraqi constitution contains\n\nprogressive provisions for womenâs rights, some analysts are concerned that\n\nimplementation of progressive legislation may prove difficult. The issue of\n\nsupporting newly elected Iraqi women and preparing Iraqi women for future\n\nelections is of near-term relevance, as is the question of how womenâs rights will be\n\naffected if religious conservatives are given greater voice in a new Iraqi government.\n\nMoreover, some proponents have argued that in order to ensure that women are\n\nwell-integrated in the nation-building process, their role in rebuilding the Iraqi\n\neconomy must be institutionalized through support for equal access to economic and\n\nfinancial resources.\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nElections & New Government\n\nThe United States transferred limited sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government\n\non June 28, 2004, with a new government and a permanent constitution to be voted\n\non later. In June 2004, the United Nations formed an 8-member Independent\n\nElectoral Commission of Iraq (IECI), nominated by leading Iraqi notables, to assist\n\nin the election of a 275-seat National Assembly, a provincial assembly in each of\n\nIraqâs 18 provinces (41 seats each and 51 for Baghdad), and a Kurdistan regional\n\nassembly (111 seats). The elections were provided for in the TAL, and took place\n\non January 30, 2005.33 Under IECI rules, every third position on electoral lists\n\ncontained a womanâs name. This calculus developed in response to the TALâs goal\n\nfor at least 25% female membership in the new Iraqi National Assembly. For many\n\nIraqi women and outside observers, the elections results have been mixed. Iraqi\n\nwomen exceeded the baseline of 25% Assembly membership to make up nearly 31%\n\nof the Assembly (or 86 out of 275 seats). The winning Shiâi list, backed by the\n\nprominent Iraqi cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, has 46 women in its block of 140\n\nseats.34\n\n31 See CRS Report RL31339, Iraq: U.S. Regime Change Efforts and Post-Saddam\n\nGovernance, by Kenneth Katzman.\n\n32 Manal Omar, âWomenâs Rights in a New Iraq: The Constitution and the Future,â Council\n\non Foreign Relations Roundtable on Women and U.S. Foreign Policy, May 11, 2005.\n\n33 Full text of the Transitional Assistance Law available online at [http://www.cpa-iraq.org/\n\ngovernment/TAL.html].

Narmin\n\nOthman, Minister of State for Iraqi Womenâs Affairs, recently voiced concerns about\n\nthe Shiâi dominated Assembly, stating that:\n\nWe need to guarantee womenâs rights in our constitution. This will be a huge\n\nchallenge. And to be honest with you, Iâm aware there are some in Iraq who\n\nwould like to limit womenâs rights. In the election and National Assembly, we\n\nhave more than 150 Islamists, Shiâi, maybe they are believing that Sharia\n\n[Islamic law] is the biggest or one of the biggest resources for the constitution,\n\nthat means limiting womenâs rights.36\n\nThe issue of Islamâs place in many Middle Eastern and predominantly Muslim\n\nnationsâ legal codes is common and Iraq is no exception. Although modern Iraqi\n\nhistory is replete with liberal views towards women, Iraqi Shiâism and the wider\n\nculture of the country may create obstacles for women increasing their participation\n\nand visibility in Iraqi political and social life. In particular, some analysts are\n\nconcerned that any new Iraqi constitution may mirror the âcosmeticâ rights Saddam\n\nHussein extended to women during his regime. These experts note that a Shiâi\n\ndominated Iraqi political system will face challenges from secular Iraqis with regards\n\nto persistent social issues such as honor killings, harassment, polygamy, and property\n\nownership.\n\nIt remains unclear whether personal status issues, like divorce, will be addressed\n\nfrom a secular-civil perspective or fall under the purview of Islamic law. A wider\n\nconcern relates to participation. Many observers hail the representation of women\n\nin the Iraqi National Assembly as a positive development, while others note that\n\nwomen continue to lack leadership opportunities in local provincial, mayoral, and\n\ntown posts. These critics argue that women hold no top positions in any of Iraqâs 18\n\ngovernorates or judiciaries.\n\n34 (...continued)\n\nAgence France Presse, February 14, 2005.\n\n35 Charles Osgood, âIraqi Women Fear Setbacks in Civil Rights Because New National\n\nAssembly is Predominantly Shiâi,â The Osgood File, February 16, 2005.\n\n36 Phillip Kurata, âWorld Support Urged for Womenâs Rights in Iraq, Afghanistan,â\n\nWashington File, March 9, 2005.\n\nCRS-11\n\nIssues for the United States:\n\nPast & Present\n\nOverview\n\nThe Bush Administration has continued to assert that the position of Iraqi\n\nwomen has improved following the U.S. toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime.\n\nIn a speech on March 12, 2004, President Bush indicated that âevery woman in Iraq\n\nis better off because the rape rooms and torture chambers of Saddam Hussein are\n\nforever closed.â37 Nonetheless, a number of concerns have been raised over the past\n\nyear regarding the role of women in a future Iraq and the status of U.S. efforts to\n\npromote womenâs rights. Overall, the concern for many is that any modest political\n\ngains Iraqi women have secured may be threatened by cultural forces and increased\n\npolitical authority of Shiâi conservatism. Also, the question of equal representation\n\nfor women in local governance and the judiciary may continue to resonate, despite\n\nany increases in the parliament. Furthermore, the continuing violence in Iraq affects\n\nâat-riskâ populations like women, who often restrict themselves to their homes out\n\nof fear of physical harm, intimidation, and abuse.\n\nSecurity\n\nA number of security concerns affect not only the involvement of women in the\n\ndeveloping Iraqi political system but also the access of ordinary Iraqi women to\n\nreconstruction programs. Some report that many Iraqi women who work to advance\n\npolitical freedoms, do so under threat of violence, extortion, and kidnappings. The\n\nlack of security has been cited as a major obstacle in the progress of reconstruction\n\nefforts aimed at advancing womenâs rights.\n\nA delegation of Iraqi women visiting the United States in early March 2004\n\nindicated that progress on womenâs rights in Iraq was continuously threatened by a\n\nprecarious security situation and the rise of Islamic factions. One analyst wrote in\n\n2004 that since the start of the occupation, âlife has not returned to ânormalâ in Iraq.\n\nIn places where kidnappings occur frequently, children must be accompanied to\n\nschools and women are escorted to the market and have taken to donning abaya\n\n(body-covering garments) to ensure greater self-protection.â38\n\nWith increased violence directed toward women involved in Iraqi reconstruction\n\nand government, it appears that âmany large international aid groups, including most\n\nof those with womenâs programs, have already withdrawn international staff because\n\nof attacks against aid workers.

On\n\nMarch 9, 2004, Fern Holland, a 33-year old lawyer and former Capitol Hill staffer\n\nfrom Oklahoma, was murdered, along with her deputy Salwa Ourmashi and CPA\n\npress officer Robert Zangas. Holland worked with the CPA, as the womenâs rights\n\ncoordinator in Shiâa-dominated areas within southern Iraq. On November 20, 2004,\n\nAmal al-Maâamalchi, a womenâs rights activist and advisor at the Iraqi Ministry of\n\nMunicipalities and Public Affairs, was killed in Baghdad. Al-Maâamalchi was a\n\nco-founder of the Advisory Committee for Womenâs Affairs in Iraq and the\n\nIndependent Iraqi Womenâs Assembly. On April 27, 2005, Lamia Abed Khadouri,\n\na Member of Parliament, was killed in her home.\n\nReligious & Cultural Forces Within Iraq\n\nReligious and cultural factors in Iraq might also present challenges to\n\nreconstruction efforts targeting women. For example, there is a debate over the\n\nextent that Islamic law or shariâa should play a role in a future Iraqi government. As\n\ndiscussed above, some Iraqi groups â including those represented on the\n\nU.S.-appointed Governing Council â are interested in instituting Islamic courts\n\ninstead of civil courts to oversee matters related to marriage, divorce, property\n\nownership, and inheritance. These courts would be run by Muslim clerics - all of\n\nwhom are male.\n\nSome analysts are concerned that the growing religious conservatism within\n\nIraqi society is threatening women who are liberal, secularist, and non-Muslim or\n\nthose Muslim women who do not wish to be ruled by a religious-based law. There\n\nis also concern among Kurdish-Iraqi womenâs groups who feel that the strides made\n\nduring years of relative autonomy (1990-2003) could be threatened by the inclusion\n\nof the Kurdish areas in what could become an Islamist-governed Iraqi state. Many\n\nIraqi women, including Christian female students in strongly Shiâa Basra, Iraq, have\n\ncomplained that they have been forced to wear a head scarf. Other Iraqi womenâs\n\ngroups, however, point out that Islamic law is not inherently contrary to the rights of\n\nwomen. A Baghdad-based group called the Islamic Womenâs Movement notes that\n\nâIslamic scriptures accord women considerable rights â inheriting property, for\n\nexample, or declining an unwanted husband. They say itâs the way male authorities\n\ninterpret those writings that keeps women from exercising them,â adding that\n\nteaching women their rights under Islam would help end injustices against them.40\n\nSome recent studies indicate a degree of indigenous resistance to womenâs\n\ninvolvement in governance or to equal rights for women, particularly in the more\n\ntraditional and Shiâi-dominated region of southern Iraq. One study of southern Iraq\n\nindicated that most Iraqi men and women do not fully support womenâs civil and\n\npolitical rights, âincluding freedom to move about in public and to participate in\n\n39 Annia Ciezadlo, âAfter an Advocateâs Killing,â Christian Science Monitor, April 1, 2004.\n\n40 Annia Ciezadlo, âA Religious Awakening,â Newsday, February 19, 2004.\n\nCRS-13\n\ngovernment.â41 The study mentions that âlack of support for such rights for women\n\nmay be related to implementation considerations, such as inadequate numbers of\n\nteachers, employment opportunities, and safety issues, among others.â42 This may\n\nnot reflect the opinion of Iraqis towards women in other regions of Iraq. Women in\n\nthe northern Kurdish region, as discussed above, have experienced greater freedom\n\nand more opportunities for political involvement in the past several years. The\n\nattitude of Iraqis towards women in larger urban centers, such as Baghdad, has yet\n\nto be fully investigated and might also reflect a range of opinions on womenâs rights.\n\nThreats to Reconstruction Programs\n\nIt is difficult to generalize about the status of the reconstruction programs in\n\nIraq, because the countryâs political and social landscape is diverse. However, some\n\nassessments of U.S. reconstruction programs have called into question the extent to\n\nwhich USAID programs have been effective in improving the lives of Iraqi women,\n\nespecially considering the uncertain security situation. One recent report by\n\nChristian Aid, a UK and Ireland-based charity, indicated that poverty in Iraq,\n\nparticularly among women and children, has been exacerbated by âthe insurgency,\n\nmilitary action, crime, and ethnic and religious conflict.â43 The survey states that in\n\nparts of Baghdad,\n\nchildrenâs education is being severely disrupted. Almost two-thirds of school-age\n\nchildren in the families surveyed were not attending school full time. The reasons\n\ngiven included persistent violence, poor standards of education, dilapidated\n\nschool buildings and children forced to work to boost family income.44\n\nA poll conducted by the Institute for Civil Society Studies, an Iraqi NGO,\n\nindicated that serious security concerns have hindered womenâs access to health care\n\nfacilities. The problem is especially visible in southern Iraq, in the Shiâi-majority city\n\nof Basra, where many women have suffered from the long-term effects of war,\n\nbeginning with the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and are in desperate need of medical\n\ncare. Some analysts have observed that Iraqi insurgent attacks have increasingly\n\ntargeted civilians including employees working on reconstruction projects. Despite\n\nthis trend, according to USAID and NGO, several reconstruction programs are still\n\nfully operational and continue to serve the needs of many Iraqis, including women\n\nand children. In some cases, while many foreign NGO workers may have left Iraq,\n\nthe NGO offices themselves have continued to operate with the help of newly-trained\n\nIraqi staffers.\n\n41 Lynne Amowitz, et al., âHuman Rights Abuses and Concerns About Womenâs Health and\n\nHuman Rights in Southern Iraq,â Journal of the American Medical Association 291 (2004).\n\n42 Ibid.\n\n43 âChristian Aid in Iraq,â Christian Aid, March 2005.

In conference report language (H.Rept. 108-337),\n\naccompanying the FY2004 Emergency Supplemental Appropriation (P.L. 108-106),\n\nwhich provided $18.4 billion for Iraqi reconstruction, conferees included $10 million\n\nâto support womens programsâ in Iraq. In February 2004, former Deputy Secretary\n\nof Defense Paul Wolfowitz announced that âthe United States is giving special\n\nemphasis to helping Iraqi women achieve greater equality and has allocated $27\n\nmillion for womens programs.â He added that âeducation for women is one of the\n\nhighest priorities, and the United States has committed more than $86.8 million to\n\neducation projects, with special emphasis on ensuring that girls are registered and\n\nattending school.â45\n\nIn March 2004, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell announced a $10 million\n\nIraqi Womens Democracy Initiative (WDI), intended to âtrain Iraqi women in the\n\nskills and practices of democratic public life. Programs will include education for\n\ndemocracy, leadership and political advocacy workshops, entrepreneurship projects,\n\nmedia training for women aspiring to careers in journalism, and activities to help\n\nnon-governmental organizations build capacity.â46 The Secretary also announced the\n\nformation of a âU.S.-Iraq Womens Networkâ (USIWN). Iraqi womens issues and\n\nwomens programs have also received an indeterminable amount of funding through\n\nother Iraqi reconstruction funds, targeting women in education, local governance,\n\nhealth care, and civil society. More recently, Secretary of State Rice reiterated the\n\nU.S. position on women in Iraq, stating that:\n\nU.S. Government-sponsored programs are helping Iraqi women develop in\n\ndiverse areas from literacy, computer, and vocational training to human rights\n\neducation. Micro-credit facilities and workshops are helping aspiring Iraqi\n\nbusinesswomen, and additional funds are improving womens access to quality\n\nhealth care, including maternal and child health.47\n\nSince 2004, the United States has supported democracy-building programs that\n\nhelp Iraqi women candidates learn democratic organization and advocacy skills,\n\nincluding post-election reform strategies for Iraqi women. Though FY2005 regular\n\nand supplemental appropriations did not specify new amounts of aid for women, a\n\nsignificant amount of funds support activities benefitting women and girls [see\n\nbelow].\n\n45 Women in the New Iraq,â February 1, 2004.

Some of these initiatives have been managed under the auspices of\n\nthe Iraq Local Governance Program (LGP), a program intended to provide a\n\nfoundation for Iraqs transition to democracy. According to the Research Triangle\n\nInstitute (RTI International), which has been contracted to work in this sector, the\n\nLGP has attempted to deal with the obstacles presented by Iraqi culture to women in\n\ngovernance. The Iraqi Women in Local Governance Group (IWLGG) has been\n\nestablished in order to âenhance the political participation of women through civic\n\neducation and training and monitoring the progress of female participation in each\n\nlocal government.â48\n\nThe LGP also supports and funds initiatives by local womenâs groups to develop\n\ntheir own NGOs, civil society organizations, and professional associations. A major\n\ncomponent of the project, according to USAID, is to facilitate the participation of\n\nwomen in city councils. Through this program, USAID has held a number of\n\nworkshops for women throughout Iraq, specifically in cities such as Arbil, Hillah,\n\nKarbala, and Baghdad. At these conferences, âinternational and local participants\n\ndiscuss issues such as Islam, democracy, oppression of women, womens rights and\n\nparticipation in future elections.â49\n\nUSAID has supported accelerated learning programs that are specifically\n\ntargeted toward girlsâ education. These programs are intended to provide girls with\n\nlife skills and the academic background necessary to return to formal schooling. A\n\nUSAID report discussing reconstruction accomplishments in March 2004, indicates\n\nthat USAID has rehabilitated 2,351 schools and trained over 32,000 teachers and\n\neducation administrative workers. The report indicates that these efforts, âhave\n\nresulted in children returning to school. Notably, female attendance has surpassed\n\nmale attendance, and overall attendance during exam week was 97 percent.â50\n\nIn trying to encourage the work of NGOs in Iraq, the CPA worked with USAID\n\nin order to build the organizational capacity of NGOs targeting women through\n\ntraining and other assistance programs. Some U.S.-based NGOs have conducted\n\nworkshops for women and worked with Iraqi womens organizations on womens\n\nrights awareness and skills training. For example, Women for Women International,\n\na U.S.-based NGO, is supporting the development of an NGO community in Iraq and\n\nhas partnered with agencies and other groups to develop a number of womens centers\n\nthroughout the country, some of which will provide leadership workshops as well as\n\nvocational skills training.51\n\n48 Information provided to CRS by the Research Triangle Institute, March 2004.\n\n49 Ibid.\n\n50 âUSAID accomplishments in Iraq Mar 2003 to Mar 2004,â March 18, 2004.

In December 2004, the WDI\n\nsponsored a Womens Candidate Training seminar in Sulaymaniyah, Iraq. The\n\nSeminar introduced female Assembly candidates to voter registration and campaign\n\nmethods. WDI also targets civil society projects like training female radio\n\nbroadcasters to produce and run a daily womens show. The WDI also established the\n\nWomens Leadership Institute, which assists Iraqi women to rise to positions of\n\nauthority in Iraqi government and civil society.\n\nThe National Endowment for Democracy (NED).

Specifically, the NED provides technical\n\nassistance to promote understanding of Iraqs past and the possible future of\n\ndemocratic culture in the country. Recently, the NED sponsored the Iraq Memory\n\nFoundation (IMF), which supports a web-based womens rights memorial. The NED\n\nalso lent strategic support to female Assembly candidate training in voter targeting\n\nand contact strategies, and womens leadership.\n\nNational Democratic Institute (NDI). NDI provides technical assistance\n\nin support of political participation of Iraqi women. Recognizing the particular\n\nchallenges Iraqi women face in the public sphere, NDI supports grass-roots projects\n\nthat assess the needs of Iraqi womensâ political participation. Specifically, NDIs\n\nprogram to strengthen womens political participation in Iraq is designed to foster an\n\nenvironment in which women are viewed as credible and effective leaders. The\n\nInstitute works with political parties and civil society organizations to develop\n\nconcrete strategies for including women in political structures. NDI also continues\n\nto build a network for women political activists that provides a forum for assistance\n\nacross party lines and gives women the skills to present themselves as professional\n\nand competitive candidates.\n\nThe International Republican Institute (IRI). The IRI provides technical\n\nassistance and advice on campaign training, coalition building, and polling. IRI\n\nsponsored a âStop the Violenceâ campaign in August 2004, which brought together\n\na coalition of Iraqi women from throughout the country to conduct a door-to-door\n\nsignature campaign that denounced violence. Their efforts led to a meeting with\n\ninterim Iraqi Defense Minister Hazem Shaâalan and President Ghazi al-Yawar, who\n\nboth committed to making that matter a priority. Since that time, the IRI established\n\na permanent management structure to register Iraqi NGOs committed to decreasing\n\ninter-communal violence.\n\nThe United States Institute of Peace (USIP). The Institutes work with\n\nIraqi women is placed within the broader context of civil society, inclusion, and\n\ntolerance. Part of USIPs programming in Iraq supports civil society organizations\n\nthat increase the participation of Iraqi women in public life (women and conflict\n\nCRS-17\n\nresolution, constitution making, and inter-ethnic dialogue). Recently, USIP awarded\n\na grant to an Iraqi civil society organization for activities including a workshop on\n\ninter-communal tolerance for Sunni and Shiâi mothers. USIP also provided training\n\nfor 1,151 Iraqi women on political participation, elections mechanisms, and conflict\n\nresolution.\n\nCongressional Activity\n\nCongress has taken an active interest in the issue of women in Iraq over the past\n\ntwo years. Since March 2004, some Members of Congress have participated the Iraqi\n\nWomens Caucus, with the intention of improving Iraqi womens lives and supporting\n\nwomen to gain access to educational and professional opportunities. S. 2144, a bill\n\nintroduced in the 108th Congress as the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act FY2005,\n\nincluded a section stating the âsense of Congress that the rights of women in Iraq,\n\nincluding their full participation in government and society, should be protected\n\nfollowing the transfer of sovereignty to Iraq in June 2004.â Another bill, H.Res. 143\n\n(also introduced in the 108th Congress) resolved that the Congress encourage ongoing\n\nprograms designed to support Iraqi women to participate more fully in a democratic\n\nIraq.\n\nAlthough the Senate report on the FY2006 Department of State appropriation\n\nrequest (S.Rept. 109-35) recommends establishing a Middle East Foundation, which,\n\nin part, âexpands the rights of womenâ in countries such as Iraq, no specific earmarks\n\nfor womenâs programs have been passed in the current Congress. The Foreign\n\nOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006 (H.R.\n\n3057, P.L. 109-102), provides $28 million each to the International Republican\n\nInstitute and the National Democratic Institute to fund governance and rule of law\n\nprograms in Iraq. The earlier version of this bill as passed in the Senate had specified\n\nthat the funding should be spent in the areas of âgovernance, elections, political\n\nparties, civil society, and womenâs rights,â but the mention of women was not\n\nincluded in the final conference report. In addition, two congressional resolutions\n\nemerged in this session encouraging the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly to\n\nadopt a constitution granting women equal rights (H.Res. 383 and S.Res. 231, both\n\npassed unanimously). A third resolution commended Iraqi women candidates in the\n\nJanuary 2005 elections (H.Res. 143, referred to the Subcommittee on Middle East\n\nand Central Asia)."
