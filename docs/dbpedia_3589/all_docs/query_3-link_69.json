        "text": "BAGHDAD — Iraq’s top Shiite political leaders gathered in a sweltering hotel ballroom here on Monday and announced a new alliance, a new name and a new platform. Absent was the country’s most prominent Shiite political leader, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.\n\nThe creation of the alliance — which includes a former prime minister and a sitting vice president — represented the opening of an election campaign that is likely to be as contentious as it is decisive in shaping the kind of country that will emerge.\n\nMr. Maliki’s refusal to join the alliance, after weeks of negotiations behind the scenes, intensified a bitter political struggle over the leadership of the country’s largest sect ahead of parliamentary elections in January.\n\nIt reflected the country’s deeply fractured politics, as well as dueling efforts by the United States and Iran to influence them. The two countries, each powerful in different ways, have lobbied for divergent visions of a new Iraq: a broadly nonsectarian society versus one that places political power almost entirely in the hands of the country’s long-oppressed Shiites.\n\nThe creation of a Shiite alliance without him made it clear that Mr. Maliki, prime minister since 2006, had not yet secured the support of his most important bloc of voters, raising questions about whether he can be assured of winning a second term.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Maliki’s absence left the new alliance without the support of a leader who remains generally popular, though his standing has suffered with a rise in violence, including the devastating attacks on two government ministries that killed about 100 people last week.\n\n“He should bear in mind that he is one man among many in Iraq,” Abdul Jabbar Ahmed, a professor of political science at Baghdad University, said on the sidelines of Monday’s meeting.\n\nAmerican officials have quietly urged Mr. Maliki to broaden his own base and run as a national leader beholden neither solely to his sect nor to Iran. Mr. Maliki’s refusal to join the new alliance, at least for now, appeared to reflect a pragmatic political calculation as much as an ideological stand.\n\nIn the negotiations, his aides insisted that he become the alliance’s candidate for prime minister and that his Dawa Party receive an assured number of seats in the new Parliament. He was rebuffed, according to officials involved in the negotiations.\n\n“We’re not ready to talk at this time about these delicate questions,” said Qassim Daoud, a member of Parliament and a former national security adviser who joined the new alliance.\n\nWho might lead the alliance in Mr. Maliki’s absence remained unstated, though two obvious candidates are a former prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, and Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi, who represents the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\n\nBoth have been fierce rivals of Mr. Maliki and, previously at least, of each other. Mr. Jaafari, a physician who served as prime minister in 2005 and 2006, made his aspirations clear.\n\n“I am not looking for any government post,” he said. “But if the Iraqi people wanted it, I would not let them down.”\n\nHe and other leaders sought to portray their coalition — called the Iraqi National Alliance — as nonsectarian. It included two small Sunni groups, one led by a leader of the Sunni Awakening movement in Anbar Province, and a Turkmen party, though no Kurds.\n\nNearly 40 new members in all stood, sweating, on a dais at the Babylon Hotel as speaker after speaker appealed for unity. They included men dressed in suits and others in robes and headdresses. There were also five women, all in the back row — three covered in Islamic scarves.\n\nAnother prominent member was Ahmad Chalabi, the chairman of the largely secular Iraqi National Congress, who was influential among conservatives in Washington advocating the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 and who has since drawn closer to Iran.\n\nThe alliance, in fact, reflected the political sway of Iran, Iraq’s Shiite neighbor, whose diplomats openly advocate the revival of a Shiite electoral bloc that would dominate Iraq’s government and deepen ties with Iran.\n\nTwo of the new alliance’s main leaders even reside in Iran: Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the founder of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, who is being treated for lung cancer and was hospitalized in Tehran on Monday, and Moktada al-Sadr, the fiercely anti-American cleric who is in self-exile in Iran.\n\nMr. Maliki’s failure to join the alliance suggested Iran’s influence might have its limits.\n\nThe alliance seeks to replace the United Iraqi Alliance, the Shiite-dominated bloc that won control of Parliament in elections in 2005 but unraveled once in power.\n\nMr. Maliki, who emerged as a compromise prime minister in the political turmoil, has since consolidated power and sought to expand his political appeal.\n\nIn provincial elections earlier this year, Mr. Maliki appealed to voters by emphasizing security over identity. His State of Law bloc won the largest number of seats in most of the southern, largely Shiite provinces, and an outright majority in Baghdad and Basra, dealing a blow to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\n\nA member of Parliament of Mr. Maliki’s Dawa Party, Hassan al-Senid, said at a news conference after the alliance’s meeting that “ethnic and sectarian fragmentation was a feature of the previous phase” in Iraqi politics.\n\nHe said he would not close the door on future political deals.\n\nThe new alliance’s “guiding principles” included appeals for unity, support for the Constitution and for peaceful coexistence among Iraq’s peoples. It also included provisions with a more sectarian cast, like respect for the directives of the Shiite religious authorities in Najaf and the patronage of culture and arts “in accordance with religious and moral values.”\n\nAnother plank would surely dismay the American officials under former President George W. Bush who hoped the establishment of a democratic Iraq would spread peace throughout the region. It vowed “not to establish relations with the Zionist entity,” meaning Israel.\n\nIn an interview before Monday’s meeting, Mr. Chalabi offered a pointed assessment of the strength and weakness of a purely sectarian alliance. He said that while he favored a broader coalition, voters were more likely to vote for leaders from their sect.\n\n“Sectarian politics gets votes in Iraq,” he said, “but sectarian government fails.”\n\nBus Bombs Kill 20\n\nBAGHDAD — Insurgents set off bombs on two buses traveling from Baghdad to the mainly Shiite city of Kut on Monday, killing at least 20 passengers.\n\nAt least 10 other people were wounded, according to an Iraqi security official, who said the attackers had used bombs that adhere to the underside of a vehicle."
