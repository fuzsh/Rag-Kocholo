        "text": "DOHA // Saudi Arabia replaced its envoy to Iraq on Sunday, after his comments about Iranian involvement in Iraqi affairs led to diplomatic tension with Baghdad.\n\nThamer Al Sabhan in 2015 became the first Saudi ambassador to be posted to Iraq since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, an appointment which was seen as heralding closer cooperation in the fight against ISIL militants in Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut in August, Iraq asked Riyadh to replace Mr Al Sabhan after his comments about Iranian involvement in Iraqi affairs and the alleged persecution of Sunni Muslims angered Shiite politicians and militia leaders.\n\nMr Al Sabhan was appointed minister for Arab Gulf Affairs, a newly-created position, according to Saudi state news agency SPA.\n\nHe will be replaced by Abdulaziz Al Shamri, Riyadh’s military attaché in Germany, who will be appointed as the charge d’affaires to the Saudi embassy in Baghdad, Mr Al Sabhan said on his Twitter account on Friday.\n\nIraqi politicians and militias had made repeated calls to expel Mr Al Sabhan, who has been calling on the Iraqi government to exclude Shiite paramilitary groups from its military campaign against ISIL to avoid abuses against Sunnis in Iraq.\n\n* Reuters"
