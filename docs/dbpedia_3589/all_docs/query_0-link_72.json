        "text": "Russell Riley\n\nThis is the joint interview with Condoleezza Rice and Stephen Hadley as a part of the George Bush 43 Oral History Project. Thanks very much for inviting us to Stanford for this occasion. We've had a brief conversation before the tape began about the ground rules, but again the fundamental one is that this is completely confidential. The only people who are allowed to report what goes on in the discussion are the two of you.\n\nAlthough we're going to focus mostly on the second term, according to our prior arrangement, I wanted to begin by asking some questions about the transition from the first to the second term. We talked a little bit about this in the first interview, but not so much related to the White House and where the National Security Advisor role fits into this. I have some questions, and Seyom does too, about the transitional area, some questions about President Bush and his own development as President, any changes in his ways of thinking or doing business that you may have witnessed from 2001 to 2005.\n\nThen, the thing that we really didn't get to very much last time was the key geographic areas, the issue areas. I think it would be useful to tackle those one at a time, as interesting subjects for which to get two different frames of reference. We don't need the play-by-play narrative on this as much as we do the general narrative, what the important developments are, how you're thinking, and so forth.\n\nLet me start by asking this question: As you're transitioning into a new arrangement of people in late 2004 and early 2005, I'm sure you're looking back at the experience of the first term. How well did you feel the national security-making process worked during the first four years?\n\nCondoleezza Rice\n\nLet me start and then maybe Steve can—For most issues, the National Security Council structure that we had put together—And by the way, Steve and I were present at the creation, literally. We started together. He was also a Vulcan. So when we knew we were going to be National Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor, we started plotting what kind of National Security Council the President should have, and talking to him about it. We put a lot of thought into the structure.\n\nIt was sort of funny: Because of the prolonged postelection period, the Florida period, there were times when we thought, as we were planning, that we might not actually ever be National Security Advisor and Deputy National Security Advisor, but we spent a lot of time thinking it through. We thought that a couple of things we'd done had been really spot on; for instance, putting the Treasury Secretary in the position of being always at the National Security Council. As you know, the 1947 Act names only four members, so the President has a lot of discretion about whom he invites. We thought economic issues were becoming important enough that the Treasury Secretary ought to be a regularly attending member, and so he was. We thought that worked very well.\n\nOf course, we had come into this thinking we'd be a National Security Council, only to find that the homeland issues suddenly after 9/11 were very critical, and now we had a Homeland Security Council. Some of the sorting of what Homeland would do and what the NSC [National Security Council] would do worked more smoothly than one might have thought. That was partially personalities. Tom Ridge was very easy to work with. That would be true later on with Mike Chertoff as well. Even the National Economic Council that I oversaw through the National Security structure, for instance—things like the Argentine near-collapse in 2001 through 2003, because Larry Lindsey and the NEC [National Economic Council] guys just thought that the NSC had more heft than the NEC did in bringing the right people to the table. On most issues it was working really, really well.\n\nThe place that it was really hard was when we got to Iraq. That was because this was the most complex undertaking that any administration had ever undertaken, because it wasn't like World War II, where you ended the war and then you had the peace. We were sort of still fighting the war and trying to bring in elements of the peace, and the complications then between the roles and responsibilities of Defense and State, personalities as well, but I think you can overplay the \"It was Don [Rumsfeld] and Colin [Powell].\" This was more structural, because State wasn't structured to do the kind of big reconstruction and big phase-four operations. Defense wasn't really structured to do phase-four operations. The last year or so, 2003, 2004, was very tough for the National Security structures.\n\nThe other thing that was hard to work through the structures were issues having to do with detainee policy, the kind of War on Terror legal framework, because again this was uncharted territory. It was just very hard to get all of the moving pieces working. I actually think once we moved to 2005—First of all, we had a lot of experience with some of these areas that really helped inform. Secondly, when I moved to State I was determined to restructure State in a way to be better able to do these things. And third—He's going to blush when I say this—he was just a better National Security Advisor than I was. I was, I think, a better Secretary of State than I was National Security Advisor.\n\nStephen Hadley\n\nWe may have to work on this part of it.\n\nRiley\n\nI don't think we have to work on it. We have you here and you can speak for yourself.\n\nRice\n\nI absolutely think that's true, so we can explore that further. Now you've got a chance.\n\nHadley\n\nI have a couple of things and they're elaborations on what Condi said. One of the ways we handled this—You know, the charge of a National Security Council staff and really a White House staff is to integrate across the stovepipes. You get a set of objectives and you bring the whole government together, all its various resources, to accrue that objective. The goal of the National Security Council and the National Security Council staff has to be integrating across agencies.\n\nOne of the things that Condi did very clearly was in the organization of the NSC staff. We ended up in the first term, and refined it a little in the second term, with five Deputy National Security Advisors in the key areas that were bulwarks of the President's policies: communication strategy, War on Terror, Freedom Agenda, economics, and then someone in the end who did some of the regional issues. So we had a structure that gave priority to the President's priorities but was basically flat. Condi basically said, \"I don't want to just be dealing with senior directors; I want to be dealing with directors as well.\"\n\nSo we had a flat NSC staff. We emphasized in the NSC staff putting together ad hoc teams to deal with an issue, where you pull in functional people, regional people, and have your lawyer and your communications people sitting around in a room brainstorming a policy. We integrated within the NSC staff. We also then had the potential seams between the National Economic Council, the Homeland Security Council, and the National Security Council. We solved that problem by—First, many times those meetings were joint. It would be a joint NSC-HSC Homeland Security Council meeting, or a joint NSC-NEC meeting, and the National Security Advisor and either the Homeland Security Advisor or the head of the National Economic Council—We would basically cochair the meetings.\n\nSecondly, we had a lot of dual-hatting within the NSC staff. The Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics was also a deputy to the National Economic Council. The Deputy for Counterterrorism was also the deputy on Homeland Security Council, and their job was to keep the two principals aligned and in line. So we did that. We also did dual reports on the staff level. Our intelligence person was also dual-hatted to the Homeland Security Council. Our communications persons worked not just for Condi but worked for the Communications Director of the White House; lawyering worked in the same way.\n\nAgain, the whole structure was to be flat, to have dual reports that would help move across the seams. Then, within the NSC, the culture was sharing information, sharing credit, and working together as teams. That worked pretty well.\n\nSecond, there was a lot written about the Vice President and his staff. I will say, in terms of the Vice President, Condi and I had no objections or anything else. He was the most team player I had ever—\n\nRice\n\nVery transparent.\n\nHadley\n\nVery transparent. He would do two things. We would get together—We would have meetings and talk through an issue, and the Vice President would always be the first person to say, \"This was a great discussion. Now, how are we going to bring it to the President?\" Do we do it formally in an NSC meeting? Do it informally? Do we do it in the Oval Office? Do we do it in the Residence? The Vice President was the biggest protector of Presidential prerogatives to make decisions.\n\nWhen I was National Security Advisor—Condi is right: the two areas where we had the biggest troubles were Iraq and North Korea. The Vice President would call me up and he would say, \"Steve, I need to vent. I've got to tell you what I think.\" He would lay out what he thought. At the end he would always say, \"But I'm just the Vice President. You and the President are running the train. Thanks for listening.\" You know, you can't do better than that.\n\nNow, his staff was very conservative. We tried to make it one staff. His staff people sat in on our senior directors' meetings. Scooter [I. Lewis] Libby and I, when I was Deputy, would try to meet every other week and just sort of see where things were. There were some tensions there, particularly on North Korea, and a couple of other issues where their staff just disagreed. But the notion that somehow the Vice President was running his own foreign policy—\n\nRice\n\nIt's just not right.\n\nHadley\n\nIt's just not right.\n\nRice\n\nLet me say a word about North Korea because we can come back to it. When I moved to State, the Vice President and I also were perfectly willing to sit in front of the President and debate, and debate in a really spirited fashion, not mean-spirited, not personal, but pretty sharp. The Vice President would say, \"It won't surprise you that I disagree with Condi about this.\" We'd go at it in front of the President. But it wasn't an uncomfortable relationship. I actually think the fact that we were able to do that in the second term was really a good thing. It was a very good idea.\n\nSeyom Brown\n\nTo what extent were there—\n\nHadley\n\nI want to say one other thing before we lose it and then I'll stop. There were three other devices we used that were interesting, and that were less NSC. One is Don Rumsfeld and George Tenet, working together, developed an integration of military and intelligence/covert operations, which was really unprecedented. It was formed in Afghanistan and in the Afghan campaign. But it really continued in terms of Iraq, in terms of what General [Stanley] McChrystal was doing. You saw it all the way up into the operation to capture [Osama] bin Laden. We now have a fusion of intelligence, covert operations, and the military like we've never had before. It is a huge capability for the President and for the country. It was done initially informally by those two.\n\nWe had real trouble getting a similar fusion between State and Defense; I think that's fair to say. In a way, we never got it until Ryan Crocker and David Petraeus decided to form a real team in Baghdad. The third thing we did, and it was mostly second term, although Condi did it informally but we regularized it in the second term, was the Tuesday afternoon meeting. We would meet every Tuesday at four o'clock.\n\nRice\n\nPrincipals only.\n\nHadley\n\nPrincipals only: Condi, [Robert] Gates—first Rumsfeld, then Gates—the Vice President, the DNI [Director of National Intelligence], the Director of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Deputy National Security Advisor, and my deputy, who was the notetaker. We met every Tuesday afternoon from 4:00 to 6:30. I served tortilla chips and hot cheese dip.\n\nRice\n\nThat we all looked forward to getting.\n\nHadley\n\nIt had a big impact on both attendance and mood. In those sessions we would vet all the tough operational issues and all the sensitive political issues, just among the Principals. The Vice President would sit here and Condi would sit here, and they would debate it across the table, because on many issues, like North Korea, they were the outliers in terms of views. It was candid but without the pressure of the President being there. You could get all those things out on the table. People knew exactly where everybody stood and you could have the kind of spirited discussion that you might be a little reluctant to do in front of the President, but it got all the issues out.\n\nRice\n\nNever a leak out of it.\n\nHadley\n\nNever a leak.\n\nRiley\n\nWas there paper?\n\nHadley\n\nThere is a set of notes from those meetings that Jim Jeffrey and then Judy Ansley did and they're with the Presidential papers. They will make some of the most interesting reading coming out of the administration.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nHadley\n\nBut those were some structural things, both structural and personal things, that really were all to this issue of trying to integrate and fuse, which is the biggest challenge.\n\nBrown\n\nYou're describing here the meetings that are part of the structure that you instituted. What about informal conversations with the President, beyond these meetings?\n\nRice\n\nPretty frequent. First of all, the Vice President met with him every week for lunch. I met with the President every week. Don met with the President every week. I also would stop by for dinner every once in a while, maybe once a month or so. We talked on the telephone all the time. Look, I knew the President very well.\n\nWhen I became Secretary of State, I thought, I'm not going to lose the connectivity that I had when I was down the hall, because the worst thing that a Cabinet Secretary can do—I told Hank [Henry] Paulson this and he wrote about it in his book. I said, \"You'll get really busy running your department and they'll have a million things for you to do. You only have one client and actually it is the President of the United States, because he is the one that the American people elected. It is not because you want to suck up to him; it is because he's the one with ultimate responsibility, so never lose connectivity.\"\n\nThe President would call Steve every Sunday morning, and when I was National Security Advisor he would call me every Sunday morning. I would talk to the President every Sunday morning as well but Steve and I had such a good relationship that when I knew the President—I would wake up and I would see something in the newspaper and I would think, Oh, that's going to send him off, because it says—I'm creating: \"State Department Says President Doesn't Know What He's Doing.\" That would be the implication of some article. So I would call and I would say, \"Now Steve, before the President sees this article—\"\n\nHadley\n\n\"Tell him to call me.\"\n\nRiley\n\n\"Tell him to call me before he—\" Right? Or sometimes Steve would call me and say, \"You know, I think you'd better call the boss.\"\n\nHadley\n\nI'd get her on the treadmill, and I'd say, \"Condi, are you on the treadmill?\" \"Yes.\" \"Have you seen the paper yet?\" She'd say no. I'd say, \"Take a look at page A10. He's going to be really spun up about this one.\" She would say, \"I got it.\" At five after seven, when I would go into the Oval Office, I would come in and the President would be on the phone and he'd put his hand over the mouthpiece and he'd say, \"It's Condi.\" He would put it down five minutes later and say, \"Condi was concerned about A10 in the—\" [laughter]\n\nIt leads to a terribly important point for the National Security Advisor, what Condi and I did, which is: You are in a unique position either to encourage the President to have confidence in his Cabinet Secretaries or to really undermine his Cabinet Secretaries. This is the perfect example. There are two ways you can handle this example. The way you handle the example if you want to make yourself look good and your Cabinet members go by, is you wait until 7:05, then you go in and you say, \"Mr. President, you probably saw that article on A10. You know, it's outrageous. I told Condi that she's got to get control of her building and stop these leaks. I don't know what they're doing over there. Don't worry, Mr. President, I'll call Condi and I'll take care of it.\"\n\nRice\n\nRight.\n\nHadley\n\nThat's making yourself look good and undermining the confidence the President has for Cabinet Secretaries. The other way to do it—and this is what Condi did with Colin and what I did with Condi—is you get the Secretary of State on at five minutes after six, and you say, \"There's going to be an article there. The President is going to want to know what you're doing about it.\" With Condi or Colin, you didn't have to say more. They would say, \"I'll get on it.\" Then you say, \"And once you've got it, you probably ought to call the President directly.\"\n\nRice\n\nRight.\n\nHadley\n\nIt is all the difference in the world. The times of tension between—It is always the National Security Advisor and the Secretary of State because the Secretary of Defense is too powerful. It's when you had the Secretary of State and National Security Advisors who try to make each other look bad and themselves look good in the face of the President, and it is a real temptation. The thing I say to young people is, \"Do not do it. You need to encourage the President to have confidence in his Cabinet Secretaries and to communicate with them directly.\"\n\nThe President would have a tendency to say, \"I've decided that you should call Gates,\" or \"Call Rumsfeld,\" and I would say, \"Mr. President, I'm not in the chain of command. You've got a phone there. Pick up and hit that third line and you'll have Don Rumsfeld. You ought to give that order to him directly.\"\n\nRice\n\nSteve was better at that, because the President, for a variety of reasons—he was busy; he was doing a lot of things—would say, \"Call Don.\" You really do have to say to the President, \"You need to talk to him.\" I would say sometimes, \"You need to have Colin in.\" Or, \"It might be a good thing to have dinner with Colin. Can I set that up?\"\n\nOnce, knowing how to handle the Secretary-Presidential relationship, I can remember when we were getting ready to go into Afghanistan—the period between September 16th, when the President decides we're going to invade Afghanistan, to October 3rd or whatever it was, when the war launches—it just felt like a slog. Every day the military is coming in and they're not quite ready. And we can't quite get the basing rights with [Islam] Karimov. Every time the President sits through these meetings it's like, \"Well, Mr. President, yes, we'll have that to you basically as soon as we can.\"\n\nThe President is on a different clock, because even though he's made the decision that he's not going to do something spasmlike in response to September 11th—He's not just going to fire off some cruise missiles—he knows that there is a sort of clock with the American people that they expect something to happen. He knows there is still a safe haven in Afghanistan. If there is another attack from Afghanistan, then what has he been doing?\n\nIt finally came to a head one day about two weeks after September 11th. I went out to the Agency with the Vice President to review some materials. Somebody bursts in the door and gives me a note saying the President is on the phone. I go speak to the President and he says, \"I was just thinking about it. When am I going to get a military plan?\" You know how he could be. He was all spun up. I said, \"Mr. President, I'm at Langley. Why don't I get in the car and come back?\" So I'm on the road from Langley and I get outside the gate and he's on the phone again. Then I get outside the White House gate and he's on the phone again. He just wants to say, over and over, he needs a military plan.\n\nI get up to my office and I call him and say, \"I'm coming right over.\" He says, \"No, just make sure I have a military plan.\" So I call Don and I say, \"Don, the President is kind of spun up. You think by tomorrow we could have a military plan?\" Don goes, \"Got it.\" The next day Don comes in. There is this orderly presentation. The military knows what they're going to do. They know how they're going to do it. So that's what you do, instead of saying, \"Yes, Mr. President, I know what you mean. The Pentagon, they're just not on it.\"\n\nHadley\n\nThat's exactly right, and with Colin and with the Vice President and with Don, they'd all been Chiefs of Staff or National Security Advisor; they knew what the President needed. What they didn't always know was what the President was thinking. One of the things that the National Security Advisor is—All the other Cabinet Secretaries really look to you to be the person who actually knows the President's mind.\n\nRice\n\nYes.\n\nHadley\n\nI would do the same thing with Don. You have your morning meeting with the President and something's got him. You go back and pick up the phone with Don Rumsfeld or Condi: \"I was talking to the President today. He is concerned about A, B, and C. You have your weekly one-on-one meeting with the President, so you may want to address those this afternoon.\"\n\nRice\n\nWhich gives you time as the Secretary, by the way, because one of the problems if you're a Cabinet Secretary—and I fully understood this when I went over to State—When you're National Security Advisor the organization is very flat. When you're Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense the organization is very hierarchical. I would very often know what was going on in Colin's building or Don's building before they did, because it is working its way up to them. We'd be on our morning call and I would say, \"Well, you know State is going to present—\"\n\nI'd go over there, and it gives you time, if the National Security Advisor does that before you go to see the President, to have gotten completely informed by your building so that you don't sit there looking like an idiot when he asks you something that is making its way up through your building.\n\nI know we're doing a lot on structure, but I think it is important. The other danger point comes with the President's morning intelligence briefing. Presidents don't get to be President of the United States unless they're decisive people. So he sees the intelligence brief and it says something that might, by the way, be an assessment, a judgment, or completely out-of-date by what is going on in the actual negotiations. The President wants to act, based on that information. It really turns to the National Security Advisor to say, \"Mr. President, let's step back. I'll call Colin; I'll call Don. Let's see what they're doing about that.\" The intelligence briefing, the PDB [President's Daily Brief] can very often present things in a way that looks like nothing is being done about it. You then have to make sure that he isn't making a policy call based on a piece of intelligence.\n\nHadley\n\nFurther structural things: One, encourage your key national security Cabinet Secretaries to have a weekly meeting with the President, just one-on-one, maybe with the National Security Advisor and Vice President and Chief of Staff, to go over issues. Two, encourage phone calls. Three, encourage—As Condi did, you might want to have Colin in for a dinner to sort of talk these things through. Four, have a conference call in the morning with the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, two or three days a week, just to give people a heads-up. Talk about the issues of the day that need to be resolved.\n\nOn the intelligence thing, in the second term we structured it so that we would try to save those intelligence pieces that really invited a policy conversation. Mike McConnell—We'd work out an agenda for the week as to what intelligence pieces were going to come to the President when. We would try to do the War on Terror pieces on Tuesday, because on Tuesday, in addition to the Vice President, the Chief of Staff, and the National Security Advisor, you had in the Director of the FBI, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Affairs, and the Homeland Security Department head. On Tuesday, when the President got his briefing that was heavily focused on the War on Terror issues, the policy people waging the War on Terror for him were present so they could hear the President's reaction to the intelligence and there could be some policy discussion.\n\nOn Wednesday we would have what we called \"deep dives,\" intelligence pieces on any number of subjects, which invited a policy discussion. To that we invited the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and of course the intelligence—\n\nRice\n\nAnd sometimes the Treasury Secretary.\n\nHadley\n\nThe Treasury Secretary, or Bob Kimmitt, who had a big political and military background, who was Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. He would come. You would have those conversations. For example, our strategy about whether we should push for Ukraine and Georgia to get MAP [North Atlantic Treaty Organization Membership Action Plan] was basically handled and the President reached his decision on a couple of those Wednesday meetings.\n\nThursday, the head of CIA came and he gave the President an operations briefing on what were the covert operations, because the President wanted the CIA Director to report to him directly on those issues, not through the DNI. So on Thursday Mike Hayden would come and would give an operational briefing. We tried structurally to do some things that would address the problem.\n\nRice\n\nIn the second term.\n\nRiley\n\nBecause, in the first term, Tenet was doing the daily report, right?\n\nRice\n\nYes, that's right. And that's fine because we didn't yet have a DNI, so George was doing the briefings. But this tendency to jump to a policy conclusion—\n\nHadley\n\nThat's the problem, without his policy people there.\n\nRice\n\n—without his policy people there, and sometimes without a framework for what was actually going on. I finally told the Agency, for instance—I said, \"Stop reporting on diplomatic activity, because you don't know what you're talking about. You don't know what Dan Fried is actually out there talking to the Europeans about.\"\n\nRiley\n\nThis is second term you're doing this, right?\n\nRice\n\nThis is second term. Because it looks like this is a problem that nobody has a solution for and nobody is working on. The Agency, through no fault of their own, would always be hours, sometimes days, behind what was actually going on.\n\nThe other thing, just as a footnote, that the Agency had to be careful of was that they would start telling the President what his counterparts were going to say or do, when of course the President actually knew these people. The President would say, \"He's not going to tell me that. Come on, he's not going to bring that up.\" Or, \"I know this person.\" That briefing had several danger points in it that could a) undermine the President's confidence in what his policy people were doing, or b) undermine the President's confidence in what his intelligence people knew. So you had to be careful how that morning briefing was used, because the President loved it. It was a great time of day. It was one thing for him to kind of process it; it was another for him to start getting locked into decisions.\n\nBrown\n\nCould I just ask about what the President wanted? Was he more interested in having the National Security apparatus present him with options and their implications if you were working toward a big decision, and then he would decide? Did he, on the other hand, want the process, whether it is in front of him, whether he is sitting there or not, to actually converge on the decision?\n\nRice\n\nIt depended on the issue. Both happened. There is also a kind of caricature of National Security decision making, that you give the President an options paper that says, \"Your options are one, two, and three; A, B, and C.\" Most certainly if you do that, A is, We should go to all-out war; C is, We should capitulate; and B is what the State Department actually wants to do. I found that structure untenable. What happens more, because President Bush was a very interactive person, is you go into the National Security Council and, yes, he knows he has option A, option B, option C, but people talk it through.\n\nWe used to often say, \"I might change my mind.\" The Vice President, in particular, would say, \"I'm going to say this, but I might change my mind by the end of the time we talk.\" So it wasn't that [Richard] Cheney wants option A, Powell wants B, and Rumsfeld wants C. That's not how it worked. We would talk and massage them, sometimes in front of the President, sometimes in the Principals Committee. I would—and I know Steve did this too—I walked back with the President after the NSC meeting and I'd say, \"So, what did you think of that?\" He would say, \"Well, I want people to talk about it a little bit longer.\" In that sense he's looking not to have to make a sharp that or that.\n\nSometimes he would say, \"I'm going to do that.\" Then you would go back and if you were smart you'd try to bring the Cabinet Secretaries to that, so the President didn't have to overrule one of his Cabinet Secretaries. It wasn't as if he didn't look at options and look at the implications of them; he did. But it wasn't, \"Now we'll look at option A—blah, blah, blah. Now we'll look at option B.\" Sometimes, like on North Korea, they would emerge as two quite separate options. Then the President would say, \"I'm going to do this and if this doesn't work I can always come back to this.\"\n\nBrown\n\nSometimes, if there were these divergent options, really massive in their implications, like the surge, would he go off on his own and then come back and inform you guys what the position was?\n\nRice\n\nHe would almost always go off and think about it. He rarely, in a meeting, would say, \"I'm going to do that.\" He would say, \"I want to think about it.\"\n\nHadley\n\nIt all depends. I remember one meeting when we had this intelligence that North Korea was having an enrichment program and we had a meeting in the [Situation] Sit Room. He came in and sat down and he said, \"Here's what we're going to do. I want to put together the six-party talks, because I want to get China in the room and use China to put its leverage on North Korea.\" He didn't have any discussion; he didn't hear options. He had thought about this idea. My guess is that he talked to Condi about it because he usually talked to Condi about everything before he did it. He just came in and he said, \"This is what I want to do.\" The rest of the meeting then was—\n\nRice\n\nHow do we do it?\n\nHadley\n\n—about how to do it. But with whom he talked could be crucial.\n\nRice\n\nIt's not as if the person is—\n\nHadley\n\nHe talks to himself. He has ideas.\n\nRice\n\nIn some ways, when I would go and he would have one of these sessions with me, it was like he was talking to himself with me in the room.\n\nHadley\n\nThat's exactly right.\n\nRice\n\nHe would say, \"You know, I've been thinking, and until we get China involved in this, we're not going to be able to solve this problem.\" That happened one day. It just sort of hung in the air; we didn't do anything about it. Then he would come back to it over a couple of days. \"You know, I've been thinking again. Maybe I ought to call Jiang Zemin and talk to him about this problem.\" I remember saying to him at one point, \"Maybe you need to vivify for the Chinese what it looks like if the North Koreans get a nuclear program.\" So he gets on the phone with Jiang Zemin, and he says, \"You know, some people want me to bomb North Korea.\" That gets the Chinese on board.\n\nBrown\n\nWould he, for example, if it is China, decide that he should call Henry Kissinger and talk with him?\n\nRice\n\nHenry would come by from time to time. Once in a while, George [Shultz] would come by.\n\nBrown\n\nSometimes he would say, \"When is Henry next going to be in?\"\n\nRice\n\nHe would just talk it through with people. But it is very important to understand that this was a President who had ideas. It wasn't as if he was a blank slate to which you were presenting a set of ideas. He was strategic in the way he thought about things. It was clear to him very early on that China was key to North Korea. He brought it up with me, and we sort of talked it through. It just kind of lay there for a while. Then we would talk it through. Then we started talking about how to engage the North Koreans without doing it bilaterally, because he hated the idea of our giving the North Koreans that status. That's where the six-party talks came from.\n\nHadley\n\nIf we did it bilaterally, of course, then everybody else was off the hook. The thing that is important about what Condi just said is the academic literature has a notion of a decision process that is a point in time and is basically two dimensional. The real decision-making processes are three dimensional and they change over time.\n\nRice\n\nRight.\n\nHadley\n\nPeople have a series of conversations with all kinds of people thinking about it themselves, and a decision emerges over time as a result of those conversations. When you did have a kind of flat point-in-time meeting—My definition of a good meeting was where the group went through an intellectual process and came to a point of consensus that was a position that nobody had when they walked in the door. That is a good decision process.\n\nOn the big things, the President was very comfortable making a decision, knowing his team would salute. But on the big, big things, like the surge decision, he knew before he formally made the decision where he wanted to go, but he also knew Condi was initially not on board, and Don was not initially on board, and the Chiefs were not on board. He knew that if he made that very important decision and didn't have those people lined up: a) if Condi wasn't on board, he was uncomfortable; b) if the Chiefs and Don weren't on board, it wasn't going to be sustainable, because he knew that Congress would hate the decision, and any division within the military would be used to kill the decision. There was a case where it was a process partly of him reaching his own decision, but partly, if you read the minutes of the meetings in the first week in December in 2007, it is very clear what he is doing. He is asking a series of questions that are gradually bringing Condi to the point where she says, \"Mr. President, my problem was this, and you fixed this.\"\n\nRice\n\nRight.\n\nHadley\n\n\"Therefore I think this makes sense.\" The same thing with the Chiefs. He is running a process that is bringing everybody else behind a decision that he has kind of made, but he is also refining that decision to address the concerns that people had. It is a very interactive process.\n\nRice\n\nThis is where the National Security Advisor is important. I knew that Steve wanted the surge, just because I know him. But you could never tell it at the meetings. You could never tell it in the interaction, that he wanted that. He was really just pushing, \"What are the issues here? What are the decisions that have to be made?\"\n\nI knew from July that—The President and I had talked, year after year, about whether we needed more troops. He would always ask the military and they would say, \"Mr. President, we have what we need.\" I knew he was getting more and more uncomfortable with that. I also knew where he wanted to go, but I was very concerned because I thought if we put more American troops in to do what we were doing, we were just going to get more American troops killed. I knew him well enough to say, in the Oval Office alone, \"Mr. President, if you put more American troops in, doing what the military is doing now, you will just get more Americans killed.\"\n\nI came back from a trip to Iraq where I had had an absolutely horrible set of meetings with the Iraqi leadership, where I had literally said to them, with the Ambassador sitting there, just Zal [Zalmay Khalilzad] and the translator—I said, \"Listening to you people—We're not getting involved in your blood feud. The fact of the matter is that Americans understand that there are some people who are resisting us because they think we occupy their country. There are some people who are al-Qaeda. We understand that. But Iraqis fighting Iraqis—We don't get that. We have a saying: 'You can hang separately, or you can hang together.' When I come back here in six months, I expect you're going to be swinging from lampposts.\" I looked at the translator and I said, \"Did that translate?\" He said, \"Oh, yes.\"\n\nThen I went back and told the President, \"I don't know if [Nouri al-] Maliki can pull this off. So given my discomfort with the Iraqis and with the military, until these are solved, I can't support it.\" But we really started working through exactly that.\n\nRiley\n\nI see. Let me just refine the question, because I think I know part of what Seyom's talking about. I'll give you an example out of another project. When we interviewed people who worked with President [William J.] Clinton, there was often a sense that somebody was whispering in his ear out of view. He would come up with ideas that had fingerprints on them, but people couldn't quite figure out whose fingerprints they were. I think part of what Seyom is getting at is the discipline within the administration in terms of who has the President's ear.\n\nHadley\n\nLet me tell you what I did on it. In terms of meetings—and Condi had the same policy—I never expressed my view in the NSC meetings, ever, because my job, what I was doing in the NSC meetings, and the reason I never sat next to the President but always sat down the table, as I was watching the President and his interaction and the faces of everybody else.\n\nRice\n\nI did too.\n\nHadley\n\nMy job was to make sure that he heard from all of his Cabinet Secretaries and that he understood what he heard. If you watched him—I could tell that there was something he did not understand, but he's President and he didn't want to ask the dumb question, so my job was to ask the dumb question. I'm the dumb guy here. I ask the question that is really the President's question that he can't ask but he needs the answers to.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nHadley\n\nSo you're running the process in the meeting. You then give your views privately after the meeting when you go back to the Oval. He will say at some point, \"So, Hadley, what do you think?\" I never gave him a view that Condi and Bob Gates and the Vice President weren't aware of because I would use that Tuesday afternoon session for two things: I would start out and tell them what I thought was on the President's mind with respect to an issue, not to try to bias them, but so they could take it into account in their own thinking.\n\nSecondly, what I tried to do was to tell them where I was heading so they wouldn't be surprised by what I might be saying to the President, but also so if they didn't agree, as sometimes they didn't, they would have an opportunity when they made their presentations to the President to say, \"Mr. President, there is a view out there that we should do X and Y,\" which they knew because I had talked to them about it.\n\nOne of the things you did with your Principals—If you're doing it right, they have confidence that in your interactions with the President you are telling them what is on the President's mind, and you're not putting a thumb on the process. Any ideas you have are in the process for them to respond to. On the surge—The first piece of paper I had done on the surge was in October of 2006, the Bill Luti piece, where I said, \"Go run a surge,\" to see what it would look like. I gave that piece of paper to Pete Pace so he could include it in his process.\n\nRice\n\nI think that's exactly right. I don't think this is a difference between us, but I would go back to the Oval with the President sometimes and I would say, \"So how'd you react to that? Tell me what you're thinking.\" Then he could talk about what he was thinking. I would on occasion say to him, \"You know, Mr. President, telling Colin that he can't send Jim Kelly to North Korea doesn't make any sense at this point. What do you have to lose? Why are you so opposed to that?\" \"Well, I don't want to give Kim Jong-il the status of sending an American Assistant Secretary.\" I would say, \"It's the Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs; it's not you.\" \"Well, I want to be absolutely certain that he doesn't say anything that shows that I'm softening,\" he would say.\n\nThen you go back to the Principals—and you never speak for the President. You say, \"OK, Colin, I think the President may be leaning toward Kelly, but you've got to come in and you've got to tell him what Kelly is going to do. Let me tell you, his range of tolerance for what Kelly would do is not very wide.\" Then a very smart person like Colin comes in and he's got Kelly on a really short leash. Now, the urban legend about this is that it was the NSC process that put Kelly on a really short leash. No, Colin Powell did, because Colin Powell knew that the President—\n\nHadley\n\nThanks to Condi.\n\nRice\n\nThanks to my conversation with the President, he knew that the President's tolerance wasn't very great and if he was going to get this to happen, he had to make the President comfortable with it. So that's how I think you introduce your own view.\n\nHadley\n\nThat's a perfect example of a National Security Advisor playing a constructive role to sort of broker the process and get the President where the President wants to go, and the Cabinet Secretaries aligned with that and also comfortable with the President going there.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you're also suggesting that, if you keep the channels properly functioning, that the voices are all being voiced through those channels, that you don't have out-of-channel or back-channel communications.\n\nRice\n\nI don't remember ever feeling that the President had heard something someplace and I didn't know where it was from. Often he would say to me, \"The Vice President brought up, at lunch, blah-blah-blah. What do you think?\" So I knew it was the Vice President. Maybe I would say to Steve, \"Can you check this out with the Vice President's staff?\" Or maybe, if I didn't think—Because sometimes the Vice President didn't even say to his staff what he'd said to the President—\n\nHadley\n\nMost of the time.\n\nRice\n\nMost of the time. So I would go down and say to the Vice President, \"The President said you were interested in—\" This idea that somehow the President was getting ideas that I didn't know where they had come from—Even if they were coming from the outside, he would say—I'll give you an example of this, on Sudan: The President talked a lot to his friends in the religious community about Sudan. This is early on in the administration. He would say, \"I was talking to the people who do Christian relief efforts in Sudan. Isn't there anything that could be done about this?\" I would say, \"Let me get to Colin.\" Then Colin would come in with some ideas. But I never felt that there was a little bird whispering in his ear, that I didn't know who that little bird was.\n\nHadley\n\nThree caveats: Remember, the President is getting a lot of information from talking to a lot of people. The President would get advice on the rope line.\n\nRice\n\nOh, yes. True.\n\nHadley\n\nOr he would get advice when he had to meet with congressional folks.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nRice\n\nThat's true.\n\nBrown\n\nOr he'd get meetings from friends who would come in from out of town.\n\nRice\n\nRight.\n\nHadley\n\nThe idea to make Bob Gates Secretary of Defense came from an old friend of his. One of the things you've got to do as National Security Advisor is not be defensive about that, and not try to cut all that off. Actually you want the President to have a lot of information sources and if you have the right relationship with the President, the President will let you know those things he has heard that have an impact on him. You have to be comfortable with that and not try to think you have an exclusive channel.\n\nTwo more structural things that we did: At the end of the first term in September and October of 2004 there were a lot of leaks coming out of the intelligence community to the New York Times that were designed to try to discredit the President and get him not reelected, no question about that. Very tough. We ended up sort of having to shut the interagency process down so as not to have leaks. It had a real impact on the President's confidence in the intelligence community. One of the challenges of the second term was how to rebuild that.\n\nOne of the things we did was we started to have—particularly on the deep dives on Wednesday, we had the actual intelligence officials who had written the PDB items, or the intelligence item, come in and present them. It wasn't the President's briefer briefing folks; it was the actual people who prepared the piece who came in and briefed the President so he could see face-to-face the folks who were writing this.\n\nHe of course would ask them their histories, where they were from. They were real people. He would always say, \"We're really interactive here and I'm going to push you, but you need to understand that I'm not pushing you to change your view. Your view is your view. I'm pushing you so that I understand what your view is, and for you to understand my perspective.\" Remember, by 2007, 2008, he's talking about Iraq, a problem he has now been dealing with for seven or eight years, with some people who had actually started to work at the Agency after we invaded Iraq in 2003. So the guy has a little bit more knowledge than they do.\n\nStructurally we did that to try to help him rebuild his confidence in the intelligence community.\n\nRice\n\nCould I just say that's what I also meant about when they come in and report on foreign leaders? After six years, he's seen these people seven, eight, nine, ten times. He's taken their measure.\n\nHadley\n\nThese intelligence people had never met them. Third structural thing: Very consciously in these Tuesday sessions, we would talk about—and we would bring Josh Bolten in—how to take an issue to the President. Sometimes you do it in the Situation Room, but when you're in the Situation Room and the President is sitting in that chair, he is Commander in Chief at its most exalted. He feels he is there to make a decision. Sometimes you don't want him to make a decision, you want him to listen. So the next down is we would brief an issue informally in the Oval Office, a little more relaxed, not a formal setting.\n\nIf we really wanted it to be a listening and exchange session—\n\nRice\n\nYou go to the Residence.\n\nHadley\n\n—we'd go to the Residence. Do it in the afternoon, Cokes and pretzels. Or maybe even on a weekend, jeans and shirts.\n\nRiley\n\nPretzels create a different environment than salsa and chips?\n\nRice\n\nAfter the President choked on one, needless to say.\n\nHadley\n\nThere is a certain intensity when he eats a pretzel. But again, these are things we did to try to have—Because the whole point of the NSC system is to get a process tailored to the President and his leadership and management style that gets him the information he needs and has a process of dialogue so that he gets to the point where he is comfortable making decisions.\n\nRice\n\nI know we're going on for a bit, but I just want to make one other point about the NSC process.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is just wonderful.\n\nRice\n\nThe NSC process ought to get the President to a good decision; it can't execute those decisions. That's what you have Secretaries for. I think the problems we had in Iraq were actually not problems of decisions. The decisions were clear; everybody knew what we were going to do. They were problems of how those decisions would get executed with structures that were really just not up to the task. That is when I made a decision that was something of a mistake. I tried, because things were coming unstuck in Iraq, to insert the NSC into the execution of those processes because I was thoroughly dissatisfied with the way the execution was happening in the Pentagon. That made it extremely difficult—That made my relationship with Don more difficult, even though it never, by the way—Don and I have remained friends. Steve can attest to this—He used to come to my Christmas sing and sing \"We Three Kings,\" and play \"Twelve Days of Christmas,\" and so forth.\n\nHadley\n\nI think it was \"three geese a-laying\" or something.\n\nRice\n\n\"Six geese a-laying.\" Anyway, it wasn't an unfriendly relationship, but that was really hard. The NSC is a decision-making process. It is really hard when there is a gap between the decisions and the executions.\n\nBrown\n\nBut you have to fill that gap in at the NSC level sometimes, because however the decision is, the implementation can go in different directions—\n\nHadley\n\nBut there is a right way and a wrong way, and this was an experiment.\n\nRice\n\nYes.\n\nHadley\n\nThere is another experiment we did. If you go back to the Tower Commission report, which was [Edmund] Muskie, [John] Tower, and Brent Scowcroft, and I was the draft person on that report—If you look at the section on the NSC process, which is what the Tower Commission's report—and read the section on the National Security Advisor, it is really quite good. It is the model Condi tried to follow and the one I tried to follow. It's Brent's model. There is one thing in there that is very interesting, which says that the NSC can never be involved in execution. That's dangerous. That came of course from the [Oliver] Ollie North—where Ollie North was executing out of the NSC.\n\nRice\n\nRight.\n\nHadley\n\nThat actually is the one part of the Tower Commission I disagreed with, because you don't do the execution—\n\nRice\n\nBut you have to help direct it.\n\nHadley\n\nYou have to coordinate and ensure that it is done. That's what we did when we brought Doug Lute in. After we had the decision to do the surge in Iraq, and what we called the silent surge in Afghanistan, Doug Lute was brought in and his whole job was to focus 100 percent of his time on the execution, not by doing the execution, but by overseeing the execution, making sure the agencies had task deadlines. When an agency was falling behind, if it was State, he would either call Condi or come to me and say, \"Condi needs to know that her people are not performing on X.\"\n\nRice\n\nAs Secretary, you might not know. You're sitting up here.\n\nHadley\n\nThen I would call Condi, and Condi would say—Because the problem on execution is too much is done as \"business as usual.\" \"Business as usual\" doesn't work.\n\nRice\n\nEverything falls to the second, third—But just on the Iraq stabilization group, because it is an important distinction, the piece that we couldn't do out there was we couldn't actually execute on the ground, so it was frustrating for the NSC. I think the Pentagon didn't like the fact that we would say, \"How come there are still these attacks on the electrical grid?\" That was the tension.\n\nThe piece that came out of that that was right, and again it slid a little bit from me into the gray area—[Lewis Paul, III] Jerry Bremer is out there and stuff just keeps appearing in the newspaper. Now Jerry is a really good guy and I'm quite certain he wasn't intending to continually surprise the process, but when you wake up on a particular morning and Jerry has published in the New York Times or Washington Post the seven steps to the Iraqi sovereignty, and nobody has seen them, including the President of the United States, you have a problem.\n\nThat was supposed to be a direct relationship between Don and Jerry. That was supposed to be a reporting relationship where it just wasn't materializing on a day-to-day basis in the way that Jerry was making decisions. He's out in Iraq; he's got to make decisions. He can't wait for the bureaucratic processes to catch up with him out in a war zone. So at that point, out of the stabilization group, I got Bob Blackwill, who kept a close eye on the ground, and every day I simply talked to Jerry, which was not wildly popular in the Pentagon, but that, I don't think, was a mistake.\n\nHadley\n\nWe need to back up a step because I realize there's one step that's missing. After we did Iraq in 2003 and it is decided that we need to have somebody out there and it is Jerry Bremer, we had been hearing, partly from Don Rumsfeld, all this stuff about how the interagency is broken and Washington is broken and Washington is the bottleneck and decisions out of Washington are the problem.\n\nRice\n\nYes, it's taking too much time.\n\nHadley\n\nLots of complaints. So we got, and negotiated, a document, which the President signed, and which Colin Powell, as Secretary of State—\n\nRice\n\nSigned off on.\n\nHadley\n\n—he saw, which basically said that DoD [Department of Defense] has the lead for postwar Iraq. Not the exclusive, because Jerry Bremer had a lot of State Department people and he had the benefit of all the State Department work that everybody says we threw away, but in fact we did not throw away and was available to Jerry. But we shut down the interagency process. The deputies committee stopped meeting on Iraq.\n\nRice\n\nThe interagency process went to the field.\n\nHadley\n\nWe said that we're going to do the interagency coordination in the field, Jerry Bremer with the lead. Jerry then reports back to Don, and Don keeps the President and the NSC involved. Washington is out of the picture, Don. You've got the lead, because that's what that document said. And Don, you have an interagency team in Iraq and your guy Jerry Bremer is going to chair it and you're going to do the interagency coordination out there, so Washington would be no longer a problem. It did not work.\n\nIt did not work because it was fractious in Baghdad. Jerry Bremer and the military commander did not talk to one another, and the link back to Don Rumsfeld did not work. Don didn't really keep the President informed. So Condi then had this jury-rigged system of the stabilization group to try to fix that problem. It was imperfect. After the surge in Iraq we tried to fix it another way, which was the Doug Lute approach. That, I think, worked better.\n\nRice\n\nI think so. But on the political side, it did work, because from then on—I'll relate an incident to you. I went to a football game—\n\nHadley\n\nYou're right. In terms of not surprising the President and linking Jerry to the President, she did—\n\nRice\n\nAnd in terms of the politics, what we were going to do politically in Iraq to get from where we were with the governing council, to an interim government, to sovereignty transfer, to a constitution and an election—One reason that we knew we had to do something—This gets into Iraq, but it is an important story.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nRice\n\nOne reason that we knew we had to do something was that all of a sudden, Jerry's seven steps come out, and [Ali al-] Sistani, who none of us to this day have ever met, but we hung on his every word because the guy could kill us in Iraq or help us in Iraq, and mostly he was helpful. He had great instincts. I remember calling him the Ben Franklin of Iraq. He was never going to run for office because he was a cleric. He was a quietist; he didn't believe in the Iranian model. He was terrific. He blasts us, saying, \"An unelected Iraqi government cannot write the constitution for the Iraqi people. Only the elected representatives can do that.\"\n\nSo we're in an NSC meeting and everybody is talking about how Sistani has said this, and maybe that's not right. The President looks at us all and says, \"How did I get on the wrong side of elections?\" All of a sudden you start thinking, Man, how could this have happened? Well, it's because this process isn't working in the field. These decrees come out, and so Jerry and I start talking.\n\nI'm at a football game then, and Bob Blackwill, who had gone out into the field to help out—\n\nRiley\n\nYou're in Washington, or Alabama?\n\nRice\n\nIn Washington. I'd gone to a Ravens' game that day because I get a chance to take a Sunday afternoon off. I always carried a secure phone with me. There is an aide in the back of the box, who says, \"Bob Blackwill is on the phone for you from Baghdad.\" It's three o'clock in the afternoon in Baltimore. Maybe it was Washington. I can't remember which game it was, but it is nine or ten o'clock at night in Baghdad, and I'm thinking, What in the world is he calling about at this hour?\n\nBob says, \"Jerry is going to release a revision of his seven points, and I thought you'd better know about it.\" I say, \"You know, that's something the President of the United States may want to see before the world sees it. Why don't you tell Jerry to wait until he can send it back to Washington?\" Bob says, \"I think you'd better tell Jerry.\" I then get Jerry on the phone—This is all in the owner's box at the football game—and I say, \"Jerry, I think this is something the President might want to see. As a matter of fact, why don't you get on a plane and come back here and talk to the NSC, because this is a big decision. We've had one false start on this. If we mess it up again, we're just in deep trouble.\"\n\nJerry says, \"Absolutely. I'll be there Wednesday.\" This is Sunday. I go into the Oval the next morning and tell the President what I've done. He said, \"Did you tell Don?\" I said, \"I wanted to tell you first.\" He said, \"I don't know if Jerry needs to come back here.\" I said, \"OK, do you want to read about how Iraq is going to get to sovereignty in the newspaper?\" He smiled and said, \"OK, so when will he be here?\"\n\nThat process got better, I think, with Jerry. Jerry doesn't get enough credit for moving from this governing council thing, where they changed Presidents every month, and where he could never find half of them because they loved traveling the capitals of the world on behalf of the new Iraq, to a transitional administrative law, which became the framework for the constitution, to the interim government with [Ayad] Allawi as Prime Minister, to the transfer of sovereignty that takes place about a year after the statue falls, then to the elections and the writing of the constitution. I don't think people give enough credit for how well Jerry shepherded that process along. Once we got it back into the NSC structure, then everybody could have a say.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me ask you: In retrospect, how would you structure an apparatus to best deal with this kind of policy execution?\n\nRice\n\nI think the Doug Lute thing worked pretty well.\n\nHadley\n\nIt worked OK. It's probably not ideal. It worked because a) you had somebody focused exclusively on execution; b) we started having metrics, in the sense that you would take the strategy, you would have a set of tasks, assign the agency, assign the office, and you had deadlines; c) what we don't still do very well as a government is have metrics not just on the input side, but also on the output side. Then the State Department committed to send 74 people in the next six months.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nHadley\n\nWhat's the schedule of the deployment of those people? When will they be designated? When will they be deployed? When will they show up in Iraq? Doug constructed that matrix and would birddog it with the State Department and when they would fall behind he would call Condi. So Condi would pull it up, give them a big kick, and it would get done.\n\nThe thing we didn't and still don't do well, executionally, is if you're trying to produce certain kinds of effects on the ground, are you producing those effects? Those kinds of metrics we still do not do very well. Doug had a series of interagency groups that he pulled together to oversee the execution. It's not ideal.\n\nRice\n\nBut structures are not a substitute for people, either. I actually think that when we got ready to do the surge and Doug was there, we had a better alignment. Part of it was that both Gates and I had been high Principals in the National Security Council; we knew how to work that system. Gates had been Deputy National Security Advisor for Brent; I had been National Security Advisor. So we kind of knew how to do that. Doug was important and almost like an alarm going off, but there was no pushback from Gates or from me.\n\nHadley\n\nCondi and Gates had to be joined at the hip, which they were, and understood that they together needed to cooperate if it was going to be good. Then of course you needed Crocker and Petraeus—\n\nRice\n\nPetraeus had the right personality.\n\nHadley\n\nThat's what really made the execution. As Condi says, Doug was a bell ringer and a bit of an enforcer.\n\nBrown\n\nCan we talk about the substance of the surge just a little bit since you're on it?\n\nRiley\n\nLet's by all means do that, but one other question about this: I'm assuming it also works because there is an exhaustion factor within the government, too. You've had some very rough couple of years and maybe there were people who were willing to try something at this stage that they weren't earlier?\n\nRice\n\nPart of what I found when I was Secretary was that there was a lot of, \"The State Department is not part of this war. They're not pulling their weight.\" Bob Gates helped there when he said that there are more people in military bands than there are in the Foreign Service, which is true. The State Department had limited capacity. But I learned something else. When I actually started to dig down, there were reasons people weren't agreeing to go to Baghdad and it had nothing to do with ideological opposition to the war.\n\nLet's say I'm a 35-year-old Arabist who is serving in Cairo, and I've got my family with me, so I've got kids who are 10 and 12. It turns out that if I want to go to Baghdad, my family has to move back to Washington. Of course I don't want to go to Baghdad. We did a simple thing: The family can stay in Cairo. That way, TDY [Temporary Duty], you can come back from Baghdad from time to time and see your family. You don't have to ship them all the way back. Just a very simple thing like that, and all of a sudden we had many more volunteers for Baghdad of the level that we wanted. We were getting mostly older people who didn't have those considerations, or young people who didn't have those considerations. But it is the 35- to 40-year-old who has the right experience to go into a difficult circumstance like that.\n\nSo some of it was just weeding out stuff that was making it difficult for State to do its job.\n\nHadley\n\nIt's important because if you're going to do whole-of-government in a place like Iraq, you have a problem that the other agencies—Agriculture, Justice, Treasury—not only are they not expeditionary, i.e., ready to go into a war zone, they're not even deployable overseas.\n\nRice\n\nThat's right.\n\nHadley\n\nState Department was deployable overseas but it wasn't really expeditionary, like the military, to go into a combat zone. That was a huge gap.\n\nRice\n\nWe did several things. Part of the problem, by the way, is congressional oversight. If I want USDA, [United States Department of] Agriculture, to send some—because I had then responsibility for the whole-of-government, so State Department was supposed to mobilize these resources. I want three agricultural experts for Baghdad. You know, the oversight committee for Ag doesn't see why they ought to be in Baghdad, as opposed to dealing with Iowa. The whole-of-government concept sounds good, but it is actually difficult because it's not as if these agencies aren't doing other things.\n\nWe made a decision early on that we weren't going to send Homeland people to Baghdad and get accused of ignoring the security of the United States in order to have people serving in Baghdad. Treasury turned out to be more deployable than I would have thought. They sent people quite easily. The problem is that you're sort of stuck then with a lot of contractors because you can't quite mobilize the U.S. government. That's where we came up with this idea of a civilian response corps. It would look more like the National Guard and be deployable. So if you were a prosecutor in Arizona and maybe you wanted to give a two-year commitment like a National Guard officer does, that would allow you to have those civilians who can do it.\n\nWe did a lot of things to make the State Department expeditionary. For instance—I think I mentioned this to you last time—I had as many officers in Germany with 80 million people as I had in India with a billion people. So I moved 300 people out of Europe, to say I really don't need helpful people about British politics. I can talk to Tony Blair any time I want to. By doing that we freed up more people to do—It turns out there is a part of the Department that loves the expeditionary life, people who love being in the highlands of Guatemala. They also don't mind being in Kabul.\n\nSo, figuring that out, and then finally we came up with these structures, the Provincial Reconstruction Teams, which were brigade commanders who had in their team the reconstruction person, the diplomat, all of those people. Then I had to make a call that we weren't going to try to have two chains of command. Those diplomats reported to the brigade commander, which was wildly unpopular in the State Department. But when I said, \"OK, how are you going to protect yourself without it?\" Then all of a sudden, people said, \"Oh, well, yes, maybe it will work after all.\" It was partly that there was some underbrush that needed to be cut to make it work.\n\nHadley\n\nSo you see the problem for the Bush administration: You've got wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that require a whole reconstruction of how we do business, and new kinds of relationships and capacities and structures and all the rest. At the same time, we've got the more traditional War on Terror, of which Iraq and Afghanistan were a part but not the whole. That, of course, requires you to bring down the walls in the intelligence, and with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nRice\n\nThen you've got all the normal stuff.\n\nHadley\n\nYou're renovating, you're reforming, and you're waging war simultaneously on a number of different fronts, and that made it pretty challenging.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd there's no relevant experience like in World War II?\n\nRice\n\nA little bit of Vietnam—\n\nHadley\n\nThis is a different kind of war.\n\nRice\n\nIt is a different kind of war.\n\nBrown\n\nRelated to the process and who the President talks with and consults with and so on, the surge was not simply about numbers, obviously. As I understand it, this was part of your point with him, that it was objectives. But more than that, what was going on was a fundamental change, as well as debate, within the military about counterinsurgency and how you conduct it.\n\nRice\n\nThat's right.\n\nBrown\n\nWorking its way through in '04, '05, and then published in '06, was this new manual of the Army and Marine Corps. Of course Petraeus was the major author, John Nagl and someone—To what extent was that change in grand strategy for conducting counterinsurgency—To what extent was the President exposed to that in the period here where he is beginning to—whether he shifted or not, or whether you shifted—to what extent was he apprised of that series of beliefs and—?\n\nRice\n\nSteve should speak more to this, but one thing that we have to realize is that we had a National Security Council meeting in which we addressed Iraq three times a week, in addition to the President's intelligence briefing in which he addressed Iraq, and all the time that he spent thinking about Iraq, so as things are unfolding, of course, he is aware of them. But Steve then structured a process where he would systematically encounter the whole counterinsurgency by having people in, like Eliot Cohen.\n\nHadley\n\nYou'll want to look at the President's book, because he talks about being aware of Petraeus, and being aware of the counterinsurgency doctrinal development, and he was very much so. One of the elements of this is that basically the Army had to relearn how to fight counterinsurgency.\n\nBrown\n\n[George] Casey was against it, wasn't he?\n\nHadley\n\nThat's a little too strong. Casey took it part of the way, but in parallel with what Casey was doing, there was really a revolution from below of people who had—The commanders in Iraq were given a lot of freedom. The story of Tal Afar, which is actually in one of the President's speeches in 2006, is an example where—and I've forgotten his name, famous in song and story, an Army colonel [H. R. McMaster] who becomes an advisor to Petraeus in revising the counterinsurgency strategy—He had actually implemented a counterinsurgency strategy in Tal Afar with great effect. We learned about it and it was showcased in one of the President's speeches in 2006.\n\nSo there is this group of people in Iraq who are faced with these challenges of dealing with the challenges they have on the ground. They are rediscovering, practically, on the ground, out of necessity, the techniques of counterinsurgency, even though it wasn't a sort of counterinsurgency grand strategy at the top level. What Petraeus does when he goes to Iraq to write the strategy is he pulls these guys in and he mines their experience from Iraq and turns it into doctrine. Then at that point some of the people from the Vietnam era recall a little bit about the lessons learned there.\n\nOne of the great strengths of the military is they topple Saddam [Hussein]. They find they are in a different kind of war in Iraq that they're not really trained and equipped for. They then have to figure it out on the march, if you will, and they do. So you have Petraeus developing the doctrinal roots of the counterinsurgency. You have people on the ground learning it and doing it. And then you have the President at the highest level embracing it and making it the cornerstone of the surge, because you're right, it is as much the change in strategy as the numbers.\n\nSo you can say that in some sense that's why, for example, this Washington Post reporter—I've forgotten his name [Thomas Ricks]—can write a book, I think it is The Gamble [The Gamble: General Petraeus and the American Military Adventure in Iraq], that says Ray Odierno was the author of the surge because he was developing it on the ground as the number two commander in Iraq, and he was. You can say that Dave Petraeus was the author of the surge because he had developed the doctrinal basis drawing on that experience, which he did. You can say that the President of the United States was the author of the surge because he was the one who basically gave the order, adopted the strategy, and empowered all those people down the road, which he did. Like all successes, it has many fathers.\n\nAll of those processes are going on at once. There is a fourth process in the development of the surge, which is one that Pete Pace is owed a lot of gratitude by the nation for, because Pete Pace says, \"All right, if we're going to do the surge, I want the surge to be George Casey's policy. I want it to be George Casey's strategy.\" Because what Pete Pace didn't want to have happen is a split within the Army about \"Casey failed; the new team succeeds.\" He didn't want that within the Army.\n\nSecondly, he didn't want to have a split within the military, because a split either within the military, or between the military and the Commander in Chief—A split between the Commander in Chief and his military in a time of war is a civil/military crisis of enormous proportions. A split within the military would have been used by the Congress to defeat the surge.\n\nSo Pete Pace very artfully is bringing the military to the table on behalf of the surge so that at the end of the day he can say to the President of the United States at the last hour, \"Mr. President, your military supports the surge.\" That includes the outgoing regional commander, [John] Abizaid, who was initially skeptical; the outgoing commander Casey; and the incoming commanders of Petraeus and [William] Fallon, and all the Joint Chiefs. Pete Pace does that so that when the President announces the surge, and the silence is deafening throughout the country, and the Congress initially says, \"We're going to fund the Defense Department; we're not going to fund the surge. We're going to put operational constraints so that you can't deploy the people\"—all the things that Congress can try to do—\n\nThey assume they're going to be able to have military leaders who will support their view, help them defeat the surge. They have a set of hearings and all the military is in the same boat, as I used to say. Some leaned right, some leaned left, but they were all in the same boat and the boat was balanced. That's what Pete Pace did, working behind the scenes. It was terribly important.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you talk about the relationship with the Iraq Study Group? Did that ultimately prove to be—?\n\nHadley\n\nI will give you my thing on the Iraq Study Group. The Iraq Study Group was something that the President supported because we knew we were going to have to change the policy but we didn't know exactly what it was going to look like and we needed a landing zone out there that would have bipartisan support. There was some skepticism, but Condi and I prevailed upon the President to embrace the Study Group, and the reason you know that is because [James A., III] Jim Baker, no fool, wouldn't have done it if he didn't specifically have the blessing of the President of the United States, and he did.\n\nSecond—a little-known secret—most of the ideas in the Iraq Study Group came from testimony from administration witnesses, because we all went in there and we told them exactly what we thought we should be doing. So they saw pieces of the surge as it was being developed in our thinking in the Iraq Study Group report.\n\nThird—They had 70-some recommendations. I used to remember them. We embraced and told the world we embraced all but three of them, which were: talk to Iran; have a firm deadline for withdrawal; and there was one other, which I can't remember. So we actually were prepared. The President thanked the Study Group, met with the Study Group, and said that we had adopted all of their recommendations.\n\nBut it got swamped in the public mind for the following reasons. The way that we set it up was the Iraq Study Group, I think, was going to come out on December 7th, and the President was going to give his speech on the surge on the 11th or 12th, so they were going to be coincident in time. Of course, the Iraq Study Group said, \"If your local military commanders think it is advisable, you could do a surge.\" That was the hook.\n\nBut the President decided that in that time frame he wasn't ready to give the speech. Not because he hadn't decided on the policy, but Bob Gates had just come in as Secretary of Defense. He wanted Bob to go to the region, and he wanted publicly for it to be perceived and factually to be that Bob would come back and say, \"Mr. President, I've looked at the situation on the ground, and I think the surge is right and I support it.\" The President called up and he said, \"I'm comfortable with the speech, but I don't want to give it until Bob gets back.\"\n\nThe speech then gets delayed until January. So the Iraq Study Group comes out and the speech is delayed. The press line is, \"The President thought he was going to be able to embrace the Iraq Study Group, but he can't because it's not the right policy, so the President is going to have to make up his own strategy and will announce it in January.\" Well, that was ridiculous because the President had largely already decided on the strategy. The reason that that got some currency is when the Iraq Study Group came out, two groups condemned it. In the region, the Saudis and our friends all basically said, \"This is a cover for retreat.\"\n\nRice\n\nYes, I saw them not too long after that and they were—\n\nRiley\n\n\"They\" being?\n\nRice\n\nThe Saudis, the Egyptians—the entire Middle East moderate, anti-Iran group.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd you're speaking with the Foreign Ministers?\n\nRice\n\nYes, I was with the Foreign Ministers, but I also went to the region and I saw the King; I saw [Hosni] Mubarak. Not popular.\n\nHadley\n\nTheir narrative and the Wall Street Journal narrative was the same: that this was the people around [George H. W.] Bush 41 providing a cover for a retreat and surrender. Well, once it is characterized that way in the region and in the Wall Street Journal, the President can't embrace it, even though we implemented 97 percent of its recommendations. So in the end it did not serve as the landing zone we had hoped for, because it was characterized unfairly by the Wall Street Journal and the region, and also because of—and I didn't see it at the time—the effect of the President's canceling his speech that was supposed to be given five days after the report was released and deciding to do it in January, which he did for completely unrelated reasons, but which the press read as a rejection of the—\n\nRice\n\nThere is one other part of that narrative, too. If the conservatives, meaning the region and the Wall Street Journal, saw it as retreat, the Washington Post and others saw it as vindication. It was the adults, the realists, 41's people. Of course, it comes on the heels of the congressional defeat. You have the Republican congressional defeat.\n\nHadley\n\nThat's true.\n\nRice\n\nThere were a lot of people on the Hill saying, \"If you just had adopted this. If Jim Baker and—\" So the President can't do it for the reasons that it is associated with a retreat, and he can't do it because it is really an assault on his leadership. I remember talking to him about it and he said, \"I'm Commander in Chief. I don't care what—\" I said, \"Let's talk about that before you go out and say that.\" [laughter] When these Washington Post things started appearing, and the New York Times—I'm sure you experienced this too—\n\nHadley\n\n\"The adults are back in charge.\"\n\nRice\n\nYes, the adults are back in charge. He was furious. Then the chore is not to have him react so badly to it that now we're in a fight with Jim Baker, who we've told, \"Oh, yes, Jim, go do this.\" There was a terrible moment there.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat terrible moment?\n\nRice\n\nWhere I thought he was going to call Jim and say something rude, not because he was mad at Jim, but he was mad at the reaction.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nRice\n\nSo all this carefully laid work of how it was going to be a landing zone and everything kind of comes unstuck from both ends and Steve and I are on this little lily pad in the middle of the ocean, which is roiling around us, about the Iraq Study Group. I did something then. The President and Steve and I talked about it. I said, \"I'll go out and challenge the assumption on Iran and Syria.\" I did. I challenged it in a very direct way.\n\nHadley\n\nRight.\n\nRice\n\nI said, \"You know, you can talk to the Iranians all you want. It's not going to get you anywhere. Diplomacy is not just talking.\" I felt a little bad. In fact, I called Jim and I said, \"Jim, this is not at you.\" But somebody had to back off the Iraq Study Group at that point.\n\nHadley\n\nThat's right.\n\nRice\n\nI was getting ready, as it turns out, to do this Neighbors' Conference. The Iranians would be there, and so forth. We could say we're having this Neighbors' Conference. I basically said, \"You don't have to be a grand strategist to know that an Israeli-Palestinian deal would be a good deal, but who has actually gotten one done?\" I was probably the most aggressive against the Iraq Study Group on the diplomacy side, partly because we needed to back off—not the Study Group and not the people on the Study Group, but this perception that it was 41's policy coming back.\n\nHadley\n\nRather than an out-landing zone to bring us out of hostilities and out of the combat zone, we had constructed a landing zone that turned out to be right in the middle, and we had to abort the mission, which we did. We aborted the mission and we said, \"Stay tuned, we'll give you our strategy.\" Then in January we rolled out our strategy, which was the same strategy we had before the Iraq Study Group.\n\nBrown\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, was it an editorial or some op-ed piece?\n\nRice\n\nThey did op-eds. You had Fox News saying these things.\n\nHadley\n\nAnd we met with them.\n\nRice\n\nI met with the Fox guys. \"Oh, is he going to retreat?\" \"Is he going to take this line?\" It was chaos. I think those few days after the Iraq Study Group was released had to be two or three of the worst days, because you're trying to pull the President off the ceiling because he doesn't like the way they're talking about him. You're trying to pull the Arabs off the ceiling because they're just sure we're going to be out of Iraq tomorrow. You're trying to keep the conservatives from assuming you're about to roll up your tent and go home. It just broke out all over.\n\nHadley\n\nAs my grandmother used to say, quoting Robert Burns, \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley.\" Well, this \"ganged aft agley.\"\n\nBrown\n\nDuring this period, of course, there is a good deal of concern about congressional reaction.\n\nRice\n\nYes.\n\nBrown\n\nParticularly because it is right after the election. To what extent was Karl Rove involved in any of these discussions with respect to the alternatives?\n\nRice\n\nSteve can speak to this, but let me speak to Karl Rove's role more broadly because it is true here. Karl was trusted by the President. Of course, Karl had a voice. But Karl assiduously stuck to what he knew, which was the politics. Karl was not in there trying to tell Steve that the surge ought to be done for these military—Karl was a voice, but not a definitive one in most, in any of, these debates. It's just not how he saw his role. He was a smart guy who understood politically where we were going, but I never heard Karl say, \"The President can't do this for political purposes.\" It's just not the way he operated. And I don't think, by the way, the President would have allowed that.\n\nHadley\n\nEarly in the first term the issue came up about who should attend National Security Council meetings. At the end of the first term we started having the communications people there and congressional people there at the meeting because policy becomes communication and what Congress will support. The issue came, should Karl Rove be at the meeting? The President said, \"No, I never want Karl at an NSC meeting, never, not once. I've talked to Karl about it and he understands. Because I do not want to suggest in any way that I am making national security decisions on the basis of domestic politics.\"\n\nThat didn't prevent Karl from coming in and offering his two cents about the surge and how the country would react, which was very useful. But in terms of the formal process involving the surge, the President didn't want him there. That's the thing that so surprised me, when David Axelrod, who is in a way Karl's equivalent, is attending all these NSC meetings and going on the Sunday shows, explaining the foreign policy of the United States. George Bush would not have had it.\n\nRiley\n\nAnything about the White House Chief of Staff and his role?\n\nRice\n\nAndy [Card] was at every NSC meeting. If there was a reason he couldn't attend, then Josh, and then Joel [Kaplan], who was Deputy, would attend. But again, the process that you want to set up, since you know that these are all trusted advisors of the President—Of course, State is going to be presenting more of a State view, but you would also like the Secretary of State to be able to get out of the head of the State Department and just talk about things.\n\nIt was similar with the Chief of Staff. Rather than the Chief of Staff being somebody who was presenting the inside view, or the domestic view, Andy was a trusted advisor to the President and he would just engage in the discussion. Occasionally, he would say, \"I don't think this is going to fly on the Hill.\" He had a better perspective from which to say that than the Secretary of State did.\n\nThere was less bureaucratic role-playing. I've now experienced two of these, both with 41 and 43, and it is a little bit of a caricature of good NSC processes that the Secretary of State presents on behalf of State. Yes, sometimes the diplomatic this or that. But when you get into these discussions, as Steve described them, where people walk in thinking one thing and they come out thinking another, it is because they've talked as human beings, all of whom are trusted by the President, and the Chief of Staff very much was involved in that way.\n\nHadley\n\nWe had very good Chiefs of Staff. The deal we had was we kept them fully informed and they let us be National Security Advisors. Josh was the most self-effacing sometimes. He would say, \"I don't have much to contribute.\" I'd say, \"Josh, you have a lot to contribute because you're not a prisoner of any of these bureaucracies. You've got good sense and you know politics, and you need to know what the President knows. When you have reactions you need to explain them.\" He said, \"That's fine,\" but he didn't try to get in the way of being National Security Advisor.\n\nOn the other hand, I would use him and involve him when the issue was bigger than just a national security issue. For example, when we were doing the surge in Iraq, I would ask him to convene a White House meeting bringing in Karl Rove, Legislative Affairs, Congressional Affairs. For example, the Crocker-Petraeus—When they come back after the surge in September and give their testimony, we have an elaborate choreography of how we're going to do the run-up to, during, and after that. That gets done not in the NSC meeting, because it is not really foreign policy; it is about domestic politics and communications and congressional relations.\n\nI would go to Josh and say, \"Josh, I need you to convene, at the table in your office, all these White House groups.\" Sometimes we'd have Bob Gates come over. Sometimes Condi would come over. The Vice President would be there. We would work those kinds of broader strategies, and Josh would be at the chair running those and I would give the foreign policy perspective. So if you do it right, the Chief of Staff can be a terrific asset for supporting the President and giving the President what he needs.\n\nRice\n\nWe were just fortunate. Both Andy and Josh were easy people to work with.\n\nRiley\n\nWe talked a lot about process. How was the President, himself, different when you came in in 2005, from President George W. Bush in 2001?\n\nRice\n\nThat's a very interesting question.\n\nHadley\n\nI was at Harvard, not exactly Bush country—\n\nRiley\n\nHe got his MBA there.\n\nHadley\n\n—taking my licks after the administration. Joe Nye, who is a wonderful guy, said, \"You know, people have talked a lot about the first term and the second term, and some people think things went wrong in the first term and got fixed in the second term.\" He said, \"I have a theory.\" I said, \"What's that, Joe?\" He said, \"I have a theory that actually Presidents learn on the job and that a second-term President is very different from a first-term President.\" Of course Joe is absolutely right.\n\nOne of the differences between second term and first term is that I'm working with a second-term President, and Condi is working with a first-term President. I'll give you an example. I'm going to get this wrong, but the thematics are right. It's pretty clear we're going to have to go into Iraq because Saddam is not going to leave and the diplomacy is fracturing. The President decides he's going to meet with his congressional leaders and talk about Iraq and give them a preview of the policy. So we all come in and sit down. I'm sitting behind the President.\n\nRiley\n\nIn the Cabinet room?\n\nRice\n\nCabinet room.\n\nHadley\n\nUncharacteristically, he has Condi sitting across from him, right next to the Vice President. All the congressional leaders are there. He says, \"I want to talk to you about Iraq. Condi is going to explain our policy.\" Condi, who never shows you anything, just gives a little—Nobody gave it another thought.\n\nRiley\n\nFor the tape, she jumps a little bit.\n\nHadley\n\nShe jumps a little bit. She did not know this was coming. Of course she gamely and ably sets out his policy. Fast-forward to the surge. The President says, \"We've got to have the members of Congress in and I've got to explain why I did this.\" So he has them, and the idea that I would have led that briefing would have been laughable. He's out there, \"Let me tell you why I'm doing this.\"\n\nThat's the difference between a first-term President and a second-term President. When it happened the first time, Condi initially winced and then I winced, because the message he's sending to the Congress is, This is Condi's policy, not my policy. When you're sending the troops to war—I'm not criticizing the President. I've said this to him, actually, and he says, \"Yes, you're right.\" It has got to be the President's policy and it's got to be out of the President's mouth. But the President felt a little more comfortable with Condi doing it in the first term.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nHadley\n\nIn the second term it would have never occurred to him not to do it himself. That's the difference between a first- and second-term President.\n\nRice\n\nThere are two other differences. One is, how he worked with the military and the Pentagon changed dramatically. In the first term he was more deferential to the generals, and Don, on matters of—I used to teach civil-military relations and I would always say, \"When you have a good functioning, civilian-controlled system, you want the civilians to tell you why you're about to do something. You want the civilians to tell you where you're about to do something, and basically you want the civilians to control when. What you want is the military to tell you how.\"\n\nBut we all know that how blends into when and where and so forth. In the initial stages—and we tried to push the President more on this—the military would come in and do these briefings. They were, as military briefings are, 131 slides of PowerPoint, of which only three said anything. So you try to push them, to say, \"What does that mean?\" He was reticent about doing it. I asked him one time, I said, \"Why didn't you push on it? I could tell you weren't comfortable with that. Why didn't you push on that?\" He said, \"I don't want to be Lyndon Johnson in the basement of the White House choosing targets.\"\n\nSo he went in with a preconception of how the Commander in Chief receives information from the military. Now, he would push on things like collateral damage: \"How many civilians am I putting in danger?\" I remember with Afghanistan he was very intent on maybe trying to get food bombs dropped first. Was it possible to do humanitarian assistance before the military action so that the Afghan people would know we weren't the Russians? Those things would come out. But when it came to the military side of it, he was reticent to push.\n\nRiley\n\nDon't lose your train of thought on this, but I want to ask on this specific point: Is he reluctant to push out of some sense of deference to the military, or is there a lack of confidence in his own grasp of the core issues?\n\nRice\n\nProbably a little bit of both. I mean, the military can be a little overwhelming to you. They come in and they—Just a little aside: We were trying to do Liberia and we eventually did it with 100 Marines on the ground and 2,500 on a ship. But when the Pentagon presented the option, it sounded like we were going to have to send 300,000 troops to overthrow Charles Taylor. They do have a way of presenting that, if you're not accustomed to it—And no President going into that situation, unless he has been in the National Security Council—not President [Barack] Obama, not President Clinton—would have known how to do this.\n\nI think some of it was, as Steve said, If I ask this question, am I going to expose that I don't know something that I'm supposed to know?\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nRice\n\nSome of it was deference because he didn't want to be Lyndon Johnson. He clearly thought about this.\n\nHadley\n\nLet me say one other thing. Remember, he's got Don Rumsfeld, who has already been Secretary of Defense—\n\nRice\n\nAnd Colin Powell.\n\nHadley\n\nAnd he has a sitting Vice President—\n\nRice\n\nWho has been Secretary of Defense, and a Secretary of State who has been Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nHadley\n\nThere is a sense in which he thinks, Well, I've got all these heavies to handle this military stuff. By the second term he basically says, as every President finally does, and hopefully our current President will—He says, \"War and peace is my issue.\" And it is.\n\nRice\n\nGoing all the way back to [Abraham] Lincoln. He just can't find it in himself to say, \"This General is a jerk,\" until one day he wakes up and thinks, This General is a jerk.\n\nHadley\n\nHe says, \"[George B.] McClellan, lend me your army.\" It's not McClellan's army; it's your army.\n\nRice\n\nIt takes Lincoln a long time to say, \"This guy is a jerk.\"\n\nHadley\n\n\"This is my army.\"\n\nRice\n\nThere is some of that in every President, but the rear-area security story is particularly interesting. We have these Principals meetings with these 131 slides—\n\nHadley\n\nThis is 2002.\n\nRice\n\nThe run-up to the war. It's the fall of 2002. We're still, particularly the President and Steve and I—I don't think anybody else believed it, but we're still hoping Saddam will decide to take a nice retirement someplace, and we're working every angle to try to make that happen. The Egyptians come in and say he'll take a billion dollars. The President said, \"I'll pay tomorrow if he goes away.\"\n\nFine by us. But we know that diplomacy is breaking down. So we start pushing the military planning. It is probably November or December of 2002. The military starts coming in and they've got the plans for how they're going to encounter the army, but they hadn't thought much about what happens as they push through. So in the Principals meeting, as they're presenting these 131 slides, none of which says what happens behind them as they push through, since we're going through with the light footprint, Steve and I concoct a phrase, \"What are you going to do about rear-area security?\" Meaning, who is going to fill in behind you as you push forward?\n\nThey hate this question. Basically they say, \"We've got it covered.\" Or, \"The Brits will do it.\" Totally unsatisfactory answers. We can't get an answer. Finally, I get it on the National Security Council agenda with the President in the chair. Before we go in, I say, \"Mr. President, here's what this rear-area security really means: It means there could be chaos behind us as we push through. The military doesn't have an answer for how they're going to fill in.\" So he gets in the seat and he says, \"OK, so now we've got this rear-area security thing; this is something Condi wanted on the agenda.\" I'm dead.\n\nHadley\n\nToast.\n\nRice\n\nThey give a half-hearted, half-baked answer. Steve comes to me afterward—I'm sitting at my desk—and he says, \"I would have resigned if he'd done that to me.\" I said, \"Steve, come on, I'm not going to resign because he—\" \"Yes, but he really hung you out to dry.\" I had told the President before, \"You really hung me out to dry on that.\" He said, \"What do you mean?\" He didn't mean to.\n\nSo we could never—We got it back on the agenda, but never quite in the way—and it turns out that the rear-area security problem, the fact that we don't have enough troops to deal with the chaos afterward, that we don't have enough troops to secure the weapons depots, becomes a big problem just before the election, when it turns out that the insurgents are using weapons from depots we were supposed to be guarding. But we could never quite—Now, in 2005, 2006, 2007, this would never happen.\n\nHadley\n\nIt's a little bit like the Bay of Pigs for [John F.] Kennedy. You learn, and next time you're not shy about asking the tough question.\n\nBrown\n\nDid the President blame Rumsfeld for that, for the lack of adequate attention to rear-area security?\n\nRice\n\nWhat happens is—It's not a matter of blame, but I do think the President got increasingly uncomfortable with the answers he was getting from the military. By 2006, he is at the place where he no longer has confidence in the Pentagon about these issues, and he really gives you the green light then, not just to push the Pentagon, but to look at alternatives.\n\nIt's happening in different places. It's happening in State, where we're looking at some alternatives. Pete Pace has drawn together this group of colonels. Pete came over to see me at State and he said, \"I want you to know we're doing this.\" It is August of 2006. He says, \"I keep seeing the numbers of trained Iraq security forces go up. We've got X number in the country and the problem is getting worse.\" So I have to go back and ask the first Principals questions. You go to Don with the 50 questions. When you did that?\n\nHadley\n\nSummer, I think August.\n\nRice\n\nThe President has basically, by then, released the national security system to say, OK, I can't rely on the Pentagon alone.\n\nHadley\n\nIn his book and in George Casey's book, in this July, August—It is July when we go and meet with the Maliki Cabinet for the first time, and in the evening out on the veranda he is talking to George Casey and he really hits him again on the troop issue and getting control of Baghdad. Casey gives him the line: \"You've got to take the hand off the bicycle. You've got to transfer responsibility to the Iraqis.\" The President asked him a series of questions and George finally says, \"I've got to give you a better answer on that, don't I, Mr. President?\" And the President says, \"Yes, you do, George.\" He never gets that better answer and that's why he looks for another way, because there wasn't a good answer.\n\nWhere George wanted to go, hand off the bicycle, transition—that's the right place to go, but you couldn't get there from where we were. That's the insight the President came up with. You couldn't get there, from here to there. You had to have a bridging strategy, and that's where the surge was.\n\nRice\n\nI remember, the President said one time—\"They kept saying, 'Take the hand off the bicycle.'\" We were out at the ranch. You and I were staying there, and he said, \"You know, I ride bicycles. You can take your hand off, but you don't want it to go into a ravine. That's what we're in; we're in a ravine.\" He was getting increasingly dissatisfied with the answers he was getting.\n\nHadley\n\nHe says to Don, \"All right, I'll take my hand off the bicycle, but if it starts to fall I've got to grab it back because I can't afford to let Iraq fail.\" In this process, strategy is not working. We can't get from here to there, and \"I can't let it fall. It's got to succeed.\" That is the thing that is Presidential leadership at its most fundamental. He basically says, \"The United States cannot afford to fail in Iraq. I've got to find a way to succeed.\"\n\nAt one point he says to Condi and me, as we're developing the surge, \"Do you think this can work?\" I said, \"Yes, Mr. President, I think it is going to be tough, but I think it can work.\" He said, \"If you ever think it can't work, you've got to tell me, because I can't send young men and women to die, and face their parents for a strategy that I don't think can succeed.\"\n\nRice\n\nI told him, \"It depends.\" That's when we got into—When I finally said, \"I now am comfortable with the surge,\" I remember saying to him—We were at the ranch in December. We were standing there and I said, \"You know it's your last card, though, don't you? If you play this card and it doesn't work, it's over.\" He said, \"Yes, I know that.\"\n\nHe really had come to a v"
