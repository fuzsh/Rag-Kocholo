        "text": "Sheikh Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar, the tribal chief who was today named interim president of Iraq, was born in 1958, the year in which Iraqi army officers overthrew the country's monarchy.\n\nSheikh Ghazi's grandfather, Ahmed Ajil Sheikh Ghazi, had served as a member of the King's parliament. A year later, their Shammar tribe supported an aborted military revolt against General Abdul Karim Qassim.\n\nDuring the mid-80s, Sheikh Ghazi and his family moved to Saudi Arabia. There, he studied engineering at the Petroleum and Minerals university, later continuing his studies at Georgetown university, in Washington.\n\nHe returned to Iraq after the US-led war that toppled Saddam Hussein, and was not known to have been active among Iraqi exiles opposed to Saddam's regime.\n\nAlthough his presidential post is largely ceremonial, his prominence could help Iraq to build ties with neighbouring Arab, Sunni Muslim countries - particularly Saudi, where he still has business interests.\n\nOne of Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's wives is a member of the Shammar tribe, which also has members in Syria.\n\nThe tribe, one of the largest in the Gulf region, includes Shi'ite as well as Sunni Muslim clans. Sheikh Ghazi, an Arab and a Sunni, built good relations with Kurds and Shi'ites who refused to endorse his rival Adnan Pachachi, who was seen as the favoured UN and US candidate for the presidency.\n\nIn an interview with the Saudi daily newspaper al-Riyadh, published today, Sheikh Ghazi belittled Mr Pachachi, saying the 81-year-old former foreign minister had been \"caught napping\" at meetings of the Iraqi Governing Council, and had no \"popular base inside Iraq\".\n\nHe was quoted as saying that UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who today announced his appointment, had told him that Mr Pachachi should get the presidency in recognition of his age and stature.\n\n\"How can honouring someone in his last days come at the expense of Iraq's future, which needs to be rejuvenated?\" Sheikh Ghazi was quoted as telling al-Riyadh.\n\nHe was also reported as saying that Paul Bremer, the head of the US-led occupation authority, had offered him \"several posts,\" including ambassador to Washington, if he would pass up the presidency.\n\n\"I told him: 'Search for whoever wants to go to Washington - I am the son of this country and am clinging to it, and it is the Iraqi people who want to nominate me, if you believe in democracy and respond to the people's will'.\"\n\nIn a televised address following his appointment, Sheikh Ghazi called on the UN to play a major role in \"bringing full sovereignty back to Iraq\".\n\n\"Iraqis are looking forward to a free, independent, democratic, unified and federal Iraq,\" the sheikh, who has blamed the post-Saddam chaos in Iraq on the US-led occupation, said. He has also denounced violence against US and other forces in Iraq.\n\nIbrahim al-Jaafari, of the Shia Muslim Dawa party, and Rowsch Shaways, speaker of parliament in the Kurdish autonomous region in Irbil, were today named as vice-presidents in the new government.\n\nThe Shia Muslim Dawa party, once based in Iran, launched a bloody campaign against Saddam Hussein's regime during the late 70s, but was crushed in 1982.\n\nThe group said it lost 77,000 members in its battle against Saddam. Mr Jaafari, who was born in Kerbala and educated at Mosul university, was picked as the first person to hold the rotating presidency of the governing council in July 2003.\n\nMr Shaways is a senior figure in the the Kurdish Democratic party, formed under the leadership of Mullah Mustalafa-al-Barzani in 1946 inside Soviet-occupied land in northern Iran."
