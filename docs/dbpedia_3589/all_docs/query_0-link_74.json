        "text": "Ibrahim al-Jaafari\n\nBackground:\n\nSupport: Dawa is one of the most influential Shia parties and the largest political group in Iraq. It is likely to be at the heart of an alliance among the Shia political elite. Most of its support comes from Shia across southern Iraq.\n\nChances: Stands a strong chance of emerging as the new Iraqi prime minister. A well-respected candidate who will probably head a Shia coalition that is currently being drawn up.\n\nGhazi al-Yawar No party as yet\n\nBackground A civil engineer, businessman and Sunni tribal leader from northern city of Mosul. Educated in US and a moderate Muslim, he has strong ties with Washington but has been critical of US military operations, particularly the assault on Falluja. He is currently the Iraqi president, a formal role with limited power.\n\nSupport: Moderate Sunnis may look up to him as their candidate.\n\nChances: Either he or his allies should emerge with a powerful position in the new government to help balance the inevitable Shia majority.\n\nAyad Allawi Iraqi National Accord\n\nBackground: The Iraqi prime minister, appointed by the US authorities in June. Born into a prominent Shia family of merchants, he trained as a neurologist and became an official in the Ba'ath party. He was posted to London, defected in the 1970s and lived in exile until last year. A key opposition figure to Saddam in exile.\n\nSupport: Not have much of a constituency among Iraqis, but backed by the US and Britain.\n\nChances: With the backing of Washington and London and the fact that by the time of the elections he will have been prime minister for seven months, he stands a good chance.\n\nMasoud Barzani Kurdistan Democratic party\n\nBackground: A Kurdish Sunni and former fighter in the Kurdish militia, the peshmerga. He took over the party after his well-respected father died in 1979. Has remained one of the two dominant figures in Kurdish politics since. Sat on the governing council and one of his aides is now a vice-president.\n\nSupport: Commands considerable support in the Kurdish region, including a large militia of peshmerga fighters.\n\nChances: Likely to emerge with a significant role in the new government for himself or one of his deputies.\n\nMoqtada al-Sadr Al-Sadr movement\n\nBackground: A young, hot-headed Shia cleric who has staged a series of uprisings against the US military. Has begun to turn his hardline movement towards politics and trades heavily on the reputation of his father Ayatollah Mohammad Sadiq al-Sadr, who was assassinated by Saddam's agents.\n\nSupport: Harnessed with surprising skill the frustrations of the young, poorly educated, urban, Shia unemployed.\n\nChances: Unlikely to stand himself, but will put forward his senior aides\n\nJalal Talabani Patriotic Union of Kurdistan\n\nBackground: A law graduate from Baghdad University and a Sunni Muslim who became one of the two powerful leaders in the Kurdish community. Set up his party in split from the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Clever politician, strong supporter of the war and powerful in the Kurdish region, around his base in Sulaymaniyah. An experienced politician who sat on the governing council.\n\nSupport: Strong support among the Kurdish population where the two rival parties have remained predominant for years. Commands a sizeable and well-armed militia of Peshmerga fighters.\n\nChances: Should have a key role in government,perhaps dependent on what political alliances he can make in the run-up to the vote.\n\nAbdul Aziz al-Hakim Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq\n\nBackground: Leader of another major Shia party, which fought against Saddam's regime though largely from exile in Iran and elsewhere. His brother, Ayatollah Mohammad Baqr al-Hakim, was killed in a car bomb in Najaf in August last year, leaving Abdul Aziz in charge. Sat on the governing council.\n\nSupport: The Supreme Council is a powerful organisation, which once had a 15,000-strong militia, the Badr Brigade, which has since been absorbed into the Iraqi security forces. Yet the party still suffers from having been in Iranian exile during the regime.\n\nChances: Likely to emerge as one of the top figures in an expected Shia government, though will have to accept second place to Dawa.\n\nAhmad Chalabi Iraqi National Congress\n\nBackground: A secular Shia from a wealthy, old money Iraqi family. Lived most of his life in exile and convicted in absentia of a massive bank fraud in Jordan. Once backed by the Pentagon and a member of the governing council but now working to ally himself with the Shia religious parties.\n\nSupport: Limited constituency and not highly regarded by many Iraqis, he is likely to piggyback on the support for the more popular Shia parties."
