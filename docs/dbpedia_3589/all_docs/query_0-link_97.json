        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 16 - Alternately sobbing, burying her face in her hands and shooting fearful glances at unseen captors, an Italian reporter being held hostage pleaded for her life and asked all foreigners to leave Iraq as she appeared in a crudely made videotape that surfaced Wednesday.\n\nThe hostage, Giuliana Sgrena, spoke in both Italian and French in the videotape, which was delivered anonymously to Associated Press Television News, as she called for a pullout, and emphasized her antiwar reporting. Ms. Sgrena, 56, who works for the leftist Italian newspaper Il Manifesto, was seized after interviewing Iraqis near Baghdad University on Feb. 4.\n\nAt one point in the videotape, she received some kind of verbal direction from a person with a high-pitched voice, possibly a woman.\n\n\"Pierre, please show the pictures of the children killed by the cluster bombs,\" Ms. Sgrena said in an appeal to her partner, Pierre Scolari. \"I ask my family to help me. I ask everyone who has fought with me against the war and the occupation.\" In red letters in the upper left-hand corner of the video were the words \"Mujahedeen Without Borders.\"\n\nIn Rome, the conservative government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi responded Wednesday with a 141-to-112 vote to keep financing Italy's deployments in Iraq. Also, Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini issued a statement saying work would continue for Ms. Sgrena's release, but he added that this would be done \"without altering the political, diplomatic and intelligence strategy\" Italy has followed up until now.\n\nThe release of the tape came as top candidates for prime minister in Iraq jockeyed for position on the day before the official announcement of how many seats in the 275-member national assembly each political party won in elections on Jan. 30. A Shiite religious coalition won 48 percent of the vote and is expected to receive a slim majority in the assembly.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
