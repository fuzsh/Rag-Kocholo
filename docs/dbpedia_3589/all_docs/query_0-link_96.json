        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the General George Casey interview, as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. We appreciate your coming to Charlottesville. We’ve just spent a few minutes covering ground rules before the tape came on, but I do want to mention, on the record, that this is being conducted under a veil of confidentiality and you’re the only person in the room who’s allowed to report anything outside the room.\n\nOne piece of administrative business for the advantage of the transcriber is that I’m Russell Riley and I’m chairing the session, but I need to go around the table and make sure everybody identifies himself or herself. Say a few words so the transcriber will know who’s talking.\n\nNelson\n\nI’m Mike Nelson, glad to be here.\n\nBakich\n\nI’m Spencer Bakich from Sweet Briar College.\n\nPerry\n\nI’m Barbara Perry and, as always, I’m the only woman in the room, so the voice identification is usually pretty easy for the transcriber.\n\nCasey\n\nI’m General George Casey. I retired from the Army three years ago. My last position was the Chief of Staff of the Army. Prior to that, I was the Commander of the Multi-National Force in Iraq for almost three years.\n\nRiley\n\nWe’re delighted to have you here. One of the things that I want to do on the record is to direct anybody who might have access to the transcript, to your book, Strategic Reflections, which is terrific. It really has a wealth of information in it and we don’t want to spend a lot of time repeating what appears there. You’re a very disciplined person who is reporting in this book much of what you’re seeing. You’re disciplined in some respects in not telling us very much about what you’re experiencing from other actors, especially political actors. You’re smiling.\n\nBakich\n\nFor the record, the general is smiling.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat I hope we can do is flesh out that picture of what you’re hearing from these people in your relationships with them.\n\nCasey\n\nI wrote that, targeting midlevel military officers, the War College–level students, so they’d understand what it was like to be a theater commander in this 21st-century environment. I tried to say, “This is what I saw, this is what I thought, this is what I did. You form your own judgments.” That’s what I wanted them to get out of it.\n\nRiley\n\nIt works very well, but I thought of—Who was it? Officer [Bill] Gannon from the old TV show, who said, “Just the facts, ma’am.” We’ve got a terrific array of facts here.\n\nPerry\n\nDragnet, that’s it.\n\nRiley\n\nThere are some impressions of people you were working with, and some value judgments about how things were going, that we could maybe get you to flesh out. Let me start by saying again that it’s a terrific piece of work and we’re indebted as political historians to having this here. I wonder if I could start with a broad overview question to get you to reflect a little bit about your time—Our starting point here is going to be January 21, 2001—talking about the Bush Presidency. Obviously, you’ve got a wealth of professional experience before that. Could you tell us a little bit about how your impressions of civil-military relations were being developed, the key positions that you held, maybe the turning points or the learning experiences that you had?\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is—You’re somebody who comes in with a wealth of military experience, but by the same token, somebody who’s dealing with the Pentagon and is dealing with Washington through the course of your career before this begin date. If we could get you to reflect a little bit about what you were learning and what the critical experiences were for you in the period leading up, that will serve as the backdrop before the main course. Does that make sense?\n\nCasey\n\nSure. I came in the Army in ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps], from Georgetown University, and I was in Washington in college at Georgetown from 1966 to 1970, which was a very turbulent time. While I didn’t serve in Vietnam, the images of what was going on during that time, and my own father’s service and death there, had a significant impact on me over time. I find that people tend to be affected more when something happens in their developmental years and it sticks with them. So I always had Vietnam kind of in the back of my mind, and going through the basic officer training we were prepared to go to Vietnam because that’s what we thought we were going to do. We were going to go to Vietnam. But they were winding down at that time and it wound down before my number came up. The first eight years of my career I spent in infantry battalions basically learning my trade, learning how to be a soldier and learning how to manage and lead small organizations.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you ever consider another career?\n\nCasey\n\nThe original plan was for me to stay in for two years and get out and go to law school. That was the plan. I had a two-year obligation coming out of Georgetown, and when we got to Fort Benning, Georgia, they were already downsizing. So they offered the basic officer class the option of staying on active duty 90 days for training. They called it ADT, Active Duty for Training. You were there 90 days and then you had an eight-year commitment in the Reserves. We had already kind of made our plans for two years, so I decided, well, I’m just going to stay there and finish this up. But the plan then was to get out and go to law school.\n\nIt’s interesting how things happened. I wanted to go to Airborne School and be a paratrooper like my father, but to do that I had to sign on for another year. It was a trap! And then, since I had now a three-year tour instead of a two-year tour, I was eligible to go to Germany and I said I’d like to do that. So we did that, and that got me off and running.\n\nThe first eight years or so of my career, I spent at the low levels of the Army, learning how to be a soldier and a leader. At the end of that eight years I found myself asking, “Is this all there is to the Army? Am I just going to be down here at this low level pushing these troops and being responsible for them?” I said, “There’s got to be more to it than that,” and I knew there was because I had watched my father’s career. As luck would have it, my detailer calls me and says, “Have you thought about fully funded graduate school?” I said, “No, as a matter of fact I haven’t.” He said, “Well, you’re eligible. Would you like to go?” I said, “You know, that would be a pretty good thing to do right now.”\n\nMy alternate specialty was foreign area officer, because my degree from Georgetown was international relations and I was always interested in that. So I was given the opportunity to go to graduate school. I was going to be a Northeast Asia foreign area officer. I was born in Japan. I found that the University of Denver, right up the street from where I was stationed in Colorado Springs, had just had a professor who had just come back from a sabbatical in Japan. He was a China expert, and I said that will work, and I went up to the University of Denver. I tell people that that was one of the two most broadening experiences that I ever had in my career. It got me to see that there’s a lot more to the Army and the military in support of political objectives, than just pushing troops and going out in the field and training. That was a real eye opener for me.\n\nAfter that, I was selected for a staff college and I went to the Armed Forces Staff College, which got me in with other services. One of the things that I’ve learned over my career is how insular we are in the Army. We’re so big, and just being successful in the Army is hard enough work. Most people in the Army didn’t look outside and weren’t able to figure how the Army integrates with all of the other services. This was my first real shot at understanding the joint world and understanding that the power of all the services working together is much more than the power of one service. So, relatively early on, less than a quarter of the way through a four-decade career, I’m already realizing that the Army, to be successful, needs leaders who can operate outside the Army.\n\nAfter that joint course, I was sent off to the Middle East, to Egypt for a year, to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. The Armed Forces Staff College got me to start considering and thinking about operating with other services. This was a UN [United Nations] mission. I’m in Cairo with observers from 16 other countries, including 18 Russian officers, in the middle of the Cold War. I would spend a week at a time on the Suez Canal, with just myself and three Russians, in the middle of the Cold War. During that time the tensions and the suspicions were really high. As an example, we took turns cooking. We would rotate the cooking duties. The first time I cooked, they wouldn’t take a bite of the meal until I took a bite of mine. Now, after some wine and vodka and cognac, everything was fine and we got on with it.\n\nSo there was the time with the UN, operating with other countries, and how you do that and how important that is. The time with the Russians was really special because we would sit around and just talk. There was really nothing much to do on this post on the Suez Canal except once or twice a week we would help the observers who were going out to the Sinai [Peninsula] get across the Suez Canal, and help the ones coming back get back across the Suez Canal. There was nothing else to do, so we would sit and talk. I realized that what we considered propaganda, they believed. They believed it. It wasn’t something that they thought was made up and they said it just to be saying it. They believed it. It was interesting.\n\nPerry\n\nCan you give some examples?\n\nCasey\n\nThey would say, “George, do you live in a house or an apartment?” I’d say, “We live in a house.” “How many families live in that house?” “Just us.” “Oh, come on.” They’d say, “Do you have a car?” “Yes, we have two cars.” “Do you have a television?” “We have three televisions.” “Black and white?” “No, they’re all color.” They just couldn’t comprehend it. So you know, as I went forward and I had to negotiate and deal with people in Bosnia and Kosovo and Iraq, I always tried to figure out, OK, where are they coming from?\n\nPerry\n\nWhat year were you in Egypt?\n\nCasey\n\nIt was ’81, ’82.\n\nPerry\n\nWere there discussions ongoing about Afghanistan? Their invasion would have just happened right before that, right?\n\nNelson\n\nIn 1979.\n\nCasey\n\nProbably. I don’t remember heated discussions about Afghanistan. We’d have heated discussions about the value of capitalism over communism, which inevitably ended with them saying to me, “Well, communism is better, but by the way when you go to Port Said, would you buy me …? Because I can’t get it in Russia.”\n\nI was also there at the parade with my family when [Anwar] Sadat was shot. We were just over a little a little rise, so we couldn’t see what was going on, and there were jets flying over and all kinds of noise. We knew the parade had stopped.\n\nPerry\n\nThat was fall of ’81.\n\nCasey\n\nYes. The timing was such that the people we were with had to catch a plane, so we started walking away after it stopped. But in the back of my mind (The parade wasn’t far from where we lived, and we’d seen them practicing.), I just kept saying to myself, I didn’t see the Katyusha rockets, because I had seen them practicing with those, driving by, and I didn’t see them, and something was just strange. As we’re walking back to the UN villa, all these limousines go by and there are people lying all over each other in the limousines. The Egyptians on the street don’t know what happened, so they’re waving and no one’s waving back, and we’re saying, “Well, that’s odd too.” Then we got back to the villa and we found out that Sadat had been shot. Again, another very broadening experience, but an experience outside the Army.\n\nI went back into the Army again and I did my field grade officer business, deputy battalion commander and some other jobs, and then I was selected to command a battalion, which is really the first big step for an officer. It was what I had wanted to do ever since I was a lieutenant and I thought it was the best job in the Army. I was selected for that and I was selected to do it at Fort Carson, Colorado, where I had been, so we stayed there.\n\nThat all went fine, and then I was selected to go to War College, out of battalion command, which is the next big step if you’re going to be upwardly mobile. But instead of going to the Army War College, I was sent to the Atlantic Council of the United States. At the time I was selected, I had no idea what it was. I thought it had something to do with the Law of the Sea but it turned out to be a NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] think tank and support group in Washington. That became the second most broadening experience of my career. I had avoided Washington up until that time, because that’s what hard infantry officers did. You didn’t want to be a Pentagon person. You wanted to be out there with the troops and leading the troops.\n\nWhat it enabled us to do—It really gave us access to all the other think tanks in Washington, to Congress, and really to anybody we wanted to talk to. We got to go around Washington and sit in on Congressional hearings, listening to people talk about anything under the sun. Right about that time, Hedrick Smith published a book called The Power Game: How Washington Works. I remember reading that at that time and I was seeing it in what I was doing, and that really prepared me. It was a great introduction to Washington. It kind of piqued my curiosity and interest into the role that Congress played. At the lower levels of the military, you have a pretty low view of what Congress does, particularly on the national security side, which is only confirmed, the higher up you get.\n\nAnyway, as the time came for me to leave that fellowship, we had decided we wanted to stay in Washington because we had had to move our boys in high school from Colorado to Washington, and we wanted them to finish in the Washington area. So I said, “OK, I’m just going to go to the Pentagon.”\n\nThis is kind of interesting: I called the Joint Staff J5—I ultimately was the J5—and I called the NATO director and I said, “Hey, I’m just finishing up this NATO fellowship, and I’d like to come work there.” Well, I was talking to a major on the phone, and his boss came in. He must have tried to cover the phone, but he said, “This is Colonel Casey on the phone and he wants to know if you want him to come over and work.” I hear his boss say, “No, he has no Pentagon experience. He doesn’t know how to work in the Pentagon. No.” I said OK.\n\nA buddy of mine was working in Army legislative affairs and as I said the fellowship had kind of piqued my interest on the Congress. I thought, Well, Congress is kind of interesting, so why don’t I go do that? I get him to get me an interview with the two-star who is the head of legislative affairs. He kind of looked at me like, what’s wrong with this guy? Because I’m a War College graduate and I’m upwardly mobile, and most everybody else there was on the last part of their careers because they were getting ready to go out and do something else. He’s looking at me like, what’s this all about? They actually created a job for me and I wound up working with the Congress on the Army’s operations and maintenance budget; that was my account. It was at that time a $26 billion account, which was so big nobody had any idea what was in it, and they just whacked a billion dollars a year off it.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd this is—?\n\nCasey\n\nThis is ’88, ’89. I came out of command in ’87, then spent a year in the fellowship.\n\nNelson\n\nCan I ask you a couple of things about the Army in this period from the ’70s, and now I guess we’re in the late ’80s? You were there when the Army became an all-volunteer force. What was that transition like?\n\nCasey\n\nIt was a very difficult transition. Those early days in Germany were bad. The draft was still going on. People would come on active duty, they’d go to basic training for six weeks, they’d get sent to Vietnam and then they’d get sent back to Germany with six months left on a two-year tour. They’d survived Vietnam and they brought back some of the problems that they had in Vietnam, like posttraumatic stress, which at the time we had no idea what we were looking at. We just thought these guys were disciplinary problems. It was not a good environment. There were race issues. There were drug issues. The time in Germany, my first platoon, when I first walked in, had nine or ten guys, and half of them were pending some type of discharge. That’s kind of how it was. The other thing that I saw was that we had neglected Europe for years while we were fighting in Vietnam, which is what happens during the course of a war. So it was a very difficult period.\n\nIt took us really through the ’70s to get the Army back on track. In my view, the formation of what we called the National Training Center was what got our heads back in the game. If you look at the history of the all-volunteer force, it wasn’t adequately funded in the beginning so we couldn’t pay the bonuses to get people with high school diplomas. We got “not bad” people in, but we didn’t get the best people in, which only created more disciplinary problems down the road.\n\nThat was going on, and then there was the post-Vietnam funk, kind of an institutional funk because we felt we’d done everything we could and we didn’t win, and that really stuck in our collective craws. Those kinds of things were going on. It takes the formation of the National Training Center in the late ’70s, early ’80s, to get people focused back on what’s important, which is our warfighting trade. And then at the same time, the [Ronald] Reagan buildup starts happening and we start getting the tools that we need to execute the doctrine that we had, which is AirLand Battle, and we start getting the Abrams tank and the Apache helicopter and the Patriot missile system, and all those kinds of things. All that happens in the ’70s and early ’80s, and by the end of the ’80s, we’re a fundamentally different force. We’re a force that really could deal with the Russians in Western Europe.\n\nBakich\n\nWas there a great deal of hesitance to the adoption of AirLand Battle with a transition from an all-volunteer force, or were these two things completely separate?\n\nCasey\n\nSeparated. The transition to the all-volunteer force had more to do with the personnel side of things. We say it takes ten years to ingrain doctrine in the force, so there wasn’t friction but there were questions.\n\nBakich\n\nSure.\n\nCasey\n\nI mean, the first doctrine that came out in ’76 had something called the “active defense,” which is basically fighting backward. We couldn’t quite figure that out. In fact, when I was a captain we did a skit and made fun of it at a division officer’s call. But that’s what happens. Coming out of Vietnam, we had to put something out there to change the focus of the Army. In fact, and I know this from my time as Chief of Staff, the memo that the Training and Doctrine Command commander, Bill DePuy, sent forward to the Army Chief of Staff said this doctrine is designed to “take the Army out of the rice paddies of Vietnam and put them firmly on the plains of Europe.” That’s what it was designed to do. That was ’76.\n\nIt was maybe ’82 before we got to AirLand Battle. The systems I talked about earlier are starting to get fielded. The National Training Center is set up and people are realizing how to use all that equipment, so it’s the whole decades of the ’70s and ’80s.\n\nNelson\n\nI wanted to ask you, too—You were ROTC, and at these early stages of your career or at any later stage in your career, did you notice any sort of difference between West Point-trained officers and ROTC officers? Were there tensions? Were there advantages? Come at that question however you want.\n\nCasey\n\nEarly on when you’re in the officer basic course, and the advanced course, there’s a strong bond between the West Point officers. They went to college together and they were all classmates, so they bond together and they stick together. What I found was, the really capable ones didn’t use their West Point connections. They were capable enough where they didn’t need to. The ones who were less capable, the middle-of-the-roaders, would get the class ring out there.\n\nNelson\n\nThe ring knockers.\n\nCasey\n\nThe ring knockers. That was in the early years. The middle years, not really, not so much. Then what happens is you see a relative preponderance of West Point officers in the senior general officer ranks.\n\nNelson\n\nAnd why is that the case?\n\nCasey\n\nOne, it is the preparation. And two, they get some very high quality officers who go to West Point. They benefit from the military education, sure they do, but they’re already the kind of people who are going to be successful anyway.\n\nRiley\n\nSo, we had you in Congressional relations.\n\nCasey\n\nCongressional relations, also a very broadening experience. I traveled with Members, I traveled with staff, I learned how the staff operates. Probably one of the greatest lessons I learned was, in taking Army leaders around to see Members of Congress to argue for Army things, I’d sit there and I’d listen to these generals, and they were talking inside-the-Pentagon-speak and it was clear that the Congressman didn’t have a clue what they were talking about. I’d have to kind of shape it. That was a great lesson for me.\n\nPerry\n\nSo they would speak in jargon terms, acronyms?\n\nCasey\n\nWe’re terrible with that, acronyms. You pull out these briefing slides that are good for briefing each other inside the Pentagon, but if you’re looking at this thing for the first time, you didn’t have a clue. There are satellites and lightning bolts and it’s just crazy.\n\nPerry\n\nSo you had to translate.\n\nCasey\n\nIt’s all about communications. I started learning this then, but whenever you go to a session with somebody like that, you’re going to have one or two things that you want to come out of the session with. Then you have to shape the presentation so that that’s what you get out of it. It really helped me understand communicating at the high levels. I was starting to get into that a little bit. I stayed there for about 18 months and then I got pulled up to the Chief of Staff of the Army’s office. He had a little support group. They called it the Chief’s Assessments and Initiatives Group, and it was about 15 or 20 lieutenant colonels and colonels who each had a specific area that helped the chief. This was outside of the regular staff, which stuck in the craw of the regular staff because we would give things straight to the chief without clearing it with anybody. That was a great eye opener for me, about operating at the highest levels of the Pentagon.\n\nOur boss was a colonel and he had been with the Chief, General [Carl E.] Vuono, for a long time. They were in sync mentally. One day I walked in with some talking points that I had prepared for the Chief and he said, “I don’t have time to look at them; just give them to him.” In the past, he would always check them out, so you knew you had a safety net. Now he’s saying, “OK, Colonel, give your stuff to the Chief of Staff of the Army.” I’m thinking, Boy, I hope this is right. It was good for me to see that interaction at the top of the order.\n\nBakich\n\nIt sounds like an early Red Team.\n\nNelson\n\nI was thinking the same thing.\n\nCasey\n\nIt wasn’t a Red Team. If you can think about the top ten disciplines that the Chief of Staff of the Army has to deal with, he had a representative in each of those areas. They helped decipher the things that the staff was trying to tell him, and they prepared notes for him so that he could quickly bring himself up to speed on the really important parts of the issue. So it wasn’t like a Red Team.\n\nI had the Congressional portfolio and I wrote his Congressional testimony, which was also very helpful, because you learn how to testify. You have your transcript for the record, where you put everything you want to say, and then you have no more than a five or six minute presentation that you need to write yourself. You need to get it down to say, “OK, these are the two or three things I want everyone to take away from this session,” and that becomes the communication.\n\nHere’s a funny one: I had written a testimony for him that talked a lot about what happened in Korea with Taskforce Smith, which was the first force that was sent into Korea after the North Koreans attacked South Korea. They were badly mauled because they weren’t ready. They didn’t have the right equipment; they didn’t have the right training; they weren’t fully manned. It was a mess. What we were trying to tell Congress was you can’t keep cutting our budget, because that’s what’s going to happen again.\n\nUnfortunately, it was about eight minutes and it had to be six minutes, and I knew that. I knew he wasn’t going to like that and I tried to cut it as much as I could but it was eight minutes. I called the chief of legislative liaison, the two-star, and I said, “Sir, the chief is going to ask you if his testimony is too long. Tell him no, it’s just right.” [laughter] Sure enough, he gave it back to me. I said, “Sir, I’ve worked this. This is going to be great.” So he goes in—and it was to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. He went in and gave his talk and the Members kept playing back the quotes from Taskforce Smith to him. And as he walked out, I was standing by the door and he looks at me and says, “Good speech.” For a speechwriter, that’s as good as it gets.\n\nPerry\n\nTouchdown.\n\nCasey\n\nBut it was a learning experience for me to be able to see how it played, to listen to how it worked. It really helped me a lot. Legislative liaison wasn’t where up-and-coming officers went.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nCasey\n\nThey stayed out in the field. This is a reflection now, looking back. I was able to build a solid enough base in the first probably 19 years of my career. It was important to work on the broadening things, so that I was able to do other things and deal with people outside of the military once I got to higher positions. I can’t tell you that I was thinking about that at the time, but I enjoyed that. I enjoyed the international relations. I enjoyed the politics. So it was something that fit into what I liked to do anyway.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right, so through the ’90s then?\n\nCasey\n\nI’m stuck working there for the Chief of Staff of the Army during Desert Storm. There’s just a long group of cubicles, and you could hear these guys calling up the personnel center, saying, “You’ve got to get me into the fight here. You’ve got to get me a job.” We all tried to get a job but the chief said, “You can’t all leave; some of you have to stay.” A couple of guys got out. So I tell people when they ask, “What did you in Desert Storm?” I say, “I shoveled “script” in the Pentagon.” [laughter]\n\nThen it was a very interesting time. This was a fork in the road. I had been promoted below the zone to major and lieutenant colonel, which is a crapshoot, but once it happens twice, you come to expect it. I didn’t get promoted to colonel below the zone twice, so I was saying to myself, What’s going on? Then I got promoted to colonel on time with everybody else, and then I missed the two-brigade command lists. So I’m saying to myself, things are kind of slowing down here a little bit. When the Chief of Staff left, this Chief’s Assessments and Initiatives Group stood down, and the new chief had his own group of folks that he wanted to bring in. As I said, the staff didn’t like it because they felt it undercut their work. The new chief disbanded it and set up his own smaller group.\n\nI was kind of in between. I had a guy who had offered me a job in OSD, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, in conventional forces and arms control. It was a colonel’s position. I was promoted to colonel in May of ’91, I think, and I was waiting in the Pentagon for this one job to finish and the other one to start, and I got a call from the commanding general in the 1st Calvary Division saying, “Would you like to be the chief of staff of the division?” It was the division my dad had commanded in Vietnam and division chief of staff is a wonderful job, so I said sure, and I went down and interviewed with him.\n\nSo I’ve got this maybe two-month period where, if I get the chief of staff’s job, then my career continues. If I have to take the conventional forces and arms control job, I’m done. Back-to-back Pentagon assignments for a colonel is finished. As it turns out, I get the chief of staff’s job, go down there in August, stay in the chief of staff’s job for about two and a half years, come out on the brigade command list, command a brigade in the 1st Cav, and then go to Europe to be the operations officer for the V Corps, the only corps that was left in Europe, and then I’m selected for brigadier general.\n\nNelson\n\nAt the time of the First Gulf War, the Army has, if anything, overlearned the lesson that we should be preparing and fighting in a Europe-style campaign, rather than a Vietnam-style campaign. Is that a fair statement?\n\nCasey\n\nIt is. You hear a lot of criticism and cynicism about how the Army “turned its back” on counterinsurgency after Vietnam, but the reality was, we were far behind the Warsaw Pact. It’s what I saw in Germany in the early ’70s. We were doing our alerts and we were running out to the field, but we didn’t really have the capabilities. We had these M113s, which are armored personnel carriers, but they had a 50-caliber machinegun on top that you had to aim yourself. Our tanks were old and I don’t think we could have stopped them (in Warsaw Pact) in the ’70s.\n\nSo it was a major shift and it’s one that I think we did very well, and it paid great dividends. It became one of the deterrents that ended the Cold War and it was greatly responsible for our success in Desert Shield and Desert Storm. I think the bane of the military’s existence is not necessarily that you’re going to prepare for the last war, but you’ll never be fully prepared for the next one, because it will always be different. That’s one of the things that led me, when I came back from Iraq and we wrote the first doctrinal update for the Army since September 11th, to focus the Army on what we called full spectrum operations: offense, defense, and stability operations that were performed in different ways, depending on the environment that you found yourself in. No matter where we went, we were going to do those three things.\n\nThat became a way to codify the transition from conventional war to the counterinsurgency, which I think is probably one of the untold stories of the period from September 11th to now. I lived through it in Iraq but I didn’t fully appreciate it until I got back to be Chief of Staff of the Army, when I saw how little the institution had adapted. For example, the educational system—There were little things about counterinsurgency in our schools, but they were basically teaching you how to fight a conventional war in the officer basic course and the advanced course, and at Fort Leavenworth. And this was six years after 9/11 [September 11, 2001] and we still hadn’t made that adaptation.\n\nThe family services hadn’t adapted, the logistical systems hadn’t adapted—We were continuing to field new systems, and we were trying to get them to the unit in time to train with them before they took them to combat, but we were getting them there right before they were getting on the boat.\n\nBakich\n\nDo you think that the focus on full spectrum capabilities, full spectrum dominance, was within the Army or within the Armed Forces push, or do you see that more as coming from the Office of the Secretary of Defense?\n\nCasey\n\nThat was within the Army, but one of the challenges we had was that full spectrum operations meant something different to the Army than it did to other people. For most people outside the Army, it meant the high end. It meant conventional war where you overwhelm. For us it meant dominance across the spectrum of conflict, from the peacekeeping operations to a conventional war.\n\nNelson\n\nIf you went to West Point or the War College now, would you find the same kind of teaching going on?\n\nCasey\n\nNo, I hope not. We started moving the institutions. While I was the chief, we worked on setting up the National Training Center so it wasn’t just a conventional fight; it was a full spectrum fight. You know, the doctrine and the training will pull the institution forward. Just like when I was growing up and the National Training Center caused me to focus on being successful fighting a conventional war, what I tried to do was set it up so that the National Training Center caused the next generation of leaders to focus on the full spectrum of warfare.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me see if we can conclude the prelude. About your experience in the Balkans, which I would guess must be important—We could listen for five hours about this. It’s fascinating material.\n\nCasey\n\nThe V Corps operations officer, the G3 there is a colonel. I get there in March, and over that Memorial Day weekend we are told to put together an aviation and infantry taskforce to be prepared to extract the UN observers out of the eastern enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde, and Srebrenica. So we put it together, and we put them through a training regimen. I had to organize all this and put it together. That’s where we really, as an Army, started with situational training, where we tried to create an environment that was Bosnia-like, to include replicas of the bases and towns. We caused everybody to prepare to go and operate in an environment as close to what they were going to operate in as we could imagine.\n\nThen I got a good view about what happens when the political issues overwhelm the military issues. For us to have any chance of being effectively deployed, we had to go to Italy because we couldn’t make the deployment times from Germany, but the Italian government wouldn’t let us in. I still remember sitting there in the training area in Germany, listening to the reports of Srebrenica.\n\nBakich\n\nRight.\n\nCasey\n\nAnd the Dutch peacekeepers running away. It was gut wrenching. We were ready and we could have done something. Then I was involved in deploying the 1st Armored Division into Bosnia. I had worked with Wes Clark (the U.S. J5 [Director of Strategic Plans and Policy, Joint Chiefs of Staff]) before. He had a colonel calling me straight from Dayton, telling me the changes to the Peace Accords. What we were concerned about was how to implement the Dayton Peace Accords, and we were updating the training to prepare the 1st Armored Division to go into Bosnia in the peacekeeping mission. So I’m learning the interaction between the strategic and the operational levels of war—here’s the treaty we’re negotiating and now you’ve got to translate it into a military mission that these soldiers can execute. That was a great learning experience.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nCasey\n\nWe deployed the 1st Armored Division over Christmas. It was another example of how we let our conventional mindset override us. Wes Clark calls the crossing of the Sava River the greatest unnecessary river crossing in the history of warfare. We told ourselves we didn’t know how the Serbs were going to react, and so we wanted to be ready if it was an opposed river crossing. It was crazy. Anyway, the bottom line is we got in there. We got the entities separated; they did a very nice job.\n\nAt that time, I moved up. I got promoted in April of ’96 to brigadier, and I was made Chief of Staff of the Corps. And then that summer or that spring, right after I got promoted, I was sent down to Hungary, basically to prepare the base in Tata, Hungary. Everybody coming from Germany went through Hungary to get into Bosnia. Tata was an intermediate staging base. My mission was to set that base up for the relief in place of the 1st Armored Division by the 1st Infantry Division in December. We were going to have a division of about 16,000 people come into Bosnia with all their equipment, and another one come out. It was a huge logistical challenge. I worked on that and set that up through July, and then in July, I actually went into Bosnia to become the assistant division commander of the 1st Armored Division. I did that for about nine months and learned a heck of a lot there. I like to say I learned more about intelligence in the first week I was in Bosnia than I did in the previous 25 years, or whatever it was, that I had been in the military.\n\nNelson\n\nFor example?\n\nCasey\n\nYou’re operating against a real competitive foe. You can try to make your training exercises as good as you can, but you’re really having to think about your opponent. The level of thought that it takes trying to analyze a complex intelligence situation and weigh the different variables is mind boggling. What happens is, as a leader, you’re constantly getting feeds from all different sources and you’re constantly interpreting those feeds and fitting them into your beliefs, and then you’re challenging your beliefs and trying to figure it out. The mental process is staggering.\n\nBakich\n\nCan I ask you a very quick question on this? You’ve got multiple sources of information that they’re throwing at you, and a dynamic picture is evolving. At any point, as you’re going through this process, did you start to think about different ways of creating support mechanisms? Are you bringing in any people to help you interpret the information? Are you actually having to get rid of people because it’s a too cumbersome process?\n\nCasey\n\nWhat I got in the habit of doing was spending time with intel analysts on a periodic basis. I’m the assistant division commander; I don’t have a staff. I work through the division staff. So what I would do is once a week, I would sit down with the intel analysts. I told the G2, “You don’t need to be there. I just want to sit down and talk to your folks,” and I bounced things off them. I just asked questions. Every morning you get an intel book and you read the book, and you always have questions about sourcing. How comfortable are we that this source is a valid source and he’s not playing us? But you don’t get to ask those. You have to send them an email or walk over and ask somebody. Sometimes it’s important enough to ask a question right away; other times you just kind of file it in the back of your mind. Once a week I would sit down—and I did the same thing in Iraq. Once a week I sat down with the intel analysts and bounced things off them. I tried to set up different forums periodically that allowed me to address the different aspects of the mission. I did it in Bosnia, in Kosovo, in Iraq, and as Chief of Staff of the Army.\n\nBakich\n\nOK, thank you.\n\nNelson\n\nI had another big question, this one tied to the ’90s. This is a decade when there’s a President whose military is not necessarily inclined to respect, and there’s a lot of studies coming out, based on surveys of serving officers, that the officer corps is overwhelmingly Republican and resistant to civilian control if asked to do things that are unsound in their view. Did you see any of this and did it have any effect on the Army as you experienced it, through the ’90s?\n\nCasey\n\nThere was clearly friction when [William J.] Clinton came in. There was the story going around that he dissed Barry McCaffrey in the White House. There was an impression that the President didn’t value the service of the men and women of the Armed Forces. I don’t know that that was true but that was the impression.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you know him at Georgetown?\n\nCasey\n\nNo. I might have met him, but we traveled in different circles. That said, there was a lot of grousing. But resistant to civilian control? Never. I say in my class that civilian control is a given with the military. There was never any discussion, “Let’s get rid of this guy,” or anything. I mean, never.\n\nPerry\n\nNo Seven Days in May scenarios?\n\nCasey\n\nNot even remotely, but grousing, sure. I remember I went with President Clinton when he made a speech in Bosnia. He gave a wonderful speech in Sarajevo—it was in a theater downtown—about democracy and the importance of working together and bringing all the ethnic sectarian groups together. It was a wonderful speech. But he clearly had perception problems with the military. Now President [Barack] Obama, in my mind, saw that, and when he came in he worked very hard to create exactly the opposite impression by meeting shortly after he got there with the chiefs, meeting with the sergeants major and the senior chief petty officers of the military, and Mrs. [Michelle] Obama meeting with their spouses. That sent a really significant signal. The sergeant major of the Army told me he looked to his files and the last time he had a record of the sergeant major of the Army being in the Oval Office was during the [Lyndon] Johnson administration.\n\nNelson\n\nSo what I’m hearing you saying is that it doesn’t matter what the officers think, what their political opinions are in terms of how they conduct themselves professionally.\n\nCasey\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nRiley\n\nIs there anything more you want to say about Bosnia?\n\nCasey\n\nBosnia is important because it influences my thinking about Iraq, especially on the American military operating in other countries. This is a long story but I’ll make it short: In Bosnia there was a group of Bosniaks who had reoccupied their village. It was called Jušići, I never thought I’d forget the name of that. It was on the Serb side of the Inter-Entity Boundary Line. The Serbs said that they came in with arms, they had violated the Dayton Accords; they had to leave.\n\nSo for six weeks I worked with the Serbs, I worked with the Bosniaks, I worked with the Serb police, to get these people to be allowed to stay, because it would have been the first time that Bosniaks had been able to return to the Serb side of the Inter-Entity Boundary Line, which was something that we were trying to have happen across the country. At the end of that six-week period, I had it to where the Serbs said, “OK, we’re going to come in tomorrow morning at ten o’clock, we’re going to search the village, and if we don’t find any weapons, they can stay.” So I get everybody together and say, “OK, they’re coming tomorrow at ten o’clock. Do you understand that?” “Yes, General.” I said, “Get all the weapons out of town if you want to stay here. We’ve been working at this for six weeks. You almost have your goal. Make sure there are no weapons here, you got that?” “Yes, General.”\n\nSo the Serbs come in, and they’re searching, and we’re five minutes from closing the deal, and the deputy mayor says, “Come into my house and let’s have some tea.” We go in there with the Serb chief of police from down the road and the Serb Minister of Interior. This is like having Darth Vader inside a Bosniak house, but they’re in there. We’re sitting there drinking our tea, and a Serb policeman walks out of the next room with a rifle, a bag of bullets, and a bag of grenades. I look at the deputy mayor and I’m just—I’m completely flabbergasted. I had told the Serbs that if they found any weapons, they could arrest the people who had them. So they’re arresting the deputy mayor, and we’re trying to walk down the stairs to get out of the house and the village women have come out and now they’re lying on the ground at the bottom of the stairs so you have to step on them to get out. Holy mackerel. I finally negotiate that if they get up, I will bring the guy down to the Serbs in the morning, and the Serbs agreed to leave. It was getting dark. It was a terrible situation.\n\nAnyway, I get back to my boss and I’m obviously crestfallen. I come in the door, he’s sitting there and he looks at me and all he says is, “George, never forget that it’s their country.” I never forgot that. And going into Iraq, that meant—\n\nNelson\n\nWhat did you take that to mean?\n\nCasey\n\nThat we can’t want it more than they did. I wanted that to happen more than they wanted it to happen. If they wanted it to happen it would have happened. They didn’t. And there were forces at play that I didn’t fully appreciate or understand. That was one thing I took into Iraq with me. We can’t want it more than they do.\n\nThe other thing I took into Iraq was I tried to do too much to bring these guys together, and I saw it in others. The men and women of the American military, when you put them on the ground in a deployed environment, they’re going to work 24/7 to get the job done. Well, we were in Bosnia nine years because we never let the Bosniaks and the Serbs do anything, or do very little. We did it all for them, and they used us and they pitted us against each other. So I had that in my mind too as I went into Iraq, and that influenced me significantly.\n\nRiley\n\nTerrific.\n\nCasey\n\nBecause very few people in the military had Bosnian experience, Balkan experience then, I got picked up to be a brigadier in the Joint Staff, J5. This dragged me into the political-military sphere, something that I hadn’t really been involved in before. And it’s the policy sphere. Basically, the European and Africa desk is what it was called. I had all the NATO stuff and then I had all the Balkan stuff.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd this begins in ’99?\n\nCasey\n\nThis is ’97. I do a lot of work in the Balkans, meet with [Slobodan] Milošević several times, work with Dick Holbrooke, get to see how he operated. Then as Kosovo starts up it’s on my watch and my boss has back surgery. The three-star has back surgery. He’s out, and we’re getting ready to go to war in Kosovo and I’m the brigadier and I’m the one sitting behind the chairman and the vice chairman in NSC [National Security Council] meetings. I’m watching the country go to war under the Clinton administration. It’s a fascinating process. We make the decision to go to war. We have the NATO 50th anniversary summit that’s going on right after that. We get into a big discussion about ground forces or not, as one of our options.\n\nBakich\n\nForgive me, who’s “we” at this point?\n\nCasey\n\nWe’re talking within the Joint Staff.\n\nNelson\n\nAbout whether to ask other NATO countries for ground troops?\n\nCasey\n\nWe were debating. Wes Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, comes in and he wants to put a ground option on the table. He was already planning a ground option. Actually, as a brigadier, I made the recommendation to the chairman that we ought to take the ground option off the table, to get Russian support for the peacekeeping operation. It was one of those things that was a great learning experience for me—that you never take anything off the table. I made the wrong recommendation to the chairman on that. As it turned out, interestingly enough, Milošević didn’t believe us. He believed we still had the ground option on the table.\n\nAnyway, we went to war. I got involved in the team with Strobe Talbott to negotiate the end of the Kosovo War. It was Talbott, [Viktor] Chernomyrdin for the Russians, and Martti Ahtisaari, the President of Finland. They would sit in a room like this and there would be four chairs. There would be Talbott, Chernomyrdin, Ahtisaari, and there would be an empty chair that was Milošević. The deal was, when Chernomyrdin and the Russians agreed with the terms, Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin would fly to Belgrade and say, “OK, Slobodan, this is it,” which is what ultimately happened. I then wound up negotiating the Russian participation in the war with the Russian military, and I got some great experience in dealing with the Russians.\n\nWe finished, and I’m in Helsinki having a meeting, the final meeting between the Ministers of Defense of Russia and the United States, to sign the final agreement for the Russian participation. And who’s the interpreter for the Russian Minister of Defense? My boss from Cairo. [laughter] So we had a little side meeting and obviously caught up about what was going on with our families.\n\nNelson\n\nDid he believe you this time when you said you had your own house?\n\nCasey\n\nThat was a very seminal experience. I spent time sleeping on my couch in the office, because Dick Holbrooke would walk out of negotiations with Milošević at one o’clock in the morning Serb time and he’d be going back at nine o’clock that night and he’d have four issues that we needed to work on the interagency, so they would call me and I’d work the issues in D.C. So I got a real good view of how the country went to war and how the interagency process worked, going through these things. I got a real good sense of that.\n\nI left Finland—I actually left early. I left my job in the Joint Staff to go command a division in Germany, which ultimately wound up implementing the Kosovo agreement that I had negotiated. Having had the experience from Dayton, and translating that into operational details that military people could execute, it went off fairly well. But I was not in an operational role in Kosovo. I prepared a brigade that was basically about half my division, to go and do the mission, and I supported them from the rear.\n\nI finished that and then after two years, in which I was in and out of Kosovo a lot, I came home to the Joint Warfighting Center. Now this was interesting: When you command a division—There are only ten in the Army—the assumption is you’re going to go on to a third star. The assumption is you’re going right to a three-star billet out of that job. The Chief of Staff of the Army came over and told me I wasn’t going to a three-star billet out of that job, and I was crushed. He said it’s all timing, and I thought, Yes, that’s what you tell everybody, until I became the Chief of Staff and I saw how difficult the timing really is.\n\nSo I went down to the Joint Warfighting Center in Norfolk. I got there in July of 2001 and was just getting kind of settled when September 11th happened, and that changed everything. I was given the mission by my boss to stand up a homeland security organization, because Joint Forces Command had all of the forces in the United States assigned to it. So we had the resources to do it. He called me and said, “George, there’s no homeland security organization in the country right now, so you need to stand something up.” We basically pulled all of the military together to execute the homeland security mission. And the whole time we’re doing this we know there’s another shoe going to drop. When I think back about the daily anxiety—We are working as many hours a day as we can because we know that something else is going to happen, and we were appalled by how little we knew about terrorists and what was going on.\n\nWe get it done. We put a campaign plan together. The big thing we did was we brought in the Pacific Command commander who had the West Coast, the Southern Command commander, the European Command commander—All of these combatant commanders had homeland security responsibilities that they weren’t focused on. We had to tell them, “Hey, look, you need to be looking this way as well as that way.” I did that for six weeks and right as I finished that, I got picked to be the J5. That’s probably not a bad place to stop, because that’s the post-September 11th stuff.\n\nNelson\n\nJust this: At this stage of your career, was there anybody else at that stage, the same stage, who was as thoroughly, broadly experienced as you were, to lead the nation in war?\n\nCasey\n\nProbably [John] Abizaid is the only other guy I’d say at that point. [Stanley A.] McChrystal was coming along on the Special Operations side. [David] Petraeus was also starting to come along. What was he doing when the war started? Oh, he was the commander of the 101st Airborne Division. He hadn’t really moved into three-star billets yet that would prepare him to do things, but he was clearly somebody coming along.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right, let’s let you have a chance to catch your breath.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nRiley\n\nBarbara, did you want to start?\n\nPerry\n\nAfter 9/11, you mentioned the anxiety over the other shoe to drop. What did you think that other shoe would be? Did you have a sense of what that shoe to drop would be?\n\nCasey\n\nWe just thought there was going to be another significant attack of some sort.\n\nPerry\n\nAnd what kinds of attacks were you then preparing for?\n\nCasey\n\nWe weren’t really preparing for any particular kind of attack, but we were war-gaming about how, if you were a terrorist group, how would you attack us? We were just killing ourselves with all these vulnerabilities—the containers on the ships—all the different ways that they might come at us. Planes, we were less concerned about the airplanes, although the possibility still existed. We were definitely concerned about some type of chemical weapon employed, either in a U.S. city or brought in, in a container, on a boat. I’m rusty on this because I haven’t really thought about this in a long time. I just remember that we were war-gaming and scaring ourselves to death by how ill-prepared we were to do it.\n\nPerry\n\nAnd what was your sense about why we had missed the 9/11 possibility?\n\nCasey\n\nIt’s still the same. It’s what the [Albert and Roberta] Wohlstetters said about Pearl Harbor; it wasn’t so much an intelligence failure as it was a failure of imagination. We just couldn’t imagine some guys coming out of caves, being able to inflict that much damage on the United States. That’s really what it was. As a country, we weren’t focused on terrorism at the national level, because we didn’t see it as a threat that could inflict catastrophic damage on the United States.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nCasey\n\nThat’s what, to me, September 11th did. It introduced into the international equation, nonstate actors who have access to the instruments of catastrophic destruction. That’s a fundamentally different environment than I grew up in for the first 30 years of my career, trying to work with.\n\nBakich\n\nAt this time, we have the military that’s essentially doing homeland defense. I’m curious, were there any discussions—\n\nCasey\n\nWell, I wouldn’t say we were—We were rudimentarily trying to execute homeland security. We weren’t much safer by the time we finished our plan than we were before the plan was written, and we didn’t get into the intelligence side of it at all.\n\nBakich\n\nThat may answer my subsequent questions then. What’s the nature of the guidance that you’re getting from official Washington?\n\nCasey\n\nNone that I saw. My boss took this on himself.\n\nNelson\n\nAnd did your war-gaming result in any recommendations to anybody? Was there a constituency for what you were doing?\n\nCasey\n\nNo, there really wasn’t. What we did was organize the military as best we could, to fill the voids as we saw them. It was a military thing. In fact, there was a brigadier in J5 who received, after September 11th, the homeland security portfolio and he didn’t know any more about it than we did. But that’s what happens. The whole country was and still is transitioning to coming to grips with a fundamentally different threat than we had grown used to working with, and grown “comfortable” with over the past 50 years.\n\nNelson\n\nBacking up just a little bit, you’ve got a new Secretary of Defense who has some pretty strong ideas about how the military ought to be organized. How did his talk about the revolution in military affairs look from your vantage point?\n\nCasey\n\nIt didn’t really impact on the post–September 11th environment. It was an inside-the-Beltway thing, more than anything else. Other than the intellectual chatter at the war colleges and things, it really hadn’t had a significant impact on the military, because the way you impact the military is you change the program (budget). You move money from one system to another. The SecDef was embarked on—and I think he knew this—He was embarked on a long-term proposition.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me ask the question more generally, about the influence of a new administration and a new Secretary of Defense, sort of through the organization. Does it—You’re shaking your head. It doesn’t register at all?\n\nCasey\n\nNo. It takes so long for a new administration to have an impact. It just does. When you think about it—The President comes in in January, he presents his first budget in February, and it was the budget that was prepared by the previous administration, so they always say, “Give us a couple more months here.” So that budget goes in. Now that’s for the fiscal year that starts that September, so it’s pretty much all done. You know, it’s the battleship—You don’t make sharp turns with a battleship.\n\nBakich\n\nWas there a QDR [Quadrennial Defense Review] before September 11th?\n\nCasey\n\nI don’t remember. Yes, there was, because I got there after September 11th. I got there in the end of October of 2001 and people still had the scars from the QDR. This is opinion, but that’s where Secretary [Donald] Rumsfeld and the people he brought with him during that QDR process were perceived by the military as holding them in great disdain. They never really recovered from that. I don’t think it was his intent, but the way they acted toward the military—\n\nNelson\n\nWho didn’t recover?\n\nCasey\n\nThe Rumsfeld team.\n\nBakich\n\nHe gives that town hall meeting at the Pentagon, where he basically says the greatest threat to national security is the Pentagon bureaucracy.\n\nCasey\n\nWell, he wasn’t going to change it overnight. It was the way that he and the people he brought with him interacted with the senior generals. It turned them off. Actually, I never had that problem with him, but I’ve talked to guys, very senior folks, three-stars, who just couldn’t be in the same room with him, and it was because of what happened in those early days before I got to the Pentagon.\n\nRiley\n\nRight. Any particular offenders in the senior group?\n\nCasey\n\nWell, I think Steve [Stephen] Cambone was the point man on this thing and so it was his charge to go in and stir things up, and he did, and he generated a lot of animosity. I worked fine with him. The military is not blameless in this. If you’ve worked in the Pentagon, people are very protective of their budgets and their programs.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is true in universities too.\n\nCasey\n\nI suspect it is.\n\nPerry\n\nI’m sure you’re shocked to know that.\n\nCasey\n\nThey’re not open-minded about it. “This is in my program, it’s in my budget, I fought the fight within my organization and this is the right thing, and I’m committed to it. Now, what do you want to talk about?” [laughter]\n\nPerry\n\nYou spoke very candidly about the military’s view of President Clinton, and you spoke candidly about the view of President Bush 43’s Defense Department leadership. Are you getting, at this point, a sense of how the military feels about Bush 43?\n\nCasey\n\nNot really. I’ll say first, I’m getting all the QDR feedback secondhand, because I wasn’t there. I’m in Germany or I’m down in Norfolk. I’m getting this from General John Abizaid, who is now the J5. So I didn’t see that stuff and frankly, by the time I got there, I think the Rumsfeld crowd was sensitive to how they were being perceived and they had adopted a little softer touch. But it was all inside the Pentagon. I didn’t have any reason to interact directly with the President at that point. I got to the Pentagon in October of 2001.\n\nPerry\n\nNo pun intended, but any general views of the fact that there is this constant anxiety after 9/11, about the next shoe to drop, and the person who is the new Commander in Chief?\n\nCasey\n\nThe military reacted like most people in the country did. They saw him taking a very forceful leadership role in the aftermath of September 11th, and that’s a good thing.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me try a slightly different angle on this and ask, institutionally, the view toward the intelligence community—Is there tension between the Defense Department and the external intelligence communities? If so, was there any heightened concern about the intelligence communities in the aftermath of 9/11?\n\nCasey\n\nI don’t remember any direct finger-pointing going on between the Department of Defense and the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], saying you guys should have had this and this and this. I don’t remember, but my early portfolio—I will tell you that when I got there my charge was to work on and build a national military strategic plan for the War on Terror—we were looking beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. We were trying to write—I forget the national security planning directive that was laid out for the Cold War in the early fifties, but we were trying to write something like that because we thought this was going to be long-term.\n\nBakich\n\nNSC-68?\n\nNelson\n\nThat’s what I was thinking.\n\nCasey\n\nCould be. Yes, I think that’s probably right, NSC-68. We were doing that. So my interaction with the intelligence folks is, you know, what else is out there? It was forward; it wasn’t back.\n\nRiley\n\nIt strikes me that there are three big things on the agenda right now: You’ve got a kinetic war that’s about to occur or is occurring in Afghanistan; planning and eventually a kinetic war in Iraq; and then your main charge that you’ve already identified is creating a new strategy for a new world. Maybe the thing to do is to ask about Afghanistan first. Is any of that coming across your desk? Do you have a piece of the Afghanistan—\n\nCasey\n\nBy the time I got there, we were already in Afghanistan and it was in operation. That was already done.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s down the road, elsewhere.\n\nCasey\n\nI’m trying to figure out my role in the Afghan stuff. Who’s developing plans for the building of the Afghan army and the police? I’ve got three Navy captains who are submariners. That’s my Afghan shop.\n\nRiley\n\nThey’re experts in the Afghan navy, right?\n\nCasey\n\nYes. That’s the way it worked.\n\nNelson\n\nYou said you needed to be prepared for the unexpected.\n\nRiley\n\nThat would do it.\n\nCasey\n\nAfghanistan was primarily the J3 and CENTCOM. It was Central Command’s fight and they were working that.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right.\n\nCasey\n\nAs I said, I was focused on the strategic military plan. We were looking at places like Somalia, Yemen. We’re trying to get a sense of, OK, how could this morph and spread? We’re looking at Indonesia. We looked at the Philippines. Again, candidly, we’re building our knowledge and understanding about the global terrorist threat in the Pentagon.\n\nRiley\n\nAre you doing this generally on your own as an exercise because you’ve been charged to do it by your immediate superior? Is there Rumsfeld oversight and input into this or are they too busy?\n\nCasey\n\nNo. It’s primarily a military deal. I would brief Rumsfeld on aspects of it but it was always, where could the next threat come from? Is it Somalia? Is it Yemen? Is it the Philippines? Is it Indonesia? Looking back, our understanding was rudimentary.\n\nBakich\n\nAre you getting most of your intelligence, your information, strictly from DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] or are you going out to other elements of the intelligence community?\n\nCasey\n\nWe’re using all the elements of the intelligence communities. The chairman has a CIA rep. His office is right down the hall from me. There’s a DIA rep. All those guys were always present. You’re always drawing on everything.\n\nBakich\n\nPre-9/11 as well?\n\nCasey\n\nYes. But whether you were getting everything is a different story.\n\nRiley\n\nCould you tell us how you stand up this effort? What are the obstacles you’re confronting? We don’t have, from the outside, a picture of what’s emerging. Because this is perhaps the single most important issue confronting the American government at that time, it would be helpful for us to have a better understanding of how you’re doing your job and what it is that you’re learning as you’re doing it.\n\nCasey\n\nWe’re at the end of 2001, and this process starts, and there’s a time where the chairman gets the whole Joint Staff, all the leadership together in a room, and we start thinking our way through this whole plan. It wasn’t just me. I had the pen, but we were bringing everybody together here. Again, we’re all building our level of knowledge and understanding about something that was relatively unknown to us at the time.\n\nWe had some broad parameters that said, look, you’ve got terrorist organizations and you have state sponsors of terror. There were a few other ones that have now escaped me. At least from a military perspective we told ourselves we were going to have to deal with state sponsors of terror. Hopefully, they can drop their state sponsorship of terror through diplomatic pressures and initiatives and we don’t have to attack them, but we need to be prepared to do that if we should.\n\nI’m moving along on this. I remember telling my boss, John Abizaid, who was the director of the Joint Staff then—Probably in the beginning of 2002, when I started hearing this Iraq chatter. I’m hearing that [Douglas J.] Feith and [Paul] Wolfowitz are all fired up about Iraq and the vice chairman, Pete Pace, is going up and having secret meetings with Dick Cheney at his house. You know, “the fix is in.” I remember telling him, “Look. I’m not paying any attention to this Iraq stuff right now. I’m focused on the broader war plan here. You need to tell me when I need to start paying attention to Iraq.” He says, “Right.”\n\nIt was probably the end of July or the first part of August and we were walking in the hall and he stops me and looks at me and says, “All right, it’s time to start paying attention on Iraq.” Now, I didn’t know this at the time, but having taught my class on civil-military operations in war—and use Bush’s book, Rumsfeld’s book, [Tommy] Franks’s book, [Richard B.] Myers’s book, Bob Woodward’s book—I was only getting snippets of what was really going on. What the President says is that he wanted to make sure that he had a viable war plan to back up his diplomacy if diplomacy failed, which was perceived by other people as, they’ve already decided to go in and do this. I don’t necessarily believe that was the case.\n\nMy own conclusion from my class is that in a post-9/11 environment—and you have to put yourself back in that post-9/11 environment, with the anthrax scare on top of 9/11. (That was real to me because I had a meeting in Senator [Joseph] Lieberman’s office and he was one of the offices that had the letters mailed to him. When I got there, there was yellow tape across the door and I didn’t know what was going on. I looked down there and the staffer was waving at me from the bottom. I went down, and he talked about the anthrax. I told my wife and she burst into tears. I was on Cipro for about two weeks because of the anthrax stuff. So that was completely real in people’s minds.) But I came to the conclusion in my own mind that we went to war in Iraq because President Bush felt that, in the post-9/11 environment, Saddam Hussein with chemical weapons was too great a threat to the United States. That was my own conclusion after the research.\n\nRiley\n\nWas Iraq turning up in your own strategic researches at the time, as being a particularly problematic place?\n\nCasey\n\nThe Iraqis had been shooting at us and we’d been dropping bombs on them since we put the no-fly zones in after the Gulf War. So for probably 15 years, we’d been shooting at each other. The other thing was, the UN went in and inventoried and said, “They have X (chemical weapons).” They came back and said, “We destroyed Y.” There was this huge delta and nobody could explain what happened to the delta.\n\nI questioned the timing of doing a state sponsor right away when we were still dealing with Afghanistan. I do remember we did some military analysis as part of our plan. We had Syria, Iraq, and Iran, right in a row there, as state sponsors of terror. We knew that that was the heart of terrorism in the Middle East and we were going to have to do something about them. An analysis from a military perspective is: OK, which of those would be the easiest to do from a military perspective? Well, interestingly, the answer came back Iraq: one, because we had war plans already there; two, because you had the access from Kuwait. We dutifully reported our analysis up.\n\nBut it wasn’t clear to me at all why there was so much pressure to move on Iraq as early in this War on Terror as we were. That was the part that was unclear to me. Did I believe Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction? Yes. I read the intel and I believed it. It was really chemical weapons I was concerned about. Did I believe that his having chemical weapons that he could give to a terrorist, or he could look the other way while a terrorist took them—Did I believe that was a real threat? I sure did, but I didn’t necessarily see it as an imminent threat that had to be dealt with.\n\nPerry\n\nDid you also consider if we did go in and take out Saddam, what that would do to the balance of power in that area, in that region of the world?\n\nCasey\n\nWe did. The J5 is called the Director of Strategic Plans and Policy, but the way it’s organized on the Joint Staff is the War Plan division is in the J7, and the J5 is organized regionally. J5 does have a director of strategy but the director of strategy directs programmatic strategy, not grand national strategy. I had a bunch of regional experts trying to develop a national military strategy for the War on Terror, which wasn’t working, so I had to stand up a War on Terror branch that I staffed with the strategists, and they helped me get planning going.\n\nBakich\n\nI have a couple of questions. As you’re hearing the Iraq chatter—\n\nCasey\n\nI’ve got to come back to your question on the plans here. Go ahead.\n\nBakich\n\nJuly 2002, I believe, we get the establishment of the Interagency Iraq Political-Military Cell. What was that stood up in response to? I read that it was in response to some war-gaming that your office had done.\n\nCasey\n\nNo. Really it was done in direct response to Abizaid saying, “OK, you need to pay attention.” The way it’s organized now is you’ve got Tommy Franks, the Central Command commander. He has got the war planning, so all the war planning is being done in Central Command, and because of the way it’s organized, what the J5 winds up doing is being the political-military interface with the other departments of the government. So, since Franks had the war plan, we were trying to fill the void and the void was political-military interface, particularly with the State Department. We basically put a cell together and we started doing our homework on Iraq, and asking the questions about what’s going to happen when this is over. My Bosnian and Kosovo experience played heavy on this, and basically I was able to direct the planning effort because I had some sense of what it was going to be like once Saddam was gone.\n\nIt took us some months. In fact, I saw in your notes it said July. I remember it as being August, but it was around that period. It took us a while to get ourselves spun up, and then to find out who else in the interagency was also working on this. We’re doing this when it’s very close hold about who can be involved, and I think I didn’t have more than five people involved in it. The State Department had something going, and I’m sure the intelligence agencies all had things going, but we became the place where people could go and talk about Iraq outside the war plan, about what was going to happen afterward and what we needed to do from a political and military standpoint.\n\nBakich\n\nSo then when does the Executive Steering Group enter the picture, and Frank Miller’s leadership?\n\nCasey\n\nI don’t remember exactly. My recollection is that we in the military, in the Joint Staff, took it as far as we could in the interagency by ourselves. I was getting things done just by my own personal relationships with people in the State Department. I think one day I looked at Frank and I said, “You know, Frank, you ought to be doing this, because this is interagency coordination. I’m happy for you to come over and take charge of this meeting here and if you invite these guys, they’ll come and they’ll come at a high level,” which is what happened.\n\nNelson\n\nIs there a problem created by having Central Command in Tampa, and all the other work going on in Washington—a geographical problem, a coordination problem?\n\nCasey\n\nNo, it’s actually better because you don’t want the people in Washington involved at a tactical and operational level. Tactical and operational actions suck people in. They become a magnet, people are fascinated by it, and, really, it’s a chore to keep people in Washington focused at the strategic level.\n\nBakich\n\nThat’s really interesting.\n\nRiley\n\nI wanted to go back and ask a couple of questions before we get too far down the road.\n\nCasey\n\nDid I get to yours?\n\nPerry\n\nYes, but I guess I would say, do you have anything more specific to say about how you were perceiving, given the information you were getting, what would happen in taking out Saddam, and what would be necessary to fill that vacuum?\n\nCasey\n\nI will tell you that we probably focused more on the internal Iraq implications than we necessarily did on the broad regional implications. I’m sure we talked about it, but at the end of October, I briefed the National Security Council on postwar planning.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is ’02?\n\nCasey\n\nThis is ’02. For the first time I presented a broad view of how we saw the situation at that time. I remember getting knowing glances as I went through this, and then I remember talking to Steve Hadley a bit later and I realized from the questions he was asking how little they really understood about what I had been telling them. It was because this was fundamentally new to them. It was the first time that they really had to chew on this. I went back to the deputies and did it again for the deputies, and let them ask questions.\n\nThis is something that’s just my own thought, but the Democratic administration, the Clinton administration, had been through Bosnia, had been through Kosovo, and they had understood postwar, postconflict planning. They’d been immersed in it. Bosnia, we struggled through. Kosovo, we learned from Bosnia, and we did that much better. Now you have all these Republican folks who basically weren’t in government when all that stuff happened and they’re thinking about this for the first time.\n\nBakich\n\nIt was NSPD-56 [National Security Presidential Directive] that was Complex Contingency Operations that they did away with very early on in the administration. That was a holdover from the Clinton administration’s experience.\n\nCasey\n\nRight. I hadn’t thought that but yes, you’re right. I remember that vaguely. Anyway, there was a big educational process on that end, and then there’s friction between what Wolfowitz and his folks are saying, because they’re being fed by Iraqis, that we will be welcomed as liberators. “We’re not going to stay for a long time.” “Why do we need to be thinking about all this stuff when we’re not going to be there for that long?” they asked.\n\nNelson\n\nYou said, by way of self-criticism I thought, that you’d been thinking about the in-country, but not the region, the implications.\n\nCasey\n\nThe briefing focused on the internal implications and less on the regional implications.\n\nNelson\n\nOK, so in your own thinking, you were aware of the regional consequences. I was thinking in particular of its borders, of Iraq.\n\nCasey\n\nDid I think, when we went into this, that this was going to spawn the Arab Spring? No way. That was not something that I thought about.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you think there would be a group like al-Qaeda in Iraq that would be coming in across the border of Iraq?\n\nCasey\n\nWe thought we would be a magnet, that we would attract terrorists that would come to Iraq to fight us. We knew about the borders. There’s a slide that I used, a map of Iraq, and around the edge, we had all the things that we thought were going to happen, like sectarian conflict, terrorists crossing borders, Iranian influence, and Syrian influence. It was a snapshot. It was very much a snapshot.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is what I really want to dig into, the question of what were you learning during this period in terms of your expectation that would happen inside Iraq, and if you have recollections about the substance of the briefing that you’re giving at the National Security Council.\n\nCasey\n\nIs this all unclassified?\n\nRiley\n\nWe have to ask you to use your judgment about this. It doesn’t go anywhere.\n\nCasey\n\nThe reason I’m saying that is because I’ve got the briefing; it’s in my papers at the National Defense University.\n\nRiley\n\nIt could be appended.\n\nCasey\n\nIt could be. We’ve had a bunch of stuff declassified. I don’t know if this has been declassified or not.\n\nRiley\n\nI couldn’t tell you.\n\nCasey\n\nBut it’s up there. I haven’t looked at it in a long time.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, but just to further the discussion, are there things that you can tell us about your—We’re trying to recapture—\n\nCasey\n\nRight, and I haven’t thought about this in a long time. What did we think? First and foremost, after being involved in Bosnia and Kosovo, I knew this was going to be a long-term proposition. In fact, Brad Graham, a Washington Post reporter, was interviewing me one day and asked what I thought and I said, “I thought it was going to take an Army corps five years.” Now, I was fudging a little bit, because a corps can be anything from 45,000 to 100,000+, but it was going to take at least five years, because I’d seen what happened in Bosnia and I’d seen what happened in Kosovo. Things just don’t happen that quickly in postconflict environments.\n\nAgain, this is all rubbing up against the friction that, Hey, this is going to be easy and we’re all going to be gone. We thought there were going to be frictions. I would tell you that I thought that people, even the Sunni population, would be relieved to be out from under Saddam’s thumb. We figured that there would be obviously some vested interests that would not be so happy about that, and we expected that there would be some friction. I don’t think we expected it to go into a full-blown insurgency. We also expected that there would be economic issues.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you expect that the Army would be disbanded, the Ba’ath Party?\n\nCasey\n\nNo, we actually planned to have a very low level of de-Ba’athification. We planned on telling the Army to return to their barracks and we’d deal with them when we got to them, but that was in terms of the general situation.\n\nThe other interesting thing is how poor our intelligence was about what life was like inside Iraq. People always ask me what I was most surprised about and I always say the infrastructure. I was amazed at how poor the infrastructure was, particularly in the Shia areas. He had great roads, so Saddam Hussein could move his forces around quickly, but there was no water, no sewage, no electricity in a lot of these Shia areas. It was amazing how bad it was, and that kind of transcended everything. We didn’t have people on the ground. We didn’t have good sources, so we really knew very little.\n\nBakich\n\nAt this point then, are you—You said you’re liaising with the State Department. Do you have anyone involved in the Future of Iraq Project that they’re running up there?\n\nCasey\n\nThose are the guys that we’re liaising with. They’re coming to our meetings. We’re getting their product.\n\nBakich\n\nThe Future of Iraq Project has been on the one hand praised as being prescient. On the other hand, it’s denigrated for having no planning content. I was wondering if you could weigh in on what the State Department is—the quality of what they’re doing, the usefulness of it.\n\nCasey\n\nMy sense is that the Future of Iraq Project was useful to the State Department. It didn’t necessarily have the same utility to us as military planners who were going to have to do things, but it was very informative. That’s what the State Department does. They do that kind of stuff. It was informative and as I said, I expect most of the criticism is from the military side because it wasn’t military planning, but it still was informative.\n\nBakich\n\nThat was the criticism from what I understood too.\n\nCasey\n\nYou asked this about intelligence too, but OSD has an international policy group that always conflicts with the State Department’s policy side. They have an intelligence group that always conflicts with the intelligence side. It’s a big gorilla that has tentacles into everybody else’s business in Washington.\n\nThe personalities were such, with Doug Feith, particularly, at the deputies level in the interagency. He was always right and he was so tenacious in his arguments and in his positions that it really became difficult. It made interagency coordination difficult, if not impossible. When I was going around making my pre-Iraq visits, I went over and saw Marc Grossman, who was the Under Secretary of State at that time, whom I had known for years, and he said the friction over the NSPD (the division of labor between State and Defense)—The friction on that with Feith had just broken the relationship. He said they were done. And he’s a pro, you know?\n\nBakich\n\nYes.\n\nCasey\n\nHe was so frustrated with Feith that he didn’t see how the departments could work together at all. I saw it and it’s true.\n\nBakich\n\nAre you speaking to [Richard] Armitage at all during this time?\n\nCasey\n\nI met with Armitage, Grossman and [Colin] Powell. It was the same thing.\n\nBakich\n\nI might actually be jumping ahead about five months here, but in your interactions with senior policymakers, you see that they are surprised at the description of what is likely to happen in the aftermath of major combat operations, things like that. Is it at this point that you start to realize the necessity of standing up the taskforce for looking at how do we explicitly start planning for postcombat stability, postcombat reconstruction? And then I’m going to take you to: Do you have relations with [David] McKiernan at CFLCC [Coalition Forces Land Component Command] on that point?\n\nCasey\n\nLet me back up a little bit. This is October. The other problem you have with postwar planning for a war you haven’t decided you were going to do yet—you’re dealing with a pretty small group and you can’t talk about it outside that group. Any time you have a very restricted group, you have restricted inputs; that’s just the reality of it. I did the briefing in October and then it devolved, between October and December, into a fight between State and Defense about who’s going to be in charge. The plan that we laid out was the military goes in and then basically assumes control, which by international law, that’s what we had to do. At some period, we pass it off to a civilian, who then at some time passes it off to the Iraqis. That’s kind of the thought process. But immediately there was friction between Feith and Wolfowitz, and to some extent Rumsfeld—Secretary Rumsfeld had no confidence in the State Department’s ability to do anything operational (and it wasn’t too far off the mark)—and the State Department about who would be in charge.\n\nFrom October to December, when the President finally put out the NSPD breaking the tie, it evolved into a battle between State and Defense about who’s going to be in charge in the postwar time. You had the Feith/Wolfowitz group that said this is going to be easy and we ought to be able to do this, and then you had the other group who said this is going to be hard; it’s going to take a long time and we have to be more thoughtful about it.\n\nSo the President puts out the NSPD, which basically establishes ORHA [Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance]. So now you have this guy, Jay Garner, who’s been given the mission but he’s got no staff and he’s got nobody to do any work for him.\n\nBakich\n\nThis is NSPD-24 in January, correct?\n\nCasey\n\nI don’t know. As you’ve seen, I’ve lost my NSPD numbers. To get Garner a staff, from my time down at Joint Forces Command, I remember that each of the combatant commands had these standing joint taskforce headquarters, which are basically a group of folks that had all the communications capabilities that could stand up a joint taskforce. So I said, why don’t we get the one from the Joint Forces Command, and give it to Garner in Central Command so they have somebody who can focus on postwar planning?\n\nRiley\n\nHad you known Garner before?\n\nCasey\n\nBriefly. So that’s where that came from. Then I got a couple of guys who had Bosnia experience and injected them into the headquarters. I had my division chief of staff and General Steve Hawkins, who had been in Bosnia with us, and put them down there so that we had some people who had some level of understanding for postwar planning.\n\nBakich\n\nLet me just make sure that I’ve got this clear in my head. The joint taskforce is specifically designed to work with ORHA, not necessarily with CENTCOM and CFLCC.\n\nCasey\n\nIt was both, but we recognized that we couldn’t control how Central Command used it. So I think you’re right, we stood it up and gave it to Central Command, but in my mind I thought that ORHA would go down and be the lead in the headquarters.\n\nBakich\n\nWhich matters, might as well.\n\nCasey\n\nYes. You can’t give somebody a mission like that and then not give him any staff to do it. Anyway, I’m a little vague on the timing of that, but I think that’s how it came out.\n\nNelson\n\nI was thinking about your comment earlier, five years and a corps, and that was based on the assumption that Iraq would have a functioning military and a functioning civil service. What would it have been if you had made different assumptions, which turned out to be what actually happened, about the Army?\n\nCasey\n\nIt’s all in the assumptions. But the other thing is the USA was doing something for the first time in anyone’s memory. When is the last time we attacked a country? Maybe the Spanish-American War. Everybody was doing something for the first time. Going to war is so consuming and there are so many different things and variables that could go right, or that could go wrong. When you look at the list of what-ifs that we did in the military, about oil fires and all these different war-planning things, it was all-consuming.\n\nThe impact on the President? He’s getting all of this different advice. One of the things that Rumsfeld was very good at was asking hard questions, and he was “kicking over a lot of rocks” on the plan to go to war. It was so difficult and so complex, and the outcome was so uncertain going into the war, that it became all-consuming and there was precious little intellectual and emotional energy left to say, “OK, let’s put the plan together here for the postwar.”\n\nBakich\n\nIt’s interesting that you say that because it sounds to me like you’re going into this entire endeavor with the uncertainties looming large in your mind, and much of what I’ve read about Feith, Wolfowitz, and to a considerable extent, Rumsfeld—what we have are certainties.\n\nCasey\n\nYes, it’s interesting.\n\nBakich\n\nI don’t know if you have anything to say or add or maybe say that I’m wrong about that.\n\nCasey\n\nThey were more certain in their mind about the outcomes, but we’re paid to be pessimists in the military.\n\nRiley\n\nI missed my career calling. I want to ask a point of clarification. Go ahead.\n\nCasey\n\nOne other thing here, because now we’re getting down to the end of the year—The last piece, and this gets at what this standing joint taskforce headquarters was about. In December, we also sent Tommy Franks strategic guidance on the postwar planning, where the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs directed him to do the planning necessary for postwar Iraq. This directive went down along with the standing joint taskforce headquarters, so in our minds we weren’t just giving him the mission and telling him “Suck it up with everything else you’re doing.” Now we’re giving him a group to do that planning. But my view is that Tommy Franks never embraced the postwar mission. You can do all the planning you want in Washington, but it doesn’t make a thing happen on the ground. It’s not until the planning goes to the next level, and that level gives directives to people on the ground to do things, that you actually have a functional plan. In my view, that level never happened.\n\nRiley\n\nThis might partly answer the question I wanted to ask. There’s sort of a perception from the outside that in the end the Defense Department really didn’t want to be the major force in postwar, that the job of the Defense Department was to go win the kinetic battle, and then it becomes somebody else’s problem in the U.S. government, once the battle is won, and the troops want to return home. Is that a misperception of some of what’s going on here?\n\nCasey\n\nI don’t think there was any doubt that Secretary Rumsfeld did not want to be involved in the postwar reconstruction of Iraq. He wanted to be out of there as fast as we could. And some of the friction that you see with the military units about “You’re going. You’re staying. You’re going. You’re staying,” is caused by this perceived desire to get out. It was directed. I don’t have firsthand knowledge of this, but John Abizaid tells me that they were told to get out of Iraq.\n\nThe other thing that caused confusion was that we had always planned that Third Army, a three-star headquarters with a colonel level, mature staff, would be the one to go in and take charge in the aftermath, to take charge of the postwar—This was General Dave McKiernan. We recognized that a corps is an operational headquarters that is not designed to operate at the level the Army headquarters can operate at. Rumsfeld pulled the Third Army headquarters out of there pretty quickly, which was a major problem. My impression was that he wanted us out of there and he conveyed that to Tommy Franks, and that’s what they were doing.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd that would have colored the prewar planning as well, right? We’ll go in and take care of business but then it’s somebody else’s problem.\n\nCasey\n\nIt corroded postwar planning, I think, with Tommy Franks, which is maybe one of the reasons why he didn’t do much and they didn’t do much in CENTCOM to operationalize the directives that he was given. Now the other thing that we did when we stood up this taskforce was we brought all those guys to Washington and we did a two or three-day seminar over at the NDU [National Defense University] in January, to bring these guys and gals up to speed on what was going on.\n\nRiley\n\nThese guys and gals, meaning?\n\nCasey\n\nThe joint taskforce, the 58 people down there that we stood up. It was all of us coming together, DoD [Department of Defense] and State Department and intel agencies, to educate these folks. In my view, we did everything we could at the strategic level there to prepare these guys for success.\n\nRiley\n\nHow did that go? Can you tell us about that?\n\nCasey\n\nI went over there to help kick it off. I didn’t stay for the whole thing, but we got very positive feedback for it. We were the core group of Iraq postwar planners, and we got ourselves all spun up, and then we widened the group. Then we had to stop what we were doing and get all these new people spun up, so just doing that over and over takes time. It takes weeks and months before this thing expands. It’s not instantaneous.\n\nRiley\n\nThere was one other thing I wanted to follow up on. This is another perception from the outside, which is that there was a criticism about contemplating costs broadly, and I would include military personnel, because of exactly the factors that you’re suggesting, the almost impossibility of planning. Is it the case that there was pressure to avoid dealing with cost estimates of this nature because of the sense that if you’re forced to reckon with these costs before you go in, you’re going to complicate the business of rallying support to make possible the invasion in the first place?\n\nCasey\n\nTo a degree. I would say the difference is—There wasn’t a reluctance to consider the costs internally; there was a reluctance to discuss the costs publicly.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you’re providing estimates?\n\nCasey\n\nThere were estimates of casualties and costs of the ground war. Frankly, we didn’t know enough to project what the costs of a long-term postwar plan were.\n\nRiley\n\nBudgetary costs, rather than long-term.\n\nCasey\n\nBudgetary costs, personal costs. I knew it was going to take a long time to get it to a point where we could credibly walk away and say, “OK, we’ve done our best here,” but I couldn’t have told you if it was going to cause 100 casualties or 2,000 or whatever it was. We didn’t have that level of detail.\n\nRiley\n\nAs a professional planner, is it common for you to get to a point in a planning process where you say, “I don’t have enough information in order to make a plausible projection about what’s going to happen,” or is it more likely that the military way is to say if X then Y, if Y then—?\n\nCasey\n\nNo. Sometimes, you just have to say, “I can’t give you an intelligent answer to that.” If someone had asked me, “How many casualties do you think it’s going to take in the five years that we’re going to be there?” I can’t tell you. It depends on what kind of resistance you want to postulate. If there’s heavy resistance, OK, maybe you can figure that out. There were some things that weren’t credibly known.\n\nRiley\n\nIf I can push this then, we shouldn’t take the absence of hard cost estimates in advance as an indication of planned obfuscation; in other words, the political people were saying, “We’re not going to tell you how much this costs because that’s a deterrent to taking the action we want to take.” This actually could very well plausibly be a function of the impossibility of planning in an uncertain environment.\n\nCasey\n\nYes and no. Cost is a good example. There was reluctance to come up with how much this is going to cost. You don’t know. You can make planning assumptions and you can say, “If all this happens, here’s a range of cost estimates.” But in Washington you hate to put a number out, because as soon as you put the number out, you might as well chisel it in stone. So there is a reluctance to give out numbers. Now, I’ve never heard anyone in the administration say, “We don’t want to tell them this because they might not vote for it.” There was not an obfuscation. But I know that people in the administration—Some people thought that way, and what they did on their own was up to them.\n\nRiley\n\nThank you.\n\nBakich\n\nWe’ve been talking, actually looking downward toward the command. I’d like to kind of take the gaze up. As soon as you invite Frank Miller in, or you bring him to the meeting and say this is an interagency thing and it makes sense for you to staff it—At this point, can you describe the direction, management, oversight of Steve Hadley and Condi Rice? Are they taking an active effort in trying to drive the interagency system in particular ways?\n\nCasey\n\nFor postwar planning?\n\nBakich\n\nYes, for postwar planning.\n\nCasey\n\nI don’t have direct knowledge of that, but my impression from Frank was that we were the only ones who were doing postwar planning, and it wasn’t until the end of October when I briefed the National Security Council—that was like the first toe in the water. Hadley was having deputies’ lunches to discuss postwar planning—and that was my first introduction, probably in the July/August time frame. The Vice Chairman, Peter Pace, was going to those. When we stood up the cell, then I started going to those meetings. So Hadley was doing some things, but it was at a very high level and the discussion was just discussion and it wasn’t leading to any actions.\n\nNelson\n\nHere’s what I’m hearing, and tell me if it’s what you’re actually saying; that is, you all are doing this postwar planning work intensively and thoughtfully, but General Franks isn’t really interested, the Secretary’s office isn’t really interested. Who else within the military is interested? Who is actually interested in what you’re doing and wanting to work on it?\n\nCasey\n\nI was the one who had postwar planning experience and frankly I was the one who was driving it. Frank Miller was my comrade in arms in this, because Frank realized that this was going to be important in the long haul. We had Ryan Crocker and a few others over at State working on that Future of Iraq Project, but it was largely driven by our own initiative.\n\nNelson\n\nIt sounds like a voice crying in the wilderness.\n\nCasey\n\nWell, my impression was, it wasn’t that people didn’t want to think about it. They were just so consumed with the decision to go to war. What if we lost? Think about that. What if Saddam had employed chemical weapons against us? What if he had blown up all the oil wells? Things could have been a lot worse.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat I’m also hearing is that when the war was won, it’s not as if people said, “Now, General Casey, we’re ready to hear all that you have to tell us and are going to implement that.” Is that the case?\n\nCasey\n\nNow I move from the J5 to the director of the Joint Staff in January, and so I move out of the postwar planning business, unfortunately. I kept my fingers in it enough to ensure the transition went smoothly, but I was out of the business. I looked back at that and thought, What could have been different if I had stayed there and kept banging on this?\n\nNelson\n\nSo when you left, nobody picked up the torch?\n\nCasey\n\nMy successor picked up the torch, but I forget how long the gap was. He picked up the torch and did it and worked it with Feith. By that time you had ORHA, and you had Garner there. He had a little office in the Pentagon with butcher paper on the wall, in a little corner.\n\nBakich\n\nDid you go to the rock drill that ORHA ran in January or February? I think it was at NDU, if I’m not mistaken.\n\nCasey\n\nThat’s what I was talking about. That was the seminar. They call it a rock drill; I don’t know why.\n\nBakich\n\nThat was Garner’s phrase, yes. How many people were there?\n\nCasey\n\nI remember 50 or 60.\n\nRiley\n\nI want to go back and ask you once again—You had said that you started attending the lunches with Steve Hadley.\n\nCasey\n\nMaybe we need to go back to that. They’re consumed with war planning for one thing, but the other thing was, there was this mindset from Rumsfeld and crew that we ought not stay there. Again, I don’t have direct, firsthand knowledge of that, but Abizaid says Rumsfeld was very clear about that with Franks and Franks was following that guidance, and that was a problem. And from what I’ve read in his book, he doesn’t own up to the impact that that direction had on the force.\n\nPerry\n\nThat is, Secretary Rumsfeld does not?\n\nCasey\n\nYes. In President Bush’s book, he says the second biggest failing after no weapons of mass destruction was reducing the number of troops early on in the mission. That led to this big spike in insecurity that led to the insurgency. To me, that was Rumsfeld’s desire. That’s what he was pushing on the military.\n\nNelson\n\nHe ended up looking awfully smart in the prewar planning, right? Telling General Franks, You don’t need 400,000; you can do it with such and such, and on the ground—\n\nCasey\n\nNo, he did. In fact, my conclusion about the civil-military interaction in the run-up to that war plan was that it was pretty good. The President was involved, and the Secretary of Defense. It was very good and it produced a very good and successful war plan. Unfortunately, we miscalculated on the front end and we miscalculated on the back end.\n\nRiley\n\nWhich takes me back to my question about Steve Hadley and your experience with him. You said you’re meeting with him on a regular basis for lunch during some interval before you move on.\n\nCasey\n\nThe lunch meetings give way to the Frank Miller meetings. The deputies are there and they’re doing their thing. They’re listening to the war plans and they’re asking themselves, OK, what are we really doing about the postwar? That got th"
