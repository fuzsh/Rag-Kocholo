        "text": "Baghdad, Iraq – Insurgents gunned down a senior Iraqi Interior Ministry official today, and the bodies of seven men shot in the head were found dumped west of Baghdad.\n\nA senior U.S. military official attributed Iraq’s recent escalation in violence to an order from terrorist mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nAccording to a senior U.S. military official, who told reporters he did not want to be named after briefing them, the recent upsurge in violence can be attributed to a meeting in neighboring Syria about a month ago by lieutenants of the Jordanian-born al-Zarqawi, who may have attended.\n\nThe meeting was held to try and ramp up terrorist attacks, particularly suicide car bombings, throughout Iraq, the official said.\n\nAl-Zarqawi, according to information obtained by the U.S. military, was angered by a perceived lull in the militant campaign, the official told reporters. His call for increased attacks sparked the deadly wave of violence.\n\nHe said there had been 21 car bombings in Baghdad during May, compared with 25 such attacks in the capital in all of 2004.\n\n“There was recently a gathering of insurgents in Syria with al-Zarqawi and his leadership to have some additional discussions or guidance with the insurgents,” the official said.\n\nThe official also said the military obtained intelligence from detainees, Iraqi military sources and data from the field to corroborate that the meeting took place in Syria, which the United States has accused of doing too little to curb the flow of foreign fighters into the country.\n\n“He (al-Zarqawi) allegedly was not happy with how the insurgency was going, the government was getting stronger and coalition forces not being defeated. Some intelligence reports from captives showed that al-Zarqawi directed people to start using more vehicle-borne devices and use them in everyday operations,” the official said.\n\nAl-Zarqawi is Iraq’s most-wanted terrorist and has a $25 million bounty on his head – the same as for Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe insurgency also was discussed Tuesday during a historic visit to Baghdad by Iran’s foreign minister, who pledged to secure his country’s borders to stop militants from entering Iraq.\n\nPrime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari also announced plans for his first foreign trip, a two-day visit to neighboring Turkey on Friday and Saturday. The insurgency is expected to top the agenda.\n\nBrig. Gen. Ibrahim Khamas was shot and killed by four gunmen in a four-door sedan as he drove through Baghdad’s southeastern Zaafaraniyah district, police Col. Nouri Abdullah said. Khamas’ wife and driver were wounded. Insurgents last week also killed an Interior Ministry colonel and a Defense Ministry general.\n\nKhamas’ killing purportedly was claimed by al-Qaeda in Iraq. A statement posted on an Internet site described Khamas as “one of the heads of apostasy, and one of America’s tails.”\n\nThe authenticity of the claim, posted on a site that carries similar statements, could not be verified.\n\nAlso in Baghdad, a roadside bomb targeting an American military convoy exploded, wounding seven Iraqis, police Lt. Col. Ahmed Aboud Efait said. There were no reports of American casualties, he said.\n\nIn the northern city of Mosul, 225 miles northwest of Baghdad, mortar attacks by insurgents killed two Iraqis and injured eight others, including seven school children, police and hospital officials said.\n\nA car bomb also detonated in Baqouba, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad, injuring 14 people – including 2 police officers. The parked car blew up as a police convoy drove by in the city center, damaging all the vehicles, police Col. Mudhafar Muhammed said.\n\nGunmen also shot dead Transport Ministry driver Ali Mutib Sakr in Sadr City, a predominantly Shiite area in eastern Baghdad, police Lt. Col. Shakir Wadi said.\n\nIraqi soldiers discovered the bodies of seven blindfolded men who were shot in the head and dumped on the roadside in the Sunni Triangle town of Amiriyah, some 25 miles west of Baghdad, said Mohammed al-Ani, a doctor at Ramadi General Hospital.\n\nThe violence came a day after Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said the “situation would have been much worse” in Iraq if Tehran was supporting the insurgency as the United States claims.\n\nIraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said after meeting Kharrazi that militants have infiltrated from Iran “but we are not saying that they are approved by the Iranian government.”\n\nTies between the neighbors improved after the ouster of Hussein, who led an eight-year war against Iran during the 1980s that killed more than 1 million people. Relations remained cool after that war, with Iran supporting anti-Saddam groups and the former Iraqi leader hosting the Mujahedeen Khalq, an Iranian militia fighting the Shiite religious regime in Tehran.\n\nBut since the U.S.-led invasion swept Hussein from power, Iraq’s majority Shiite Muslim community has risen to power and worked to build close ties with Iran.\n\nIran, however, has been accused of supporting insurgents in Iraq to destabilize reconstruction efforts by the United States, which regards Tehran as a terror sponsor bent on producing nuclear weapons. Iran denies both claims.\n\nAl-Jaafari, who led anti-Hussein militiamen based in Iran during his two-decade exile, has said Iraq now wants positive relations with Iran."
