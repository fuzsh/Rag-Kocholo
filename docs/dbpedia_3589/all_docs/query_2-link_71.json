        "text": "The first democratically elected Iraqi government in 50 years was sworn in on 3 May.\n\nSeven cabinet posts were initially left vacant as Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari sought a deal with Sunni Arabs.\n\nOne deputy prime ministerial post is still vacant, and is likely to be filled by a woman.\n\nIbrahim Jaafari, a 58-year-old physician, was spokesman for the Islamic Daawa Party, one of Iraq's oldest political parties. Born in Karbala in 1947, he was educated at Mosul university as a medical doctor. He lived in Iran and UK from the 1980s until the fall of Saddam Hussein.\n\nWhen he was serving in the mainly ceremonial role of vice-president in the US-appointed interim regime, an opinion poll last year suggested Mr Jaafari was Iraq's most popular politician.\n\nMr Jaafari is widely seen as a unifying figure, keen to bring Sunni Arabs into the democratic fold after their widespread absence from election polling stations.\n\nAhmed Chalabi's appointment as a deputy prime minister is something of a revival for a man once touted at the Pentagon as a future president of Iraq, but who fell dramatically from grace.\n\nDuring 2004 the Shia politician saw his home and offices raided and an arrest warrant issued amid accusations of counterfeiting.\n\nMr Chalabi, who had the ear of many in Washington during the run-up to war, fell out with his former patrons as the invasion of Iraq turned to messy occupation. There were whispers from Washington that Mr Chalabi, a Shia, had all along been duping the Americans by spying for the Iranians, which he has denied.\n\nBefore taking up the position of vice-president in the interim Iraqi government that was formed in June 2004, Mr Shawis was president of the Kurdistan National Assembly - the Iraqi Kurdish parliament based in Irbil.\n\nHe is a senior member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.\n\nA Sunni Arab, and a former major general in Saddam's army who rose to prominence during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.\n\nA Sunni Arab and reportedly a moderate, whose family has its roots in the western al-Anbar province, one of the most active hotbeds of the insurgency. He is thought to be close to Sunni Vice-President Ghazi Yawer.\n\nA former army lieutenant colonel, he left Iraq in the 1980s. He was active in opposition to Saddam Hussein, who sentenced him to death in absentia and confiscated his assets.\n\nFluent in English, he has a PhD in social psychology from the UK's Keele University, and has taught in Jordan and the US.\n\nThe son of a highly respected Shia cleric from Najaf and leading member of the former governing council, Mr Uloum held the oil ministry portfolio in the interim government between September 2003 and June 2004.\n\nSometimes know as Bayan Jabr, he is a senior official of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri). A Shia Turkmen, Mr Solagh ran Sciri's office in Damascus during the 1990s, and represented the council in Lebanon and Syria from his base in Beirut.\n\nMr Zebari was the foreign spokesman for the Kurdistan Democratic Party for more than 10 years.\n\nHe frequently represented the KDP in meetings with US State Department officials throughout the 1990s.\n\nHe was born in 1953 in the Kurdish town of Aqrah, but grew up in the mainly Arab city of Mosul. He is a graduate of the University of Essex in the UK.\n\nAn official of President Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan since 1998, Mr Saleh became prime minister of the PUK-led regional government in January 2001. He survived an assassination attempt at his home in April 2002.\n\nHe joined the Iraqi transitional government in June 2004 as deputy prime minister for security affairs.\n\nOne of the most senior biochemists in Iraq, Mr Mudhaffar is also a former president of Baghdad University. He has been instrumental in promoting biochemistry and related subjects such as molecular biotechnology research. He has published more than 50 inventions and 250 scientific papers.\n\nHe was education minister in the transitional government.\n\nA Kurd from Irbil, Ms Barwari is a close ally of Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Massoud Barzani. Born in 1967, she became a political prisoner at the age of 14 and fled Iraq after the 1991 Kurdish uprising. She worked for the UN in northern Iraq, including as head of the Centre for Human Settlements field office in 1997.\n\nShe received an MA at Harvard University in public administration in 1999, before becoming minister of reconstruction and development in the Kurdish regional government. She continues with the portfolio she took in the transitional government in September 2003.\n\nA female member of the PUK with a PhD in communications from King's College, London, Ms Masum has been active in the Kurdistan human rights community.\n\nBorn in 1970, she is the daughter of Fouad Masum, the former speaker of Iraq's interim parliament.\n\nA Shia based in London until the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Mr Allawi was once an adviser to the Arab Monetary Fund in Kuwait.\n\nHe became minister of trade in September 2003, and was given the first defence portfolio in the transitional government in April 2004.\n\nA former PUK official, Mr Rashid took on his current portfolio as a member of the transitional government in September 2003.\n\nNarmin Othman has been minister of state for women's affairs in the Iraqi transitional government since June 2004.\n\nA PUK member and former legal adviser to Barham Salih, Mr Mawloud was active in the Kurdish armed force known as the peshmerga.\n\nA Shia, Mr Maliki is the former deputy governor of Basra for administrative affairs and a member of radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's political movement.\n\nIn August 2004, Mr Maliki threatened to shut down the port of Basra and halt oil exports to protest against the US-led military campaign against Mr Sadr's forces in Najaf. He urged Shias in several southern cities to secede from the interim government and form their own autonomous region.\n\nA KDP member, Mr Hadi was a human rights and communications minister in Kurdistan's regional government.\n\nA major in the first Gulf War who later became Iraq's commercial attache to Germany, he is linked to Moqtada al-Sadr.\n\nMohsen Shlash: Electricity minister\n\nUsama al-Najafi: Industry minister\n\nHashim al-Shible: Human rights minister - rejected the post after being approved by parliament on 8 May, saying he had not been consulted.\n\nJasim Mohammed Jaafar: Minister of construction and housing\n\nAbdel Falah Hassan: Education minister\n\nAli al-Bahadili: Agriculture minister\n\nAbdel Hussein Shandal: Justice minister\n\nNuri Farhan al-Rawi: Culture minister\n\nBasimah Yusuf Butrus: Minister of science and technology\n\nSuhaylah Abd-Jaafar: Minister of displacement and migration\n\nTalib Aziz Zayni: Minister of youth and sports\n\nAbd-al-Karim al-Anzi: Minister of state for national security affairs\n\nSaad Nayif Mujhim al-Hardan: Minister of state for governorate affairs\n\nAla Habib Kazim: Minister of state for civil society affairs\n\nAzhar Abdel Karim al-Shaikhli: Minister of state for women's affairs\n\nHashim al-Hashimi: Acting minister of state for tourism and antiquities\n\nSafa al-Din Mohammed al-Safi: Minister of state for National Assembly affairs"
