        "text": "Hannah went from drab to fab, radically changing her image before admitting to her husband that she had been unfaithful.\n\nRicky, who proved himself an endearing if untalented trier on “Strictly Come Dancing” recently, complains that his wife’s drastic diet and exercise regime has brought him nothing but misery. Perhaps, though, he should really be looking closer to home for blame.\n\nQuite often, losing a large amount of weight is the forerunner of a drastic re-appraisal of someone’s life. It widens the cracks in relationships and makes partners view what they have objectively, which can lead to break-ups.\n\nRather than airing his “poor me” feelings, Ricky needs to get through his marriage grieving and start living for himself again. Unfortunately, no-one likes a moaner even if he feels justified. Get your act together and get out there again, Ricky. Happiness could be just around the corner."
