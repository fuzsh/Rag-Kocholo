Maybe this is what they mean about your life coming back to haunt you.\n\nDennis Waterman - the man who slept his way through practically every film set he's ever been on, revelling in the ensuing tangle of ex-wives, disgruntled mistresses and conquered leading ladies - is facing a rather sobering reality.\n\nHis eldest daughter, EastEnders actress Hannah, has been swept off her feet by Ricky Groves, one of her co-stars.\n\nThe pair, who play Laura Beale and Garry Hobbs, have made it past the clandestine meetings stage and gone public.\n\nThey have even moved in together, shrugging off Waterman's insistence - born of considerable experience - that on-set romances \"screw up your whole f***ing life\".\n\n\"Experience is a right bugger,\" he admits, mentally returning to the days when any female co-star was potential prey.\n\n\"When you know what can happen on a set, you want your own daughter to run a mile from it. It's a dangerous world and you mix work and relationships at your peril.\n\n\"I don't know if Hannah realises how difficult it can be seeing someone you work with. And when you do fall out - and the hours and the passions and the temptations make sure you do - it is f***ing hard work.\"\n\nOf course, at the time it was all fun and frolics for Waterman, one of the small screen's roughest diamonds.\n\nAlmost all of Waterman's liaisons have begun on set. His first marriage to Penny Dixon faltered after affairs with actresses Suzy Kendall and Romy Schneider, and producer's assistant Theophilla Littleton.\n\nHe wooed actress Patricia Maynard, his second wife and the mother of his two daughters, on the set of The Sweeney.\n\nShe endured his infidelities with a string of other actresses but was powerless to stop him walking out for yet another co-star - wife number three, Polish aristocrat Rula Lenska. Rula, in turn, forgave his dalliances with actress Amanda Redman, and with TV director Fiona Black, before that marriage too combusted in a blaze of violence, bitterness and jealousy.\n\nAnd now, it is Hannah's turn to somehow make a showbiz romance work. Little wonder her father looks so ashen. He agonises over the fact that she has just signed up for another year on EastEnders, when he believes she is worth so much more.\n\n\"A lot of actors sneer at soaps. Yes, I do, too,\" he rants. \"I'm disgusted they're so successful. There is some diabolical acting going on. In the old days, there was soap but there was actually some other stuff to watch.\n\n\"I worry about how long Hannah is going to do it. It's good that she is earning money but she is a great actress and it would be a waste if she did that for too long.\"\n\nThen his thoughts return to the man who now holds her heart. \"It was my big dread that she would come home some day with a man I recognised as a younger version of me. Thank God, that didn't happen.\n\nRICKY isn't like me. He's a great bloke. Solid and sorted. He always has an eye on the future.\n\nHe was telling me about pinball machines the other day - talking of buying one as an investment. He knew all about which kind would sell well. I liked that.\n\n\"He's also a trained chef. It wouldn't surprise me if he gets his own restaurant. He's one of those guys who is going to go forward and do things - the total opposite to Hannah and me. We wait for things to happen.\"\n\nYet when you are Dennis Waterman, you can't quite believe that any man can have your daughter's happiness at heart. Or that your child can be trusted to make her own decisions in love.\n\n\"I like the guy, but I still worry for Hannah. They moved in together far too fast - I told her that. They both had enough money to buy their own places, which would have been a safety valve. If there was a bust up, he could have gone back to his place till it all settled down.\"\n\nAnd there you have it. In Waterman's world the bust-up is as inevitable as the affair, the tears, the heartbreak and recriminations.\n\nIt is no coincidence that he believes his own current relationship with Pam Flint, a former assistant stage manager, has only lasted six years because she does not work, accepts his need to be out boozing, and plays \"the little woman\" to his Victorian master.\n\nOr that the only serious spat in their relationship came after he spied her playing golf with a group of men and was consumed with dread.\n\nPoignantly, his greatest hope for his daughter's happiness seems to come not through his faith in human nature, or her ability to choose the right man, but through the restraints of the EastEnders' time sheet.\n\n\"The only good thing is that, working on the same gig, they know each other's schedules,\" he muses, almost to himself. \"And it's a bit of a factory on a soap set so, hopefully, there won't be time for... you know.\"\n\nThere was a time when it looked as though Waterman's private life would ruin his career. His well-publicised divorce from Lenska ended with her accusing him of being a heavy-drinking wife beater. He admitted he had \"whacked her\" but insisted it was a one-off.\n\nThe spat was ugly and troubling. The British public might love a charismatic Jack the Lad. But a wife-beater is something else and theatre bookings began to fall away. Had Waterman's second wife not rushed to his defence, claiming that he was never violent to her, his whole career may have been in jeopardy.\n\nInstead, it is now enjoying something of a renaissance. For the past two years, he has been treading the boards in London's West End as Eliza Doolittle's father in My Fair Lady. His performance has been acclaimed and opened his eyes to the potential of the theatre. \"Before, I thought it was just something you did between TV shows,\" he admits, in distinctly non-thespian tones. Yet it is the social aspect that seems to thrill most. His dressing room, he proudly reveals, has been turned into the company bar, complete with optics and a TV which serves up a diet of sport.\n\n\"If you ask me about any aspect of my career, I'll be able to tell you about the people rather than the acting side. It's the crews and camaraderie that's most important.\n\n\"Pam had never watched Minder and she's working her way through the videos now. But when I watch it, I don't remember anything about the scenes or script. I'll remember that that day was the one we all went to the boozer for the sound man's birthday or something.\"\n\nWaterman may be infamous for his relationships with women, but it is bonding of the male variety that he appears to crave. He sweeps away any suggestion of regret about his failed relationships with women - \"things go wrong. S*** happens\" - yet appears ashamed at not making super-human efforts to make his male friendships last.\n\nThe death of his former co-star John Thaw, who died of cancer earlier this year, has had a particular impact.\n\n\"He died while I was on the golf course,\" Waterman explains quietly. \"I'd heard he was really low and I'd meant to give him a call, or go down and see him and Sheila but you know how it is... you never get round to it. John's death was hard. After the shock, I felt terrible guilt. I hadn't been touch for ages. When we were working together, we'd been very, very good friends. We were different characters yet that didn't seem to matter.\n\n\"But acting is a weird thing. You move on to another job and the nights out and the phone calls become less frequent. Now, I wonder if I should have made more of an effort...\"\n\nTHERE is none of that aching regret about his failed marriages. More a sort of amused bewilderment.\n\n\"I'm actually quite embarrassed,\" he confides. \"That's why I won't do it again. I won't marry Pam because I'm afraid of getting it wrong again.\n\n\"I read things about someone being married three times and I think: 'You dopey sod.' How can you get to that state without there being something wrong with you? I suppose there must be something wrong with me but I know that I can't change now.\"\n\nThat it is working with Pam is more down to her than him. \"She hasn't tried to change me. Early on, I laid down the rules. I told her I wasn't going to phone her when I was away... but I broke my own rules. Mind you, I called because I wanted to talk to her, not because I felt I had to check in.\"\n\nYet Pam plays a mean game herself. She has worked out how to be a mate to Waterman, as well as a source of sex and sponge cakes. At the end of our interview, he spies her outside, set for their round of golf, and remarks on how lucky he is.\n\n\"A lot of the blokes here don't have partners who play golf,\" he says. \"I'm not saying they have bad marriages but they have to go shopping on Saturdays. Poor buggers.\"\n\n.Dennis Waterman will host a celebrity golf day at the Lambourne Golf Club, Bucks, on July 7, to raise money for the charity Sparks, of which he is patron. It funds medical research into conditions that affect newborn babies and children.
