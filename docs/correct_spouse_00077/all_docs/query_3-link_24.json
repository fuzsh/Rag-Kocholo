        "text": "Hannah Waterman and Huw Higginson are getting to know each other pretty well at the moment – they are on the road together not just in one play but two.\n\nThe two-hander Killing Time, brings them to Guildford’s Yvonne Arnaud Theatre this week, and they are also getting set for a revival of the 1960s’ comedy Rattle Of A Simple Man.\n\nHannah describes Killing Time as a twisty psychological thriller in which she and Huw are caught up in some risky mind-games.\n\n“It’s challenging for the audience,” she reveals. “You really have to listen to what’s going on.”\n\nHannah is best-known for her role in EastEnders – she played Laura Beale for more than four years. The soap also brought her personal happiness as she met her husband, Ricky Groves who plays Gary Hobbs, on set.\n\nThey live with two dogs named Eric and Ernie, after a quite well-known comedy team.\n\nHannah was last on stage in a tour of Strangers On A Train, based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith which Hitchcock turned into a screen classic.\n\nShe also worked in the West End with farce master Ray Cooney. “That was a theatrical lesson in itself,” she says.\n\nShe has just finished filming a new series of the BBC hit drama New Tricks, in which she had the pleasure of working with dad Dennis.\n\nAs for Huw he became nationally known for his 10-year stretch as PC George Garfield in TV’s The Bill.\n\nDirected by Ian Dickens, Killing Time is at Guildford until Saturday."
