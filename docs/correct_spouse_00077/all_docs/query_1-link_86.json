        "text": "Bobby Beale (Clay Milner Russell) has had a dark history in EastEnders including a spell in prison for killing his sister Lucy (Hetti Bywater).\n\nIn recent years we’ve seen him come head to head with a number of residents, including Lucy’s mum Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), who don’t have faith he can change.\n\nWe’ve also seen him struggle in the last week as his 21st birthday approaches – a milestone that Lucy never got to celebrate.\n\nThings are also a little rocky between Bobby and girlfriend Anna Knight (Molly Rainford), with him unable to bond with her beloved pooch Tyson. With her old flame Freddie Slater (Bobby Brazier) back on the scene, it looks likely that feelings could soon resurface…\n\nTo make matters worse for Bobby, his former step-mum Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) then arrived back on the scene, the woman who raised him and helped to conceal Lucy’s murder.\n\nHere, find out who Bobby’s birth mother was, why step-mum Jane returned to Albert Square, and if she’ll be staying for long…\n\nWho is Bobby Beale’s mum?\n\nBobby Beale is the son of Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman), although there was initially drama surrounding the identity of his father.\n\nLaura had originally thought that Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) was Bobby’s dad, but it was later revealed that Garry had the wrong blood group and that Ian was the rightful father.\n\nIan initially avoided caring for Bobby, letting Garry look after him while unaware that he was not really his son.\n\nLaura then died in April 2004 after tripping on Bobby’s toys and falling down the stairs.\n\nAfter her death, the truth about Bobby’s real father came out when Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) discovered his birth certificate.\n\nJane Beale was close to Bobby and acted as his adoptive mother for a portion of his childhood while she was married to Ian.\n\nShe had discovered Lucy Beale’s body after Bobby had killed her, and she had initially protected him by moving the body and convincing him that he hadn’t killed her.\n\nBobby later attacked Jane by hitting her on the head and legs with a hockey stick, before being sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nWhy did Jane return to EastEnders?\n\nJane Beale contacted Ian again hoping to reconnect with Bobby ahead of his birthday.\n\nThe ordeal was emotional for Jane, as expected. At first, Bobby struggled to warm to his mum because he couldn’t understand why Jane had forgiven him for the ordeal surrounding Lucy’s murder, let alone attacking and paralysing her with a hockey stick.\n\nJane explained that she’s able to move past everything because Bobby is her son and she loves him unconditionally. As they chatted about forgiveness, Bobby broke down and Jane was able to comfort him.\n\nA little while later, prior to Bobby leaving, he was gifted an early birthday present by Jane. He opened the box to find a silver band with The Verse of Ayatul Kursi engraved on it – a powerful piece of text from the Quran.\n\nWhen Bobby, Peter (Thomas Law) and Ian arrived back in Albert Square, Jane was then seen on the phone to former character Masood (Nitin Ganatra).\n\nIt was confirmed Jane and Masood are in a relationship, and that Masood had helped Jane with Bobby’s birthday present.\n\nHas Jane left EastEnders?\n\nIt was a flying visit for Jane Beale this time round, as we know she has left the BBC One soap.\n\n‘I was quite nervous on the first day, thinking, “Gosh, do I remember how to be Jane?” But even though I was nervous, I’d had quite a lot of time to think about it, having had the scripts for a while, so it was just about getting back into the swing of it’, Laurie said.\n\n‘When I walked on set and saw Adam (Woodyatt) and Michelle (Collins), and also our director Karl Neilson, who directed the live episode in 2015, plus loads of the crew that I knew, all my worries melted away.\n\n‘There were so many familiar faces who were so welcoming. So, about half an hour in, it was like I’d never been away.’\n\nHer return has more than likely impacted the upcoming departure of Clay Milner Russell as Bobby – and intense filming pictures showed a graveside showdown between him and Cindy.\n\nPrior to this, Jane was last seen in Albert Square back in 2017. She ran away from her home after being confronted by Max Branning (Jake Wood), who had tried to get revenge on just about everyone after time in prison for Lucy’s murder.\n\nAs part of the plot, Max set fire to the local restaurant which very nearly resulted in Jane being killed. When she woke up in hospital, she eventually agreed to a deal with Max that would involve her fleeing Walford and keeping quiet about what he had done.\n\nThis article was originally published on 25th June 2019.\n\nIf you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nJoin the community by leaving a comment below and stay updated on all things soaps on our homepage.\n\nMORE : Major TV star speaks out as 00s fans beg for his return\n\nMORE : Ian confesses to Cindy that he cheated as she hides even dirtier secret in EastEnders\n\nMORE : Who is Masood Ahmed in EastEnders and what is his history with Jane Beale?"
