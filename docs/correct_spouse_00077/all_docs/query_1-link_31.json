        "text": "Every TV show and film presents the opportunity that those performing together could fall for each other.\n\nCupid's arrow can strike when people work closely together.\n\nIt famously happened with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\n\nAnd romance blossomed on the set of EastEnders when the actors who played mechanic Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) and Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman) tied the knot in real life 2006.\n\nThey were involved in a dramatic story line in 2002 when the characters had a drunken one night stand, after which Laura told Garry she was pregnant with his child.\n\nHowever, fans later discovered that the child actually belonged to Laura's husband, the timeless Ian Beale.\n\nBoth Ricky and Hannah first appeared in EastEnders in 2000 and while it is not known when they first became a couple on set, they were engaged in 2005 and got married in 2006.\n\nBut their happily ever after was not meant to be, as the soap couple parted ways less than four years later.\n\nRicky said he was left heartbroken when Hannah told him she had been unfaithful and wanted to end their marriage.\n\nAt the time, Ricky blamed Hannah's decision on an \"obsession\" with her newfound weight loss.\n\nBut Hannah, daughter to actor Dennis Waterman and actress Patricia Maynard, was quick to pour cold water on those claims.\n\nShe previously told the Mirror Online : \"The idea we split up and our marriage broke down just because I lost a couple of stone is ridiculous.\n\n\"There's always going to be more than one reason why a couple splits up, but those reasons are between us. Ricky knows what happened, and so do I.\n\n\"To think I lost weight, I turned horrible, I dumped my husband, is stupid.\"\n\nHannah said she was not suited to married life, which was one of the reasons behind the couple's shock split.\n\nAnd unknown to her then, Hannah was actually battling an underlying health condition, as reported by OK.\n\nâ€˜I was eating tons, and I wasnâ€™t overdoing the exercise â€“ I was training only three times a week. But I just kept losing weight. And if I looked exhausted, well, I was. But I just put it down to stress,\" she's since explained.\n\nHannah was suffering side effects of undiagnosed type 1 diabetes.\n\n\"I wish I had known it at the time â€“ I could have told the world, â€œBack off â€“ Iâ€™m ill,\" she has since said about her diagnosis.\n\nIn the past, Ricky has admitted that it took him a while to be happy again.\n\nHe said: \"It took me a long, long time to get over what happened. It was the lowest I've ever been.\n\n\"It was the clinical way it was done. I wish she had let me down gently but I suppose there is no easy way to leave someone.\"\n\nFor more news and features about London directly to your inbox sign up to our newsletter here.\n\nHannah has since settled down with actor Huw Higginson and they have a son together.\n\nWhile Ricky has since found love, tying the knot with Kay Russell in 2015.\n\nHannah left EastEnders in 2004 when the character of Laura died. In her haste to answer the door to estranged husband Ian, she ran down the stairs and tripped on a toy, breaking her neck as she fell.\n\nRicky Groves made his final appearance as Garry in August 2009 after nearly nine years on the show."
