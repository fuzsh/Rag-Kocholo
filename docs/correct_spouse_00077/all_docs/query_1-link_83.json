        "text": "I think she is a sanctimonious faced cow, whether fat or thin.\n\nShe will probably pile all the weight on a la Natalie Cassidy in 6 months time, sell her story to Closer etc with suitable 'trauma' photos of how she starved herslef to lose the weight. Or summat.\n\nOf course you're right Getorfmoiland! I don't think she'll be giving up the cheese and wine for long.\n\nI did wonder why she wasn't on Stictly Come Dancing at all when Ricky Groves was dancing.\n\nShe needs to get rid of that fringe.\n\nthey are both awful\n\nI didn't like him on Strictly because I thougth he was arrogant - he thought he had the whole cheeky chappy thing all sewn up and the public loved him but it was actually Chris who was the real cheeky chappy\n\nand there is nothing worse than a sanctimous person going on and on about their weight loss, funny how she doesn't act anymore just like Natalie Cassidy, just famous for their weightloss\n\nAnd Natalie cassidy is a size 12 like Dawn french is a size 16. My arse.\n\nTbh, I'd be far more worried if I were Mr hannah Waterman that she's obviously got some weird Daddy thing going on as the husband, is, in effect, Dennis 20 yrs younger. Both got that odd Boris Becker eyelash thing.\n\nShe'll be dancing-on-ice next year. Mark my words.....(or has she already done that?)\n\nI suppose that's why she's got the fringe to cover up her haggard forehead? I agree, nothing much wrong with her figure before, at least nothing that couldn't be sorted by a decent control underwear.\n\nNomdeplume, totally agree with you. DP and I were commenting on how she looked younger before than she does now. My sister who is 41, who doesnt do the whole cleanse, tone, moisturise thing, looks younger than her.\n\nDid have to laugh as the Sunday Mirror claimed she was 24!!! I'll be 24 on Thursday and certainly dont look anywhere near as haggard as she does!\n\nBag of spanners - that is DH's comment on how she looks now!\n\nBut she is rough - it is true that when you get to a certain age you have to choose between a bit of padding and your face still looking nice and being super thin and your face looking boney and haggered!\n\nPass the biscuits then!\n\nYes, the old face versus arse dilemma.\n\nCouldn't see that one coming. A friend met her a couple of months ago on a drunken night out (she was still smoking and drinking then) and apparently not v nice. Told her all about her affair even though she'd never met my friend before.\n\nIs it a coincidence that this story comes to light around the same time as her DVD is released?\n\nShe doesn't look a size 6 now, more like a 10. And on the dvd cover the after picture is very airbrushed and the before picture she looks bigger than a 16.\n\nShe was NAILS on Come Dine With Me at Christmas - I have to say I've never \"taken\" to her, I do remember reading the Rula Lenska had a right old time with her when she was her stepmother - probably tosh, but I choose to believe it...\n\nI like the comment on the DM site that this has always had a \"Z-list storyline attached to it...\" - that this was always the plan - put on the weight, lose the weight, put out the DVD, dump the husband... cynical but perhaps there's a grain of truth in it?\n\nAs she was in the year below me at school (briefly), and I'm 38, I'm not entirely convinced by her claim to be 34. She must have been doing some very clever slow ageing.\n\nOoh I scampered out and bought Closer.\n\nNO WAY is she a size 6 on he front of that DVD. She must have been airbrushed as well as her stomach would never look that flawless, surely however think she got she would have skin sag/tummy cellulite. Christ I have got both and I have never been a size 16"
