        "text": "Appearing as a guest on ITV1’s 'Loose Women', Waterman confirmed the split but said it was “not the case at all” that she ended the three-year marriage because she had shed three stone.\n\n“We’ve been together for 10 years and I think that would be rather superficial,” she added.\n\nWaterman, who is the daughter of 'Minder' actor Dennis Waterman, is currently starring in 'Calendar Girls' in the West End.\n\nYesterday, photographs emerged of the actress apparently walking hand-in-hand in London’s Soho with Bowman, who plays leading man Jean Valjean in 'Les Miserables' nearby.\n\nShe said: “Unfortunately a very good family friend has been dragged into the melee. A lovely actor called Simon Bowman. He’s mates with my dad, plays golf with him.”\n\nWaterman said the pair met up for a drink at the Groucho Club, and added: “We were crossing the road and in a gentlemanly fashion he’s got hold of me, you know, and of course we didn’t leap apart and all this – it’s absolute nonsense.\n\n“He has a fiancée and they are devastated.\n\n“He’s having some personal problems in his family and his family are very upset and I just kind of wanted to underline that he’s a friend.”\n\nWaterman and Groves met when they co-starred in 'EastEnders', where they played Laura Beale and Garry Hobbs.\n\nShe is said to have ended their relationship on New Year’s Day."
