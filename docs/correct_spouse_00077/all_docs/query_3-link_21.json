        "text": "Best known for her part in EastEnders, she has more recently – with his approval – had a role alongside her father in television’s Dirty Tricks as his screen daughter.\n\nHowever, it is perhaps more due to her mother, the actress Patricia Maynard, that Miss Waterman has now turned to repertory, with two parts in the Ian Dickens season at Darlington Civic Theatre.\n\n“I was the only one in the family who hadn’t done rep.\n\nMum did twice-weekly rep for years and I remember her talking about it,” she said.\n\nRepertory has changed over the decades. It used to be the starting point for a career in the theatre, with young actors cutting their teeth on the tough business of performing in one play while learning lines backstage for a different one the following week, honing skills that would last a lifetime.\n\nToday, rep frequently attracts actors who have already made their name on TV, for whom the lure of live theatre has other attractions.\n\nIn Miss Waterman’s case, it was the prospect of two meaty female roles – in this week’s classic comedy Rattle of A Simple Man and in next week’s Killing Time . Both are two-handers, with Miss Waterman playing opposite Huw Higginson, from The Bill.\n\nRichard Stockwell’s modern cat-and-mouse thriller is about what happens when two strangers meet by chance and set in motion a chain of deception.\n\n“Bizarrely, my dad did this play on tour in 1997 with Glynis Barber,” said Miss Waterman, who is expecting her father to see how she tackles the theme when the play is staged in Hampstead.\n\nShe has left her husband, former EastEnders co-star Ricky Groves, looking after their dogs at their home in Cambridgeshire while she tours both plays on the Ian Dickens circuit until August.\n\n“I haven’t any children, so rep is something I can do more easily,” said the actress, who will celebrate her 34th birthday next month while on the road. “I have worked with Huw before and we get on very well, so I was glad he was chosen as the male lead for these plays, which are both very good plays,” she added.\n\nThis year is the tenth anniversary of the summer repertory season at the Civic.\n\nCharles Dyer’s Rattle of A Simple Man continues tonight and tomorrow, followed by Killing Time from Tuesday to Saturday, June 20; Write Me a Murder, a thriller by Frederick Knott, from June 23-27, stars Leslie Grantham (EastEnders), Christopher Villiers (Emmerdale) and Paul Opacic (Bad Girls); Pools Paradise, a farce by Philip King, from June 30-July 4, starring Ben Roberts (The Bill), Frankie Fitzgerald (EastEnders) and David Janson (Keeping Up Appearances) brings the season to a close.\n\nEvening performances start at 7.30pm, Thursday matinees at 2pm. For ticket details and to book, tel 01325- 486555 or visit www.darlingtonarts.co.uk.\n\nCurtains\n\nTHE revived Ed Waugh and Trevor Wood comedy The Revengers at Middlesbrough Theatre, previewed last week, has fallen victim to extended work on the safety curtain, which has forced the theatre to close for the whole of June.\n\nRing the theatre on 01642-815181 for details.\n\nOff to a good start\n\nFRIENDS of the Georgian Theatre Royal, Richmond, helped the summer season off to a flying start when committee members Bev Joicey and Warnock Kerr presented £500 to the chief executive, Vaughn Curtis.\n\nThe money was raised at a performance of Mr Wilkinson of York, by Edward Pearce, about Tate Wilkinson, one of the great men of 18th century theatre.\n\nThe Friends are supporting tomorrow night’s piano recital by Benjamin Frith, From Beethoven to Busoni (via Bizet)."
