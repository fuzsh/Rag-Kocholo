Everyone who knows her is sure she's going to be a great mum.”\n\nHannah is believed to be five months pregnant.\n\nShortly after their split last year, Ricky revealed Hannah had confessed to being unfaithful during their marriage.\n\nHe said: 'I don’t know what’s going on and I don’t know who the other man is. I have no idea and I don’t want to know.\n\n“I feel devastated enough without having a name. I won’t play guessing games and I won’t ask her who he is because that would destroy me.”\n\nHannah – whose father is ‘Minder’ star Dennis Waterman – has previously spoken of her desire to have children with Ricky, saying: “I work to live, not live to work and we did get married for a reason – to have children one day.”"
