        "text": "I have never liked him. He's always come across as an arrogant sod.\n\nHis daughter Hannah has also seemed like a snotty cow and the way she handled the breakup and aftermath with Ricky Groves showed her to be a nasty piece of work in my opinion.\n\nBut he did sing the theme tune to minder....\n\nHis daughters got a face made for radio, mainly cause she looks EXACTLY like him, a bit below the belt but man she ugly. And losing 20 stone only made matters worse. Looking like that and having a bad personality, think her ex found himself a lucky escape.\n\nAs others have said, the honesty card only works when you don’t admit to beating the crap out of your wife, he completely is out of touch with today’s view on this stuff and is now lookign like the fool he is.\n\n0\n\nwhy do people always say men should never hit women? what if the woman is physically strong and is trying to really beat up a man is he supposed to just stand there?\n\nif this dennis guy constantly beat his wife up onb a regular basis thats a different story.\n\nWomen can beat up men - fact. Many men won't walk out as their self esteem is so low and they feel ashamed that they're being beaten by a female, so they keep the abuse to themselves. Quite apart from the fact that most reasonable men feel it's wrong to hit a woman unless their life or the lives of others are in danger. It's pretty rare for a woman to be stronger than a man, unless they're an all in female wrestler married to a 7 stone weakling. Men's genetic make up means they're stronger than women.\n\nMen beating up women, women beating up men, both as bad as each other. Why is it a 'different story' if DW beat RL up regularly? Once a week is wrong, once in a marriage is equally so.\n\n0\n\nRead my post again.\n\nI asked you if you thought it was, so do you?\n\nOf course it's not OK. But the impression that i got from reading what he said in the interview was that he was ashamed of his behaviour, and that he regretted his actions, not that he sought to justify them. The tone seemed reflective and contrite, not arrogant or boastful. It was an acknowledgement, and a very public one at that, of her mental superiority over him, and to cede moral ground in this way indicates remorse.\n\n0\n\nShouldn't there just be one simple blanket rule: it's never OK for anyone to hit anyone? That way, gender politics needn't come into it. Seems pretty straightforward to me: Men and women shouldn't hit each other, adults shouldn't hit children, full stop. So no-one in any relationship has to waste their time thinking about the mechanics of open-handed slaps versus punches, or justifying different \"types\" or \"degrees\" of violence. We only muddy the waters when we try to say that some types of hitting are more acceptable than others.\n\n0\n\nOf course it's not OK. But the impression that i got from reading what he said in the interview was that he was ashamed of his behaviour, and that he regretted his actions, not that he sought to justify them. The tone seemed reflective and contrite, not arrogant or boastful. It was an acknowledgement, and a very public one at that, of her mental superiority over him, and to cede moral ground in this way indicates remorse.\n\nThe thing is, although you're right, he didn't try and justify it, and he did say he was ashamed, it's more the language he used to express that regret. His comment at the end of that article (the one about women having a 'place') negates what he said earlier. I don't think he realises this, or the impact of his own words, but it's clear from that sentence that he still has an extremely questionable mindset when it comes to women and particularly women who challenge him.\n\n0"
