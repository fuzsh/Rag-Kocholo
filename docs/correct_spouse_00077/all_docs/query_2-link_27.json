        "text": "After my rant about January, bloody, January yesterday and exercising, I''m looking for more exercise DVD recommendations.My exercising goes in cycles and this season is the season of ''ignore the treadmill and stay in out of cold and dark pounding around the living room to an exercise DVD''.My personal recommendation is the Elle Macpherson Body Workout - I''ve been doing that for about a decade! Love it - it''s filmed outdoors so feels lovely (kind of). I also do the Davina ones too and have many others that mostly get ignored. I did attempt the ''Billy Blank'' boot camp ones but when The Fella came into the living room and espied the DVD towers and bookcases about to be freed from their wall hooks due to their wobbling (in turn, due to my own wobbling)he attempted to casually enquire whether exercising in the living room to such a DVD, particularly given it''s over our cellar, might cause me to crash through.....So, anyone out there prepared to recommend anything(the very first DVD I ever did, which I think you can still get on VHS was the ''Easy Going Workout'' which used cans of beans and involved sitting in a chair only, but did inspire me!).\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nYears and years ago I used to do the Jane Fonda workout - but then years ago I was actually quite fit! I've tried yoga ones as well but find them really boring - I need to do something which gets me off my backside and doing something energetic.My sister uses an old Beverley Callard one which she says is actually pretty good. I should be doing something right now but instead am sitting here typing and watching the snow falling.\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nThe one to get this year is the Hannah Waterman one, she's gone from a size 16 to a size 6 BUT I read tonight she's split from (Gary) Ricky Groves... perhaps she has her eyes on a toyboy? Apparently the dvd is full of stuff and not cheesy celeb boredom same old same old... high impact, read some reviews on Amazon sounds like it hits the spot and knackers you for the rest of the week. There is some blurb from a University chap too which might be interesting... or might be techno babble.Has anyone got this yet?\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nIn the days before DVD and even before Video players I remember exercising with my mum to a Green Goddess audio tape (about 26 years ago I just worked out, God how depressing is that?)Has anyone got the Wii Fit? Donatela, did I read you say you got it for Christmas? Seeing as the kids have had a Wii for Christmas I wondered if a Wii fit would be any good for me. Lord knows I need something.\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nDH bought me a wii fit for Christmas and this was the week when I was going to start using it. Hm ... no school yesterday, half a day today and who knows about tomorrow!I did it once while the kids were on holidays but having three small children doing it at the same time wasn't ideal. I ended up managing to whack littly as she insisted on standing right alongside me.I was completely useless at the balancing bit and the jogging knackered me. Mind you I suspect I had the board the wrong way round and so when I meant to turn right I was actually going left!!\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nDonatella that is soooo funny !! I have a wii fit and used it everyday for about two weeks, then missed using it for a week, went back on it and it told me off for not exercising lol!!!! It has been firmly under the tv stand since !!!!!I like Davina, but my friends recommended the strictly come dancing one said it was great fun but i think it was difficult to follow to start with.\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nWe have a Wii, but have never got the Wii Fit (Guitar Hero) is about as much exercise as I could muster on that really.And yes, you're right, you do look a total idiot pounding around to DVDs but they do work if you do them a lot!I run when the weather gets warmer but that doesn't feel much better as I'm convinced (in my own little egocentric universe) that everyone passing me has the sun shadowed from their eyes by the size of my rear....\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nThanks for the suggestions - Donatella - the Pussycat Dolls?!?I had to actually snort when I read that! Oh my lord, even the people in the houses at the foot of our garden would be pointing and sxxxxxxing.I did buy a Gaby Logan one for just Â£1.99 in a local supermarket yesterday which I can have a go later.\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nI bought the Camilla from Strictly one yesterday and sat and watched it last night with a glass of wine I liked it - she's quite normal and there was no \"high fives\" or irratating catch phrases. Had a go this morning (with the curtains closed) and managed to get through the warm up and most of the first latin routine before retiring to the couch to catch my breath. Definately felt warmed up afterwards which was a good thing as I try and turn the heating off while the kids are at school to save money. The bad bit was feeling my spare tyre wobbling as I did the moves - Yeuck!Will try and do it when I can't get out for a power walk due to snow, but it was fun even if I didn't manage to go in the same direction as they did al the time.\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nI bought the Hannah Waterman DVD last week. I'm over 40, fat and unfit and this workout is a killer! It's split into 3 x 20 min workouts plus a 15 minute abs and stretches section. I am struggling to manage just one of the 20 min workouts plus the 15 min abs and stretches section. It's based on interval training and works you VERY hard interspersed with just working hard. I would say it's probably aimed at intermediate to advanced exercisers, rather than flabby, unfit beginners like me.If this is indicative of what Hannah Waterman has been doing several times a week for the last few months I can see why she has changed her shape so dramatically. My DS wouldn't believe that the before and after pictures of Hannah on the DVD box were actually the same woman.\n\nEdited 17/02/2021\n\nRexel - I've heard hers is right up there like the Billy Blanks Boot Camp ones! I might build up to that one.I have found an ancient USA one that The Fella's downloaded me which I though would be a breeze (given it looks dated and they're all wearing unitards and headbands - I hasten to add I did not..).Well! That'll teach me - proves that after good old fashioned aerobics, I could barely walk last week.I'm going back to good old fashioned yoga for the first time since Little Sausage came home tonight - maybe that'll be enough!Good luck with Hannah!\n\nEdited 17/02/2021"
