        "text": "Hannah Waterman is pregnant with her first baby after a whirlwind romance with a mystery man.\n\nThe 35-year-old actress is the daughter of TV star Dennis Waterman, and the ex-wife of former Eastenders' actor Ricky Groves.\n\nShe has made no announcement about her pregnancy, but was photographed this weekend with a sizable baby-bump.\n\nThe Sunday Mirror quoted a friend of Hannah's, saying she is 'thrilled' at the prospect of becoming a mum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer EastEnders star Hannah hit the headlines in 2009 after shedding two-and-a-half stone in weight in five months, shrinking from a size 16 to a size 6. She later released a fitness and diet DVD, but subsequently admitted she had lost too much weight.\n\nHer marriage to Ricky Groves fell apart at Christmas, 2009. The Daily Mail reports Mr Groves told them in an interview at the time that Hannah had admitted she had been unfaithful. He said then that he did not know who the man was, and did not want to know.\n\nMiss Waterman has apparently said that she feels that at 35, it is the perfect time to start a family. A source added 'Everyone who knows her is sure she's going to be a great mum.'"
