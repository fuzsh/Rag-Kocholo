        "text": "Shane Ritchie has revealed that his wife Christie is eight months pregnant with his fifth child. Joining him in the Walford baby boom is former EastEnders actress Hannah Waterman, who has also been spotted with a large baby bump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“People see me as Alfie Moon. They would have kept asking me about the cot death storyline and it would have felt strange tagging on the end, ‘Oh and by the way, we’re expecting a baby.’ If people asked me about Christie, I said she’s put on a bit of weight,” said Shane, explaining, as he revealed why he’d kept his wife’s pregnancy a secret.\n\nThere’s also mystery surrounding Hannah Waterman’s surprise pregnancy. The 35-year-old daughter of Dennis Waterman, was once married to co-star Ricky Groves. And is yet to reveal the father of her baby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This may come as a bit of a shock to a lot of people, but Hannah is absolutely thrilled. She feels it’s the perfect time to start a family. Everyone who knows her is sure she is going to be a great mum,” a source told Sunday Mirror."
