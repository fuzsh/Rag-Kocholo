We first met when he played my pervy landlord in EastEnders, but since then we've been in two plays together.\"\n\nSpeaking in April about plans to have children, she said: \"We spoke early on in our relationship about the fact that we'd like a family.\n\n\"I'm 35 and didn't want to wait. But we didn't expect it to happen so quickly.\"\n\nHannah had revealed that the pregnancy probably saved her life, as she recently found out she has diabetes.\n\nShe said: \"I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which was triggered by pregnancy hormones.\n\n\"It's very unusual and can be dangerous, which means this baby will probably be the only child I can have.\n\n\"I was lucky doctors picked up on my problem when they did. Although the pregnancy triggered my diabetes symptoms, I would have developed them at some point. So at least it meant I was diagnosed earlier. It probably saved my life.\""
