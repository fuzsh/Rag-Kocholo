Former EastEnders star Hannah Waterman has dismissed reports linking her to a new man following her split from husband Ricky Groves.

Yesterday, pictures emerged showing Waterman walking hand-in-hand with actor Simon Bowman in London's Soho three weeks before she announced her marriage break-up.

Bowman is currently starring in West End musical Les Miserables while Waterman, daughter of Minder star Dennis, appears in Calendar Girls nearby.

Responding to rumours of a secret relationship, the actress's spokesman told The Sun: "Simon is an old family friend - he is actually an old friend of Dennis's. He has a partner and there is nothing going on. Just because they were holding hands that doesn't mean anything."

Waterman and Groves, best known for playing Walford's Laura Beale and Garry Hobbs, are believed to have separated on New Year's Day following three years of marriage.
