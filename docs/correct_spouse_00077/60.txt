Heartbroken Ricky Groves wants a reconciliation with estranged wife Hannah Waterman, the actor's mum has claimed.

Irene Davies said Strictly Come Dancing star Ricky was "devastated" by the spilt but hinted he hoped he could save the marriage.

Asked about a possible reunion, she said: "Never say never. I just don't know. We support him all the way."

Ricky's Dad Robert, of Clacton, Essex, said: "He's not doing very well" Hannah, 34, split from 41-year-old ex-EastEnders star Ricky four months after hitting the headlines last year for losing three stone.

Ricky, 41, who played mechanic Gary Hobbs in the BBC soap, said: "These things happen and you just need to get on with it."

He married Hannah, daughter of actor Dennis Waterman, in 2006 after they met on the EastEnders set a decade ago.
