Hannah Waterman has split from her husband of three years, Eastenders star Ricky Groves

Okay, so we know this story isn't exactly up there with an A list Hollywood break up, but we've been a little intrigued by Hannah Waterman ever since she reportedly lost three stone in five weeks, so the fact that she's now split up with her husband of three years is a definite twist in the tale - and a very sad one too!

According to the Daily mail, the actress who played Laura Beale in Eastenders called time on her marriage to the guy who most would best recognise as Gary Hobbs on New Year's Day after finding new confidence due to her weight loss.

Ricky, who also appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, is said to be devastated and has spent the last few days drowning his sorrows in his local pub, where a local blabbed to a reporter:

"He's lonely. She just confessed to him one day that it was over. It was completely out of the blue for him, he thought they were happy.

"He said he's going to find it hard to move on. He loved her - no matter what size she was."

Meanwhile, a friend of the couple told the paper:

"Since going from size 16 to size six, Hannah's been treating herself to lots of sexy lingerie and mini-skirts.

"Ricky was delighted, as any red-blooded man would be - but unfortunately Hannah seems to have a new-found confidence with her new figure. She's been turning heads and she knows it."

It sounds like a Eastenders plotline - can someone write a happy ending please?
