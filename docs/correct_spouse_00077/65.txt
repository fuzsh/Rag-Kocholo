Former EastEnders star Hannah Waterman has insisted that her split from husband Ricky Groves was not influenced by her weight loss.

The actress announced earlier this week that she had separated from Groves after three years of marriage.

The development came weeks after Waterman confirmed that she had dropped from a size 16 to a size 6 thanks to a new diet and exercise regime.

However, appearing as a guest on ITV1's Loose Women, the 34-year-old said that it was "not the case at all" that her new image played a part in the break-up.

She added: "We've been together for 10 years and I think that would be rather superficial."

The couple, best known for their respective roles as Walford's Laura Beale and Garry Hobbs, are said to have parted ways on New Year's Day.
