        "text": "UNFINISHED \"NUREMBERG\"\n\nON THE OCCASSION OF THE 90-th ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRIAL OF YOUNG TURKS\n\nThe Young Turks perpetrators\n\nAfter the 1918 Mudros armistice, in order to get rid of the disgraced government of the Young Turks and prevent the possible punitive actions by the victorious Allies, the newly-organized Ahmed Izzet Pasha government, decided to bring the leaders of the Young Turks and the members of the Committee of the Party of âIttihat ve Terakkiâ before court for involving the Ottoman Empire in the war and organizing Armenian massacres.\n\nThe verdict of the Turkish Military\n\nTribunal sentencing to death the Governor\n\nof Trabizon Jemal Azmi Bey\n\nNo 3616\n\nOn 22 May, 1919\n\nThe Journal of âTakvim Vakayiâ\n\nAccording to the decisions of 16 December 1918, Enquiry Commissions were set up (General Chairman former Ankara Governer Mazhar Bey) for the purpose of collecting evidence such as encoded telegraphs, official writings, instructions, orders, as well as eye-witness accounts of the massacres of Armenians.\n\nThe provinces of the Ottoman Empire were divided into ten investigative districts; prosecutors, inquiring judges and secretaries were appointed for each district.\n\nThe copy of the encoded circular letter of 10 July,\n\n1915 affirmed by the commander of the\n\n3-rd army Mahmud Kyamil pasha\n\nThe journal of âTakvim Vakayâ\n\nNo 3540\n\nApril, 1919\n\nA number of ministers of the Young Turksâ Government, party leaders, regional secretaries, attorneys, governors, servicemen and other officials were arrested.\n\nOn 8 January 1918, Military Tribunals of first, second and third instance were established in Istanbul. During the court hearings, investigation was conducted into the criminal actions of the leaders of the Young Turksâ Government; the members of the Central Committee of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party, the regional secretaries and officials, the special organization that had committed the Armenian slaughters called âTeshkilat-Ä± Mahsuse,â as well as the organizers of the deportation and carnage of the Armenians of Yozgat, Trebizond and BÃ¼yÃ¼kdere (a suburb of Constantinople) and Harpoot.\n\nIsmayil Hakki Bey\n\narrested by the British Soldiers\n\nAlthough, under the existing law, the criminals were to be tried in the place where they had committed the crime, on 5 February 1919, the Military Tribunal of Istanbul made a decision to prosecute the accused in Istanbul in its first session on the trial of the perpetrators of the deportations and massacres in Yozgat.\n\nBy a special decree of Sultan Mehmed VI Vahideddin (1918 to 1922), the leaders and ministers of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party were brought before the Military Tribunal of Istanbul. In 1919 Grand Vizier Damad Ferid condemned the criminal plan executed by the Young Turksâ Government.\n\nThe trial of the leaders and ministers of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party began in Istanbul on 27 April 1919 and continued until 26 June (13 sittings) with intervals. During these trials, 11 party-affiliated and high-ranking statesmen were sentenced in absentia, together with other 20 political figures who were present at court. On 28 May, the English Command suddenly exiled 77 prisoners to the island of Malta.\n\nTalaat Pasha and\n\nMinister of Finance Javid Bey\n\nThe first verdict of the Young Turk perpetrators were reached on July 5, 1919. 31 criminals including the former Minister of the Interior Affairs, Grand Vizier and Chairman of the Central Committee of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party Talaat Pasha from 1917 till 1918; former Military Minister Enver Pasha, former Minister of the Marine, Commander of the 4th Turkish army in Syria during World War I and a member of the Central Committee of âTeshkilat-Ä± Mahsuseâ of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party, Jemal Pasha; and former Minister of Public Education, Doctor NazÄ±m were sentenced to death in absentia. Some of the remaining 27 were sentenced to different prison terms, while a small group of accused officials were acquitted because of the lack of evidence. The verdict did not contain a single reference to the criminals who had been banished to Malta from the Turkish prison under the protection of the English Command. Later many of them after returning back from exile, hold different high positions in the Republic of Turkey.\n\nOn 21, 23, 28 June 1919, the trials of the regional secretaries and other officials of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party took place. The verdict was reached on 8 January 1920. Three of the 36 people accused were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, the others to imprisonment of several years.\n\nTalaat Pasha with his friends\n\nin the years of escape, Holland, 1920\n\nYozgat and Governor of Boghazlyan Kemal Bey was sentenced to death. Yozgatâs Police Chief Tefik Bey was sentenced to 15 years of penal servitude. The verdict of the perpetrators of Trebizond massacres was reached on 22 May 1919. Two of the eight criminals, Governor of Trebizond province Jemal Azmi Bey, and Responsible Secretary of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party Naim Bey, were sentenced to death in absentia; the others were sentenced to different years of imprisonment. The verdict of the perpetrators of the Armenian and Greek massacres of BÃ¼yÃ¼kdere was proclaimed on 24 May 1919. All those accused received prison terms of several years. The verdict of the active organizers of the deportation and slaughter of Harpoot Armenians was reached on 13 January 1920. Member of the Central Committee of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party and Chairman of âTeshkilat-Ä± Mahsuseâ Behaeddin Shakir Bey was sentenced to death, and Responsible Secretary of the Party of âIttihat ve Terakkiâ Resneli NazÄ±m Bey was sentenced to 15 years of penal servitude.\n\nEnver Pasha, Talaat Pasha,\n\nHalil Menteshe, Sadrazam Sayid Halil Pasha (on the right side)\n\nThe Treaty of SÃ¨vres signed on August 10, 1920 authorized the Allies to carry out certain steps for punishing the Ottoman criminals convicted of Armenian Genocide. Thus according to the treaty, the Turkish state not only recognized the right of the Allied Rowers to prosecute people charged with the breach of laws and customs of conducting war, but also \"The Turkish Government undertakes to hand over to the Allied Powers the persons whose surrender may be required by the latter as being responsible for the massacres committed during the continuance of the state of war on territory which formed part of the Turkish Empire on August 1, 1914\".\n\nThe decisions and reports of the trials of 1919 to 1920 were published in the appendices of the Turkish official newspaperâTakvim-i Vekayiâ. All the title pages had the following heading: âReport of the Trial of the Military Tribunal made up by His Majesty Sultanâs Imperial Order Dated 8 March 1335 (1919).â\n\nPublications on these trials are also found in the contemporary Armenian and Turkish press.\n\nThe documents (encoded telegraphs and letters) attached to the verdicts attest that Armenian deportations and massacres were not implemented for the security reasons. The documents collected during the court hearings and attached to the verdicts reached prove that the Armenian deportations were aimed at total annihilation of the Armenian population. This plan for aâfinal solutionâ was camed out exceptionally on the initiative of the Central Committee of the âIttihat ve Terakkiâ party with instructions and secret orders received from the centre.\n\nThe trials of the Young Turksâ Government, organized between 1919 and 1920 by the Turkish authorities, are unique evidence proving that the Armenian Genocide was politically organized and commited act.\n\nThese trials and verdicts are important arguments against the denial of the Armenian Genocide by the official Turkish historiography. Most of the convicted former Ottoman officials who were involved in the perpetration of the Armenian mass killings and property expropriation and were sentenced during these trials, later appeared as close associates of Kemal AtatÃ¼rk, holding important positions in the military and political elite of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nThe list of the accused\n\nMEHMED TALAAT PASHA 1847-1921\n\nLeader of the Party of âIttihat ve Terakkiâ\n\nMinister of the Interior Affairs 1913-1917\n\nGrand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire 1917-1918\n\nHe was sentenced to death by the Ottoman Military Tribunal in 1919\n\nHe was shot to death by Soghomon Tehleryan in 1921\n\nISMAIL ENVER PASHA 1881-1922\n\nOne of the organizers of the Armenian Genocide\n\nMember of the Central Committee of the Party of âIttihat ve Terakkiâ\n\nWar Minister in 1914\n\nHe was sentenced to death by the Ottoman Military Tribunal in 1919\n\nHe was sentenced to death in the Central Asia in 1921\n\nJEMAL PASHA 1872-1922\n\nOne of the organizers of the Armenian Genocide\n\nMember of the Central Committee of the Party of âIttihat ve Terakkiâ\n\nMinister of Wavy\n\nCommander of the 4th Turkish army in Syria in 1914\n\nHe was sentenced to death by the Ottoman Military Tribunal in 1919\n\nHe was killed by Artashes Gevorgyan and Petros Ter Poghosyan on July, 1922\n\nDOCTOR NAZIM 1872-1926\n\nMember of \"TeÅkilat-Ä± Mahsusa\" and the Central Committee of the Party of âIttihat ve Terakkiâ\n\nMinister of the Public Education in 1918\n\nHe was sentenced to death by the Ottoman Military Tribunal in 1919\n\nHe was hanged in 1926\n\nBAHADDIN SHAKIR 1877-1922\n\nMember of the Central Committee of the Party of âIttihat ve Terakkiâ\n\nLeader of \"TeÅkilat-Ä± Mahsusa\"\n\nHe was sentenced to death by the Ottoman Military Tribunal in 1920\n\nHe was killed by Arshavir Shirakyan in Rome in December, 1921\n\nHALIL MENTESHE1874-1948\n\nMember of the Party of âIttihat ve Terakkiâ\n\nSpeaker of the Ottoman Mejlis in 1914 -
