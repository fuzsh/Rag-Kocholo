        "text": "Marshal Ahmet İzzet Pasha was born (1864 - 1937) in the town of Naslic which was the part of Görice defend point and that was locally connected to Manastır, His father was Haydar Bey who was the member of well-known families of Albania and a former politicians and also was the son of Timur Bey, parliament member of Naslic. Ahmet İzzet Pasha was very important man in the latest period of Ottoman Empire and Turkish national struggle war, he could get Marshall grade which is the highest grade in military, and took part in many governmental duties, for instance interior and foreign ministries, cabinet member and administrator As it was known, after the second republican movement and its acceptation in Ottoman Empire in 1908, freedom movement had started in Albania. After the Balkan War which was took place in 8 October 1912, Albanians had started to gather in Avlonya in 29 November 1912 and in 14 October 1912 in Üsküp, They wanted from Ottoman Empire at first to keep under protection their national territory but then this demand was changed in the way of taking their freedom from Ottoman Empire. With the chairman İsmail Kemal Bey, a congress was held in Avlonya, 83 congress men took part in, they presented Albanian’s neutrality and independency in 28 November 1912. Albanian’s first temporary government was founded with the accepted prime minister İsmail Kemal Vlora. Finally, after the debates that occurred in London Peace Conference in 17 December 1912, the independency of Albania was accepted as principle. In 29 July 1913 many important governments in Europe had definitely determined on an agreement. According to this agreement, Albania would be free country and also its freedom would be the protected by these six big and important countries such as England, France in Europe. With this sign Ottoman Empire would loss his just to govern Albania. However, at the result of agreement a problem was appeared on the agenda it was he question that who would be the prince for the throne of Albania. Austria and Italy want their candidates would be elected for the throne. At first as it was known, the considered prince was one of the Egypt princes, was Fuat Pasha. In this time, Nâbi Bey who was the Rome Ambassador of Ottoman Empire, had sent a telegraph with the date 13 December 1913 for explaining the situation to the empire about prince election and also Fuat Pasha’s willing, requested instruction about what to do. Noradunkyan Efendi who was the Foreign Minister in Ottoman Empire said that Ottoman Government had thought that an Ottoman prince would suit for the Albanian’s throne and on the other hand an Egypt prince for Macedonia state could be acceptable but however both of these thoughts were very early decisions for the condition, he clarified his thoughts with a telegraph message. For defining the Albania situation, at 29 July 1913 in London, an Ambassadors Conference was held. At the conference, for the Albania’s throne prince Wilhelm Von Wied was put in front as the strongest candidate, this prince was the little brother of Prince  Van Yüzüncü Yıl University, Faculty of Literature, History Department 2 Frederic Von Wied. This candidate was a protestant and also the nephew of Romanian princess. For this reason the king of Romania had demanded from Ottoman not to interrupt his nephew’s candidacy process. Although Ottoman government hadn’t disturb the situation but had a strong want to put either an Ottoman prince or a Muslim politician for the throne. When this process was going on, in some kind of newspapers and auricles Ahmet İzzet Pasha’s name was written down and what is more this kind of news were very natural because he was the member of one of the well known families in Albania, He was a good soldier and also respected, trusted and loved by everyone. In spite of Ottoman Empire denied this news, this offer was made for Ahmet İzzet Pasha by Albanians, lived in Istanbul and by governors of Empire. This situation was accepted on condition by İsmail Kemal Bey and found appropriate by Esat Pasha (Toptani). Spite of Albania’s willing for convincing him to take the throne but he didn’t approve this offer with the fear causing problem for this newly founded country. At Istanbul, in some newspapers many articles were gibing information about the events that taken place in Albania. One of these newspapers which was known as Tasvir-i Efkâr had put both Ahmet İzzet Pasha’s picture and Prince Wilhelm Von Wied’s picture in front and above these pictures an eagle which was holding the crown with its pawn and the header title was very interesting it was written “On whose head will it land?” By the view of statements of Ahmet İzzet Pasha, he even hadn’t thought and hadn’t had that kind of eagerness to be the Albanian’s prince and repeated in his answers that he had no information about what was going on. As thought, as being a well educated and foresighted soldier Ahmet İzzet Pasha didn’t accepted the offer because seeing the pressure of other European countries to misuse this situation and producing problems for Albanian’s future. He also pointed out in his sayings that “ l really don’t want to be one of the reasons that could cause damage to Albania”. Eventually, for the reason of followed mistaken policies of Ottoman Empire’ governments and particularly İttihat Terraki’s governments at the Albanian’s subject, they had had very important responsibility, As we criticizing Balkan wars we have to also put in front Albania’s Question, that subject was important for Ottoman, All together we can say that, Ahmet İzzet Pasha had some kind of personal reasons for not approving the offer to take the throne but however if he had approved it would have been for the use of Ottoman. Who knows, maybe at the Balkan peninsula, a much bigger and stronger Albania existed."
