        "text": "Iacobici, Iosif (b. Dec. 8, 1884, Gyulafehérvár [Alba Iulia], Transylvania, Hungary [now in Romania] - d. March 11, 1952, Aiud, Romania), war minister of Romania (1941). He was also chief of the General Staff (1941-42).\n\nIakovidis, Andreas (I.), English Andreas (J.) Jacovides (b. Dec. 19, 1936, Nicosia, Cyprus), Cypriot diplomat. He was ambassador to the United States (1979-89, 1993-96) and Germany, Austria, and Denmark (1990-92) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1992-93).\n\nIakovos\n\nIakovos, original name Dimitrios (Athanasiou) Koukouzis (b. July 29, 1911, Imroz island, Turkey - d. April 10, 2005, Stamford, Conn.), Greek Orthodox archbishop of America (1959-96). Arriving in the United States in 1939, he was ordained to the priesthood in Lowell, Mass., in 1940 and became a U.S. citizen in 1950. He met with Pope John XXIII after his 1959 enthronement, becoming the first Greek Orthodox archbishop in 350 years to meet with a Roman Catholic prelate, and spent nine years as a president of the World Council of Churches. He marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma, Ala., in 1965 and received the Medal of Freedom from Pres. Jimmy Carter in 1980. During his long tenure as archbishop, Iakovos led the U.S. Greek Orthodox church out of immigrant isolation and into the mainstream of American religious life, playing a leading role in bringing English into the liturgy. He was instrumental in setting up dialogues between Orthodox churches and Anglicans, Lutherans, Southern Baptists, and other denominations. He opposed the Vietnam War, supported Soviet Jews, and sought to aid the cause of Middle East peace. He met every U.S. president from Dwight D. Eisenhower through Bill Clinton. In September 1987, he took part when U.S. Christian leaders of many denominations met with Pope John Paul II in South Carolina. He sought to maintain Orthodox traditions such as opposing the ordination of women, while at the same time championing human rights and improved race relations. He was apparently forced out over his support for the idea of uniting the various Eastern Orthodox branches in a single American church.\n\nIakovou\n\nIakovou, Georgios (Kyriakou), English George Iacovou (b. July 19, 1938, Peristeronopigi village, northern Cyprus), foreign minister of Cyprus (1983-93, 2003-06). He was the runner-up in the 1998 presidential election and was also ambassador to West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (1979-83) and high commissioner to the United Kingdom (2006-07).\n\nIalá\n\nIalá, Kumba, Ialá also spelled Yala, also called (after conversion to Islam in July 2008) Mohamed Ialá Embaló (b. March 15, 1953, Pkon village, near Bula, Portuguese Guinea [now Guinea-Bissau] - d. April 4, 2014, Bissau, Guinea-Bissau), president of Guinea-Bissau (2000-03). He was expelled from the ruling African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) in 1989 for demanding greater democratic reform, at a time when Africa was ringing to the sound of calls for pluralist politics. Ialá ran against military ruler João Bernardo Vieira in 1994, winning 49% of the vote in a very close race. He rejected the result as rigged but opted to sit in parliament. He won the presidency at his second attempt in a rare alternation of power in Africa. The Jan. 16, 2000, runoff and the first round on Nov. 28, 1999, when his Party for Social Renewal emerged from legislative elections as the largest group in parliament, were part of a transition agreed after a 1999 army revolt against Vieira. Ialá won a landslide victory, taking 72% of votes cast. It marked the end of the domination of power by the PAIGC, whose candidate, Malam Bacai Sanhá, won only 28%. But with victory came the problem of how to deal with the army, which had toppled Vieira. Both Vieira and Ansumane Mané, the sacked army chief who led the revolt against him and then headed a military junta, were heroes of the independence war. Ialá represented a new generation of politicians. Before the first round of the election, the army made clear that it wanted a special pact giving the outgoing junta special consultative status after the election. Ialá, as a candidate, rejected the idea out of hand. As president Ialá was initially well-liked and when Mané tried to snatch power in November 2000 he was killed by loyalist troops. But in 2002 Ialá became increasingly autocratic and unpopular, and in 2003 he was overthrown in a remarkably smooth military coup which most Bissauans welcomed. He was placed under house arrest after the coup, but his party designated him on March 26, 2005, as its presidential candidate for the June 19 election. On May 15 he announced that he was reclaiming his position as president with immediate effect. He finished third in the elections and, after initially rejecting the results, eventually gave his support to Vieira, who then won the runoff against Sanhá. In the 2009 elections Ialá placed second and then lost the runoff to Sanhá.\n\nIalomitianu, Gheorghe (b. Sept. 14, 1959, Simon, Bran municipality, Brasov county, Romania), finance minister of Romania (2010-12).\n\nIauko, Anthony, or Anthony Iaris Harry, interior minister of Vanuatu (2023); son of Harry Iauko.\n\nIauko, Harry (Iarris) (d. Dec. 10, 2012, Luganville, Vanuatu), Vanuatu politician. He was minister of lands and natural resources (2010-11) and infrastructure and public utilities (2011, 2011-12).\n\nIbad\n\nIbad (Khan), Ishratul, also spelled Ishrat-ul-Ibad, Ibad also spelled Ebad (b. March 3, 1962, Karachi, Pakistan), governor of Sindh (2002-16).\n\nIbanescu, Nicolae (b. June 2, 1931, Stâncaseni, Vaslui county, Romania), a deputy prime minister of Romania (1987-89). He was also first secretary of the party committee and chairman of the executive committee of Iasi county (1986-87).\n\nIbáñez (Gutiérrez), Adolfo (b. Nov. 28, 1827, Santiago, Chile - d. Aug. 12, 1898, Santiago), foreign minister (1871-75) and interior minister (1890) of Chile. He was also minister to Peru (1871) and the United States (1875) and minister of justice and education (1896).\n\nIbáñez (Ibáñez), Maximiliano (b. April 2, 1868, Linares, Chile - d. Dec. 27, 1933, Santiago, Chile), finance minister (1904) and interior minister (1910-11, 1916, 1925-26) of Chile. He was also minister to France (1918-21).\n\nIbáñez (Nariño), Wenceslao (b. Sept. 28, 1834, Bogotá, New Granada [now Colombia] - d. Oct. 16, 1916, Bogotá), war minister of Colombia (1875, 1879) and president of Cundinamarca (1880-82).\n\nIbáñez Águila, Bernardo (b. July 12, 1902, Antuco, Bío-Bío, Chile - d. Aug. 19, 1983), Chilean politician. He was secretary-general of the Socialist Party (1945-46) and a minor presidential candidate (1946).\n\nC. Ibáñez\n\nIbáñez del Campo, Carlos (b. Nov. 3, 1877, Linares, Chile - d. April 28, 1960, Santiago), president of Chile (1927-31, 1952-58). In 1896 he entered the military. He participated in a revolt in 1924 against the government of Arturo Alessandri Palma and took a prominent part in the coup that recalled Alessandri to office in 1925. Ibáñez in effect controlled Chile in 1925-27 as minister of war and then as minister of the interior under Pres. Emiliano Figueroa Larraín. In 1927 he forced the resignation of Figueroa and took over as president. Backed by the army, he exiled or jailed all opposition. He was able to give the nation a semblance of prosperity, as long as foreign credit was available. He sought to rescue the ailing nitrate industry through the creation of a monopoly corporation, Compañía de Salitre de Chile (Cosach), heavily dependent upon U.S. capital. When Cosach failed and the world depression put an end to the influx of foreign capital, the economy crumbled. His administration was brought to an end by what amounted to a national sit-down strike; in July 1931 he fled across the Andes into exile in Argentina. He returned in May 1937 and in September 1938, with the support of Chilean Nazis, attempted an armed revolt that promptly failed. In August 1939 he led another uprising that was again quickly crushed. He ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1942. In 1948 he was elected senator for Santiago. In 1952, he again ran for the presidency and won the election through an appeal directed to the depressed urban elements and the rural workers. In marked contrast to his earlier dictatorship, he now demonstrated an ability to conciliate opposition, reorganized government departments to promote efficiency, and encouraged industrial growth.\n\nIbáñez Freire, Antonio (b. Sept. 25, 1913, Vitoria, Spain - d. May 9, 2003, Madrid, Spain), interior minister of Spain (1979-80). He was also civil governor of Santander (1960-61), Vizcaya (1961-63), and Barcelona (1963-66), director-general of the Guardia Civil (1976-78), and captain-general of Catalonia (1978-79).\n\nIbáñez Martín, José, conde de Marín (b. Dec. 18, 1896, Valbona, Teruel province, Spain - d. Dec. 21, 1969, Madrid, Spain), Spanish politician. He was education minister (1939-51) and ambassador to Portugal (1958-69).\n\nIbaragi, Ryuta (b. July 29, 1966), governor of Okayama (2012- ).\n\nIbarra (Lozano), Aníbal (b. March 1, 1958, Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires province, Argentina), chief of government of Buenos Aires city (2000-06). He was suspended and ultimately removed from office over allegations that poor government safety regulation contributed to the death of 194 people in a December 2004 nightclub fire.\n\nIbarra, Juan, prime minister of Peru (1892). He was also minister of war and navy (1883 [insurrectionary government of Lizardo Montero], 1891-92, 1895-96) and interior and police (1892).\n\nIbarra Muñoz, Rogelio (b. Aug. 15, 1888, Asunción, Paraguay - d. July 8, 1936, Santiago, Chile), foreign minister of Paraguay (1923-24). He was also minister to Brazil (1924-28, 1933-34), Bolivia (1930-31), Peru (1931-33), and Chile (1934-36).\n\nIbarretxe\n\nIbarretxe (Markuartu), Juan José (b. May 15, 1957, Llodio, Spain), president of the government of País Vasco (1999-2009).\n\nIbárruri\n\nIbárruri (Gómez), (Isidora) Dolores, pseudonym La Pasionaria (Spanish: \"The Passionflower\") (b. Dec. 9, 1895, Gallarta, near Bilbao, Spain - d. Nov. 12, 1989, Madrid), Spanish Communist leader. She was aware of the disparity between her life and that of wealthy mine owners. Becoming radicalized, she published in 1918 an article in a newspaper called El Minero Vizcaino, using for the first time the pseudonym La Pasionaria. Two years later she joined the local Communist Party and served as a delegate (1921) to the national congress that founded the Spanish Communist Party (PCE). She became a member (1930) of PCE's Central Committee. After a turbulent career, in which she was jailed several times for political activities, she emerged as one of the Communist deputies in the Republican parliament and, by the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936, had become a national figure. She earned a legendary reputation as an impassioned orator, coining the Republican battle cry, No pasarán! (\"They shall not pass!\") and making such famous exhortations as \"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees\" (July 19, 1936). With Francisco Franco's victory in 1939 she escaped by plane to the Soviet Union, where she became an ardent supporter of most Soviet policies and over the years represented her party at Kremlin congresses, until Santiago Carrillo succeeded her as secretary-general in 1960; she then became the party's president, a largely honorary post. She returned to Spain on May 13, 1977, 34 days after the Spanish government again legalized the Communist Party. She was reelected to her deputy seat in the Spanish parliament that year but resigned in 1979 because of ill health. She remained honorary president of the PCE until her death.\n\nIbbetson, Sir Denzil Charles Jelf (b. Aug. 30, 1847, Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England - d. Feb. 21, 1908, London, England), chief commissioner of the Central Provinces (1898-99) and lieutenant governor of Punjab (1907-08); knighted 1903.\n\nIbbetson, Robert (b. May 4, 1789 - d. Nov. 4, 1880, Hampshire, England), governor of the Straits Settlements (1830-33).\n\nIbekwe, Dan (Onwura) (b. June 23, 1919, Onitsha [now in Anambra state], Nigeria - d. March 23, 1978), attorney-general and justice minister of Nigeria (1975-76). He was also president of the Federal Court of Appeal (1976-78).\n\nIberville\n\nIberville (et d'Ardillières), Pierre Le Moyne, sieur d' (baptized July 20, 1661, Ville-Marie de Montréal [now Montreal] - d. July 9, 1706, Havana, Cuba), governor of Louisiana (1699). As a young man he took part in raids against English trading posts on Hudson Bay. In 1686 he joined Pierre de Troyes' expedition to the James Bay region, capturing three forts over which he was made commander. Subsequently he distinguished himself in numerous actions against the English, notably at Schenectady, N.Y. (1690), Pemaquid, Maine (1696), and St. John, Newfoundland (1696). His most brilliant foray, the Hudson Bay campaign of 1697, made him, at age 36, New France's most celebrated hero. After the Treaty of Rijswijk (1697) temporarily settled the dispute between the English and the French over Hudson Bay, he was commissioned to fortify the mouth of the Mississippi in order to secure the claim made on Louisiana by René Robert Cavelier, sieur de La Salle. In January 1699 he explored the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, rediscovering the mouth of the Mississippi. Later he established a temporary fort, Fort Maurepas, on Biloxi Bay (now Ocean Springs, Miss.) and then sailed for France. The following year he returned and established a second fort, Fort La Boulaye, just below present-day New Orleans and in 1702 constructed a new post, Fort Louis, on the Mobile River. In subsequent years the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14) turned Iberville's attention toward the English, hampering his plans to develop Louisiana. In early 1706, commanding a French fleet in the West Indies, he sacked the islands of Nevis and St. Christopher. On the eve of a major expedition against the English in Carolina, he died suddenly.\n\nIbiam, Akanu, also known as (Sir) Francis Ibiam (b. Nov. 29, 1906, Unwana [now in Ebonyi state], Nigeria - d. July 1, 1995), governor of Eastern region, Nigeria (1960-66). He was baptized in 1919 and given the name Francis. In 1951 he was knighted. In 1967 he dropped his English name and renounced the knighthood, protesting against Britain's supply of military equipment to Nigeria during the Biafra secession.\n\nIbiapaba, Joaquim da Cunha Freire, barão de (b. Oct. 18, 1827, Caucaia, Ceará, Brazil - d. Oct. 13, 1907, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), acting president of Ceará (1869, 1870-71, 1871, 1872, 1872, 1873, 1874). He was made baron in 1874.\n\nIbingira, Grace (Stuart K.) (b. May 23, 1932, Uganda - d. December 1995), Ugandan politician. He was justice minister (1962-64), minister of state (1964-66), permanent representative to the United Nations (1971-74), and information minister (1979-80).\n\nIbituruna, João Baptista dos Santos, barão e visconde de (b. June 14, 1828, São João del Rei, Minas Gerais, Brazil - d. Jan. 11, 1911, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), president of Minas Gerais (1889).

Reports that he died on Nov. 11, 2005, were later contradicted. By that time he was the \"single most significant regime figure\" still at large after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. He was blamed for coordinating some of the attacks on U.S.-led forces and a $10 million reward was offered for his capture. In an audio message broadcast on al-Jazeera in March 2006, he urged the Arab League summit meeting in Khartoum to recognize \"the Iraqi resistance as the sole legitimate representative of the Iraqi people\" and to \"boycott the regime of agents and traitors.\" He was reportedly killed in an operation by Iraqi security forces and Shia militia members on April 17, 2015, but this was apparently contradicted by the release of a new audiotape in May in which he commented on recent events.\n\nIbrahim, Alhaji Sir (Shettima) Kashim (b.

He was minister of education (1965-70) and information and culture (1970-77) and then a presidential adviser before becoming foreign minister (1982-88). Moderate and Islamist-minded, he was widely respected by Islamists as the son of Bachir Ibrahimi who founded the Muslim Scholars Association between 1932 and 1964 to promote moderate political Islam and the Arabic language. As presidential candidate in 1999, he favoured dialogue with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), pledging an amnesty for jailed FIS members if he won the presidency.\n\nIbrahimi, Bedredin (b.

Jan. 1, 1944, Kemin district, Kirgiz S.S.R. - d. April 4, 1999), prime minister of Kyrgyzstan (1998-99). A member of the Central Committee of the Kirgiz S.S.R. Communist Party from 1988 to 1991, Ibraimov became the mayor of the capital, Bishkek, in 1993, but retired in 1995 when his health became a concern. He continued to act as a state secretary and an advisor to Pres. Askar Akayev until December 1997 when he was unexpectedly appointed chairman of the State Property Fund. One year later he was a surprise choice to replace Kubanychbek Jumaliyev as prime minister when the latter was sacked by Akayev after less than one year in the post. Jumaliyev was dismissed for his government's failure in dealing with the growing fallout from the Russian financial crisis. Ibraimov was never seen as more than a transitional figure. During his short period in office, Kyrgyzstan's economy continued to suffer from the effects of the Russian financial crisis. The national currency, which had rebounded from a low of 35 som to one dollar in November 1998 to just under 30 to one dollar at year's end began to fall again in late February 1999. Other complications were caused by Kyrgyzstan's neighbours, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan's decision in February to raise by 200% tariff rates on some goods from Kyrgyzstan had a heavy impact on the Kyrgyz economy. Equally distressing for Kyrgyzstan were interruptions in supplies of natural gas from Uzbekistan which occurred in February and March. Additionally, a dispute over borders has arisen between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan since mid-February. Some deputies in the Kyrgyz parliament claimed Uzbekistan had moved its border into Kyrgyz territory and established new fortified border posts is these areas. He died in office.\n\nIbraimov, Memet (Ibraimovich), chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Crimean A.S.S.R. (1937-42).\n\nIbraimov, Sultan (Ibraimovich) (b.

A progressive Republican, Ickes supported Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign in 1932 and after Roosevelt's election was made secretary of the interior. He became one of the most energetic and dedicated New Dealers in Washington and a lifelong supporter of the president. In his new post he fought for the preservation of natural resources against exploitation by private interests. Ickes won a wider reputation as head (1933-39) of the Public Works Administration (PWA). He spent money so carefully that many of his projects were slow getting under way, thereby failing to stimulate the depressed national economy as early as desired, but his numerous PWA contracts were virtually graft-proof. One of his most valuable services to consumers was in establishing \"yardsticks\" for electric-power rates through federal and municipal power projects. With the entrance of the U.S. into World War II, his duties were further increased; he became, for instance, petroleum administrator in 1942. During presidential campaigns, he became known as \"Roosevelt's hatchet man\" because of his colourful attacks upon Republican candidates; between campaigns he feuded with almost equal vigour with several of his Democratic colleagues, and his trenchant opinions of many others were recorded in his lively diary, published posthumously (The Secret Diary of Harold L. Ickes, 3 vol., 1953-54). He resigned in 1946 on the ground that he could not support certain men selected by Pres. Harry S. Truman for inclusion in the administration.\n\nIckonga, Auxence (b.

Under the joint appointment of the U.S., Britain, and Germany, he became chief justice. From 1900 to 1906 he served in various official capacities in the Philippines, including as secretary of finance and justice (1901-08), vice governor, and governor-general.

In 1909 he was appointed U.S. envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Spain, where he remained until August 1913.\n\nIde Anak Agung Gde Agung (b.

Muhammadu Buhari who seized power from Nigeria's last elected civilian government on the eve of 1984. The feared military number two exerted a strong influence on the government and became the public face of the draconian regime which enacted the dreaded Decree Two, allowing indefinite detention without trial, and applied the death penalty on drug traffickers. After their regime was overthrown by Gen. Ibrahim Babangida in August 1985, Idiagbon retired to his hometown following his release from detention. He never gave interviews and made very rare public appearances.\n\nIdiáquez (Cruz), Ismael de (b. 1858, Lima, Peru - d. 19...), finance minister of Peru (1919).\n\nIdiarte Borda (Soumastre), Juan (Bautista) (b.

May 25, 1983, Cairo, Egypt), king of Libya (1951-69). The grandson of the founder of the Sanusiya, an Islamic tariqa, or brotherhood, centred in Cyrenaica, Idris was destined to succeed his father as its leader. But because he was a minor when his father died in 1902, leadership first passed to his cousin, Ahmad al-Sharif. Replacing Ahmad in 1916, his first problem was to deal with the Italians, who in 1911 had invaded Libya. Idris ultimately went into exile in Egypt, where he remained until British forces occupied Libya in 1942 during World War II. He continued to direct his followers from Egypt, not returning permanently until 1947, when he could head an official government. Conservative tribesmen thought in terms of a Sanusi government ruling over Cyrenaica, but younger and more urbanized elements looked to a union of the Libyan provinces. The issue was finally determined by the United Nations in November 1949, when the General Assembly resolved that the future of Cyrenaica, Fezzan, and Tripolitania should be decided upon by representatives of the three areas meeting in a national assembly. This assembly established a constitutional monarchy and offered the throne to Idris. Libya declared its independence in December 1951. Many of the younger army officers and members of the growing urban middle class resented his socially conservative policies and his aloofness from the growing currents of Arab nationalism. In September 1969, while Idris was in Turkey for medical treatment, the army, led by Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi, overthrew his government. He went first to Greece and then was given political asylum in Egypt. In 1974 he was tried in absentia on charges of corruption and found guilty. He remained in exile in Cairo until his death.\n\nIdris, (Alhaji) Ibrahim (b. April 6, 1949, Onitsha, Nigeria), governor of Kogi (2003-08, 2008-12).\n\nN. Idris\n\nIdris, (Mohammed) Nasir (b.

March 14, 2013, Phnom Penh, Cambodia), deputy prime minister (1975-79) and foreign minister (1976-79) of Cambodia. He was sentenced to death in absentia in August 1979, eight months after the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge regime. The Khmer Rouge carried on fighting a guerrilla war from the jungle after their ouster; when they were confined to a dwindling number of strongholds, mostly in border areas, Ieng Sary became the first member of the inner circle to defect. In August 1996, he seized control of thousands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the gem-rich area they controlled along the Thai border. A month later, at the request of Prime Minister Hun Sen, King Norodom Sihanouk rewarded Ieng Sary with an amnesty for breaking away from his comrades-in-arms. The amnesty lifted the death sentence against Ieng Sary and granted him immunity from prosecution under a 1994 law outlawing the Khmer Rouge. He was, however, arrested in November 2007 to be tried before a UN-backed genocide tribunal. The trial started in June 2011 but he died during its course.\n\nIeng Thirith, née Khieu Thirith (b.

He was also prefect of Cajamarca (1865-68, 1872-73).\n\nIglesias, Pablo, byname of Paulino Iglesias Posse (b. Oct. 18, 1850, El Ferrol, Spain - d. Dec. 9, 1925, Madrid, Spain), Spanish political leader. President of the printers' union from 1874, he founded the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in May 1879 and became its secretary and, from 1888, president. In 1882 he organized the first strike in Spain after the 1875 restoration of the monarchy. In 1886 El Socialista, the Socialist newspaper, was founded, with Iglesias as editor. He also headed the Socialist-affiliated General Union of Workers (UGT), organized in 1888. He guided the PSOE on a disciplined, austere, and evolutionary course, building up the organizations and educating the working class. He suffered imprisonment for his activity on several occasions between 1882 and 1909. Although for many years he scorned alliance with non-working-class parties, he believed in parliamentary and municipal political action. He was one of the first Socialists elected to the Madrid Municipal Council (1905) and to the Cortes, the Spanish parliament (1910), though the PSOE never surpassed 7 seats before his death. He opposed the more radical practice of pro-Bolshevik forces; in 1921 he helped prevent the PSOE from joining the Third International.\n\nIglesias (Turrión), Pablo (Manuel) (b. Oct. 17, 1978, Madrid, Spain), Spanish politician. In 2011 the ponytailed political science professor (not coincidentally named like the 19th-century father of Spanish socialism) became a key member of the 15-M movement, which took to the streets of 58 Spanish cities on May 15, 2011, to demand an end to rising unemployment, spending cuts, and home repossessions. By the end of that year, the right-wing Popular Party replaced a hopelessly adrift Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in government. Rather than listen to the demands of the estimated 6.5 million people who had taken part in 15-M demonstrations, the PP did the opposite, making savage cuts to health and education as well as other public services. Home repossession soared, a particular sore point since the Spanish banks that were calling in loans had been bailed out to the tune of 41.3 billion of European taxpayers' money. Unemployment rose to more than 26%. It was in this atmosphere that Iglesias founded Podemos (\"We Can\") at the start of 2014. It had no money and no big financial backers - but it did have the brilliantly organized Iglesias. Within months, the party won almost 8% of the national vote in European elections. Iglesias and four of his colleagues were elected to the European Parliament. Iglesias eschewed traditional politics; his party made announcements using the WhatsApp messaging app, and his rallies started with the theme from Ghostbusters, followed by the chant of \"Sí, se puede\" - \"yes, we can.\" In 2015 Podemos took a fifth of the vote in parliamentary elections, blowing apart the cosy arrangement that had existed in Spain since the return to democracy in the late 1970s, which had allowed the PP and PSOE to alternate in power. In 2020 he joined a PSOE-led coalition government as second deputy prime minister and minister of social rights. He resigned in 2021 to run in Madrid regional elections; after a disappointing result, he left politics.\n\nRoberto Iglesias\n\nIglesias (Gil), Roberto (Raúl) (b. 1951), governor of Mendoza (1999-2003).\n\nIglesias (Rodríguez), Teófilo (A.)

[1943-46]) before becoming minister of state security in 1951. As such he was responsible for investigating the so-called \"Doctors' Plot.\" As Nikita Khrushchev revealed at the 20th Communist Party Congress in 1956, Ignatyev had been ordered to obtain confessions from a group of Kremlin doctors, most of whom were Jews, under threats from Stalin that his own life would be taken if he failed. The doctors were alleged to have murdered Stalin's henchman Andrey Zhdanov in 1948 and to have tried to destroy the health of other leading figures. Two of the doctors died during interrogation and the others were released soon after Stalin's death when, as Khrushchev later confirmed, it was accepted that the case had been \"fabricated from beginning to end.\" Ignatyev himself, who was reported to have suffered a heart attack, lost his post immediately after Stalin's death (March 1953) when Lavrenty Beria became head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with which the Ministry of State Security was merged. He was made a secretary of the Central Committee, but was removed already in April 1953 for having shown \"political blindness and gullibility\" in the doctors case. Rehabilitated by Khrushchev, he became party chief in the Bashkir republic again in 1953 and was shifted to the adjoining Tatar republic in 1957, which he led until his retirement in 1960.

Ikeda played a leading role in peace treaty negotiations with the United States. He was finance minister another time (1956-57) and also minister of international trade and industry (1950, 1952, 1959-60) and minister without portfolio (1958). He also served terms as secretary-general (1954) of the Liberal Party (subsequently Liberal-Democratic Party) and as chairman of the party's political affairs research committee. When Nobusuke Kishi resigned in July 1960, Ikeda became president of the party and began his four years as prime minister. With the stated goal of doubling Japan's national income in 10 years, he launched a high-rate economic-growth policy based on expanded public-sector spending, reduced taxes, and efforts to keep both inflation and interest rates low. He made determined efforts to break down trade barriers to Japanese goods in foreign markets. He maintained a lower profile in foreign affairs. While continuing to cultivate close relations with the U.S. on economic and security matters, he did favour expanding trade ties with the Soviet Union and China. Ill health forced him to resign in November 1964.\n\nIkeda, Shigeaki, also known as Seihin Ikeda (b. Aug. 15, 1867, Yonezawa [now in Yamagata prefecture], Japan - d.

March 3, 1930, Oltenita, southeastern Romania), president of Romania (1990-96, 2000-04). He joined the Union of Communist Youth (UCY) at the age of 14 and the Communist Party in 1953 and held positions of increasing prestige through the following decade. He was among several protégés of Nicolae Ceausescu who benefited from their mentor's election as party general secretary in 1965, and he continued to enjoy favour as Ceausescu consolidated his authority into a dictatorship. In 1967-71 he was first secretary of the UCY and minister of youth problems. Ironically, Iliescu's popularity among students may have been his undoing. In 1971 the president divested him of all positions except his membership on the Central Committee, which he had obtained in 1968, and launched him on a career of remote assignments, frequent transfers, and decreasing responsibility. In 1984 he was expelled from the Central Committee. Upon Ceausescu's doomed flight from power on Dec. 22, 1989, Iliescu emerged from the shadows to head an interim government largely comprising disaffected former Communist officials. After the apparently spontaneous uprising that drove Ceausescu to an ignominious death, allegations circulated that a coup had been in the planning for several months, with Iliescu as president-designate. Despite promises of broad democratic reforms, charges of complicity with the ousted regime were widespread. After years of total suppression, however, the opposition was ill-equipped to mount a serious challenge. On May 20, 1990, Romania's first open elections in more than 50 years confirmed Iliescu as president. Political unrest continued and, in the most violent episode, some 7,000 miners were transported to the capital in June to suppress a popular protest by force. In 1992 he founded what would become the Social Democratic Party. Reelected under a new constitution in 1992, he lost the 1996 election to Emil Constantinescu but was returned in 2000. He withdrew from his party roles, including as honorary president, in 2010. In 2019 he was charged with crimes against humanity over his role in the 1989 revolution, during which 862 people were killed.\n\nIliev, Ivan (Stoyanov) (b. Jan. 24, 1925, Oreshets, Bulgaria - d.

Hipólito Irigoyen was overthrown in a 1930 military coup.

From 1940 to 1943 he served as vice-governor of Córdoba. In 1948, during the reign of Juan Perón, Illia, one of the rare non-Peronists, was elected to the National Assembly. He used his seat to speak out against Perón's dictatorship, and even though he lost his seat in the 1952 election, he had gained a national reputation for daring to oppose Perón. In 1962 he was elected governor of Córdoba, only to have the election annulled. In 1963 he was chosen by the People's Radical Civic Party as their presidential candidate. Illia's defeat of Oscar Alende marked a return to a constitutional government. For the first time for many years, the state of siege was lifted. He ended foreign control of Argentina's oil industry, but his administration was weakened by the Peronist General Confederation of Labour, the scarcity of beef after a two-year drought, and the drop in oil production during negotiations with the U.S. over the petroleum companies. There was continuing turbulence and threats of intervention by the armed forces. In October 1964, when Gen. Charles de Gaulle was in Argentina during his tour of South America, he had to abandon a speech he was making halfway because of shouts of \"Perón\" by demonstrators. Later that year, Perón himself made an unsuccessful attempt to return from his Spanish exile.

Aug. 4, 1947, Pine Ridge, Grand Bahama island, Bahamas), prime minister of The Bahamas (1992-2002, 2007-12). Once the political protégé of Prime Minister Sir Lynden Pindling, who named him minister of housing and national insurance in 1982, he was dismissed from the cabinet and the ruling Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) in 1984 for accusing his former mentor and fellow party leaders of corruption. Reelected as an independent in the 1987 election, he joined the Free National Movement (FNM) in April 1990 and succeeded to its leadership on the death of Sir Cecil Wallace-Whitfield in May 1990. In the 1992 election, the FNM won 31 of the 49 seats in the House of Assembly, defeating Pindling, who ruled since 1967 and had long been accused of enriching himself by allowing Colombian drug dealers to use The Bahamas for drug-trafficking purposes. Ingraham profited from a strategic mistake by Sir Lynden, who scheduled the election during the summer, when many Bahamian young people were home from college. To many older voters, Sir Lynden was the father of his country, but many first-time voters apparently supported Ingraham as the leader better able to revive the ailing tourist trade and thereby provide more jobs. For the better part of a decade, officials of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had complained about Bahamian involvement in the international drug trade. Immediately following his swearing in, Ingraham predicted that his country's relations with the U.S. \"can only get warmer,\" but he rejected any notion that his government would extradite Sir Lynden or any other member of the defeated PLP to the U.S. to face drug-trafficking charges. He led his party to an even greater victory in 1997, then stepped down as party leader just before the 2002 election, which the party lost, but he was again elected leader in 2005 and returned the party to power in 2007. When it was defeated again in the 2012 election, he quit politics.\n\nIngstad\n\nIngstad, Helge (Marcus) (b. Dec. 30, 1899, Meråker, Norway - d.
