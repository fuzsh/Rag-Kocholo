        "text": "This article is designated as vetted, meaning that it is up-to-date and accurate. Please ask before making changes.\n\nMustafa Kemal Pasha (Ottoman Turkish: مصطفى كمال پاشا), often called the \"Defender of Gelibolu\", the \"Lion of Antep\" and the \"Ghazi of Maraş\", is a Turkish field marshal, statesman and two-time Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire; the first time between 1926 and 1931, and for the second time since 1935. A distinguished army leader during the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915 and the Syrian Campaign in the late stages of the Weltkrieg who managed to avoid a total defeat at the hands of the British during the \"Miracle of Maraş\" in the autumn of 1918, Mustafa Kemal Pasha is one of the most highly respected statesmen throughout the Empire.\n\nAs the long-time chairman of the Ottoman People's Party (OPP), Mustafa Kemal Pasha is widely known as a proponent of Turkish nationalism, secularism, populism and centralism, therefore alienating ethnic minorities, traditionalists, rich elites and federalists alike. With political enemies on all sides, only the future will show if his dream of westernization and modernization in the Orient will endure.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nMustafa Kemal Pasha was born under the name of Ali Rıza oğlu Mustafa in the early months of 1881 in Salonica, Ottoman Empire, to Ali Rıza Efendi, a militia officer, title deed clerk and lumber trader, and Zübeyde Hanım. His family was of Muslim, Turkish-speaking and precariously middle-class origins.\n\nIn his early years, his mother encouraged Kemal Pasha to attend a religious school, something he did reluctantly and only briefly. Later, he attended a private school with a more secular curriculum at the direction of his father. His parents wanted him to learn a trade, but Kemal Pasha instead took the entrance exam for the Salonica Military School in 1893. In 1896, he enrolled in the Monastir Military High School and on 14 March 1899, he enrolled at the Ottoman Military Academy in Constantinople, degreeing in 1902. He later graduated from the Ottoman Military College in Constantinople on 11 January 1905 as well.\n\nMilitary career[]\n\nShortly after graduation, he was arrested by the police for \"anti-monarchist activities\". Following confinement for several months he was released only with the support of his former school director. After his release, Kemal Pasha was assigned as a Staff Captain to the Fifth Army in Damascus. There, he joined a small secret revolutionary society of reformist officers called Vatan ve Hürriyet (\"Motherland and Liberty\").\n\nIn 1907, he was promoted to the rank of Senior Captain (Kolağası) and assigned to the headquarters of the Third Army in Manastır. There, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), better known as the Young Turk Party. On 22 June 1908, he was appointed the Inspector of the Ottoman Railways in Eastern Rumelia. A mere month later, he played a role in the Young Turk Revolution which seized power from Sultan Abdülhamid II and restored the constitutional monarchy after decades of dictatorship.\n\nKemal was a proponent of depoliticization efforts in the army, a suggestion which was disliked & rejected by the leaders of the CUP. As a result, he was sent away to Tripolitania Vilayet under the pretext of suppressing a tribal rebellion towards the end of 1908, only returning to Constantinople in January 1909.\n\nWhen a group of soldiers in Constantinople started a a counter-revolution in April 1909, Kemal Pasha was instrumental in suppressing the revolt. In 1910, he was sent to the Ottoman Albanian Provinces to negotiate with local freedom fighters. Later that year, he was among the Ottoman military observers who attended the Picardie army manoeuvres in France, and in 1911, he served at the Ministry of War in Constantinople for a short time.\n\nItalo-Turkish War and Balkan Wars[]\n\nIn 1911, he volunteered to fight in the Italo-Turkish War in the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet. His forces managed to repel the Italians on a number of occasions, such as at the Battle of Tobruk on 22 December 1911. During the Battle of Derna on 16–17 January 1912, Kemal Pasha was wounded during an Italian bombing: A limestone splinter from a damaged building's rubble struck his left eye, causing permanent tissue damage, but not total loss of sight.\n\nOn 6 March 1912, Kemal Pasha became the Commander of the Ottoman forces in Derna. He managed to defend and retain the city and its surrounding region until the end of the Italo-Turkish War on 18 October 1912. After that, all Ottoman military commanders in Libya had to return to Ottoman Europe following the outbreak of the Balkan Wars.\n\nOn 1 December 1912, Kemal Pasha arrived at his new headquarters on the Gallipoli peninsula and, during the First Balkan War, he took part in the amphibious landing at Bulair on the coast of Thrace, but this offensive was repulsed during the Battle of Bulair by Bulgarian forces under Georgi Todorov.\n\nIn June 1913, during the Second Balkan War, he took part in the Ottoman Army forces that recovered Dimetoka and Edirne together with most of eastern Thrace from the Bulgarians. The same year, he was appointed the Ottoman military attaché to all Balkan states in Sofia and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonelon 1 March 1914.\n\nWhile in Bulgaria, he met with Dimitrina Kovacheva, the daughter of Bulgarian general Stiliyan Kovachev (against whose forces he had fought during the Balkan Wars), who had recently completed her education in Switzerland, during a New Year's Eve ball in Sofia and fell in love with her. The two danced at the ball and started to secretly date in the following days. Kemal Pasha twice asked Dimitrina's parents for their permission to marry her - and was twice refused.\n\nEarly stages of the Weltkrieg[]\n\nIn 1915, Kemal Pasha was given the task of organizing and commanding the 19th Division attached to the Fifth Army during the Battle of Gallipoli. He became the front-line commander after correctly anticipating where the Allies would attack, and held his position until they retreated. Following the Battle of Gallipoli, he served in Edirne until 14 January 1916. He was then assigned to the command of the XVI Corps of the Second Army and sent to the Caucasus Campaign after the massive Russian offensive had reached key Anatolian cities. On 7 August, he rallied his troops and mounted a counteroffensive. Two of his divisions captured Bitlis and Muş, upsetting the calculations of the Russian Command.\n\nFollowing this victory, the CUP government in Constantinople proposed to establish a new army in Hejaz and appoint Kemal Pasha to its command, but he refused the proposal and this army was never established. Instead, on 7 March 1917, Kemal Pasha was promoted from the command of the XVI Corps to the overall command of the Second Army, although the Czar's armies were soon withdrawn when the Russian Revolution erupted.\n\nIn July 1917, he was appointed to the command of the Seventh Army, which was under the command of the German general Erich von Falkenhayn's Yildirim Army Group. Kemal Pasha did not get along well with General von Falkenhayn and wrote a report to Grand Vizier Talaat Pasha regarding the grim situation and lack of adequate resources in the Palestinian front. However, Talaat Pasha ignored their observations and refused their suggestion to form a stronger defensive line to the north, in Ottoman Syria, with Turks instead of Germans in command.\n\nFollowing the rejection of his report, Kemal Pasha resigned from the Seventh Army and returned to Constantinople. There, he was assigned with the task of accompanying the crown prince Mehmed Vahideddin during his train trip to Austria-Hungary and Germany. While in Germany, Kemal Pasha visited the German lines on the Western Front and personally talked with Kaiser Wilhelm II and Erich Ludendorff. During the return trip, he briefly stayed in Karlsbad and Vienna for medical treatment.\n\nWhen Mehmed VI became the new Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in July 1918, he called Kemal Pasha to Constantinople, and in August 1918, assigned him again to the command of the Seventh Army in Palestine.\n\nLater stages of the Weltkrieg[]\n\nKemal Pasha arrived at his headquarters in Nablus, Palestine, in early September 1918. The Seventh Army was holding the central sector of the front lines. On 19 September, the Battle of Megiddo would begin, one of the most destructive defeats in Ottoman history. The Ottoman flanks quickly fell apart; Otto Liman von Sanders, commander-in-chief of all Ottoman troops in Palestine, ordered Kemal Pasha to retreat north and defend the city of Aleppo; However, he disobeyed his superior and instead retreated further north into the Tarsus Mountains.\n\nIn October, the Entente attacked again, this time near Antep, and the Seventh Army had to retreat again. However, shortly after, with fresh reinforcements from the Caucasus and in an all or nothing last stand, the forces of Allenby were firmly halted near the city of Maraş, an event which would later be known as the Miracle at Maraş and became the turning point of both the war and the Ottoman Empire in general.\n\nAs further attempts by the weakened forces of Allenby were incapable of executing another full assault, the Entente troops eventually retreated back to their formations prior to the Megiddo Offensive, where no real progress was made until the signing of Armistice in August 1919. Kemal Pasha was celebrated for saving the Ottoman Empire in its darkest hour and was consequently called to Constantinople in late 1918, where he was greeted and awarded by the Sultan himself.\n\nThe death of Mehmed V, a puppet of the CUP, and the ascension to the throne of Mehmed VI in July of 1918 had changed the political life in the Ottoman Empire drastically. Seeing the collapse of his empire on almost all fronts, and with the CUP government held responsible for the disaster, Mehmed VI would lash out and attempt to shift power to his allies in the liberal FAP (Freedom and Accord Party), which had been supressed by the CUP since 1913. Turmoil and anti-German sentiment was boiling throughout the Empire; The CUP, which heavily relied on German diplomatic legitimization, therefore felt the ground heating up under their feet. Already by 1917, Kemal Pasha had lost his faith into the CUP leadership, and therefore supported the course of the Sultan, while officially remaining member of his party. The cabinet was eventually forced to resign and concede to the Sultan. Ahmet Tefvik Pasha was appointed the next Grand Vizier.\n\nTefvik Pasha hoped connect both the FAP, which enjoyed the preference of the Sultan, and the powerful CUP, which governed all institutes bar the palace. However, negotiations failed and Tefvik Pasha was replaced with Ahmed Izzet Pasha and a government consisting of several high-ranking CUP members. Kemal Pasha, enraged, protested in front of the Sultan, who then decided that Izzet Pasha had to give up the war ministry in favor of Kemal Pasha himself, which reduced CUP and therefore German influence on the military and introduced Kemal Pasha into the Ottoman government for the first time.\n\nMinister of War and rise to the top[]\n\nThe last months of the war were not really in favor of the Ottomans. Allenby's offensive had been repelled, but the British still occupied Mesopotamia, Hejaz and most of Palestine, unwilling to back down. The Treaty of Versailles in November 1919 and the subsequent end of the war brought relief to Constantinople, as it demanded immediate withdrawal of all remaining Entente forces from the territory of the Central Powers. However, the Brits refused to withdraw until an adequate solution for the \"Middle Eastern Question\" had been found. Eventually, under mediation of the Germans and Austrians, the Jerusalem Accords were reached in April 1920, wherein two autonomous regions in Palestine and the Vilayet of Basra were established, governed by an International Council consisting of the German Empire, British Empire, Austrian Empire, United States of America and the Ottomans themselves. This angered the Turkish leadership, which had been backstabbed by their own opportunistic allies, immensely, and only strengthened Kemal Pasha's dislike for the Germans.\n\nHowever, after the accord, the Ottomans finally were able to push further south into Hejaz and managed to repel the rebelling Hashemites, who now were diplomatically isolated and without British support. Kemal Pasha was put in charge of the army for the last time and was present when Ottoman troops triumphantly marched into the holy city of Mekka. The Sharifian supporters were captured and later executed or fled into exile, and Ali Haidar Pasha was installed as the new legitimate Sharif.\n\nNow, by the Summer of 1920, the war was finally over, and the Ottomans stood more or less victorious - At a very high cost. Many citizens deemed the CUP leadership as the ones responsible for this disaster and called for punishment. The CUP therefore changed its name to Teceddüt and openly ousted some of the dictatorial figures within: Djemal Pasha was expelled and later assassinated and Talaat's influence was greatly reduced - Both would be later assassinated by Armenians. Additionally, a substantial anti-German faction formed, based on the German betrayal in Palestine and at the Caucasus Conference. Kemal Pasha soon became a very influential member of this faction.\n\nWorking from his position as Minister of War, Kemal ousted the German military mission and commenced an ambitious military restructuring in tandem with his ally Fevzi Pasha. Receiving great public acclaim for this action, he continued laying the foundations for his later rise in power. In early 1923, it would be Mustafa Kemal Pasha who would coordinate the Ottoman army intervention in Tripolitania Vilayet, where Fezzani tribes had risen up against a newly-appointed Ottoman governor. The revolt was suppressed with violence and extensive Ottoman garrisons were established in the urban centers of Tripolitania to prevent further trouble.\n\nFearing another Enver Pasha, the upper committee of the party pushed Cavit Bey forwards as its new leader. Incapable of challenging Mustafa Kemal in public speaking, this proved detrimental to the party when in 1925, Kemal made a successful bid for power and became Chairman of the Teceddüt. The party changed name a second time to the “Ottoman People's Party\" (OPP). Discontent with the more moderate style of its new leadership, a substantial amount of members left and created their own parties.\n\nGrand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire (1926-1931, 1935 - )[]\n\nThe elections of late 1926 ended in a victory for the newly reorganized OPP, but this was less due to the party itself, but more due to fragmentation of the opposition - where more than a dozen parties, mostly local, fought for any given seat. Mustafa Kemal Pasha, as the charismatic chairman of the OPP, was appointed Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire and head of a new OPP government in a ceremonial act by Sultan Abdulmejid II in Constantinople.\n\nThe newly appointed Grand Vizier did not hide his far-reaching ambitions, and in a flurry of reforms he pushed the nation towards his ideals. Massive strides were undertaken in the areas of education, economic recovery, and the fight against the religious establishment. He also pushed for the nationalization of foreign-owned railway tracks and the expansion of the barebones Ottoman railway system, assisting the completion of the Hejaz Railway, Baghdad Railway, Caucasus Railway and various smaller lines in Anatolia. The authoritarian style of the Grand Vizier, however, lead to a further splintering of the party - when his former ally and friend Kâzım Karabekir broke with the party and created his own party, the “ODF”, or “Ottoman Defence Party”.\n\nUnder threat by the rapid centralisation of the government apparatus and with many conservatives afraid that the OPP may be attempting to break with tradition, the 1931 elections however ended in the first electoral defeat for the OPP. The Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralisation under its leader Haqqi al-Azm became the grand winner of the elections, and formed a coalition with the FAP and the ODF to provide a united front against the growing centralist threat. The coalition, however, was under constant attack, as the various parties that played part in it had conflicting opinions on a non-OPP policy. Tensions reached a breaking point in late 1932, when the government of Haqqi al-Azm collapsed due to disagreement with the FAP and ODF. A new government was created under FAP leadership, but as a minority government failed in achieving its goals of decentralisation and liberalisation.\n\nThe continued failures by this coalition still go a long way in repairing the reputation of the OPP, which received a solid majority in the 1935 elections. As Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha begins his second term in office, signs have started to appear that he may be looking for an alternative to the constant obstruction by the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies and interference from the conservative lobby through the Sultan. The OPP government has ambitious and controversial plans, among them the reformation of the Ottoman education, penal and justice system and the further centralization of power; If these reforms will work out will only turn out in the future, as opposition to these intends remains omnipresent."
