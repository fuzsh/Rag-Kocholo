        "meta_description": "The assimilation of orphaned Armenian children during the Great War was an integral part of the Armenian Genocide. In every sense, figuratively and actually, the Armenians became, as Ronald Grigor Suny has poignantly put it, an “orphaned nation”. A particularly moving example of this policy was the orphanage established by Cemal Pasha in Lebanon, at Antoura, with the purpose of Islamizing and Turkifying Armenian orphans. The three memoirs by Antoura inmates, cited in this article, prove beyond a doubt that Islamization and Turkification were carried out. One of the main points made in this article is that Halide Edib, the famous Turkish nationalist and prolific writer, was very much part of the project. Appointed as the general director of education in Cemal Pasha’s Syria, she was personally involved in the project of Turkification and Islamization at Antoura, although she was later to deny it in her memoirs. Therefore, this article is as much about Halide Edib as it is about Antoura.",

        "text": "The Setting: The Antoura Orphanage as Cemal Pasha’s pilot project\n\n10 Lubnan. Mubahis Ilmiyya wa Ijtimaiyya [Lebanon. Scientific and Social Research], published in Augus (...)\n\nThis orphanage founded by His Excellency Cemal Pasha, Commander of the Fourth Army, is one of the best charitable institutions that exist in the Mountain. The orphans, boys and girls, educated here, are brought from Anatolia. The number of orphans is over eight hundred and they learn various trades. All the expenses are met by the budget of the Imperial Army.10\n\nGeneral Ottoman policy on orphans and orphanages\n\n12 V. Tachjian, 2009, p. 60-80.\n\nThis explains why, during the war years, Turkish authorities collected thousands of children on the roads of exile and placed them in newly opened establishments where they received an education characterized by strict disciplinary codes that aimed at ‘turkifying’ them and converting them to Islam.12\n\n7Province after province was asked to provide precise numbers and locations of orphans in their districts. On August 2, 1917, the Ministry of Interior was to send a circular cipher to all provinces asking the following two questions:\n\n16 BOA DH. ŞFR 78/204, 2 August 1917, Minister of Interior Talat to all provinces.\n\n1- How many refugees and immigrants are there in your province/district and how many Armenian and Greek orphans are located in the district? What are the numbers of males and females, Muslims and non-Muslims?\n\n2- How many of these are actually in orphanages, how many are left out and how are they being provided for?16\n\n9Another point that should be emphasized is the stark contrast between the accounts of the orphans at Antoura and Halide Edip’s account of her experience in her memoirs. For example, there is no mention in her memoirs of the use of elder Armenian boys who had converted to Islam and were used as prefects wielding whips. As shall be seen below, by the time she wrote her memoirs, Edip had developed a marked prejudice against the Armenians and had moved much closer to the official denialist position.\n\n10It should be noted also that the aim of the official orphanages such as Antoura was Turkification and Islamization. One may legitimately wonder why these two went together, particularly as the orphans at Antoura included Kurds and Turks. As will be seen below, the aim of all the official orphanages was to instill a “national character”. Even the Young Turk regime, despite its belief that the Turks constituted the backbone of the empire, was loath to give up Islam as a vital social cement. Hence, any “reprogramming” of Armenian orphans had to include an Islamic dimension.\n\nSome comments on the use of memoirs and the concept of “collective memory”\n\n22 M. Halbwachs, 2011, p. 139-155.\n\nCollective memory differs from history in at least two respects. It is a current of continuous thought whose continuity is not at all artificial for it retains from the past only what still lives or is capable of living in the consciousness of the groups keeping the memory alive […]. It provides the group a self-portrait that unfolds through time, since it is an image of the past, and allows the group to recognize itself through the total succession of images.22\n\nThe Memoirs of Melkon Bedrossian, Harutyun Alboyajian and Karnig Panian\n\nAttempted erasure of Armenian Identity\n\n33 M. Bedrossian, nd., p. 16.\n\nAfter the meal we were taken into the impressive room of the director and our names and family names were recorded. We were each given a number, mine was 8, we had to memorize this number because it was by this number that we were to be addressed. Then they told us about the rules and regulations of the school.33\n\n17If the family names were recorded, this suggests that the authorities actually wanted a record of the previous identity of the children. Yet the aim of the institution became very clear when the Director, Fevzi Bey, as Melkonian recounts, made the following speech to the newly arrived orphans:\n\n34 Ibid., p. 17.\n\n“My dear children in olden times, you were Turks, children of Turks, the Christians converted your great grandparents by force to Christianity. Now it is indispensable that you return to your mother religion, the Islamic faith. Your religion is old and outdated, like that of fire worshippers. Your Jesus is also worn out, and like a worn out old shirt we throw it away and take another.” Those of us who could understand his speech were very moved and disturbed because, like me and my sisters we could not forget the burning of our homes and the horrible massacre of 18 of our 20 men before our very eyes. Fevzi Bey continued his speech saying that the religion of the Prophet Mohammad was the only true religion and you must accept this faith. Hearing this all the children started to cry, Fevzi Bey seemed about to reprimand us, but instead he interrupted his speech.34\n\n18When some of the children still resisted conversion the administration resorted to force declaring one morning that the fifteen children still holding out would have to convert and take Turkish names by the evening:\n\n35 Ibid., p. 18-19.\n\nCrying, each of us chose a Turkish name, when we hesitated the secretary would assign a name to us, I took the name of the carpenter of our village, I became Negib, number 8, my sisters became Ayşe and Lütfiye. It was very humiliating for us to be called by Turkish names, above all having to memorize them.35\n\n19Harutyun Alboyadjian stated:\n\n36 V. Svazlian, 2011, p. 426.\n\nNothing had changed the only difference was that the boys were now called effendi and the girls hanum. Every morning and night we had to salute the Turkish flag and cry out “Padişahım Çok Yaşa! [Long Live the Sultan!]” […]. Djemal Pasha had ordered that we should be given proper care and attention, since he appreciated the Armenians’ brains and graces and hoped that, in case of victory, thousands of Turkified Armenian children would, in the coming years, ennoble his nation and we would become his future support. Towards that aim Djemal Pasha had teachers brought from Constantinople.36\n\n20Harutyun Alboyajian also stressed Turkification and the ban on speaking Armenian:\n\n37 Ibid.\n\nWhen they killed my parents, they took me and the other under age children to Djemal Pasha’s Turkish orphanage and Turkified us. My surname was “535” and my name was Shukri. My Armenian friend also became Enver. They circumcised us.37\n\n21This is the only clear mention of circumcision in Alboyajian’s memoir. It seems that the most important aspect of the Turkification process was language:\n\n38 Ibid.\n\nThere were many others who did not know Turkish; they did not speak for weeks, with a view to hiding their Armenian origin. If the gendarmes knew about it, they would beat them with “falakhas.” The punishment consisted of twenty, thirty or fifty strokes on the soles of the feet, or being forced to look directly at the sun for hours. They made us pray according to the Islamic custom, after which we were compelled to say three times “Padişahım çok yaşa!”38\n\nBribery through food\n\n42 M. Bedrossian, nd., p. 20.\n\n[…] At noon we went down to the main refectory. The tables were clean with drawers, before each chair there was a saucer full of onion soup and a loaf of bread of some 25-30 grams. The bathrooms, dormitories and refectory were magnificent and impeccable.42\n\n24The scene described above in Melkon Bedrossian’s memoirs was indeed a case of too good to be true. The next day the student supervisors, who were older Armenian boys called çavuş (“sergeant”) told them that those who chose to convert would be given extra food with meat, those who refused would continue to be given a thin gruel made of flour and water. At each mealtime they were encouraged to take Turkish names and convert:\n\n43 Ibid.\n\n44 Ibid.\n\nWe had become like skeletons, eating nothing but that thin gruel. When we could smell the aroma of meat in the refectory some converted and were given meat, whereas we and others from our villages would wait in the corner of the refectory as the converts were fed first. They would then emerge from the refectory regaling us with how well they had eaten.43\n\n[…] We were given little food at our Turkish orphanage. Our gharavanadjis [cauldron bearers] were on duty in the dining-room. One day one of the gharavanadjis, an Armenian boy from Gyurin, saw me while entering the dining-room, held me by the arm and said in Turkish: “Shukri, will you make a belt for me?” I thought: he was a gharavanadji; he might help me in return and give me some more dinner.44\n\nCo-option of peers\n\n26One of the cruelest aspects of life at the orphanage was the use of Turkified Armenian orphans as prefects enforcing the process of Turkification and Islamization. They are usually referred to as older Armenian boys who collaborated with the authorities. Bedrossian lamented the cruelty of the prefects called çavuş:\n\n46 M. Bedrossian, nd., p. 24.\n\n[They] did not hesitate to use their whips for some extra soup. They all had Turkish names like Cemal, Şakir, İzzet. The most severe of them was Toros, converted to Enver, who had only one arm whom we called çolak [“he with one arm”]. He had volunteered to become circumcised.46\n\nCemal Pasha’s visits to Antoura\n\n28Cemal Pasha paid two visits to Antoura. They are recorded as momentous events in the memoirs: most memorable because of the treats of extra food. Bedrossian stated that “we belonged to Cemal Pasha”. The occasion of Cemal’s visit to Antoura as told by Bedrossian is worth quoting in full:\n\n[…] We were told that Cemal Pasha was coming on a visit of inspection and we were also told that it was on his orders that the orphanage was opened, so that was why we were here, we belonged to Cemal Pasha. Everywhere was decked out with Turkish flags, the refectory scrubbed and made pretty and all the classrooms were impeccably clean. Finally, Cemal Pasha arrived with a large retinue. Guided by the Director and Fevzi Bey, he inspected all the classrooms, when he came to our class, at a sign from the supervisor we all sprang to our feet. The Pasha was very impressed by our discipline, he then asked the name of the supervisor who replied, “My name is Cemal my Pasha”.\n\n29The Pasha smiled and said aferim oğlum [“bravo my son”] and they left. The boys then gave an impressive sporting display followed by a paramilitary parade. The Pasha expressed his satisfaction to the Director.\n\n48 M. Bedrossian, nd., p. 23.\n\nAfterwards we entered the refectory for a copious meal, roast lamb with pilav rice, as much bread as we could eat and sweet halwa for desert. All of this was clearly exceptional we wished the Pasha would come every day.48\n\n30Cemal Pasha’s visits are also featured in Alboyajian’s memoir:\n\n49 V. Svazlian, 2011, p. 427.\n\nOne day, Djemal Pasha came to the orphanage to see the state of his Armenian boys, who had become Turks. It was one of the Muslim religious holidays. I do not remember – it was either Ghurban Bayram or Ramadan. On those days, they gave us good food with meat. Once, when Djemal Pasha came, they called me:\n\n— 535. Are you Shukri?\n\nCemal then asked him to show some of the items he had made. When he found out that Harutyun had made his belts with scavenged materials he complimented him, calling him “a gifted child”.49\n\n31Panian’s account of Cemal Pasha’s visit to the orphanage is very different from the accounts of Bedrossian or Alboyajian. Bedrossian and Alboyajian spoke of the visit in much more neutral terms, even under a somewhat positive light, mentioning that they were given a feast in the Pasha’s honor, etc. However, Panian tells a different story. The visit starts out quite normally with the orphans lined up for inspection, their shouting “Yaşasın Cemal Pasha!” [“Long live Cemal Pasha!”] in unison, with Fevzi Bey proud of their appropriately respectful behavior. Then abruptly, things changed:\n\nSomething unexpected happened: four or five of the older orphans came forward, saluted the Pasha respectfully and bowed. Then one of them spoke in a shaky voice: “Pasha! You are our father! You have saved us from the jaws of death. We will never forget what you have done for us. We were starving to death, and you rescued us. But Pasha, we are still starving! They give us only two tiny buns of bread per day. We are hungry as we were before we came here, and soon we will die if you do not help us!”\n\n“Beginning from this day all of you are Armenians again”\n\n34The most critical part of Alboyajian’s memoir is the section where he gives an account of the evacuation of the orphanage by the Turks:\n\n52 V. Svazlian, 2011, p. 427.\n\nOne day, we woke up without the bell ringing; the doors were not opened. When we opened the doors and went down, we saw there were no Turkish guards or soldiers, no officers, inspectors or teachers; there was no one. There was no one to ring the bell for us to go to the dining-room. Our big boys who had become Turks: our chiefs, had attacked the Kurd Silo and were beating him, and Silo was bellowing like a buffalo. He could hardly free himself from the boys and found refuge in the forest nearby. This was that same Silo, who had said to Khoren over and over: “I have killed ninety-nine Armenians. If I kill you too, that will be one hundred.” This was that scoundrel Silo, whom the Armenian orphans had taught a good lesson, feeling free to do so, because not a Turkish officer was left, for they had heard that Beirut would be liberated.\n\nAs our orphanage was a military orphanage, we had special rules. Each class had to stand around its table, but there was neither chief, nor corporal or sergeant. All of us were standing and waiting, and there was no bread on the table. Our Erza Bey, the pharmacist, came. He had the military rank of major, and three Armenian orphans helped him. That doctor of ours came. He was walking between the tables up and down. He gave the order, “Sit down.” We all sat down. He continued going and coming up and down, in deep thought. He came up to our corporal Enver, who was Armenian but he was circumcised and said: “Oğlum Enver, senin Ermeni ismin ne idi?” [“My son, Enver, what was your Armenian name?”]\n\n— Toros idi, Efendim [“It was Toros, Sir”], said the boy saluting.\n\nThen he went to the corporal of the next class: “My son, Djemal, what was your Armenian name?”\n\n— Vardan idi, Efendim [“It was Vardan, Sir”].\n\nThen he came to the others. All the corporals were on foot and said their names. One minute of silence reigned. All of us were waiting […]. He said: “Bu günden sonra hepiniz de gene Ermenisiniz” [“Beginning from this day all of you are Armenians again”]. And continued in a sorrowful mood: “As you see there’s no one today of our officers; they are absent. Had I wanted, I might be absent, too. I could go with them, but I decided not to go, not to leave you. It may so happen that they come in a few minutes, put handcuff on my hands and take me prisoner. But I remained, I didn’t leave you. I beg you don’t give trouble to the Kurds around you. Continue to live in peace as you have done so. If I were not here; you would not be here either […]”. He did not continue, but later we learned that they had asked the pharmacist to poison our last supper, but he had refused to obey their order.\n\nAnd really, soon they came with the Arab Sheriff, put handcuffs on his hands and took him away. We all were sad and silent. When they were taking him out, he said:\n\n“It’s a pity that God did not return to me all the kindness I have done. God blinded my only son, Nedjatli, and I treated you as my own son”.52\n\nThe Antoura Album\n\n57 Antoura album; unsigned memo probably written by Bayard Dodge.\n\nIn 1915 the Turks started to massacre and transport the Armenians of Asia Minor. Although Ahmad Jamal Pasha […] was chiefly responsible for the starvation in Lebanon, he was less cruel than his associates were in his treatment of the Armenians. Accordingly, instead of allowing a large group of Armenian boys and girls to die of exposure he had them gathered together and placed in a government orphanage […]. The famous feminist leader Halidah [sic] Edib Hanum was given overall supervision of the orphanage […]. Although the children had their Christian names changed to Muslim ones and the atmosphere of the institution was of a military and unsympathetic nature it was far from all bad.57\n\nEnter Halide Edib\n\n63 “Stepan Dardooni, Seminarian, Deportee, and Legionnaire” in Paren Kazanjian, The Cilician Armenian (...)\n\nMy younger brother had been taken to Lebanon and placed in a Turkish orphanage opened by the infamous and lecherous favorite of Kemal Ataturk, Halide Hanum Edib Adivar, who wrote a couple of pious, unctuous books all but venerated in Western “liberal intellectual” circles […]. But these orphanages were not opened out of humanitarian reasons but were meant to turkify [sic] the Armenian children who had been orphaned precisely by this Halide Edib’s monstrous Young Turks.63\n\n41As a graduate of the American College for Girls in Istanbul, it is perhaps natural that one of her early contacts in Beirut was the son-in-law of the President of Syria Protestant College Howard Bliss, Bayard Dodge. Dodge clearly states that the conditions of the orphans greatly improved after Halide Edib’s arrival:\n\n64 American University of Beirut Archive. Howard Bliss Collection 1902-1922, Box 18, File 3. About Ame (...)\n\nThe lady whom Djemal Pasha chose to manage the hospice was probably the most capable and enlightened lady in Turkey. Her name is Haldeh [sic] Hanum and she is a graduate of the American College at Constantinople and a leader in modern movements among the Turkish women. When she came the situation changed. Every attempt was made to make the children comfortable. The old religious prejudices were winked at and a good man was engaged as director. For over a year the children were well cared for and a very fine staff of teachers was employed to take care of them.64\n\n42This account is in stark contrast to the memoirs of at least one of the Antoura survivors. Karnig Panian gives a very different account of how during the daily flag ceremonies carried out by the Director Fevzi Bey, which turned into daily torture sessions, with boys being given the bastinado for various offences, Halide Edib would be present but would not interfere in any way:\n\n65 K. Panian, 2015, p. 93, 95.\n\nMany of the punished boys couldn’t walk for weeks. Some lost their teeth and broke their noses. Most fainted while crying for mercy or pathetically screaming for their mothers […]. This was a daily event for two years […]. I saw Halide Edib […]. She would often lean against the sundial and watch us play. She seemed carefree. Sometimes she journeyed to Beirut and returned a few days later with stacks of books under her arms. She said she was writing a book about the orphans; others claimed that at night, she sucked the blood out of the necks of the older boys. We did not know what to believe. Did she think of our suffering? Did she think about our terrible pasts or our bleak futures? Did she have any motherly instincts that allowed her to sympathize with us? Whenever the bell rang to rush us into our classrooms, she would go into her quarters and stay there until evening, when she reappeared at the flag lowering ceremony and the beatings that followed.65\n\n43Panian makes no mention of her trying to stop the tortures. In her own account Halide Edib is somewhat ambivalent regarding her attitude to the Turkification and Islamization policies. In one of her early conversations with Cemal Pasha, Halide Edib was openly critical of his policies regarding the orphanage:\n\n66 H.E. Adıvar, 1926, p. 428, 429.\n\nI said, “you have been as good to the Armenians as it is possible to be in these hard days. Why do you allow Armenian children to be called by Moslem names? It looks like turning Armenians into Moslems and history someday will revenge it on the coming generation of Turks”.\n\n“You are an idealist” he answered gravely, “and like all idealists [you] lack a sense of reality. Do you believe that by turning a few hundred Armenian boys and girls Moslem I think I benefit my race? You have seen the Armenian orphanage. This is a Moslem orphanage, and only Moslem orphans are allowed […]. I cannot bear to see them die in the streets”. He also declared that ultimately after the war, they would be free to return to their “race”.66\n\n68 BOA DH. ŞFR 576-47, Halide Edib to the mutasarrıf of Lebanon, Ismail Hakkı Bey. Forwarded to Cemal (...)\n\nIn the eventuality of the situation [of the war] going against us, it would be a political and humanitarian error to abandon such a large group, whose parents were killed by Turks, [ebeveyni Türkler tarafından őldürülmüş] to the foreigners. To abandon the orphanage would be an error enabling them to use it as political and humanitarian evidence against us. For this reason, I am in favor, for now, of immediately transferring Antoura to Istanbul […]. The children can be moved to Istanbul in relative safety only if you provide transport for the staff. If Antoura is indeed to be abandoned I request that you leave Mount Lebanon.68\n\n48The memoirs cited above make ample mention of Islamization and Turkification, although it seems that circumcision was indeed exceptional. It seems that in her early days in Syria, Edib did have genuine sympathy for the plight of the Armenians, as shown in a letter she wrote to Cavid Bey in which she expressed her despair:\n\n74 M. Bardakçı, 2014, p. 23. Letter from Halide Edib to Cavid Bey, 1 March 1917. Cavid Bey was one of (...)\n\nThere are many Armenians here who have managed to stay alive here and only here and who swear by God and the sacred head of Cemal Pasha. They say, “in the whole world we love only you and Cemal Pasha […]”. They have distended bellies after eating grass in the desert. Many have lost their mothers, fathers, or children […]. Cemal Pasha had brought them here, they are given some food by the municipality […]. Cannot the new Cabinet at least alleviate some of the results of this unprecedented oppression and murder?74\n\n81 H.E. Adıvar, 1926,p. 379. The book in question was André Mandelstam’s, Le sort de l’Empire ottoman(...)\n\nThe spirit of the argument is that the Ottoman Empire must be torn to pieces, and the Turks must not be considered ordinary human beings, and the Young Turks are ordinary criminals, having massacred the Armenians […]. There is a detailed account of the Armenian massacres […]. I do not however, find a word about the great massacre of the Turks by the Bulgarians nor its accompaniment of atrocities in 1912, not a word about the great massacre of the Turks by the Armenians who entered Oriental Turkey in 1915 […]. The book […] made me see for the first time the incurable narrowness and one sidedness of the European mind of these days concerning my country and its people, and for the first time I saw clearly that the argument of the Young Turks had real force.81\n\n51This is almost identical to the denialist position of modern Turkey today. Therefore, this mindset has to be taken into consideration when evaluating her accounts of what she did in Antoura.\n\n*\n\n56Antoura had a privileged status among the other orphanages. The fact that a personage as illustrious as Halide Edib was appointed director is an indication of this status. We have seen that other orphanages were emptied of their orphans in order to provide orphans for Antoura. Halide Edip may have disagreed with some of the methods of her contemporaries, but she was fully in agreement with Cemal on his policy of replacing missionary education with Turkish education. There are interesting divergences and similarities in the three sources cited above and the memoirs of Halide Edib. All three Armenian accounts agree that a brutal process of conversion and Turkification was carried out at Antoura. They are also in agreement that Antoura had special importance for Cemal Pasha as shown by his two visits when they were proudly displayed to him as successful cases of assimilation. Yet Panian’s account of the event of “orphan resistance” is not mentioned in the other two accounts. Nor are the visits mentioned in either version (English or Turkish) of Halide Edib’s memoirs.\n\n59"
