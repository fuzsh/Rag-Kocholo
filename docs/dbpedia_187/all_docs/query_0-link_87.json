        "text": "Aksaray Quarter\n\nIt is surrounded by Cerrahpaşa Street to the north, Gazi Mustafa Kemalpaşa Street to the east, Kennedy Street to the south, Yokuş Çeşmesi and Davutpaşa İskelesi Streets to the west.\n\nEarly Age and the Byzantine Period\n\nAksaray is one of the oldest quarters of Fatih. During the excavations in Yenikapı for the Marmaray Station, along with many shipwrecks and historical artefacts, the 'Lost Harbour of Theodosius' and a grave and skeleton of the first inhabitants of Fatih dating back to 6500 BC were discovered.\n\nThe Aksaray settlement, which functioned as a natural harbour at the point where the famous Lycos Stream flowed into the sea during the Byzantium Period, remained within the walls of Constantine I when the city was transformed from Byzantium to Constantinople. Thanks to the alluvial soils carried by the Lycos Stream, the area around the stream close to the Marmara Sea (today's Yenikapı and Langa Street) was an orchard area, while the place where it flowed into the sea was a natural harbour. In the 4th century, a harbour named Eleutherios was built here. Long known as the lost harbour, this structure was unearthed during the Marmaray excavations.\n\nThis harbour, which was built by Theodosius, started to fill up as of the 7th century, both with what the Lykos Stream brought in and with the dumping of earthworks. By the 13th century, the harbour was completely out of use. In 1871, the construction of the railway line led to the disappearance of the harbour. In the 1950s, with the opening of the land road outside the city walls (Kennedy Street), the embankment was enlarged and the harbour was left far inland from the sea. Subsequently, Vatan Street was also opened and Lycos (Bayrampaşa) Stream was eliminated. Aksaray was also famous for its orchards along the coast. The water needs of the orchards were met from the water wells here. After the Byzantine period, orchards were also in use during the Ottoman period. At the entrance of Yenikapı Pier, the city's import and export gateway, there was a quarantine and a customs building. There were workplaces belonging to Armenian and Greek merchants.\n\nThe Mese Road, which was built as the capital of Eastern Rome during the reign of Constantine and was the main artery of the city, started from the Agora of Byzantium (where the Hagia Sophia is today), extended to the Tauri Forum (today's Beyazıt Square), and was divided into two when it reached the Capitol slightly to its west. One of its branches ran northwards parallel to the Golden Horn to the Poliyandri (Edirne) Gate, and the other branch reached today's Aksaray Square (today's Bovis Forum - Ox Square). From there, it would reach the seventh hill to the Arkadius Forum (Cerrahpaşa), and from there to the Porta Aura (Golden Gate) Yedikule Gate.\n\nAksaray was located on this most important axis of the imperial city. It was at the centre of both land and sea transportation and trade. It constituted the zone IX of the Byzantine city administration plan.\n\nThe Forum Bovis was built in the 380s and was in the form of an open market. Named after the statue of a bovine, the statue that characterised the square was used for executions. After the criminals were placed inside this statue, a fire was lit underneath it and the punishment was carried out. This method of punishment was first used in Sicily by Falaris, the Greek Despot of Sicily, and for the first time in Aksaray by burning the first Christians of İstanbul during the reign of Lulianus (361-363). The statue was later attacked and shattered during the reign of Heraclius (610-641).\n\nThe corpse of Emperor Phocas, who was overthrown in 610, Stefanos and Theodatos, the two deputies of Justinian II, who were removed from power in a coup d'état in 695, and the icon-breakers of the 8th century, were executed in this square and in this statue of a bull under which a fire was lit. The square was later transformed into an area where emperors returning from victory were ceremoniously welcomed.\n\nAksaray during the Ottoman Period\n\nBefore and after the conquest, Bovis Forum lost its commercial characteristic to a great extent. When the Karamanids were defeated by the Ottoman Commander İshak Pasha, Turkish families from Konya - Aksaray were compulsorily brought and settled in the vicinity of Bovis Forum. In addition to these, families from Bursa, Tire, Çarşamba, Sinop, Samsun, Skopje and Yenişehir were brought from Bursa and settled in Aksaray. Thus, the social structure, function and name of this place underwent a change with the Conquest.\n\nIn addition, in order to revitalise the commercial life of the city, Jews and Armenians were brought and settled in various parts of the city. Aksaray was also positively affected by this intensification of foreign migration. With the revitalised social, cultural and commercial life, inns with economic and cultural characteristics emerged. Beyazıt-Aksaray axis was one of the axes where these inns were located. During the reign of the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, Aksaray District was divided into 12 masjids, which were built with the aim of Islamising this district, and 12 quarters named after them. These founding quarters were Alembey, Baklalı Kemaleddin, Çakırağa, Gureba Hüseyin, Kemal Paşa, Kızıl Minare, Kovacı Dede, Mesih Paşa, Molla Kestel, Murat Paşa, Oruç Gazi and Sinekli Masjid quarters. As can be seen from the area covered by these quarters, it was much larger than today's Aksaray Quarter. In those years, between 5000 and 6000 people lived in Aksaray and the total number of the quarters in İstanbul was 262. Hindular Tekkesi Quarter and Ekşi Karadut Quarter did not have masjids. Today, the locations of the Ekiciler Quarter, Kumankeş Ahmet Ağa, Cevher Ağa Schools and Virdinar Sebili are unknown. Armenians and Greeks lived on the coast and slopes of Aksaray and Turks lived in the inner parts. Despite its rich demography, the quarter did not have a cosmopolitan disorder. It was a quarter inhabited by bureaucrats, madrasa scholars and students, and Turkish spoken in this quarter was at the best of its time.\n\nOld Aksaray was the area surrounded by Camcılar Mosque, Murat Pasha Mosque, Aksaray Police Station, Çakırağa Mosque, tram warehouse and Pertevniyal Mosque. In this area, there were public baths, lodges, coffee shops, and pudding and pastry shops. The most central part of this area was İslamder Pasha Muhteki Şekerciler Street.\n\nThe streets of Aksaray used to be narrow, and the houses forming these streets used to have bay windows, and there used to be flower pots, house cats and bird cages in the bay windows. There used to be gizzards where the doors with iron and brass ring-shaped knockers were opened. The entrance areas of the house used to be covered with Malta stone or earthen floor. Houses used to be decorated with handicrafts of skilful women and cleaned. Also red syrups, aged canton oils, rose vinegars, mint and peppermint juices, bitter trees, senna, sugar candies and tamarinds used to be kept in the medicine cabinets of the houses. In addition to these medicines, which were generally good against diseases, the \"share given to the onlooker\" was respected especially in the month of Muharram and Ashura was served. In the spring following the winter, spring festivities, especially the purple wisteria flower, which was a favourite of the people of Aksaray, were held. When May came, the gardens of the coffee houses would be prepared for their customers. In Aksaray, the coffeehouses frequented by the bureaucrats and the educated people and the coffeehouses frequented by the tough hoodlums were separate. There were also \"Semai Coffeehouses\" where minstrels and poets hung out. Before Şehzadebaşı Direklerarası, Aksaray's \"Yeşil Tulumba Square\" was the most entertaining place in İstanbul. That square was in the middle of the road descending from Laleli Mosque to Aksaray. There were famous places such as Giritli Necati Efendi, Dilgüşa Coffee Houses, Yeşil Tulumba and Çavuş's Coffee House. These places used to be so crowded that there would be no seats left. Among many other coffeehouses in Aksaray, the famous one was Odabaşı Coffee House. This place was usually the hangout of famous people such as the writer Ahmet Rasim, the hoodlum Arap Hüsam, and Deli Nüzhet, father of Rıfat Pasha, one of the mayors of İstanbul. There were also hashish cafes in Tophane and Üsküdar, as well as in Aksaray. These places, which were not respected by the general public, were the hangout spots of wandering travellers, horse riders, so-called dervishes with their coins and cones, and prodigals in cardigans and furs.\n\nSemai coffeehouses tended to be more ornate than others, with coloured paper and birdcages hanging from the ceilings. In these places, minstrels used to have conversations with the accompaniment of musical instruments. For the last 200 years, Aksaray had been a district where middle and lower middle class families lived. The people of Aksaray were divided into two groups: artisans and officials. The artisans were unpretentious people living in 2-3 room houses. The high officials, who lived in three-storey, 12-room houses with two consoles in each room, with courtyards and gardens around Sinekli Bakkal and Murat Pasha Mosque, were generally state officials.\n\nThose who went a bit too far in the coffeehouses, where political conversations and organisations were held before the Second Constitutional Monarchy, were sent into exile by the Ittihad and Terakki Government. Some of these names included Mevlanazade Rıfat and Ali Kemal, journalist Hasan Fehmi and Ahmet Samim. There was also a group in Aksaray, known as the 12's, who committed extortion, gambling, drinking and adultery and got on well with the security forces of the period. They used to stone houses, tease women and girls, and even kill people. There were many open and secret brothels, dens and prostitution houses on Şekerci Street and other places. Officials of all ranks, including high-ranking officials, were seen in these places. Apart from the entertainment activities of a certain group of people, there were also entertainment events organised with the participation of the people at Yeşil Tulumba Square. In one of these, \"Hoy Goycular\" would come at the beginning of Muharram. In groups of four or five, burly, blind, lame, crippled, with colourful turbans and cones on their heads, wearing quilted turbans, bags on their backs and dogs with them, they would knock on all the doors and they used to beg in a peculiar style: \"I set out from Aksaray. We do not look left and right. Man on the ground and angel in the sky. Watermelon sometimes turns out to be unripe\".\n\nRamadan and Eid al-Adha were usually celebrated by the people in Yeşil Tulumba Square. It was an indispensable place especially for children. Girls and boys dressed in various festive dresses would spend their allowances they received from their elders by buying the favourite snacks and drinks of the period such as rooster candy, chewing gum, hazelnuts, seeds, chickpeas, pistachios, Turkish delight, syrup, paste, and soda pop. Furthermore, Ramadan was a month of entertainment in Aksaray as it was in the Direklerarası in Şehzadebaşı. From evening until dawn, people would have fun with performances such as Karagöz and Hacivat, visit dervish lodges and shrines during the day, and in the evenings, rich families would go for a walk on Aksaray-Divan Yolu Street, where various dessert, beverage and tea shops were located. Meanwhile, non-Muslim restaurant owners would not open their restaurants out of respect. Those who were already fasting would give up work for a month. Even civil servants would take their work slowly.\n\nThe New Military Barracks in Aksaray\n\nWhen Suleiman the Magnificent wanted to build a large mosque in Şehzadebaşı for his son Şehzade Mehmet, who died at a young age, he had the janissary barracks (old chamber), which had been stationed in this place by the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror after the Conquest, transferred by building a large barracks called Yeni Odalar (New Chambers) with a square called \"Meat Square\" in the middle, close to Vatan Street in today's İskenderpaşa Quarter. \"Meat Square\" is famous for its \"mutinies\" which became symbolic in the Janissary revolts. In 1826, when the Janissaries in the New Chambers rebelled against the discipline of the Eşkinci Ocağı (the New Military Unit), which was established with the aim of creating an alternative army to the deteriorating Janissaries, Sultan Mahmut II issued the edict of the incident known in our history as \"Vak'a-i Hayriye\" (The Auspicious Incident) and abolished the Janissaries by executing approximately 10,000 rebels. Keçecizade İzzet Molla described this event in a poem he wrote based on the abjad calculation as follows: \"Blaspheming many blessings, they piled them up in the Meat Square, the cauldron was overturned, and the guild was destroyed.\"\n\nThere were seven gates of the New Chambers Barracks, and since one of these gates was the entrance for the meat of the barracks, the square where this gate opened was called the Meat Square. This square was also the training (drill hall) square. Around this square, there was a gunpowder and candle making factory, 8 butcher shops and a masjid. The kaputluk (janissary dress) and the room of the Janissary Agha were also located in this square. The meat of the Janissaries was prepared in the slaughterhouses outside the walls of Yedikule and transported to this place every morning by 30 horses.\n\nThe place of this guild, which turned into ruins, was opened for settlement in 1933. Today, only the Meat Square Cistern next to the Ahmediye Mosque remains from this historical building group.\n\nImportant Historical Events of Aksaray\n\nThe most important historical events of Aksaray after Vak'a-i Hayriye were the fires. Due to the wooden building stock, inadequate pump organisation and lack of water, Aksaray was burnt to ashes numerous times. These disasters were prevented in the Tanzimat Reform Period by transforming into a masonry building and modern fire brigade system.\n\nFires that Affected Aksaray:\n\nThe first known fire was in 562, during the Byzantine Period.\n\n1540 Old Aksaray Fire\n\nThe Great Fire of 1660\n\n1699 Şehremini Fire (With 310 scales of gunpowder burnt, 425 buildings and Aksaray Mosque were damaged.)\n\n1716 3rd Cibali Fire (Laleli Aksaray line, Davutpaşa Mosque and many palaces and buildings were burnt down).\n\n1757 6th Cibali Fire (The fire spread to Aksaray and burnt down many houses together with the New Chambers Barracks.)\n\nThe Fire of 1855 (748 buildings burnt down in and around Yeşiltulumba Square on the Aksaray-Laleli route).\n\nIn 1863, 186 buildings were burnt down on the same route.\n\n450 buildings burnt down in the Langa-Aksaray, Koska-Laleli fires of 1908.\n\n2400 buildings were burnt down in the great Aksaray fire on 23 July 1911.\n\nA poet had expressed this disaster as follows:\n\n\"The capital was burnt, again, ah, it was devastated, and it burnt down with such a terrifying fire. It spread everywhere as if it was an ocean, and even people who did not know how to cry started to weep.\"\n\nYet another poet wrote the following about one of the fires:\n\n\"Many people were burnt with their property and their lives. It was not known whether the dead were men or women.\" Apart from the fires, Aksaray was also in trouble with the flooding of Aksaray by the Lycos (Bayrampaşa) Stream, which overflowed with the rains. The waters could cover the streets and avenues of Aksaray with a rain lasting two hours.\n\nFormer Social Areas of Aksaray\n\nThere used to be a market place opposite the Valide Sultan Mosque. After the shops here were sold to market vendors in the 1920s, this market place was demolished and converted into residences and workplaces. Again in Aksaray, there was a famous garden called Sütçü Bostanı. When the gardener who owned it died, his heirs did not engage in the same business, and in 1938 the İstanbul Municipality turned it into a park.\n\nCommercial Life in Aksaray\n\nAlong with its commercial density, Aksaray was a centre where the houses of tradesmen who worked in other districts were located. Aksaray tradesmen consisted of coffee makers, sweet makers, goldsmiths, soap makers, halva vendors and tavern keepers. In this period, another tradesman who was doing the same job could not come and open a shop next to a tradesman practising the same profession. The law would not allow this. Vangel, the famous tripe seller of Aksaray, opened a shop on İnkılap Street in 1890 and operated it until 2002. One of the first pharmacies of İstanbul was opened in Aksaray in 1895 by Ethem Pertev Bey. Again in these years, along with the first fez shop, tradesmen such as dessert makers, pastry makers, soup makers, restaurant owners, bakers and snack sellers operated in these neighbourhoods. The Turkish bath, which became famous as \"Saraylılar Hamamı\", was also located there.\n\nLocal Services in Aksaray (From Past to Present)\n\nİstanbul tradesmen began to be governed by the guild system after the Conquest. However, in the 17th century, the city was divided into 15 districts (municipal departments) along with the police services. Aksaray was one of these districts. In 1868, a department was established to manage Aksaray district locally. During the reign of Mahmut II, the construction of masonry buildings was started, and in 1869, electricity was provided to the district for the first time by making use of the Yedikule Gas House. In the same year, a tramway was established, and in 1909, transportation was started to be carried out by minibuses and buses. In 1913, the \"public latrine\" was put into service.\n\nDrinking water networks were renewed, streets were started to be washed in 1914, and a ban on building wooden houses was put into practice in 1921. Aksaray Police Station was located at the junction of Millet Street and Cerrahpaşa Street. The police station mostly dealt with bullying, prostitution and theft offences. Aksaray underwent major physical changes during the Menderes Period. One of these is Yenikapı-Unkapanı Boulevard. The boulevard was built with a length of 1655 metres and a width of 50 metres at a cost of TRY 4.200.000 including the cost of expropriation. During Haşim İşcan's term as Mayor (1964-68), Haşim İşcan Passage, Millet and Vatan Avenues were constructed in the same years.\n\nSandıkburnu\n\nIt was an area built by filling method with the old Yalı Quarter on the north side and surrounded by the Marmara Sea on the south. This area was famous for its shabby houses and casino-like entertainment places. Since the 17th century, it was a place where the art of music was performed and alcohol was consumed the most.\n\nIt had colourful figures such as the composer-mevlithan, the Imam of the Holy House, the Emir of Surre, Hafız Mohlası with a beautiful turban and Enderunlu Hafız Hüsnü Efendi, who started drinking raki after the Isha prayer. After the Mosque of Edirne was taken back from the Bulgarians, he was a person who recited the adhan and mawlid in the mosque, expelled those who did not listen to the prayer and spoke during the fasıls he organised, and was fluent in Arabic and French. He passed away in 1919. In 1935, the most famous casinos were the Red Rose, Bizim and Ahmet's Havuzlu Bahçe Casinos in Sandıkburnu at the end of Mahramacı Street. The casinos disappeared with the opening of Kennedy Street.\n\nYalı Quarter\n\nIt was established as an Armenian Quarter. Surp Tateos Partogomeos Grogoryan Church, which is attributed to the two apostles of Jesus Christ, is still active even though it has a small congregation. The Kâtip Fountain, which bears the name of one of the streets of the quarter, is not in its present location. The disturbing life of Aksaray, which continued with its various vices and the famous 12's with their mayhem, faded after the 1960s. With the latest regulations, Aksaray Quarter was reconstructed under the name of Aksaray by integrating Yalı, Kürkçübaşı, Çakırağa and İnebey Quarters.\n\nAyvansaray Quarter\n\nIt is surrounded by the land walls to the north and west, Kariye Mosque and Kariye Türbesi Streets and Draman Street to the south, Kesmekaya and Ayan Streets to the southeast, and the Golden Horn Coast to the east.\n\nThere are two opinions regarding the name Ayvansaray. Firstly, it is said to be derived from \"Animal Palace\" due to the feeding of exotic animals, especially elephants, in this neighbourhood where the Old Blaherna Palace was located; and secondly, it is said to be derived from \"Eyvan Saray\" due to the high 'iwan' buildings located in this area.\n\nAyvansaray Quarter was reconstituted with a decision taken by the İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality Assembly on 16 July 2008 by transforming the former quarters of Avcıbey, Kasım Gürani, Balat Karabaş, Molla Aşkı and Atik Mustafapaşa into a single quarter under the name of the former Ayvansaray Quarter. The names of the merged quarters were taken from the names of the benefactors who contributed to the formation of the quarters. For example, Avcıbey Quarter; the original name of Avcıbey comes from Avcı Mehmet Bey. He was the head hunter of the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror. After the conquest, he built a masjid here to Islamise and Turkify the quarter. His quarter, which was named after him, was also formed around him. However, the masjid was demolished in the 1950s and was never rebuilt.\n\nBalat Karabaş Quarter consists of the area extending east of Ayvansaray Avenue and Mürselpaşa Avenue to the Golden Horn. Since it was outside the city walls, it used to be called \"External Balat\". During the Byzantine Period, this area was outside the Golden Horn walls. It was the place where the sewage in this part of the city reached the sea. The Walled City, where sea transport was available and therefore the boatmen worked, was also like a free trade zone. Namely, the administration of this period did not levy taxes on commercial goods coming from various countries. Only rent was collected from the warehouses where the goods were stored. This was a district where the rich and the poor lived together in connection with the movement of goods arriving by sea. In general, there was no cleanliness and city order in this place where the riffraff lived. In this period, along with many foreigners engaged in trade, Jews, known by the name of Ohri, also lived here. There were three synagogues belonging to this community. After the conquest of Constantinople, Jews from Kasturia in Macedonia and then from Spain and Portugal between 1492 and 1497 settled here. Until the 17th century, they built synagogues named Neve Shalom, Messina and Montias. However, when these buildings burnt down in the fires in the 17th century, the Jewish community dispersed.\n\nThis area was generally unlit at night, poorly maintained and damp as it was close to the Golden Horn. Misery and filth were the most visible faces of this area. However, in the streets of Karabaş Quarter, which were far from the Golden Horn shore, there were well-kept two-storey houses around temples such as the Ahrida and Çana Synagogues, where there were wealthy merchants and modest tradesmen, boatmen, porters, and various vendors doing business on foot. Towards the end of the 19th century, Jews realised the importance of education and established schools and vocational training stalls for boys and girls. After 1908, Jewish men began to be conscripted into the army as required by law, and then aid associations for the wives of Jewish soldiers who died in the wars began to be established here. Jews in Balat Karabaş Quarter migrated to Galata in the 1920s due to better trade and prosperity. The mobilisation initiated during the World War II years and the negative impacts such as the wealth tax caused Jews to migrate to Palestine (New State of Israel). The vacant places were occupied by people from the Black Sea region and the Jews who remained in the minority moved to the vicinity of Şişli-Osmanbey. Karabaş Quarter was one of the places where maritime trade was the most intensive in İstanbul since it was a quarter along the Golden Horn. Vapur İskelesi Street and Odun İskelesi Street were the most important transport points along the area. In addition, the garbage and boat piers were also famous. As mentioned before, the open sewers that flowed openly and overflowed from time to time in these areas were converted into closed sewerage systems in 1890, and were transferred to the sea. The generally poor population was made up of peddlers, boatmen and fire-fighters. Although the houses were generally one-storeyed, there were also large two-storeyed houses rented by Jews, which became famous as Jewish houses.\n\nThe district had two famous coffeehouses named Zakeriyas and Perendeoğlu. Of these, the pious and rowdy Perendeoğlu Coffee House was mostly frequented by fire-fighters. There was a shortage of houses in this quarter due to poverty and population density. There was a Jewish slaughterhouse on Karabaş Salhane Street here. Sephardic Jews and Romaniyot Jews who started to live in Balat mingled with each other, and some of them learnt Greek and started to get along with the local Greeks. The \"Pol Yalan Synagogue\" belonging to the Romaniyot Jews, which is thought to have been built during the reign of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, and the \"Gerush Synagogue\" belonging to the Jews coming from Spain were burnt down in the Dubek fire in 1911, leaving only the foundations and were destroyed by expropriation. The previously established Alliance Schools were also burnt down in this fire. These buildings were not renovated and their students were sent to schools in Hasköy. In the past, there used to be Demir Hisar Street in the direction of Ayvansaray. A building with a high chimney and round windows was built on this street. During World War II, rumours spread about this building, which was transferred to the Meat and Fish Institution, that the Jews here would be incinerated. Therefore, the name of the building in this psychology was \"Los Ornos De Balat\" (Balat Bakeries). The Or-Ahayim Hospital, which was built during this period (1858), is still in operation. Jews would occasionally quarrel with the Greeks and Armenians living in the area. On the other hand, they got along relatively well with their Christian and Muslim neighbours. Christians used to give colourful Easter eggs to the Jews, and they used to offer \"pesah\" (doughless cookies) to the Muslims and Christians. The most valid professions in these areas were rabbis, butchers, street vendors, water carriers, milkmen, sellers of nuts and vegetables, egg sellers and fishermen, as well as Jewish fire-fighters, who were famous for their rowdy behaviour and fights, and who were also responsible for carrying the dead to the cemetery. Rabbis had the duty of preaching religious sermons, teaching Mahazke Torah and Ralmud Torah, reconciling quarrels, and protecting from the evil eye. Jewish taverns were also famous. In addition to drinking, there was live music. In addition, cards games and music were played in coffeehouses. The regulars of these places were hoodlums, fire-fighters and street vendors. According to 1948 data, there were 80 coffee houses and 20 taverns in Balat.\n\nIn the Republican Period, as the Jews evacuated these areas, they were replaced by people from various regions of our country, who were engaged in trade, along with the people from the Black Sea region (boatmen). In this process, 2 million square metres of the Golden Horn, which was originally 6 million square metres, was occupied. And 622 factories and hundreds of houses were built on the occupied area. Leather manufacturing, paddy, liquid oil cleaning agents and a number of workshops settled along the coast and started to pollute the Golden Horn with their production. There had been various attempts to clean the polluted Golden Horn since 1943 until Bedrettin Dalan became the Mayor of İstanbul Municipality, but no action was taken. For the first time during Bedrettin Dalan's term, the buildings on the edge of the Golden Horn were demolished and removed together with the Balat Karabaş Quarter in 1987. Afterwards, Mr Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who became the Mayor of İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality, had the wastewater flowing into the Golden Horn pumped to the bottom of the Marmara Sea by means of collectors, and 5 million tonnes of sludge accumulated in the Golden Horn was pumped to the quarries on the Black Sea coast. Afterwards, by transferring water from the Black Sea, he restored the Golden Horn to marine life.\n\nRoman and Byzantine Period\n\nThe most important place in this area is the Crooked Gate (Porta Kaligaria). Its history dates back to before the construction of the famous Theodosius Walls. Before the walls were built, this was a small settlement surrounded by walls. It consisted of a church in the middle, a public bath called Nympheior, a theatre, a lusarion (playground), a bridge and two large porticos (covered, with columns in front and on the sides and under open arches), two bakeries, five bread shops, eleven streets and avenues and one hundred and sixty-seven buildings, surrounded by walls facing the Golden Horn from the slope. To the south of the Crooked Gate, close to today's Landlord's Palace, there was a small palace used by the emperors at that time and a few settlements around it. The basis for the establishment of this district was the shoe factory of that day (Kaligaria - Sandal). This gave its name to both the gate of the district and the district itself. This area was later enclosed by combining the sea walls with the land walls (Theodosius Walls). While this small settlement was included in the land walls, the Kaligoria Gate was preserved. Outside the Landlord's Palace, which was built seven hundred years after the construction of the city walls, a ditch was built for protection purposes up to the starting point of the slope descending to the Golden Horn.\n\nGoing back to the Crooked Gate, the Ottomans called this gate \"Crooked Gate\" after the conquest because it was not located on a plane in terms of entry and exit to the city, but in a crooked way, while this gate was combined with the land walls or due to the effect of earthquakes that occurred later.\n\nMany churches and palaces were built between the Crooked Gate and Ayvansaray. For example, the palaces named Anastatisos, Danubios, Okeanos built in this area were united under the name Blachernai Palace. Like the Ancient Rome, the New Rome (Neva Roma) was also governed by regions. In this respect, this place corresponded to the second part of the 14th region. In order to meet the needs of the animals and churches in the region, there was a major water problem in the higher parts of the region. After the construction of Landlord's Palace, the walls between Landlord's Palace and Ayvansaray, between Anemas Palace and Toklu İbrahim Dede Tomb were rebuilt and fortified.\n\nSince the location and defence of the Crooked Gate was weak compared to the other gates of the city (its sloping and hard ground did not allow the digging of a trench), the Avars in 626 and the Latins in 1204 managed to enter the city through this gate. So much so that the Latins built a church named St. Nicolaus here as a token of gratitude for allowing the Latins to enter the city. After the looting and destruction activities of the Latins, there was a difference of understanding in art and religion in Byzantium. Art was relatively revived, and according to the changing religious and world view, the isolation of the monasteries was ended and they became more open to the society. Starting in 1261, this understanding continued with the restoration of churches and monasteries during and after the reign of Michael VIII Paleologos and the Emperors started to use the Blachernai Palace. To the south of the Crooked Gate is the Avcibey Quarter. What made this quarter important in the Byzantine Period was the Kariye Museum (Chora Church) and the Panagia Hançerlotissa Church. These were the highest and most spacious parts of the city. Since it was relatively secluded, it was favourable for religious buildings such as monasteries.\n\nTo the north of the Crooked Gate is the Ayvansaray Quarter with its former name. Ayvansaray was a district where courtiers and nobles lived during the Byzantine Period and it was the extension of the Blachernia Palace. The name Ayvansaray is derived from the fact that there were cellars in this district dating back to Byzantine times, and animals brought from hot countries were kept in these cellars during the Ottoman Period. According to a rumour, it is said that the people called this place \"Animal Palace\" because of this situation. According to another opinion, the people called it \"Iwan Palace\" because of the arched and high Byzantine Palace located in this area. Ayvansaray Quarter, located within the land walls on the shore of the Golden Horn, is one of the places where Byzantine and Ottoman cultural heritage are intertwined. After the Conquest, the quarter quickly acquired the identity of a Turkish quarter and was inhabited by workers, small tradesmen, seafarers and fishermen. The name of this area was known as \"Blaharnia\", derived from the \"blehron\" (wild mint) or \"bleho\" (fern) that grew abundantly in this area or from the \"laherna\" (acorn) that lived abundantly on the banks of the Golden Horn at that time. In 626, during the sieges of the Avars, the Theotokoston Blahernon (Blachernia) Church, where Mary's dress (Maphorion) was preserved at the end of the Golden Horn shores in Ayvansaray, which was outside the walls of Ureodosius II during the sieges of the Avars, was taken under protection by Emperor Heraclius in 626 by expanding the Golden Horn walls of Ayvansaray. Byzantine Emperors used to live in their palaces in the place called Sarayburnu until the 11th century. However, in this century, due to the Turkish danger in the east, especially after Emperor Alexios Komnenos ascended the throne in 1180, the great palace in the south of the Hippodrome was abandoned and they started to move to the palaces in the Ayvansaray Region. Since the state officials settled in this region together with the emperors, it turned into a region where nobles lived. As the emperors and statesmen stayed in the region, its defence became more important. On the west side of Ayvansaray, which was difficult to defend in terms of land and sea sides, a fortress tower (a reinforced tower built just outside the walls for the defence of the castle gates) was built by Leon V in 813 on the place where Toklu İbrahim Dede Tomb is located today. Today, Toklu İbrahim Dede's cemetery and masjid are located in this inner castle. In the last great earthquake of İstanbul, one of the towers of this inner fortress, which contained the tomb of the king's daughter, was destroyed. The name of this inner fortress in the Byzantine Period was 'Peterion'. Emperor Emanuel Komnenos (1143-1180) built the single-storey city walls starting from the edge of the Landlord's Palace towards the Golden Horn and extending to the Heraclius walls at the tip of Ayvansaray. From the point where these land and sea walls meet, a wall descending steeply towards the Golden Horn was built. This wall was demolished in 1868 and the connection between the castle and the coast was provided by the xyloporta (wooden gate).\n\nFrom the western part of the wall extending from the end of the Ayvansaray city walls towards the Golden Horn (north direction), there was a quarter that grew towards Eyüp Sultan-Defterdar Quarter. As of the 12th century, what made the quarter important was the presence of a pier that allowed the emperors to reach the Blakhernia Palace. After this pier, the Blakhernia gate of the palace was accessed. Another feature of this quarter was the fact that Justianus II (527-565) had built a church in the name of the Virgin Mary and churches named Frisfos and Nicolas, and that this was the necropolis (cemetery) area of the period. As a matter of fact, two column capitals with very fine workmanship were found during the excavation of the foot of the III Golden Horn Bridge built here in 1972.\n\nAgain, the small vaulted, ceramic-covered, painted grave chambers in the Tokmaktepe Fatih Cemetery, which rises towards the south-east after the plain of the Golden Horn, tell us that these are cemeteries. The name of the region is Ya Vedûd (Loving, desiring the good of all creatures and bestowing it to them). It is rumoured that when İstanbul was besieged and conquered, a person whom Allah loved living in the Walled City devoted himself to worship in Hagia Sophia. This person was Sheikh Abdül-Vedûd from Bukhara. Allah did not allow the conquest of Constantinople for the sake of this person until the 50th day of the siege, the day of his death. Constantinople could be conquered only after Abdul-Wadûd died. When Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror visited Hagia Sophia after the conquest, he saw the luminous body of this holy person in the place called \"sweating pillar\". Knowing the sanctity of the person, the clergy wanted to wash the body immediately, and when the sound of the body being washed came from the direction of the \"sweating pillar\", the people there took the body to Ayvansaray Tokmaktepe by sea. And upon the sound of \"Ya Vedûd\" coming from a grave already dug there, the body of this holy person was buried there and henceforth the name of this quarter became \"Ya Vedûd\". This area between the walls of Ayvansaray and the Third Golden Horn Bridge was both a cemetery and a quarter. The cemetery extended to the foot of Tokmak Tepe. There was also a orchard fountain in this area. Until 1972, there were 2 masjids, 2 water scales, 1 primary school, 2 mills, 8 fountains, 2 piers, 2 water closets, 1 flour and bulgur mill, 2 dervish lodges, 1 tannery, 2 baths and 2 cemeteries in this quarter. As a result of the expropriations made for the construction of the Third Golden Horn Bridge, some of the monuments in this area were moved, some of them were abandoned, some of them were demolished and buried in the ground, and some of them are still there today. During the period from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic, \"Ya Vedûd\" was a charming coastal quarter with its streets consisting of two-storey houses next to the cypress trees rising from the cemetery.\n\nOttoman Period\n\nAyvansaray Region was a place where palaces and churches were densely located during the Byzantine Period. Especially the Landlord's Palace, being the highest hill of Walled İstanbul, was the place where the humidity was the lowest and the air was the cleanest. However, in the late Byzantine period, like almost every other part of the city, this place had fallen into disrepair. Despite this, it was one of the most densely populated places, especially by Orthodox Greeks. After the Conquest, similar to other districts, Islamisation and Turkification started in this district in terms of architecture and population. In this context, many fountains, schools, madrasas, masjids, mosques, lodges and civil architectural buildings were built in this region. In this process, some churches that had fallen into disuse and ruins were converted into masjids and mosques, while new ones were started to be built in some other places.\n\nAyvansaray Gate\n\nIt is at the westernmost part of the city walls in the direction of the Golden Horn. Some of the city wall gates are civilian and some are military. Ayvansaray Gate is a civilian gate and was built in times of war. This gate was located right at the foot of Ayvansaray Masjid. However, the exact location of the gate is not known today.\n\nAyvansaray Bridge\n\nAccording to the notes of travellers and Byzantine sources, there was a wooden bridge between Hasköy and Ayvansaray.\n\nBalaban Agha Quarter\n\nIt is the area surrounded by Fethibey Street on the west, Vidinli Tevfik Pasha, Vezneciler and Darülfünun Streets on the north, Beyazıt Mosque Square on the east, and Ordu Street on the south.\n\nName of the Quarter\n\nThe quarter was named after Balaban Agha, the Sekban chief of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, who participated in the conquest of İstanbul. Sekban was a military class in the Ottoman army serving along the borders. The Sekbanbaşı was the commander of this class. When Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror ascended to the throne, he abolished the Janissary Agha in order to punish the Janissaries who committed acts of disorder during the coronation ceremony and had this duty assigned to the Sekbanbaşı. Thus, the Janissary Agha remained under Sekbanbaşı until the reign of Sultan Selim I the Grim. Probably Sekbanbaşı Balaban Agha built the masjid, which is known by his name and gives its name to the quarter, during the period when he held these two positions together. Balaban Agha had the Balaban Agha Masjid built in the 1475s on today's Vidinli Tevfik Pasha Street by converting it from an old Byzantine monument into a mosque. The masjid was open for worship until 1911. The masjid burnt down in the great fire of that year, but a new one was not built in its place, and between 1920-30 it was gradually demolished and a road was built over it. During the excavations carried out by the American-Byzantine Institute in the 1930s, it was found that this monument was an oval building with a diameter of 10.60 metres and that there were 6 cells with a grave in each of them and that there was a dome standing on 6 legs at the top. While this Christian Tomb was converted into a mosque, it was understood that the graves in the crypt were kept intact. During this transformation phase, a half-moon shaped last congregation place was added to the building. Balaban Aga's grave was also removed together with the masjid.\n\nBalat Quarter\n\nIt is the area surrounded by Sarayağası Street, Fethiye Street and Zülüflü Street to the west, Hacı İbrahim, Kalpakçı Çeşmesi, Tatlı Memba Streets and Ayan Street to the north, Vodina Street and Hızır Çavuş Köprübaşı Street to the north, Golden Horn and Fener İskele Yolu Street to the east, Soğuk Tulumba Street, Camcı Çeşme Slope to the southeast, Yavuz Selim Street to the south, Manyasizade Street and Mehmetağa Mosque Street to the southwest.\n\nThis area of Balat Quarter, which is located in the northeast of the Historic Peninsula, includes the Fatih Girls' Anatolian Imam Hatip High School, Aspar (Çarşamba Çukurbostan) Cistern, Yavuz Sultan Selim Mosque, its cemetery and Sultan Selim Girls' Vocational High School, and extends to the east of the Golden Horn with a sharp slope, while the northeast direction of Sultan Selim Girls' Vocational High School extends to Vodina Street with the same slope as Camcı Slope.\n\nThe eastern parts of Manyasizade and Fethiye Streets, together with Kiremit Street, descend to Vodina Street with a steep slope, and from there, it meets the Golden Horn with a relatively flat area. As can be understood, our quarter was established on the northeastern slope of the Historic Peninsula facing the Golden Horn. Although Balat Quarter was outside the walls built by Constantine I, it was later included within the walls built by Theodosius II. It was located in the 14th region in the city administration established in this period. In 2008, with the decision taken by Fatih Municipality Council, Hatip Muslihittin, Tevkii Cafer, Kâtip Muslihittin, Hızır Çavuş and Tahta Minare Quarters were merged under the name of Balat Quarter. When our city was called Byzantion, the Fener District of our quarter consisted of a rocky slope descending steeply to the Golden Horn. It was probably dominated by a vegetation according to the climate dominated by the transition from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. While the Golden Horn was an extension of the sea rich in fish, especially bonito, agricultural activities and fishing were carried out on its relatively flat land.\n\nRoman and Byzantine Period\n\nThe name of the lighthouse is rumoured to be derived from 'petrion' (rocky) because it is rocky (Petrion) or from 'Fener' because there is a lighthouse on the ledge extending into the Golden Horn. During the Byzantine Period, there was a castle here for defence purposes. The quarter formed around the castle (petrion) was called the Petrion Quarter. There was also an Ayia Eufemi Church in this quarter. With the sea walls starting from Ayvansaray, Fener District was annexed to Constantinople in 345. These walls were built at a short distance from the sea.\n\nFener District was an important pier of this district of the city in terms of maritime transportation. Emperors would disembark at Fener Pier to go to Blaknerai (Blaherna) Palace, and from there they would reach the palace by road. Since the hills of Constantinople had a very wide topography, the sea route was more convenient for transport. Because of this superiority in transport, Fener was popular. This superiority contributed to the development of the Fener District.\n\nWhen the Eastern Roman Empire adopted Christianity as the official religion, all pagan temples in Constantinople were demolished and converted into churches. In fact, the stones that could be used in the church construction of the temples in the places under the rule of the Roman Empire, columns, column spaces, stones used for arches and many other processed materials were taken from different locations and transported to Constantinople. In addition to the temples, they built squares, avenues, baths, aqueducts (Valens) and cisterns to meet the water needs of the city.\n\nIn addition, the most exquisite examples of Byzantine civil architecture were constructed in these places. However, all these reconstruction efforts of Byzantium were subjected to a great looting and destruction with the Latin Invasion of 1204. This was partly caused by the inhabitants of Fener. Because when the Latins besieged Constantinople, the inhabitants of Fener, who had good commercial relations with the Venetians at the time, did not stand against the Latin attack and were rewarded for allowing the invasion in the form of rape, destruction and looting. After this event, the Byzantine Empire moved to Nicaea, and when the Byzantine Empire returned to recapture the city in 1261, Emperor Michael VIII set fire to the quarter near the Golden Horn where the Latins lived. The Byzantine Empire began to experience the most vulnerable period of its history. The financially weak state was unable to maintain the city as before, and those who left the city during the Latin Invasion never returned. The city became deserted from district to district due to neglect, and this situation lasted until the conquest of Constantinople (1453). During the conquest, some 70 ships were launched into the Golden Horn by land. Despite the efforts of the Byzantines, the navy could not be burned and on the morning of 6 April, the Turkish navy sailed inside the Topkapı Walls, while the navy in the Golden Horn under the command of Zağnos Pasha made a landing at Fener.\n\nOttoman Period\n\nThe conquest of Constantinople, which was praised by our Prophet (pbuh), was bestowed to Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror. On the morning of 6 April, while the land forces of the Ottoman Empire entered the city through the passages opened in Topkapı with the cannons that had not been cast in that size until then, the naval forces in 70 ships launched from the land entered Constantinople from the Fener Coast under the command of Zağanos Mehmet Pasha. Constantinople had not recovered after the Latin invasion and was in a poor, ruined, desolate and restless state. After the conquest, a rapid reconstruction activity was initiated and basic rights such as freedom of religion and belief, inviolability of property, right to work and a fair city administration was introduced for everyone regardless of race, language and religion. After the conquest, Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque and after the first Friday prayers, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, who saw that the patriarch did not come to visit him, asked the Patriarchate why the patriarch did not come to him, and the Patriarchate learnt that the patriarch Anastasios II was alive, but he resigned because he did not wish Constantine XI to interfere in religious affairs. Thereupon, Mehmed the Conqueror brought Scholarius Gennadios, who was against the union with the Vatican, to İstanbul and elected Gennadios as patriarch by putting pressure on the Spiritual Assembly of the Orthodox Church. In addition, after this election, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited the patriarch to dinner, authorised him with the title of 'Head of the Nation' in religious and sectarian affairs, and supported him by giving him the 'Patriarchal Scepter' (as the Byzantine Emperors had done) as a sign of these privileges. He then escorted him to the palace gate and saw him off to the patriarchate. All this was the same as the Byzantine Patriarchal ceremonies.\n\nSultan Mehmed the Conqueror also gave the Patriarch an \"Emanname\", which defined the legal status of the Orthodox community in accordance with Turkish Islamic Law. This edict included the following provisions; \"Let no one dominate the Patriarch, let no one, no matter who he is, interfere with him, let him and the priests in his entourage be exempt from all kinds of public services for life. Their churches shall not be converted into mosques. Marriage, burial and other customs shall be carried out according to the Greek Church and customs as they were before.\" These rights were renewed by all sultans from this date onwards.\n\nAfter this event, the rapid reconstruction of Constantinople was initiated. First of all, people were brought from Anatolia to revitalise the city. Some of them were settled around the Church of the Twelve Apostles. When the Muslim population of the city increased, the Patriarchate was relocated to the Pammakaristos Monastery (where the Fethiye Mosque stands today) near the Çarşamba District. After 131 years of administering the religious affairs of the Orthodox community from this place, it was moved first to the Wallachian Mansion in Fener, from there to the Church of Hagia Dimitri in Balat, and from there to the Monastery of Hagios Georgi (Hagios Georgios) in 1602. This area, called Fener Kapısı Quarter, was one of the quarters that did not have a mosque and included today's Abdi Subaşı, Tahta Minare and Tevkii Cafer quarters. In Ekrem Hakkı Ayverdi's words, this district was called \"Semt-i Meş- hura Âlem\". Greeks, Serbs and captives who left the city during the war after the conquest were allowed to settle in the Fener Region. Nevertheless, when the city could not reach the desired population density, the Christian Greek and Armenian communities in the newly conquered places (such as the people of science and knowledge in the Peloponnese) were settled in İstanbul in the form of exile with a fatwa edict. Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror thus became the Kayser-i Rum (Caesar of Rome). In other words, he also accepted the rulership of Rome. This meant that Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror was the Sultan of all the peoples living under Roman (Greek) sovereignty. Greeks lived in the area extending from the border of Cibali Quarter to the border of Küçükmustafapaşa Quarter along the coast and to Manyasizade and Fethiye Streets in the west. Their families were employed in both religious and bureaucratic positions, as well as in skilled professions such as bankers, sailors, merchants and goldsmiths. The architecture of the houses they lived in consisted of thick stone walls, small windows with large thick iron bars in front of them, bay windows standing on consoles and depictions of animals in front of them, arched doors disproportionate to the size of the building, unlike Turkish houses, which were generally made of wooden materials. The buildings had two or three storeys and were adjacent to each other. Bay windows would usually protrude from the second floors onto the street. Some of the families living in this area originated from the Byzantine aristocracy and they used to live in ostentatious mansions. They were quite wealthy. They were treated like kings by their servants, and they lived and consoled themselves with this respect that reflected the splendour of their past. When they came from the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman administration appointed them to the administration of the provinces of Moldava and Wallachia. The gunsmith's parsonage in Fener was one of the most central bazaars in İstanbul at that time. Kalafathane on the Golden Horn Coast and Mumhane near the Balat Gate were the most active bazaars of the district. In such places, they were small-scale tradesmen, merchants, craftsmen, sailors, fishermen, shoemakers, carpenters and journeymen. They used to run taverns and cabarets in partnership with Jews. The people of Fener attached importance to education and raised their children in important education centres of the time such as Italy. In this way, they would learn Turkish, Arabic and many European languages, which would enable them to advance in business life and take important positions in the state, such as translators for the Imperial Council and the Navy. When Italian lost its dominance as the lingua franca to French, the Greeks of Fener started to learn French. Those who could not go abroad were educated in local schools. These schools were the Greek Erbeh High School (Red School) and the Greek Girls' High School (Ioakimyon Girls' High School). Despite this, according to a study conducted by Charleswhite in 1844, the literacy rate of Greeks was not higher than that of Turks. Some of the Greek families who served the Ottoman Empire were the Gikas, Kalimakis, Garagras, Sutsus, Ipsilantis, Mozugis, Rallis, Hangerites and Rosettis. These were families who took part in the administration of Wallachia and Moldavia in the 18th and 19th centuries. The most important structure of Balat Quarter on the Golden Horn was the ferry pier. This pier was between Abdi Subaşı and Tahta Minare quarters. Those who disembarked from here travelled all the way to the patriarchate. This place was called Fener Road and the pier was called Fener Pier. There was a two-storey mansion above the ferry pier in the 19th and 20th centuries. This mansion was a flamboyant building above the waters of the Golden Horn and had a function as a mixture of a pub and a coffee house (casino). From time to time, the feet of the people living on the lower floor would get wet with the waters of the Golden Horn caused by the waves of the ferries passing through the Golden Horn. On the left side of the Fener Pier, there used to be a boat dock descended by three steps. Boatmen used to carry passengers to Kasımpaşa via this pier. Since it was on the edge of the Golden Horn, Fener was also a place of entertainment. Since the possibility of travelling far was very limited, those who wanted to come to the square where Silahtar, Kâğıthane and today's Fener Police Station were located used to travel by boat. Especially on summer nights, this place was ideal for cooling off and having fun under the moonlight. Opposite the Fener Police Station, there was a customs building on the right side of the 3x3 metre ferry pier. The first official fire brigade was established in a location called Kılburnu. This unit, which was established after the fire brigades, had fire extinguishing vehicles towed by horses. These vehicles were equipped with hand pumps, hoses, buckets, ladders and tools used in fire extinguishing.\n\nAnother feature of this quarter was its taverns. This culture, which did not exist in Muslim quarters, was available in the Christian quarter of Fener. There were four regular taverns named Sakiyas, Gümüş, Halkalı Kamburoğlu and Taşanaki. There were two more taverns named Sakızlı and Kafesli in the vicinity of Kiremit Street. However, as the demographic structure changed, none of these have survived to the present day. The casino next to the Fener Pier was also closed in 1943. One of the important businesses in the courtyard of the church was the production of baptismal oil. This oil is sacred because it is used in religious rituals. Therefore, its production was carried out in accordance with traditional methods and in strict adherence to these methods. This oil, which represented the spiritual and political power of the Patriarchate, was prepared in large cauldrons over a period of several days, day and night, using sacred objects (such as books, icons, prayer books, etc.) as fuel, and then carefully filled into bottles and sent to all the churches of the entire Orthodox sphere. This product, which was an important source of income for the Patriarchate, is the reason why many sacred objects of historical value have not survived to the present day (due to their incineration). The Patriarchate ceased to produce this baptismal oil with the foundation of the Republic.\n\nThe Patriarchate also has a story of a middle gate that has been closed since 1821: After the conquest of İstanbul, the Greeks, who had gained a strong legal support with the \"Emanname\" of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, soon became rich through trade. These rich people also had influence over the Orthodox clergy because of their financial aid to the Patriarch. Moreover, in the eyes of the Renaissance movement that began to rise in the West, these rich people were highly respected because they were the descendants of Ancient Greece. Having become rich through their trade with Europeans, the people of Fener enrolled their children in Western academies and universities in order to reach the same level of culture as the Westerners. The desire for a new Hellenism was alive in the hearts and minds of these people of Fener. However, this desire, which reminded idolatry (Elen), with the acceptance of Christianity by Eastern Rome, was not accepted by the Orthodox. However, the persistent efforts of the wealthy people of Fener yielded results and the name of the church was changed to the Greek Orthodox Church. With Greek Orthodoxy, efforts were being made to establish a new Roman Empire by Greekising other races. At that time, the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia accepted Ottoman rule in order to guarantee their autonomy. Since the churches of these Principalities were affiliated to the Orthodox Patriarchate in İstanbul, Hellenist merchants (rich people) bought land, opened academies and schools, and organised various conferences and seminars to spread Hellenic culture in these areas. The foundation of the Eastern Roman Empire began to be laid here. A Megalo Idea and organisation (Ethniki Eteria) was formed. The aim was to revive the Byzantine Empire under the leadership of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of İstanbul. Patriarch Gregorios, many metropolitans and clergymen were involved in this endeavour. Finally, the efforts carried out in Rumelia and İstanbul bore fruit and on 12 February 1821, a rebellion was launched in Mera. However, Benderli Ali Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the time, who followed these events with strong intelligence, informed Sultan Mahmut II about the treachery of the Greek officials from Fener working in foreign affairs and the support of the British, French and Russian embassies to the rebellion. Patriarch Gregorios was then interrogated. When he confessed his guilt, he was executed on 22 April 1821 by hanging in the middle door of the Patriarchate with a treason label on his chest. Subsequently, the traitors who had participated in the same crime with him, the Greek Beys of Fener, were also hanged. The new Patriarch, who was elected after this, protested this event by locking this door. There is a painting of Patriarch Gregorios on the inner side of the door and Grand Vizier Benderli Ali Pasha Street on the outer side. The door, popularly known as the \"Grudge Gate\", has been closed for 200 years.\n\nBeyazıt Quarter\n\nIt is the area surrounded by the borders of Şeker Ahmet Paşa Street and Tığcılar Street to the north, Çarşı Kapı and Kalpakçılar Streets to the south, Çarşıkapı Nur-u Osmaniye Street and Kürkçüler Çarşısı Street to the southeast, Çuhacı Hanı Street to the east, Çadırcılar Street to the west and Bakırcılar Street to the northwest.\n\nBeyazıt District has been the 3rd most active hill of the Historical Peninsula in all periods of history from Byzantium to İstanbul. It is a square that has been active for about 2 thousand years. For about 800 years, from Byzantium to Roman times, the area extending from the old Thracian gate (one of the exit gates of the city at that time) to Laleli, Fatih and Süleymaniye, where the tomb of Mahmut II is located, was a 'necropolis' (cemetery). The largest forum of the city in the Byzantine Period and one of the palace squares of the city in the Ottoman Period were here.\n\nSince then, it has been the historical, cultural and commercial square of the Walled City. It has hosted these activities throughout history. Beyazıt District was a sub-district of Eminönü district in the last periods of the Ottoman Empire. It was named after the complex built there by Sultan Bayezıt II. Since Theodosius I organised this square in the most comprehensive way during the Roman Period, it was called \"Theodosius Forum\" at that time. Theodosius I was the last emperor who officially converted Rome from Paganism to Christianity and ruled both Rome at the same time. After his great struggles against paganism, he divided the empire among his sons before he died in Milona. Ten months after his death, his body was brought to İstanbul and buried (395). Another name of the square was \"Tauri\". It means Tauros (bull). It was rumoured that a cattle market was held here at certain times. It is also thought that this name was used because there were bronze bull head statues on the triumphal arch built by Theodosius. According to another rumour, there was a large hollow bull statue made of bronze or copper in the square. After the criminals were put inside, they were executed with a fire lit from below. Thus, another name derived from these rumours was \"Tauri Square\".\n\nBeyazit Square in the Ottoman Period\n\nAfter the Conquest, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror had a palace built on a large part of this square, which was later known as the Atik Palace. Thus, the empty part of the shrinking square turned into Sarayönü Square. Since the trees in this part of the square, which were in a densely spaced arrangement, allowed robbers to work easily, a large part of them were ordered by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror to be cut down. In addition, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror had his first coin mint built in the place known as the \"Simkeşhane\". Afterwards, his son Sultan Beyazıt II had the second complex of the city built in this place after the Conquest. The complex included a mosque, madrasah, almshouse, caravansary, school for boys, bathhouse and the tomb of the sultan. The area between the complex and the mint was one of the busiest places in the city. In addition, entertainments including juggling, animal taming, magician and conjuring shows were organised in this area and in time it turned into a public entertainment centre.\n\nIn 1580 Mimar Sinan built shops on the side of the mosque facing the road, and in the 17th century these were followed by single-storey wooden shops selling stationery. Subsequently, housing started to be built in the square and it was so densely built that it was only possible to carry wedding goods from the square for Fatma Sultan's wedding by demolishing the eaves of the houses. The square was again hit by fires and earthquakes during this period. In the 18th century, it turned into a market where sacrificial animals were sold and the south part was reserved for the activities of permanent butchers. In this century, important buildings such as the \"Simkeşhane\" (Mint), Hasan Pasha Inn, Ragıp Pasha Tomb, Laleli Complex with its school and library were built on both sides of Ordu Street descending from the square to Aksaray. In addition to these buildings, it is worth remembering the presence of many shops tailored to the needs. During the reign of Mahmut II, the Aga Gate, which became vacant after the abolition of the Janissaries Guild, was allocated to the Shaykh al-islam. The Old Palace was deemed appropriate as the command centre of the \"Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye\" Army, which was formed to replace the Janissary Guild. The remaining parts of the palace were demolished and converted into the Seraskier's Office. The courtyard walls of the Beyazıt Mosque were demolished so that the soldiers could train comfortably. A Sultan's Mansion was built for Sultan Mahmut II so that he could observe military ceremonies under today's Çınaraltı. The building, which later became derelict due to neglect, was demolished by the municipality in 1930.\n\nBeyazıt Square from the Tanzimat Reform Period to the Republic\n\nAfter Mahmut II organised Atik Palace as the military headquarters, the building was demolished during the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz. In its place, the \"Daire-i Umur-i Askeriye\", which would fulfil the same function and only had a different name, was constructed. Its gate was built by the French architect Bourgeois in the Serazan style (the gate of today's university campus) (1866). In the same year, the garden wall on the Bakırcılar Street front was completed. The mansions of Ali and Fuat Pashas, important pashas of the Tanzimat Reform Period, were also located in this military area. Fuat Pasha's mansion was on the west side of this complex, which would later serve as the Ministry of War. The mansion was first allocated to the Ministry of Finance and then to the Faculty of Pharmacy of İstanbul University. In addition to the military and political assets added to the square, cultural exhibitions were opened in the mosque courtyard during Ramadan. These exhibitions, specially held for Ramadan, were a continuation of the Direklerarası. The first pharmacy of İstanbul was also opened opposite \"Simkeşhane\" (Mint) during this period. This pharmacy was like a clinic where two physicians, two of whom were operators, served every night.\n\nBeyazıt Square was reorganised with the establishment of \"Şehremaneti\" (Municipal Administration) in 1855. After the abandoned almshouse building to the east of the square was allocated to the use of horse-drawn carriage coachmen, it was converted into a library by Sultan Abdülhamit II in 1884. Along with the library (Beyazıt Public Library), booksellers and paper sellers also started to make their presence in the square. The mansion to the west of this square, built in the 19th century, was the residence of Yusuf Kamil Pasha and Zeynep Hanım. It later became one of the first Muslim orphanages in İstanbul between 1903 and 1909. \"Darülfü-nun-i Osmani\", which replaced the \"Darülfünun-i Şahane\" established in 1909, started its education activities in the Zeynep Hatun Mansion. Thus, the square started to transform from its current state into an academic structure. When the building burnt down in 1942, today's Science and Literature Faculties were built in its place.\n\nDuring the reign of Abdülhamid I, the square was visited by a large number of people, attracted by the Grand Bazaar next to it. Due to this density, the square was filled with vendors such as kebab shops, barbershops, paper vendor huts and peddlers. The square hosted many military and political events during and after the Constitutional Monarchy Period, and many ceremonies and executions took place in this square. This square witnessed events such as:\n\nMass executions during the 31 March Incident\n\nOccupation of the Ministry of War by the Movement Army led by Mahmut Şevket Pasha\n\nThe shooting of Şevket Pasha at this place on 11 June 1913\n\nThe landing of our pilot Mehmet Ali, who received flight training in England and Germany, at this place upon the request of Enver Pasha\n\nInbringing of a wooden model 32 calibre cannon from Austria in the early years of World War I for ceremonial purposes and its placement in front of the Ministry of War, and the bombing of this square by British aeroplanes during the war years, mistaking it for a real cannon.\n\nBeyazıt Square in the Republican Period\n\nIn the early years of the Republic, Ali Haydar Bey, the Mayor of the city, had the square reorganised by the architect Asım Bey. Accordingly, the shabby shops and trees blocking the road were removed. The centre of the square was arranged as a pool with a fountain and the surrounding area was organised as a roundabout (1926).\n\nTrams and carriages used to circulate around the pool and from there go down to Aksaray. However, in 1930, Lütfi Kırdar, the Governor and Mayor of İstanbul, had the French city planner Henri Prost prepare a masterplan for the Historic Peninsula. In 1956, according to this plan, Beyazıt Square was demolished for reorganisation. According to the new plan, the shabby shops and coffee houses around the madrasah were removed. Embankment walls and new latrines were placed in various parts of the square. In 1939, Beyazıt Madrasah, which was renovated after the buildings around it were demolished, was allocated to the municipality as a museum and library. In 1945, when the museum department was moved to Gazanfer Aga Madrasah, only the library remained in this place. Afterwards, it was transformed into the Museum of Foundation Calligraphy. In the continuation of the new organisation works, the buildings to the west of the mosque were demolished and the square was thoroughly widened. Beyazıt Square gradually evolved from its political and military identity to its cultural and educational identity. This transformation can be seen in new establishments such as the Municipal Library, Beyazıt Library, Institute of Turkic Studies, Sahaflar, Çınaraltı, Küllük Kahvesi and the Foundation Calligraphy Museum. Taking this transformation one step further, the Old War Ministry Building was assigned to İstanbul University in 1933 and the Science and Literature Faculties were built in place of the burnt down Zeynep Hanım Mansion. In 1957, 127 buildings along with the historical buildings and the pool in the square were demolished in order to find a solution to the traffic congestion, and the area around the mosque and Ordu Street was transformed into its present state.\n\nAs for the coffee houses in Beyazıt... The tradition of coffeehouse started during the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. In the courtyard of the Beyazıt Mosque, coffee makers used to serve coffee to those who came to prayers. At that time, coffee was a means of conversation. Then coffee became a part of intellectual and cultural life. This was followed by Çınaraltı Coffee Houses and Küllük. These places became the hangouts of literature enthusiasts, intellectuals and writers and illustrators etc. The Sahaflar (Booksellers) Bazaar is also an important part of the square. This bazaar used to be located in the Sandal Covered Bazaar and the Cevahir Covered Bazaar within the Grand Bazaar, but was moved to its present location due to the damage to the Grand Bazaar during the earthquake of 1894. This place used to be the place of \"hakkaks\" (wood carvers). After the Second Constitutional Monarchy, when the hakkaks (wood carvers) vacated this bazaar and went to the Grand Bazaar, the booksellers moved into their place. In 1950, a fire broke out in a clockmaker's shop and 15 shops of the booksellers were completely burnt down and 5 shops were partially burnt down. In 1952, the bazaar was rebuilt and has survived to the present day. Beyazıt Square was the place where anti-government demonstrations were frequently held during the Democrat Party rule. After the 1960 coup d'état, its name was changed to Hürriyet Square in reference to these demonstrations. Later, with the coup d'état of 12 September 1980, the name was changed back to Beyazıt Square. After this date, the square fell into a political silence until the mid-90s. It was mostly used by peddlers and second-hand book sellers on weekends. After this date, the square once again became a venue for political protests. In recent years, it has hosted IMM's Ramadan events and the Turkish Culture and Book Fair organised by the Türkiye Diyanet Foundation.\n\nHaseki Sultan Quarter\n\nIt is the area surrounded by Kızılelma Street to the northwest, Turgut Özal Millet Street to the northeast, Hekimoğlu Alipaşa and Cerrahpaşa Streets to the south and Haseki Kadın Street to the west. Haseki Sultan Quarter was formed by merging Eski Nevbahar, Keyçi Hatun and Haseki Sultan Quarters.\n\nByzantion Period\n\nIt forms a part of the hill region of the topography rising from the historical Lycos Creek Valley (now Vatan Street) towards the southwest and descending towards the Marmara Sea and one of the seven hills of Fatih. Our quarter was founded during the reign of Emperor I. Constantine's Agora of Byzantion (Tutrastoon of Septemus Severus) or the Tauri Form (today's Beyazıd Square) of the famous Mese Road (Divan Road), which started from the Million Stone, passed through the Capitol of Constantinus in the west direction, and was situated to the north of the historical road, one of which ran north parallel to the Golden Horn to the city's Poliyandri Gate (Edirne Gate) and the other to the west, passing through the Bovis Forum in present-day Aksaray Square and the Arkadius Form further west, reaching Porta Aura, the city's gateway to the Balkans via Via Egnatis. Our quarter, which was within the city walls built by Conorders ostantine I, was also within the boundaries of the 11th district in the city administration plan implemented in this period.\n\nByzantine Period\n\nOne of the four famous forums (squares) established in the Byzantine Period was on the site of the present-day Haseki Sultan Complex. The square, whose first name was Theodosius, was later called Arcadius. During this period, the name of the district was Xerolophos. This district, which was considered to be the centre of Constantinople, was an area where settlement was not dense where agriculture was carried out. The most important monument that made this square famous was the Column of Arcadiusand the statue on top of it. As the name suggests, the column was built by Emperor Arcadius in 403 in honour of his father, the Emperor, who won victories against the Goths and Scythians. Later, Theodosius II placed a statue of his father Arcadius on a horse on the top of this column in 421.\n\nIt is known that the column, whose balcony at the top could be reached by a staircase from inside, was around 50 metres tall. There were also reliefs on the column related to the triumphs. However, the gold-plated arm of the Statue of Arcadius, which could not withstand the destructive effects of nature, was first ruptured as a result of an earthquake, then it was struck by lightning, and finally, in another earthquake in 704, the statue was detached from the column and shattered. The column, which survived for many years, eventually developed cracks and fractures. The column, one of the first monuments of Eastern Rome, was demolished in 1719 in order to prevent loss of life and property as it was surrounded by a residential area. In order to grasp the magnitude of the Archadius Square, it would be adequate to imagine that the area between where the pedestal of the column is located today and where the Haseki Complex is located belongs to this square in its entirety. In addition, in terms of the splendour of this huge square, it should be noted that the statues of Valentianus and Marcianus were located here but were later destroyed by earthquakes.\n\nOttoman Period\n\nThe first masjid built for the purpose of Islamisation in our quarter, after the Conquest, is the Başçı Mahmut Masjid. The name of the quarter was derived from the complex that Hürrem Sultan had Mimar Sinan build here during the reign of the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. When \"Başçı Mahmut Mosque\", which was the reason why the quarter was called \"Başçı Mahmut\" for a long time, was exposed to fire and was not rebuilt for a long time, the quarter became referred to as \"Haseki\".\n\nAnother name of the quarter from the Ottoman Period was Kadınlar Pazarı (Women's Bazaar). The buyers and sellers of the bazaar called \"Avrat Bazaar\" (Women's Bazaar) were women. It was a place where mostly the products produced by women were sold. In the centre of this bazaar, which was held once a week, there was a column from the Roman Period with a staircase inside. This description refers to the Column of Arcadius. While modest, single and two-storey Ottoman Turkish houses with gardens took their place in this district of Constantinople, which evolved from Byzantine urban culture to Ottoman urban culture, fires and earthquakes experienced during the course of the time transformed the architectural structure into masonry.\n\nA sub-quarter of Haseki Sultan Quarter is Nevbahar (Yenibahar) Quarter. It is one of the old quarters of Fatih. It was named after the mosque built by Muhyiddin Mehmet bin İsa, the bread maker of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, at a place close to Turgut Özal Millet Street on the present-day Molla Gürani Street. Unfortunately, Nevbahar Mosque was burnt down in a fire in 1918. Next to this mosque were the Taha Lodge and Kasap Halil Mosque, which did not survive to the present day. The mosque was surrounded by orchards. The settlement consisted of sparse and modest buildings. Today, this lodge and mosque do not exist.\n\nThe name of the old quarter located at the southeastern end of Haseki Sultan District and at the northeast of Aksaray is Yusuf Pasha Quarter. The children school built by Yusuf Pasha is today used as a public library on Haseki Street. The school was allocated to the General Directorate of Foundations as a library in 1973. The library has around 9000 books for children. Yusuf Pasha's grave is also situated in the garden of this library. Born in Arapkir in 1808, Yusuf Kamil, after receiving a good education in İstanbul, served in the Imperial Council clerk office, in the service of Mehmet Ali Pasha in Egypt, then as a member of the Education Council in İstanbul, then as the Minister of Commerce, as the Chairman of the Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances and as a grand vizier to Sultan Abdülaziz Khan. He married Zeynep, the daughter of Mehmet Ali Pasha, and built the famous Zeynep Kamil Hospital. In addition, one of his many charitable works is Yusuf Pasha Children School.\n\nRepublican Period\n\nIn the Republican Period, with the increasing population and migration, the historical civil architecture of the quarter, together with its gardens, disappeared. The biggest change in this period was experienced between 1955 and 1960. During these years, some of the historical monuments were removed while the area of Vatan Street and Haseki Hospital was being expanded. For example, Hafız Galip Street and Arap Manav Street were combined to form Dr Adnan Adıvar Avenue. Also, while Millet Street was being expanded, Tevekkül Bath, Şimerd Çavuş Mosque, Zıbin-ı Şerif Lodge and Selçuk Hatun Mosque were demolished. The bazaar, which was organised around the Column of Arcadius, turned into simple shops made of mudbrick over time. Along with these approximately twenty shops, there were Bıyıklı Hüsrev Mosque and its fountain, Seydi Baba Lodge, and Haseki Bostan Bath dating back to the reign of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror. Today, only the cemetery of Uçuruk Lodge remains opposite the Hekimoğlu Ali Pasha Primary School. Likewise, today, in the part of the quarter towards Fındıkzade, there is no Sheikh Taha Efendi Lodge and Nevbahar Mosque, whose lands are now occupied by works that do not conform to their original design.\n\nThe famous Turkish literary figure Nihat Özön lived in Haseki Quarter, the improvising performance artist Abdürrezzak Efendi lived on Haseki Street, the astronomer and mathematician Yusuf Ziya Gökçe lived on Güzel Sebzeci Street, and Kalkandelenli Sabri Bey, the Hafiz-ı Kütüb (Protector of Books) of the Yıldız Palace Library, lived on Küçük Mühendis Street. Haseki Sultan Quarter grew by becoming diversified in terms of population structure, housing density, transport, economic life, health, educational and training institutions. In 1946, the Municipality and the Emlak ve Kredi Bankası (Real Estate and Credit Bank) jointly established a construction company to build 56 m², 3-bedroom, single-storey houses with a garden, a bathroom, a kitchen and a toilet in the orchards of the quarter at that time. The gardens of the houses with electricity, gas, water and sewerage were separated from each other by fences.\n\nName of the Quarter\n\n\"Haseki\" is a word that is a mixture of Arabic and Persian. It means close friend. In Ottoman Turkish, it was used for the concubines in the sultan's palace. Concubines who were the wife of the sultan were called \"haseki\". Accordingly, the concubine who became \"Haseki\" was dressed in a sable fur coat, and if she had a son, her name would become Haseki Sultan. Haseki Sultans would have a precious crown on their heads. When the Sultan died, those who had a son were sent to the Old Palace. Those who had daughters or were without offspring were married off to a high-ranking person in the palace.\n\nİskendarpaşa Quarter\n\nIt is surrounded by Macar Kardeşler and Sarıgüzel Streets to the north-east, Adnan Menderes Boulevard to the west, Vatanperver, Adnan Kahveci and Feyzullah Efendi Streets to the north-west and Atatürk Boulevard to the south-east. Our quarter is on the southwestern slope of the famous Mese (Middle) Road of the first Constantinople, from today's Beyazıt (Theodosius II Forum - Philadelphion) to Edirnekapı (Polyandr) in the northeast direction, facing the Marmara Sea.\n\nByzantine Period\n\nİskender Paşa Quarter was outside the city walls built by Constantine I, the founder of the city. In the first decade of the 5th century, the quarter was incorporated into the city by the walls built by Theodosius II on the present boundaries. The quarter, spreading towards the old Lycos Stream (Vatan Street) with a gentle slope, was an orchard area along the stream. The quarter was located in the 11th district of the Byzantine Period city administration. The highest hill of this sloping land is where the Kıztaşı (Nike: Angel) is located. The six-armed relief painting on the side surface of the pedestal on which this pillar stone stands is the symbolic form of this name. After the conquest, as a result of the perception formed by this relief picture, this place started to be called Kıztaşı. The construction of Kıztaşı dates back to approximately 80 years after the foundation of the city. The Kıztaşı was erected by the Governor Preafectus Tartianus in the name of Emperor Marcianus (450 - 457) on this hill, which can easily be seen from the Marmara Sea, the Lycos Valley and the area extending from Cerrahpaşa Mosque to Topkapı. This obelisk, one of the five columns remaining from the Roman and Byzantine Periods, was made of granite. The statue, once said to be of Marcianus, was pillaged by the Latins during the Latin Invasion. The 17 metre high 'obelisk' standing on a three-stepped pedestal was known as the Marcianus Column or Marcianus Square. This column had another column in the direction of the Church of the Apostles, today's Fatih Mosque. It is known that this column, originally named 'Kıztaşı', was dismantled during the construction of Süleymaniye Mosque and used in the construction of the mosque. Rumour has it that this obelisk used to whisper whether the women passing by it were virgins or not, either with a whispered voice or by bending down. It is even rumoured that the condition of Emperor Justinus II's sister-in-law was revealed by this obelisk, and that the Emperor had his sister-in-law killed by dragging her to the Hippodrome (Sultanahmet Square) by having her tied to horses. It was also believed to protect the city from ants and snakes with its talismanic power. Another rumour is that Theodosius II, who died in 450, asked the Senate to bring a famous person to the throne through marriage, based on tradition and law. It is rumoured that Marcianus married the sister (Pulicheria) of Theodosius II, who had pledged not to lose her virginity for life, and Marcianus, who agreed to be faithful to this pledge, and that this sculpted column was erected in his name on this incident. According to Evliya Çelebi, during the reigns of Byzantine Emperors Constantine, Vezondan and Yanko, 27 talismanic monuments were erected in various parts of the city by famous architects to protect the city from all kinds of dangers. One of them was erected over the grave of the daughter of Pozanti the Great in Saraçhane to protect his daughter from snakes. According to a rumour, while the construction of Hagia Sophia was in progress, a young girl who set out to carry the column in Kıztaşı with extraordinary strength and use it in its construction, was told by one of the jinns that the construction of Hagia Sophia was completed and therefore there was no need for this stone. So the girl left the column back where she took it. But later, when she realised that she had been deceived, she wanted to take\n\nthe column back to Hagia Sophia, but she could not find the strength in herself. Because of this rumoured incident, it is said that the name was called 'Kıztaşı'. In short, the name Kıztaşı is a name with plenty of rumours.\n\nThe Latin inscription states: 'Do not take your eyes off this sculpture, this work, built by the Governor Praefectus for his master Marcianus' (Principis Hanic Statvam Marciani Cerne Torumque Praefectus Vovit Qvod Tatianus Opus). It is rumoured that there was a wind observatory in Marcianus Square, which was organised as a square surrounded by shops in the Byzantine Period, during the Lion Isavros Period. There was also a Kıztaşı Bathhouse close to the İskender Paşa Mosque. Apart from Kıztaşı, the second important area of our quarter is around Horhor Street. Horhor is the only land road that provides transportation between the Marmara Sea and the Golden Horn since the foundation of İstanbul. With the commissioning of Atatürk Boulevard, it has fallen to the second level of importance. Another feature of this road is that the water from the Bozdoğan (Valens) aqueduct flows through this street to the spots known as Büyük Horhor and Acı Çeşme.\n\nIn addition to the Bozdogan aqueduct, the water extracted from the vicinity of Fatih Mosque (Kirmasti Quarter) was transferred through the sluice system from the right and left sides of Horhor Street to the areas descending to Aksaray to the port, palace and similar centres. It is said that the name Horhor comes from the sound of the water flowing through the sluices.\n\nOttoman Period\n\nThe Kıztaşı and Horhor districts, inherited from the Byzantine period, maintained their importance during the Ottoman Period. In addition to keeping İstanbul clean and well-maintained, the Ottoman Walled City strived to make it the capital of a world state. In this respect, efforts were made to give the city a Muslim identity in terms of both space and people. In other words, after the military and political conquest, efforts were made to achieve the conquest of culture and civilisation. In this long process, both the buildings inherited from the Byzantine period and the buildings built by the Ottomans were exposed to earthquakes and fires. Another name of Kıztaşı in the Ottoman Period was Sofular. The name Sofular came from the Ekmel Baba Lodge, which was built by a group of Sufis who participated in the conquest of İstanbul after the conquest. Today, the tombs of three great dignitaries belonging to this lodge are still in the cemetery of the lodge. Sofular is also the street where historical monuments such as Sofular Bath, Sofular Mosque and Yayla Mosque are located. The activities of Sofular Lodge were terminated in accordance with the Law on Dervish Lodges and Zawiyahs. The building was later allocated for Holy Quran studies. It is still a Qur'an boarding school for female students. The most important shaykh of the lodge was Koğacızade Mehmed Efendi (Deceased: 1617), who was also a master musician. The lodge was opposite the Sofular Mosque on the same street. Sofular Mosque was built by the Shaykh al-Islam Molla Hüsrev. Next to the lodge was the Sofular Bath and behind it was the Bıçakçı Alaeddin Ali Çelebi Lodge, of which only one room remains today. Above it in the direction of Saraçhane was the Ordu Shaykh Lodge. A little further ahead of this lodge was the Yayla Kambur Mustafa Pasha Mosque and school on Hacı Salih Efendi Street. In the Adnan Menderes Boulevard direction of this mosque, there was Sırrı Efendi Lodge, which is no longer in place. There used to be the Green Lodge on the east side of Sofular Street. The Green Lodge was formerly used for population and national defence affairs, and it was\n\nlocated on the site of the building used as Fatih District Governor's Office today. The original name of the Lodge was Shaykh Alaeddin Lodge, and it was named so because of its green colour. In the Kıztaşı Square, which was transformed into a square surrounded by shops in the Byzantine Period, a number of civil architectural buildings in the Ottoman Period (e.g. Grand Vizier Kamil Pasha -Birth.1833 Nicosia/ Death: 1913 Nicosia - Mansion - which was located in the garden of this mansion. On one side of this mansion were the mansions of Abacızade İsmail Hakkı Bey and on the other side were the mansions of Basri Bey, a fabricator from Denizli.\n\nAs it is understood, Sofular and Iskender Pasha Mosques were added in the Ottoman Period around the Marcianus Column (Kıztaşı), which was a central point during the Byzantine Period. İskender Pasha was a grand vizier during the reign of Bayezid II. With the mosque he built, he was instrumental in the formation of one of the first Muslim settlements of İstanbul. Thus, our quarter took on a Muslim Turkish identity in terms of population and space by adding new historical cultural values to the heritage it received from the Byzantium with the conquest.\n\nThe biggest problem of Fatih throughout history was earthquakes and fires. One of these was the fire that started in Çırçır in 1908, which spread to Kıztaşı and burnt all the buildings there, and thus Kıztaşı, which was almost surrounded by buildings, regained its loneliness in its early years. After this disaster called 'Çırçır Fire', a second fire in 1918 turned the whole of Fatih into ashes starting from Sultan Selim to Kocamustafapaşa. After completely destroying the civil architectural fabric of Kıztaşı, Sofular and Horhor, the area was rebuilt. This reconstruction activity must have created a good centre in the conditions of the day, as the saying 'Nişantaşı on the other side and Kıztaşı on this side', which expresses the equivalence of Nişantaşı on the other side of the Golden Horn and Kıztaşı in Fatih, used to circulate. The obelisk, which was slightly damaged in the fire, also underwent maintenance and repair. This new construction preserved its architectural status until the 1950s.\n\nMualim Naci (1850 - 1893), one of the famous poets, writers and teachers of the Tanzimat Period, was born in Kıztaşı. The literary master was in favour of innovation without severing our ties with tradition. In his book 'Sünbüle', he describes his childhood memories in Kıztaşı. His grave is next to the tomb of Sultan Mahmud II. The Kıztaşı Column was restored in 2008.\n\nHorhor District used to meet its water needs from the famous Bozdoğan (Valens) aqueduct during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. Water was supplied to the palaces and religious places through the established water network system. This water network system was discovered during the excavation of the foundations of Haydarhane and Suphi Pasha Mansion, founded by Alemdar Ali Haydar Dede, one of the statesmen of the Sultan Bayezid II period, in 1999 in order to transform it into a theology faculty. The historical building facing Horhor Street adjacent to the Faculty of Theology, which is currently active, is used by İstanbul University as a printing house and film centre.\n\nHorhor District was located within the borders of Baba Hasan Âlemi. Baba Hasan Âlemi was a person who built a mosque. He had a mosque built on the street named after him in 1460. The mosque of the flagbearer (Âlemi), who was the flagbearer of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror and participated in the conquest, was demolished during the opening of Atatürk Boulevard. His grave is on the side of the same street. The opening of Atatürk Boulevard led to the removal of many monuments belonging to the district. Horhor's proximity to Aksaray, Sofular and Saraçhane and its clean air made it a district where Ottoman Period viziers and pashas lived. (For example, Hacı Ali Pasha, Suphi Pasha and Hacı Ali Mansions.) In addition, Münir Pasha and Hacı Akif Pasha Mansions, which were used as Hayriye High School for a period, are among the architectural works of this period. One of the important buildings of Horhor is the Antiques Bazaar, which was built for the school in 1981. This building is indeed a cultural centre with a very rich variety of historical objects. This bazaar was established after the flea market in Kuledibi was moved here. The bazaar, which still has 214 shops, is open every day.\n\nKaragümrük Quarter\n\nKaragümrük Quarter was formed by merging Neslişah and Hatice Sultan Quarters with a decision taken by Fatih Municipality Council in 2008. Therefore, Karagümrük Quarter is surrounded by Kaleboyu Street to the northwest, Fevzipaşa Street to the northeast, Sütçü Murat Street, Melek Hoca Street and Sofalı Çeşme Street to the southeast, Uzun Yol Street and Adnan Menderes -Vatan Boulevard to the southwest.\n\nByzantine Period\n\nTopographically, the quarter constitutes the highest point reached in the Walled City of İstanbul by the land that starts to rise from the Lycos Valley on the one hand and the Golden Horn on the other.\n\nThe quarter was included in the Walled City of Constantinople with the land walls built by Theodosius II (410-442). The quarter was formed between the two important historical borders formed by the Lycos (Bayrampaşa) Stream in the southwest and the road (Fevzipaşa Street) extending to Europe by passing through the gate called Harisius in the Byzantine Period and Edirnekapı in the Ottoman Period, starting from Vezneciler, which has been used mostly by land trade since the foundation of Constantinople (330 AD) in the northeast. The 10 gates of Constantinople, two of which are located on the city walls to the northwest of the quarter. In fact, this number increases to three with Bayrampaşa Stream. One of them was the Harisius or Hadrianopolis (Edirne) Gate, one was the Pempton (Sulukule or 5th Military) Gate, and one was the gate where Bayrampaşa Stream entered the city. This area became a residential area after it was annexed to the city. There are orchards on the borders of Lycos Stream in the quarter. The greengrocers who were engaged in this business probably lived in simple houses they built in this vicinity.\n\nBoth the open cistern of Aetius (Karagümrük Stadium) and the findings from the excavations during the renovation works of Sulukule Quarter revealed that the water brought from Vize in Thrace to Constantinople was taken inside the walls of Kaleboyu Street. The quarter was divided into 12 quarters by the Emperor Constantine and later became the 14th quarter in the administrative system of the city of Constantinople. Religious buildings were also constructed in the area, which became a residential quarter in the course of time. Those that have survived to the present day are Byzantine buildings such as Sarmaşık Greek Orthodox Church and Ayios Dimitrios Church. The God Army, consisting of Byzantine mercenaries, was also stationed in the area. During this period, the quarter's other name became Hebdoman after the name of the military unit stationed in the vicinity. The oldest inhabitants were the Romani (Gypsies). They were taken into the Walled City during wartime, but at the end of the war they were taken out of the city under the pretext of the disturbances they caused in the city. They used to work as blacksmiths, tinsmiths, sweepers, bear handlers, bundlers, and gardeners. Later, Greeks and Armenians started to settle in this quarter, which was the last border of İstanbul. In addition, the only Catholics in İstanbul used to live here. They were known as Kefeli families. Along with the Armenians, some Jews also completed the population mosaic of the region.\n\nThe First Ottoman Period\n\nIn the siege plan of İstanbul, the attacks on the walls were shared among the pashas. According to this plan, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror also attacked the walls between Topkapı and Edirnekapı with the Rumeli Army. Sulukule Gate and its surroundings were heavily damaged by cannons. Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium, which lost much of its former splendour in its final periods, had been in a miserable state since the Latin Invasion (1024-1261). The struggle in the Conquest brought the city to a more ruined state along with its walls. Therefore, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror started to transform and reconstruct Constantinople, which he planned to make his capital city after the Conquest. The name of Sulukule was created after the Lycos Stream, which flowed from Bayrampaşa and entered through the city wall gate, passed by the tower that was a continuation of the city wall, and its identification with the people living around this tower.\n\nThe Second Ottoman Period\n\nDuring this period, Gypsies continued to live in and outside the city walls. Since the Gypsies living in Sulukule were skilled in artistic activities such as playing instruments, singing and dancing, they introduced themselves as \"Romani\" and their districts as Neslişah and Hatice Sultan Quarters in order to distinguish themselves from others. They settled in the area vacated by the soldiers of the Janissary Guild, which had previously used this valley as a barracks and was abolished in 1826 (from Aksaray to Topkapı; along the Lycos Stream) and started to engage in the orchard works and reside in the Walled City, transforming it into an entertainment centre in the course of time. However, when Western music became popular from 1850 onwards, the entertainment centre shifted to Beyoğlu. The entertainment culture, which was carried out in violation of the Law on Misdemeanours, did not save the Romani people from poverty. Until the Sulukule Urban Transformation Project of Fatih Municipality, Romani people continued to carry out their entertainment activities in their makeshift houses.\n\nAfter the Conquest, the vicinity of Karagümrük was also included in the scope of Turkification and Islamisation. Thus, there was an increase in the population structure and diversity of places. The first mosque built here was constructed by Hatice Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Bayezıt II, on Fevzipaşa Street, which runs in the northern and southern direction of today's Vefa Stadium. It was demolished when the street was enlarged (1958). After this mosque, Neslişah Sultan, the granddaughter of Bayezıt II's daughter Gevhermülük, had a mosque built here in the 16th century. Then Mihrimah Sultan, daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent, had a complex and various mansions built here, changing the architectural texture and population structure of the district.\n\nThe poorest quarters of the old İstanbul were Hatice Sultan and Neslişah quarters. The poor people received help from well-to-do people who had somehow settled in the district. The second wave of settlement in Edirnekapı and its vicinity was the arrival of forced immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Shumen and Loveč after the Ottoman-Russian War of 1"
