This document provides background on Enver Pasha and the political context in the late Ottoman Empire. It describes how Enver Pasha was born to a working class family and joined the military. As a young officer, he came into contact with the Young Turk movement seeking political reforms. In 1908, as discontent with Sultan Abd-ul Hamid II's rule grew, Enver Pasha fled into the mountains and helped spark the Young Turk revolution that led to the restoration of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire.",
