        "text": "This article analyzes various aspects of the complex staging of Abdulmecid's 1846 tour of Rumelia, evaluates the immediate response it elicits from local Orthodox Christian Bulgars, and traces its momentous long-term impact on the shaping of the Bulgar community's self-conception. The article places Abdulmecid's tour within the larger context of his predecessor's groundbreaking series of imperial tours of the 1830s, and the still larger context of Mahmud II's far-reaching shift towards ruler visibility after his destruction of the Janissaries in 1826. This overarching process, which relied crucially on the annual royal birthday (veladet) and accession-day (culus) celebrations in the Ottoman capital, the provinces, and abroad (first held in 1836), began, in the author's view, as yet another type of centralization of subject (especially, non-Muslim) loyalties. It created an unprecedented avenue for direct regularized symbolic interaction between the ruler and the ruled, core and periphery of Ottoman society on the basis of innovative conceptions and practices of (inclusive) faith and (universal) kingship. Among non-Muslims, the broadening range of local celebrations of the center forged vertical ties of loyalty to the monarch, which were quite successful for at least two or three decades in the mid-nineteenth century. At the same time, it provided a vital venue for the expression of communal interests and the crystallization of communal agendas. In the final analysis, this article lays out in broad strokes a new framework for the study of the advent and nature of modernity and the ethnonational mindset at the popular level in the mid-nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the mid‐1890s school maps in the Ottoman Empire underwent a simple but important change: maps that represented the empire in its entirety confronted students in the growing number of Ottoman state schools. These new maps, which showed the empire's far‐flung territory within a single frame, began to replace older maps based on European models that had depicted the Ottoman domains as marginal lands clinging to the fringes of Europe, Asia and Africa. This shift in design should be understood within the context of late Ottoman educational policy, which was attempting to inculcate a strong sense of loyalty to, and identification with, the empire as an historical, political and geographical construct. While this effort produced some of the intended results, the attention to geography occasioned by the new emphasis on maps also raised some awkward questions. Students so recently attuned to studying geography naturally wondered why their empire was shrinking, and why its political leadership had allowed this to happen. The change in late Ottoman educational cartography thus highlighted not only the advantages and disadvantages of using maps for socio‐political purposes in general, but also the extent to which the late Ottoman state had chosen a particularly difficult moment to summon the concision and power that maps afford."
