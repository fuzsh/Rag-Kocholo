        "text": "I want to provide some information about hallmarks on the Egyptian Mixed Courts judges’ badges. I have recently been researching Egyptian hallmarks for my interests in the Egyptian Order of Ismail. I have provided data and images on the precious metal hallmarks in the thread “Question about the Order of Ismail/Nishan al-Ismail” that I started on 7 November, 2017 in this Middle East & Arab States section. My posts on the Order of Ismail thread of 11 January, 2019 and 21 February, 2019 contain more detailed information about those hallmarks than I wish to repeat here. Unlike the availability of many photos of hallmarks for the Order of Ismail, many fewer auction listings contain useful photos of the manufacturers’ hallmarks and precious metal hallmarks for these Mixed Courts judicial badges. I have included some of the illustrations below in previous posts, and apologize for the redundancy, but want to have the relevant images together in this discussion of the hallmarks on the Mixed Courts badges.\n\nThere are not a lot of the photographs of the Egyptian Mixed Courts judges’ badges that exhibit hallmarks. That is true for both the manufacturers’ hallmarks and fineness hallmarks as well. As noted in this thread, probably only one manufacturer was located in Europe (Foment-Meurice of Paris), and several examples attributed to this workshop lack any hallmarks. Additionally, many of the Egyptian-manufactured badges appear to lack manufacturers' hallmarks as well (although they all would legally have been required to have precious metal hallmarks). Several auction sites note that their badge offerings do not bear any hallmarks, and it appears that some auction badges that are cased (with the manufacturers’ names) also may not be marked. Several photos that I have previously posted on this thread show the reverse of badges that are unmarked. Unlike my research on Egyptian gold and silver hallmarks in relation to the Order of Ismail, there is not as rich a photographic documentation or auction description details regarding the hallmarks associated with the Mixed Courts badges.\n\nAs noted in other posts here, one foreign manufacturer of these judicial badges, Froment-Meurice of Paris, is well-documented in the auction availability of these badges, and Egyptian manufacturers include Stobbe of Alexandria, Wolf Horovitz of Alexandria, and probably others as well. Although some sources identify J. Lattes of Cairo, Tewfik Bichay of Cairo, and M. Laurencin & Cie. of Alexandria, as makers of these badges, I have not yet seen photographs of makers’ hallmarks for these manufacturers nor any auction information about examples made by them (except the badge attributed to M. Laurencin & Cie in a November 2012 auction by La Galerie Numismatique, but without any images of the reverse or maker’s name on the case for that example, shown below). Paul Wood wrote that he has seen examples made by Lattes and Bichay in his post of 10 May, 2011 on the thread “Egyptian Khedivate – Judges Badge of Office” started by drclaw on 9 May, 2011 here in the Middle East & Arab States section, a link to that thread also is in my first post on 17 November, 2016 on this thread. The most commonly seen examples on auction sites are made by Froment-Meurice (many unmarked, but in Froment-Meurice cases) and Stobbe of Alexandria. I have never seen an image of the reverse of an example made by Laurencine & Cie., and have only come across the one La Galerie Numismatique example that is attributed to this Alexandrian maker. Of course, a few auction listings do identify incorrect manufacturers.\n\nEgyptian precious metal hallmarks include a complete set of three different hallmarks (see the two illustrations below). When all 3 are present they read from L-R as the fineness mark that includes a square with the particular assay office identified and the purity of the metal (gold, silver, or platinum). The middle square hallmark identifies the kind of precious metal, and is distinct to Egyptian manufacture. The rightmost square is a letter that identifies the year, either of manufacture or hallmarking. These are all punched by the assay office that tests each piece. On some parts of particular kinds of items, only two hallmarks may be present (the fineness and date hallmarks) or a single hallmark may be stamped (always the fineness mark). However, somewhere on these pieces, all 3 hallmarks should be present.\n\nA complete set of all 3 Egyptian gold hallmarks on the reverse of a Commander’s neck badge of the Order of Ismail made by J. Lattes of Cairo (https://www.sixbid.com/browse.html?auction=3427&category=71681&lot=2842251). They indicate, from L-R: the finesses mark of the Cairo assay office of 18 carat gold; the ibis hallmark for Egyptian-manufactured gold; and a date hallmark “A: indicating manufacture or hallmarking in 1925-1926.\n\nA complete set of 3 silver hallmarks from the reverse of a Grand Officer’s Class of the Order of Ismail made by J. Lattes of Cairo (https://www.ebay.com/itm/EGYPT-ORDER-OF-THE-ISMAIL-2ND-CLASS-GRAND-OFFICER-ORIGINAL-CASE-RIBBON-RARE/222734299477?hash=item33dbffb155:g:5jQAAOSwQwBZkILL). From L-R they indicate: the fineness mark from the Cairo assay office of 90% (900 silver); the cat indicating an Egyptian-made silver piece; and a date hallmark of “Z” indicating manufacture in 1924-1925.\n\nOn the left are fineness hallmarks for Egyptian gold with the identification of the Cairo assay office for (from top-bottom): 23.5 carats; 21 carats, 18 carats; 15 carats, and 12 carats. On the right is the ibis hallmark indicating Egyptian-made gold (from: Fahmy, Azza 2007. Enchanted Jewelry of Egypt: The Tradition and Craft. The American University of Cairo Press, Cairo and New York: pg 198, credited to the Egyptian Department of Hallmarks and Measures Archives).\n\nTable of letters used to identify the year(s) of manufacturing or hallmarking of precious metals (for both gold and silver). English letters were used from 1916-1940, and then Arabic letters were used through the current day (a table that includes additional letters from 1982 until 2009 is shown in the 2nd image of my post of 11 January, 2019 on the thread “Question about the Order of Ismail/Nishan al-Ismail” that I started on 7 November, 2017. However, that table contains some errors). From Fahmy 2007: pg 199, derived from the Egyptian Department of Hallmarks and Measures Archives. Fahmy also notes (pg 201) that after 1949 (until 1967) the letters changed every 2 years (rather than the previous practice of changing them each year). When the war between Egypt and Israel occurred in 1967, Egypt stopped importing the steel pens used to trace hallmarks on jewelry from England until 1974 in order to conserve their reserves of foreign currency.\n\nEgyptian silver hallmarks from illustrations in the Fahmy 2007 volume, pg. 200 (from the Egyptian Department of Hallmarks and Measures Archives). On the left is a chart that shows regional hallmarks from the principal assay offices. The lotus blossom in all examples is the mark for Egyptian silver that may have been instituted in 1946 to replace the cat symbol (however see the last note and hallmark examples in this post). The 3 hallmarks to the right of the lotus show the different finesses mark options that include the identification of the particular assay office (the symbol at the top of the square) and the particular silver purity markings (600, 800, and 900 silver) for any individual piece. The Arabic letter at the right is a date hallmark, in this case I am uncertain which letter it represents, whether for 1965-1967 or 1968-1974. The illustration on the right shows 3 different Egyptian silver hallmarks that are used in the middle position of a complete set of hallmarks. From top--bottom they are: the lotus blossom mark that may be for post-1946 Egyptian silver (but see the final illustrations in this post), the cat with a raised tail hallmark that many sources identify as the hallmark for Egyptian silver between 1916-1942, and a variant cat hallmark with a lowered tail, this example also showing the Arabic “90” for 90% (900) silver. I have only seen the cat with a raised tail hallmark on the Order of Ismail or on the Mixed Courts judges' badges where these hallmarks are shown in enough detail in photographs. Additional examples of the variation in how some of these marks look can be seen on my 11 January and 21 February, 2019 posts on the Order of Ismail thread.\n\nFroment-Meurice, Paris: Émile Froment-Meurice lived from 1837-1913 and created the design of the judicial badge that was instituted by Khedive Abbas Hilmi II. I am uncertain of the precise date when this badge was instituted, although the Fritz Rudolf Künker GmbH & Co. KG auction description of a Stobbe manufactured Dictrict Court gold and silver judge’s badge (see below) identifies 1907 as the date of this commission. The creation of this badge for the Mixed Courts’ judges may have been associated with the judicial costume change from the earliest practice of each judge (foreign and Egyptian) wearing their own country’s judicial robes to a standardized Egyptian costume of fez, long tunic coat, along with the colored sashes and this large badge (see my discussion in the 4th paragraph of my 24 March, 2017 post in this thread). Such a promotion of Egyptian attire for the Mixed Courts judges is consistent with Khedive Abbas Hilmi II’s nationalist leanings, a source of conflict with Lord Cromer and later with Lord Kitchener that eventually resulted in the Khedive being deposed and banished from Egypt by the occupying British \"protectorate\" in 1914 after the beginning of WWI. Émile Froment-Meurice took over the workshop in 1859 following the death of his father, François-Désiré Foment-Meurice, in 1855. The name Froment-Meurice derives from Émile’s paternal grandmother having married her husband’s (François Froment) partner following her husband's death, goldsmith Pierre Meurice in 1832, changing the workshop name to Froment-Meurice. Émile’s father, François-Désiré Froment-Meurice took over the shop in 1837, the year of Emile’s birth. Émile Froment-Meurice is known for having worked in a distinctive sculptural or figural decorative arts style (bijoux sculptes) rather than the joaillerie and bijouterie style that previously characterized the work coming out of the shop. Perhaps his training in the delicacy of the bijouterie style is partly responsible for the beauty of the Egyptian Mixed Courts badge. Judicial badges either marked Froment-Meurice or attributed to that manufacturer appear to dominate the available examples of these badges on current auction sites. In addition to hallmarked examples, several auction badges are identified as the work of Froment-Meurice based on the case associated with the badge. Many examples that are probably the genuine work of Maison Froment-Meurice are unmarked. Most of the manufacturer's hallmarks from this maker are situated in the upper portion of the reverse within the concavity associated with the central coat of arms portion of the obverse design. I have only seen one example showing the diamond-shaped maker’s hallmark with a rose where the name “FROMENT” is above a stylized rose with stem and two leaves, with the bloom on the right side, above the word “MEURICE” (see the 4th example described below, that of Parquet Judge Apostolo N. Gennaropoulo).\n\nThe two photos above show an example of a Froment-Meurice hallmark on the reverse of a Mixed Courts silver judicial badge from a current eBay listing (https://www.ebay.com/itm/EGYPT-KHEDIVE-SILVER-GILT-ENAMEL-JUDGE-BADGE-TOP-GRADE-EXTREMELY-RARE/223386325115?hash=item3402dcd07b:g:CLQAAOSwo3pWdm9L:rk:2:pf:1) that has been re-listed several times over at least the last 2 years (probably because of the high asking price). I have not previously illustrated the obverse of this particular badge. The uppermost image shows the placement of the manufacturer's hallmark on the reverse of the judicial badge and the lower image a close-up (offset) of the mark. No dimensions are provided for this example in the auction description.\n\nHallmark of Froment-Meurice judicial badge from a high-resolution image of a January 2019 auction by Heritage Auctions (Lot 36093) showing the same placement of the Froment-Meurice hallmark as on the eBay example above. No silver hallmarks are visible in this photo, either on the body of the badge or the tunic pin. The auction listing incorrectly identifies the manufacture as Stobbe. I previously illustrated both the obverse and reverse of this badge on my post here of 14 January, 2019. From: https://coins.ha.com/itm/egypt/egypt-abbas-hilmi-pacha-1874-1944-khedive-1892-1914-magistrate-badge-nd-c1892-au-/a/3072-36093.s?type=CoinArchives3072 and on the Numisbids.com website: https://www.numisbids.com/n.php?p=lot&sid=2946&lot=36093\n\nReverse of a silver judicial badge made by Froment-Meurice showing the manufacturer’s hallmark in the same upper position as both of the other examples shown above. This badge is from a July 2015 auction by Clarke Auction Gallery, that is archived on the liveauctioneers.com website (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/38904932_silver-froment-meurice-egyptian-badge). No silver hallmarks are visible in this med-resolution image. It is unclear from this photo whether the mark on the proximal (end near the hings) tunic pin may be a silver hallmark. I previously illustrated the obverse and reverse of this badge, a close-up of the Froment-Meurice hallmark (also shown in the following photo, the badge in its case, the inscription on the interior case lid (also shown below), the two portrait photos of an Egyptian judge wearing either this or a comparable badge with this lot, and another unidentified medal associated with this lot of in my most recent post of 22 January, 2019.\n\nClose-up of the Froment-Meurice hallmark on this same badge from the July 2015 Clarke Auction Gallery listing. (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/38904932_silver-froment-meurice-egyptian-badge)\n\nName and address of Froment-Meurice, 372 Rue St. Honore, Paris on the interior lid of the case for the same silver judicial badge sold by Clarke Auction Gallery in July 2015 (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/38904932_silver-froment-meurice-egyptian-badge). The interior silk of this case lid is pale blue, as is the velvet badge bed, and the case exterior is a dark blue.\n\nAbove is a photo of the reverse of the only example of the silver judicial badge I have seen with the Froment-Meurice hallmark in a different position than the examples shown above. It also is a unique photo showing the diamond shaped hallmark with the name “FROMENT” above the stylized rose with stem and two leaves between the lower word “MEURICE” on this badge. I have seen this diamond-shaped hallmark commonly on many Froment-Meurice table service silver pieces. This is the reverse of the cased silver badge worn by the Greek Judge Apostolo N. Gennaropoulo of the Mixed Tribunals Parquet of Alexandria from a 2014 eBay auction archived on the WorthPoint website (https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/ottoman-empire-egypt-khedivate-judges-982926374). I have previously illustrated the obverse of this badge in its original case along with the accompanying photo of Judge Gennaropoulo wearing the badge with his other court regalia, in the 9th photo of my post of 24 March, 2017.\n\nDrawing of the Froment-Meurice rose hallmark used by Maison Froment-Meurice. I do not know the date ranges for the use of this hallmark. (From: https://www.langantiques.com/university/Froment-Meurice_Jewelry_Maker%27s_Mark)\n\nThe Froment-Meurice name and business address (same as on the Clarke Auction Gallery example above, with contrasting interior silk color) on the interior lid of the case for the Judge Gennaropoulo silver Parquet judicial badge. Although the interior silk color is crimson (as is the velvet badge bed,), the exterior case color for this example is dark blue, similar to the Clarke Auction Gallery example shown above in my 22 January post. An eMedals silver judicial badge that is unmarked on its reverse is identified as a Froment-Meurice manufacture due to its associated case, that has the same crimson colored silk with gold lettering and crimson velvet badge bed but has a red leather case exterior (illustrated in the 5thphoto following 4 images of the badge itself, including the 3rdand 4thphotos that show the unmarked back with no silver hallmarks, on my post of 23 July, 2018).\n\nStobbe of Alexandria: Stobbe is the second most commonly identified manufacturer for the Mixed Courts badges on auction listings. The manufacturer's mark for Stobbe is usually situated on the lower portion of the reverse side’s concavity that defines the central coat of arms on the obverse. I have not yet found good, high-resolution images of the Stobbe hallmarks.\n\nThe best image of a Stobbe hallmark I have found is on the above example of a gold and silver District courts badge from a Baldwins’ auction of December 2014 (lot 844) archived on The Saleroom.com website (https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/baldwins/catalogue-id-srbal10006/lot-895754ae-9b9f-4f06-9d11-a3fe00ab0fe1). The high-resolution image of the reverse shows the Stobbe mark as three lines, although some parts of the right side of the hallmarks are obscured by the closed tunic pin. The first line of the hallmarks reads: “STOBBE”; the second line reads “900” (for 900 silver); and the third line reads “ALEXAND[RIE]”. No other Egyptian silver hallmarks are visible on the reverse of this badge, nor on the pin. I previously illustrated the obverse and reverse of this badge in the first photo of my initial post starting this thread on 17 November, 2016, in the 6th photo of post of March 24, 2017, and in my correction of misidentifying this badge as an Appeals Court badge form on my post of April 4, 2017.\n\nAn example from a May 2015 auction by Fritz Rudolf Künker GmbH & Co. KG (Lot 49) that is archived on the acsearch.com website (https://www.acsearch.info/search.html?id=4974323) has a slightly different configuration of the Stobbe Hallmark. This example is identified as being silver, gold, and enamel; the silver and gold means this is a District Courts judge’s badge (Cairo, Alexandria, Mansourah, with the former having a once-a-year session in Port Said). I illustrated this badge’s obverse and reverse on the first post of on 31 October, 2018 (2nd photo). I mistakenly identified it in that post as a silver badge, but both the German description in the auction listing and examination of the obverse, show that gold gilding can be seen (somewhat worn) on the exterior rays, and the rays around the superior 5-pointed star above the central tablet with the enameled inscription. It is unclear which other parts of the obverse of this badge are gold. This badge appears to show a symbol on the left side of the line with the name “STOBBE” that is followed to the right of the maker's name by “900” indicating 900 silver. The location “ALEXANDRIE” is centered below the other inscription. However, the low resolution of this image and the closed tunic pin obscuring some parts of the hallmark make any details very difficult to evaluate. This particular example also is noteworthy because of the visibility of 2 silver (probably?) hallmarks on the lower margin of the reverse of the body of the badge, on the first individual ray to the left of the pin’s catch situated over the most inferior 3 rays of the badge. Again, as the image is not high-enough resolution, it is not possible to determine which 2 hallmarks they are, but most likely they are the assay office’s fineness mark (from Alexandria?) for silver (?) and date hallmark. There also are 3 silver hallmarks on the tunic pin. From the most superior portion of the pin at it’s hinge, approximately ¼ down the length of the pin on the on the left bifurcated part of the pin are the 3 silver hallmarks. The low resolution of this image makes it difficult to read any of these. However, the photo does show they are oriented with the inferior portion of the hallmarks to the left, the first is certainly a fineness mark, although the assay office cannot be identified nor the fineness (probably “ 90” in agreement with the “900” at the right end of the line with Stobbe’s name). The second hallmark is clearly the cat with it’s tail raised, the Egyptian silver hallmark that may be associated with silver made mostly before 1946 (however, see comment below about the King Farouk I medal commemorating the closing of the Mixed Court). I cannot read the date hallmark in this set. No gold hallmark is apparent on the photo of the reverse of this badge.\n\nHorovitz of Alexandria: I have only recently found Horovitz as a maker of some judicial badges, and have seen just 2 examples (in addition to the anomalous “pin” form of the judicial badge illustrated on this thread in my post of 2 December, 2018, and the reverse of that badge also is shown below) made by Horowitz offered on auction sites. I presented some information about Wolf Horovitz, a Romanian jeweler who settled in Alexandria in my post of 1 December, 2018 when I first found a judicial badge attributed to Horovitz. This allowed me to re-evaluate the markings on a gold Appeals Court badge that I illustrated in the 4th and 5th photos of my post of 24 March, 2017 (both the obverse and reverse, and only the reverse of that badge is shown in the next photo below).\n\nReverse of the only example of a gold International Tribunals Appeals Court badge I have seen a photograph of, from a flickr site. Unfortunately, I did not copy the http address of the images for this badge before they appear to have been removed from flickr. I cannot subsequently re-locate the photos and have not successfully found them with a Google Images search. Although not a high-resolution image, the first 3 letters of “HOR” can be made out to the left of the tunic pin and “TZ” can be seen on the right side of the pin. This manufcturer’s mark is in approximately the same position as the majority of the Froment-Meurice manufacturer’s hallmarks. Near the bottom of the concavity associated with the obverse coat of arms, 2 gold hallmarks are visible to the left of the tunic pin. The photo is not detailed enough to read those hallmarks, but the rightmost one is probably a fineness mark (most likely from the Alexandria assay office as is clear in the other Horovitz example from an ongoing eBay auction shown below). As I have seen no other examples’ hallmarks nor any descriptions of the gold purity of the Appeals Court badges, I do not know how many carats may be assayed. The other Horovitz example I have seen, shown below, is silver.\n\nReverse of a silver Horovitz judge’s badge from a December 2018 eBay auction (https://www.ebay.com/itm/EGYPT-KING-FAROUK-SILVER-GILT-ENAMEL-JUDGE-BADGE-IN-ORIGINAL-CASE-XXX-RARE/223228334558?hash=item33f97211de:g:1o0AAOSwBURb6gap) that continues to be re-listed on eBay, also probably because of the high asking price. This photo shows the identical placement of the Horovitz manufacturer’s hallmark (the pin also obscuring the same letters “…OVI…” as on the Appeals Court example) as on the gold Appeals Court example and the same position for the precious metal hallmarks. This photo also shows that the tunic pin has 2 silver hallmarks near the proximal (hinge) end on the left bifurcated pin portion. I previously provided images of the obverse, reverse, some of the hallmarks, and images of the case in my 1 December, 2018 post on this thread.\n\nThe same silver Horovitz badge from the current eBay auction with the tunic pin open showing the manufacturer’s hallmark and the 3 silver hallmarks.\n\nClose-up of the reverse of the same silver Horovitz judicial badge showing the Horovitz maker’s hallmark and the 3 silver hallmarks. Detaisl of both hallmarks are shown below.\n\nClose-up of the “HOROVITZ” maker’s hallmark on the same eBay silver judges badge.\n\nClose-up of the 3 silver hallmarks on this same Horovitz judge’s badge. From L-R they indicate: the finesses mark from the Alexandria assay office for 90% (900) silver, the cat hallmark indicating Egyptian silver, and the date hallmark “N” indicating a manufacture or hallmarking date of 1938-1939.\n\nClose-up of the two silver hallmarks on the tunic pin of the same eBay example the Horovitz judge’s badge. The hallmarks are (L-R) the Alexandria assay office fineness mark for 90% silver and the date Hallmark “N”.\n\nW. Horowitz name and business address (26 Rue Chérif Pacha, Alexandrie) inside the upper lid of the case of this same eBay example that is lined with tan silk, the velvet badge bed also is tan, and the case exterior appears to be dark green or black.\n\nReverse of the strange silver pin based on the iconography of the Mixed Courts badge that I illustrated on 2 December, 2018 on this thread. This is from a December 2018 auction by Bamfords (http://www.bamfords-auctions.co.uk/auctions/673/lot-3620A/_/) that is archived on The Salesroom website (https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/bamfords/catalogue-id-bamfor10553/lot-546dbbb8-f7b1-4f6a-a2ba-a9a0009cb8b5). The \"HOROVITZ\" hallmark is partially visible underneath the tunic pin in the same position as the other Horovitz examples shown above. Three silver hallmarks are visible to the left of the distal end of the tunic pin, above the catch and within the concavity of the modified coat of arms on the obverse. Although not high resolution, the 3 silver hallmarks probably represent the assay office (Alexandria?) fineness mark, the cat with tail raised mark for Egyptian silver can just be made out as the middle hallmark, and the rightmost should be a date hallmark. As noted in my original description of this anomalous piece, it appears to be somewhat crudely cast (note the negative holes on either side of the tunic pin in the middle of the concavity where judicial badges have raised attachments for securing the tablet with the inscription to the central coat of arms and affixing both components to the obverse face of the embellishment in the 3-piece construction that can be seen especially well in the 5th photo, and the2nd photo, from a June 2018 eMedals auction in my post of 23 July, 2018 on this thread-additionally, the 6th and 7th photos in that post also show good images of the unmarked reverse of a Froment-Meurice badge), but as it is a silver jewelry piece it still should bear Egyptian hallmarks, and these do appear to be in relief. Also note the 3 silver hallmarks on the most distal portion of the right side's bifurcated proximal portion of the tunic pin before it forms the single shaft of that pin. The hallmarks on the pin cannot be read in this photo, but should represent a complete set of fineness mark, Egyptian silver mark, and a date hallmark.\n\nM. Laurencin & Cie, Alexandria:I have only seen one example attributed to this maker on an auction site, but the reverse of the badge is not illustrated. A November 2012 auction by La Galerie Numismatique (Lot 323) that is archived on the sixbid.com website identifies its offering as being in a case marked “M. Laurencin & Cie, Alexandrie, Egypte”. No information is provided in the auction description whether there is a manufacturer's mark on the reverse of this badge and no photographs are provided of the reverse. This is a silver example of the badge identified as measuring 112 mm high x 85 mm wide.\n\nThe cased silver judicial badge attributed to M. Laurencin & Cie, of Alexandria from the November 2012 action by La Galerie Numismatique (Lot 323), archived on the Sixbid.com website (https://www.sixbid.com/browse.html?auction=515&category=11656&lot=539484). This badge is identified as measuring 112 mm high x 85 mm wide. I have not previously illustrated this badge.\n\nAlthough several internet sources and some published material suggest that the silver cat hallmark was only used from 1916-1946 to indicate Egyptian-made silver and then replaced with the lotus blossom mark, the precious metal hallmarks on the 1949 King Farouk I silver medal commemorating the closure of the Mixed Courts uses the cat hallmark for Egyptian silver. I do not yet know how to resolve some of these discrepancies in the temporal periods covered by the cat or lotus blossom silver hallmarks.\n\nClose up of the silver hallmarks on the lower left of the King Farouk I silver medal commemorating the termination of the Mixed Courts (from a September 2017 Auction by Stephen Album Rare coins : https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3018794&AucID=3079&Lot=1776&Val=7022a8a05524ba0ccff62c071a37a509&Match=1#match1). The high-resolution of the image of these silver hallmarks shows (L-R) the Cairo assay office fineness hallmark for 90% (900) silver, the cat hallmark for Egyptian silver, and the date hallmark for 1948-1949.\n\nObverse (L) and reverse (R) of a different King Farouk I silver medal commemorating the end of the Mixed Courts from a May 2018 auction by Stephen Album Rare Coins arcoved on the icollector.com Online Collectibles Auctions website (http://www.icollector.com/EGYPT-Farouk-1936-1952-AR-medal-32-27g-1949-EF_i29825948). Unfortunately, I do not read Arabic, but some of the inscriptions on this medal are translated by Ahmed S. Kamel on his flickr site: https://www.flickr.com/photos/askamel/2377843795/in/photolist-5Wv6Q1-a7Qy7k-5LqeKv-a7QztZ-5XBeXa-5KYdKK-5XFv79-5XFvob-4C857P-5WqN1r-5XFuQd-4Q1dWa-5QeWGi-5XFqcC-5WqRyR-5XBfEH-5WqRnx-5WqShg-5QeW4a-5Wv7BN-5XBa1H-5XFoUU-5XFvNb-5WqNYg-5UqfKu-otnVUE-5XFpZW-a1e2so-5Wv6q3-5XBfKV-RXYNPw-WNEU4t-EgzCUc-Xr4u9u-qtAtnj-q8o8uw-qpVB9M-CE4mCr-Pwiqcw-2ccgjqU-2ccgiJJ-2ccgxXJ-R5X1c7-5XFpBE-5XBaEg-Hadd4j-q8wY58-pu3qeR-ovFS5q-ouRdoY. The inscription on the left side of the bust of King Farouk I on the obverse face reads: “King of Egypt”; on the right of the obverse it reads “Farouk I”. On the lower right below the bust of King Faoruk I is the medalist signature for Sadek Tewfik Bichay. On the reverse, the Arabic inscription on the right is not translated, but is probably a translation of the French inscription on the left of the medal: “FIN DU SYSTÉME JUDICIARE MIXTE”, as also seen on the stamp commemorating this event. The silver hallmarks on this example are not as easy to read, but they include (L-R) the Cairo assay office’s fineness hallmark for 900 silver, the Egyptian cat hallmark identifying Egyptian silver, and the date hallmark (which I cannot read). As noted in the exchange with annab on 3 June and 5 June, 2018 in this thread, the “S.T.B.” on the lower right is the medalist hallmark of Sadek Tewfik Bichay."
