        "text": "It is debatable whether World War I was the first industrial war (the American civil war fifty years earlier was, after all, decided by the industrial strength of the North) but it was certainly the first total war, in which all human and material resources of the belligerent countries were mobilised and ultimately exhausted. In this sense, it was the ultimate vindication of the ideas of influential military theorists like Colmar von der Goltz, who had made this the central thesis of his 1883 Das Volk in Waffen (The Nation in Arms). The total nature of the war effort changed the balance within the governing systems of the belligerent states, and particularly the relationship between the civilian institutions (parliament and cabinet) and the military leadership. On the one hand it led to the militarisation of society and an enhanced role of the military leadership, but on the other, the need for mass mobilisation and production for the war effort also meant that the military were dependent on the ability of the political institutions to deliver what they needed. To give but one example: arguably, the three measures that made Britain ultimately successful in the war – military conscription, efficient production of munitions and the convoy system for shipping across the Atlantic – were taken by the civilian leadership."
