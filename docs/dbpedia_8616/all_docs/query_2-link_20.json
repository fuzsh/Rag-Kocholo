        "text": "Carl Schmitt considered Boy with ‘Cello one of his finest works. When he signed and dated this painting in 1931, the forty-two year-old artist had recently lost his last major patron in the wake of the 1929 market crash. His career had become mired in a predictable routine: acceptance into prestigious juried shows and the leading New York galleries, followed by warm praise from critics, only to end with disappointing sales, if any at all.\n\nA break in the clouds came in the spring of 1930, when Mrs. Nicholas Brady, the leading Catholic philanthropist in the United States, bought two of Schmitt’s paintings for the new house she was building for the Jesuits in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. “I cannot tell you what a tremendous relief it is to me to know that Mrs. Brady has purchased ‘The Immanent Trinity,’” a good friend wrote him in June. “Now you pull along for four or five more months without worrying, and do not worry during this period. It is wonderful that things broke in your favor when they did.”\n\nIt was at this time that Schmitt embarked on a series of portraits of his own sons, then ranging in age from two to twelve years old. Although he occasionally took on portrait commissions during these years (such as one of Mrs. Brady herself), the artist took great delight in rendering the portraits of those he knew best—his own family.\n\nThe portrait of Schmitt’s second son, Austin, was the most ambitious of these works, both in size and conception. Measuring a generous 3½ x 4 feet, it proved the largest portrait the artist would undertake in his eighty-year career.\n\nThe painting came at a crucial point, too, in Schmitt’s development as an artist. His notebooks reveal him grappling with what he called the “epic” stage, the struggle to reconcile the demands of the world with the inspirations of the lyric muse who first beckoned him to take up his brush in the cause of beauty.\n\nAfter more than a decade of experimenting with pure color in his tapestry-like lyric paintings, Schmitt reintroduced light and shadow—the nuanced values of the epic—into his canvasses. In this portrait of his son, the chair and cello, the folded drape, and the fingerboard and bow combine the curved lines of the lyric, the vertical lines of the epic, and the sharp diagonal thrust of the dramatic into a single harmonious unity.\n\nBoy with Cello was shown at a Silvermine Guild exhibition (where it was noticed by the New York Times), then at the prestigious Ferargil Gallery in New York, and finally at the Carnegie Museum’s Exhibit of Contemporary American Paintings in Spring, 1932. Like many of Schmitt’s works at this time, the painting did not sell, and so remained in the artist’s possession until his death. It now makes a commanding presence in the Foundation’s studio-gallery.\n\nA guest post by William P. Skidd.\n\nThe reminiscences of those who knew Carl Schmitt form an indispensable part of his legacy. In a vivid way they show that his thoughts on art, life, childhood, and religion were not mere theories but the expression of a lived reality. If you have memories of Carl Schmitt to share, I’d be delighted to hear from you. Please contact me at the Foundation at samuel.schmitt@carlschmitt.org.\n\nWilliam P. Skidd, a grandson of Carl Schmitt’s son Peter, lives with his wife and children in Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nI will always remember my great-grandfather Carl Schmitt as a warm, wise, and joyful man. Even as he was approaching a century in age, he invariably had a broad smile and fond attention for each of his myriad great-grandchildren. He truly appreciated others and took the time to know each of us young children personally.\n\nIn return, he was loved and respected by his extensive family. A stranger walking into the room would know immediately that there sat the patriarch of the family. Despite his great age, he was not parked in his dotage off in a quiet corner or shielded from the mass of unruly young children. Instead, he was the epicenter, engaging and reveling in the great family he had fathered.\n\nGreat-Granddad was with us until I was sixteen years old. As I grew up, I had the privilege of conversing with him on a more adult level. Only then did I begin to grasp his wisdom and ever-sharp intellect. His vision of truth was never pretentious or academic. It was real. He was an avid writer, capable of great insight, but never strayed so far that he could not stir some mischievous wit.\n\nHe lived simply, but with perpetual enthusiasm to share the natural beauty he experienced. In later years he radiated a peaceful dignity, suffused with the joy of a life well lived. It was as if he had already received his reward to look out onto all the good he had nurtured in the world.\n\nA true renaissance man, he was comfortable in his own skin while remaining ever in awe of the wonders of creation. He maintained both a detachment from self-absorption and a love for life in the noblest sense. He was a century-old man with the eyes of a child.\n\n1926 was a momentous year for Carl Schmitt and his family.\n\nThe years since his marriage had been taken up in a seemingly endless series of exhibitions in Silvermine, New York, and at the major shows across the country. The artist’s star seemed to be rising. “It is not reasonable to suppose that a man can show the amazing endurance that Carl Schmitt has in persevering in his desire to paint and to achieve the profound without some day being ‘discovered,’” a critic wrote in 1923. Despite his hard work and the recognition of a few select critics, Schmitt had yet to be “discovered.”\n\nYet it seems the artist was content to labor in obscurity in the “solitudes of Silvermine,” “a colony of artists who love their work and want to get away from the stress and confusion of modern life. Mr. Schmidt [sic] lives in a house with his family and has his studio in another part of the wood where it has almost a medieval atmosphere, filled as it is with remarkable paintings that come from his brush.” With his growing family—his wife had given birth to six sons by the time Schmitt sketched her sitting in the kitchen in March 1926—his thoughts turned to their education and upbringing. More and more he was becoming dissatisfied with what life in America would mean for him and his family.\n\nThe Catholic activist Peter Maurin, a co-founder with Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker Movement, gives us some insight into Schmitt’s thinking at this time. “Carl Schmitt the artist does not want his ten children to be super salesmen, he wants them to be cultured peasants,” Maurin wrote in his characteristically proverbial prose in the early 1930s. “Carl Schmitt the artist is far from thinking that all America needs is a good five-cent cigar, as Vice President Marshall was in the habit of saying. Carl Schmitt the artist thinks that America needs to be revitalized with healthy peasant blood from those parts of Europe where the rugged individualism of bourgeois commercialism has not yet penetrated.”\n\nIn June, Schmitt decided to act on his convictions. On the invitation of his longtime patron Zell Hart Deming, he traveled to Europe to explore where he might settle with his family. He visited Dalmatia and Paris but decided on Chartres, France, bringing his wife and family over in September. His brother Robert handled his affairs at home, sending his latest painting, “A Gift of Fruit,” to the Carnegie International exhibition in October. As before, the critics were impressed, one foreseeing “a future in which he will be regarded as the logical heir of the great Americans such as Homer and Eakins.” And once again he was singled out as an artist “who commands admiration from his colleagues but is yet undiscovered by art patrons at large.”\n\nAlthough the family’s foray to Europe was short-lived (he returned to Silvermine with his family in the spring of 1927), its effects would be long-lasting. According to Schmitt’s son Jacob, “From this experience he seemed to have developed a firmer grasp of the significance of the grace of place, remarking that Northern Europe seemed to bring ‘domestication and affection’ to the fine arts.” Indeed, one can see a certain domestication Schmitt’s own practice of painting, the art he called “characteristically domestic.” And more and more his unsold paintings hung “above where children played or where a family sat at a meal,” as his friend Padraic Colum put it. “In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around.”\n\nThis Veterans Day we reprint an article first published on the blog a number of years ago.\n\nShortly after close of World War II, Peter Schmitt and his brother David were interviewed for a book, New Canaan War Veterans Speak, published by the New Canaan Historical Society, from which this excerpt is taken. Both brothers were proud of their service in the Italian campaign of 1944-45 as members of the fabled 10th Mountain Division of the U. S. Army’s 86th Infantry. Their account was combined with that of their buddy and fellow New Canaan resident Russell Hunt, who, with the Schmitt brothers, was a technical officer assigned to the headquarters of the 86th Infantry. The interview shows the brothers’ unassuming bravery as well as their thoughtfulness and personal integrity in the face of the brutality of war.\n\nT/ 5 Russell Woolston Hunt and T/ 4 Peter Carl Schmitt went into the Army in January, 1943, and were assigned to HQ Co., 86th Infantry, 10th Mountain Division. Peter Schmitt’s brother, T/4 David Tod Schmitt, joined the same outfit the following March. The three men were in the entire North Italy action when the Division spearheaded from San Marcello across the high peaks of the Apennines and up through Po River Valley to Lake Garda in the foothills of the Alps.\n\nPeter and David Schmitt once lived in Italy, know the language, and used to talk to the peasants in the towns where they were stationed. David defined the plight of the people as “a question of fear and poverty. Unless you understand poverty . . . ” he said, and his voice trailed off, implying how difficult it is for us to picture the hard reality of life over there. Peter thought we had a terrific responsibility in Italy. “After all, we’ve left a trail of destruction behind us,” he said.\n\nPeter Schmitt is twenty-three and David is twenty-one. Both have high cheek bones and rounded faces. Peter is the darker of the two, with almost black hair and deep-set eyes, while David is fair, with light brown hair and hazel eyes. They both give the impression of great vitality and good spirits. Their talk is quick and pointed.\n\nRussell Hunt is twenty-two and is tall and slender. He has medium blond coloring, with level brows and regular features. He is full of fun, but reticent, too, abruptly disposing of anything particularly difficult with “You just had to”— and a little lift of his shoulders.\n\nPeter and David Schmitt and Russell Hunt have the Combat Infantry Badge, ETO ribbon with two battle stars and a number of letters of commendation from commanding officers of the Army in Italy. [Peter later received the Bronze Star.]\n\nAll three were in Communications, Regimental HQ being in control of troop movements, Hunt explained, and David Schmitt called it ‘the nervous system.’ The CP might be a hundred yards from the front — or miles behind it. Sometimes they stayed a while in one place, but oftener they were on the move. “When we were really pushing,” Peter Schmitt said, “we’d have five or six command posts a day.” He was radio man, transmitting messages from the regiment to the division. Six men constituted his group. They moved by jeep, or on mules if their objective took them up a mountain trail. When the front was too fluid, they’d take turns. Half the group would be up spotting artillery fire while half stayed back.\n\nHunt had charge of one of the company’s three radio jeeps, driving the car and running the radio, sometimes alone, sometimes with other men. David Schmitt was a walkie-talkie man, going out with officers on reconnaissance trips.\n\n“Our regiment was always out in front,” Hunt said. He said it was a lot of fun going back to Headquarters through the German lines. “We were surrounded on three side. You just had to go through their lines to get back.” (Peter Schmitt explained that when a division is pushing, they take key points, then fan out rapidly, leaving pockets of Germans on either side.) “My jeep was shot up,” Hunt said, “but I was never hit,” he added quickly.\n\nSupply problems in the mountains were terrific and food was mostly K-rations, so that the men longed for such things as milk and green vegetables. For sleeping, they’d make a bunker, a big hole roofed with logs and sand bags, and they’d get lots of straw for bedding from a near-by farm. Staying several days in one place, they’d be billeted in a house or building. They’d feel quite secure if they were in a spot where the mortars fell short and the way-back fire was passing overhead.\n\nAnd being under cover always gave a feeling of protection, even if the roof was fragile. Peter Schmitt remembered once when they were shelled and he, being on duty, had to leave the house and go out to his radio in the jeep . “I ran out there and as soon as I got in the jeep, I felt perfectly safe, just because it had a canvas top,” he observed smilingly. “It was pretty hot that night.”\n\n“Yes,” said David Schmitt, “when we got up in the morning, a tree was on our house.”\n\nTo be continued . . .\n\nWe conclude the story of Carl Schmitt’s sons David and Peter as members of the 10th Mountain Division in the Italian campaign late in World War II. (Click here for Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.) These accounts are taken from interviews conducted after the war with Peter, David, and their comrade Russell Hunt.\n\nThe final days of the Allied push up the peninsula saw some of its toughest fighting at Lake Garda, a large and picturesque body water between Venice and Milan at the foot of the Italian Alps. German troops held a strong defensive position in the towns of Riva and Torbole at the northern end of the lake. Between April 27 and 30, 1945, the 10th Mountain Division fought their way through the booby-trapped tunnels and rough terrain that separated them from the Germans.\n\nJoining in the effort was Col. William Darby, one of the most celebrated soldiers of the war. Inspired by the British Commando units, he headed an elite group of soldiers assigned to the most dangerous missions (“Darby’s Rangers”), the forerunner of the Army Rangers and other special operations forces. At the time of his death on April 30, 1945 – just two days before the end of hostilities – he was only 34 years old but had already earned two Distinguished Service Crosses, three Purple Hearts, a Legion of Merit, and numerous honors from foreign governments.\n\nThe day after the surrender of the German army on May 2, the commander of the 10th Mountain Division, General George Hays, paid tribute to his soldiers on the streets of Torbole: “Never in its days of combat, did it fail to take an objective, or lose an objective once it was taken. Never was so much as a single platoon surrounded and lost.”\n\nAfter the war Peter married and raised six children with his wife Jane. He pursued a career as a commercial artist in the advertising industry in New York. David attended college and married; he and his wife Louise had eight children. In the 1960s he helped his brother John establish Thomas More School, a Catholic boys boarding school in Harrisville, New Hampshire. David died in 2014; Peter three years later.\n\nThe end of April saw the Division in action at Lake Garda. “That was the worst part of the whole battle,” Hunt said. “We had 70% casualties there. C. Company lost a hundred and twenty men and all their officers. At the upper end of the lake, we had to go through five tunnels a half mile or more in length. The Germans blew them up, then we cleared them out and started through . . . You just had to go through them.”\n\nPeter Schmitt drew a map of Lake Garda which is about forty miles long and proportionately rather narrow, with a widening out at the lower end. The Lake extends almost due north. Riva and Torbole lie at the upper end, where the Germans kept a tiny submarine.\n\nAfter several days of the hardest kind of fighting, the men went on to take Torbole. “That’s where Peter was blown through a window!” David exclaimed. Pete said: “Oh, I was standing there leaning against the outside of a building and a shell knocked me through.” “It was the concussion,” David put in. “There was one big bang, then I picked myself up,” Peter said with a broad smile. “That was the shell that killed Colonel Darby,” he added quietly. “You’ve heard of him ? He was a very famous officer.”\n\nFollowing Torbole, came the capture of Riva in the last battle fought by the Division, for it was here that the official declaration of peace was received. “We were right about here when peace was signed,” Peter said, pointing to a spot some distance down the lake. “But then, it couldn’t take effect for two days,” he concluded reasonably.\n\nHunt thought Riva one of the most beautiful towns in Italy. probably the most beautiful, with the mountains on three sides, and the lake in front and the little valley with its one road. “After that, we went up to do occupation work at Cave del Pravil, a little town near Trieste,” he said.\n\n“We went up there to help the British,” Peter Schmitt explained, and spoke of the mixture of nationalities in the country extending northeast of Lake Garda. The territory was formerly Austrian, being ceded to Italy after the first World War. Here live many Austrians as well as the Italians settled by Mussolini. At the Jugoslav border, an infiltration of the Italian-speaking followers of Tito had taken place.\n\nThe boys found Tito’s men in Cave del Pravil. “They were against us, they looked on us as meddlers,” David protested. “They walked around like kings. They’d told the people to have nothing to do with us. I know that because I took my laundry to a woman and she wouldn’t do it. She said they’d told her if she had anything to do with Americans, they’d kill her.”\n\n‘Then one day Dave took a walk up the mountain and found one of their guns,” Peter began.\n\n“Yes,” David broke in, “I went up there and I found one of their machine guns all set up, all ready to fire.” Thinking it was a practice gun belonging to his own outfit, he was amazed to identify it as Tito’s. “There wasn’t much left of it when I got through,” he said. “I broke it all to pieces and threw it down the mountain.”\n\nPartisans around Trieste form two groups, Peter said. The Communists want to join Tito and Jugoslavia, while the other group would like to be a separate state, with Trieste an open port. Friction between factions with conflicting objectives creates a state of tension. “You feel the British there, too, sort of feeling of pressure,” Peter suggested, but with this opinion David was not wholly in accord. “Anyway, something is certainly going to happen there in the Balkans!” Peter exclaimed.\n\nDavid Schmitt is going back to school, preparing for college; Peter has a position in New York in commercial art work. Russel Hunt is interested in radio and hopes to make it his career."
