        "text": "Name at birth: David Alan Mamet\n\nDavid Mamet is a playwright and filmmaker, best known for the plays American Buffalo and Glengarry Glen Ross.\n\nRaised in Chicago, Mamet graduated in 1969 from Vermont's Goddard College, where he returned to teach early in his career (1971-73). There he wrote plays and formed a theater company, which then moved to Chicago.\n\nHis early plays included Sexual Perversity in Chicago (1973) and American Buffalo (1975), both of which became Off-Broadway successes.\n\nMamet moved into screenwriting in the 1980s, first writing the script for the 1981 remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice, then earning an Oscar nomination for his next script, The Verdict (1982, starring Paul Newman).\n\nHis 1984 play Glengarry Glen Ross won a Pulitzer in 1984; it was made into a star-studded 1992 movie (not by Mamet), and a wider audience was exposed to Mamet's distinctive style of profanity-laced dialogue and his preoccupation with machismo.\n\nMamet made his filmmaking debut with 1987's House of Games, a con-within-a-con movie that starred his then-wife Lindsay Crouse and a crowd of frequent collaborators, including actors William H. Macy, Joe Montegna and Ricky Jay.\n\nSince then he's continued to work as an essayist and editor, a playwright and screenwriter, and sometime director of his own films.\n\nMamet wrote the scripts for The Untouchables (1987), The Edge (1997) and Wag the Dog (1997, another Oscar nomination)."
