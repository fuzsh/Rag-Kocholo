        "text": "“Oh you’re a bad pony, and I’m not gonna bet on you.”\n\nAfter Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse, “The Indian in the Cupboard”), a famous psychiatrist and best selling author, comes to the aid of one of her clients, a compulsive gambler, she finds herself face to face with Mike (Joe Mantegna, “The Godfather Part III”), a gambler and con man. After a brief incident, Mike intrigues Margaret, and the two start to form a strange partnership.\n\nThe best part about this film, much like the best part of “Glengarry”, was the writing. This movie knows how to constantly raise the stakes, and it does it in a way that feels like we’re almost always recovering from getting the carpet yanked out from under us. This movie feels like one gut punch after another, one twist after another. I felt, much like I’m sure Margaret felt, that I needed to pay attention continuously so that I wouldn’t miss anything. In fact, I loved everything about the way this story was told. I thought the characters were duplicitous and shady, and watching them try to figure each other out was an absolute blast, but I also thought the unfolding of the story was handled incredibly deftly. We are given time to appreciate the constant twists and settle into what seems to be a new normal, before once again the rug is yanked out from under us.\n\nThe worst part of this movie is the acting. Now, I’ve never really thought Joe Mantegna was a great actor, but I never really thought of him as a bad one either. I don’t believe I remember seeing Lindsay Crouse act in anything before, but I felt the same way about her acting: she’s not terrible, but she’s not particularly great. Throughout the film, I felt as if each of the two leads had a few shining moments and each of them had a few pretty cringe-inducing moment. Overall the acting felt pretty uneven, and honestly, had the writing not been as good as it was, this film easily could’ve been knocked down to a 3/5 star film for me.\n\nVerdict:"
