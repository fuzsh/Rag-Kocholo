        "text": "Not sure if it's my own intelligence, but I want to believe that Mamet purposefully made the con (starting with their exit of the hotel) completely apparent to the audience. I think he tricks us into the first con in the poker table, and then teaches us the rules so when the second con really begins, we are on red alert to watch every tell. This put me in a rare spot for watching a con movie - instead of watching the what of the con (\"What will happen next?\") I observed the how of the con (\"What phrases are they using? What are they telling and not telling? How are they using the environment around them to manufacture illusory…\n\n86/100\n\nThe Dissolve review (for a Mamet piece). A watershed film for me at age 19, when I'd only been watching art films for a couple of years; can't be very objective about it now, though I've always had issues with Crouse's robotic performance and with pretty much every scene not directly related to the long con. Also, while this doesn't invalidate anything that happens (because why would Dr. Margaret Ford know these details? I didn't back then), the poker-game scam is hilarious from the perspective of a knowledgeable poker player, as (a) nobody would ever be permitted to leave the room in the middle of a hand during a high-stakes game, even if they were about to wet their…\n\nAfter making a name for himself with screenplays for a string of incredible films ranging from \"The Untouchables\" and \"The Veredict\", director David Mamet has decided to direct his first film, showing off not only his ability to create stories that enthrall, but that also manage to straddle between the cinematic and the theatrical, incorporating smooth camera work and great cinematography, with every character operating as if the streets or the rooms were one big staged space.\n\nA great thing about this script is that it reaches a point where you realize that it is a story of deception, a tale of distrust that even though you know what is going to happen next, it still holds your interest and…\n\nDavid Mamet’s “House of Games” is the possessor of a rare trait in the modern con artist genre: restraint.\n\nEver since Hollywood decided to start intermingling sleight of hand in thievery with magic, a great deal of the major heist flick entries have been riddled with razzle dazzle.\n\nSo, it’s a surprise then to find “House of Games” — which prides itself on its “dinosaur” age tricks, played by a bunch of guys who would retire, if only they knew what to do with themselves afterwards.\n\nLegendary playwright Mamet’s first swing as a director makes “Games” one of the purest realizations of his unique style captured on film. While plenty of scenery-chewing actors have eaten up Mamet’s scripts in various…\n\nCriterion Collection Spine #399\n\nA compelling and twisty look into the world of con men, but for me there was a significant flaw that kept me from really loving David Mamet's directorial debut.\n\n\"When you have done something unforgivable, I'll tell you exactly what to do. You forgive yourself.\"\n\nSo do people actually consider the super wooden performances in this movie good? The acting from just about the entire cast felt so mechanical and overly rehearsed, that it became distracting at times. Which is a real shame because this is otherwise a great story about a psychiatrist who finds herself getting corrupted by some real crafty characters.\n\n\"It's called a confidence game. Why? Because you give me your confidence? No.…"
