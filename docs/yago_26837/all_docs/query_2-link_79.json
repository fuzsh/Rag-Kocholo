        "text": "Playwright David Mamet returns to the silver screen this fall with \"State and Main.\" The film, penned and directed by Mamet, will be released on Dec. 22, and includes such prominent theatre talents as Charles Durning, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Patti LuPone and William H. Macy.\n\nThe movie -- described as part satire, part screwball comedy -- traces the clash of cultures when a Hollywood film crew invades a small New England town. Among the Tinsel Town characters are Alec Baldwin, as a slimy movie heartthrob with a taste for teenagers; Hoffman as the flick's idealistic screenwriter Joe White; a slinky film siren played by Sarah Jessica Parker; Macy as a smooth-talking director; and David Paymer as a hard-driving producer.\n\nThe small-town folk include Charles Durning as the local mayor (named, in a nod to the film's Capra-esque leanings, George Bailey); Patti LuPone as the mayor's starstruck wife; Rebecca Pigeon (Mamet's wife) as a sweet bookseller for whom Joe White falls; and Julia Stiles, a schoolgirl who becomes the victim to Baldwin's advances.\n\nAlso peppering the cast are such old Mamet theatre stand-bys as Ricky Jay, J.J. Johnston and Jack Wallace. Baldwin also acts as co-producer of \"State and Main.\"\n\nMamet is the author of such plays as Glengarry Glen Ross (a recent McCarter Theatre production of which starred Durning), The Old Neighborhood (which starred LuPone) and American Buffalo (in which Macy has twice acted, most recently at the Atlantic Theatre Company). Mamet's films include \"House of Games,\" \"Things Change,\" \"The Winslow Boy,\" \"The Spanish Prisoner\" and \"Homicide.\""
