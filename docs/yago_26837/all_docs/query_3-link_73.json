        "text": "David (Alan) Mamet, (born Nov. 30, 1947, Chicago, Ill., U.S.), U.S. playwright, director, and screenwriter. In 1973 he founded the St. Nicholas Theatre Co. in Chicago. He won wide notice with Sexual Perversity in Chicago (1974) and followed it with plays such as American Buffalo (1977) and Glengarry Glen Ross (1983, Pulitzer Prize). He became known for rapid-fire dialogue studded with obscenities and for his preoccupation with power relationships and corporate corruption. Mamet used the rhythms and rhetoric of everyday speech to delineate character, describe intricate relationships, and drive dramatic development. His later plays included Speed-the-Plow (1987), Oleanna (1992), The Cryptogram (1994), Boston Marriage (1999), November (2008), Race (2009), and Bitter Wheat (2019). His screenplays included The Verdict (1980), The Untouchables (1986), and Wag the Dog (1997). He also wrote and directed films such as House of Games (1987) and State and Main (2000) and created and wrote the TV series The Unit (2006â€“09)."
