        "text": "Watching Robert De Niro in We’re No Angels is a little like watching Meryl Streep in She-Devil. We know these actors as the most volcanically serious performers of their generation. There’s something positively liberating about seeing them play fast and loose in out-and-out comedy.\n\nDe Niro is teamed with that chip off the De Niro block, Sean Penn, in a movie very loosely adapted from a 1955 Humphrey Bogart film of the same title. This one is about two convicts, played by De Niro and Penn, who get dragged along when a fellow inmate (James Russo) busts out of prison on his way to the electric chair.\n\nRusso goes his own way, but De Niro and Penn straggle along through the wilderness (filmed in British Columbia) until they reach a small river town. All they have to do is cross the bridge in town and they’ll be safely in Canada. But with the prison warden hanging around the bridge with his Dobermans, our boys need to be wary.\n\nSomehow it follows that De Niro and Penn are mistaken for priests, visiting the town for an annual celebration of the local miracle, which involves a weeping statue. Much of the film’s comedy, therefore, comes out of the sight of these two roughnecks wobbling around in clerical garb.\n\nThe fact that these two actors are known for their non-comedic tendencies simply adds to the joke. Penn summons up all the sweetness he can muster – which, surprisingly enough, is quite a bit – as the lame-brained con who finds himself at home in the church. De Niro is given to mugging, but he’s so good at communicating exasperation that it doesn’t matter. He’s particularly adept at absolving an adulterer in the confessional: “Your wife doesn’t know? Then what are you worried about? Forget about it!”\n\nAdd a little romance for De Niro with a local (Demi Moore), and We’re No Angels comes together as satisfactory entertainment. It has a nice edge to it, thanks to the script by playwright David Mamet, which consistently spews sharp and gritty dialogue. There’s a certain morbidity that keeps the movie interesting, provided by Mamet and Irish-born director Neil Jordan (Mona Lisa).\n\nFirst published in The Herald, December 15, 1989\n\nAnother review where it appears a final paragraph or two was chopped off. And yet, I’d probably said enough at that point. The supporting cast is full of characters actors, including an early appearance by John C. Reilly. Apparently De Niro and Jordan did not get along, which could explain something. The poster, as you can see, used the tagline “The Con is On,” one of a series of films that employed that dismal phrase – the first being, in my memory, and I am sorry I remember it, The Sting II.\n\nIt’s very possible that in Things Change, veteran actor Don Ameche has given his best performance. This may be because it’s a role completely unlike anything Ameche has played before.\n\nAmeche plays Gino, a simple shoeshine man from the old country (Sicily), living his modest existence in Chicago and minding his own business. Then, things change: His resemblance to a noted Mafioso is noticed when the hit man is arrested on a murder charge. Some mob bigshots offer Gino a deal: If he’ll take the rap for the murder, they’ll set him up pretty when he gets out of jail in three years or so.\n\nGino thinks about it, figures it’s an offer he cannot refuse, and accepts. All that remains before handing over his confession is to wait the weekend out in the company of a mob bodyguard, Jerry (Joe Mantegna).\n\nJerry, however, gets a little antsy in their cramped hotel room. He comes up with the bright idea of treating Gino to a weekend in Lake Tahoe before handing the old boy over. When they get to Tahoe, because of a series of misunderstandings, the entire town comes to believe that Gino is a powerful (if very quiet) Chicago Don.\n\nThis is an impression that Jerry is happy to encourage, especially since the duo is scoring free hotel suites and unlimited credit in the casinos. As Jerry confides to someone who wonders exactly who this Gino is: “Babe … this is the guy, behind the guy, behind the guy.” ‘Nuff said.\n\nAs this dicey impersonation continues, it becomes more difficult to sustain, especially when “Don” Gino is summoned to the lakeside retreat of a real godfather (Robert Prosky).\n\nThings Change is the second film directed by playwright David Mamet, and it’s comparatively lighter than his first, House of Games. But like that film, Things Change is oddly, seductively shaded, and also features exceptionally sharp dialogue (Mamet wrote the script with Shel Silverstein). Mamet isn’t the smoothest director, but he always seems to find a new way of seeing things. Smoothness can come later.\n\nHe has a wonderful way with individual sequences, such as the gambling foray in which Gino wins and then loses big, and the meeting between Gino and Prosky’s capo. The highest wish-fulfillment count comes when Gino and Jerry pick up a couple of showgirls from the hotel review and share wine and song with them in their suite’s comically Roman-bath-like Jacuzzi.\n\nMamet also gets great chemistry between his leading men. Mantegna, the con man from House of Games, is terrific at playing the two-bit hood who’ll never be an effective gangster because his heart is too tender.\n\nAmeche gives a largely silent performance, using his eyes and his long face to express an unexpected subtlety. When he does speak, it is in a flawless Italian-American accent, in which we can hear the echoes of a hard life of work, small reward, and newfound wonder. The forthcoming Cocoon II notwithstanding, Things Change is the screen gem of Ameche’s long acting career.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, October 1988\n\nThe movie seems to have been completely forgotten, but apparently I enjoyed it. Ameche came to Seattle for interviews, and I spent an hour talking to this genteel and thoughtful gentleman, perhaps the classiest interview experience I’ve had. The film had a notably awful poster, pushing the buddy-movie aspect. The cast includes lots of Mamet regular or types, including William H. Macy (and his future bride Felicity Huffman, in her first movie).\n\nScan the credits of About Last Night …, and you can start to see “sellout” written all over it. Here’s a film adaptation of a play by Pulitzer Prize-winner David Mamet, but the screenplay has been written by a former Saturday Night Live Not Ready for Prime Time Player.\n\nNot only that, the leads are played by a pair of Hollywood’s Brat Packers, and we all know how shallow and callow they are, right?\n\nThen there’s the title switch, from Mamet’s marvelous Sexual Perversity in Chicago to the utterly innocuous About Last Night …. Sounds like the work of some soulless studio weasel, doesn’t it?\n\nWell, all those things are warning signs, all right. But warning signs alone do not a film make. It turns out that About Last Night … is a thoroughly decent attempt to make some sense out of modern manners and morals. It doesn’t always succeed, but it provides quite a few sincere observations and some memorably spiky dialogue.\n\nThe story revolves around Danny (Rob Lowe), a laid-back, non-committal sort who hangs around in bars with his buddy Bernie (James Belushi) and enjoys the no-strings life of one-night-stands.\n\nThen he meets Debbie (Demi Moore) who, naturally, is different. They become an item and move in together, much to the chagrin of both Bernie and Debbie’s roommate, Joan (Elizabeth Perkins). These two, who loathe each othe, share a common goal: to break up Dan and Debbie. Which, eventually, they do.\n\nThat’s as much of a plot as there is. Nothing particularly special; we know the movie is going to head toward Danny’s eventual growing up, acceptance of responsibility and all that jazz. As such, the film does fall prey to creeping conventionality, although there’s a clear effort by the filmmakers to try to avoid a sugary happy ending. (They don’t, not quite.)\n\nBut the script, by Tim Kazurinsky (Saturday Night Live alumnus, who also has a funny cameo here) and Denise DeClue, creates some good diversions along the way. There is much biting interplay among the main foursome, and Belushi – who also played his role onstage – gets some of the most unrepentantly sexist lines in recent memory.\n\nThe film begins with a soaring Belushi monologue about an unlikely sado-masochistic encounter that gets the film off to a hilarious start. He’s fine, and the movie doesn’t go too far in making him do a personality turnaround (many movies these days would have him renounce his Neanderthal ways before the fade-out).\n\nRob Lowe still seems ill at ease much of the time. He actually handles the big dramatic moments better than the simple business of walking across a room.\n\nBut if the movie is held together at all, it’s by Demi Moore, who exudes a fierce authenticity. When things start to lag – and they do from time to time – Moore can be counted on to deliver some small dose of truth.\n\nTelevision veteran Edward Zwick directed (he did the taut TV-movie Special Bulletin), with a good deal of care, and quite a bit of sexiness. The film has some genuinely steamy scenes, unlike last year’s similar (but much worse) St. Elmo’s Fire, also with Lowe and Moore, which chickened out in the clutch (so to speak).\n\nZwick’s big failing is the inclusion of a bunch of songs, for the purpose of tethering the film to a hit album (just like – yep – St. Elmo’s Fire, which, come to think of it, was topping the record charts while the movie was slipping out of sight). Even with that, About Last Night … should turn out to be the ideal date movie of the summer.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, July 1986\n\nI’m not sure a friend and fellow Seattle critic every forgave me for admitting that I thought this movie was pretty good. I suspect I would not be as keen now. Moore‘s performance makes you wonder what she might have done if she’d decided to stick with acting instead of whatever it was she did. This was Elizabeth Perkins’ first movie. Special Bulletin was a TV-movie that took the Orson Welles/War of the Worlds approach to a story about a nuclear incident. Zwick went on to do the TV show thirtysomething with his writing partner Marshall Herskovitz, and then go back into big-movie directing. By the way, IMDb has dropped the ellipsis from the title of this movie, and also capitalizes thirtysomething, so Zwick is having trouble there.\n\nIf, in this world in which all new movies look alike, you’re interested in a film that stands alone, look no further than House of Games. David Mamet’s film is a remarkably intelligent and tantalizing piece of work; not arty or intellectual, just refreshingly made for people with brains.\n\nMamet is perhaps the best American playwright now going (American Buffalo and the Pulitzer Prize-winner Glengarry Glen Ross). But he’s written some fine screenplays of late, including The Untouchables, The Verdict, and the excellent 1981 remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice. House of Games is his first job as movie director (from his own script, naturally).\n\nMamet’s work explores the darker territory in human existence, and often the American Bad Dream. House of Games follows an uptight psychiatrist (Lindsay Crouse) into a city night world, where she becomes involved with a group of con men, and particularly with a darkly magnetic gambler (Joe Mantegna).\n\nThe reviewer’s lot is a difficult one here, because House of Games contains a number of delicious con games, sometimes one on top of another. It would be bad form to reveal too much, or anything at all, about the storyline.\n\nBut it can be said that Mamet leads his heroine into a mysterious game that includes extortion and murder, and the change wrought on this careful woman—who writes the kind of facile self-help books that don’t seem to have helped her at all—is fascinating to watch.\n\nThe movie takes place in an anonymous city, although it was filmed in Seattle. Cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchia manages to make Seattle’s inner city look a lot more romantically mysterious than it really is.\n\nAs a first-time director, Mamet is not afraid to make some unusual choices. For instance, Crouse plays her character in a deliberately stylized manner, with a disquieting emotionlessness and an exaggerated precision of speech. This isn’t realistic, but it sets us up for her eventual coming apart. (Crouse and Mamet are married in real life, by the way.)\n\nMamet also gets a wonderful performance from longtime collaborator Mantegna, as well as from Mike Nussbaum and Ricky Jay, who play other slippery con men.\n\nOf course, Mamet has given them some chewy dialogue to play with. It’s as though he were crossing the dialogue form a film noir of the late 1940s with today’s sharpies. When Mantegna eyes Crouse in a sleazy pool hall and says evenly, “Aren’t you a caution,” he sounds like a hep cat from another time.\n\nApparently Mamet has a life-long interest in gambling, con men, and poolrooms (when he learned that a sequel to The Hustler was in the making, he was greatly disappointed to find out that someone else had already written the script). But in House of Games he registers, among other things, his admiration for actors. In many ways the movie is about different kinds of acting, from the kind we do to keep our everyday lives together, to the kind of performing that is the profession of all con artists. The con game, as Mamet proves here, is acting of the most dangerous kind.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, October 15, 1987\n\nThe movies directed by Mamet have a weirdly honed quality that isn’t like anybody else, and House of Games remains one of his best as director. I wonder why he shot it in Seattle?\n\nFor all its explicit violence and mayhem, there’s something gloriously old-fashioned about The Untouchables. Not just because it recalls the Robert Stack television show; not even because it’s set in 1930 and evokes memories of hard-bitten Warner Bros. gangster movies.\n\nNo, The Untouchables is old-fashioned in more crucial and meaningful ways. It has the simplicity, for instance, to suggest that might doesn’t necessarily make right, and that a small band of men on the side of good may triumph. These days it takes a lot of gumption to support ideas like those, and The Untouchables has gumption in excess.\n\nEliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is the Treasury agent who rides into 1930s Chicago like a cowboy determined to rid the town of its black-hatted villain. The villain, of course, is “Scarface” Al Capone (Robert De Niro), who rules the city utterly, and has much of the police department in his deep pockets.\n\nSo Ness forms his own troupe of men: Malone (Sean Connery), a wise old-timer who tutors Ness in the Chicago ways; Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), a Treasury accountant who studiously discovers that the blood-spattered Capone might be tripped up on a tax-evasion charge; and Stone (Andy Garcia), a young Italian sharpshooter.\n\nThe film delivers this investigation through a series of tit-for-tat encounters between Ness and Capone, a bloody citywide war that eventually has no limits. The playwright David Mamet (Glengarry Glen Ross) has written characters and dialogue that manage to be fresh while conforming to historical facts (and certain Hollywood traditions).\n\nAnd he layers the movie’s straight-forwardness with some ironies; for instance, that the law Ness was defending, Prohibition, was a bad idea, which allowed organized crime to take over in the first place. And Mamet doesn’t shrink from the fact that Ness’s tactics begin to resemble those of the very men he’s sworn to put away.\n\nChoosing Brian De Palma to direct Mamet’s script was a brilliant stroke. De Palma has already cut his teeth on the operatic crime film (his Scarface was actually an update of the 1932 film based on Capone). De Palma and cinematographer Stephen Burum find the kind of clean, unfussy period look that the material demands.\n\nYet when opportunity presents itself, De Palma is capable of taking wing. Two set pieces stand out: Ness’s men charging across the countryside on horseback to seize a shipment of illegal hooch, and a delirious sequence in a train station involving Ness’s capture of Capone’s bookkeeper in a furious crossfire. De Palma’s thrilling staging of these scenes marks a new virtuosity in his work.\n\nA slew of good performances, too: Costner does well with the difficult task of keeping straight-arrow Ness interesting; Connery is marvelous in a role he inhabits with warmth and authority; Billy Drago contributes a chilling cameo as hit man Frank Nitti. De Niro, who replaced Bob Hoskins as Capone, is effective as usual, never more so than in a stirring speech about baseball that ends in his Louisville Slugger connecting with the skull of an incompetent underling. It’s a whole new suggestion of the true American pastime.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, June 3, 1987\n\nI recall how satisfying this movie was when it came along; it didn’t have to be great, it was just so very good. Which meant a lot in 1987. A prequel has been rumored for a while, and I have a strong feeling somebody’s going to remake this soon, and probably not stray far from the Mamet screenplay."
