The supplemental features on the disc include vintage trailer for the film; archival audio commentary with Ricky Jay and David Mamet; video interview with Joe Mantegna; and more. The release also arrives with a 30-page illustrated booklet featuring an essay by critic Kent Jones and excerpts from the director's introduction to the published screenplay. In English, with optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature. Region-A \"locked\".\n\nPlayers\n\nIf someone asked you to sum up your entire life with a single word, what would it be? Adventure, struggle, disaster, triumph? Have you ever thought of it as a game? What if life, and by default everything that occurs in it, is nothing more than a game of action and reaction? And what if there are only two kinds of people that participate in it -- skilled players that know how to initiate the action and then use it in their favor, and those that allow to be played and then struggle with the consequences of their forced reactions? Would you be one of the players, or would you be one of the played?\n\nDavid Mamet's directorial debut is a thought-provoking and very entertaining cinematic defense of the notion that life is in fact a game. Its main protagonist, Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), is a prominent psychiatrist who is an expert at deconstructing lives and identifying the issues that have made them unmanageable. Her ability to see clearly and profile different people is so advanced that she prefers to spend time with her thoughts rather than be engaged in transparent social activities. It is why she is also single. An unusually tense session with a client who confesses that he is contemplating suicide because he owes a large sum of money, however, unexpectedly redirects her life. In a lousy bar, Margaret confronts Mike (Joe Mantegna), a poker player, who agrees to write off her client's debt if she helps him figure out the 'tells' of a rival who has been winning for hours. Rather reluctantly she accepts the deal and misreads the 'tells', but finds Mike's personality irresistibly attractive and begins a casual relationship with him. Soon after, Margaret agrees to help Mike and his friends stage an elaborate scam that could potentially help them retire, and the more she learns about their skills and lifestyle, the more she convinces herself that despite his 'profession' Mike deserves a permanent spot in her life.\n\nThe best thing about this film is that it offers an experience that gradually forces you to ponder whether you are properly reading the 'tells' of the people that you meet throughout your life as well. It does so by presenting different situations that reveal how seeing should never be a validation of reality, and that understanding that it is so is essential for the proper decoding of the 'tells' that ultimately can make you successful. This is the exact same revelation that Margaret extracts from her relationship with the con artists.\n\nThere is a degree of artificiality that plagues the film, however, and when it becomes too prominent it affects negatively its wit and charm. It is most noticeable whenever there is an important point about the nature of the game that is unfolding before Margaret's eyes and Mike explains to her the 'tells' that she ought to focus on. These 'conversations' always look and sound like rushed rehearsals where two actors quickly recite their lines at each other to get a feel of the scene that later on they have to do right. Also, after the first card game the film essentially excuses Margaret's long-lasting and crucial naivety with her supposedly overwhelming desire for the thrilling adventure that ultimately turns her life upside down, which is extremely odd and practically impossible to accept as legit given that as a successful psychiatrist she has trained her mind to carefully analyze everything that she sees and hears.\n\nThe film takes its appearance very seriously. Indeed, it is easy to tell that Mamet and director of photography Juan Ruiz Anchia carefully selected the key locations and then lit them with a particular ambience in mind. Most of it is easy to describe as neo-noirish.\n\n*If the subject matter of House of Games appeals to you, here are a couple of other films that you should consider seeing: Bruce Geller's Harry in Your Pocket! (1973) is one big and brilliant masterclass on the 'game' presented by a phenomenal crew of professional con artists. Barbet Schroeder's Cheaters (1983) is another stylish eye-opener that follows two gamblers on the Portuguese island of Madeira. And Miguel Bardem's Swindled (2004) is a wild roller-coaster that dissects the nature of the 'game' with an almost surgical precision.\n\nHouse of Games Blu-ray, Video Quality\n\nPresented in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, encoded with MEPG-4 AVC and granted a 1080p transfer, David Mamet's House of Games arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Criterion.\n\nThe following text appears inside the booklet that is provided with this Blu-ray release:\n\n\"Supervised and approved by director of photography Juan Ruiz Anchia, this high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit DataCine film scanner from a 35mm original interpositive. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed using MTI Film's DRS, while Digital Vision's Phoenix was used for jitter, flicker, and small dirt. The original monaural soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm magnetic soundtrack master. Clicks, thumps, hiss, and crackle, were manually removed using Pro Tools HD and iZotope RX.\n\nTransfer supervisors: Juan Ruiz Anchia, Maria Palazzola.\n\nColorists: Jeff Chavez/Point.360, Burbank, CA; Gregg Garvin/Modern VideoFilm, Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe film looks a bit soft for my taste and actually has a slightly dated overall appearance. (My guess is that the master was prepared some time ago). Plenty of the darker footage from the club as well as the nighttime visuals actually do not have the healthy nuances that newer 2K/4K remasters produce. Depth can be better as well, though what the current master offers is still quite good. Shadow definition isn't optimal and as a result some areas of the film tend to look flatter and even thicker (see screencaptures #10 and 18). Grain is also subdued, though the density levels remain strong. The color scheme is convincing, but some of the light black crush that is easily seen in darker footage actually affects existing nuances. Image stability is excellent. There are no distracting debris, scratches, cuts, stains, warped or torn frames to report. My score is 3.75/5.00. (Note: This is a Region-A \"locked\" Blu-ray release. Therefore, you must have a native Region-A or Region-Free player in order to access its content).\n\nHouse of Games Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nThere is only one standard audio track on this Blu-ray release: English: LPCM Mono (48kHz, 24-bit). Optional English SDH subtitles are provided for the main feature.\n\nThe audio is clean and stable. There are no balance issues to report either. The original soundtrack boasts some good dynamic contrasts, but do not expect strong intensity. The dialog is very easy to follow. There are no pops, cracks, hum, dropouts, or distortions to report.\n\nHouse of Games Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nTrailer - a vintage trailer for House of Games.

What if life, and by default everything that occurs in it, is in fact a big game that is controlled by skilled players? Think about it. How much of your life is really, well, your life? Can you afford not to react to the actions of the players that have defined its rules? And are you looking at it from the proper angle? If these questions have never crossed your mind, then it is practically guaranteed that there is a rude wake-up call coming your way. It may not be quite as exotic as the one that Dr. Margaret Ford gets in the film, but there will be one, and it will rock your world. Criterion's Blu-ray release of House Games is sourced from the older master that the label used a decade ago for this DVD release. It also retains the excellent audio commentary with the late Ricky Jay and David Mamet.
