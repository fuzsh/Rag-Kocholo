        "text": "We are big fans of Mamet and also big fans of the Almeida, so Janie and I were really looking forward to this one.\n\nWe indeed got a fabulous production, wonderfully well acted, directed and produced. But we were less sure about the piece itself.\n\nOf course with Mamet you get more twists and turns than a country lane. Of course you get even riper language than an expletive-filled debate at our place after Janie and I have both had a bad day. And of course, with Richard Bean in the driving seat for the play script itself, you get some lovely stage devices and coups de theatre.\n\nBut the piece itself, based on a 1980’s Mamet film script, seemed surprisingly slight and it was unusually easy to predict the twists. I suspect the film worked better, but I haven’t seen it.\n\nStill, with Alleyn’s School alum Nancy Carroll heading up a pretty impressive cast, plus Django Bates providing the atmospheric jazz music, it was an entertaining evening to be sure. Janie enjoyed it thoroughly, but also claimed she let the plot wash over her.\n\nHere is a link to the Almeida resource on the play/production.\n\nSceptics might not trust the above resource to link to all the reviews – quite rightly, as the reviews were mixed. Here’s a helpful search term for your own deep dive – click here.\n\nIf you’d like to see the trailer, click below – it’s pretty cool:"
