        "text": "David Alan Mamet (; born November 30, 1947) is an American playwright, filmmaker, and author. He won a Pulitzer Prize and received Tony nominations for his plays Glengarry Glen Ross (1984) and Speed-the-Plow (1988). He first gained critical acclaim for off-Broadway 1970s plays The Duck Variations and American Buffalo. His plays Race and The Penitent, respectively, opened on Broadway in 2009 and previewed off-Broadway in 2017.\n\nFeature films that Mamet both wrote and directed include House of Games (1987), Homicide (1991), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), and his biggest commercial success, Heist (2001). His screenwriting credits include The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), The Verdict (1982), The Untouchables (1987), Hoffa (1992), Wag the Dog (1997), and Hannibal (2001). Mamet himself wrote the screenplay for the 1992 adaptation of Glengarry Glen Ross, and wrote and directed the 1994 adaptation of his play Oleanna (1992). He created and produced the CBS series The Unit (2006–2009).\n\nMamet's books include: On Directing Film (1991), a commentary and dialogue about film-making; The Old Religion (1997), a novel about the lynching of Leo Frank; Five Cities of Refuge: Weekly Reflections on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy (2004), a Torah commentary with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner; The Wicked Son (2006), a study of Jewish self-hatred and antisemitism; Bambi vs. Godzilla, a commentary on the movie business; The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture (2011), a commentary on cultural and political issues; and Three War Stories (2013), a trio of novellas about the physical and psychological effects of war.\n\nEarly life\n\nMamet was born in 1947 in Chicago to Lenore June (née Silver), a teacher, and Bernard Morris Mamet, a labor attorney. He is Jewish. His paternal grandparents were Polish Jews. Mamet has said his parents were communists and described himself as a red diaper baby. One of his earliest jobs was as a busboy at Chicago's London House and The Second City. He also worked as an actor, editor for Oui magazine and as a cab-driver. He was educated at the progressive Francis W. Parker School and at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. At the Chicago Public Library Foundation 20th anniversary fundraiser in 2006, though, Mamet announced \"My alma mater is the Chicago Public Library. I got what little educational foundation I got in the third-floor reading room, under the tutelage of a Coca-Cola sign\".\n\nAfter a move to Chicago's North Side, Mamet encountered theater director Robert Sickinger, and began to work occasionally at Sickinger's Hull House Theatre. This represented the beginning of Mamet's lifelong involvement with the theater.\n\nCareer\n\nTheater\n\nMamet is a founding member of the Atlantic Theater Company; he first gained acclaim for off-Broadway plays in 1976, The Duck Variations, and American Buffalo. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1984 for Glengarry Glen Ross, which received its first Broadway revival in the summer of 2005. His play Race, which opened on Broadway on December 6, 2009 and featured James Spader, David Alan Grier, Kerry Washington, and Richard Thomas in the cast, received mixed reviews. His play The Anarchist, starring Patti LuPone and Debra Winger, in her Broadway debut, opened on Broadway on November 13, 2012 in previews and was scheduled to close on December 16, 2012. His 2017 play The Penitent previewed off-Broadway on February 8, 2017.\n\nIn 2002, Mamet was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. Mamet later received the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award for Grand Master of American Theater in 2010.\n\nIn 2017, Mamet released an online class for writers entitled David Mamet teaches dramatic writing.\n\nIn 2019 Mamet returned to the London West End with a new play, Bitter Wheat, at the Garrick Theatre, starring John Malkovich.\n\nIn 2023 it was announced Mamet was writing a new play entitled, Henry Johnson. The production is announced to debut in Los Angeles starring Shia LaBeouf.\n\nFilm\n\nMamet's first film work was as a screenwriter, later directing his own scripts.\n\nAccording to Joe Mantegna, Mamet worked as a script doctor for the 1978 film Towing.\n\nMamet's first produced screenplay was the 1981 production of The Postman Always Rings Twice, based on James M. Cain's novel. He received an Academy Award nomination one year later for the 1982 legal drama, The Verdict. He also wrote the screenplays for The Untouchables (1987), Hoffa (1992), The Edge (1997), Wag the Dog (1997), Ronin (1998), and Hannibal (2001). He received a second Academy Award nomination for Wag the Dog.\n\nIn 1987, Mamet made his film directing debut with his screenplay House of Games, which won Best Screenplay awards at the 1987 Venice Film Festival and the Film of the Year in 1989 from the London Film Critics' Circle Awards. The film starred his then-wife, Lindsay Crouse, and many longtime stage associates and friends, including fellow Goddard College graduates. Mamet was quoted as saying, \"It was my first film as a director and I needed support, so I stacked the deck.\" After House of Games, Mamet later wrote and directed two more films focusing on the world of con artists, The Spanish Prisoner (1997) and Heist (2001). Among those films, Heist enjoyed the biggest commercial success.\n\nOther films that Mamet both wrote and directed include: Things Change (1988), Homicide (1991) (nominated for the Palme d'Or at 1991 Cannes Film Festival and won a \"Screenwriter of the Year\" award for Mamet from the London Film Critics' Circle Awards), Oleanna (1994), The Winslow Boy (1999), State and Main (2000), Spartan (2004), Redbelt (2008), and the 2013 bio-pic TV movie Phil Spector.\n\nA feature-length film, a thriller titled Blackbird, was intended for release in 2015, but is still in development.\n\nWhen Mamet adapted his play for the 1992 film Glengarry Glen Ross, he wrote an additional part (including the monologue \"Coffee's for closers\") for Alec Baldwin.\n\nMamet continues to work with an informal repertory company for his films, including Crouse, William H. Macy, Joe Mantegna, and Rebecca Pidgeon, as well as the aforementioned school friends.\n\nMamet rewrote the script for Ronin under the pseudonym \"Richard Weisz\" and turned in an early version of a script for Malcolm X which was rejected by director Spike Lee. Mamet also wrote an unproduced biopic script about Roscoe Arbuckle with Chris Farley intended to portray him. In 2000, Mamet directed a film version of Catastrophe, a one-act play by Samuel Beckett featuring Harold Pinter and John Gielgud (in his final screen performance). In 2008, he wrote and directed the mixed martial arts movie Redbelt, about a martial arts instructor tricked into fighting in a professional bout.\n\nIn On Directing Film, Mamet advocates for a method of storytelling based on Eisenstein's montage theory, stating that the story should be told through the juxtaposition of uninflected images. This method relies heavily on the cut between scenes, and Mamet urges directors to eliminate as much narration as possible. Mamet asserts that directors should focus on getting the point of a scene across, rather than simply following a protagonist, or adding visually beautiful or intriguing shots. Films should create order from disorder in search of the objective.\n\nIn 2023, reports emerged that Mamet would direct and co-write a new film titled Assassination, his first film since 2008. The film will center around the Chicago Mob ordering the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and will star Viggo Mortensen, Shia LaBeouf, Courtney Love, Al Pacino, and John Travolta. The film's production is scheduled to start in September 2023.\n\nBooks\n\nMamet published the essay collection Writing in Restaurants in 1986, followed by the poetry collection The Hero Pony in 1990. He has also published a series of short plays, monologues and four novels, The Village (1994), The Old Religion (1997), Wilson: A Consideration of the Sources (2000), and Chicago (2018). He has written several non-fiction texts, and children's stories, including True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor (1997). In 2004 he published a lauded version of the classical Faust story, Faustus, however, when the play was staged in San Francisco during the spring of 2004, it was not well received by critics. On May 1, 2010, Mamet released a graphic novel The Trials of Roderick Spode (The Human Ant).\n\nMamet detailed his conversion from modern liberalism to \"a reformed liberal\" in The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture in 2011. Mamet published Three War Stories, a collection of novellas, in 2013, and the political commentary Recessional: The Death of Free Speech and the Cost of a Free Lunch in 2022.\n\nTelevision and radio\n\nMamet wrote one episode of Hill Street Blues, \"A Wasted Weekend\", that aired in 1987. His then-wife, Lindsay Crouse, appeared in numerous episodes (including that one) as Officer McBride. Mamet is also the creator, producer and frequent writer of the television series The Unit, where he wrote a well-circulated memo to the writing staff. He directed a third-season episode of The Shield with Shawn Ryan. In 2007, Mamet directed two television commercials for Ford Motor Company. The two 30-second ads featured the Ford Edge and were filmed in Mamet's signature style of fast-paced dialogue and clear, simple imagery. Mamet's sister, Lynn, is a producer and writer for television shows, such as The Unit and Law & Order.\n\nMamet has contributed several dramas to BBC Radio through Jarvis & Ayres Productions, including an adaptation of Glengarry Glen Ross for BBC Radio 3 and new dramas for BBC Radio 4. The comedy Keep Your Pantheon (or On the Whole I'd Rather Be in Mesopotamia) was aired in 2007. The Christopher Boy's Communion was another Jarvis & Ayres production, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on March 8, 2021.\n\nArchives\n\nThe papers of David Mamet were sold to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 2007 and first opened for research in 2009. The growing collection consists mainly of manuscripts and related production materials for most of his plays, films, and other writings, but also includes his personal journals from 1966 to 2005. In 2015, the Ransom Center secured a second major addition to Mamet's papers, including more recent works. Additional materials relating to Mamet and his career can be found in the Ransom Center's collections of Robert De Niro, Mel Gussow, Tom Stoppard, Sam Shepard, Paul Schrader, Don DeLillo, and John Russell Brown.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMamet and actress Lindsay Crouse married in 1977 and divorced in 1990. The couple have two children. Mamet has been married to actress and singer-songwriter Rebecca Pidgeon since 1991, and they have two children. Mamet and Pidgeon live in Santa Monica, California.\n\nMamet is a Reform Jew and strongly pro-Israel.\n\nPolitical views\n\nIn 2005, Mamet became a contributing blogger for The Huffington Post, drawing satirical cartoons with themes including political strife in Israel. In a 2008 essay at The Village Voice titled \"Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain-Dead Liberal'\" he discussed how his political views had shifted from liberalism to conservatism. In interviews, Mamet has highlighted his agreement with free market theorists such as Friedrich Hayek, the historian Paul Johnson, and economist Thomas Sowell, whom Mamet called \"one of our greatest minds\". In 2022, Mamet declined to explicitly label himself a Republican, but described himself as a conservative who \"would like to conserve those things I grew up with: the love of family, the love of the country, love of service, love of God, love of community\".\n\nDuring promotion of a book, Mamet said British people had \"a taint of anti-semitism,\" claiming they \"want to give [Israel] away to some people whose claim is rather dubious.\" In the same interview, Mamet went on to say that \"there are famous dramatists and novelists [in the UK] whose works are full of anti-Semitic filth.\" He refused to give examples because of British libel laws (the interview was conducted in New York City for the Financial Times). He is known for his pro-Israel positions; in his book The Secret Knowledge he claimed that \"Israelis would like to live in peace within their borders; the Arabs would like to kill them all.\"\n\nMamet endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for president in 2012, and wrote an article for The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles imploring fellow Jewish Americans to vote for Romney.\n\nIn an essay for Newsweek, published on January 29, 2013, Mamet argued against gun control laws: \"It was intended to guard us against this inevitable decay of government that the Constitution was written. Its purpose was and is not to enthrone a Government superior to an imperfect and confused electorate, but to protect us from such a government.\"\n\nMamet has described the NFL anthem protests as \"absolutely despicable\". In a 2020 interview, he described Donald Trump as a \"great president\" and supported his re-election. After Trump lost the election, Mamet appeared to endorse claims that the election had been illegitimate in his 2022 book Recessional: The Death of Free Speech and the Cost of a Free Lunch, though shortly after its publication, he said he \"misspoke\" on the subject.\n\nWorks\n\nPlays\n\nFilmography\n\nFilms\n\nYear Title Director Writer Notes 1981 The Postman Always Rings Twice No Yes 1982 The Verdict No Yes 1987 The Untouchables No Yes House of Games Yes Yes 1988 Things Change Yes Yes 1989 We're No Angels No Yes 1991 Homicide Yes Yes 1992 Glengarry Glen Ross No Yes Also based on his play Hoffa No Yes Also associate producer 1994 Oleanna Yes Yes Also based on his play 1996 American Buffalo No Yes 1997 The Spanish Prisoner Yes Yes The Edge No Yes Wag the Dog No Yes 1998 Ronin No Yes Credited as \"Richard Weisz\" 1999 The Winslow Boy Yes Yes 2000 Lakeboat No Yes Also based on his play State and Main Yes Yes 2001 Hannibal No Yes Heist Yes Yes 2004 Spartan Yes Yes 2005 Edmond No Yes Also based on his play 2008 Redbelt Yes Yes 2023 The Penitent - A Rational Man No Yes Also based on his play 0TBA Assassination No Yes Pre-production\n\nShort films\n\nYear Title Director Writer 2000 Catastrophe Yes No 2010 Inside the Actor's Workshop Yes Yes The Marquee Yes Yes Our Valley Yes Yes Two Painters Yes Yes\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Director Writer Executive\n\nProducer Notes 1987 Hill Street Blues No Yes No TV Series\n\nEpisode \"A Wasted Weekend\" 1992 The Water Engine No Yes No TV Movie\n\nAlso based on his play 1993 A Life in the Theatre No Yes Yes 1994 Texan No Yes No TV Movie 1996 Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants Yes No No TV Special 1999 Lansky No Yes Yes TV Movie 2004 The Shield Yes No No TV Series\n\nEpisode \"Strays\" 2006-2009 The Unit Yes Yes Yes TV Series; also creator\n\nDirected 4 episodes and wrote 11 episodes 2013 Phil Spector Yes Yes Yes TV Movie\n\nActing roles\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1987 Black Widow Herb Theatrical feature film 1992 The Water Engine Brown Haired Man TV Movie 1996 Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist Himself (voice) TV animated series\n\nEpisode: \"New Telephone System\" 2011 The Simpsons TV animated series\n\nEpisode: \"Homer the Father\" 2023 Beau is Afraid Rabbi (voice) Theatrical feature film\n\nUnrealized projects\n\nAce in the Hole remake (1990) – Script for Brian De Palma to direct\n\nCharlie Chan in Horse and Rider (1992) – Script for Warner Bros.\n\nOrdinary Daylight (1992) – Adaptation of the memoir, for Warner Bros.\n\nHigh and Low remake (1993) – Script for Martin Scorsese to direct\n\nJoan of Bark: The Dog That Saved France (2004) - Writer/director, for Columbia Pictures\n\nThe Diary of Anne Frank (2009) - Adaptation of the novel, for Disney Pictures\n\nHave Gun – Will Travel TV series reboot (2013) – Writer/director, for CBS\n\nBlackbird (2013) – Writer/director\n\n7 Deadly Sins TV miniseries (2013) – Writer/director, for Fox\n\nSpeed-the-Plow film adaptation (2016) – Writer/director\n\nThe Force (2017) – Adaptation of the novel, for James Mangold to direct\n\nBooks\n\nWriting in Restaurants (1987)\n\nSome Freaks (1989)\n\nOn Directing Film (1991)\n\nThe Cabin: Reminiscence and Diversions (1992)\n\nThe Village (1994)\n\nMake-Believe Town: Essays and Remembraces (1996)\n\nThe Old Religion (1997)\n\nThree Uses of the Knife (1998)\n\nTrue and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor (1999)\n\nThe Chinaman (1999)\n\nJafsie and John Henry: Essays (1999)\n\nWilson: A Consideration of the Sources (2000)\n\nSouth of the Northeast Kingdom (2002)\n\nFive Cities of Refuge: Weekly Reflections on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy (with Lawrence Kushner) (2003)\n\nThe Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Self-hatred, and the Jews (2006)\n\nBambi Vs.
