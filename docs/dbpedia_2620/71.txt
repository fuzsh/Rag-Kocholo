Hailing from the vibrant, eclectic music scene of Austin, Texas, Temple of Angels, a post-punk band, has been steadily etching out a niche for themselves in the dream pop landscape. With a lineup boasting talents like Bre Morell, Rob Glynn, Cole Tucker, Patrick Todd, and Avery Burton, the band has already made waves with their EPs and singles, including standout tracks like “Waving to the Wind,” “Foiled,” and “Cerise Dream / Breathless.”

Now, they’re perched on the precipice of unveiling their eagerly awaited debut full-length album, Endless Pursuit, set for release on the sun-kissed day of July 14th via Run For Cover Records. Serving up a tantalising taste of what’s to come, they’ve followed up the record’s first two singles, “Tangled In Joy” and “Waving to the Wind,” with a captivating new track, “(For You) I’d Lose It All,” a testament to their ever-blossoming indie rock repertoire.

“(For You) I’d Lose It All” finds guitar/co-vocalist Avery Burton on lead singing duties, his warm croon showcasing another side of the band’s dynamic energy.

The lyrics of this song weave a poetic narrative of a profound love, tinged with an undeniable sense of longing and sacrifice. Each verse encapsulates a desperate yearning for intimate connection, the evocative imagery of lips, eyes, touch, and kiss transforming into poignant symbols of the ache of absence and the sweet sting of remembrance. The recurring motif of the heart on fire alludes to an overpowering desire, a love so potent that it’s challenging to contain yet more arduous to release. It encapsulates the depth of their commitment, underlining the notion that this love, in all its beauty and intensity, is worth every risk, every potential heartbreak.

The song paints the paradox of love that brings the speaker close to completeness, yet also to the precipice of loss – a beautiful yet poignant illustration of the complexities of love.

It’s apt that Endless Pursuit concludes with “(For You) I’d Lose It All,” a track that radiates an enormity and majesty reminiscent of The Chameleons in their prime, potentially marking Temple of Angels’ most anthem-like composition yet. Todd’s voice takes the lead, unfurling a narrative of longing so profound that it engulfs the listener entirely. This is harmoniously juxtaposed with a pulsating rhythm section and elevated by ascendant keyboards in the chorus. The track exudes a kind of rebellious spirit; a determination to embrace an enchanting experience, even in the face of potential heartache.

Established in 2017, Temple of Angels materialized from the edgy undercurrents of the Texas punk and hardcore milieu, crafting a panoramic sonic presence reminiscent of the likes of Cocteau Twins, The Cure, or The Sundays. Endless Pursuit is a resounding album, radiant with gothic allure, signifying the full-fledged emergence of one of the most scintillating bands currently gracing the stage.

The album, deeply influenced by the ghosts of the past and the marvel of the present, exemplifies dream pop at its most striking. Instead of letting the genre’s inherent dreaminess and charm obscure their musical narratives, Temple of Angels cleverly harnesses these traits to spotlight the ephemeral magic of burgeoning love and the poignant disarray associated with loss.

Despite Temple of Angels starting work on Endless Pursuit in 2020, global circumstances and Morell’s relocation to Los Angeles meant that the recording would only kick off in late 2021. In the interim, distanced from friends and partner, Morell began to process the loss of her mother in 2017. She experienced potent nightmares that put her back into traumatic scenarios with her mother, which she says began to “trap me in that trauma.” These dreams, laden with the perpetual sense of something or someone vital missing, resulted in the home feeling alien and the world seemingly askew, form the beating heart of Endless Pursuit.

The album, captured with the assistance of Colin Knight (Death Bells, Fury, Leisure World) and Phillip Odom (Ceremony, Militarie Gun, Portrayal of Guilt) and finely tuned by Will Yip (Turnover, Citizen, Title Fight), radiates with a level of polish and confidence that stands in stark contrast to the challenging circumstances that sparked its creation.
