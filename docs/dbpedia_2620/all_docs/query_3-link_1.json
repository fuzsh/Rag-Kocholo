        "text": "\"On the Side of Angels\" is the title of a song written by Gary Burr and Gerry House, and recorded by American country music artist LeAnn Rimes. It was released in October 1997 as the second and final single from her album You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs. It was also featured on her Greatest Hits (2003) album and her All-Time Greatest Hits (2015) album.\n\n\"Holiday in Your Heart\" Promotion[]\n\n\"On the Side of Angels\" was featured in the 1997 TV movie Holiday in Your Heart, which starred Rimes herself. Being in the movie caused the song to gain unexpected success and acknowledgement, which caused some to consider the song as an \"unofficial/promotional single\". The live performance of the song from the movie has been misinterpreted on YouTube, often circulating around with the label \"music video\".\n\nMusical style[]\n\n\"On the Side of Angels\" is a Christian love song. It is a slow ballad with very strong vocals and a powerful meaning.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nLyrics taken from Metrolyrics.[1]\n\nI've never been so certain\n\nI've never been sure\n\nWe're on the side of angels\n\nIf we believe this love is pure\n\nIs it so hard to trust it\n\n'Cause we've been wrong before?\n\nThere comes a time in every life\n\nWe find the heart we're waiting for\n\nAfter all the 'Might-have-beens'\n\nThe close and distant calls\n\nAfter all the 'Try-agains'\n\nDon't be afraid to fall\n\nWe're on the side of angels after all\n\nEvery time you touch me\n\nDon't you feel it too?\n\nThe gentle hand that's guiding us\n\nYou to me, me to you\n\nAfter all the 'Might-have-beens'\n\nThe close and distant calls\n\nAfter all the 'Try-agains'\n\nDon't be afraid to fall\n\nWe're on the side of angels after all\n\nHeaven only knows\n\nWhy this took so long\n\nBut only Heaven knows\n\nA love is right or wrong\n\nAfter all the 'Might-have-beens'\n\nThe close and distant calls\n\nAfter all the 'Try-agains'\n\nDon't be afraid to fall\n\nWe're on the side of angels\n\nOn the side of angels\n\nOn the side of angels, after all\n\nOoh, yeah\n\nOn the side of angels\n\nOoh\n\nCharts[]\n\nWeekly charts[]\n\nChart (1997-1998) Peak\n\nposition Canada Country Tracks (RPM)[2] 9 US Country Songs (Billboard)[3] 4\n\nYear-end charts[]\n\nChart (1998) Position US Country Songs (Billboard)[4] 65\n\nReferences[]"
