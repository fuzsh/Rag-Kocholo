        "text": "ANGELS & AIRWAVES have today released their third stunning new single “All That’s Left Is Love” .\n\nIt has been reported that in the USA, over 37 million people struggle with hunger. The Covid-19 crisis means that ‘Feeding America‘ – the nations largest hunger relief organisation, predicts there could be an increase of 46% in those at risk of hunger.\n\nBecause of this, the band are teaming up with the charity and will see them donating proceeds from ‘All That’s Left Is Love’ to them.\n\nThey will also be launching an exclusive charity t-shirt that will benefit the organisation.\n\n“Friends – As we are all stuck at home and watching these unfortunate world events unfold, we couldn’t help but notice little glimmers of light showing across the globe- revealing the positive side of humanity that sometimes gets lost in our day-to-day lives. That, ULTIMATELY, is what this band has been about since day 1- HOPE. With all of that in mind, we decided to channel our feelings into a song- of which all proceeds will go to benefit Feeding America’s Covid-19 Response Fund”.\n\nThe single follows on from ‘Rebel Girl‘ and ‘Kiss & Tell‘ which have amassed over 27 million streams between them to date.\n\nLyrics:\n\nDo you ever not open those eyes\n\nto see again, your old life\n\nDo you ever look back to that night\n\nRight before, the world cried\n\nWe have never been here before\n\nTo not love less, to love more\n\nAnd now after all that we’ve seen\n\nYeah I’m sure, it’s for me\n\nWhat we’ll be…..\n\nI wait for winter’s pass, and we\n\ntried to make it last, but it’s\n\nDifficult at best,\n\nWhen our hearts can never rest\n\nAt night it is the worst\n\nAlways say we’re passing first, Then\n\ndelete the messages\n\nThe ones that really hurt\n\nWe, send out a call\n\nlove, runs, from, a, crawl\n\nThe world is different now\n\nWe feel more of us\n\nWhen the days are getting tough\n\nA little bit’s enough\n\nWhen all that’s left is love\n\nSpring has come along, and the\n\nleaves are off the lawn,\n\nWishing I could stop the fear\n\nAs the summer nights come near\n\nWe‘re locked inside our beds, but we\n\nLaugh at what is said,\n\nremember how it all begins\n\nA little smile from your friends\n\nI, gave, you, my, spark\n\nHope, when, things, get, dark\n\nThe world is different now\n\nWe feel more of us\n\nThis place is such a mess\n\nBut we always pass the test\n\nWhen you feel like looking up\n\nWhen the days are getting tough\n\nWe’re gettin’ us that drug\n\nA little bit’s enough\n\nWhen all that’s left is love\n\nLife’ so unreal, so surreal\n\nThe band has also been working on a new album, which will be ANGELS & AIRWAVES first collection of new tracks since 2016’s Chasing Shadows EP.\n\nDeLonge, a founding member of seminal pop punk band Blink-182, formed ANGELS & AIRWAVES in 2005. A year later came debut album “We Don’t Need To Whisper”, which hit No. 4 on The Billboard 200 and featured Top 5 modern rock hit “The Adventure”. 2007’s “I-Empire” followed, hitting No. 9 on The Billboard 200 and featured rock radio hit “Everything’s Magic”.\n\nIn 2010, AVA released “Love” and a year later, “Love: Part Two” accompanied by a critically acclaimed film, “Love”, which was shown in 460 theatres nationwide during a one-night film screening and live-streamed concert event titled Love Live.\n\nThe band’s last full-length album was 2014’s “The Dream Walker”, which hit No. 1 on iTunes and No. 5 on Billboard’s Top Alternative Albums chart. A multimedia project, the album was accompanied by a graphic novel, comic books and a Blade Runner-meets Harry Potter short film, which won Best Animation at the Toronto International Short Film Festival.\n\nIn addition to his work with ANGELS & AIRWAVES, DeLonge created ‘To The Stars’, a multimedia entertainment company that creates original content across music, film, television, and publishing. ‘To The Stars’ content plays an essential role DeLonge’s ‘To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science’, a think tank of artists, scientists, intelligence officers and technology experts that explore, engineer and educate the public about unexplained scientific phenomena. DeLonge currently has a television series (“Strange Times”) in development at TBS and is executive-producing a 6 part docu-series on The History Channel titled “Unidentified: Inside America’s UFO Investigation”. He has composed music for both.\n\n“After my kids, music has and will always be the most important thing in my life” says DeLonge. “It’s given me everything – every opportunity and every relationship I have. There is no stronger art form than rock ‘n’ roll to deliver a galvanising message and at the end of the day, change lives”.\n\nANGELS & AIRWAVES are vocalist/guitarist Tom DeLonge, guitarist David Kennedy and drummer Ilan Rubin, joined by touring bassist Matt Rubano."
