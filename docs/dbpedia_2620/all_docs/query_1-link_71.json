        "text": "As I sit here tonight, the jukebox′s playing\n\nThe tune about the wild side of life\n\nAs I listen to the words you are saying\n\nIt brings mem'ries when I was a trusting wife\n\nIt was′t God who made honky-tonk angels\n\nAs you said in the words of your song\n\nToo many times married men think they're still single\n\nThat has caused many a good girl to go wrong\n\nIt's a shame that all the blame is on us women\n\nIt′s not true that only you men feel the same\n\nFrom the start most every heart that′s ever broken\n\nWas because there always was a man to blame\n\nIt was't God who made honky-tonk angels\n\nAs you said in the words of your song\n\nToo many times married men think they′re still single\n\nThat has caused many a good girl to go wrong\n\nWriter(s): Joseph D. Miller<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
