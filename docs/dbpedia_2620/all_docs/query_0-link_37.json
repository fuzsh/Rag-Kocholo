Dean Taylor\n\nThe Mike Curb Congregation’s ‘Burning Bridges’ enjoyed a 5th week at number 1 with Neil Diamond’s ‘Cracklin’ Rosie’ sitting at 2 for the 2nd week running. So far only 14 out of the 106 chart toppers to date had manged to spend 5 or more weeks there. This works out at 13.2%. By the time the charts ended in 1989 that percentage would have risen to nearly 30%\n\nThe Tremeloes’ ‘Me And My Life’ was the climber of the week, moving up 8 places from 13 to 5. This was The Tremeloes’ 8th time with the biggest climber and they accounted for the 18th time we saw the number of times an act had had the biggest climber match the number of places they climbed to reach that total. So far only Herman’s Hermits and now The Tremeloes had appeared twice in the 18 times as the latter had also reached their 6th biggest climber award with a 6 place jump.\n\nJody Wayne’s ‘A Time For Us (Love Theme From “Romeo & Juliet”)’ was the next biggest climber this week, moving up 6 from 20 to 14. Dave Mills’ ‘All The Tears In The World’ and Giorgio’s ‘Looky Looky’ were the other 2 star raters, both climbing 4 places to land at 8 and 15 respectively.\n\nThere were 3 songs that took the biggest faller award this week and they were Michael Holm’s ‘Mademoiselle Ninnette’, Chris Andrews’ ‘Brown Eyes’ and Creedence Clearwater Revival’s ‘Lookin’ Out My Back Door’ which all fell 4 places to land at 9, 10 and 11 respectively.\n\nThis week was the 9th time we had seen 5 songs leave the chart with only 1 week seeing more and that was when we had 6 songs leave.\n\nFirst to go was The Kinks’ ‘Lola’. It had been with us for 12 weeks, 2 of which had been spent at number 1. This was their only chart toper of their 6 hits to date and the only one to last more than 10 weeks in the chart. They had 1 more hit to come.\n\nJames Lloyd’s ‘Keep On Smiling’ also left the charts. It had been with us for 13 weeks and managed to get to 6 during that time. This would not be Lloyd’s only SA chart hit.\n\nAs ‘Keep On Smiling’ was the oldest on last week’s chart, we now had to look to Michael Holm’s ‘Mademoiselle Ninnette’ for the granddaddy of the top 20. It was on 12 weeks.\n\nDickie Loader’s ‘Poor Little Rich Girl’ spent 6 weeks with us and managed to peak at 7 during that time. This was the lowest weeks count of his 3 hits to date, his next best being 10, but its peaked was equal highest. Loader was not yet done with featuring in our charts.\n\nTom Jones’ ‘I (Who Have Nothing)’ finished its chart run with 7 weeks to its name and a peak of 4. It spent its last week in the charts at number 11. Of Jones’ 15 hits to date, only ‘Help Yourself’ had a higher last week position as that left the top 20 from position 10. Jones illustrious SA chart career was still a little way from being over.\n\nSam Evans’ ‘Ain’t Love A Funny Thing’ was the last of the leavers. It spent 7 weeks in the charts and peaked at 6. This was the 27th song to leave the charts from within the top 10 (its last week was spent at 10) and only the second local song to do so, the previous one being Tidal Wave’s ‘Spider Spider’ which spent its last week at 9.\n\nBlack Sabbath’s Paranoid’ was the first of the new entries this week. The song was written quickly and intended as a 3 minute ‘filler’ for the Sabs’ second album (which was originally going to be called ‘War Pigs’ after the song of that name) and like a good number of ‘throwaway’ songs has gone on to become a classic. It made number 4 in the UK and 61 in the US. In Iceland the song has a sort of cult status as apparently at most music concerts, no matter who the band are, or their style of music, someone will always shout out at least once ‘play Paranoid!’\n\nThe second new entry was the second song written by Joni Mitchell to chart in SA. Mitchell herself would never see any chart action on our fair shores, but she had seen her composition, ‘Both Sides Now’ chart for Steve Lonsdale and this week it was ‘Woodstock’ that saw her reaping some more royalties. Also sharing in the royalties was Matthew’s Southern Comfort who were performing the song. The Matthew in the group’s name was Iain Matthews who had been in Fairport Convention and this version would top the UK charts for 3 weeks. In the US it would be Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s version that would perform the best in 1970, going to number 11 there. The Assembled Multitude also had a hit with the song but their version would only get to 79 in 1970. Matthew’s Southern Comfort would eventually see their version chart in the US in the March of 1971 when it went to number 23. Mitchell wrote the songs about the well-known music festival although she did not attend it herself, rather performing on The Dick Cavett Show, but later feeling she had missed out. Her version can be found on her ‘Ladies Of The Canyon’ album.\n\nThe song that ‘Woodstock’ took over from at number 1 in the UK was our next new entry and that was Freda Payne’s ‘Band Of Gold’ which helped break the 17 week drought of solo female artists in the chart. ‘Band Of Gold’ had spent a total of 6 weeks at the top of the UK charts and would get to number 3 in the US and 5 in The Netherlands. It would be her only top 10 hit on both sides of the Atlantic although she would have a total of 6 US Hot 100 hits, 3 of which (including ‘Band Of Gold’) would also chart in the UK. Other versions of the song to chart would be Bonnie Tyler’s 1986 cover (81 in the UK), Belinda Carlisle’s 86/87 version (91 in Canada) and Kimberley Locke’s 2007/08 cover (#1 on the US Hit Dance Club Play chart).\n\nFrom not having any solo female artists in the charts, we suddenly had 2 as Petula Clark became the 22nd act to have a gap of 100 weeks or more between hits as her new one this week, ‘Melody Man’ came 110 weeks after she was last seen in the top 20. This was also the 2nd biggest gap between hits for a woman with Jackie Trent’s 152 weeks leading the way. ‘Melody Man’ was Petula’s 10th hit to chart in SA and she became the 7th act and first woman to reach double figures for number of hits. Of the 7 acts to make this milestone so far, 1 was an American act (Percy Sledge) with the remaining 6 all being British. ‘Melody Man’ was written by an Australian chap called Tony Cole and it was his first SA chart hit. Clark’s version would fail to chart in the US or the UK, but did make it to 25 in Cole’s native Australia.\n\nOur final new entry set a new record for gaps between hits by a Canadian artist as R Dean Taylor returned to the charts 108 weeks after he last featured in the top 20. He was the 23rd act to have a gap of 100 weeks or more and his was the 18th biggest gap to date. It was also the 16th song by a Canadian act to chart and the Canadians sat 4th overall for number of hits behind the US, the UK and SA. His new song was ‘Indiana Wants Me’ which would be a number 2 hit for him in both the UK and his native Canada. In the US it would make number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and would top the alternate US charts listed in Cashbox magazine. Some versions of the song don’t include the police sirens that other versions had as some radio stations were getting complaints that drivers were pulling over when they heard the sirens.\n\nThis week saw the 31st occasion where the number of hits in the top 20 by acts from The UK equalled that for acts from The US as both nations had 6 in the charts. The local hit count, however dropped to 4 with Dickie Loader and Sam Evans leaving the chart.\n\nOn the weeks count list Petula Clark and Chris Andrews shook off Four Jacks & A Jill and The Tremeloes to take 17th place for themselves. They were both on 69 weeks.\n\nThe ‘Love Theme From Romeo & Juliet’ moved into tied 18th place for songs charting in more than 1 version as between Henry Mancini’s instrumental version and Jody Wayne’s vocal one it had clocked up a total of 10 weeks which equalled that of ‘New York Mining Disaster 1941’ (Bee Gees & The Staccatos), ‘Laura (What’s He Got That I Ain’t Got)’ (Frankie Laine & Brook Benton) and ‘Am I That Easy to Forget?’ (Jim Reeves & Engelbert Humperdinck).\n\nThe average weeks that the songs on the top 20 had been with us dropped below 5 for the first time in 16 weeks as it fell to 4.4.\n\nYoutube playlist:\n\nPos LW Weeks Song Artist 1 1 6 Burning Bridges – Mike Curb Congregation 2 9 3 Cracklin’ Rosie – Neil Diamond 3 5 6 Cha-La-La, I Need You – Shuffles 4 8 5 Candida – Dawn 5 2 11 Mademoiselle Ninette – Michael Holm 6 4 10 Brown Eyes – Chris Andrews 7 3 7 Lookin’ Out My Back Door – Creedence Clearwater Revival 8 11 4 Like I Do – Barbara Ray & 5th Association 9 15 4 Montego Bay – Bobby Bloom 10 7 7 Ain’t Love a Funny Thing – Sam Evans 11 6 7 I (Who Have Nothing) – Tom Jones 12 13 4 All the Tears in the World – Dave Mills 13 18 2 Me and My Life – Tremeloes 14 19 2 Black Night – Deep Purple 15 20 2 Stand Up for the Lady – Rising Sons 16 10 6 Poor Little Rich Girl – Dickie Loader 17 12 13 Keep on Smiling – James Lloyd 18 14 12 Lola – Kinks 19 New 1 Looky Looky – Giorgio 20 New 1 A Time for Us (Love Theme From “Romeo & Juliet”) – Jody Wayne\n\n‘Burning Bridges’ entered its 4th week at the top of the charts and had seen off Michael Holm’s ‘Mademoiselle Ninnette’ which dropped from 2 to 5. The new number 2 was this weeks’ biggest climber and that was Neil Diamond’s ‘Cracklin’ Rosie’ which moved up 7 places from 9 to 2. This was the second week running that the song had been the biggest climber and the 3rd week running that the biggest climb had been 7 places. So far we had not seen more than 3 weeks in a row with the biggest climb being the same number of places. This was the 11th occasion where we had 3 weeks running with the same number of places being the biggest climb.\n\nIncluding ‘Cracklin’ Rosie’ there was a total of 6 star raters this week. This was the tied second highest number of star raters we had seen to date with 1 week having 7 and only 1 other seeing 6. Bobby Bloom’s ‘Montego Bay’ was the biggest climbing of the 5 other star raters, moving up 6 from 15 to 9. There were 3 songs which climbed 5 places and those were The Tremeloes’ ‘Me And My Life’ which landed at 13, Deep Purple’s ‘Black Night’ which climbed to 14 and The Rising Sons’ ‘Stand Up For The Lady’ which ended up at 15. Dawn’s ‘Candida’ was the final one to climb 4 or more places and it moved up 4 from 8 to 4. If one added up the total of places moved up by the top 20 songs then this week saw the tied 7th highest total for upward movement to date with the top 20 songs climbing a total of 38 places. This was 8 less than the record to date 46.\n\nDickie Loader saw his 3 hits to date now have a 100% record at being the biggest faller as ‘Poor Little Rich Girl’ followed his 2 previous hits in taking the award. It fell 6 places from 10 to 16.\n\nJames Lloyd was still smiling as his hit ‘Keep On Smiling’ entered its 13th week with us and enjoyed its 3rd as the oldest on the charts. This was the first of only 6 songs by Jamaican artists to be the oldest at some point during its top 20 career.\n\nPercy Sledge’s ‘Push Mr Pride Aside’ was the first of 2 songs to leave the chart this week. It had been with us for 10 weeks and peaked at 7. So far of Sledge’s 11 hits to date, 5 managed to reach double figures for weeks and 6 managed to get into the top 10. The departure of ‘Push Mr Pride Aside’ brought to an end Sledge’s current run in the charts. He had had at least 1 hit in the top 20 for 24 straight weeks and this fell 1 short of his best run of 25 weeks in a row with at least 1 in the top 20. There had been 14 acts so far to manage a run of 24 weeks or more with a song in the charts and Percy Sledge was the only one of these to have managed it twice.\n\nAlso leaving the charts was The Archies’ ‘Sunshine’. It had been with us for just 2 weeks and peaked at 16, the lowest weeks and peak figures for any of their hits so far. The good news for both Percy Sledge and The Archies was that they each had 1 more hit to come.\n\nGiorgio Moroder, going under the name of Giorgio, brought us the first of the new entries in the form of ‘Looky Looky’. The song, which he penned alongside a guy called Peter Rainford, charted in Switzerland and Germany, going to 3 and 26 in those respective charts, as well as reaching number 13 in what was then Rhodesia. Hailing from South Tyrol in Northern Italy, Moroder was the second Italian act to chart. This followed the success in 1965 of Nini Rosso with ‘Goodbye My Love’. The gap between Italian hits was 263 weeks which was the biggest gap to date that a nation had seen between hits with the 192 weeks between hits for act from Spain being the second biggest. By the time the charts finished in 1989, the biggest gap for a nation would have increased to 560 weeks and this effort by the Italians would have been relegated to 8th place.\n\nJody Wayne returned to the charts with his new one, ‘A Time for Us (Love Theme From “Romeo & Juliet”)’ which was his 5th hit to date. Wayne was now the 6th local act to clock up at least 5 hits. As the title of the song suggests, it was the ‘Love Theme’ from Franco Zeffirelli’s 1968 film adaptation of Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo & Juliet’. However, it was the instrumental version by Nino Rota that featured in the film. The words were later written by Larry Kusik and Eddie Snyder and these would be recorded by Johnny Mathis and Andy Williams amongst others. The most successful version of the song to chart had been Henry Mancini’s instrumental version which had topped the US charts. It also managed to get to number 4 on our charts in 1969 and was now the 23rd song to chart with us in more than 1 version. Jody Wayne boosted the local hit count up to 6 again, the first time it had seen that level for 22 weeks.\n\nThis week marked the 17th consecutive one where we did not have any solo females in the chart and this equalled the length of the previous womanless time we had had and was tied 2nd longest period we had gone with no women. The longest drought so far was 22 weeks.\n\nWe also saw an equal number of hits from US and UK acts on the charts with each nation contributing 5. This was the 30th time we had seen an equal contribution from these 2 musical giants. However, there were 6 local songs sitting in the top 20 and this was the 3rd time we had seen the locals outdo the acts from both the UK and the US.\n\nChris Andrews saw his weeks count move on to 68 and in so doing he moved tied 17th on the weeks count list sitting alongside Four Jacks & A Jill and Petula Clark. On the local list Jody Wayne moved 1 week ahead of Murray Campbell and so made 7th place his own while Campbell fell to 8th.\n\nOn the points front there were 2 artists that reach big milestones and they were Tom Jones who crossed the 2,000 mark. He was way out in front, 719 points ahead of his nearest rival, The Troggs. To put that in perspective, only 19 of the 363 acts to chart so far had a total points tally in excess of 719.\n\nChris Andrews was the other one hitting a major milestone as his count ticked past the 1,000 level. He was the 8th act to reach this many points.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival also celebrated a milestone as they moved past the 900 points mark. They sat 14th overall.\n\nYoutube playlist:\n\nPos LW Weeks Song Artist 1 1 5 Burning Bridges – Mike Curb Congregation 2 3 10 Mademoiselle Ninette – Michael Holm 3 2 6 Lookin’ Out My Back Door – Creedence Clearwater Revival 4 5 9 Brown Eyes – Chris Andrews 5 8 5 Cha-La-La, I Need You – Shuffles 6 4 6 I (Who Have Nothing) – Tom Jones 7 6 6 Ain’t Love a Funny Thing – Sam Evans 8 13 4 Candida – Dawn 9 16 2 Cracklin’ Rosie – Neil Diamond 10 7 5 Poor Little Rich Girl – Dickie Loader 11 14 3 Like I Do – Barbara Ray & 5th Association 12 11 12 Keep on Smiling – James Lloyd 13 15 3 All the Tears in the World – Dave Mills 14 9 11 Lola – Kinks 15 17 3 Montego Bay – Bobby Bloom 16 19 2 Sunshine – Archies 17 10 10 Push Mr. Pride Aside – Percy Sledge 18 New 1 Me and My Life – Tremeloes 19 New 1 Black Night – Deep Purple 20 New 1 Stand Up for the Lady – Rising Sons\n\nIt was now 3 weeks in a row at 1 for The Mike Curb Congregation’s ‘Burning Bridges’ while Creedence Clearwater Revival’s challenge with ‘Lookin’ Out My Back Door’ faded a little as the song dropped to 3, letting Michael Holm’s ‘Mademoiselle Ninette’ climbed 1 place into the number 2 spot.\n\nNeil Diamond picked up his 2nd biggest climber award as ‘Cracklin’ Rosie’ moved up 7 places from 16 to 9. The only other song to move up 4 or more places was Dawn’s ‘Candida’ which climbed from 13 to 8 to be the other star rater this week.\n\nThe biggest faller award went to Percy Sledge’s ‘Push Mr Pride Aside’ which dropped 7 places from 10 to 17. This was his 8th time with the award. Only Tom Jones and The Bee Gees, who were both on 10, had seen more biggest fallers. So far 7 of Percy’s 11 hits to date had been a biggest faller with ‘What Am I Living For’ being the only one to manage it twice.\n\nThe Marmalade’s ‘Rainbow’ was the first of 3 songs to leave the chart this week. It had been with us for 6 weeks and peaked at 13, their lowest weeks and peak figures to date, however, we were not yet done with seeing the band in our top 20.\n\nCat Steven’s ‘Lady D’Arbanville’ was also a leaver this week. It had been with us for 10 weeks and peaked at 2. The weeks count equalled that of his only other hit to date, ‘Mathew And Son’, but the peak was 2 places lower than that of its predecessor.\n\nThe last to go was Hotlegs’ ‘Neanderthal Man’. During its 11 week run with us it managed to get as high as number 2. This would be Hotlegs’ only SA chart hit, however the band would morph into 10cc who would chart on our charts. ‘Neanderthal Man’ shared the oldest on the chart title last week with James Lloyd’s ‘Keep On Smiling’. The latter continued its chart run so was the solitary oldest in the top 20 now, sitting on 12 weeks.\n\n‘Me And My Life’ was The Tremeloes’ 6th song to chart on our top 20 and they were the 30th act to reach this many hits. The song would get to number 4 in the UK as well as going to number 5 in Austria, 6 in Germany and what was then Rhodesia and number 27 in Holland. This was the 3rd of their 6 hits to date that was written by band members Len ‘Chip’ Hawkes and Alan Blaikley.\n\nThe last time Deep Purple was on our charts was exactly 100 week previously when ‘Hush’ was spending its last week with us. Only 1 other act would see a gap of exactly 100 weeks between hits. The new one for Deep purple was ‘Black Night’ and it was their first single that they had penned themselves. They would also produce the track and it would go to number 2 in the UK where it spent 2 weeks while Freda Payne’s ‘Band Of Gold’ held on to the top spot there. In the US it made it to number 66 and is the second lowest peak of their 8 hits to chart there so far.\n\nThe last new entry was by local band, The Rising Sons. ‘Stand Up For The Lady’ was written by The Bats’ Paul Ditchfield and produced by Billy Forrest. The band was formed in Pietermaritzburg in 1966 and a couple of years after this hit they would see Dennis East join then as vocalist for a while.\n\nNeil Diamond reached the 20 weeks in the chart mark while local lad Dave Mills was celebrating reaching double that, his 40 weeks to date giving him 4th place on the local weeks count list to himself while Gene Rockwell, whom he shared the spot with last week, fell to 5. On the overall weeks count list, Percy Sledge was now the outright number 2 artist with his 102 weeks putting him 1 ahead of The Troggs who fell to 3rd place. Creedence Clearwater Revival shook off Donovan to have 15th place themselves with 71 weeks and Chris Andrews’ addition to his total this week knocked The Seekers into 20th place. Andrews was on 67 weeks. The Tremeloes, who fell off the top 20 of the weeks count list last week were back again as their 66 to date placed them tied 20th with The Seekers. Aside from Dave Mills mentioned above, Dickie Loader was also clocking up the weeks, but his 28 to date merely served to leave him at number 10, but no longer shared the spot with Billy Forrest.\n\nYoutube playlist:\n\nPos LW Weeks Song Artist 1 1 4 Burning Bridges – Mike Curb Congregation 2 5 5 Lookin’ Out My Back Door – Creedence Clearwater Revival 3 2 9 Mademoiselle Ninette – Michael Holm 4 4 5 I (Who Have Nothing) – Tom Jones 5 3 8 Brown Eyes – Chris Andrews 6 9 5 Ain’t Love a Funny Thing – Sam Evans 7 10 4 Poor Little Rich Girl – Dickie Loader 8 15 4 Cha-La-La, I Need You – Shuffles 9 6 10 Lola – Kinks 10 8 9 Push Mr. Pride Aside – Percy Sledge 11 14 11 Keep on Smiling – James Lloyd 12 7 11 Neanderthal Man – Hotlegs 13 16 3 Candida – Dawn 14 19 2 Like I Do – Barbara Ray & 5th Association 15 18 2 All the Tears in the World – Dave Mills 16 New 1 Cracklin’ Rosie – Neil Diamond 17 20 2 Montego Bay – Bobby Bloom 18 11 10 Lady D’Arbanville – Cat Stevens 19 New 1 Sunshine – Archies 20 13 6 Rainbow – Marmalade\n\nThe Mike Curb Congregation’s ‘Burning Bridges’ enjoyed a second week at number 1 while Creedence Clearwater Revival’s ‘Lookin’ Out My Back Door’ moved up 3 places to number 2 to be the main threat to Mike Curb’s supremacy. Creedence, whose first 2 hits went to number 1, were looking to capture former glories as they had had 4 hits since their chart toppers with a best peak for them being number 3.\n\nThe Shuffles ignored their name and motored up the charts. Their 7 place climb from 15 to 8 was the biggest upward movement this week. This was the second time a Dutch act had taken the biggest climber award, but it fell 1 place short of the 8 places the previous Dutch act had managed when The George Baker Selection moved up 8 in a week with ‘Little Green Bag’.\n\nBarbara Ray & The 5th Association’s ‘Like I Do’ was the only other star rater this week, climbing 5 places from 19 to 14.\n\nThere were 2 fallers of the week, both dropping 7 places. The first was The Marmalade’s ‘Rainbow’ which fell from 13 to 20 to give the band their 3rd such award while Cat Stevens picked up his first with ‘Lady D’Arbanville’ which dropped from 11 to 18.\n\nJody Wayne’s ‘The Wedding’ was the first of 2 songs to leave the chart this week. It had been with us for 15 weeks and spent a total of 3 of them at number 1 in a run of 2 weeks, then returning to the top spot 2 weeks later for a further week. This was Wayne’s best performing song to date.\n\nThe departure of ‘The Wedding’ from the charts meant that we now had 2 new oldest in the top 20 and those were James Lloyd’s ‘Keep On Smiling’ and Hotlegs’ ‘Neanderthal Man’ which were both in 11 weeks.\n\nAlso leaving the charts was Nicky Thomas’ ‘Love Of The Common People’ which peaked at 7 during a 7 week run. This was the 22nd song to have an equal weeks and peaks figure and, keeping with a ‘7’ theme, it was the 7th time a song had had a weeks and peak figure of 7. Unlike Jody Wayne, Thomas would not re-appear on our charts and this would be his only SA chart hit. Silly fact of the week – both acts leaving the chart had surnames that are also common first names.\n\nNeil Diamond returned to the chart with ‘Cracklin’ Rosie’, his third hit to date. As with his previous 2 hits, Diamond composed the song and this was now his 6th hit as a song writer as 2 of his compositions had been hits for The Monkees and 1 had been a hit for Cliff Richard. ‘Cracklin’ Rosie’ was Diamond’s 19th Billboard Hot 100 hit, the 5th to go top 10 there and his first number 1 hit in the US, spending just 1 week at the top spot. In the UK it was his first hit to chart and it went to number 3. He has since had 15 UK chart hit, but this still remains his highest peak to date there. The song would also top the charts in Norway and what was then Rhodesia. The title of the song apparently refers to a sparkling wine with Rosie being substituted for Rosé.\n\nThe Archies brought some brightness to the charts with their 7th SA chart hit to date, ‘Sunshine’. The song was written by Bobby Bloom and Jeff Barry. This was Barry’s 12th hit to date as a song writer and this put him in 5th place on his own for number of hits by a song writer. Bobby Bloom was enjoying his 5th hit as song writer. As the duo of song writers had also penned ‘Montego Bay’, Bloom’s hit as an artist, they both had 2 compositions in the chart this week. For Bloom it was a first time and he became the 65th song writer to manage this while for Barry it was his 14th week with 2 in the charts. The overall leader for this was Les Reed who had seen 37 weeks with more than 1 composition in the chart. ‘Sunshine’ would go to number 57 in the US and 26 in Germany.\n\nWith both new entries being by American acts, the Yanks overtook the Poms for number of hits in the top 20 as they now had 7 compared to the 6 from British acts. So far we had had 131 weeks with more British acts on the charts than Americans, 121 weeks where the Americans led the way and 29 weeks where the hits tally was equal for the 2 nations. There had been 4 occasions when there were more local hits on the charts than British ones and a further 4 weeks when the local talent had outdone the Americans.\n\nCat Stevens reached the 20 weeks in the chart mark and Creedence Clearwater Revival celebrated their 70th week with us. This put the latter in tied 15th place on the weeks count list, sharing the position with Donovan. Right up at the top of the list, Percy Sledge moved into tied 2nd place with The Troggs. Both acts were now on 101 weeks, but were still a good way behind leader Tom Jones who sat on 163 and still counting. Chris Andrews moved tied 19th with The Seekers as their weeks counts were both 66. The Tremeloes fell off the top 20 of the list.\n\nThere was also some action near the top of the local weeks count list with Dave Mills moving into tied 4th place with Gene Rockwell with 39 weeks to his name. Dickie Loader caught up with Billy Forrest and the 2 sat tied 10th with 27 weeks each.\n\nYoutube playlist:\n\nPos LW Weeks Song Artist 1 3 3 Burning Bridges – Mike Curb Congregation 2 2 8 Mademoiselle Ninette – Michael Holm 3 1 7 Brown Eyes – Chris Andrews 4 6 4 I (Who Have Nothing) – Tom Jones 5 10 4 Lookin’ Out My Back Door – Creedence Clearwater Revival 6 5 9 Lola – Kinks 7 4 10 Neanderthal Man – Hotlegs 8 7 8 Push Mr. Pride Aside – Percy Sledge 9 12 4 Ain’t Love a Funny Thing – Sam Evans 10 13 3 Poor Little Rich Girl – Dickie Loader 11 8 9 Lady D’Arbanville – Cat Stevens 12 9 7 Love of the Common People – Nicky Thomas 13 14 5 Rainbow – Marmalade 14 15 10 Keep on Smiling – James Lloyd 15 18 3 Cha-La-La, I Need You – Shuffles 16 19 2 Candida – Dawn 17 11 15 The Wedding – Jody Wayne 18 New 1 All the Tears in the World – Dave Mills 19 New 1 Like I Do – Barbara Ray & 5th Association 20 New 1 Montego Bay – Bobby Bloom\n\nThe Mike Curb Congregation’s ‘Burning Bridges’ was the 11th song to take just 3 weeks to get to number 1, with only 1 song (Shocking Blue’s ‘Venus) doing so in 2 weeks. No song had entered the top 20 at number 1. ‘Burning Bridges’ leapfrogged Michael Holm’s ‘Mademoiselle Ninette’ which remained unmoved at 2 to knock Chris Andrews’ ‘Brown Eyes’ off the top spot after the latter had been there for 2 weeks. ‘Burning Bridges’ was the 40th song by an American act to top our charts. The Americans were 8 behind the Brits for number of number 1s with local acts in 3rd place with 14.\n\nAnd talking of 14, this was the 14th consecutive week we had been without a solo female artist in the charts, our 3rd highest run to date for being womanless.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival picked up a 4th biggest climber award as ‘Lookin Out My Back Door’ climbed 5 places from 10 to 5. This would be the only star rater climb this week.\n\nThe faller of the week award went to Jody Wayne’s ‘The Wedding’ which dropped 6 places from 11 to 17. This was Wayne’s second time with the biggest faller and the previous time that he experienced this was as one half of a duet with Glenys Lynne. The good news for Jody was that this was the first week he had the oldest song on the chart with ‘The Wedding’ being on 15 weeks. This came about by the departure of Mungo Jerry’s ‘In The Summertime’ which lasted 15 weeks in the top 20 and spent a third of those (5 weeks for those too lazy to calculate the number) at number 1. Mungo Jerry would grace our charts again.\n\nAlso leaving the top 20 was Nilsson’s ‘Everybody’s Talkin’ which spent 5 weeks in the chart and peaked at 11. Like Mungo Jerry, we would see Nilsson in the top 20 again.\n\nThe 3rd of the trio of songs to depart the chart was Johnny Collini’s ‘That’s Why God Made the World’. It managed 8 weeks and peaked at 13, but unlike the other 2 artists leaving the chart this week, Collini would not return and this would be his only hit on the top 20.\n\n‘All The Tears In The World’ was the first of the new entries this week and it was a 3rd SA chart hit for Dave Mills. As with his previous 2 hits, Terry Dempsey was listed as song writer and he was joined again by Robin Netcher who also co-wrote ‘Love Is A Beautiful Song’ for Mills. Dempsey now had 8 hits to his name where he was listed as song writer and Netcher was sitting on 2. The interesting thing about ‘All The Tears In The World’ was that it appeared on the b-side of ‘Love Is A Beautiful Song’ which had been a hit earlier in 1970.\n\nThe second new entry was also by a local act and it was an SA chart debut for Barbara Ray. Teaming up with The 5th Association, Barbara’s new entry was ‘Like I Do’, a song written by Richard Manning and was first recorded by Nancy Sinatra in 1962 and according Wikipedia that version went to number 2 in South Africa. This would have been before the official charts started and it seems that Radio South Africa was producing some kind of chart which was listed in Billboard magazine’s ‘Hits Of The World’ section. In 1963 Maureen Evans recorded a version and that went to number 3 in the UK and number 5 in Ireland. Barbra Ray’s version was produced by the man who sat 2 places higher in the charts than ‘Like I Do’, Jody Wayne. The arrival of Dave Mills and Barbara Ray onto and the departure of Johnny Collini from the charts meant that the local hit count was 5.\n\nBobby Bloom became the 9th act to date to chart first as a song writer then as an artist. Bloom had helped write 2 of The 1910 Fruitgum Company’s hits as well as Tommy James & The Shondells’ ‘Mony Mony’ and he now charted as artist and co-writer on ‘Montego Bay’. He shared the song writing credits with Jeff Barry and this was Barry’s 11th SA chart hit to date as a composer. He sat tied 5th for number of hits by a song writer, sharing the spot with Robin Gibb. ‘Montego Bay’ would go to number 3 in the UK and 8 in the US. The song has been covered a number of time, charting in the UK for Freddie Notes & The Rudies (#45), Sugar Cane (#54) and Amazulu (#16). The Amazulu version would also go to number 90 in the US. Jon Stevens would take a cover of it to number 1 in New Zealand (knocking his own ‘Jezebel’ off the top spot after the latter had been at number 1 for 9 weeks).\n\nPercy Sledge celebrated becoming only the 3rd act so far to reach the 100 weeks in the chart mark. The Troggs on 101 and Tom Jones on 162 were the 2 acts above him. This would be the first time we would see 2 centurions in the top 20 together as both the weeks that The Troggs had been in the charts with their total at 100 and 101, Tom Jones was not. In total only 33 acts would reach this 100 weeks.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival pulled 1 week clear of Four Jacks & A Jill and Petula Clark, giving them position 16 on the weeks count list to themselves while the latter 2 fell to 17th. Chris Andrews re-entered the top 20 of the weeks count list, his 65 to date putting him tied 20th with The Tremeloes. On the local list Jody Wayne’s 33 weeks put him tied 7th with Murray Campbell while Dickie Loader moved 1 week clear of Ken J. Larkin, his 26 weeks giving him 11th position to himself while Larkin fell to 12th.\n\nYoutube playlist:"
