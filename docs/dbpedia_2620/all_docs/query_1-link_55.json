        "text": "Since 2019, Angels & Airwaves have shared three new tracks — \"All That's Left Is Love,\" \"Kiss and Tell\" and\" Rebel Girl — but it doesn't sound like any of them will appear on the band's upcoming album. Frontman Tom DeLonge spent the weekend teasing new content. On Saturday (April 3), he shared a photo teasing the project's lead single and when fans can expect to hear it. \"@angelsandairwaves 1st single and music video coming in a few weeks,\" he wrote on Instagram. He followed that up with a post captioned \"Music video #3 in the can\" — sounds like they've been busy!\n\nSee both posts below.\n\nDeLonge started talking about the single last month, when a fan lamented about his beloved blink-182 side project, Boxer Car Racer, only putting out one album.\n\n\"Box Car Racer is one of the best albums I've ever listened to, personally. I really wish it had continued,\" the fan tweeted. \"I know Tom DeLonge says that Angels & Airwaves is a continuation of BCR, but none of AvA's albums have the same feel at all. (And I love all of AvA's stuff too)\"\n\nThe message caught the eyes of DeLonge, who responded: \"Stay tuned then for this first single from the new @AVABandOfficial album. Very BCR and that’s also why Rich Costey is mixing it, because he mixed the BCR album... As he gave it that feel u are describing.\"\n\nWithout giving any specific details about the new collection of songs, DeLonge has pumped fans up for its release, declared it AVA's \"best yet\" on several occasions.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images"
