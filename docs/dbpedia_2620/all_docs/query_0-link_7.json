        "text": "The Tony Brown Interview, Part Four\n\nLongtime Los Angeles Times music editor Robert Hilburn published the ultimate Tony Brown profile in 1996. In “The Kingmaker of Country Music,” you stated, “Sometimes an artist just isn’t on the right label. It’s a sin to me the way that some labels hang onto them to spite the artist.” I interviewed Mo Pitney in October 2017, a year after his acclaimed debut LP Behind This Guitar dropped on the Nashville-based Curb label. You produced that Billboard Top Ten C&W record. After an agonizing four-year wait, Pitney’s follow-up materialized but any momentum was lost."
