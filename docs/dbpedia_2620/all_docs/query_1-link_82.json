        "text": "Lazy Days\n\nRobbie Williams - Lazy Days\n\nThis was Robbie's third ever single, and saw him continue down the indie-pop path for his first album.\n\nThe hedonistic track wasn't a massive hit at the time, but it was a sign of things to come from the former boyband member.\n\nTripping\n\nRobbie Williams - Tripping\n\nThe lead single from his 2005 album Intensive Care, this reggae-tinged track was nothing like we'd heard before from Robbie.\n\nRobbie himself calls the song \"something like a mini gangster opera\" and \"kind of cabaret act reggae\".\n\nEternity\n\nRobbie Williams - Eternity\n\nNot as well remembered as some of his other number ones, this was a double-A side with 'The Road to Mandalay'.\n\nIt was apparently a tribute to Robbie's close friendship with Spice Girls star Geri Halliwell at the time.\n\nMixed Signals\n\nRobbie Williams | Mixed Signals (Official Video)\n\nA single from his Heavy Entertainment Show album, you can tell that it was co-written by Killers frontman Brandon Flowers.\n\nThe incredibly catchy pop-rock anthem sees Robbie jealous and paranoid about his partner's actions. The video had two different endings, where his on-screen partner was revealed to be having an affair with either Robbie's wife Ayda or Gary Barlow!\n\nYou Know Me\n\nRobbie Williams | You Know Me (Official Video)\n\nThis was the second single from his 2009 comeback album Reality Killed the Video Star.\n\nIn the video, he falls asleep and wakes up dressed as a rabbit in a waistcoat, and explores a fantasy world based on Alice in Wonderland.\n\nShe's Madonna\n\nRobbie Williams, Pet Shop Boys - She's Madonna\n\nRobbie teamed up with the Pet Shop Boys for this track, which they co-wrote and featured on.\n\nThe song is a reference to a conversation he had with ex-girlfriend Tania Strecker, over the reason her former boyfriend Guy Ritchie gave, for leaving her for singer Madonna.\n\nRobbie played the song to Madonna shortly after writing it, receiving a positive reaction. Its music video featured a plethora of well-known drag queens, and showed Williams himself in full drag queen regalia.\n\nCandy\n\nRobbie Williams - Candy\n\nCo-written with his Take That bandmate Gary Barlow, this provided Robbie with his seventh solo number one in 2012.\n\nWhile most of the lyrics are nonsensical, it tells the story of a girl who thinks she’s perfect.\n\nHe said: “Some songs take an age to write and some songs just fall out of your mouth completely formed, and you don’t have to think about it. I don’t know why that fell out of my mouth and out of my brain at that particular time – it just did.”\n\nGo Gentle\n\nRobbie Williams | Go Gentle (Official Music Video)\n\nThe lead single from his second swing album in 2013, Robbie said that it is a promise to his daughter Teddy.\n\nFather's Day songs: 16 emotional tracks by and about dads\n\nHe said: \"It was written when she first arrived on the planet and I'd been a selfish popstar for most of my life and then all of a sudden I've been asked to take care of this whole person.\n\n\"I still am scared that I'm not up to the task! I'm doing a good job of being dad but it's scary, you have to look after this person for the whole of their life, I'm not very good at even looking after me!\"\n\nMillennium\n\nRobbie Williams - Millennium (Official Music Video)\n\nThis gave Robbie his first solo number one single in 1998, and was arguably Robbie at the peak of his 90s powers.\n\nIt heavily samples the arrangement of John Barry's 'You Only Live Twice', the title track of the 1967 James Bond film of the same name.\n\nRock DJ\n\nRobbie Williams - Rock DJ\n\nRobbie kickstarted the 2000s with one of the best pop bangers of all time, and one that pretty much allowed him the title of the UK's King of Pop.\n\nThe song is perhaps best known for its music video, which saw Robbie strip down to the point where he was just a skeleton. The full version was only allowed to be shown after 9pm.\n\nShe's the One\n\nRobbie Williams - She's The One\n\nBritish band World Party first released this song in 1997, a year before Robbie covered it and took it to number one in the UK.\n\nIt won him two BRIT Awards, including one for its ice skating-inspired music video.\n\nLet Me Entertain You\n\nRobbie Williams - Let Me Entertain You (Official Video)\n\nThe fifth and final single from Robbie's debut album, this song was written a certain homage to The Who, Kiss and The Rolling Stones.\n\nTo this day, it's his bombastic concert opener that makes you know you're in for a good time.\n\nBodies\n\nRobbie Williams - Bodies\n\nThis was Robbie's comeback single after three years away and a stint in rehab.\n\nThe song’s cryptic lyrics, with a wide variety of religious references included, have been subject to speculation. Williams later referred to the lyrics as “gibberish” that he considered pointless.\n\nLike the rest of the album, it was produced by Trevor Horn, and its music video featured his future wife, actress Ayda Field.\n\nSomething Beautiful\n\nRobbie Williams - Something Beautiful\n\nThis song was first offered to Tom Jones, but he turned it down. After Robbie chose to record it, he and Guy Chambers heavily reworked it.\n\nIts music video included a casting in which people from all over Europe contested to win the chance to perform as Robbie Williams at the end of the video.\n\nThe three winners had the chance to meet Robbie, and the public were asked to vote for the winner, with three different versions of the video getting released to various parts of the world including the different winners.\n\nLove My Life\n\nRobbie Williams | Love My Life (Official Video)\n\nA top 40 hit for Robbie in 2016, he said that it is \"about positivity and making the most of your life. I have a son called Charlton Valentine and a daughter called Theodora Rose Williams. I have been to rehab twice and had lots of therapy.\n\nRobbie Williams has emotional reunion with kids after three weeks away in self-isolation - video\n\n\"I realised that what happens to you when you become older is because of you when you were a kid. So this song is about hope and spreading positivity instead of negativity.\"\n\nSupreme\n\nRobbie Williams - Supreme\n\nThis song famously samples elements from Gloria Gaynor's iconic disco anthem 'I Will Survive'.\n\nIts music video sees Robbie as a 1970s race car driver, in a tribute to Jackie Stewart.\n\nKids (with Kylie Minogue)\n\nRobbie Williams, Kylie Minogue - Kids\n\nRobbie decided to turn this song into a duet, and was written when Kylie approached him to write her some songs for what would be her album Light Years.\n\nIt was then that Robbie noticed their chemistry and decided to include it on his album too.\n\nIt remains one of the greatest pop duets of all time, and is always a winner at karaoke, especially if you can remember Robbie's rap at the end.\n\nNo Regrets\n\nRobbie Williams - No Regrets\n\nThis song was written about Robbie's feelings about his time in (and departure from) Take That.\n\nAfter reconciling with the band years later, he replaced the final line ‘I guess the love we once had is officially dead’ with ‘officially alive!’.\n\nNeil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys and Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy provide backing vocals for the song.\n\nAngels\n\nRobbie Williams - Angels (Official Video)\n\nThis was the song that saved Robbie's career, after his first few songs that had lackluster chart runs.\n\nThe Story of... 'Angels' by Robbie Williams\n\nDespite only reaching number four, it is his best-selling single, shifting over a million copies after its release in 1997.\n\nIt's a soaring crowd-pleaser that will always get everyone around singing every word, and one that will cement Robbie as a pop legend."
