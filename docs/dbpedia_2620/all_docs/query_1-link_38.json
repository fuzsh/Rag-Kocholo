Red Chalk Hill is like a conflation of Bowie and Barrett songcraft.\n\n92 (56) THE BARONS Don’t Walk Out/Once In A Lifetime £1,500.00\n\n(1957, London HLP 8391)\n\nThe Barons issued five singles on Imperial between 1954 and 1956, but only the last was issued here.

To smooth the path these one-sided 7” demos were distributed containing edited versions of the vocal tracks.\n\n83 (139) THE KOOBAS THE KOOBAS £1,500.00\n\n(1969, Columbia SCX 6271)\n\nBy 1969 The Koobas had built psychedelia into their Merseybeat musical DNA. The LP hardly sold, making it a massive rarity.\n\n82 (110) LED ZEPPELIN LED ZEPPELIN £1,500.00\n\n(1969, Atlantic 588 171)\n\nThe price has jumped up since RRPG 2012. First pressing with turquoise sleeve, “Superhype Music/Jewel Music” credit and the matrix numbers 588171 A//1 and 588171B//1. If an “8” is crossed off, it’s a later pressing.\n\n81 (79) LED ZEPPELIN Whole Lotta Love (Edit)/Livin’ Lovin’ Maid (She’s A Woman) £1,500.00\n\n(1969, Atlantic 584 309)\n\nAtlantic tried to release this single on 5 November and demo copies were dispatched. Zep’s manager Peter Grant used his iron fist to ensure that the label respected his band’s wishes not to issue 45s in the UK. The release was aborted.\n\n80 (109) LEVIATHAN LEVIATHAN £1,500.00\n\n(1969, Elektra EKS 74046)\n\nThis band thought the release of their first LP on Elektra would establish their reputation, but label boss Jac Holzman cancelled the record’s release.

These TPs are McCartney holy relics.\n\n77 (69) PINK FLOYD Arnold Layne/ Candy And A Currant Bun £1,500.00\n\n(1967, Columbia DB 8156, pic sleeve)\n\nDemo copies of this first single came in a picture sleeve and bruised the Top 20. Sell-outs!\n\n76 (68) PINK FLOYD See Emily Play/Scarecrow £1,500.00\n\n(1967, Columbia DB 8214)\n\nThe train artwork for this promo picture sleeve was drawn by Syd Barrett, adding to its cachet.\n\n75 (67) PINK FLOYD Apples And Oranges/Paintbox £1,500.00\n\n(1967, Columbia DB 8319)\n\nLast Syd Floyd 45, November 1967: it flopped.

The Lodge shut when Linda Peters left to join Richard Thompson.\n\n69 (61) THE UGLYS I See The Light/Mary Cilento £ 1,500.00\n\n(1969, MGM 1465)\n\nThe Uglys cut five singles before ending up at MGM, where these tracks were pressed on a handful of demos before being ditched.\n\n68 (59) U2 I Will Follow/Boy Girl £1,500.00\n\n(1980, CBS 9065)\n\nU2 signed a worldwide deal with Island in March 1980, though the contract allowed CBS Ireland to release two Island singles. I Will Follow (WIP 6656) was issued in a number of formats with these 50 brown vinyl mis-pressings being particularly scant.\n\n67 (60) U2 THREE £1,500.00\n\n(1981, CBS 12-7951)\n\nU2’s debut EP — Out Of Control/Stories For Boys/Boy- Girl — was issued in Ireland in 1979, with colour vinyl variants in 1980. In 1981, it was reissued as a 12”, with this limited edition first pressing of 1,000 orange vinyl (with numbered stickers).\n\n66 (58) RUSTY YORK Peggy Sue/Shake ’Em Up Baby £1,500.00\n\n(1958, Parlophone R 4398)\n\nThis cover version of Buddy Holly’s Peggy Sue was only issued as a demo copy in the UK.\n\n65 (-) DAVIE JONES & THE KING BEES Liza Jane/ Louie Louie Go Home £ 1,600.00\n\n(1964, Vocalion Pop V 9221 demo)\n\nBowie’s manager Leslie Conn negotiated a one-off deal with this Decca subsidiary (and was named on the A-side as a songwriter). It flopped. Conn’s mother threw 200 copies out of her garage.\n\n64 (57) KATE BUSH Eat The Music/Big Stripey Lie £1,600.00\n\n(119 EMI EM 280)\n\nIntended as the first single from The Red Shoes, EMI went with Rubberband Girl instead, though some finished copies were pressed. EMI destroyed most of these.\n\n63 (55) TOBY TYLER The Road I’m On/Gloria £1,750.00\n\n(1964, acetate)\n\nThe future Marc Bolan cut this session in December 1964.\n\n62 (42) THE PENGUINS Earth Angel/Hey Senorita £1,750.00\n\n(1955, London HL 8114)\n\nThe US sheet music boasted: “Recorded on Dootone records by The Penguins — on Mercury records by the Crew Cuts — on Capitol records by Les Baxter — on MGM records by Pat O’Day — on Sound records by Gloria Mann.” The UK shrugged.\n\n61 (62) THE SMITHS Hand In Glove £1,800.00\n\n(1983, Rough Trade RT 131)\n\nHanded to Rough Trade’s Geoff Travis after the band’s first London gig at the Rock Garden, the label agreed to release it and these five TPs are the first time The Smiths were cut into vinyl.\n\n60 (-) A FLEETING GLANCE A FLEETING GLANCE £2,000.00\n\n(1970, private pressing)\n\nA wonderful psych confection, this LP has sold for over Â£2,500. Just added to the online guide.\n\n59 (84) THE BEATLES THE BEATLES £2,000.00\n\n(1968, Apple PMC/PCS 7067/8)\n\nWhile the price for numbers 1-10 of this edition can go for Â£7,000, numbers 11-1000 have this more conservative value. No 20 (mono) has gone for Â£2,900 in VG, No 56 (mono) for Â£2,250 in VG+ and No 483 (mono) for Â£2,627 in Excellent, while copy No 499 (mono) went for Â£839.\n\n58 (54) THE BEATLES YELLOW SUBMARINE £2,000.00\n\n(1969, Odeon PPCS 7070)\n\nThe rarest Beatles export album, with an Odeon label and Odeon sticker on the rear of the Apple sleeve. How many of these were removed by punters at the time, not thinking that they were devaluing their inheritance?\n\n57 (148) BLONDIE X Offender/In The Sun £2,000.00\n\n(1977, Private Stock PVT 90)\n\nThe price for this withdrawn Blondie 7” has doubled in two years. Originally “Sex Offender”, but softened by La Harry.\n\n56 (-) DAVID BOWIE The Prettiest Star/Conversation Piece (Irish pressing) £2,000.00\n\n(1970, Mercury EMF 1135)\n\nBowie expected this single — his first for Mercury — to chart, but coming eight months after his space novelty, it sold a mere 800 copies. This Irish pressing of the single is utterly, hideously rare.\n\n55 (52) THE BREAD AND BEER BAND THE BREAD AND BEER BAND £2,000.00\n\n(1969, Rubbish, no cat no)\n\nElton John (piano), Caleb Quaye (guitar), Bernie Calvert (bass), Roger Pope (drums), Lennox Jackson and Rolfo (percussion) play covers. Decca rejected it, so the band pressed up these test pressings in a handmade sleeve.\n\n54 (35) CAPTAIN MARRYAT CAPTAIN MARRYAT £2,000.00\n\n(1974, Thor 1007 S)\n\nJim Rorrison (drums/vocals), Hugh Finnegan (bass), Alan Bryce (organ) and Ian McEleny (guitar) played Scottish clubs and cut this LP. They split in 1975. A track like Blindness opens with a lovely organ fugue before oozing into backwater Floyd.\n\n53 (51) CHORDS Sh-Boom (Life Could Be A Dream)/ Little Maiden £2,000.00\n\n(1954, Columbia SCM 5133)\n\nAnother doo wop doo flop.\n\n52 (49) CROWS Gee/I Love You So £2,000.00\n\n(1954, Columbia SCM 5119)\n\nOne of the first rock’n’roll records, broken over the airwaves in America by DJ Dick ‘Huggy Boy’ Hugg. Did zilch in the UK.\n\n51 (125) DARK DARK ROUND THE EDGES £2,000.00\n\n(1972, SIS 0102)\n\nForty more common LPs in single monochrome sleeve (see entry #21).\n\n50 (46) FOREVER AMBER THE LOVE CYCLE £ 2,000.00\n\n(1969, Advance, Private Pressing)\n\nReflected the eight stages of a love affair from The Meeting via The Joy to The Grief. Music ranged from the organ-led Mary The Painter to the Zombies psych-patrol of Better Things Are Bound To Come. 99 pressed.\n\n49 (45) JIMI HENDRIX THE CRY OF LOVE £2,000.00\n\n(1971, Track 2408 101)\n\nA pressing plant experiment on red vinyl with three or four known copies. The same as the black vinyl pressing of Hendrix’s fourth (and first posthumous) album down to the matrix numbers — although the B-side label is from The Very Best Of Bert Kaempfert. Hmm.\n\n48 (44) LED ZEPPELIN Good Times Bad Times £2,000.00\n\n(1969, EMIdisc acetate)\n\nAtlantic sent out demo copies of Communication Breakdown/Good Times Bad Times (584 269, Â£700) in April 1969, but Peter Grant stopped the release. This one-sided acetate of the B-side has EMIdisc or LDC labels. Whole Lotta Love (Edit)/Whole Lotta Love (Edit) acetate (1969), is also Â£2,000.\n\n47 (43) JOHN LENNON Interview With John Lennon By Bob Mercer And Message To The Salesmen/Whatever Gets You Thru’ The Night £2,000.00\n\n(1974, EMI PSR 369)\n\n“Yeh, I’d like to say hi to all of you. If I was there I would come and see you. The message is, you know, if you like it sell it, if you don’t, try and sell it anyway cos we’re all in the same business,” Lennon tells the EMI sales force.\n\n46 (70) MELLOW CANDLE SWADDLING SONGS £2,000.00\n\n(1972, Deram SDL 7)\n\nUp Â£500 from its valuation in RRPG 2012, Silver Song and Sheep Season are two examples of compelling acid folk made mystical by the vocals of Clodagh Simonds and Alison Williams.\n\n45 (33) MORRISSEY November The Second £2,000.00\n\n(1990, HMV no cat no)\n\nEMI had this remixed for a 12”, but when Mozza heard it he demanded all copies be destroyed. This solitary copy survived.\n\n44 (40) THE ROLLING STONES THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST £2,000.00\n\n(LP, padded silk sleeve, 1967, Decca TXL/TXS 103)\n\nBack in 2012 I asked if anyone has seen one of these promotional padded sleeve editions. A dealer came forward with a copy of the album in what looked like a padded silk frame. If authentic, it would probably be one of the rarest Stones promos.\n\n43 (39) THE ROLLING STONES PROMOTIONAL ALBUM £ 2,000.00\n\n(1969 Decca RSM. 1)\n\nSent out prior to Let It Bleed to remind DJs in the UK and US of the Stones’ back catalogue, the second side on this version ends with a different mix of Love In Vain to the released cut. The album was also a hybrid, with US copies on the London label (catalogue number RSD 1) and the UK copies on RSM 1 (Decca label): 200 copies per territory.\n\n42 (38) THE SMITHS Hand In Glove/ Handsome Devil £2,000.00\n\n(1983, Rough Trade RT 131)\n\nLater pressing of debut 7”, with the sleeve accidently printed in blue/negative colours, making it hard to distinguish the naked man on the front.\n\n41 (36) RINGO STARR Steel £2,000.00\n\n(1972, ROR ROR 2001)\n\nStarr and designer Robin Cruickshank entered a business partnership to design and market steel and glass furniture. When Liberty’s held a one-week exhibition of Cruickshank’s furniture this one-sided interview with Starr was sold.\n\n40 (32) MARC BOLAN HARD ON LOVE £2,250.00\n\n(1972, Track 2406 009, acetate)\n\nSimon Napier-Bell planned to cash in on Bolan’s success by releasing early recordings to which he owned the rights. Bolan went to court to block the release, but Napier-Bell had already made test pressings (Â£800). The Bopping Elf won. It famously features Bolan telling someone, “Fuck off or keep cool, you know,” before launching into Jasper C Debussy.\n\n39 (78) THE BEATLES GOLDEN DISCS £2,500.00\n\n(1964, Parlophone GEP 8899)\n\nIn May 1964, EMI executives held a secret meeting cancelling the Golden Discs EP, rush releasing the Long Tall Sally EP (on 19 June). This cleared the way for a single and LP launch on 10 July, capitalising on the film A Hard Day’s Night. All that remains of Golden Discs is two test pressings (7TCE 1N & 7TCE 1N) and a sample set of labels. This price is for either test pressing or the labels — not both together.\n\n38 (31) THE BEATLES OUR FIRST FOUR £2,500.00\n\n(1968, Apple no cat no)\n\nThis press kit launched the first four Apple singles. The four 7”s by Jackie Lomax, Mary Hopkins, The Black Dyke Mills Band and The Beatles came in plastic sleeves with band bios and photos. This price is for rarer sets in matt plastic boxes rather than the more common card ones.\n\n37 (30) MARC BOLAN Ride A White Swan/ Summertime Blues/Jewel £ 2,500.00\n\n(1970, Octopus OCTO 1)\n\nRide A White Swan was to appear on Octopus, the new label being launched by Bolan’s music publisher David Platz (with Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp from Track). These test pressings have OCTO 1 in the run-out groove. When the label was launched in October 1970, its name was changed to Fly, so Ride A White Swan/Is It Love became BUG 1.\n\n36 (29) BOBBY CHARLES See You Later Alligator/On Bended Knee £2,500.00\n\n(1956, London HLU 8247)\n\nBill Haley had a monster hit with his version of Bobby Charles’ tune. The Chess original was called Later Alligator but changed to See You Later Alligator when London tried to cash in on Haley’s success in March 1956.\n\n35 (28) JACKIE LEE COCHRAN Ruby Pearl/Mama Don’t You Think I Know £2,500.00\n\n(1957, Brunswick 05669)\n\nCochran was 16 when he recorded this song about falling in love with a shop assistant. Time has not curbed its drive. In 2010 a copy took Â£2,000 on eBay.\n\n34 (48) MAC CURTIS The Low Road/You Ain’t Treatin’ Me Right £2,500.00\n\n(1957, Parlophone R 4279)\n\nA battered copy sold for Â£265 in 2005, testifying to just how few copies exist. The Low Road is an average ballad, but the souped-up flip could give you palpitations.\n\n33 (27) THE JAM Some Kinda Lovin’/Making My Way Back Home £2,500.00\n\n(1973, acetate)\n\nA young Paul Weller (bass/vocals) cutting his studio teeth with Dave Waller (guitar), Steve Brookes (guitar), Rick Buckler (drums). Six copies are known to exist.\n\n32 (26) LEAF HOUND GROWERS OF MUSHROOM £2,500.00\n\n(1971, Decca SKL-R 5094)\n\nLeaf Hound emerged from the ashes of Black Cat Bones with a line-up of Stuart Brooks (bass), Mick Halls (guitar), Keith Young (drums) and Peter French (vocals). This LP hardly sold and is now one of the top 70s rarities.\n\n31 (25) JOHN LENNON Woman Is Nigger The Of The World/Sisters O Sisters £2,500.00\n\n(1972, Apple R 5953)\n\nA single in America in April 1972, EMI cancelled a UK issue as it was thought the title would offend. These test pressings exist.\n\n30 (24) MADONNA Erotica (Album Version 5.12)/Erotica (Instrumental 5.12)/Erotica (Radio Edit 4.31) £2,500.00\n\n(1992, Maverick WO13 TP)\n\nThough Madonna can’t compete with Lady Gaga or Florence & The Machine when it comes to UK collectables, the 138 copies of this withdrawn 12” toe-sucking picture disc are sought by fans and foot fetishists.\n\n29 (23) BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN Sherry Darling/Independence Day £2,500.00\n\n(1981, CBS A 9568)\n\nA handful of copies in finished picture sleeves that credit Independence Day as the B-side. When officially released in February 1981, the B-side was changed to Be True. White label promos go for up to Â£2,000.\n\n28 (22) XTC Science Friction/ She’s So Square £2,500.00\n\n(1977, Virgin VS 188)\n\nVirgin decided to release this as a 12” in a special 3D sleeve rather than giving a 7” the same treatment. Only 50 finished sleeves in the smaller format are thought to have been made. This price is for a Mint 7” and sleeve.\n\n27 (12) THE BEATLES PLEASE PLEASE ME £2,800.00\n\n(1963, Parlophone PCS 3042)\n\nA transitional pressing between the black/gold and the yellow/ black label with “33â…“” on the label from the initial pressing.\n\n26 (53) THE BEATLES THE BEATLES £3,000.00\n\n(1968, Parlophone P-PCS 7067/8)\n\nEMI had to contract Beatles pressings out to other companies to meet demand. These “contract” pressings require real expertise to uncover. This Decca version of “The White Album” has no EMI stamper letters (D or G) in the run-out grooves and a circular impression about 15mm from the edge of the label. A copy sold for Â£7,100 in March in EX+/ EX+, though another copy drew a more prosaic Â£3,100 in 2010.\n\n25 (20) DAVID BOWIE Space Oddity/Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud £3,000.00\n\n(1969 Philips BF 1801)\n\nIn the wake of the film 2001 and the first landing on the moon, Philips thought that they had a hit on their hands. This item seems to suggest that there were plans to launch the record in an eye-catching picture sleeve, which was uncommon for UK singles at the time. It was subsequently issued in mono and went Top 5.\n\n24 (50) NEIL CHRISTIAN & THE CRUSADERS Restless/ Red Sails In The Sunset/Your Cheating Heart/Danny £3,000.00\n\n(1961, acetate)\n\nBelieved to feature Jimmy Page’s (aged 17) first recordings. There are only two known copies in circulation (of six cut).\n\n23 (76) DARK DARK AROUND THE EDGES £3,000.00\n\n(1972, SIS 0102)\n\nThis Northampton band, led by Steve Giles on guitar and vocals, found it hard to make headway performing original material. Giles took Dark into a studio in April 1970, but when they went back for five days in 1972 the line-up had changed to Giles, Ron Johnson (bass), Clive Thorneycroft (drums) and Martin Weaver (guitar). This second version of the record is limited to eight copies and comes in a black-and- white handmade gatefold sleeve, some containing a booklet.\n\n22 (19) RON HARGRAVE Latch On/Only A Daydream £3,000.00\n\n(1958, MGM 956)\n\nRon Hargrave’s sped-up version of country ditty Latch On is so fast it’s almost punk. US copies are cheap, but there are only a handful of UK pressings.\n\n21 (13) LED ZEPPELIN Immigrant Song £3,000.00\n\n(1970, acetate)\n\nZep boss Peter Grant flattened Atlantic UK’s attempts to sneak out 7” singles: this one-sided slate is evidence of thwarted plans.\n\n20 (18) JOHN LENNON/ PLASTIC ONO BAND You Know My Name Look Up The Number/What’s The New Mary Jane? £3,000.00\n\n(1969, Apple APPLES 1002)\n\nThe A-side was a Beatles track, but after completing his version on 26 November 1969, Lennon planned to issue it as a solo 7”. The other Beatles prevailed upon him and a Beatles version was coupled with Let It Be. The B-side to this acetate featured Lennon, Harrison and Ono “out of our heads on the floor at EMI” — shorthand for a wonderful psychedelic musical experiment.\n\n19 (17) JOHN LENNON PLASTIC ONO BAND UNFINISHED MUSIC NO 1: TWO VIRGINS £3,000.00\n\n(1968 Apple APCOR 2)\n\nIn the wake of the boldness that was “The White Album”, it was no surprise that McCartney and Lennon began to explore tape loops. John found a new muse in Yoko and this album emerged out of a crazed all-night session where she could wail “who’s theeeerree?” and Lennon could ape Peter Sellers and retort, “It’s just me, Hilda!” Lennon insisted on a release and EMI relented. They were especially reticent when Lennon submitted the naked photo he wanted to use for the cover. Most of these mono copies were destroyed when Lennon demanded that the record be remixed in stereo.\n\n18 (15) TINKERBELLS FAIRYDUST TINKERBELLS FAIRYDUST £3,000.00\n\n(1969 Decca LK/ SKL 5028)\n\nThis East End band cut their teeth on the pub circuit as The Rush, with two flop singles for Decca. Their working of Spanky And Our Gang’s Lazy Day tapped into the psychedelic vibe, so producer Vic Smith suggested a new name and it was released as by Tinkerbells Fairydust. Lazy Day and a follow-up did not hit, and album sessions were halted after eight songs. The band was dropped by Decca. Test pressings were made of a 13-track LP, as well as a small number of albums with labels in finished sleeves. There are four known copies of the finished LP with labels.\n\n17 (14) TOBY TYLER The Road I’m On (Gloria)/ Blowin’ In The Wind £3,000.00\n\n(1964, acetate)\n\nThe name “Marc Feld” is crossed out on the label of this acetate and “Toby Tyler” has been hand-written. Tyler became Marc Bolan and it’s fascinating to hear him covering this Dylan song on acoustic guitar and harmonica. Both tracks were recorded in December 1964 at Maximum Sound, along with The Perfumed Garden Of Gulliver Smith.\n\n16 (7) QUEEN Bohemian Rhapsody/I’m In Love With My Car £3,500.00\n\n(1978, EMI EMI 2375)\n\nPrice is for the hand-numbered blue vinyl single alone (see entry numbers 15 and eight).\n\n15 (7) QUEEN Bohemian Rhapsody/I’m In Love With My Car £3,800.00\n\n(1978, EMI EMI 2375)\n\nPrice is for a copy in a pic sleeve in an EMI “carrying envelope”.\n\n14 (16) BILLY NICHOLLS WOULD YOU BELIEVE £4,000.00\n\n(1968, Immediate IMCP 009)\n\nAndrew Loog Oldham’s label hit a financial iceberg and the only survivors were these 100 finished promo copies. The grooves were packed with psych-tinged pop, with guest appearances from The Small Faces, Nicky Hopkins and an orchestra. A copy sold on eBay for Â£7,312 in 2009 and a VG+ copy went for Â£3,212 in 2007.\n\n13 (47) DARK DARK ROUND THE EDGES £4,000.00\n\n(1972, SIS 0102)\n\nThis band gets another entry with a small private pressing of their album: 12 copies in colour sleeves and booklet inserts — super rare.\n\n12 (9) JOHN’S CHILDREN Midsummer Night’s Scene/ Sara Crazy Child £4,000.00\n\n(1967, Track 604005)\n\nAndy Ellison sang at a concert to mark the 35th anniversary of Marc Bolan’s death: Bolan was briefly in Ellison’s band, John’s Children. They’d released two singles by the time Simon Napier-Bell eased Bolan into the group as a songwriter, with Desdemona becoming their third failed single. The waft of Midsummer Night’s Scene was intended as the follow-up, but was withdrawn: stock copies impossible to find.\n\n11 (11) THE BEATLES PLEASE PLEASE ME £4,500.00\n\n(1963 Parlophone PCS 3042)\n\nIn previous guides we’ve given the same price for first and second stereo pressings of Please Please Me, but in this edition we give the first a slight edge over this second pressing with the right Northern Song publishing credits.\n\n10 (8) SEX PISTOLS Anarchy In The UK £5,000.00\n\n(1976, acetate)\n\nA one-sided acetate from 1976 featuring the three-minute, 36- second version of this punk classic cut during the band’s brief stay with EMI. Has sold for Â£12,000.\n\n9 (21) THE BEATLES Love Me Do/PS I Love You £5,000.00\n\n(1962, Parlophone 45-R 4949)\n\nDemo copies of the first Beatles single have soared from Â£3,000 to Â£5,000 from the last guide, cementing its position as the most sought-after single by the group. Only 250 copies were pressed in 1962 to secure airplay and reviews for Parlophone’s latest signing. Paul’s name was spelt “McArtney”. A copy sold for Â£12,000 in 2012.\n\n8 (7) QUEEN Bohemian Rhapsody/I’m In Love With My Car £5,000.00\n\n(1978 EMI 2375)\n\nAt a time when EMI has been flogged to Universal, it must be galling to look back to 1978 when the label won a Queen’s Award For Industry, celebrating in fine style at a dinner in Selfridges in London’s West End. This special limited blue-vinyl edition 7”of Queen’s best-known recording was limited to 200 copies and given away to guests, executives and, probably, the band. As well as the vinyl there was a goblet, handkerchief, menu cards, boxes of matches — even a pen. This price is for the lot.\n\n7 (11) THE BEATLES PLEASE PLEASE ME £5,000.00\n\n(1963, Parlophone PCS 3042)\n\nParlophone had used the black/ gold label for all album releases from 1957. The release of The Beatles’ debut coincided with a decision to redesign the label with a fresher yellow/black design from March 1963. By that time, the first two pressings of Please Please Me had been manufactured on black/gold labels. EMI only made a small pressing of each batch in stereo, and this first pressing has famed Dick James Music credits.\n\n6 (4) THE BEATLES THE BEATLES £7,000.00\n\n(1968, Apple PMC/PCS 7067/8)\n\nThis 2-LP set holds the distinction of topping the charts upon release and being the rarest LP in the UK. What makes it so collectable is the decision by sleeve designer Richard Hamilton — in conjunction with Paul McCartney — to brand each copy with a unique number, thus every edition of “The White Album” — mono or stereo — was limited. Beatles collectors’ lust for low numbers and, back in November 2009, a mono 0000005 sold for Â£19,201, sleeve in VG condition. At the other end of the scale an EX++ copy (with creases on the sleeve) of 0000023 took Â£3,990.\n\n5 (6) SEX PISTOLS Anarchy In The UK/No Fun £7,000.00\n\n(1977, acetate)\n\nAn irate rock’n’roll collector rang up to state that a Mint copy of Elvis Presley’s Blue Suede Shoes on gold/purple HMV was worth “10 times” more than any Pistols acetate. Not so. There are three known copies of this item.\n\n4 (3) SEX PISTOLS God Save The Queen/No Feelings £8,000.00\n\n(1977, A&M AMS 7284)\n\nThrown off EMI for deploying what the Daily Mirror deemed “the filthiest language heard on British television”, the Pistols were snapped up by A&M. Anti-social behaviour saw the band thrown off the label like a shot. Though 20,000 copies of God Save The Queen were pressed, most were destroyed, making it vitally collectable.\n\n3 (5) SEX PISTOLS God Save The Queen/No Feelings £10,000.00\n\n(1977, acetate)\n\nThese few acetates were deployed by the late Malcolm McLaren to secure the band a new deal and gigs after the EMI debacle. Priced at Â£6,000 in the RRPG 2012, they have increased in value by 60 per cent in the wake of one selling for Â£12,630.\n\n2 (2) THE QUARRY MEN That’ll Be The Day/In Spite Of All The Danger £10,000.00\n\n(1981, 7” 45rpm and 10” 78rpm replicas of 1958 acetate in reproduction die-cut Parlophone sleeve)\n\nIn 1981, John Duff Lowe sold Paul McCartney The Quarry Men acetate for an undisclosed sum. McCartney took the acetate to Abbey Road for restoration, removing pops and clicks before making a private pressing of 20 to 25 copies on 10”and 30 to 50 on 45rpm 7”. The labels reproduced the original with no mention of The Quarry Men. At Christmas, George, Ringo and others received copies. This version of In Spite Of All The Danger is just shy of 4 minutes, as opposed to the abridged version on Anthology. It has never materialised on eBay.\n\n1 (1) THE QUARRY MEN That’ll Be The Day/In Spite Of All The Danger £200,000.00\n\n(1958, acetate)\n\nOn 12 July 1958, a young Paul McCartney visited a recording studio for the first time with The Quarry Men. The five-piece — John Lennon, (guitar/vocals) George Harrison (guitar), John ‘Duff’ Lowe (piano), Colin Hanlon (drums) and Paul paid either 11 or 17 shillings and 6d. You can imagine the excitement and pride when they got home and gathered around a 78rpm record player to listen to their efforts. The acetate was passed around and when The Quarry Men split, ended up with John Duff Lowe. Â£200,000 and worth every penny, we estimate."
