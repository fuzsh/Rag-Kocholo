        "text": "Background\n\nAngels Landing is one of the most popular destinations in Zion National Park. Many who go there want to experience untamed adventure and get a classic photograph. Its' now famous name descends from Methodist minister Frederick Vining Fisher who, on his first visit to Zion Canyon in 1916 allegedly quipped only an angel could land there.\n\nThe hike is strenuous, and your safety is your responsibility. We have some tips to help reduce the risks you take and ensure you have an enjoyable hike.\n\nAngels Landing Pilot Permit Program\n\nEveryone who hikes Angels Landing needs to have a permit. The pilot permit program reflects lessons learned when we metered the number of hikers on the trail in 2019 and 2021 and by distributing tickets to use the park shuttle system in response to COVID-19 in 2020.\n\nNavigating near Angels Landing\n\nRangers may ask to see permits at any point along the trail at any time of day or night. The start time for your hike is at the Grotto. If you have a permit, do not forget to print or download your permit confirmation email before you start the hike. You may need to show this and identification to a ranger on the trail. If you need a larger version of this map, you can download it from the Angels Landing photo album.\n\nThis page has all the information you need to apply for a permit and plan your hike. If you have other questions about the scope of the program or how we researched it, read more about what you need to know.\n\nGetting and managing your permit\n\nGet, make limited changes to or cancel your permit.\n\nYou can apply for a permit before your trip.

Along this 5.4 mile round-trip hike, you will gain 1,488 feet in elevation.\n\nMost hikers take around 4 hours to complete the hike, but some take longer. Check the seasonal shuttle schedule before you leave to make sure you do not miss the last shuttle. Print or download your permit and carry a flashlight or headlamp with new batteries, some food and lots of water just in case you end up out later than you planned. The trail is well marked, but bring a park map in case you get disoriented.\n\nAlways carry and drink plenty of water, dress in layers, know the forecast, and check conditions in the park to get ready for your hike.\n\nBefore your hike\n\nPlan ahead and prepare to climb Angels Landing!\n\nYou need to print or download the confirmation email from recreation.gov that says you got a permit (this serves as your permit) before you get to the trailhead. A ranger may check your permit at the Grotto (Shuttle Stop 6), at Scout Lookout or along the trail. If you do not have your permit with you, we may not allow you to take your hike.\n\nBring broken-in boots with good ankle support and good traction. Some of the most common injuries Angels Landing hikers suffer are blisters and ankle injuries; good footwear is the best way to prevent these problems.\n\nEven if you have a permit, it may not be advisable for you to hike if the weather is bad when you are in Zion.\n\nIt is dangerous to be at Angels Landing during rain or thunder storms. Check the weather forecast before your hike, and try to plan to avoid bad weather. Thunder storms can happen any time, but they happen more often in the afternoon.\n\nIf you are on the trail and see storm clouds coming, stop. Do not keep climbing. If possible, leave the area and begin your descent. Use caution at all times if you are on the part of the trail with chains.\n\nFor most of the year, you can only get to the start of the trail by riding a shuttle bus. The park shuttle route begins at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. Park your vehicle at the visitor center or in Springdale and use the shuttles to enter Zion Canyon. Most hikers start from Shuttle Stop 6, the Grotto.\n\nDuring the few weeks in the winter and spring when the shuttle is not running, you will drive yourself to the trailhead. Please park on the pavement. If parking is full, you will need to park farther away and walk back to the trail.\n\nAt the trailhead\n\nMost hikers choose to start from Shuttle Stop 6, the Grotto. The time printed on your permit is when you need to be at the Grotto. Leave time to get to the Grotto before the start time printed on your permit.\n\nA ranger may check your permit before you start on the trail.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to ensure a safe, enjoyable hike is to be sure to have plenty of water. Weather conditions and personal preference affect the amount of water you need, but we suggest every person in Zion drink 1 gallon (4 liters) per day. Angels Landing usually takes at least a half day to hike.\n\nYou can fill your water bottles at the Grotto shuttle stop, but you will not find drinkable water anywhere else on the trail. Please fill your water bottles at the start of the hike.\n\nWe suggest that you go to the bathroom before you start the hike. You can use a flush toilets at the Visitor Center before you get on the park shuttle or at the Grotto shuttle stop.\n\nIf you have to go after you are on the trail, you need to put solid human waste and toilet paper in a plastic bag and carry it back with you. Bring a bag and toilet paper with you in case you need it later.\n\nIf you leave human waste on the trail, we may give you a citation, and you may have to pay a fine.\n\nIt is important to leave this place the way you found it. This way, future generations will be able to enjoy the park unimpaired. Never leave anything behind and try to be considerate of others. Specifically:\n\nProtect the canyon walls, rocks, and trees from graffiti and vandalism.\n\nLeave rocks as you find them and do not stack rock cairns.\n\nProtect the natural sounds of the canyon by talking softly and using headphones for music.\n\nFor more information, take the Zion Pledge.\n\nOn the trail\n\nThe hike along the West Rim Trail to Angels Landing is strenuous. Your safety on the trail is your responsibility, and we want to share some tips so that you reduce the risks and have an enjoyable hike.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to ensure a safe, enjoyable hike is to be sure to have plenty of water. Weather conditions and personal preference affect the amount of water you need, but we suggest every person in Zion drink 1 gallon (4 liters) per day. Angels Landing usually takes at least a half day to hike.\n\nYou do not need a permit to go to Scout Lookout.\n\nYou do need a permit to go past Scout Lookout on to the part of the trail with Chains.\n\nFor many people, Scout Lookout is a reasonable stopping point. You will have to hike the West Rim Trail from Zion Canyon to this viewpoint. and you will covering most of the distance and elevation gain for the hike.\n\nIf you or someone in your group has a fear of heights, consider splitting up here and regrouping at a specified time and place. It can be a great option to head up the West Rim Trail to get views overlooking Angels Landing and Zion Canyon. You do not need a permit to hike on the West Rim Trail.\n\nEven if you have a permit, it may not be advisable for you to hike if the weather is bad when you are in Zion.\n\nDo not attempt to ascend if:\n\nStorm clouds are in the area.\n\nThe ground is wet or icy (the rock becomes very slick when wet; most accidents on the chains occur during wet conditions).\n\nIt is dark or will be dark before you finish.\n\nYou have any fear of heights.\n\nWatch for rockfall\n\nRockfall hazards occur throughout the park and are especially high near any cliff face. If you witness a rockfall, quickly move away from the cliff.\n\nIf you are near the base of a cliff or talus (loose rock) slope when a rockfall happens and cannot quickly move away from the base of the cliff, immediately seek shelter behind the largest nearby boulder and pull your backpack over your head. After rocks have stopped falling, move quickly as far away from the base of the cliff as possible.\n\nBe aware that rockfalls can occur at any time. Pay attention to your surroundings, stay off of closed trails, and, if unsure, keep away from cliffs.\n\nYou need to have a permit to hike the Angels Landing chains.\n\nThe most famous--or infamous--part of the hike is the ascent up the chains. The single metal chain offers hikers something to hold during the last half mile of trail along a knife-edge ridge. Since 1930, the majority of deadly accidents have taken place on this section of trail.\n\nDo not leave the path. It is easy to get hurt if you are irresponsible.\n\nTake your time and be patient with slower hikers.\n\nAllow faster hikers to pass you (when possible).\n\nWhere available, remain within reach of the chains.\n\nBe considerate. There are many places that are only safe for one person to travel the two-way route. Communicate and take turns with others.\n\nIn winter, the metal chains are very cold. Gloves may be useful.\n\nKeep wildlife wild: respect them from a distance. Squirrels, ravens, chipmunks, and other animals live along the trail; never feed them or allow them to get your food. Do not leave your pack unattended (e.g., at the base of the chains or while you take a nap).\n\nCalifornia condors are the largest bird in North America and you might see one near Angels Landing. Please respect these critically endangered birds by keeping your distance. Never feed or approach a condor.\n\nPack it in, pack it out\n\nThere are no trash cans on the trail. While hiking in Zion, be sure to pack out all trash.\n\nDon't let your belongings become trash. Secure them so that they do not fall. Water bottles falling from backpack side pockets and hats blowing off heads are common lost belongings that can accidentally litter in the park.\n\nWhen possible, you can help park rangers by picking up trash on the trail. Put trash in a can by the trailhead.\n\nDon't Roll Rocks\n\nIn Zion, you will commonly be above other people and wildlife. Do not throw anything over the edge of the trail. Angels Landing is a nesting area for many birds and rock climbers are often below. A falling rock could injure or kill.\n\nLogistics and other information\n\nEmergencies\n\nEven if you plan well and bring the right equipment, you might still have problems. If you need help, try to call 911. If you have cell and/or data service, a call will connect you with the Zion Dispatch Office.\n\nIf you do not have cell and/or data service (most people cannot connect to a mobile network in Zion Canyon), find a park ranger or park volunteer on the trail or at a trailhead.\n\nMore Information\n\nLearn more about why we issue permits to hike at Angels Landing and about Zion's Visitor Use Research and Planning.\n\nIf you have a Commercial Use Authorization to guide hikes in the park, please contact the Zion Commercial Services to discuss options.
