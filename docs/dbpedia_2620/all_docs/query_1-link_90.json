        "text": "Just recently on this forum I responded to a thread - which one, I can't remember - that I hoped one day there would be a compilation of Keith Relf's various projects from his early days in the Yardbirds until his last band, Armageddon. It's something I've wished for for a long time... apparently, my wish will be granted; in part at least. Repertoire Records just posted this on Facebook:\n\nComing soon on CD & Deluxe Vinyl ⏺️ Keith Relf - \"All the Falling Angels - Solo Recordings & Collaborations 1965-1976\". A carefully selected collection of Keith’s work as a solo artist and incollaboration with fellow Yardbird Jim McCarty and his sister Jane Relf. It includes previously\n\nunreleased demos from Keith’s personal tape archive, along with rare tracks by Together, the duo he formed with McCarty in 1968, his hard to find 1966 solo singles, and more. #theyardbirds #repertoirerecords #legacymusic\n\nAnd they're not even particularly interesting... so many more items - either released yet obscure or unreleased demos that I'd rather have all compiled in one place...\n\nFound the tracklist:\n\n1. Knowing [1965 solo B-side]\n\n2. Mr. Zero [1965 solo A-side]\n\n3. All The Pretty Little Horses [1965 BBC session]\n\n4. Only The Black Rose [home demo]\n\n5. Glimpses [home demo]\n\n6. Shapes In My Mind [1966 solo A-side, UK edit]\n\n7. Echoes I May Find\n\n8. Shining Where The Sun Has Been [Relf/McCarty demo, 1968]\n\n9. Henry's Coming Home [1968 Together A-side]\n\n10. Love Mum And Dad [1968 Together B-side]\n\n11. Together Now\n\n12. Line Of Least Resistance\n\n13. Try Believing\n\n14. High Mountain Theme [demo]\n\n15. End And Out [from 1970 \"Schizom\" soundtrack?]\n\n16. Just Think What You're Achieving\n\n17. Collector Of The Light [1970s demo with Louis Cennamo]\n\n18. I'd Love To Love You Till Tomorrow [Keith and Jane Relf, 1976]\n\n19. High Mountain Theme [from 1970 \"Schizom\" soundtrack?]\n\n20. All The Falling Angels [1976]\n\n21. Cherokee\n\n22. Voice Echo\n\n23. The Roundalay\n\n24. Sunbury Electronics Sequence\n\nAlways loved this song. Amazing Keith is singing it in a much higher register, but it's still very interesting. I'm looking forward to this set! Thanks, Yardbyrd!\n\nNot sure when this is from, but imagine a Page produced Yardbirds LP where they're going the acoustic folk route full fledge... ironically, McCarty in a recent interview I did with him in late 2017 said he and Keith were so intent on getting out of the Yardbirds that they really had no idea Jimmy was an acoustic folk fan... their motivation to leave the band in '68 was to do acoustic folk material...\n\nThanks. Looks like I can't get it here in the US, though, at least not for the time being.\n\nI was excited about news of his biography.. but then seen page count...\n\nKeith deserves far more recognition than he garners especially in the context of the Yardbirds, where the lead guitarists overshadow all the other members..."
