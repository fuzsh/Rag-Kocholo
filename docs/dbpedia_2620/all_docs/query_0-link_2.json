        "text": "2001 compilation album by LeAnn Rimes\n\nI Need YouCompilation album by ReleasedJanuary 30, 2001 (original)\n\nMarch 26, 2002 (re-release)Recorded1999â€“2002Studio\n\nSARM West Coast, The Town House (London, England)\n\nRoyal Tone, The Village Recorders (Los Angeles, California)\n\nEast Iris (Nashville, Tennessee)\n\nGenre\n\nAdult contemporary\n\npop\n\ncountry pop\n\nLength39:07LabelCurbProducerLeAnn Rimes chronologySingles from I Need You\n\nReleased: February 9, 2001\n\nReleased: March 19, 2001 (international)\n\nReleased: August 2001\n\nI Need You is the third compilation album from American recording artist LeAnn Rimes. The album was first released on January 30, 2001, through Curb Records to help satisfy Rimes's recording contract obligations following her issuance of a lawsuit against the label. The original release of the album consists of four previously released soundtrack appearances alongside six new tracks. Rimes publicly disowned the album just days after its release, but despite her comments, Curb continued to promote the record and released three singles in support of the album. The album was re-released on March 26, 2002, with four additional remixes and the new recording \"Light the Fire Within\".\n\nI Need You received positive to mixed reviews from music critics, who noted Rimes's gradual move away from country and towards pop-leaning adult contemporary music. In the United States, the album peaked at number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and reached number ten on the Billboard 200. Internationally, it peaked at number four on the Finnish Albums Chart, number ten on the Canadian Albums Chart, and number eleven on both the Austrian Albums Chart and the Irish Album Chart. The album was certified Platinum in the United States and Canada and was certified Gold in four further countries.\n\nThe album contains the hit singles \"Written in the Stars\", \"I Need You\", and \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\", which were released as singles from soundtracks prior to the album's release. Following the release of I Need You, Curb Records released \"But I Do Love You\" and \"Soon\" as singles; both songs were also featured on soundtracks. Internationally, \"I Need You\" served as the second single from the album.\n\nBackground and development\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 2000, Rimes sued Curb Records in an effort to have her recording contract with the label nullified; it had originally been signed on her behalf by her parents in 1995.[1] Subsequently, I Need You was released to help satisfy Rimes's recording contract obligations with the label.[2] During litigation with the label, Rimes asked \"that Curb give Rimes the rights to all past recordings and videos, give up all publishing interests in her compositions and destroy all currently available recordings.\"[3] Rimes claimed that she was unaware of album's planned release until a month prior to it being issued.[4] According to her management, the new songs on the album stemmed from as early as 1999 and were finished without her input.[5]\n\nThe album was publicly disowned by Rimes two days after its 2001 release, with Rimes stating that: \"This album was made without my creative input. It consists largely of unfinished material and songs that didn't make other albums [...] I want to make abundantly clear to you that this album is not a reflection of myself as an artist but is solely the conception of Curb Records, and for that I am truly and deeply sorry.\"[4][6] Rimes's father (Wilbur Rimes), with whom the singer was also in dispute with, had production credits on 8 of the 10 songs on the album; he issued a statement that said \"I believe this is one of the best albums LeAnn has ever recorded. The songs she chose for this album demonstrate her newfound maturity and the continuing development of her tremendous talent. These were all finished masters, and LeAnn loved the way it all came together when it was complete\".[7][8] Curb Records released a statement that said \"We believe that I Need You is the best album that [Rimes] has ever recorded. Nevertheless, we are excited about the new musical directions that LeAnn is exploring for the future, and, as always, we respect her talent and her opinions.\"[7] Curb Records continued to promote the album despite Rimes's comments.[9][10] In November 2001, Rimes was released from her original contract with Curb Records and subsequently signed a new agreement with the label under new terms.[11]\n\nFour songs on the album were previously released.[12] The duet with Elton John, \"Written in the Stars\", was released as a single on February 23, 1999 from the concept album, Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida.[13][14] The album contains the \"alternate version\" of the song, previously included as the second track on the single. \"I Need You\" was included on the Jesus: Music From and Inspired by the Epic Mini Series soundtrack released on March 8, 2000.[15] It was released as a single on July 18, 2000 for the soundtrack.[16] \"But I Do Love You\" and \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\" were included on the soundtrack for Coyote Ugly on August 1, 2000.[17] \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\" was released as a single for the soundtrack on August 22, 2000, with \"But I Do Love You\" as its b-side.[18] The version of \"But I Do Love You\" that appears on the initial release of I Need You is a new remix which was also sent to country radio stations.[19] The cover photograph on I Need You was previously used in the Coyote Ugly soundtrack liner notes and as the single art for \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\".\n\nRelease and promotion\n\n[edit]\n\nThe album was first released on January 30, 2001, by Curb Records.[20] Three singles were released from the album. After having previously been the b-side to \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\", \"But I Do Love You\" was released as a single from both the Coyote Ugly soundtrack and I Need You on February 11, 2002.[21][22] Though \"I Need You\" was initially released in the United States as a single from the Jesus soundtrack on July 18, 2000, it was subsequently released internationally as a single from I Need You on March 19, 2001.[16][23][24] \"Soon\" was released in August 2001 as the album's final single in the United States.[25][26] The song, written by Diane Warren, was also featured on the soundtrack for Driven, released on April 27, 2001.[27] It peaked at fourteen on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart.[28] \"You Are\" was released as a promotional single in 2001 and was featured on the soundtrack for Angel Eyes.[29][30]\n\nThe album was reissued on March 26, 2002.[31] It contains all ten tracks from the 2001 release plus four bonus remixes and \"Light the Fire Within\", which Rimes performed at the 2002 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Salt Lake City.[31][32] \"But I Do Love You\" is in an alternate mix on the original release of I Need You, but was included in its original Coyote Ugly soundtrack version on the reissue.[19][31] The version of \"You\" on the reissue is an extended version.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAbout.com[36]AllMusic[33]Entertainment WeeklyC+[34]Rolling Stone[35]\n\nI Need You received generally positive to mixed reviews from music critics. Mark Huxley at Barnes & Noble gave a positive review of the album, saying that Rimes is \"comfortably adopting some distinctly modern sonic elements without sacrificing her tradition-steeped country roots.\"[37] The Philippine Star felt that despite being \"culled from assorted sources\" the album \"comes across as the best crafted of all the albums that LeAnn has recorded\".[38] Chris Neal from Country Weekly praised the album and Rimes's vocal performance, saying that \"all the songs are solid\". However, he also noted that \"most of the songs have only a tenuous connection to country\" and said \"how you feel about I Need You will largely depend on whether you see LeAnnâ€™s shift toward pop as a positive development.\"[12]\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave a mixed review, calling it \"her first full-fledged pop album\" with \"footing squarely within adult contemporary pop\". He stated that Rimes's \"impressive voice sounds restrained in this setting, too self-consciously mature. In a nutshell, that's the problem with I Need You - it's a teenager attempting to make a thirtysomething album. That she occasionally succeeds is a testament to her vocal talents and the skills of her producers, but it shouldn't be surprising that it also feels awkward for large stretches, never quite becoming as alluring as Breathe, because this is a sound that she needs to grow into to be totally convincing.\"[33] Arion Berger from Rolling Stone gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars and called the album \"synthetic-feeling.\" He praised Rimes's vocal performance and described the album as being closer to adult contemporary than country.[35] Trisha Huenke of About.com gave the album four out of five stars and praised it for its pop sound, stating that, \"Finally we have an artist who is straightforward about the fact that she wants to sing pop music.\"[36] Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed review of the album. She criticized \"Written in the Stars\", calling it a \"slugfest duet\". She praised the inclusion of \"But I Do Love You\" and \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\" but said \"you'll snooze through the rest.\"[34]\n\nCommercial performance\n\n[edit]\n\nI Need You debuted and peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200, with 84,915 copies sold in its first week.[39] It spent four weeks in the top fifty and a total of thirty weeks in Billboard 200.[40] It also debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.[41]\n\nInternationally, the album was a success, peaking at number four on the Finnish Albums Chart, number ten on the Canadian Albums Chart, and at number eleven on both the Austrian Albums Chart and the Irish Album Charts.[42][43][44] The album also peaked at number five on the Swedish Albums Chart and number six on the Swiss Albums Chart.[42] It peaked at number seven on both the UK Albums Chart and the European Top 100 Albums chart.[45][46]\n\nOn the year-end charts, I Need You peaked at number five in Finland and at thirteen on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.[47][48] The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA and Music Canada.[49][50] The album was certified Gold by IFPI Denmark, the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry and the British Phonographic Industry.[51]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n^a signifies a remixer\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits for I Need You were adapted from liner notes.[56] Additional credits adapted from liner notes of the Coyote Ugly soundtrack,[57] the Jesus: Music From and Inspired by the Epic-Mini Series soundtrack,[58] and the Aida concept album.[59]\n\nAlmighty Associates â€“ producer, remixer\n\nEddie Bayers â€“ drums\n\nCurt Bisquera â€“ drums\n\nMike Brignardello â€“ bass guitar\n\nCharlie Brocco â€“ assistant engineer on \"Written in the Stars\"\n\nDavid Campbell â€“ orchestral arrangement\n\nSue Ann Carwell â€“ background vocals\n\nThe Choristers of Cathedral of the Madeleine Choir School â€“ background vocals on \"Light the Fire Within\"\n\nPeter Collins â€“ producer\n\nMike Curb â€“ producer\n\nAustin Deptula â€“ assistant engineer, additional engineer, engineer, keyboards\n\nDavid Foster â€“ arrangement, producer\n\nMicheal \"Grimey\" Grimes â€“ drums\n\nOmar Hakeem â€“ drums, percussion\n\nMike Hanna â€“ additional arrangement\n\nNiki Harris â€“ background vocals\n\nCarl Herrgesell â€“ harmonium, Wurlitzer\n\nJohn Holbrook â€“ mixer, engineer, recording\n\nTrevor Horn â€“ producer\n\nChuck Howard â€“ producer\n\nGreg Hunt â€“ chief engineer, additional engineer\n\nAndrew Pryce Jackman â€“ orchestral arrangement\n\nElton John* â€“ musical director, vocals on \"Written in the Stars\"\n\nAnnagray Labasse â€“ background vocals\n\nGary Leach â€“ assistant engineer, additional engineer, engineer, keyboards\n\nKeith Lockhart â€“ music director for Utah Symphony\n\nSteve MacCillan â€“ mixer, engineer\n\nEdgar Meyer â€“ acoustic bass\n\nKenny Mims â€“ acoustic guitar electric guitar\n\nJamie Muhoberac â€“ bass guitar, keyboards\n\nTim Pierce â€“ electric guitar\n\nLeAnn Rimes â€“ lead vocals, co-producer, background vocals\n\nWilbur C.
