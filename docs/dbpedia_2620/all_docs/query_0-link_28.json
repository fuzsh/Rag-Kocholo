        "text": "Estimated reading time is 31 minutes.\n\nWHO ARE THOSE GUYS? “Davie Allan & The Arrows recorded the most frenzied instrumentals the world has ever heard! Allan’s fuzzed-out guitar was an audio compass pointing towards freedom, sex, danger and violence, his trashy fretboard riffs exploding behind flickering celluloid images of cycle runs, biker fights, drug freakouts and rubber-burnin’ hot rods.” 1\n\nThe paragraph quoted above is from Sundazed Records’ promotional campaign to promote DEVIL’S RUMBLE, a compilation intended “to restore Davie Allan to his rightful place atop the ranks of fabled guitar gunslingers.” And how can I top that? I can’t so I will just stick to what this article is all about! 2\n\nIn this article, you will find the most complete discography of the recordings of Davie Allan ever assembled. These include his work as a sideman, as a solo artist, and as leader of his own group, the Arrows. This article is also a reasonably accurate price guide to those records.\n\nThis discography includes at least one image for each record released under with Davie as a sideman during the formative years of 1963-1964, each record released by Davie Allan or the Arrows during the heyday years of 1965-1969, and anything I considered interesting.\n\nThis article was originally published in 2015 and has been revised and reorganized. All of the values assigned to the records below have been updated to reflect the marketplace of 2020.\n\nThe classic Arrows line-up of the mid-’60s included Davie Allan (lead guitar), Russ Viot (rhythm guitar), Drew Bennett (bass), and Larry Brown (drums). Records can be found crediting “The Arrows,” “The Arrows Featuring Davie Allan,” “Davie Allan & The Arrows,” and just plain “Davie Allan.”\n\nThe basic discography below was provided by The Seth Man. Every record listed is believed to include Davie on guitar; those tracks that we are certain of Allan’s contribution are followed by an asterisk (*). 3\n\nDavie Allan & the Arrows’ big hit was Blue’s Theme, which opened the movie Wild Angels and was the theme for the film’s protagonist, a biker named Blues (Peter Fonda). With this movie, both Fonda and Allan became associated with Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In fact, the sound of a surf riff on a fuzzed guitar brings bikes to mind to those of us who spent a lot of time at Saturday matinees and weekend drive-in movies during the ’60s.\n\nScarcity Index and assigned values\n\nFrank Daniels has been contributing to my efforts here and on my Elvis – A Touch Of Gold site for a while, but he has been collecting common and rare records for a long time. Several years ago, he developed a Scarcity Index that addresses a record’s rarity—the real or perceived availability of the item on the open market—rather than its value.\n\nWhile it is an effort to do the research (and Frank did it all), I wanted to use it here as the prices paid for most of Davie’s records do not reflect the difficulty in finding those records.\n\nDavie Allan’s fuzzed-out guitar was an audio compass pointing towards freedom, sex, danger, and violence!\n\nValues reflect what an established dealer would ask for that item in near mint (NM) condition. They are based on listings for recent sales in such sites as Popsike and Discogs combined with input from a handful of friends and thirty years of experience buying and selling records.\n\nThe values assigned are for near-mint records with near-mint labels. Most of the copies of these records that are sold on the internet do not appear to be near mint, so the values below will seem rather high. Most of the records listed below can be purchased for a helluva lot less than the near mint value—some can be bought for a couple of bucks—if you will settle for less than near mint condition.\n\nFor more, refer to “On Grading Records.”\n\nDuring the Vinyl Era, many record companies issued their 45s in generic sleeves that identified the record company but not the specific record in the sleeve. These are referred to as company sleeves. These sleeves worked best when they contrasted with the color of the record labels. For the examples above, the black Tower sleeve makes the orange label of the Tower record stand out while the red Mercury label is lost in the red Mercury sleeve,\n\nOdds and ends\n\nRegarding the many guises under which Davie Allan and the Arrows’ recordings can be found in the ’60s—especially on the movie soundtrack albums on Tower and Sidewalk—Davie had this to say: “In those days, record companies wanted to have names they could continue to use if the record was a hit. Our band didn’t want to get locked into any one record company, so we let any company we worked with name us whatever they wanted to name us.”\n\nDavie Allan & the Arrows’ riffs exploded behind flickering celluloid images of cycle runs, biker fights, drug freakouts, and rubber-burnin’ hot rods!\n\nRegarding the images of record labels below: the images may be an accurate reproduction of the actual labels or they may approximate the color. This is especially true for Tower labels: the extreme variation in the brownish-orange label—from very light orange to a rather deep brown—is mostly due to the photographing process and the manner of reproducing those photos and transferring them to the Internet. The label tonality does vary somewhat, but not to the degree shown below.\n\nMost records below were issued in a company sleeve or in a plain paper sleeve. Notice that the label on the illustration above for the Devil’s Angels single is a deep, rich orange. Not all of the images below are the same orange, but most of the actual records look pretty much alike.\n\n1963\n\nThis is probably Davie Allan’s first appearance on a record and as such every Davie Allan collector in the world should be going wild in the streets trying to score a copy!\n\nHEYBURNERS Titanic 5009 Speedway* / Bird Walk*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $100-150.• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nApparently, the Heyburners featured Mike Curb (keyboards), Davie Allan (guitar), and Larry Brown (drums) along with additional (and long-forgotten) side musicians. Mike Curb’s website has Titanic 5009 as released in 1962, but it was first listed in the May 25, 1963, issue of Billboard in their Other Singles Reviewed section, which listed singles with relatively limited sales or programming potential. Refer to the Curbstones, the Grads, the Ja Detts, the Streamers, the Sudells, and the Zanies.\n\nThis was the first single released under Allan’s name and as such, every Davie Allan collector in the world should be going wild in the streets trying to score a copy!\n\nDAVIE ALLAN\n\nCude 101 War Path / Beyond The Blue\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $40-60.\n\nMike Curb founded Cude Records in 1963 and the first record was issued later in the year. The record went nowhere and was leased to Marc Records, who reissued it in 1964 (listed below).\n\nThis was Mike Curb’s first record under his own name and featured his own vocals.\n\nMIKE CURB & THE CURBSTONES Reprise 0287 Velocita* / Hot Dawg*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $15-20.• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\nApparently, this group featured Mike Curb (keyboards), Davie Allan (guitar), and Larry Brown (drums) along with additional (and long-forgotten) side musicians. Refer to the Grads, the Heyburners, the Ja Detts, the Streamers, the Sudells, and the Zanies.\n\nJA DETTS\n\nDeltone 5022 Look To The Stars* / Father Knows Best*\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\nApparently, the Ja Detts featured Mike Curb (keyboards), Davie Allan (guitar), and Larry Brown (drums) along with additional (and long-forgotten) side musicians backing a girl group later known as the Starlets (below). Refer to the Curbstones, the Grads, the Heyburners, the Streamers, the Sudells, and the Zanies.\n\nSHARLETS\n\nExplosive ZGM-1 Gleam In His Eyes / Freddie\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $40-50.\n\n1964\n\nZANIES Dore 705 Camel Walk* / Slinky*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\nApparently, the Zanies featured Mike Curb (keyboards), Davie Allan (guitar), and Larry Brown (drums) along with additional (and long-forgotten) side musicians. Refer to the Curbstones, the Grads, the Heyburners, the Ja Detts, the Streamers, and the Sudells.\n\nSTREAMERS Dot 16648 Slip-Stream* / Blue Mountain*\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\nApparently, the Streamers featured Mike Curb (keyboards), Davie Allan (guitar), and Larry Brown (drums) along with additional (and long-forgotten) side musicians. Refer to the Curbstones, the Grads, the Heyburners, the Ja Detts, the Sudells, and the Zanies.\n\nDAVIE ALLAN\n\nMarc 107 War Path / Beyond The Blue\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $60-80.\n\nMarc Records, who had a modest hit with Bob & Earl’s Harlem Shuffle in early 1964, picked up Davie Allan’s record on Cude (above) and reissued it in mid-’64.\n\nGRADS Mercury 72346 The Wild One* / The Cool One*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\nWhile The Wild One is a Gary Usher project, apparently The Cool One is a reissue of Davie Allan’s Beyond The Blue on Cude (above). Refer to the Curbstones, the Heyburners, the Ja Detts, the Streamers, the Sudells, and the Zanies.\n\nPARIS SISTERS MGM 13236 Dream Lover* / Lonely Girl\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 2 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Picture sleeve: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\nARROWS FEATURING DAVIE ALLAN\n\nSidewalk 1 Apache ’65 / Blue Guitar\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\n“We actually recorded Apache ‘65 late in 1964. It didn’t sell everywhere, but I remember we went to Phoenix and it was so funny—we’d get off the plane and there’d be a limousine waiting for us. We were actually stars in Phoenix! In Los Angeles, I think #34 was the highest it went. I always loved [the original Apache by Jorgen Ingmann from 1961] and wanted to re-do it, and in re-doing it, we tried to think of an Indian name. The first name we were going to use was the Warriors. I didn’t like that, so I came up with the Arrows.” (Davie Allan)\n\nMIKE CURB & THE REBELAIRS Smash 1938 The Rebel (Without A Cause)* / Carole’s Rebel*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nThe Rebel (Without A Cause) featured Mike Curb as the lead singer with instrumental and vocal backing supposedly by the Hondells under the direction of Beach Boys producer Nick Venet. This was recorded around the same time as the Hondells’ version, but their’s was a Davie Allan-inspired surf instrumental.\n\nSTARLETS\n\nTower 115 You Won’t Even Know Her Name* / Multiply By Three\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $20-25.\n\nThis was Davie Allan’s first appearance on Tower. His affiliation with this company and its affiliate Sidewalk Records should have (but probably won’t) cement his place in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The Starlets were a girl group who had recorded earlier as the Ja Detts (above).\n\n1965\n\n“The Sudells single is probably as rare as anything on the American Arts label. Commercial copies are ridiculously rare. I have seen three different promo labels, but they are just factory variations.” – Frank Daniels\n\nSUDELLS American Arts 12 Suzuki* / Pow Wow*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $50-100.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nApparently, the Sudells featured Mike Curb (keyboards), Davie Allan (guitar), and Larry Brown (drums) along with additional (and long-forgotten) side musicians. Refer to the Curbstones, the Grads, the Heyburners, the Ja Detts, the Streamers, and the Zanies.\n\nKEN & CAROL\n\nMarmike 101 Make Up Your Mind / Gleam In Her Eye\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $50-100.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\n“The Marmike label was owned by famous ’60s producer and writer of hundreds of records and songs, Mike Curb. Both sides of the record were written, produced, and arranged by Curb, who also owned the music publishing company, Marmike Music. We know all about the actual record, but nothing about Ken and Carol!\n\nWhat were their full names? Where did they come from? What happened to them after this one release? Columbia Records obviously heard the record and liked it, since they bought it from Curb and issued it in 1965.\n\nMake Up Your Mind was listed on both this and the Columbia release as the A-side. Perhaps if they had pushed the flip-side they would have had a hit. Gleam in Her Eye is the killer and is the perfect song for collectors of those very hard-to-find wild rockers of the ’60s. This song has a touch of Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound that’s gone crazy.” (Adapted from the description by an eBay seller from 2004.)\n\nThis is a reissue of Marmike 101 (above).\n\nKEN & CAROL Columbia 43374 Make Up Your Mind / Gleam In Her Eye\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\nLike many non-hit records from this era, the white label promotional pressing is easier to find than the red label commercial pressing.\n\nSINNERS Mercury 72388 You Don’t Love Me / I Like The Look Of You\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $50-100.\n\nHONDELLS Mercury 72405 Little Sidewalk Surfer Girl / Come On (Pack It On)\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nNOTIONS Mercury 72413 Bumble Bee ’65 / Notions*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 9 with a near mint value of $100-150.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 9 with a near mint value of $150-200.\n\nThe Notions on Mercury are not the Dutch beat-group known as the Motions who gave Rimsky-Korsakov’s Flight Of The Bumble Bee a garage-surf updating. The B-side, Notions, features the Davie Allan on lead guitar.\n\nSINNERS Mercury 72453 A Change / Goin’ Out Of My Mind\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $40-60.\n\nDavie Allan has assured me that neither he nor the Arrows were on the Sinners sides but the record is listed here as many collectors believe otherwise.\n\nHONDELLS Mercury 72479 Sea Cruise / You Meet The Nicest People On A Honda*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nPETER FORD Philips 40336 Don’t Keep It To Yourself / Blue Ribbons\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Picture sleeve: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nHARLEY HATCHER\n\nSidewalk 2 The Twirl / All I Need Is You\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nJERRY NAYLOR\n\nSmash 1971 I Found You / I’ll Take You Home\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nTower 116 is a reissue of Sidewalk 1 from the previous year.\n\nARROWS FEATURING DAVIE ALLAN\n\nTower 116 Apache ’65 / Blue Guitar\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nARROWS FEATURING DAVIE ALLAN\n\nTower 133 Moon Dawg ’65 / Dance The Freddie\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\nJERRY NAYLOR\n\nTower 139 It’s Only Make Believe / Leave Him And Come To My Arms\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nARROWS FEATURING DAVIE ALLAN\n\nTower 142 Baby Ruth / I’m Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nSTARLETS\n\nTower 144 You Don’t Love Me / I’ve Had It\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $100-150.\n\nFRANKIE ALBANO\n\nTower 153 She’ll Never Know / Forgetful One\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nARROWS FEATURING DAVIE ALLAN\n\nTower 158 Space Hop / Granny Goose\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $40-80.\n\nJERRY NAYLOR\n\nTower 162 City Lights / Life\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $300-400.\n\nThis record goes for big bucks because it is highly sought after by collectors of the nebulous Northern Soul genre.\n\nMOORE & MOORE\n\nValiant 749 Leave Him And Come To My Arms / You’re All I Live For\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nFASTEST GROUP ALIVE Teem TM-102 The Bears / Beside\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\nFASTEST GROUP ALIVE Valiant 754 The Bears / Beside\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nKIM FOWLEY\n\nMira 209 American Dream / The Statue\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 9 with a near mint value of $200-300.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\n1966\n\nMIKE CURB\n\nTower 202 Suzie Darling / Sunshine\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 3 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nJERRY NAYLOR\n\nTower 214 Would You Believe / My Special Angel\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nGREEN BEANS Tower 237 Knock On My Door / Who Needs You\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $30-50.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Picture sleeve: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $30-50.\n\nBAND WITHOUT A NAME Tower 246 Turn On Your Lovelight / A Perfect Girl\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $20-25.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\n“We were doing recordings at Mike Curb’s Sidewalks Production studio around that time and that’s where we recorded it. We had a vocal tutor named Charles Wright. He was in the group called Charles Wright & The 103rd Rhythm Band. I believe Casey [Kasem] wanted some soul in our music. Richard Faith wrote A Perfect Girl and arranged all the harmonies for that song. I believe Charley may have arranged Turn On Your Lovelight. I played the rhythm guitar and sang harmonies on both.” (Larry Puckett of Band Without A Name)\n\nDAVIE ALLAN & THE ARROWS Tower 267 Theme From The Wild Angels / U.F.O.\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\nVISITORS FEATURING BARBARA Tower 268 Theme From The Wild Angels* / Is It Them Or Me?\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nTheme From The Wild Angels is a vocal interpretation of the theme song to the movie The Wild Angels recorded by Davie Allan & The Arrows (above). The Visitors feature Barbara Pittman, who recorded for Sam Phillips’s Sun Records and Phillips International Records in the ’50s. Refer to the Thirteenth Committee.\n\nThe first two images are West Coast pressings and credit Davie Allan and the Arrows. The label on top incorrectly reads “Mike Curb / Produced by” on the right side and probably the first pressing of this record. The second label correctly reads “Produced by / Mike Curb.” The third image is an East Coast pressing credits The Arrows Featuring Davie Allen (sic). The final image is a later West Coast pressing that credits The Arrows Featuring Davie Allen and was Allan’s only Tower 45 that was kept in print on the striped label.\n\nARROWS FEATURING DAVIE ALLAN or DAVIE ALLEN & THE ARROWS Tower 295 Blue’s Theme / Bongo Party\n\n• Promo copy: Unreleased?• Stock copy: Orange labels have a Scarcity Index of 2 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Stock copy: Striped labels have a Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\n“We did a short subject called Skaterdater. It’s a great little movie [that] Roger Corman saw and said, ‘That’s the sound I want to use for The Wild Angels movie.’ That’s how we got that. They were forced to put out Blue’s Theme from the album; they had so many requests for it and that’s the theme that shows Peter Fonda’s entrance. The motorcycle sound on it is actually Peter starting up his bike.\n\nThen it went crazy. We were in every city everywhere across the country. Each night we were on a plane going someplace else. Blue’s Theme was #1 everywhere it went, but not at one time. That’s why on Billboard it only hit #37, but it was there for seventeen weeks. It was on some charts in December 1966 and it was still on others in September 1967. That’s nine months that record was selling!” (Davie Allan)\n\nBlue’s Theme was a somewhat bigger hit on Cash Box, where it reached #33 and spent twenty-three weeks on that survey.\n\nHANDS OF TIME Sidewalk 903 Got To Get You Into My Life* / Midnight Rider*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $30-50.\n\nThe Hands Of Time is actually Davie Allan & The Arrows.

He sang the lead. We both tried it, but Mike Curb said I sounded too much like Paul McCartney; not tough enough. He was right. Richard and I wrote Time After Time and our band recorded the entire song, vocals and all. He sang the lead and I sang the high harmony. The record came out just after I left the band and my name never appeared on the credits.\n\nI remember a Thunder Alley session in the Glendale area. I think it was a studio that Brian Wilson built or used. Davie Allan & The Arrows were also there. I don’t believe they used any of the stuff we recorded there, which wasn’t much. The Arrows did all the soundtrack instrumentals. Time After Time was recorded at Sidewalk Sounds, Mike Curb’s studio in Hollywood.” (Mark Anderson of Band Without A Name)\n\nThis record was arranged and produced by Davie Allan and featured his fuzz guitar.\n\nTONY & THE VIZITORS Sidewalk 915 Saturday’s Son* / Nite Owl*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 9 with a near mint value of $150-200.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nGYPSY BOOTS Sidewalk 919 I Feel So Fine / We’re Havin’ A Love-In\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\n• Picture sleeve: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\nGLASS FAMILY Sidewalk 920 Teenage Rebellion / Teenage Rebellion\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $10-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nNote that Annette’s first name was misspelled with three ‘T’s instead of two.\n\nANNETTE (ANNETTE FUNICELLO) Tower 326 What’s A Girl To Do / When You Get What You Want*• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $25-35.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $40-50.\n\nNote the variations in the labels above: the top image credits DAVIE ALLAN in large print with and THE ARROWS in smaller print; the middle image credits DAVIE ALLAN and THE ARROWS in the same large print; and the bottom image credits DAVIE ALLEN AND and THE ARROWS in same large print, except that Allan’s name is misspelled.\n\nDAVIE ALLAN & THE ARROWS Tower 341 Devil’s Angels / Cody’s Theme\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 3 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\n“We had a Hell’s Angel come down to Continental Studio. We took a microphone out in the parking lot and he started up his bike and went up and down the aisle and we taped it about eight times and the record starts off with [what sounds like] all these bikers starting up their bikes. I don’t know why Devil’s Angels didn’t take off more than it did. There was a mix-up in L.A.: Mike Curb had promised an exclusive to KRLA but gave it to KHJ and they both got so mad they both dropped it.” (Davie Allan)\n\nSIDEWALK SOUNDS Tower 352 The Born Losers Theme* / Billy Jack’s Theme\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\nThis promotional EP features Love Theme From The Wild Racers by the Arrows.

Cycle-Delic is Davie Allan exploring the then-new psychedelic sounds with fuzz guitar and a touch of the wah-wah pedal. It is a 2:20 edit of the nearly seven-minute track from the CYCLE-DELIC album.\n\nLEATHER BOY MGM 13724 I’m A Leather Boy / Shadows\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Picture sleeve: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\nPRISCILLA York 405 He Noticed Me / Help Me\n\n• Promo copy: Yellow and black labels have a Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\n• Promo copy: Black and white labels have a Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 9 with a near mint value of $50-100.\n\nPriscilla is Priscilla Paris of the Paris Sisters, with whom Davie Allan had recorded earlier (above).\n\n1968\n\nTHIRTEENTH COMMITTEE Manhattan 810 Sha La La / You Really Got A Hold On Me\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\nThe Thirteenth Committee features Barbara Pittman, who recorded for Sam Phillips’s Sun Records and Phillips International Records in the ’50s.

Note that on the record the group is 13th Power while on the sleeve they are The 13th Power.\n\n13th POWER Sidewalk 920 Captain Hassel / I See A Change Is Gonna Come\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $40-50.\n\nDON EPPERSON Sidewalk 933 Gonna Have A Good Time* / Please Mrs. Peckingpaw*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nPORTRAITS Sidewalk 935 Runaround Girl / Over The Rainbow\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $25-35.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nSTONE PONEYS Sidewalk 937 So Fine* / Everybody Has Their Own Ideas\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 5 with a near mint value of $25-35.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $100-200.\n\nThe Stone Poneys were lead singer Linda Ronstadt with Bobby Kimmel (rhythm guitar and vocals) and Kenny Edwards (lead guitar). On this record, they are supported by Davie Allan (guitar) with Arrows Drew Bennett (bass) and Larry Brown (drums).\n\n“Sidewalk signed the Stone Poneys in 1966 and released a single called Everybody’s Got His Own Ideas backed by So Fine. To the best of my knowledge, the Stone Poneys never recorded for Mercury. Even though Sidewalk did not have a chart record with them, our records were released prior to Capitol and I was instrumental in helping the Stone Poneys and Nick Venet get together at Capitol. I wish I could have kept them on Sidewalk, but in 1967 Nick Venet asked me as a favor to let them record for Capitol, which I believe turned out to be the right decision.” (Mike Curb)\n\nMAX FROST & THE TROOPERS Sidewalk 938 There Is A Party Going On* / Stompers Ride* /\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 9 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nMIKE CLIFFORD / SIDEWALK SOUNDS Sidewalk 939 Mary Jane / Gas Hassle\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $15-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\nSECOND TIME Sidewalk 943 Shadows / Magic Man\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $20-40.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nTower shipped the promotional copies of this record with a special picture sleeve promoting THE ARROWS PLAY MUSIC FROM THE SCORE OF WILD IN THE STREETS album.\n\nDAVIE ALLAN & THE ARROWS Tower 446 Shape Of Things To Come / Wild In The Streets\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 7 with a near mint value of $20-30.\n\n• Promo picture sleeve: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $50-100.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $50-100.\n\n“I wish I could say that [the Arrows] were Max Frost & The Troopers, but unfortunately, it’s just not true. I did play on the Wild In The Streets soundtrack along with studio musicians known as the Hollywood Wrecking Crew, but none of us played on Shape Of Things To Come. A band was hired to do that one and it was kept a secret as to whom the members were!\n\nThe mix-up started when my instrumental version was released as the last Arrows single on the Tower Records label. All I did was play lead on that pre-recorded track, so everyone assumed that we and Max Frost were one and the same. I am on some of the Max Frost tracks, including the ones that appeared on The Glory Stompers soundtrack.” (Davie Allan)\n\nMAX FROST & THE TROOPERS Tower 452 Fifty Two Percent / Max Frost Theme\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $15-25.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $15-25.\n\nSLEEVE\n\nDOUG BROOKINS Imperial 66343 I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am / As Time Goes On\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $6-12.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nPARIS SISTERS Capitol 2081 Greener Days / Golden Days\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $10-20.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 6 with a near mint value of $15-30.\n\n1969\n\nJIM PEWTER RCA 74-0186 Father Kline / Sunday Morning Light\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $6-12.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $6-12.\n\nRUSS VIOT\n\nNose 14-003 It’s Your Feeling / Helper\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 8 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\nRalph “Russ” Viot was the rhythm guitar player for the Arrows between 1964 and 1967.\n\n1971\n\nSOUNDS OF HARLEY MGM 14248 The Hard Ride* / Victorville Blues*\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $15-25.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $25-35.\n\nDAVIE ALLAN MGM 14299 It’s the Little Things You Do / You And Me\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $30-40.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $40-50.\n\n1972\n\nDAVIE ALLAN MGM 14374 Head Over Heels / Here It Comes\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $10-15.\n\n• Stock copy: Unreleased?\n\nARROWS MGM 14432 Dawn Of The 7th Cavalry / Little Big Horn\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $6-12.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $6-12.\n\nARROWS MGM 14432 Dawn At Wounded Knee / Little Big Horn\n\n• Promo copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $6-12.\n\n• Stock copy: Scarcity Index of 4 with a near mint value of $6-12.\n\nThe instrumental Dawn At Wounded Knee is the same track as Dawn Of The 7th Cavalry. The title was changed in the wake of the incident at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in February 1973.\n\n“Head Over Heels and Dawn At Wounded Knee were the only two that really started to get action anywhere, but MGM—I don’t know if I should say this—they were so busy with the Osmonds that they didn’t work on any other record they had.

The Born Losers Theme combines the best of the vintage feel with an updated sound. The Glory Stompers leans more towards a modern sound while retaining Allan’s trademark guitar stylings.

Below is a collection of the few sleeves I could find.\n\nIn West Germany, both Apache ’65 / Blue Guitar and Baby Ruth / I’m Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover rated a picture sleeve. And the same photo of the Capitol tower in Los Angeles was used, although why Capitol thought German youths would be interested in the building is beyond me.\n\nIn Japan, Apache ’65 / Blue Guitar rated a picture sleeve, although the pedestrian artwork looks likee it was based on a photo of Keith Richards and Brian Jones more than on the Arrows.\n\nIn Japan, Baby Ruth / I’m Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover rated a picture sleeve.\n\nIn West Germany, Theme From The Wild Angels rated a picture sleeve.\n\nIn Sweden, Theme From The Wild Angels rated a picture sleeve.\n\nIn Japan, Billy Jack’s Theme rated a picture sleeve.\n\nIn Mexico, Billy Jack’s Theme rated a picture sleeve. The main Spanish title on the sleeve translates as “Original Music From The Movie Born To Lose.” The two songs are Tema De La Pelicula Nacidos Para Perder – Cancion de Billy Jack (“Theme Of The Movie Born To Lose – Song of Billy Jack”) and Le Pelea De Gangrena (“The Gangrenous Feud”).\n\nIn France, Fifty Two Percent / Free Lovin’ rated a picture sleeve. “Les Troupes De La Colere” translates as “The Troops Of Color.”\n\nDavie Allan’s fuzz guitar was an audio compass pointing towards freedom, sex, danger, and violence in the ’60s on record and in movie scores. Share on X\n\nFEATURED IMAGE: The photo at the top of this page is an official publicity still used by Tower Records to promote Davie Allan & the Arrows. Another photo from this shoot was used for the front cover of Davie’s first album, BLUES THEME (Tower T-5078) from 1967. Davie is the evil-eyed dude cradling the twin-necked guitar.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n1 As Paul Newman and Robert Redford flee the specially-picked posse of famous bounty hunters that doggedly pursue them through the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, they repeatedly ask one another, “Who are those guys?”\n\n2 DEVIL’S RUMBLE is a compilation of tracks from the’60s by Davie Alland and the Arrows in their various guises. Many of the sides on the singles listed in this discography can be found on this album.\n\n“Davie Allan & The Arrows recorded the most frenzied instrumentals the world has ever heard! Allan’s fuzzed-out guitar was an audio compass pointing towards freedom, sex, danger and violence, his trashy fretboard riffs exploding behind flickering celluloid images of cycle runs, biker fights, drug freakouts and rubber-burnin’ hot rods. The myriad of Arrows’ recordings is filled with loud, loose and savage tracks, and includes the mega-hit Blues Theme from the trashy Roger Corman flick, The Wild Angels.\n\nAllan’s recordings were originally spread out over four studio albums, a bevy of impossible-to-find singles, and more than a dozen rare soundtrack appearances from 1965-68, thus defusing his long-overdue recognition.\n\nTo restore Davie Allan to his rightful place atop the ranks of fabled guitar gunslingers, we have lovingly compiled a 40-track, double CD/28-track, double LP gatefold-edition anthology that rounds up the best of Allan’s 45s, sizzling album cuts, and many mind-splattering widescreen rarities with a full-band history, interviews with Davie, producer Mike Curb, original Arrows members, plus unseen photos, original album graphics, AIP poster reproductions, and more!” (Sundazed Records)"
