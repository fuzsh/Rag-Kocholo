Just recently on this forum I responded to a thread - which one, I can't remember - that I hoped one day there would be a compilation of Keith Relf's various projects from his early days in the Yardbirds until his last band, Armageddon. It's something I've wished for for a long time... apparently, my wish will be granted; in part at least. Repertoire Records just posted this on Facebook:

Coming soon on CD & Deluxe Vinyl ⏺️ Keith Relf - "All the Falling Angels - Solo Recordings & Collaborations 1965-1976". A carefully selected collection of Keith’s work as a solo artist and incollaboration with fellow Yardbird Jim McCarty and his sister Jane Relf. It includes previously

unreleased demos from Keith’s personal tape archive, along with rare tracks by Together, the duo he formed with McCarty in 1968, his hard to find 1966 solo singles, and more. #theyardbirds #repertoirerecords #legacymusic

And they're not even particularly interesting... so many more items - either released yet obscure or unreleased demos that I'd rather have all compiled in one place...

Found the tracklist:

1. Knowing [1965 solo B-side]

2. Mr. Zero [1965 solo A-side]

3. All The Pretty Little Horses [1965 BBC session]

Always loved this song. Amazing Keith is singing it in a much higher register, but it's still very interesting. I'm looking forward to this set! Thanks, Yardbyrd!

Not sure when this is from, but imagine a Page produced Yardbirds LP where they're going the acoustic folk route full fledge... ironically, McCarty in a recent interview I did with him in late 2017 said he and Keith were so intent on getting out of the Yardbirds that they really had no idea Jimmy was an acoustic folk fan... their motivation to leave the band in '68 was to do acoustic folk material...

Thanks. Looks like I can't get it here in the US, though, at least not for the time being.

I was excited about news of his biography.. but then seen page count...

Keith deserves far more recognition than he garners especially in the context of the Yardbirds, where the lead guitarists overshadow all the other members...
