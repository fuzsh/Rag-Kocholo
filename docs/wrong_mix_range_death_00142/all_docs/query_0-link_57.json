        "text": "March 31, 2022\n\nRamin Djawadi, who is often called a “musical chameleon” for his versatility, is best known for his work on Game of Thrones, Iron Man, Eternals, and now most recently, Uncharted. Ramin has also composed scores for blockbuster video games such as New World, Gears of War 4 and Medal of Honor.\n\nRamin is a two-time Emmy® Award-winner for “Outstanding Music Composition for A Series Original Dramatic Score” and a three-time Grammy® nominee. Following the success of the Game of Thrones score, Ramin has conducted and performed at over 75 arena concerts to date, culminating in a sold-out performance at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.\n\nHe has also worked closely with Hans Zimmer scoring some of his first projects such as Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and Batman Begins.\n\nWe are excited that Ramin has joined us to be our guest for this month’s Film Favorites series.
