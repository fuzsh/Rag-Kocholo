        "text": "\"The function of a score is to enlarge the scope of a film. I try for emotional penetration - not for complementing the action. For me, the important thing about music is statement. I can't describe how I arrive at the decision to make a statement, I simply feel it and react to it.\"\n\nWelcome To Jerry Goldsmith Online\n\nJerry Goldsmith Online was launched in 1999 as a fan based website to follow the career of the legendary composer of Radio, TV and Film. When Jerry Goldsmith tragically passed away in 2004 it left a huge void in the world of film music, but his legacy of over 50 years of music means that the legend will live on.
