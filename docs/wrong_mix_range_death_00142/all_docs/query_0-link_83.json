Frank had been out of health for a year or more preceding his death. Last fall he and his mother went to Columbia, Tennessee, where his brother E.W.

Frank was always a good boy; obedient to his parents; moral in his general conduct, and respected by all who knew him. He recently desired to unite with the Presbyterian Church, and was received in full communion several weeks ago. His death is a heavy affliction to his parents, and calls forth the sympathy of the whole community. The youngest and only son at home, they evidently looked upon him as the comfort and stay of their old age, which is now blasted, just as he upon whom their hopes in this life were fixed, was emerging into manhood.

Anderson, when the remains were deposited in the old cemetery, numerously attended by friends of the deceased, and by the most extensive relationship, perhaps existing in Shelby and surrounding country.

Garber, a former well known resident of this county, was found dying at an early hour this morning on the street in Chicago with a bullet in his head. A United Associated Press dispatch to the News gives the following account of the affair: Chicago, March 25 -- B.L. Garber, 47 years old, a traveling salesman, Bellville, O., was found in an alley near Van Buren Street and Fifth Avenue at midnight unconscious and with blood pouring from a wound in the head. The man was placed on the operating table at the county hospital at 2 o'clock this morning. The doctors found a bullet in his brain. He is unconscious and will die. Garber was found by the police lying face downward in a pool of blood, and near by was a revolver with all the chambers loaded. His pockets had been turned inside out and no money was found on his person. The police think Garber was assaulted and robbed by highwaymen and then dragged into the alley. The foregoing dispatch would indicate that the victim was assaulted for purpose of robbery and murdered by his assailants. It is possible that the revolver which was found was Mr. Garber's and that he was rendered unconscious before he had opportunity to use it. The location in which the body was found is one of the worst in the city. The News telephoned Bellville at 3:30 this afternoon and learned that relatives there had just received a dispatch that Mr. Garber was dying. The deceased was a brother of County Commissioner J.L. Garber, of Bellville. He was 47 years of age and leaves a wife and six children, two daughters and four sons, at Bellville. Some months ago Mr. Garber, who is a miller by occupation, was employed to take charge of a mill at Hayesville. Subsequently an explosion occurred there which wrecked the mill and is attributed by Mr. Garber's friends to the malice of some one who held a grudge against Garber. It is also asserted that he received white cap warnings to leave the place. Garber, for that or other cause, left Hayesville, and for some months his whereabouts seemed unknown to any save his family, though it is understood that he was traveling for a mill supply firm.

Engaged in the campaign in Kentucky and Tennessee in pursuit of the rebel Gen. Bragg, in 1862. He was taken prisoner at Athens, Ala., Sept. 24, 1864, while in a hospital with catarrh in the left hand. The town of Athens was captured by rebel cavalry under Gen. N.B. Forest and taken to Menden, Miss. Here an escape was planned, but failed for lack of preconcerted action and were thrown back into prison under punishment of a fast of 48 hours. At the end of six months they were exchanged and sent to Jackson, Miss., from whence they marched to Big Black river, three miles in the rear of Vicksburg. April 26, about 2100 prisoners went aboard the ill-fated Sultana for passage up the Mississippi River. When seven miles above Memphis the boilers exploded and 1400 men were either killed or drowned. Mr. Garber was on the upper deck and was badly scalded by steam and hot water, and did not leave the boat until compelled to do so by the flames. He secured a window shutter and floated with the current 11 miles before he was picked up and taken to Memphis. From there he was taken to Camp Chase, at Columbus, Ohio, and discharged May 20, 1865, by special order of secretary of war. -- [Bellville Messenger: 27 April 1906, Vol. 14, No. 13]\n\nGarber, Daniel\n\nGarber, David -- David Garber, residing near Mt.

Garber, a life-long resident of Jefferson Township, passed peacefully to his reward, Friday, Feb. 6, at 3 a.m., after a year's illness with a complicated disease. The funeral took place from the family home east of Bellville, Monday at 12 o'clock, the services being conducted by rev. H.L. Canfield of Milan. The interment was made in the Bellville Cemetery, under the auspices of Casca Lodge, No. 382, K. of P., of which order deceased was a member. The ritualistic work of the lodge was performed in a very impressive manner, and was witnessed by a large number of people, who were present to pay the last tribute of respect to the memory of the departed. Deceased was born of Swiss lineage, in Jefferson Township, Oct. 29, 1835, and was therefore aged 67 years, three months and seven days, at the time of his death. He as one of a family of eleven children, of whom survive, John L., of Jefferson Township; Lewis L., of Bellville; Mrs. Aaron Leedy, and Jackson L., of Missouri; Washington Garber, of Cincinnati; Theodore L. Garber and Mrs. O.B. Rummel, of Bellville. He was united in marriage June 19, 1856, with Miss Susan Wallace, of Knox County, who is still living. To them were born nine children, of whom survive Mrs. John Watson, Mrs. S.A. Oyster, Misses Ida M. and Myrtle Garber, Horatio S. and J.W. Garber of Jefferson Township, and J.M. Garber of Mt. Vernon. Something over a year ago Mr. Garber took his son Wallace to New Mexico for his health but despite all that could be done for him he succumbed to consumption. While there, Mr. Garber contracted a cold which resulted in other complications and he gradually grew worse until he passed away. Mr. Garber was elected county commissioner twice, the first time without opposition and served as such from Jan. 1890 to Sept. 1896. He served some time as a member of the Jefferson Township School Board and of the Board of Trustees. He was prominent in Jefferson Grange and did much to further the interest of the farming class. Mr. Garber's work in the Farmers' Institute at Butler and Bellville, in past years is especially worthy of mention. He acted in the capacity of president of both institutes for a number of years, and was a model presiding officer. His papers on farm affairs, were always well prepared and given, and the vacancy in the institutes can not be filled. In 1902 Gov. Nash appointed him a delegate to the Farmers' International Congress at Colorado Springs, Col., and again in 1902 he was chosen delegate to the same convention, which he was unable to attend on account of ill health. In his death, the community loses a model neighbor, the family an affectionate parent and the people at large a champion for the cause of the down-trodden. -- [Bellville Messenger: 12 February 1903, Vol. 11, No. 6]\n\nGarber, Lloyd M. -- 79Y; d. 10/13/1956 at Charleston, WV; former Bellville resident; h/o Susie Oberlin; brother of Mabel Beachler, Louise Johnson and W.C.

The children's children for ages to come will point back with pride to the life of Samuel Garber. Almost forgotten he was by the fast going times, but today we pause to do honor to the hero who so quietly passed over to the majority. We cannot do too much honor to those who endured the hardships of pioneer life, whose ax felled the mighty oak, whose courage defied the scalping knife of the Indian, enduring privations and want that these then \"western wilds\" might be made habitable for man. May the rising generation never forget the debt, while the Clearfork runs on to the gulf or the hills cast their shadows about them extol the memory of the noble and true. Samuel Garber was born May 8, 1804, died April 27, 1893, aged 88 years, 11 months and 19 days. He was born at York, Pa., and died at the home of his son, Theodore, 2½ miles east of Bellville, O. His mother's maiden name was Anna Mock. His father, John Garber, enlisted in the war of 1812, and never returned, and is supposed to have been killed in the battle of Lundy's Lane, July 25, 1814. The family consisting of his mother and three sons, John, David and himself, moved to Morrison's Cove, Bedford Co., Pa., where his mother married Sim Brollier for her second husband. After her marriage he lived for awhile with his uncle Jacob Mock, and afterward learned the shoemaker's trade with his stepfather. He also teamed for him over the mountains to Pittsburg, hauling the pig iron, which was prepared in the mountains, and now to the historic city of Johnstown, where he came near having a fatal accident by the breaking of ice while he was crossing the river with a heavy load of this iron. In 1822, at the age of 18, he emigrated to Ohio with his uncle Jacob Mock's family, who settled in Knox County, near the north line, where the B. & O. R.R. now crosses. He worked at shoemaking for a short time, \"Whipping the cat\" as they called it, going around from house to house. He soon engaged to work for John Leedy who had settled at the early date of 1811, were Frank Garber now lives, near the south line of Richland County. At this date there were only fourteen families in the county, eleven in Mansfield and three outside. At one time they all fled to the Block House at Fredericktown to escape the ravages of the Indians in 1812. On Sept. 17, 1825, he married Catharine Leedy, a daughter of his employer. He commenced housekeeping on the farm of is father-in-law, when his brother David lived. He entered Sec. 28, Jefferson Twp., where Hezekiah Sweet now lives and soon bought part of Sec. 35, the present home of his son-in-law, Aaron A. Leedy. He added to this and lived here till the death of John Leedy, his father-in-law, where he bought the old Leedy farm and moved on it in 1851. In 1863 he traded his farms for those of Aaron Leedy and Jacob Garber, located 2½ miles east of Bellville. Here four years after celebrating their golden wedding, Mrs. Garber passed over to the majority, Oct. 24, 1879. His son, Benton Garber moved in and kept house for him till Nov. 1891, when Benton removed to the mill west of town. He then made his home with his son, Theodore, till the time of his death. Father and mother Garber were blessed with nine children, nine of whom are living -- seven sons and two daughters. One daughter became the wife of Aaron A. Leedy, one of the first farmers of this county. Another the wife of O.B. Rummel of our town; John L. Garber, one of our first farmers; Lewis L. Garber, a well known mechanic of our town; L. Garber, an extensive farmer of St. Louis; David L. Garber, deceased, the father of Rev. Garber of Ashland; Elihu and Levi of our town; Jehu L. Garber, our much respected County Commissioner now on his second term; Washington L. Garber, in the powder business at Cincinnati; Theodore Garber, lives on one of the most beautiful farms in the Clearfork Valley, made so by his industry, the old Garber homestead in later years; Benton L. Garber, doing a first-class milling business west of town. It is due to say, and we will say it truthfully, that a more honorable, upright family cannot be found -- not a black sheep in the whole flock. They have not departed from the landmarks which the father and mother set up. There are forty-nine grandchildren and forty-six great-grandchildren living. Father and mother Garber became members of the Universalist church about 1850, and continued to the end. They were faithful and consistent members. All their children living are members of the Universalist church together with the seven daughters-in-law, one son-in-law and twenty-three grandchildren -- forty-nine in all. Samuel Garber was well fitted for the life of a pioneer. He was strong physically, mentally and morally. He was noted for his honorable dealing, and his neighbors and friends speak in very highest terms of his noble, upright, manly character. Industrious, honest, frugal and strong, he succeeded of course, and was blessed with a competence. He had no opportunities of education in his day and never attended anything but a writing school when he was twenty-one years old, yet he did all his figuring and calculating readily and was a great reader in his later life. All his possessions were tied up in a bandana handkerchief when he came from Pennsylvania. Father Garber began to distribute $1500 to each of his children as they were married. He distributed thus to ten. Afterwards he increased this to $3000 each. He leaves an estate yet of at least $20,000. His funeral took place from the Universalist church in Bellville, April 29, 1893, Rev. John Richardson officiating. Interment at Bellville Cemetery. All the children were present except for Mrs. A. Leedy, who is quite ill. Six of the sons, full of manly strength, acted as pallbearers on this solemn occasion. -- [BELLVILLE INDEPENDENT: 11 May 1893, Vol. 5, No. 52]\n\nGarber, Samuel -- Samuel Garber, father of County Commissioner Garber, one of the earliest settlers of Jefferson township, died at 2:20 a.m. of pneumonia at his home near Bellville. He was a citizen of the highest character and sterling integrity, leaving behind him a family of the same desirable qualities. The deceased was born in York County, Pa., on May 8, 1804, and during his early life his mother moved to Bedford County, in the same state. As he grew to manhood he learned the shoemaker's trade and in 1821 with a family named Mock moved to this state and this county. Upon his arrival here he worked with John Leedy, a pioneer family, and he remained there until he married Catharine Leedy, Sept. 17, 1825. He spent the greater number of years of his life farming in Jefferson tp. The family consisted of 12 children, three of whom with the mother have died. The remaining children, prosperous and influential citizens of Bellville and Jefferson township, are too well known to the citizens of Richland county to need mention here, J.L. Garber being county commissioner at the present time and a most noted example of the worthy family. The funeral will be held at Bellville on Saturday afternoon, April 29th. [Richland Shield & Banner: 29 April 1893]\n\nGarber, Samuel -- Bellville. The funeral of Samuel Garber, which took place at the Universalist Church on Saturday at 2 p.m., was attended by nearly all of his large family of children and grandchildren, beside as many friends and neighbors as could find room in the church. Seven sons were present, six of whom acted as pall bearers. Rev. Richardson delivered an eloquent discourse and a glowing eulogy on the life of the good man. [Richland Shield & Banner: 06 May 1893]\n\nGarber, Samuel Bigler -- Mr. Samuel Bigler Garber, whose death occurred in New York City on Wednesday, February 1, 1905, notice of which was telegraphed to the Advocate, was born September 15, 1818, on his father's farm in Washington Co., Pa. He was the youngest child of a family of twelve children, born unto Jacob Garber and Magdalene Eller Garber. He removed to Ohio early in the thirties, coming over the mountains in caravan wagons, the only method of travel at that time. The family located in Richland County, Ohio, in 1837. October 6, he was united in marriage to Lydia Mikesell; in 1858 Mr. Garber and his family moved to Newark, Ohio, where he resided until his death. In the year 1887 Mr. Garber and his wife celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. At this even there were present ten children, eleven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Mrs. Garber survived his period nearly six years. They were thus married nearly 56 years, when Mrs. Garber died, at their old home, 212 South Fifth Street, January 4, 1893. Mr. Garber, for many years was one of the foremost contractors and builders in Newark. He retired from actual work about 20 years ago and has since that retirement occupied his time in visiting the homes of his many children, nine of whom survive him.

John Garber, who resides four miles south of this place, received a message on Saturday stating that his son, Walter, had died at Huron, O. Mr. Garber telegraphed to the authorities at Huron to have the body expressed to this place, which they agreed to do. Later a message was received asking for a guarantee, whereupon Mr. Garber deposited the amount with the express agent and went home expecting the body to come at 11 a.m. on Sunday. A few hours later a message came state that it was too late to send the body. A brother of the deceased went to Huron on Sunday. He found that his brother had died alone in his room at a boarding house and that his illness had been very brief. The body had been interred in a mostly shabby manner and without any funeral services. Some of the doctors and better class of citizens first learned of the case on Sunday and asked for a post mortem, when the body was disinterred, but owing to the advanced state of decomposition the brother's wish to start at once with the body was granted. The body arrived at this place at 6 o'clock p.m. on Monday, and was taken to the Dunkard Cemetery, near Ankenytown. On Tuesday Mr. Garber received a message from the Huron doctors asking permission to come and hold a post mortem. There is a mystery about the entire affair and much room for suspicion of foul play.

He was employed in the main office of the Western Union Telegraph, at Chicago. While at Chicago his health failed to such an extent that he was compelled to quit and return to his mother's home. Long and hard was the struggle, he having made a heroic fight over every inch of road. He was brave and courageous, and exerted every effort to overcome the dreaded disease, but slowly his strength waned and the end came on August 29th., just as the sun was sinking in the west. His soul sped away to its eternal abode, beyond the dark river that divides the seen from the unseen.

They also thank the people of the Times-Union, Western Union Telegraph, members of the order of Ben Hur, and the officials and employees of the court house.

Mr. Garn was a native of Pennsylvania and was born in 1831. He was the eldest son of Rev. and Mrs. Joseph Garn, who crossed the Alleghenies from Pennsylvania to Ohio when Adam was a mere lad. The family moved into the wilderness in northern Ohio and there the father and son set about clearing a little plot for a home. The father was both minister and farmer, a common combination of ministers in those early days. In 1853 the marriage of Mr. Garn to Mary M. Shafer took place and they began housekeeping not far from the home of Mr. Garn's parents. Later they moved to Bellville where Mr. Garn began keeping hotel. Many of his old friends will remember him as a progressive and thoroughly honest business man. In 1878 he moved to Indianapolis. While there his wife died. He became engaged in book business. In 1898 he was united in marriage to Mary Holtom, a former resident of Bellville. Mr. Garn is survived by two daughters, Mrs. M.L. Bonar and Mrs. M.N. Parr, also three sisters and one brother, three of whom live in Michigan, the brother in northern Indiana. Mr. Garn was a veteran of the late war, but in an unusual way. In ------- and 1861, he was traveling in the south as a book agent, owning a large supply of books, horses and a mon---- wagon. At the outbreak of the war Mr. Garn being a staunch supporter of the blue, was taken prisoner, his supplies confiscated and he was forced into service as a warden in a Southern hospital. For three years he served in this capacity, seeking constantly for a means of escape, but as constantly failing being guarded continually by his enemies. In 1864, shortly before the close of the war, he did escape and subsequently coming on home to a family who believed him dead. In Indianapolis Mr. Garn was a grocer a greater part of the time. He was an active business man and always prominent in the city. He was a great reader and was well versed in politics. Until within a couple days of his death he was in full possession of his fine intellect and wonderful memory, being able at all times to give specific dates, names, etc., of incidents which happened in his boyhood and upward. The burial was at Crown Hill, Indianapolis. -- Louisa J. Bonar. -- [Butler Times: 11 January 1908, Vol. 14, No. 18]\n\nGarn, Mary Holtom -- Mary Holtom Garn was born at Palmyra, Knox Co., Ohio, Feb. 11, 1832, and died at her late residence in South Milford, Indiana, Oct. 12, 1905, aged 73 years, 8 months and 1 day. Thomas and Margaret Holtom, grandparents of the deceased, emigrated from England about the year 1795, and settled near Meadville, Pa., where James Holtom, her father, was born April 12th., 1801. In 1812 he came to Richland County with Isaac Hoy (brother-in-law) who stayed for a short time in \"the Blockhouse at McCluer's Ford\" (now Bellville). He afterwards served his apprenticeship at the tanning business with Baker & Williams, at Fredericktown, Knox County, O., and with whom he remained until 1822, when he took charge of the \"Hoy & Holtom tannery\", the first enterprise of the kind at Bellville, which he successfully managed for many years. In 1826 Mr. Holtom was married to Miss Susannah Lash, with whom he lived until Feb. 4th., 1849, when she died and was buried in the cemetery at Lexington. The children of this marriage were nine to-wit: Harriett, John D., Lovina, Mary, Thomas, Ellen, Philip L., Joseph J. and William. The first of these to be summoned by the messenger of death was Harriett, who died at Evansville, Ind. Next, John D., at Marysville, Cal., in 1867; then Philip L., who was one of the unfortunate soldiers at the Sultana boat disaster. He had faithfully served out his three years enlistment -- a portion of the time in the notorious \"Libby Prison\" -- and was then on his way home to be discharged. His remains are yet in the Mississippi River. Thomas died at Bellville, O., Sept. 15, 1889, and Joseph J. at Brushy Prairie, Ind., Nov. 17, 1894. Lovina was the next to follow, who died at South Milford, Ind., Nov. 19th., 1901, and then Mary, leaving but two, Ellen and William, to mourn their loss. On Jan. 26, 1867, Mrs. Garn united with the Seventh-Day Adventist Church at Bellville, where she retained her membership and always aimed to live a consistent Christian life commanding the respect and confidence of all who knew her. July 24, 1895, she was united in marriage to Adam Garn and located at Indianapolis, Ind., where she lived five years, after which she moved to South Milford, Ind., where she lived till the time of her death. The ----- part of her life, however, was spent in Bellville and vicinity, where she will be long remembered by a large circle of friends as one who possessed many noble traits of character. We are pleased to mention that during her last illness, she who had spent so many days in the sick room ministering to others, was not neglected but received every attention and was tenderly cared for as long as mortal hands could serve her. We must not forget to also mention that during all the weary days and nights of suffering she manifested the same kind, gentle, patient disposition, a characteristic of her whole life. The end came without a struggle and like a weary child at the close of the day, she fell asleep to awake again, we confidently expect, to life and immortality at the resurrection of the just. The remains arrived at Bellville Friday evening on train No. 16, accompanied by her sister, Mrs. John Seaburn, and nephew, Frank Spaulding, both of South Milford, Ind. The funeral service was held Sunday, Oct. 15, at 12 p.m. from the residence of her brother, Wm. Holtom, on South Main Street, conducted by Eld. H.H. Burkholder, and the body was laid to rest by the side of other loved ones in the cemetery at Lexington. -- H.H.B. -- [Butler Enterprise: 20 October 1905, Vol. 17, No. 37]\n\nGarn, Mrs. M.M. (nee Shafer) -- Bellville. It is with sincere regret that we are obliged to record the death of Mrs. M.M. Garn which occurred at the home of her daughter, Mrs. M.L.

(nee Shafer) -- Died, Monday evening, Sept. 5th., 1887, at the residence of M.L. Bonar, Mrs. M.M. (Shafer) Garn in the fifty-fourth year of her age. She was born Nov. 7th., 1833 on what is commonly called the Shafer farm near the present site of the Salem Lutheran church, about 2½ miles west of Bellville, and with which church she united in early life and for which she entertained an adherent, ardent and loving devotion akin only to those of the most devoted Christians. Miss M.M. Shafer was united in marriage Oct. 1853 to Adam Garn, of Sandusky county to whom were born four children, two only of which now survive, Bell and Lutie. Her life was attended with many deep afflictions, yet through them all she manifested a spirit of submission, yet co-mingled with a resolute determination. Many of her characteristics were truly exemplary. No mother was ever more devoted and watchful over the interests of her own household. No hostess ever more desirous for the pleasure and complete enjoyment of her guests. No woman ever more diligent or faithful to her domestic duties. In this loss we truly mourn, but not as those who have no hope. She was most tenderly endeared to those who knew her best. We would bow in humble submission and say, Lord Thy will be done. -- [Bellville Star: 15 September 1887, Vol. 10, No. 51]\n\nGarner, Katherine Lucille -- Mansfield News Journal, 09 April 1974, p. 18\n\nGarnhart, Daniel -- Mr. Daniel Garnhart, an old and highly respected citizen of this vicinity hung himself yesterday (Wednesday) forenoon, while laboring under a bit of temporary insanity, caused by sickness.

The deceased, with her family came to Richland county, O., in the year 1846, and settled upon the homestead in Jackson township, where she died. She was united in marriage to Samuel Garrett in 1825, with whom she traveled lifes journey fifty-eight years. He still survives to mourn the loss of his faithful companion. The fruit of their union was two children, both daughters, one preceded her to the better land twenty-three years ago. The other (the wife of M.M. Barber), with her family survives to shed sorrows tears over a dear mothers bier. Mother Garrett in early life made a public profession of religion and united with the Evangelical Association, of which she remained a constant and faithful member up to her departure, and that Savior, to whose service she devoted her almost entire life, was her comfort and consolation in her many ears of suffering, and she died in peace. Yes, her form is gone. Her spirit still lingers and honors our surviving friends, though her body is not there. The sweet and precious memory of love and goodness is left for us to cherish. She was loved in life, she is remembered in death. She was prized and honored on earth, she will be sanctified in heaven. She does not need our lamentations or tears we shed for bereaved affection. She wears a crown of glory now and a robe of white. She has left her friends on earth and her companions are now the pure spirits of the upper world and her cup is full of joy. May this sad bereavement teach us humility and quiet submission to the will of God. Let it purify our spirits, lift us above the world and its storms, and prepare us for the hour of our own departure, and to meet our dear one on the evergreen shore, where parting is never known.

Shauck Cem. [MNJ 4/9/1955]\n\nGass, Allen -- Lexington. Allen Gass' sudden death early Thursday morning at his home, two miles north of here, keenly anguished the hearts of his many friends. His wife had left him in bed and when she went to call him found his tongue voiceless in death. He had been ill but was able to be up the day before. Heart disease was probably the cause of death. Mr. Gass died on the farm where he was born 72 years ago and he helped subdue the forest on that fertile and picturesque spot. He came of a family most distinguished in the annals of Troy Township. They were of highest social prestige and among them were jurists, legislators, divines and educators of distinction. His father, John Gass, was the third son of William Gass, who first penetrated the somber depths of the primitive forest in Troy Township in 1811. He reared a cabin two miles northeast of here on the farm now owned by H. Hainer and in April, 1812, brought his family there from Knox County. William Gass became distinguished as a jurist and legislator and died in March, 1846. John Gass and Ann McClure, parents of Allen Gass, were married in March, 1821. Allen Gass was twice married and his second wife and a son, O.A. Gass, by his first wife, survives him. Allen Gass inherited all the fine elements of brain and character of his ancestors. His mind was penetrating and his name was synonymous with all the elements of a noble manhood. Funeral services were held at 1 o'clock, April 2. The Rev. Mr. Thompson officiated and he paid a graceful tribute to one of whom it may be truly said that the world is better that he lived in it and whose name will long be revered. -- [Semi-Weekly News (Mansfield): 05 April 1898, Vol. 14, No. 27]\n\nGass, Allen -- Allen Gass, a well known farmer who resides about six miles south of the city, died at his home about 7 o'clock Thursday morning.

It appears that in walking near the corner of Market and Main Street, he made a misstep and fell, striking his head against the house, which although severe, he did not think serious, and proceeded to Mr. Arting's barber shop to get shaved, after being shaved, as usual he sat down to read one of the daily papers; but upon rising to leave he felt a dizziness, which Mr. Arting's son observed and went to his assistance, going with him and helping him to Hunt & Kendig's grocery, where Mr. Kendig, his nephew by marriage, noticed that his mind wandered, and immediately got a hack to take him home. By the time he was gotten into the house, he became insensible, and remained so until his death, which occurred about four o'clock in the morning from concussion of the brain. Benjamin Gass, at an early day was Auditor of Richland County, his father, Wm. R. Gass, having emigrated to this county in the spring of 1812, with his two sons, Benjamin and James, going into the forest and putting up a cabin, as was the custom of our worthy old pioneers, Benjamin being then 18 years of age. Many years ago, we had occasionally to break a political lance with our old friend on the subject of abolitionism; but it never broke or interfered with our personal friendship. He was constitutionally a gentleman and we always respected him, although always differing with him politically. Mr. Gass was 83 years of age, and his remains were attended to the Cemetery on Monday last, by a large number of friends.
