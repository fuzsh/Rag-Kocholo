The date, based on his eldest son‚Äôs birthday, is the fictional future history of events set to take place on April 5, 2063 (which is coming up!). That is the day humans first achieved warp speed in a spacecraft, resulting in Vulcans making their presence known to humans (Wikipedia).\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#piano #pianocover #coversong #JerryGoldsmith #StarTrek #FirstContact #Steinway #SteinwayAndSons @steinwayandsons\".",
