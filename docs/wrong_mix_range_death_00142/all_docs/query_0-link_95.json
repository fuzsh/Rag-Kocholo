We are a way for the universe to know itself.” – Carl Sagan\n\ninspired by jerry goldsmith’s TNG theme, with a bit of bruce broughton’s theme for The Orville, i wrote this main theme for space opera, to be played at the start and/or end of sessions.\n\nit’s written and exported straight from musescore studio, using the honestly impressive orchestral soundfont they released in version 4.\n\nsince part of what we’re hoping to do with the experience is have live music, it’s my biggest hope to have musicians take/quote/chop/remix the central motif throughout the session as our players navigate decision-making on a generational scale.\n\nlife is short, make every minute count.\n\nrunning late, running behind, running out of time.\n\nrise and grind, early bird, not a moment wasted.\n\nmemento mori—remember that you will die.\n\ndon’t waste my time time is money money is power\n\nlevels of extraction, refinement\n\nthe industrialization of living\n\nmine an hour and refine it into labour sold\n\nfor a number of dollars that buy you the power to… what?\n\nto feel free?\n\nin the time you have left?\n\nin the time you haven’t sold?\n\nno pain, no gain\n\nas if a redwood needed trauma to tower.\n\nwhat else dies on the alter of time?\n\ni’ll sleep when I’m dead\n\nas if the dead wouldn’t give everything to sleep, to dream, to rest.\n\nto lay down in one form and wake up renewed:\n\nsleep is not death, it is metamorphosis, transformation\n\nsleep is the seed in winter soil\n\nthe rising bread\n\nthe baby in the belly\n\nremember that you will die\n\ndid you remember that you will live?\n\nhave you never lain with your lover\n\nand felt a minute stretch into forever?\n\nwhat would it feel like to\n\nmake love to\n\nevery\n\nmoment?\n\ni am going to live forever\n\ni will make love to every moment\n\ni will ask can I do this forever?\n\ni will no longer strip-mine my time\n\ni will no longer colonize my time\n\ni will no longer tear up the\n\nrichly watered ferns of my hours\n\nto steal bauxite from my red earth:\n\nit is not sustainable.\n\nif time were sand\n\nthen you would dread the last grain\n\nbut time is water\n\nand you cannot drain the ocean\n\nyou are going to live forever\n\nyou are going to live forever\n\nyou are going to live forever\n\nso live"
