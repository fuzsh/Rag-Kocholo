        "text": "Summing up: this series was inspired by a document I found titled “Composers and Prices as of October 1, 1968,” which was in the papers of an A-list director of that era who was considering a composer for an upcoming prestige project (which was ultimately filmed and released without an original score). The composers were listed by their asking price -- I have ranked them from 1 to 17, based on their fees, and Part One featured the composers ranked 11 to 17, with the list reprinted at the bottom of this column. The specifics of each composers' age, credits and awards in these columns as are of October 1, 1968, while the box-office figures are generally approximate and incomplete, since the studios in that era did not provide up-to-date movie grosses the way they do today.\n\n10A. NELSON RIDDLE\n\nAGE: 47\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Oradell, New Jersey\n\n3 OSCAR NOMINATIONS\n\n7 EMMY NOMINATIONS\n\n1 GRAMMY, 9 NOMINATIONS\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Frank Sinatra\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. What a Way to Go!-- 6.1 (U.S. rentals in millions)\n\n2. Come Blow Your Horn--6.0\n\nEl Dorado--6.0\n\n4. Ocean’s Eleven--5.5\n\n5. A Hole in the Head--5.2\n\n6. Pal Joey--4.7\n\n7. Lolita--4.5\n\n8. Robin and the 7 Hoods--4.2\n\n9. Li’l Abner--3.2\n\n10. Can-Can--3.0\n\nHow to Succeed in Business without Really Trying--3.0\n\nFor the rest of his scoring career, Riddle worked mostly in television, including the theme for Emergency!, with the occasional feature like Harper Valley P.T.A. and Rough Cut (for which he adapted the music of Duke Ellington). He received his fourth Oscar nomination for his adaptation of Paint Your Wagon, and he won in 1974 for The Great Gatsby’s adaptation score. His last great success was a trio of albums he arranged of Linda Rondstadt singing classic American songs -- these albums earned him his second and third Grammys, the final one awarded posthumously after his death in 1985 at the age of 64.(Riddle’s ranking on this list was based on his asking price for original scores – his asking price for musicals was 150% more.)\n\n10B. GEORGE DUNING\n\nAGE: 60\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Richmond, Indiana\n\n5 OSCAR NOMINATIONS\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEES: From Here to Eternity, Picnic\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy, romance\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. From Here to Eternity--12\n\n2. That Touch of Mink--8\n\n3. The World of Suzie Wong--7\n\n4. Picnic--6\n\n5. Jolson Sings Again--5.5\n\n6. The Eddy Duchin Story--5.3\n\n7. Salome--4.75\n\n8. Pal Joey--4.7\n\n9. The Man from Laramie--3.3\n\nThe Wackiest Ship in the Army--3.3\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Then Came Bronson [TV]\n\nDuning did only a few more features, including the horror films Terror in the Wax Museum and Arnold and the gimmick mystery The Man with Bogart’s Face, but scored several TV movies before his retirement. He died in 2000 at the age of 92.\n\n10C. PERCY FAITH\n\nAGE: 60\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Toronto, Canada\n\n1 OSCAR NOMINATION\n\n1 GRAMMY, 4 NOMINATIONS\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Jack Smight\n\nTYPECAST IN: Drama\n\nFaith did not score any features after 1966, though he continued to produce “easy listening” albums until his death in 1976 at the age of 67.\n\n10D. DAVE GRUSIN\n\nAGE: 34\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Littleton, Colorado\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEE: The Graduate\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. The Graduate--39\n\n2. Divorce American Style--5\n\n3. Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?--3\n\n3. Waterhole #3--2\n\n4. The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter--1\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Candy, The Mad Room, Winning\n\nAt that point, Grusin was of course at the start of what would prove to be an extremely impressive feature scoring career -- in nearly four decades he earned an impressive eight Oscar nominations, including his scores for such hits as Heaven Can Wait, On Golden Pond and The Firm, as well as a surprise score Oscar for The Milagro Beanfield War. Several of his nominations were for films scored by his top collaborator, director Sydney Pollack, and during this same period he earned eight Grammy awards. He has also received honorary degrees from Berklee College of Music and University of Colorado, College of Music. Pollack died in 2008, and Grusin seems to have largely retired from film scoring; he turned 83 this summer.\n\n10E. DAVID RAKSIN\n\nAGE: 56\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n2 OSCAR NOMINATIONS\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEE: Separate Tables\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Curtis Harrington, Alexander Singer\n\nTYPECAST IN: Westerns\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. Forever Amber--5\n\n2. Apache--3.5\n\n3. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty--3.35\n\n4. Across the Wide Missouri--2.75\n\n5. Separate Tables--2.7\n\n6. Al Capone--2.5\n\n7. The Bad and the Beautiful--2.35\n\n8. Pat and Mike--2.1\n\n9. The Patsy --2.0\n\n10. Carrie--1.8\n\nJubal--1.8\n\nWill Penny--1.8\n\nThough he lived to the ripe old age of 92, Raksin had few scoring credits after the late 1960s, most notably Curtis Harrington’s period thriller What’s the Matter with Helen? and Nicholas Meyer’s high-profile nuclear holocaust TV movie The Day After, in which little of Raksin’s original music was ultimately used. He would go on to teach at USC and UCLA, and his memoir, The Bad and the Beautiful: My Life in a Golden Age of Film Music, was published after his death at the age of 92 in 2004.\n\n10F. LUIZ BONFA\n\nAGE: 45\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Selva Tragica\n\nHaving shared the scoring credit (with Antonio Carlos Jobim) on the 1959 classic Black Orpheus, Bonfa scored several films in the 1960s, but in the decades that followed had only two more feature scoring credits, Tercer Mundo (1973) and Prisoner of Rio (1988). He is better remembered for his non-film work, and he died in 2001 at the age of 78.\n\n9A. JOHN ADDISON\n\nAGE: 48\n\nBIRTHPLACE: West Chobham, England\n\n1 OSCAR\n\n1 GRAMMY\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEE: Tom Jones\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Delmer Daves, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Tony Richardson\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. Tom Jones--17\n\n2. Torn Curtain--6\n\n3. The Loved One--1.81\n\n4. A Fine Madness--1.8\n\n5. The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders--1.6\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: The Charge of the Light Brigade\n\nAddison earned a second Oscar nomination for 1972’s Sleuth, and worked in features through the mid-nineteen eighties, with such highlights as The Seven-per-cent Solution, A Bridge Too Far and Strange Invaders. He found even greater success in American television, scoring movies and miniseries, and receiving four Emmy nominations and the award for the pilot score to Murder, She Wrote, whose main theme is probably his most recognized composition. He died in Vermont in 1998, at the age of 78.\n\n9B. FRANK DE VOL\n\nAGE: 57\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Moundsville, West Virginia\n\n5 OSCAR NOMINATIONS\n\n1 EMMY NOMINATION\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEE: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Robert Aldrich\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner--25\n\n2. The Dirty Dozen--19\n\n3. Cat Ballou--9\n\n4. Lover Come Back--8\n\n5. Pillow Talk--7\n\n6. The Thrill of It All--5\n\n7. Good Neighbor Sam--4.95\n\n8. McLintock! --4.5\n\nThe Glass Bottom Boat--4.5\n\n10. What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? --4.0\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Krakatoa, East of Java\n\nWhile DeVol continued to work steadily through the mid ‘80s, he focused largely on episodic television, though he did continue to score most of Robert Aldrich’s features including his final film, 1980’s All the Marbles. DeVol received a new kind of pop culture fame with his wonderfully deadpan portrayal of bandleader “Happy Kyne” on Martin Mull’s talk show parody Fernwood Tonight. He died in 1999 at the age of 88.\n\n9C. KENYON HOPKINS\n\nAGE: 56\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Princeton, New Jersey\n\n1 EMMY NOMINATION\n\n1 GRAMMY NOMINATION\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEES: 12 Angry Men, The Hustler\n\nTYPECAST IN: Stage adaptations\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. Baby Doll--2\n\n2. This Property Is Condemned--1.8\n\n3. The Fugitive Kind--1.76\n\n4. Wild in the Country--1.75\n\n5. The Hustler--1.3\n\n6. Wild River--1.05\n\n7. 12 Angry Men--1.0\n\nConsidering how many major features he did at his peak (including two Best Picture nominees), Hopkins may be one of the least remembered of major composers from his era. His last major feature was 1969’s Downhill Racer, the feature directing debut of Michael Ritchie, and after that he focused on TV projects, serving as music supervisor for such series as The Immortal, Longstreet, Mannix, Mission: Impossible, The Odd Couple, The Young Lawyers and, most incongruously, The Brady Bunch. He died in 1983 at the age of 71.\n\n9D. FRANCIS LAI\n\nAGE: 36\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Nice, France\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Claude Lelouch\n\nTYPECAST IN: Romance\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. A Man and a Woman--5\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Hannibal Brooks, House of Cards, Life Love Death, Mayerling, Tender Moment\n\nLai had his biggest U.S. hit soon after with Love Story, which won him the 1970 Original Score Oscar in competition with such top composers as Goldsmith, Mancini and Newman. Despite the huge U.S. success of that film and its score, he has remained mostly a composer for European cinema, especially in partnership with his Man and a Woman director Claude Lelouch, with the team making literally dozens of films together -- most recently the brand new Chacun sa vie (Everyone's Life). He turned 85 this last April.\n\n9E. DAVID ROSE\n\nAGE: 58\n\nBIRTHPLACE: London, England\n\n2 OSCAR NOMINATIONS\n\n1 EMMY, 2 NOMINATIONS\n\n1 GRAMMY, 5 NOMINATIONS\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. Operation Petticoat--9\n\n2. Hombre--6\n\n3. Please Don’t Eat the Daisies--5\n\n4. Never Too Late--2\n\nHaving been the principal composer for Bonanza, Rose spent the later years of his scoring career as the music man for its star Michael Landon, receiving two Emmys and six nominations for his work on Little House on the Prairie, Father Murphy and Highway to Heaven. Rose died in 1990 at the age of 80; he had been married to his widow, Betty Bartholomew for more than 40 years, following marriages to Martha Raye and Judy Garland.\n\n9F. LAURENCE ROSENTHAL\n\nAGE: 41\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Detroit, Michigan\n\n1 OSCAR NOMINATION\n\n1 EMMY, 2 NOMINATIONS\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEE: Becket\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Peter Glenville\n\nTYPECAST IN: Stage adaptations\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. Becket--5\n\n2. The Comedians--2\n\n3. The Miracle Worker--1.6\n\n4. A Raisin in the Sun--1.1\n\n5. Requiem for a Heavyweight--1.0\n\nRosenthal would only earn one more Oscar nomination, for his adaptation score for Man of La Mancha, but he went on to write some of his best and most popular scores, including The Return of a Man Called Horse, The Island of Dr. Moreau and Clash of the Titans. While his work in features was consistently strong, he made an even bigger splash in television, receiving 13 Emmy nominations and winning the award seven times, including awards in three consecutive years -- the third for the original miniseries version of The Bourne Identity (with Richard Chamberlain in the role now permanently associated with Matt Damon) -- and three awards for his contribution to The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. Last November he celebrated his 90th birthday.\n\n9G. JOHNNY WILLIAMS\n\nAGE: 36\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Flushing, New York\n\n1 OSCAR NOMINATION\n\n2 EMMY NOMINATIONS\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Delbert Mann, Mark Robson\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1.

None But the Brave-- 2.0\n\nThe Rare Breed-- 2.0fd\n\n9. Gidget Goes to Rome--1.8\n\n10. I Passed for White--1.5\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Heidi [TV]\n\nOne could take up a whole column (at the very least) just updating what John Williams has been up to since 1968 -- it’s strange to think there actually was a time when he actually had only one Oscar nomination (for Valley of the Dolls). Suffice it to say, there is likely no film composer, past or present, who has written more themes that are recognizable to casual moviegoers – particularly Jaws, Star Wars, Superman, Darth Vader’s Theme, The Raiders March, E.T., Jurassic Park and Hedwig’s Theme. And in 2016 he became the first film composer to receive AFI’s Lifetime Achievement award. And, thank goodness, he’s still living and working at age 85, with Spielberg’s The Papers and Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi due at the end of this year.\n\n9H. OLIVER NELSON\n\nAGE: 36\n\nBIRTHPLACE: St. Louis, Missouri\n\n2 GRAMMY NOMINATIONS\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Death of a Gunfighter, Istanbul Express [TV]\n\nAfter a few feature projects, including Skullduggery and Zig Zag, Nelson worked largely in television for the remainder of his scoring career, composing the themes for The Six Million Dollar Man and Longstreet as well as many episode scores for Ironside and Night Gallery. He also served as the conductor/arranger for Gato Barbieri’s score to Last Tango in Paris, and continued recording jazz albums until his death from a heart attack at the age of 43, in 1975.\n\n8. BRONISLAU KAPER\n\nAGE: 66\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Warsaw, Poland\n\n1 OSCAR, 4 NOMINATIONS\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEES: Gaslight, Auntie Mame, Mutiny on the Bounty\n\nTYPECAST IN: Action-adventure\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1.

Forever, Darling--2.6\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov--2.6\n\n10. The Naked Spur--2.25\n\nThe Prodigal--2.25\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: A Flea in Her Ear\n\nA Flea in His Ear proved to be his last score credit, though he reportedly wrote a largely unused (and uncredited) score for 1972’s The Salzburg Connection. He did, however, make an additional contribution to film music history by reportedly telling his friend Roman Polanski that the original score for Chinatown was “a cancer on the film,” which helped lead to its replacement by Jerry Goldsmith’s classic contribution. Kaper died in 1983 at the age of 81.\n\n7A. SOL KAPLAN\n\nAGE: 49\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nTYPECAST IN: Drama\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1.

Kangaroo--1.25\n\n9. Destination Gobi--1.2\n\nTreasure of the Golden Condor--1.2\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Shadow on the Land [TV]\n\nKaplan would go on to score only a few more features, including 1972’s Born Free sequel Living Free, and 1979’s teen drama Over the Edge, directed by his son, Jonathan Kaplan (whose many other features include Heart Like a Wheel, The Accused and Love Field). He died in 1990 at the age of 71.\n\n7B. JOHNNY MANDEL\n\nAGE: 42\n\nBIRTHPLACE: New York, New York\n\n1 OSCAR, 2 NOMINATIONS\n\n2 GRAMMYS, 5 NOMINATIONS\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEE: The Russians Are Coming The Russians Are Coming\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1.

I Want to Live!--3.0\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Pretty Poison\n\nWhile Mandel may never have surpassed the commercial success of his Oscar-winning \"The Shadow of Your Smile\" from The Sandpiper, he went on to score some of his most critically acclaimed films, including M*A*S*H, The Last Detail and Being There, with M*A*S*H’s theme today probably even more widely recognized than \"Shadow of Your Smile.\" His last score was for the 1990 TV movie Kaleidoscope, from a Danielle Steel novel, and last November he celebrated his 91st birthday.\n\n7C. LEONARD ROSENMAN\n\nAGE: 44\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Brooklyn, New York\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Richard Fleischer\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. Fantastic Voyage--5.5\n\n2. East of Eden--5.0\n\n3.

Hell Is For Heroes--1.3\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Hellfighters\n\nRosenman would go on to particularly impressive success in the 1970s, winning back-to-back Oscars for his adaptation scores for Barry Lyndon and Bound for Glory (“I compose too,” he quipped during his second acceptance speech), as well as Emmys for Sybil and Friendly Fire. He received original score nominations for Cross Creek and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, and followed 1990’s RoboCop 2 with a handful of TV and indie feature scores. He died in 2008 at the age of 83.\n\n7D. LALO SCHIFRIN\n\nAGE: 36\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n1 OSCAR NOMINATION\n\n3 EMMY NOMINATIONS\n\n4 GRAMMYS, 9 NOMINATIONS\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Stuart Rosenberg\n\nTYPECAST IN: Thrillers\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1.

Way…Way Out--1.2\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: The Brotherhood, Bullitt, Coogan’s Bluff, Hell in the Pacific\n\nSchifrin would go on to receive five more Oscar nominations, including nods for his original scores for The Fox, Voyage of the Damned and The Amityville Horror. He had a lengthy collaboration with director Stuart Rosenberg, and his many box-office hits included four of the five Dirty Harry films and the Rush Hour trilogy, and at the same time remained impressively prolific as a jazz recording artist. His Mission: Impossible theme has remained an all-time classic, and recently celebrated his 85th birthday.\n\n6A. NEAL HEFTI\n\nAGE: 45\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Hastings, Nebraska\n\n1 EMMY NOMINATION\n\n1 GRAMMY, 6 NOMINATIONS\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Richard Quine, Gene Saks\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1.

P.J. --1.0\n\nHe scored a few more projects, and Michael Winner’s 1976 period comedy Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood was his final feature. His theme for the film The Odd Couple was reused for the long-running TV series (as well as two remake series, one still running) and became a TV classic. He died in 2008 at the age of 85.\n\n6B. BERNARD HERRMANN\n\nAGE: 57\n\nBIRTHPLACE: New York City, New York\n\n1 OSCAR, 3 NOMINATIONS\n\n1 EMMY NOMINATION\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEES: Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Francois Truffaut\n\nTYPECAST IN: Thrillers\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1.

The Man Who Knew Too Much--4.1\n\n8. Beneath the 12-Mile Reef--3.6\n\n9. Anna and the King of Siam--3.5\n\n10. Vertigo--3.2\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Twisted Nerve\n\nHerrmann would go on to score only a handful of features, but was at the start of a career resurgence with directors Larry Cohen, Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese when he died in his sleep the night before Christmas Eve 1975, hours after finishing scoring sessions for Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. Having only been Oscar-nominated three times during his life, he received posthumous nominations for his two final scores, Taxi Driver and Obsession, and in the three decades since his death, his reputation has soared. Directors like Scorsese, Tarantino and Van Sant have used his music prominently in their films, and for the current generation of cinephiles, he is almost certainly the most famous and respected of all Golden Age composers.\n\n6C. FRED KARLIN\n\nAGE: 32\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Chicago, Illinois\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Robert Mulligan\n\nTYPECAST IN: Comedy\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. Yours Mine and Ours--11\n\n2. Up the Down Staircase--5\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: The Stalking Moon\n\nKarlin would go on to receive four Oscar nominations for his songwriting, winning for 1970’s “For All We Know” (popularized by The Carpenters) from Lovers and Other Strangers. While he would score big screen hits like Westworld, he had even greater success on the small screen, winning the Emmy for The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman and receiving 10 other nominations. A dedicated film music historian, he wrote about the craft in his books Listening to Movies and On the Track, and produced an invaluable video documentary on Jerry Goldsmith. He died in 2004 at the age of 67.\n\n6D. JOHNNY GREEN\n\nAGE: 61\n\nBIRTHPLACE: New York, New York\n\n4 OSCARS, 12 NOMINATIONS\n\n1 GRAMMY, 3 NOMINATIONS\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEES: An American in Paris, West Side Story\n\nTYPECAST IN: Musicals\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1.

He died in 1989 at the age of 80. (Green’s ranking on this list was based on his asking price for original scores – his asking price for musicals was two and a half times as much).\n\n6E. IRWIN KOSTAL\n\nAGE: 57 [October 1 was actually his birthday]\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Chicago, Illinois\n\n2 OSCARS, 3 NOMINATIONS\n\n1 EMMY NOMINATION\n\n1 GRAMMY\n\nBEST PICTURE NOMINEES: West Side Story, Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music\n\nRELATIONSHIPS: Walt Disney Pictures\n\nTYPECAST IN: Musicals\n\nTOP BOX-OFFICE HITS:\n\n1. The Sound of Music--72\n\n2. Mary Poppins--31\n\n3. West Side Story--25\n\nWHAT’S NEXT: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\n\nKostal continued to be synonymous with big movie musicals, but after the record-breaking success of The Sound of Music, the genre suffered a slow death from bloat. In the 1970s he received nominations for his work on Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Pete’s Dragon, and his final feature credit was on 1978’s The Magic of Lassie, adapting original songs by the Sherman brothers. He died in 1994 at the age of 83. (Kostal’s ranking on this list was based on his asking price for original scores -- his asking price for musicals was 125 percent higher).\n\nHere is the list from Part One, with composers ranked by their asking price:\n\n11\n\nA.
