        "text": "William Grimshaw, Noted Historian\n\nand Immigrant to Philadelphia from Ireland\n\nWilliam was a descendant of the “Irish” Grimshaw line, which is described on a companion webpage. He was born in 1782, the eighth child of Nicholas and Mary (Wrigley) Grimshaw. In 1815 he and his family emigrated to Philadelphia, and he became a noted author of many history textbooks and other works. William and his first wife, Harriet, had 11 children, many of whom led their lives with distinction in their chosen areas of endeavor. After Harriet’s death, William married Maria DeLaCroix, and the couple had two more children, including Robert Grimshaw, a distinguished engineer. William died in Harrisburg, but his family subsequently had the grave moved to Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nContents\n\nWebpage Credit\n\nPhotograph of William Grimshaw Descendant Chart\n\nWilliam’s Appearance on Whitaker’s Descendant Chart\n\nBiographical Annotation in Appleton’s Cyclopaedia\n\nNaturalization Record for William\n\nLetter from William’s Daughter Charlotte to His Brother (Her Uncle), Robert\n\nBooks and Other Publications by William\n\nWilliam’s Reference Citations\n\nWilliam’s Biography As Recorded in His “Incidents Recalled”\n\nWilliam’s Illustrious Offspring\n\nWilliam Arthur Grimshaw, Successful Illinois Attorney\n\nJackson Grimshaw, Abe Lincoln Supporter\n\nHarriet (Grimshaw) and Benjamin Sellon\n\nArthur Harper Grimshaw, Civil War Colonel\n\nRobert E.

Some of his siblings are also shown.\n\nBiographical Annotation in Appleton’s Cyclopaedia\n\nApparently because of his success as an author, William Grimshaw was included in Appleton’s Cyclopaedia of American Biography2, published in 1888. The following citation was provided:\n\nGRIMSHAW, William, author, b. in Greencastle, Ireland, in 1782; d. in Philadelphia, Pa., in 1852. He emigrated to the United States in 1815, and lived many years in Philadelphia. Among his works were an “Etymological Dictionary” (Philadelphia, 1821); “Gentleman’s Lexicon,” and “Ladies Lexicon” (1829), “Merchants’ Law Book,” “Form Book,” “American Chesterfield,” “Life of Napoleon,” and school histories in England, France, Greece, the United States, Rome, South America, and Mexico, with questions and keys. He also published revised editions of Goldsmith’s histories of Rome and Greece, of Ramsay’s “Life of Washington,” and of Baine’s “History of the Wars Growing Out of the French Revolution.”\n\nNaturalization Record for William Grimshaw\n\nA record of William’s application for naturalization was published in Filby’s3 Philadelphia Naturalization Records (PNR) as indicated on another page on this website (entry no. 21.) The following information is given in the Index:\n\nWilliam appeared before the Court of Common Pleas (CP) in Philadelphia on June 3, 1820. His Country of Former Allegiance was “Great Britain and Ireland (GrBI).”\n\nThe PNR is an “index to … aliens from nearly 100 countries who applied for U.S. citizenship through the Philadelphia courts system from 1789 to 1880. The … index is a completely reset edition of . an eleven-volume index compiled about 1940 by the Work Projects Administration under the sponsorship of the Pennsylvania Historical Commission. The original WPA volume is generally considered to be one of the most important documents in the American naturalization and immigration archive…” (Filby3, p. xii.) The naturalization process was described in Filby3 (p. ix-x):\n\nA Brief Discussion of Citizenship Applications in the United States\n\nThe process of becoming a U.S. citizen is a lengthy one, and the information required at the various stages makes citizenship and naturalization records important documents to the genealogical researcher. First, the applicant needed to make a declaration of intention to become a citizen. Although the data required varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the declaration form usually contained the applicants name, age, place and possibly date of birth, allegiance, and date of declaration. Before 1866, declarations also included the date and place of arrival in the United States and place of embarkation. After 1866, the form usually gave a physical description (complexion, height, weight, color of eyes, identifying marks), current place of residence, last foreign address, name of ship, and port and date of entry.\n\nHaving filed the declaration, the applicant usually had a minimum two-year wait before naturalization; however, the laws pertaining to naturalization changed from time to time. From 1790 to 1795, the requirement for free, white aliens was residence of one year in a state and two in the United States. In 1795, the requirement was changed to a residency of five years in the United States. From 1798 to 1802, the requirement was fourteen-year residency in the United States and the declaration of intention had to be filed five years prior to naturalization. In 1802 the laws were again changed to one years residence in a state and five in the United States, with the declaration filed three years prior to naturalization. Except for a few minor changes, the five-year residency requirement remains to this day.\n\nIt is not known if William’s 1820 appearance was for filing his declaration of intention to become a citizen or for completing the naturalization process.\n\nLetter from William’s Daughter Charlotte to His Brother (Her Uncle), Robert\n\nHilary Tulloch’s records on William Grimshaw include a letter4 from his oldest daughter, Charlotte, to her uncle Robert, who was apparently living in Ireland. It is included below because it contains relevant and interesting family history information for William’s family. (The paragraphs have been introduced by the webpage author to improve readability. Thanks are again expressed to Hilary for making the letter available.)\n\nWilmington July 8 1858\n\nMy Dear Uncle\n\nCould you see me now you would not recognize the little child to whom you bade farewell. Years have brought some joy more sorrow, our dear Mother left us a helpless band of orphans but our beloved Father cared for us all, we were never rich, but we always had enough for a respectable appearance. First, my eldest Brother William went to the then far West: he prospered and was happy: years passed, trade suffered and, to relieve my dear Father, I came here to teach. Jackson joined William in the West, where he is rising to eminence in his profession. James, you know, has gone where sorrow comes not.\n\nOf our dear Father you always heard, for dearly did he prize your letters, they were a cordial to his spirit amidst many trials. God took away this best of Parents, my heart’s idol as with a stroke, three short weeks and we were left alone on earth. Days only add to the sorrow, I know he is happy but we have lost love and care which earth never can replace. I sometimes feel as if I could not live without his love and wisdom to guide and cheer. You have always seemed so like a friend even unknown that I wished to see you and love you for my dear Father’s sake. Oh! how he mourned when one of the loved ones was taken. I often begged him to visit you but the oft promised visit was delayed, you will meet where parting is unknown.\n\nCould you not write to me tell me of all my dear Parent’s relatives of yourself. Mrs. Smith often speaks of you. Dr Smith’s death under very afflicting circumstances crushed her once buoyant spirit; she has since lost two brothers, the last by an explosion of a very sad character. She has been a firm friend to us. My Sister Harriet is married and has five children; she lives near William Arthur and his wife. Isabel, Eliza, and myself live together. My dear Mother’s only sister is dead, her husband married again and they all live in Middletown Connecticut.\n\nYou know my Father married about four years before his death. I believe although his wife was not highly educated or refined she was affectionate and kind, and since my dear Father’s death I have visited her and been always received with affection. She had two children of her own. Robert, your namesake was 16 months old when our dear Father died: Mary was born about two months after, and never claimed a Father’s love. I named Mary for your Mother, of whom our dear Father always spoke with devoted love. Robert has lived with me since he was two years old, the last words my dear Father spoke were to commend him to my care and receive my promise that I would care for him, as my youngest Brother: he possesses bright talents and warm affection and, if rightly managed and educated, will be a credit to your name; he is now eight years old. I often speak to him of you and endeavour to make him worthy of you and of his Father.\n\nMany times I have thought of writing to you and giving you these accounts. Little Mary resides with her Mother in Camden, New Jersey: with the money my dear Father left her, she purchased a small frame house, and supports herself and another daughter, a very good girl, besides Mary, with the profits of plain sewing, which are very small; both children attend the Public school. Mary is very pretty and resembles my Father and brother Jackson; she is very delicate, …\n\n(plus 9 intervening sentences of a somewhat personal nature, which can be viewed at the Public Record Office Northern Ireland, PRONI, Reference No. T1116/52)\n\nI wish you would visit our country, you would admire the grand and beautiful scenery, the difference of manners would please you, but alas! our dear Father could not welcome you, his voice is silent in the grave. Tell me of all our dear relatives. I cannot remember my island home but my heart is with her, I am but little of an American. I would welcome the sight of my native land. May that God who rules all nations watch over and guard you, is the prayer of\n\nYour most affectionate niece Charlotte Grimshaw.\n\nWritten across is ‘ Ansd 8th Aug’\n\nBooks and Other Publications by William Grimshaw\n\nAs noted above, William was apparently a noteworthy and highly successful author of many books, mostly on history (Rome, England, France, South America, the U.S.), but also on the English language and other topics as well. A partial list of his publications is provided below, followed by a bibliography. He published many editions of several of his works, starting shortly after his arrival in the U.S. in 1815 and continuing to the time of his death in 1851.

During the American Civil War, he apparently raised “his own” regiment for the Union side in Delaware and commanded it through the course of the war. Additional detail on Arthur and his Civil Warrecords is given on a companion webpage.\n\nRobert E. Grimshaw, Noted American Mechanical Engineer\n\nRobert E. Grimshaw, the youngest son of William, became a renowned mechanical engineer. William died before Robert was two years old, and he was apparently raised by his aunt, Charlotte (see Charlotte’s letter to her Uncle Robert above.) Robert’s biography was published in the Who’s Who in New Jersey6 in 1939 as included in a companion webpage.\n\nJackson Grimshaw, Politician and Abe Lincoln Supporter\n\nJackson Grimshaw was born in Philadelphia in 1822, the son of William Grimshaw, noted historical author, and Harriet (Milligan) Grimshaw. After working for five years as an engineer for a railroad, he studied law and relocated to Pittsfield, Illinois, where he was a partner in a law firm with his older brother, William A. Grimshaw, for 14 years. He then moved to Quincy, Illinois, where he gained prominence as a capable lawyer and became politically active. He was among the influential group of politicians that initially persuaded Abraham Lincoln to run for the presidency. Although he won the post of Internal Revenue collector, he was disappointed in not receiving a judgeship in Kansas from Lincoln.\n\nWilliam Grimshaw’s Gravesite in Wilmington, Delaware\n\nWilliam Grimshaw, his first wife Harriett, and several other family members are buried at Old Swede’s Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware. The cemetery is associated with Holy Trinity (Old Swede’s) Church, which in now an Episcopalian church. William was originally buried in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but his grave was subsequently transported to this location by members of the family. Photos of the Grimshaw monument are shown below.\n\nWilliam Grimshaw’s inscription (and his wife, Harriett, and daughter Eliza Ann, born 1818) is on the left side of the view of the monument below. The inscriptions of his daughters Charlotte (born 1807) and Isabella (born 1810) are on the right side. Around the monument from William’s inscription to the left is the inscription of his son James (born 1816) and his wife and infant daughter. There is no inscription on the face opposite the side of William’s inscription.\n\nCloseup of William, Harriet Elizabeth, and Eliza A Grimshaw, their daughter.\n\nDetail of inscription of James Grimshaw, his wife Elizabeth, and their infant daughter, Harriet.\n\nInscriptions of Charlotte and Isabella Grimshaw.\n\nThe information and photos presented above were obtained during a visit to the gravesite by the website author in August 2010.
