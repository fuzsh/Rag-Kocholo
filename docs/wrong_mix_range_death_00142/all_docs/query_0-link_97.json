        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nYusuf Islam, aka Cat Stevens, is 75. The British singer-songwriter was born in London, England and began his folk-pop music career in 1967, with the debut album \"Matthew and Son,\" featuring the hit single of the same name. He’s known for a distinctive voice and introspective lyrics, often exploring themes of spirituality, personal reflection, and social issues. In the 70s, he changed his name to Yusuf Islam after a spiritual transformation and today releases music under the name “Yusuf/ Cat Stevens.” He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 and released his latest album, King of a Land, in June 2023.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1956 - Elvis Presley was termed \"the most controversial entertainer since Liberace\" by Billboard.

The song is the opening track on the album Abbey Road, and reached the top of the charts in the U.S. and peaked at No. 4 in the U.K. There are a few different theories on what the song is referring to - it has been speculated that each verse refers cryptically to one of the Beatles, or that Lennon was painting a sardonic self-portrait, and also that Lennon was inspired by Timothy Leary's campaign for governor of California against Ronald Reagan, which promptly ended when Leary was sent to prison for possession of marijuana.\n\n1969 Blind Faith, a group comprised of Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker and Ric Grech, release their self-titled debut album in the United States.\n\n1969 - The day after the Apollo 11 moon landing (the first time man walked on the moon), Duke Ellington performs a song he wrote for the occasion called \"Moon Maiden\" as part of ABC's coverage of the historic event.\n\n1970 - The Carpenters' \"(They Long To Be) Close To You\" hits #1.\n\n1971 - Carole King received a Gold record plaque for Tapestry, which featured \"It's Too Late,\" \"I Feel The Earth Move,\" \"You've Got A Friend\" and \"So Far Away.\"\n\n1973 - Jim Croce started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown.\" Croce was killed in a plane crash three months later.\n\n1973 - \"Mary Wilson Day\" is declared in Detroit in honor of The Supremes member.\n\n1976 - Cat Stevens' brother David gives him a copy of the Quran, leading him down a spiritual path that finds him converting to Islam the following year and changing his name to Yusuf Islam.\n\n1979 - Robert Palmer releases \"Bad Case of Loving You.\"\n\n1983 - Diana Ross plays a free concert in New York City's Central Park on a rainy day.

With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is one of the best-selling records of all time, and is the best-selling debut album of all time -- though the album wasn't popular at first. It wasn't until the year after it was released that it became a massive commercial success, after the band toured and received airplay with its huge singles \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" \"Sweet Child o' Mine,\" and \"Paradise City.\"\n\n1989 - Performing on the Club MTV tour at a stop in Bristol, Connecticut, Milli Vanilli's tracks went screwy when they tried to lip-synch to the song \"Girl You Know It's True\".
