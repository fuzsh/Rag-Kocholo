        "text": "A student of this university: I studied at the Moscow State Pedagogical University at the faculty foreign languages exactly one year and it was enough for me. I am writing only my personal impressions of this university. Now I am studying at another university and I have something to compare with. My acquaintance with the Moscow State Pedagogical University happened from the open day. And what should have repulsed me right away was the view of the KGF building on Vernadsky Avenue. But for some reason I was not pushed away. Inside, on the first floor, everything seems to be decent, as it seemed then. Later, during the admissions campaign, I went up to the 6th floor of the Faculty of Foreign Languages. To say that there has been no renovation for a long time is to say nothing. But by the way, the documents were received in a more or less respectable audience. I just didn't see other audiences then. I don’t know what motivated me and why I chose MSGU. Until now, I myself cannot answer this question. Probably, his experienced greatness and that it was the first and leading pedagogical university in the country. The key word here is \"was\". We, future students, came to the student meeting. How many unfounded words were said then, just such noodles on the ears. And about material support, and about large scholarships, and about an individual approach, and even about the fact that the university will try to provide each (!) student with a laptop if necessary. Naturally, this was all a lie. And by the way, the woman whom I told us about all the wonderful prospects I have never met at the university again.\n\nI paid little attention to the state of the university in the last paragraph, now I want to describe it in more detail. I was completely horrified by the condition of some of the auditoriums when we were cleaning. Huge holes in the linoleum, desks that only hold on to chewing gum and chairs that seem to have been brought from the trash heap. These are just some of the delights of the audience. The windows were apparently not replaced from the very construction of the building. Even opening them was scary, it seemed that they were about to fall on your head. And in winter a terrible draft was blowing from them. The most remarkable thing is the toilets, or rather the lack of them. Instead, there are holes in the floor. No, of course not everywhere, but the main toilets on the floors are the same, except for the first and second. There is no need to talk about the presence of toilet paper. Even in the KGF there are very \"wonderful\" elevators. They also, it seems, have not been changed since the 60s and 70s of the last century. It may happen that you get stuck and it will take a very long time to get you out of there. A small point in favor of the KGF is a large dining room and there is more than one there either. In general, there is where to eat. It is also very cool in physical education, especially the locker room that cannot be closed, so you either drag your bags into the gym, or the duty officer remains and sits with bags. But this also has a small plus, if you are sitting with bags, you will be counted as visiting a couple of physical training.\n\nAs for the state of the classrooms, I have already described, we are moving on to the organization and work of the dean's office, if you can call it \"work\". For the first time, I ran into a problem when I was getting a student. Most of my classmates received their numbers on September 5-7, but I only after half a month. Me and the other poor fellows stood in line for 4 hours, while the lady who was supposed to give them to us constantly left for lunch. The dean's office did not expel the girl from my group until December, although she did not appear for three months at the university. Then we had a gorgeous schedule. Firstly, the audiences did not correspond to reality, or two different subjects could be put into one audience, and whoever comes first, that is the audience. Secondly, 3-4 groups could be assigned to one seminar, in some rooms we could barely fit. Some had to practically sit in the corridor. Then one more of our \"entertainment\" was to look for the floor of a pair of chairs. The lectures were also fun. The whole stream was often put on them, these are 20 groups, and in each group from 16 people. It was such that you had to sit on the stairs or crowded so that it was difficult to write. Accordingly, due to such a large number of people, the teacher was no longer heard on the middle desks.\n\nNow for the next point. How the pairs pass and a few words about the teachers. I admit, not all the couples went so badly, they were quite okay. The main language pairs are in one group. Such as grammar, speech practice and phonetics. But the language practice itself is incredibly small. We spoke very little English. In other respects, it’s just as lucky with the teacher. Now about the teachers. Chvsto tyrants meet. For example, Anna Alexandrovna Tirskaya was my worst teacher. She's just a terrible teacher, she could scream, get nasty, she was constantly 20 minutes late. Insulting students is a common thing for her. I was constantly shaking in front of her pair. She once yelled at me for finding the wrong audience for her. Yes, we had to look for her audience for a couple, then call her so that she would deign to come down. She is one of the strongest phoneticians in the mpgu, but as a teacher and as a person, she is simply disgusting. Because of her, many students were expelled from the university. She just dumped them at the zhkzamena and on persdach and did not hesitate to offend them at the same time. She constantly examined our mental abilities, said that we were all wrong about the university. I don’t know who might like this approach to teaching. I simply did not perceive her, I had to hire a phonetics tutor, because I did not understand anything. She flunked me on the final test, but fortunately another teacher took the exam with us. I don't understand why such \"tactful\" teachers are allowed to work at all. There are also a couple of teachers from whom I was just shocked. But there are strong and adequate teachers in the MPGU. Only the point is that only \"meet\" and how lucky. There was a teacher who allowed himself to be 40 minutes late, and then generally said that we would not conduct lectures and seminars, because the Moscow State Pedagogical University did not pay him for it. Of course, teachers are also in a difficult situation at this university.\n\nI also like that now freshmen pay 195 thousand a year, and this is only for English, two languages ​​are even more expensive. At Moscow State Pedagogical University, students have an unspoken question: What is the money spent on? Obviously not for repairs.\n\nI would also like to tell a story about how I was expelled. I went through seven circles of hell. I could not be expelled for three months (!) I swore and fought. It's just scary to remember.\n\nI tried to paint everything to the maximum. These are the memories that this university left about itself. My advice to applicants. Think carefully before entering the Moscow State Pedagogical University. At least in foreign language. MSGU loves to recruit a lot of people, there can be 18 people in a group. Normal teaching is out of the question. Money leakage is also another unclear issue. I recommend that if you still want to go to Moscow State Pedagogical University, ask around 2-4 year students. Ask for anything that interests you. Better than a few people. Also, if you will definitely enter the Moscow State Pedagogical University, make acquaintances with people from different groups... This will help you in the future, you will exchange information, homework.\n\nI had such a bitter experience. And how glad I am that I still moved to another university. It's just heaven and earth!\n\nI support 88\n\nArtist name:\n\nFederal State Budgetary educational institution higher vocational education\"Moscow Pedagogical State University»\n\nLegal address:\n\nRussia 119991, Moscow, st.

Only two of them entered the TOP-10, and the first of them with an average USE score of 63.6 takes only the seventh position. And the rating is headed by the Chelyabinsk State Pedagogical University(66.4) followed by the Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University and the Russian State Pedagogical University. A.I. Herzen.\n\nThe general shift in emphasis towards the regions and some weakening of the positions of the capital and St. Petersburg universities, most likely, indicates a decrease in demand for pedagogical specialties in both capitals. At the same time, the general picture of admission and a fairly high density USE results, testifies to the relative equality in the level of training of applicants, which naturally affects the search for alternative options."
