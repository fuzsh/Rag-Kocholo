        "text": "What can I say, I'm always tempted by twisted Habsburg content. The first time I heard of Carlota of Mexico was actually during my visit to the empirial crypt in Vienna (a compulsory sight to see for historians and goths alike), where some previous visitor had lain down flowers at her grave, and I was intrigued enough to look her up. This BD masterly (if a bit conventionally) conveys the historical events that led her to the Mexican throne, but I was mostly delighted by the old-fashioned drawing style and colours. The cover gives a great example of the artists' skill and usage of shading, and I want more!\n\nThank you to netgalley and the publisher for a free e-book to review.\n\nI really enjoyed this and at the beginning I had my doubts, I didn't know much about the history of Charlotte or Carlotta of Mexico as she became known, but I found this really interesting and wanting to learn more about her life. It begins with her meeting and marrying Maximilian as a young woman and through her marriage we watch her mature and have to grow up quickly. I found the art work a little reminiscent of the style of the 70s or early 80s but it was still very pretty and I will be reading the next volume.\n\nA well-written historical graphic novel, Empress Charlotte describes the beginnings of Princess Charlotte, who goes from belonging to the royal family in Brussels to the empress of Mexico. The story describes her courtship with the Archduke of Austria, a man who seems shady but because she finds a good companionship and friendship with him, agrees to marry. Ultimately, their marriage turns sour, and the ongoing power struggles in Europe have them relegated to house arrest in their own home. As her domestic situation worsens, she strikes out to gain more political leverage and pushes them into a position where they could have more freedom. The story is basically her journey from being an innocent young princess to a cunning political player, to survive in the tension-filled world of European monarchy. The story also goes a little into the political situation of Mexico at this point, the way the US civil war intersected with these political intrigues happening on its own and other continents.\n\nThe artwork is heavily monochromatic and relies on the lineart to provide details and shading, with the occasional moody lighting. The indoor scenes usually rendered in pale brick shades, and much of the story takes place via context narration, and letter contents. Sadly, the latter often employed cursive scripts, which made it hard on the eyes to read, especially on screens (I imagine it would be marginally better in print, though). The characters are drawn realistically, and expressions lend to explaining the mood well enough. Ultimately, though, it is satisfactory enough and the story compelling enough to make me excited about future installments in this series.\n\n'Empress Charlotte: The Princess and the Archduke' by Fabien Nury with art by Matthieu Bonhomme is a historical fiction graphic novel set in the time of the Habsburgs.\n\nPrincess Charlotte loses her mother when she is young. When she is 16, she is sent out courting for a favorable marriage. She falls in love with archduke Maximillian of the Habsburg house. Charlotte doesn't realize that her new husband is on the outs with his family. They end up in Italy, and the marriage has its problems, including trying to provide an heir. When Maximillian is put on house arrest by his family, and things take a dire turn, Charlotte finds help with her family and the strength to take hold of her destiny.\n\nI liked this story of royals from another era. My favorite part is when Charlotte's family fears for her life and comes in to take charge. I liked the art in this book. I occasionally struggled with reading some of the lettering in letters between Charlotte and her father.\n\nI received a review copy of this graphic novel from Europe Comics and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for allowing me to review this graphic novel.\n\nThis is book one in a series which is a fictional retelling of the story of Carlota of Mexico.\n\nPrincess Charlotte was the only daughter of Leopold I, King of Belgium, by his second wife, Louise of Orl√©ans. At the age of 16 she is courted by Archduke Maximilian of the House of Habsburg and they get married. At first they are happy but the marriage becomes increasingly unhappy as problems begin to develop in Maximilian's political life. Charlotte's family eventually intervene and try to help her but the marriage never returns to the happier early days.\n\nThen an opportunity arises. When Charlotte realises that there is a chance she and her husband could be sent to Mexico as emperor and empress she does all that she can to make sure those plans succeed because she thinks that becoming Empress of Mexico will help save and strengthen her relationship with Maximilian, and give her freedom from the political restrictions that have been placed on their lives.\n\nThis first book focuses on her courtship and marriage to the Archduke and how things suddenly become quite joyless. Charlotte is isolated and neglected by the Archduke but she survives these difficulties with the help of her family. When Mexico beckons her family are against the idea but Charlotte yearns for this unknown land and a new beginning.\n\nThis is an interesting story and it is really well drawn and told in an engaging way. Charlotte isnt a familiar historical figure for me and so this was an opportunity to learn more. It is a very interesting story of politics, manipulation and colonisation.\n\nCharlotte is actually quite a strong woman who learns how to survive at a time when women had very few rights of their own. She manages to respond to personal and political difficulties in a world of political intrigue and manipulation, and she subverts circumstances in order to get what she wants. This gave me a taste of this historical episode in the history of Europe and of Mexico and I wanted to know more about the factual history after reading this.\n\nGreat art and a fascinating story.\n\nCopy provided by Europe Comics via Netgalley in exchange for an unbiased review.\n\nEmpress Charlotte is an enjoyable historical graphic novel detailing life in the 1860s for European royalty. Our protagonist is a sheltered princess, daughter of Leopold the 1 of Belgium. The story follows her as she deals with her husband's shortcomings and travails within the political arena of not only Europe but the world.\n\nStory: Charlotte is drawn to one of her suitors: Maximillian, second son in the powerful Hapsburg dynasty. His direct and forthright manner appeals to her and soon a marriage is confirmed. But Maximillian lives in the shadow of his illustrious emperor brother - a brother who controls his fate completely. Without an heir and at the whim of Franz Joseph 1, Max and Charlotte are flung around the world - first to Venice as an Archduke position is granted and then eventually they will make their way to Mexico.\n\nThe story of Charlotte and Max is quite tragic but it is also a fascinating chapter in history; after all, it would be Max's brother who was instrumental in the domino effect that led to World War 1. But this novelization, which ends at the couple's move to Mexico, is all seen through Charlotte's eyes. She has a husband with faults - the 'diluted' end of the Hapsburgs, as he is called. And so she has to learn to maneuver the political landscape in order to make up for her husband.\n\nThe artwork reminds me of the clean work of 1940s - similar to Bazooka comics but with a serious subject matter. It's clean and bright but somewhat old fashioned.\n\nIn all, I love to read historical graphic novels. The author stays true to the facts but also creates characters and situations in order to flesh out the story. Charlotte may or may not have been as canny as presented; but it is a rewarding read all the same. Reviewed from an advance reader copy provided by the publisher."
