        "text": "High End Productions, the production company founded by Dr. Herbert Kloiber and Constantin Film in the summer of 2021, is developing a series about the tragic life of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (b. 1832 in Vienna, d. 1867 in Querétaro) and his wife, Charlotte of Belgium (who would become Carlota of Mexico), together with the internationally renowned novelist and screenwriter William Boyd (Spy City).\n\nFilming for the four-part miniseries “Maximilian and Carlota” is scheduled to start in the late summer of 2022. The series will be made at original locations in Austria, Northern Italy, France and Mexico.\n\nThe budget for the European-Mexican co-production is estimated to reach 20 million US$.\n\n“Maximilian and Carlota” tells the dramatic story of the young Hapsburg and his Belgian princess, who allowed themselves to be persuaded by Napoleon III to sail to the other end of the world in 1864 to do justice to both their own progressive ideals and the political interests of the major European powers as rulers of the Mexican people. The emphasis is on the personal fates of the young imperial couple, who were used as political pawns in European colonial politics.\n\nDr. Herbert G. Kloiber: “I’ve been intrigued with the story of Kaiser Franz Josef’s brother, who was two years younger, for more than 30 years. As a quick-witted political liberal, he was always perceived as a threat by the Viennese Court. For this reason, after first being sent to Milan and Trieste, he was destined to seek his fortune in Mexico, where his life ended tragically after nearly three years at the tender age of 35. I have made several deep forays into the literature and history of these characters. My fascination with them has stayed with me to this day and that’s why I am particularly happy that this project is about to become a reality.”\n\nAbout High End Productions\n\nThe film and television production company HIGH END PRODUCTIONS was founded by Herbert G. Kloiber and Constantin Film in 2021 with the aim of producing premium European series for the international European market.
