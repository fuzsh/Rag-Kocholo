        "text": "Hon. William H. Seward, Secretary of State, &c.\n\n[Page 753]\n\nThe Memorial Diplomatique gives a long account of the reception of the Mexican deputation at Miramar on Sunday. As the archduke always throws open his park to the public on holidays, an immense crowd collected to witness the arrival of the procession. The account says:\n\n“Four carriages belonging to his imperial highness, preceded by outriders, went to convey the deputation from the hotel where they had lodged at the expense of the archduke. The deputation was composed of M. Gutierrez de Estrada, the president; Colonel Velasquez de Leon, ex-minister; M. Aguilar, ex-chargé d’affaires; General Woll; M. Esandon, banker; and M. Landa, merchant. A number of eminent Mexicans, among whom were M Arrangoiz, ex-minister of finance; M. Murphy, formerly Mexican envoy at London; Colonel Fatio, M. Gutierrez de Estrada, jun., with several generals, colonels, and other officers, accompanied the deputation. All were in full uniform, as were also the officers of the household of the archduke, aides-de-camp, and the chamberlains. The deputation, after being received by Count Zichy, who filled the functions of grand master of the household of his imperial highness, were introduced into the grand drawing-room, into which the Archduke Maximilian, wearing the uniform of an Austrian vice-admiral, immediately afterwards entered. The French and Belgian ministers in Austria were present at the solemnity, M. Gutierrez de Estrada then delivered a speech in the Spanish language expressing the joy felt by the Mexican deputation in finding themselves in presence of his imperial highness; they had come in the name of the imperial regency to announce that the vote of the notables which had conferred the crown on him is henceforth ratified by the enthusiastic adhesion of the immense majority of the country; the unanimous acclamation of the notables of Mexico, of the municipal authorities, and of the popular corporations, has become a truly national vote.”\n\nThe archduke then made the reply which has been transmitted by telegram. The account then goes on to say:\n\n“As soon as the archduke had uttered the last word, the deputation and all the Mexicans present acclaimed their new sovereign by crying out three times: ‘God save the emperor Maximilian I.’ ‘God save the empress Charlotte!’ At the same instant, salutes\n\nof artillery, fired from the bastions of the castle, announced to the public the accession of the Archduke Maximilian to the throne of Mexico, and were immediately followed by other salutes from the port and town of Trieste. Then M. Gutierrez de Estrada, as president of the deputation, returned thanks to his majesty for his definitive acceptance of the Mexican crown. He said:\n\n“‘Sire, this complete and absolute acceptation on the part of your majesty is the prelude of our happiness; it is the consecration of the salvation of Mexico, of its approaching regeneration, of its future greatness. Every year, on this day, our children will offer up their thanksgivings to heaven in gratitude for our miraculous deliverance. As for us, sire, there remains a last duty to perform, and that is to lay at your feet our love, our gratitude, and the homage of our fidelity!’\n\n“On saying those words the president of the deputation bent his knee and kissed the hand of the new sovereign according to Spanish custom, as a mark of homage. His example was followed by all the Mexicans present. A proces-verbal of the acceptance of the crown of Mexico having been drawn up, the emperor Maximilian first affixed his signature to it, after which the members of the deputation did the same, and lastly the notable Mexicans. That ceremony having been accomplished, the deputation proceeded into the apartments of the Princess Charlotte, whom they also proclaimed, and rendered homage to her in the same manner. While those things were taking place at Miramar, the news of the proclamation of the emperor of Mexico had already reached Trieste, and the bishop had a solemn Te Deum of thanksgiving celebrated in the cathedral of San Giusto, at which all the authorities of the town were present. Salutes from the batteries were fired at the same time. On the same day M. Zelasques de Leon, minister without portfolio, and General Woll, chief of the military household, took possession of their respective posts near the person of the emperor. In the evening there was to be a grand dinner at Miramar, when the new emperor was to appear for the first time in the uniform of a Mexican lieutenant general, modified on the model of the French army. His majesty Maximilian I will also wear the insignia of the order of the Virgin of Guadalupa and of the national order of Mexico. A grand representation and a full-dress ball are to be given at the theatre at Trieste by the municipality.”\n\nThe same journal likewise gives some information as to the settlement of the difference which has arisen concerning the Archduke Maximilian’s position in the reigning family in Austria. It says:\n\n“To avoid dynastic quarrels and obviate the partition of the patrimonial property of the house of Austria, a family law imposes on every archduchess contracting marriage the obligation of signing an act of renunciation. By this engagement she undertakes not to raise for herself or for her descendants of either sex any pretensions to the eventual succession to [Page 754] the throne, nor to any participation in either the endowments raised on the patrimonial property or the inheritances which might fall in ab intestato. The creation of the patrimonial property dates from the reign of Maria Theresa; a considerable portion of the family property was set aside for the extraordinary requirements of the different members of the family. The Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Duke of Modena, for example, now receive from that source incomes which could not figure on the budget of the state. Until now these acts of renunciation had only occurred on the marriage of archduchesses. The acceptation of a foreign crown by an archduke is a fact without precedent in the annals of the house of Hapsburg. Was it advisable to subject the archduke to the above-mentioned law? A family council, which assembled during the last stay of the archduke in Vienna, took the question into consideration. Different considerations caused the majority of its members to decide in the affirmative The Archduke Maximilian is the first agnate. As such, if (which Heaven forbid) the Emperor Francis Joseph should die without a male heir, he would be called on by right to the succession to the throne. There was so little time after the return of the archduke to Vienna from Brussels, where he received the final vote of the Mexican nation, that it was not possible to make all the family arrangements before the time first fixed for receiving the deputation. He was therefore called on to give his adhesion to a copy of the acts of renunciation which the archduchesses usually signed previously to their marriage, and which had always hitherto remained in the same, form. In the precipitation which circumstances rendered necessary, the great difference between an archduke accepting a foreign crown and an archduchess marrying a foreign prince had been overlooked. Every princess by her marriage ceases to belong to the imperial family, and loses her quality of agnate to such an extent that her heirs are only entitled to the title of cognates. The Archduke Maximilian, on the contrary, still retained his title of first agnate, after accepting the sceptre of Montezuma. This consideration justifies the objections which the archduke raised against the document submitted for his signature. Negotiations were found necessary to bring matters to an arrangement. As regards the former, the wording of the act has been completely changed, in order not only to remove whatever might wound the prince’s feelings, but also to mention the spontaneousness of his resolution. As regards the substance, the prince, having firmly resolved to devote himself to the destinies of the people which has chosen him, renounces for himself and his heirs, of both sexes, all right to the eventual succession to the throne of Austria so long as the new Mexican dynasty shall continue to reign. The renunciation is therefore not absolute. In declaring that the effects of his renunciation will continue so long as his dynasty shall reign, he implicitly deprives himself of the right of abdicating, except under the pressure of causes independent of his will. He also engages to respect accomplished facts in the interior of the Austrian monarchy. After leaving, if during his absence one of his brothers should be called on to succeed to the throne, he would recognize him as legitimate sovereign. We have no need to point out the extent of the concession at the point of view of Mexican interests. But that is not all: the archduke has made other sacrifices; he has abandoned the half of his appenage, and the whole of his rights of succession ab intestato. The future empress, as archduchess, received a sum of 20,000 florins (50,000 fr.) as pin money; wishing to join in the disinterestedness of her august husband, she has also renounced that income. Finally, the difficulties of which we have just pointed out the origin and the conclusion will have, on the whole, only served to place more in relief the noble and generous character of the archduke.”\n\nThe late proceedings at Miramar and the acceptation of the Mexican throne by the Archduke Maximilian are remarked on by several of the Paris journals, which seem to draw a long breath of satisfaction at finding this apparently interminable affair at last brought to a close. The Constitutionnel has the subjoined observations:\n\n“Every one is well aware to what a condition anarchy, under the form of a republic, had reduced Mexico. Both France and Europe knew only too well the deplorable state, as far as concerns both her material and her moral interests, into which that unfortunate country had fallen, in consequence of the ephemeral and spoliating governments, scarcely recognized at home and despised abroad. What is less known is that Mexico, already despoiled of half her territory, was the sure and speedy conquest of the United States. The word conquest, however, is too noble; for Mexico was put up to the highest bidder. If the disgraceful contract had been realized, the consequences of it would have been incalculable; the Latin races would have received a check from which they would with difficulty have recovered. The principles of civilization, which constitute our moral influence in the world, would have been deeply interfered with; that is the idea which the Emperor Napoleon III expressed with extraordinary energy in his letter to the commander-in-chief of the French expedition. Mexico, by the re-establishment of the monarchy, returns into her traditional path, and again finds the true conditions of order and prosperity without sacrificing anything of her independence. What a noble mission for the young prince who accepts it so boldly, and comprehends it so well! France will thus have once more merited [Page 755] well from civilization. Once more short-sighted politicians will have been in the wrong, and, thanks to the great prudence which presides over our destinies, and to that perseverance which triumphs over obstacles and marches forward to its object with admirable calmness, this regeneration of Mexico which is being prepared will be one of the noblest pages of our civilizing mission in the world.”\n\nThe France also has some remarks on the same subject, the following being an extract:\n\n“The acceptance of the throne of Mexico by the Archduke Maximilian is for France a complete solution. Her task is finished. Her army will now return home in succession, with the prestige of a fresh glory and the consciousness of having performed one of the most considerable works of the present age. The expenses which that great expedition has entailed are about to be reimbursed with all the legitimate indemnities that French subjects can claim. We have in the face of history the honor of having constituted, alone, in spite of the desertion of our allies, and notwithstanding the difficulties and perils of the undertaking, in the regions of Central America, an empire, the stability of which is important to the interests of the whole world. It is not only a triumph for the French flag, but also for our principles. The Mexican empire is established on the basis of popular suffrage, which is, in the new right of which France is the expression, the only legitimate foundation of governments. It is also a triumph for that great policy which occupies itself before all with the general balance of power of modern nations, and which, in establishing in Mexico a strong, national, and regular government there, defends at once the interests of Europe and those of all the nationalities of South America. Lastly, French interests must there find guarantees and particular advantages, which cannot fail to excite attention. There has been created on the other side of the Atlantic, by the victories of our soldiers, an empire which owes its existence to us; which the bonds of the most cordial friendship and of the most legitimate gratitude must unite to us; which will give fresh strength and the straightforward influence of our policy in the New World, and open the unexplored treasures of its vast territory to French commerce and industry. The dignified and elevated speech delivered by the new emperor, on receiving the Mexican deputation, proves how highly he appreciates and how much he desires to second the generous views of France. He twice expressed, in the warmest terms, his deep gratitude and his lively sympathy for the sovereign whose firm policy has conquered for him a powerful throne. The work of France has terminated. That of the emperor Maximilian now begins.”\n\nThe Nation expresses itself in these terms:\n\n“There is above all a fact which ought to be placed in the strongest light. In accepting the throne of Mexico, in virtue of popular right, the Archduke Maximilian renders to that source of authority a striking homage, which is the more precious that it emanates from a Hapsburg, and a member of that dynasty which thus far has the most openly disdained and outraged the principle of national sovereignty. We are about to witness the strange spectacle of two brothers, one of whom in Europe overrides that principle of nationality from which the other in Mexico demands the consecration of his sovereign power. We shall, no doubt, be permitted to invoke this precedent when we are contending against the policy of Austria in Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. The example of Maximilian I promises, besides, other arguments to the defenders of liberal causes. The prince proposes to inaugurate a constitutional régime which will soon replace, in his hands, the constituent power which has provisionally devolved on him. The fact must not be concealed that in a country disordered and ravaged by civil war the reign of liberty will be difficult to establish; in such a régime is, however, the only hope of safety. A system of government which has been preceded by a foreign rule should more than any other invigorate and strengthen itself by the employment of the national resources. An abuse of power could only give the prince a temporary authority; by a liberal government only can be effected a reconciliation and a pacification of all the opposing elements by which Mexico is disturbed. Arbitrary power will, besides, not be easily implanted in a country which has thrown off the yoke of its dictatorships, and which has before it, around it, and everywhere, the example of nations governing themselves and prospering by liberty.”\n\n“Letters from Vienna,” says the Patrie, “state that the parting of the Emperor from his brother, the Archduke Maximilian, was rather cool. The idea of a Mexican empire with an Austrian prince as sovereign met with decided resistance, up to the very last moment, in the official circles of the Austrian capital. The firmness of character of the archduke alone was able to triumph over that opposition, and now that the uselessness of all those efforts has been proved, the watchword in the regions of Vienna is: ‘Mexico and its emperor are strangers to Austria and her interests.’”\n\nThe Emperor of Mexico.—A telegram from Trieste to-day informs us that his Majesty is now much better, and intends to leave Miramar on Thursday next.—(Globe.)\n\nThe future empress of Mexico has just turned author, and issued privately “Souvenirs de Voyage à bord de la Fantasie,” and “Un Hiver dans l’Isle de Madère.”—(Reader.)"
