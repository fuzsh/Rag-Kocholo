Maximiliano was an archduke of Austria and the commander-in-chief of the Austrian Navy, but in 1859 he agreed to sacrifice his claims to European titles in order to accept an invitation to become the new Emperor of Mexico. In a six-year war, Maximiliano's royalists and the French Army were forced out of Mexico by Benito Juarez's liberal rebels, and he was executed by firing squad.\n\nBiography[]"
