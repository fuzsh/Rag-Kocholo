        "text": "Brooke Kamke began her career in nonprofits with the goal of helping people through healthcare. Originally from Ohio, she earned a B.A. in Biology from Miami University and moved to Atlanta. With a passion for quality and improvement, she added a Masters in Public Health from Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health and spent fifteen years in various roles at Emory Healthcare as well as two years as an Advisor with Press Ganey Associates.\n\nBrooke and her husband, Chad, are also the lucky parents of two amazing children. Their oldest was diagnosed with dyslexia in the third grade which proved to be a challenging and ultimately life-changing experience for their family. In supporting her son, Brooke studied dyslexia, navigated the education system, and found a place for him at The Schenck School. She soon transitioned from her role as Director of Quality and Patient Safety at Emory University Hospital to manage the school’s outreach arm, ReadSource.\n\nAll of these experiences led Brooke to Giving Kitchen. With a background in operations of both large, well-established organizations as well as smaller startups, she is thrilled to join Giving Kitchen as COO. When she’s not working, Brooke enjoys traveling with her family, playing with their two poodles, painting watercolors, and hanging out with friends and neighbors in Oakhurst."
