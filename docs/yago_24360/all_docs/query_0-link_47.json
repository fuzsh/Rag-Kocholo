        "text": "Alrighty, today (and it didn't take 6 months), we learned that Martin is paying alimony to wife #1 and #2 and wife #3 (from Pine Valley) is paying him alimony at $50K/month (ok, but seems an absurd amount; must be a story there). Therefore, that's why Marty doesn't want to get married again. Now let's put the shoe on the other foot (Lucy). IF she were getting $50K/month, at this stage of her life would she really give it up to be a MRS. ______ again? I can tell you this my friends, I wouldn't!! Live together, travel together, sleep together, do whatever together, but give up $50K/month.........no way, no way!!!!\n\nNote to those who also watched AMC: Maybe you guys are right. Maybe rich wife #3 was the infamous Erica Kane/Susan Lucci. Any other very rich women of a certain age who reside in Pine Valley who could have been shrewed, blah, blah wife #3?\n\nHmmm, Lucy having dinner with Montgomery Jackson. Will go on the premise he isn't married? Or is he a player with a wife, etc?\n\nOh for the love of (you know who): Watching Shasha go out of control because of dastardly Dr. Shrink and Gladys........'Nuff, I say; way 'nuff already. Now being arrested for the (I think) blouse \"theft\". Nuff, Nuff, Nuff P.S.: Isn't that a job for a police officer; not a detective? Just sayin...............\n\nIt really sickened me to see Sasha all strung, out even though I know they may have needed to accommodate the character due to her pregnancy. They could have had temporarily recast her again.\n\nI really can't stand Gladys. Piece of 💩 that she is. I hope she goes to jail and they throw away the key! Maybe when Sasha discovers what Gladys is doing to her; she can kill her when she's under the influence of the drug. Maybe a double murder?\n\nNo one could blame her if that happened.\n\nThats a storyline I could get behind!\n\nThat doctor reminds me of a sinister Ken Jennings!\n\nDon't you just love how everyone is hanging at The Savoy while Curtis is fighting for his life? Where's the PCPD when you need them to raid an after hours place. This would be a great time to raid the joint\n\nI wish Missy Wu would hang Cody on hook, the way \"Sunny\" did to Dex. 😝 I don't like this Cody guy at all. And I don't want him to suddenly be a hero.\n\nYesterday's episode 👎\n\nGH Speculation: Portia Has a New Secret About Trina\n\nAlina Adams\n\nHow will this affect Curtis Ashford’s GH recovery?\n\nGH spoilers promise a continuing medical crisis for Curtis. Usually, General Hospital patients wake up from a coma either with amnesia or pregnancy. Here’s hoping that won’t be the case for Curtis. But you never want to let a good medical crisis go to waste! So before Curtis makes a full, handsome as ever recovery, let’s throw a little wrinkle into the process.\n\nGH Spoilers Speculation\n\nPoor, suffering Curtis needs a blood transfusion. Let’s say Marshall can’t do it because he still has medication in his system. And Aunt Stella can’t do it because…uhm…she’s anemic. So that leaves his newfound daughter, Trina. (And the entire blood bank, but let’s pretend it’s closed for remodeling.)\n\nGeneral Hospital Plot Twist\n\nWe know that Trina is Curtis’s biological daughter because there just was a paternity test. And those never go wrong at GH. Except that, when it comes time to donate, Trina…isn’t a match. Oops. Portia gets the results. She realizes what it means. But she decides to keep the latest development a secret.\n\nGH Spoilers: Keeping the Peace\n\nPortia and Curtis are married now. He’s so happy to be a family with their daughter. That is, after he left Portia for lying to him, kissed Jordan, then decided to return to his wife, after all. That was already a lot of newlywed drama. Portia doesn’t want to go back to those days.Taggert's heart has already been broken. The damage is done. Why go back to that heartbreak? Better to leave things the way they are. Why rock the boat?\n\nCurtis Ashford: Reason to Live\n\nWe can’t blame Portia for assuming that Curtis wouldn’t want to live just for her. Heck, he was barely willing to avoid kissing his ex-wife just for her. But he should be willing to live for Trina. Portia is a doctor. She knows that’s how medical science works. So, really, she’s doing this for Curtis. Just like always.\n\nsource: soaphub\n\n\"And suddenly you just know it's time to start something newAnd trust the magic of Beginnings...\"\n\nI'm back in town, I hope everyone has had a good week. I look forward to catching up on this week's shows over the weekend.\n\nTad Martin was never married to Erica Kane but they were friends. He was married six times, most famously to Dixie Cooney (a West Virginia girl!). He was also married to Brooke English, niece of rich Pine Valley socialite Phoebe Tyler. Brooke was also married to the rich Adam Chandler, as was Erica Kane. Brooke would be rich enough to pay big alimony to the poorer Tad. Erica and Brooke were big rivals and also were both married to Tom Cudahy.\n\nTad was married to four other women over the years, a lot to choose from for alimony, lol. Love Tad the Cad. He earned that name wooing both Liza Colby and her mother, Marion, as previously mentioned. He was SO handsome.\n\nHe was more or less a gigolo to Marion, but he was actually a fairly good guy most of the time. He and his sister Jenny lived hand to mouth and did what they had to do to survive early on, as I remember it."
