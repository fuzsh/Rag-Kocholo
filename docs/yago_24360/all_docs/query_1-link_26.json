        "text": "On All My Children, Adam Chandler (David Canary) had an on again and off again love affair and relationship with Brooke English (Julia Barr). Meanwhile, Stuart Chandler (David Canary) fell madly in love with the often times infuriating Marian Colby (Jennifer Bassey)\n\nNow the two women who played many scenes and spent much time with the late David Canary have come forward, and shared statements on the passing of this icon. Canary died back on November 16th, but news of his death made headlines just a few days ago prior to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.\n\nDaytime Emmy winner, Julia Barr told SoapSheKnows: “David Canary was my TV soul mate! I could not have asked for anything more in an actor or a fellow human being. He was the essence of kindness, a gentleman and my years of playing ‘Brooke’ to his ‘Adam’ were a joy! We were all blessed to have him in our lives.”\n\nJennifer Bassey tweeted her sentiments: “The best of the best is gone. David Canary, great actor, terrific gentleman, kind, considerate and funny. I will always miss him. So sad. ”\n\nSo, what did you think of Julia and Jennifer’s posts on the death of David Canary? Did you want Adam to end up with Brooke, and Stuart with Marian? Who do you feel was Canary’s best all-time love interest on AMC? Comment below!\n\nKelly Ripa is now officially a Disney Legend! The morning talk show host and former All My Children star (ex-Hayley Vaughan Santos) received the honor over the weekend at the D23 event in Anaheim, California, and the home of Disneyland.\n\nThe ‘legend’ honors goes to those individuals who have significantly influenced the Walt Disney Company. Ripa received the recognition for her work in television over her three-decade career, beginning with All My Children, followed by close to a quarter-century of hosting Live! You can catch the ceremonies as they begin to stream on Monday, August 12th on DisneyPlus.\n\nRyan Seacrest presented Ripa with the honors, marking a reunion of the two who co-hosted Live! together for six seasons, before Seacrest made the decision to move back to the West Coast full-time (the talk show is shot in New York City). Upon Seacrest’s exit, Ripa’s real-life husband and former AMC co-star Mark Consuelos, (ex-Mateo Santos) took over the co-hosting gig and the ratings have seen an impressive increase ever since.\n\nTaking to the podium to accept her honoes, Kelly shared, “Thank you so much, and Ryan, thank you from the bottom of my heart.” She joked, “I’m just so glad that you finally found something else to host.”\n\nRipa continued, “This feels surreal for me, and I want to thank Bob Iger (CEO, Walt Disney Company) for this truly magical experience.” As she spoke to the cameras and the audience she also remarked, “I know what you’re thinking. Why her ? What has she ever done?”\n\nKelly said proudly that she has been with the same company for 34 years, “which my great good fortune. I owe everything to Disney. Not only my career, but my entire immediate family.”\n\n“I met my smokin’ hot husband (Mark Consuelos) on the set of All My Children 30 years ago, and from there we made our own three children (Lola, Michael and Joaquin) right backstage in the Disney Labs.” In jest, Kelly added, “HR has asked me to remind everyone of their strict, no hidden Mickey policy. Being a ‘Disney legend’ is just the pixie dust on top of the Sundae. Thank you so very much, so honored.”\n\nTaking to Ripa’s Instagram post on the event were Mark Consuelos, himself, who said, “The woman, the myth, the Disney Legend!!! Proud of you babe!!!!” In addition, former on-screen sister-in-law, now GH’s Natalia, Eva LaRue (ex-Maria, All My Children) expressed, “OH, MA, GAWD- Amazing! Congratulations 😍😍😍😍🎉🎉🎉🎉”\n\nThe 2024 Disney Legend honorees also included: Miley Cyrus, Angela Bassett, Colleen Atwood, Martha Blanding, James L. Brooks, James Cameron, Jamie Lee Curtis, Steve Ditko, Harrison Ford, Mark Henn, Frank Oz, Joe Rohde and John Williams.\n\nWhat do you think about Kelly Ripa becoming a Disney Legend? Comment below.\n\nThe soap opera world has been in mourning over the weekend, with the news of the death of Esta TerBlanche, who played Gillian Andrassy Lavery on ABC’s All My Children from 1997-2001.\n\nEsta’s leading man during her run in Pine Valley was Cameron Mathison (ex-Ryan Lavery, AMC now, Drew Quartermaine, GH). The love story of Ryan and Gillian was complex. He believed that Gillian was a wealthy princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and the two were eventually married. Later, Gillian was killed when TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to Michael Fairman TV on Sunday, Mathison expressed, “Esta was somebody very, very close to my heart. We both came to New York around the same time and basically started and learned acting together. Ryan and Gillian are such a beautiful sweet couple … and hold a very, very special place in my heart.”\n\nSpeaking on TerBlanche’s love of animals and reconnecting with her in 2023, Cameron recounted, “Esta was literally one of the sweetest kindest people I’ve eve met. When she heard that my dog (Red) was sick and paralyzed last year, she volunteered to take him for a few days to try to care for him to give me a break.
