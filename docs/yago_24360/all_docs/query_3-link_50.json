        "text": "Stunning actress Brooke Shields, who was married to Andre Agassi from 1997 to 1999, has revealed some inside information about her marriage to the tennis star.\n\nBrooke, as an actress, had to play some roles that Agassi didn't always like, and one of those came as she appeared in 'Friends', in a rather funny role.\n\n\"The day after I got married I already knew I was wrong. I loved Andre, but I wasn't sure I wanted the life we led,\" Brooke Shields came to realise in her book.\n\nBrooke Shields licked Matt LeBlanc's fingers in 'Friends': the scene that sparked Agassi's anger\n\nIn an interview with 'The New Yorker' magazine, the actress, who is promoting her autobiographical documentary, said that Agassi \"destroyed all his trophies\" in a fit of jealous fury over a scene she had to shoot in 1996.\n\nIn that scene, Erika (played by Shields) had to suck the fingers of actor Matt LeBlanc's hand, who played the role of the popular Joey Tribbiani, for being \"the fingers of a genius.\"\n\n\"Andre was in the audience supporting me and he stormed out,\" the actress tells Michael Schulman.\n\n\"He told me: 'Everyone is making fun of me. You have made a fool of me with that behavior.\" To which I replied: \"It's a comedy! What is wrong with you?\", says Brooke Shields in 'The New Yorker'.\n\nBrooke Shields: \"I later found out that Andre Agassi was addicted to methamphetamine at the time\""
