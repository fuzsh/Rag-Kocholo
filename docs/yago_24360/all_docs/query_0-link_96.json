        "text": "I missed the Phil and Tara years. Reading summaries, it sounds like they were written out as a happy couple and then he died in a crash when they were off the canvas. Widowed Tara returned and married the person who would be Kelsey's dad and they left the show. If that is accurate, I wonder if the long-term plan was for Tara to be on longer and Phil return from the dead again with Tara yet again marrying someone while he was dead. His death really does seem like it was not meant to be permanent.\n\nWhen Erica was briefly dating Charly, I wish they would have dug a bit deeper into that history, but it was basically just Ruth disapproving for a few months before they dropped the storyline. They did not even bring up the fact that she was involved with Nick until the very end when he showed up which made her realize this was a mistake.\n\nAMC was such a uniquely wonderful show in its heyday. Had a great mix of quirky character types and compelling stories, not to mention the broad comedy, that you just didn't see on any other soap, esp the P&G soaps where are the characters seemed interchangeable and cliches. Agnes Nixon was a genius, and she and Wisner Washam, and IMO to a lesser extent Lorraine Broderick, were gold together. Washam doesn't get nearly enough credit for the success of the show. It all started to go to hell during McTavish's first run, but was still recognizable and salvageable through the early 2000's until Frons get his grubby little hands on it. Fusion? The unabortion? Positioning the awful Alicia Minshew as the central heroine and on five days a week? Dismissing Julia Barr, and without even an exit story? Poison pancakes? Madden buried alive? I mean, what were they thinking? It was just one bone-headed decision after another.\n\nAMC was the best. I watched from 1986-2000ish. I was bummed to miss the Jenny and Greg era but I was legit 6 when they started their run. I was so excited when Marcy Walker returned as I knew Liza was a bitch for the ages. Her first couple years were amazing but they really softened her to the point of being a simp. I loved how she broke up Tad and Dixie and tangled with Erica at WRCW. My all time favorite character was Natalie Hunter. My favorite storyline was when Adam gaslit Dixie and Tad came to her rescue. Adam could be so evil. I miss those days.\n\n[quoteHer first couple years were amazing but they really softened her to the point of being a simp.\n\nYes, Liza was great on her return with the Tad and Dixie and was initially a great match for Adam. If they would have kept her as the female version of Adam instead of turning her into another victim, I think she would have surpassed Brooke as the love of his life. They were great together when they were equals. I remember reading an interview with her where she wanted Liza to be more like Brooke, which was a mistake since it completely watered her down. Not to mention probably not a smart thing, because they were foolishly starting to backburner Brooke by that point.\n\nLike others here, I have a fondness for AMC from the early '80s. I started college in the all of 1980. The TV in the dorm's lounge rec'd one channel - an ABC affiliate. I'd meet another guy from the dorm in the lounge around 1pm (after lunch before 2 o'clock classes).\n\nWe started watching AMC - were hooked. Am I right that during that time, Ellen's daughter Devin (or Devon?) got pregnant, became an alcoholic, left Pine Valley with husband Wally and the daughter. Tad started smoking pot he'd chow down on Grandma Martin's chocolate chip cookies). Dr. Joe almost had an affair with the new neighbor Lenore (who was a battered wife). Palmer's first wife/Nina's mother was in town to stir up trouble and didn't Langley arrive to woo Phoebe (Myrtle knew him from her carney days). And yes, Jenny, Greg, Liza, and more...\n\nI missed the early 80's golden age - although there is a fair amount of that on youtube. I started watching in 87 when I think it was slowing improving after a mid-80s decline and then from about 89 to 95 it was pretty good. Late 90's it started it decline although thought there were times when it showed signs it was going to have a bounce back, especially around 2000 with the introduction of pre-Ryan Greenlee (who really should have been the recast Kendel), David, Vanessa when she was an amoral socialite and not a drug lord, and Leo. I think by 2005 it was too far gone, although I heard it was a little better the last 6 months or so and the online version was heading in the right direction. I was going to try out the online version, but within about a week of airing they announced they were reducing the episodes and the writing was already on the wall.\n\nI wish there was more on youtube from the 70's to see more of Phoebe when was more of a force than comic relief (although good comic relief), pre-stardom Erica, and some of the forgotten Tyler family etc. It makes sense that there is less of it, because people were not recording it on their VCRs - too bad the original tapes were destroyed.\n\nI know the scenes with family members or friends talking about recent events were just a way to repeat the plots for people had VCRs and became less necessary, but I think they added some depth to the people and made their relationships more real. Erica's bickering scenes with Mark and Mona recapping her recent disasters added something to the show and the characters. Natalies scenes talking with Donna helped bring out the other sides of her etc. When they cut down on some of that stuff, the show started to lose some of its character.\n\n[quote]Doug and Aggie clashed on Loving. Would've killed to have been a fly on the wall during their shouting matches. His name was eventually stricken from the \"Created by\" credit. It must've been bad. I love Ag and am not the biggest of Marland champions, but I have to say that first year or two when he was HW was the only watchable era for that mostly awful show.\n\nI'll say this much: towards the tail end of its run, Loving had one of the best teen/young adult casts of any of the soaps--Rebecca Gayheart, Amelia Heinle, Laura Wright (back when she was still Laura Sisk), Michael Weatherly (pre-sex pest), Paul Anthony Stewart, and Roger Howarth.\n\nI also REALLY loved The City, even if it was about a decade ahead of its time.\n\nr31 By Jove!\n\n[quote] Devin (or Devon?) got pregnant, became an alcoholic, left Pine Valley with husband Wally and the daughter.\n\nOMFG Now I remember that dry-ass homely Devon bitch! Wally? Lol. What a dweeb.\n\n[quote] Tad started smoking pot he'd chow down on Grandma Martin's chocolate chip cookies).\n\nRemember Tad was a dorky high school nerd. Then he was replaced with a different actor who was a Romeo lady killer. Funny how a new actor could create an entirely new persona for the character!\n\n[quote] didn't Langley arrive to woo Phoebe (Myrtle knew him from her carney days).\n\nYes, originally, Langley, aka The Professor, was a con artist who was gonna scam Phoebe out of her money. Then he actually fell in love with her, they married, and he became Pine Valley royalty.\n\nR36, I am going to add more remembrances of AMC storylines without doing an online search... I think these are also part of my college viewing, but maybe not...\n\nThere was the conniving Sybil Thorne (well, Nurse Thorne). She wanted Cliff, we all know that Cliff wanted Nina, Nina's father Palmer did not want Cliff to have Nina. Then Sybil was dead! I think this was a big storyline - who killed Nurse Thorne? Am I correct that the murderer was Tom Cudahy's no good brother? I can't remember that character's name! I think tom's brother also toyed with the beloved (but later alcoholic/possible lesbian) Devon,\n\nAnd, wasn't it Carrie Sanders and her no-good boyfriend who introduced Tad to the evil weed? And later, didn't Carrie marry Chuck? Did they depart Pine Valley together?\n\nOh, the years go by and the storylines seem to merge and character names fade... Jenny, Greg, Liza Colby, Jessie, Angie...\n\nHow did Kate Collins \"suck\" R56? The actress took the script written by others, and with members of the cast, created what has become a revered character for many viewers. She wasn't a terrible actress by any means, later playing two roles - there was Natalie's whacked-out sister, \"Janet from another planet.\"\n\nSo, besides posting something stupid, how did she \"suck\"?\n\nOh and R54, I'm with you... storylines and characters get tangled in my brain as well. Anyone else remember Mark Dalton? He was Erica's half-brother, played the piano at Pine Valley's swanky restaurant, The Chateau - I think. He was married to Devon's mother Ellen. They divorced? I can't remember anything else... did Mark die on AMC? Did the character get killed off after leaving Pine Valley?\n\nI started watching during the summer of '87 (my summer job played during the lunch break). The build-up was starting up for Ross raping Natalie. She was trying to resist and remain faithful to Palmer and his marriage was falling apart. Palmer suspected there was something going on and was trying to set-up situations where he would catch them in the act, but Natalie wanted to make her marriage with Palmer work. Ross got angrier as the summer went on and his marriage unraveled, and Natalie did not want to resume the affair. Kathleen Noone really hit it out of the park as Ellen that and deserved that Emmy. It is too bad they completely put her on back burner when it was over and wrote her off the next year.\n\nErica was hiding the fact that she was pregnant, I think Cliff \"died\" and Nina rebounded with Matt, and Phoebe tried to break up Hilary and the Tad replacement Mitch who was good looking but probably not the most charismatic actor. They paired up Brooke and Adam and Tom and Skye. I wondered if at the time they were still thinking Brooke and Tom as the endgame with Adam being the heavy keeping them apart, but then Adam and Brooke really clicked.\n\nI remember so many obscure details from about 1987 to 1997 -- and barely anything from about 2003 to 2008 or so when I stopped watching.\n\nI was all about AMC from the late 70s thru early 90s. The stretches of 1978 thru 1984, then late 1986 (Jorn Winther's return as EP) thru 1988, and finally 1990-1992 (FMB as EP; Agnes as HW; Lorraine, Wisner, and Megan as assoc HWs) were really excellent. For me it started to lose that certain something when the Maricks and Santoses became the dramatic focus as the 90s progressed, but it was still good. I kept up with it and watched sporadically from the late 90s through the truly bitter end. If any show was the victim of network interference, it was AMC. Frons admitted that when he took over at ABC, he didn't \"get\" AMC, and thus started experimenting with different formats, such as trying to turn it into a Sex and the City clone. Big mistake.\n\nAMC's best years IMO were 1977-1984. The show was firing on all cylinders and just about everything clicked, save for clunkers like Brooke's drug lord mother and the Devon/Wally/Betsy snoozefest. Just a wonderfully entertaining and intelligent show. Even the so-so 1984-1986 period, which was when Agnes took a step back to concentrate on Loving, was miles better than anything on now. The show started running into trouble in the mid-90s IMO when they tried to give the show a more urban feel, to compete with the increasingly popular Days. All of a sudden Pine Valley had a skyline! I don't recall if that was Francesca James or the tail end of FMB's reign, but I'm guessing that was network dictated. I remember FMB's exit interview with SOD at the time, and she said that network wanted changes made that she didn't necessarily agree with.\n\nI know Brooke and Erica were not Dorian and Vicky, but they were great together (any combo of Erica-Brooke-Adam interacting was usually worth watching). The fact that they were not always in epic showdowns like Dorian and Vicky made their moments of awkwardly helping St other a bit more believable. Still, there dynamic was underused as was Brooke in general the last years of the show.\n\nLucci's reading of Ivana shows off a bit of her comedic timing. It is too bad Devious Maids did not last a couple more years. It was not a bad show and while not as good as Desperate Housewives in its prime, it was not in decline, and the last season was just as strong as when the show started.\n\nA poster on the current P&G thread thought that Doug Marland would've been a good fit at AMC. I can't see that at all. Marland's stories and characters were mostly humorless. Everything was deadly serious. AMC's forte was humor and lightheartedness. Although I could see him strengthening the family bonds, he could never have written characters like Opal or Billy Clyde or Phoebe or Langley. Those characters were pure Agnes! I forgot...did he do anything with the more Nixon-type characters of Billy and Rita Mae Bristow on Loving? Now, Claire Labine is someone who I think would've done wonders for AMC. I would love to have seen what she could've done there. I wonder why ABC put her at OLTL, to burn out her contract, rather than at AMC after she was ousted from GH.\n\nDid Kathleen Noone quit or was she fired? Someone upthread said she was let go, but I could swear in some exit interview at the time, she said that it was her choice, and that the show was changing and she felt she was no longer an integral part of it. She also said that Agnes told her she'd like her to return some day. I can't imagine what they would've done with Ellen at that point, except maybe to connect her to Erica's stories via Mark. By late 1989, both Ross and Julie were gone. They really didn't seem interested in writing for her once the rape trial was resolved, which was a shame. She always brought her A-game.\n\nThere were a lot of things that went wrong with AMC in the last few years, but the worst was making fucking Ryan Lavery the “hero” of the show and bringing in those Carey whores, Babe and Krystal. I hated those three characters so much.\n\nThe most popular storyline of that last decade was the “baby switch” where Bianca “lost” her baby. It actually was a pretty good umbrella story, and brought the show the highest ratings in years (briefly) but think how great it would have been with Brooke and her daughter Laura (the adopted one, not the dead one) in place of the execrable Babe and Krystal.\n\nAround that time they also had the terrible stories like the unabortion, Tad burying Dr. Madden alive, the Satin Slayer (RIP SIMONE!!)…sigh..I try to block out the awful last few years, since I loved that show SO much starting from about 1981.\n\nI began watcing AMC on the regular in the early 1980s, I have vague memories of Devon's dip into the ladypond, but it was Greg and Jenny who really drew me in. I was nine or so and thought they were the most beautiful couple I had ever seen, and to be fair Delaney and Lau were one of the best looking 'Supercouples' in Soaps. I also loved, Jessie/Angie, Tad/Hillary/Dottie. Nico/Julie/Cecily/Charlie and then Lanie/David/Trask which led to Haley and Brian which eventually led to Matteo. AMC did the juvenile love stories for summer ratings veyr well. I stopeed watching AMC regularly in the early 2000s, the last thing I recall enjoying were Greenlee and Leo (not together, just the two characters). I really had little interest in Minshew as Kendall or Ryan who seemed to be pushed a lot.\n\n[quote]He was shoved into the audience's faces as a man with no fauts, that everyone loved him, that he was the smartest, most successful man.\n\nAnd he was actually kind of bullying thug. The power dynamics between and Kendel were a bit off at times if I remember correctly where he came across as the controlling older man -- not this great partnership. I actually thought he had better chemistry with Lucci and Erica would have been more of an equal to him. Really the Cambias brother they should have kept was Michael. Devry was a better actor and instead of making him pure evil he should have remained the unscrupulous businessman to fill the void left by Palmer and Adam who was starting to show their age and had been mellowed.\n\nI think Babe and Krystal had a similar problem. The actresses were good, and the show needed a new bad girl and scheming mother. However, shortly after they joined, someone decided they should be heroines and suddenly everyone was saying Babe was love and Krystal was this protective loving mother. Part of the problem is they did not change their storyline, so they were still having everyone praise and worry about Babe while she was stealing her second baby. If they would have kept her as the scheming vixen with moments of vulnerability instead of the constantly weeping victim she would have been a good addition to the show.\n\nRyan was not bad as a supporting character but should have never been a fulltime lead. It did not help that someone seemed to want to sledgehammer in Ryan and Greenlee as a great love and soulmates when that was contrary to their history and they had no chemistry (which he actually did have with Kendel before he went into his full superman stage).\n\nOLTL was my show (and Y&R) and I obsessed about OLTL's ratings.\n\nAMC was my mom's show and I hated it and found it boring and the \"comedy\" goofy and tacky.\n\nUpon further review on youtube AMC in that 82-84 and 86-88 era was very, very good. It reminds me of my mom and grandparents and the show has this cozy quality that no other show had.\n\nI remember when OLTL fell out of the top 3 in the late fall of 89 and AMC became 3rd for a time- then shot up in 91? 92? during that Natalie in the well storyline. Was Marlena and the devil around the same time? I recall Days and AMC getting that major popularity around the same time in 92-93 when I was in 9th grade.\n\nAMC was my show too. I was a little soap gayling in the 80s and 90s, and kept track of most of the shows, but AMC seemed so unique and Pine Valley felt like a real small town with quirky, diverse characters balanced among the more standard stock soap characters. MARY! me, but you could feel the love that the actors had for each other spill over into their characters, and I think many viewers picked up on that warmth and friendship. Jane Elliot said in an interview that AMC was her favorite set, because the actors and crew mingled and were so accommodating. Evidently, they all ate lunch together or something to that effect. I think the show gets a bad wrap from some soap purists who take these shows so seriously, because at its best, the show never took itself too seriously. God forbid satire is allowed in daytime!\n\nHas anyone met or seen any AMC actors in person? I met Ruth Warrick, Jean LeClerc and Kate Collins at a mall autograph signing event. I used to live near the old studio on 66th Street and I'd sometimes see the actors. I recall seeing MEK, Julia Barr, Dorothy Lyman, Ray MacDonnell, Mary Fickett, Candi Earley. I also saw James Mitchell walking in the West Village circa 1990. He was just as you'd expect...very handsome and very dapper. And I once witnessed what appeared to be a chance encounter between Carmen Thomas and Robert Duncan McNeil on the Upper West Side. They hugged each other and looked surprised to see the other. That was the mid-90s, long after they had left the show. I'm sure there were others, but those are the ones I best recall.\n\nNot to devalue Doug Marland's contributions to early LOVING -- especially since he had the unenviable task of retooling the show throughout 1984 -- but I think that the project was always going to make it to air, with or without him. ABC seemed high upon having another Agnes Nixon show (especially since RYAN'S HOPE had pretty much peaked), so it might have been a case of get someone to write this thing, and if he's a \"name,\" well that's a plus, too. I'm going to guess that Doug and Agnes' rift was based on creative differences. Maybe by the end he felt like a well-paid hired gun rather than a true crative force. Who's to say that if LOVING had been a Proctor & Gamble soap developed circa 1988, the shoe wouldn't have been on the other foot and Agnes would have been the odd one out?\n\nTheir shared goal was to create another AMC that would be devoured on college campuses, which is probably why Alden U was prominent in the beginning. I thought the first year was really good with Doug as HW. So many shows at that time, including AMC, were delving into action adventure stuff, while Loving got back to the roots of classic soap, and it was refreshing. It seemed like a hybrid of late 70s AMC and his GL tenure, and it all somehow coalesced to become an interesting show.\n\nSomething happened BTS in 1984. whether it was ABC's jettison of the incest story, or something else. I remember in 1985, Larry Lau was asked in an interview about the decline in quality of AMC, which was a valid point (SOD named AMC the most disappointing show of 1985), and he responded that the show suffered a bit because Agnes removed herself from the day-to-day in order to concentrate on Loving.\n\nI think ultimately, Agnes and Doug were just two different types of writers. Her stories tended to be more fanciful, lighthearted, emotional, and tinged with comic relief. His, on the other hand, were generally very serious and humorless. She was fluid in her writing, while he tended to be very rigid. Honestly, I couldn't see them agreeing on anything. It's a miracle any type of collaborative effort actually made it to air.\n\n[quote]I always loved the Christmas episodes…especially the one where Kate Collins came back as an angel for Timmy\n\nThose were nice episodes but in later years that had a ghoulish Santa show spouting about Christmas miracles --- you will find your daughter someday Tad -- and bam -- a happy Christmas car accident that killed her adoptive parents to bring her into Pine Valley. I think ghost Dixie saw and recognized her in the hospital ER as she was heading to heaven after eating those pancakes, but I remember a lot more details about things that happened in 1987 to 1997 than anything from 2003 to 2008 or so.\n\nOne kind of cheesy Christmas story was Mrytle dating Santa. It could have been really painful but Eileen sold it and it gave her something to do other than try to talk sense into Erica. She also got to use her comedic chops as Mrs. Clause. Mrytle was a great character because she was not always saintly nice and could tell someone off if she had a mind to it.\n\nYes, Tad was engaged to Dottie, even though he was in love with Hillary, because he had gotten Dottie pregnant..but she lost the baby. I liked Dottie.\n\nHillary (Carmen Thomas) and Tad married and divorced, then she was with Bob Georgia for a while, but eventually left town with Mitch, Donna’s brother. Around that time, Tad and Greg Nelson both had flings with Robin, played by beautiful blond Deborah Morehart, who morphed into plastic surgery victim Hunter Tylo from B&B. Robin’s brother Wade was married to Phoebe for a minute and tried to steal her fortune.\n\nWhen AMC was in its death throes, Tad had a long lost son show up, played by future Ryan Murphy fave, Finn Wittrock. They retconned it that at some point, Tad had run into Hillary while out of town and they had a one night stand, “for old time’s sake,” and she got pregnant and passed the kid off as the son of whoever she was married to at that point. They kept mentioning Hillary, and Micheal E. Knight was hoping they would bring back Carmen Thomas for a bit, but they never did. Carmen Thomas is a yoga teacher now, and was never a GREAT actress, but I bet she would have done okay for a few episodes.\n\nI can’t believe I remember all of this…I barely remember what I had for breakfast today!\n\nThank you, Pine Valley Historian! (Phoebe Tyler Wallingford would be so proud of you for having all of that in the record.) For some reason, I thought Hillary was with Bob before Tad, like that Bob was holding up the couple's (short-lived, as it turned out) happiness.\n\nWow, that retcon seems awkward. The way I remember it (which could be fuzzy), Hillary left before Tad, then Tad came back for the first round of his romance with Dixie before \"dying.\" When he came back, it was time for the Ted Orsini story. That could have been an interesting thing to work in the retcon with Finn's character ... whether it was Ted or Tad that Hillary had slept with.\n\nI worked on shows that Doug Marland directed in his hardscrabble years before he enrolled in the \"writing for soap operas\" course that eventually led to his TV career as HW.\n\nIt is not surprising that Doug had fallings out with Agnes Nixon or various actors, as he was a difficult man. At times, if you called him up, he would greet you frostily and get off quickly, and you knew he was mad about something, but you had no idea what it was that you did this time. Finally, I just gave up on him. But once he got big on network TV, he was popular with all the world, as you may imagine. Imagine the power he had over actors.\n\nHe also liked to fire someone in the cast early in rehearsals, on each production. Just to establish tone, I suppose.\n\nBut he was a good director of musicals, and I wonder how he would have fared if instead of getting into soaps he lucked into a gig on Broadway. He did, I remember, write the script for a musical based on Waterloo Bridge, but never found a composer he liked.\n\nR182- Rauch brought OLTL the greatest background music with the most over the top and brightest and unflattering lighting imaginable. OLTL was the yin to Y&R's yang. Fast paced, Excellent and contemporary 80's keyboard scoring, and neon lighting out of a Spencer Gifts. I think that's why Y&R and OLTL were my shows.\n\nOne of the magazines asked the Lighting Director once why the show was so brightly lit, and his response was that Rauch wanted the show to have completely upbeat look and wanted the actors eyes to shine.\n\nAnd I have to tell you, if you watch the show, you can see that each actor's eyes glisten and glow- its like their key light was made to make you see their eyes very clearly.\n\nI absolutely was NUTS for Rauch's OLTL until mid 1990 when the show lost all of its mojo\n\nUpon review of Gottlieb's OLTL- which I liked at the time- especially the classy production values and lighting- the background music was generally horrendous (with the exception of Blair's early theme- yes, Asian Blair had a great early theme, kind of like Gabrielle and Tina did... and that special orchestra Gottlieb hired for Cassie/Alex at Loon Lake)\n\nGottlieb's OLTL sucked ass. Its EXTREMELY boring and stodgy, despite the contemporary stories.\n\nThe only stories worth watching were Marty's Rape, Todd terrorizing Nora, The AIDS quilt storyline (I respect that story, but even that one as an Afterschool Special vibe) and of course Viki's Alters- which came after Gottlieb, but the show still felt just like Gottlieb's. OH! And Alex and Carlo.\n\nThe rest was shit. AfterSchool Special vibes for days, TONS of shitty and boring/hokey supporting characters (Suede?? Fuck) and just a really meh vibe that has not aged well.\n\nR183 I feel like the best of Gottlieb's OLTL was in that first year, and also revisiting the Viki/Dorian story and expanding Viki's alters, which came about 2 years into Gottlieb's regime.\n\nFor all her good ideas about how to improve the look of the show, she was one of any number of producers/writers who just didn't understand what a soap was, and tried to make it anything other than the very thing it was created to be. God...I mean, Irna knows, there were plenty of old hoary soap tropes that needed to be ditched, but story beats still needed to be played, pacing needed to happen to engage the viewer.\n\nToo much of Gottlieb and Malone's time on OLTL missed some of those daily beats. Same happened during the time Claire Labine was at GL. That's when GL went from all plot and no character to the opposite extreme. *sigh*\n\nThere’s a fun Instagram account by Adamtghani that posts classic soap clips. He does a great job of curating somewhat obscure scenes that aren’t easily found on YouTube. Over the weekend he posted a 10 minute vignette of Brooke telling The Martins and Cortlandts that Jamie was in fact Tad’s son. Tom and Jack joined her for moral support and it was so layered and rich. So NYC history in one living room. Cut to a stellar fight between Erica and Brooke. Erica was unraveling her new romance with Jack and it was such a fun scene. The show was firing on all cylinders at this point and leaning into history in a way that the best writers do. For fans, it’s worth checking out. Also, why didn’t I realize how hot Tom Cudahey was when I was a wee gayling watching this the first time?\n\nThat clip is great R191. I like that all of the characters have history and use that in subtext in how they interact with each other, and while she was not exactly tactful, not sure what Erica said about Tom at the end was all that incorrect. They really were stunning when they were first paired up. Tom was always handsome, but by the time I started watching he was basically Ward Cleaver in his cardigans and khakis.\n\nWhile it was good soap and Barr nailed Brooke going off the deep end when the marriage ended, I thought it was out of character for Brooke to eventually married Tad. She knew he was in love with Dixie and was more than competent and capable enough to know she could raise Jamie as a single mother, plus she really was not in love with Tad as it was.\n\nThat old pic at R167 of Gillain's Vicky gazing adoringly at her father is a bit creepy given how they rewrote their backstory.\n\n[quote]there were plenty of old hoary soap tropes that needed to be ditched, but story beats still needed to be played, pacing needed to happen to engage the viewer.\n\nI liked your post. There is nothing worse than someone who comes to a soap opera with the idea that they're re-inventing the genre. I call them the we're going to make this like primetime people. It never works. And they usually end up leaving.\n\nHere's the thing, even when you can see them from a mile away, most soap tropes still work. Even if you're rolling your eyes while they're happening. A woman not knowing who fathered her baby is still fun story. Unplanned pregnancies, who shot someone, and all the others are still fun. Soaps are supposed to be slow, because they have the time to be slow.\n\nTo be quite honest, a lot of the things that we accept now as soap opera isn't really traditional soap opera. Those 30 second scenes, insta-romances and friendships, mysteries that wrap up in 6 weeks, the character juggling, that's not how it should work. But, we've accepted it, and now that's the way it is.\n\nThe reason why people got so caught up in these things is because it was like peeking in on your neighbors. That sort of got lost or it was replaced by reality TV.\n\nI loved AMC in the early 1980s. I would watch it in the summer and during winter break when I was in high school. The show did a good job of making Pine Valley seem like a real town. I liked when they did the exterior shots of homes and businesses before scenes would start. I wanted to live in a town like Pine Valley. I loved that it was a multi-generational show. I was crazy about the teen characters (Jenny, Jesse, Liza, Greg, Amanda, and Alfred). Jesse and Mark were cute, but for the most part, I was never attracted to the men on AMC. On the other hand, I thought the men on Edge of Night -- Preacher, Gavin, Damian, Brian and Owen Madison -- were gorgeous.\n\n[quote] Not sure why MEK never came out. It's not like he's real busy and has to protect an image or anything.\n\nI knew about MEK. The one I can't figure out is James Patrick Stuart (JPS) who played Will Cortlandt on AMC and now plays Valentin on GH.\n\nMEK and JPS have been the best of friends since AMC. When MEK and Catherine Hickland got \"married\" she was unexpectedly cast in some Broadway show and couldn't go on their non-refundable honeymoon in some exotic location (Bali or Tahiti...) so JPS went on the honeymoon with MEK. Presently, JPS stays at MEK's home to lessen his commute while he shoots two shows, GH and some Disney show. In my opinion, JPS doesn't have any heat with the women's he's paired with and makes odd overexaggerated faces and voices when he's trying to be sexy. I don't know, I could be wrong. He's been married a long time, to the same woman, two boys, MEK is godfather to one of the boys.\n\nR277 Don't respond to that poster. That's our resident totally loony tunes soap board poster.\n\nIt has several accounts and several \"shticks\" as R278 accurately describes them, including:\n\n(1) Mentioning obviously gay/lesbian performers and insisting they were in a heterosexual relationship with a costar.\n\n(2) Discussing how XYZ actress clogged the studio's toilets.\n\n(3) Various snatches that have or have not been eaten among the female cast members.\n\n(4) Pretending to be someone or something called Scoche Marin, who claims to have replaced the long dead Jeanne Cooper as long dead Katherine Chancellor on Y&R\n\n(5) Insisting that several of the classic NYC soaps should have hired performers such as Shannon Tweed (and other C listers) to replace more quiet, traditional actors/performers.\n\n(6) Discussing other obsession with various things, including but not limited to: whether someone is using the \"The\" for Guiding Light, calling everything \"fat,\" or low-energy, complaining about any performer who ever said they were overworked, and so on.\n\nAnd last but worst:\n\n(7) Carrying on detailed, lengthy and repetitive posting about posters at Soap Opera Network's message board, even though none of those people post here and absolutely no one in the history of ever cares even a tiny little smidgeon about any of them or any of the board drama there. He seems to be especially obsessed about someone who is \"in the biz\" and a poster who is chronically ill with a neurological condition, and obsesses about them at length.\n\nIt would not surprise me if this poster is in an institution.\n\nAnyway, save yourself the frustration and block/FF them. You'll be glad you did.\n\nI think the idea of Brooke's mother was also to add some conflict to the Phoebe/Brooke relationship, but I don't think the writes were invested in that. They also toyed with the idea of a Phoebe/Langley/Jane triangle, but that never went anywhere. Most of 1986, when Jane first arrived, was a transitional year for the show and really uneven, as Jackie Babbin departed as EP in August, and Jorn Winther returned to take the reins. Julia Barr said at the time that Jackie had become lazy and wasn't really making any firm decisions, and that Jorn had the unenviable task of coming onto an inactive show and get things moving. I can't believe I remember all this, but as a troubled and confused gayling, I lived and breathed AMC for all of the '80s through the mid-90s.\n\nI have a book on All My Children trivia from the 90s and when developing the show in 1969, Agnes Nixon really wanted Frances Reid (matriarch Alice Horton on Days of Our Lives) as one of the main cast members, they didn't mention what part. Frances thought about it as her DAYS contract was up in 1969, and she was offered a then very large sum of money to join AMC at that time, she also still had her NYC apartment as she was a Broadway and theatre actress and had done NYC taped soaps like Portia Faces Life prior to Days\n\nIn fact, Days was supposed to be a NYC taped soap until NBC decided to move the show out to the West Coast last minute, the Corday family who created DAYS were all born and bread New Yorkers and Ted Corday was friends with Agnes Nixon and worked with her on As The World Turns and Guiding Light\n\nAny guesses on what role Agnes wanted Frances for? I'm thinking Ruth Martin\n\nSome lovely memories of AMC in the \"olden days.\" I started watching the show as a nascent gayling with my mother during summer break from elementary school. I remember the Tara/Phil love story as *the* story, and agonizing when Phil was reported MIA in Vietnam and Tara married Chuck Tyler to give her baby a \"name.\"\n\nAgnes Nixon must have hated hookers, because no hooker on AMC ever got a break: Estelle died (I forget if it was at the hands of Billy Clyde Tuggle); Donna survived getting beat up and even fell in love with Chuck Tyler, but was opposed by Phoebe. I forget how many other husbands she had -- at least Palmer Cortland and Benny Sago. When her one-night stand with Chuck resulted in a baby when she was married to Palmer (who at that point was said to be infertile), that baby died in a fire and she went crazy for a while.\n\nLoved evil Natalie, not nicey-nicey Natalie. Was Erica her main rival? Whoever they had her go against, it was hilarious.\n\nI watched up through college (mid-80s) and remember how one of my female floormates and I cheered when Nina and Cliff got back together. By the time Kendall showed up and both Dimitri and his brother were afraid of her, I was kind of over it, and by then, most of the old guard was gone anyway.\n\nI can't find the website now, but some fan maintained an entire website of Pine Valley storylines and connections between characters. Wasted quite some time going through and reliving some of those stories.\n\nYou fuckers are insane? Y&R was stunning and looked better than many films. The camera work, the lighting- was cinematic quality. Also, if you watch episodes from 1984 or 1986 today, other than the hairstyles, the shows look modern- they almost look timeless. Its almost creepy to think that the show was filmed 35 years ago.\n\nOLTL on the flip side was so brightly lit and it really is a great 80's time capsule. Tina's Salmon Colored 1986 era condo/apt is epic to me.\n\nThese were my shows.\n\nI'm a little bummed that this thread is only about AMC. But AMC was my late mom's show, so its kind of nice..\n\nY&R and OLTL were basically polar opposites in the 80's..\n\nBoth also had the BEST background music- one orchestral and cinematic and the other synth driven Miami Vice style/ horror film style music.\n\nBright lighting/dark lighting.\n\nR388- You have got to be kidding me. Y&R was not lit like other soaps in the 80's... Go check out ATWT, OLTL, GL, I can go on...\n\nY&R was on another level for more than 30 years... That Cassandra Rawlings house in 89-90 was like something out of Sirk film from the 50's..\n\nI found it really cool when Doug Davidson mentioned it a year or so ago on his Twitter that it was the most expensive set ever built on daytime.. It had this amazing staircase- I wish there more episodes with this home on Youtube. I think Brad and Tracy owned it later.\n\nBack to AMC- a show I always found to look the cheapest of all the shows. Upon further review- it actually had a really homey and comfy vibe. And it was actually lit really well in the late 80's (I am unsure who the producer was) But my god, early 90's AMC looked so. fucking.cheap. And this is during its PINNACLE ratings wise with the Natalie in the well storyline. (I even watched this storyline- and I forgot that!)\n\nI also vaguely recall (mid 90's?) Brooke having some MASSIVE home with stain glass windows?? It looked like something from Wizard of Oz or something, I remember being shocked and impressed, as I had always thought AMC looked like shit. It was huge and a lot of depth, and on par with a Y&R set.\n\nAs I started visiting this site in 2001 DUE to OLTL, I am a little surprised that no one talks about OLTL anymore here. (It was definitely DL's soap)\n\nHowever, I have to admit that when you think of Agnes, you think of AMC. So this thread is cool.\n\nI never looked at OLTL as the red headed stepchild, but that really crazy sibling who ran off to Europe and had all sorts of whacked out adventures instead of going to college. Its highs to me, were higher than any soap- ever. Its lows- could be lower than any soap ever. It was that mentally ill sibling who was medicated as well.\n\nI did a little deep dive on AMC Christmas episodes today…some wonderful soul has uploaded almost every year to the YouTube… and they are really fun. Phoebe was the main character of most of the 80s episodes. She seemed to have some sort of crisis every Christmas! I don’t know if it was because Natalie wasn’t tied to any major families, but Kate Collins wasn’t featured in many of the Christmas episodes—I looked!\n\nIn the Christmas 1987 and 1988 episodes, Ellen and Mark were doing the same thing—worrying about Julie! I really thought they were gone by the end of 1988, but I guess not. For the life of me, I can’t think of any storyline Ellen or Mark had from 1987 to 1988, other than his coke addiction or them worrying about Julie. Pretty sure the both of them, and Julie, were gone by the end of 1989.\n\nI can’t say much about the stories, but GL looked good when Conboy was there. I watched all five years of Capitol (though much of it is like a fever dream), but I don’t remember that show as being particularly darkly lit the way I think of early YR.\n\nI too loved the Rawlins house set (and the story) on YR. I had no idea that set was the most expensive. I know very early into its run YR’s Chancellor estate was the most expensive set in daytime. They sure got their money’s worth out if that.\n\nI agree with an above poster who mentioned AMC’s Pine Valley feeling like a real small town and loved all the establishing shots that were used in the 1980s. By the 1990s (maybe the mid 1990s) it became seemingly bigger and more metropolitan that Philadelphia.\n\nI used to work and drive around Agnes Nixon’s home in the early to mid 1990s. All of the street names had influenced her creations of Pine Valley, Corinth, and Llanview.\n\nR403 All soap cities did, and that became part of the problem - it stretched credibility that a multimillion dollar company would be in little Cooter Holler or what have you, for one.\n\nAnd then when the budget cuts came, it was hard to make the sets look as nice as they had been. Which is why so many shows had their residents living in hotels. Almost no one could have their own set any more.\n\nR406\n\nI think there was a real resistance to change. Many shows kept on staff in front of the camera and behind the scenes much longer than they should have. What became a permanent change was thought of as a temporary one. After all, most shows had ebbed and flowed before, and the money/sponsors had always been there.\n\nAW's cancellation in 1999 didn't seem to make a huge impact, but when GL started really hemorrhaging money they were the first to get significant cuts. We heard about the 15 percent pay cuts for actors but most of the behind the scenes folks - directors especially - lost their jobs. Some of them had been there for 30+ years. They canned Bruce Barry in a year where he'd won either an Emmy or a DGA award. They cut so many of these positions around 2004-2005 (this was also when Mickey Dwyer Dobbin was fired and the whole PGP liasion position, which had been Ed Trach for many years before MADD, was eliminated - which should have been the sign the PGP shows were on borrowed time).\n\nThe new production method in 2007 was at least in part an attempt to use fewer camera crew members and also allow the show to film with nonunion crew when they filmed in Peapack. I think. (One of the locations was union, one was not, I think Peapack was the non but I may have those reversed. Anyway.)\n\nI think one of the main things that impacted New York based soaps (eventually it got to LA) was real estate. Leasing studio space and set storage space got more and more expensive. Regarding studio space, production models changed so that shows were no longer filming 5 days a week/52 weeks a year (with the exception of holiday dark days or a dark week). This meant that sets had to be taken down and put back up more often, which increased storage costs and personnel cost to take down and put back up.\n\nThis also meant that shows, when in production, were limited to only certain sets to keep personnel costs down. The way most of the shows handled this (and the way the LA shows handle it now) is that they've shrunk the size of sets so that they may have more sets standing all the time and more people are living in hotels or mansions.\n\nGone are those spacious mansion sets and hospital sets, because they just don't have the room. Everything has been shrunk down. The hotel sets and mansion bedroom sets are easy because they can just redress the same room a hundred different ways.\n\nI don't understand why GH looks better than the other shows. At some point I read that they shoot by set, but I think all the shows shoot that way. So I'm not sure what they're during differently that allows them to have all of these sets, but you can tell that even some of their sets are smaller.\n\nBen Jorgensen (Kevin) played Chris Hughes for a bit on ATWT, but didn’t really click. I think he died last year.\n\nTC Warner (Kelsey) never did any other soaps, I don’t think, but I believe she still acts.\n\nDarlene Tejeiro played Anita the longest (even though Jordana Brewster was in the role for a bit and went on to semi-fame) but I can barely remember her.\n\nScott Chandler was also around for that, but I hardly remember the kid who played him before Scott Cosgrove took over.\n\nMy mom and I were ABC soap watchers and really just \"Ryan's Hope\" and \"AMC\" at that, so we came late to \"One Life to Live.\" I think by that point, the Buchanans were part of Llanview, Victor Lord was long dead, and Judith Light no longer on the show. Still, there were good years.\n\nThere is a reason Susan Lucci never won a Daytime Emmy until she finally got the pity award one year, and these two women were why: Robin Strasser and Erika Slezak, who were soap opera divas extraordinaire.\n\nIn this part 2 of four clips, Dorian finally tells Viki she knows that Victor Lord sexually abused her as a child, causing Viki to split into multiple personalities and hold Dorian captive. I forget how long that storyline lasted, but it was awesome.\n\nLoving was really fun the first couple of years, and had its moments when Gwyneth and Tricia came on, and The DL has well documented the attributes of one Robert Tyler (Trucker). That said, it never was GREAT.\n\nI remember getting really sick of that “Thornbirds” storyline with Shana and Father Jim.\n\nIMDB says that Christine Tudor (Gwyneth) and Tricia (Noelle Beck) are only one year apart in age, despite playing mother and daughter. There is no way Christine Tudor was born in 1967!\n\nI was kind of angry that this thread was only about AMC but when I though about it Agnes threw away OLTL pretty early, and AMC is her baby.\n\nThat being said, I think I said above that AMC was my mother's soap and I never vibed with it, other than a brief period with Natalie in the Well..\n\nThat being said, I agree with R472- When watching these shows on Youtube, that 81-84 era really has a homey, comfy, yet classy vibe.. I can see why so many people loved this show now.\n\nOLTL was definitely a psychological soap until around 1982- and then to me it has ZERO identity until 1985... Those 83-84 episodes of OLTL are straight ups pedestrian and boring.\n\nOh, forgot to add that Zach Grayson was played by Patti LuPone’s brother!\n\nThat murder mystery was fun, but 1985 wasn’t a great year for AMC. Dottie and Tad were involved in some weird adventure story, the aforementioned fake Nina, fake Liza, fake Greg, etc. Kate Collins injected some oomph later in the year, but AMC didn’t fully rebound until they righted the ship in the back half of 1986, made big umbrella stories, and moved Erica and Natalie out of the Jeremy orbit. I’d say the show was mostly excellent (there were a few clunker stories, of course) for at least another decade. There were many great stories in the late 90s, but Pine Valley had really started to change.\n\nI think the last “classic” AMC story was Bianca coming out in December 2000.\n\nI started watching AMC in 1977 when I was in 7th grade. Back then we only had the 3 networks on TV and my older sister controlled it so I fell into AMC and General Hospital. I agree with the above poster who said the best years were from about 1980-1988. There really were some great stories. Although I do remember a storyline in the 1990's where the whole town of Pine Valley was on some sort of cruise and David Heyward had spiked the punch that everyone was drinking with libitizone which was some sort of Viagra that made everyone horny. At this point Liza was back on the show and shes at the punch bowl with old Dr. Joe drinking the punch and old Dr. Joe was getting his groove on hitting on Liza, it was pure gold...HaHa.\n\nI remember being surprised to learn that Gillian Spencer was the original Viki on OLTL. She was so fun and vibrant on AMC, and Viki as played by Slezak…was not. Did Gillian leave OLTL to go to ATWT? Did she also play Niki, or did the multiple personalities stuff not happen until Slezak? I was never a big OLTL viewer, but I do remember in high school a bunch of us watching it and getting a hoot out of Slezak in the red wig and leather miniskirts.\n\nI’m not bashing Slezak, she’s clearly a great actress, just wasn’t a Viki fan. When I *did* watch, I preferred Dorian.\n\nI hate that when they brought back Debbi Morgan, Darnell Williams, and (briefly) Laurence Lau, Marcy Walker had sort of retired from acting and gone into the ministry. It would have been so awesome to have those four back together…they brought on Jamie Luner as Liza, or should I say “Liza” since she was basically a new character. Liza is now a lawyer??? And a decade younger than the her former classmates?? Jamie Luner was not bad at all, but they should have made her Julie Chandler, who left Pine Valley…to attend law school! It was a missed opportunity. Julie was related to the Kanes, Chandlers, and Cortlandts; lots of possibilities there.\n\nAs for Liza, if they did want to bring her back, I would have loved to have seen someone like Beth Chamberlin or Eileen Davidson.\n\nR527- I was a Y&R watcher and OLTL FREAK (hated AMC) and even + I +watched Natalie in the well- I was addicted for a good 6 months! It was soap opera gold- and I really loved Kate.\n\nIn fact I have never even searched for this stuff on Youtube and cannot wait to check it out!\n\nAnd yes, AMC skyrocketed in the ratings at a time when OLTL was sinking- OLTL could not even benefit from AMC's MASSIVE surge.. It was a crazy time.\n\nDefinitely the end of all of the soaps heyday. OJ destroyed it all soon after-\n\nI forgot that Barbara and Tom hooked up. As a kid in the 1980s I always found Tom to be a bore, but recently upon looking at pictures of him from when he was married to Erica, turns out he was a stone cold fox, though, I think he was always a bit of a bore as a character.\n\nThe actress who played Barbara always reminded me of a classier version of Stepfanie Kramer, like if she played DeeDee on Hunter, she would NOT have worn jeans and pumps together.\n\nToday I watched last night’s SNL and host Michael B. Jordan played a clip from AMC when he was 16 and playing Reggie. I also just started Shotgun Wedding with Josh Duhamel on Prime. I can’t think of many other actors who “made it” outside of AMC, but they did have a lot of actresses who went on to bigger roles outside of daytime…Sarah Michelle Gellar, Amanda Seyfried, Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Ripa, Melissa Leo, Lacey Chabret, Lauren Holly…\n\nI thought Michael E. Knight would have had a more successful career outside of daytime, but it never really worked out for him and he was wise to go back to AMC.\n\nHmmm, could be r555. That sounds about right. Barbara was a good character. Bitchy, but also had some good qualities. They kind of ruined her character in the 2000’s when they brought Sean, Barbara’s son with Travis, to Pine Valley, and revealed that Barbara was a terrible, absent mother. That went against her last major storyline…having two babies (Molly and Sean) she loved very much..so much that she had one to “save” the other via bone marrow.\n\nBut that was pretty par for the course the last decade or so of AMC…having characters behave like they absolutely would NOT (see Tad burying a man alive, Janet killing Trevor, Liza becoming an attorney, etc., etc.)\n\nI was a baby when AMC premiered, r560, but Nick Davis was the catalyst for one of the first major stories when AMC premiered in 1970. From what I understand, Ruth Brent (before she married Joe Martin) was raising her sister Amy’s (played by ATWT star Rosemary Prinz) illegitimate son Phil as her own. Nick was his real father, and he had found out and came back to Pine Valley to be near his son. I think Erica found out the truth and tortured Nick with it, since she hated him and didn’t like that Nick was friends with Erica’s mother, Mona. In typical soap fashion, Erica and Nick eventually started fucking, even though he was old enough to be her father, and Mona caught them in bed together.\n\nI *loved* Mona. My mother in law looks a lot like her!\n\nKendall came first when Erica was 15.\n\nThe unabortion was conceived when Erica was married to Jeff Martin, so when she was in her early 20s or so. That storyline, combined with Zoe/Zarf, caused me to give up on AMC.\n\nIf they wanted to give Erica another child, or give the Martins an extra grandchild, they could have dome a lot of other things. For example, maybe Erica and Jeff had a one night stand off camera and Erica gave birth to their child during one of Susan Lucci’s maternity leaves.\n\nIn 1995, Langley's elder daughter, Verla Grubbs (Carol Burnett), came back to Pine Valley to seeking Langley's blessing as she was about to wed. Langley made his final appearance in December 1995, at Pine Valley Hospital where he was helping put up Christmas decorations in the halls.\n\nLangley remained in Pine Valley for a while, but due to Louis Edmonds's health problems, he was written out of the show in April 1997 as being in Egypt on archeological digs. When Edmonds died in 2001, the writers chose to not have Langley die, but rather have him become an unseen character. He was last mentioned in a current context in August 2002, when he missed Brooke's wedding because he was on business in South Africa.\n\nWhen Phoebe died in 2005, Brooke said that Phoebe's last words were \"Langley is waiting for me.\" This confirmed that sometime between August 2002 and May 2005, Langley died."
