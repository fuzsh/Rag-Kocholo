        "meta_description": "SNEAK PEEK – WEEK OF APRIL 5\r\n\r\n📷 \r\nGreenlee suspects that pretty much everyone she trusts in Pine Valley (and even some people she doesn't trust!) is hiding something from her. And she's right. That \"something\" is the fact that her BFF Kendall is the one who ran her off the road to her \"death\" last year -- but Greenlee doesn't know that yet. Being the smart cookie she is, however, Greens does figure out that Kendall -- who doesn't know she's alive (guess she has bad cell service?) -- holds the key. So it's off to Kendall she goes. \n\nLook for Alicia Minshew to return this week -- and come face-to-face with her frenemy. The truth will come out! It's Kendall/Greenlee at their finest ...\n \n\n📷 \r\nTad, Liza, and Adam all rush to the hospital when they find out that Colby and Damon have been involved in a car accident. While the kids are going to be fine, the group is stunned to discover the other driver is Brooke -- and she's not fine. As she's rushed off to surgery, the cause of the accident is revealed: Damon was texting and driving. (Someone obviously does not watch Oprah !) This could cause major problems with the troublemaker's probation officer. Meanwhile, look for Adam to stay by Brooke's side as she fights for her life -- complete with fabulous flashbacks! \n\n📷 JR's plan for Annie goes into full motion this week -- despite a temporary hurdle caused by Brooke's accident. What is that plan exactly? See, JR is planning on SEDUCING Annie. What?! He's confident his plan will make his father realize how lethal and insincere Annie truly is. OK, his marriage to Marissa is a technicality -- the ends justify the means. But what JR doesn't expect is what happens next ... \nMeanwhile, David's trial begins -- and it quickly becomes a matter of life or death for someone! \n\nAll this, PLUS: Tad jumps into a new line of work; Amanda starts modeling; Madison's gambling problems come back to haunt her; and Angie realizes why she's so drawn to Damon. \n\nWant a preview of the entire month of April?  You can get it at SOAPnet.com.  \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOKaye.  Where do I start?  I had assumed Kendall would come running back to PV when she hears her BFF ( 📷 ) is alive, but it looks like The Green One goes looking for Kendall!  That makes me even more angry, when EVERYONE, including the Queen of Maddling Erica Kane is letting Zen have some peace, The Green One is the one to  \"figure out that Kendall -- who doesn't know she's alive (guess she has bad cell service?) -- holds the key. So it's off to Kendall she goes.\"      Here is one person who has caused so much grief for Slaters, not just in 2007, but indirectly in 2009 also.  I mean, little Ian would not have had so many issues with his heart and the surgeries and all, if it weren't for the Green One.  That would have spared us of the whole aftermath of \"who killed Stuart\" that caused so much pain for Zach and his family!  And that jab about bad cell service is not funny.  If whoever wrote this shit were watching the show, they would know that Erica has purposely not called Kendall with the news!  UGH! \n\n What else irks the crap out of me about this sneak peek?   \"Tad jumps into a new line of work\" !   📷  📷  📷 \n\nBut......... it's a holiday weekend, so I will end this on a positive note :  I am glad ABC is jumping on Oprah's Don't Text While Driving bandwagon!  I hope the writers won't louse it up though. \r\n\r\nOh, and a quiz for everyone:  Whose back is this on the yacht?  Looks like some short-haired mahn in peach shirt?  📷  📷  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n   All My Children \n\r\n\r\n  WEEKDAYS 1 PM/12 PM PT/C \r\n\r\n   📷 \r\n\r\n      📷  \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n   📷 \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n   📷 \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n   📷 \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n ETA:\nOKaye, here is Soapnet's April 2010 Preview with more Zach mention and a little larger picture 📷  Dark Brown font are my comments .\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n      \r\n\r\n All My Children : April 2010 Preview\r\n\r\n\r\n  April 1, 2010 3:36 PM By   Erica Brown     📷 April is an exciting, crazy, romantic, heart-breaking, and shocking month on All My Children -- and that's no joke. Many beloved characters return, a surprising duo has sex, people leave town, and a death rocks Pine Valley. Seriously, folks -- this is one month that can't be missed. Just keep reading ...\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  First off, Zach and Kendall are baaacckkk!  See, Greenlee knows all of Pine Valley is hiding something from her -- and she's determined to find out what that is. Remember when her BFF Kendall ran her off the road to her \"death\" last year? Well, Greenlee has no idea. Being the smart cookie she is, however, Greens does figure out that Kendall -- who doesn't know she's alive (guess she has bad cell service?) -- holds the key.  She tracks Kendall and Zach down  and confronts her frenemy. Get ready guys, because it's classic Greenlee and Kendall. Kendall does confess she ran her friend off the road (by accident, of course) -- and the way Greens reacts shocks everyone. We can't wait!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  Speaking of Zach and Kendall: When Greenlee, Erica, and Ryan all come back into their lives, they are forced to make a super tough decision ... is it finally time for them to return home?  \n  (WHY, OH WHY does The Rage Monkey need to come back into their lives?  UGH!)  \n\r\n     \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n   The death of the beloved James Mitchell is also addressed this month when Palmer passes away too. Everyone in Pine Valley is devastated by Palmer's death -- and you'll be surprised by the person who takes it the hardest. As the town gathers to say goodbye, expect to see some familiar faces: Daisy and Nina! And look for Palmer's death to springboard exciting new stories. Want more on that?   See what new headwriters Donna Swajeski and David Kreizman's plans are for the Cortlandt legacy.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks to Damon's irresponsible texting-while-driving, Brooke is involved in a serious car crash. Luckily, Damon and Colby (who was in the car with him) are OK, but Brooke is another issue. As she is rushed off to surgery, Adam vows to stay by her side as she fights for her life. And get ready for some fabulous flashbacks to go along with that. It's obvious these two want each other -- but Adam's married, and Brooke's not exactly the \"other woman\" type ...\r\n\r\nAs been previously reported, David Canary is set to retire as Adam Chandler. April is THE month to see how this exit plays out -- what will happen with Adam and Brooke? With Annie? Don't expect Adam to leave the canvas without delivering one last Chandler curveball. Let's just say that Adam's presence will remain in Pine Valley for a long, long time as a huge new story kicks off.\r\n\r\n David's trial begins this month, but when he finds out Greenlee has come face-to-face with Kendall, he's more concerned about his wife than his freedom. Greenlee has a surprise of her own in store for David, though. Actually ... make that two.   (And I wonder if that means she drags Zach and Kendall back to PV!  If she does, that will be just one more thing I will NEVER forgive her for!)  \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI am leaving out Tad The Cad Turned Dad, Jamanda, Jerica, Brotalia, etc. etc. etc., but I thought some of you might be interested in Palmer/Adam/Brooke, so I have included them.",

All through the first 40 minutes today, the message has been loud and clear: Slaters are very, VERY bad people! Liza, the one person I thought would not betray Zach, wants to go after ZACH and Kendall to save her worthless client (Dr. Death, for those who don't know. David told Liza that Zach covered up for Kendall and kept it out of the press), JackASS is always in Erica's face about how HISDAUGHTER deserves to know the truth, David chants the mantra of how Kendall has already hurt the poor little Green Gnome too much (of course, he wasn't in PV when The Green Gnome drove Spikey off a cliff in the act of kidnapping him, and all the aftermath that put Little Ian on the operating table multiple times already, and all the strain that those events put on Slaters' marriage)! I have a feeling Zach and Kendall will be dragged to PV, only to be lashed and whipped by the criminals themselves. Not to mention, we will be subjected to seeing Kendall in close proximity to the LITTLE FUCKER, ugh! Like Peggy said, Just more of the same!\n\nI hope Zach decides enough is enough and moves to Llanview at the end of the week!"
