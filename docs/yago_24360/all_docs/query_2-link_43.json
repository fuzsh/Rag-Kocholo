        "text": "Brooke is a sought after relationship coach and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. She teaches folks how to learn to give and receive the love they deeply desire.\n\n“I bring a diverse array of experience, education, and heritage to my work. Since 2011, I have been supporting high level executives, founders, artists and renegade types and their families in recovering from crises, trauma, burnout, and relationship troubles as well as supporting the growth and well-being of their companies and communities. Before becoming a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, I worked as a high school English teacher in neighborhoods with high concentrations of crime and poverty. I have walked alongside those celebrated in society as well as those society would like to forget. “\n\nSince childhood, Brooke has demonstrated giftedness in intuition, spiritual awareness, and empathy. She has nurtured these gifts through the formal disciplines of Marriage and Family Therapy, Theology, Literature, Sociology, and Gender Studies.\n\nWith a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and a Master of Arts in Marriage, Family and Child Counseling with an emphasis in spiritual/psychological integration, her perspective is depth and systems oriented; she understands and appreciates the myriad, complex, and unseen forces that affect our ability to feel fulfilled and happy in our relationships. In addition to her work in private practice and consulting, she has served as both clinical supervisor, clinical director, and individual, group and family therapist to many facilities in Southern California that treat chemical dependency, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. This experience has provided a broad understanding for the systemic issues that haunt and sabotage our society and American families.\n\n“I have continued my post graduate work in a unique form of Embodied Expression through S Factor —a dance practice that encourages the fullest expression of the female body. I continue to study and receive mentorship in psychedelic psychotherapy integration, polyvagal theory, and attachment theory. I am always a student. “\n\nShe has a particular interest in entrepreneurial mental health, recovery from religious fundamentalism and trauma, divorce recovery, modern dating and modern marriage, women's body image and disordered eating, and supporting healthy romantic partnerships as a vehicle to creating a more stable and vibrant society.\n\nIn addition to working with her own clients, she provides consultation services through ZenFounder, an organization dedicated to supporting entrepreneurs’ mental health and relationship needs.\n\n(Read more about ZenFounder here)."
