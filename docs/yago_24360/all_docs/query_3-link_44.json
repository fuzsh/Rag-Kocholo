        "text": "Brooke History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe name Brooke was carried to England in the enormous movement of people that followed the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Brooke family lived in Essex. The name, however, derives from the family's former residence in Broc, in the area of Anjou, France. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Brooke family\n\nThe surname Brooke was first found in Essex. Medieval forms of the name are Ate-Broc, Atte-Broc, Attenbroke and was more often than not pluralized to Brooks and Brookes in modern times. 2\n\nOriginally from the Norman \"Broc,\" meaning \"a stream\" or \"at the brook,\" one of the first references was of Robert le Broc and Ranyllph le Broc, two knights having estates in Essex in the year 1119. A few years later, Eustace delbroc was listed in the Pipe Rolls of Northumberland in 1130 and Rand de Broc was listed in the Pipe Rolls of Hampshire in 1157. 3\n\nThe Testa de Nevill, sive Liber Feodorum, temp. Henry III-Edward I, listed Edelina del Brok. Henry III-Edward I 4\n\nEarly in the 13th century, William de la Broke was listed in the Curia Regis Rolls of Surrey in 1208 and Emma de Brokes was listed in the same source but in Suffolk in 1220. 3 The Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 list Alice de la Broke and Laurence del Broc. 5 In Somerset, William atte Brouke was listed there, 1 Edward III (during the first year of King Edward III's reign.) 6\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Brooke family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Brooke research. Another 204 words (15 lines of text) covering the years 1214, 1512, 1532, 1545, 1560, 1563, 1569, 1592, 1601, 1602, 1608, 1614, 1632, 1643, 1646, 1648, 1652, 1655, 1660, 1664, 1676, 1680, 1683, 1685 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Brooke History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBrooke Spelling Variations\n\nEndless spelling variations are a prevailing characteristic of Norman surnames. Old and Middle English lacked any definite spelling rules, and the introduction of Norman French added an unfamiliar ingredient to the English linguistic stew. French and Latin, the languages of the court, also influenced spellings. Finally, Medieval scribes generally spelled words according to how they sounded, so one person was often referred to by different spellings in different documents. The name has been spelled Brook, Brooke, Brookes, Brooks, Brecks, Broocks and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Brooke family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nRichard Brooke (died 1569), Sheriff of Cheshire in 1563, he bought the manor of Norton, Cheshire from Henry VIII in 1545 following the dissolution of the monasteries\n\nJohn Brooke, (died 1660) 1st Baron Cobham, an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1614 and 1643\n\nSir Henry Brooke, 1st Baronet (died 1664), an English soldier and politician\n\nRobert Brooke, Sr. (1602-1655), a Colonial Governor of Maryland for several months in 1652\n\nSir Peter Brooke (died 1685), an English politician, Member of Parliament for Newton (1646-1648)\n\nMajor Thomas Brooke, Sr., Esq.

The voyage was extremely difficult, though, and the cramped, dank ships caused many to arrive in the New World diseased and starving. But for those who made it, the trip was most often worth it. Many of the families who arrived went on to make valuable contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. An inquiry into the early roots of North American families reveals a number of immigrants bearing the name Brooke or a variant listed above:\n\nBrooke Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nWilliam Brooke, who arrived in Virginia in 1621 8\n\nThomas Brooke, who arrived in Watertown, Massachusetts in 1631 8\n\nRobert Brooke, from Maidstone, who arrived in New England in 1634 aboard the ship \"Hercules\" 8\n\nMrs. Anne Brooke, from Maidstone, who arrived in New England in 1634 aboard the ship \"Hercules\" 9\n\nThomas Brooke, from Maidstone, who arrived in New England in 1634 aboard the ship \"Hercules\" 9\n\n...

(More are available in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.)\n\nBrooke migration to West Indies +\n\nThe British first settled the British West Indies around 1604. They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 17\n\nBrooke Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Barnable Brooke, (b. 1615), aged 20, British settler traveling aboard the ship \"William and John\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 18\n\nMr. William Brooke, (b. 1609), aged 26, British settler travelling aboard the ship \"Expedition\" arriving in Barbados in 1636 19\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Brooke (post 1700) +\n\nHenry James Brooke (1771-1857), English crystallographer, born at Exeter; he discovered thirteen new mineral species 20\n\nCharles Brooke (1804-1879), English surgeon and inventor, son of the well-known mineralogist, Henry James Brooke 20\n\nSir Arthur de Capell Brooke (1791-1858), of Oakley Hall, Northamptonshire, English author of several works of travel, descended from a family originally settled in Cheshire, born in Bolton Street, Mayfair 20\n\nJocelyn Brooke (1908-1966), English author of several unusual and semi-autobiographical novels as well as some poetry\n\nPeter Leonard Brooke CH, PC (1934-2023), Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, a British politician, Secretary of State for National Heritage (1992-1994), Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1989-1992), Paymaster General (1987-1989)\n\nLieutenant Commander Margaret Brooke MBE (1915-2016), Canadian nursing sister during the Second World War from Ardath, Saskatchewan; for her actions during the sinking of Caribou she was named as a Member of the Order of the British Empire on January 1, 1943, eponym of the HMCS Margaret Brooke\n\nSir Henry Brooke CMG PC (1936-2018), British jurist, Lord Justice of Appeal in 1996, Vice-President of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 2003\n\nEdward William Brooke III (1919-2015), American politician, United States Senator from Massachusetts (1967-1979), recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nFrances Moore Brooke (1724-1789), English novelist who followed her husband to Canada where he was a chaplain to the garrison at Quebec, where she wrote her four-volume \"History of Emily Montague,\" based on Canadian life\n\nSub-Lieutenant Frances Haffey Brooke -Smith GC (1918-1952), British officer awarded the George Cross in the second world war while assigned to Atlantic convoy escort duties\n\n...

He died in 2016\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nThe Brooke Motto +\n\nThe motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Perseverando\n\nMotto Translation: By persevering.\n\nCitations +\n\nThe Norman People and Their Existing Descendants in the British Dominions and the United States Of America.
