Majorca, Spain!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIn the opening segment, as Erica is telling Kendall that she has arrived in Spain, Kendall turns around to find The Green Monster standing in front of her! (I guess I was wrong about Kendall appearing at 12:55 in today's episode. Now she really has two full episodes before we get to see Zach!)\n\nBut before that scene, JackASSHOLE prompted me to blurt out a few choice words when he said for the 4,279th time that HIS DAUGHTER deserves to hear the truth! Did THE TRUTH matter to him when it was HIS DAUGHTER that drove Spikey off the road? No, he instructed the bitch to keep her mouth shut, and HE also kept shut to protect her\n\nAnd The DEADTOME Liza tried (and thankfully failed) to bring Zach's name into Dr. Death's poison pills for Adam!\n\nAnd worst of the worst: The Li'l Fucker suddenly misses HISSON, claiming he is being kept away from his child, called it a father's worst nightmare (he has no idea what he is talking about, esp. since he ain't much of a father), accuses Kendall of only calling when she knows he is busy or asleep, accuses Slaters of NOT BEING STRAIGHT WITH HIM about them being away for months \"it wasn't supposed to go on for this long\"!!!!! \"I am not saying they kidnapped Spike or anything\" WOW, that's swell of you!!!!!!!!! And now he is hopping on a plane to be there! FUCKER, I hope his plane crashes so he wouldn't infect Zach's (and mine too) paradise Majorca! Fucking TIIC, they HAVE TO bring the asshole into Zach's few precious moments\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI don't know how the fucker can even utter the words that Slaters were not being straight with him! HE is the one who always played under-handed games, describing his own actions as \"sneaky\", he is the one who has always played dirty with the most honorable man to ever walk into PV! And Kathy(km wilson)'s response is very accurate! There is a whole fleet of buses coming The Slater's way!\n\nAs angry as all this makes me, I know one thing for sure: TK and his Zach will mesmerize me for those three episodes as always! He will make sense out of all the most senseless shit that the \"writers\" are trying to shove down my throat! He will give us his best! And this time, my heart will really, really break, knowing that Zach is leaving my screen for good!\n\n__________________\n\n************************************** Thorsten Kaye Fan Forever!!!!! ************************************** Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy! What's worse? Watching Joonyer and Annie romp or a tearful, remorse-filled Kendall saying \"I am sorry\" to the worthless, soulless, emotionless DPW (Thanks Kathy, for refreshing my memory about her correct name)? I wish Kendall did not say that Zach covered up to save her from incriminating herself, but that he did it to save her stress because of her heart surgery and coma, etc. Now, DPW is lumping Zach into her list of enemies\n\nAs is the norm with AMC, history is being rewritten! Anyone surprised? I didn't think so. Kendall started comparing DPW's situation with her own (DPW can't understand why no one would tell her the truth since she came out of her coma, and Kendall saying it was same when she woke up from her coma). According to Kendall, everybody was afraid that she would not be able to handle the truth about Zach being the donor. Hello? It took Binks 2.7 seconds to brag about it, even though she had promised Zach that she would let HIM tell her! Stupid, stupid writers! Oh, and of course, DPW now claims that there was no accident, that Kendall did it because she wanted The Cup Holder to herself all along\n\nBut we got a glimpse of ZACH in a 3 second flashback, and my screen was on fire\n\n22 hours and 15 minutes to go.....................\n\n__________________\n\n************************************** Thorsten Kaye Fan Forever!!!!! **************************************"
