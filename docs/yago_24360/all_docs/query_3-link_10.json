        "text": "BROOKE Baldwin became a household name through her work on CNN between 2008 and 2021.\n\nTowards the latter years of Baldwin's CNN career, she married her now-ex, James Fletcher — here's all we know about him and if they had children.\n\nWho is Brooke Baldwin’s ex-husband, James Fletcher?\n\nBrooke Baldwin was previously married to James Fletcher, an English producer and director.\n\nFletcher previously worked on the TV documentary The Cameron Years, which was about former British Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nHe was also the producer and director of the political documentary The Accidental President.\n\nThe film features his ex-wife, Baldwin, and documents how Donald Trump came to be president when everyone predicted that Hillary Clinton would win.\n\nAccording to his IMDb, Fletcher was also listed as the associated producer for the 2018 film Children of the Snow Land.\n\nThat same year, he and Baldwin tied the knot on May 5, 2018, at Liberty Farms in New York.\n\nThe pair reportedly met at a holiday party, and after dating for two years, they got engaged in 2017.\n\nShe told her Instagram followers about the proposal writing: \"Back from vacation. Turns out we went to Hawaii to celebrate more than just my birthday.. @jamesfletchernyc asked me to marry him! And I said YES!”\n\nThe former couple were together for nearly five years before Baldwin filed for divorce in February 2023.\n\nIn a statement, she said: \"After nearly five years of marriage, with love and respect, James and I have decided to go our separate ways.\n\n\"Our time together has been some of the most precious, defining, and awakening years of my life.\n\n\"I wish him nothing but the best as he begins this new chapter.\"\n\nDo Brooke Baldwin and James Fletcher have children?\n\nThroughout their relationship, Baldwin and Fletcher did not have any children.\n\nIn an essay via Garden & Gun, Baldwin recalls how she rebelled from the norms placed on her growing up in a Southern household.\n\n\"I can still see my mom chasing me through our home in Atlanta: 'Brooke, please put on some blush!',\" she wrote.\n\n\"And, oh yeah . . . getting married in your twenties and having babies soon after.\n\n\"When I was younger, I pushed back on so much of this.\"\n\nShe said she found her calling in her \"rebellion,\" eventually leading her to create the CNN series American Woman.\n\n\"I believe part of my life’s calling is to support other women, to give them a voice, and to inspire,\" she said.\n\n\"And as far as being a Southern woman in Manhattan: As I’ve gotten older, I have never been prouder of my roots.\"\n\nWhat has Brooke Baldwin said about her divorce?\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair in 2024, Baldwin said she has been \"experiencing a rebirth\" since her divorce.\n\n\"Part of my own unraveling meant I became a believer in divorce. Including my divorce, so to speak, from CNN,\" she said.\n\n\"Like my marriage ending, it was painful. I miss being a vessel for information and clarity and news—the good and the bad.\n\n\"I miss my audience. But I’m experiencing a rebirth. As with a forest fire, you can burn out the debris and foster new growth.\n\nShe went on to say she has found her voice since.\n\n\"And it turns out that once you find your voice, you can’t unfind it,\" Baldwin said.\n\nFollowing her divorce, Baldwin confirmed she had moved on and began dating filmmaker and journalist Peter Landesman in July 2023."
