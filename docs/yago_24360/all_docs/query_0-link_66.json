        "text": "The 1940s slang came out of a unique time when the United States was rebounding from the Great Depression and becoming embroiled in World War II, a situation that would actually help set up the economic growth the country enjoyed at the end of the decade. Many new slang words became part of everyday dialogue during this decade.\n\nIf you are looking for some funny Southern words or sayings, then you are in the right place. The American South — the states south of the Mason-Dixon line that divides the USA into horizontal halves — has a culture, humor and slang all its own. Discover some uniquely Southern words and phrases that portray a special kind of wisdom found only in the South."
