Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nHere are 19 Hollywood heartthrobs who have never been married.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Hamm had a serious girlfriend for almost 20 years but has never actually tied the knot.\n\nHe's known as the dreamy star of \"Mad Men,\" but Jon Hamm has never been married before. The actor split with his longtime girlfriend, actress, writer, and director Jennifer Westfeldt, in 2015 after being together for 18 years. However, while some handsome Hollywood bachelors embrace the single life, Hamm seemed a little bit more forlorn about it.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with InStyle, the 49-year-old actor opened up about his breakup from Westfeldt, 51, saying, \"It's hard to be single after being together for a long time. It's really hard. It sucks.\"\n\nThe \"Baby Driver\" star was reportedly dating \"Saturday Night Live\" producer Lindsay Shookus, who also previously dated Ben Affleck, but is now dating his former \"Mad Men\" costar, Anna Osceola, US Weekly confirmed in June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael B. Jordan, who was just named People's Sexiest Man Alive, likes to keep his dating life very private.\n\nThe 34-year-old \"Black Panther\" actor has never settled down or even had many high-profile relationships. The bachelor doesn't want to be single forever, however.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Essence, he said, \"One of my biggest fears is ending up being alone. Not having what my mom and dad have because the times are so different and my circumstances … I don't want to work less, you know? So the more I work, the more, you know, seen or known you are … the more you're sought after [and you have less genuine options].\"\n\nHis life as a bachelor hasn't impeded his status as a heartthrob, judging by his recent accolade of People's Sexiest Man Alive.\n\n\"It's a good club to be part of,\" he told the magazine.\n\nJordan is now in a relationship with actress Lori Harvey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is Hollywood's most notable bachelor and has yet to settle down.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio stole our hearts when he played floppy-haired Jack Dawson in \"Titanic,\" but the bachelor has perhaps never found his own one true love.\n\nThe actor has been known to date many models — he even dated world-famous supermodel Gisele Bündchen before she tied the knot with Tom Brady.\n\nDiCaprio has received some criticism for dating women much younger than him — the 46-year-old is currently seeing 23-year-old Camila Morrone. However, sources say the couple is more serious than some of his past relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamie Foxx split from Katie Holmes after six years.\n\nLeading man Jamie Foxx, 53, has never been married before, but the star did share a six-year-long relationship with Katie Holmes. People wondered if they were possibly married or engaged when Holmes was spotted wearing a diamond ring in 2016, while Foxx was seen wearing a gold band.\n\nHowever, Foxx's rep told People at the time that the movie stars were not engaged or married, setting the speculations to rest. In 2019, Foxx and Holmes called it quits. While the star was previously rumored to be dating model Dana Caprio, according to InTouch Weekly, he was recently spotted on a date with a mystery woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot much is known about \"Schitt's Creek\" star Dan Levy's romantic history.\n\nEmmy Award winner and \"Schitt's Creek\" star Dan Levy may have just been named one of People's sexiest men alive, but very little is known about the actor's personal life. In 2015, while Levy was still creating his show, he told Out Magazine that he was single. However, since then, he's been careful to not let the public into his love life.\n\n\"I've been single for a bit. It's a strange thing. I don't know whether it's an excuse that I'm telling myself or whether it's just what it is, but I feel like this job has consumed my life. I feel like I only get one shot at this,\" he said. \"I hope that I can find someone when it's all done, or when things are a little bit more smooth.\"\n\nAs far as we know, the 37-year-old actor is still waiting to find his very own Patrick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Cusack has never been married, and little is known about the \"Say Anything\" heartthrob's love life.\n\nJohn Cusack, who memorably played the lovable and lovesick Lloyd in the 1989 coming-of-age drama \"Say Anything,\" has never been married. Though the actor has a number of high-profile exes such as Jennifer Love Hewitt and Uma Thurman, 54-year-old Cusack has kept tight-lipped about his relationships since 2011.\n\nIn an interview with Elle Magazine in 2009, the publication asked Cusack to describe in five words or fewer why he has never married. The actor responded, \"I can do it in seven: 'Society doesn't tell me what to do.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOwen Wilson has fathered three children with three different women but has never been married.\n\n\"Wedding Crashers\" actor Owen Wilson, 51, reportedly had a child with his personal trainer while she was still married, albeit separated from her husband at the time.\n\nWilson also shares a child, 10-year-old Robert Ford, with ex-girlfriend Jade Duell, and 2-year-old Lyla with ex Varunie Vongsvirates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might know British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor from his role as Solomon Northup in \"12 Years a Slave,\" but the actor has kept his love life under wraps.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor is said to be dating model Frances Aaternir after splitting from his previous girlfriend, Sari Mercer, in 2015.\n\nWhen the Guardian asked in 2015 if Ejiofor considered himself a \"loner,\" the actor, 43, responded saying, \"Yeah, I think so. I love the company of people. But ultimately I feel like I'm self-reliant, yeah ... I think I've always been that way. I don't think I've ever required the company of people, in order to feel good or to feel access to the world.\"\n\n\"It's something that to me, when it's good, it's a bonus,\" he continued. \"Like great art or great music – it's nice that it's there. But if it's not there ... it's not like everything falls away. I can completely exist without it, be satisfied and happy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZac Efron's most high-profile relationship was with his \"High School Musical\" costar Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nThe couple split in 2010 — yes, over a decade ago! — and though the actor has been linked to multiple celebrities since, nothing has been confirmed until recently.\n\nThe 33-year-old actor is now said to be dating an Australian model and waitress named Vanessa Valladares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeanu Reeves recently confirmed his relationship status but has never tied the knot.\n\nKeanu Reeves made headlines when he seemingly confirmed his relationship with artist Alexandra Grant. The 56-year-old actor is extremely private when it comes to his relationships, and he has never been married.\n\nWhile some sources say that he and Winona Ryder accidentally tied the knot while filming \"Dracula,\" the two have both laughed it off and never confirmed that the marriage was legitimate.\n\nReeves is now dating LA-based artist Alexandra Grant, 47, after going public at the LACMA Art + Film Gala. However, the couple is said to have been dating for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Criminal Minds\" star Shemar Moore is one of the most desired men on TV.\n\nShemar Moore has been linked to \"Quantico\" actress Anabelle Acosta and professional soccer player Shawna Gordon. The actor, 50, is now reportedly single. However, he hasn't given up hope on finding love and starting a family.\n\n\"I need balance in my life. I love what I do for a living, I love it from 'action' to 'cut', but I also want to walk my dogs, travel, get married, have kids,\" Moore told TVLine in 2016. \"I want balance, and it's hard to do with the schedule that we have.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Pattinson was engaged once but didn't make it down the aisle.\n\nPattinson has had high-profile relationships over the years. While his relationship with \"Twilight\" costar Kristen Stewart made headlines over and over again, the actor was also engaged to musician FKA Twigs before they split in 2017.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with the Sunday Times, Pattinson opened up about his discontent over having his personal relationships in the public eye: \"If you let people in, it devalues what love is. If a stranger on the street asked you about your relationship, you'd think it extremely rude. If you put up a wall it ends up better. I can't understand how someone can walk down the street holding hands, and it's the same as when I do it and a hundred people are taking your photo.\"\n\nRobert Pattinson, 34, is now dating model Suki Waterhouse.\n\nRami Malek, who won the Oscar for his role in \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" has never been married.\n\nWhile the Oscar-winner, 39, might not have tied the knot yet, he's been publicly dating his \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" costar and love interest Lucy Boynton, 27, since 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Pine is not married and has never been engaged.\n\nThe 40-year-old actor has been linked to Olivia Munn and Dominique Piek. When he and Piek split in 2013, the actor reportedly spoke to Out Magazine, saying, \"It's really hard in our business to maintain something. For me, right now, it'd be really hard.\"\n\nPine is now reported to be dating 36-year-old British actress Annabelle Wallis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan Gosling shares two children with his partner Eva Mendes.\n\nRyan Gosling won our hearts when he appeared alongside Rachel McAdams in \"The Notebook.\" While the 40-year-old star has been dating Eva Mendes for years, and the couple shares two children together, they have never tied the knot.\n\nThey are extremely private and share very few details about their relationship. While some outlets have reported the two are secretly married, nothing has been confirmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nHollywood Celebrities\n\nAdvertisement"
