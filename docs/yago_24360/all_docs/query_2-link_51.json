        "text": "Shakespeare’s Prologue\n\nTwo households, both alike in dignity,\n\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\n\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\n\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\n\nFrom forth the fatal loins of these two foes\n\nA pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;\n\nWhose misadventured piteous overthrows\n\nDo with their death bury their parents’ strife.\n\nThe fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,\n\nAnd the continuance of their parents’ rage,\n\nWhich, but their children’s end, nought could remove,\n\nIs now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;\n\nThe which if you with patient ears attend,\n\nWhat here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.\n\nBrooke’s ‘Argument’\n\nLove hath inflamed twain by sudden sight.\n\nAnd both do grant the thing that both desire.\n\nThey wed in shrift by counsel of a friar.\n\nYoung Romeus climes fair Juliet’s bower by night.\n\nThree months he doth enjoy his chief delight.\n\nBy Tybalt’s rage, provoked unto ire,\n\nHe payeth death to Tybalt for his hire.\n\nA banished man he ‘scapes by secret flight.\n\nNew marriage is offered to his wife.\n\nShe drinks a drink that seems to reave her breath.\n\nThey bury her, that sleeping yet hath life.\n\nHer husband hears the tidings of her death.\n\nHe drinks his bane. And she with Romeus knife,\n\nWhen she awakes, herself (alas) she slay’th."
