        "text": "Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke (born October 3, 1554, Beauchamp Court, Warwickshire, England—died September 30, 1628, Warwick) was an English writer who, on his tomb, styled himself “Servant to Q. Eliz., councellor to King James, and friend to Sir Philip Sidney,” but who is best remembered as a powerful philosophical poet and exponent of a plain style of writing.\n\nGreville’s Life of the Renowned Sir Philip Sidney (1652) is a valuable commentary on Elizabethan politics. His sonnet collection Caelica (first printed 1633) differed in tone from most Elizabethan cycles, its treatment being realistic and ironic. His mind was melancholy and Calvinistic, emphasizing the “wearisome condition of humanity,” torn between this world and God’s commands. His tragedies on Oriental themes traced the political results of this division, and his verse treatises showed how statesmen can best keep order in a naughty world. His poem “Humane Learning” was skeptical about the instruments and aims of earthly knowledge and, in stressing practical improvements, probably owed something to his friend Francis Bacon. Greville was a favourite of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\n\nAfter matriculating at the University of Cambridge in 1568, he was given a post in the Court of the Welsh Marches in 1576 but the next year went on an embassy to Europe—the first of several diplomatic missions—and later visited the Low Countries, Ireland, and France. Grants of land and minor offices enriched him, and in 1598 he became treasurer of the navy.\n\nBy alienating the influential Sir Robert Cecil, he forfeited immediate promotion to high office at James I’s accession but was made a Knight of the Bath. He later restored Warwick Castle (bestowed on him in 1605 by James) and wrote verse treatises and plays. His tact and business ability were finally rewarded: he was made chancellor of the Exchequer in 1614 and a baron in 1621.\n\nWorks definitely by Greville are Certaine learned and elegant workes (1633) and Remains (1670). The tragedy Mustapha was printed (probably piratically) in 1609, and some songs were set to music.\n\nHe never married but was “a constant courtier of the ladies.” He died of stab wounds inflicted by a disgruntled manservant."
