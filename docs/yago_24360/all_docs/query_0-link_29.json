        "text": "(to see images from this time period, visit Erica's biography on our main site)\n\nWith her marriage to Tom in shambles, Erica left Pine Valley to pursue a dream of acting (Susan Lucci was on maternity leave). Her turn as an actress failed, and after a stint at a health spa in Phoenix, Erica returned to Pine Valley only to find that she had a rival for Tom’s affections in Brooke English.\n\nErica managed to hold onto Tom until she returned to the modeling world after her disco closed. She became involved with executive Brandon Kingsley of Sensuelle Cosmetics, and when Tom found out, it was the end of Marriage #3 for Erica. Erica believed she’d found the perfect man in Brandon, and they began a passionate affair, but she was furious when she discovered that he was already married. Brandon had no intention of leaving his wife Sara and their children to marry Erica.\n\nFortunately for Erica, another man was waiting in the wings to boost her career and woo her away from Brandon: Kent Bogard. Kent bought Sensuelle out from under Brandon and set up a whole promotional campaign around Erica, naming her “An American Beauty,” and promising Erica her own line of beauty products.\n\nIn 1982, Erica’s seemingly perfect life in New York City was interrupted by her half-sister, Silver Kane. Silver was the result of Eric’s marriage to his second wife, Goldie (yes, Goldie and Silver), whom he married after he moved to Hollywood. Erica hired her younger, plainer half-sister as an assistant, unaware that Silver was secretly trying to sabotage her. After trying to make Erica look crazy, Silver then made herself over as a glamorous would-be model and slept with Kent.\n\nWhen Erica caught them together, she threatened to kill herself, but the gun went off, accidentally shooting Kent instead. Silver claimed Erica had deliberately murdered her fiancé. To avoid arrest, Erica went on the run, disguised as a nun and hiding out in Llanview (home of ‘One Life to Live’) for a while. She was eventually captured, arrested and sent to jail to await trial for murder. During the trial, it was revealed in dramatic fashion that Silver was really an imposter, a woman by the name of Connie Wilkes, and that she’d attempted to ruin Erica’s life. With her eyewitness testimony now called into question, Erica was found not guilty, and it was Silver/Connie who ended up in jail.\n\nKent’s father, Lars Bogard, set out to destroy Erica’s modeling career following the trial, so Erica partnered with Palmer Cortlandt to create a rival cosmetics company, Erica Kane Cosmetics, to compete with Lars’ Sensuelle Cosmetics.\n\nIn 1983, Erica hired writer Mike Roy to ghost write her autobiography in part as a marketing tool for the cosmetics venture with Palmer. She attempted to sugarcoat her life for Mike, but was thwarted by her brother Mark. While working on “Raising Kane,” Erica and Mike began a passionate relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, Adam Chandler bought the film rights to the book and did his best to woo Erica away from Mike. When Mike went to Tibet to write another book, Erica was left behind. Adam offered her the right to play herself in the film version of her book, but only if she married him. Mona and others tried to stop the wedding – even Erica had doubts and had a drunken one-night stand with her ex-husband, Tom Cudahy, the night before the wedding – but Adam and Erica married in 1984.\n\nAdam reneged on his offer to let Erica play herself in the film – most likely due to some very painful screen tests Erica did, demonstrating that she could model, but she couldn’t really act. Marriage to Adam offered Erica riches beyond anything she’d ever had, but it came at a price: Adam was jealous and controlling. During their marriage, Erica discovered Adam’s secret: he had a mentally ill identical twin brother, Stuart. Her friendship with Stuart proved to be the only bright spot in her marriage to Adam.\n\nWhen Mike Roy returned to Pine Valley, a jealous Adam decided to test Erica’s faith by faking his own death. Erica promptly ‘mourned’ him by marrying Mike. Adam attempted to return to Pine Valley and reveal himself as alive, only to end up kidnapped by Billy Clyde Tuggle and his girlfriend, Jewell. After some hilarious hijinks, Adam escaped, Billy Clyde was arrested, and Erica was devastated to realize her marriage to Mike was invalid. Adam offered Erica a life of luxury as his wife, but she chose to walk away from it all to be with Mike – but not before she liquidated as many of Adam’s assets as possible first while still Mrs. Chandler. In an attempt to speed up the divorce and stop Erica from bleeding him dry, Adam sent Stuart to the Caribbean for the quickie divorce in his place.\n\nErica planned a happy life with Mike, but while working on an undercover story on the drug trade with Brooke and Mark, Mike was shot and killed.\n\nIn 1985, Erica took a new job as editor of Tempo magazine. She met a former mercenary turned monk, Jeremy Hunter, who’d befriended Mike in Tibet. Jeremy was also an artist and began working for Erica at Tempo – and also tried to keep a jealous Adam away from her. Jeremy and Erica became friends and then fell in love, but he’d taken a vow of celibacy.\n\nTheir relationship was seriously tested when Jeremy’s former lover – and now stepmother – Natalie Hunter came to Pine Valley with her husband Alex. Natalie still wanted Jeremy, and Alex had his sights set on Erica. When Erica and Alex were believed dead in an avalanche, Natalie made her move: a drunken Jeremy woke up the next morning to find Natalie in his bed. Jeremy and Erica reunited and finally made love, but when Natalie turned up pregnant, Jeremy believed he was the father. Eventually it was revealed that Alex – who died during a fox hunt – was the father of Natalie’s son Timmy.\n\nJeremy and Erica were free to be together, but their happiness was short-lived. He was arrested for murdering Earl Mitchell. Erica staged a prison break so she and Jeremy could go on the run. Jeremy refused to leave on the helicopter with Erica, wanting to prove his innocence in court. He was eventually exonerated but it was too late for their relationship.\n\nErica then fell for southern gentleman, businessman and Senatorial candidate Travis Montgomery. Their whirlwind romance took a dramatic turn when Erica found out she was pregnant. She debated having another abortion, but Mark and Mona insisted she at least tell Travis she was pregnant.\n\nTravis wanted to marry Erica, but she refused, fearing he only wanted to marry her out of a sense of duty. Erica’s pregnancy included a kidnapping, a gunshot wound, and a bout with toxemia. They eventually married after Erica survived an attempted murder at the hands of Goldie Kane.\n\nBefore giving birth, Erica had a lengthy dream in which she confronted the men in her past – including her father – and came to realize that her mother was the one constant in her life, and she could provide that same loving relationship for her baby.\n\nErica’s daughter, Bianca Christine Montgomery, was born in February 1988, but happiness with Travis did not last. Travis carried out an insurance scam to raise the funds needed to prevent Adam Chandler from taking over his business. He hired Steven Andrews to kidnap him in order to cash in an insurance policy, but Andrews kidnapped baby Bianca instead and held her for ransom. They got Bianca back, but Erica was furious with Travis and went on the run with her daughter.\n\nTravis found Erica in Sea City where she was working as a waitress and then stopped Steven from trying to kidnap Erica and Bianca. On his way back to Pine Valley, Travis was mugged and beaten and developed amnesia as a result. Erica’s marriage crumbled and Travis temporarily reconciled with his ex-wife, Barbara.\n\nDuring this time, Erica, Travis, Jack and Barbara created Enchantment Cosmetics, and Erica served as CEO. Although she left Enchantment at various points in the 1990s, her involvement with the company continued until 2004 when it was folded into Cambias Enterprises.\n\nAfter her divorce, Erica moved on with Travis’ brother, Jackson Montgomery, and they began a passionate relationship in Paris, after Erica sneaked into his room dressed as a French maid. In 1989, she and Jack discovered that Erica’s father had faked his death to avoid creditors and was now working as a clown in a traveling circus. Despite warnings from Mona and Jack, Erica welcomed her father back into her life."
