        "text": "There's a reason All My Children actor David Canary calls the soap's 83-year-old creator, Agnes Nixon, \"a wonderful person packed with the devil.\" The petite Nixon may be all smiles, but in her imagination lives a long cast of characters responsible for some of the steamiest relationships and deranged scheming in the history of daytime television.\n\nFor her stories, Nixon draws deep. Erica Kane, for one, emerged from Nixon's own complicated relationship with her parents. As an only child of divorce growing up in Depression-era Nashville with virtually no contact with her father, Nixon knew what abandonment felt like. But she could never open up to her mother about it. So she created in Erica a needy woman who filled the void with every man in Pine Valley and wasn't shy about blaming her mother, Mona, for her emotional problems.\n\n\"Erica and I both have an abandonment complex, which is very valid,\" Nixon said during a visit to set in August in which she taped her last guest appearance on the show. \"Of course, the way I reacted to it is certainly not the way Erica has.\" Nixon was married 45 years before her husband died in 1996; Erica is engaged for the 12th time. \"One of the reasons I created her was that I wish I could have talked to my mother the way Erica talked to Mona. My mother would ask me if I missed having a daddy and I would say no. Where Erica would say, 'It's your fault he left!'\"\n\nToday, it's the fans of All My Children who are dealing with abandonment issues. When the soap signs off ABC on Sept. 23, it will leave a Susan Lucci-size hole in American popular culture, especially because Lucci hasn't decided if she's joining the web version being produced by Prospect Park. Erica Kane quickly became the world's most iconic soap character—songs were written about her, the first Mattel doll based on a daytime character was inspired by her, and Lucci became the first daytime star to host Saturday Night Live.\n\n\"In my eight-page audition scene, Agnes established character and history between Erica and Mona, and a real mother-daughter relationship where a 15-year-old girl was rolling her eyes at her mother like in real life,\" said Lucci, explaining why she has played Erica continuously since 1970. \"And Agnes brought so much humor to it, too. It was a role that immediately transcended and there was no reason for me to leave.\"\n\nAs a child, Nixon had dreamed of becoming an actress herself—but that quickly changed when she arrived at Northwestern University and saw future Oscar winners Patricia Neal and Cloris Leachman in action. \"'Oh my goodness,' I said to myself, 'Girl, you better write!'\" she recalls with a laugh.\n\nBut Nixon's father, who was paying for her education, wanted her to work in the family business—making burial garments. \"He was always telling me I had no ability as a writer,\" she said, and to prove it, he arranged a meeting, through a friend, with Guiding Light creator Irna Phillips, assuming she would reject his daughter's writing on the spot. Instead, she read a script Nixon wrote at Northwestern out loud in front of the recent graduate and then offered Nixon a job.\n\n\"I wrote 15 scripts a week and she paid me $100 a week,\" Nixon said. \"And there's never been that much money since because at that moment it was 'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God, Almighty, free at last from the burial garment company.\"\n\nNixon said Phillips, considered the mother of all soap opera writers, taught her the art of writing a continuous story. But more important, Phillips showed her how to hold her work in the highest regard—even when arranging someone's tenth marriage or killing a person for the second or third time. \"We really chafed and resented that 'soap opera' was used as a term of denigration in the '50s and '60s,\" said Nixon, who by 1958 was working as the head writer on Guiding Light. \"Irna respected what she did and she would tell me not to make fun of it all the way to the bank, you know?\"\n\nCurious by nature and fascinated by current events, Nixon sought to make her shows relevant. When a friend died of uterine cancer at age 40, Nixon decided to diagnose one of her characters on Guiding Light with the disease, to remind women about the importance of checkups. The year was 1963, and CBS and the show's owner, Procter & Gamble, balked. \"But I didn't give up.... And after six months they said, 'OK, but you can't use the words uterus, cancer, or hysterectomy. Other than that, do a smashing story!'\" When the storyline aired, CBS was flooded with mail from women thanking the network for saving their lives. \"They were underestimating the intelligence of viewers, which at that time was mostly women,\" said Nixon, who went on to become head writer of Another World, turning it into the No. 1 soap, and then was lured by ABC to jump ship and create One Life to Live, which premiered in 1968 during volatile times.\n\nOn One Life, Nixon wasted no time in exploring race relations with a poignant story about an African-American character who wasn't dark enough to get acting roles so she pretended to be white.\n\n\"As a child in the South to sit on a bus and see distinguished African-American adults walk past me to stand in the back, that does something to one,\" Nixon said. \"I think of myself as having atavistic guilt because I couldn't do anything about it. But it hurt me, and a as a writer, I made the decision to explore that and try to get people to examine their own prejudices.\"\n\n\"What I always wanted was to entertain people, first of all, but I also hope that I taught them a bit and out of that teaching, maybe some people rose out of their prejudices and their fears.\"\n\nBy the time she launched All My Children on Jan. 5, 1970, Nixon was eager to tackle all the big issues of the day. The Vietnam War. Drug addiction. Anorexia. Gay rights. AIDS. No topic was too controversial. In the wake of Roe v. Wade in 1973, Erica Kane became the first character on TV to have a legal abortion, when she decided that being pregnant would ruin her modeling career. All My Children won more than 30 daytime Emmys and has been nominated for best daytime drama 28 consecutive times, winning three times.\n\n\"When I look back, everything in my life has pointed me toward understanding what makes people tick,\" Nixon said. \"Current events, for me, all get reduced to people and what makes them do the things they do. What I always wanted was to entertain people, first of all, but I also hope that I taught them a bit and out of that teaching, maybe some people rose out of their prejudices and their fears.\"\n\nNixon's personal journey as a working mother was reflected in the storylines she created for Erica, who through the many years of the show was a makeup company executive, a TV host, a magazine editor, a writer, and the owner of a disco. Nixon, who has four children and 11 grandchildren, \"was a role model for working mothers before we talked about role models for working mothers,\" said All My Children's head writer, Lorraine Broderick, whom Nixon hired in the '70s after receiving an impassioned fan letter from her. \"She had an incredibly demanding full-time career while raising four children, and she helped us all see that it was possible.\"\n\nBut not every plot born from Nixon's mind and typewriter was designed to be thought-provoking. For every deep internal issue Erica Kane confronted—she also was the first soap character to be addicted to drugs—there was an escapade or an unexpected, humorous solution to a problem. How did Erica cope with her second thoughts about marrying Adam Chandler? She jumped out the window of their hotel room on their wedding night.\n\n\"I did get a kick out of Erica jumping out the window,\" said Canary, who won 5 Emmys playing twin brothers Adam and Stuart Chandler and retired from All My Children last year, after 27 years. \"Then you fast-forward to more recent history and it wasn't too bad being married to a 20-year-old beauty. I was 71! Pretty good, huh?\"\n\nOver the years, Adam and Erica married twice, but dealing with Adam's devious ways proved easier for Lucci than working with some of her other co-stars.\n\n\"The grizzly bear! Oh my God, I didn't think that would work,\" Lucci recalls of the 1985 episode in which Erica takes on a bear. \"We were working with a real bear and I asked the producer if she thought I could really pull this off—fight with a bear and win, and the audience is going to buy it? The bear didn't want to work because we were on location in Canada and it was really hot and it just wanted to be in the stream, cooling off. We did one take and left the bear alone, but that shows how much I know, because it became an iconic scene.\"\n\nEngaged to be married for the 12th time, and romantically entangled with at least a dozen more men, Erica wasn't the only character consumed by love on All My Children. The show had many super couples: Cliff and Nina; Greg and Jenny; Jesse and Angie, Tad and Dixie, Leo and Greenlee; and Reese and Bianca. And Nixon wasn't afraid to delve into the absurdities of the genre with them, as long as the emotional payoff was worthwhile.\n\n\"A lot of people wouldn't want to be seen as that Pollyanna, but Aggie has an innate belief that life is precious and that everything will work out in the world,\" said Michael E. Knight, who played Tad Martin for 25 years. \"It's not a religious thing with her. There's an affirmation of life and if you stay in the game long enough, if you struggle to be honest and have integrity, then life writes itself. You see this in the foundation of all of her stories.\"\n\nTwenty years after viewers saw Jesse die in front of Angie, Nixon brought both characters back to Pine Valley and reunited them in an unforgettable and epic scene at a train station. In the 1980s, Jesse and Angie, played by Darnell Williams and Debbi Morgan, stood out because they were daytime's first African-American super couple. Now they're notable simply because in a town of rampant bed-hopping, the couple has endured.\n\n\"That reunion happened due to the brilliance of Agnes Nixon,\" said Morgan of the 2008 episode, in which Angie learned that Jesse was alive. \"It didn't really matter that we saw him flat-line and that Angie climbed up on the bed with him. You believed it because it was like Gone with the Wind. There's the train, the fog, and that Alicia Keys song. You did not care if it sounded ridiculous. If you were watching it, you were crying. Agnes has always led the march with almost everything ground-breaking. Even at the age she is now, she still has it in her.\"\n\nIndeed, the maverick storyteller, who began her career on the radio and seamlessly made the transition to the small screen, said there's no question she'll work on the Internet version of All My Children. The day in April when ABC announced that both All My Children and One Life to Live were being canceled \"was not one of the grandest days of my life,\" she said. Ratings for both soaps had been steadily declining for a decade and, over the years, the network had compensated by cutting actor salaries and then relocating the production from New York City to Los Angeles in 2010. Several other soap operas already had been canceled, including the longest-running serial, Guiding Light, due to increased competition from talk shows and basic cable lifestyle programming.\n\nExecutive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers said she was well aware that ratings and revenues were down. \"But I was actually a little shocked [by the cancellation], and I'm not shocked by much,\" she said in her office. \"But I was, like, OK, I know it doesn't make sense financially but it's All My Children. It was kinda like—the brand will outlive any other issues because it's All My Children. It's not one of the other shows that have gone off the air, and the outcry has supported that. I know soaps are dying but it's All My Children!''\n\nThat day, on set in Los Angeles, the cast and crew were summoned to a meeting where a video conference with the cast and crew of One Life to Live in Manhattan was set up. Actress Christina Bennett Lind, who plays Erica's daughter Bianca, said she naively assumed production was having a party to celebrate that the show had survived weeks of rumors that it would be canceled. But as soon as she walked in the room, Lind said she realized she was mistaken. Strangers in suits milled around, and no one uttered a word until ABC's daytime president Brian Frons announced that the network was opting to replace two of its three soaps with talk shows and reality fare that costs 40 percent less to produce.\n\n\"It was just devastation,\" adds Jacob Young, who has played J.R. Chandler for eight years and will soon return to The Bold and the Beautiful. \"I felt like it was just ill-handled. Give the people a chance, especially when they believed in the show enough to come all the way from New York and uproot their families. A year into it, they do this? When people first heard the news, it was wall-to-wall tears. There was a lot of sadness.\"\n\nThe company of 125 was not alone in its disappointment. As soon as the news broke, viewers staged protests outside ABC offices across the country, persuaded some advertisers, like Hoover, to pull out of the network, and started an online campaign to boycott The Chew, the talk show that will replace All My Children on Sept. 26. Celebrities including Carol Burnett, who has been a fan of the show for 37 years and has reprised her guest role on it five times, and Josh Duhamel, who started his career on it, immediately expressed their desire to return to Pine Valley to be part of the grand sendoff.\n\nBurnett, who was \"mad and sad\" about the cancellation, has been so obsessed with the comings and goings of Pine Valley over the years that when she went on a monthlong vacation to Europe in the late 1970s, she asked a friend to watch All My Children and send her a weekly telegram with a recap. When the message arrived at her hotel in Lake Cuomo, Italy, the concierge handed it to her, shaking. It said: \"Erica is still missing. Mona hasn't awakened from her coma yet. And Palmer found out that his wife, Donna, was an ex-hooker.\"\n\n\"When I read it, I started laughing so hard that tears were coming down my face and they thought I was crying,\" Burnett recalls, laughing. My husband grabbed the telegram and said, 'Oh for God's sake, it's her soap.'\"\n\nAll My Children taped its last scene for ABC on Aug. 30 with the entire cast present, including Canary and Julia Barr, who played Brooke English for nearly 30 years and left the show in 2006. Afterward, everyone gathered around a huge cake, and Nixon told stories about the six actors in the All My Children family that had passed away. (Mary Fickett, who played Ruth Martin for 26 consecutive years and recurred occasionally in the past decade, passed away Sept. 8.) Nixon ended by asking everyone to join her singing \"I'll See You Again,\" the late Kay Campbell's favorite song. (Campbell played Grandma Kate until 1985, when she died in a car accident.)\n\n\"That part was a little teary, but that's good for the soul,\" you know?\" said Nixon during a telephone interview the next day. \"If I keep talking about it, I'll cry all over again.\"\n\nBut \"it all feels like graduating and leaving home,\" she added, referring to the end of an era on network TV and the possibility of new beginnings for both All My Children and One Life to Live.\n\n\"This is just the next step in the story,\" Nixon said. \"Look at what happened to the horse and buggy when the automobile came in, look at what happened to movies when they became talkies, look at what happened to radio when television started. This is life.\"\n\nFor Nixon, the turn of events calls to mind one of her favorite All My Children scenes, between Erica and her mother, played by Frances Heflin. In the scene, Erica said to Mona: \"Mother, I think you watch too many soap operas.\" And Mona replies: \"I don't have to watch soap operas. I live one.\"\n\nThis is an extended version of a piece that appeared in the Sept. 19, 2011, edition of Newsweek."
