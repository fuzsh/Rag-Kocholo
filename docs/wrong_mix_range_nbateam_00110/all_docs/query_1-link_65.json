        "text": "INDEPENDENCE, Ohio ­— Are the Celtics a real threat to Cleveland this season?\n\nDepends on which Cavalier you ask, though the most prominent of the flock, LeBron James, was not available for comment yesterday.\n\nBut Kevin Love thinks so, saying one of the reasons for the heightened intensity between the two teams is the trade involving Kyrie Irving and Isaiah Thomas.\n\n“I think it adds another layer to that,” Love said as the Cavs prepared for tonight’s season opener against the Celts. “You know, Boston has been a team that’s continued to get better, and they were in the Eastern Conference finals last year against us.\n\n“So yeah, I don’t know if rival is the right word, but they are right up there, if not the main competitor, we feel like, with us in the East. There’s a few other teams in there that we’re going to fight with, but Boston seems to, like I mentioned, keep getting better.”\n\nJ.R. Smith, however, isn’t giving an inch to the Celtics. The Cavs had no trouble with them in last season’s playoffs, but he’s not buying them as a danger to Cleveland’s status as three-time defending Eastern Conference champion.\n\n“Not really, I mean honestly,” he said. “Yeah, they have (Irving), but last year they had Isaiah. I mean, Avery (Bradley) and Gordon (Hayward), give or take, obviously they bring different things to the floor. Gord’s a better offensive player, but obviously Avery’s a better defender, so it’s pretty much you could say a wash there.\n\n“I mean, nobody really knows. . . . People are expecting good things from (Jayson) Tatum. He’s a rookie, so I can’t really go there with them. Al (Horford) is going to be Al, pick-and-pop guy, doesn’t really roll as much. Jaylen (Brown) has obviously gotten better.\n\n“I think they’re . . . I wouldn’t say the same team, obviously, because there’s different people in different jerseys, but I mean, I don’t really pose it as a big threat to us.”\n\nCavs coach Tyronn Lue wants more analytics.\n\n“I don’t really know because we haven’t played them yet,” he said. “I’ve got to really get out there and get a good sample size of how they play and what they do defensively, what they do offensively. So I really don’t know.\n\n“I know they’ve got a lot of changing pieces and changing parts, but until I get a chance to play them and figure them out, I won’t know.”\n\nWhen it was pointed out Lue is very familiar with what Irving can do (he owns a 2015-16 championship ring based in large part on Kyrie’s 3-pointer with 53 seconds left in Game 7 against the Warriors) and knows Hayward’s talent well, the coach expressed more Celtics uncertainty.\n\n“Yeah, but then they lose a defensive presence in (Jae) Crowder,” he said. “They lose Amir Johnson. They lose Avery Bradley. So it’s going to be interesting to see how they play throughout the course of the season.”\n\nA bigger and more pressing question for the Cavs is whether James’ injured left ankle will allow him to play this evening, though it doesn’t seem to be a question at all to Smith, who would get the start if LeBron is out.\n\n“Oh, he’s going to go,” Smith said. “He’s going to go. Trust me that. I don’t care what he’s got to do, he’s going to play.”\n\nJames practiced yesterday, though the Cavs didn’t do anything too strenuous and went through a lengthy shooting session afterward.\n\n“You know, I never hide stuff from you guys. I really don’t know,” Lue said. “I mean, just depending on how he feels after today, but I really don’t know.”\n\nLater, the coach said, “I’m preparing that he is.”\n\nIn terms of game presentation, the Cavaliers have prepared an Irving tribute video, though his reception from the fans could have some negative undertones, considering he asked to be traded.\n\n“I mean, we’ve got the best fans in the world, and they’re going to do whatever they see best,” Lue said. “So whatever decision they make, that’s the right one because they’ve been behind us for the three straight years since I’ve been here. They’ve always made the right decision, so whatever they decide to do, I embrace.”\n\nSaid Love, “We all know Kyrie is a gamer. I loved playing with him, in practice hated going against him, so I’m sure it’ll be no different come Tuesday. But yeah, between the lines it’s going to be a fight, especially opening night. The crowd’s going to be into it. There’ll be a lot of emotions there.”\n\nAdded Smith, “He was a great player when he was here. In my eyes, he was a good teammate. He helped us win the championship. So I think it’ll be good.”\n\nAsked if he was disappointed that Irving wanted out, Smith said, “Yeah, I think we all were, but he felt that was what was best for him, so you’ve got to respect it.”\n\nHow much the Cavaliers truly respect the Celtics as contenders for their East crown is an opinion that will begin to be formulated in earnest tonight."
