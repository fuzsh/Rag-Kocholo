        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: J.R. Smith, the two-time NBA champion who’s gotten a lot of ink for changing his focus from basketball to golf, will be the subject of a four-part docuseries for Amazon.\n\nPrime Video is launching Redefined: J.R. Smith, which will follow the retired baller as he pursues a college education and new athletic passion – golf – at North Carolina A&T.\n\nThe series, which will launch on April 4, comes from LeBron James and Maverick Carter and their Uninterrupted banner.\n\nIt will tell the next-chapter story of Smith, who won titles with James on the Cleveland Cavaliers and the LA Lakers. After being drafted straight out of high school at age 19, a 35-year-old Smith found himself without an NBA team to call home and in search of redefining his life and career. The series picks up with Smith as he sets a new intention for himself: getting a college education and pursuing a new athletic passion as a member of the Men’s Golf Team at North Carolina A&T, the nation’s largest Historically Black University.\n\nRedefined: J.R. Smith is executive produced by James and Carter as well as Jamal Henderson and Philip Byron with Amy Glickman Brown and Erikka Yancy serving as co-executive producers for Uninterrupted. Philip Knowlton serves as director and will also co-executive produce."
