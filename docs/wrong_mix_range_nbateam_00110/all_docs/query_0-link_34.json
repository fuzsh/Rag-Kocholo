        "text": "TYRONN LUE – He was the first individual that popped into my mind as the good from this first round series. He out coached and Stan Van Gundy with his adjustments and out of bounds plays or as they’re known in NBA circles – ATO’s – After Time Out plays! Not bad for only coaching half a regular season and coaching in his 1st ever playoff series as the head coach.\n\nTHE BIG THREE – They finally looked like they can play together. They clicked in this series. Each of them had their moments and in those moments helped the team win games. They combined to average 69ppg – 23.2rpg – 13.2apg.\n\nKYRIE IRVING – He looked healthy, shot the ball well from distance, didn’t over dribble for the most part, actually played some defense especially on the final play of Game #4 and did something that is very rarely done, he led a LeBron James team in individual scoring with 27.5 points per game in a playoff series!\n\nLeBRON JAMES – He continued his great all-around game attacking the basket at times in the series but still not enough for me. Hopefully he will attack the rim more in the next round, but you can’t argue with his final numbers in sweep (22.8ppg – 9rpg – 6.8apg). “The King” has been in “Zero Dark Thirty – 23” mode for quite some time now and is playing his best basketball of the season.\n\nKEVIN LOVE – Despite not shooting it well at 41% from the field, he did score points 18.8ppg and led the team in rebounding 12rpg and his effort was outstanding on defense even though he may not have always been that effective. A good series for Love, and like Irving he came out of it healthy and gained some valuable playoff experience!\n\nJ.R. SMITH – “Swish” did his job in three of the four games knocking down three-point shots and unbelievable “end of the shot clock baskets” to become that fourth scorer that the Cavaliers need. He also played good defense and kept his cool, which is paramount for him and this team moving forward. In other words, he didn’t lose his mind and have a J.R. moment that could hurt his team.\n\nMATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA – “Delly” was the one consistent player off the bench as he played outstanding on offense and defense. The Cavaliers need him to continue this type of play throughout the playoffs and into the NBA finals.\n\nTRISTAN THOMPSON – His Numbers don’t look great but he was the sacrificial lamb in this series and accepted that role. He had to give up statistics and take one for the team in guarding “HUGE” Andre Drummond and he did an outstanding job of that. A total team player.\n\nA SERIES SWEEP – Regardless of how it happened, anytime you can “Broom” a team in the playoffs and come out of that series healthy it’s a great thing. Now you can rest and watch the next team you’re going to play in the NBA Playoffs as they continue to battle in their first round series and maybe get a little banged up or at the very least, get tired The less games you have to play, the less chance a player on your team can get hurt.\n\nAGGRESSIVE, ATTACKING LEBRON – While he didn’t get the calls in Game #5 at Golden State, LeBron needs to go to the basket strong and frequently because it’s his best offensive weapon and it will put the onus on the officials to make calls if there is any contact. I expect “King James” to shoot no less than 14 free throws in this Game #6 if he attacks the rim.\n\nPOUND THE BOARDS – The Cavs lost the battle of the boards in Game #5 overall and at the offensive end, that can’t happen again in this series starting with tonight’s Game #6. Even if David Blatt decides to go small again, the Cavaliers as a unit must find a way to hold the Warriors to one shot, while at the other end create second and third chance opportunities on offense.\n\nGET PHYSICAL WITH STEPH AND THE WARRIORS – Curry went for 37 in Game #5, if he does that again the Cavs season will end tonight and the Warriors will be NBA Champs. Overall the Cavs must make Golden State feel them from the opening tip to the final whistle. If that means take a few hard fouls and also grab, bump and knock Steph Curry around, then do it. Don’t let him get comfortable. I would also mix in a little zone when trying to play maybe Tristan Thompson and Timofey Mozgov together, putting Lebron, J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert on the perimeter and force the Warriors to go inside. Use this to try and catch Golden State by surprise and it may buy you a few minutes so you can play your “Bigs” together.\n\nCONTROL THE TEMPO – This series has been all about the pace of the game. When Golden State has scored 100 or more points in the NBA Finals, they are (3-0). When the Cavs have held the Warriors under 100 points, Cleveland is (2-0). A slowdown, slugfest favors Cleveland. An up and down the court, track meet style game benefits the Warriors.\n\nA SUPPORTING CAST – LeBron is doing it all and that’s still not enough. He needs a consistent second and third scorer if the Cavs are to force a Game #7 and have a chance to win the title. That means J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert must step their games up on the offensive end and provide at least 35 points between the two of them for the Cavs to have any chance. I expect LeBron to score between 35 and 45 points tonight, but without help from “The Others”, it won’t matter and the season will come to an end.\n\nPREDICTION:\n\nWith the TV ratings at an all-time high, you know the NBA office wants a Game #7 that would feature Steph Curry and LeBron James. With that in mind and this game being played in Cleveland, I expect the Cavs to get more calls tonight giving them a chance to win Game #6, but it will come down to LeBron and “The Others” making shots and free throws. In a game in the 90’s, I expect the LeBron and the Cavs to find a way to win and force a Game #7 Friday at Golden State by defeating the Warriors tonight 95-91 at The Q!"
