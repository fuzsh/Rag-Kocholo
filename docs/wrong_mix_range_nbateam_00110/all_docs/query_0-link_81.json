        "text": "LeBron and JR Smith\n\nLeBron James, left, and JR Smith.\n\n(NBA.com)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Here is what Cleveland Cavaliers players JR Smith and LeBron James said after their team's 97-89 win against the Atlanta Hawks in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, as shown on NBA TV.\n\nJR, how much fun is it to not only be in a system that fits your skillset but encourages you to shoot?\n\nSmith: It's an extremely fun system to play. I get a lot of open shots, so it's easy for me to get into a rhythm. Once I start shooting, whether I make or miss, everyone tells me to keep shooting. So it's a great situation.\n\nLeBron, you and DeMarre Carroll seemed to be jawing in the first half, but after he went down, you seemed to share a moment. Can you possibly share what you said to him?\n\nJames: At the end of the day, we're a brotherhood. The NBA is a brotherhood. You never want anyone to get injured in combat. That's what went through my mind. Obviously, I love competing vs. anyone who loves to compete as well. He was one of those guys that was competing throughout the night and throughout the postseason. I'm not sure the severity of the injury right now, but I hope he'll recover, whatever it is. You just don't want anybody to get hurt like that.\n\nLeBron, can you tell us the difference of the group of shooters that you played with in Miami to the group that you have now?\n\nJames: I've been fortunate enough to play with some shooters to help spread the floor for myself and do what I do best, that's being in attack mode. To be able to play with one of the all-time greats in Ray Allen, and also play with Mike Miller, Shane Battier, James Jones, still, and then you get a guy like JR Smith who's able to just shoot the ball and have the extreme confidence that every time they let it go, it's going in. I've been blessed to play with guys like that. When you have guys like that, you have to utilize everyone on the floor.\n\nLeBron, can you talk about the play in the last 37 seconds when you went for the dunk?\n\nJames: Coach just drew up a play and we just tried to run it to perfection. He drew up a play, and (Tristan Thompson) came up and set up a screen-and-roll, and I was able to get into the middle of the floor. The way we were shooting the 3-ball tonight kept those last two defenders at bay. And I was able to just turn into the lane and make a big play for our team at that time.\n\nJR, how important was it for you to change your reputation and what steps do you think you made as soon as Cleveland called saying they were interested in trading for you?\n\nSmith: It was extremely important because more than anything, it was for my parents. They know what type of person they raised and what type of person they inspired me to be. It wasn't really for myself. It was more for them, if not for anybody.\n\nLeBron, when the organization first approached you and said we can make a move to get JR Smith, but we have concerns, what was your idea about the importance and the value of getting a player like this in your franchise?\n\nJames: Get him here and I'll take care of it.\n\nSo you planned to take care of him?\n\nJames: Yeah, I got him. Get him here and I've got him.\n\nLeBron, what worked for you, for the team defensively against their 3-point shooting? For JR, how important was it for you to keep things rolling after you got hot?\n\nJames: We have a bright coaching staff, first of all, that gives us a gameplan. Throughout the six days, we've been bouncing ways we can try to not stop what they do, but just try to limit some of their touches, limit Kyle Korver's touches, limit some of their other 3-point shooters. We're the No. 1 defensive team in the playoffs. It has a lot to do with what we go out, as a coaching staff, they give us our gameplan and for us as players, we go out and execute it. In order for us to win, ultimately, we have to defend. Tonight, we shot 44 percent from the field. But we defended, gave ourselves a chance. When you defend at a high level, you give yourself a chance to win every game.\n\nSmith: I just tried to roll with the punches. Once the team starts closing out to you at bay, just trying to get in attack mode, and at the same time, trying to find my teammates. It was kind of hard when I was hitting the shots that I was hitting to pass the ball. But we've got to figure out a way.\n\nLeBron, what was it that you saw in JR that made you very favored to bringing him to Cleveland? What kind of satisfaction do you guys get after having a game like this against the Hawks?\n\nJames: Me and JR's history goes back long before we came into the NBA. Before we came into the NBA, he came into my hometown, we worked out multiple days, multiple times. For me as a leader of a team, we always just want to try to give someone an opportunity. With the talent this guy presents, I knew the man he was and I didn't care what everybody else thought about him. Obviously, our front office, they have the last say-so. When they made it and said they were going to do it, I was definitely all for it. I felt like for me, we were getting a great piece not only on the floor, but off the floor as well because I knew him before he even got to this point.\n\nTo answer your second question, to be able to just make plays to help your team win is all that matters for me. When you have a guy like this that was shooting the ball extremely well, it broke the game open. Also, contributions from (Matthew Dellavedova) off the bench once again, and then our two bigs, both of them had double-doubles. That was big-time.\n\nTwo questions: Can you take us through the third quarter when you stepped on the camera guy? After some really good quarters offensively, the second and third quarters, you guys seemed to get out of rhythm a little bit in the fourth. What happened there until you finished with that dunk?\n\nJames: In the third quarter, I went to contest DeMarre Carroll's 3-point attempt. The cameraman, I guess his foot was out further than it should be. I stepped on his foot, turned my ankle. But I'm happy that it didn't cost me the rest of the game. I was able to go out there and make a few plays.\n\nI think, to answer your second question, we can't worry about how many points we're up or how many points we're down. We have to continue to play our game. It starts with me. I take all responsibility of it. Fourth quarter, I played too much isolation basketball, one-on-one basketball, allowed the defense to set. I was letting the clock run down way too much either for me to just, I had to take the shot or I was giving it to my guys late in the shot clock and they couldn't do anything with it besides shoot it or turn the ball over. I will do a better job. I'll probably watch the game over again as I try to get my body ready for Game 2. It starts with me.\n\nLeBron, with what Kyrie Irving is going through, can you say anything to him? Or is this something he has to resign to the fact that maybe through the rest of the playoffs, he'll be laboring through these injuries?\n\nJames: It's tough. I know it sucks for him. This is the moment he's been waiting for. This is the biggest stage. Physically, he's not capable of doing what we all know he's capable of doing. Hopefully it doesn't get into his mind. For me, that's my role at this point, let him know when he's on the floor that we need him to be aggressive, as aggressive as he can be with the injury and not worry about things that he cannot control, only worry about the things that he can control. That will be my job to help him understand no matter what he's going through physically, never let it creep into his mind where it affects him mentally.\n\nLeBron, what changed defensively in the second half?\n\nJames: We started to get a rhythm of what they wanted to do. We also just put pressure not only at the point of attack, but when the ball was moved from side to side. Our coaching staff gives us a great gameplan and it's up to us to execute it. They're going to make shots. They're one of, if not the best with Golden State, the best offenses we have in our league. And we just have to make it tough on them.\n\nLeBron, do you know in the midst of iso ball can you feel you're doing it too much or is it only after the game you can decompress it and look at the numbers?\n\nJames: I kind of sense it. I sense it during the game a little bit. It's tough sometimes, with our main ball-handler not being on the floor, that's in Kyrie. That's something that I'm not happy with, something I'm not comfortable doing. I can do it. But I don't like to play that much isolation basketball that late in the game. I'd much rather get the ball moving from side to side and get a good look after that. Like I said, I'll be more conscious about that in Game 2. If that opportunity presents itself where at least I can get the ball moving to start and then maybe at the backside or the third option, I can get it back at the end. At least we can get the defense moving instead of them watching me pound the ball for 24 seconds. That's not good basketball.\n\nJR, how gratifying is this for you personally after being through all you've been through to be at this stage?"
