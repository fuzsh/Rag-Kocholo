        "text": "In 2009, it was the NBA Western Conference Finals, Nuggets vs Lakers. It was the year succeeding the season when Kobe Bryant was named as an MVP. The Los Angeles Lakers defeated their opponents in six games, but the series still remained special to one key player from the Denver Nuggets. He was a 6’6” tall 24-year-old JR Smith.\n\nIn that very year, JR posted a season-high 41 points in the match-up against the Atlanta Hawks. He dropped bombs in that match with 10+ 3-pointers. Also, The Black Mamba was the playoff leader with 695 points. This was enough to motivate JR, who cherishes the memory of playing against the Hall of Famer. Now that Smith is finally about to wear a Golden-Purple jersey, he is more than happy. So is LeBron to have him!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nJR Smith remembers Kobe and pays tribute as a Los Angeles Lakers man\n\nKobe’s passing away was a sad shock. American Rapper Ice Cube, also the producer of Straight Outta Compton, was in a similar state of disbelief. According to a video Tweet by ESPN, he was so shattered that he tried to text Kobe in a hope to hear back from him. Such a relationship! Now he tweeted something, tagging JR Smith, which got Swish to respond back with genuine modesty.\n\nJR wrote, “Appreciate it bro! It’s an honor to play in his memory for as long as i wear the colors.”\n\nIn another such instance, JR Smith shared what it was like to play against Kobe for the first time. It is just hilarious how he merrily downsizes himself while explaining a foul that got the coach mad.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nSmith has to take the legacy forward\n\nWith Anthony Davis, LeBron, and now Dwight Howard in the Lakers’ roster, they are already a wall of defense. But JR has to do his bit by pulling those three-pointers just when needed the most. His past experience of playing 100+ playoffs will come handy. Chances are that he will get to play in the NBA scrimmages that will take place before the season restart kicks off.\n\nWe will have to see if JR can bring that magic along with him. Although, LeBron is very delighted to have his former Cavs teammate in this new squad.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nA good read- “I Just Look At Him As An Example”: Lakers Rising Star On Taking Inspiration From Kawhi Leonard\n\nCan JR give the Lakers that cutting edge for which he is signed? Give us your thoughts down below!"
