        "text": "While Knicks coach Derek Fisher warned his team to be careful in the wake of the Pacers’ Chris Copeland being stabbed outside a Chelsea nightclub, former Knick J.R. Smith said no warning will stop NBA players from keeping late hours on the road.\n\nSmith, traded to the Cavaliers in January partially because of his unprofessional demeanor in going out late, said Copeland’s only mistake was not using more discretion. Smith and Copeland were Knicks teammates in 2012-13 and Smith said 1 OAK, where Copeland had been before the stabbing, is one of his favorite nightclubs.\n\n“For me, I feel like a target every time,” Smith told reporters at the Cavs’ shootaround Friday, according to ESPN.com. “So I try to handle myself with care when I’m out and about. It’s one of those situations when you’re out at 4 in the morning —- I’m not saying it’s [Copeland’s] fault by any means — but when you’re out at 4 in the morning, there’s no way you should be walking anywhere. Get in your car and go home or go wherever you’re going. That’s one of my cardinal rules. You don’t just stand outside of the events like that. You just get in and go and keep it moving.”\n\nCopeland was stabbed in the elbow and abdomen while having an argument with his girlfriend, police said. Two Hawks, Thabo Sefolosha and Pero Antic (who were in town to play the Nets), were arrested on charges of obstructing a crime scene. Sefolosha suffered a broken leg after an altercation with police, igniting a player’s union investigation.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like that at all,” Smith said. “You hear about stuff like that all the time, but seeing it firsthand? I’ve never seen it.”\n\nThe club is a hot spot on Tuesdays and is popular with visiting NBA players.\n\n“It’s a great place to be if you want to have a good time,” Smith told reporters. “It was one of my favorite places when I was there. You get to see people: The Leonardo DiCaprios, the Rihannas, the Jay Zs, Beyonces and people of that sort. So, if you don’t get a chance to go to concerts and stuff like that, it’s a good chance. It’s where you see people and it’s a good vibe”\n\nSmith said the NBA schedule lends itself to very late evenings.\n\n“We fly in late all the time, so then we go out [late],” said Smith, who said recently his partying since the trade has gone way down because of Cleveland’s lack of options.\n\nFisher said he has spoken to his club about the risks.\n\n“We addressed it a little bit,’’ Fisher said. “It’s an example to our players to avoid those situations as much as we can.’’\n\nThe Bucks led by double-digits across most of the second half in posting a 99-91 victory Friday night.\n\nFree-agent-to-be guard Khris Middleton scored 22 points, with three 3-pointers and six steals.\n\nThe Knicks committed 26 turnovers — five each by Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jason Smith. . … Andrea Bargnani sat out with an illness and is not making the trip to Orlando. He’s also playing with a sore thumb, but could join the club in Atlanta. … Lance Thomas was 6 of 6 from the field, including a pair of 3-pointers, and finished with 16 points. Langston Galloway had 20 points. … Giannis Antetokounmpo , who had lobbied for his brother Thanasis to get signed by the Knicks, ripped them for 23 points and nine boards.\n\nStruggling point guard Shane Larkin was benched for the game. Hardaway started with Langston Galloway in the backcourt while Lou Amundson was pulled for Quincy Acy."
