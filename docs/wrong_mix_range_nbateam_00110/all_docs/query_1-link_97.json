        "text": "I’m still glad J.R. Smith left Denver.\n\nBut what a night for J.R. Smith, huh? In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he hit eight three-pointers, scored 28 points and helped the Cavaliers win on Atlanta’s home court. It was a phenomenal display of shooting in a pressure-packed situation.\n\nI had an NBA-lovin’ buddy call me from Chicago, and the first thing out of his mouth was, “I bet you wish he was still with the Nuggets!”\n\nNope. I’m glad he’s gone. Very glad.\n\nRELATED: Josh Kroenke: Nuggets have had “several conversations” in coach search\n\nBy the end of the 2010-11 season, after five years of watching J.R.Smith up close, it was clear that it was time for him to go. I had had enough of him. The Nuggets had had enough of him. Plenty of fans had had enough of his act, too.\n\nLook, I was always in awe of J.R.’s athletic ability. In fact, I’m on record on TV and radio as saying that I thought J.R. was one of the top 10 athletes in the NBA. All-star ability. Incredible leaper, incredible quickness, good ball-handler, and one of the sweetest shots this side of Stephen Curry.\n\nMillion dollar talent — but a 5-cent head. And that immaturity reared its ugly head all too often. It still does.\n\nWATCH: More with Les: J.R. Smith is athletic but he’s still immature\n\nJ.R. has a long record of bad-decision making on and off the court — reckless driving, foolish pranks (like untying opponents’ shoelaces), pouting, fighting. He was a coach’s nightmare here, in New Orleans and with the Knicks.\n\nCleveland thought hard about acquiring him from New York, but Lebron James said, “I need a guy like that on the wing to take some pressure off me. J.R.Smith a problem-child? I’ll take care of it.” And he has, for the most part.\n\nJ.R. respects Lebron immensely, but that still hasn’t kept him from misbehaving at times. Remember, just two weeks ago, he was suspended — in the playoffs — for purposely elbowing an opponent in the head. It was the same thing he did and was suspended for during the 2013 playoffs.\n\nYou might say J.R. has grown up some, but not all the way. He’s almost 30 now so, really what’s going to change?\n\nI’m glad he’s having success, but I’m also glad he’s gone. For every game he came off the bench and scored 20 points, he had three or four games of inconsistent play, where he drove everybody nuts, threw up bad shots, flashed a bad attitude, and maddened a teammate or coach.\n\nJ.R. is fully aware of his reputation. He says he can live with it, but it pains him to see his mom so bothered by the negative things that are said or written about him.\n\nWell, here’s a suggestion, J.R. Don’t give her anything to be ashamed about. Behave better. And keep hitting those three pointers.\n\nWhen you’re on, like last night, you’re a pleasure to watch. And it almost makes us forget all that other stuff."
