        "text": "Former Cleveland Cavs guard-forward J.R. Smith admits it would have been easy to be a “rich, dumb jock” and call it a career.\n\nWith estimated career earnings of more than $90 million in the NBA courtesy of 15 years in the league, he could have easily gone that route after playing with LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers in his most recent season. He, however, chose a different path.\n\nSmith made a splash by enrolling at North Carolina A&T, a historically black college-university, where he also joined the golf team. His experiences are chronicled in a documentary produced by James and Maverick Carter that began streaming Tuesday on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nJ.R. Smith wanted something more\n\nSmith, who went to the NBA right out of high school, had his curiosity piqued about college by fellow baller Ray Allen. There was little doubt of his skills on the basketball court in high school. After all, very few players (James being one) go straight from high school courts to the NBA.\n\nOne of the reasons Smith felt more comfortable heading directly to a career in the NBA: a learning disability. School success did not come easily to him.\n\nHowever, with his playing days likely behind him (he’s still hasn’t officially retired), he inevitably faced the question of what was next.\n\nTo him, heading to college represents personal evolution.\n\nMore: Get to know J.R. Smith: The kind-hearted, often misunderstood Cavs guard\n\n“For me, it was more about challenging myself and trying to overcome and be more well-rounded person. For me, I try to do that with my health, my endurance, with my strength, so many different areas,” Smith told the Beacon Journal in a recent interview over Zoom. “Why not focus on my education and my brain … expand my mind in different ways and really continuously challenge myself and set goals just like I do on when I'm reading [the green] on the golf course or on the basketball court?”\n\nJ.R. Smith adapts to life as a student\n\nSmith averaged double figures — 12.4 points per game — in the NBA, a feat that few people have accomplished. College may have been a more significant hurdle, he admits.\n\n“But once I overcame that and really understood what work is and putting in time and trying to understand stuff,” he said, “and really reading all my materials and not looking at it from an aspect of I can't do it. I feel like academics has been easier.”\n\nWell, everything has been easier except algebra and trigonometry, which he calls “the worst,” something many people would be inclined to agree with him.\n\n“But everything else I'm pretty cool with. Because I got a lot to say, “so when I get to write papers and stuff like that, I find that very fun and intriguing. That's like, that's pretty much easy for me. I actually got a final paper coming up on mass incarceration.”\n\nFinding that commonality in academics and athletics — working hard — has allowed him to succeed in the classroom. At one point in the series, the audience gets to see Smith celebrating news of getting a 4.0 grade point average. It’s almost as thrilling as watching him jump up and down upon realizing the Cavs had won the 2016 NBA championship.\n\nJ.R. Smith finds the challenge\n\nBut basketball came easy to him and he’s conquered the academics. The challenge for J.R. Smith comes on the golf course.\n\nAlthough he’d acquired a reputation on the assorted courses of Northeast Ohio for possessing some skills on the links, his test at college comes in absorbing more about a game where he is the learner, not the master.\n\n“Golf, man, these kids out here in this generation, everybody hits the ball far,” he said. “Everybody can play and they're getting younger, younger and playing with these dudes,” he said. “I find myself really in a dogfight and can't scratch the surface playing against them because they're so good.”\n\nHe recognizes the student-athletes who are his teammates and competitors have played the game since before they were pre-teens in most cases.\n\n“So when I think about it like that, it's like I'm supposed to be getting my a** kicked [by] these young kids. They put the effort and energy when they were 5, 6 years old,” Smith said. “I'm not supposed to walking here, thinking I'm going to make it. You know what I'm saying? I got to put the time in, the swings in and stuff. When I look at that, I'm cool with it. But golf is definitely harder for me than academics right now.”\n\nUnique experiences serve as a guide\n\nHe learns from those younger players and his life experiences help them at North Carolina A&T and beyond. Choosing an HBCU sent a powerful message. Smith said he’s always used his basketball skills to impart knowledge to the younger generation. However, given the dearth of wealthy African Americans, he said his story is unique.\n\n“I want to influence anybody to do what I've done,” he said. “I want to influence younger kids who look like myself, who have that, maybe have that same insecurity about their education, who cause of the way they look, way they act, maybe the way they think and they don’t know how to express themselves.”\n\nAnd being there certainly provided a sense of comfort for him.\n\n“For me, I felt safe being around more people who look like me, especially the elders who were chancellors and faculty members and such like that,” he said. “So it's everybody's pretty much on the same page and that's where I really feel like I would thrive more than anywhere.”\n\nGeorge M.
