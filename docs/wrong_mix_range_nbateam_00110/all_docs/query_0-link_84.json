        "text": "Tony Dejak/Associated Press\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks will begin an attempt to become the first team in NBA history to win a playoff series after being down 3-0 when they face the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals Tuesday night in Cleveland.\n\nThe Cavaliers’ Big Three has turned into a Big One after forward Kevin Love and guard Kyrie Irving suffered separate injuries this postseason. All-Star forward LeBron James has picked up the slack and has the Cavaliers one step closer to an NBA championship.\n\nThe Hawks have suffered multiple injuries to key players as well in this series. Premier three-point shooter Kyle Korver and swingman DeMarre Carroll suffered ankle and knee injuries, respectively, earlier in the series.\n\nHere are three players to watch during Tuesday's pivotal Game 4 matchup.\n\nJeff Teague, PG, Hawks\n\nTeague had arguably the best individual performance from either team in Game 3 with his 30-point effort. After center Al Horford’s first-half ejection, Teague took the game over and nearly handed the Hawks their first win of the series.\n\nThe Cavaliers’ loss of Irving has provided Teague with great opportunities to score. The only way to keep up with a high-powered team like Cleveland is to score in big numbers, and Teague is the main catalyst for the Hawks.\n\nThe 26-year-old point guard has made an impact on both ends of the floor for the Hawks. Teague leads the team with 23.0 points and 5.7 assists per game so far in this series. On the defensive end of the floor, he leads the team with 1.3 steals and 1.0 blocks per game against Cleveland.\n\nTeague is confident his team can bounce back from a 3-0 deficit, as noted by Atlanta's official\n\nTwitter account:\n\nIf the Hawks hope to gain momentum in this series in an attempt to make history, Teague will have to show up and have another impressive performance in Game 4. He has the opportunity to turn the series around completely if he can keep up his solid play.\n\nTristan Thompson, C, Cavaliers\n\nThompson has flourished in place of Love so far in this series. Against Atlanta, he is averaging a double-double with 10.3 points and 11.0 rebounds per game. Not a lot had been asked of the young forward before Love’s injury, but he has capitalized on his opportunities in the post.\n\nThompson has been frequently double-teamed in pick-and-roll situations, but this hasn't limited his playmaking ability. He also leads the team with 4.0 offense rebounds per game in this series and has given his team second-chance opportunities to score.\n\nESPN NBA analyst Tim Legler broke down what makes Thompson so important to his team’s success:\n\nThompson will more than likely be matched up with Horford in Game 4. After Horford was ejected in Game 3, the 6'9\" center looked more comfortable on the floor and made several big plays down the stretch. With Horford returning for Game 4, Thompson will have to be a key contributor on both ends of the floor.\n\nJ.R Smith, SG, Cavaliers\n\nWhen Smith is in any sort of rhythm offensively, he is nearly impossible to stop. Smith emerged on the scene in this series after a 28-point performance in Game 1.\n\nSmith has been one of the main contributors off the bench in this series for the Cavaliers. He is averaging 18 points per game against Atlanta, which ranks second on the team in this series.\n\nThe 6'6\" shooting guard has been one of the most efficient offensive players for Cleveland in this series. He is shooting 45 percent from the floor and ranks fourth on the team with a 39.5 three-point percentage.\n\nSmith has also made an impact on the boards. He ranks second among Cleveland guards with 4.5 rebounds per game against Atlanta. He has also wreaked havoc on the defensive end of the floor and ranks second on the team with 1.3 steals per game in this series.\n\nSmith’s performance so far in this series has impressed ESPN First Take co-host Skip Bayless:\n\nThe former New York Knick might not have another lights-out performance like he had in Game 1, but the fact that he is playing some of his best basketball at the right time is something to keep an eye on. Smith always seems to be around the basketball when the game is on the line, so if Game 4 comes down to the wire, he will be an option to watch.\n\nGame 4 Prediction\n\nThe Hawks have everything to lose, but the Cavaliers have been almost unbeatable at home this season. Jeff Teague should have another explosive game for the Hawks, but it won’t be enough as LeBron James and the Cavaliers move on to the NBA Finals.\n\nCavaliers 98, Hawks 91"
