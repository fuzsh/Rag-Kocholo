        "text": "Termini and Klutch agreed to a three-year contract, later extended to 2020. Klutch agreed to pay Termini 25% of Klutch and Paul’s gross fee on NBA contracts and marketing deals. As depicted in the complaint, the contract contemplated fees being earned even if a contract between Klutch and an NBA player ended. Termini would also be the “exclusive provider” of contract negotiation services to Klutch. Termini estimates he negotiated “in excess of $1.4 billion in contracts” for Klutch through the free agency period preceding the 2019-2020 season. His services were used for deals with Draymond Green, Ben Simmons, Eric Bledsoe, Tristan Thompson, J.R. Smith and, most notably, LeBron James. Termini says it was his idea to implement a “one plus one” contract strategy for James in which James earned more than $19 million over the course of three short Cavaliers contracts—instead of one longer deal—when he returned to the Cavs in 2014.\n\nIndeed, the Knicks fed DiVincenzo, who took 20 treys and beat the previous franchise single-game record shared by Evan Fournier and J.R. Smith. Driven by an anxious home crowd, DiVincenzo’s final conversion with 3:16 remaining over former teammate Malachi Flynn followed three misses. “The crowd was speeding me up,” he said. “That emotion where you get like a sliver of space, and the crowd, as soon as you catch the ball, you can hear the crowd. “Really I’ve said this, it’s the best fans in the league in that moment it’s a dream of like, ‘Slow down, take your time, and shoot the ball.’ ”\n\nOn if he was playing in today’s NBA… Nick Young: [smiling] I wish I could get out there, man! Because back then when players like me and JR [Smith] would shoot those shots, we would be ‘bad shotmakers’… But now? They can do all the step-backs and dribbles you want so, but it’s fun to watch and you see teams like Indiana getting up to 150 points in games so it’s all offense. No defense.\n\nFor years, two-time NBA champion J.R. Smith spent recklessly, splurging on clubs and lavish clothing, and using his $90 million NBA earnings for team and league fines. Now, he regrets not giving more to his community and advises young people to avoid his mistakes. “I could have fed my whole community 10 times over with the money I was just [paying in fines for being] late on the bus,” Smith, 36, said in a February episode of the I Am Athlete podcast, hosted by former NFL player Brandon Marshall."
