        "text": "[#image: /photos/558290031177d66d68d53dfd]||||||\n\nPhoto: Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nLast night, following the Cavaliers’ insane beatdown of the Atlanta Hawks to sweep the Eastern Conference Finals and punch their ticket to the NBA Finals, J.R. Smith and his double-double joined LeBron and Tristan Thompson at the podium for the post-game press conference. And just as has been true for this post-season, J.R. didn’t disappoint on the big stage.\n\nWhile Tristan was answering a question, J.R. got restless and decided to take a podium selfie.\n\nIt turned out okay!\n\n#JustSaying\n\nA photo posted by JR Smith (@teamswish) on May 26, 2015 at 9:23pm PDT\n\nJ.R. then went on to plug his Instagram account and point out that he’s not in the Cleveland Nike \"Together\" ad (it was filmed before the season when J.R. was a Knick.) As he left the press conference he shouted out to someone at Nike asking to be edited into it as LeBron and Tristan laughed. The moral: J.R. is the best, and the Cavs seem pretty happy.\n\nWhat more can I say!! ##JustSaying @k1irving @imanshumpertthe1st @perk_409\n\nA video posted by JR Smith (@teamswish) on May 26, 2015 at 8:48pm PDT\n\nOnto the Finals."
