        "text": "When we pull up, they have Dave Matthews playing on the outdoor speakers. Night has fallen on Pepper Pike, Ohio, and behind the music we can make out the song of darkness whistling through the suburban forests, the rustling of leaves, and the shifting of a far-off (I'm guessing) Lexus luxury utility vehicle on a homeward vector toward a remote-controlled four-car garage. We exit J. R. Smith's white Mercedes and walk to the door. And as we walk, what should suddenly appear before us but two deer—a mother and a fawn—nibbling cold November lawn grass. Oh Jesus, I think, this is going to be fantastic. After all, if J. R. Smith had a theme song, it might be called “The Opposite of Dave Matthews.” And here we are, not only listening to dad rock, but watching two suburban deer listening to dad rock in the yard of Megan Fellinger, my old friend from the Shaker Heights, Ohio, high school swim team.\n\nMan, I thought to myself as we watched the deer, what a strange expatriation you must be living through, J. R. Smith. What a great distance you've traveled, in not even a year, since the days when you were still the shooting guard for the New York Knicks. Since you were living in that dope rental apartment in Manhattan—“There was too much to do. That was trouble!” you will tell the dinner-party guests tonight. Since you were dating Rihanna! Or at least, according to your Twitter account, not officially not dating Rihanna. Since a kid at Harvard published an impressive study that surmised—by dint of an exhaustive comparison of all NBA players' performances on Sundays versus the rest of the week—that you were the biggest partyer currently in the league. Since you tweeted pictures of reality-TV stars' butts in your hotel room on road trips. Since you accumulated what The Wall Street Journal described, super Wall Street Journal-y, as “the NBA's Most Diversified Portfolio of Infractions”—like untying opposing players' shoes during foul shots or elbowing dudes in the nuts. Since you drove around New York City in a $450,000 Gurkha armored truck and got in fights on the court and pissed off Phil Jackson and became one of the favorite subjects of the flesh-eating sportswriters at the New York Post.\n\nAnd now here you are in Cleveland, Ohio. Where I grew up. Sure, I thought, you've been here for almost a year. But have you really seen Cleveland? And when Megan Fellinger said, Hey, I'm having some friends from the neighborhood for dinner, why don't you come by? I thought: What better way to show him his new city than by taking him to that?\n\nAs we drove here, I asked J.R. what he thought when he was traded. Were you, I said, like, “Oh man, I have to live in Cleveland?”\n\n“Honestly?” he said, piloting his German spacecar through a desolate web of interstates. “I was petrified. Seriously. I didn't know what to expect. I thought: The weather is gonna be horrible. There's going to be nowhere to go out to eat. There's going to be nowhere to party.”\n\nFuture—“Real Sisters”—was on his car stereo. The spacecar dampened ambient noise so severely that the Cleveland we passed through—the unlit bungalows of Brook Park, the burn-off flame over one of Cleveland's last operational steel plants—felt immaterial, like a “gritty” title sequence for a new season of True Detective.\n\nIs it the last place, I asked, voicing the fear we all have as Cleveland sports fans, people want to play?\n\n“There,” J.R. said. “And probably Utah.”\n\nLeaving the deer to their supper now, we approached the door. There they all were, the dinner guests, crowded around the kitchen island, bathed in buttery light. J.R., this might be the most boring night of your entire star-crossed life, I thought.\n\nAnd then we are inside the house and they're all here, staring at us. Surprised! (No one knew J.R. was coming.) Dewy-eyed! Totally pleasant! In normal clothes, the kind of clothes you and I might be wearing right now in our normal houses! Not just my old pal Megan (I once threw her mom into the pool! One of those stories you think is hilarious until you try it out at a rehearsal dinner) and her husband, the affable Rob. Jody and Heather Herzog, who own three Fleet Feet shoe franchises! Ted and Lisa Bryan from down the block! Stacy and Jon Stoller, who do something and live somewhere!\n\nMegan proffers a bottle of Macallan and J.R. is all like, For sure, Macallan, fill it all the way up. He doesn't drink much of it. In fact, I don't see him drink a sip. But he knows how to be a good guest. And then it isn't long before all the kids come in from wherever they were and just stare at J. R. Smith like he can't see them, too. And J. R. Smith just loves it. It seems to make him physically stronger. He has grown an inch. J. R. Smith, turns out, really likes to please people.\n\nOne of the kids delivers this little rehearsed question: Excuse me J.R. I love basketball in fact I just came from basketball I love to learn would you help me with my jump shot later? And J.R. says yeah of course he'll help the kid with his jump shot. Then he says, “Wait, when you're playing do you ever pass it?” And the kid says yes. And J.R. says, “Man, don't pass it. Shoot! Every time you get it, shoot.” And everyone just falls out. Because that's the bad rap on J.R.! But see, J.R. is making it okay for you to laugh at J.R.\n\n\"I tell [LeBron] you can't have everything,\" J.R. says. \"You have to give up one thing, and it just so happened it's your hair.\"\n\nThis, by the way, is the insolvable, fascinating, sports-geek-worthy problem of J. R. Smith. He is the most beautiful shooter in America. I mean maybe Steph Curry is more beautiful, fine, if you want to argue that. But who really cares, because the point is J. R. Smith is a beautiful basketball player. But he also terrifies you. He is so good, he can actually lose the game for you. He is one of the few people in professional sports whose talent is actually a liability. If he didn't know he could do almost anything, he wouldn't always be so tempted to try. This is the man who said that he would name his autobiography Open Shots Are Boring. What I mean is, if you got points for difficulty, for audacity (and for being suspended by the league for punching Boston Celtics [who totally deserved it] in the playoffs), then J. R. Smith would atomize the competition and be an All-Star every year. But as it is, he is a guy who comes off the bench for a very good basketball team to provide “spark.” Who averaged about 11 points per game for the Cavs last year. J. R. Smith is a beautiful basketball player who sometimes, but inevitably, breaks your heart. Before unbreaking it. Before breaking it again. It is why he is an object of fascination. He is the ur-figure for a certain type of sportswriter more interested in characters than stats. Anyway.\n\nWhen the kids retreat, beaten back by their parents (Give him some space! Stop staring at him!), J.R. is like, “Man I'm starving! Isn't anyone going to ask me to eat?” And we all laugh at that, too. What a nice guy! J.R. helps himself to some tasty newfangled mashed-potato thing, some delicious flank steak carved up right there by Rob Fellinger, some kind of broccoli that had been murdered in a pot and displayed gruesomely before us like the limp quarry of a house cat. Everyone's feeling comfortable now, and the questions are rapid-fire. What did you think of China when you played there? “China was the worst place I've ever been in my life.” What do you think about Ohio not passing that marijuana-legalization initiative? “Man, if you'd passed it, I wouldn't have to leave in the off-season!” How can you concentrate when you're shooting free throws and everyone's yelling?! “That's easy. It's when you're in Utah and people are shouting the N-word that's tough.” Really? we all say. “Really,” he says. “Really.”\n\nWhat about Shump's hair? I ask a little later, about his teammate Iman Shumpert, who wears a kind of retro flattop. What do you think of that? Do you think he looks like Grace Jones? Are you pro Shump's hair?\n\n“No,” he says, laughing. “No, I'm not.”\n\nThe bottom line is: What a guest J. R. Smith is. If you're having a dinner party with fortysomethings at your house in a mild suburb of any city, you really ought to think about inviting 30-year-old basketball star J. R. Smith. I have to drag him away from a conversation about the merits of golf courses in Cleveland so we can make it on time to the charity event he's due at. On his way out, he promises to join Megan for a foursome at the Mayfield Sand Ridge country club.\n\nLet's get back to the hairstyles of the Cleveland Cavaliers for a minute. Because this is journalism. And at another point in the evening I will succeed in breaking J.R. down about LeBron's hair.\n\n“I tell him you can't have everything,” J.R. says. “I tell him all the time: You can't have it all! You have to give up one thing, and it just so happened it's your hair. If someone told me I'm gonna give you $600 million but I'm going to take your hair? Take my hair!”\n\nFrom Pepper Pike, I direct J. R. Smith west, toward downtown Cleveland and the Quicken Loans Arena for his charity event. J.R. doesn't know Cleveland, really. He knows the West Side a little, he knows how to get to the practice facility, the arena. Pretty much the rest of the city is just a blank space overlaid by the metallic glow of Google Maps.\n\n“I loved that,” J. R. Smith says when I ask about the dinner party. “I'm telling you, I love doing stuff like that. That was super dope.”\n\nI kind of should have known J. R. Smith would be more than comfortable around some soccer moms. I should have known it because he's from suburban New Jersey. I should have known it when I picked him up in his own mild Cleveland suburb. When I saw a friendly neighbor wife in yoga pants leave the house next door and wave at us as she took her yellow Lab for a walk. (This friendly neighbor wife was, J.R. tells me, the wife of Cleveland Browns All-Pro left tackle Joe Thomas. Arguably the most loved athlete in Cleveland, besides LeBron James.) J.R. says he's living a different kind of life now. He had an epiphany over the summer, and he immediately broke up with the woman he'd been dating, got engaged to the mother of one of his daughters, and has been living with the two of them since August, as a family.\n\n“I couldn't just keep jumping onto another ship without knowing the direction it's going,” J.R. tells me. “I've been with some of the most quote-unquote beautiful women in the world. But they're so ugly on the inside.”\n\nYou're 30. And I don't think, I said, people generally understand about marriage until they're 30. You're waiting for this perfect relationship with no problems. And by 30, when that hasn't happened, you think: Oh, maybe that's not real.\n\n“Yes, absolutely,” J.R. says. “That's exactly what happened. If I'm going to be miserable, I'd rather be miserable with her than anybody else.”\n\nYou're a true romantic.\n\n“Hahahahaha!”\n\nCould it be that J. R. Smith is finally contented? I have a deep question, I say to J.R. What did you think your career was going to be like when you came into the NBA out of high school? Age 19. First round of the draft.\n\n“It's like on Christmas. And you write your Christmas list out. And you're going to get everything. And then you get clothes. Where's my lightsaber? Where's my G.I. Joe with the kung fu grip? And it's not even wrapped like that, in the big red-white-and-green Santa Claus snowflakes. It's paper like how you used to wrap your books from school.”\n\nThis is surprising. Because driving toward the three lonely skyscrapers of downtown Cleveland, he does not sound contented. He sounds kind of hopeless.\n\nHow do you feel about your career at this point? I ask.\n\n“Disheartened, honestly. Yeah, for sure.”\n\nBy now we have pulled underneath the Q, and J.R. is distracted by the car he's parking behind. A futuristic white BMW i8 that neither of us has ever seen before and seems to run on sunlight.\n\n“Wow, whose the fuck is that?” J.R. says. “It's gotta be 'Bron.”\n\n(The parking-garage guy says it's 'Bron.)\n\nI don't know if everything they say about how LeBron is the real G.M. of the Cavs is true. But it is a team that he's built. Everyone around LeBron knows he is lucky to be here, anointed.\n\n“You would never go out and party on this team,” J.R. says in the midst of telling me how much he loves Cleveland, what an underestimated city it is. “Once you're on a team like this, you're just so locked in. When you see someone like LeBron in the gym around the clock? Usually it's the guys who want to get better so they can get more playing time who are always in the gym. But if you've got four MVPs, two championships, two Finals MVPs…”\n\nIs there a sense of expectation from him?\n\n“Oh, for sure. If you're here for any other reason than to get better and help us win, then you're here for the wrong reason. And he'll tell anybody that—he doesn't care. You could be mad at him or whatever. If you're not here to win? Time for you to go.”\n\nPeople are always writing stories about how this year J. R. Smith is finally growing up. He keeps telling us he's turning a corner, and his mistakes seem so correctable because they're the mistakes of someone with impulse-control problems, not an evil heart. And then he keeps making them. But I don't know, I kind of think this is the time and place when J.R. will, as at a dinner party at Megan Fellinger's, be loved and love back. Because Cleveland loves its athletes like no other city (except, like, Milwaukee and Minneapolis and Indianapolis and probably other 'apolises). Because you know the nightclub J.R. will be accused of choking a man next to in New York next week? They don't have that kind of nightclub in Cleveland. J. R. Smith, Cleveland will say, you're a little crazy, but you're our crazy.\n\nYou have to understand what it's like to be a fan in Cleveland. Yes, Cleveland never wins. Anything. Ever. But it's not just that Cleveland fans are spiritually destitute. It's that Cleveland loves its sports stars like no city that has lots of other things to love could. I mean, until LeBron came back, the most beloved sports hero in Cleveland was Joe Thomas, J.R.'s neighbor, who is a left tackle on a terrible football team. Remember, after “The Decision,” when the people of Cleveland took to the streets, lost their ever-loving minds, rended their garments, cried into their pierogies, and burned their LeBron jerseys? And everyone was like LeBron will never be welcomed back here! What a misinterpretation. That was like a guy who's going out with the hottest girl in his high school, and then she breaks up with him, and then he rips up the painting she made for him in the middle of the cafeteria, being all dramatic in a self-sabotaging effort to get her back. Of course you left, LeBron. Everyone leaves. We're not allowed to hope for nice things. We hate you we never wanted you. P.S. Give me a call sometime? I think this is exactly the kind of place where J. R. Smith might find contentedness."
