        "text": "2021\n\nGrants for Artistic Projects\n\nOrisons\n\nCommission in-situ by Marguerite Humeau\n\nBlack Cube, A Nomadic Art Museum\n\nJune 2022\n\nCurated by Cortney L. Stell\n\nFrench artist Marguerite Humeau’s Orisons is an unprecedented, large-scale, newly commissioned earthwork situatd in rural Colorado. Measuring up to 10 acres in diameter, the earthwork is reminiscent of a gigantic crop circle and is visible from land or sky. The work itself consists of a repurposed center-pivot irrigation system that mechanically spins, collecting and distributing rainwater in a circular pattern to stimulate the growth of native, medicinal plants. Planted according to the changing seasons, Orisons visually transforms over time, inviting visitors to experience colorful blossoms in the Spring and withering shades of brown in the Winter.\n\nThrough a hypothetical and resonant narrative, Humeau’s earthwork surfaces a vital question—what happens when our aquifers dry up? In this work, the irrigation system is akin to an otherworldly being on a cosmic quest to produce rainfall, healing the soil and reviving vegetation, before becoming extinct. Using partially harvested rainwater as a sustainable water source, the center-pivot irrigation system is programmed to disperse water at an environmentally safe pressure rate on a plot of land that contains planted seeds. In this way, the earthwork explores the relationship between land and sky. Orisons connects a constellation of subjects, including innovative regenerative farming practices, ancient plant medicine and contemporary mythologies, which altogether highlight the interconnections between humankind and the environment.\n\n2021 Triennale: Soft Water Hard Stone\n\nGroup show including Alex Ayed and Gaëlle Choisne\n\nNew Museum, NYC\n\nOctober 26, 2021 – January 23, 2022\n\nCurated by Margot Norton and Jamillah James\n\nThe title of the 2021 Triennial, “Soft Water Hard Stone” is taken from a Brazilian proverb: Água mole em pedra dura, tanto bate até que fura (soft water on hard stone hits until it bores a hole). The proverb can be said to have two meanings: that if one persists long enough, the desired effect can eventually be achieved; and that time can destroy even the most perceptibly solid materials. The title speaks to ideas of resilience and perseverance, as it evokes the impact that an insistent yet discrete gesture can have in time. It also provides a metaphor for resistance, as water—a transparent, fluid, and often underestimated material comprising most of our bodies and the planet itself—is capable of eventually dissolving stone—an inflexible substance associated with monumentality, yet also composed of tiny particles that can collapse under pressure. In this moment of profound change, where structures that we once thought to be stable are revealed to be precarious, not working, or on the verge of collapse, the 2021 Triennial acknowledges artists and collectives reimagining traditional models, materials, and techniques beyond established paradigms. Their works exalt states of transformation, calling attention to the malleability of structures, permeable walls, porous and unstable surfaces, and the fluid and adaptable potential of both technological and organic media. The works included in the exhibition recall a sensibility that is simultaneously prehistoric and post-apocalyptic, looking back toward overlooked artistic traditions and technological building blocks, while at the same time looking forward toward the immaterial and the transitory, and creative modes not yet imagined.\n\nFrench-Tunisian artist Alex Ayed will present a new body of sculptural works made specifically for the 2021 New Museum Triennial. Inspired by the exhibition’s title and theme, Ayed will present works that respond to the architecture of the New Museum, and experiment with material capabilities as their form changes throughout the duration of the show. The materials Ayed commonly uses, which range from found objects that he sources along his journeys, to sand, to Tunisian olive oil soap, are those that each come with rich histories, yet are not commonly used in a traditional art context, and point toward possibilities beyond those typically housed within the walls of the institution. As borders have been shut and travel has been limited due to the global pandemic this year, Ayed has turned much of his attention to researching modes of sea travel. The works Ayed will present in the 2021 Triennial will draw from this research, and the winds that make nautical travel unpredictable, yet cause boats to move faster in order to reach their destination. For Ayed, this metaphor of the wind speaks to our current moment of instability, which may cause chaos yet pushes us to realize necessary change.\n\nThe work of the French-Haitian artist Gaëlle Choisne addresses many of the disorders that plague our society: from the climate crisis and the exploitation of natural resources, to the structural remains of colonialism. For the 2021 New Museum Triennial, Choisne will develop a new video and sculptural installation responding to the exhibition’s title and theme. As she often draws from Caribbean and European literary sources, her new work is inspired by Roland Barthes’ 1977 text “A Lover’s Discourse,” as well as Choisne’s ongoing research on systemic racism, violence, and surveillance. The installation incorporates found objects, some of which have been gathered by the artist for many years, as well as materials such as Plexiglas sheets often used for hygienic or safety purposes, and metallic objects made by the artist in a facility that manufactures weapons in the South of France. Choisne’s project will also incorporate architectural elements using mycelium and draws connections between a fungus-like bacteria that can grow in the stomach of dogs and elicit violent behavior in the animal, and propagating police brutality. In this work, Choisne expands from Roland Barthes’ quote “I am the one who waits”, to add: “I am the one who waits, for a new life, equal for everybody.”\n\nSolo Show by Iván Argote\n\nArtpace San Antonio\n\nJuly 15-September 15, 2021\n\nCurated by Pilar Tompkins Rivas\n\nBorn in Bogotá, D.C., Colombia in 1983, Argote graduated from École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris in 2009 and has remained living and working in Paris since. His work explores the relationship between history, politics, and the construction of our own subjectivities. His films, sculptures, collages, and public space installations attempt to generate questions about how we relate to others, to the state, to heritage, and traditions. His works are critiques, sometimes anti-establishment, and deal with the idea of bringing affects to politics, and politics to affects with a strong and tender tone. Argote makes political and sociological critiques and proposals using affection, emotions, and humor as subversive tools, with which he tries to generate spaces of dialogue away from polarization and confrontational rhetoric.\n\nArgote’s artistic career has gained significant momentum over the last several years, yet he still has a limited exhibition history in the United States. In a time when the United States is grappling with its own identity, history, and role in the global community, highlighted in an unprecedented insurrection of the US Capital, it is a pertinent time for Argote to explore the themes of his practice within the context and physical location of the United States, especially in the South where these political and societal tensions often most clearly emerge.\n\nDuring his stay, Argote will be provided with a studio space and he will have the support and resources he needs to fully focus on his work at hand, respond to his environment, and actualize his work in whichever form he sees most fit. Once the work is produced, his installation will stay on display at Artpace for two months, and it will be admission-free for the public to see seven days a week. Additionally, the exhibition will be accessible virtually through high-quality 3D scans that produce dynamic 3D tours of the space.\n\nImpossible Mediations: Silence and Oblivion are Information\n\nSolo show by Clémence de Montgolfier\n\nLos Angeles Contemporary Archive\n\nEnd of 2021 – April 2022\n\nCurated by Hailey Loman\n\nThe project will take the form of a solo exhibition and onsite research by French artist Clémence de Montgolfier at Los Angeles Contemporary Archive, a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles, an art archive, library, and exhibition platform that collects underexposed artistic modes of expression happening in our current moment, challenging the notion of archive and art space. De Montgolfier, whose work investigates the politics of public speaking, representation, and the mediations of speech, also a Dr. in Media Studies from the Sorbonne University in Paris, has started working on this artistic research in 2020. Her project entitled Les Médiation impossibles (Impossible Mediations), originally supported by the Artists’ Foundation (Paris, FR), has resulted in the production of a series of artworks examining conflict resolution, the government of the self and others (in the sense of Michel Foucault’s eponymous book) and the concepts of the production of “truth” and “reconciliation”. In this project the artist has chosen to investigate, almost as one would a case study, “Truth and Reconciliation Commissions”, a model of transitional justice commissions that have been organized in countries in democratic transition since the 1980s. Their aim is to publicly acknowledge and uncover human rights violations committed by authoritarian groups or regimes and to propose forms of reparation.\n\nThis multifaceted project is based on research, meetings and filmed interviews conducted with former commissioners and staff who have served on truth and reconciliation commissions (TRCs) around the world, and also with experts who have testified in these commissions or studied them. The artist will particularly look at the history of the South African Commission, the more recent case of the Canadian Truth commission on residential schools (2010-2015), and the current ongoing independent commission on sexual abuse in the Catholic Church (2018-2021, Paris, France).\n\nCalifornia Institute of the Arts – Wattis Institute\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nCurated by Anthony Huberman\n\nOther Repercussions proposes “the percussive” as an aesthetic and political concept. While percussive instruments have remained at the center of most musical traditions around the world for thousands of years, this exhibition moves beyond the framework of music and outlines a broader “percussive field” as a model for art and politics.\n\nCentral to the exhibition will be works by French artists or artists living in France, each of which speaks to the exhibition’s central themes in powerful ways. Tarek Atoui, who has a long-standing practice related to sound’s physical impact on bodies and surfaces, conceives a new piece for the exhibition. Shot with indigenous people in the Colombian Amazon, Paris-based artist Marcos Avila Forero’s Atratro (2014) captures bodies in a river, communicating with each other, and with the river itself, by slapping the water in coordinated rhythms. Paris-based artist Angelica Mesiti’s film The Calling (2013-2014) explores different rural communities whose inhabitants communicate via whistling. Laure Provost’s early single channel video works don’t depict anything percussive or musical but turn sounds, images, and words into a percussive sequence of quick edits and sudden stop-and-starts. Cyprien Gaillard’s early apocalyptic video Desniansky Raion (2008) combines the clash between two groups of hooligans and the demolition of an apartment tower block to create forceful violence of different types.\n\nWith these and other works, Other Repercussions asks what the percussive can do: what does its abstraction mobilize and what does it threaten? What is a percussive gesture, a percussive shape, a percussive image, a percussive story? What is a percussive form of being together? Artists and writers have long used a musical vocabulary to talk about art and politics, and, borrowing from the writer and poet Fred Moten, the exhibition asks whether the percussive can be a way to ensemble—to become a political model where diverging perspectives don’t agree, disagree, or even work towards a consensus but where they gather, co-exist, listen to each other, make something with each other, and mutually adapt to a context as it evolves, like an ensemble.\n\nSouthwind\n\nSolo show by Maxime Berthou\n\nLouisiana Museum Foundation – New Orleans Jazz Museum\n\nOctober 2021 (Prospekt New Orleans Triennial)\n\nCurated by Amy Mackie\n\nArtists Maxime Berthou (France) and Mark Požlep (Slovenia) embarked on a practice-based research journey on the Mississippi River from September 2 to October 20, 2019. Their means of transportation was a hand-built 20-foot (6-meter) steam-powered paddle boat named Thumpa. Their goal was to research and experience contemporary American life along this mythical river. Following the methodology and chronology of a research-action project, “Southwind” is an investigation into personal experience, transcription, and disproportion through the production mechanisms of an artistic project. Endurance related to traveling on this specific vessel allowed the artists to interact with a diversity of social environments and realities along the 2,320-mile (3,730 km) long river. Though their role was primarily to document daily life along this infamous stretch of America, their personal interactions positioned them as active co-creators. The project was documented in the form of video, writing, photographs, sound recordings, and drawings. The artistic outputs are a film that includes interviews and portraits of the people and locals they encountered along the river, an artist book in the format of a journal, and an installation that includes drawings, photographs, and other ephemera. They continue to engage in educational workshops and presentations about the project in Europe and will conduct a similar educational initiative in the U.S.\n\nThe New Orleans Jazz Museum will present an outdoor screening of the film Southwind in October 2021 during the international triennial, P.5 (Prospect New Orleans). The film will be presented in the form of a “Cinema Concert.” Live narration and voiceovers for the film will be performed by performance artist David Freeman, followed by live music by New Orleans jazz musicians. Screenings will include two nights of live performances. Several installations that include evidence and further documentation of this project will be presented inside the museum and will be on view throughout the triennial. The film will additionally be available online. Amy Mackie is the curator of the presentation of “Southwind” at the New Orleans Jazz Museum and PARSE NOLA, her nonprofit residency and art program based in New Orleans is serving as a collaborator and producer of this project.\n\nThe Language in Common\n\nGroup show including Julien Creuzet\n\nWesleyan University\n\nSeptember 14 – December 12, 2021\n\nCurated by Benjamin Chaffee\n\nThe Language in Common, a group exhibition planned for September 14 – December 12, 2021 in the Ezra and Cecile Zilkha Gallery, Center for the Arts will feature the work of five artists working at the intersection of visual art, poetry, and performance, including Julien Creuzet (b.1986, France), Cecilia Vicuña (b.1948, Chile), Tanya Lukin Linklater (b.1976, Alutiiq), Jasper Marsalis (b.1995, US), and Alice Notley (b.1945, US). Creuzet’s newly commissioned installation works are envisioned as a central element of this exhibition.\n\nThe Language in Common presents artistic practices that move in the space between poetry, visual art, and performance. Through an exhibition, public programming, and a chapbook publication series, the project aims towards what the poet Alice Notley calls, “the language that holds all being together.” There is language that precedes us. Poetry that precedes us. Art that precedes us. Moving beyond the spectacle of their origination this project seeks to allow memory as a creative act in the process of making experience common, of making space for a new imaginary.\n\nJulien Creuzet’s work will create, with Cecilia Vicuña’s, a dynamic comparison sharing a focus on the injustices of Neoliberalism. The exhibition will include Creuzet’s poetry, sculpture, wall-based photographic murals and video, as counterpoints to Vicuña’s exploration of the Andean quipu. While engaging similar ideas of resistance to hegemonic political narratives, Creuzet and Vicuña work from very different diasporic positions, and Creuzet digs deeper in the nature of those very positions with this conceptualization of “geolocalization,” and the different impact of Neoliberalism on individuals depending on social position, geography, history, race, gender… He raises the idea that we are global subjects, though hyperlocal in expression, with the influence of Edouard Glissant’s “Le Tout Monde” (Whole World, or One World).\n\nBreaking Water\n\nGroup show\n\nCAC Cincinnati\n\nMay 6, 2022 – August 15, 2022\n\nCurated by Amara Antilla and Clelia Coussonnet\n\nBreaking Water is a group exhibition bringing together works in installation, video, photography, painting, sculpture, and performance that offer a range of approaches to the subject of water, liquidity, and feminism. The exhibition will debut four new commissions by Paul Maheke, Josèfa Ntjam, Claudia Peña Salinas,and a collaborative work by Calista Lyon and Carmen Winant alongside new and existing work by an international group of artists whose work explores themes of fluidity, connectivity, and resistance, and addresses timely concerns including water rights, climate change, and the effects of natural disasters. Co-curated by CAC Senior Curator Amara Antilla and independent curator and writer Clelia Coussonnet, Breaking Water will be on view at the CAC from May 6 through August 15, 2022. The exhibition will be accompanied by a parallel film screening program that extends the exhibition’s central themes and a hybrid catalogue.\n\nFull artist list:\n\nMartha Atienza (b. 1981, Bantayan, Philippines; lives and works in Bantayan, Philippines)\n\nMarcos Ávila Forero (b. 1983, Paris, France; lives and works in Paris, France)\n\nCecilia Bengolea (b. 1979, Buenos Aires, Argentina; lives and works in Paris, France)\n\nAndrea Carlson (b. 1979, Grand Portage Ojibwe, USA; lives and works in Chicago, IL)\n\nCarolina Caycedo (b. 1978, London, UK; lives and works in Los Angeles, CA)\n\nJes Fan (b. 1990, Ontario, Canada; lives and works in New York, NY)\n\nCleo Fariselli (b. 1982, Cesenatico, Italy; lives and works in Turin, Italy)\n\nSaodat Ismailova (b. 1981, Tashkent, Uzbekistan; lives and works in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and Paris, France)\n\nJaana Laakkonen (b. 1985, Joensuu, Finland; lives and works in Helsinki, Finland)\n\nCalista Lyon (b. 1986, Nagambie, Australia; lives and works in Charlottesville, VA) and Carmen Winant (b. 1983, San Francisco, CA; lives and works in Columbus, OH)\n\nPaul Maheke (b. 1985, Brive-la-Gaillarde, France; lives and works in London, UK)\n\nJosèfa Ntjam (b. 1992, Metz, France; lives and works in Saint-Étienne, France)\n\nClaudia Peña Salinas (b. 1975, Montemorelos, Nuevo León, Mexico; lives and works in Brooklyn, NY)\n\nVian Sora (b. 1976, Baghdad, Iraq; lives and works in Louisville, KY)\n\nNomeda and Gediminas Urbonas (collaborators since 1997; live and work in Vilnius, Lithuania and Cambridge, MA)\n\nWho Speaks for the Oceans?\n\nGroup show including Marguerite Humeau, Josèfa Ntjam, Jacques Cousteau, Chris Marker\n\nMishkin Gallery (Baruch College, CUNY), NYC\n\nSpring 2022\n\nCurated byAlaina Claire Feldman and David Gruber\n\nWhale songs are like canaries in a coalmine. They are barometers of the health of our oceans. As we approach a crucial moment concerning the condition of our planet, listening to their vocalizations can bring us closer to understanding and encouraging action towards stewardship of the oceans. Engaging contemporary artworks, cultural artifacts, historical ephemera, and speculative futures, Who Speaks for the Oceans? will consider humanity’s desire to experience and communicate with the non- terrestrial, specifically focusing on an epistemological and historical analysis of what we think we know about life in the ocean. Many of these ideas have been informed by colonial, racialized, gendered, and terra-centric conventions alongside the production of nature, which will be exposed and critiqued through the multiple perspectives of an international group of artists.\n\nThe history of oceanography has a deep connection to French culture, as the country has over 4,500km of coastline. As early as the 1880s, France hosted its first public exhibition exclusively dedicated to the previously unknown wonders under the ocean, titled L’Exposition Sous-Marine du Travailleur et du Talisman and held at National Museum of Natural History in Paris. The exhibition was extremely popular and kickstarted the underwater craze which has since been a strong French tradition. The show aligns itself with this history and tradition by inviting a group of international artists, including four French artists: Marguerite Humeau, Josèfa Ntjam, Jacques Cousteau, Chris Marker, to questions what we think we know about life under the sea and contemporary human-animal relationships.\n\nUsing the so called “whale song” as a primary example of the West’s oceanic desires to externalize, taxonomize and dominate nature and other species, artwork and materials in this exhibition will also consider how technology, assumed to be indexical and scientific, has informed imaginary and fantastical perspectives of non-terrestrial worlds. In order to understand and appreciate an entanglement with animals and the oceanic environment, we need to listen to their calls outside of patterns of consumption in order to develop meaningful relationships with them.\n\nWho Speaks for the Ocean? will take place at Mishkin Gallery at Baruch College, City University of New York and is curated by David Gruber, professor, marine biologist, and National Geographic Explorer and Alaina Claire Feldman, professor and Director/Curator of the Mishkin Gallery. The gallery is located in central Manhattan and is dedicated to interdisciplinary education and the advancement of art appreciation through new lenses. New commissions will be displayed alongside existing works and historical objects. A series of student-initiated public programs including workshops, listening sessions and artist talks will be developed in parallel to the exhibition. Who Speaks for the Oceans? engagement with local and international artists and a drive to engage students will create affective empathy for the fragility of our environment and the creative ways in which listening to one another can lead to productive solutions.\n\nSolo show by Etel Adnan\n\nGuggenheim Museum, NYC\n\nOctober 2021 – January 2022\n\nCurated by Katherine Brinson\n\nOpening October 22, 2021 and running through January 10, 2022, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum will present a solo show dedicated to the works of Etel Adnan, famous Lebanese painter based in France (title to be announced). Etel Adnan will run alongside an exhibition dedicated to the works of Wassily Kandinsky. Operating much in the same way as the landmark R.H. Quaytman: + x, Chapter 34 and Hilma af Klint: Paintings for the Future exhibitions, Adnan and Kandinsky’s work will mirror each other across the decades in these dual presentations, encouraging audiences to draw connections between these revolutionary, modernist artists.\n\nEtel Adnan’s show will occupy the first three ramps of the Guggenheim’s iconic rotunda with approximately 90 works of art, followed by the Kandinsky exhibition above. Adnan’s work will be the first of three contemporary artists to be presented alongside the Kandinsky exhibition, which will run until August 2022.\n\nThis focused exhibition will survey Adnan’s influential practice over the course of seven decades, encompassing paintings, tapestries, films, and her “leporellos”: accordion-fold paper books that straddle her linguistic and pictorial registers. The first solo presentation of an Arab American artist to be staged in the Guggenheim Museum’s rotunda, the exhibition will elucidate the artist’s longstanding fascination with the work of Vasily Kandinsky and the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. This exhibition is organized by Katherine Brinson, Daskalopoulos Curator, Contemporary Art, and Lauren Hinkson, Associate Curator, Collections.\n\nBorn almost a century ago in Lebanon, Etel Adnan (b. 1925, Beirut) has forged a creative language of singular power and lyricism. Her expansive career spans the mid-century to the present day and across multiple languages, continents, and disciplines. While Adnan’s poetry, fiction, and journalism has offered searing political responses to events such as the Vietnam War (1961-75) and Lebanese Civil War (1975- 90), her visual art is intensely engaged with the transcendent themes of nature and memory. Characteristically modest in size, her paintings are created in a single sitting, their intense colors applied in decisive strokes with a palette knife. Obsessively iterating on recurring themes such as a mountain landscape, the rising and setting sun, and the ocean, they distill a sense of both the fleeting moment and the eternal.\n\nCuratorial Fellowship\n\nTelepathies\n\nby Ana Iwataki\n\nIndependent Curator\n\nJune 2022\n\nIn collaboration with French curator Marion Vasseur Raluy, American artist Alexandra Grant and acclaimed writer Hélène Cixous, independent curator and current University of Southern California doctoral student Ana Iwataki will undertake on-site research for a project titled Telepathies. Following a year of remote collaboration, research and preparatory work with contacts and partner institutions in France and the US, the four will meet in Paris to conduct research in Hélène Cixous’s archives at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.\n\nTelepathies is a project emerging from a long history of recurring dialogic, transnational and translational collaborations between the contributors, who will also use the month in Paris to record their conversations and conduct studio visits with other artists working in relational modes. The work will be a testament to Iwataki’s extensive and ongoing exploration of translation, fluidity, the porosity of boundaries and the potential of mutual influence. It will be grounded in Cixous’s writing and will bring other artists into dialogue with Grant’s art. The vision for Telephathies is a work grounded in archetypes, centered on two objects—a tarot deck and a book—that will embody a cosmology of deep listening and relation to the other, enabling live performance and participatory elements on both sides of the Atlantic. At the crossroad of various kinds of knowledge, Telepathies will forge connections and collapse the space separating the academy, art institutions and activist spaces. The team plan to partner with institutions in both Paris and Los Angeles to act as hosts for workshops, readings, collective translation sessions, listening sessions, performances and book launches.\n\nA curator, translator and activist, Iwataki often investigates the material and metaphorical properties of water, as well as processes of ingestion, digestion and deconstruction. Her work reflects a commitment to reimagining creative and ethical ways of being with and for others, and her current role as a doctoral student at USC will allow Telepathies to be presented within the academy and in conferences, research clusters and other sites of exchange.\n\nArtist Residencies\n\nDuo Ittah Yoda (Kai Yoda and Virgile Ittah)\n\nChronos, with ISCP (International Studio & Curatorial Program), New York\n\nSpring 2022\n\nCHRONOS is a three-phase, international project culminating in a residency with ISCP and exhibitions in New York and London. During the three-month residency in New York, artistic duo Ittah Yoda will conduct research with writers and researchers in AI, develop texts and publication material, host talks and exhibitions, research and produce new glass sculptures with UrbanGlass, and present a solo exhibition with Foreign & Domestic.\n\nIttah Yoda is a duo formed in 2016 by Japanese-Swedish artist Kai Yoda and French artist Virgile Ittah. Hailing from diverse backgrounds, the two have developed their artistic identity through digitally-enabled cross-cultural creative collaborations. Focusing on the unconscious, insecurity and anxiety, they seek to unlock new understandings of the self through re-enactment of trauma and repeated behavior. Real and virtual forms are created in an effort to connect with a shared human heritage and a universal unconscious. By encouraging the active participation of the public, Ittah Yoda highlight the performative dimension of their installations. The duo attempts to create a new reality under a rhizomic network of connections between the work and the viewer, bridging virtual and physical realities, forming new landscapes and shaping the world of tomorrow.\n\nAt the dawn of a new era, a post-anthropocentric society where human nature must be reset, the CHRONOS project questions the separation of object and subject as well as the very split between culture and nature with regard to our interdependence with other beings. An immersive installation will link the real and virtual worlds. Physical and VR sculptures will assume a hybrid form, juxtaposing digital forms and 3D reconstruction from underwater flora and fauna. Artificial intelligence will allow user-viewers to download the installation or watch it online from various places. With this project, Ittah Yoda seek to open up new possibilities for experimentation and communication by encompassing an ever larger and more diverse audience—an audience ever more involved in the act of (co-) creation.\n\nMarie Angeletti\n\nArtist space 202202 Delirious New York, with MoMA PS1, New York\n\nOctober 2021 – January 2022\n\nDuring this four-month residency, Marseille-born artist Marie Angeletti will conduct research in four parts: research into past alternative spaces; recorded interviews; photography (ongoing slide work); and research into forms of alternative arts education. She intends these four different modes of research to proceed apace: to research archivally at PS1 and MOMA library, in the hope of uncovering alternative models that thrived in the city’s past; to engage with local communities via interviews; to research the city photographically, and to explore new ways of an alternative arts education.\n\nShe will be researching on a daily basis at the PS1 Library Archives in consultation with the support of Ruba Katrib, curator at MoMA PS1. Her aim is to excavate specific histories of public spaces in New York. Decentralization has been the goal of many artists and groups hoping to revitalize the art world and reach a broader audience, and each generation learns something from the last. These objectives are all too relevant as we face an unprecedented need for intelligent and effective art communities and education in 2021 and beyond. As part of her research, she will list and visit private and corporate collections, alternative exhibition spaces, and art clubs to see what exists, how art is shown, structured, and financed. She’s planning to visit the Ford Foundation, the DIA foundation, the Foundation for contemporary Arts, all the university art collections (NYU, Columbia, Hunter, Cooper, CUNY and some others), the Thomas Johnson Hill Collection, the National Arts Club, Issue Project Room, Blank Forms, the Poetry Project, the Wooster Group, a few hotels in the city which own large art collections like the Gramercy Hotel, where the Armory show began, the Chelsea hotel, and the Hotel 17 (a really important landmark for downtown history). She’s also planning on visiting alternatives spaces, where art is present but not acknowledged, for example, the Tompkins Square Park public library, the Woodhull hospital in Brooklyn that has some Keith Haring murals on view, St John the Divine Cathedral and the Judson Church as well as the Port Authority bus terminals.\n\nShe would like to interview artists, writers, and musicians who have been involved or are still presently involved in these alternative scenarios. She will start to interview the previous generation of artists, like the filmmaker Jeff Preiss, or the artist Karin Schneider who were part of the artists run space Orchard; the artists Julie Ault, Martin Beck, Douglas Ashford, who founded Group Material; current existing art spaces like the members of Artists Space, Reena Spaulings or Blankforms. She also intends to observe the city, documenting the everyday, using photography as a social and research practice. She will continue to work on a preexisting artwork, for which she already has two locations in mind (the windows of one of the NYU buildings around Washington Square, and the Whitney Museum windows on the Hudson River).\n\nEzra Jérémie Teboul\n\nBeyond Circuits with The Computer Music Center at Columbia University\n\nJune 1st – September 1st 2021\n\nThe focus of this project is the Columbia Computer Music Center (CMC) and its history of homemade electronic art objects.\n\nEzra J. Teboul (born in Paris, 1991) is an artist and researcher focusing on the medium of electronic components and systems. In conjunction with sound and visualizations of voltages and other signals, the circuit, analog or digital, is used as a looking glass through which the public can obtain a close look at the systems which have allowed our lives to become so connected and electrifying. These circuits also propose alternative visions of utilizations for these components, asking: what would happen if we focused on the qualities of collective poetic experiences, rather than on the acceleration of exchanges?\n\nHis research will result in four “augmented sculptures” which bring attention to a selection of objects from the Computer Music Center’s history making their history and functionality accessible to an everyday audience. These sculptures will combine systems of electronic components, computer programs meant to be embedded alongside the circuitry, and augmented reality (AR) designs. While the physical aspects of the work offer an interactive experience highlighting the technological and musical developments of the center, the virtual elements provide information regarding the CMC’s musical, historical and visual heritage.\n\nIn an era where the robustness of our communication infrastructure has come under scrutiny, as millions telecommute to work amidst a global pandemic, the relationship between the technical underpinnings of art and of our everyday, and of real access to research on that relationship appears as a crucial point of examination for the theorist, the practitioner, and the public widely construed. If possible, these objects will be introduced via an educational and interactive media workshop.\n\n2020\n\nGrants for Artistic Projects\n\nSpaces of the Mind\n\nGroup show with Pierre Charpin\n\nNoguchi Museum, NYC\n\nSeptember 22, 2021 to February 13, 2022\n\nCurated by Dakin Hart\n\nSpaces of the Mind is an artistic exhibition that explores the role of small spaces as portals to larger universes – a symbol of the expansive space inside an artist’s mind. It presents this dualism of artwork as both self-contained and representative of a greater world through four small spaces, each of which serves as a unique portal. These microcosmic projects are created by practitioners from around the world — Pierre Charpin, Paula Hayes, Takeshiro Matsuura, and Laurie Spiegel — and represent different fields of expertise. They will be installed near a permanent installation of Noguchi’s large stone sculptures.\n\nA central element of the exhibition will be Walls of Pierre Charpin’s Studio, by Pierre Charpin (b. 1962), a French designer and visual artist based in Paris. In one of the museum’s galleries, he will install a version of his studio walls, as well as meaningful objects that he has kept for decades, new items that inspire him, and personal sketches and projects. Walls of Pierre Charpin’s Studio will function as a site-specific installation that represents a simulation of Charpin’s rich thought process, giving visitors a chance to enter his studio and, by extension, his brain.\n\nGarmenting: Costume and Contemporary Art\n\nGroup show with Karina Bisch, Rafael Barontini, Cécile Bome, Louise Bourgeois, Annette Messager\n\nMuseum of Art and Design, NYC\n\nFebruary/March to September 2022\n\nCurated by Alexandra Schwartz\n\nThis exhibition chronicles contemporary art’s engagement with costume and how visual artists use garments to examine issues of identity, sexuality, and the body. This phenomenon may be identified by the term garmenting, or creating art for installations in the form of garments.\n\nGarmenting examines work by thirty international artists, who engage with costume yet fit into the category of visual artists. Among them are 5 French artists – both established names and emerging voices. The show will be organized around five interrelated themes. The first explores how gender and sexuality are exhibited through dress, beginning with artists from the 1960s who introduced garmenting into their visual arts practices, and continuing with artists who were influenced by second- and third-wave feminism. The second theme focuses on activism, examining how artists have used garments as agitprop and symbols of political violence’s effects on individual bodies. The third centers on works that explore the relationship between costume and cultural identities, particularly within the context of post-colonial and transnational discourses. Next, the fourth deals with issues of functionality, showcasing works that blur the line between art and fashion and question traditional divisions between disciplines. Finally, the fifth features artwork that doubles as costumes in live and videotaped performances and will include a fully integrated series of live events at MAD. Garmenting as a formal trope has various significations, and its current ubiquity testifies to many contemporary artists’ desire not only to upend distinctions between the “fine” and “applied” arts, but also to root their practices in a fundamental aspect of human life: the physical body and the clothing that adorns and protects it.\n\nScreening and Installation of Video Works by Michele Magema\n\nSolo project\n\nAurora Picture Show, Houston\n\nMay 2021\n\nCurated by Mary Magsamen\n\nThe Aurora Picture Show will present a one-night screening with the Congolese-French artist Michèle Magema. The screening, which will include 8 to 10 short video works, will focus on Magema’s unique perspective as an African female artist with a cultural heritage from both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and France.\n\nFollowing the screening, a discussion will be led by Raymond Gnanwo Hounfodji, a PhD in Francophone and African Literature and a Lecturer of French at the University of Houston who specializes in African and post/colonial literature and theater, as well as oral literature.\n\nCaroline Mesquita: l’amour à la machine\n\nSolo show\n\nBlaffer Art Museum, Houston\n\nJune 5 – November 13, 2021\n\nCurated by Steven Matijcio\n\nYoung French artist Caroline Mesquita has recently met remarkable international success: She has had solo exhibitions at the Galeria Municipal do Porto, the Kunsthalle Lissabon, and the Centre Pompidou and was awarded the prestigious 19th Fondation d’entreprise Ricard Prize in 2017.\n\nCaroline Mesquita is a sculptor and video artist who mainly works with metal. She creates radically imaginative sculptures of airplanes, spaceships and motorcycles, with raw material inspiring her to engage with notions of science fiction, religion, embodiment, transformation, sensuality, and sociability. Mesquita’s works are darkened, patinated, and roughly textured through an oxidation process. With this technique, Mesquita manipulates metal as if she were painting. These material transformations are the medium through which she tells stories about the human experience and action and exchange in relationships. She also creates videos, sonic environments and performative films, in which she herself appears, either around or using her metallic creations.\n\nDuring a formative road trip across the southwestern United States, Mesquita observed the effect of copper mining and how the coveted material is extracted from the earth. Seeing the “surreal red mountains” these mines produced created a searing ambivalence for her as she reached her ultimate destination: Marfa, Texas. To continue exploring the relationship between majesty and monstrosity, natural and manmade, she will produce a newly commissioned, site-specific installation in 2021, at the Blaffer Art Museum in Texas.\n\nCaroline Mesquita (b. 1989, Brest) lives and works in Marseille.\n\nVera Molnar: Variations\n\nSolo show\n\nBeall Center for Art and Technology – University of California, Irvine\n\nMarch 2022\n\nCurated by David Familian\n\nThis exhibition will examine Molnar’s art, ranging from her non-computational work to her early computer-generated drawings to more recent work that makes use of other media.\n\nVera Molnar, born in 1924 in Hungary, is a pioneer in the field of computational and algorithmic arts. As early as 1959, she began iterating combinatorial images, and, in 1968, she began working with computers, through which she created algorithmic paintings based on simple geometric shapes and geometrical themes.\n\nThe non-computational works include Molnar’s earliest experiments with chance operations, such as Interruption – Continuation (1961) and a series started after her visit to the Honeywell Bull Lab called Machine Imaginaire [Imaginary], which includes the work Trame De 81 Quadrilatères À La Machine Imaginaire [Quadrilateral 81 Frames In The Imaginary Machine] (1967).\n\nThe exhibition will also include multiple iterations of Molnar’s hand-made collages, paintings, installations, limited edition books and multiples.\n\nWitch Hunt\n\nGroup show with Bouchra Khalili\n\nHammer Museum, Los Angeles\n\nSeptember – December 2021\n\nCurated by Connie Butler\n\nThe exhibition will showcase the work of 15 midcareer artists working in a range of disciplines (sculpture, installation, painting, video, and performance), including the French-Moroccan artist Bouchra Khalili.\n\nWitch Hunt will offer a strong feminist perspective— spanning race, class, religion, ethnicity, and geography—and encourage dialogue about some of today’s most urgent issues, ranging from violence against women and transgender people to the right to free speech and protest in a democratic society.\n\nBouchra Khalili will present The Magic Lantern Project, a new installation that takes the lost and forgotten work of the radical, feminist Swiss filmmaker Carole Roussopoulos (b. 1945) as its starting point, including her internationalist videos on Jordan, the Black Panther party, and Algiers. Stemming from Khalili’s ongoing research in Roussopoulos’ archive, her project will reactivate and resuscitate the ghosts still haunting those lost tapes. The installation will feature a rich mix of 26 silk screen prints juxtaposed with edited archival footage of Roussopoulos’ films projected onto a large-scale magic lantern sculpture (one of the first pieces of projecting equipment). Together, these elements will convey a meditation on media as a nomadic and dissident form of witnessing, as well as a poignant history of migrations throughout time.\n\nThe exhibition will powerfully convey how feminist ideologies in art can meaningfully contribute to debates and reinforce the role that artists play in rendering the challenges we face as a society more visible. In our pivotal cultural and political moment, Witch Hunt—along with the accompanying catalogue and public programs—will provide an unprecedented forum for audiences to engage with female artists who are using their practice to explore questions of inequality and the erasure of feminist histories.\n\nDust Specks on the Sea: Contemporary Sculpture from the French Caribbean & Haiti – Touring show\n\nGroup show with: Mathieu Kleyebe Abonnenc, Julie Bessard, Hervé Beuze, Jean-François Boclé, Alex Burke, Vladimir Cybil Charlier, Gaëlle Choisne, Ronald Cyrille, Jean-Ulrick Désert, Kenny Dunkan, Edouard Duval-Carrié, Adler Guerrier, Jean-Marc Hunt, Fabiola Jean-Louis, Nathalie Leroy-Fiévée, Audry, Liseron-Monfils, Louisa Marajo, Ricardo Ozier-Lafontaine, Jérémie Paul, Marielle Plaisir, Tabita Rezaire, Yoan Sorin, Raphael Barontini, Sylvia Berté, Vickie Pierre, Michelle Lisa Polissant, and Kira Tippenhauer.\n\nHunter East Harlem Gallery\n\n516 Arts, Albuquerque\n\nLoyola Marymount University, Los Angeles\n\nTouring from June 2020 to December 2020\n\nCurated by Arden Sherman\n\nInitially presented at the East Harlem Hunter College from Nov 2018 to March 2019, the touring show Dust Specks on the Sea focuses on sculptural works by over twenty contemporary artists from Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, and Haiti and addresses the various postcolonial conditions of the Caribbean region. The exhibition’s title—Dust Specks on the Sea—is derived from a 1964 quote by former French President Charles de Gaulle, in which he expressed his outlook on the French Caribbean islands while on an airplane. His statement speaks to the otherworldly, mysterious quality of an aerial view of the Caribbean archipelago, while also calling into question a deep-seated hierarchical perspective that stems from France’s history as a powerful colonizing force in the Caribbean. In 1902, the eruption of the volcano Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique destroyed the town of Saint-Pierre, killing approximately 30,000 people in a matter of minutes. Poignant photographic images of the “worst volcanic disaster of the early 20th century” show the volcano’s dusty smoke looming above the sparkling waters of the Caribbean; these visual documents allude to the complex and loaded sentiments of de Gaulle’s quote—the duality of perspective. The French Caribbean can neither be defined solely by its beauty nor its historical trauma. This exhibition aims to contribute to a contemporary, multi-layered understanding of this region. The title is used as a tool to challenge the perception that this region and its artwork are mere specks of dust on the world stage. The landscape of Dust Specks on the Sea transcends “Caribbean” categorization and showcases artists’ subjectivities as complex and rich, expanding beyond preconceived ideas of what art from this region looks like and what subjects it can address.\n\nPresented in spring 2020 in Miami at the Little Haiti Cultural Complex’s gallery in the neighborhood of Little Haiti, a town known for welcoming many Caribbean immigrants and historically acting as a home to displaced peoples, the show will tour in New Mexico and California in 2020 in galleries linked to universities.\n\nCuratorial Fellowships\n\nCollecting Digital Art: Institutional Precursors in France at the Turn of the Millennium, a Case Study\n\nSelby Nimrod\n\nAssistant Curator\n\nMIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge\n\nWhat does it mean to preserve and present so-called “born digital” artworks, like Net.Art? What are the existing institutional models for access? How is the digital institutionalized? And how do the epistemic and “material” premises of digital artworks rub up against the structures and ideological formations (both implicit and explicit) of the “public collection”? What insight can the close study and interpretation of thematic and conceptual underpinnings and the analysis of the specific medium of Net.Art works reveal about these questions? How might the obsolescence and narrative open-endedness that are posed by the web browser as a medium support the production of clandestine knowledge and alternative epistemologies, particularly in relation to feminist applications of technology?\n\nThese are the preliminary inquiries that will guide the research that would be undertaken during the summer and fall of 2020 in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of France, by consulting the remarkable collection of Espace Multimédia Gantner, both a living public collection and an archival repository of digital art.\n\nFrac Bretagne – Art Norac Award\n\nMackenzie Stevens\n\nDirector\n\nVisual Arts Center, University of Texas, Austin\n\nThe purpose of this research trip is twofold: 1) to work with Frac Bretagne in support of the Art Norac award and develop awareness about the VAC’s residency program in France; 2) to meet with artists and colleagues and visit institutions and residencies in Rennes, Paris, and Marseille.\n\nThe FRAC Bretagne – Art Norac Award is a new undertaking created by the FRAC director, Etienne Bernard, in partnership with MacKenzie Stevens. The prize will be presented to an artist living and working in the Brittany region of France. Shortlisted artists will display their work at the FRAC Bretagne from fall 2020 through the winter, and the winner will have a solo exhibition of his/her work at the Visual Arts Center (VAC) at UT Austin in spring 2021. The exhibition will be accompanied by an illustrated exhibition brochure with an essay co-authored by Etienne Bernard and MacKenzie Stevens. The artist will also present his/her work in a public program, in the form of an artist talk, a seminar with students, and/or another type of program that is relevant to his/her practice and the work on view at the Visual Arts Center. The project will be an incredible professionalization opportunity for a French artist, allowing him/her to exhibit work at the flagship campus of the University of Texas, and it will offer students, faculty, and staff at UT Austin an opportunity to engage with the broader contemporary art world.\n\nThe Visual Arts Center is the first institution to collaborate with FRAC Bretagne in the United States. This groundbreaking initiative marks an important beginning for further exchange, dialogues, and partnerships between the Visual Arts Center and peer institutions within France, including FRAC Bretagne. UT Austin has a vibrant and rich community of American and international faculty members and students who will benefit from the presence of international artists on campus. The FRAC Bretagne – Art Norac prize winner will be embedded within the campus’ community: She/he will engage with students and faculty during the installation and afterward through the accompanying public programs and will liaise with other curators and artistic professionals residing in greater Austin. UT Austin is home to the France-UT Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies, recognized as one of fourteen interdisciplinary centers at American universities. The VAC will partner with the institute to design programming and opportunities for UT students, faculty, and staff, as well as residents of greater Austin, to engage with the artist and his/her exhibited work.\n\nIn addition to working closely with colleagues at FRAC Bretagne on the prize and planning for the exhibition of the Art Norac awardee at the Visual Arts Center, Stevens McKenzie will explore further possibilities for French/American partnerships and will learn more about residency programs for French artists during her research trip. The VAC has a robust exhibition and residency but still wishes to expand these programs to include more international artists. Thus, visits to peer institutions and meetings with colleagues in other countries are of fundamental importance.\n\nThe Politics of Freedom: Claude Cahun and Bouchra Khalili\n\nDean Daderko\n\nCurator\n\nThis research project pursues ongoing investigation into the archives of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore’s artwork and ephemera in Nantes, France and the Isle of Jersey and includes an interview the Moroccan-French visual artist Bouchra Khalili in Paris. This work will help Dean Daderko collect material for his exhibition Traces: Art, Politics, and Resistance.\n\nThe exhibition considers how artists working across a variety of periods and places have responded to the sociopolitical interests and concerns of their times. From Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore’s brave and valiant anti-fascist efforts undertaken on the Isle of Jersey in the 1940s to Artur Barrio’s criticism of the Fifth Brazilian Republic’s brutal dictatorship, this exhibition will look at how artists across the world have responded to repressive regimes with inventive wit and a subversive spirit. Traces will consider the recent past via Gregg Bordowitz’s art and activism in New York in the face of the 1980s AIDS epidemic. Turning towards the present, it will consider videos and photographic work by Bouchra Khalili that give form to narratives of individuals’ displacement across Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.\n\nResearch on Michele Magema\n\nMary Magsamen\n\nCurator\n\nAurora Picture Show, Houston\n\nThe FACE Curatorial Fellowship will support Mary Magsamen as she researches and develops a project with the French-Congolese artist Michèle Magema and conducts general film scouting and research at the Light Cone film center and Clermont Film Festival, both based in France.\n\nMagema’s work is complimentary to Magsamen’s research on women who use film and video to share personal stories, placing themselves in vulnerable positions. With the help of the grant, Magsamen will travel to Magema’s studio to learn more about her work. She will also conduct an interview with the artist that will be published and included in the screening as a handout for attendees.\n\nVisiting Light Cone’s Documentation Center will give Magsamen an opportunity to explore its archive and learn about contemporary French and European filmmakers, just as the Clermont Film Festival will give her access to works she would not otherwise be able to see or consider for programming at Aurora Picture Show.\n\nEtant donnés Residencies\n\nThe Targets\n\nSimon Ripoll-Hurier\n\nIn partnership with Kadist, San Francisco\n\nSummer 2020\n\nA project in collaboration with artist Myriam Lefkowitz.\n\nThe purpose of Simon Ripoll-Hurier’s residency is to film the movie Targets, which takes place entirely in the San Francisco Bay Area. It will be constructed by and around remote viewing, exploring the poetic and cinematographic potential of this practice, while telling the story of a group of amateur remote viewers who got together after the declassification of the CIA archives at the turn of the century.\n\nIn the heart of the Silicon Valley in the 1970s, under the aegis of the CIA, a group of scientists, members of the military, and psychics developed a parapsychological technique that helps people channel their “extrasensory perceptions” to produce descriptions of distant targets — remote viewing.\n\nAlone in a closed room and equipped with paper and a pen, the viewer follows a protocol to organize his mental images, sensations, and impressions. He focuses on a target that has been chosen for him but of which he is not aware. Blindly, he adds up descriptors, bits of text, adjectives, and diagrams, gradually building up an image that is then compared to the chosen target.\n\nThese experiments were carried out at SRI International, an emblematic institution that was the birthplace of Arpanet, the mouse, the graphic environment, Siri, and more. If the Silicon Valley is the place that shaped the fantasy of the cloud, through which all information is available everywhere, all the time, then remote viewing is an element of the historical and theoretical background that created these new superpowers.\n\nBuilt around this underground connection, The Targets hopes to exploit a weird remnant of the Cold War to question today’s technological superpowers.\n\nIn other words: What would happen if people used these occult CIA experiments to spy on their hidden heirs and to try to look through the “iron curtain” of the Silicon Valley?\n\nCorporeal Commons\n\nJean-Charles de Quillacq\n\nIn partnership with the Coalesce Center for Biological Art, University at Buffalo, and the Bemis Art Center, Omaha\n\nOctober 10 to December 10, 2020 and February 01 to March 31, 2021\n\nThanks to this two-part residency, Jean-Charles de Quillacq will develop his thoughts on corporeal substances and secretions, especially sweat. Happening at a pivotal moment in his artistic trajectory, the residency is an opportunity to imagine surprising new perspectives, to deepen an essential part of his research, and to dare to take a truly transformational, unexpected sidestep.\n\nThe second stage of the research will take place in early 2021, at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in Omaha, during a two-month residency consisting of experimentation with various sculpting materials, techniques, and protocols and tests of various installation strategies.\n\nWhile De Quillacq is interested in all corporeal substances and secretions, he is particularly interested in perspiration because it is concentrated in the body’s most permeable zones, while being secreted within the skin of almost the entire body of all humans, regardless of sex. It is common to all genders, to all identities. It is also the visible manifestation of our reactions to both internal and external factors, highlighting the porosity of our bodies and presenting them as filters, penetrated in two directions. The image of a filter led him to a form akin to those he has been producing for a long time, almost mechanically: Using the simple and repetitive gestures of tubes or organs that constitute conduits, like real pipelines, of fluids of an uncertain nature. Self As Tube: “Human beings are tubes. From a strictly physical point of view, we are dark, humid, coiled tubes with openings at the ends.” Fever, internal injuries, infections, intense emotions or stress, the confined atmosphere of the subway and heatwaves trigger the same processes and reactions in all of our bodies. With global warming, these shared processes and reactions take on an imminently collective, even generalized dimension. Sweating thermoregulates our bodies, lowering their temperature through humidification. Perspiration plays the same role as the cremaster muscle when it relaxes, allowing the testicles to lower and cool down to ensure the production of sperm. Matthew Barney titled his films, The Cremaster Cycle, after this muscle. Some sweat-producing glands—those under the armpits, around the anus and nipples, for example—are activated at the onset of puberty by the hormonal system. They are therefore part of our sexual attributes. It has been said that deep human attraction is often triggered by our scents. Thus, bacteria is intimately linked to our sexuality because it gives perspiration its scent, our smell. A human and non-human aroma since our bodies contain many more bacterial cells than human ones. Sweat is mainly made up of water and salt but also contains plasma, lactic acid, urine, toxins—including lead and mercury—and plastic. These elements bring De Quillacq back to the material of his work, the evocation of toxicological poems that de-hierarchize realms and genres. He believes that the phenomenon of perspiration and the substances of sweat manifest themselves to our senses and consciousness in many places today, both physically and psychologically. Sweating, as one of the signs of our times, is to become the subject of his study: he will explore its realities, processes, and materials during his residency in two phases.\n\nAt the Coalesce Center for Biological Art in Buffalo, New York: Focusing on different dimensions of sweat (chemical, physiological, and legal), he will work to develop and fabricate artificial liquids that synthesize his own perspiration, growing bacteria associated with certain odors and/or designing fermentation systems for these bacteria. One of the objectives of his first research phase is to find a way to develop and maintain synthetic sweat, a perfume or watery liquid, and to test its interactions with different materials under variable conditions. By extension, he will also research the deodorant industry and the substances and materials developed to manage sweat, as well as breathable fabric and textiles technologically designed to keep the body dry and odorless.\n\nAt the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in Omaha, Nebraska: This two-month residency will give De Quillacq the opportunity to experiment with various sculpting materials, techniques, and protocols and to test out various installation strategies.\n\nThe Legal Loopholes Society\n\nEva Barto\n\nIn partnership with the SculptureCenter, NYC\n\n30 April – 30 June 2021\n\nThe Legal Loopholes Society is a research project focused on the legal hindrances standing between France and the United States of America. Since 2017, different paths involving the impact of law upon the production of artwork in France, also with regard to the American context, have been explored. From the legal hindrances and dissociations of the two nations’ contexts, The Legal Loopholes Society hopes to pursue fieldwork across the American territory to initiate the conception of a “Society”, an autonomous system that stands “in-between” French and American legal rules. The ambiguous meaning carried by the term “legal loophole”, a term which is highly neglected by attorneys, is a strategical starting point for the research. In that respect, various components that affect the functional principles of The Legal Loopholes Society are meant to be treated: its intellectual property issues, taxes and economic limitations, customs regulations, selling conditions, and philanthropist advantage. Therefore, the output of the research will be multifaceted. Although lacking human beings, the self-sufficient “Society” will gather material elements, such as series of objects conceived for that framework and projected beyond traditional contractual forms, and impose new economic conditions and copyright legislation. Works created out of this research could then be distanced from the common ways of collecting in the art market, reconsidering the greater notions of property and ownership. Hence, the outputs will not necessarily be produced for the context of an institution, the classic frame of an exhibition. Instead, their access and visibility will be questioned and they will be dedicated to the margins of the institution, its threshold, or put “in transit”, in constant transportation between two borders. Created out of legal flaws, The Legal Loopholes Society will stand outside the two legal systems (FR and US). It will be constitutive of a porous territory, implying new rules, regulations, and conditions of existence for the artworks that tackle their financial systems, their modes of appearance, and their value systems.\n\nThe base for this research comes from another context — the social conditions of artists in France, particularly the artist’s rights and claims. The artist has no status in France and is deprived of unemployment insurance. In short, the artist is not considered a worker. Faced with the lack of specific laws and governmental issues, the collective La Buse (that Barto initiated in France in 2018) works to elaborate an alternative system that proposes a special status for artistic workers and highlights the power issues of the art world. La Buse, among other collectives, initiated the movement Art in Strike, which is currently converging with the national general strike. This important social struggle is inspired by the action of the American collective WAGE (Working Artist and The Greater Economy), which Barto hopes to visit during her residency. The need to be active in formulating alternative conditions and working towards new laws and rights for artistic workers is certainly The Legal Loopholes Society’s point of departure for this research.\n\nField experience and theoretical research will feed the overall process of The Legal Loopholes Society. In order to build a solid working base, in addition to active library research, a lawyer specializing in intellectual property will support the two month residency. The fieldwork for this research will consist of visiting legal institutions and offices, including the Services of American Customs and areas that claim their own regulations, such as a series of Tax-Free Zones in New York. These spaces are areas where emblematical elements (aesthetics of control, languages of power, judicial terminologies, etc.), can be recorded, used and distorted to help jumpstart the project. Finally, since Barto’s practice always emerges from the study of a specific context, SculptureCenter will provide a strong framework to analyze and imagine the diverse forms that the American system can potentially take. There will be various interviews with the board of the institution, studies of the history of the building and a review of its fundraising strategies.\n\nFour Corners\n\nThéodora Barat\n\nIn partnership with Mayeur Projects, Las Vegas, NM\n\nSeptember – November, 2021\n\nFour Corners is a project consisting of photographs, video and installations that tackles the impact of research into atomic energy on the Four Corners area (formed by Utah, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico) and how the Second World War and the Cold War contributed to the growth of the nuclear industry and its militaristic and scientific expansion.\n\nThis project is in a sense a corollary to Learning from New Jersey, in which the geographic area was examined as the proving ground for modernity. This earlier project opened up a documentary approach in Barat’s work that she is now keen to apply as a creative methodology. Four Corners takes an account told during the filming of Pay-Less Monument (the film element of Learning from New Jersey) as its starting point. An army veteran of the U.S.A. evoked a nuclear accident that occurred on a military base in New Jersey. The resulting contaminated soil was stored in an abandoned salt mine in Utah. Barat immediately wanted to know more about this accident. Considering New Jersey a ground of modernity, she wondered if Utah could be its dumping ground. Then, she did some research on the nuclear presence in Utah and realized that this “dumping zone” extended into the three other states of the Four Corners area. Although heavily contaminated, New Mexico presents a historic site connected to the Manhattan program, a nuclear weapons project that began during the Second World War. On the other hand, Utah, Colorado and Arizona seem to bear only the collateral damage. The sequence of events she has uncovered so far seems to offer a particularly promising path.\n\nTravelling to the area will allow Barat to check her theories and to give the project a tangible form. This two month residency with the Mayeur Projects in Las Vegas (New Mexico) will offer her an environment that is exceptionally well-suited to the pursuit of her research. The gallery will then host the end of residency exhibition. Four Corners will also be included in EXTRACTION: Art on the Edge of the Abyss, a program launched by Edwin Dobb and Peter Rutledge Koch that examines artistic responses to the Anthropocene. This ongoing series of works began in 2018 and will be completed in the summer of 2021. During the intervening period, she will submit several articles reflecting the different stages of her project and hold a screening of her film Pay-Less Monument. Lastly, the residency and grant will allow her to complete the preliminary work required for a documentary film that is adjacent to the projects’ photographs, videos, and installations. The whole project is part of the practice-based PhD that she started this year with the RADIAN doctoral program.\n\n2019\n\nGrants to Artistic Projects\n\nConfinement\n\nFRANCK APERTET, ANNIE VIGIER, TILL ROESKENS, JEAN-MICHEL PANCIN, MYRIAM MIHINDOU, NICOLAS DAUBANES, MATHIEU PERNOT, CATHERINE PONCIN.\n\nGroup Show\n\nContemporary Arts Center Cincinnati\n\nNovember 22, 2019 – February 29, 2020\n\nCurated by Valentine Umansky\n\nConfinement is a direct response to Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days (1961), which sees a woman buried up to her neck in the sand. Under the blazing sun, Winnie is anchored in a mound, her belongings gathered in a black bag, which she treasures just as much as she does the daily routine of taking her belongings in and out of the pouch. A tribute to Winnie, this group exhibition highlights the ambiguities of a notion that evokes both the protection of the cocoon and the constriction of the enclosed space. The exhibition, which includes eight French artists, is divided into three sections spiraling around a central, core installation. Its four parts are: The core piece: Géographie. Uterpan. – Precedents – Seeking shelter. Which bodies/which refuge? – Institutional constriction systems. On the (im)possibility of mapping out confinement.\n\nThe New Inflation\n\nLIV SCHULMAN\n\nSolo Show\n\nBemis Center for Contemporary Art\n\nOmaha, NE\n\nOctober 2019 – June 2020\n\nCurated by Sylvie Fortin\n\nThe New Inflation is a performance in four episodes that combines several layers of narrative systems: through the use of a group of actors, staged sculptures, lecturing, a funny/depressing form of stand-up comedy, and other unimaginable ways, Schulman will try to dress the portrait of a disenchanted economy – one in which singularity is explored as a refugee of the universe – based on the principle of error. Using the idea of crisis as a resource, she follows the very well-known phenomenon of devaluation to explore a mythology: Inflation. She includes aspects of inflation that create new forms of relationships, new interior designs, new wallpapers, new relations to language, and new fantasies, but focuses mainly on inflation as a link between one and the universe. In a frantic form of storytelling, the narrative relies on global mistakes as a form of positivity, forming a system of thought based on the idea of error as opportunity, and allowing signifiers to slide into one another via similitude. Here, a mass of stories converge towards a possible reading of a form of economy that is as global as personal. The universe, and its expansion become a new name to singularity. Liv Schulman received the Prix Ricard Prize in 2018.\n\nTree Identification for Beginner\n\nYTO BARRADA\n\nSolo Show\n\nThe CAC – Contemporary Art Center\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nMarch 7, 2020 – June 4, 2020\n\nCurated by : Andrea Andersson\n\nTree Identification for Beginners is an exhibition of film, sculpture, installation and performance. The film interweaves political and personal history and myth; a construction from archival materials, journals and textiles, it begins with a narration of Barrada’s mother’s participation in 1966 during a US-sponsored trip to the United States for “Young African Leaders”. The film and installation –comprised of textile, image and sculpture- appropriate structures and methodologies from ethnography, natural history and archaeology as well as educational theory, to examine both the systems and mythologies employed to identify and categorize people and objects. With her installation, Barrada will bring her attention and curiosity to the specific history of New Orleans, and its relationship to both France and North Africa. The exhibition will include a night of performance, in which the artist will provide a live soundtrack to her film, using found materials.\n\nTangier Requiem\n\nYTO BARRADA\n\nSolo Show\n\nLower Manhattan Cultural Council @ Governors Island art center\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSeptember 11 – October 31, 2019\n\nCurated by Omar Berrada\n\nLoosely structured around several abstract motifs that are anchored in specific historic moments, this exhibit will consider the military history of Governors Island, the colonial history of Tanger, Morocco, and the environmental predicament of Tangier, VA in the context of a playful investigation of how humans have dealt, and are dealing, with the possible end of the world. Curated by Omar Berrada, the installation will consist of a heterogeneous and poetic assemblages of sculptures, objects, and moving images. Aesthetic points of reference include native arrowheads, the craft of woodcarving, and the many geometric forms of crab traps. Hand-dyed linen shades will create atmospheric interactions of color and light, interplaying with the 17 light-filled windows that line the gallery space.\n\nWaiting for Omar Gatlato\n\nMASSINISSA SELMANI, KARIM GHELLOUSTI, DJAMEL TATAH, FAYCAL BAGHRICHE, YAZID OULAB, HAKIMA EL DJOUDI, SARA SADIK, HALIDA BOUGHRIET, DANIA REYMOND, LOUISA BARBARI.\n\nGroup Show\n\nThe Wallach Art Gallery\n\nNew York, NY\n\nOctober 26, 2019 – March 15, 2020\n\nCurated by Natasha Marie Llorens\n\nFollowing the curators’ previous Etant donnés curatorial fellowship in France and Algeria, Waiting for Omar Gatlato is conceived as a broad survey of both established Algerian artists and those from the generation now coming of age in a post-civil war Algeria and in its diaspora. Waiting for Omar Gatlato is –first- the title of a book published in 1979 by the Algerian lawyer, feminist, and film critic Wassyla Tamzali. Waiting for Omar Gatlato responds directly to the specificity of Algeria’s socio-historical context by bringing visibility to artists living and working in France and Algeria. The project’s methodology works against the country’s conflation with its more affluent neighbors, namely Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the Gulf, and against its marginalization by the international art world more broadly. The exhibition also responds to an aporia with regard to Algeria and its French diaspora specific to New York’s art world and academic departmental categories, which has a tendency to see North Africa together with the Middle East.\n\nFrederik Douglas: A Narrative of Liberation\n\nRAPHAEL BARONTINI\n\nCommission for a solo project\n\nSavannah College of Art and Design (SCAD)\n\nSavannah, GA\n\nOctober 2019 – February 2020\n\nCurated by: Storme Janse van Rensburg\n\nAfter visiting Savannah, Georgia to research the site – as well as the collections of the museum and the African-American art and artifact collection of Dr. Walter O.Evans – the artist will develop a proposal for a site and theme-specific project. SCAD museum of Art annually commissions new works that consider and respond, among other things, to place and history –of our building, the city of Savannah, the South, and the United States- from nuanced local and international perspectives. Barontini’s practice consists largerly of layered textile-based installations with richly embellished surfaces, including new images constructed by the artist from existing sources. He draws from colonial and African art historical references, which he transforms through a process of collage to create new visual vocabularies. Installations also reference and present flags and objects associated with pageantry, ship sails and tent-like enclosures. Barontini also considers sound and performance to be integral to this commission. He will create a series of flags and epaulettes to accompany a local high school marching band which will perform at the exhibition’s opening night.\n\nAS DEEP AS I COULD REMEMBER,\n\nAS FAR AS I COULD SEE.\n\nTARIK KISWANSON\n\nSolo show – Performance\n\nPerforma\n\nNew York, NY\n\nNovember 20 – November 24, 2019\n\nCurated by Charles Aubin\n\nCo-commissioned by Performa and Lafayette Anticipations in Paris, and based on his book of the same title, AS DEEP AS I COULD REMEMBER, AS FAR AS I COULD SEE is Tarik Kiswanson’s most ambitious work to date. Conceived of as a large-scale installation and performance, for its premiere in Paris in May 2018, Kiswanson cast a cohort of eleven-year old children to perform poetical texts combining fragments of childhood sensations and adult reflections that contemplate the turbulent world in which we live. For Performa 19, Kiswanson will expand the work into a new iteration produced specifically for New York. The work will bring together a group of 11 young NYC residents of various backgrounds and origins. Presented at a moment of great uncertainty and instability for immigrants, especially for those of Arab descent, the cosmopolitan thinking and pluralist values in the work aim to foster greater understanding and intercultural dialogue among participants and audiences alike.\n\nHuguette Caland: Tête-à-tête\n\nHUGUETTE CALAND\n\nSolo Show\n\nThe Drawing Center\n\nNew York, NY\n\nMay 22, 2020 – September 13, 2020\n\nCurated by Claire Gilman\n\nEmbracing the instrinsic sexuality of the human body in her early canvases, Caland briefly came to international prominence in the 1970’s; yet, it is the explicit manner in which she expresses sensuality through drawing that has precipitated her recent resurfacing. Caland’s pencil and color pencil drawings from the 1970’s and 1980’s, for instance, at first appear empty or abstract, but closer observation of the artist’s decisively drawn lines reveals tender images of caressing lovers and whimsical portraits of smiling women. Often, Caland uses a single line to convey a body part or intimate gesture, and incorporates the white of the page as an integral part of the drawing process. Extending her drawing practice to fashion in the early 1970’s, Caland created a series of one hundred kaftans and embroidered many of these with schematic images of breasts and female genitalia. The tension between the nakedness of the human body and the fabrics that conceal It once again became a central theme in Caland’s drawing practice beginning in the early 1990’s, both in the artist’s delicately cross-hatched ink drawings that resemble woven textiles and in her series of nude mannequins that are embellished with these same designs.\n\nPassages, a symposium, film, screenings, performances and talks.\n\nLILI REYNAUD DEWAR, VALERIE CHARTRAIN, DOROTHEE DUPUIS, CAROLINE MESQUITA, MARIE ANGELETTI, EMILIE PITOISET\n\nSymposium\n\nThe Third Rail\n\nMinneapolis, MN\n\nSeptember 28 & 29,2019.\n\nCurated by Sandra Teitge / Petunia\n\nThis project includes a weekend symposium of performances, screenings, readings and discussions over the last weekend of September 2019 at company projects/The Third Rail in Minneapolis and in various locations in downtown Minneapolis, including the city’s iconic skyway system, in which the Goethe Pop Up is situated.\n\n“Language”: The Manuscripts of Pierre Guyotat\n\nPIERRE GUYOTAT\n\nSolo show\n\nArtists Space\n\nNew York, NY\n\nMarch 2020 – May 2020\n\nCurated by Jamie Stevens\n\nPierre Guyotat’s project is one of the acute dissolution of language. Railing against conventional form, he has created a style that is both fragmented and syntactically complex. Guyotat’s writing is imbued with questions of sexuality and violence, and challenges normative bourgeois notions of morality through a provocative representation of libidinal desire. This exhibition will showcase archival materials, texts, and visual works produced by Guyotat over the course his lifetime, providing a broad and multifaceted examination of his important legacy.\n\nCuratorial Fellowships\n\nDAVID FAMILIAN\n\nArtistic director, curator.\n\nBeall Center for Art + Technology\n\nIrvine, CA\n\nProject title: Research on the work of Vera Molnar for an exhibition at the Beall Center for Art + Technology, UC Irvine.\n\nThe purpose of this trip will be focus on the breadth of Vera Molnar’s artistic practice in preparation for a comprehensive survey exhibition at the Beall Center for Art+Technology. David Familian’s interest in Molnar’s work derives from his initial research into computational art and music from 1950-1970’s that investigated both the aesthetic aspects of the work but also the computational techniques to create this art.\n\nDENISE MARKONISH\n\nSenior curator, managing director of exhibitions\n\nThe Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Arts (MoCA)\n\nNorth Adams, MA\n\nProject title: Laurent Grasso Research\n\nThe purpose of this trip is to prepare for Laurent Grasso’s new exhibition at the Mass MOCA.\n\nMerging of the miraculous and the scientific is emblematic of Laurent Grasso’s work, which bends time, space and the immensity of the universe to create a vertiginous sense of history. In his series Studies into the Past, Grasso creates seemingly historic paintings, with the help of conservators, that transport us to the time of Flemish and Italian painters of the 15th and 16th centuries – Brueghel, Piero Della Francesca, Fra Angelico, Boticelli. Grasso confounds the narrative here- a man on horseback looks skyward, but rather than the sun or other predictably celestial phenomenon, hovering above him is a large spiked ball. Grasso suggests that there can be parallel realities and that we still feel the ghosts of history.\n\nEtant donnés Residencies\n\nThe Black Mountain\n\nSYLVAIN COUZINET JACQUES\n\nResidency in collaboration with The Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center. Asheville, NC\n\nThe artists will explore the history and specificity of the Black Mountain College and the elasticity of time through images of its past and utopian desires. The Black Mountain is a video project set on the historic place of the Black Mountain College in North Carolina, USA. The video will be based on stories, happenings and events which happened during the period of its activities (1933-1957). Reenacting moments fixed on photographs during its years of activity and designed as a tribute, the film will be looking for visual expression and freedom, frozen in time. Crossing boundaries between performance, documentary approaches and free form, the project is a collaboration with the BMC Art Museum in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nThe story of Black Mountain College begins in 1933. It is a fascinating chapter in the history of education and the arts. Conceived by John A. Rice, Black Mountain College was born out of a desire to create a new type of college based on John Dewey’s principles of progressive education.. It was owned and operated by the faculty and was committed to democratic governance and to the idea that the arts are central to the experience of learning. Twenty minutes east of Asheville in North Carolina, the secluded environment fostered a strong sense of individuality and creative intensity. Life in community, self-management and the desire to be part of a rural reality partly define the project as it is conceived in its early days during the economic crisis. Legendary even in its own time, Black Mountain College attracted and created maverick spirits, some of whom went on to become well-known and extremely influential individuals in the latter half of the 20th century. BMC has been the major laboratory of the most recent initiatives in the United States, on the artistic, educational and political fronts, and the center of a true revolution of minds. . Materials such as the photographic archives, the BMC Review, letters of correspondence or anecdotes reported a posteriori by the authors or students, are the subject of the project The Black Mountain. More than a reference in history of art, the BMC contains the philosophy of community and experimental daily life colored by prospective ideas which is also part of my Eden project. The artist will explore the elasticity of time through images of its past and utopian desires.\n\n“There (in Back Mountain College), I would recreate “historical” moments, living sculptures which would be filmed and represented like tributes and ghostly appearances of our contemporary time mixed together”.\n\nThis Residency is made possible with the support of the Institut Français – Paris\n\nSwallowing Surfaces; If They Swell\n\nLAURE VIGNA\n\nResidency in collaboration with Yucca Valley Material Lab and FLAX LA\n\nYucca Valley, CA\n\nLaure Vigna is a sculptor. Taking an interest on the history of materials, their interrelation and their modification through time and human’s work, Laure Vigna will train and experiment the technique of fused glass. Laure Vigna builds narratives in which matter is a subject. Glass holds a special place in this set and body of work, from its materiality, being invisible and transparent, and its malleability.\n\nDuring this residency that will unfold in two phases, the artists will explore the myths of body transformation, and existing (or potential) relationships between the living and the non-living, which can be applied to the principles of metamorphosis that are implemented in her sculptural work.\n\nWithin the work time at YVML and FLAX, the Mojave Desert and the practice of glass will be a full-fledged context for studying myths of transformation through the representation of bodies in Native American and contemporary legends related to the territory of South California. The desert, at first an empty space in constant motion, is simultaneously a surface charged with a single, tiny and dispersed material penetrating everything: dust (sand, earth) forming a thick crust serving as a backdrop on which are woven mythologies and vernacular beliefs.\n\nThe Mojave Desert is a land particularly rich in stories. It was originally occupied by several nations tribes that have almost all disappeared: Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi and Mojave; all oh which are intimately related to the region of Joshua Tree National Park by the abundance of its natural resources. In the nineteenth century, the Mojave Desert became a mining and oil exploitation territory and it natural ecology became endangered. At the same time, remoteness and isolation made it an ideal area for military and aeronautical tests, with fantasies of space conquest and interstellar travels towards new dimensions and other non-human worlds. But the desert is also a place of contemplation and meditation where the physical vastness has attracted as many utopian colonies, ufologists, artists and other people retreating from the world for mystical exoduses in spiritual quests; Consequently loading this territory of urban legends closely connected to its geography (as the telluric energies vortices) or experimental practices, as in architecture (organic, googie, etc.).\n\nHow did the ancestral myths anchor a territory and nourish contemporary narratives? How have these diverse communities evolved, coexisted and reinvented themselves in this environment?\n\nThe metamorphosis, space shifting or skin-walkers in Native American culture, illustrates the world inhabited by various species of human or non-human subjects thinking and living in the same continuity, and not in a nature – culture opposition as it is the case in our Western society.\n\nThis Residency is made possible with the support of the Institut Français – Paris\n\nThe Science of Cities Brooklyn/Maputo\n\nTEO BETIN\n\nResidency at Residency Unlimited\n\nNew York, NY\n\nTeo Bétin is a sculptor. Though this project, he will explore the special relationship between Maputo in Mozambique and Brooklyn: A history of colonization, waves of migration, that of identities to reinvent. Mostly using fragments of furniture and objects that he collects on the streets and in people’s homes, he builds new spaces. He also photographs buildings that he integrates into his assemblies. He also will paint and then burn his buildings. His sculptures are a way to question how spaces and their architectures influence the behavior of city dwellers and vice versa. They are also a way to question how people transform cities and their buildings and divert their uses – Where are the «temples» and what are the rituals?\n\nHe will also organize a symposium within one of his sculptures to host a think-tank on spaces of the city and the possibility of a future already present, with Professor Mamadou Diouf (from Columbia University) and Senegalese artist Cheikh Ndiaye (based in New York) who have worked together on African cities. This sculpture will be a place to welcome rituals, individualities and their memories.\n\n“I saw an image of Paul Auster’s book Sunset Park – in which, the story of these young people back in New York, who find themselves in a squat in Brooklyn, during the financial crisis of 2008 – leads me to the ruin down the building I used to live in Mozambique, a former store half destroyed in a fire, occupied by a group of young men who came from the province to work. I found the painting Untitled-Car crash of Basquiat, related to his car accident in front of his family’s home in Brooklyn. This strange relationship between the car and the anatomy came with this wave of suicide in Maputo: young people are killing themselves by swallowing large quantities of car battery fluid. A mixture of sulphuric acid and demineralized water. Which relationship could you have with your car to imagine killing yourself with the element that is precisely essential for starting it? What relation to Transhumanism to think of death in such a technical, chemical way?”\n\nThis Residency is made possible with the support of the Institut Français – Paris\n\nMorphings\n\nSERGIO VERASTEGUI\n\nResidency at Praz Delavallade Los Angeles Gallery\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nSergio Verastegui is a sculptor. His project is aimed at preparing a new series of sculptures, one of which will be exhibited at the show “The Sound of Silence’ taking place in at Praz-Delavallade Los Angeles gallery, then at the project space Solo Show at Unit 5 Space.\n\nThe artist will focus on the imaginary of the city in relation to cinema and Hollywood, which marks the unconscious of its inhabitants. He looks forward to finding the ghostly presence of spectacle and the ideology behind it.\n\nThe new pieces will also focus on the poetical relation between materials and objects, in order to create out of these fragmented narrative. The notion of “morphing” will be used as a modus operandi. Morphing is a special effect in motion pictures and animations that changes (or morphs) one image or shape into another through a seamless transition. Morphing is often used as part of a fantasy or surreal sequence.\n\n“The idea of morphing could be extensive to any image, but usually is very used on human faces (celebrity’s faces for instance). Morphing is also linked to the notion of “face recognition” which is related to neuro-cognitive research. There is a neurological problem that happens when somebody’s facial recognition brain zone is damaged. This trouble is called “Prosopagnosia”, and people who suffer from it cannot recognize any faces, including their own.”\n\nHe will explore his idea of “morphing” with a bigger set of pieces that will amplify the initial ideas, causing collisions between faces, objects, volume and space.\n\nThese pieces will result in sculptures and videos.\n\nThis Residency is made possible with the support of the CPGA – Comité Professionnel des Galeries d’Art.\n\n2018 /\n\nGRANTS TO ARTISTIC PROJECTS\n\nTATIANA TROUVE\n\nSOLO EXHIBITION\n\nEli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University\n\nEast Lansing, MI\n\nProject title: Tatiana Trouvé\n\nApril 27 – October 27, 2019\n\nCurated by Marc-Olivier Wahler and Carla Acevedo-Yates\n\nThe Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University (MSU Broad) will present the first-ever major exhibition of the work of Tatiana Trouvé in the United States, from April 27 to October 27, 2019. This project is designed to survey recent works that has been created over the past decade and will recontextualize several important bodies of work from the artist’s career, including drawings, sculptures and installations, in order to highlight the different facets of her practice dealing with architecture, notion of time and space, and systems of categorization and perception. While Trouvé, a previous Prix Marcel Duchamp winner in 2007, has participated in gallery exhibitions in the US, she has yet to have a major museum exhibition, or significant institutional exposure. The exhibition will be accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue.\n\nCYPRIEN GAILLARD\n\nSOLO EXHIBITION\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art – MOCA Cleveland, for the FRONT Triennial\n\nCleveland, OH\n\nProject title: Nightlife\n\nJuly 14 – September 30, 2018\n\nCurated by Michelle Grabner in collaboration with Andria Hickey (MOCA)\n\nAs part of Cleveland’s new Triennial for Contemporary Art, MOCA Cleveland will present a major work by Cyprien Gaillard from July 14 to September 30, 2018: Nightlife (2015) is a cinema-scaled 3D film installation immersing viewers in a surreal experience that weaves together narratives, individuals, movements, violence, and place. Nightlife, which was shot at night over two years in Cleveland, Berlin, and Los Angeles, transforms both film and sound into sculptural forms. MOCA’s collaboration with Gaillard marks the first time that this French artist will be shown in the region, and is significant considering the representation of Cleveland in Gaillard’s work.\n\nCyprien Gaillard was born in Paris in 1980, and currently lives in Berlin and New York, where his broader artistic project centers on an exploration of the built environment. His work reflects upon meanings and memories of monuments and landscapes that have been erased and replaced by the effects of time and social and cultural transformation. Gaillard’s practice spans many media – including photography, installation, etching, painting, sculpture, performance, and public interventions – and is almost always made outside the walls of a studio. Cyprien Gaillard was awarded the Prix Marcel Duchamp in 2011 and this work was presented for the Lyon Biennale in 2015.\n\nKAPWANI KIWANGA\n\nSOLO EXHIBITION\n\nMIT List Visual Arts Center\n\nCambridge, MA\n\nProject title: Kapwani Kiwanga\n\nFebruary 7- April 14, 2019\n\nCurated by Yuri Stone\n\nThe MIT List Visual Arts Center will present a solo exhibition of Kapwani Kiwanga (born in 1978, Hamilton, Ontario) in the Spring of 2019. Kapwani is a Paris-based artist who traces historical narratives, excavating and considering the global impact of colonialism and how it permeates contemporary culture. Her work is research-driven, instigated by marginalized or forgotten histories, and articulated across a range of materials and mediums including sculpture, installation, photography, video, and performance. For her presentation at the List Center, she will continue her exploration of architectural histories and their physical and psychological influence: her new work will respond to MIT’s architectural histories and “desired paths”: footpaths of individuals throughout public spaces in Cambridge and Boston in the particular context of the colonial history of Boston. The show will be accompanied by a robust public programs series. Kapwani Kiwanga won the Frieze Artist Award in 2018.\n\nSUPPORTS / SURFACES\n\nCollective exhibition with: André-Pierre Arnal, Pierre Burgalio, Louis Cane, Daniel Dezeuze, Noël Dolla, Jean-Michel Meurice, Bernard Pagès, Jean-Pierre Pincemin, Patrick Saytour, Claude Viallat\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD)\n\nDetroit, MI\n\nProject title: Supports/Surfaces\n\nFebruary 1 – April 14, 2019\n\nCurated by Elysia Borowy-Reeder and Wallace Whitney\n\nThe MOCAD will present the first comprehensive exhibition in the Midwest of the under-known French art movement Supports/Surfaces. In the 1960’s, Supports/Surfaces was a confederation of about 13 artists mostly from the south of France (Nimes, Nice, St. Etienne, etc.) who made work marked by an interest in materiality, an expansive and fluid idea of what a painting could be and a bright lyrical use of color. There was no manifesto, but the writings of and ideas of Freud, Marx, Clement Greenberg and Chairman Mao were tossed together with a deep interest in American minimalism and Matisse, another artist associated with the south of France. This group was interested in making art without slick fabrication, organized on loose permeable grid structure: which implied a stretched canvas and often utilized repeated forms and/or patterning that seemed to offer a humane possibility for both art making and a metaphorical proposal for just society, using everyday items as art materials. The show will be completed by a large panel discussion involving these historical artists, and a site specific piece would be created on the banks of the Detroit River by Noël Dolla to spark a dialogue with the community outside the walls of the museum.\n\nULLA VON BRANDENBURG\n\nSOLO EXHIBITION\n\nContemporary Arts Center\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nProject title: Ulla von Brandenburg’s Two Times Seven\n\nMarch 14 – June 13, 2019\n\nCurated by Andrea Andersson\n\nIn Spring 2019, the Contemporary Arts Center (CAC) in New Orleans will present Two Times Seven, an exhibition by Ulla von Brandenburg, as part of the building-wise presentation, Hinge Picture, Memory Images. Hinge Picture, Memory Images is a building-wide presentation, comprised of eight individual exhibitions that collectively confront the patrimony of European modernism– with a body of work that evolves from the flat plane of the wall to immersive sculptural environments. The show takes its name from the writings of Marcel Duchamp in The Green Box, a companion piece to his masterwork La Mariée mise à nu par ses célibataires même. In the first floor gallery, Ulla von Brandenburg will produce a large installation of fourteen hanging curtains, suspended found and constructed objects, two-dimensional paintings, and the film “C,U,I,T,H,E,A,KO,G,N,B,D,F,R,MP,L” (2017): this show will literalize the structure of Duchamp’s “pendu femelle”, but in the place of suspended brides, she will hang suspended found and made objects sourced from France and New Orleans. The installation will foreground a history of patriarchy and the structures of power invested in shape, color and adornment. A full color publication, co-published by Siglio Press and CAC will be released on March 2019: this catalogue will serve as a permanent extension of the exhibition.\n\nMICHEL BLAZY\n\nSOLO EXHIBITION\n\nMoody Center for the Arts, William Marsh Rice University\n\nHouston, TX\n\nProject title: Michel Blazy at Night of Philosophy and Ideas Exhibition\n\nJanuary 25 – May 30, 2019\n\nCurated by Alison Weaver and Kimberly Davenport\n\nTogether with the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the United States, the Moody Center for the Arts at Rice University is hosting A Night of Philosophy and Ideas in January 2019. To enhance the platform for discussion, the Moody has invited the French artist Michel Blazy (b. 1966) to create an original, site-specific installation in the Moody’s central gallery. Blazy’s work has never been exhibited in the United States outside of New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Moody is honored to have the opportunity to introduce his original vision to new audiences, thereby promoting the cultural dialogue between France and the United States. The commission will remain on view until May 30, 2019.\n\nThroughout his 20 years of career, Michel Blazy has pursued ideas and questions relating to organic matter and life cycles, considering his work as a collaboration with nature and living matter. His work, characterized by a sense of whimsy was presented in the 2015 Lyon Biennale then in the 2017 Venice Biennale. During the show, university classes involving earth science, art history, anthropology and the environment will engage with his work to further their studies and the Moody will host public events that continue the conversation around art and environment.\n\nSHEILA HICKS\n\nSOLO EXHIBITION\n\nThe Bass Museum of Art\n\nMiami Beach, FL\n\nProject title: Sheila Hicks\n\nApril – September 2019\n\nCurated by Silvia Karman Cubiñá\n\nThe Bass Museum will present Sheila Hicks’s first solo exhibition in South Florida, and the most comprehensive exhibition of the artist in the United States to date.
