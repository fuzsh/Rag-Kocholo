        "text": "L.S. \"Bo\" Dean Jr.\n\nL.S. \"Bo\" Dean Jr.\n\nSenior Human Resource Analyst at New Hanover County Serving and serving with our approximately 2400 public servants.\n\nPublished Nov 30, 2015\n\n2016 thanksgiving tradition continues\n\nAnnual Thanksgiving Tradition: Year 16: 1600 things, events, feelings I am grateful for this year....\n\n16 Years ago I started a list because a lot of folks I encountered were having a hard time or shared that they did not see a lot they could be grateful for in this area.\n\nI had learned about writing gratitude lists to generate for myself the good around me and keep gratitude first in my heart and mind. So, I sent out a “gratitude” list of 100 things I was grateful for in Wilmington that year.\n\nIt was met with great success as it spurred on others to think about things they could be grateful for and draw attention to the positive and create perspective that might not always be in focus.\n\nI decided, and have kept up, that each year I would do the list but make it equivalent to the number of years I had been doing it!\n\nThis year I am at 1600, and I am so glad to be able to have this exercise.\n\nI include groups, things, organizations, service, and places.\n\nNames are only used in reference to gifts..don't go looking for your name! LOL! :)\n\nI GENERATE A NEW LIST EACH YEAR. This is stream of consciousness and I try and write it at once, over several hours. I had to do it this year over three days, so it is not as smooth, but it was a wonderful and meaningful journey.\n\nRegardless of what my circumstances might be, regardless of what events may occur in my life, it is a tradition I will continue, because, I/we am/are blessed and it is worth remembering, offering thanksgiving, and sharing with each other!\n\nI hope it will spark a list of your own and feel free to steal mine!\n\nI am grateful for:\n\n1.) My higher power, whom I know as God, who sustains, directs, and loves me.\n\n2.) For the breath of life\n\n3.) For 26 years and counting, one day at a time\n\n4.)
