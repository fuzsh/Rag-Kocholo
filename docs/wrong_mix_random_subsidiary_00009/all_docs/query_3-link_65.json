Gifts of any amount to any area of the university qualify donors for membership. Involvement in the society is sustained as long as gifts are made to IUP every fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) without interruption.\n\nDownload the complete list of Loyalty Society donors.\n\nStudent Giving at IUP is more than giving, it’s about helping ensure their one IUP experience is top-notch. Student members of the IUP Leadership Society (with a gift of $100 or more) have the opportunity to connect with other esteemed donors in the IUP Leadership Society by being invited to exclusive events.\n\nDownload the complete list of Student Donors.\n\nAlumni and friends believe IUP is a worthy investment, and they support IUP’s mission through various donations throughout the year.\n\nDownload the complete list of All Other Donors.\n\nEndowment Funds provide a gift with both immediate and long-term benefits. Endowment donations are invested. A portion of the annual income from the investment is used to address immediate needs at the Foundation for IUP. The remaining funds are reinvested to ensure indefinite support.\n\nDownload the complete list of Endowed Funds."
