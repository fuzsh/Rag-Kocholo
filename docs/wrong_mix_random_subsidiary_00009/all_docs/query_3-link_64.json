This extension builds upon the success and growth of the initiative since first launching in 2021, which has included the tripling of the Foundation’s initial $5-million commitment and the broadening of its applicant parameters to include museums, non-collecting visual arts organizations, and art schools.\n\nThe Foundation simultaneously announced it is awarding $2.7 million to 48 art organizations across the country through its third grantmaking cycle, which launched earlier this year, bringing the total funding conferred to date to more than $10.8 million.\n\nThis talk, given by Foundation Executive Director Elizabeth Smith, reflected on Frankenthaler’s six-decade career in painting and printmaking, as well as specific works on view and from the museum’s collection. The lecture happened in conjunction with the exhibition The Pillars (in Norwegian: Søylerommet) which included Frankenthaler’s 1976 painting Sentry alongside artworks by other leading women artists.\n\nThe Helen Frankenthaler Foundation announced ten new recipients of its Frankenthaler Prints Initiative, an ongoing program for university-affiliated art museums that reflects the Foundation’s commitment to supporting undergraduate and graduate education in the visual arts and art history.\n\nThe awardees include ten museums from across the U.S., each of which will receive a group of prints and five to ten related trial proofs drawn from the Foundation’s extensive collection of work by Frankenthaler. The museums also receive a one-time grant of $25,000 to develop a project or program for the study, presentation, and interpretation of the editions and proofs within a three-year timeframe.\n\nView Press Release\n\nThe third application cycle of the Frankenthaler Climate Initiative will open for submissions on February 20, 2023 accepting proposals supporting energy efficiency and clean energy projects at visual art museums and art schools throughout the United States.
