Featuring a group of new acquisitions shown for the first time and the most significant prints series by Jasper Johns, the displays coincide with the exhibition Frank Auerbach: The Charcoal Heads (open until 27 May).\n\nFrom the Baroque to Today: Recent Acquisitions of Works on Paper\n\nGilbert and Ildiko Butler Drawings Gallery\n\n23 February – 27 May 2024\n\nThis display will showcase a selection of twenty-four prints and drawings, spanning the late 17th to the early 21st centuries, acquired by The Courtauld since 2018. Nearly half of the works are by women artists with highlights including a pair of prints by Mary Cassatt (1844-1926), the first by this major Impressionist artist to be represented in the collection. Earlier works comprise an animated battle scene by the Florentine artist Giovanni Battista Foggini (1652-1725), a Roman cityscape by British watercolourist Jonathan Skelton (c.1735-1759), as well as Victorian watercolours and prints. Modern and contemporary works range from the figurative to the abstract by artists including Maliheh Afnan (1936-2016), Sir Frank Bowling (b.1934), Deanna Petherbridge (1939-2024), Susan Schwalb (b. 1944), Linda Karshan (b.1947) and Sir Grayson Perry (b.1960).\n\nThe programme of displays in the Gilbert and Ildiko Butler Drawings Gallery is generously supported by the International Music and Art Foundation, with additional support from James Bartos.\n\nJasper Johns: The Seasons\n\nProject Space\n\n28 February – 12 May 2024\n\nBetween 1984 and 1991, the pioneering American artist Jasper Johns (b.1930), focused on the theme of the four seasons and produced an ambitious and extensive body of work, including paintings, drawings and prints. The Seasons are rich and complex works, weaving together themes relating to artistic creation, the passage of time and the artist’s own biography. Most prominently, Johns’ shadow appears in each of the compositions, cast across the multi-layered imagery. Printmaking is one of Johns’ major preoccupations and this display reveals how he uses an array of techniques to create a collaging of imagery that is both evocative and mysterious.\n\nThe Courtauld was fortunate to be given this series of prints in 2016 by Barbara Bertozzi Castelli, the widow of John’s long-term dealer Leo Castelli, and is the only museum in the United Kingdom to have such a comprehensive group of these prints in its collection.\n\nThe Griffin Catalyst Exhibition: Frank Auerbach. The Charcoal Heads\n\nDenise Coates Exhibition Galleries\n\nUntil 27 May 2024\n\nThis exhibition brings together a group of seventeen large-scale portrait heads in charcoal by Frank Auerbach (b.1931) – considered some of his early masterpieces – alongside a selection of six paintings Auerbach made of the same sitters. Produced in the 1950s and 1960s, the series of charcoal heads reveal the significance of drawing to the development of Auerbach’s practice as he found his voice as a young artist. It is the first time such a substantial group of the post-war charcoal heads have been brought together, drawn from public and private collections, including works that have rarely been exhibited before.\n\nThe exhibition’s lead sponsor is Griffin Catalyst, the civic engagement initiative of Citadel Founder and CEO Kenneth C. Griffin. The exhibition is supported by the Huo Family Foundation and The Garcia Family Foundation, with additional support from the Rothschild Foundation.\n\nThe Courtauld Lates: Frank Auerbach\n\n24 May 2024\n\nTickets £5-14\n\nThe Courtauld Gallery will be open for late-night access until 22:30 on 24 May as part of its Courtauld Lates series – giving visitors the chance to enjoy an evening of world-class art, cocktails and music surrounded by The Courtauld’s collection of masterpieces at Somerset House.
