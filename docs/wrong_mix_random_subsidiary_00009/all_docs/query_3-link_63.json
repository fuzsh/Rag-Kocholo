        "text": "This past year, we proudly crafted a road map and vision for what’s ahead, our 2023-2027 Strategic Plan. A committee of our Trustees, chaired by Marc Jones, and a core team of senior staff members, including President and CEO Michael W. Ames, worked together with Cheryl Lower as our consultant to create the plan and bring countless other perspectives in along the way.\n\nOur bold vision for the future is that by 2027, we will deepen our impact, expanding programming to meet unmet needs for the individuals and communities we currently serve and to reach some new individuals and communities who need us.\n\nWe will do so by being—and being known as—expert in the work we do. And we will do so by being—and being known as—a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace with an outstanding culture where all who work with us feel like they can excel and grow in their careers.\n\nMarc Jones, a longtime Board Member, who helped steer the plan’s creation, shared his excitement about the process and the final plan: “Over a hundred people from a variety of perspectives internal and external contributed to making this plan what it is, and it was a joy to get to know as many as I did. This plan is truly a reminder that our work was created to honor Robert F. Kennedy’s values. It ensures that we will grow to meet the great need for our services that exists right now, just as RFK did in his time.”\n\nThe Detention Diversion Advocacy Program (DDAP) served 84 youth, 31% more than last year. Program participants received mentoring and legal assistance, and support in accessing services like mental health treatment, employment, education, financial literacy, and housing. Importantly, at 90-days post-discharge, 100% of graduates had no new delinquency charges. DDAP Suffolk County also held their first annual resource fair in April of 2023 at the Franklin Park Zoo.\n\nLegacy Mentoring (Legacy), already serving Hampden County, added a mentor to serve Berkshire County this year as a result of new funding. The program served 50 youth experiencing or are at-risk of becoming commercially sexually exploited, an 11 % increase from last year. In addition to engaging widely in the community, the Legacy team presented on a panel with Baystate Advocacy Center in recognition of Human Trafficking month in January of 2024 as part of their commitment to bring increased education and awareness of CSEC along with enhancing provider connections. In 2024, Legacy Mentoring is celebrating it’s 5th year of operations.\n\nRein in a Dream Therapeutic Horsemanship Program (RIAD) provided services to 119 people, 73 of whom were enrolled in RFK Community Alliance programs and 46 of whom were from the community. Services included equine- and animal-assisted therapy, job-skills development, and clinical services. In 2024, RIAD is celebrating it’s 35th year of operations.\n\nThe Young Adult Supported Living Program (YASL) has served 11 adults since its inception in 2022, supporting young adults transitioning out of foster care to live independently in both Western and Central Massachusetts. In addition to providing cost-free housing, we offer case management, life-skills training, and experiential learning in conjunction with the MA Department of Children and Families to ensure stable futures. We continue to see a high number of referrals for this relatively new program. This year, we hosted holiday events, clinical workshops, team building events, and art presentations to promote community and build teamwork.\n\nGiving back is in Donato Tramuto’s heart.\n\nIn his lifetime, Donato has endured far too many challenges and tragedies. At the age of 8, he endured significant hearing loss in both ears and was often ill due to multiple corrective surgeries. He was bullied in school and felt deeply lonely. As a young adult, he regained his health and hearing and subsequently catapulted up the corporate ladder to become a successful CEO as an adult. But he also lost several family members tragically and what's more, he lost close family friends on one of the September 11th flights, a plane he and his friends were planning to travel together on.\n\nWhile he navigated the darkest lows of these challenges and tragedies, Donato looked to the wisdom and values of his childhood heroes, Martin Luther King Jr and Robert F. Kennedy. Donato shared that he was inspired that RFK didn’t start as a Civil Rights leader, but that he died as one. In these heroes, Donato saw leadership defined by kindness, compassion, and bravery.\n\nToday, Donato is an author, speaker, and philanthropist, traveling the world to share his story and teach compassionate leadership. Donato shared that he gives back to RFK Community Alliance because at the core of our work is helping young people find inspiration and build their future. His own life was defined by tragedy, but also by family and teachers who believed in him and helped him triumph.\n\nHe believes that the heroes of tomorrow won’t be one or two people, but instead groups of young people who band together to inspire and change the world for the better. That youth, just like many of the young people in our care, will gain strength, share their stories, and blaze a future for all.\n\nSince 2017, Donato and his foundations have provided significant support to RFK Community Alliance. Many of his donations have been donated with the intention that we use them where it’s needed most, while many have also come in the form of grants that have supported staff training in trauma informed care and most recently, helped us launch our Achievement in Motion Mentoring program (AIM).\n\nWe are proud to count Donato and his husband, Jeff Porter, as friends, partners, and donors, and we were pleased to honor Donato at our 2017 Embracing the Legacy celebration for the ways he embodies the values of RFK (pictured). Donato: Thank you for your love, advocacy, and support."
