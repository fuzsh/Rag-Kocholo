        "text": "LATESTÂ NEWS\n\nApril 11, 2018\n\n2018 Forsyth County Teacher Grants Announced\n\nThe Winston-Salem Foundation is pleased to announce the recipients of the 2018 Forsyth County Teacher Grants for professional development to K-12th grade teachers in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools. A total of $63,317 was granted to 38 teacher grantees (see following pages). The selection committee, comprised of a panel of professional educators, made the awards in support of innovative and results-oriented educational experiences for teachers to improve their teaching ability and enhance the subject or content being taught in the classroom.\n\nThe Winston-Salem Foundation is most appreciative of the following component funds that provided funding for this yearâs Forsyth County Teacher Grants:\n\nSam and Anne Booke Family Trust was established in 1989 by family members of Sam and Anne Booke to improve the quality of life in Winston-Salem and Forsyth County. Grants fund professional development opportunities for PK-12 teachers in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools.\n\nGaddy Educator Fund was established in 1995 by Dr. Joe E. Gaddy, Jr. to provide grants for the professional staff at R. J. Reynolds High School. Dr. Gaddy graduated from Reynolds High School in 1963, completed his undergraduate degree at Davidson College and his medical degree at UNC-Chapel Hill.\n\nDoris Joyce Kohfeldt Educator Fund was established in 2016 by Joyce Kohfeldt to help support and sustain the Foundation's Teacher Grants program in Forsyth County. Particular emphasis may be given to teachers in public schools, grades pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, to provide funds to support professional development opportunities and/or to subsidize classroom projects.\n\nMaytrice Walton Fund was established in 1989 by the family of the late Maytrice Walton, one of Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schoolsâ most remarkable teachers. The funds are used for professional growth opportunities and enrichment for a Winston-Salem/Forsyth County elementary teacher.\n\nBlanche Raper Zimmerman Fund was established in 1986 by Mrs. Zimmerman and provides assistance for teachers to increase their understanding of and appreciation for various world cultures, with preference for teachers of social studies or history.\n\nThe Winston-Salem Foundation is a community foundation that supports charitable programs in the greater Forsyth County area. Founded in 1919 with a $1,000 gift, it now administers 1,450 funds and had total custodial assets of more than $605 million at the end of 2017. In 2017, the Foundation granted $46.3 million to charitable causes, almost $2.9 million of which was through its Community Grants program.
