Abstract(Limit 200 words) The second phase of a submerged cultural resource survey in the waters of Pensacola was conducted in 1992, based on recommendations made during an initial phase of shipwreck location, identification, and analysis. Increased public education and participation in this continuing management model included a public conference, a workshop for sport divers, a public proposal to establish Florida's fourth Underwater Archaeological Preserve, and a maritime atlas of Florida. Continuing remote sensing of Pensacola Bay further refined the model's proactive tools, resulting in the addition of early shipwreck sites to complete a classification matrix which includes various management options for future trial and implementation statewide, based on the Pensacola model. 17.

They are fragile and finite, since, unlike natural resources, they cannot be regenerated once they are disturbed or destroyed. Today, many of these sites are being threatened statewide by beach erosion, coastal development, dredging, and illegal collecting or salvage activities. At present, the State of Florida lacks a comprehensive research and management plan for submerged cultural resources within its jurisdiction. A lack of regional and site-specific data, poor inventories, outdated management policies, and limited interagency coordination have restricted the state's ability to protect, preserve, and promote these unique state-owned resources for the public benefit. Very few surveys and assessments of the resource base have been conducted for the sake of management and protection. Consequently, data about submerged cultural resources are marginal. Nonconsumptive data collection strategies have been nonexistent, and the public lacks knowledge of and appreciation for its underwater cultural resources. In compliance with the U. S. Secretary of the Interior's guidelines for the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, the Florida Division of Historical Resources has begun to focus on inventory, evaluation, protection, and interpretation of shipwreck sites, which remain the most threatened segment of the resource base. In 1990 and 1991, the Division was awarded Coastal Zone funding to develop a regional model for resource management based on a survey and inventory of sites in Pensacola Bay. With a long history of maritime activities in a broad range of site environments, the bay was considered an ideal location in which to develop preliminary classifications of sites and potential management options. The project was designed as a pilot program in which research strategies for the compilation of resource data, and management tools for resource protection and interpretation could be developed and tested at a regional level, and then applied as a model to other locations in Florida. The Pensacola Shipwreck Survey, as the project came to be called, established its headquarters in the Pensacola Historical District in January 1991. Core staff included Dr. Roger C. Smith, Billy Ray Morris, and Marianne Franklin, working with a number of local volunteers and students. From archival and published materials, oral interviews, and preliminary remote sensing using magnetometry and sonar, 162 possible target sites were gathered into a computer data base and filing system. The chronological range of possible sites in Pensacola was divided into eight time periods: The First Spanish Period (1513- 1763), The British Period (1763-1783), The Second Spanish Period (1783-1821),-The Early American Period (1821-1861), The Civil War Period (1861-1865), The Maritime Expansion Period (1865-1906), The Early 20th-Century Period (1906-1945), and The Later 20th-Century Period (1945-Present). These periods generally follow the historical development of Florida, but were refined to reflect maritime phases of Pensacola's past. Research strategy centered on four geographical areas in the Pensacola Bay system that were known to be associated with past maritime activities, and to contain accumulations of wrecked or abandoned vessels. These areas included the bay itself, the Gulf Breeze peninsula, the bayous, and Blackwater River. Within these areas, 33 significant sites were located, primarily through local informants, for study and assessment. Each site was recorded and evaluated on criteria such as extent and condition of structural remains, hull type and construction methods, historical significance, and environmental and cultural impacts to the site. The 33 sites ranged in size from a 16-foot punt to the 350-foot-long remains of an American battleship, and in age from the second half of the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century. Their condition also varied from extremely well preserved to badly deteriorated and disturbed. The majority of the study sites were associated with the Maritime Expansion and Early 20th-Century Periods; none were identified from the First and Second Spanish Periods, and no sites from the Late 20th Century were studied. The first phase of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey sought to build a shipwreck classification matrix from the limited 33-site sample base. Data derived from the study were arranged into site iv categories by age and by integrity. Within the matrix, the sites were assigned priority ratings to determine the range of proposed resource management options viable for each site. These options ranged from restricted public access at a site at one end of the spectrum, to commercial salvage for the sale of artifacts at the other. Management options in between these two extremes included archaeological reserve status, public preserve status, professional research utilization, amateur research permitting, etc. The results of this 1991 study were compiled into a report which explored the natural, environmental, and maritime industrial history of Pensacola Bay, outlined previous research work, and detailed the methodology, assessments, and conclusions of the project. Circulated for review and input among various federal, state, and local agencies, the report was published in 1992 (Franklin, Morris, and Smith, \"Submerged Historical Resources of Pensacola Bay, Florida. The Pensacola Shipwreck Survey, Phase One, 1991.\" Florida Archaeological Reports 25, Tallahassee: Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research, 1992). The report made several specific recommendations for future work in Pensacola, which included additional remote sensing to locate sites from periods not represented in the 1991 study, continuation and expansion of public education toward resource protection and preservation, establishment of the battleship USS Massachusetts as a State Underwater Archaeological Preserve, and formulation of an amateur underwater archaeology workshop for sport divers interested in the resources. With continued funding from the Florida Coastal Zone Management Program, the second phase of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey commenced in 1992. Aside from Dr. Smith, staff included James Spirek, Della Scott, Michael Williamson, and Charles Hughson, assisted by a number of volunteers. This phase sought to address the recommendations for further work in Pensacola to construct a regional model for site investigation, assessment, and public participation in the long-term management of submerged cultural resources. Specific tasks in this strategy included an increased program of public outreach, education, and participation, a formal public proposal for the Massachusetts preserve, a sport diver workshop, and a more systematic and intensive remote sensing survey to locate additional submerged sites in selected portions of the bay. The program of public outreach began with the organization of a Conference on Maritime History and Archaeology that was held in May 1992 at a local county recreational center. The purpose of the conference was to gather speakers and sponsors from various organizations and businesses in order to host a public event that focused on Pensacola's submerged cultural resources. Aside from formal presentations, display booths representing various sponsoring groups encouraged informal exchanges of information and fostered new acquaintances. The conference proved a successful tool with which to explore Pensacola's maritime past, while at the same time it helped to identify those people interested in working together to preserve it. At the conference, a formal presentation and written proposal to establish the USS Massachusetts as a state Underwater Archaeological Preserve was delivered to the public. As the oldest surviving American battleship (BB-2), the shipwreck site had been nominated in 1990 by a local diver to be considered for this designation. As with the previous preserves, Urca de Lima, San Pedro, and City of Hawkinsville, the proposal called for active public participation in the establishment, interpretation, management, and maintenance of the site for the public benefit. Based on response to the proposal, it became immediately apparent that this approach to cooperative management of submerged historical sites was quite appropriate for the sunken battleship, since the site was already popular with divers and fishermen, and would become even more so, given increased interpretation and accessibility. Along with a detailed history of the ship, old photographs and other memorabilia, the preserve proposal contained a set of comparative plans comprised of measured site drawings of the remains of the ship that were scaled to actual 1910 refit plans of the ship while it was in commission. The refit plans had been obtained from the National Archives, and the site plans had been produced from hundreds of underwater hours spent measuring features of the ship's remains. These materials served not only to document the site's transformation and present configuration, but would become useful for future C interpretation of the preserve to its visitors. In response to the proposal, a community support organization calling itself Friends of the Massachusetts (BB-2) was formed to help establish the preserve. Comprised of interested individuals from v Pensacola's waterfront, historical, archaeological, and recreational communities, the non-profit organization elected officers and established committees to oversee fund-raising, production of interpretive materials, fabrication of an underwater plaque, design of a museum display, and the dedication and opening of the preserve, which is scheduled for the spring of 1993. Another public-oriented management tool developed for the Pensacola model was a one-week educational workshop to orient sport divers to underwater archaeology and historic preservation. Because sport divers often encounter and may unknowingly disturb submerged sites, the workshop was designed to provide training in the identification, recording, and reporting of new sites, and in the monitoring and protection of previously recorded sites. The outline for the workshop was written by staff of the Shipwreck Survey in accordance with national scuba certification agencies, and a workbook was prepared with emphasis on the Pensacola region. A week-long pilot program, conducted through a local dive shop, was divided into classroom, confined water (swimming pool) sessions, and open water dives on selected sites. The cost of the workshop was minimal, and included the workbook, two charter boat dives, a state certificate of participation, a national dive specialty card, and a tee shirt. As another tool to engage public participation in resource protection and preservation, the pilot workshop was successful; integration of local dive businesses is an important ingredient, since dive shops are dedicated to teaching and depend on return customers to stay in business. They also can help to set standards for sporting behavior and recreational etiquette by fostering productive rather than destructive attitudes. Additional avenues of public outreach during the second phase of the Shipwreck Survey included routine public presentation and lectures to civic groups, schools, and avocational organizations. Survey staff responded to every invitation as an opportunity to inform the public about the goals and progress of the Pensacola project. Aside from periodic interviews in local and national newspapers and magazines, Survey team members appeared on several popular television and radio shows to present the research and to answer questions. To address the 1991 recommendations for more extensive remote sensing operations in Pensacola Bay, the Division of Historical Resources purchased a marine magnetometer and contracted the services of a side-scan sonar instrument and operator. Armed with these archaeological prospecting tools, a strategy for systematic survey of areas associated with past maritime activities, with good maritime geographical configurations, and reported to contain shipwreck sites was adopted. Magnetometry was employed on the western shore of the Gulf Breeze peninsula, Old Navy Cove, the southern side of the peninsula in Santa Rosa Sound, along Emanuel Point in Escambia Bay, and in selected areas of the Pensacola waterfront. Sonar was employed along the north side of Santa Rosa Island, the western side of Gulf Breeze, Old Navy Cove, and along the Naval Air Station waterfront. - Remote sensing targets identified by both instruments were pinpointed using LORAN-C coordinates, evaluated by amplitude, duration, and configuration, and chosen for diving investigation to determine the nature of each target. Of the hundreds of magnetic and acoustical anomalies encountered during the survey, fifty-two were chosen for ground-truthing by divers. Following identification and evaluation, the targets were classified into several descriptive categories: Disposal, intentional and accidental (with subheadings of fishing, dredging, military, and construction); Natural Feature; Geologic Feature; Buried Object; Ballast Dump; Shipwreck; Historical Material; Anchorage; and Active Structure. The predominant category of ground-truthed anomalies was accidental or intentional disposal of recent material, which accounted for 48% of all investigated targets. Natural Features comprised 23% of the anomalies; Buried Objects, 10%; Ballast Dump, 6%; Shipwrecks, 4%; Geological Features, 4%; and 2% each for Anchorages, Historic Materials, and Active Structures. Some 27% of the ground-truthed targets proved of no historical significance, which would be expected in a highly active and heavily trafficked bay. Three targets, in particular, were found to represent significant discoveries; Santa Rosa Island Wreck, which tentatively dates from the Second Spanish Period; Emanuel Point Wreck, dated to the First Spanish Period; and Wayside Park Ballast Pile, which has not yet been confirmed as a shipwreck. These vi sites warrant further investigation, in order to confirm their origin, nationality, and date, and to assign them a classification in the Pensacola Shipwreck Matrix. The Pensacola pilot project refined and tested a series of data collection and management tools ranging from traditional archival research and archaeological field work to experiments with public participation at all levels of resource identification and protection. To date, the project has accomplished a number of important goals. Assessment, in a variety of aquatic environments, of over 40 submerged sites, ranging from one of the nation's first battleships (USS Massachusetts BB-2) to a possible l6th- century Spanish vessel (perhaps the earliest shipwreck in the state), helped to formulate a resource classification matrix based on age and integrity to which various management options could be applied. To explore management effectiveness and public response to these options, tools that were tested in Pensacola included formal public conferences, lectures, exhibits, and newsletters, regional print and visual media exposure, personal interaction with divers and fishermen, interagency coordination of management agreements and law enforcement, and sportdiver training workshops in resource identification and protection. Highly visible events in Pensacola helped to gauge the effectiveness of the tools; vandalism to a colonial wrecksite; interruption of homeport dredging by discovery of a bronze howitzer, the costly mitigation of a large buried navy cofferdam; the discovery and protection of an early Spanish shipwreck; and the creation of a new public preserve at the Massachusetts. Aside from interaction between government and private sectors, it is clear that public education and participation were key elements in the development and success of the Pensacola model. Building on the Pensacola project, a statewide compilation of environmental, archaeological, and historical data about Florida's submerged cultural resources has been undertaken to produce a maritime atlas. The atlas is divided by regions and time periods, and addresses topics such as the geography of inundated prehistoric river channels and shorelines, historic shipping routes, navigational hazards, known ship losses, reported and recorded sites, classification of sites by age and type, and predictive models for expected site locations. As a tool for understanding the breadth and scope of the state's resources, the atlas is being used to identify other regions of Florida in which test the Pensacola model to a smaller scale to determine its usefulness in the creation of a comprehensive statewide management plan. 0 Vii TABLE OF CONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY .................................................................................................................... iii TABLE OF CONTENTS ........................................................................................................................ vii LIST OF FIGURES ................................................................................................................................ ix ACKNOWLEDGMENTS .......................................................................................................................x CHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION Pensacola has a long and rich maritime tradition; today evidence of this tradition lies at the bottom of Pensacola Bay. The mission of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey was to identify and to assess this evidence, and to build public awareness and appreciation of these submerged cultural resources. The 1992 season is a continuation of the work of the 1991 season with a stronger focus on public education. The history of Pensacola begins with shipwrecks. In 1559 Don Tristin de Luna y Arellano sailed into Pensacola Bay to establish the first Spanish colony in present-day United States. Although there had been a few reports of the great bay called Ochuse by Spanish explorers, this was the first attempt at colonization. However, less than a month after their arrival, a hurricane destroyed eight of the twelve vessels, as well as the hope for a permanent colony (Priestly 1928). Homeless and hungry, the settlers finally returned to New Spain in 1561 and Pensacola was forgotten. More than a century later the site of Pensacola was once again considered for colonization by the Spanish, in response to British and French forays into North America. The colony was a success and Pensacola remained populated, although the garrison changed nationality several times. Evidence of the occupation of Pensacola by the Spanish, British, and French lies on the bottom of Pensacola Bay in the form of shipwrecks and the remains of maritime industry particular to those cultures. Over the years Pensacola became a major port facility. The lumber boom during the 1800s through the early 1900s contributed to Pensacola's growth, as the harbor filled with schooners and barges transporting timber from the interior to all points foreign and domestic. The red snapper fishing industry also grew during this time from a sailor's pastime while waiting to assist ships across the bar to a full- fledged industry. Pensacola grew not only economically but geographically during this era of maritime industrial expansion through the early 20th century. Offloaded ballast from many ships caused the shoreline of Pensacola to extend southward nearly 3000 feet from Main Street (Bense 1989:17). With expansion of the Naval Air Station and the homeporting of the Navy's only training carrier, the city of Pensacola still depends on the bay and associated activities as an economic mainstay. The mission of the multi-year Pensacola project includes not only the investigation of shipwrecks in Pensacola Bay, but also the development of a model for submerged cultural resource management that can be tested in other regions of the state. A second aspect is the preparation of a maritime atlas of Florida that will clarify relationships between the historical and geographic contexts of shipwrecks, piers, docks, and other maritime -related sites. The atlas will also provide a state-wide perspective for investigating, assessing, and managing underwater sites of historical importance. - The research design of the project called for a public-oriented program with a broad scope of work to include a review of all previous investigations, collection of archival and oral information on potential sites, underwater field research with local divers and fishermen, and electronic remote sensing to detect new sites. Development of an inventory and assessment system for targets and verified sites, establishment of a classification scheme for sites studied, and proposals for appropriate management options for the sites were addressed as well (Franklin et at. 1992:225-231). In order to accomplish the mission, specific goals were set for each phase of the project. The goal of the 1991 Shipwreck Survey, Phase I, was to initiate the inventory of known shipwreck sites in Pensacola Bay, examine these wrecks, assess the identity and function of the vessels, and make recommendations to protect their remains. These tasks were completed and the information was disseminated with the publication of a report entitled \"Submerged Cultural Resources of Pensacola Bay, Florida: The Pensacola Shipwreck Survey, Phase One, 1991\" (Franklin et al. 1992), outlining in detail each vessel encountered during the 1991 season. Also in 1991, public education was begun by printing newsletters and speaking to numerous groups and organizations about the project. The progress of the project was featured several times in local newspaper, magazine, radio, and television reports. Construction of a regional model for site investigation, assessment, and long term management of submerged cultural resources in Pensacola Bay also was completed. This model was developed by gathering data on shipwrecks to create an inventory of historic sites. An assessment of these sites in terms of date, construction, state of preservation, and possible threats also was part of the model. 2 During the first field season in 1991, 33 sites, out of 169 historically documented shipwrecks in Pensacola Bay, were identified and assessed using this model. The majority of the sites dated from the Maritime Expansion (1865-1906) and Early 20th Century (1906-1945) periods in Pensacola@s history, as was expected due to increased maritime activity during those periods. Types of vessels located and identified included lumber schooners, barges, a punt, a battleship, fishing vessels, Civil War era vessels, and a British colonial ship. Most of these vessels appear to have been abandoned rather than wrecked, as was evidenced by their intact condition and their association with the locations of past maritime activities (Franklin et a]. 1992:224). All 33 identified sites were integrated into a matrix of management options. This was accomplished by classifying the sites by time periods and by structural and site integrity, such as condition of hull remains and amount and type of artifactual material. These criteria helped to determine archaeological significance and to assign appropriate management options for each site. Management options ranged from restricting public access by assigning reserve, preserve, or historic marker status, to granting professional research or amateur research permits, to entering into exploration or salvage contracts (Franklin et al. 1992:226-228). Based on the 1991 results, the following proposals were made to local, state, and federal agencies. First, the report recommended that an underwater archaeological preserve be established in the Pensacola area. The nomination in 1990 of the USS Massachusetts for this status was the first step toward the preserve. A second recommendation was that an amateur underwater archaeology workshop be conducted to foster the growing interest of local sport divers in helping to investigate and preserve submerged cultural resources in Pensacola. Third, the report recommended the establishment of an amateur permit program which would sanction amateur non-disturbing investigation and reporting and would encourage organized groups of sport divers to gather data on shipwrecks in cooperation with the State of Florida. Other recommendations included establishing an historic marker program for certain sites of regional and state-wide importance, and creation of a new Florida Site File form specifically for shipwrecks. Finally, increased interagency cooperation was recommended between the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey and agencies such as the City of Gulf Breeze, the Historic Pensacola Preservation Board, Florida Department of Natural Resources, Florida Marine Patrol, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Park Service, and the State University System. Recommendations for the 1992 Pensacola Shipwreck Survey season stemmed from research areas that could not be addressed during the 1991 season due to time constraints and lack of equipment. The most pressing recommendation was to conduct more in-depth remote sensing surveys. The procurement of a sub-bottom profiling system and a more accurate positioning system was stressed. A search for the 1559 fleet of Tristdn de Luna, with survey work concentrated in high probability locations, was assigned as a high priority in the 1992 season. Recommendations were made to survey certain areas of Pensacola Bay, such as the western side of the Gulf Breeze peninsula, Bayou Chico, and the deep-water central sections of the bay. It was suggested that efforts be directed toward finding the HMS Mentor and a Civil War-era gun boat that were burned in the Blackwater River. Finally, the report noted that the wrecks in the Gulf of Mexico south of Santa Rosa Island, recorded by Louis Tesar in 1973 in his archaeological survey of Gulf Islands National Seashore, could have become more exposed due to the shifting of the sand covering them. The report recommended attempts be made to locate and record these wrecks in order to better understand how the environment has affected site preservation. The goals of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey in 1992, Phase 11, included continuation of the previous year's work, as well as completion of remote sensing surveys of portions of the bay with a magnetometer and side-scan sonar (Figure 1), and expansion of the public awareness program. Specific tasks included presenting the second Maritime History and Archaeology Conference, evaluating the USS Massachusetts for inclusion in Florida's underwater archaeology preserve system, preparing and presenting an Orientation to Underwater Archaeology for Sport Divers workshop, adding wreck sites to the maritime atlas, and continuing the refinement of the Pensacola model for shipwreck management for application to other regions of the state. The first and foremost task of the Survey was to find and document shipwrecks, with special emphasis on locating colonial wrecks, such as ships from the Luna expedition of 1559. No examples 3 of ships from the First and Second Spanish Periods were discovered during the 1991 field season, and information was needed concerning those periods in Pensacola's shipwreck matrix. All of these tasks are outlined in detail in the following chapters. Chapter Two deals with public education and awareness efforts. Chapter Three details the establishment of the USS Massachuseas as an underwater archaeology preserve. Chapter Four and Five discuss remote sensing methodology and results, respectively. Interviews with local watermen and captains are the subject of Chapter Six. The descriptions of all wrecks assessed during Phase 11 are in Chapter Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine present the conclusions and recommendations, respectively. The 1992 crew of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey included the following people. Dr. Roger C. Smith, Florida's State Underwater Archaeologist, was the project director. James D. Spirek, a graduate of the East Carolina University master's program in Maritime History and Underwater Research, was project field director. Della A. Scott, a NAUI instructor and graduate of the University of West Florida and Troy State University, held the position of field supervisor. The positions of field technician were held by Michael Hoyt Williamson, a student at the University of West Florida, and Charles Hughson, a student at Florida State University. 4 6 0 40 c c Escambia River Black Survey Location Escambia Bay Bayou.Texar Blackwater Bay PENSACOLA Bayou hico Garcon Point East Bay Bayou Grande Pensacola Bay Gulf Breeze Peninsula 131 Lagoon Santa Rosa Sound Perdido eY P nsacola Pass E59Z==mmm= Santa Rosa Island 1 -.t 0 1 2 3 Map of Project Location YARDS Figure 1.

PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS One important aspect of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey in 1992 was to bring the survey and its findings to the attention of the people of Pensacola. Due to the efforts of archaeologists from the University of West Florida, the importance of Pensacola's terrestrial past is frequently emphasized and publicized. The Pensacola Shipwreck Survey wanted to promote interest in the city's maritime past and to bring information about it to people of Pensacola in as many ways as possible. Conference on Maritime History and Archaeology The process of informing the public about their submerged cultural heritage really began in 1988 with the first Conference on Maritime History and Marine Archaeology. The conference, held on May 21, 1988 at The Wright Place in downtown Pensacola, was open to anyone interested. Over the course of the six-hour conference many aspects of underwater archaeology were addressed. Speakers included representatives from the Florida Division of Historical Resources, the University of West Florida, the National Park Service, and the Historic Pensacola Preservation Board, as well as local historians and divers. Topics ranged from conservation to shipwrecks in Pensacola and other parts of Florida, to cultural resource management, to underwater archaeological techniques. The first conference produced an increased awareness of Pensacola's maritime past and the importance of preserving this heritage. As a result of this conference, UWF decided to sponsor an undergraduate field school in conjunction with the City of Gulf Breeze to excavate the remains of a colonial British ship located on Deadman's Island. The field school took place in the summer of 1989. Due to increased interest in Pensacola's historic shipwrecks, especially those found and recorded in 1991, the Survey decided to organize another conference. The second Conference on Maritime History and Archaeology was held May 16, 1992, at the South Santa Rosa County Recreational Center in Gulf Breeze. Once again many organizations and businesses in the community agreed to sponsor the conference and help defray costs. Speakers represented the underwater archaeological community from Florida to North Carolina, the sport diving community, and those involved with historic preservation and cultural resource management. (For a list of sponsors, speakers, and their topics, see Appendix 1). A formal proposal was made at the second conference to establish the USS Massachusetts as the fourth Florida State Underwater Archaeological Preserve. The conference also increased support for the Shipwreck Survey, and interested parties contacted the Survey to volunteer for the USS Massachusetts Preserve Project. The conference also increased awareness of underwater archaeological projects in other parts of the state and nation. Over 100 people attended the second Conference on Maritime History and Archaeology. The large attendance demonstrated the latent interest in Pensacola's maritime past among the residents of the area. Many attendees suggested a conference be held every year to keep the public interest high and to keep the public informed about the archaeological projects going on in Pensacola Bay and around the state. Sport Diver Workshops Because sport divers often find and may unknowingly disturb historic shipwrecks, a formal workshop was organized by the Survey staff to educate the sport divers about the submerged cultural resources in Pensacola Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The week-long intensive workshop was not intended to be a field school nor to present underwater archaeological theory, but simply to train sport divers in techniques of non-disturbance observation and the rudiments of recording and reporting shipwreck sites. With this training, it was hoped, the divers would become actively involved in identifying and protecting underwater cultural resources in Pensacola. 8 The need for this type of instruction had been demonstrated on several occasions in Pensacola. For example, the Deadman's Island Wreck was vandalized in the summer of 1991 by unknown persons looking for artifacts. Many timbers were disarticulated and thrown on shore in a vain attempt to find 64 goodies.\" In another instance, a bronze howitzer dating from the colonial period was encountered by a private dredging company when it became caught in the dredge pump. The incident was discovered only when one of the dredge vessel's crewmen, fearing a shipwreck had been discovered and damaged, alerted the local media. The outline for a workshop entitled \"Orientation to Underwater Archaeology for Sport Divers\" was written by Pensacola Shipwreck Survey staff, in accordance with national certifying agency training standards and underwater archaeology educational standards, and was sent to various dive instruction agencies in the United States and abroad for their review. Agencies included the International Dive Educators Association (IDEA), International Scuba Educators Association (ISEA), National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS), National Association of Scuba Educators (NASE), National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI), Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), Professional Scuba Instructors Corporation (PSIC), Scuba Schools International (SSI), and Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA). A cover letter enclosed with the outline explained the purpose of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey and the expectations of the workshop. Advice and comments were solicited from each agency's director of training and education, and input on the course was requested. The completed outline was the main component of the workbook written for the class. The workbook was created to accompany lectures and exercises during the class and to provide students with resource material information to aid them should they find an undocumented historic shipwreck. The workbook included essays, regulation information, glossaries, and bibliographies. Also included in the workbook were illustrations of ship construction, diagrams of ship features and their nautical terms, and site plans of Pensacola wrecks. (See Appendix 2 for contents of workbook). The orientation workshop was designed to be co-sponsored by local dive shops. Dive shops are dedicated to teaching and depend on students to be return customers in order to stay in business. Specialty classes, such as underwater archaeology, are beginning to be in demand and offer dive shops another opportunity to attract people. Additionally, the shop made considerable profit by residual sales such as gloves, hoods, lights, air, and equipment rentals. Such incentives make it easy to convince other dive shops to host workshops. Most shop owners realize the strong public interest in underwater archaeology, but do not have qualified personnel to teach the class. The State-sponsored workshop offers not only well-qualified instructors but a chance for the dive shop to make money as well. The workshop was divided into three stages: classroom instruction, confined water or pool training sessions, and open water dives. Classroom topics included the purpose of archaeology.- ethics, conservation and preservation, laws pertaining to Florida shipwrecks, types of sites, ship construction, local history, and research, survey, and recording techniques. Additionally, the maritime history of Pensacola, including known ship losses, was discussed. Slides depicting various techniques and video of the Deadman's Wreck excavation were shown in class as teaching aids. The pool session focused on recording a mock shipwreck set up on the bottom of the dive shop pool. This wreck was designed by the field technicians, and included artifacts and ship-related items, including a simulated cannon. Open water dives were made on local historic shipwrecks. The first dive was an exercise in recording the features of a shipwreck exposed above sand level. Dive number two was an exercise in the completion of a Florida shipwreck site form, and in non-disturbance observation techniques. The third and fourth dives were made on a previously undocumented site known as the Kruse Site after the charter boat captain, Ron Kruse, who suggested the site as an alternative to the USS Massachusetts because the seas were too rough to go out into the Gulf. Divers were divided into teams with the tasks of recording prominent features, making an overall sketch, and measuring length and width dimensions. The site plan compiled by the students for this previously undocumented site is included (Figure 2). After the last dive, a final class session was held to review the class and to discuss additional ways for the students to continue to work together to record and protect historic shipwrecks in Pensacola Bay. 12' x 5' Boats/Pontoons BOX# 27' x 5' 23 231 & 71X Log 0 0 ft Bricks Pipes Cradle 6555-3- NOMW Fish net Steel Plates Flat Plate Pipes 4@2\" X 1 '21' 60 X 21 Cable 23 0 Tanks Overall 2001 Cast Iron Fitting 6 Kruse Site 0 A Figure 2.

A total of nine students enrolled with backgrounds varying from neural surgeon to bail bondsman to professional photographer. The cost was $150.00 and included two charter boat trips to local historic shipwreck sites, the workbook, a State of Florida certificate of participation, a NAUI or PADI specialty card, and a Pensacola Shipwreck Survey T-shirt. The remainder of the tuition went to the dive shop owners to help defray their costs. The workshop resulted in the students' gaining an increased interest and understanding of why submerged cultural resources should be preserved. The students enjoyed the class and requested the creation of an advanced class that would deal with more in-depth theory and techniques. The class as a whole was very interested in Pensacola's maritime heritage and expressed surprise at the long history of shipping in the area; many were unaware of the number of ship losses in Pensacola Bay. Questions were asked pertaining to the Abandoned Shipwreck Act and shipwreck laws in Florida. Most of the students were surprised to learn of Florida's leniency in allowing treasure hunters to keep up to 80% of what they find. The students were also quite interested in the tools used by underwater archaeologists and were surprised the tools are so simple. The students requested more information on ship construction and terminology, artifacts that might be encountered in shipwrecks, and how to use the artifacts to date the wreck and determine the origin of the ship. Many of the students asked to volunteer with the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey and requested information on other underwater archaeological projects that need volunteers. A final questionnaire, with questions such as \"I learned...\" and \"I liked...\" and \"I would recommend ...... was answered by each student. Recommendations from students included holding the class in warmer weather and providing more information on ship construction and artifact typology. Some important lessons were learned by the Survey staff and will affect the way future workshops are taught. For instance, the mock shipwreck must be modified to ensure all features and artifacts are heavy enough to stay where they are placed on the pool bottom. Additionally, an alternate wreck location is essential in case the seas are too rough to allow the planned trip to the USS Massachusetts, as occurred during the first class. An additional class session dealing with ship construction, nautical archaeology, and artifact typology and identification is also planned for the next class, as per the recommendations of the students in the first class. All of the students were pleased with the class and felt they had received their money's worth. As an experiment in public awareness, the sport diver workshop was one of the most successful attempts to educate the public about their submerged cultural heritage. The class was straightforward and delivered information to that group of people who are inherently interested in what lies under the waters--divers. The students were highly motivated and responded favorably to a suggestion to start a \"Historic Shipwreck Club\" in Pensacola to locate and preserve historic wrecks. By extending this model to other regions of Florida, sport divers around the state can contribute to the preservation of important historical resources that are submerged. Public Presentations Efforts to inform the public about the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey included giving lectures and presentations to various organizations and groups. Each member of the staff participated. All presentations had the common goals of informing interested parties about the work of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey and promoting the USS Massachusetts Park, in addition to covering the specific topic of the presentation. Organizations included the Pensacola Archaeological Society, Pensacola Historical Society, Sertoma Club, Pensacola Charter Boat Association, Gadsden Street Methodist Church, Naval Air Station Historical Society, University of West Florida Scuba Club, and Pleasant Grove Elementary School. Most groups wanted to hear about the work being done on the USS Massachusetts and how it would compare to other shipwreck preserves around the state. Some groups were interested more in specific topics. The NAS Historical Society was specifically interested in the military wrecks in the bay, and the Pleasant Grove Elementary School children wanted to learn about underwater archaeology in general. 12 Media Coverage The citizens of Pensacola are very interested in Pensacola Bay, and several popular local television shows focus on the water and water activities. Hosts of these shows contacted the Shipwreck Survey to request the participation of the staff. For instance, a local cable channel, BLAB-TV, featured staff members on several of its shows. \"On The Water,\" \"NAS Live,\" \"The Flack Logan Show,\" and \"Gulf Coast Outdoors\" all focused on the Survey's work and especially on the USS Massachusetts Park. Additionally, radio stations in the Pensacola area featured the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey on talk shows. WCOA and WKGT both hosted Survey and Friends of the Massachusetts representatives to talk about the Underwater Preserve and to generate support and volunteers. Local newspapers ran numerous articles on the Shipwreck Survey and the USS Massachusetts Park. The Pensacola News Journal advertised the Maritime History and Archaeology Conference and featured several articles on the proposed Massachusetts Park. Gosport, the Naval Air Station newspaper, ran an entire series of articles on the USS Massachusetts. The history of the ship, how it came to be in Pensacola, and the efforts to make the wreck a preserve were discussed in a series of three articles. Other articles also appeared in publications like the Gulf Breeze Sentinel; Associated Press sent articles on the USS Massachusetts across the country. One unexpected source of publicity came from a national scuba diving magazine. Rodale's Scuba Diving featured a two-page article on the USS Massachusetts as a prime dive site in the Florida Panhandle. Florida Scuba Times also mentioned the Massachusetts in an article about wreck dives in Florida. Media-generated publicity coincided with the other efforts to expand public knowledge and perhaps reached some people that the other avenues would not have. Local dive shops reported that charter trips to the USS Massachusetts increased since articles appeared in newspapers and Rodale's Scuba Diving. The media has continued to publicize on-going work of the Survey and the efforts of the Friends of the Massachusetts to have the battleship officially declared a preserve. Volunteers Throughout the field season the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey was assisted by a small but dedicated crew of volunteers. Many others wanted to help but personal commitments and work schedules kept them away. At times the Survey did not need volunteers; for example, during magnetorneter operations the boat was filled with equipment and the Survey team. However, when volunteers were needed they were always ready to assist. For a short time the Survey had two boats in operation and there were always volunteers to fill them. In order to obtain the most experienced divers available, the Survey placed volunteer application forms in all the dive shops in the city. In addition to name and address, applicants were also asked to give information about their diving, such as date certified and \"number of dives annually. The volunteers not only helped the ground truthing of underwater targets go more quickly, but also provided a better dive rotation among the Survey crew. Volunteers on the 1992 phase of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey ranged from college students, to lifetime natives of Pensacola, to more transient Navy personnel. In order to accommodate volunteers who, due to work schedules, could not work with the Survey during the week, the Survey crew occasionally worked on weekends. To make the best use of volunteers some simple guidelines were followed. The Survey staff found it helpful to always give the volunteer a thorough briefing about the task at hand and what to expect in terms of visibility, currents, bottom consistency, and target expectations. Furthermore, the Survey crew ensured that the volunteer dived with at least one project member. If a volunteer became uncomfortable with the diving conditions, he or she was not allowed to begin or continue the dive. Law Enforcement One other incident should be noted in this chapter, although it is not the method of choice with which to educate the public. In late October, the PSS headquarters received a report from a resident 13 of Gulf Breeze stating that possible vandalism had occurred at Deadman's Island at the location of Deadman's Wreck and Town Point Wreck. Several days later on a Saturday afternoon, Survey staff proceeded to Old Navy Cove, where they discovered a man in shallow water who appeared to be digging. Staff radioed the Coast Guard, who transferred them to the Florida Marine Patrol. Upon hearing of the situation, the Marine Patrol offered to send one of their officers, Randy Webb, back to Old Navy Cove with the staff. Officer Webb then questioned the man, who had in his possession a metal detector and a metal screen. The man stated he was aware of state laws pertaining to submerged cultural resources and knew he could be arrested for disturbing such deposits. Because the man had only fragments of glass and metal in his screen and was well away from the known shipwrecks, he was released with only a verbal warning from Officer Webb, who also took the man's name and address. A cursory examination of the contents of the man's boat proved he had not taken any larger artifacts. Though the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey has dedicated a large portion of the 1992 field season to educating the public about their submerged cultural heritage, there are still a few people who do not realize the importance of these fragile resources. These people continue to damage and disturb wreck sites, even though some are fully aware of the laws protecting shipwrecks. Only through the cooperative efforts of concerned citizens who report such offenses, and the Florida law enforcement community who enforce the laws, can these vandals be stopped. Conclusions The results of these intensive efforts to publicize the work of the Pensacola Shipwreck Survey and to educate the public about the importance of preserving submerged cultural resources are still becoming apparent. The Maritime History and Archaeology Conference was the starting point for public education and brought many facets of underwater archaeology to the attention of the people of Pensacola and Gulf Breeze. Local dive shops reported people calling from as far away as Canada, Guam, Maine, and Australia to find out more about the USS Massachusetts and to arrange charter trips specifically to dive the old ship. The entire community is aware of the efforts to make the Massachusetts a Florida State Underwater Archaeological Preserve. Organizations have donated hundreds of dollars to this end. The workshops encouraged a new kind of sport divers, who are more interested in preserving what they see rather than taking trophies home to put on the mantle, and who understand the importance of shipwrecks as \"time capsules\" of history to be studied rather than looted. Local organizations that asked for presentations helped to support the Survey and allowed the goal of education to be realized. The media in Pensacola supported the project by writing articles and featuring the Survey on television shows. The attention of national magazines also has helped to reach locals as well as people around the country. Finally, the volunteers proved that the message was reaching people. J 15 CHAPTER 3. USS MASSACHUSETTS Introduction A successful blend of preservation and recreation in the United States involves the establishment of underwater parks on shipwreck sites. Michigan, Vermont, North Carolina, Florida, and some Federal agencies (namely the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Park Service) subscribe to the notion of protecting submerged historical resources by promoting them as educational and recreational attractions. Underwater parks allow the visitor to enjoy a controlled multi-faceted experience not normally found at other dive sites. Interpretation of both cultural and natural features at a site combines an educational flavor with a recreational pursuit- -\"Education through Recreation\"--- and promotes the need for preserving historical resources. Over the past five years, Florida has adopted this submerged cultural resource management strategy and has developed an underwater archaeological preserve system unmatched in the country. This chapter discusses the creation of the earlier Florida underwater parks, and the process of developing a fourth underwater archaeological preserve, USS Massachusetts. Background of Florida Underwater Preserves The first preserve was created in response to public concern in Fort Pierce for preserving a Spanish treasure ship for sport divers. In 1987, the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research, with support from local businesses and private citizens, designated the Urca de Lima as the first Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve. Interpretive materials produced and distributed by the Bureau detailed the ill- fated journey of the ship, which was sunk, along with the rest of the 1715 treasure fleet, by a devastating hurricane. In addition, several land exhibits in various parts of the state provided shore visitors a chance to read about the vessel's history. Following the successful creation of this park through the combination of state and public resources, another treasure wreck site was nominated, the San Pedro of the 1733 fleet sunk off Indian Key, and designated in 1989 as the second Florida Archaeological Underwater Preserve. Again, state and local cooperation created a public recreation site without a large commitment of public funds. Nominations of Wrecks as Potential Preserves Impressed by the public desire to preserve submerged historical resources by these means in Fort Pierce and in the Keys, the Bureau produced and circulated a flyer to dive shops,* businesses, and local governments throughout the state to nominate popular wreck sites as potential preserves. The flyers elicited many nominations. Additional research by the Bureau determined that some of the sites varied in degrees of archaeological and historical importance, and did not meet basic requirements set forth by the Bureau. The criteria took into account the physical condition of the wreck, whether articulated or disarticulated, historical background, danger to divers, low visibility, strong currents and surge, among other guidelines for selecting a future preserve. After reviewing many nominations, the Bureau chose the City of Hawkinsville, a steamboat built in 1896 and located in the Suwannee River near Old Town, as the third underwater preserve in Florida. The park was officially opened for sport divers in 1992. In addition to receiving the nomination for the City of Hawkinsville in response to the flyer, the Bureau also received a nomination for the USS Massachusetts by a Pensacola diver. Reconnaissance of the site by the Bureau in 1991 determined the site met the requirements for inclusion in the Florida system of underwater archaeological preserves. Several preliminary steps were necessary before the vessel could be designated as a new preserve. Historical Research The first step was to accumulate as much historical data as possible about the site. This data would educate the public about the history of the old hulk and would be used to develop a shore-based exhibit. 16 Several national and local repositories contained relevant research material. The National Archives supplied photocopies of the 1910 refit plans and photographs of the Massachusetts. The Naval Historical Center also provided photographs. The Pensacola Historical Society supplied information ranging from photos to newspaper and journal accounts. Also included in the Pensacola Historical Society archives were eyewitness accounts of the shelling of the Massachusetts in 1921 as part of the coastal defenses testing along Santa Rosa Island. Several books on the pre-dreadnaught era also proved useful. Additional sources of information included personal accounts of the battleship since its arrival in Pensacola. Many local charter boat captains, fishermen, and divers who work and play in Pensacola waters have frequently visited the wreck of the Massachusetts. They witnessed or heard tales of the hulk as it slowly transformed into its current state. Several of these people even contributed to the present condition of the Old Mass. For example, one of the charter captains in Pensacola dynamited the wreck extensively in the 1950s to salvage brass fittings and lead counterweights. In the course of gathering the documents and photographs of the wreck, many facts about the USS Massachusetts's past came to light. Historical research endowed the derelict hulk with a much more intriguing and factual past than that given in the hearsay and popular legend about its origin, career, and demise. Ship History Around the turn of the century, the emphasis on developing a new all-steel navy prompted political and naval leaders to replace the obsolete monitor-class warships and the armored cruisers Maine and Texas. To effect the change, Congress appropriated funds in 1890 for the construction of the first American battleship class, the Indianas. The three vessels of the class were the Indiana (BB-1), Massachusetts (BB-2), and Oregon (BB-3) (Harris 1965: 21). The keel of the Massachusetts was laid in 1891; the ship was launched in 1893, and commissioned in 1896. Dimensions of the vessel were: length overall 350 ft.; beam 69 ft.; draft 24 ft.; overall height 35 1/2 ft.; and displacement 10,288 tons (Coleman 1991:1). The Indianas were equipped with multiple caliber guns characteristic of pre-dreadnaught warships. Their primary armament consisted of four 13-inch guns en barbelle, a secondary armament of eight 8-inch guns en barbette, and a host of lesser arms. Additionally, each ship was equipped with five torpedo tubes and, for protection against incoming torpedoes, was outfitted along its waterline with a nickel-steel armor belt with a maximum thickness of 18 inches, which tapered in thickness from amidship to the bow and stern (Navy Department 1969: 264). After its commissioning, the USS Massachusetts (Figure 3) joined the North Atlantic Squadron. In 1898, as part of the \"Flying Squadron,\" the battleship was ordered to blockade Cuba at the beginning of the Spanish-American War. Along with other blockading vessels, the Massachusetts bombarded the fort at Santiago de Cuba and engaged in combat with the Spanish cruiser Cristobal Col6n. While re- coaling, the Massachusetts missed the Battle of Santiago on 3 July 1898, but later assisted in sinking the Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes. Following the war, the battleship participated in various routine tasks with the North Atlantic Squadron. To keep up with the pace of the rapidly developing Navy fleet, Massachusetts underwent a refit in 1910 to refurbish the vessel, to remove and replace some of the smaller caliber guns, and under the supervision of Guigliemo Marconi, to install one of the first wireless radios in the fleet (Navy Department 1969: 264). At the onset of World War I, the technologically outdated battlewagon served primarily as a gunnery practice ship. Shortly after the war's end, Massachusetts was decommissioned for the final and last time, having been rendered inactive three times during its career (Navy Department: 264). The battleship's decommissioning was a timely event for Army ordnance units in need of testing outdated artillery pieces. Chosen as the target for artillery tests in Pensacola, Massachusetts was towed from Norfolk, Virginia in 1921. Improperly sunk east of Pensacola Pass, Massachusetts was re-floated and re-sunk west of the Pass in approximately 20 ft. of water. Army land batteries fired 108 rounds into the warship with the first round going straight down one of the smokestacks (Coleman 1991: 4). --3p,. VW A\"At', 41W - - - - - - - - - - Figure 3. Photo of USS Massachusetts. 0 18 0 0 0 0 go w a z a 0 19 Forgotten by the military, the hulk soon attracted fish and subsequently fishermen, picnickers, and eventually salvors interested in obtaining rights to the valuable metals on the ship. Extensive salvaging on the site occurred during the metal drive in World War II, which reduced the ship to structure below the water surface (Coleman 1991: 1). Later in the 1950s, a salvage company waged an unsuccessful attempt to begin work on the wreck. Local Pensacolians, who had adopted the hulk as a recreational site, fought the salvage efforts and filed a lawsuit. Eventually, the Florida Supreme Court decided in favor of the public and denied the company rights to salvage. The court, citing Admiralty Law, decided that the Massachusetts was rightfully the property of the State of Florida, since the Navy had abandoned the ship. Archaeological Documentation Historical information gleaned from 1910 refit plans, construction diagrams in books, local accounts of salvage, and many photos helped to record and interpret the present features of the wreck. Archaeological documentation of the Massachusetts's remains, as well as a planned biological survey, were used to generate interpretive aids for those diving the site and those visiting the museum exhibit. The primary aid to interpreting the wreck was the creation of four maps--two site plans and two adaptations of the 1910 refit plans. Site maps of plan and profile views were drawn by underwater archaeological recording methods (Figures 4, 5 & 6). All work was accomplished without disturbing the site. Methods included establishing a baseline for triangulation and offset measurements. In addition, a temporary grid system was used to control video recording of the amidship sections, and an uncontrolled free swimming video was used to record features of the bow, the stern, and inside the turrets. On-site interpretation of disarticulated remains was facilitated by the 1910 refit plans, which detailed the last known alterations to the ship (Figure 7). Also, refit plans aided in drawing the hull outline and positioning the turrets. The 1910 refit plans proved invaluable in revealing how the Massachusetts appeared prior to its demise. Two drawings were outlined from the plans: one is a profile view, and the other is a composite view (Figures 5 & 6). The profile view was adapted with fewer technical features in order to give a sense of the original compartments and height. The composite plan depicted how the several decks now remaining on the wreck--orlop, berth, and platform decks--looked while the ship was operable. The purpose of the plans was to illustrate not only the remains of the wreck, but also to provide an historical context for the vessel. To achieve these goals, the maps were used in a land based exhibit along with photos and artifacts interpreting the site, and were also used in an underwater field guide. The guide aids visitors to the site, mainly divers and fisherman, by showing the size and shape of the ship, as well as the identity of the various pieces scattered about the site. It is to be hoped that those planning to dive the Massachusetts would visit the land based exhibit first to better understand the site and appreciate what they would encounter. Once knowledgeable about the site, the diver can relax, explore, and recognize the fragmented pieces by carrying the underwater guide and remembering the J4 other plans. In addition to viewing the structural features as parts of a ship, the diver can also view the wreck as a complex artificial reef supporting many varieties of marine life. Biological Documentation The recognition and interpretation of the site as a dynamic artificial reef increases the value of the site as an ecological resource. As the one of the oldest artificial reefs in the Pensacola area, the site is inhabited by many varieties of sea life. Permanent residents of the wreck include sponges, sea urchins, soft and hard corals, cowries, barnacles, gobies, jewfish, and octopus, among many others. Seasonal visitors include cigar minnows, Spanish and northern mackerel, cobia, blue angels, butterfly fish, and Zo many other tropical fish during the summer. in the winter, grunts and groupers appear, while year round denizens include spade fish, channel catfish, juvenile red snapper, and squirrel fish. Biological information printed on the underwater guide informs the diver, as well as the fisherman, about the types of marine life likely to be encountered on the artificial reef. 20 Public Proposal Following historical, archaeological, and biological documentation, work commenced to develop a public proposal for the Massachusetts to become the state's fourth underwater archaeological preserve. The proposal addressed reasons why the preserve status of the wreck would benefit the public in the areas of education, recreation, and tourism. The wreck is significant, not only locally, but also nationally. The Massachusetts represents the only surviving Indiana-class battleship in existence, and symbolizes a young America struggling to become a preeminent world naval power and achieve its manifest destiny. Since its deposition in the Pass in 1921, the wreck has provided fishermen and divers with continuous recreational opportunities. Pensacola over the years has fostered its historic and natural resources, such as Historic Seville District, Naval Aviation Museum, Gulf Islands National Seashore, and Naval Live Oaks Reservation, among others, and has developed an important tourist industry. Presently, divers in search of a location to visit want more than a pretty dive; they want a diverse attraction, featuring historical, recreational, and ecological elements. The Massachusetts, as the fourth Florida underwater archaeological preserve, contains all these elements. Adding the Massachusetts to Pensacola's existing cultural attractions offers additional incentives to visitors, and brings economic benefits to the city. To solicit input and support, two types of proposals for establishing a preserve were distributed. Copies of the bound 19-page proposal, with the four plans in a separate pocket, were sent to local government agencies, businesses, historical societies, and state agencies, as well as to national organizations such as the National Park Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy, and commemorative ship museums, among others. A handout of several pages was distributed to individuals requesting it, and was also made available during public presentations. The handouts ensured that those interested could read the proposal and re-discover the Massachusetts, not only as that old wreck in the Pass, but also as a new kind of tourist attraction. In fact, one local charter boat captain, who had previously salvaged metals from the ship, declared that he thought opportunities for making money off the Massachusetts had long since passed. Over the course of several weeks after making the proposal public, many people responded to the proposal, as well as to newspaper articles in the Pensacola News Journal and Gosport, by calling and writing to state their support for the idea. To promote the growing interest, the Bureau announced a public meeting open to interested national, state, and local government agencies, and to private businesses and individuals. The public meeting discussed how the state and public could cooperate in creating the fourth underwater archaeological preserve. One of the results of the meeting was the Bureau's commitment to assume the responsibilities of protecting and overseeing the park, and to print interpretive brochures and underwater guides to the site. The public became actively involved in promoting historical preservation at the local level by volunteering to help create the preserve. Public Support Organization To facilitate the creation of the park, a non-profit organization, the Friends of the Massachusetts, was formed to help with logistics. Donations of money and materials were received by this organization. Other components of the preserve, such as fabrication and placement of an underwater plaque, were also the responsibility of the Friends. The formation of various committees within the organization facilitated the completion of the many separate tasks. These committees included Historical, responsible for collecting historical material related to the ship; Museum, responsible for handling the shore based exhibit in a local museum; Mooring Buoys, responsible for placement and maintenance of mooring buoys for dive and fishing boats (the committee subsequently decided that mooring buoys were not required at the site); Plaque, charged to design and place a plaque; Diving, in charge of handling periodic cleanup of the site; Publicity, ensuring local newspapers and magazines were kept abreast of all developments in the park; and Funding, responsible for soliciting contributions for the funds needed for the preserve. Grand Opening A grand opening is planned for June 10, 1993, the centennial of the ship's launching. Local and visiting dignitaries from the governments of Pensacola and the State of Florida are expected to attend. 21 FLORIDA BUREAU OF ARC\"AEOLOGICAL RESEARCM SITE PLAN -a, C@- tl m CM& .. 4 N7Z@p. r.

Original 1910 Profile Plan-USS Massachusetts. wAw 29 Local businesses, such as dive shops, charter boat organizations, and bait and tackle shops, are planning to attend and show support. Extensive coverage by television and newspapers in the area will ensure publicity for the new park. One very special visitor will be the last surviving crew member of the Massachusetts, Chief Petty Officer (Ret.) Charles Brems. Although Mr. Brems is getting along in years and recovering from a stroke, his daughter states that he is excited about the designation of his old ship as a state park. Once the park is established, a local boat dealership is discussing the possibility of obtaining a glass-bottom boat to take visitors who are unable to dive to the Massachusetts. Already, local dive shops are reporting calls from as far away as Maine, Australia, and Guam from people who want to dive the Massachusetts. Conclusions The importance of preserving the USS Massachusetts as an underwater archaeological park is two - fold. First is the wreck's historical importance as the oldest, and only, surviving pre-dreadnaught battleship. It occupies a place in the history of the United States that cannot be filled by any other ship. Second is the wreck's status as one of the oldest artificial reefs in the area. The dynamic site supports a variety of sea life that draws divers and fishermen alike. Environmentally, the site is important as a spawning ground and fish hatchery. The establishment of underwater parks in Florida will continue as a tool for managing submerged cultural resources. In areas where parks have been established, local businesses have reported an increase in revenue. The parks bring tourists who spend money--not only in dive shops but also at motels, hotels, gas stations, and stores. Most important, an irreplaceable cultural resource, as well as a natural resource, has been preserved and will be protected for the enjoyment of generations to come. While the state may promote and assist in the establishment of an underwater archaeological preserve, the local community will determine the site's success or failure. Guidelines to effect a smooth nomination and creation process should always take into account the public attitude towards the site. Not all shipwrecks make good preserves; therefore, the state must be responsible in promoting worthy sites for inclusion in the underwater preserve system. Responsibility includes making sure the site is easily accessible, either by shore or boat, to ensure easy access for diving or snorkeling; assessing appropriate historical significance; and ensuring that enough structure remains to be recognizable as an historic site. In the Massachusetts' case, the state helped promote the public's acceptance of the concept by completing historical and archaeological research and initiating the first public meeting. Encouraging the public in this manner allowed those interested to support and implement the proposal and to help in creating the fourth underwater archaeological preserve in Florida. 0 30 0 0 c a z 31 CHAPTER 4. METHODOLOGY OF REMOTE SENSING SURVEYS Introduction Following the previous year's recommendations for more extensive remote sensing operations, and grant requirements for acquiring, assembling, and testing a remote sensing survey package, the Bureau of Archaeological Research purchased a magnetometer for use in Pensacola Bay. Later in the survey, the Bureau contracted for services of a side-scan sonar and operator to locate and identify sites. Armed with these archaeological prospecting tools, the Survey planned to cover promising locales for shipwreck sites. Areas chosen for investigation were selected on the basis of three kinds of criteria: past maritime activity, geographical considerations, and reported wreck sites. Past maritime activity sites include anchorages, careenage sites, and old wharves, while geographically important areas include sandbars, banks, and the shoreline. Locating reported wrecks often relied on the proverbial \"X marks the spot\" on nautical charts and also on individuals leading the crew to a site. Pensacola Bay has been the focus of maritime activities for more than 400 years, from the first Spanish colonial attempt in North America by de Luna to the present day. A broad spectrum of ships and boats have plied the bay's waters during these centuries, reflecting New World colonization attempts by the Spanish, French, and British, the efforts of the Confederacy to leave the Union, and the United States' struggle to become the pre-eminent world naval power. Fortunately, from the viewpoint of the underwater archaeologist, a vessel from each period in the historical development of Pensacola Bay is represented within the confines of the bay or adjacent waters. Also, remains of many activities associated with these vessels, including dumping debris at anchorages, anchor losses, careenages, and off-loading ballast, are strewn throughout the bay. Other related maritime sites include industrial complexes, the Quarantine Station, wharves, marine railways, and the naval station. Geographical considerations for the possible presence of shipwrecks inside the bay are limited to the shoreline and a few sandbars and banks. In a sheltered and protected water body like Pensacola Bay, the dangers of the open Gulf, such as heavy seas, are diminished. But Pensacola Bay can be whipped into a frenzied cauldron, as evidenced by the partial destruction of the de Luna fleet in 1559 and the vast destruction of merchant vessels in 1906 by hurricanes. The entire shoreline of the bay that lies along the transition line where deep water becomes shallow is likely to contain submerged cultural resources. Evidence of noteworthy shipwrecks along this transition line were two British colonial ships, the Deadman's and Town Point wrecks, found eroding out of the shoreline. Also, submerged shoals radiating out from Gulf Breeze Peninsula and near Pensacola Pass may have caused shipwrecks. - Several reports of wrecks were received during the course of the survey. Sometimes the person reporting the shipwreck personally took Survey staff to the location or provided Loran-C coordinate numbers for the site. In some instances a notation on a nautical chart indicated the shipwreck. In these cases remote sensing equipment provided the quickest means of obtaining the vessel's precise location. Magnetometer Survey Magnetometer Specifications An EG&G Geometrics Model G-866 Recording Proton Precession Magnetometer with towed array was the primary sensing tool. Essentially, the G-866 magnetometer records the earth's ambient magnetic field. The value of magnetometry to underwater archaeological survey work lies in its ability to detect disturbances in the earth's magnetic field created by objects ranging from iron pipes to rocks, and most importantly, shipwrecks. Typically, the marine magnetometer configuration involves deploying the sensor head behind the boat, while the console and readout are on board. The sensor head is towed far enough behind the boat that it is not affected by the boat's magnetic field- -typically a distance two to three times the length of the survey vessel. 32 Inside the sensor head is a metal coil immersed in a liquid--usually water, decane, or kerosene-- encased in a non-magnetic container. Left in an undisturbed state, the liquid's molecules will align themselves with the ambient magnetic field of the earth. However, when an electrical current is app"
