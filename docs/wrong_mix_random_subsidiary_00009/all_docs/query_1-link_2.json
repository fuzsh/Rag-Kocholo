        "text": "Veľký vrch Hilffort, Divinka\n\nThe fortification was built on the northern bank of the Váh, exactly above the flow of the Váh through the western edge of the Žilina basin. Of the known fortifications from the Roman period, the fortification in Divinka with the mentioned area of 12 hectares is the largest. Together with the presumed wooden walls (without embankment modifications), the total area of the Divinka fortification could have been as large as 100-150 hectares, making it one of the largest fortifications in Europe. There is evidence of an Old Slavic settlement only on the Veľký vrch (Big Hill) in Divinka. Here could have been the original tribal castle of the ancient Biess and later, in the pre-Great Moravian period, the main castle of the North Slavic tribe. The fortification was built already in the Hallstatt period (8th century BC). There are already traces of Eneolithic settlement (3300 years before Christ). On the southern slope of the Great Hill we know an artificially prepared terrace in two places, first a settlement terrace, but we have no finds from there.\n\nThe findings show that northern Slovakia in the Slavic and Great Moravian period was inhabited by a Slavic tribe with its tribal seat in Divinka on Veľký vrch. In addition to the fortification in Divinka, seven other fortifications from the same period have been found in the vicinity, most of them built on the right side of the Váh, thus forming a fortified line on the border with the Kysuce Mountains. The area inhabited by this tribe was characterised by burial in mounds. The burnt remains of the dead were deposited on the surface of the ground and covered with the mound. The tribe and its territory became a part of Great Moravia after its formation.\n\nAfter the demise of the Great Moravian Empire, this territory became for a certain period of time an independent territory, which was not under the influence of the emerging Kingdom of Hungary, although for short periods it came under the influence of the Kingdom of Poland or the emerging Kingdom of Bohemia. This territory was thus the only free remnant of Great Moravia in the Carpathian Basin.\n\nSome sources state that the whole area was probably already in the times of Great Moravia organized as a separate organizational unit (county) with its seat in Divinka with a regional and judicial office. The castle in Divinka, assuming its size was 150 ha, would have been one of the largest in Europe.\n\nSaint Clement Hillfort\n\nSt. Clement’s Mountain is one of the spiritual places deeply connected with the history of Moravia.\n\nThe first written records of this mountain, hidden in the silence of the vast Chřiby forests, date back only to the 14th century.\n\nAccording to the testimony of historical sources, this mountain was given centuries ago by King Rastislav to St. Constantine, Methodius and their disciples for a contemplative life. They found here a place for contemplation, prayer and work. A monastery and hermitage were built near the temple, and there was also a school, a centre of education and enlightenment. As the Life of Constantine, written under the direction of Archbishop Methodius himself, says: “When Saint Constantine came to Moravia, Rastislav received him with great reverence, and when he had gathered disciples, he gave them to him for teaching… And soon he translated the Church Order, and taught them the morning Divine Service, the hours, the evening, the Vespers and the Mass, and there he had other doctrines, grammar and music taught. And the ears of the deaf were opened, according to the words of the prophet, and they heard the words of the Scriptures, and the language of the harebrained was made plain …”\n\nThe Mount of St. Clement, placed under the protection of the Roman Pope and martyr, patron of the Thessalonian mission, St. Clement, whose remains were preserved there, was thus a centre of piety and learning. It was also here that the translation of the holy books was completed by St. Methodius in 884, and that a celebrated service was celebrated on the feast of St. Demetrius in thanksgiving for the grace and help granted.\n\nArchaeological excavations have shown that a brick chapel stood on this mountain in the 9th century in the Great Moravian period. Only Jindřich Wankl from the Patriotic Museum Association from Olomouc, who led excavations of the hillfort in 1885 – 1888 and who allegedly discovered the foundations of the monastery itself from the Cyril and Methodius period, mentions the 9th century living space adjacent to the chapel, but does not specify it any further.\n\nIn 1903-1905, the Brno postal official R. Čechmánek carried out excavations here and stated in connection with the living quarters that he found nothing except incomplete parts of the Augustinian monastery.\n\nHowever, R. Čechmánek discovered the common grave of seven individuals in the church nave and the skeletal remains of one individual in the chancel behind the altar, which were mainly passed off by local enthusiasts as the skeleton of Methodius.\n\nThe anthropological expertise carried out in 1950 by the Institute of Archaeology of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in Prague dated the old skeleton by Dr. J. Chochol to the 13th to 15th century. Thus, the myth of Methodius’ burial at St. Clement’s Fortress cannot be confirmed.\n\nFrom other interesting finds in this locality is the discovery of a golden solidus of Emperor Theophilus from the years 839 to 842 by a native of Koryčany, Vítězslav Gloza, in 1912.\n\nThere are threefold fortifications on the eastern side of St. Clement’s Mountain, which surround the 16-hectare fortification. On the acropolis are the foundations of a medieval church, which was built from the original 9th century chapel by the Brno Augustians after 1358, and which existed until 1421, when the monastic community was attacked by the Hussites from Strážnice. After this catastrophe, the spiritual life on St. Clement’s Mountain ceased. Around 1500, the knight Smetana of Osvětimany lived here as a hermit.\n\nThere is also a wooden chapel, built in 1964 by some Koryčany citizens under the leadership of P. Stanislav Straňák, in place of the original chapel from 1880, which stood in the chancel of the church foundation. There is also the bell tower of St. Gorazd, built in 1985 by members of the Community of St. Gorazd and Companions – Living Heritage. The Zeyer’s Well, located southeast at the foot of the mountain, has also been named after St. Gorazd since the same year.\n\nSource: www.korycany.cz\n\nZnojmo-Hradiště\n\nThe period before Great Moravia and the time of Great Moravia\n\nThe importance of the site grew in the period before Great Moravia, but the fortress reached its greatest prosperity during the times of Great Moravia. Then it became an important power centre of the whole south-western Moravia. Probably in the 9th century the area was newly fortified using the remains of the Late Bronze Age walls. The new fortification consisted of a ditch (up to 10 metres wide, 3.4 metres deep, in some places cut into the rock) and a massive wall with a wooden structure made of cross and longitudinal timbers. The wall had at least in some places a stone headwall. It also included log chambers measuring 3 × 3 metres. The entire fortified area covered an area of 20 hectares, making it one of the largest Great Moravian castles. It was divided into two halves by an inner wall and a moat – the western front castle and the inner castle in the eastern part of the site. The exact time of the construction of the wall has not yet been determined. Dendrodata recovered from the outer (western) wall speak for the period after 881, the inner wall was probably built earlier.\n\nOnly short parts of the rampart and the moat have been preserved to this day. Most of them have been destroyed over time by agricultural and construction activities, so that their course is almost imperceptible in the terrain. Only the southern and eastern sections of the inner castle fortification and a small part of the western wall of the forecourt are better preserved.\n\nThe overthrow of the hillfort by the Hungarians and the medieval period\n\nThe demise of the fortification probably dates back to around 906, when, according to late tradition, Hradiště was conquered and burnt by the Hungarians. The results of the archaeological survey also correspond to this. According to them, the fortress was destroyed in a great fire. The described event is dated to the first half of the 10th century by the discovery of jewels found together with an unburied female warrior under the collapsed body of the wall.\n\nEven after the overthrow by the Hungarians, the settlement of Hradiště persisted and the locality also retained its dominant position in the area. This was also the case after the annexation of Moravia to Přemyslid Bohemia. It was not until the end of the 11th century that a new, smaller castle was built nearby, on the opposite side of the Gránicky valley, by Prince Konrad I and his son Litold, on the outskirts of which the medieval town of Znojmo gradually emerged. The new Přemyslid castle took over the administrative function and the importance of Hradiště as a secular centre ceased. However, it remained a religious centre for a long time – the church in Hradiště is mentioned as the main “Znojmo church” in the documents of the Olomouc bishop Jindřich Zdík from the third of the 12th century, and a provost appointed by the ruler was stationed at the church. The Hradiště provosts became visible as royal chancellors when Znojmo was made a royal town (1222/1226). However, the function of the main town church was taken over by the Church of St. Nicholas and Hradiště was not included in the town location. In 1240 King Wenceslas I gave Hradiště to the Order of the Crusaders with the Red Star. They soon had the Great Moravian rotunda of St. Hippolytus rebuilt into a Gothic church. During the Hussite wars the priory was burnt down. Martin Medek of Mohelnice (1577-1581) and the mathematician and astrologer Mikuláš Kozař of Kozařov (1585-1616) were among the notable personalities who served as provost here.\n\nCastle in modern times\n\nThe provost’s office was conquered by Count Thurn during the Estates Uprising, who handed it over to the administration of William of Roupov, the highest provincial judge in Moravia. From the ashes of the Thirty Years’ War, Hradiště was brought out by the provost Gerhard of Sclessin and his nephew Thomas of Sclessin, both formerly apostolic Protestants, born in Lutych. In 1759, under the reign of Bishop Jan Jiří Hauer, Bishop Moritz Adolf of Saxe-Coburg died here, having taken refuge here during the Seven Years’ War. The money deposited for his stay (asylum) in the building of the presbytery enabled the Baroque reconstruction of the Church of St. Hippolytus with the invitation of the leading late-Baroque painter Franz Anton Maulbertsch.\n\nMolpír Hillfort, Smolenice – history\n\nAlready in 1890 and 1895 the Smolenice parish priest N. Sándorfi explored the location of Molpír on the eastern outcrop of the Small Carpathians. He found fortifications with three defensive walls, a prehistoric settlement, and investigated 23 graves of the Central Danube mound culture, mostly with mound embankments. The grave inventory already represents the classical mound culture, with a sword with a tongue-shaped hilt (type Smolenice – Szombor) and a needle with a seal-head. The research of the cairn was continued in 1970-72 by the Archaeological Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences (Siegrid Dušeková); she uncovered 15 cairns with 51 biritual graves; the urn and skeleton graves had numerous ceramic and bronze (razors, jewels, knives) additions, even gold wires were found. Several mounds and several finds from the pre-Moravian period date from the Slavic period.\n\nIn 1963-71, the Kalenderberg culture site was systematically investigated by Mikuláš Dušek (from 1967 with Siegrid Dušek). The whole site can be divided into three areas, two foreforts and an acropolis, with a total area of 12 hectares. The construction of the fortification was above average: the 2 m wide rampart had dry-laid stone walls on both sides, 0.5 m wide, with a stone-clay infill in the middle. The acropolis wall was reinforced with a wooden chamber structure, its stone gateway was reinforced with quadrilateral towers and protected from the side by an oval bastion.\n\nOnly the upper forecourt and the acropolis were inhabited; the houses, arranged in a street system, stood on artificial terraces. The acropolis was also built on the inner side along the fortifications. They were 6-10 m long, about 3 m wide, single, double and triple-roomed. They were built with a log construction on stone walls, the walls were plastered on both sides with clay, and the floor was similarly treated, sometimes laid with flat stones. Heating was provided by simple hearths and dome stoves. Outside the houses on the acropolis there were 6 ovens, probably under a wooden shelter, used for baking bread. Another furnace adjacent to one of the houses contained the remains of a smelting furnace and an iron magnifying glass – this is the oldest iron furnace in our area. There was also a cistern (35.5 x 5.5 x 1.5 m) carved into the rock on the acropolis, possibly serving another purpose (clay-washed walls). A cult place, the so-called temple, was carved into the rock (202 x 6 m). It contained three red-burned sacrificial altars, the skull and bones of a child of about 2 years of age, broken crescent-shaped idols and geometric idols in the form of weaver’s needle weights. Other evidence of the cult is a building sacrifice in the foundation of one house.\n\nThe economy of the settlement was based on handicraft production (besides ironwork (tools, weapons, knives) bronze casting (crucibles), production of stone hearths, weaving) and trade. The contact with the advanced South Hallstatt world is evidenced by boat-shaped clasps, needles, amber and glass beads, as well as imitations of bronze vessels in ceramics.\n\nThe demise of the fortress is related to the abundance of metal projectiles from both the inner and outer sides of the ramparts, but the only victim of the military conflict is a defender killed in the third gate. The attackers used the same missiles as the defenders. Thus, the destruction was not brought about by invaders from the east, but by internecine conflicts between domestic groups between 570-560 BC, probably related to the emerging nomadic culture in the Carpathian Basin, referred to as the Vekerzug culture. The first objects decorated in a different (beast) style, which are found in the youngest layers of the hillfort, are also echoes of its emergence.\n\nAt the site, the restoration and presentation of parts of the fortification, the gate, the cult object and the cistern have been carried out. Visitors are informed about the individual objects by the text on the boards forming part of the nature trail.\n\nSource: smolenice.com\n\nHillfort Mesciská, Pružina\n\nThe hillfort was discovered in the 19th century by the Slovak explorer Anton Intibus, who wrote about it in 1856. Further exploration was carried out in the late 1990s by Štefan Meliš. There are massive ramparts of the hillfort (two closed ramparts, separated by a deeper ravine). There are two fortifications with a total area of about 2.6ha (2.03ha and 0.58ha). The hillfort is located on a promontory of Svrčinovec hill /759.7m/ immediately above the village of Riedka at the confluence of the Strážovský and the White Brook in the cadastre of the village of Pružina.\n\nHillfort Mesciská I.\n\nThe larger of the two hillforts on the north-eastern side of the terrace, sloping gently to the north-west, has an outer circumference of 611m and an area of approximately 2.03ha. The hillfort consists of a massive continuous rampart (260m long, 3-4m wide at the crown and 1.5-7m high) on the north-west, south-west and south-east sides. There is also a lower mound (length 20m) in the northern outcrop of the hillfort. On the south-eastern side of the rampart is a shallow ditch (length 90m, width 0.8-1m). A smaller ditch also lines the rampart on the inner side in the western arch of the fortification (length 30m). The rest of the perimeter of the fort, about 330m long, is formed by the edge of a plateau with steep rocky slopes. The natural rampart is reinforced in several places by stone retaining walls. The fortification is interrupted in 4 places, these are probably entrance gates. There are three stepped terraces, probably an acropolis, in the south-eastern wooded part of the hillfort. There is a worked rock measuring about 3x2x0.7m near the south-western arch of the rampart, and it is likely that this was the site of a sacrificial burial ground.\n\nHillfort Mesciská II.\n\nThe area with a perimeter of 305m and an area of about 0.58ha. It lies in the south-west outcrop of the terrace. The division of the hillfort into two parts was probably caused by the configuration of the terrain (gusts of water from the northern slope of Svrčinovec probably disturbed the mound. The flat upper surface of the hillfort was built artificially. It is protected from the west and north-west by steep rock slopes, the north-eastern side was earthen and is therefore now spread out into a gentle slope. On the south-eastern side, the plateau is protected by a substantial mound (70m long, 3-4m wide and 1-1.5m high), terminated on the western side by a projection (probably a tower or gate). Behind it, a road clearly emerges from the corner of the hillfort. There is a similar projection in the opposite corner of the fortification above the pothole separating the hillforts.\n\nSeveral sherds from the 9th century (Slavic from the period of Great Moravia), but also sherds from the Púchov culture from the late Ladenian period have been found on the hillforts. The existence of production facilities is assumed here (finds of iron slag at the eastern rampart near the eastern gate of the fortification). As the probing of the fortification failed to reveal a cultural layer, it is assumed that it is probably a refugium (a fortress built by the Slavs – or rebuilt in the early Middle Ages to give them a place to hide from the enemy in times of danger).\n\nSource: krizom-krazom.eu\n\nMajcichov\n\nIn 2006, the municipality of Majcichov commemorated the 740th anniversary (1266) of its first written mention, although its existence dates back to 35 000 years B.C. For this anniversary, the municipality published a book by Adriana Račková – Traditions and Songs from Majcichov and a commemorative plaque to the local dean and parish priest, Konstantin Hurban, was unveiled at the local grocery store, COOP Jednota.\n\nArchaeological findings indicate that prehistoric man lived in the area of present-day Majcichov as early as the Early Stone Age ( 35 000 – 8 000 years B.C. ). In the literature, the hillfort of Majcichov from the Early Stone Age ( 5 000 – 3 000 B.C. ) is more often mentioned. In this context, the settlement of the people with the culture of volute pottery is mentioned. The most frequent traces of ancestors of Majcichov people are found in the Bronze Age (from 1900 – 700 BC), it is the Lusatian and Velatian culture. In the older Iron Age (from 700 – 300 BC) there is a known settlement south of Majcichov, already in the cadastre of the municipality of Hoste, in the locality of Malý háj (Little Grove). At the turn of the 5th and 6th century AD, Slavs settled here. The preserved traces include a settlement with Prague-type pottery.\n\nFrom the 9th century there is a known Great Moravian protective hillfort in Majcichov from the local part of Palaj to the Vlčkovský grove, which had an area of 3 ha. Archaeological research of this hillfort was carried out by the Institute of Archaeology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Nitra in the 1960s and at the beginning of the 21st century. Researches claim that the area could be as large as 9 ha. The hillfort was located at an important trade crossroads. It is very likely that Majcichov already existed in this period under the name of Majtech as a small settlement on the local upper street below the church today. A watchtower probably stood on the site of the church. A whole network of service settlements was formed around the Majcichov settlement. In this period, the Majcichov inhabitants embraced Christianity, which was also consolidated by the old Hungarians within the Hungarian state after the settlement’s demise, as evidenced again by the many Hungarian names – Farkašín (Vlčkovce), Majthény (Majcichov)\n\nAlthough Majcichov together with the church is documented in writing from 1266 as evidenced by the minutes of the Nitra Chapter (stored in Hungary in the Nitra archive, from the above it is certain that the village existed much earlier)\n\nThe life of Majcichov was influenced by the Elephanthy family from Lefantiovce near Nitra, King Sigismund of Luxemburg, the Thurz family, Františl Ujlaky- Bishop of Rába, the Wofgang family, the Báthory family, the Stupava estate, the Szegédivo family (they built a lighthouse and four large cellars on the place where the KD stands today), Stiavnica manor, Bencsics, Gudics, Abrahámfy, Farkas, Esterházi (from their period there was an early manor house, which was demolished due to its unsatisfactory condition), Szegeli (they gave the monstrance to the church, the emperor to the chapel in the cemetery, which is from 1697). In the Jan Palárik Memorial Room there is a painting representing the so-called Peace of Majcichov, which symbolises the end of the Imperial-Curonian Wars.\n\nFrom the first half of the 18th century, the crypts of the Andreanskis and Szegedi family are located under the church. In the 18th century, the Andraszi family were among the owners of the municipality (statue of St. Barbara 1750, cross in front of the church 1747).\n\nSource: www.majcichov.sk\n\nBranč Castle – history\n\nIn the southeast of the castle is the location of the Old Castle, where there is a hillfort, which apparently disappeared after the construction of Branč Castle in the 13th century. The exact dating of the hillfort is not clear. It was already inhabited in the Middle Eneolithic by the culture with channeled pottery, later in the Lusatian culture, and also in the 8th to 9th centuries.\n\nThe ruins of Branč Castle are located on the hill of the same name in the Myjava Hills above Podzámok, a local part of the village of Podbranč. The oldest written mention dates back to 1317. The castle covers an area of about 7,500 m2, at an altitude of 480 m above sea level. As the castle stood on a relatively easily accessible hill, its defences were constantly improved. The main entrance to the lower castle is from the east. The entrance to the castle was guarded by two bastions of outer fortifications. Opposite the main entrance is the three-quarter gun bastion of the middle castle, protecting the entrance area from the enemy by firing cannons and small arms. The perimeter walls of the lower castle are interrupted in four places by semicircular bastions.\n\nThe castle is divided into two main parts: the lower castle and the middle castle. The middle castle is separated from the lower castle by a distinctly dry deep moat, which increased the natural height of the fortifications of the middle castle. The entrance to the middle castle was originally in the corner (opposite the monument). Even where the ground was level (where there was no moat, but the ground was covered by the fall of the upper and middle castle), the attackers had to cross 80 m of uncovered space (the moat) under direct fire from the castle defenders.\n\nThe middle castle is functionally divided into 2 parts: the northern courtyard of the middle castle and the residential palace part. From the courtyard (by the monument) a staircase led up to the atrium courtyard and to the individual rooms. There were 40 rooms – 15 on the ground floor, 20 on the first floor and 5 on the second floor. There was a castle well in the western courtyard of the lower castle (near the monument). There was also an older well in the courtyard of the middle castle (near the only accessible room).\n\nThe castle was built by Magister Aba of Hlohovec between 1251 – 1297. This dating was determined by archaeological research – according to the discovery of coins with the years 1251 – 1261. In the following years the castle changed 40 owners. In 1309 the castle was acquired by Matúš Čák Trenčiansky, for a short period of time the castle was also owned by the Czech King John of Luxemburg, in 1394 by Sigismund of Luxemburg. After this year, the reconstruction of the middle castle dates back to the same year. The result was a typical Gothic rock castle with an assault tower, palace, chapel and in the south-eastern corner of the central castle a high fortified perimeter wall.\n\nIn the 16th century, the castle became the property of František Nyáry, who married the daughter of the castle lord Korlátko (Cerová), and the last members of the Nyáry family lived there with the whole family, who built a new manor house in Sobotiště (on the square) and gradually moved there with the furnishings. It was a more comfortable residence for them. The castle remained abandoned and fell into disrepair. During the Turkish wars it served as a refuge for the surrounding population, and in the period 1674-1675 it was a temporary prison for Protestant priests who were sentenced to galleys by the Bratislava court. They died in the pits (prison around the perimeter of the wall). This event is commemorated by a memorial and annual services at the castle.\n\nAs the castle was abandoned, it was easily attacked and burned by the Turks and the castle remains so to this day.\n\nIn 1968 Pamiatkostav Žilina carried out a monument restoration of the castle, which was not completed. Archaeological research has been carried out since 1978. During five seasons, in the uncovered buried rooms, in the individual layers, articles of stone architecture from windows, doors were found; furthermore, shards of majolica, pots and stoves were found. Interesting finds included a decorative stone Renaissance cornice with a shield bearing the date of the completion of the castle reconstruction in 1539 and the monogram of the castle’s owner, František Nyáry. Furthermore, a set of pillars, wooden parts from the original castle, an iron arrow, 2 bullets, an old knife, bronze needles, various kinds of buttons, fittings, a key from a jewellery box and a copper cedi were found.\n\nBenedictine monastery in Rajhrad\n\nThe Benedictine monastery in Rajhrad is the oldest monastery in Moravia and one of the oldest Moravian religious institutions. According to legend, a Basilian monastery, founded by St. Cyril, should have existed here as early as the 10th century. In 1045, the Bohemian prince Břetislav I gave the Břevnov monastery an abandoned castle called Rajhrad and founded the monastery (cella) of Saints Peter and Paul there. Three years later, on 26 November 1048, the cella was transformed into a real monastery, which was subordinated to the Abbey of Brevnov.\n\nThe monastery, founded on the site of a Greco-Moravian fortress perhaps as early as the 8th century, was plundered many times in the following centuries. In 1311, King John of Luxembourg and Duke Friedrich of Austria visited the monastery. During the Hussite storms, monks from many destroyed monasteries took refuge in Rajhrad.\n\nThe monastery retained its Romanesque appearance until the beginning of the 18th century, but the condition of the buildings was unsatisfactory. Therefore, the then provost Antonín Pirmus undertook a complete and generous reconstruction. In 1718, Pirmus, known as the second founder of the monastery, entrusted the design work to Jan Blažej Santini Aichl, who designed four quadrants surrounding the church of Saints Peter and Paul: a prelature, a convent and two farmyards. In 1722 the construction of the church began, the convent buildings were in use from 1755 and the whole complex was completed in 1840.\n\nThe importance of the monastery grew throughout the Middle Ages. In 1234, Margrave Premysl granted the monastery substantial freedoms. King John of Luxembourg granted the monastery’s superiors the right of throat in 1327 and Charles IV confirmed Břetislav’s privileges. From 1540 the abbots of Rajhrad sat in the Moravian Provincial Assembly. The right of pontificalia was granted to the provosts by Pope Inocent IX in 1687 and since then they were allowed to wear a mitre, cross, ring and scepter. The monks of Rajhrad achieved total independence in 1813, when the abbey was elevated to the status of an abbey by Emperor Francis I.\n\nThe Benedictine monastery of Rajhrad gradually became a renowned centre of learning. Already in the 14th century, the abbot John II and the monk Peter, who also drew beautiful initials, stood out in literature. Many manuscripts were left behind by Prior Leo (+1419), Prior Placentinus (+1638), Prior Celestin Arlet (+1683) and many others. The greatest growth of the monastery took place in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it became famous for its expanding library and for the scientific activities of Bonaventura Pitre – the confessor of Maria Theresa, Dr. Gregory Volny, Dr. Beda Dudik, Dr. Maurus Kinter and other educated Benedictines of Rajhrad.\n\nThe entire 20th century was almost devastating for the Benedictines, but the darkest period for the monastery came shortly after the communist takeover. On the night of 13-14 April 1950, all the male religious orders in the country were raided by the People’s Militia and StB units as part of “Action K”. The religious were interned and their property was forfeited to the state. Various units of the Czechoslovak People’s Army then took turns in the Benedictine monastery in Rajhrad.\n\nIn 1990, the devastated buildings were returned to the order, which, with the support of many institutions, funds and donors, is gradually reconstructing the entire complex. In 2005, the Memorial of Literature in Moravia was opened here, which manages the famous Benedictine library with 65,000 volumes of books. The monastery is coming back to life after a forty-year hiatus and thus continues the almost thousand-year history of the Benedictine community in Rajhrad.\n\nBasilica of the Virgin Mary of the Seven Sorrows Šaštín-Stráže – history\n\nŠaštín is old-famous in the history of Slovak nation and its history dates back to the arrival of our faithful saints Cyril and Methodius to the old homeland of the Slovaks. It was an important fortress for the protection of trade routes at the crossroads of the Danube, Bohemian and Znojmo roads. The name of the castle and the settlement comes from the words “Šášie” and “Tín” – which means: castle of cut trees. It was built by the river Myjava, in marshy terrain. The castle was the seat of the county governors and the archdeaconate – representatives of the bishop. The Šaštín archdeaconate administered the deaconates from Moravský Ján to Čachtice. Thus, Šaštín was always the seat of both the dean and the archdeacon, who resided in the castle. The first church – the castle chapel – was probably located there. The first written mention is from 1204, when Imrich II gave the Győr family a property named “Sassin”. Later, the property was acquired by Imrich Czobor I. His son Imrich Czobor II settled here permanently. From the castle, sentries were sent out, guards, so called. Spekulatores were sent out to guard the roads and report dangers.\n\nHistory of the basilica\n\nThe veneration of the Virgin Mary of the Seven Sorrows among the Slovaks began with the adoption of Christianity by the faithful saints Cyril and Methodius. The people built chapels and temples in her honour. Similarly, near Šaštín, near the castle, a picture of the Mother of God hung on a tree.\n\n1564 – The beginning of pilgrimage. In this year Angelika Bakičová, the wife of Count Imrich Czobor, the owner of the Šaštín estate, had a statue of the Seven Sorrows made as a fulfillment of a promise to hear her in her family’s troubles. Angelica asked for the help of the Seven Sorrows for her image. The statue was placed for public veneration in the triangular chapel that stands there to this day.\n\n1654 – During the Turkish Wars, the statue of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows was taken to a nearby castle and kept in the chapel of St. Imrich. Here it remained until the beginning of the 18th century.\n\n1710 – The statue was placed in the chapel again. It was greatly venerated by the people and many miraculous healings of body and soul took place. Therefore, an investigation into them was started.\n\n1732 – On 25 August, the statue was transferred to the Loreto chapel near the church in the square. The Archbishop of Esztergom, Imrich Eszterházy, appointed a commission of inquiry headed by the canon of Esztergom, Juraj Agnelý, a native of Šastina. The commission examined 726 miraculous cases, which were reinvestigated by the commission in Bratislava. – On 10 November, in the presence of many clergymen and 20,000 pilgrims, the statue was solemnly declared miraculous and reinstalled in the triangular chapel. At that time, Holy Mass was celebrated for the first time at this place. The statue was entrusted to the care of the parish priest of Šastina, Ján Schon.\n\n1733 – The provincial of the Pauline Order, František Rosa, forced the statue to come under their care. The Paulines came to Šaštín on 2 April. They undertook to build a pilgrimage church and a monastery.\n\n1736 – 16 July, the foundation stone was consecrated. Construction work began under the direction of Jan Damiani, a builder from Vienna. Later the construction was led by Matej Vépy.\n\n1748 – The building and the roof over the church were completed and in 1751 the monastery was roofed.\n\n1757 – The church was painted by Jean Joseph Chamant with beautiful frescoes on the ceiling and above the side altars.\n\n1760 – The interior decoration of the church continues according to the design of Franz Anton Hildebrant, the imperial builder, who also designed the construction of the red marble high altar and the entire façade of the church. The entire construction was financed from the collections of the common people and with the contribution of Empress Maria Theresa.\n\n1762 – On 12 August, in the presence of Archbishop Barkóczy of Esztergom, Empress Maria Theresa and her husband Francis of Lorraine, many clergy and thousands of pilgrims, the consecration of the church took place, and on 15 August the statue was solemnly transferred to the high altar.\n\n1765 – the bells on the towers, which only reached the height of the roof and were topped with spires, were consecrated.\n\n1771 – An organ with 25 variations and a pulpit were built. Gradually the side altars of marble were built, except for one. The altarpieces were painted by Ján Lukáč Kracker.\n\n1786 – Emperor Joseph II. Abolished the Pauline monastery, of which there were 17 in Šaštín. They went to Poland. The church came under the administration of the parish priest of Šaštín – dean Jakub Schneider and four chaplains. The old parish church in Šaštín was closed. The rectory was moved to a part of the monastery, which became an imperial property.\n\n1864 – The celebration of the three hundredth anniversary of the veneration of the statue of the Seven Sorrows in Šaštín took place. Earlier, the dean Štefan Hrebíček undertook to complete the two towers to their present height. The construction was carried out by the Hodonín builder Jozef Bárta. The crosses on the towers were ceremoniously hoisted on 26 June 1864. On 8 September, a great ceremony took place during which the Archbishop of Esztergom, Cardinal Ján Scitovský, crowned the statue with gold crowns, which were consecrated by Pope Pius IX. The ceremony was attended by 300 clergymen and over 120 thousand pilgrims.1902 – Dean Jozef Maria Škarda, on the occasion of the arrival of the Emperor to Šaštín to complete the manoeuvres, had the church restored.\n\n1914 – during World War I, the bells were taken from the towers, except for the smallest one.\n\n1924 – On 8 September, by the decision of the Bishop of Trnava, Dr. Paul Jantausch, the Salesians – sons of Don Bosco – came to Šaštín. They repaired the old parish church on the square, which had been a granary for 150 years. They dedicated it to their founder, St. John Bosco.\n\n1926 – On October 31, 1926, 4 large bells were consecrated.\n\n1927 – On April 22, the Holy Father Pius XI. On May 22, he solemnly proclaimed it in the presence of 3 bishops and 40 thousand pilgrims.1928 – was the consecration of the great national bell of the Seven Sorrows, the weight of which is 4.745 kg.\n\n1929 – Electric lighting was introduced into the church and the monastery.\n\n1941 – 43 – The sanctuary and the whole building were repaired. The Viennese Slovaks donated a sculptural Stations of the Cross. After completion, they also ordered an extension of the organ.\n\n1950 – On 14 April the Salesians were forcibly expelled from Šaštín and the administration passed into the hands of the diocesan priests. In the autumn the organ was finished, which now has 120 registers, 5 manuals, three playing desks and 5500 pipes. Pilgrims continued to visit the pilgrimage church despite the obstacles.\n\n1964 – during the 400-year veneration of the statue, at the request of Bishops Dr. Ambrose Lazik and Dr. Eduard Néczey, the Pope Paul VI elevated the Shrine of the Seven Sorrows by the decree “Ad perpetuam rei memoriam” of 23 November to a minor basilica. The solemn proclamation took place on 27 December in the presence of Bishop Lazik of Trnava, many clergy and faithful.\n\n1968 – 70 – The Salesian Fathers administer the parish again – they introduce a new sound system, electric bells and build a makeshift altar to the people.\n\n1975 – Vdp. Parish priest Karol Senasi had a new marble altar to the people built, which was consecrated by Bishop Dr. Július Gábriš, a great Marian worshipper and annual pilgrim to the Seven Sorrows.\n\n1987 – Marian Year – the basilica was visited by Mother Teresa of Calcutta and the new Bishop of Trnava, the current Archbishop Metropolitan of Slovakia Mons. Ján Sokol. Under the leadership of the local parish priest Jan Baša, the overhaul of the basilica began.\n\n1990 – At the end of February the Salesians come again to Šaštín and under the leadership of the parish priest-deacon Jan Malženický the repair of the basilica continues, on March 9th he takes over a part of the monastery and already on March 9th he takes over a part of the monastery and on March 9th he takes over the monastery. On 22 April, while travelling by helicopter, the Holy Father John Paul II especially greeted the Seven Sorrows by circling over the basilica and promised to come on pilgrimage during his homily. This was followed by the Holy Week pilgrimage at the turn of May and June, attended by a large number of faithful; the culmination of the pilgrimage season was the great pilgrimage on the feast of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows – the Patroness of Slovakia, when the entire façade was already without scaffolding.\n\n1991 – Then the renovation works continued inside the basilica: new electrical installation, new sound system, modification of the altar and presbytery, modification of the sacristy, purposeful tempering of the basilica, restoration of the pavement and completion of the Marian museum at the basilica. Most costly, however, was the cleaning and revitalization of the beautiful Chamant frescoes and the entire interior of the Basilica. The last scaffolding was cleared from the Basilica before the National Pilgrimage in September 2005.\n\nIn the building of the monastery, the ecclesiastical Catholic boys’ boarding Gymnasium of John Bosco was (re)founded.1995 (1 July) – Šaštín and the Basilica were visited by Pope Blessed John Paul II, during his second pastoral visit to Slovakia.\n\nResource: bazilika.sk\n\nOpen-Air Museum in Modrá – history\n\nHand-kneaded fired pottery with coarse grain, with lines and nail incisions, as well as later pottery made of floating clay on a potter’s wheel have been found in the village. The most important archaeological discovery, however, is the first unearthing of the remains of a Great Moravian stone building on our territory. The excavations were carried out here since 1911 by Dr. Jan Nevěřil, professor of the Faculty of Divinity. Under his direction, the foundations of a small church with a rectangular, elongated chancel and 4 supports in the nave were uncovered. Initially, it was attributed to Cyril and Methodius, which was rejected in scientific circles, but only after 40 years it was definitely proven that it was the first brick church from the times of Great Moravia.\n\nArchaeological research\n\nThese findings were brought about by the revision archaeological research initiated in 1953 by Dr. Vilém Hrubý. This research not only refined the report on the site, but also uncovered a small cemetery of 36 skeleton graves, the character of which fully corresponds to the knowledge of Great Moravian burial sites. All of the graves avoided the church walls, suggesting that the burial site was created when the church was already standing. The oldest almsgivings in the graves date from the 9th century, so there is no doubt that the building was already standing in the first half of this century, i.e. still in the pre-Cyril-Methodian period.\n\nIt is a single-nave church with a rectangular nave with 4 built-in supports and a rectangular chancel measuring about half the length and width of the nave. The entrance to the chancel may have been partially blocked by a short partition, the floor paved with smaller stones hewn together. The stone walls, rendered grey-brown on the outside and multi-coloured on the inside, originally had a flat wooden ceiling. The different recesses of the foundations suggest that the nave was of greater height than the rectangular choir. Overall, it can be concluded that the form was influenced by the missionary current from the west.\n\nAround the eastern part of the church, stake holes were found – traces of fencing or a hint of an older, perhaps also ecclesiastical building. To the northeast and southeast lay the cemetery, which had served its purpose for about 100 years. The discovery of knives in 10 graves suggests that the deceased belonged to the free, perhaps even privileged, class.\n\nAfter the demise of Great Moravia\n\nIt can be assumed that after the end of Great Moravia, the hill near Modrá was deserted, because a document from the beginning of the 13th century speaks of the church of St. John, which later disappeared, but which stood deserted and empty near Velihrad, on a farm donated by Margrave Vladislav Henry to the Cistercians as a provision until the construction of the Velehrad monastery. At the end of the 17th century, an engraving by Kristian Hirschmentzel, a member of the Velehrad convent, depicts a small chapel, strikingly consistent with the reconstruction of the foundations. Given the discovery of a 17th-century coin in the excavation area, it can be assumed that this is an identical chapel; it can also be assumed that it is the chapel of St. John, associated with the foundation of the Velehrad monastery.\n\nSource: cs.wikipedia.org\n\nAdministrative – entrance part\n\nIt consists of a set of interconnected buildings, dominated by two defensive towers with a gate, which house a ticket office and a small souvenir shop. The other buildings consist of a light palisade, a stage for various cultural performances, fast food and administrative buildings. All of them are built in the spirit of the building culture and architecture known from the early medieval period, so they do not disturb the historical framework of the experience area.\n\nFortification part\n\nrepresent two types of fortifications that formed part of the fortification system of one of the centres of Great Moravia, Veligrad. They were found during excavations in Staré Město and Uherské Hradiště. The light type of fortification is a timber-clay wall with a frontal palisade, while the heavy type is a newly built massive wall with a frontal stone wall and a palisade superstructure. Without such fortifications, the ancient Moravians could hardly have resisted the attacks of their enemies.\n\nResidential and economic area\n\nshows what the appearance of dwelling houses, sunken dwellings and farm buildings of various types was like and gives a glimpse into their modestly furnished interiors. It may come as a surprise to learn that the dwellings were mainly used during the harsh winters, and that during the other months they were mainly lived in front of, outside. The domestic animals, such as goats, pigs, chickens and geese, and even donkeys, that are kept in the barns and roam freely among the visitors, are an integral part of the attraction.\n\nProduction area\n\nrepresents a separate settlement unit consisting of the workshops of a jewellery manufacturer, i.e. a jeweller, a potter, a blacksmith and an iron metallurgist or a metalworker. In the 9th century, these industries reached a significant level of specialisation and excellence, which was reflected in all spheres of life of the inhabitants of Moravia at that time. At all events for schools and the public, the workshops, like other buildings, are staffed by real craftsmen dressed in the traditional dress who bring to life the old production techniques.\n\nThe area of power\n\nforms the visual dominant of the open-air museum. Its centre is the stone palace of the Great Moravian princes as a representative of the top level of architecture of Great Moravia. Every year, various cultural activities take place in its interior, such as thematic exhibitions on the early medieval history of Moravia. The palace is complemented by a kitchen and a high defensive tower that can be climbed. In doing so, you can get an idea of the extent of the Modra archaeological site, the largest in our territory, and see the nearby Velehrad Monastery and the Chřiby Triple Peak with Buchlov Castle.\n\nReligious and educational area\n\nit consists of three detached buildings, the main one being a long wooden structure divided into several parts. Originally, it probably represented the dwelling of an important priest, perhaps Archbishop Methodius himself, his pupils and colleagues, as well as a place where they learned to read and write in Glagolitic and were educated in the Holy Scriptures. The complex also includes a small brick rotunda with a baptistery function, and a hall-type church – a hypothetical reconstruction of the Church of St. John – standing in the immediate vicinity of the open-air museum, near the original site of the discovery of its foundations.\n\nVineyard and wine-growing area\n\nrepresents one of the newest parts of the open-air museum, which currently consists of a recently planted vineyard containing old grape varieties known in the medieval times, such as Červenošpičák, Mlynářka, Tramín bílý, Muškát žlutý… The vineyard was created in cooperation with the municipality of Modrá, Modra winemakers and experts from the Institute of Viticulture and Enology of Mendel University in Lednice. Wine and Great Moravia are concepts that link the past and the present into one very interesting whole for visitors.\n\nSource: www.archeoskanzen.cz\n\nBranč Castle – history\n\nIn the southeast of the castle is the location of the Old Castle, where there is a hillfort, which apparently disappeared after the construction of Branč Castle in the 13th century. The exact dating of the hillfort is not clear. It was already inhabited in the Middle Eneolithic by the culture with channeled pottery, later in the Lusatian culture, and also in the 8th to 9th centuries.\n\nThe ruins of Branč Castle are located on the hill of the same name in the Myjava Hills above Podzámok, a local part of the village of Podbranč. The oldest written mention dates back to 1317. The castle covers an area of about 7,500 m2, at an altitude of 480 m above sea level. As the castle stood on a relatively easily accessible hill, its defences were constantly improved. The main entrance to the lower castle is from the east. The entrance to the castle was guarded by two bastions of outer fortifications. Opposite the main entrance is the three-quarter gun bastion of the middle castle, protecting the entrance area from the enemy by firing cannons and small arms. The perimeter walls of the lower castle are interrupted in four places by semicircular bastions.\n\nThe castle is divided into two main parts: the lower castle and the middle castle. The middle castle is separated from the lower castle by a distinctly dry deep moat, which increased the natural height of the fortifications of the middle castle. The entrance to the middle castle was originally in the corner (opposite the monument). Even where the ground was level (where there was no moat, but the ground was covered by the fall of the upper and middle castle), the attackers had to cross 80 m of uncovered space (the moat) under direct fire from the castle defenders.\n\nThe middle castle is functionally divided into 2 parts: the northern courtyard of the middle castle and the residential palace part. From the courtyard (by the monument) a staircase led up to the atrium courtyard and to the individual rooms. There were 40 rooms – 15 on the ground floor, 20 on the first floor and 5 on the second floor. There was a castle well in the western courtyard of the lower castle (near the monument). There was also an older well in the courtyard of the middle castle (near the only accessible room).\n\nThe castle was built by Magister Aba of Hlohovec between 1251 – 1297. This dating was determined by archaeological research – according to the discovery of coins with the years 1251 – 1261. In the following years the castle changed 40 owners. In 1309 the castle was acquired by Matúš Čák Trenčiansky, for a short period of time the castle was also owned by the Czech King John of Luxemburg, in 1394 by Sigismund of Luxemburg. After this year, the reconstruction of the middle castle dates back to the same year. The result was a typical Gothic rock castle with an assault tower, palace, chapel and in the south-eastern corner of the central castle a high fortified perimeter wall.\n\nIn the 16th century, the castle became the property of František Nyáry, who married the daughter of the castle lord Korlátko (Cerová), and the last members of the Nyáry family lived there with the whole family, who built a new manor house in Sobotiště (on the square) and gradually moved there with the furnishings. It was a more comfortable residence for them. The castle remained abandoned and fell into disrepair. During the Turkish wars it served as a refuge for the surrounding population, and in the period 1674-1675 it was a temporary prison for Protestant priests who were sentenced to galleys by the Bratislava court. They died in the pits (prison around the perimeter of the wall). This event is commemorated by a memorial and annual services at the castle.\n\nAs the castle was abandoned, it was easily attacked and burned by the Turks and the castle remains so to this day.\n\nIn 1968 Pamiatkostav Žilina carried out a monument restoration of the castle, which was not completed. Archaeological research has been carried out since 1978. During five seasons, in the uncovered buried rooms, in the individual layers, articles of stone architecture from windows, doors were found; furthermore, shards of majolica, pots and stoves were found. Interesting finds included a decorative stone Renaissance cornice with a shield bearing the date of the completion of the castle reconstruction in 1539 and the monogram of the castle’s owner, František Nyáry. Furthermore, a set of pillars, wooden parts from the original castle, an iron arrow, 2 bullets, an old knife, bronze needles, various kinds of buttons, fittings, a key from a jewellery box and a copper cedi were found.\n\nSource: podbranc.sk\n\nSt. Methodius Heights, Uherské Hradiště – history\n\nThe site itself is located in the southeastern part of the town of Uherské Hradiště called Sady, near the road in the direction of Kunovice, on the so-called Sady promontory. In 1959-1963, under the direction of V. Hruby (from the Moravian Museum in Brno) an archaeological excavation, during which the remains of an unfortified court of ecclesiastical and power character were discovered.\n\nIt was here that some of the first Christian missionaries arrived sometime in the late 8th century. They came from Aquileia on the Adriatic coast and from Salzburg, and a little later from Passau. Probably with the knowledge of the local prince, they built a church on the Sady promontory, which may have taken the form of a cross above ground, with a massive square tower rising above the centre. The church was plastered, painted, had a poured mortar floor and was covered with a roof made of clay components. This architecture certainly dominated the wider surroundings. It was built sometime between the 8th and 9th centuries, more than 30 years before the foundation of Great Moravia (836). It was one of the first brick churches north of the Danube.\n\nSacral buildings\n\nThe complex of several brick religious buildings, built in three construction phases, occupied a dominant, far visible position. The church was first built in the first third of the 9th century on the plan of a Greek cross. To the west, a hall church with an apse-shaped roof was added in the 1960s and 1970s. This is sometimes interpreted as a chapel with two side entrances and its origin is probably linked to the newly arrived builders of the Byzantine mission. Probably in the third quarter of the 9th century, a tomb chamber and a chapel were added to the northern perimeter wall of the church with a cruciform layout, while the same phase is also attributed to the creation of a brick partition in the western church. In this context, the possibility arises that the western church became a place of instruction for catechumens, while the chapel with the burial chamber was used for the burial of a prominent Moravian (probably the grave of Prince Svatopluk). A baptistery was built to the west of the complex.\n\nArchaeological research\n\nOutside, but also inside the church buildings, 87 burials from the 9th century were uncovered, often in coffins and with rich alms. The cemetery area with the church was separated on the north side by two walls from a cluster of twelve log buildings, where craftsmen and their families lived and worked in workshops. There was also a well. On the opposite side stood a large 36 m long and 6 m wide log structure – a meeting place and perhaps a place of instruction for the priests. A paved road ran between the precincts. Due to the overall situation at the St. Methodius’ Height (Sadská výšina), as well as to the finds from here – a lead cross with a Greek liturgical inscription, styli, etc. – the site is often associated with the workplace of the representatives of the Byzantine mission.\n\nAccording to the evidence of grave finds, the original Great Moravian burial ground from the 9th and early 10th centuries was later overlain by young burials from the 11th-12th centuries. The chapel, which is attributed with Marian consecration on the basis of a written source from 1247, was finally abandoned together with the cemetery during the 13th century.\n\nSource: www.slovackemuzeum.cz\n\nChurch of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Terchová – history\n\nFrom the second half of the 1930s, the municipality felt an acute need for a larger and more spacious church. A young priest, Stefan Bitter, finally came up with a concrete idea. After raising funds and digging the foundations, the cornerstone of the new church building was laid in 1942. By the fall of 1944, the church building was already built, plastered and covered with shingles. Early the next spring, however, the cruel whirlwind of war raged. 155 dwelling houses, including the parish building, lay in ashes (April 8-9, 1945). The rough church building offered shelter to the victims.\n\nAfter the completion of the construction, the main altar was built. The altar is surmounted by a massive cross with the Crucified as a part of it. There are two rows of 23 symmetrically arranged pews in the main nave . The three aisles are separated from each other by massive round columns. The ceiling of the main nave is coffered, the side aisles have flat ceilings. All three bells have been transferred from the old church of St. Martin. The oldest and largest, George, is original, dating back to the first half of the 18th century. The other two are of younger date.\n\nThe solemn consecration of the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius took place on 8 October 1949 in the presence of the Archbishop of Nitra, Dr. Eduard Néczey. The father of the idea of the new church, vdp. Štefan Bitter.\n\nThe interior of the church has undergone significant changes in recent years. The Stations of the Cross have become part of it. The front of the sanctuary was filled with wooden sculptures of the Thessalonian saints. In 1976, Terchova´s stonemasons carved a sacrificial altar. In addition to the artistic imagery, the impressive windows evoke the Cyril and Methodius theme in the interior. They depict motifs from the Cyril and Methodius period of our history through etchings. Like the interior, the exterior of the church has changed beyond recognition over the years. From the last period we should mention especially the inventive flower pots, the epoxy statues of the faithful above the main entrance, or the sculpture of the Taking down of the Cross, located in front of the entrance to the sacristy. Since 1990, the main tower has been decorated with a gilded two-armed cross.\n\nHistory of the Nativity scene in Terchová\n\nAn indispensable part of Christmas in Terchova in recent years is the Nativity scene, which on the eve of the most beautiful holiday of the year is installed in the local Roman Catholic church dedicated to Saint Cyril and Methodius. It is the work of local men, carvers, designers, electro-mechanics, who have put a piece of their own moulding and free time into this now widely – known project.\n\nThe idea to create a symbolic nativity scene was born before Christmas in 1976. Its author was a well-known village carver Štefan Hanuliak, who together with his friends Jozef Holúbek and Štefan Krištofík prepared a nice surprise for the local believers at Christmas of that year. They conceived their joint work in three parts. The first one presents the “old” Terchová with its crafts and characteristic colouring, the second one the “modest” Betlehem, the place of Jesus’ birth, and the third one the “sumptuous” Jerusalem. Over time, the plastic figures have been replaced by figures made of lime wood. It was the idea of the local clergyman, Vdp. Jozef Šabu. Since about the end of the 1970s, the designers have focused exclusively on lime wood. After the death of Štefan Hanuliak, his sons Jozef, Ján, František and their namesake Ján Hanuliak, followed up on the noble idea with the aforementioned masters.\n\nEvery year you can admire something new at the Nativity scene in Terchová. Religious scenes from Bethlehem and Jerusalem are added, the atmosphere of historical Terchova is evoked by other folk crafts and workshops of masters. And only the folk artists of Terchová know what the final form of the work will be. All three parts will continue to be tastefully supplemented with new bizarre scenes and figures.\n\nSource: terchova.uteczmesta.eu\n\nBasilica of St. Nicholas, Trnava – history\n\nA significant monument of Trnava is the Basilica of St. Nicholas, the construction of which began in 1380. This Gothic three-nave church was built on the site of an older Romanesque church, to which the earliest written record of Trnava refers (1211) and part of whose foundations were uncovered during extensive renovation work in 1975.\n\nThe construction of the basilica was done as a municipal building, as the city as patron supplied building materials from its own resources, but also with the support of the rulers and the wealthy bourgeoisie. The three-nave temple was built on the highest point of the old town. Around it was a cemetery. The original main street facade of the basilica was single-towered (Gothic). The Gothic portal on the south side is original. The perimeter outer masonry had supporting pillars, with tall Gothic windows between them.\n\nIn the sanctuary of the pentagonal conclusion, the original Gothic pastophorium is preserved. On the north side there is a Gothic opening leading today to the sacristy. It originally led to the Romanesque chapel of St. George, which served the parish needs during the construction of the church.\n\nThe cross vault of the sanctuary has pear-shaped ribs. The sanctuary is connected to the nave by a massive triumphal arch. The nave has side aisles of equal width on either side, separated by unequal width Gothic arcades.\n\nThe four arched bays of the nave are similar in design to those of the sanctuary. In the centre of the bays there are hollowed-out stone studs with sculptural coats of arms (Sigismund of Luxembourg, Albert of Habsburg and the city of Trnava). The side aisles are similarly arched with stone ribs and studs. The original frescoes have been preserved in the vestibule of the church (sub-chancel): the attributes of the Evangelists , the emblem of the town in the middle and on the walls and pillars St. John the Evangelist, St. Nicholas, St. Paul and the scene of St. George.\n\nThe original chapels on either side of the main entrance were rebuilt and reinforced at the beginning of the 16th century. Century, when extensive alterations and repairs were carried out. At that time, Archbishop Nicholas Oláh wanted to emphasize the importance of this church, which from 1543 also served the Archbishop of Esztergom and his chapter, who evacuated to Trnava from the Turks. The façade was rebuilt into a double tower and the chapels under the tower were enlarged. In 1577, weathervanes were placed on top of the towers: roosters with a double cross. (The cockerel on the snood is also at the side entrance. It is from the coat of arms of the town captain Hollý – 1498).\n\nThe 17th century was marked by the most extensive building modifications and changes to the church. At the instigation of Archbishop Cardinal Peter Pazman, extensive rebuilding and interior alterations began in 1618 and were completed in 1630. The addition of the side chapels changed not only the plan of the church, but also its uniformity and Gothic structure. At that time, the Gothic chapel of St. George was also demolished and a sacristy was built in its place. A new choir, pulpit, new pews and new altars were built – all in Baroque style.\n\nA great fire in 1666 affected the north tower, which Archbishop Juraj Szelepchen – Pohronec had rebuilt to the height of the south tower in 1676. The sacristy was also rebuilt and decorated with a linette vault with stucco decoration.\n\nThe last significant addition to the church was the central Baroque chapel of the Virgin Mary, built in 1739 – 1741 with a canopied altar by A. Huetter.\n\nAt the beginning of 19. The triumphal arch was repaired in the 19th century, the abolished saddle towers of the sanctuary walls were given wooden panelling and on the south side in 1823 the supporting pillars were reinforced from the materials of the abolished Slovak church of St. Michael arch.\n\nIn 1900-1905 new stained glass windows were installed, the side walls of the nave and the sanctuary were painted. In 1916, the brick infill of the three-circular Gothic window of the south under-tower chapel was removed and the chapel was renovated in 1922.\n\nIn 1954-1958 the towers were plastered and extensive cleaning and conservation work was carried out on the cornices, stone lintels, phyllons and stone gargoyles.\n\nCleaning of the Baroque ceiling of the sacristy in 1964, electrification of the bells in 1967, etc.\n\nSource: trnava.fara.sk\n\nChurch of St. Margaret of Antioch – history\n\nStructurally, it was a small building with a simple layout with a longitudinal nave and an irregular square apse, such as were widespread in Europe since the 8th century. The apse and possibly the nave were vaulted with a simple vaulted vault. It was probably not a normal church, as archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a western two-roomed narthex (nartex) with a rectangular plan, which was added to the church.\n\nReconstruction of the church\n\nThe building had its first major reconstruction around the middle of the 13th century. At that time, the windows on the north side of the nave were bricked up, as well as the window on the west front. As part of this reconstruction, the entire interior was also decorated with frescoes.\n\nSometime at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, the windows on the south side of the nave and sanctuary were enlarged into a Gothic form with a stone nunnery. In the second half of the 15th century the church was fortified and surrounded by a moat. These modifications were probably related to the war clashes between Hungary and the Kingdom of Bohemia, when it served as a support point near the border.\n\nExperts also place the demolition of the western vestibule and the insertion of a large Gothic portal into the western facade in this period. This was connected with the moving of the altar from the apse to the nave and the raising of the floor level. The reason for these alterations was the insufficient capacity of the church for the growing congregation, some of whom had to stand outside during services. The large portal thus acted as a triumphal arch. Along with these modifications, an emporium was built in the west part of the nave and the west window on the south wall of the nave was reduced in size to accommodate it. Sometime in the following period (around the mid-16th century), the east window of the apse was bricked up, and the newly created whole area was decorated with a mural, probably depicting St. Margaret.\n\nThe next stage of construction dates from 1647, when the altar was moved from the nave back to the apse, where the southern Gothic window was also bricked up and turned into a niche for worship in the interior. In the 17th or 18th century, the nave lighting from the south was redesigned. The previously reduced west window was completely bricked up and the east window was replaced by a large Baroque semicircular window opening. Minor alterations were also carried out in the following period, most recently in 1926.\n\nArchaeological research\n\nThe first archaeological research around the church was carried out in 1964. In 1994, the conservationists began research work with the aim of mapping the construction development of the church and at the same time archaeological research of the surroundings of the building was started. In 2004, graves containing Great Moravian jewellery were uncovered, confirming the dating of the church. During the research, in 2000, the restoration of the church began, but it was not carried out in the most appropriate way from today’s point of view.\n\nThe church received a new roof, the windows were restored, the Gothic portal was bricked up and a new entrance was created, but its shape did not correspond to the pre-Romanesque period. The interior floor was also lowered to its original level. In 2008, the roof of both the nave and the apse was raised by about half a metre to divert rainwater away from the walls. In 2014, the exterior of the church was altered by changing the unsatisfactory shape of the western entrance, better presenting the bricked-up Gothic portal and marking out the plan of the western narthex. Large flat stones were also used to mark the places near the church where the oldest graves were found.\n\nSource: apsida.sk\n\nHillfort Pohonsko, Breclav\n\nThe archaeological research, which has been carried out here since 1958 by the Institute of Archaeology and Museology of the Faculty of Arts of Masaryk University in Brno, has contributed to its knowledge.The archaeological research has revealed scattered findings from various periods of prehistory, but above all it has proved a continuous settlement from the time of Slavic expansion (6th century) until the first half of the 10th century AD. The hillfort was built only at the beginning of the 9th century. It is a lowland type of oval shape with an area of 28 hectares. It is one of the largest early medieval fortifications in Central Europe. The well visible rampart is a remnant of a shell wall originally 5.7-6.5 m wide, consisting of a front stone wall, an earthen embankment and an inner wooden wall made of timbers supported by pairs of stakes 1.5-2 m apart. The embankment was 4 m high; with the wooden breastwork, the fortification reached a height of 6 m.\n\nThe most important discovery in Pohansko is considered to be the grand manor, which was explored in the northwestern part of the fortress. It was a rectangular settlement of almost 1 ha surrounded by a wooden palisade, built in two phases in the 9th century. There was a sacral precinct with a church and a burial ground, a residential part of the great man with single and multi-room houses on stone and mortar foundations, an economic part with cattle pens, stables, barns, granaries, etc. (over 50 buildings) inside the courtyard.\n\nAccording to the preserved foundations, the church, built in a special enclosure by the courtyard, belonged to the type of single-nave buildings (length 18.65 m, width 7.2 m) with an offset semicircular apse and an almost square nartex; on the southeast side a square annex adjoined the nave. The temple was built of imported rubble stone bonded with lime mortar. The walls were plastered and whitewashed, and there were also coloured frescoes inside. The foundation of the church can be associated with the earlier phase of the court, i.e. before the middle of the 9th century. It disappeared around the mid-10th century at the latest, and it may have lost its sacral function earlier. It was probably a so-called proprietary church. There was a rich cemetery around the church. It was the burial place of the community residing in the manor from the beginning of the 9th century to the middle of the 10th century. 4 swords, 8 axes, 32 spurs and 46 gold and silver jewels of Byzantine-Oriental character were found in 407 graves. The fact that among the adult graves there is a much higher percentage of male graves indicates an unusual composition of the court’s population, probably due to the presence of a military retinue. Extensive Great Moravian settlement complexes, and smaller burial sites have been excavated at various locations within the hillfort and on the forecourt, in addition to the court.\n\nAn artisan settlement in the northeastern part of the hillfort (in the former forest nursery about 100 m east of the research of the great man’s court) was investigated over an area of more than 2 ha without capturing its edges (260 Great Moravian buildings). The origins of the whole settlement can be placed in the first half of the 9th century. The northeastern forebay occupied a kidney-shaped area (2.5 ha) rising about 1.5 m above the inundation (103 Great Moravian settlement objects were excavated). A trough and stone destruction at the edge of the earthwork indicate that it was originally enclosed by a palisade. The Great Moravian settlement area of the southern forebay was investigated in the route of the canal under construction in a salvage manner over an area of 9 hectares with a 100 m wide probe. The edge of the settlement was only captured on the eastern side, elsewhere only a section of the settlement area was explored with the probe.\n\nA total of 436 settlement buildings were saved, almost a quarter of which were residential earthworks with a stone oven in the corner. Other buildings were of an economic and production character. Apart from the rich church cemetery, isolated graves and small burial sites with 10-30 graves were located directly among the settlement buildings in all the above-mentioned Great Moravian settlement complexes. There were a total of 184 graves on the hillfort and on the northeastern foreland There were over 200 graves on the southern foreland. An Early Slavic and Old Burgundian urn burial site was also excavated in the hillfort area. Early Slavic and Old Burgundian settlement (6th-8th centuries) was recorded at two sites in the northern part of the hillfort (79 settlement buildings). It was probably a cluster-type agricultural settlement divided into individual courts. The protected area of the site is 790237 m2.\n\nSource: pamatkovykatalog.cz\n\nPobedim Hillfort\n\nPobedim is a well-known archaeological site. The most significant discovery was the unearthing of a Slavic hillfort from the period of Pribina’s principality. The archaeological research at the Hradištia site was led by PhDr. Darina Bialeková CSc, who became an honorary citizen of the village.\n\nThe oldest settlement of Pobedim dates back to the Early and Late Stone Age, when the first peasants settled in the village. Evidence of the settlement are ceramic sherds and parts of stone tools at the Hillfort site. Other evidence of settlement dating back to the Bronze Age was also uncovered during the research. However, the most significant of the Bronze Age settlements are from the Early and Late Bronze Age. During ten years of research, a settlement belonging to the Lusatian culture was investigated. A number of settlements were uncovered, as well as a cult site of worshippers of the sun god. Among the finds, bronze casting moulds, pottery, worked bones and, above all, a rich collection of bronze objects /needles, sickles, knives, darts, jewellery and more/ are noteworthy. Vessels of various types have been reconstructed from the many ceramic fragments, and small animal sculptures have also been found. The Late Bronze Age settlement was an important production, trade and cult site in the Central Povazie region.\n\nRoman sculpture of Silenus\n\nThe settlement of Pobedim was also significant at the time when our territory was in the neighbourhood of the Roman Empire. A settlement with significant findings from the Roman period has been investigated at the Lower Field site. Settlement buildings have been uncovered and ceramic vessels have been found, and fragments of Roman pottery, the so-called terra sigillata, are particularly valuable. The dating of the finds was facilitated by Roman coins. These were found both at the Lower Field site and at the Upper Field site. An important and often published find from the Roman period is a bronze Silenus head inlaid with silver. Objects of a manufacturing nature were found and documented during the construction of the motorway between Piešt’any and Horná Streda. The continuity of the settlement of Pobedim can also be traced in the period of the migration of peoples.\n\nSlavs in Pobedim\n\nThe first Slavs appeared in the area of the municipality in the 6th century, when the early Slavic settlements on the Lower Field and Upper Field were located here. From there, in the 8th century, the settlement moved from the Dudváh and Dubová basins. However, the most intensive Slavic settlement was at the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th century. At that time, several locations in the village area were inhabited, but the most significant was the Zapupovec location, where almost 30 objects have been excavated, including two wells. Based on the findings, the inhabitants of the settlement were engaged in blacksmithing. This is evidenced by the finds of nozzles, iron slag and unfinished products. In addition to these finds, the discovery of a wooden ladle from Well 1 and the finds of two artistic sheet metal forgings are noteworthy.\n\nFortification of the Slavic hillfort\n\nUndoubtedly the most important Slavic archaeological site was the fortified centre, which had its acropolis and sub-castle. It was situated on the position of Hradištia and Podhradištia. The hillfort is one of the oldest fortified sites of the Danube Slavs. It was fortified with a rampart built by a chamber system. On the outside, an earthen rampart reinforced with wood protected the stone wall and on the inside the rampart was supported by sloping supports. A wooden palisade was set into the crown of the rampart. There were watchtowers in certain parts of the rampart. The fortified centre was the residence of the Grand Duke with his retinue and servants. The fortified centre was inhabited by the Grand Duke, who had his retinue and servants. Near the rampart there were workshops, the centre of the rampart was a place to concentrate the inhabitants of the surrounding settlements in times of danger. Pobedim hillfort was also the centre of trade in the Váh basin. This statement is supported by archaeological findings and especially by the discovery of axe-heads of the then semi-finished and primitive currency.\n\nThe demise of the hillfort dates back to the turn of the first and second third of the 9th century, to the period when the territory of Pribina’s principality became a part of Great Moravia. In the second half of the 9th and 10th centuries, Slavic settlements of agricultural character were spread out in the wider surroundings of the already extinct hillfort. In the 11th-12th centuries, the settlement of Pobedim was transferred to the area of today’s village.\n\nElaborated by: I. I.

An important meeting also took place in the papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major, where a Slavic liturgy was approved in 822.\n\nThe working trip to Rome, which was prepared by the Embassy of the Czech Republic at the Holy See and the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Italy, was led by the Governor of the Zlín Region Mr. Radim Holiš.\n\n“Over the course of two days, we completed a very demanding program in Rome. In addition to signing memoranda on cooperation and development of our Route in Rome, there were also negotiations with representatives of the Italian Romea Strata Route, of which our Association is a founding member, “said Governor of the Zlín Region Mr. Radim Holiš.\n\nIn this context, the discussion focused mainly on the exploitation of mutual potential in the areas where the two Routes meet. Thanks to the cooperation with the Romea Strata Route, a direct trail to Rome has opened up for the Cyril and Methodius Route, where the final stage of the journey is the Basilica of Saint Clement.\n\n“By connecting our Route with the Romea Strata Route, we do not have to start tracing and marking in Italy. We make full use of Romea Strata’s trails in order to enter Rome. In cooperation with the representatives of the basilicas and the city of Rome the inner circuit in Rome will be marked, which will culminate at the tomb of Saint Cyril under the sign of the Cyril and Methodius Route, “said Zuzana Vojtová, the Director of the Association. Following the same principle, our trails help Romea Strata to trace through the territory of the Czech Republic, when, on the contrary, the trails of Cyril and Methodius Route and St. Jacob’s Route are used.\n\nIn addition to these negotiations on the development of the Cyril and Methodius Route in Italy, there was also a meeting between the Governor of the Zlín Region and the Deputy Mayor of Rome Mr. Pierluigi Sanna.\n\nThe topic was not only tourism, but again cooperation in the development of the Cyril and Methodius Route in the city of Rome. “We were very pleased with the approach of the city representative. We are especially pleased with the helpfulness of the Deputy Mayor for cooperation between the Zlín Region and the City of Rome in the field of cultural tourism, “added Governor Mr. Holiš.\n\nOutside these negotiations a meeting with Mons . Maurizio Bravi carried out, a representative of the Holy See at the World Tourism Organization.\n\nThe exceptionally positive results of the trip are mainly due to the Ambassador of the Czech Republic to the Holy See, H.E. Václav Kolaja, who negotiated the acceptance and subsequent signing of memoranda of cooperation for the Cyril and Methodius Route. The contribution of the Czech Embassy in Rome, the Ambassador H.E. Hana Hubáčková, who initiated negotiations with the Deputy Mayor of Rome, is also significant.\n\nFeb 18, 2022\n\nMore information:\n\nMgr.

The pilgrimage in honour of Sts. Cyril and Methodius on the trail from Velehrad to Nitra, where pilgrims will cover over 200 km in 8 days. The pilgrimage will take place from Monday 27 June to Tuesday 5 July.\n\n“Trails of The Cyril and Methodius Routes usually lead us to Velehrad. But from the beginning they were conceived as two-way. The advantage was evident last year during the pilgrimage to Tetín, and this year we are glad that pilgrims will be able to follow the already marked route to Trenčín and then, we hope, lay the foundation stones for a new trail to Nitra, which has been a long-time partner of the Cyril and Methodius Route and where the Cyril and Methodius legacy is tangible at every step,” said Zuzana Vojtová, director of the European Cultural Route of St. Cyril and Methodius. This is behind the growing network of signposted trails of the Cyril and Methodius Route In 2021, it was certified as a Cultural Route of the Council of Europe. The Cyril and Methodius Route is thus one of 48 certified cultural routes with a transnational reach.\n\n“It is a great honour for ancient Nitra to be one of the important points on the international Cyril and Methodius Route. We will gladly welcome the pilgrims from Velehrad to our town under Zobor and thus connect the centres preserving the Great Moravian and Cyril and Methodius traditions with a symbolic living bridge. I believe that this year’s pilgrimage will enrich the mosaic of long-standing cooperation with the European Cultural Route of Saints Cyril and Methodius, which deserves thanks for the successful certification process and inclusion among the Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe. The programme of the Nitra, lovely Nitra festival once again offers a spiritual, historical and social line in the form of a pilgrimage, the Cyril and Methodius National Pilgrimage, the historical festival Pribinova Nitrawa, a concert by the Slovak Philharmonic and SĽUK on Svätopluk Square, exhibitions, tours and a preview of the film documentary Chernobyl on Wheels. All are warmly welcome in Nitra,” said the Mayor of Nitra Marek Hattas.\n\nPilgrims will be accompanied by pilgrim Petr Hirsch, who has extensive experience from various pilgrimage trails in the Czech Republic and abroad. At the turn of 2019 and 2020, he was involved in the production and organization of the documentary Walking without Borders, which was funded by the aforementioned association.\n\n“Thanks to the accompanying vehicle, the pilgrimage is open to everyone, as it is not necessary to carry all the equipment on your back. We will be sleeping in a pilgrimage style, as is typical on our pilgrimages, i.e. we will have common halls, but sometimes we will also indulge in a little comfort in the form of beds. I am looking forward to the pilgrimage house at Skalka near Trenčín and to visiting one of the oldest pilgrimage sites in Slovakia. Part of the trail is familiar to me, so I know we will have some wonderful encounters with people along the way. And I am also looking forward to the new section between Trencin and Nitra. Travelling through Slovakia always brings wonderful experiences and memories,” says the main organizer and guide Petr Hirsch.\n\nThe second stage is over 200 km long and the pilgrims plan to cover it in 8 days. Along the route they will enjoy a rich cultural and historical programme and stops at more and less important places connected with the Cyril and Methodius tradition and history. The pilgrims will also visit archaeological sites associated with the Great Moravia period (e.g. in Staré Město, Uherské Hradiště, Bojná and Nitra) or other important historical and sacral monuments – the pilgrimage site Skalka near Trenčín, Castle of Trenčín, the pre-Romanesque church in Kostoľany pod Tribečom, Zobor Monastery, etc. In addition, they will walk along most of the trail through a beautiful and preserved natural landscape.\n\nDetailed information about the event, including the application form, is published on www.pout.eu and on the websites of the participating organisations,” said Petr Hirsch, a well-known promoter of hiking pilgrimage.\n\nA rich programme will be prepared for pilgrims in Nitra. The pilgrimage will end on Tuesday, July 5, with participation in the national Cyril and Methodius pilgrimage mass in Svatopluk Square.\n\nThe marked trails of the Cyril and Methodius Route use the trails of the KČT (KST in Slovakia). There are more than a thousand kilometres already signposted trails of Cyril and Methodius Route, detailed information about them can be found on the website www.putujmebezhranic.cz.\n\nA walking pilgrimage from Velehrad to Nitra linked the main sites of the Cyril and Methodius celebrations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia\n\nVELEHRAD, NITRA – The Slovak national Cyrillo-Methodian celebrations “Nitra, Lovely Nitra” marked the culmination of a week-long pilgrimage from Velehrad to Nitra along the 210-kilometre-long Cyrillo-Methodian trail held since June 26 to July 5. Pilgrims from Velehrad brought to the main organizers of the celebrations in Nitra – the Mayor of Nitra Marek Hattas, the President of the Nitra Self-Governing Region Milan Belica and Bishop Mons. Viliam Judák – gingerbread hearts from Velehrad. Thanks to the wish of the Bishop of Nitra, the heart was even handed over from the hands of pilgrims at the Slovak National Mass to the main celebrant – Archbishop of Košice, Mons. Bober. From the Archeopark Modrá they brought a replica of a Great Moravian ceramic vessel – a canteen, which was presented to the costumed Pribina, the former Great Moravian prince, by the main organizer of the walking pilgrimage – Petr Hirsch. In return, he received from Pribina mead from the Nitra Region, Pribina’s medal, a decorative knife for opening correspondence with a handle in the shape of a Slavic-Avar belt and a rosary from the Archbishop of Košice.\n\n“Symbolically, the pilgrimage confirmed the friendly relations along the ever-expanding Cyril and Methodius Route and also commemorated the 1,200th anniversary of the first written mention of the Moravians in the old Frankish chronicle. At Nitra Castle, a living logo of the Cyril and Methodius Route was created with the help of the participants of the historical procession around the Proglas monument – a sculptural work depicting the oldest Slavic literary monument written in Glagolitic,” said Zuzana Vojtová, Director of the association European Cultural Route of Saints Cyril and Methodius.\n\nThe reception of the pilgrims, who travelled from Velehrad, at the private residence of Bishop Judák was beautiful. He not only prepared refreshments for them, but also allowed them to see the unique places of Nitra Castle. He also presented the pilgrims and our association with the book Cradle of Christianity in Slovakia – Nitra Castle and the Cathedral of St. Emaram in the Changes of Time, which he co-authored.\n\nA part of the varied cultural, spiritual, historical and social programme of the Nitra festivities was also a wandering along other Cyrillo-Methodian trails. About 30 people went on an experiential wandering from the Church of St. Michael in Dražovce through the Zobor Monastery and Martin Hill to Nitra Castle (12 km) and 40 cyclists took part in the two-day cycling tour Nitra – Močenok – Trnava and back.\n\nThis year, the municipality of Terchová, which has been a member of the international association European Cultural Route of Saints Cyril and Methodius since 2019, also presented itself in Nitra. Representatives of the Municipality of Terchová opened an exhibition in the Nitra Synagogue accompanied by Terchová‘s música, created in 2019 on the occasion of the 30th annual Cyrillo-Methodiuan Days held in Terchová and invited to the traditional celebrations in their municipality. The Archaeological Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Nitra opened the exhibition “Returns to Roots”, which recalls a number of finds in the local area, such as the bell and plaques from the Bojná hillfort, which symbolise the beginnings of Christian culture in the area of today’s Slovakia. The Nitra, Lovely Nitra festivities ended in Bojná with the Cyril and Methodius Festival on 9 July with a varied programme including living history performances and a mass in the natural setting of the hillfort.\n\nIn total, the Nitra, Lovely Nitra festival was attended by about 18,000 visitors who enjoyed many friendly encounters in the beautiful surroundings of the historic town and its surroundings. Alongside the Days of People of Good Will at Velehrad (in Czech Republic), the Cyrillo-Methodian and Pribina festivities of Nitra, Lovely Nitra are the main celebrations of the legacy of the Slavic apostles in Central Europe. This year, too, they offered an attractive programme and attracted not only locals and pilgrims, but also tourists. They also contributed significantly to the visibility of the international Cyril and Methodius Route, which popularises the cultural heritage associated with the Great Moravian period.\n\nThe Cyril and Methodius Route is presented in the European Parliament\n\nSTRASBOURG – The Cyril and Methodius Route – the Cultural Route of the Council of Europe is being presented these days at the European Parliament, where it is currently holding a plenary session. On the evening of Tuesday, 18 October, the opening of the project exhibition took place, attended by the Governor of the Zlín Region, Radim Holiš, and his deputy, Lubomír Traub, Chairman of the European Cultural Route of Saits Cyril and Methodius Association.\n\n“We are proud of the diversity of the region in which we live and where the Byzantine scholars – Saints Cyril and Methodius – were active in the ninth century. Thanks to more than a thousand years of Christian culture in our region, we also place emphasis on honouring our cultural roots and preserving traditions. We wanted to present the Cyril and Methodius Route project on the floor of the European Parliament and to attract other partners who will help us with its further development and promotion. This was possible thanks to the cooperation with the MEP Martina Dlabajová and the professional approach of our team. I wish that the Cyril and Methodius Route will become a cultural bridge that will connect people of good will throughout Europe,” said the Governor Radim Holiš at the opening ceremony.\n\n“I was pleasantly surprised by the attention the exhibition attracted in the European Parliament. This confirms that we are on the right track. The Cyril and Methodius Route builds on the broad legacy of Saints Cyril and Methodius, co-patrons of Europe, and is aimed at promoting sustainable cultural tourism and the increasingly popular pilgrimage tourism. The exhibition provides information about the cultural heritage, tourist destinations and trails, as well as plans for further development of the Route. It was on display in Strasbourg until Thursday 20 October 2022,” said Deputy Minister Lubomír Traub.\n\nOn the same day, a meeting was also held with the Greek representative to the Council of Europe’s Enlarge Partial Agreement on Cultural Routes, Margarita Lioulia from the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport. She is one of the decision-makers on the certification and re-certification of cultural routes according to the criteria of the Council of Europe. The discussion was mainly about the interest in a wider involvement of Greek partners in the project.\n\nThe event in Strasbourg is organised thanks to the cooperation of MEP Martina Dlabajová, the Zlín Region and the European Cultural Route of Saints Cyril and Methodius Association. “The idea of the Cyril and Methodius Route dates back to 2011 and is linked to the idea of inspiring and promoting European values. These certainly include understanding, cultural dialogue and unity. This is what we all need in these uncertain times,” said Martina Dlabajová, who has been supporting and promoting the Cyril and Methodius Route for a long time. She organised an exhibition on the topic at the European Parliament in 2014.\n\n14|15 BATA INSTITUTE hosts an exhibition dedicated to the Cyril and Methodius Route\n\nIn front of Building 14, the panel exhibition Cyril and Methodius Route – Cultural Route of the Council of Europe presents the legacy of Saints Cyril and Methodius and their followers in an engaging way through texts and photographs. It also introduces passers-by to the trails of the Cyril and Methodius Route directly in the Zlín Region. Maps for these trails are available to visitors at the Zlín Regional Tourist Information Centre in 14|15 BATA INSTITUTE.\n\nThe exhibition presents the broad European legacy of Saints Cyril and Methodius and their followers through texts and photographs on eight outdoor panels. It also informs about the ever-expanding network of long-distance trails of the Cyril and Methodius Routes that have been marked in the Czech and Slovak Republics in cooperation with Tourist Hiking Clubs. The potential of the Route as a network of monuments linked to the Cyril and Methodius legacy in other European countries is also presented. Two panels introduce the trails of the Cyril and Methodius Route directly in the Zlín Region, where the whole idea of linking on the basis of a common cultural heritage originated ten years ago. Maps of these walking trails are available directly next to the exhibition at the Regional Tourist and Information Centre in 14|15 BAŤ INSTITUTE. One panel illuminates the Council of Europe’s Cultural Routes Programme, in which 48 cultural routes with transnational themes and activities have been certified, the Cyril and Methodius Route being one of them.\n\n“The exhibition invites visitors to visit the memorable places associated with the development of Slavic culture not only in the Zlín Region and the Czech Republic, but also elsewhere abroad. At the same time, it reminds us of the European values that the brothers of Thessaloniki co-created and, as co-patrons of Europe, are still creating. This is especially needed today. I am pleased that the inhabitants of the region can see the exhibition in Zlín in connection with the recent presentation of the Cyril and Methodius Route in the European Parliament in Strasbourg,” said Lubomír Traub, Deputy Governor of the Zlín Region and Chairman of the European Cultural Route of Saints Cyril and Methodius Association.\n\n“On the Cyril and Methodius Route in the Zlín Region, especially in the Slovácko region, we can find several national cultural monuments – for example, archaeological sites in Staré Město, Uherské Hradiště, Modrá or Osvětimany. Most of them have been revitalised and a new Cyril and Methodius Centre with interactive multimedia exhibitions has even been built in the Staré Město. All these are not only reminders of our history, but also attractive tourist destinations for residents and visitors to the region,” said Zuzana Fišerová, the Regional Councillor for Culture and Education.\n\nThe exhibition was financed by the Zlín Region and was created on the occasion of the award of the Cultural Route of the Council of Europe certificate and the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2022. It is one of four outdoor exhibitions within the project of joint promotion of four Moravian regions – Zlín, South Moravia, Olomouc and Moravia-Silesia.\n\n“The space in front of the 14|15 BAŤ INSTITUTE will be enlivened in the coming days by another interesting exhibition, which will present a number of interesting things. The location of the exhibition in the vicinity of the Regional Tourist Information Centre in the 14th building of the factory complex allows visitors to get more information in this place,” said Petra Kubíková, director of the 14|15 Bata Institute.\n\nMore information at www.putujmebezhranic.cz and www.14-15.cz.\n\nThe Cyril and Methodius Route promotes cross-border cooperation in culture and education\n\nIn the second half of November, representatives of the European Cultural Route of Saints Cyril and Methodius, representatives of the Žilina Region and officials of the Terchová municipality, together with artists and lecturers, held an international working meeting in the Slovak municipality of Terchová and its surroundings to prepare creative activities for primary school pupils from both sides of the Czech-Slovak border. The activities will be aimed at bringing the legacy of Great Moravia closer to and the Slavic saints, in particular the meaning of the Glagolitic script. The preparation of creative workshops with the participation of leading artists from both sides of the border, as well as the creation of worksheets for use in schools, leisure facilities or thematic monuments is the aim of the one-year cross-border cooperation project “Cyril and Methodius Route – Culture and Education without Borders”.\n\n“With this project we aim to make school and after-school education about the legacy of Great Moravia more attractive and to intensify cooperation with contemporary artists who are consistently devoted to the Cyril and Methodius legacy in their work. This is also the mission of the Cultural Route of the Council of Europe,” said Martina Janochová, project coordinator of the European Cultural Route of St. Cyril and Methodius.\n\nSeveral artists are involved in the project – ac. sculp.

The participants of the study trip visited the pilgrimage site Skalka near Trenčín, where the 15th International Art and Literature Symposium ORA ET ARS initiated by Jozef Vydrnák took place. The participants also visited the Cyril and Methodius sculpture with representatives of the Diocese of Žilina and the Žilina Tourist Region, as well as the Holy Trinity Cathedral in the historical centre of Žilina. All participants also discussed the development of the Cyril and Methodius Trail in the Žilina region, for example the extension of the Cyril and Methodius walking route from Bílá to Terchová.
