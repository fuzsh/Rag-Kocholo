Students selected for this program are provided with the necessary resources and guidance to help them hone their artistic practice, broaden their vocabulary, tell their stories, and be heard.\n\nThis program is distinguished by its focus on historic photographic processes, like wet collodion, cyanotype, lumen printing, and platinum printing and by its ability to offer students a nurturing community of photographic professionals and working artists that is unavailable in traditional educational settings. For young students, photography provides a powerful conduit for finding their voice, but the ability to powerfully tell a story through photographic images must be learned, developed, and perfected.\n\nFundraiser\n\nSince the launch of the Youth Scholarship Program, Penumbra has welcomed over a dozen students to participate in photography workshops at no cost to them.\n\nPlease consider making a donation so that we can provide the necessary tools and guidance to help students hone their artistic practice, broaden their vocabulary, tell their stories, and be heard. No amount is too small.\n\nAll gifts are tax-deductable and directly support the Youth Scholarship Program."
