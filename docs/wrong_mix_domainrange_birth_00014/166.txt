I was just on the Bostick Family Ancestors in Richmond County, NC websites looking for information on the Bostick family and the USHER family. I am interested in information you have about Samuel USHER and Elizabeth Bostick. I was interested to know when they were born and the names of their children. We were told that our great great grandfather was William Bostick USHER born July 22, 1824 in Richmond, No. Carolina. That his father was Samuel USHER and mother was Elizabeth Bostick. We do not have any information on Samuel or Elizabeth (Bostick) USHER. On the website it mentions that more information was coming on Elizabeth and Samuel USHER. Is there a website to find this information. If so can you let me know where that website is located. Or do you have any information on them you can send me??? Please reply. Here is some information I have on William B. USHER. Around 1850, William Bostick USHER, who was 24 years old, removed from North Carolina to Holmes Co., MS to be a school teacher. In 1851 he married Elizabeth Rebecca Elmore, one of his pupils. Her parents are William and Mary (Reynolds) Elmore of Holmes Co., MS. He then became a farmer. In 1862 he enlisted into the Civil War in Lexington, MS. After the war he continued farming. In 1869, William moved his family along with some of his wife's family to Graves Co. Kentucky were they lived until death. They became tobacco farmers. Most of their family are still living in the Graves Co., KY area. Can you help us with any information? ===================================== Hello, Can you tell me more about the part you mention about William Bostick USHER was a son & a daughter, Mary Anne USHER who married George Washington Bennett. Also, do you have a way to send me a copy of the picture of Mary Anne USHER Bennett. That would be great. The information I seek is about Samuel and Elizabeth USHER and their children? Do you have any information about Samuel and Elizabeth when they were born, married, died and all their children's information?? What I am looking for is information that shows that William B. USHER is the son of Samuel and Elizabeth USHER? Since our gg Grandfather William B. USHER moved from NC before the 1850 census we do not have him listed with his father and mother. One of the USHER's in Kentucky back in the 1970's was doing research on the family. He found a copy of a power of attorney from William B. USHER, of the County of Graves, Kentucky, appointing Samuel T. USHER of the County of Montgomery, North Carolina. (We thing Samuel T. USHER was his brother.) He appointed Samuel to sale two tracts situate in the County of Montgomery on the waters of Mountain Cheek's Creek containing about 453 acres, also one other tract situate in the County of Richmond, on the waters of Big Mountain Creek containing about 300 acres. It is dated 6th of December, 1880. This power of attorney is registered in the deed book 26, page 33, 1880. Montgomery Co., NC. About someone that died in Holmes Co., MS. In my research of William B. USHER in Holmes Co., MS, I found census records on another family of USHER's. William W. USHER, a physician. I wrote the information down, but did not know if he was related. It showed his birthplace as South Carolina. He was listed on the 1840 and 1850 census for Holmes Co., MS. In 1850 he is age 50, his wife was Mary, 39, children, William, 16, John D., 11 and Mary, 8. His wife Mary and all the children's birthplace is MS. In 1860 and 1870 I only found his son, John D. USHER, in Holmes Co., MS. (Could William W. USHER be related to Thomas USHER?)
