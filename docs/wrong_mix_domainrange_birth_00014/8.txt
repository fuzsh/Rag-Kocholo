I’m a classically trained graduate from the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, and over 20 years of diverse experience as a violinist and entertainer, I have embraced performing and improvising within a broad variety of musical genres and have built repertoire and skill that explores a wide range of modern and classic styles such as pop, rock, classical, folk, Celtic, klezmer, RnB, EDM, contemporary, jazz, theatre, and world.

My breadth of experience includes serenading many people across Australia within the wedding and event space; performing in the music theatre and opera space across Victoria, and working professionally with Orchestra Victoria as a violinist and education mentor; working closely with performers and creative directors from the National Institute of Circus Arts and Cirque Du Soleil; and performing alongside some reputable names such as Damien Leith, Conrad Sewell, and most recently joining Kygo and Tiesto on their recent Australian tour.

While any type of performance is special, I hold a particularly deep connection and love for the in the wedding and event space, which was inspired by the pure joy that is born from the way music brings people together. My goal is to redefine the concept of the violin by taking live performance to a whole new level, ensuring that every occasion has that extra touch of magic, and every performance holds quality, connection, and passion. I’m here to tell a story.

I’m a little different…

I have always seen the violin as so much more than just a classical instrument. I believe there is place for the violin in any genre, and I am HERE for it!

If you want to begin your wedding ceremony by jamming to a bit of Usher played on the fiddle, I’m your girl!

I won’t try to make you fit my music - I make my music fit you.
