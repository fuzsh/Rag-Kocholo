        "text": "Usher has \"got it bad\" for his kids.\n\nBetween his Las Vegas residency, his Super Bowl performance and his upcoming tour, this Grammy-winning artist has been busier than ever ... but he always makes time for his family.\n\n\"I was born to do what I'm doing as a dad,\" Usher said in a 2012 episode of Oprah's Next Chapter.\n\nBut parenthood is not without its difficulties.\n\n\"Balance\" is a big challenge, Usher told \"Us Weekly\" in February 2023. \"I really want to be at every recital, (I) wanna be at every basketball game. I want to be at every step,\" he said.\n\nKeeping up with children can feel impossible. Can he do it?\n\nWe're guessing he'll say, \"Yeah!\"\n\nUsher's children with his ex-wife, Tameka Foster\n\nUsher married author/entrepreneur Tameka Foster in 2007, and he filed for divorce just two years later. He and Foster are parents to Usher “Cinco” Raymond V and Naviyd Ely Raymond.\n\nAfter a lengthy court battle, Usher was awarded primary custody of the children in 2012.\n\nKile Glover\n\nIn the midst of the court case, Kile Glover, Foster's 11-year-old son from a previous relationship, died as the result of a tragic jet ski accident. Usher recently told People magazine that Foster was in Italy when the incident occurred. \"I chartered a private plane to get her home because she was so distraught. We were not even together. It’s a real hard thing to lose a child. There’s not a day that his brothers and his mother don’t think about him,” he said.\n\nUsher “Cinco” Raymond V\n\nUsher's oldest child (and namesake!) was born in 2007. \"Cinco\" has always been a \"rebel,\" according to his dad, who hilariously commemorated his son's 14th birthday by posting a photo of Cinco in utero, holding up his middle finger.\n\nUsher has called Cinco his \"Mini-Me,\" and from these photos, you can definitely see why.\n\nNaviyd Ely Raymond\n\nUsher and Foster welcomed their second child, Naviyd Ely in 2008. Naviyd seems to enjoy the spotlight more than his older brother.\n\nHe attends fashion shows with his dad, and he even critiques his father's performances.\n\nAccording to People.com, Usher told Tamron Hall that \"(Naviyd's) like, 'You missed this thing. you didn’t do this thing.' And I’m like, 'Yeah that’s the point. It’s not supposed to be the same every night.'\"\n\nUsher’s children with his wife, Jenn Goicoechea\n\nUsher and Jenn Goicoechea, a senior vice president of A&R at Epic Records, confirmed that they were in a relationship in June 2019 and they recently made it official by getting married in Las Vegas on Super Bowl weekend.\n\nGoicoechea, who was named one of Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Power Players in 2020 and again in 2021, traveled in the same circles as Usher, and the couple is still going strong today.\n\nSovereign Bo Raymond\n\nGoicoechea gave birth to Sovereign Bo on September 24, 2020.\n\nUsher introduced her to the world with a sweet Instagram post that said: \"We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond. \"Isn’t She lovely\" by Stevie Wonder on repeat ❤️ ❤️ ❤️.\"\n\nUsher’s daughter is certainly lovely, and also strong.\n\nIn 2021, Usher told \"Extra\" that Sovereign's name means \"supreme ruler,\" and she is \"definitely ruling the household.\"\n\nSire Castrello Raymond\n\nThe newest edition to Usher's brood, Sire Castrello, arrived on September 29, 2021.\n\n\"Hear me roar,\" Usher wrote when he announced Sire's birth on Instagram.\n\nSire's middle name has a special meaning to Goicoechea. When introducing her son on Instagram, she wrote, \"I recently lost my grandfather, Champ Castrello (he was was 105). Champ was the strongest, bravest, family oriented, funny and kindest man I know.. (other than my baby father lol) I couldn’t ask for a better example of how a man should be! He was the definition… it was only right we keep his name alive.\""
