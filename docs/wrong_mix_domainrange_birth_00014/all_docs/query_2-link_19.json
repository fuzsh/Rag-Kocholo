        "text": "Usher (born October 14, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor. He rose to fame in the late 1990s with the release of his second album My Way, which spawned his first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit, \"Nice & Slow\". The album has been certified 6-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His follow-up album, 8701, produced the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\".\n\nUsher's 2004 album, Confessions, established him as one of the best-selling musical artists of the 2000s decade. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, bolstered by its four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number one songs — \"Yeah!\", \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\", and \"My Boo\" — and has been certified diamond by the RIAA. His follow-ups, Here I Stand (2008) and Raymond v. Raymond (2010), debuted atop the Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Love in This Club\" and \"OMG\". A follow-up EP, Versus, was released in July 2010 and produced the successful track \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\". His seventh studio album, Looking 4 Myself (2012), contained a more dance-pop sound and experienced lower first week sales compared to his previous efforts.\n\nThe RIAA ranks Usher as one of the best-selling artists in American music history, having sold over 23 million copies in the United States alone. To date, he has sold over 75 million records worldwide. Usher has won numerous awards including eight Grammy Awards. At the end of 2009, Usher was named the number one Hot 100 artist of the 2000s decade. Billboard named him the second most successful artist of the 2000s decade, with his 2004 album Confessions being ranked as the top solo album of the 2000s decade. Billboard also placed Usher at number six on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years. Usher has attained nine Hot 100 number-one singles.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nUsher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (née O'Neal) from Tennessee and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old; there, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. In the belief that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, Usher attended North Springs High School. Usher's father died of a heart attack on January 21, 2008.\n\nCareer[]\n\n1987–96: Musical beginnings and Usher[]\n\nAt age 11, Usher joined an R&B local quintet called the NuBeginnings, which was organized by local music svengali, Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded 10 songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV, was only made available regionally and by mail order. However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a \"bad experience\". The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.\n\nAt age 13, Usher competed on Star Search, where he was spotted by an A&R representative from LaFace Records, who arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid, the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher to a contract with the record company. Usher's mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career, but later broke up their relationship as manager-client in May 2007. Usher was introduced on \"Call Me a Mack\", a song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film Poetic Justice.\n\nOn August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher's self-titled debut album. Sean \"P Diddy\" Combs produced several of the tracks and co-executive produced the album. Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was accompanied by three singles: \"Can U Get wit It\", \"Think of You\", and \"The Many Ways\". The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on their version of \"Let's Straighten It Out\", a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist Monica; and on \"Dreamin'\", from LaFace's 1996 Olympic Games benefit album Rhythm of the Games.

His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine stuff, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: \"What he wanted to do was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate\". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is \"the most artistic of an album\" he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself \"I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me\".\n\nThe lead single from Usher's seventh studio album is titled \"Climax\". It impacted Urban radio on February 21, 2012, and was made available for purchase as a digital download on February 22, 2012. It impacted US mainstream radio on March 13, 2012.

His last act, Michelle Chamuel, lost the winning title to Danielle Bradbery, mentored by Blake Shelton. He returned for the sixth season and his last act, Josh Kaufman, won.\n\nUsher also appeared on the 37th annual 4 July Fireworks show sponsored by Macy's and was aired on NBC with a special soundtrack designed for the show featuring four of his very own songs.\n\nOn March 19, 2013, Usher made initial notice of his eighth studio album, titled UR, was being in the works. Talking to The Fader, he described the album as \"everything you can imagine\", saying that it's \"gonna be freaking out of here\". In an interview with singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger by Rap-Up, the former explained that he, along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Brian Alexander Morgan, was working on Usher's next album. Bellinger compared the album's music to Usher's Confessions (2004), saying that it is \"more R&B, more urban\" than Usher's Looking 4 Myself. The latter declared that his next album would show that he is \"still Usher\". \"Good Kisser\", a dance-heavy throwback R&B track, was released as the first single. Produced by Pop & Oak, it was performed at The Voice. Since then, two other singles have been released from the album: \"She Came to Give It to You\" featuring Nicki Minaj and \"I Don't Mind\" featuring Juicy J.\n\nArtistry[]\n\nMusic style and influences[]\n\nUsher has cited his biggest influence as Michael Jackson. Usher has a leggero tenor vocal range. When speaking of Usher's vocal range, Rick Juzwiak speaks \"his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one\" with emphasis on his falsetto being \"something that sounds as natural as a speaking voice...he's the picture of grace against shrieking synths\". Juzwiak emphasizes the singer's expressiveness by commenting \"his emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other'.\n\nUsher's music is generally R&B, but he also incorporates pop, dance and hip hop into his songs. With the albums Raymond vs. Raymond and Looking 4 Myself, he expanded into electropop and dance pop. Known for his R&B songs, Usher expanded his appeal and range by collaborating with Latin and dance artists like Pitbull, Romeo Santos, and David Guetta. Much of Usher's music after Confessions has an autobiographical nature with emphasis of lifestyle, relationships and love.\n\nOn many occasions, Usher has named Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, \"He influenced me in so many ways, more than just music ..... as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson.\" During the television special 'Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special', Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing \"You Rock My World\". In addition to Jackson, he has spoken of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as great musicians and philanthropists stating that \"they figured out what they were as they were going, by inspiration as well...allowing their music to speak to where they were and what they had to say\". Other influences include Janet Jackson, R. Kelly, Luther Vandross, and Bobby Brown.\n\nArt and feminism[]\n\nUsher is a staunch fan of art and also supports feminism. In 2014 December, he attended Art Basel Miami and participated in an art installation at JJ Brine’s VECTOR Gallery at Select Fair by performance artist Lena Marquise “Body As Commodity” during which she offered collectors to purchase 10 minutes of energy for $100. The news of the participation became the #1 reported on event of Art Basel Though Usher refused to issue any official statements about his participation, many assume his participation has to do with support for art and feminism due to the topic and tone of Usher's recent release at the time of song “I Don’t Mind” featuring Juicy J which talks about supporting the work of an exotic dancer, hinting at his support for the new wave of feminism.\n\nOther ventures[]\n\nBusiness ventures[]\n\nUsher founded vanity record label US Records, in 2002. The label is a subsidiary of Clive Davis's J Records, which is distributed by Sony BMG. The first album released by US Records was the soundtrack to In the Mix in late 2005, which was used to introduce the label's acts, such as rapper Rico Love, Canadian teen R&B artist Justin Bieber, and R&B vocal quartet composed of Jon A. Gordon, Michael A. Gordon, Courtney Vantrease, and Robert Brent p/k/a One Chance, and singer Rayan. Usher served as songwriter-producer in the project. The Raymond Braun Media Group, which Justin Bieber is signed up to, is a joint venture between Usher and Bieber's manager, Scooter Braun.\n\nAside from recording music, Usher is involved in other businesses, including several restaurants. Usher is a part owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers professional basketball team. He is part of a group which bought the team with a reported total purchase price of $375 million. He became the third pop artist to own a large stake in an NBA team. Usher served as the contestant mentor for the Top 10 Week of Season 9 of the television show American Idol. He appeared on the ITV1 show Britain's Got Talent on June 5, 2010. Recently Usher joined as a new coach of American reality talent show The Voice alongside Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Shakira for season 4, which premiered on March 25, 2013, on NBC.\n\nActing career[]\n\nHe has acted in feature films, debuting in 1998's The Faculty. He was among the stars in Light It Up and In the Mix. He starred in the 2002 Twilight Zone revival episode To Protect and Serve as a police officer. He has acted on stage, making his debut on Broadway in 2006 in Chicago as lawyer Billy Flynn and joining the cast of the Off-Broadway play Fuerzabruta in 2012; the former performance was critiqued by theater critic Ben Brantley as unfitting for the character played (Usher was \"cast so hard against type, you would think you would hear him cracking from the collision\"), despite commending Usher's vocal and choreographic performance in the show.\n\nPhilanthropy[]\n\nUsher founded New Look, a non-profit charity organization which aims to \"provide young people with a new look on life through education and real-world experience\". Its flagship project, camp New Look, ran from July 11 to July 23, 2005, in Clark Atlanta University. In 2006, the charity started an initiative called Our Block, for which it helped rebuild and revitalize city blocks in New Orleans. The project went on one street at a time, and the funding was helped through part of the proceeds of Usher's team-up with Armani Exchange in creating \"Love 4 Life\" dog tags, which were made available at the company's stores and Web site.\n\nIn 1999, Usher participated in \"Challenge for the Children\", a benefit basketball game hosted by American boy band NSYNC. The event, which was held on the campus of Georgia State University, had raised an estimated $50,000 for several local charities. In 2005, Usher is one among the artists who signed on for a Hurricane Katrina relief concert. He has also performed a public service announcement to promote Do Something's campaign for civic engagement.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn 2001, Usher began dating TLC member Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas. Their relationship lasted for two years: they broke up in December 2003, followed by a media frenzy surrounding the personal nature of Usher's fourth album, Confessions. His fans inferred the reason he and Thomas split is due to infidelity on his part, giving allusions to the lyrics of the songs. In an interview on The Bert Show on the Atlanta radio channel Q100 in February 2004, Thomas claimed that Usher cheated on her: \"Usher did the ultimate no-no to me....I will never be with him again, and that is that\". Usher defended: \"...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up\".\n\nIn November 2005, Usher began dating stylist Tameka Foster, who had worked as his personal stylist for several years. Their engagement was announced in February 2007. After the sudden cancellation of a planned July wedding in the Hamptons, the two were wed on August 3, 2007, in a civil ceremony in Atlanta. This was followed by a larger wedding ceremony on September 1, 2007, held at the Chateau Elan Winery & Resort outside Atlanta. Upon their marriage, Usher became a stepfather to Foster's three sons from previous relationships, one born when she was a teenager and two from her first marriage, to Atlanta clothier Ryan Glover. Usher and Foster also have two sons together: Usher \"Cinco\" Raymond V, born in November 2007, and Naviyd Ely Raymond, born in December 2008.\n\nIn February 2009, two months after the birth of their second son, Foster suffered a cardiac arrest in São Paulo, Brazil, when she was given general anesthesia prior to scheduled cosmetic surgery (reportedly liposuction), which was ultimately not performed. She was induced into a coma to aid her recovery and was transferred to a larger facility, the Hospital Sírio-Libanês. Usher cancelled his performance at Clive Davis's pre-Grammy Gala in order to fly to Brazil to be with Foster. After a week of recovery, Foster's surgeon issued a statement saying that she was \"doing very well\".\n\nUsher filed for divorce from Foster in June 2009 in Atlanta. The divorce was legally finalized in Fulton County Court on November 4, 2009. This preceded a highly publicized child custody dispute spanning three years, which ultimately culminated on August 24, 2012, with a judge awarding Usher primary custody of his two sons with Foster.\n\nFoster's 11-year-old son Kile Glover, Usher's former stepson, was declared brain dead on July 8, 2012, after being struck by a personal water craft on Lake Lanier the previous day. Glover died on July 21, 2012, after being removed from life support. Just over a year later, on August 5, 2013, Usher's eldest son, Usher V, was hospitalized in the ICU after he became stuck in a drain while swimming in a pool at Usher's home. The next day, Foster filed a request for an emergency custody hearing in Fulton County Superior Court, seeking temporary primary custody and citing Usher V's \"near-death accident\" as evidence of a lack of supervision of the children. At the hearing on August 9, 2013, the case was dismissed and Usher retained primary custody of their two sons.\n\nUsher is a vegan. He adopted a vegetarian diet shortly after the death of his father, Usher Raymond III, from a heart attack in January 2008. After several years, Usher dropped all egg and dairy products, embracing an entirely vegan diet for health reasons."
