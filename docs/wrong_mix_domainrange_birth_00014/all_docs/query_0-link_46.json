        "text": "Justin Timberlake - Man of the Woods Tour\n\nOpening acts: Francesco Yates, DJs\n\nDate Seen: February 6, 2019\n\nCost of Ticket: $150\n\nRating: 43%\n\nThe first time I saw Justin Timberlake in concert was in San Jose in 2007. He had cancelled the concert and rescheduled. Eleven years later, he cancelled and rescheduled his Edmonton concert. Coincidence? Mmm…\n\nBut let’s focus on the show. We skipped the 90 minutes of djs and warm up acts. Justin finally came onto the stage around 9:10pm (100 minutes from concert start). Considering the doors opened at 630pm and floor tickets were standing only, that would have been 4.5 hours standing on concrete.\n\nTimberlake’s album and concert are named after his son Silas, who’s name means ‘Man of the Forest.’ Justin claims that “this album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any album I've ever written–where I'm from.\" Knowing that, it seems unusual to release the first single and kick-off the concert with the sexually fuelled song “Filthy.” Mmmmkay. Even more sad, the opening was lacklustre. Timberlake’s massive meandering stage with faux trees and retractable scrims weren't enough to distract for the first two songs. Finally, Justin gets the crowd on his side with hits “LoveStoned” and “SexyBack.” While JT only sings about 1/3 of any song, he tries his best to keep up with his backup dancers. Ten years ago, JT commanded the stage with his liquid-like moves. Yesterday, the dad was outmatched by his troupe of 6 dancers.\n\nAt this point of the concert, the crowd has forgiven JT for the start and is enjoying the danceable mixes of his decade old hits. And then he de-rails the entire show with the song \"Man of the Woods.\" My friend turned to me and said “Are you freakin’ serious.” The aged pop star went from his steamy “ SexyBack\" to a song that sounds like it belongs in a low-budget-made-for-tv children’s movie about the great outdoors. It was laughable…and again...sad. My other friend tried to find a silver-lining and noted that “at least all his music doesn’t sound the same.” And she was right - the music throughout the show did have different sounds. The problem was that they did not transition well. Furthermore, JT didn’t seem to know his audience. No one attended the show to hear him sing pop, electro, funk, country, soul, reggae and songs for Trolls. A lot of artists have chosen to take a country detour on their recent albums. I think of Kylie Minogue who packed her Aussie-self up and went to Nashville and recorded her album Golden. While the album had a western sound, it was also authentically Kylie. You could tell she considered her fans when she recorded it. Timberlake’s departure from his pop roots doesn’t do the same. It’s like he lost his way and we found him drunk in sad honky tonk with Toby Keith playing in the background.\n\nThere were a few decent moments. “Cry Me a River” seemed filled with the right amount of edge and angst. The visuals projected on the scrims worked well and for me, this was the best of the show. “Mirrors” and “SummerLove” also reminded me why I liked JT in the first place. The retractable scrims provided makeshift screens that were occasionally used to accentuate the music (but all too often just showed a variety of trees…yeah we get it. Man of the Woods). While Timberlake did his best with these few songs, the sound wasn’t great. The arena was set up for a concert in the round, but the speakers provided an unclear sound for the majority of the show. One interesting touch was the campfire at the end of the arena. We didn’t have a great view of it but it was a nice idea. Unfortunately, it took JT and his team about 5 minutes (and a round of shots) in order to set up their acoustic set.\n\nI’m not going to beat the concert to death. I could write another 1000 words telling you how he barely sang, missed steps and lacked audience connection. It was bad. It wasn’t even 2 hours but I couldn’t wait for it to be over. After the show, I received several texts from friends asking if I thought it was as tragic as they did. JT is a undeniably talented but I think he is struggling to find his space as an adult artist. He worked with great producers on his most recent album, but the result missed the mark. His mashup of a concert failed on almost every front. Maybe he should stick to acting and appearing on Jimmy Fallon. Next time he plans to come to town, I can assure you that I won’t have tickets and he won’t be able to cancel on me for a third time.\n\nWhy didn’t John get a higher rating from me? Well besides Chrissy not being seated next to me (message me - we’ll go get some take out!)…there was room for improvement. Legend is likeable the minute he walks onto the stage. And I get the impression he is probably a great storyteller. But he doesn’t open up to let the audience in. His music alone only takes us so far on the journey. He briefly touches on the importance of music with his family but a few more anecdotes would have made the evening much more intimate and festive. Secondly, he should have kept the concert a bit more “classic” sounding and included songs like his beautiful cover of Mel Tormé’s “Christmas Song.” The song showcases Legend’s impressive voice and it was a shame not to hear it performed. And it felt a lil wrong to so quickly transition into Judy Garland’s “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” from “Penthouse Floor.\"\n\nThe show started nearly a half hour late, with the Ryman keeping concertgoers waiting in ridiculous lines outside the theatre in the rain. Bad on you Ryman! Walking into this show, I said to my parents that the success of it weighed heavily on the setlist. Lea and Darren are known for their roles on Glee but have since gone on to record their own music to limited/moderate success. Luckily the setlist was near perfect—packed full of the songs made popular on Glee. The pair kicked off the show with “Broadway Baby” that was sung on Glee and a fitting song for them both. Lea especially knew what the crowd wanted to hear while Darren’s selections were more obscure, even his Broadway choices. Overall, the show was well balanced with what I wanted to hear and what they had to try and sell (their new independent music).\n\nLea’s voice is something to behold. It is every bit as magical as Streisand or Menzel. She effortlessly hit notes that would scare other professional singers. However, because of the microphones, she lacked clarity. Several times, she even manually corrected her singing to adjust for feedback with the mic. Although I suspect she is too professional to do it, it sounded like she had skipped the sound check. (On a crazy sidenote, Celine Dion used to skip soundchecks and call them in over the cell phone while she was traveling. So it can be done). And while you could hear her pitch-perfect notes, more than half the time you didn’t know what she was singing unless you knew the song. Also, she had a couple 'off' moments in the show, most notably during my favourite song of hers, Battlefield, where she had rearranged the music but obviously forgot. They had to stop the song and pick up after the chorus. Another time later in the show, while singing with Darren, she in her own words, “fucked it up” again.\n\nDarren Criss could be seen as the underdog on this tour but he makes certain to prove that isn’t the case. While he might lack Lea’s elevated vocals, he compensates with musicality, movement, and personality. And luckily he is able to come across as anything but the psycho from the Assassination of Gianni Versace. He has a genuine gift for music; especially with his songwriting, composing and arranging. But, that doesn’t necessarily translate into a stellar performance. He kept dismissing the band to play solo which was distracting - and most of the time he sounded better with the other four musicians (Sorry Darren). He was most enjoyable when he sang recognizable songs such as Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream” which he covered on Glee. His best moment on stage, by far, was when he covered Patsy Cline’s classic “She’s Got You.” Also, Darren’s voice came through much clearer than Lea’s so that was an added benefit to him.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable night of music. The show lasted less than 2 hours which is short for 2 performers. Darren and Lea’s chemistry was fun and light, although, half was lost through the mics. Sadly, the sound worked against them here. As a performer with your name on your marquee, the show is ultimately your responsibility. If you sound bad, even though the mixer or sound engineer or stage manager or band compromise you, I think it’s within your power/right to correct it. Both Lea and Darren were off stage at times and could have easily spoken to their team to correct the change necessary. Although, they should have been settled long before the show at the sound check. I quickly googled “Ryman acoustics” and the third article discussed how delicate the Ryman is, and that it has near-perfect acoustics. However, when the music is too loud, it throws everything off, which is what I think happened last night. Regardless, great talent, decent performance, lousy sound.\n\n___\n\nTour Dates:\n\nMay 30 in Nashville, Tennessee, at The Ryman Auditorium\n\nMay 31 in Cincinnati, Ohio, at Taft Theatre\n\nJune 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at Benedum Center\n\nJune 3 in Washington, D.C., at Kennedy Center\n\nJune 5 in Indianapolis, Indiana, at Murat Theatre\n\nJune 6 in Columbus, Ohio, at Ohio Theatre\n\nJune 8 in Easton, Pennsylvania, at State Theatre Center for the Arts\n\nJune 9 in Newark, New Jersey, at NJPAC\n\nJune 10 in Toronto, Ontario, at Sony Theatre\n\nJune 26 in Chicago, Illinois, at Chicago Theater\n\nJune 27 in St. Louis, Missouri, at Peabody Opera House\n\nJune 29 in Atlanta, Georgia, at Cobb Energy Center\n\nJune 30 in Durham, North Carolina, at DPAC\n\nJuly 1 in Charlotte, North Carolina, at Ovens Auditorium\n\nScale is everything for a stadium concert. Swift understands this perfectly. Her soaring stage was well used to provide digital backgrounds and video footage of the performance. It was a simple structure that was very well used. Kudos to her creative team that kept the footage fresh and artistic and playful. (I especially loved the pre-show video footage of fan reactions to the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video and the small cameo from her cat Olivia). There was no shortage of fireworks and pyrotechnics to make a big impact throughout the show. The stage itself spanned the entire width of the stadium and had catwalks that went into the crowd on both sides. No matter where your seats were, you had a clear view of Taylor either in person or through projected video footage. The stadium was also equipped with 2 satellite stages at the back of the stadium in which Taylor traveled to and from in mechanical orbs and snakes above the crowd. Often stadium tours can get tricky when it comes to sound but I watched the show from 2 different locations and both had great sound. Finally, all concert-goers were equipped with light-up bracelets that illuminated the stadium beautifully...60,000 people with synchronized wristbands is pretty awesome\n\nThere were two opening acts for Taylor: Charli XCX and Camila Cabello. Charli XCX pounded hit after hit and got the crowd warmed up. I like a few of her songs but I was surprised at the hits that included her vocals such as \"I Love It\" by Icona Pop and \"Fancy\" with Iggy Azalea. Plus she rocked her own hit such as \"Boom Clap\" and \"Boys.\" Then Camila Cabello came out. I'm not sure how 1-Hit-Wonder Cabello got a higher billing than Charli XCX. Cabello sold her sex appeal and her failed attempts to twerk to fill the space that music should have filled. She saved \"Havana\" for the end and the rest was forgettable. However, though I'm not a fan, I will say that as a performer she has grown tremendously since I saw her open for Bruno Mars last summer. She needs to focus on the music and less on gyrating on her male dancers.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to see Lady Gaga perform in 3 of her other world tours (Monster Ball 2010, Born This Way Ball 2012 & ArtRave 2014). I have appreciated watching Gaga grow as an artist and performer. There were parts of the Monster Ball tour that were riddled with amateur mistakes from blocking to song choices and pacing. Born This Way Ball was a huge improvement where I believe she really hit her stride. The ArtRave tour made me fall in love with songs from the ArtPop album that I otherwise felt had fizzled. The show gave her music life and her performances were electric. Gaga's latest album, Joanne, had a few stand out songs but overall lacked the edginess that has defined her career. So it was with great anticipation I waited to see what her most recent tour would bring to her fans and tonight I found out.\n\nOne final critique is on the organization of the event. Originally when I bought the tickets, the event was scheduled for 7:30 pm. It got changed to 8:30 pm with no notice to concert goers. We had purchased the VIP Come to Mama package, which included floor seats, some swag, and priority entrance. 2 days before the show, the email from organizers informed us that the priority entrance was from 3:30-5:30 pm. Many people arrived around 3:30 pm. Organizers herded us from one line to the next for over 4 hours. Gaga didn't take the stage until almost 9 pm. So by the time the concert had started, many of the VIPs had already been standing for over 5.5 hours and then stood another 2 hours for the show. If you ask me...that's not very VIP at all.\n\nRemaining Shows are listed below:\n\nAUG 5, 2017\n\nSATURDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Tacoma Dome\n\nTacoma, Washington\n\nAUG 8, 2017\n\nTUESDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour The Forum\n\nInglewood, California\n\nAUG 9, 2017\n\nWEDNESDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour The Forum\n\nInglewood, California\n\nAUG 11, 2017\n\nFRIDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour T -Mobile Arena\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n\nAUG 13, 2017\n\nSUNDAY @ 7PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour AT&T Park\n\nSan Francisco, California\n\nAUG 15, 2017\n\nTUESDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Golden 1 Center\n\nSacramento, California\n\nAUG 19, 2017\n\nSATURDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour CenturyLink Center Omaha\n\nOmaha, Nebraska\n\nAUG 21, 2017\n\nMONDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Xcel Energy Center\n\nSaint Paul, Minnesota\n\nAUG 23, 2017\n\nWEDNESDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Quicken Loans Arena\n\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nAUG 25, 2017\n\nFRIDAY @ 7PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Wrigley Field\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nAUG 28, 2017\n\nMONDAY @ 8:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Citi Field\n\nCorona, New York\n\nAUG 29, 2017\n\nTUESDAY @ 8:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Citi Field\n\nCorona, New York\n\nSEP 2, 2017\n\nSATURDAY @ 6:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Fenway Park\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nSEP 4, 2017\n\nMONDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Centre Bell\n\nMontréal, Quebec\n\nSEP 6, 2017\n\nWEDNESDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Air Canada Centre\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nSEP 7, 2017\n\nTHURSDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Air Canada Centre\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nSEP 10, 2017\n\nSUNDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Wells Fargo Center\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nSEP 11, 2017\n\nMONDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Wells Fargo Center\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nNOV 5, 2017\n\nSUNDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Bankers Life Fieldhouse\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\nNOV 7, 2017\n\nTUESDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Little Caesars Arena\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nNOV 10, 2017\n\nFRIDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Mohegan Sun Arena\n\nUncasville, Connecticut\n\nNOV 11, 2017\n\nSATURDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour Mohegan Sun Arena\n\nUncasville, Connecticut\n\nNOV 13, 2017\n\nMONDAY @ 7:30PM\n\nLady Gaga Joanne World Tour KFC Yum!

Bruno was on stage for 90 minutes which just isn't enough. 90 minutes is the Las Vegas standard but not for a touring show. I think anything less than 2 hours is cheating. The opening act, Camila Cabello, was utterly forgettable. She started the show off at 8:15pm and wrapped her set after 30 minutes. Bruno came on stage at approximately 9:30pm and I was outside of Rogers Place by 11pm.\n\nLastly, while I will praise the staging, I didn't love the stage. When you tour a show in arenas, the show would have benefitted from a catwalk or a secondary stage.\n\nOverall a great night of non-stop energy and music.

Have you heard of live looping? No? That's ok. Most musicians don't use it. Essentially, it's a technology that allows a musician to live-record a piece of music (ie. enough chords to fill a verse) and then with the touch of a pedal or laptop, replay it continuously to an audience. This is Ed Sheeran's answer to a band. So he creates his musical accompaniment by himself in layers and then sings to it. Don't get me wrong, this takes a huge amount of talent. He live-records music and plays it back to the audience and layers upon it, and then sing on top of all of the music - all in order to try and produce the same level of sound he had on the record. It's complicated as hell and according to stats, only about 11% of musicians use live looping. Of those same musicians, 51% of musicians didn't even know what live looping was. Here is why I don't like it. Everyone gives Britney Spears attitude for not singing her songs live. She does sing live, but she sings along to a pre-recorded vocal track. Now the sound guy keeps her live vocal track low (and sometimes silent) because she is dancing, writing around on the floor and jumping off of trees. But I don't see a huge difference between Britney singing along to her own vocal track and Ed playing along to his own pre-recorded guitar track, even if he did (or didn't - we don't really know) record it moments before in front of us. It looked cheesy having guitar music playing while he clearly wasn't strumming the guitar. The point of it all is that he does it by himself, without a band. Honestly, I would have preferred a band or hell just a background music track. At least then he would have the opportunity to 'perform' and interact better with the audience.\n\nWhere Ed shines is his catchy tunes and he has a few of them. My personal highlights include Don't, Photograph, Thinking Out Loud, Sing and Shape of You. These songs give Ed full reign to shine and show why he has won over 45 major music awards. And the crowd loves it...and I mean really loves it. If you were at the show, look around and look to see who is crying. Mr. Sheeran has a special talent of stirring emotions at the \"Cougars and Kittens\" party that is his concert. Now between his massive hits was a whole lot of disjointed music. While most of it was forgettable, the different genres were not. Perfect is a beautiful ballad that would be an ideal wedding song. This is followed by Nancy Mulligan is a full-on Irish jig. I can't forget his cover of the jazzy show tune Feeling Good. And why not throw Eraser in there, an acoustic rap song with a balladesque chorus. Then Happier, a heart wrenchingly slow sad lil melody. Overall, the set list could use some redirecting and cleaning up. I do have to remember that Ed has only released 3 studio albums and doesn't have an exhaustive catalogue to choose from.\n\nTo begin, Adam Lambert is not Freddie Mercury. He goes on to admit that during the show. Lambert lacks the appeal and presence that Mercury was famous for. Lambert tries hard to channel the late superstar, but it is clear he lacks what other stars like David Bowie, George Michael and Annie Lennox possess. However, Adam Lambert's voice is as good (maybe even better?) as Mercury's and he is an ideal choice to fill the legend's shoes—even the 6 inch platform heels. He soars through song after song effortlessly and with precision. And while Lambert might not have the Freddie persona, he is not afraid to be playful and dress the part. There were more than a half dozen wild costume changes which puts him in the same league as Cher. Freddie would have been proud so perhaps we're on the right track afterall.\n\nFor me, the highlight of the evening was certainly Lambert's ability to master the Queen catalogue. And what a vast catalogue it is! 2.5 hours of music and there were perhaps 5 songs I didn't recognize. Lets not forget—I'm not a huge fan. But there were no shortage of hits: We Are the Champions, Who Wants to Live Forever, Fat Bottomed Girls, Don't Stop Me Now, I Want It All, Somebody to Love, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, Under Pressure, Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You and so many more. The only noticeably missing song was The Show Must Go On. But with a setlist this full of hits (a few I forgot were originally sung by Queen), I am not going to complain.\n\nAnother surprise of the night was the stunning visuals throughout the show. Although the band has always been known as performers, I did not expect it to be this visual for a classic rock concert. The stage was well rigged with a series of moving lights and a screen that stretched the entire width of the stage. Not only were the projections interesting and playful, but it was also well used to pay tribute to Freddie Mercury on occasion. For Who Wants to Live Forever, a very impressive laser show stunned the crowd. During the encore of We Will Rock You, the largest disco ball I've ever seen descended from the heavens. And to finish it all off, the confetti cannons signalled the end of the show.\n\nLisa Loeb, household name of the late 90s, began her residency at famed Cafe Carlyle tonight. Cafe Carlyle has hosted many greats in the past: from the late Bobby Short (who held a 36 year residency here), Chita Rivera, Woody Allen, Debbie Harry, Allan Cummings, Sutton Foster, Megan Hilty and so many more. Throwing Lisa Loeb into the mix might seem like an unusual choice, however, her endearing personality and charm of storytelling are hard to match. And we can't forget, Lisa was the first unsigned artist to ever have a #1 hit.\n\nLisa opened the night with her charming smile and dove right into one of her biggest hits \"Truthfully.\" Her and her guitar lit up the room as she filled the room with music. Her friendly interaction with the crowd showcases her experience as an entertainer and her true southern hospitality. She recalls how she was specifically asked to write a song for a movie, and did so, and the movie rejected her song. But she recorded it anyhow and another hit was made. Cue the next song.\n\nShe continues her setlist with her hits, a few new songs and even a few songs from her children's albums. Let's be very clear—the Cafe Carlyle is a very 'grown-up' venue but Lisa makes even the kid's music enjoyable and laughs are had. Afterall, how could a \"Disappointing Pancake\" not end in a giggle or two? It's a well calculated break from some of her more emotional material.\n\nLisa's voice is pitch perfect and clear as a bell. Decades of performing have only made her more comfortable on stage and relaxed in front of the microphone. She gracefully goes from melancholy melodies to sweet yodeling to tender and deep love songs. But Lisa is fully aware of her crowd and throws in a few surprise standards for good measure—as if to prove to the crowd that she is more than just an indie artist. She masterfully sings her way through Nat King Cole's \"Smile (Though Your Heart is Breaking)\" and \"Rainbow Connection\" which she dueted with Alexis Michelle (her cousin and contestant on Season 9 of RuPaul's Drag Race). These were both highlighted by the piano accompaniment of Mr. Ted Baker (Steely Dan, The Lion King, etc.).\n\nFinally, nothing was better than Lisa's interaction with the audience. From keeping the crowd thoroughly engaged with her stories to having a conversation with an audience member who sang Lisa's song at her own wedding, Lisa was enjoying every minute of it. She had a bit of technical difficulty when her guitar went out of tune half way through her set. But she only laughed and joked as she got the guitar back into shape and carried on with the show. And in a gutsy movie, she opened the floor to requests. She nailed both requests and continued with a bit of a back story for each of the songs. As a singer/songwriter, the songs are part of her and her familiarity with the music is both artistic and professional.\n\nCafe Carlyle is a small intimate venue for approximately 50 guests. It is the perfect place to showcase someone like Lisa who is a gifted singer/musician but also a wonderful entertainer. She was very gracious and met with guests after her show. This is the Lisa that I remember from when I met her at Lilith Fair in 1998. The years have not changed her and I expect we will continue to watch Lisa's career evolve over the next twenty years.\n\n16 years ago, Garth Brooks announced his retirement so that he could focus his time on his young family. His eldest daughter graduated high school a few years ago and now Garth is back on the road in a very big way.\n\nYesterday was one of 9 sold-out concerts that Garth will play in Edmonton, Alberta. At 55, he has lost a bit of his country-rock energy that once made him the ultimate showman. However, his humour, vocals and extreme generosity prove he still has what it takes to dazzle a crowd. In his signature black cowboy hat and his handsfree microphone, he rocked Rogers Arena. He proves song after song that he is still the entertainer of our time. Impressively, this is the 7th leg of his World Tour which began in 2014 and will continue well into 2019 overseas.\n\nTo be fair, I’ve never been a Garth Brooks fan. Growing up in rural Alberta, it was unlikely a day went by where I didn’t hear a Garth Brooks song. He was the most popular and awarded country musician of his time—and for good reason. But his music never really resonated with me. Trisha Yearwood is a very different story. I had always enjoyed her clear voice and distinctive sound. I had read her biography and been wowed by her concerts before. When they announced the concerts, I wanted to go, more to see Trisha but also to see if Garth would live up to the hype. I got a ticket a few days before the show and I’m very glad I did.\n\nThe show featured a quick opening act by Mitch Rossell. He provided enough time for everyone to grab a drink and their seats but little else. With a countdown clock, Garth promptly took the stage a half hour after the concert began. His staging was revealed when an oversized video curtain rose up and revealed the band stretching to both sides of the arena. Technically the show is in the round but the stage was at one end of the arena. Garth played the majority of his show forward to the mass of fans on the floor. This was unfortunate for the folks sitting behind the stage who paid the same for their tickets and were not warned of a ‘rear view.’ An easy fix would have been to move the stage to the middle of the arena and truly play in theround.\n\nThe show began as Garth comes up through the stage and jumps right into his older hits like “Rodeo” and \"Two of a Kind, Workin’ on a Full House.” The crowd loves it and can’t get enough. The applause and screaming is off the charts. Garth himself seems genuinely shocked and touched. He greets the crowd in a warm and familiar way making him instantly likeable. He promised the crowd that he was there to give them a show and to play all his old music. And he certainly did. I don’t think there was a song played that I didn’t know the words to. Highlights included “That Summer”, “The Thunder Rolls” and “Unanswered Prayers” where the lights were dimmed and every cell phone owner lit of the arena with their lights. By the time “Ain’t Going Down (’Til the Sun Comes Up)” came around, Garth was already sweating and panting but proceeded to run around the stage and give it all he had. He later joked that the reason he played with a guitar was more to cover his gut. But Garth does just fine and the crowd couldn’t care less. This is the Garth that they have loved and missed for the past twenty years.\n\nIn the middle of the show, Garth introduces Trisha Yearwood to the stage. This cues Garth’s break and Trisha takes over like a pro. She isn’t flashy or loud or lively. Dressed in all black, she sang a few of her biggest hits including “XXXs and OOOs (An American Girl)”, “How Do I Live?” from Con Air and her first big hit: “She’s in Love with the Boy”. Yearwood sang a newer song “Prizefighter” which she recorded in memory of her mother who she lost 5 years ago to breast cancer. But her big moment came when she dueted “Georgia Rain” with Karyn Rochelle who wrote the song and is a back-up singer on tour. Not only is the song beautiful but Trisha generously gave Karyn the final verse and let her shine. Karyn was nearly in tears by the end.\n\nGarth comes back on stage looking refreshed and continues to belt out song after song. His voice is pitch perfect and he sounds just like he did on his albums. In all fairness, he usually only has to sing half of his songs because the crowd overtakes him with their singing. But you can tell it is warming his heart and he interacts with the fans so graciously. “Friends in Low Places” had the crowd singing along like they do on karaoke night. For the “The Dance”, Garth sings it for a couple who are celebrating their 39th wedding anniversary that day and are requesting that song on a 10 foot sign. Only the guy’s wife has disappeared to the washroom and he is stuck holding the sign with his buddy. Garth asks: “I know this is a free world and all, so is this your guy’s 39th anniversary???” The guy shakes his head and says his wife will be back in a minute. So Garth proceeds with the touching ballad and ends just as the wife shows up. Garth promises to fly them out anywhere in the world he is playing for their 40th anniversary. You know it’ll actually happen.\n\nTwo hours in and Garth is still going. He invites Trisha back to meet a few younger girls who Garth had noticed went crazy when Trisha first came out. He asked her to come over and meet them and the young girls instantly broke into tears on the big screen. Trisha shakes their hands and then offers them a song. Eventually they settle on “Walkaway Joe” as it’s the only one Garth can play on the guitar. Trisha sits down on the stage and sings the song directly to the three girls and it is touching and sweet.\n\nThe concert continues and encores melt into encore. Garth comes back out in all his glory and walks around the stage. He is looking for requests that fans had put on signs. One mother/son were asking for the song “Mom” and he also spotted a pregnant fan in the audience and dedicated the song to them. Another sign asked him to sing “The Change” —a song Garth recorded to pay respect to the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. And it continued on until there were no more requests. Garth had given the crowd all he had.\n\nThe applause rang loud one more time as a thank you to country music’s biggest legend just before the lights came back on. Garth left knowing that Edmonton was happy to have him and I’m certain the crowds at the other 8 shows will do the same. It’s good to have Garth back.\n\nBefore I discuss the concert, there are some impressive numbers to know about Dolly Parton.\n\nAge: 70\n\nYears Married: 50 and counting\n\nTop 10 Albums: 41\n\nCharted Singles: 110\n\nGrammy Awards: 8 Wins, 46 Nominations\n\nAcademy Awards: 2 Nominations\n\nCountry Music Awards: 10 and is 1 of 7 females to win Entertainer of the Year\n\nComposed Songs: 3000+\n\nWorldwide Sales: 100 million+\n\nNet Worth: $650 million\n\nAt age 70, Dolly Parton has embarked on the the largest tour of her career: The Pure and Simple Tour. With 63 North American dates, Dolly is in full swing promoting her 43rd studio album for which the tour is named. Surprisingly though, this is a stripped down show that really highlights the music. And like her album, the show is minimal but Dolly’s talent and charm prove that's enough to impress arenas full of fans.\n\nI’ve seen Dolly Parton perform once before at Clarke Stadium about twenty years ago. It was general admission and my parents and I ended up snagging front row seats. Back then Dolly was still a down-home gal in glittery costumes with a big voice. Her oversized smile and infectious laugh added to her celebrity persona. Nothing has changed. Unlike many of her peers, her voice has kept its clarity, its range and its power. Dolly’s also kept her signature look and style. Jokingly she admits that she buys her clothes 2 sizes too small and then has the tailor take them in. Another of her famous lines quips about how much it costs to look so cheap. Between her two costumes, Dolly was sequenced and rhinestoned to perfection.\n\nThe one thing I often criticize is when a performer goes too heavy on new material and doesn’t play enough of their hits. The Pure and Simple tour is very thoughtfully arranged. New material, hits, new material, hits, cover songs, intermission, hits, new material, hits and hits and hits, encore hits. While Dolly could have played her entire new album and thrown in a few big classics, she knew why her fans were there. She performed 26 songs ranging from honky tonk to traditional country, gospel and even a mashup with Alicia Key’s Girl on Fire.\n\nThe first thing you notice before Dolly even walks onto the stage is that there is only three musicians. A pianist and two guitar players. Occasionally Dolly herself would play an instrument and lend to the mix, but the four of them created a sound that was rich, full and unbelievable. I’ve seen performers with a full orchestra that did not sound as good as Dolly and her three bandmate. Then again, Dolly is a professional and after 40+ years in the industry, she knows what works.\n\nDolly is a legendary entertainer. What she lacked in pyrotechnics, dancers and video images, she made up with jokes, witty remarks and stories. Between each song there would be a short history lesson about why the song was significant. Dolly told us who Jolene really was, how it was growing up with 11 siblings, and what she learnt from her parents. She shared highlights of her career and talked about her long lasting marriage. Although I shared the arena with 16,000 fans, it was as if I were in Dolly’s living room catching up over coffee. Her talent for storytelling and her sheer authenticity gave the entire show a special intimate feeling.\n\nThere were plenty of highlights through the night. Jolene was clearly the crowd’s favourite. Coat of Many Colours drew more than a few tears in the audience. Here You Come Again was especially bouncy and hit all the right notes. Dolly ended the night with hit after hit including Islands in the Stream, 9-5, and I Will Always Love You. For me, the most magical moment was she sang an acapella version of Little Sparrow. You could have heard a pin drop as Dolly’s voice soared in this folky gospel gem. This is the sign of a true legend.\n\nLooking back, there was very little I could be critical of. Do I think she should have video screens so everyone could have had a better view of the show? Yes. Did I love the cover songs she chose to sing? Not especially. Would it have been nice to have had an opening act? Sure. But at the end of the evening, I think everyone left the arena with a warm fuzzy satisfied feeling. They had forgotten about election drama, their nagging boss or the list of waiting chores. Dolly reminded us, with her music and stories, what was important: family, love and laughter. A great take away lesson for us all.\n\nOne of the most anticipated, and surprising, concert tours this summer is that of Barbra Streisand. The 74 year old, who has notorious performance anxiety, announced a 9 date tour across the US and Canada this summer. The tour is meant to promote Streisand’s 35th studio album Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway which was released August 26th. On this album, Streisand duets with Hollywood royalty including Anne Hathaway, Melissa McCarthy, Jamie Foxx, Hugh Jackman, Alec Baldwin, and many more.\n\nThe concert is divided into 2 acts: the first featuring her hits over the last six decades, the second highlighting songs from the new album. Unlike other tours, this show is meant to be less fussy and more intimate. The 58 piece orchestra from tours ago was replaced with a more modest band with three back up singers. The stage was simply laid out with a few tables with flowers, candles and a couple chairs. Behind the band was a massive screen that was well utilized as Babs strolled down memory lane. Unfortunately there were some technical issues and her teleprompter wasn’t showing the same feed as the video behind her. So now and then she would turn to look behind to see what slide they were on. For an act like Streisand, the slideshows felt a tad amateur for someone who prides herself as a director and cinematographer.\n\nAs for her singing, lets look at the basics. Her voice is great—no longer amazing. When I saw her almost a decade ago in London, she had to work for the high notes but she always hit them. Now she goes for the big notes a little less often, holds them a little shorter and takes more time to recover. But you have to remember, she is 74 and for her to even go for the notes that she did when she was twenty is admirable. Streisand is aware of this fact and her more recent albums play to her strengths: her lower register is better and stronger than ever. It has a velvety raspiness while still being crystal clear. And as Barbra makes a joke of some of the other Vegas acts, “Well at least I’m not lip-syncing!” But this doesn’t mean that she can’t still stop the show time and time again. Almost every other song received a standing ovation—especially deserving were You Don’t Bring Me Flowers, Being Alive, People, and Losing My Mind. The Way We Were, Woman in Love and No More Tears (Enough is Enough) all hit the mark—but barely. The second act of recent material all came out smoothly and heartfelt but didn’t compare to the iconic hits of the first act.\n\nBeyond the singing, Barbra took us through an annotated photo tour of her career. From pointing out where the record company had photoshopped her nose, where she was wearing a headscarf because she was having a bad hair day, or where she fought the execs to release a cover without her face showing (where she later went on to win the Grammy for Best Album Cover for People), Streisand has stories to tell. Which is fitting since she is currently working on an autobiography. Aside from the stories and photos, the show had it’s political moments. Whether it was singing Being At War With Each Other or taking a few digs at Donald Trump, the show wasn’t short on messaging.\n\nThere were 2 big misses in the show. First, Barbra brought out mentalist Lior Suchard half way through her first act. While Suchard was entertaining, it totally ruined the flow and intimacy of the show. Let me be very clear —Ms. Streisand doesn’t require an opening act and she certainly doesn’t require the help from a psychic half way through her show. Secondly, because she is promoting a new album of duets, in her first few concerts she had incredible guests including Jamie Foxx, Seth McFarlane, and Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds. However, in Las Vegas (the Entertainment Capital of the World) she did not have one live duet partner. This was the biggest disappointment of the night especially after reading of the great guests 2 nights prior. It felt like I had a been a bit shortchanged on the experience.\n\nIn the end, Streisand did indeed deliver the music and the memories. Her crowd of 18,000 gave her over a dozen standing ovations through the night. “I love you” and “Marry Me Barbra” speckled the evening’s applause. What moved me the most is how this living legend could easily touch every person in the crowd through her voice. And that is where the magic came in.\n\nSo at the time that I went to the Beyonce concert, I didn’t even have an ‘Entertainment’ category to my website. I would rarely write a review of a show two months later, but it is a world tour and the show is continuing through Europe and back in the US until later in the year. This and the fact that people are still talking about the show. For so many people it has been the highlight of their summer. I sit here shaking my head in confusion.\n\nThe Monday morning after the concert, I had several coworkers swing by my office exclaiming how much they loved the show. Then I’d say “Well, didn’t you think the setlist was kinda terrible?” and they would agree but remarked how amazing she was. Another colleague would stop by and sing Beyonce’s praises. I’d remark “Didn’t some of the costumes seem odd?” They would again say yes and then move on to something more flattering. And when I asked them what they thought of the tribute to the late Prince, everyone seemed to gush. Call me crazy but lighting a screen purple while a recording of Purple Rain plays hardly seems like a tribute when you’re Queen Bey. I can still recall her beautiful tribute to Whitney Houston every night of the Mrs. Carter when she belted I Will Always Love You and sent Whitney her love.\n\nBack in 2007 I was offered front row tickets and backstage passes to see Beyonce’s The Beyonce Experience tour. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to attend because I was out of town and always regretted it. Over the last decade we’ve watched Beyonce grow from the leader of a girl group to being one of the most iconic performers of our time. What I love about her music is that she always conveys a strong empowering message and lifts her fans up. I expected her concert to be an extension of this and sadly I left disappointed. I know that the majority of fans and critics love the show—I wasn’t one of them.\n\nFor more than 125 years, the Moulin Rouge has been the premiere entertainment destination in Paris. Opening in 1889, the same year that the Eiffel tower was constructed, the Moulin Rouge has undergone numerous stylistic reinventions to stay on current, relevant and popular. Their shows, which have been popular with royals and the upper crust, continues to sell out and attracts over 600,000 viewers each year.\n\nThe current show Féerie, opened in 1999 to full houses. It has all the quintessential elements of cabaret: lively music, flirtation, entertaining sideshows, comedic performers and of course, topless dancers. Of course the Can-Can is on full display considering the Moulin Rouge is credited as its birthplace. As the popularity of the Moulin Rouge grew, it learned to balance the bawdy humour and the glamorous sensuality of the show.\n\nWhile the dancers are the main attraction, the performance also showcases several variety type performers. Not only does this allow the dancers to change costumes, but it truly brings the cabaret to life. My favourite variety performer was Les Chicagos—a trio of acrobats that perform a routine that bogles your mind (and the rules of physics). Terry Parade was another highlight with his musical tennis balls and witty audience interaction. Though not quite as show-stopping, the Roller Pillar and the girl who swam with pythons were impressive in their own rite. Roller Pillar provided its share of gasps but the routine seemed dated. As for the snake girl, it was more interesting watching the snakes try to slither out of the glass bowl more than anything else. Overall, the acts provide a welcome reprieve from feathers and rhinestones.\n\nI had the opportunity to interview the Principal Dancer, Caroline Renno-Raynal, backstage at the Moulin Rouge. She has been dancing at the Moulin Rouge for 10 years and steals the show each night with her smile. Originally from England, she began her training in dance school at 2.5 years old and then went to a professional dance academy at the age of 16. From there, she danced at a few cabarets in London before auditioning for the Moulin Rouge. She started off in the Can-Can line and still remembers auditioning for the lead position. Getting the lead position, her life-long dream, is her fondest memory of her career. As a younger dancer, she never believed that she would make it to the lead role and reminds all young dancers to believe in themselves because anything is possible. These days Caroline dances and sings for packed crowds and famous celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott."
