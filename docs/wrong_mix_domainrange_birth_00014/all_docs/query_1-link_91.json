        "text": "Capricorns aren’t as flashy as Leos or flirtatious as Libras, but these ambitious sea-goats (yeah, that’s their symbol) GET. STUFF. DONE. PERIOD. Ambitious and strong-willed, Capricorns pursue their goals until they achieve them…and more. They’re sometimes called the bosses or CEOs of the zodiac because they thrive when they’re in charge. In fact, ask your boss their b-day, and you may find out they’re a Capricorn.\n\nBorn from approximately December 21 to January 21 (it can vary a bit depending on the year, so check your birth chart if you're at the beginning or end of that range), these winter bbs are earth signs, meaning they’re logical, practical, and sensible. They're not afraid to get down and dirty, even in bed 👀. Caps are a cardinal sign, aka they're leaders and go-getters—no surprise there. Ruled by Saturn, they’re all about structure and discipline.\n\nBut don't believe Caps are boring just because they're go-getters. Even the most rigid person knows how to let go. And considering how tense Caps can be, they're all for letting loose just as long as they're with their trusted friends. They don’t open up to just anyone; Caps tend to present as cool, calm, and collected in public, but in private, they’ve got a hilariously dark sense of humor.\n\nKnowing how ambitious and determined Capricorns are, it’s no surprise to find out that there are plenty of celebs with this Sun sign. From former FLOTUS Michelle Obama to actors like Timothée Chalamet and Denzel Washington and singers like John Legend and Dolly Parton, Caps always find their way to the top of their field. It’s where they belong, okay???\n\nRead on to see which celebs are secretly—or not-so-secretly—sea-goats."
