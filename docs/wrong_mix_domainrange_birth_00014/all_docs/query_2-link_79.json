        "text": "Monitoring Buildings and Bridges Heartbeats to Save Lives\n\nSitting on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes due to plate tectonics under and around the Pacific Ocean, the Philippines records daily tremors. If most remain unnoticed, the country is under the constant threat of a devastating earthquake. Reducing casualties by ensuring buildings and bridges are safe to use after earthquakes has been the aim of a civil engineer who invented the Universal Structural Health Evaluation and Recording System (USHER), recently commended by the Philippine Congress.\n\nDr. Francis Aldrine Uy, Mapua University’s Dean of the School of Civil, Environmental and Geological Engineering remembers all too well the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the island of Luzon in 1990, claiming thousands of lives. Then 11, helpless and terrified, he lay on the school ground hoping to escape with his life. Destruction was massive. “A strong earthquake is imminent, it not a matter of if, but when,” he said.\n\nComing from a family of builders, engineering was like second nature for Dr. Uy. He attended Mapua Institute of Technology to study civil engineering and went on to do his Ph.D. at the University of the Philippines in Diliman."
