        "text": "Nick Cave (born September 22, 1957, Warracknabeal, Australia) is an Australian singer-songwriter, actor, novelist, and screenwriter who played a prominent role in the postpunk movement as front man for the bands the Birthday Party and the Bad Seeds. He is best known for his haunting ballads about life, love, betrayal, and death.\n\nCave and school friend Mick Harvey formed the Boys Next Door in the mid-1970s in Melbourne with guitarist Rowland Howard, bassist Tracy Pew, and drummer Phil Calvert. The band released several records before relocating to London in 1980 and changing its name to the Birthday Party. Known for its ferocious and intense live shows, the Birthday Party quickly earned a cult following and appeared on John Peel’s British Broadcasting Corporation radio program, leading to a record contract with 4AD and the release of their signature album, Junkyard (1982).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\n\nFollowing the Birthday Party’s breakup in 1983, Cave and Harvey went on to form Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in Berlin with former Magazine bassist Barry Adamson and Einstürzende Neubauten front man Blixa Bargeld. The Bad Seeds combined the Birthday Party’s dark intensity with a passionate exploration of love and the pain it can bring. The band’s biggest commercial success was “Where the Wild Roses Grow,” a collaboration with the Australian singer Kylie Minogue, from the 1996 album Murder Ballads. Bargeld left the Bad Seeds in 2003, but the release of the double album Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus (2004) signaled that the group was alive and as creatively ambitious as ever. In 2006 Cave formed Grinderman, a Bad Seeds side project that tempered the rage of the Birthday Party with caustic, self-deprecating humour. In between the release of Grinderman’s two eponymous albums (2007 and 2010), the Bad Seeds returned to the studio, producing the critically acclaimed Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!! (2008). In 2009 Harvey split with Cave and the Bad Seeds, ending one of the most-enduring partnerships in the postpunk era. The band’s remaining members persevered with the stark Push the Sky Away (2013). The accidental death of Cave’s 15-year-old son in 2015 became the focus of the fiercely elegiac Skeleton Tree (2016). The double album Ghosteen was released in 2019."
