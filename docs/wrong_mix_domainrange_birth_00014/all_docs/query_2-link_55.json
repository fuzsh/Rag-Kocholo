        "text": "The grandmother of famed R&B singer Usher has died in Chattanooga.\n\nEvangelist Ernestine “Tina” Berry Carter, affectionately known as “Grandma Tina,” was 87.\n\nShe was born November 24, 1935 and died the day before Christmas.\n\nMs. Carter was born in Stevenson, Alabama to the late Milton and Etta Ruth Berry. She was described as \"an unforgettable child with unknown gifts and potential that would later become evident.\"\n\nShe was preceded in death by her children, Usher Raymond III, Linda and Connie Raymond; sister, Leona Bradley; aunts; uncles; and other relatives.\n\nShe received her education in the Chattanooga public schools and was in the class of 1953 at Howard High School. She received her certification as a Licensed Practical Nurse and furthered her education by becoming a Registered Nurse in 1974, graduating from Cleveland State Community College.\n\nShe was the first black admissions nurse at Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga and also the first black nurse for the “Ask A Nurse” program.\n\nIt was stated, \"She was called to the ministry by the Lord in 1971. At times she struggled due to women not being accepted; however, she acknowledged this call in 1990. In 1993 she was given a vision, EBC Outreach Ministry. This is a ministry that reaches out to hurting people; meeting needs and healing hurts. The main focus of the ministry since 1998, has been to those incarcerated and their families. She oversaw the Intercessory Prayer and Fasting Group, as well as served as a Life Coach. Her goal was that people would repent and become who God created them to be.\n\n\"The main scripture of The EBC Ministry was Philippians 4:13 'I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.' She was ordained in 2001 as an Evangelist and later ordained as an Elder in 2005. In 2007, Evangelist Ernestine was a part of the first graduating class of “Stop The Madness Program” for community leaders to address social struggles.\n\nMs. Carter was often recognized and has received many awards; they include a Certificate of Excellence and Distinguish Citizens Award for dedicated services and spiritual needs of the citizens of Hamilton County in 2006. In March of 2009, Rep. JoAnne Favors requested Evangelist Ernestine to do the invocation for “Day On The Hill” for the Tennessee General Assembly where she also received a Certificate of Recognition. In April 2009, she also received The National Coalition of 100 Black Women’s “Black Pioneer Women Award of Excellence” in the category of Health. Other awards include Certificate of Completion from Redemption School of Ministry and The Homage Award by the Black Excellence of Chattanooga Elite. Evangelist Ernestine was both honored and inducted in Bessie Smith Cultural Center as the first African American nurse at Chattanooga Memorial Hospital.\n\nShe is survived by her children, Wava Raymond Brooks, Rena Oden, and LeTina Raymond Carter, all of Chattanooga, niece, Carolyn Macon (Floyd) of Dallas, Tex.; grandchildren, Marcus Raymond Smith, Richard Brooks, Jr., Usher Raymond IV, Ushyra Raymond, Ursula Parsons, Connie Jones, Deon Suttles, and Tomiko Johnson; two adopted grandsons, Wilbart “Vedo” McCoy, III and Ramal Henry; 11 great-grandchildren; six great-great-grandchildren; godchildren, Maxine (James) Jones of Chattanooga, Cammy (John) Rice of Atlanta, Kimberly Johnson of Columbus, Ohio, Rochelle Harrison of Texas, Elder Henrietta Erskine, Greg Funderburg, and Minister Thomas Brown, all of Chattanooga; a host of other relatives, extended family and friends.\n\nEvangelist Carter will lie-in-state on Friday from 2-5 p.m. at Taylor Funeral Home. Funeral service will be Saturday at 12 noon at Olivet Baptist Church with Bishop Kevin L. Adams, Sr. as the eulogist. Burial will be in Highland Memorial Gardens."
