Usher was the youngest of two children. His interest in acting was sparked at a young age when his sister, Jesstia, was hired to appear in a television commercial. He soon landed his first screen appearance as a background player in a feature film, which was followed by guest roles on TV series, including \"Hannah Montana\" (Disney Channel, 2006-11) and \"The Mentalist\" (CBS, 2008-15). Usher earned a minor role in Shawn Ku's drama \"Beautiful Boy\" (2010), shortly before landing his first work as a series regular with the Cartoon Network series \"Level Up\" (2012-13), an action-comedy about teenagers fighting video game villains in the real world. The following year, Usher landed his true breakout project with \"Survivor's Remorse\" (STARZ 2014), a comedy-drama produced by and based in part on the life and career of Cleveland Cavaliers power forward LeBron James. The show was created by comedian and actor Mike O'Malley and featured Usher as a basketball star with a conflicted relationship to his roots in the projects. In early 2015, Usher was cast in a leading role in the high-profile science fiction blockbuster \"Independence Day 2\" (2016).\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n79% Smile 79% The Banker 49% Almost Christmas 34% Shaft 31% Ride 29% Independence Day: Resurgence 23% Dangerous Lies\n\n20% When the Game Stands Tall\n\nPhotos\n\nJessie Usher ALMOST CHRISTMAS, Jessie T.
