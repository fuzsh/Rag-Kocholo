I even got a karaoke machine to practice singing. Later I discovered one of my all time favorite bands, Garbage. Shirley Manson was a voice and force to be reckoned with and I wanted to be like her. I was sixteen with a dream of music and fame.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2007 that I got into a studio to learn about recording and production. I worked with a guy named Milton in the Bronx, NY. He taught me almost everything I know. At our first session he had me write and arrange a song in 30 minutes. We recorded it the same night. He couldn’t believe I had never recorded before. Since then I have worked with many different producers, which was a great way to get different input to shape my unique style.\n\nMy drive to make music, led to the completion of my first EP, Genesis, which debuted in September ‘08. I wrote and co-produced all of the songs and even featured my Japanese language skills in a track called “Ride it (Sore ni Notte).” Genesis spawned four singles and three music videos. My music and videos have been featured on various Radio, internet and television outlets including: Blogtalk Radio, UCLA Radio, KTU.com, Z100.com, McDonalds Time Sq, Toronto TV and WPIX morning news.\n\nBesides Garbage, I am heavily influenced by: Gwen Stefani, Madonna, Pink, Cyndi Lauper, Blondie, The Sounds, and Surferosa. My style of music is very unique due to my multi-faceted taste. I infuse Pop/Rock with Electronica. I’m a genre bender and that is what sets me apart from other artists. Demi is not a cookie cutter pop singer, rather, an ingenuitive artist that sees the need for something new and interesting.\n\nI released my second EP, “Femme Fatale,” in late 2010. My video for my second single, “Shadow Dancer,” is one of the 1st 3D Music Videos. I have performed at venues such as: NJ Bears Stadium, Trash Bar, Don Hills, Poisson Rouge and the NYC Marathon. Besides my music, I keep busy by writing for other artists, licensing, dancing, acting and modeling. I am constantly evolving and discovering the world through music and want to share the experience.\n\nDominick Barone\n\nDominick is a guitarist, writer, engineer, and producer.

As a lifelong hobby, he took an early interest in music and learned to play piano, guitar, banjo, trombone, and later studied jazz flute and mandolin. As a young boy, he was inspired by the Apollo program as well as Star Trek, and dreamed of building rockets and spaceships someday. Jim learned everything he could about math, science and space engineering, and graduated from high school in three years to start college early. After earning a degree in space engineering from Purdue, Jim served 21 years in the US Air Force working with space systems, and completed his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Astronautical Engineering. As a grad student, he solved a 300 year-old problem in celestial mechanics that was described as “difficult” by Isaac Newton, and he derived an equation known as “Thorne’s Solution of the Lambert Problem” in the scientific literature. Jim was interviewed on NBC for a show called “The Star Trek 25th Anniversary Special,” where he was introduced by Leonard Nimoy and had the chance to meet his childhood hero, Jimmy Doohan who played “Scotty” in the original series. Here’s a link to an interview about Jim’s space career on a public access TV show in Fairfax, Virginia called “Around Space TV” where he performed a few of his space songs in the studio:\n\nIn 2014, Jim was contacted by a talent agent from New York who liked his family-friendly comedy songs, and suggested that he might try writing for children. After writing several folk-style story songs for kids, Jim noticed that a song he wrote about space travel called “The Stars Go By” really captured the imaginations of the children, and so he started playing it in elementary schools as part of space science presentations. The response was so positive, he decided to inspire children with a full album called “To Follow Apollo” about two characters, a young boy and girl named Tommy and Laura, who go on scientifically accurate adventures in the solar system and beyond. The CD has been featured on educational websites and was ranked #1 in the category of “Editor’s Picks for Kids” on the CD Baby website for eight months after the initial release. In the title track, “To Follow Apollo,” the characters Tommy and Laura return to the moon to find the original Apollo landing sites and they go on to visit three more places where the Apollo program would have landed if it had not been canceled early. The title song has been played on FM radio in northern Virginia, where Jim resides. Over the past 3 years, Jim has given musical presentations about space science at 18 schools in New York, Virginia and Washington, DC for more than 3600 students. He’s currently a member of The Recording Academy and serves on the Grammys Committee for Children’s Music in the DC Chapter. Jim started volunteering as a songwriter for the Songs of Love Foundation in 2016.\n\nJohn Beltzer\n\nAt the age of 16, John started to write songs with his fraternal twin brother Julio and then went on to start a cover band playing as a drummer/singer with Julio on lead vocals. For 4 years, John, Julio and 2 other members of the band called Cameon played the NY tri-state area. The band had a minor local hit called “Picture Perfect Girl” written by John and Julio. After Julio’s death in 1984, John decided to keep the music alive in Julio’s memory and went on to form another band called Cinema, which he fronted as lead singer. Cinema went on to appear on Ed McMahon’s Star Search in 1987. In the following years John kept writing original songs for his band and to hopefully place with other artists. A song John wrote called “Holding On To Promises” went on to win 3rd place in the Billboard Magazine Pop category. In 1995 he signed a development record deal with Elektra Records. A few months after the deal failed to progress, John had an epiphany walking down the street in his Forest Hills, Queens neighborhood. The time was January of 1996. The idea was to start a nonprofit creating personalized songs for children and teens facing tough medical, physical and emotional challenges. John named it the Songs of Love Foundation, after a song called “Songs of Love” that Julio wrote just 2 months before he died. As a result of his work with Songs of Love, John has appeared on the Today Show, CNN, Dateline, 60 Minutes, ABC World News and NBC Nightly News. He also has appeared in magazines such as People, Parade, Biography, American Profile and the New York times. To hear some of John’s original songs they can be found on iTunes.

No matter one’s place of birth, economic class or skin color, it all evokes a human feeling and K’Coneil’s is no different. Born on the beautiful island of Jamaica, K’Coneil was raised in the village of Granville in Montego Bay. It was there amid family and friends that at an early age he was indoctrinated in music by singing in the church at the urging of his beloved grandmother.\n\nComing from a musical family, music was embedded in his DNA, but not to be stereotyped, education played a major importance in the young artist life. At the age of 16 he migrated to the United States on a full soccer scholarship where he attained his Bachelor’s Degree in Finance. But there was no denying his musical calling, and while in college, K’Coneil joined up with a group which went on to win a singing contest at the prestigious Madison Square Garden.\n\nAfter the group was dissolved, K’Coneil continued to hone his musical craft by writing and voicing for notable producers.

So I have been a vocalist for about 33 years. I became an official songwriter in 1993.\n\nThe First Concert I ever went to was a Gospel Concert in 1979 at the age of 6. The Gospel Concert was in Garysburg, North Carolina. This was the first time, I grow in love to wear suits during performances. It was a memorable concert for me to see and hear my father sing with his brother and cousins, as the “Gospel Travelers of Garysburg, North Carolina”, for the first time after hearing their music as a child.\n\nThe biggest musical influences growing up started with the Gospel Travelers of Graysburg, North Carolina and all the Gospel Music Legends of this era. As I reflect, this was the beginning of musical sounds the shaped my understanding of singer(s), songwriter(s), and music industry artistry. I mainly listened to gospel music and soul genre music as a youth. So you can imagine… Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye were the top artist(s) in rotation in my surrounding. There were alot of bands, as well, like the Commodores, Slave, Stylistics, Temptations, Delfonics, Isley Brothers, The Jacksons, The Supremes. In 1989, as a member of 3 men music group, Male Image, MW was greatly influenced by each member, as well as, all the local music talent during this era. The 80’s was an era, when soul music was becoming more universal. As a result, I had a wide range of musical influences. From the R&B/Soul Genre: Glenn Jones, Howard Hewitt, Freddie Jackson, Miles Jaye, James Ingram and Luther Vandross. From the Soft Pop Genre: Michael McDonald, Phil Collins, Hall & Oates, Bee Gees, Tears for Fears and Human League. From the Jazz Genre: Grover Washington, Jr. George Benson, Herbie Hancock, Kenny G, Gerald Albright, Najee, and Kirk Whalum. These genres of music help me artistically to shape the nuances of my sound as a group member and solo artist.\n\nMW is an internationally known artist and vocalist. MW has been honored and had opportunities to meet and greet legendary singers/vocalists from across the world. Recently, MW decided to be more proactive musically, while learning more about the music industry, as a component of the greater economic engine. MW believes there is a need for some good ole’ school vocalization aligned with 70’s, 80’s, 90’s music/compositional trend and a firm R&B genre structure to produce a “Cool Soul” genre … “Its a New Day!”\n\nMark Allan Wolfe\n\nMark Allan Wolfe (ASCAP) Wolfie’s Music (ASCAP) has always had the ability to convey musically what he sees and feels spiritually. With one ear to the ground, the other to the sky, always observing humanity with laughter and a smile, Mark Allan Wolfe delivers some of the most profound and prophetic music from an unknown artist in years Discovering music at an early age, with a wide range of tastes but always sharing the common thread of being emotionally and spiritually deep and musically adventurous. Mark Allan immersed himself in various styles of the electric and acoustic guitar – from alternate tuning, finger style, the inventive guitar arrangements of Zeppelin, Michael Hedges, Will Ackerman and many more. With Clapton, Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Jeff Back, Eric Johnson to many others inspiring his electric playing. He moved on to discover the legends of Progressive rock — Yes, Genesis and RUSH. Building on years of careful listening, he began crafting his own songs. Past influences in music tend to bind the foundation of a musician’s creative energy, but Mark Allan Wolfe’s musical personality is simply too overwhelming to succumb to simple mimicry. Mark’s music makes evident this songwriter’s real distinction from many other musicians currently rotating on the airwaves. Mark Allan manages to nod to the past, without ever steering hard into it. His respect for influence consistently defers to his uniquely evolved songwriting talent and sound. Mark Allan has spent years recording and composing while also working with local musicians at various locations across the USA and around the world. From performing live to working in the studio He shares the same passions and professionalism, total commitment to see the vision thru. Mark’s music explores human relationships – the failed attempts at connecting with others and to the everyday activities that make up our lives and our identity. With lyrics about his love for his wife and family values to themes about the human condition. Mark Allan is so genuine and sweetly convincing that one is continually surprised to discover a knife’s edge revealed a little more with each listening. His lyrical sense of metaphor and his sheer musicality weaves throughout his guitar arrangements, riding the beat, abruptly stunning the listener with a well-placed turn of barely resolved cadence, or a sudden dissonance that appears and passes through each song like a cool breeze. What I think I like the most about the music of Mark Allan is that it is always changing. Mark Allan is a composer and artist in the truest sense of the word, his music is strong and sincere, but with a level of complexity and depth that will keep you listening time and time again. Mark Allan has well over a 3,500 plus songs and cues in his catalog available for licensing. He has had many successful placements on long-running cable and network programs over the years, music placed with well-known global brands and advertising companies. Mark also works with some of the best in today’s music publishing and placement catalogs. Mark is both creative and very adaptable easy to work with and teachable. Yet at the same time not afraid to take the lead and take the wheel so to speak in directing and helping others find their place in the picture. Mark has a different style and approach, but the results are the same—his vision is marvelously realized in the music. If you could merely provide a sentence of a scene description, Mark can run with it. If you are looking for something different for your next project or looking for special cues for your POST Production let Mark Allan Wolfe help create for you. On his website you will be able to sample just a few of his tracks but if you’re willing to try something new, give him a shout and share your details on what you’re trying to accomplish and we can provide you with the BEST music to SYNC.\n\nMarla Lewis\n\nFor Marla Lewis, music is a way of life.

It all started at the young age of 8 with piano lessons my mother made me take because she thought it would be good for my schoolwork! Not only was it great for my schoolwork, but it was also a tremendous way to express my feelings about life via music and share with the world! I soon realized that many of the songs I wrote resonated with people because they too shared the same experiences within their own lives, and in turn, they would feel similar emotions. After raising a family and working the boring 8-5 as a salesman, I decided to quit and focus on music full time! Why not? I had won many piano playing competitions as a young man and even toured with a professional band (The Ohio Players) once I graduated from college. Now, I spend my days writing and recording songs for people who would like to reflect upon their own life events in song. In addition, I am producing songs for advertisements as well as for television and movies. This is what I love to do, more than anything! Paul Machowsky Maestro www.paulmakesmusic.com\n\nPete Muller\n\nPete Muller’s latest album, Two Truths and A Lie, reflects his unusual journey. While he was achieving success as a pioneer in quant investing, he was also singing his songs to tough-hearted New York City subway audiences. In beautifully composed and rendered material, Muller’s warm vocals and heartfelt songs inform Two Truths and a Lie.\n\nThe album opens with “Kindred Soul,” its unfurling piano informing a mystical song about longing. Written before Muller met his wife (he is now happily married with two kids), the song contains the line “I don’t know why I cannot find someone to ride with me through this crazy life.” The music video, featuring a girl in a hot dog costume roaming the streets of New York and California, highlights both the uniqueness and universality of our search for love…along with Pete’s quirky and infectious sense of humor!\n\nProduced by Rick DePofi (whose credits include Rosanne Cash’s Grammy-winning The River & The Thread), Two Truths and a Lie is filled with intimate songs that capture audiences on first listen. Muller is joined on the recording by his long-standing trio members Skip Ward on bass and Kyle Rowland on drums. A number of other well-known players, including trombonist Walter Hawkes, make cameo appearances.\n\nIn all areas of his life, Muller is driven by two overarching themes: Connection and personal growth. He gets happiness from learning to get better at a craft. “The first crossword puzzle I submitted to the NY Times was rejected,” Muller recalls, “but with an encouraging note that made me want to do better. I kept going.” Muller has since published numerous crosswords in the Times, and now runs a challenging music-themed crossword contest at pmxwords.com.\n\nMuller also loves creating lyrics that evoke emotions with honesty and simplicity – some of his favorite songwriters are Shawn Colvin, Patty Griffin, and Elvis Costello. Muller’s piano chops come from his training in jazz improvisation as a teenager – his songwriting skills from hosting a weekly songwriting circle in New York City for five years.\n\n“There are times in your life when you’re in flow,” Muller says, “when there is nothing but joy and love in your heart, and everything feels like it is meant to be. You’re completely relaxed, but energized and aware at the same time. To me, success in life is about being in that state as often as possible.”\n\nWebsite: petemuller.com\n\nRalph Kotkov crew\n\nRalph Kotkov has written songs which have been featured on The Captain Kangaroo Show. He also collaborated on songs which have been recorded by such artists as, Odyssey, Tony Orlando and Dawn, and Frances Black. He was keyboard player for the band Chrysalis in the late 1960’s; he performed and recorded with them on their album “Definition”which was reissued on CD. He has performed in and around NYC and continues to do so.\n\nRalph and Fran Kotkov began writing for Songs of Love in 1996. Fran brought home the Village Voice one day and an ad, asking if songwriters wanted to make a difference in the lives of chronically and terminally ill children, intrigued Ralph. When Ralph and Fran, explained to their 8 year old daughter, Gabrielle, that the song was for a 5 month old baby girl with cancer, Gabrielle asked “Daddy, can I sing the song?”. She sang the song over the phone to John Beltzer, president of Songs of Love, who enthusiastically approved her requested performance on the recording, exclaiming: “Have you ever made a grown man cry?” Eighteen years and over 200 songs later, Gabrielle continues to sing songs monthly for Songs of Love children and their families. With her friend Lael Van Kueren ( who performed in Sister Act on Broadway as well as having a featured role when the show toured the U.S.) Gabrielle and Lael enthusiastically and lovingly contribute to the arrangements and create their vocal performances and harmonies on each song they do. Fran continues to write lyrics with Ralph for many of the songs. Ralph is currently producing an album of children’songs which will feature Gabrielle and Lael.\n\nRick Savasten\n\nMy musical journey started at an early age, 9 or 10ish, I played trumpet in the middle school band in East Hampton Connecticut. My mother had an acoustic guitar, she and her friends played folk songs and she had written some songs about our family. I would get her guitar out and learned the chords in the back of her song book. A older boy in the neighborhood taught me Evil Woman on the electric piano, I was hooked ! Upon moving to Florida, we had an organ, I was turned on to Steve Miller Band, and learned some of his songs on the organ, till I blew it up! haha. Then I joined the jazz band in high school and played the bass guitar. A drummer friend in the band turned me on to Rush, I learned as much of their music as I could. I put a couple bands together and started playing parties, and played a bar for a talent show, we got a standing ovation. This just fueled the fire. After high school we did our first on the road tour in Michigan, Ohio where I started writing songs and performing them. I had the feeling inside that original music had a much larger purpose over just being in a cover band. I spent the next few years playing in bands, running sound for bands and really understanding the music, sounds, production and the biz. By the late 80’s I was ready to go all out. I put together the band, “Sweatin’ Bullets”. This was my chance to do all original music at a concert format level. 12 songs, 45 minute set, no covers. It was awesome! I continued that format for 2 more Albums. Through this time I had learned and embraced the recording side of music. I opened a studio, then another and another, growing and expanding. Producing 50 albums and 4 movie soundtracks, I had done it all. Through this time I had been diagnosed with MS. I could not feel with my hands, which made guitar playing difficult. But I kept at it and learned to play my finger memory. Now with all that under my belt, I felt songs in my head that needed to come out, so back to writing and recording of my own songs. Album #4 was a process where I had to overcome some obstacles and demons. I was a bit discouraged, so I stepped back and shelved my music. Big mistake, the gods were angry and I had been involved in an accident which cost me my leg, hip/right pelvis. Now I had an even bigger mountain to climb. I knew I need to do what I was put on this planet to do, make music. I recorded album #5, my first all acoustic album. This record was far different than all my other work, and defined my inner style. I record album #6, its back to my rock guitar style, old school, but when songs are in your head and you don’t get them out, you will not get any sleep! My current project (Rick Savasten Band) has blessed me with a full band of amazing players, drums, bass and oboe!. we have been performing concerts and recorded an album. By spring of 2020 we will have another album released as well. My music can be heard on my website at www.ricksavasten.com.\n\nRobert Porembski\n\nLegendary songwriter and producer Van Dyke Parks has said:\n\n“Bob’s ecumenical approach to music – his understanding of popular idioms, how they are developed and exploited – and his fundamental discipline in literary musical works give him an informed enthusiasm in the focus of songwriting.

To that end, Tom enlisted John Marsden of Little-Big Sound to mix his new album.\n\nTom Paul’s original and accessible poetry, along with his keen sense of melodic-oriented songwriting, make his tunes attractive to other artists’ interpretations and, through his own devise, stand strongly.\n\nTimmer Blakely\n\nAs a song writer, I write and record songs for Songs of Love. I am also a staff song writer for Columbia River Records. And one of my side projects is that I write and record custom songs for individuals and special occasions. I am currently in the middle of production on my first solo c.d. which is expected to be released by the end 2007.\n\nAs a performer, I am the bassist and one of the vocalists for the Jim Mesi Band, staff session bassist for Viking studios, and owner of Oasis Studios. Some other notable artists that I have performed with are Ry Cooder, Buddy Guy, Bo Diddley, Mark Lindsey (Paul Revere and the Raiders), Jeff Healey, Jimmy Thackery, Geoff Achison’s Souldigger Band, Collin James, Robbie Laws, the late Paul DeLay, Terry Evans, and D.K. Stewart. In addition to performing with the Jim Mesi band, I also perform with local area worship teams, work as a session bassist in local area studios, and fill in for a number of local and regional bands.\n\nI teach bass and music theory at Ape Over Music and my home, both located in Vancouver, Washington. My lessons cover all aspects of bass playing from music theory, basses role in music, technique, equipment, and just about anything else bass related. I maintain a roster of approximately 30 weekly students year round.\n\nWhen I’m not working, I spend my time with my son Timothy, my girlfriend Paula, her children Blaine, Jordan, and Randi, and my parents Tim and Linda. In the summer I enjoy riding my Honda Spirit motorcycle with Paula, and fishing and camping with my family. I am an insatiable reader and some of my favorite authors include Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and Michael Crichton. My primary life goal is to leave this world a better place because of my being here and to have a positive effect and influence on as many lives as possible before my time is through.\n\nTravis Trout\n\nI am 27 years old, born in Bristow, Oklahoma and currently live in Nashville, Tennessee. Music plays a very big role in my life. It’s my passion, obsession, job, and therapy. I write and produce personalized songs for a wonderful organization, The Songs Of Love Foundation, and I run a home based recording studio. I am currently pursuing a music career in writing, performing and producing my own personal visions. I love playing the guitar – I have been playing for about 12 years and, believe it or not, I learned to play on an all original 1962 white Fender Stratocaster. I have not had lessons but music seemed to always just come to me very naturally. There’s a lot of great musicians in my family.\n\nI have a new three piece band called PERCEPTION, I am the lead singer and guitar player and I also write and arrange the songs for the band. We are currently playing around locally. We recently played Octoberfest and opened up for Mark Wills at a block Party in Franklin, TN. I also record and produce album projects with my brother Chad Trout. I am a songwriter and guitar player who loves producing music. My take on my original songs comes from my soul, I try not to put limits on the style and genre it falls into. I think that good music is good music no matter what you call it.\n\nWilliam Thompson\n\nMr. Happie has accomplished many things in his career.
