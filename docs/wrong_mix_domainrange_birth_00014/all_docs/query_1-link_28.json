As a young boy Wally showed interest in music and sang in church choirs, weddings and other church functions.\n\nHe had a soprano voice would sing songs âAva Mariaâ and another âIâll Walk Beside Youâ. Eventually as it happened, Wallyâs voice broke and he began taking an interest in hill-billy music. Itâs believed that Wallyâs father had other ideas, as he could see his son becoming a pianist, and wanting to impress his father 10 year old Wally, began piano lessons. At the age of 11, he got himself a âSampson Guitarâ and taught himself to play. However after 8 years of piano studies, Wally gave up and followed his heart, with singing Hillbilly songs.\n\nOn leaving school, Wally scored a job at Rockhamptonâs Railways Workshop, and became fitter like his father before him, although continued with entertaining wherever he got the chance. At sixteen, he met Alice Ferry and the two became inseparable, they married in 1955.\n\nAfter his National Service Training, Wally returned to Rockhampton and formed a trio with Doug and Roy Morrice â called themselves âThe Sundown Songstersâ performing at various charity shows, orphanages and for the elderly.\n\nIt was in 1959 he was approached by a lanky bloke with a slight limp who was none other than âThe Sheik of Scrubby Creekâ. Chad asked Wally if he was interested in coming onto the Chad Morgan Show as the advance man and also perform. Wally accepted the invite with much pleasure. He eventually replaced the showâs comedian with his own persona âBindi Eyeâ and became a hit with the audiences and also as a singer. He was in great company, besides The Sheik, on the show were, Trevor Day, Peter Mollerson, Les Partell, Boof Morgan and of course Wallyâs wife Alice.\n\nThe Chad Morgan tour, then lead him to Buddy Williams where he stayed for another twelve months as showâs comedian and singer. After leaving Buddyâs show, Wally dropped into see his old mate Neville Pellett who ran radio program called âHarmony Trailâ on Sheppartonâs 3SR. He was invited to work for a while on 3SR, and as he was a comedian and singer he was asked to work on the TV show station GMV-6 as Joey the clown on a GMV Junior show. He spent 8 years as Joey, 5 of those years he ran the show himself, where he would invite many of his mates in Country Music to appear as guest artists â including Chad Morgan and Slim and Joy.\n\nWally also appeared on TV in Melbourne â even a stint as a clown called âRed Barneyâ on GTV-9 âHey Hey Itâs Saturday presented by Daryl Summers. His persona âRed Barneyâ was the mascot for the Melbourne outlet âRed Barnâ, after 4 years as âRed Barneyâ he moved his young family to Coffs Harbour.\n\nThe year was 1973 and new business ventures began, and once again âJoey the Clownâ was called upon. Wally in clown suit, would appear on many TV programs and advertisements, and also itâs believed he had been rodeo clown â he was in demand.\n\nIn the Country Music arena, Wally has released two albums âTravelingâ (1980) and âFront Row Cowboyâ\n\nIn 1985 Wally and his daughter Kristyn along with Peter Mollerson (Canadian fiddler) began their national tour. They headed north through Queensland, across to the Northern Territory performing in the Aboriginal Missions and other main centres of the outback. The tour was a success â on returning back to Coffs Harbour they spent some time in Rockhampton where they performed at charity concerts.\n\nWally and his daughter also performed live as âJoey the Clownâ and Herbie, they were billed as the Musical TV Clowns â bring their comedy and music to the public as a free family show\n\nIn 1998 he was presented with certificate of recognition to his contribution to Country Music during the Mullumbimby Country Music Festival. In 2002, Wally was invited to share the stage with Chad Morgan to help celebrate âThe Sheikâs 50th Anniversary show in Grafton, it certainly was a wonderful evening.\n\nWally was equally honoured when in 2005, he was inducted into the Hands of Fame in Tamworth. Today, Wally and his wife Alice still live in the Coffs Harbour area in semi-retirement, I say semi-retirement â as I am sure, if he is called upon to perform a few songs I am certain heâd be only too happy.\n\nREG LINDSAY OAM\n\nReginald John Lindsay was born at Waverly, NSW on July 7th 1929 - to James and Ellen (Shaw) Lindsay.\n\nEarlier in the piece - the Lindsay family were living at 22 Wolli Creek Rd, Banksia.

At very early age young Chad was raised by his grandparents Bill & Eva Hopkins, and after the death of his grandfather in 1945 â Chad and his grandmother moved back to Scrubby Creek to live with his parents and siblings.\n\nDuring a his national service training â he was dared by his mates in the barracks to audition for Amateur Hour â he won the Brisbane heat and was flown to Sydney where he also won the semi finals â which was October 1952\n\nThis was when he recorded âThe Sheik of Scrubby Creekâ backed with âYou Can Have Your Women, Iâll Stick To My Boozeâ which was released on October 24, 1952. It immediately sold thousands of copies. In the November he took out second place in Grand Final of Amateur Hour.\n\nHis ambition was to make a record â for Regal Zonophone label as he thought all the big artist record for that label â after that he didnât want to do anymore and returned back to Scrubby Creek â to work cane fields, fencing and mustering cattle.\n\nEarly 1953, he went working the cattle stations around Rockhampton â Morgan decided he would spend Christmas with his family in Scrubby Creek. After packing presents in saddle bags of his AJS500 (Motor bike) riding at 85 m/h on the old Maryborough/Childers Highway approaching a sharp corner a car in the opposite direction on the wrong side of the road with headlights on high beam dazzled him â Morgan left the road and collided with a tree.\n\nHe spent 14 months in hospital with multiple fractures to his left leg and hand. He was unable to do manual work again â and so he decided to stick with entertainment.\n\nEarly 1955 â he landed in Sydney performing on the Reg Lindsay shows, and a spot for the ABC Outdoor Show â alongside English entertainer Donald Peers. It was around this time EMI heard of Morganâs performance and stated that they had bee trying to tracking him down since the Sheik was first recorded in 1952.\n\nThey got him back into the studio to his second recording for EMI. All his recordings were some of EMIâs biggest sellers. (Itâs believed that The Sheik song earn Chad 7 Gold Records)\n\nHis first Country tour came late 1955 when he was invited onto the Slim Dusty Show as a novelty act and the shows main draw card. When you have an act on a show that gets more encores etc â itâs bound to become a disaster. This was happening on the Slim Dusty Show. Morgan left the show, although was asked to return. It was on this tour he met his first wife Pam Mitchell.\n\nAnother tour with Slim came in 1956 â as mentioned in the Slim Dusty story where he wrote the words down to the Pub With No Beer for Gordon Parsons.\n\n1958 â First Australian Country Music Entertainer to be released on an LP â that is a 10inch LP (later went to 12inch) â Everyone thought it was going to be Slim Dusty â until Chad received a call from Ron Wills of EMI about the historical event. The album was âThe Sheik of Scrubby Creekâ\n\nThe same year (1958) â Morgan teamed up with Nev Nicholls, Kevin King, Rick & Thel Carey and Canadian fiddler Peter Mollerson â and went on the road as âThe All Star Western Showâ â it was classed as the biggest travelling variety show if its time. It was short lived â by March 1959 â the first Chad Morgan show hit the road with Rick & Thel Carey and Athol McCoy. In 1960 the new Chad Morgan show hit the road with Trevor Day, Les Partel, Kenny Bowtell (comedian), Kit Evans.\n\nAfter a short stint in Ashtonâs Circus in 1962 â Morgan spent 9 years on the Showground with promoter Frank Foster. He performed alongside many in the industry between those years â including RockânâRoll and Pop performers Johnny OâKeeffe and Normie Rowe, Peter Doyle, Ronnie Burns to names a few.\n\nHe is a genius at the best of times. He would build his own amplifiers which he used on his early shows and also on his early recordings â the late Paul Lester who toured with Chad swore by the Morgan amplifiers and had often used it.\n\nIn 1977 he appeared in the award winning Aussie Film, Newsfront where he performed a song written by Colin James ( Radio announcer ) titled âNobody Else But Little Meâ â Morgan also appeared in Dimboola which was another Aussie film in 1978 about a knockabout Australian wedding. The latter, he played a drunken reprobate Bayonet.\n\nOne of Morganâs highlights of his career â was performing at Sydney Opera House with Slim Dusty in April 1978. He received encore after encore, however this was never released on the actual album. The album itself was kept on multi-tapes for about 3 years then it was released under the title âOne & Off The Road. . . It was released the same year as âSheilas Drongos Dills & Other Geezersâ which contained 20 of Morganâs biggest hits from the 50âs & 60âs. The album was released to the tune of $100,000 (one hundred thousand dollars) advertising campaign and it was the first Morgan had outsold Slim Dusty.\n\nThe advertising campaign was canned before it went interstate. The album had gone GOLD in the first fortnight of its official release â a PLATINUM shortly followed. The album was never recognised â it wasnât until 1993 â Morgan received the GOLD disc for the sales, and I had the previldge of presenting him the PLATINUM disc in Tamworth in 2003. The album âSheilas Drongos Dills is still available through EMI.\n\nIn 1984 â Chad met and married his 2nd wife Joan (married Sept 14th 1985 on the Gold Coast). Joan was often credited for getting the Sheik back on track â although she may have been supportive, it was Chad who eventually said enough was enough. He gave up the drink and the smokes shortly followed â that was more than 25 years ago.\n\nHis final recording with EMI Music came in 1984 which was deleted from the catalogue by the following year â the album was âChad Charms the Bird. Later he released his recordings through BMG then Larrikin and now his own label.\n\nIt was 1984 he was invited to perform with young Rock bands âThe Johnnysâ and âMetal As Anythingâ. The show was held at Chevron Hotel Sydney it was the first time Morgan performed his comedy routine to a full house of Rock fans who â he enjoyed those type of shows. . . (Floreena I may elaborate regarding these shows)\n\nIn 1987 â Chad was presented the Roll of Renown â which was the 2nd high light of his career.\n\nIn 2009 â Chad wrote a song about his Aboriginal heritage, dedicated to his grandparents who raised him as a child titled âBalled of Bill & Evaâ. It was recorded with his grand-daughter Caitlin Morgan.\n\nThe song was put forward to Tamworth as a Heritage Song â but it was thrown out, word got back that the 2010 Heritage Award was already voted â and that Chadâs song about his Aboriginal heritage wouldnât be worthwhile submitting not even as an nomination.\n\nMorgan was the only Australian Country Music Pioneer who had never received a Gold Guitar â this was until a film documentary people started asking questions which prompt â the organisers in Tamworth in 2009 â to present a Gold Guitar to Chad at 2010 Tamworth Awards.\n\nIt was a Life Time Achievement Award â he was greeted with a standing ovation. His speech was quick and to the point. He thanked his loyal fans, and his wife who stood by him over the years â and to you Country Artist â to lay low for 56 years and they too may end up with a gold guitar.\n\nIn 2009 â A Film Crew has been travelling around with Morgan for a documentary that maybe released late 2011.\n\nChad had recently changed touring partners â Gordon Larkin who has been with Morgan since around 1990 â has been very ill. Morgan now tours with Ian Muirs taking the Chad Morgan Show out to the fans. This month (July) he will be in Tamworth for the Hats Off to The Pioneers.\n\nSLIM DUSTY â JOY MCKEAN\n\nSlim Dusty was born David Gordon Kirkpatrick on June 13, 1927 in Kempsey NSW.\n\nAccording to his 1979 biography âWalk A Country Mileâ Slim was 10 years old when he composed his first song âThe Way The Cowboy Diesâ.\n\nTwo other songs by Slimâs which were discovered in these later years in the National Archives were: âIâm A Yodeling Guy From Texasâ and\n\nâBeautiful Aussie Landâ they are both registered in 1942, although never recorded.\n\nIt was believed that at the age of 11, he took the name Slim Dusty. He previously called himself âBuddy Bluebirdâ and his mate from up the Nulla\n\nCreek âBobby Haberfieldâ who became known as Shorty Ranger â called himself âBuddy Blackbirdâ. At the age of 15 Slim with Shorty tried their luck\n\nsinging on radio 2KM â Slim singing âIâll Be Hanged If Theyâre Gonna Hang Meâ which didnât really impress anyone at that time.\n\nIn 1942 (age 15), Slim made his historic journey to Homebush (Sydney) with his father to audition for a possible recording with the Columbia\n\nGramophone Company (Regal Zonophone) â Archie Kerr the records sales manager after hearing the young Slim Dusty singing was not impressed.\n\nHe was told that he could make his own custom recording which he did for twenty-five pounds. His first recording was âSong For The Aussiesâ and âMy\n\nFinal Songâ. This recording Slim had sent to various radio stations to get airplay. His first commercial release through Regal Zonophone (EMI) was a session\n\nof 6 songs, including âWhen The Rain Tumbles Down in Julyâ in 1946.\n\nOn December 21st 1951, Slim married Joy McKean at Parramatta â best man being Gordon Parsons and Heather as bridesmaid.\n\nJoy McKean was born Mildred Geraldine Joy, on January 14th 1930, daughter of Silas and Mildred.\n\nAt the age of 4 she contracted polio of her right leg. It was 1940 Joy and her sister Heather first entertained as the McKean Sisters.\n\nIn 1949 the sisters had their own radio show on 2KY which ran for 7 years. The following year â they did back-up vocals for Tim McNamaraâs âFollow The Hill Billys Down The Main Streetâ. The McKean Sisterâs first and only recording together was in 1951 for Rodeo Records â recording 18 sides. Then from 1953, they only produced solo recordings.\n\nSlim and Joyâs first tour as âThe Slim Dusty Showâ came about in 1953 and through the 1950âs they always had various artists on those shows. There were\n\nGordon Parsons, Barry Thornton, whip spinner Larry Mason, Johnny Ashcroft and of course as a novelty act and one of the biggest crowd pullers the man they\n\ncall âThe Sheikâ Chad Morgan was invited onto the show at various times.\n\nSlim Dusty was hardly known â until 1957, when he recorded âThe Pub With No Beerâ that made him famous worldwide. The song âPub With No Beerâ was a take-off from a Pub Without Beer by Dan Sheahan which was published 13 years earlier. Gordon Parsons who wrote the Pub With No Beer was given several lines of lyrics and may have thought it was a anonymous ballad â at the time. Needless to say, Gordon completed the ballad one night while on tour with Slim, sharing a drink with Chad Morgan. Gordon started blurting out the words, and Chad wrote them down â and âThe Pub With No Beer was born.\n\nSlim recorded âThe Pubâ in April 1957 as a âbâ side and it became EMIâs biggest seller with sales topping 30,000. Slimâs success eclipsed âThe Sheik of Scrubby Creekâ which was recorded by Chad Morgan who until Slim recorded this monster hit, was EMIâs biggest Australian seller. The Pub With No Beer earned slim the first and last gold â78 and it was believed that it had sold a quarter of a million copies in the UK.\n\nLate 1957, Slim joined the showgrounds with sideshow alley promoter Frank Foster where he stayed for 6 years touring from Cairns to Hobart.\n\nThe first Australian Country Music Awards in Tamworth, Slim and Joy took out 3 Golden Guitar and over the years had dominated the Awards. Up until the day he died, Slim had obtained 36 Gold Guitars from 72 nominations.\n\nApril 1978 was one of the greatest night in Australian Country Music history, when Slim Dusty brought his music to the Sydney Opera House. On this historic even was Chad Morgan âThe Sheik of Scrubby Creekâ â two of EMIâs biggest record selling artists back together. That night 2,500 people came to see the show. Both Slim and Chadâs performances were recorded live although only Slims recording was released âThe Entertainerâ or at least 4 years before Morganâs segment was released (more about this in Chadâs story). The show was a success â a tour shortly followed along the eastern seaboard.\n\nAugust 1983 saw the filming of âThe Slim Dusty Movieâ it was a tribute to a man who in words and song had somehow captured the spirit of this country, it followed the life and times of Slim Dusty.\n\nWith this release Slim became the only recording artist in music history to have recorded 100 albums with the same label (however there were double ups on songs). The album went on to have 4 top 10 country singles and to date has sold over 150,000 copies. He was working on his 107th album although it was never completed, however it was released in 2004 titled âColumbia Lane, The Last Sessionâ containing the last 7 tracks of King of Australian Country Music.\n\nThe Slim Dusty Centre in Kempsey â apparently discussions began in 1985, however the foundation was laid in 2003. In October 2009 the Federal Government has honoured the commitment of a previous government of a grant to the tune of $6 million for the building of the Slim Dusty Centre. Some locals were up in arms about this, as the money could have been put towards the local hospitals. . . . but you canât please everyone.\n\nTop Selling Singles\n\na) The Pub With No Beer â (original version 1957)\n\nb) Duncan\n\nc) When The Rain Tumbles Down In July â (original version 1947)\n\nd) Lights On The Hill\n\ne) Trumby -----------------among others . . . .\n\nMajor Awards\n\na) Gold â78 â Pub With No Beer\n\nb) 1970 â awarded an MBE\n\nc) 1979 â roll of renown / Hand of Fame\n\nOn September 19th 2003 Slim passes away after a long private battle with cancer and on September 26th is honoured with a State Funeral in Sydney.\n\nTHE SINGING KETTLES - (Bill, Ross & Max\n\n)\n\nBill - born: 15th December 1940\n\nRoss - born: 24th April 1943\n\nMax - born: 14th January 1950\n\nThe Kettles were born in Lillydale, Tasmainia\n\nBill, age 15 - was given a his first guitar by his uncle, which he quickly taught himself to play Wilf Carter songs.
