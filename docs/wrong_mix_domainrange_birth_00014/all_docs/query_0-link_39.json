        "text": "Gracie Abrams – Good Riddance [Deluxe Edition] CD (Interscope)\n\nGracie Abrams's debut album Good Riddance, produced and co-written by her frequent collaborator Aaron Dessner of The National, finds Abrams documenting her emotional experience with more precision and impact than ever before. As she narrates the end of a fractured relationship and all the confusion, frustration, and longing that come with it, the 23-year-old artist achieves a new level of lyrical honesty and self-possession - an element fully reflected in her quietly captivating vocal work. This Deluxe Edition includes four bonus tracks.\n\nAnimal Collective – Isn’t It Now? CD/2xLP +MP3 (Domino)\n\nAt this point, it is almost impossible to say what makes for a classic Animal Collective album; the standard fluctuates with the weather, your temperament, whatever chemicals may or may not waft through your mind. But from start to finish, first listen to last, Isn't It Now? absolutely lands as a classic, it's mix of playfulness and earnestness, glittery pop and tessellated textures seeming to synthesize and update all that has ever made and still makes this band so compelling. It is experienced and wise, energized, and young, the work of four people committed to finding the frontier of a beginner's mind, together. [Indie store exclusive orange vinyl signed by Geologist.]\n\nArmand Hammer – We Buy Diabetic Test Strips CD/2xLP (Fat Possum)\n\nArmand Hammer, the New York based hip-hop duo consisting of Elucid and billy woods, return with We Buy Diabetic Test Strips. In the two years since the Alchemist produced Haram, Elucid and billy woods have both released critically acclaimed solo albums. Back with their biggest record yet, We Buy Diabetic Test Strips features production from JPEGMAFIA, EL-P, Kenny Segal, Black Noi$e, Preservation, DJ Haram, Child Actor, Sebb Bash, August Fanon, and more. [Limited-edition purple vinyl.]\n\nAsinhell – Impii Hora CD/LP (Metal Blade)\n\nImpii Hora is the debut album from Danish musician Michael Poulsen, lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and main songwriter of the rock band Volbeat. When Poulsen was putting together songs for Volbeat’s 2021 album, Servant Of The Mind, he wrote a bunch of death metal riffs which inspired his new death/black metal band Asinhell whose debut album Impii Hora (Latin for Ungodly Hour) is a tribute to Poulsen’s favorite old-school groups. The songs are rooted in crushing riffs yet injected with strong guitar hooks and shout-along refrains. [Limited-edition silver vinyl.]\n\nB. Cool-Aid – Leather Blvd. LP (Lex)\n\n180gm brown vinyl. Welcome to Leather Blvd: A Black utopia conceived by B. Cool-Aid-the duo of vocalist Pink Siifu and producer Ahwlee (pronounced \"Ali\") - populated by an ensemble cast of characters and collaborators, including Ladybug Mecca (of Digable Planets), Big Rube (Dungeon Family), Fousheé, Mndsgn, Quelle Chris, Denmark Vassey, LIV.e and many more.\n\nBlackbriar – A Dark Euphony CD/LP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nPrepare to be swept away by addictive hooks, theatrical soundscapes, and darkly whimsical storytelling. [Limited-edition red vinyl.]\n\nBlack Stone Cherry – Screamin’ At The Sky CD/LP (Mascot)\n\nNew studio album from Kentucky hard rockers. Over the past two decades, Black Stone Cherry has set a new standard for Southern rock, revitalizing the tradition with burly riffs, and stirring rock hooks. The band's eighth studio album explodes with urgently emotive pop-rock hooks, heartfelt lyrics, headbanging riffs, thunderous drums, and the band's thrilling musicianship. [Limited-edition white vinyl.]\n\nBlonde Redhead – Sit Down For Dinner CD/LP (section1)\n\nBlonde Redhead return with Sit Down For Dinner, their first album in nine years. Its title is a nod to the often-sacred communal ritual of sharing a meal with those you love. This immersive, meticulously crafted record appropriately serves an expression of persistent togetherness — a testament to the unique internal logic Blonde Redhead have refined over their three-decade existence. Understated yet visceral melodies charge each song, creating a foil to lyrics about the inescapable struggles of adulthood: communication breakdown in enduring relationships, wondering which way to turn, holding onto your dreams. [Limited-edition opaque white vinyl.]\n\nMolly Burch – Daydreamer CD/LP (Captured Tracks)\n\nThough the album spends time with mournful, anxious reflections, the songs on Daydreamer never feel bogged down in bleakness or morbidity. Burch's ability to take the darkest moments of her life and translate them to a universal language lays the ground for her most masterful pop writing to-date. [Limited-edition cotton candy pink vinyl.]\n\nSarah Mary Chadwick – Messages To God CD/LP (Kill Rock Stars)\n\nNew Zealand born Melbourne-based Sarah Mary Chadwick releases her eighth studio record Messages To God. Composed of broad, brightly colored spiritual strokes, it consists of dramatic retellings of having your heart broken, existing, movement and growth while always meditating on the past. [A limited-edition translucent pink vinyl.]\n\nCherry Glazerr – I Don’t Want You Anymore CD/LP+MP3/Cassette (Secretly Canadian)\n\nCreevy describes Cherry Glazerr's ambitious new album, I Don't Want You Anymore, as some of her most personal, raw music to date, a collection of songs that elaborate on this period of self-reckoning. It's the first she's produced since Cherry Glazerr's garage rock debut, Haxel Princess, released nearly a decade ago when Creevy was a teenager. Creevy describes I Don't Want You Anymore as a \"mature\" album, more so in reference to her personal growth than a reflection of the record, which in true Cherry Glazerr fashion is best described as ‘extremely fun’. [Limited edition crystal-clear vinyl.]\n\nCode Orange – The Above CD/LP (Blue Grape Music)\n\nAs heavy an album as the Pittsburgh six-piece has ever produced, The Above is a giant sonic leap full of twists and turns that only Code can achieve. A composite of seamless sounds, the band blends heavy music, grunge, trip-hop, hip-hop, and more throughout the album’s 14 tracks. [Indie store exclusive black w/ cream & brown vinyl pressing shipped late and will arrive next week.]\n\nDel Water Gap – I Miss You Already + I Haven’t Left LP (Mom + Pop Music)\n\nDel Water Gap is the solo project of songwriter and producer S. Holden Jaffe, which has grown from a bedroom setup to a nationally touring band since releasing his self-titled debut LP in 2021.\n\nDjo – Decide CD/LP/Cassette (Joe Keery P/K/A Djo)\n\nDjo – Twenty Twenty [Reissue/2019] LP (Joe Keery P/K/A Djo)\n\nDjo - the critically acclaimed brainchild of multi-talented musician/actor Joe Keery - makes its long-awaited return with the game-changing new album, Decide. A spellbinding collage of snaky pop hooks, neon melodies, and deeply personal singer-songwriter lyricism, the album melds high-tech songcraft with quick wit, irrepressible spirit, and an impressive breadth of vision that showcases glowing synths and big beats over the trippy guitars that defined 2019's acclaimed debut, Twenty Twenty. [Indie store exclusive vinyl pressings are available.]\n\nDope Lemon – Kimosabe CD/LP (BMG)\n\nKimosabe is the fourth album by singer/songwriter Angus Stone released under the alias Dope Lemon. [Limited-edition sea blue color vinyl.]\n\nRobert Glasper – Black Radio III (Supreme Edition) 3xLP (Loma Vista)\n\nGrammy winning album Black Radio III is just the latest historic milestone in the decade-long Black Radio series. An ongoing project, evolving over time, perhaps never complete but anchored in its creative commitment to celebrating black excellence in music. As a next chapter, Glasper releases Black Radio III: Supreme Edition on vinyl for the first time. Triple-LP in a gatefold jacket with tri-color handmade color-in-color vinyl and featuring nine bonus tracks (Mac Miller, Bilal, PJ Morton, India. Arie, & more).\n\nThe Glorious Sons – Glory LP (TGS Music Inc.)\n\nThe fourth studio album from The Glorious Sons, Glory, was co-produced by long-time collaborator Frederik Thaae. Rooted in introspective lyricism, indelible melody, and the band's signature dynamic, they take listeners on an incredible journey of self-reflection, self-loathing, reconciliation, and triumph.\n\nPeggy Gou – (It Goes Like) Nanana 12” (XL Recordings)\n\nArtist, producer, DJ and cultural icon Peggy Gou returns with her first new music in nearly two years. Inspired by the eclectic house and pop classics that defined the Balearic sound, alongside ‘90s and 2000s dance anthems and Peggy's own inimitable contemporary club production, (It Goes Like) Nanana has been the sound of the summer, a viral hit soundtracking sunsets and sunrises the world over.\n\nGraveyard – 6 CD/LP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nSwedish classic rock legends Graveyard return with their long and eagerly awaited sixth studio album. [Limited-edition white & sky blue marble vinyl.]\n\nGunship – Unicorn CD/2xLP/Cassette (Horsie In The Hedge)\n\nUnicorn is the long-awaited third album from synth-wave band, Gunship. The album includes the single \"Monster In Parade\", featuring Milkie Way, Dave Lombardo, Tim Cappello and Tyler Bates. Other featured artists include John Carpenter, Gavin Rossdale and Charlie Simpson. [Indie store exclusive ‘blood & chrome’ vinyl.]\n\nHarm’s Way – Common Suffering CD/LP (Metal Blade)\n\nSince 2006, Harm’s Way has evolved from whispered underground favorites to favorite sons with an arsenal of songs that helped shape heavy music’s trajectory–creating a roadmap for legions of copycats interested in “reinventing” themselves. But there is only one Harm’s Way. One that has never stayed complacent and constantly morphed shape – absorbing and reapplying influences in new and creative ways to create some of the most well-executed songs in heavy music. And yet, considering the changeling that they and their previous efforts are, Common Suffering is easily the most musically diverse undertaking in their catalog; an album that shifts the paradigm for heavy music. A modern classic in wait. [Limited-edition grey black/white marble vinyl.]\n\nHartle Road – Maxx II LP (Perennial)\n\nPompeii Studios, the homebrew mecca that created Maxx II is in the American South, a place that, like its namesake, is burning up. Oppressive heat can be claustrophobic but like some many eggs frying on the sidewalk Hartle Road cracks the southern sonic landscape wide open with their brand of indie/no-wave/post-punk.\n\nJoe Hisaishi / Royal Philharmonic Orchestra – A Symphonic Celebration - Music From The Studio Ghibli Films Of Hayao Miyazaki 2xLP (Deutsche Grammophon)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on indie store exclusive sky blue vinyl. There's a certain kind of magic that happens when a director and composer work together for an extended period; their imaginations are fueled by an artistic sensibility which becomes, inevitably, entwined. Such deep understanding between the two artists has proffered memorable, even legendary, cine-musical experiences. But there's another of these partnerships we must honor and mention in the same breath, that of director Hayao Miyazaki and composer Joe Hisaishi.\n\nDale Hollow – Hack Of The Year LP (Tender Loving Empire)\n\n“Music is very easy for Yourstruly, so the inspiration behind Hack of the Year is really just Yourstruly getting ahead of the curve of what will UNDOUBTEDLY (and modestly) be an ABSOLUTE accolade-laden career journey. That way, no one will EVER be able to #claim that they were the FIRST to give Yourstruly an #award. It was Yourstruly and will FOREVER be Yourstruly that gave Yourstruly Yourstruly’s first ever award…”\n\nKoyo – Would You Miss It? CD/LP (Pure Noise)\n\nWould You Miss It? is the kind of album that could only be made by a group of self-proclaimed genre-obsessives. It's why Koyo can seamlessly transition from playing the This Is Hardcore festival to opening for Bayside, because they make perfect sense no matter what bill they're on. Taken in full, Would You Miss It? is the coming-of-age tale of five friends joining together to take on the world. Fueled by a love for music, and a shared creative bond, Koyo sets the bar for the new wave of Long Island bands. As Chiaramonte notes on \"Anthem,\" a lyrical love letter to Long Island scenes of the past, present, and future, \"the best is yet to come.\" Features guest spots from Vinnie Caruana (The Movielife), Daryl Palumbo (Glassjaw / Head Automatica), and Anthony DiDio (Vein. FM). [Indie store exclusive maroon/milky clear pinwheel vinyl.]\n\nKK’s Priest – Sinner Rides Again LP (Napalm)\n\nIconic former Judas Priest members K.K. Downing and Tim \"Ripper\" Owens present nine new tracks of sinful heavy metal fury. [Indie store exclusive clear vinyl.]\n\nLindsay Lou – Queen Of Time CD/LP (Kill Rock Stars)\n\nOn her new album Queen Of Time, Lindsay Lou explores that quest across ten tracks of tender, heartbreakingly beautiful music. Featuring a gamut of guests including Grammy-winners Billy Strings and Jerry Douglas, Queen Of Time celebrates love and loss, but above all, the art of living as an unattainably-a vibrant, powerful woman who can share herself with the world, and yet define a mighty sense of inner self as well [Limited-edition Coke bottle clear vinyl. Don’t miss Lindsay Lou when she performs live at Grimey’s next Wednesday, October 4th, at 12pm noon. Free and all ages!]\n\nLP – Love Lines CD/LP (BMG)\n\nLove Lines, the highly anticipated latest studio album from multi-platinum singer-songwriter LP, follows 2021’s captivating album Churches. Love Lines sees LP continue to capture the complexity of the human experience through their eyes. The album features twelve tracks that offer a deep and reflective look into LP's life experiences, including their relationships with romantic partners, family, and self, encapsulating LP’s unmistakable voice, honest storytelling, and unabashed rock ‘n’ roll combined with heartfelt, unforgettable emotion. [An indie store exclusive vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDustin Lynch – Killed The Cowboy LP (Broken Bow)\n\nSixth studio album from the country music star.\n\nMelenas – Ahora CD/LP (Trouble In Mind)\n\nAhora, the new record by Melenas is the exact opposite of \"that di‑cult third album\". While other bands might be suffering from a lack of inspiration typical of that delicate creative moment, our Spanish quartet reappears more invincible than ever, reassembled with a collection of dazzling songs, and revitalized with a splendid new palette of sounds that raises the following question: can you make jangle pop and garage rock with synthesizers? [Limited-edition red vinyl.]\n\nModern Nature – No Fixed Point In Space LP+MP3 (Bella Union)\n\nNo Fixed Point In Space, the third full-length album by Jack Cooper's Modern Nature, takes the palette of sound and themes that were honed on 2021's Island Of Noise and launches them into an expansive world of openness and vivid technicolor. It's a music that hasn't been heard before; as melodic as anything Cooper has produced but framed by rhythms and instrumentation that reflect the chaos, unpredictability and color of the natural world. \"With this record,\" Cooper explains, \"I wanted the music to reflect nature: beginnings and endings, arrivals and departures, process and chance. I wanted the music and the words to feel like roots, branches, mycelium, the intricacies of a dawn chorus, neurons firing, the unknown.”\n\nRicky Montgomery – Rick CD/LP (WB)\n\nRichard Owen Holmes Montgomery, known professionally as Ricky Montgomery, is an American singer-songwriter. In 2020, his songs went viral on TikTok, leading to being signed with Warner Records later that year. Rick is the artist’s sophomore album. It's a tribal, ritualistic album, devoid of the plastic, business-like beauty of what became gothic metal along the way. [Indie store exclusive cobalt blue vinyl.]\n\nDora Morelenbaum – Vento de Beirada 12” (Mr Bongo)\n\nSinger-songwriter Dora Morelenbaum is one of the stunning voices at the forefront of Brazil's exciting new musical wave. Her sublime Vento de Beirada EP takes you on a trip into the sensuous sounds of Dora's world. On first hearing her music, we were reminded of the transformational moment when we first discovered the Brazilian singer-songwriter, Joyce. The music is completely new to you, yet instantly familiar, like rediscovering a past love.\n\nMae Muller – Sorry I’m Late LP (Capitol)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on red vinyl. Rising pop superstar Mae Muller's anticipated debut album, Sorry I'm Late, is a collection of songs that are deeply personal yet demonstrate her deft ability to celebrate the female experience at large. Mae explores love and loss, dating and relationships with fearless honesty, confronting her own experiences while also capturing the broader frustrations of young women today. While a fierce feminist often informs her songwriting, Mae's new music exposes a much more vulnerable side.\n\nWillie Nelson – Bluegrass LP (Sony Legacy)\n\nLimited-edition electric blue color vinyl pressing. Bluegrass is a brand-new studio album that captures a dozen classic Willie Nelson compositions - including \"On the Road Again\", \"Yesterday's Wine\", \"Still Is Still Moving to Me\", \"Good Hearted Woman\" and more - freshly interpreted by Willie and an ensemble of crack players. Using his own catalog as source material, Willie chose songs combining the kind of strong melodies, memorable storylines and tight ensemble-interplay found in traditional bluegrass interpretations of the roots of American folk songs. With Bluegrass, Willie uncovers new truths in his own songs.\n\nNo-No Boy – Empire Electric CD/LP (Smithsonian Folkaways)\n\nThere are seemingly infinite layers of meaning to be found in No-No Boy’s third album, Empire Electric. You can listen closely to singer-songwriter Julian Saporiti’s lyrics, which juxtapose true stories of struggle from throughout Asia and its diaspora with Saporiti’s own reckoning with intergenerational trauma. You could also let the majesty of Saporiti’s songcraft wash over you, his captivating melodies cloaking those themes in a veneer of hope and ecstasy. But the deepest storytelling happens at the sonic level, as sounds drawn from across the Eastern hemisphere mingle freely with distinctly American instrumentation – banjo and koto, lap-steel and guzheng – while electronically manipulated field recordings of rushing water, chirping birds and other natural sounds ground us in the now. Adventurous and affecting, Empire Electric offers a vision for a new kind of folk music, one that tells unorthodox stories through unorthodox means and finds new pathways through our tangled roots.\n\nOliver Tree – Alone In A Crowd CD/LP (Atlantic)\n\nMeet the collaborative songwriting effort of two brothers. Currently based out of New Orleans and Madison, Ben and Scott Cunningham grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. They love alt-country, the key of G, acoustic guitars, fishing, Jesus, and the world he created. For 15 years and running, together they write and record songs about these things, calling this effort The Olive Tree. [Indie store exclusive translucent red vinyl is available for special order.]\n\nPachyman – Switched-On LP (ATO)\n\nWhile conceptualizing Switched-On, Pachyman gravitated to Lovers Rock-era reggae and the iconic Studio One. Yet the album also pays homage to the era where musicians began manipulating synthesizers for gloriously off-kilter bleeps and bloops. His evolution emerges on \"You Looked At Me\", fusing a Krautrock-esque beat with synths reminiscent of Boards Of Canada. Pachy's sound further expands on \"Trago Coqueto\", a cheeky love song crooned through a cocktail's prism and an ode to his Puerto Rican roots.\n\nPrimordial – How It Ends CD/2xLP (Metal Blade)\n\nPrimordial have nothing to prove. 32 years in the business and now returning with their tenth devastating full-length, the Irish band make it clear they are a primal force that consistently lays “it” all on the line. The follow up to 2018’s Exile Amongst The Ruins, How It Ends finds Primordial delivering another helping of their seminal blend of Celtic and black metal. [Limited-edition ochre marbled vinyl pressing is available for special order.]\n\nSay She She – Silver LP (Karma Chief)\n\nThe female-led discodelic soul band Say She She, named as a silent nod to Nile Rodgers (C'est chi-chi!: It's Chic!\"), release their sophomore album 'Silver' on the heels of an epic break-out year that grows brighter by the day. The three strong voices of Piya Malik (El Michels Affair staple feature, and former backing singer for Chicano Batman), Sabrina Mileo Cunningham and Nya Gazelle Brown front the band. This harmonizing trio was formed in a classic New York tale of friends that met by following the music: the downtown dancefloors, through the Lower East Side floorboards and up to the rooftops of Harlem. [Limited-edition clear vinyl.]\n\nSBTRKT – The Rat Road CD/2xLP (SBTRKT Live Limited)\n\nEmerging from six years of sonic exploration, SBTRKT (pronounced 'subtract'), is an electronic music artist based in London, UK known for his synaesthesiac production and early collaborations with, and championing of, Sampha and Jessie Ware, alongside Little Dragon, The Dream, A$AP Ferg, Ezra Koenig and Drake.Largely anonymous, SBTRKT (real name Aaron Jerome) has established a reputation for iconic visuals and creative, an incredible live show and a sound that effectively defined electronic music in the early 2010s. The Rat Road sees SBTRKT redefine UK electronic music (again)' according to GQ, bringing together his iconic, synaesthesiac production with an incredible lineup of collaborators including Toro Y Moi, Teezo Touchdown, D Double E, Anna Of The North, Kai Isaiah Jamal, Sampha, Little Dragon and others. [A limited-edition silver color vinyl pressing is available for special order.]\n\nSetting – Shone A Rainbow Light On LP (A Paradise Of Bachelors)\n\nThe debut recording by Setting, a trio comprising Nathan Bowles (solo/trio, Pelt, Black Twig Pickers) on strings, keys, and percussion; Jaime Fennelly (Mind Over Mirrors, Peeesseye) on harmoniums, synthesizers, and piano zither; and Joe Westerlund (solo, Califone, Sylvan Esso, Jake Xerxes Fussell) on drums, percussion, and metallophones, Shone A Rainbow Light On traverses textural, phosphorescent topography with a certified organic folk-engine. Fueled by a vibratory hybrid of acoustic and electronic instrumentation, these four stately longform pieces sound like a UFO slowly sinking into a peat bog.\n\nEd Sheeran – Autumn Variations CD/LP (Atlantic)\n\n\"Last autumn, I found that my friends and I were going through so many life changes. After the heat of the summer, everything either calmed, settled, fell apart, came to a head, or imploded,” says Ed Sheeran. “When I went through a difficult time at the start of last year, writing songs helped me understand my feelings and come to terms with what was going on, and when I learned about my friend’s different situations, I wrote songs, some from their perspectives, some from mine, to capture how they and I viewed the world at that time. There were highs of falling in love and new friendships among lows of heartbreak, depression, loneliness, and confusion. My dad and brother told me about a composer called Elgar, who composed Enigma Variations, where each of the 14 compositions were about a different one of his friends. This is what inspired me to make this album.” [Limited-edition white vinyl.]\n\nSlow Pulp – Yard CD/LP+MP3 (ANTI-)\n\nOn Yard, Wisconsin-bred, Chicago-based four-piece Slow Pulp nestles comfortably into pockets of nuance, impressions, contradictions - sonics and lyrics finessed together to bottle the specific tension of a feeling you've never quite been able to find the right words for. In that regard, listening to Slow Pulp can feel like being in a room with someone who's known you so long that they can read your every micro-expression and pinpoint exactly how you're feeling before you can. Perhaps this spawns from the band's own shared history and chemistry; in various ways, the four of them grew up - and are still growing up - together. The dreamy songs of the Midwest indie rock outfit draw on moody shoegaze, hooky grunge, and intimate lo-fi fare. [Limited-edition translucent blue vinyl.]\n\nJorja Smith – Falling Or Flying CD/LP/Cassette (Famm Limited)\n\nDouble Brits Awards Winner and Grammy/Mercury Prize nominee Jorja Smith returns with her second album. On Falling Or Flying Smith embarks on an adventure of sounds and thrills. It's smooth, it's pop and soulful and sure to be one of the best albums of this year. Sonically, Falling Or Flying, a no-skips body of work, isn’t like anything you’ve heard before. It sits masterfully in this same space of excitement, self-exploration, and self-assertion that Jorja does. Compromised of deep, thumping drums, racing basslines, irresistible hooks, and distinctive beats, Falling Or Flying runs at the same pace that Jorja’s mind does. Of the many British voices in music today, Jorja is among the most commanding, writing at a pitch of intensity and urgency that few can match. [Indie store exclusive vinyl includes booklet.]\n\nNate Smith – Nate Smith CD/2xLP (SME Nasvhille)\n\nPowerful vocalist Nate Smith first earned acclaim soon after releasing the poignant \"One Of These Days\", which he wrote after a wildfire devastated his hometown of Paradise, California. The reaction to the track inspired Smith to move to Nashville.\n\nJohn P. Strohm – Something To Look Forward To CD (Propeller Sound Recordings)\n\nJohn P. Strohm returns with his first new album in 15 years. Something To Look Forward To is an album shaped by life-altering loss and a renewed devotion to the sometimes-transcendent work of songwriting. This album is an evolution of the potent songcraft shown in Strohm’s past work—including his role as co-founder of the seminal college-rock band Blake Babies and indie-rock acts Antenna and Lemonheads. [Vinyl version – including a red transparent w/ white swirl colorway – due October 13.]\n\nThank You, I’m Sorry – Growing In Strange Places LP (County Your Lucky Stars)\n\nOrange Crush vinyl. Thank You, I'm Sorry is the solo project of frontperson Colleen Dow turned full band. Now joined by guitarist Abe Anderson, drummer Sage Livergood, and bassist Bethany Schreiner, the band crafts incredibly relatable confessionals that everyone can connect with - struggles with love, working a job you hate, or just finding a place in the world. Songs that get to the heart of a young creative's struggle in a destructive world.\n\nWilco – Cousin CD/LP (dBpm/Legacy)\n\nWilco’s thirteenth studio album, Cousin, was recorded in the band’s legendary Chicago studio – The Loft – over a period of two years. The ten new tracks are written by band leader Jeff Tweedy and feature musical performances by the longtime lineup of Nels Cline, Mikael Jorgensen, Glenn Kotche, John Stirratt, Pat Sansone and, of course, Tweedy on lead vocals. After a short detour back into their country-influenced roots via last year’s Cruel Country double album, Cousin sees Wilco back in their more familiar progressive and experimental rock territory. Tweedy’s singular songwriting voice is in full evidence, with lyrics weaving across a variety of topics – from the iconoclastic to the introspective. Adding a unique and new element to the recording process was the attachment of Welsh singer/songwriter Cate Le Bon as producer – the first time an outsider has been actively involved in a Wilco recording session for more than ten years, since Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\n\nWolves In The Throne Room – Crypt Of Ancestral Knowledge CDEP/12” (Relapse)\n\nAmerican black metal overlords Wolves In The Throneroom return with a new EP, Crypt Of Ancestral Knowledge. Featuring four new tracks spanning the scope of Wolves In The Throneroom's cinematic black metal and dark acoustic folk, the EP also sees the band carry listeners through a journey of atmospheric industrial tracks and darker sonic territories. [Limited-edition silver vinyl.]\n\nDan Auerbach – Keep It Hid CD/LP/Cassette (Easy Eye Sound)\n\nDan Auerbach, singer and guitarist in the Black Keys, releases his extraordinary debut solo album Keep It Hid. We've always known Dan to be a top-drawer bluesman and guitar virtuoso, but on Keep It Hid he reveals himself to be a songwriter of exceptional range and versatility - now extending his work to include psychedelia, soul music, gospel, and country harmonies as well as the usual future blues-rock classics. [Tennessee Variant - Peach Marbled Vinyl LP signed by Dan Auerbach. Limited to one per format, per customer/household. Available while supplies last in the shop and the Grimey's webstore.]\n\nVictor Axelrod – If You Ask Me To... CD/LP+MP3 (Yep Roc)\n\nIf you’re a fan of Daptone Records, chances are you’ve read or heard the name Victor Axelrod, and even if you haven’t, you’ve heard music from his hand. As a producer, arranger, recording and mixing engineer, and keyboardist, his creativity has extended across more than two decades of the label’s releases, even dating to its prehistory with Desco Records.

Of this rework, producer Youth says “The idea for Metallic Spheres In Colour, was that Alex Paterson (founder of The Orb) could have done more on the first version, and he didn't really have the opportunity because we had a philosophy of making the music like the Blade Runner soundtrack meets Wish You Were Here. So, I asked him why don't we remix it and make it like an Orb classic?

The songs compiled by Mikey Young (Total Control/Eddy Suppression Ring) and Keith Abrahamsson (head of A&R at Anthology Recordings) for Sad About The Times arrived in the wake of the psychedelic ‘60s; after the high-flying idealism had run its course and singer songwriters were ascendant.
