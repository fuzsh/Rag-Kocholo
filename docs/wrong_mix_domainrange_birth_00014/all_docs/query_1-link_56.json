Where no certain evidence of a person's birth year has yet been identified, the assumption is that we do not and cannot yet know with sufficient certainty to propose one. Years of birth or death, and sometimes also names and spellings of names, thus sourced and presented here, will often differ more or less substantially from those given (but often merely hazarded) in standard Australian and international bibliographic and biographical records.\n\nThe texts given in gold aim for the most part to be diplomatic transcriptions, wherever practical retaining unaltered the original orthography, and spellings and mis-spellings, of the printed or manuscript sources. Occasionally, however, some spellings are silently corrected (for instance, of unusual music titles and composers, to assist identification), and some orthography, punctuation and paragraphing, and very occasionally also syntax, editorially altered or standardised in the interests of consistency, clarity, and readability.\n\nSKAFE, Andrew (Andrew SCAFE) see Andrew SCAFE\n\nSKELTON, John (John SKELTON; Ensign SKELTON)\n\nAmateur flautist, flute player, ensign (46th Regiment)\n\nArrived Sydney, NSW, 6 May 1814 (per Three Bees, from Falmouth, 8 December 1813)\n\nhttps://sydney.edu.au/paradisec/australharmony/register-S-3.php#SKELTON-John (shareable link to this entry)\n\nDocumentation:\n\n\"London Gazette for May 20\", Royal military chronicle, or British officers' monthly register and mentor (November 1813), 50\n\nhttps://books.google.com.au/books?id=tDQFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA50 (DIGITISED)\n\n. . . dated May 20, 1813. 46th ditto, John Skelton, gent, to be ensign, without purchase, vice Maxwell, promoted in the 100th foot, dated as above . . .\n\nEnquiry on conduct of on board \"Three Bees\", 24 May 1814; NSW Colonial Secretary's Papers, 1788-1856; Main Series of Letters Received, 1788-1826; Series 897, Reel 6044; 4/1730 (101-49), 115-16 (\"106-07\"); State Records Authority of NSW\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com.au/interactive/1905/32086_228446-00486 (PAYWALL)\n\n[captain John Wallis's evidence] . . .

In the spring of 1844, he sold up and moved to Sydney, where he had acquired the license of the Clown Hotel, opposite the Royal Victoria Theatre, in Pitt-street, from George Coppin.\n\nFollowing Coppin's example, and employing some of the same performers, Skinner continued for the first weeks of his new management to present musical entertainments, including black-face minstrel acts. Another Coppin innovation, the short-lived Sydney Catch Club also continued to meet at the Clown under Skinner's management.\n\nAfter early 1845, Skinner's entertainments seem to have waned. In January 1847, he opened new premises, also known as Skinner's Clown Hotel, or Skinner's Family Hotel, on the southern corner of George and Hunter Streets (the building is still there). Like Coppin, Skinner was an active mason, and in 1846 was secretary of Australian Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Oddfellows. From his hotels, Skinner also sold tickets for theatrical and musical events.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n[Advertisement], The Sydney Morning Herald (28 October 1843), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12425080\n\nCOWPASTURE BRIDGE GENERAL STORE.\n\nG.

Interest in Bands\", The Mercury (10 February 1936), 5\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30076611\n\nA Huon pioneer, Mr, Richard Skinner, died at his residence, Ivanhoe, at Huonville, on Thursday last. Born at Huonville in 1858, the late Mr. Skinner was a native of the southern municipality, and held the esteem of a wide circle of friends. He was associated in many ways with Huon activities. Perhaps, his keenest interest was in music and choir work, and the activities of the Huonville Brass Band always occupied his attention. So keen was he on the progress of bands that at his instigation brass bands were formed at Huonville, Franklin, Cygnet, and Bruny Island, and it was not until very recent years that he severed his association with these organisations . . .\n\n\"LATE MR. R. SKINNER. PIONEER OF HUON (Contributed)\", Huon and Derwent Times (20 February 1936), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article137247210\n\nMr. Richard Skinner, who died at his home on February 6th, 1936, was born at Huonville on December 12th, 1858. He was the son of Mr. Joseph Skinner, a pioneer of the Huon. The Skinner family first settled at Franklin in 1843, and came to Huonville, or Victoria as it was then called, in 1847, taking up farm land above the Glen property. About 1853 they went to reside at Clifton Grove. It was there that Mr. R. Skinner and his sister, Mrs. John Clark, were born. Thei, mother was Mr. Joseph Skinner's second wife. Mr. Skinner's father died when he (Richard) was only five months old, and he spent his boyhood at Clifton Grove, remaining there with his step-brother [half-brother], John Skinner, after his mother's marriage to Mr. John Jolly. The late Mr. Skinner was first employed at Messrs. Skinner and Wise's sawmill, one of the first sawmills in the Huon. In his early youth he went to the tin mines on the North East Coast with Chas. Ivy and Fred. Bell. It was while returning from there that Mr. Skinner made one of the longest jaunts in his life. He walked with a friend, F. Bell, from St. Helens to Hobart. Mr. Skinner was a noted pedestrian. On another occasion he walked from Huonville to Hobart - round New Town and Sandy Bay, then back to his home as a Sunday pleasure trip. When he was 21 years of age he went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Knight to manage their property, which he afterwards inherited, and in 1886 he married Lucy Mary Linnell, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Linnell, and grand-daughter of the pioneer, Mr. Silas Parsons. After some years, having leased his orchard, he commenced business as a sawmiller, and made that the chief occupation of his life. At different times he started sawmills at Huonville and Franklin, and later with his step-brother [half-brother], Mr. David Jolly, at Bruni Island. Although Mr. Skinner did not actively participate in sport, he took the keenest interest in all games, particularly cricket and football. For many years he was scorer for the Huonville Cricket Club; and liberally supported both games. He was a lifelong abstainer, following the example of his father, who was one of the first in England to sign Father Matthews' total abstinence pledge, and he gave freely, of his talents and money to further the temperance cause.\n\nMr. R. Skinner was one of the most gifted musicians that lived in the Huon. Madame Amy Sherwin was a friend of his youth. He had a pure tenor voice of great sweetness and range, and his musical compositions for, violin, piano, organ, and brass band, are above the average works of that kind. At the early age of 22 he was conductor of the Victoria Brass Band which he, with others, had formed at Ranelagh. Within a fortnight of its formation under Mr. Skinner's tuition the band played at an entertainment at Ranelagh, and also played while on the March. Many well known names are amongst the Huon's first bandsmen: - R. Skinner (bandmaster), E. Linnell, J. Linnell, T. Dowling, Geo. Harris, Wm. Shield, F. Bell, H. Longley, F. Harris, L. Bender, H. Oates, F. Upchurch, Geo. Walton, Ed. Page, C. G. Frankcomb, P. Larsen, W. Albury, J. Harris, A. Wise, and S. Harris. The band's first engagement away from home was at Franklin. Herr Schott, master of Hobart's leading band, and his bandsmen, were present, and after the performance he congratulated the young performers and commented on the genius of the young bandmaster. The band met for practice in the old brick Church of England building at Ranelagh, which was later pulled down. The loss of their meeting place, and some of the members having left the district, the band had to cease operations for a while. Later they re-formed, and were in active existence for many years. Mr. Skinner also started brass bands in Huonville, Cygnet, and Geeveston, travelling to these centres and giving tuition free of charge. Often, he would write whole scores, or compose parts not given in printed score. He always played a cornet in the band, but was also a violinist; in fact no musical instrument came amiss to him.\n\nAfter retiring from sawmilling at Bruni Island, Mr. Skinner returned to Huonville. There are many sawmillers in the Huon who have received practical help and good advice from him. He was always busy - using a hammer and saw one day, tuning a piano the next, or doing anything he could to help a neighbor along. All was done out of kindness and not for gain. He was a widely read man, a keen observer of nature, and had a remarkably good memory to the time of his death.\n\n[Such men of grit, benevolence, and industry made the Huon what it is to-day.

At the conclusion of the match the scorers did not tally by two runs or byes, which were given in favour of the Retail, thereby making the Warehousemen victorious by twenty-one instead of twenty-three (not fourteen, as stated by Mr. C.) As to our winning by \"mere accident,\" I think those who witnessed the game must have formed a very different opinion; we being highest score in both innings. In the scratch-match which followed, the same bowlers joined as in the match. This game was not finished, therefore could not be lost by \"mere accident.\" Had it continued there is every reason to believe it would have resulted in our favour, from the fact of there being only four wickets down for upwards of sixty runs. Hoping, in justice to the warehousemen, you will give publicity to this.\n\nI am, Sir yours, &c.,\n\nR. L. SKINNER, Hon. Sec.

The affair was under the management of Mr. G. L. Carter, of the firm of Tanner, Painter, and Pope, by whom, with other employees of that house, personally taking part in the entertainment, every exertion had obviously been made to give satisfaction to the patrons of the half-holiday movement, and to the general public . . . The farce was succeeded by a well-selected Musical Melange, in which each of the vocalists (amateur and professional) enjoyed the advantage of an artistic accompaniment from Mrs. W. J. Cordner. The first piece was Hobbs's cavatina, \"Nina,\" by Mr. G. F. Jackson, which was deservedly applauded. Madame Reiloff Jackson then gave, with much effective skill, Randegger's vocal waltz, \"Joyous Life.\" The third item in this part of the programme was one of Balfe's favourite ballads, in which Mr. R.

The programme contained many beautiful selections and the corps de concert included several of the most popular vocalists of the city. The beneficiaire was greeted with a very hearty reception. In the tenor solo \"Image of the Rose,\" Mr. Skinner had the advantage of the assistance of the members of Mr. Fisher's choir, who gave the vocal accompaniment very successfully. An Irish melody, \"The Minstrel Boy \" was rendered by Signor Ugo Devoti, with some little constraint and in place of an encore he gave one of his favourite Italian songs with that freedom and buoyancy which characterises most of his performances. Mr. Andrew Fairfax sang two or three descriptive songs to the great delight of the audience; and Miss James' rendering of the items which fell to her share elicited the admiration of the audience. In the scene \"The blind girl to her harp,\" with harp accompaniment by Mr. E. H. Cobley, she acceded to the demand for on encore. The second part was introduced by the \"Soldier's Chorus,\" from Faust, which was spiritedly sung by a well-balanced choir, and among other morceaux were the \"Pilgrim of Love,\" by Mr. Skinner, \"I like to sing the auld songs,\" by Miss Lea, and the \"Orpheus Glee - Banish, O Maiden\" by Mr. Fisher and gentlemen amateurs.

Blanche arrived shortly after 8 o'clock, and they were heartily welcomed, the orchestra playing the National Anthem. The entertainment opened with the overture, in which the talent of the company, so far as instrumental music was concerned, was most advantageously displayed. The most attractive portion in the first part of the programme were the song of \"Maryland,\" which was rendered with much tenderness and feeling by Mr. Skinner, and \"Silver Moonlight Winds,\" by Mr. May . . .

Mr. John B. Skipper\", The Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers Advocate (8 August 1896), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85774688\n\nMr. John Bacon Skipper, an old Parramatta townsman, died on Monday, at his late residence, Terry-street, Drummoyne, the cause of death being apoplexy. Although ailing for some time past, Mr. Skipper's last serious illness was short, and his death came somewhat as a surprise to his relatives. He was a vigorous man for his age, and, though a victim to apoplexy, which was the cause of death, there was nothing about his ailment to excite concern among the members of his family. He took seriously ill on the Sunday previous to his death, Mr. Skipper was formerly a well-known figure in musical circles in Parramatta. He had been a member of the Cumberland Band for nearly 20 years, and among the many telegrams and messages of sympathy received by the family in their bereavement were those from two old comrades in the band, Mr. W. Watters and Mr. George O'Shea. Mr. Skipper was a carpenter and builder, which occupation he followed up with such ability and industry in the good old times that he acquired valuable properties in and about Parramatta, and his widow is well provided for. He lived a retired life for the last ten years and lately removed to Drummoyne, where a married daughter resides. Besides his widow, deceased leaves seven children, the youngest of whom is 19, there being five daughters and two sons . . . The deceased gentleman was a native of Essex, England.\n\n\"The Late Mr. L. Skipper\", The Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers Advocate (13 February 1936), 22\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104688520\n\nThe death occurred at the residence of his daughter, Mrs. D. Smith, at Henley, Parramatta River, on the 31st ult., of Mr. Lewis Bacon Skipper, at the age of 75 years. He was a son of the late Mr. and Mrs. John Bacon Skipper, one-time residents of Church-street, Parramatta South . . . He was for a time the licensee of the Cornstalk Hotel (since closed) at Parramatta North, and was one of the original players of the old Cumberland Band, and later joined the Third Regiment Band and the Rosehill Band, Parramatta. Of the few remaining players of the band may be mentioned Messrs. E. Watters, G. E. Gill (Granville), Jack Halmarick, G. Haswell (Auburn), Jim Halmarick, and H. Burgess.

F. Poole, was given at the Brisbane School of Arts. The attendance on the occasion was the most numerous that had ever been witnessed there, amounting to about three hundred and twenty persons, comprising most of the principal families of Brisbane . . . Mr. Poole, who was received in a most complimentary manner, opened the entertainment with some appropriate remarks upon the origin and power of music, and then introduced his assistants to the audience Mr. Humby, who had given his services gratuitously, presided at the Pianoforte, and was assisted by two young ladies, his pupils. The pieces sung, and which were interspersed with occasional observations by Mr. Poole, were as follow: -\n\n\"The Angels Whisper,\" Mr. Humby; \"I'm afloat\" same; \"Jenny Lane,\" same;\n\n\"Poor Bessie,\" Miss Skyring; \"Life's a bumper,\" Mr. Humby and Misses Skyring;\n\n\"The Red Cross Knights,\" same; \"The Alderman's Thumb,\" same; \"Lady of Beauty,\" same; \"Rosalie, (Ethiopian melody;) same;\n\n\"When thy bosom heaves a sigh,\" Mr. Humby and Miss Skyring; Finale - \"God save the Queen,\" Mr. Humby and Misses Skyring, assisted by the audience.\n\nIn the course of the evening, \"James Alexander,\" a travelled aboriginal, whose case we mentioned in a former issue of this journal, was introduced, and created much amusement by his musical imitations on the walking stick, and his attempts to sing some of the popular Ethiopian airs. Altogether the entertainment passed off with the utmost success whether with respect to the satisfaction of the company or the augmentation of the funds. Many of the songs and glees were loudly and deservedly applauded; and in some the encore was insisted upon. \"The Red Cross Knights,\" and \"Lady of Beauty\" particularly elicited applause. At the conclusion of the entertainment a vote of thanks to Mr. Poole and the performers, particularly to the ladies who had given their services - was carried by acclamation.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: George Frederick Poole (musical amateur); John Cross Humby (musician, pianist, music teacher); Tetaree [James Alexander] (Aboriginal performer); the other Miss Skyring performing was Eliza's younger sister, Mary Ann, born Sydney, NSW, 11 May 1834; from 1857, Mrs. William Slack; died Brisbane, QLD, 25 May 1915\n\n\"CONCERT\", The Moreton Bay Courier (30 April 1853), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3710525\n\nThere was a very good attendance at Mr. Humby's concert last Tuesday evening, although the rainy state of the weather in all probability kept back many intending visitors. The moist condition of the atmosphere is the more to be regretted as it seemed to have affected the lungs of Mr. Humby's pupils, one of whom in particular, we were pained to observe, was troubled with it particularly shrill and discordant note. The overtures to the respective divisions of the entertainment played on the piano-forte by the ladies, were very creditably executed. The best songs of the evening according to our judgment, were \"Poor Bessy,\" \"Rise Gentle Moon,\" \"Lady of Beauty,\" \"Let's Make Hay While the Sun Shines,\" and \"The Rose Will Cease to Blow.\" As regard the first of these, it appears to possess no merit whatever as a composition, but it was made the most of by Miss Skyring. The others named were respectably got through, and in the last Mr. Humby was deservedly encored. \"Fair Flora,\" \"Lightly Tread,\" and \"The Minute Gun,\" were decided failures; and it is a pity that \"I know a Bank\" was attempted. On the whole the audience appeared satisfied, and greeted the performers with a round of applause at the end. It is to be hoped that these concerts may occasionally be continued, as practice begets improvement.\n\n\"MORETON BAY\", Empire (23 December 1854), 8\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60201677\n\nA Benefit Concert for Miss Harris was given at the School of Arts last Monday, and another concert on Wednesday closed the series of entertainments with which we have lately been favoured.

Hodgson (bookseller, publisher)\n\nSummary:\n\nHe may be the George Slater, bookseller and publisher, active at 252, Strand, in London, in 1849 and 1850. There is no record of him\n\nGeorge Slater arrived in Victoria as a 29-year-old immigrant on the Anne Cropper in May 1853, and, by August, was set up in premises in Collingwood as a bookseller. He was also, from shortly after his arrival, an officer of Melbourne branch of the Swedenborgian New Church.\n\nHaving moved into the city, by early 1854 Slater was in partnership with the printer William Henry Williams and bookseller Arthur T. Hodgson, trading at 94 Bourke-street east, as Slater, Williams, Hodgson and Co., or Slater, Williams, and Hodgson. Together they continued to issue The Melbourne vocalist, which Hodgson had inaugurated in 1853.\n\nAfter the firm's formal dissolution in June 1856, Slater and Williams continued to work closely together. Williams, who was also a noted musical amateur and the first Victoria printer to use music type, was probably directly responsible for selecting the musical content in Slater's The illustrated journal of Australasia, which Williams also typeset and printed. In 1857 it contained a monthly musical supplement, consisting of songs by Stephen Massett, Sidney Nelson, George Tolhurst, and others. During the previous year, 1856, Tolhurst, then working as a newspaper reporter, had also edited The black and white list and elector's guide for Slater.\n\nWilliams also republished the musical supplements from the Illustrated journal in his album Williams's musical annual and Australian sketch book for 1858.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nNames and descriptions of passengers per Anne Cropper, from London, 28 January 1853, for Port Phillip; Public Record Office Victoria\n\nhttps://prov.vic.gov.au/archive/3402227A-F96C-11E9-AE98-FF6251ADC8F4?image=314 (DIGITISED)\n\nSlater George / 29 / Draper / [English]\n\n[Advertisement], The Argus (3 August 1853), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4795288\n\nWELLINGTON Library Catalogue now ready.\n\nGeorge Slater, wholesale and retail bookseller and stationer, 13, Wellington-street, near Black's, Collingwood.\n\n? \"DIED\", The Argus (5 April 1854), 4\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4805404\n\nOn the 22nd December last, at No. 8 William-street, Greenhead, Glasgow, Scotland, the beloved wife of Mr. George Gourlay Slater, aged fifty-five years.\n\n[Advertisement], The Age (19 June 1855), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article154893884\n\nSLATER, WILLIAMS and HODGSON have on Sale - . . .\n\nChurch of England Hymnbooks . . .\n\nSong books, about 20 varieties\n\nMelbourne Vocalist . . .\n\nWholesale and Retail, at their General Letter press and Label Printing Office, 94 Bourke street-east, Eastern market, and Mostyn-street, Castlemaine.\n\n[Advertisement], The Age (9 July 1855), 7\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article154896057\n\nTHE COLLINGWOOD PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY COMMITTEE, will meet at the Collingwood Building Society's office in George street, on Monday evening, at seven o'clock, to audit the accounts of the Concert given by Miss Catherine Hayes in aid of the destitute.\n\nGEORGE SLATER, Secretary, pro tem.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Catherine Hayes (vocalist)\n\n[Advertisement], The Argus (19 July 1855), 8\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4812553\n\nMELBOURNE VOCALIST contains Music of \"Lilly Dale\" and \" Villikins,\" &c., &c., Slater, Williams and Hodgson.\n\n[Advertisement], The Argus (19 January 1856), 7\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4828642\n\nALL DAVIDSON'S MUSIC at Slater, Williams, and Hodgson's, opposite Theatre Royal, Bourke-street, and Castlemaine.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: George Henry Davidson (London music publisher)\n\n[Advertisement], The Age (16 February 1856), 1\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article154864803\n\nSLATER, WILLIAMS, and HODGSON'S COLONIAL PUBLICATIONS . . .\n\nMELBOURNE VOCALIST, containing songs of the day.\n\nFirst Series, price 3s.

It is more than twenty years since he opened a small bookseller's shop nearly opposite the present office of this paper - a shop so small that its counter and stock of books and periodicals left very little room for purchasers; but a good business was done there, sufficient to enable Mr. Slater to open in larger premises lower down the street. Here difficulties overtook him, and the business was ultimately sold to Messrs. Gordon and Gotch, by whom it is now carried on. Mr. Slater always, while health permitted, took a warm interest in public affairs, though he never aspired to a seat either in the Municipal Council or in Parliament. He was well known for his staunch adherence to the doctrines of the New Jerusalem Church, and for the active interest he took in all that concerned the welfare of the denomination. Of late years Mr. Slater has been a dealer in homeopathic medicines, having for a long time advocated this system of treatment.\n\n\"DEATHS\", The Brisbane Courier (18 May 1886), 1\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4484630\n\nSLATER. - On the 12th May, at the residence of the Rev.

PUBLICATIONS OF THE PAST\", The Australasian (10 November 1934), 4\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article145243763\n\nOne of the early Melbourne publications was \"The News Letter,\" issued by George Slater, of 94 Bourke-street east. Slater announced in 1856 that \"The News Letter\" was published monthly, price 6d., as a narrative of events in Australia, indicating the spirit and progress of the times. It was printed on superfine thin post paper, and one of the pages was left blank for private correspondence. Slater said that while complaints were very general of the uncertainty of newspapers being transmitted and delivered by post there was then great confidence in the safe delivery of letters; therefore it would be observed that \"The News Letter\" (posted as a letter) was the most desirable means of communicating with friends \"at Home and elsewhere.\" He claimed that it formed a concise summary of events, convenient for those who had \"not sufficient leisure to narrate with their own pen to their friends all the interesting events transpiring in this country.\"\n\nSlater was the publisher of an early magazine, \"The Journal of Australasia,\" issued monthly at the price of 1/6. In 1858 he quoted \"The Argus\" as remarking: - \"This colony ought to be able to support a first-class monthly magazine, and we are glad to observe that Mr. George Slater has resolved to make the experiment, and to give it a fair trial. There is no dearth of literary talent in this city; nor, we believe, is there any absence of an inclination on the part of the public to offer a cordial reception to a really good periodical, and to ensure it a lengthened and prosperous existence.\" It was added that the first number of \"The Journal of Australasia\" scarcely realised the conception of what such a magazine ought to be, but that was satisfactorily accounted for by the editor in his opening address. Slater had explained that \"the anxiety of the publisher to issue the first number of the journal on the 1st of July, in order to commence the half-year regularly, and for other reasons, caused a large portion of the work to be proceeded with before the editorial engagements had been entered into. So that a difference in some respects between the execution and the plan demands apologetic mention.\" He added that he had sought and obtained promises of literary aid from gentlemen of recognised talent.\n\nAnother Slater publication was \"The Black and White List,\" which be described as \"A True Guide to Electors as to how Men who have had the opportunity of serving their country have done so.\" We do not learn whether the politicians trembled when they knew of the existence of this list.\n\nIn his versatility Slater added to his group of books \"The Melbourne Vocalist,\" first and second series, with airs of popular songs, price half a crown each. And, as the half-year had been passed, he offered copies of the Melbourne Directory for 1856 at half-price.\n\nMusical publications:\n\nThe Melbourne vocalist (1854-56)\n\nThe Melbourne vocalist [first series, 1-6] (Melbourne: Slater, Williams, and Hodgson, 1854)\n\nhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/work/153725061\n\nhttps://collection.sl.nsw.gov.au/record/74Vv67NmxWR3\n\nThe Melbourne vocalist [new series, second series, 1-6; 1-4, 1855; 5-6, 1856] (Melbourne: Slater, Williams, and Hodgson, 1856)\n\nhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/work/153992099\n\nhttps://collection.sl.nsw.gov.au/record/74Vv6WdBgjAM\n\nMost songs text only; with music for: Lilly Dale, Villikins and his Dinah, The chip girl, The honest working man, Dunois the brave, Agathe to Irene\n\nMusical supplements to The illustrated journal of Australasia (1857)\n\nMusical supplements to The illustrated journal of Australasia 2 (January to June 1857)\n\nThe trusting heart, the poetry by Chas.

Coming to Melbourne in 1853, he opened a bookshop at 94 Bourke Street East. It became a substantial business. He published the Journal of Australasia, which contained the earliest criticism of Australian literature. This was written by Frederick Sinnett, who had been a student and friend of John Stuart Mill. Slater established the News-Letter of Australasia, for migrants to send home to their families. There is a copy of this rare journal in the library of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria. Slater also published the Melbourne Vocalist and Bounty Immigration, by \"One Who Has Handled the Spade\", in 1855. In 1858 he published an anonymous novel, Rebel Convicts. This rare book deals with the convicts who were transported for their part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In 1855 the firm became Slater, Williams and Hodgson, with a branch at Castle-[12]-maine. A shop was opened at Bendigo in 1856. Selling out to H. C. Evans in 1858, Slater became a wholesale bookseller at 120 Elizabeth Street. From 1859 to 1861 he conducted a library in High Street, St. Kilda. He moved to Brisbane and opened a bookshop there in 1864, with branches at Rockhampton and Gympie. He started a printing works and published Slater's Almanac.

The object was the encouragement and development of musical taste and talent in the first place, and in the next, to provide a place where young men might for one evening in the week assemble and pass a few hours in harmony, in every sense of the word. When it is considered that in Sydney the only place of amusement is the theatre, and that when that is not open young bachelors, who form a very large portion of the community in Sydney, have no place to which they can resort for an hour's relaxation after the business of the day is over, such an institution must be regarded as desirable in the highest degree. We have had ah an opportunity of witnessing the manner in which the Harmonic Club's meetings are conducted, and they are such as even the \"rigidly righteous\" could not find any real cause of objection. Music and song are the principal frais of the amusements; social converse, and an occasional toast filling up the interstices. \"Music, mirth, and moderation\" is the standing order of the Society's evenings. The Society numbers now above fifty subscribers; the entrance fee is One Guinea, and the monthly subscription 7s. 6d., which money is expended in music, instruments, and the moderate refreshment, wine, of which the members partake. We cannot too strongly recommend this Society to the notice of the \"nice young bachelors\" of Sydney; we would say to \"all good men\" but that we fear the ladies would quarrel with us. Mr. Slatterie, of the Sydney College, ably fills the office of President at present, and the members meet every Wednesday evening, at Mr. Scrase's in Pitt-street. The club must, we imagine, be under considerable obligations to Mr. Scrase who has allotted a spacious room for the use of the club, which has been very appropriately fitted up at the expense of the members. We again particularly recommend this society to public notice, and will conclude by wishing it every success and prosperity.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Edwin and Samuel Scrase (members); Australian Harmonic Club (group)\n\n\"THE AUSTRALIAN HARMONIC SOCIETY\", Australasian Chronicle (5 June 1841), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31731948\n\nA new society, under the above name, has lately been formed in Sydney by several of the leading harmonists, for the purpose of enjoying a few social hours after the business and cares of the day. We understand that it meets every Wednesday evening, in a private room of Mr. Scrase's, Pitt-street. The amusements of the evening are conducted in a very superior manner. On Wednesday evening last our informant was introduced as a visitor, and was highly delighted with the evening's entertainments, consisting of vocal and instrumental music. Mr. Wallace, in his usual effective style, played several solos on the violin, and Mr. Deane some beautiful overtures on the pianoforte. The eloquence and wit of the president of the society, Mr. Slattelie, contributed much to the enjoyment of the evening.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Spencer Wellington Wallace (violin); John Philip Deane (piano)\n\n\"AUSTRALIAN HARMONIC CLUB\", Sydney Free Press (2 October 1841), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article226358386\n\nThe members of the above Society on Wednesday the 29th last, gave a supper at their club room in Pitt-street; Mr. Slatterie in the chair. Mr. Simmons officiating as Vice-President. The members of the Cecilian Society, who assisted in the performances at the Theatre on Tuesday evening, were of course invited, and added greatly to the hilarity and conviviality of the evening. There were also among the guests assembled upon this occasion, nearly all the leading musical talent of Sydney: Mr. Nathan, Mr. Wallace, Mr. Dean [sic], Mr. Morgan [sic, Worgan], and many other deserving public favourites. After the cloth was removed, several very neat and appropriate speeches were delivered. After Mr. Slatterie had proposed the health of Mr. Simmons, which was received with great applause, Mr. Nathan rose and addressed the meeting, in substance somewhat to the following effect:\n\n\"Gentlemen, in rising to second the toast which has been proposed by the chairman, and so cordially responded to by you, I will take the liberty of offering a few observations, which I feel assured, will not be deemed out of order. When I visited the Theatre on Tuesday evening last, I went there impressed with the idea that the performance of the after-piece Married and Buried, or as it was called when produced with my music in England, The Illustrious Stranger, would certainly fall far short of what I had seen in the Mother Country when aided by the united talents of LISTON, HARLEY, and others of equal notoriety. But I must here promise to you, gentlemen, that this piece, although assisted by the talents of the leading comic actors, by some strange fatality, was damned on the first night of its representation at the Haymarket Theatre. The idea after wards struck me, that by composing some new music for it, it might still become a favourite. I hinted this to the managers of Drury Lane Theatre, and the consequence was, they acted upon the suggestion. The result fully answered my expectations; The Illustrious Stranger was received with the most decided marks of the public approbation, and has continued a favourite ever since. But I now, gentlemen, candidly confess to you, that never during the whole course of my professional career, has my vanity received so great a check as it did in the Victoria Theatre on Tuesday evening last. Here, seventeen thousand miles distant from the Mother Country, The Illustrious Stranger is produced with scarcely a note (except one song) of the original music, and owing to the illimitable acting of Mr. Simmons is received with that applause which his most excellent representation of the character so justly merited. I have now no hesitation in saying, had Mr. LISTON hit upon the same style in his personification of the character of \"Bowbell,\" as was struck out by Mr. Simmons, the piece never would have required my music to render it a favourite with a London audience.\"\n\nThe party broke up at a late hour, after spending one of those agreeable evenings which form so great a contrast to our every day plodding habits.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Joseph Simmons (member, vocalist, actor); Isaac Nathan (musician); George William Worgan (musician); the club had recently patronised an evening at the Royal Victoria Theatre, when Simmons appeared as Benjamin Bowbell, in the musical play The illustrious stranger, for the original London season of which Nathan had composed the music.\n\n\"LITERARY NOTICE. NEW SOUTH WALES MONTHLY MAGAZINE\", The Sun and New South Wales Independent Press (4 February 1843), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article228130749\n\nWe have received the January and February numbers of this Magazine, and sincerely wish it success. The Magazine is conducted by Mr. A. J. Slatterie, late of the Sydney College; and contains articles (we believe) from the pen of Dr. C. Nicholson, Mr. T. H. Braim, Sydney College, Dr. Bland, Mr. A. Becket, Mr. H. Halloran, and Dr. Litchfield . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: The New South Wales monthly magazine (periodical); Thomas Henry Braim (contributor); William Bland (contributor); William A'Beckett (contributor); Henry Halloran (poet, contributor); John Palmer Litchfield (contributor); of the named contributors, it was perhaps most likely Slatterie himself who was author of the following:\n\n\"MUSIC\", The New South Wales monthly magazine (January 1843), 33-35\n\nhttps://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-1913136313/view?sectionId=nla.obj-1913164827&partId=nla.obj-1913164827#page/n32/mode/1up\n\nAs lovers of music we are rejoiced at the facility which our new Magazine affords to add the mite of our endeavours to stimulate the public to greater interest in a Science, which, within the last two years has, we regret to state retrograded rather than advanced amongst us.\n\nSuch a state of things will appear the more anomalous when it is recollected that, within the period in question, so far from there being a diminution as regards quantity in musical talent it has actually increased, and that in addition to the members of the profession already well known, and deservedly esteemed amongst us, we have received valuable accessions from home and the neighbouring colonies, constituting in the aggregate, a stock of musical ability, such as, considering our extreme distance from the old world, we could scarcely have expected to realize in this early period of our colonial existence.\n\nThe question, which therefore naturally suggests itself to our readers is, \"How can the anomaly to which we have adverted, be accounted for?\" Our answer is, that, in the first place, it arises from a want of a proper union amongst the professors of music; and secondly, from the absence of that practical support in musical undertakings, which true lovers of the science are ever found ready to accord in England. For the laxity in the latter respect, however, we think that the members of the profession themselves are in a great degree to blame. If they have the love of music sincerely at heart, no petty jealousies - no considerations of immediate gain should prevent their combining in the common object of exciting the flagging interest of the public, and endeavouring by a steady and well directed effort to place music once more upon that respectable footing which, with materials less eminent than we now possess, it at one time maintained.\n\nIn urging this position, we feel that we are the same time advocating the private interests of the professors themselves; the more musical taste is diffused by the frequency and excellence of public performances, the more anxious will parents be to secure for their children initiation in an accomplishment from the exhibition of which by others they have themselves derived so much pleasure. Musical coteries in private families will likewise be promoted - in which professional aid will be required and remunerated; and even in our places of worship, the choirs of many of which would, we are sorry to say, be a reproach to a country town in England, the necessity of adapting the performance of sacred music to the improved taste of the public, would be forced upon those who dictate the musical arrangements.\n\nHaving ourselves been members of musical societies at Birmingham and Manchester, and seen the benefit of their instrumentality in the diffusion of musical taste amongst all classes of the community, we are anxious by the establishment of the like agency to promote the same desirable ends amongst ourselves. There have been already, we believe, one or two societies in Sydney instituted, no doubt for objects similar to those at home, but whether from defects in their original organization [34] - want of proper economy - mistakes in the management, or a lack of unanimity amongst the members, it is enough that they no longer exist.\n\nWe feel assured, that unless some steps are taken for combining the musical talent of the colony, no efficient performance of good music can be expected. Under present circumstances, the public ear from time to time is tickled by what is called a Grand Concert! Musical Soiree! or other solecism! got up as a desperate expedient to supply the exigencies of some needy musician. Can we wonder that the performances, on such occasions, are of so meagre a description, dependant as the Beneficiare generally is, on the unpaid assistance of such of his brethren, as, from being equally poor with himself, step forward from sympathy, to afford their gratuitous aid. The room, on such instances, exhibits but few \"paying faces,\" the proceeds are generally minus the amount of the printers' bill, however low, and the giver of the entertainment goes home with the consolation of having been encored in the duet of \"Mighty Jove with golden showers,\" by a numerous, but, alas! not a remunerating auditory.\n\nAs a remedy for the evil to which we have thus briefly adverted, we would exhort not only amateurs, but also those who value the true interests of music, to lend their assistance in an arrangement by which to combine for the benefit of science and their own amusement, such ability as may be available in the colony. If an association were formed and a fund raised from which a moderate remuneration could be afforded to the professional members, the best musical talent could be secured, and a means established of performing music of a description not to be attempted under present circumstances.\n\nThe late Oratorio may be taken as an instance of the good effect resulting from amateur and professional association, but however creditable the performances may have been to the conductors and all engaged, we would still regard it as only an indication of how much more may be done under matured management.\n\nWe shall recur to this subject in our next number, and confiding in public patience, will avail ourselves of the space allotted to us for the subject, to treat in a series of articles, upon such particulars connected with the state of music amongst us, as we may consider best calculated to promote the true interests of an art of which we are the ardent votaries.\n\nA certain portion of our pages shall also be devoted to a notice of any musical performances of a public nature that may take place in each month, and also to a review of any new music that may be worthy of observation.\n\nWe hope also to make arrangements for affording to our readers such European intelligence respecting musical affairs as we may deem interesting, and also a notice of every new composition of merit.\n\nThe performance of Rossini's most recent composition \"Stabat Mater\" at the English Opera House, appears to be the subject of greatest interest in the musical circles at home. The London newspapers but echo the opinions of the foreign journals as to the superior merit of this production.\n\nNo concerts have taken place at Sydney during the past month, but [35] we observed one announced for the 11th of next month, intended for the benefit of a young pianiste, on which occasion we are led to expect an exhibition of talent that should not fail to attract a numerous auditory.\n\n\"MUSIC.
