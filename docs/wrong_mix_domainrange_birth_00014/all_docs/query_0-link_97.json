        "text": "The Easybeats\n\nStevie Wright – circa 1966\n\n“Everybody shake / Everybody move” – ‘Good Times’ (Harry Vanda, George Young)\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Great Britain has ‘Beatlemania.’ Scenes of barely comprehensible chaos greet British pop group The Beatles as screaming girls besiege them. In Australia, teenagers have ‘Easyfever’ – or so the publicists and journalists like to call it. A local pop group, The Easybeats, is the focus for ‘Easyfever’. They are more popular than any other Australian combo of that time.\n\nThe frontman of The Easybeats is Stevie Wright (20 December 1947-27 December 2015). He is born Stephen Carlton Wright in Leeds, England. Stevie is the son of George Wright and Dorothy Wright (neè Longden). George Wright is evidently in the army at some time because, in later years, he is referred to as Staff-Sergeant Wright. Stevie will have a ‘baby sister’, Anna-Christine (born 1968?), who is much younger than he.\n\nStevie Wright and his family move from England to Australia when Stevie is 9 years old. Following the Second World War (1939-1945), Australia experiences a boom in immigration. People from other countries – particularly the United Kingdom and Europe – receive assistance from the Australian government to resettle south of the equator. In this sense, the Wright family is typical of ‘New Australians’ of this era.\n\nAt first, Stevie Wright and his family reside in Melbourne, Victoria. However, two years later, they move north to Sydney, New South Wales. They settle in Villawood, in Sydney’s south west, near the Villawood Migrant Hostel.\n\nThe Villawood Migrant Hostel was originally the Villawood Munitions Factory (1941-1945). After the end of World War Two, there was less call for bullets and bombs so the building was decommissioned and handed back to the New South Wales government. On 29 December 1949 the site became the Villawood Migrant Hostel. New arrivals to Australia were offered temporary accommodation here in Nissen huts. These are half-cylinders of corrugated steel that look rather like aircraft hangars. It’s not a particularly attractive or exciting place to live but, for new migrants, it serves a purpose.\n\nStevie Wright is ‘bitten by the rock ‘n’ roll bug at an early age.’ Rock ‘n’ roll music comes along in the mid-1950s, about the same time Stevie’s family arrives in Australia.\n\nStevie Wright attends Sefton High School in Chester Hill, New South Wales. It is a relatively new school, founded in 1962. Two of Stevie’s fellow students will have important roles to play in his life: Fay Walker and George Young. Fay Walker thinks Stevie is cute and has a crush on him, but that’s all it is at this time. She will not re-enter his life until decades later. George Young, like Stevie, will become one of The Easybeats.\n\nGeorge Redburn Young (6 November 1946-22 October 2017) is born in Glasgow, Scotland. He is the son of William Young and Margaret Young (whose maiden name is, ironically, also Young). William Young’s past is made up of a number of different jobs. He started as a wheel boy in a rope works. William Young then became a machine and saw operator in an asbestos and cement business. In 1940, Young joined the Royal Air Force and served as a flight engine mechanic during World War Two. After the war ends, William Young works as a yard man for a builder and then becomes a postman. His spouse, Margaret, is a housewife. George Young is the fifth of eight children in the family. The eight children are: Stephen (born on 28 June 1933), Margaret Jr. (born on 2 May 1935), John (born on 17 May 1937), Alexander (28 December 1938-4 August 1997), William Jr. (born on 15 December 1940), George (6 November 1946-22 October 2017), Malcolm (6 January 1953-18 November 2017) and Angus (born on 31 March 1955). The Young clan make their home at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill district of Glasgow. It is quite a musical family. The eldest child, Stephen (or ‘Stevie’) plays accordion while George’s elder brothers John and Alex both play guitar. However, it is the only girl amongst the youngsters, Margaret Jr., who brings early rock ‘n’ roll records into the household and encourages her brothers to share her appreciation of Chuck Berry and his ilk. The winter of 1962-1963 is particularly cold and this prompts William Young – described as a ‘labourer who had long been jobless’ – to consider moving to sunny Australia with his family. Accordingly, the Young family boards an aeroplane in late June 1963 to fly to Australia. There are two exceptions to this exodus: George Young’s elder brothers John and Alexander. John comes to Australia separately by himself. Alexander remains in the U.K. Under the stagename of George Alexander, Alexander Young later joins the psychedelic pop group called Grapefruit (1967-1969) who will record for Apple, the record label The Beatles will create in 1968.\n\nIn Australia, George Young stays in the Villawood Migrant Hostel with his parents and siblings for a time. Eventually, the Young family moves to 4 Burleigh Street in Burwood (a Sydney suburb). George Young attends Sefton High School, the same school as Stevie Wright. Although George and Stevie are aware of each other, the two lads don’t appear to be particularly close. This could be because George is a year older than Stevie and so the boys would be in different classes.\n\nStevie Wright’s career in music begins when he starts singing for a local band called The Outlaws. In 1964 Stevie forms Chris Langdon & The Langdells. Stevie is the frontman of the group; he uses the alias of Chris Langdon. The group starts out playing surf music and instrumentals inspired by acts like The Ventures (U.S.A.) and The Shadows (U.K.). When The Beatles’ music reaches Australia, the group re-invents itself to play ‘beat’ music in the style of The Beatles. Chris Langdon & The Langdells are playing a show in mid-1964 at Suzie Wong’s Disco when the band’s manager, Alan Kissick, introduces Stevie Wright to two Dutch boys who have come along to the gig: Harry Vanda and Dick Diamonde.\n\nHarry Vanda is born Johannes Hendrikus Jacob van den Berg on 22 March 1946 in Voorburg, a Dutch town in the province of South Holland, the Netherlands. He teaches himself to play guitar in the basement of a tenement house in The Hague where his family lives. Johannes (Harry) plays lead guitar for The Starfighters, a rock ‘n’ roll band based in The Hague. The van den Berg family moves to Sydney, Australia, in 1963 when Johannes (Harry) is 17 years old. Like the Young family, the van den Bergs also find accommodation at the Villawood Migrant Hostel. Johannes (Harry) is ‘a tall, skinny teenager with a strong accent.’ This makes him a target for ‘local hooligans looking for punching practice.’ Music provides Johannes (Harry) with some respite. It also brings him into contact with a fellow young Dutch immigrant at the Villawood Migrant Hostel, a boy who will later come to be known as Dick Diamonde.\n\nDick Diamonde is born Dingeman Adriaan Henry van der Sluijs (sometimes rendered as Vandersluys) on 28 December 1947 in Hilversum, a city in the province of North Holland, the Netherlands. Dingeman (Dick) has a younger sister named Susan. They are the children of Harry van der Sluijs and his wife. The family immigrates to Australia when Dingeman (Dick) is 4 years old. This means that Dick Diamonde is in Australia (in 1952) before Stevie Wright (1957), George Young (1963) or Harry Vanda (also 1963). However, like George and Harry, Dick and his family reside in the Villawood Migrant Hostel. Dick is raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, a rather strict branch of Christianity. This causes some friction between Dick and his parents when he becomes famous with The Easybeats as his parents feel children should not idolise their son – or any other mortals.\n\nHarry Vanda and Dick Diamonde are quite impressed with Stevie Wright’s showmanship. Stevie introduces the boys to George Young as well. It seems possible that Harry and Dick already knew George through the Villawood Migrant Hostel community though. The budding musicians had already tried out another singer, John Bell, but they prefer Stevie Wright. The group still needs a drummer. That role is filled by Gordon ‘Snowy’ Fleet.\n\nGordon ‘Snowy’ Fleet is born in Liverpool, England, in the United Kingdom. His date of birth is usually given as 16 August 1945. However, it is claimed that his age was changed to fit better with the rest of The Easybeats. Fleet was actually born in 1940 and is ‘several years older than the rest.’ Gordon Fleet grows up in the Liverpool area, his family living in Bootle on the Merseyside and at Wellbrow Road in Walton (an area of Liverpool). The Liverpool area is also home to The Beatles. The success of that group spawns a whole ‘Meseybeat’ scene around Liverpool. Gordon Fleet is an apprentice builder and aspiring musician who enjoys the music scene around Liverpool’s Cavern Club. He marries his wife Maureen while still in England and they have a daughter, Amanda (born in 1962).\n\nGordon Fleet relocates to Australia with his wife and daughter. Fleet meets the other future members of The Easybeats while on a train ride. The band rehearses in the laundry room at the Villawood Migrant Hostel. Because he is a bit older, Gordon Fleet at first takes on the role of managing and organising the band. In response, the boys nickname him ‘Snowy’ because of his jet-black hair. This is typical of the same sort of perverse Australian humour that sees people with red hair nicknamed ‘Bluey.’ Snowy suggests the group’s stage uniform of black suits and ties with white business shirts in imitation of The Beatles’ look at the time. It is also Snowy’s idea to call the group The Easybeats. He is perhaps inspired by one of the British bands he saw at the Cavern Club, a group called The Easy Beats (formerly The Texans).\n\nA decision is also made to anglicise the names of the two members of The Easybeats who were born in the Netherlands. So Johannes van den Berg becomes Harry Vanda and Dingeman van der Sluijs becomes Dick Diamonde.\n\nNow, in 1964, the founding – and definitive – line-up of The Easybeats is assembled: Stevie Wright (vocals), George Young (guitar), Harry Vanda (guitar), Dick Diamonde (bass) and Snowy Fleet (drums).\n\nIn the early years of The Easybeats, their vocalist is sometimes referred to as ‘Little Stevie Wright.’ There are two reasons for this. Firstly, Stevie is only 16 years old (though bassist Dick Diamonde is actually eight days younger and is the junior member of the quintet). Rock music has a history of performers like Little Richard and Little Stevie Wonder who were given the same prefix because they also started their careers early in their youths – even if Stevie Wonder (like Stevie Wright) outgrew the tag. Secondly, Stevie Wright is of fairly small stature, standing five feet, seven inches, tall.\n\nThe Easybeats first gig is at a pub in Goulburn Street, Surry Hills, Sydney. However, they are thrown out for being ‘too loud and filthy.’ The lads walk up the street to another venue with the promising name of Beatle Village. The doorman at that venue is Dutch, so Harry Vanda and Dick Diamonde manage to talk their way in for the group. Beatle Village is located in the basement of a pub at Taylor Square on Oxford Street in Darlinghurst, Sydney. The Easybeats are well received enough at Beatle Village to earn a residency there and the band works to hone their sound.\n\nOn 11 December 1964 Easybeats guitarist Harry Vanda marries Pamela Joyce Higgins in Bankstown, New South Wales. Harry and Pam go on to have a son, Johan (John) (born in January 1966).\n\nOn the evening of Harry Vanda’s wedding day, The Easybeats meet Mike Vaughan at a dance in Hornsby, New South Wales. A real estate agent turned pop music entrepreneur, Mike Vaughan becomes The Easybeats’ new manager. Easybeats drummer Snowy Fleet cedes his informal role as the group’s manager to Mike Vaughan.\n\nIn 1965 Easybeats vocalist Stevie Wright meets Gail Baxter. Both of them are 17 years old. “She was gorgeous,” says Stevie. “She had class, innocence; she had all the things that I loved.” Gail Baxter becomes Stevie Wright’s girlfriend.\n\nEasybeats manager Mike Vaughan arranges a deal for the group with Albert Productions. This is an independent record production company established by Ted Albert. The music publishers J. Albert & Son is owned by Ted’s family. Albert Productions secures a recording contract with EMI’s Parlophone label. At the time (1965), this is the same label to which The Beatles are signed. With all these pieces in place, The Easybeats are ready to begin their recording career.\n\nIn simple terms, The Easybeats’ music may be described as rock ‘n’ roll or pop music. Sometimes it is said to be ‘beat’ music. This is a term associated with The Beatles and other so-called Merseybeat groups (Gerry And The Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer And The Dakotas) from Liverpool, England. More broadly, The Easybeats also fall into the sound of ‘British invasion’ acts. This term is applied to a raft of British pop groups who ‘invade’ the U.S. popular music charts in the wake of The Beatles’ American success. Other British invasion acts include The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Hollies, The Who and The Kinks. The Easybeats share The Beatles’ love of a catchy tune, but their music is infused with a grittier, blues-influenced sound more in keeping with The Rolling Stones. The absurdity of classing The Easybeats as either a Merseybeat act or a British invasion band is that The Easybeats are not from either Liverpool specifically or Britain in general. It is true that drummer Snowy Fleet was born in Liverpool and vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young were born in the United Kingdom, but The Easybeats is an Australian band. Although they may be influenced by their British peers ‘it seems a year out-of-date [because] rock music filters only very slowly across the Pacific.’ On the other hand, there is a raw immediacy to the early Easybeats songs. There is something gloriously unfiltered in their ability to tap into the veins of rock ‘n’ roll’s life’s-blood.\n\nThe Easybeats are blessed with a magnetic frontman in the person of Stevie Wright. He possesses a riveting full-throated yowl. Live, he is ‘renowned for his energetic stage performance, which includes acrobatic back-flips and mod dance moves.’ “Stevie was a born entertainer,” says drummer Snowy Fleet. “He was electrifying. There’d be girls jumping on top of him. It was so exciting.”\n\nIn the beginning, most of The Easybeats’ repertoire is co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young. “I did the lyrics,” professes Stevie. This means that it is George Young who writes the melodies. Both guitarist Harry Vanda and drummer Snowy Fleet contribute songs on the early Easybeats discs. Bassist Dick Diamonde has only a group songwriting credit. In 1966 Harry Vanda replaces Stevie Wright as George Young’s songwriting partner. The circumstances behind this change will be detailed later at the relevant point in this narrative. The Vanda and Young songwriting team is justly well-regarded. All Easybeats songs mentioned here are by Vanda and Young unless otherwise stated. The Easybeats record a handful of cover versions, but they are better known for their original songs.\n\nThe Easybeats begin by recording some songs at the 2UW Theatre. Formerly belonging to a Sydney radio station, this now-abandoned facility is owned by Albert Productions. From the bunch of tunes the group tries out, two are selected for their first single.\n\n‘For My Woman’ (AUS no. 33), The Easybeats’ first single, is released on 18 March 1965. This ‘bluesy’ track is co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Wright. It is produced by Ted Albert and released on the Parlophone label. These components – songwriters, producer and record label – will be repeated on each release by The Easybeats for the next year or two. ‘For My Woman’ is ‘an ominous garage rock bolero.’ Stevie Wright shakes maracas like a witch-doctor over this unearthly slice of musical voodoo. Harry Vanda contributes a strangled guitar solo. Although ‘For My Woman’ is very striking, it may not be very representative of The Easybeats’ sound. On ‘For My Woman’ – and subsequent works – The Easybeats are well served by producer Ted Albert. ‘He simply lets the band cut [their songs], merely making sure the music comes out right on vinyl.’ This respectful, non-interfering style of production captures the inherent vitality of The Easybeats. The flipside of the ‘For My Woman’ single is ‘Say That You’re Mine’. This is the first song co-written by Harry Vanda and George Young. At the time, ‘Harry is still learning English’ so the songwriting efforts of the recent Dutch émigré remain fairly limited. ‘For My Woman’ is picked up by a local Sydney radio station for airplay, but is only a minor hit.\n\nFollowing their first single, The Easybeats play their first gigs in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia’s other major rock music capital. When the group is introduced to Melbourne radio, they get involved in a brawl at the Hotel Windsor. The patrons at that conservative venue are outraged at the length of the hair of the members of The Easybeats. While in Melbourne, The Easybeats record their second single at Armstrong Studios. Some overdubs are added in Sydney. This becomes the new pattern for most Easybeats recordings. The basic work is laid down at Armstrong’s in Melbourne and the results are tweaked and polished in Sydney.\n\nThe Easybeats’ second single, ‘She’s So Fine’ (AUS no. 3), is released on 27 May 1965. The song is co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young. ‘She’s So Fine’ takes off ‘like a rocket [and is] a frantic, hook-laden…two minutes of raw excitement.’ In the lyrics, Stevie Wright babbles, “Woke up bright and early this morning / My little girl was not in sight / I been lookin’ everywhere / Mornin’, noon and daylight / ‘Cos she’s so fine.” As the pace accelerates, Wright urges guitarist Harry Vanda, “Come on, Harry,” before the guitar solo. The B side is the group composition ‘The Old Oak Tree’. ‘She’s So Fine’, ‘a more uptempo song’ than ‘For My Woman’, becomes ‘a breakthrough hit’ for The Easybeats. It reaches no. 3 on the Australian chart used by modern historians but it reached no. 1 on some competing charts of the same era. George Young recalls the moment rather sourly: “With a no. 1 record, that’s where all the bullsh*t started. We weren’t really playing anymore. We were just trying to satisfy demand…It took all the enjoyment out of playing. From then on the gigs became a chore. We went out and did our half hour, nobody could hear us…”\n\nCatapulted to national fame, things change for The Easybeats. Their first single, ‘For My Woman’ (AUS no. 5), is re-released in July 1965 and achieves a higher chart ranking than it did when first issued. The Easybeats concerts and public appearances are ‘regularly marked by intense fan hysteria similar to Beatlemania, soon dubbed by the Australian press as “Easyfever”.’ “I don’t know how we survived,” says drummer Snowy Fleet. “I couldn’t even hear myself play drums.” The group’s publicity is also carefully managed. Snowy’s age is trimmed by five years so he is supposedly born in 1945 rather than 1940. The marriages of Snowy Fleet to Maureen and Harry Vanda to Pam are concealed. Visits to the band members by wives or girlfriends are strictly controlled or forbidden. A fan magazine unthinkingly prints guitarist George Young’s Burwood address and his family are swarmed by female fans until the police are summoned. The Easybeats may have hoped to emulate The Beatles, but in a strange way the media and fans also give The Easybeats the same sort of hothouse conditions The Beatles are experiencing.\n\nBy 1965 Margaret Young Jr., the elder sister of Easybeats guitarist George Young, is married to Sammy Horsburgh (born on 25 March 1937). Sammy acts as the head roadie for The Easybeats.\n\nFrom June 1965 to July 1966 The Easybeats are ‘Australia’s top pop act.’\n\nThe third Easybeats single, ‘Wedding Ring’ (AUS no. 7), is released on 25 August 1965. This is co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young. In this jittery burst of speed, Stevie declares, “All I want is a love from you / A love that’s true / And all you want, want, want / Is a wedding ring.” Obviously, Stevie’s not yet ready to ‘settle down.’ Speaking about ‘Wedding Ring’, George Young says, “With that track we tried to be commercial, but at the same time, be a little bit different. It paid off, but it wasn’t as big a hit record as it should have been. We decided then that we wanted to get out of Australia.” However, it will be a while before The Easybeats realise their international ambitions.\n\n‘Easy’ (1965) (AUS no. 4), released on 23 September, is the debut album by The Easybeats. The album’s cover photo, taken by Ian Morgan, shows The Easybeats performing on ‘Sing, Sing, Sing’ (1962-1965), a pop music show broadcast by Australia’s Seven Network. Most of ‘Easy’ was recorded at EMI Studios in Sydney in two consecutive all night sessions. The exception is ‘She’s So Fine’ which, as mentioned earlier, was recorded at Armstrong Studios in Melbourne and completed in Sydney. ‘She’s So Fine’ is the only one of The Easybeats’ singles included on this album. Most of the songs on ‘Easy’ are co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young, but guitarist Harry Vanda and drummer Snowy Fleet also both contribute songs. ‘Easy’ is ‘one of the earliest albums of all original material that is written by an Australian group.’ ‘Easy’ is described as ‘one of the best of all British invasion albums’ – though, of course, The Easybeats is an Australian band (whatever their migrant roots).\n\nA feature of the Australian recording industry at this time in history is EP (Extended Play) records. Typically, an EP has four tracks. It is more than a single, but less than an album. The Easybeats issue a number of EPs. Their first EP, ‘She’s So Fine’, is released in October 1965. The four tracks on this disc are: ‘Say That You’re Mine’, ‘For My Woman’, ‘The Old Oak Tree’ and ‘She’s So Fine’. ‘For My Woman’ was The Easybeats’ first single and ‘Say That You’re Mine’ was the B side of that single. ‘She’s So Fine’ was the group’s biggest hit single to date and ‘The Old Oak Tree’ was its B side.\n\nThe Easybeats close out 1965 with the single ‘Sad And Lonely And Blue’ (AUS no. 21) backed with ‘Easy As Can Be’. Both songs are co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young. The ‘blues-based’ ‘Sad And Lonely And Blue’ combines melancholia with some stinging guitar. The chanting pop of ‘Easy As Can Be’ seems to be a deliberate pun on the group’s name.\n\nOn 13 January 1966 The Easybeats release the single ‘Women (Make You Feel Alright)’ (AUS no. 4) b/w ‘In My Book’. Snowy Fleet’s drums kick off the song, a few guitar chords are plucked, and then work into a shuffle as vocalist Stevie Wright slides in with the exclamation, “Mmm! Women / All around the place / Come and see me / Face to face / If you got troubles / I’m the man for you / If you are worried / You’ll be smilin’ soon / I’ll make you feel alright.” ‘Women’ seems to announce a new era. If The Easybeats’ earlier singles still seemed to show characteristics more associated with 1950s rock ‘n’ roll, ‘Women’ sounds defiantly contemporary. It is slicker and more musically accomplished – even if Stevie still baits the poor drummer with a sneering, “Come onn, Snow!” Both sides of this single are co-written by Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young. Co-author Young states, “We went through that musicians’ phase where we tried to get clever. You try to prove that you’re more than a three-chord rock ‘n’ roll band. So we gave up all pretensions and gave the kids what they wanted. They wanted to dance and sing to good happy choruses, so we knocked out this thing in about two minutes called ‘Women’.” ‘In My Book’, the flipside, is a slow-burning diary entry with Stevie’s gasps, sighs and chuckles. It has also been described as ‘a soppy, melodramatic ballad.’\n\nThe Easybeats EP ‘Easy As Can Be’ is released in February 1966. The four tracks on this disc are: ‘Easy As Can Be’, ‘Sad And Lonely And Blue’, ‘Me Or You’ and ‘Wedding Ring’. Most of these have already been discussed as singles. The exception, ‘Me Or You’, is an early Harry Vanda and George Young co-composition.\n\nThe next 1966 single by The Easybeats is ‘Come And See Her’ (AUS no. 3). This song is co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young. In ‘Come And See Her’, the narrator is so concerned for his love-struck girlfriend that he resorts to summoning a doctor. The song is written to spotlight bassist Dick DIamonde. Stevie Wright’s lead vocal is haunted by Dick’s sepulchral repetition of the song’s title over and over. Stylistically, this is a throwback to the incantatory ‘For My Woman’.\n\nThe Easybeats’ second album, ‘It’s 2 Easy’ (1966) (AUS no. 3), is released on 29 March. The basic tracks for this set are laid down at Armstrong’s Studio in Melbourne while The Easybeats are on tour in that part of the country. Additional work and fine tuning takes place at EMI Studios in Sydney. Included on ‘It’s 2 Easy’ are the following songs, all of which were released earlier: ‘Wedding Ring’, ‘Sad And Lonely And Blue’, Easy As Can Be’, ‘Women’, ‘In My Book’ and ‘Come And See Her’. Nearly all of the contents of this album are co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young, though drummer Snowy Fleet also contributes one song. By virtue of being so jam-packed with hits, ‘It’s 2 Easy’ is probably the best album in The Easybeats’ catalogue. The group’s forte is really singles rather than albums though.\n\nIn early 1966, while The Easybeats go on a concert tour of Australia, their manager, Mike Vaughan, heads to New York to try and secure an international record deal for the group. ‘Despite an initial lack of interest,’ he obtains a deal with United Artists. The Easybeats had already expressed international ambitions. In 1966 it is not really practical for the group to seek to conquer foreign territories while remaining in Australia. So a decision is made to move to the U.K. on 10 July 1966. This may seem a little odd given that Mike Vaughan went to the U.S.A. to get a record deal. However, three of the five members of The Easybeats were born in the U.K. and, thanks to the continuing prominence of The Beatles, England is really the centre of rock music at this time in 1966.\n\nAside from The Easybeats’ own music, songwriters Stevie Wright and George Young supply a song for Australian singer Johnny Young (no relation to George). ‘Step Back’ (AUS no. 1) is released in May 1966 and is a hit for Johnny Young and his band Kompany. Johnny Young is later the compere of the Ten Network television program ‘Young Talent Time’ (1971-1988) which fosters promising up-and-coming singers.\n\nAs The Easybeats gear up for their relocation to England, the familiar prohibition against wives and girlfriends resurfaces. However, at least some people find a way around this. Drummer Snowy Fleet’s wife Maureen will go to London with him, even if their daughter Amanda (‘Mandy’) stays with her grandparents. Vocalist Stevie Wright’s girlfriend Gail Baxter will go to England too and work in a casino there as a waitress. The person the decision affects most is guitarist Harry Vanda’s wife Pam Higgins who is told that she is not allowed to go to England.\n\nOn Sunday, 3 July 1966, Australia’s Seven Network broadcasts ‘The Easybeats’ (a.k.a. ‘The Coca-Cola Special’). In this television program, the group performs a number of their hits as a parting gesture before leaving Australia.\n\nIn the early hours of 4 July 1966 Easybeats guitarist Harry Vanda returns to his Sydney flat. He is shocked to find the dead body of his wife. ‘Distraught that she was not allowed to go to England with him, Pam Vanda had committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills.’ Harry and Pam’s 5 month old son Johan (John) is sent to live with Harry’s parents who have left Australia and returned to Holland. The boy remains in that country and in later years marries a Dutch woman.\n\nDespite this tragedy, The Easybeats, their manager Mike Vaughan and their roadie Sammy Horsburgh board the plane to fly to England on 10 July 1966. There is a stopover in Perth, Western Australia, for a farewell gig. “There was about eight thousand kids waiting for us [at the airport],” according to drummer Snowy Fleet. A more conservative estimate suggests there were four thousand fans at the airport, but it is a big crowd in any case.\n\nOn 15 July 1966 United Artists issues ‘Come And See Her’ as The Easybeats’ first U.K. single. However this single does not make any impression on the U.K. charts. Similarly, ‘Women’ – retitled as ‘Make You Feel Alright (Women)’ – is issued as the group’s first U.S. single.\n\nThe EP ‘Easyfever’ (AUS no. 1) is released on 4 August 1966. The Easybeats recorded the four songs on this disc before they left Australia. This EP is still issued by Albert Productions via Parlophone. ‘I’ll Make You Happy’ is notable for guitarist Harry Vanda sharing songwriting credit with vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young. The song’s dynamic arrangement is abetted by the urgency of Wright’s vocals: “Give you lovin’ all the time / Give you kissin’ just like wine / Do his lips taste sweeter than mine? / No, no, no / I’ll make you happy / Just like your mama wants / I’ll make you happy just like your daddy said.” ‘Too Much’ is co-written by Wright and Young. The song is built on a clipped riff from George Young and, contrary to its title, is marked by restraint in its stop-and-start tight performance. Wright and Young are also the authors of the other two songs on this all-new EP: ‘A Very Special Man’ and ‘Tryin’ So Hard’. Unusually, the ‘Easyfever’ EP sells so well it tops the singles chart in Australia.\n\nIn London, The Easybeats cram together into a flat in Willesden Green. The band records some songs at EMI’s Abbey Road studio where The Beatles usually record. The sessions are supervised by The Easybeats’ usual producer, Ted Albert. However, The Easybeats’ new label, United Artists, rejects these recordings. United Artists want a couple of changes made. Firstly, they want to replace Ted Albert with Shel Talmy, the producer who has been working with British bands The Who and The Kinks. Secondly, United Artists express the view that The Easybeats’ earlier material was ‘unsophisticated’ and a change needs to be made in the songwriting department. This is how guitarist Harry Vanda comes to replace vocalist Stevie Wright as the songwriting partner of guitarist George Young. “Oh, it demoralised me!” exclaims Stevie Wright years later when reminded of United Artists judgment that the songs he co-wrote were ‘unsophisticated.’ “And Harry and George were continuously working together…and yeah, I was just in a huff and took it badly, and uh…was jealous probably of Harry a bit.”\n\nThe Easybeats cut some tracks with Shel Talmy in September 1966.\n\nBack in Australia, a new Easybeats single, ‘Sorry’ (AUS no. 1), is released on 13 October 1966. ‘Sorry’ was recorded before The Easybeats left Australia. Accordingly, this song is co-written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young. ‘Sorry’ is produced by Ted Albert and is released on the Parlophone label. ‘Sorry’ opens with a startling, stuttered guitar riff that seems purpose built for go-go dancers in cages. The song’s hook is the result of ‘George’s innovative guitar technique, in which he “scratched” the pick across the stopped strings to create a percussive effect.’ Negotiating the corners of the arrangement like a racing car driver, in the lyrics Stevie Wright notes, “Had a date at seven / With a girl named Fleur / Then I just remembered / Had a date with her / Sorry, sorry, sorry / That I / Didn’t go last night.”\n\nAlthough the changes in producer and songwriters may have caused some angst amongst The Easybeats, it is hard to argue with the result. The first Easybeats release produced by Shel Talmy is the definitive Easybeats single. ‘Friday On My Mind’ (AUS no. 1, UK no. 6, US no. 16) is released on 14 October 1966 in the U.K. (the day after ‘Sorry’ is released in Australia). ‘Friday On My Mind’ is not released in Australia until 17 November 1966. The opening lines are, “Monday morning feel so bad / Everybody seems to nag me / Come on Tuesday, I feel better, even my old man looks good / Wednesday just won’t go, Thursday goes too slow / I’ll have Friday on my mind.” Up to this point, the song has been slowly building in tempo, the tension ramped up by yammering backing vocals, but it now bursts into glorious bloom: “Gonna have fun in the city / Be with my girl, she’s so pretty / She looks fine tonight / She is outta sight to me.” It then drops back to mutter, “Monday, I’ll have Friday on my mind,” as the guitars tick like clocks and the cycle begins again. ‘Friday On My Mind’ ushers in the era of guitarists Harry Vanda and George Young as the principal songwriters for The Easybeats. Harry Vanda claims that the origins of ‘Friday On My Mind’ begin with the band watching a movie – perhaps the French film ‘Sweet and Sour’ (1963)? – that features an appearance by the French vocal group The Swingle Singers. “It went tudutudututudu, which made us all laugh,” Harry recalls. “In the train back from the gig, we were imitating them and suddenly it sounded good. They became the first notes of ‘Friday On My Mind’.” Vocalist Stevie Wright observes, “It’s pretty well every man, woman’s sort of song: going to work and longing for the end of the week, head down, rear up, ready to go for Friday.” When it is suggested to co-author George Young that ‘Friday On My Mind’ is ‘a working class anthem,’ he claims it has “more to do with their outlook on the world, than any class statement.” What makes ‘Friday On My Mind’ The Easybeats best song? The factors that contribute to that outcome include a relatable lyric, a catchy melody, a clever arrangement and the trademark energy of the group. Also contributing to the song’s place in history is its commercial impact. ‘Friday On My Mind’ is ‘a worldwide hit.’ The Easybeats is the ‘first rock act from Australia to score an international pop hit.’ It is ‘a hit throughout Europe,’ ‘reaches the top twenty in the United States’ and sells ‘over one million worldwide.’ The flipside to ‘Friday On My Mind’ is ‘Made My Bed: Gonna Lie In It’, a pop tune with a complex arrangement and a quirky sense of humour. It is written by George Young alone.\n\nIn Australia, The Easybeats’ third album, ‘Volume 3’ (1966) (AUS no. 17), is released on 3 November. This is after the U.K. release of ‘Friday On My Mind’ (14 October 1966) but before the Australian release of that single (17 November 1966). Consequently, ‘Friday On My Mind’ is not on this disc. In fact, all the material was recorded before The Easybeats went to the U.K. This means the album is released by Parlophone. Ted Albert produces the album but this time shares credit with Tony Geary, Parlophone Australia’s artists & repertoire manager. Nearly all the tracks are co-written by the old regime of vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young, with the exception being a track written by drummer Snowy Fleet. The earlier single ‘Sorry’ is on this album as is ‘Funny Feelin’’, the B side of that single. The best of the rest of ‘Volume 3’ is probably ‘You Said That’, a sharp imitation of Beatles-style pop.\n\nThe Easybeats’ live debut in the U.K. takes place on 13 November 1966. The venue is the Saville Theatre, which is owned by Brian Epstein, The Beatles’ manager. However, The Easybeats are on the bottom of the bill. The headliners are visiting U.S. vocal group The Four Tops. A number of U.K. acts play supporting sets on this show and, although none of them are particularly noteworthy, they are all given prominence over The Easybeats.\n\nOn 17 March 1967 United Artists releases ‘Who’ll Be The One’ as The Easybeats’ follow-up single to the highly successful ‘Friday On My Mind’. ‘Who’ll Be The One’ is not released in Australia until months later. ‘Who’ll Be The One’ throws in all the group’s musical tricks: a ticking-clock guitar opening, the guitars then charge forth, the lead guitar cries, the drums beat a tom-tom, there is a sing-along pop chorus. Despite all this, it is ‘a commercial failure in the U.K.’ The band had been against releasing ‘Who’ll Be The One’ as a single as they felt it wasn’t strong enough. George Young, who co-writes the song with Harry Vanda, concisely describes ‘Who’ll Be The One’ as “crap.”\n\nIn March-April 1967 The Easybeats go on a concert tour of Europe as a support act for The Rolling Stones.\n\nAround this time, director Peter Clifton films The Easybeats for a presentation on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television network. It is filmed as ‘Heaven and Hell’ but the title is later changed to ‘Easy Come, Easy Go’. However, the tapes are lost and the project does not air. The footage is unearthed forty-two years later. Restored and re-edited, the end product is shown at film festivals in 2012.\n\nThe Easybeats musical recordings in 1967 follow a confusing and torturous path. Different versions of their first album for United Artists are issued in the U.K. and the U.S. In Australia, tracks from these albums are issued on EPs or singles rather than as an album ‘due to contractual issues.’\n\nThe U.K. album ‘Good Friday’ (1967) is released in May. Shel Talmy is credited as producer and the disc is issued by United Artists. ‘Friday On My Mind’, its B side, guitarist George Young’s ‘Made My Bed: Gonna Lie In It’ and ‘Who’ll Be The One’ are all on this disc. ‘Do You Have A Soul’ threads a complex backing vocal about sinewy ropes of guitarwork. ‘Saturday Night’ is an ode to meeting girls that is, again, given prominent background harmonies. ‘You Me, We Love’ brings a chant to its muscular rock. ‘Pretty Girl’ is a light and charming pop song directed to the dolly birds of swingin’ 1960s London. ‘Remember Sam’ chides a girl for choosing Sam…or Mike…rather than the narrator and expresses these sentiments over staccato guitars. ‘Happy Is The Man’ puts all these elements together, backing harmonies, girl-watching and pop hooks. All of these songs are co-written by Easybeats guitarists Harry Vanda and George Young. However, United Artists doesn’t seem to have a lot of faith in the original material, because the disc also includes for the first time a trio of cover versions. The Easybeats perform their own interpretations of Ike And Tina Turner’s 1966 song ‘River Deep, Mountain High’, Big Mama Thornton’s 1952 song ‘Hound Dog’ (made famous by Elvis Presley in 1956) and ‘See Line Woman’, a folk song (‘Sea Lion Woman’) popularised by Nina Simone in 1964. ‘Good Friday’ fails to chart in the U.K.\n\nThe U.S. album ‘Friday On My Mind’ (1967) (US no. 180) is also released in May. It omits ‘Hound Dog’ in favour of ‘Make You Feel Alright (Women)’, The Easybeats’ first U.S. single. The U.S. version of this album will be released in Australia – but not until October 1970.\n\nWhile United Artists struggles to market The Easybeats in the U.K. and U.S., the group returns to Australia for a concert tour beginning on 13 May 1967. On this national tour, The Easybeats are supported by The Twilights (another Australian act just back from the U.K.) and other local bands. Guitarist George Young believes this tour was “probably the highlight of the group’s career…We didn’t come back with any of the standard excuses for failure.” In other words, while virtually every other Australian band limped home after fruitless overseas adventures, The Easybeats had achieved an international hit with the single ‘Friday On My Mind’. The band is feted with a civic reception at Sydney Town Hall.\n\nHowever, after this Australian tour, drummer Gordon ‘Snowy’ Fleet quits The Easybeats. ‘Fleet was unhappy about the time he had to spend away from his wife and young child.’ Snowy’s wife, Maureen, had not been permitted to return to Australia for the 1967 tour and their daughter Mandy had been living with her grandparents for almost twelve months now. In the wake of Snowy’s resignation, Maureen comes home and the Fleet family settles in Perth, Western Australia.\n\n‘The Best Of The Easybeats + Pretty Girl’ (1967) (AUS no. 3) is the first Easybeats compilation album. Released by Parlophone in June, this set brings together some of the group’s past hits with some more recent material.\n\nWithout drummer Snowy Fleet, The Easybeats return to the U.K. A new single, ‘Heaven And Hell’ (AUS no. 8, UK no. 55, US no. 92) b/w ‘Pretty Girl’, is released on 22 June 1967. In recording this single, The Easybeats employed session musician Freddie Smith to play drums. Smith had previously worked with George Alexander (a.k.a. Alexander Young, elder brother of Easybeats guitarist George Young) in Bobby Patrick & The Big Six. Officially, ‘Heaven And Hell’ is the last Easybeats single produced by Shel Talmy. Less officially, it is claimed that the song is actually produced by Glyn Johns (who had been working as recording engineer for Shel Talmy and will soon become a well-known record producer in his own right). As the name suggests, ‘Heaven And Hell’ alternates energetic rock passages with an angelic and hushed section. It is also said to be The Easybeats’ first nod towards ‘current psychedelic pop.’ ‘Heaven And Hell’ encounters ‘censorship problems.’ It is banned by the British BBC radio network simply for using the word ‘hell’ in the title. In the U.S.A., the line “Hell / Is knowing that your face has gone red / Discovering someone else in your bed” discourages airplay. So, once again, a hit follow-up to ‘Friday On My Mind’ proves elusive since ‘Heaven And Hell’ is ‘disappointing in the U.S. and U.K.’\n\nAfter extensive auditions, The Easybeats settle on Tony Cahill as their new drummer.\n\nTony Cahill (20 December 1941-13 August 2014) is born in the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell. He has a sister named Robyn. Early in his career in music, Tony Cahill has a stint entertaining on cruise ships. Directly before joining The Easybeats, Cahill plays drums in an Australian band called The Purple Hearts. When he joins The Easybeats, the group is just embarking on its new psychedelic phase and their music is becoming increasingly complex. Guitarist Harry Vanda admits, “We gave him drum beats that no sane man with two arms and legs could play.”\n\nIn Australia, ‘Who’ll Be The One’ (AUS no. 14) gets a belated release as a single in August 1967 (it had been released on 17 March 1967 in the U.K.). In Australia, it is coupled with ‘Do You Have A Soul’ and ‘Saturday Night’, two other tracks from ‘Good Friday’ (U.K.)/ ‘Friday On My Mind’ (U.S.). The Australian EP ‘Friday On My Mind’ issued in August 1967 brings together ‘Friday On My Mind’, ‘Sorry’, ‘Who’ll Be The One’ and ‘Made My Bed: Gonna Lie In It’, all of which have been previously released.\n\nIn August 1967 The Easybeats go on a concert tour of the U.S.A. as a supporting act for American singer Gene Pitney. During this tour, Easybeats vocalist Stevie Wright reportedly has a brief relationship with New York-based Australian journalist Lillian Roxon.\n\nThe next Easybeats single, ‘Falling Off The Edge Of The World’ (UK no. 136), is released on 5 September 1967. This song was recorded in the U.S.A. while The Easybeats were on tour in that country. Lyrically, ‘Falling Off The Edge Of The World’ is a stab at adult marital drama. The rather grandiose sound makes this one of the singles that guitarist George Young describes as “three minute operas.” ‘Falling Off The Edge Of The World’ ‘receives moderate airplay in the U.S.’ but does not chart in that country. The song is co-produced by The Easybeats and their manager, Mike Vaughan.\n\nFrom mid-1967 through the rest of that year, The Easybeats work with producer Glyn Johns at Olympic Recording Studios in the U.K. on what is intended to be the group’s second album for United Artists. It is given the provisional title of ‘Good Times’. Following the release of The Beatles’ ‘Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ (1967) new standards are set for pop music. The Easybeats are not the only other group of the time struggling to adapt to the new era of psychedelic music, flower power and hippies, but it is an uphill battle. Harry Vanda and George Young are ‘composing ever more complex songs’ in an attempt to emulate The Beatles. The project collapses under its own weight. Adding to the problem, legal issues with Albert Productions back in Australia are causing headaches. United Artists finally decides to just permanently shelve the album. Some of the songs from this period surface subsequently as singles and album tracks in the 1960s; the rest of the material shows up a decade later on ‘The Shame Just Drained’ (1977).\n\nOther forces are also creating problems for The Easybeats. Psychedelic music, by definition, attempts to sonically simulate the effects of ingesting consciousness-expanding drugs. Vocalist Stevie Wright, displaced from his role as co-songwriter and disaffected as a consequence, is particularly susceptible to the lure of drugs. He indulges in marijuana and acid (LSD) while in England. Wright’s girlfriend Gail Baxter believes that only Stevie was into drugs and the rest of the band wasn’t. However, others claim ‘the members begin indulging in the chemical and other diversions at hand in still swinging London.’ Certainly within a couple of years, drummer Tony Cahill is nursing a heroin addiction.\n\nBetween the demands of trying to reproduce their new psychedelic sounds on stage and the possible drug problems within the group, The Easybeats is ‘no longer as exciting a group to listen to or see, when they actually do perform.’\n\nThe Australian EP ‘Pretty Girl’, issued in November 1967, gathers together the previously released songs ‘Heaven And Hell’, ‘Women’, ‘Come And See Her’ and ‘Pretty Girl’.\n\nThe Easybeats single ‘The Music Goes ‘Round My Head’ (AUS no. 33) is released in December 1967. This is a pleasant piece of whimsy with a horn section augmenting the fable of a musician whose songs lead him to be credited as a “genius beyond compare.” Supposedly, ‘The Music Goes ‘Round My Head’ is ‘inspired by blue beat’ and is a foray into ‘rocksteady/ska’ music, but it’s hard to hear anything like that in the busy, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink arrangement at work here. Once again, production credit is shared by The Easybeats and Mike Vaughan.\n\nThe Australian EP ‘Easy Fever Volume 2’ is released in January 1968. The four songs on this disc are ‘Happy Is The Man’, ‘You Me, We Love’, ‘Saturday Night’ and ‘All Gone Boy’.\n\nThe next offering from The Easybeats is the single ‘Hello, How Are You’ (AUS no. 34, UK no. 20), released in March 1968. This slow-paced song is soaked in violins and cellos. ‘Hello, How Are You’ tries to change the musical direction of The Easybeats towards soft pop/adult contemporary. With the benefit of hindsight, guitarist and co-author George Young comments, “The people in the industry dug it and it skidded in and out of the [U.K.] top twenty [singles]. But it was a classic mistake from our point of view. We were a rock ‘n’ roll band and what was a rock band doing with this cornball schmaltz sh*t? We shouldn’t have done that.” The flipside is the ‘even grander’ ‘Come In, You’ll Get Pneumonia’. In this song the narrator welcomes in from the rain a girl who left him at the [railway] station. It starts with just voice and organ but then builds, only to ebb in the middle. It is an odd arrangement with peculiar instrumentation. Saxophone on this track is by George Young’s elder brother, Alexander, and backing vocals are supplied by Olivia Newton-John and Pat Carroll.\n\nIn April 1968, Los Bravos (1965-1968) – a Spanish beat group – releases the single ‘Bring A Little Lovin’’ (US no. 51). This song is written by Harry Vanda and George Young of The Easybeats.\n\nThe Easybeats’ album ‘Vigil’ (1968) is released on 18 June in the U.K. but is not issued in Australia until October 1968. This album is co-produced by The Easybeats and their manager, Mike Vaughan. In the U.K., ‘Vigil’ is released by United Artists but the Australian edition comes out on the Parlophone label. The album is titled ‘Vigil’ ‘as a tribute to fans who held vigil for the album’s long [awaited] release’ following the shelving of The Easybeats’ aborted second album for United Artists. ‘Vigil’ includes the earlier singles ‘Falling Off The Edge Of The World’, ‘The Music Goes ‘Round My Head’, ‘Hello, How Are You’ and its B side ‘Come in, You’ll Get Pneumonia’. Also present (on the Australian edition) is The Easybeats’ own version of ‘Bring A Little Lovin’’, the Harry Vanda and George Young song recorded by Los Bravos. ‘Land Of Make Believe’ (AUS no. 18) takes a candy-coloured approach to heartbreak. This ‘psychedelic gem’ is salvaged from the shelved second album The Easybeats made for United Artists. This is also true of what would have been that album’s title track, ‘Good Times’ (AUS no. 22). This track goes back to what The Easybeats do best. It is a kinetic blast with Stevie Wright sharing vocals with a gut-bucket performance from Steve Marriott (of British group The Small Faces). The chorus explodes, “Gonna have a good time tonight / Rock ‘n’ roll music gonna play all night / Come on, baby, it won’t take long / Only take a minute just to sing my song.” ‘Good Times’ has been described as ‘one of the greatest rock singles recorded.’ ‘Lay Me Down And Die’ (AUS no. 59) is a bit of an oddity: an instrumental with pretty semi-classical piano laid over a standard rock/pop backing. Apparently a vocal version was also recorded. The U.K. edition of ‘Vigil’ includes three cover versions: Frankie Valli’s 1967 song ‘Can’t Take My Eyes Off You’, Ray Charles’ 1961 song ‘Hit The Road, Jack’ and ‘I Can’t Stand It’, a 1962 piece first recorded by rhythm and blues saxophonist Paul Williams. These covers are excised from the Australian version. Despite some good tracks, ‘Vigil’ is ‘not a commercially or critically successful album’ and does not chart in either the U.K. or Australia.\n\nOn 7 July 1968 The Easybeats play the ‘Sounds ‘68’ concert at London’s Royal Albert Hall. The headliners are British band The Move and visiting U.S. act The Byrds (with Gram Parsons in their line-up). Aside from The Easybeats, U.K. singer Joe Cocker is also one of the supporting acts.\n\nIn August 1968 Australian group The Valentines (with Bon Scott on vocals) release the single ‘Peculiar Hole In The Sky’. This track is written by Harry Vanda and George Young of The Easybeats.\n\n‘Falling Off The Edge Of The World’ (1968), released in October, is the U.S. version of The Easybeats’ album ‘Vigil’. This set reduces the number of tracks from the U.K. version of the album so it has only twelve cuts rather than fourteen. The two tunes that are axed are ‘Sha La La’ and ‘We All Live Happily Together’, both of which are originals written by Easybeats guitarists Harry Vanda and George Young. ‘Falling Off The Edge Of The World’ is no more successful in commercial terms in the U.S. than its U.K. or Australian counterparts.\n\n‘Through late 1968 the formerly tight-knit Easybeats begin to drift apart – drugs are a factor, but the growing independence of the Vanda and Young team as a creative unit is also a major catalyst.’ Guitarists Harry Vanda and George Young are reluctant to do more than a few gigs each month; they are busy with their song-writing.\n\nBy 1969 it is announced that The Easybeats have parted ways with the United Artists record label. The group’s next recordings will be released by Polydor. The group’s ties with Albert Productions are also severed.\n\nOn 27 June 1969 The Easybeats issue a new single, ‘St Louis’ (AUS no. 21, US no. 100) b/w ‘Can’t Find Love’. These songs were recorded in April 1969 at Olympic Studios in London with Ray Singer as producer. A solitary horn sounds an introduction, the bass pounds and Stevie Wright sings, “Countrymen, friends, lend me your ears / I’ll tell you a tale of fifteen years / I’m an old man who’s all forlorn / I want to see the city where I was a-born / I got a feelin’ that I can’t stand / I wanna go home to my homeland / Ain’t got no money / I ain’t got a cent / I can’t get on that train / So help me.” ‘St Louis’ is an interesting example of Australia’s cultural cringe. Rather than sing about an Australian place like St Kilda or St Albans, The Easybeats seek an international legitimacy by singing about an American city, St Louis. While it’s true that only drummer Tony Cahill is Australian-born, none of the group is from America. ‘St Louis’ is still a strong affirmation of The Easybeats’ rock instincts, even if it only ‘manages to scrape the very bottom of the American’ charts. ‘Can’t Find Love’, the B side of ‘St Louis’, is another credible and powerful rock song.\n\nIn July 1969 ‘it is announced that the working relationship between manager Mike Vaughan and The Easybeats has come to an end.’\n\nEasybeats songwriters Harry Vanda and George Young set up their own recording studio in Moscow Road, London. They supply songs to other artists. For example, in 1969 Australian singer Mike Furber records their song ‘I’m On Fire’.\n\n‘The Best Of The Easybeats Volume 2’ (1969) is released by Parlophone on 9 August. This consists of ‘several lo-fi demo recordings’ intended for other artists. This material is released against the group’s wishes.\n\nIn September 1969 The Easybeats undertake a short European concert tour.\n\nOn 25 September 1969 The Easybeats’ recording of ‘Peculiar Hole In The Sky’ (AUS no. 53) is released as a single. It may be recalled that the authors of this song, Easybeats guitarists Harry Vanda and George Young, had given this song to Australian group The Valentines in August 1968. This big and brassy psychedelic song finds the narrator watching the whole world through a ‘peculiar hole in the sky.’ This track is lifted from ‘The Best Of The Easybeats Volume 2’.\n\nThe Easybeats go on a five week tour of Australia. This is viewed as ‘a last-ditch attempt to bail the group out of its mounting debts.’ Even before the tour commences, it is rumoured that The Easybeats will split up after this series of shows is completed.\n\nChanges are also on the horizon in romantic terms for three members of The Easybeats. A week before the group leaves England, vocalist Stevie Wright becomes engaged to Gail Baxter, his girlfriend of four years. Guitarist Harry Vanda, who has been a widower since his wife Pam committed suicide in 1966, has found a new love. She is a 21 year old blonde girl named Robyn Thomas; she is from Bentleigh, Victoria. Their engagement is announced, but then denied. In any case, the relationship certainly seems serious. Bassist Dick Diamonde is planning to marry soon.\n\nThe Easybeats’ five week tour of Australia takes in shows in all the State capital cities as well as other locations. The band plays in smaller clubs and dance halls rather than the larger venues featured in The Easybeats’ 1967 tour of Australia. The 1969 tour is ‘less than successful’; The Easybeats are ‘worn out [and] disillusioned.’ Arguably, the no frills hard rock the group is playing now is out of step with the current music scene that splits its focus between progressive rock, soul and bubblegum.\n\nThe Easybeats record a television special for ATN 7 in Sydney in October 1969 but this will not be broadcast until 2 November 1969, after their Australian tour concludes.\n\nDirectly after The Easybeats finish their gig at Caesar’s Palace Disco in Sydney on 25 October 1969, bassist Dick Diamonde marries actress Charlene Collins.\n\nThe next day, 26 October 1969, The Easybeats are in Orange, New South Wales. They put in an appearance at the CBN-TV studios. The Easybeats show at the Amoco Centre that evening is ‘interrupted by hostile audience members’ and is cancelled after twenty minutes. This is the last Easybeats show.\n\nThe Australian tour concluded, The Easybeats go their separate ways. “Oh, I didn’t split [from the group],” vocalist Stevie Wright later says. “The Easybeats just broke up, just for lots and lots of reasons…”\n\n‘Friends’ (1970), released in February, is the final Easybeats album. It is their only album on the Polydor label. Production credit for this album is divided between Ray Singer and the two Easybeats guitarists, Harry Vanda and George Young. Singer produces ‘St Louis’ and ‘Can’t Find Love’, the previously released songs that are both included here. The rest of ‘Friends’ consists of demo recordings Vanda and Young made for other acts. Sometimes members of The Easybeats play on these demos, sometimes not. It seems to have been decided simply on the basis of who was around at the time. Even vocalist Stevie Wright is absent from many of the tracks with either Harry Vanda or George Young providing the vocals. All the songs on this disc are penned by Vanda and Young even if they are credited to the pseudonym of Brian Russell. ‘I Love Marie’ (AUS no. 93) from this album is issued as a single. It is almost a middle-of-the-road song. A skeletal piece of guitar work underpins the song, but it opens into big chords on the changes and sounds bell-like. With a deep voice and an atmospheric arrangement, ‘I Love Marie’ seems an odd choice to put out as the capstone to The Easybeats’ career. However, with the band dissolved, perhaps no one was overly concerned anyway. ‘Friends’ makes no impact on the charts.\n\nAs a postscript, the United Artists album ‘Friday On My Mind’ (1970) – created for the U.S. market – is released in Australia in October. It doesn’t chart either. The album had been issued in the U.S. in May 1967. Incongruously, the album’s cover image includes the band’s latter-day drummer Tony Cahill when the songs on this set were recorded back when original drummer Snowy Fleet was still in The Easybeats.\n\nNow that The Easybeats are seemingly consigned to history, what happens to the individual members of the band in subsequent years?\n\nFormer Easybeats vocalist Stevie Wright is still only 21 years old when The Easybeats split up in October 1969. He returns to Sydney in 1969 and forms a backing band called Rachette (1970-1971). Stevie Wright sets up his own record label, Musical Expression. In 1970 he produces a single called ‘Whole World Should Slow Down’ for a local band called Bootleg. This single is released on the Musical Expression label.\n\nBetween gigs, Stevie Wright is employed as a process worker; he is one of the sales staff at a chic clothing boutique called John & Merivale in Pitt Street, Sydney; and does ‘a few menial jobs.’ “The effect was devastating going from the stardom of The Easybeats to sweeping floors, but I had to survive,” says Wright.\n\nLate in 1971 Stevie Wright moves to Perth, Western Australia. He joins a group called Likefun. Other members of this act include Ray Hoff (vocals), Morri Pierson (vocals), Shirley Reid (vocals), Alan Wilkes (organ) and John Tucak (bass). However by mid-1972 Stevie Wright is back in Sydney.\n\nIn 1972 Stevie Wright sings for Black Tank. The rest of this group is Rory O’Donoghue (vocals, guitar), Ken Firth (bass) and Greg Hanson (drums).\n\nStevie Wright’s fortunes change when he is recruited in 1972 for the Australian cast of the rock stage musical ‘Jesus Christ, Superstar’. Wright plays Simon Zealotes, one of Christ’s apostles. This new employment goes on to change Stevie Wright’s life in a couple of ways.\n\nStevie Wright’s fiancée Gail Baxter is six months pregnant when the singer joins the cast of ‘Jesus Christ, Superstar’. With the promise of a more settled life and income, Stevie and Gail marry (in 1972?). Their son, Nicholas (‘Nick’) is born in 1973.\n\nWhile appearing in ‘Jesus Christ, Superstar’, Stevie Wright is introduced to heroin. “I was 26 when I started [on heroin],” Wright acknowledges. This means it is 1973 when he begins taking this illicit substance.\n\nStevie Wright’s wife Gail claims their marriage was over just after the birth of their son, Nick. Wright is ‘consumed by drugs.’ Gail leaves him after two years (circa 1975) because it is not a safe environment for their child with syringes lying around the house due to Stevie’s drug use.\n\nStevie Wright leaves the ‘Jesus Christ, Superstar’ production late in 1973. Ironically, he gets a job at the warehouse for Albert Productions, The Easybeats former sponsors. This, in turn, leads to a reunion with fellow former Easybeats Harry Vanda and George Young. They are now working as producers and songwriters at Alberts (more on this in the section later that deals with Vanda and Young). Stevie Wright signs as a solo act with Alberts late in 1973.\n\nFor live performances, Stevie Wright forms a band called The All-Stars. The line-up includes Tim Gaze (guitar), Warren Morgan (piano) and Johnny Dick (drums).\n\nStevie Wright’s first solo album, ‘Hard Road’ (1974) (AUS no. 2), is released in May. This album is produced and written by Harry Vanda and George Young. ‘Hard Road’ includes the very successful single ‘Evie’ (AUS no. 1), named after George Young’s daughter (more on that under the section about Vanda and Young). ‘Evie’ is unusual not only because of its popularity, but because it is eleven minutes long and is divided into three sections (the hard rock ‘Let Your Hair Hang Down’, the ballad ‘Evie’ and the almost disco-rock ‘I’m Losing You’). In practice, many radio stations just play the hard rock first section. “My career was going up at the same rate as my [heroin] addiction,” Wright later ruefully acknowledges. “One blew out the other in the end.”\n\nIn June 1974 Stevie Wright performs at the Sydney Opera House in front of a crowd of two thousand, five hundred people. Reportedly, ten thousand more fans were turned away. On this occasion, Wright’s backing band includes three famous guitarists: former Easybeats Harry Vanda and George Young as well as George’s junior sibling, Malcolm. This is the first post-Easybeats performance by Wright, Vanda and Young together.\n\nAround 1974 Stevie Wright receives an offer to take over as frontman of British rock group Mott The Hoople, but he turns it down.\n\nStevie Wright’s second solo album, ‘Black Eyed Bruiser’ (1975) (AUS no. 61), is released in August. Once again this album is produced and written by Harry Vanda and George Young. ‘Black Eyed Bruiser’ spawns the singles ‘Guitar Band’ (AUS no. 13), ‘You’ (AUS no. 88) and ‘Black Eyed Bruiser’ (AUS no. 99). Wright is unable to promote this album because he checks into a drug rehabilitation clinic to deal with his heroin addiction. This is only the first of a number of attempts by the singer to ‘get clean.’\n\nBy mid-1975 Stevie Wright’s backing band, The All-Stars, start working instead with Australian singer John Paul Young (no relation to George Young). Undeterred, the former Easybeats frontman puts together The Stevie Wright Band. This unit consists of Stevie Wright (vocals), Russell Johnson (guitar), Peter White (keyboards), Billy Rylands (bass), Tony Bolton (drums) and Larry Duryea (percussion).\n\nIn mid-1976 Stevie Wright plays a few gigs around Sydney with a band called Sacha. However, ‘for the rest of the decade [he] disappears from view as he plunges ever deeper into the grip of drugs and alcohol addiction.’\n\nIn August 1976 Stevie Wright is hospitalised after a drug overdose. He receives methadone treatment for withdrawal symptoms and undergoes rehabilitation at the William Booth Institute in Sydney. After this, Stevie Wright admits himself to Chelmsford Private Hospital. At this facility, his health is placed in the hands of psychiatrist Dr Harry Bailey. The controversial process administered by Bailey is called Deep Sleep Therapy. The patient is placed in a drug-induced coma and Electro Convulsive Therapy is applied. Wright has fourteen electric shock treatments. ‘Many patients, including Wright, suffer brain damage and lifelong after effects.’ Stevie Wright is discharged as ‘cured,’ but is soon using heroin again. “I’m self-destructive if left to my own devices,” the singer admits. ‘The scandal [involving Dr Bailey’s treatments] is later exposed.’ Faced with humiliation, Bailey commits suicide on 8 September 1985 at the age of 62.\n\nStevie Wright turns to charitable organisation the Salvation Army for help. He works as a farmhand at one of their rural properties. Wright improves sufficiently to become the boss of a piggery run by the Salvation Army. He also does some counselling with other drug-affected youths who approach ‘the Salvos’ for assistance.\n\nAs the 1970s draw to a close, Sydney radio station 2SM sponsors the ‘Concert of the Decade.’ This show takes place on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 4 November 1979. Australasian acts such as Sherbet, Dragon, Skyhooks and Split Enz perform at this event. However the culmination of the show is Stevie Wright’s performance of ‘Evie’.\n\nStevie Wright contributes to ‘Headlines’ (1982), an album by Flash And The Pan, released in August. Flash And The Pan is a pseudonym for former Easybeats Harry Vanda and George Young. (Further information on Flash And The Pan is in the section below on Vanda and Young.) Stevie Wright supplies backing vocals in general and lead vocals on two specific tracks, ‘Where Were You’ and ‘Waiting For A Train’ (AUS no. 93, UK no. 7). There is talk of a new Stevie Wright solo album supervised by Vanda and Young for 1983, but these plans are never realised. Wright forms The Street Beat Band in 1983, but nothing comes from this move.\n\nIt seems that Stevie Wright succumbs again to his drug addiction problems. Wright checks himself into the Westmount Rehabilitation Centre. In January 1984 Stevie Wright is charged with house-breaking, a crime apparently brought on by the need for money to pay for drugs. He is arrested for heroin use later the same month.\n\nFormer Easybeats guitarists Harry Vanda and George Young continue to work together after The Easybeats part ways in 1969. The duo works together as a songwriting and record production team. They are left to work off an eighty-five thousand dollar debt still owed by The Easybeats.\n\nBefore starting to chronicle the creative works of Vanda and Young, let’s note a couple of more personal events that occur early in the post-Easybeats era of their partnership.\n\nGeorge Young marries a woman named Sandra (in 1971?). George is said to have been married to Sandra ‘all his adult life.’ He was still single at the time of The Easybeats’ 1969 Australian tour, so this suggests the wedding must take place in the early 1970s. George and Sandra have a daughter named Yvette (‘Evie’) (born in 1972?). This little girl’s name is the inspiration for Stevie Wright’s 1974 hit ‘Evie’, so she must have been born before 1974.\n\nHarry Vanda remarries in the ‘early 1970s.’ His second wife is Robyn Thomas (born in 1948). Harry and Robyn have two sons together, Daniel and Simon.\n\nVanda and Young began placing songs with other recording artists while The Easybeats were still an active group. George Young and his original songwriting partner, Easybeats vocalist Stevie Wright, wrote ‘Step Back’ (AUS no. 1), a song released by Australian pop singer Johnny Young in May 1966. Harry Vanda replaced Wright as Young’s songwriting partner with The Easybeats’ ‘Friday On My Mind’ (released in the U.K. first on 14 October 1966). Spanish group Los Bravos put out the Vanda and Young song ‘Bring A Little Lovin’’ (US no. 51) in April 1968. Australian group The Valentines released the Vanda and Young song ‘Peculiar Hole In The Sky’ in August 1968. In 1969 Australian singer Mike Furber issued ‘I’m On Fire’, a song written for him by Vanda and Young.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973 Vanda and Young remain based in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1970 Vanda and Young issue a handful of singles, mostly on their own Youngblood Records, under a variety of pseudonyms. The first of these is ‘Children’, which is credited to Eddie Avana. Actually, the lead vocal is by Harry Vanda. Vanda and Young share songwriting credit for ‘Children’ with David Hemmings. George Young’s elder brother Alexander (a.k.a. George Alexander) also plays on the rest of the 1970 singles Vanda and Young issue under aliases. These songs are: ‘Get Ready For Love’ by Paintbox (June 1970); ‘Lazy River’ by Moondance (June 1970); and ‘Vietnam Rose’ by Tramp (July 1970). The Moondance single is issued on the A & M label.\n\nHarry Vanda and George Young are the authors of ‘Falling In Love Again’ (AUS no. 7), the February 1971 single by U.K. born Australian singer Ted Mulry. Vanda and Young are not involved with Mulry’s album of the same name nor his mid to late 1970s successful pop career with his own band, The Ted Mulry Gang.\n\nAlthough Grapefruit (the U.K. pop group that included George Alexander/Alexander Young) split up in 1969, that name is resurrected for the 1971 Vanda and Young single ‘Sha-Sha’ on the Deram label. Also on the Deram label is the 1971 single ‘Shot In The Head’ by Haff’s Whiskey Sour (another Vanda and Young pseudonym). Australian group Flake (1968-1974) release ‘Life Is Getting Better’ (AUS no. 48) in June 1971. This song is written by Vanda and Young.\n\nIn January 1972 ‘Pasadena’ (AUS no. 16) is released in Australia by John Young. This is no relation of George Young. John Young is an Australian who will become better known in a few years as John Paul Young. ‘Pasadena’ is co-written by Harry Vanda, George Young and David Hemmings. Vanda and Young will also be crucial to the later success of John Paul Young.\n\nThe unreleased 1972 single ‘Working Class People’ by Band Of Hope is close to being the last of Vanda and Young’s pseudonymous releases.\n\nThe Marcus Hook Roll Band (1972-1974) is less like a Vanda and Young pseudonym and more like a band. The members of The Marcus Hook Roll Band are: George Young (vocals, guitar, piano, bass), Harry Vanda (lead guitar, vocals), Alexander Young (saxophone), Malcolm Young (guitar), Angus Young (guitar), Howard Casey (saxophone), Ian Campbell (bass), Freddie Smith (drums) and John Proud (drums). The main reason for the existence of The Marcus Hook Roll Band is to give George Young’s younger brothers Malcolm and Angus a taste of being in a recording band. George’s elder brother, Alexander Young, and drummer Freddie Smith played on all or most of Vanda and Young’s pseudonymous works from 1970 to 1972. The Marcus Hook Roll Band releases only one album, ‘Tales Of Old Grand Daddy’ (1973). The group also releases three singles in 1973, none of which are on their album: ‘Natural Man’, ‘Louisiana Lady’ and ‘Can’t Stand The Heat’.\n\nIn 1973 Harry Vanda and George Young return to live in Australia. They reunite with Ted Albert, the former producer of The Easybeats. He employs Vanda and Young as songwriters and producers for Albert Productions.\n\nVanda and Young write and produce two albums for former Easybeats vocalist Stevie Wright: ‘Hard Road’ (May 1974) (AUS no. 2) and ‘Black Eyed Bruiser’ (August 1975) (AUS no. 61). ‘Hard Road’ includes the hit ‘Evie’ (AUS no. 1), named after George Young’s daughter. ‘Black Eyed Bruiser’ spawns the singles ‘Guitar Band’ (AUS no. 13), ‘You’ (AUS no. 88) and ‘Black Eyed Bruiser’ (AUS no. 99).\n\nVanda and Young act as producers for Australian hard rock band AC/DC. This act features former Valentines vocalist Bon Scott as well as George Young’s younger brothers Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar) and Angus Young (lead guitar). Bon, Malcolm and Angus co-write AC/DC’s songs. Vanda and Young produce the 1974 AC/DC single ‘Can I Sit Next To You, Girl’ (AUS no. 50) and the following AC/DC albums: ‘High Voltage’ (17 February 1975) (AUS no. 14), ‘T.N.T.’ (1 December 1975) (AUS no. 2), ‘Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap’ (20 September 1976) (AUS no. 5, US no. 3), ‘Let There Be Rock’ (21 March 1977) (AUS no. 19, UK no. 17, US no. 154), ‘Powerage’ (5 May 1978) (AUS no. 22, UK no. 23, US no. 133) and the live album ‘If You Want Blood You’ve Got It’ (21 November 1978) (AUS no. 37, UK no. 13, US no. 113). After a few albums away from the duo (and the death of Bon Scott), AC/DC again employ Vanda and Young as producers for ‘Who Made Who’ (24 May 1986) (AUS no. 9, UK no. 16).\n\nVanda and Young write and produce a pair of hit singles for the Australian glam-pop singer who goes by the name of William Shakespeare. The singles are ‘Can’t Stop Myself From Loving You’ (early 1974) (AUS no. 2) and ‘My Little Angel’ (December 1974) (AUS no. 1). Both of these songs are on the album ‘Can’t Stop Myself From Loving You’ (November 1974) (AUS ‘top 30’).\n\nVanda and Young have a long association with Australian pop singer John Paul Young. They co-wrote his January 1972 hit ‘Pasadena’ (AUS no. 16) with David Hemmings, a song credited to ‘John Young’. Vanda and Young act as both songwriters and producers for John Paul Young. By 1977 they add disco elements to the familiar pop sounds of this singer. John Paul Young also inherits the All-Stars in 1975, the backing band of former Easybeats singer Stevie Wright. The singles ‘Yesterday’s Hero’ (10 February 1975) (AUS no. 8) and ‘The Love Game’ (September 1975) (AUS no. 4) come from the album ‘Hero’ (October 1975) (AUS no. 9). The singles ‘I Hate The Music’ (March 1976) (AUS no. 2), ‘Keep On Smilin’’ (August 1978) (AUS no. 15) and ‘Standing In The Rain’ (February 1977) (AUS no. 12) all come from the album ‘J.P.Y.’ (August 1976) (AUS no. 3) which is mostly written by Vanda and Young. The singles ‘I Wanna Do It With You’ (February 1977) (AUS no. 7) and ‘Here We Go’ (May 1977) (AUS no. 43) – the latter only produced (not written) by Vanda and Young – come from the album ‘Green’ (2 May 1977) (AUS no. 19). About half of the tracks on ‘Green’ are written by Vanda and Young. ‘Where The Action Is’ (October 1977) (AUS no. 33) is a new single added to the compilation album ‘All The Best’ (November 1977) (AUS no. 40), a set mostly made up of Vanda and Young compositions. The singles ‘Love Is In The Air’ (April 1978) (AUS no. 3, UK no. 5, US no. 7), ‘The Day My Heart Caught Fire’ (August 1978) (AUS no. 20) and ‘Fool In Love’ (November 1978) (AUS no. 58) all come from the mostly Vanda and Young composed album ‘Love Is In The Air’ (30 October 1978) (AUS no. 32). Vanda and Young also write and produce John Paul Young’s album ‘Heaven Sent’ (November 1979) (AUS no. 95) and the title track, ‘Heaven Sent’ (AUS no. 53).\n\nVanda and Young play more central roles in their next project, Flash And The Pan (1976-1993). The name Flash And The Pan is a pun on the expression ‘a flash in the pan’ which is used to denote something with a short life. Given their lengthy careers, this is of course used ironically by Vanda and Young. Flash (Harry Vanda) And The Pan (George Young) use backing musicians such as Warren Morgan (piano), Les Karski (bass) and Ray Arnott (drums). George Young sort of speaks/sings the lead vocals for their – largely – tongue-in-cheek songs. Their first single is 1976’s ‘Hey St Peter’ (AUS no. 5, US no. 76). This is followed in 1978 by the singles ‘Down Among The Dead Men’ (AUS no. 4, UK no. 54) and ‘The African Shuffle’ (AUS no. 85) as well as the debut album ‘Flash And The Pan’ (December 1978) (AUS ‘top 100’, US no. 80). Their second album is ‘Lights In The Night’ (early 1980) (AUS ‘top 100’). The third Flash And The Pan album, ‘Headlines’ (August 1982), features former Easybeats vocalist Stevie Wright on two tracks ‘Where Were You’ and ‘Waiting For A Train’. Also contributing to this album is: Ian Miller (guitar), Ralph White (brass, keyboards), Alan Dansow (bass?), Ray Arnott (drums) and Lyndsay Hammond (backing vocals). The December 1982 single ‘Waiting For A Train’ (AUS no. 98, UK no. 7) does a bit better in Australia in 1983 when the ‘French take’ of ‘Waiting For A Train’ (AUS no. 66) is issued. The compilation album ‘Panorama’ (July 1983) (UK no. 69) is followed by two singles, ‘Early Morning Wake Up Call’ (late 1984) and the 1985 single ‘Midnight Man’ (AUS no. 66).\n\nThe next two bands Vanda and Young produce are spiritually closer to the duo’s work with AC/DC.\n\nThe Angels is an Australian hard rock band that mixes some new wave paranoia into their sound. Vanda and Young produce the first two singles by The Angels, ‘Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again’ (1 March 1976) (AUS no. 58) and ‘You’re A Lady Now’ (July 1977) (AUS no. 90), which are both on the Vanda and Young produced album ‘The Angels’ (August 1977). Like AC/DC, The Angles write their own songs; Vanda and Young act only as producers. The Angels actually become more successful after parting ways with Vanda and Young.\n\nRose Tattoo is an Australian hard rock band that is, if anything, even more intimidating than AC/DC. Like both AC/DC and The Angels, Rose Tattoo write their own material. Vanda and Young produce the following Rose Tattoo albums: ‘Rose Tattoo’ (November 1978), ‘Assault And Battery’ (1 January 1981) (AUS ‘top 30’), ‘Scarred For Life’ (1 June 1982) and ‘Southern Stars’ (10 October 1984).\n\nCheetah is an Australian vocal duo consisting of sisters Chrissie Hammond and Lyndsay Hammond. They start out as a pop act, but Vanda and Young are brought in to give Cheetah a bit more rock ‘n’ roll credibility. Vanda and Young write and produce Cheetah’s singles ‘Spend The Night’ (September 1980) (AUS no. 31) and ‘Bang Bang’ (August 1981) (AUS no. 80) which come from the album ‘Rock & Roll Women’ (April 1982).\n\nWhen The Easybeats disband in 1969, guitarist George Young says of the band’s bassist, Dick Diamonde, he was “having a ball just being Dick.” Diamonde subsequently ‘plays with a series of small-time bands on the north-east coast’ of Australia. He then retires to the north coast of New South Wales.\n\nAfter leaving The Easybeats in 1967, drummer Gordon ‘Snowy’ Fleet takes over his family’s construction business in Perth, Western Australia, and becomes quite successful in that field of endeavour.\n\nFrom the time of Snowy Fleet’s departure in 1967 until the group dissolved in 1969, Tony Cahill was drummer in The Easybeats. When the band splits up Cahill is ‘broke and hooked on heroin.’ He is unable to even lift a drumstick and in fact never plays drums again.\n\nTony Cahill gets himself together again sufficiently to resume his music career. However he switches instruments from drums to bass. As a bass player, Tony Cahill joins Python Lee Jackson in 1972. Python Lee Jackson starts out as an Australian rock band (1968-1968) before relocating to the U.K. in October 1968 for the second phase of their career (1968-1969). Like the Easybeats, Python Lee Jackson splits up in 1969. However in 1969 Python Lee Jackson had recorded a track called ‘In A Broken Dream’ with lead vocals provided by a session singer named Rod Stewart. The song is released in October 1970 without making any mark on the charts. Rod Stewart is not exactly unknown at the time, but it is fair to say that he is not yet as famous as he will soon become. Rod Stewart has been knocking around the British music scene for some time. He lent his vocals to The Dimensions (October 1963-December 1963), The Hoochie Coochie Men (January 1964-1965), The Soul Agents (1965), Steampacket (mid-1965-summer 1966), Shotgun Express (February 1967-July 1967), The Jeff Beck Group (1968-1969) and The Faces (1969-February 1975). Rod Stewart recorded his first solo single in October 1964 and continued to record as a solo act between (and during) his stints with the aforementioned groups. His breakthrough is the solo single ‘Maggie May’ (UK no. 1, US no. 1) in 1971. After that watershed, the Python Lee Jackson single ‘In A Broken Dream’ (UK no. 3, US no. 56) is rereleased in 1972 and this time, thanks to Stewart’s enhanced profile, is much more successful. In order to capitalise upon this, a new version of Python Lee Jackson is assembled in 1972 – with former Easybeats drummer Tony Cahill now on bass. Python Lee Jackson release only one album in their complete career (1965-1972), ‘In A Broken Dream’ (1972). This disc includes three tracks recorded with Rod Stewart back in 1969. Tony Cahill doesn’t play on those three songs, but is present for the rest of the album. Chris Belsman replaces Tony Cahill as bassist in Python Lee Jackson later in 1972 before the group disbands soon after for good.\n\nAfter Python Lee Jackson, Tony Cahill joins with Gerry Humphries (formerly with Australian band The Loved Ones) for Gerry And The Joy Band.\n\nKing Harvest (1970-1976) is a band of U.S. expatriates living in France. The group has ‘a constantly fluctuating membership.’ Tony Cahill plays bass in King Harvest for a while but is not one of the core members of the band. King Harvest is best known for the 1973 hit ‘Dancing In The Moonlight’ (US no. 13).\n\nTony Cahill goes on to become a session musician in Los Angeles. He marries singer-songwriter Sharon Robinson.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1986 the musical legacy of The Easybeats is kept alive through a series of compilations, reissues and exhumed previously unreleased material. Parlophone releases ‘The Shame Just Drained’ (1977) on 10 October. This brings together some outtakes, demo recordings, rarities and the scrapped contents of The Easybeats’ aborted second album for United Artists, ‘Good Times’. Aside from ‘Good Times’ and ‘Land Of Make Believe’ which were salvaged and released back in the 1960s, the rest of the album is here. Raven Records issues the EP ‘Mean Old Lovin’’ by The Easybeats in November 1979. The contents of this EP are: ‘Mean Old Lovin’’, ‘I’m Happy’, ‘Hey Babe’, ‘I Don’t Agree’, ‘Keep Your Hands Off My Babe’ and ‘No One Knows’. All of these songs are written by Harry Vanda and George Young. ‘Mean Old Lovin’’ is limited to a printing of only one thousand copies. ‘Absolute Anthology 1965 to 1969’ (1980) (AUS no. 35) is released by EMI on 17 November. This is a two disc compilation album with forty-two songs. Also in 1980 ‘Friday On My Mind’ (AUS no. 92), ‘She’s So Fine’ and ‘Wedding Ring’ are all rereleased on one single that makes a modest showing on the charts. Raven also joins in the revival with the 1980 EP ‘Son Of Easyfever’. The five tracks on this EP of previously unissued material are ‘Find My Way Back Home’, ‘Coke Jingle’, ‘Mandy’, ‘I’m Just Trying’ and ‘Look Out, I’m On The Way Down’. ‘Find My Way Back Home’ and ‘Mandy’ are produced by Ted Albert, the ‘Coke Jingle’ is produced by Pat Aulton and the other two tracks are produced by the team of Harry Vanda and George Young. [No songwriting credits are available.] The budget label Hammard Records puts together the compilation ‘The Easybeats’ (1981) (AUS no. 76) in September. The 1982 Raven EP ‘Son Of Son Of Easyfever’ consists of ‘All Gone Boy’, ‘Hound Dog’, ‘Interview/Coke Ads’, ‘Watch Me Burn’, ‘Where Did You Go Last Night’ and ‘Little Red Bucket’. [Aside from the cover version ‘Hound Dog’, no songwriting credits are available.] ‘The Raven EP LP’ (1982) puts the label’s three Easybeats EPs into a single album length disc.\n\nTalk of an Easybeats reunion starts in October 1983. A venue puts forward the proposal. According to former Easybeats vocalist Stevie Wright, “[We] had our lawyers working out the deal…but at the last minute they [i.e. the promoters] tried to change the venue and we just said, ‘Forget it!’”\n\nThe original Easybeats – Stevie Wright, George Young, Harry Vanda, Dick Diamonde and Snowy Fleet – reunite for an Australian tour from September 1986 to November 1986. This tour takes in the capital cities of the various Australian States. This concert tour is the final time The Easybeats will perform together. Albert Productions issues the ‘HistorEasy (Tour ’86)’ EP in October 1986 to coincide with these gigs. The EP contains a medley of ‘Friday On My Mind’, ’She’s So Fine’, ‘Women’ and ‘Sorry’ recorded live at the Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne back in 1966. Also present is another track, ‘Hello, How Are You.’\n\nWhat follows the conclusion of The Easybeats reunion? What becomes of the former members of The Easybeats?\n\nFormer Easybeats vocalist Stevie Wright plays gigs with various incarnations of The Stevie Wright Band from 1986 to 1988. ‘Facing The Music’ (1986) is a ‘best of’ collection of Wright’s music. ‘Hard Rain’ (1988) is credited to The Stevie Wright Band.\n\nAfter a gig at the Merimbula RSL (Returned Servicemen’s League) in New South Wales in the ‘late 1980s,’ Stevie Wright renews his acquaintance with Fay Walker. Stevie and Fay had known each other at Sefton High School. They become friends again. Stevie and Fay are only friends for two years before they move in together. This suggests they become a couple in 1991, but other times it seems they did not become a couple until 1992 or 1994. Even if the date is a bit vague, their affection for each other is not. “Oh, Fay’s my everything,” says Stevie. Fay Walker has a daughter – presumably from an earlier relationship.\n\nStevie Wright’s ‘The Best From Down Under’ (1989) appears to be another compilation album while ‘Striking It Rich’ (1991) has Glenn Goldsmith on guitar. Stevie Wright gives a ‘farewell performance’ at Selina’s in Sydney in 1992.\n\nIn 1993 Stevie Wright finally gives up alcohol for good. He has other health problems. Wright is afflicted with Korsakoff’s psychosis, a form of brain damage that destroys the memory after chronic alcoholism. His partner Fay Walker cares for the bedridden Wright in their home for four years. The singer slips into a coma a few times. One stage of Korsakoff’s psychosis effectively reduces Stevie Wright to a state similar to childhood. Wright undergoes forced rehabilitation at Kenmore Mental Hospital in Goulburn and then spends fourteen months in a nursing home before being released.\n\n‘Sorry – The Wretched Tale of Little Stevie Wright’ (1999) is a biography written by Jack Marx and published by Macmillan. The book receives a mixed response and is ‘dismissed by Wright.’ Stevie Wright finally beats his heroin addiction for good in 2001.\n\n‘Long Way to the Top’ (named after an AC/DC song) is a six-part documentary on Australian rock history screened on the ABC Network from 8 August 2001 to 12 September 2001. Stevie Wright is interviewed for this project. There is an associated ‘Long Way to the Top’ concert tour in 2002 which features many Australian rock greats. Because he had injured his ankle in a fall, Stevie Wright performs in these shows while seated on a stool. The All-Stars act as Stevie Wright’s backing group for these performances. The ‘Long Way to the Top’ concerts are filmed in September 2002 and the resulting film is released in December 2002.\n\n‘Hard Road: The Life and Times of Stevie Wright’ (2004) by Glenn Goldsmith is published by Random House. This is the authorised biography of the former Easybeats frontman. ‘Definitive Collection’ (2004) is another compilation album of Stevie Wright’s recordings.\n\nThe Wrights is a short-lived Australian supergroup. The members of this act (and the groups with which they are more commonly associated) are: Nic Cester (Jet), Bernard Fanning (Powderfinger), Phil Jamieson (Grinspoon), Kram (Spiderbait), Chris Cheney (The Living End), Davey Lane (You Am I, The Pictures) and Pat Bourke (Dallas Crane). The Wrights come together to perform a version of Stevie Wright’s ‘Evie’ on 17 October 2004 at the ARIA (Australian Recording Industry Association) Music Awards of 2004. They perform it again at WaveAid on 29 January 2005 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. This is a benefit concert for the victims of the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. The Wrights’ version of ‘Evie’ (AUS no. 2) (produced by Harry Vanda) is released as a single in February 2005. Profits from sales of the single are divided between Stevie Wright, the Salvation Army drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs and the Red Cross appeal for those affected by the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami.\n\nOn 31 January 2009 Stevie Wright headlines the Legends of Rock Festival in Byron Bay, New South Wales. A new Stevie Wright album is expected in 2009, but this fails to eventuate.\n\nIn 2011, ‘Stevie’, a low-key musical stage show about Stevie Wright, is mounted by Scott McRae. The production is also written by McRae who is an actor, musician and travel presenter for WIN-TV. The show features a five-piece band as well as original footage of Stevie Wright. Scott McRae is based in Wollongong and ‘Stevie’ mainly plays in larger regional New South Wales cities such as Penrith. Stevie Wright himself is known to sometimes show up for these performances which continue until at least 2015.\n\nStevie Wright continues to be plagued by health problems. After a seizure in 2013, Stevie Wright is hospitalised. He is found to have problems with his liver, his kidneys, his lungs and stomach. On top of that, Wright is diagnosed with diabetes, has nodules on his voice box and bleeding in his oesophagus (the passage food travels through to the stomach). Stevie Wright undergoes corrective surgery. His recovery following this is slow and he lives in a Sydney hospice for a while in 2014. Wright has a few falls and hits his head in some of these mishaps. Stevie Wright’s speech is sometimes a bit slurred and indistinct.\n\nStevie Wright and his partner Fay Walker retire to the south coast of New South Wales. He says he hasn’t seen The Easybeats ‘for several years’ but hopes to catch up with them – with the exception of bassist Dick Diamonde with whom Wright apparently does not have a good relationship.\n\nStevie Wright falls ill on Boxing Day, 26 December, 2015 and is admitted to Moruya Hospital in New South Wales. He does not recover and dies as a result of pneumonia on 27 December 2015. Stevie Wright was 68 years old. His funeral is held at St Andrew’s Cathedral in Sydney on 8 January 2016.\n\nAfter The Easybeats reunion, guitarists Harry Vanda and George Young return to their songwriting and record production activities.\n\nTwo more Flash And The Pan albums are made by the duo: ‘Nights In France’ (October 1987) and ‘Burning Up The Night’ (October 1992).\n\nVanda and Young produce another album for AC/DC, ‘Blow Up Your Video’ (18 January 1988) (AUS no. 2, UK no. 2, US no. 12).\n\nVanda and Young are inducted in the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nMark Williams is a singer and songwriter from New Zealand. Vanda and Young write and produce his album ‘ZNZ’ (3 August 1990) (AUS no. 45). This is home to the singles ‘Show No Mercy’ (14 May 1990) (AUS no. 8) and ‘Fix Of Love’ (15 August 1990) (AUS no. 28).\n\nWhen John Paul Young’s 1978 Vanda and Young song ‘Love Is In The Air’ is included in the soundtrack to the movie ‘Strictly Ballroom’ (1992), it revives interest in the song. In 1993, ‘Love Is In The Air’ (AUS no. 3) returns to the Australian singles chart and equals its original chart height. Vanda and Young go on to write and produce a new album for John Paul Young, ‘Now’ (September 1996), though this fails to chart.\n\nVanda and Young are amongst the multiple authors of ‘Runnin’ For The Red Light (I Gotta Life)’ (UK no. 21), a 1995 single by over-sized U.S. singer Meatloaf. Vanda and Young’s last work together is the (non-charting) 1997 single ‘Far Shore’ by Australian 1960s folk-pop act Judith Durham & The Seekers.\n\nGeorge Young produces one more album for AC/DC, ‘Stiff Upper Lip’ (2000) (AUS no. 3, UK no. 12, US no. 7).\n\nGeorge Young retires from the music industry in the late 1990s. He relocates to Portugal with his family. George Young dies on 22 October 2017. He was 70 years old. ‘A cause of death has not been reported.’ In a sad irony, George Young’s younger brother, AC/DC rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young, dies four weeks later.\n\nHarry Vanda leaves Albert Productions in 2003. He starts Flashpoint Music in Surry Hills, Sydney, where he works with his son, producer/engineer Daniel Vandenberg. Harry Vanda produces The Wrights’ version of Stevie Wright’s ‘Evie’ (AUS no. 2); this charity single is issued in February 2005. Harry Vanda writes and produces most of John Paul Young’s (non-charting) album ‘In Too Deep’ (4 November 2006). British India is a young Australian band. Harry Vanda, working with Glenn Goldsmith, co-produces two albums by British India: ‘Guillotine’ (30 June 2007) (AUS no. 51) and ‘Thieves’ (19 July 2008) (AUS no. 5). In 2009 British India part ways with Flashpoint Music over a business dispute. Glenn Goldsmith continues to work with British India as their manager.\n\n‘Vanda and Young: Inside Australia’s Hit Factory’ (2010) by John Tait is published by University of New South Wales Press Ltd.\n\nAfter the 1986 Easybeats reunion, bassist Dick Diamonde devotes his time to caring for his elderly mother in coastal Queensland. In 2014 it is reported that Dick Diamonde ‘has now changed his name and is believed to be teaching high school physics on the Gold Coast’ of Queensland.\n\nAfter the 1986 Easybeats reunion, drummer Snowy Fleet returns to his successful family construction business in Perth, Western Australia. He also runs a rehearsal studio in Jundakot (a suburb of Perth), Western Australia.\n\nFormer Easybeats drummer Tony Cahill has a brain tumour removed in 2013. However, his health remains delicate. He returns to Sydney and lives with his cousin Paul. Tony Cahill dies at that address on 13 August 2014 as a result of a brain tumour. He was 72 years old.\n\nRhino Records puts out The Easybeats compilation EP ‘Little Bit Of Gold’ (1989). The four tracks on this disc are ‘Friday On My Mind’, ‘Gonna Have A Good Time’ (a.k.a. ‘Good Times’), ‘Pretty Girl’ and ‘Falling Off The Edge Of The World’. Albert Productions issues The Easybeats volume of ‘The Definitive Series’ (1992) on 18 September. This is a single disc compendium of twenty-two of the group’s most famous songs. Raven’s ‘Live – Studio & Stage’ (1995), released in October, is the only Easybeats live album.\n\nSongwriters Harry Vanda and George Young were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1988. On 14 July 2005 The Easybeats are also inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Only three members of the group – Stevie Wright, Harry Vanda and Snowy Fleet – attend the ceremony.\n\n‘Easy Fever: A Tribute To The Music Of The Easybeats And Stevie Wright’ (2008) is a two disc set. Among the performers featured here are The Wrights, whose cover version of Stevie Wright’s ‘Evie’ is included on this album.\n\nOn 26 November 2017 and 3 December 2017 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) screens ‘Friday on my Mind’, a two-part television dramatisation of the story of The Easybeats. The main cast consists of Christian Byers (as Stevie Wright), William Rush (as George Young), Mackenzie Fearnley (as Harry Vanda), Du Toit Bredenkamp (as Dick Diamonde) and Arthur McBain (as ‘Snowy’ Fleet). ‘Friday on my Mind’ is written by Christopher Lee and directed by Matt Saville.\n\nIn December 2017 a collection of Australian rock stars work together on the ‘Easyfever’ tour, a tribute to The Easybeats. Performing the classic songs of The Easybeats are Chris Cheney (from The Living End), Phil Jamieson (from Grinspoon), Tim Rogers (from You Am I), Tex Perkins (from The Cruel Sea, Beasts Of Bourbon and Tex, Don & Charlie) and Kram (from Spiderbait). Shows in this tour take place in Thirroul and Sydney (both in New South Wales), Brisbane (Queensland) and Melbourne (Victoria).\n\nThe Easybeats were ‘Australia’s Beatles…the best and most important Australian rock band of the 1960s.’ This accolade is bestowed despite, by one definition, The Easybeats not being an Australian group at all. None of the band’s five original members were born in Australia. Yet, in a way, this made them representative of the immigrant make-up that, arguably, defines Australian culture. In that sense, The Easybeats embodied Australian music of the time. Whatever their respective birthplaces, the members of The Easybeats came together in Australia and were embraced by Australian fans. However briefly, The Easybeats showed that an Australian act could compete on an international footing as something other than a novelty. Their elemental fusion of pop smarts and powerful, straight-forward rock music set the pace for the Australian wave of pub rock bands from around 1975 to 1985. The Easybeats lived with ‘the hysteria they created around the country [of Australia] with their live performances.’ They were ‘the real article and a rare musical commodity in Australia.’\n\nSources:\n\nlyricsfreak.com as at 11 March 2013\n\nwikipedia.org as at 14 January 2018\n\n‘Women’s Weekly’ (Australian magazine) ‘A Family Reunion for The Easybeats’ by Julie Kusko (15 October 1969) p. 8, 9 via trove.nla.gov.au\n\nmilesago.com – ‘The Easybeats, ‘Stevie Wright’ – no authors credited – as at 16 January 2018\n\ndictionaryofsydney.org – ‘Villawood Detention Centre’ by Mark Dunn (2010)\n\n‘Illawarra Mercury’ (Illawarra, Australia, newspaper) ‘Stevie Wright: The Story of a Rock ‘n’ Roll Legend’ by William Verity (26 December 2015) (reproduced on illawarramercury.com.au)\n\n‘Australian Story’ (Australian television program, ABC Network) ‘So Much to Say’ (Stevie Wright) (18 February 2013) (transcript reproduced on abc.net.au)\n\nforums.stevehoffman.tv – posting by Mike Griffiths (14 February 2015) [George Young’s family and his sibling’s birth-dates]\n\n‘Sydney Morning Herald’ (Sydney, Australia, newspaper) ‘George Young, Easybeats Guitarist and Songwriter gave AC/DC to the World’ by Glenn A.
