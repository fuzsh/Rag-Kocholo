        "text": "Usher Celinski was born in Skarżysko-Kamienna. During World War II, he was forced to work in a factory in Skarżysko before being taken to the concentration camp of Buchanwald. After liberation in 1945, Celinski and the other former prisoners of Buchenwald stayed at nearby military barracks for a time. His cousin, Rachel Bernstein, lived in Canada and began corresponding with him once she discovered he survived. She introduced him to Briane Sherman, a volunteer in the Canadian armed forces, who helped him gain entry papers to come to Canada. With these papers, Usher was able to move to Montreal in 1948 and he married Briane soon after."
