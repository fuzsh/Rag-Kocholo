DEATH OF MR. HENRY MEAKIN\", Geelong Advertiser (7 October 1910), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article149729901\n\nAnother of Geelong's pioneers in the person of Mr. Henry Meakin of the Derby Arms Hotel, passed away last night at the advanced age of 84 years and 10 months. He had failed rapidly in the last year, and became so feeble that he could scarcely walk. On Sunday he attended the Fenwick-street Baptist Church as usual, and on Monday had a weak turn, which terminated in a paralytic stroke. He never rallied, and died at 8.45 o'clock last night. Mr. Meakin was born in the town of Derby on December 12th, 1825, and was a sawmiller by trade. He arrived in Geelong on November 21st, 1851, when Governor Latrobe was Imperial head of Port Phillip. He had a letter of introduction from Colonel Gawler, Governor of South Australia, and brought out a sawmill to establish the industry in Geelong. He had much difficulty in landing the plant, and the operation cost him as much as the freight out from Liverpool. Trade was slack at the time, and he had an interview with the Governor, who advised him to follow the crowd to the goldfields at Ballarat before his men went and left him deserted. They all went and in eight weeks had Â£300 each. They soon returned to Geelong and established the mill at Griffin's Gully, deriving water supply for the plant from the dam, in Johnstone Park. The business was soon sold, and Mr. Meakin, after a short engagement as clerk to a timber firm, leased the Rock of Cashel Hotel, and then the Albion Hotel. In 1854 the proposal to form a Harbor Trust aroused much public feeling, and Mr. Meakin at the request of the movers successfully contested a Town Council vacancy against Mr. J. R. Bayley, afterwards Postmaster-General. After sitting a few years he again went to Ballarat, and in 1866 returned, taking the Derby Arms Hotel, where he lived till the time of his death. In 1875 he was reelected to the Town Council, and served the ratepayers until 1902. He was several times Alderman for Villamanta ward, and in 1888 occupied the mayoral chair. On August 10th, 1877, he founded the Geelong Harbor Committee, which aimed at having the Point Henry Bar removed, and Sir Graham Berry admitted that Mr. Meakin was the first man to ask that money be placed on the estimates for the work. It was out of compliment to the veteran's work that the Harbor Trust Commissioners named their hopper barge Henry Meakin after him. Mr. Meakin was a staunch advocate of the Corporation Act during the campaigns when the Local Government Act was fought for, and he always took a lively interest in the improvement of the parks and gardens in town. He was known as a model publican, and the police always gave his house the highest recommendation at licensing courts. Mr. Meakin was twice married. Mr. H. W. Meakin, late Under Treasurer of Victoria, was one of the family by the first wife. The second wife survives him, and there was one son of the issue, Mr. R. Meakin.\n\n\"THE LATE HENRY MEAKIN.

For nearly two hours the organ discoursed music of the highest class, culled from the works of Haydn, Handel, Rossini and Mozart. The organists were Mr. Russell from Melbourne, and Messrs. Downing, Moore, Plumstead, Hobday and Meeson of Geelong. The masterly execution of the pieces entrusted to each of these gentlemen \"whose praise is known in all the churches,\" merited the highest encomiums. There is not yet a regular choir connected with this church, but from appearances last night we have no doubt there soon will be. We observed several members of the choirs of other churches assisting in the anthems. The performance was highly appreciated by the audience. Between the pieces, Mr. Russell, who has had much experience in England, delivered an interesting address on the advantages of church music. In the course of his remarks Mr. Russell gave a short account of the advancement of sacred music during the last twenty years, and threw out some valuable suggestions for its improvement in the colony, so as to make it attractive in itself and of greater good to the public than secular music. The organ was made by John Courcelle, of London. It possesses two rows of keys and two octaves of pedals. It has a remarkably fine tone Its cost in England was Â£190, freight Â£30, erection and tuning Â£15 . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: John Russell (organist); Bartholomew Downing (organist); Henry Byron Moore (organist); Henry Plumstead (organist); Joseph Hobday (organist)\n\nMEGSON, Joseph (Joseph MEGSON; J.

He was based in Tasmania until 1845, then in Melbourne until 1853.\n\nThough mainly a performer and teacher, he is also documented as composer of songs and dances, all lost, including I knew him in his childhood (song; words: Mr. Reynolds) in Melbourne in January 1850; a New song (\"Written by Mr. Belfield, and the music composed by Mr. Megson\"), in July 1850; The pretty coquette (\"composed expressly for the occasion\"; words; Mr. Cox) in Hobart in January 1855; and a Quadrille The prince of Wales (\"Vocal Finale composed by J.

Meilhan's own composition, which certainly formed some of the most interesting features of the concert. The first was a fantasia for pianoforte with orchestral accompaniment. To this Mr. Moss did full justice, though he was rather overweighted by the orchestra . . . the matter of accompaniments . . . is mentioned now because it affected seriously the performance both of the piano solo and of the vocal quartet. Mons Meilhan's overture \"The Misers\" has already been favourably noticed, and it is, and should become, the bienvenu at all concerts here. Last evening M. Meilhan also introduced the first number in the opera, which, it is satisfactory to know, is nearly ready for production. This first number is a duet in which the leading tenor and soprano, who according to rule, are the hero and heroine, give some idea of the plot they have against the old miser, who is the heroine's father . . . The quartet referred to is a more ambitious effort, and deserves another hearing before pronouncing a definite judgment upon it. It contains abundance of harmony, and the composer has undoubtedly devoted great care to his work, while he evidently enjoys the full orchestration which surrounds the voices. Indeed Mons. Meilhan imposes no slight task on the instruments in any of his compositions. He writes apparently for each instrument as if it were a speciality, and expects each one to do its duty.\n\n[Advertisement], The Sydney Morning Herald (13 September 1879), 8\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13447417\n\n[Advertisement], The Sydney Morning Herald (22 September 1879), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28390296\n\n\"SYDNEY INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION\", The Sydney Morning Herald (23 September 1879), 6\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13447235\n\n\"THE MUSIC AT THE GARDEN PALACE\", The Sydney Morning Herald (30 October 1879), 7\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13454713\n\n\"THE MUSIC AT THE GARDEN PALACE\", The Sydney Morning Herald (31 October 1879), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13441514\n\n\"M.

JULES MEILHAN, B.A.\", The South Australian Advertiser (29 March 1882), 5\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article34279719\n\nThe farewell matinee concert tendered by the members of the Adelaide String Quartet Club to M. Meilhan, on the eve of his departure from South Australia for Italy, and which is advertised to take place on Thursday afternoon, March 30, at the Academy of Music, promises to be a great success, both in points of quality and attendance. The large circle of friends that M. Meilhan has gained during his residence in this colony, privately and professionally, will not allow him to take leave without testifying to their admiration of his abilities (both as a composer and as an instrumentalist) in some tangible form . . . Although he has only resided in Adelaide for two years, M. Meilhan has during that time thoroughly ingratiated him self with all musical circles, and whether in the capacity of performer, composer, or instructor, he has invariably given his aid on all occasions when his services have been required. As a musician he has reigned supreme during his stay amongst us. His performances and compositions have always been successfully carried out, and the example he has set in forwarding the musical interests of the city has given an impetus to the somewhat lukewarm appreciation of high-class music that unhappily exists in Adelaide, and has otherwise effected a considerable amount of good that merits public recognition. M. Meilhan has stayed in the colonies for seven years, five of which he spent in New South Wales. During this period he has composed several pieces, amongst which the best known to our readers will be his choral and orchestral solemn mass, the Exhibition Cantata, and two orchestral marches. Besides these he has composed several pianoforte studies, and a few songs, four movements of symphonies, four orchestral overtures, two small operettas in one act, one small opera comique, and a sacred mass for bass solo, choir, and orchestra. In addition to these. M. Meilhan has lately composed a 1st Quartet in D minor, which he has dedicated to the Adelaide String Quartet Club, and which will be performed for the first time on Thursday at the Academy. We have had an opportunity of examining this work, which is of more than average merit, and considering that the author only commenced it early last month and finished it on March 9, the composition affords another strong proof of the high musical abilities possessed by the composer. It is quite original, and for a first attempt will be highly thought of by the critics who hear it on Thursday. As a composition it is hardly as meritorious as the Solemn Mass, which, it may be remembered, was performed with great success in the Town Hall on Christmas Day, 1880, and on Good Friday, 1881; but as the two subjects are so entirely dissimilar it is perhaps hardly fair to draw any comparison between them. The work under notice is in four movements; the first, allegro vivo, treated in the sonata form; i.e., with the two principal subjects exposed, first singly and then developed thematically, and by means of double counterpoint circulating freely through the four instruments, is scarcely as meritorious as the other three. The second repeat of this movement is certainly superior to the first, there being considerably more freedom of form, whereas the introduction seems a trifle stiff. The second movement, andante, to which the composer has added the word madrigale, is from a technical point of view undoubtedly the best in the work. Each instrument moves melodically throughout in canonic imitation, like voices in a vocal concerted piece, and the harmonics are carefully studied and good. This movement is in F, with a secondary subject in D major. The third movement, scherzo moderato, is a sort of dispute, so to speak, between the four instruments, but chiefly between the first violin and cello. This effect is obtained by means of a double counterpoint closely written. The subjects are occasionally reversed, i.e., when the notes of one part are ascending at certain intervals the notes of the other part progress downwards at the same intervals, and vice versa. This movement is the most elaborately written of the four, though we prefer the compilation of its predecessor. The fourth movement-finale, vivace masquerade, is in complete contrast to the others. It is in the rondo style, and consequently more free than the first and third. The subjects are taking, though there is nothing particularly new or striking about them. Towards the end there are some curious passages, in which the subjects of the other movements occasionally seem to creep in miscellaneously in recapitulatory style. The finale is very good. It is somewhat difficult to thoroughly judge of the merits of a composition without hearing it performed, though a fairly correct idea may be obtained from an inspection of the manuscript. That the quartet by whom it will be treated will do it justice cannot be doubted, and we opine that M. Meilhan's Opus No. 1 will be very favorably received. Amongst the pieces to be performed on Thursday is Hummel's concerto in A minor by double quartet, which in itself, if well performed, will be a great treat, and M. Meilhan himself will appear twice in piano solos, the selections he proposes to play being: (a) Romance in D (Heller); (b) \"Danse des fees\" (Prudent). 2. (a) Arabesque (Schumann); (6) \"Mazurka des Salons\" (Meilhan). M. Meilhan sails for Naples, where he intends resuming his professional duties, in about ten days' time, and it is gratifying to know that his medical advisers are of opinion that his visit to Australia has permanently benefited his health.\n\n\"DEATHS\", South Australian Register (11 July 1882), 4\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43331803\n\n\"MUSIC AND THE DRAMA\", South Australian Weekly Chronicle (15 July 1882), 16\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91467385\n\n\"NEWS OF THE DAY\", The Sydney Morning Herald (4 August 1882), 5\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13516213\n\nA SHORT time ago a telegram from South Australia announced the death, at Naples, of M. Jules Meilhan, who was well known in Sydney as a pianist, and who was as much liked for his amiable disposition as appreciated for his musical talents. From letters received by the last mail we learn that he was under the impression that the journey from Adelaide to Italy had improved his health, and he was sanguine of his future. His parents arrived from France to greet him. He received them with exuberant joy, but the excitement was too much for him; a blood vessel in the lungs burst, and he died in less than fifteen minutes. His numerous friends in Sydney will not fail to sympathise with his widow, who, with their adopted child, purposes to return to France.\n\nMusical works:\n\nGrand march Advance Australia (1879)\n\nExhibition march (Adelaide: S.

MELVYN\", The Cornwall Chronicle (3 March 1876), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72524759\n\nFor some months Mr. James Hadock Melvyn, the well-known professor of music, has been in failing health, and on Wednesday he died at his residence in the Quadrant. Mr. Melvyn first arrived here as a member of the Original Christy Minstrels, and about ten years ago he returned, accompanied by late late Mr. Linley Norman and Miss Liddle. Both gentlemen settled here, following the musical profession. Mr. Melvyn was for years choir master of the choirs at Trinity and St. Paul's churches, Launceston. He was leader of one Launceston Choral Society, and of the Orpheus Musical Union. He has taught ladies in the highest families in the northern districts in singing. He has taken a leading part in very many of the best concerts given in Launceston. Having been a choir singer when a boy at, we believe, the Durham Cathedral, he was passionately fond of high class church music. He conducted the music at the opening of the new Protestant Church at Evandale, and the Church of Holy Trinity at Westbury. Mr. Melvyn had been a most successful puller at regattas in the old country, having been born at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and he was possessed at the time of his death of seven silver cups and trophies, which he valued highly as testimonials of his prowess in his younger days. We believe he never married, or probably his life would have been prolonged far beyond the age at which he died 40 years. He has been present at every regatta at Launceston, Longford, and Perth, except the last one, since he took up his abode here. Mr. Melvyn was a genial, kind hearted, amiable man. A gentleman who never said a word or performed an act offensive to any of the numerous delicate minded young ladies he had the honor to teach the art of singing. Of all the wide range of friends and acquaintances Mr. Melvyn made in this colony, we believe not one will hear of his decease without feeling a pang of regret . . .\n\n\"THE LATE J. H.

P. Schmedth . . . The influenza rendered the singing less pleasing than usual, but some German airs were well sung, and Mr. John Menge the celebrated Professor of Mineralogy, who was accidentally present, expaciated upon the advantages of making the art of singing a subject of scholastic tuition. When we look at the creditable manner in which almost every German present was able to take his part in the music upon this occasion, contrasted with the miserable deficiency of the vocal powers of Englishmen, we agree with him that the art should be so far encouraged as to make it a part of every educational course of instruction.

In his will, of January 1853, naming only his children as beneficiaries, Thomas noted that he and Christiana were separated, and that she was already by then \"the present wife\" of William Harward.\n\nShe had formed a relationship with Harward in Adelaide in 1851, while she was appearing there at the theatre with one of her daughters, the dancer \"Miss Mereton\" (probably the eldest Christiana). Together with Harward, they returned to Geelong in mid 1852. Confusingly, on a couple of Geelong bills in August 1852 she appeared as both Mrs. Mereton and Mrs. Harward, but thereafter, through the 1850s and 1860s, always as Mrs. Harward.\n\nBy new year 1851, Thomas had retired from the stage and was in business in Geelong as a leather and skin trader, and general dealer. In June 1852, he advertised that he was no longer responsible for any debts incurred by members of his family.\n\nThomas died in the wreck of steamer Monumental City in May 1853, along with the actors Gibson and Hannah Stubbs.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nBaptisms solemnized in the parish of Saint Mary Rotherhithe in the county of Surrey in the year 1814; register 1813-44, page 123; London Metropolitan Archives, P71/Mry/015\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com.au/discoveryui-content/view/5516917:1558 (PAYWALL)\n\nNo. 977 / 1814 Nov'r 25 / Born 22nd Sept'r 1814 / Christiana D. of / Andrew & Christiana / Wilkes / Salisbury Street Bermondsey / Mariner . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Andrew Rickers Wilkes married Christiana Cana at St. Katherine by the Tower on 5 February 1801; Christiana Cana, daughter of Benjamin and Mary Cana, was baptised at St. Giles in the Fields on 16 June 1782\n\nMelbourne, NSW (VIC) (9 to 25 December 1842):\n\n\"SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE\", Port Phillip Gazette [Melbourne, NSW (VIC)] (10 December 1842), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article225008287\n\nDecember 9. - Posthumas [sic], barque, 390 tons, Milner, master, from Gravesend 22nd August.

Torning, Deering, and Mereton, belonging to the Victoria Theatre, were brought before the Bench on the complaint of Mr. Lazar, the Manager of the Company, on a charge of having broken the Queen's peace by threatening to strike the complainant. From the evidence given, it appeared that the defendants, while standing in the vicinity of the Theatre Treasury, imagined they heard the complainant telling the proprietor that they were snobs, and never had played in respectable houses at home. The defendants had also heard the complainant insinuate, that a gold watch, lately stolen from the Theatre, was still in the possession of the Company. It was alleged in defence that all that took place was a challenge to fight out the affair if Mr. Lazar chose to become the assailant; and that they had each, in violation of the agreements on which they had emigrated, been all but thrown on the world without the means of support, in consequence of the complainant's conduct to them as performers. Mr. Brenan, who heard the case, having intimated that it would be dismissed, unless the complainant was prepared with evidence to show that he apprehended danger in future, the latter deposed to that fact, when each defendant was ordered to enter into his own recognizances, in Â£50, to keep the peace towards the complainant.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: John Lazar (actor, manager); Andrew Torning (actor)\n\n[Advertisement], The Sydney Morning Herald (9 December 1844), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12410357\n\nNOTICE.

Of Mr. Mereton we have little to say in approbation, and it is always more gratifying to ingenuous crticim to refer to beauties and excellence, than to point out indifference and blemishes. His performance of \"Hal Hardinbrass\" had nothing in it very striking or effective.

SIR, I sometimes hear the Organ of St. James's Church in an evening in the week day, played by some one who pulls out all the stops. The effect is awfully delightful. But I never hear the whole power of this beautiful instrument on the sabbath, when its full rich tones are calculated to excite the sublimest feelings.\n\nThere is another great fault in the Sunday player of this instrument. Except in the first and last verses of each psalm, he plays in so low a key, that nobody who does not wish to to make himself conspicuous, can venture to join in the psalmody. The only singers are the school girls and boys, & they sing very badly. The object of having an Organ in the Church, I have always understood, was, to command such a volume of tone as would enable all modest attendants to join in the singing; the congregation, therefore, ought to be incited to join a full organ, and not to be discouraged by a tone no louder than an itenerant organ grinder. The Sunday player of St. James's Organ ought to play the first, second, & third verses, with the same stops as he at present does the first and last; and for the last verse, as a grand chorus in praise of Almighty God, he should use that grand and sublime stop, the Trumpet stop. I am, Sir, yours, &c. X Y Z.\n\n\"TO THE EDITOR\", The Sydney Monitor (10 August 1833), 4\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32144299\n\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE SYDNEY MONITOR, Monday, August 5, 1833. SIR, HAVING been publicly questioned by a relation of Mr. Merrit's, the organist of St. James's if I was not the author of a letter containing some observations on that gentleman's organ playing, and which appeared in your Paper of Wednesday last, signed X.Y.Z., I hope you will do me the justice to state, that you never received from me a single line or statement either regarding Mr. Merrit's playing, or the mode in which the singing part of the service is conducted. I always considered it too delicate a matter for a person who was once organist of St. James's, to criticise publicly the performance of another, filling the same situation. The question put to me I consider a very rude one, and the party, from his liberal education, ought to have known better, especially, as he had a direct mode of ascertaining the truth, by application to you. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES PEARSON.\n\n[Mr. Pearson was not the author of the letter alluded to. We hope Mr. Merrit will not take it amiss, but adopt the writer's suggestions, in which we fully agree. We have ourselves been waiting to hear the trumpet stop since it was put up, but as the greatest volume of wound of late never exceeded what we used to hear when Mr. Pearson used to play the organ, we suppose Mr. Merrit seldom or never plays this grand stop. The thunder of a pealing organ borders on the sublime when a congregation joins.

Your committee beg to submit a list of musical instruments, the property of the band, and a list of music composed and arranged by Mr. Meulman, the bandmaster, by which it be perceived that up to the present time he has arranged for the band 99 pieces of music (each composed of 12 parts), which, with 24 series of printed music (including a set of cards containing several tunes kindly presented by Captain Laver to the company on the eve of his departure from the colony), place the company in possession of upwards of 150 tunes available for the use of the band.\n\nThese included Meulman's Night Parade waltzes and the unattributed Maitland galop.\n\nMeulman continued to be active and appreciated as bandmaster, also at Singleton and Gunnedah, into the 1870s.
