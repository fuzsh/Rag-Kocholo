        "text": "Faith: Christian\n\nCareer: Musician\n\nBirthday: October 14, 1978\n\nUsher (to us, Usher Raymond to his family) a singer, songwriter, and dancer. He is is considered one of R&B’s greats, with numerous awards and albums to his name. Usher is known for his soaring vocals combined with pulsating up-tempo dance floor beats and heart-tugging ballads. He has also acted in various films and television shows over the years and also appeared in Broadway’s Chicago.\n\nUsher Raymond IV was born October 14, 1978 in Dallas, Texas. His parents, Usher Raymond III and Jonetta Patton, decided to move to Chattanooga, Tennessee when he was just one year old. The family faced numerous challenges, with Usher's father absent from his life, an absence that undeniably shaped Usher's childhood. His mother, demonstrating tremendous strength, took on the dual role of both parents, providing love, guidance, and support to Usher and his younger brother, James.\n\nThe seeds of Usher's musical passion were sown early. He discovered his love for singing while still a child, often showcasing his talent in the choir of his local church in Chattanooga. This was where Usher first found the courage and determination to express himself through his voice.\n\nBy the time he was 12, his talent had begun to bloom, prompting a significant family decision. They uprooted their lives and moved to Atlanta, a city known for its vibrant arts scene and a place where Usher's budding talent could be nurtured and developed. It was a brave step, guided by the firm belief in his potential and the unwavering support of his mother. This move marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would see Usher evolve from a church choir singer to a globally recognized artist.\n\nThe humble beginnings of Usher's career saw a dramatic turn when he participated in the popular talent search TV show, \"Star Search.\" His exceptional performance did not go unnoticed and caught the eye of a representative from LaFace Records. This encounter was a significant breakthrough, and in 1994, just shy of his 16th birthday, Usher's self-titled debut album \"Usher\" was released.\n\nThough the path to fame is often fraught with difficulties, Usher navigated it with grit and tenacity. The turning point in his career came with the release of his third album, \"My Way,\" in 1997. It was a triumphant success, with the lead single, \"You Make Me Wanna,\" reigning supreme on Billboard's R&B chart for 11 consecutive weeks.\n\nThe momentum of Usher's career showed no signs of slowing down. He followed the success of \"My Way\" with an array of chart-topping albums such as \"8701,\" \"Confessions,\" and \"Raymond v. Raymond.\" These not only reaffirmed his status as a music industry stalwart but also earned him a handful of Grammy Awards, the most coveted honor in the music world.\n\nWhile his professional journey has been a series of escalating successes, Usher's personal life has been a more complicated tapestry of joy and sorrow. In 2007, he tied the knot with stylist Tameka Foster. Their union bore two sons, but over time the couple found themselves entwined in a web of differences and misunderstandings. This eventually led to a divorce in 2009, resulting in a painful split that impacted not only Usher but also their young children.\n\nA few years later, in 2015, Usher entered into marital bliss for the second time, this time with Grace Miguel. However, the echoes of the past seemed to repeat themselves, and after three years of togetherness, Usher and Miguel parted ways in 2018.\n\nUsher's Religious Beliefs\n\nEmbedded in Usher's life is his Christian faith. Jonnetta Patton, Usher's mother, is a devout Christian and brought Usher up under these beliefs. Usher started out by singing in his church choir. He has also thanked God in the liner notes of every album he has released to date.\n\nBack to the Celebrity Faith Database"
