        "text": "Vocalist Billy Usher sang with a number of bands during the 1940s, rarely staying more than a few weeks in any orchestra. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Usher was the son of Irish immigrants. His family had moved to Chicago by 1930 but had returned to Omaha by 1935, and by 1940 they had settled in Manhattan, where Usher worked as a delivery boy for a delicatessen while pursuing a career as a singer.\n\nUsherâs first break came in mid-1941 when he sang with Jack Teagardenâs band. He didnât stay long with Teagarden and may have only been a temporary substitute for regular singer David Allen. Usher also sang for George âPee Weeâ Erwin in early 1942 and Shep Fields in early 1943. He then spent time as a solo artist before joining Sonny Dunhamâs band in early 1944. He left Dunham in late May. While with Dunhamâs band, he met singer Pat Cameron, and the two married later that year.\n\nAfter leaving Dunham, Usher opened as a single in Albany, New York, and suffered an embarrassment after confiding to a couple of new acquaintances there that his draft papers had been stolen or lost shortly before he left the band. His new friends turned out to be government men, and Usher was taken to the local jail, where he spent the night. He straightened out the matter with the draft board the next day.\n\nUsher briefly worked for Harry James in November 1944, taking the place of Buddy Di Vito, who had received his draft notice. When Di Vito was rejected by the draft board, he returned to James, and Usher was let go.\n\nIn February 1945, Usher joined Tommy Dorseyâs orchestra as one of two male vocalists competing for a permanent spot in the band. The other was Frankie Lester. Dorsey was having trouble finding reliable boy singers at that time, and he put both men in front of the mike. Usher was gone in late February, signing with the NBC Blue Network to replace Tommy Taylor in the program On the Sunny Side of the Street in March.\n\nAfter leaving Dorsey, Usher also appeared as an uncredited talent show winner in the Universal Pictures musical On Stage Everybody. Publicity for the film touted him as one of ten winners of a nationwide contest, though in reality all were established show business talents. Each winner was shown in publicity photos receiving a movie contract.\n\nIn June 1945, before On Stage Everybody had reached the theaters, Usher joined Randy Brooksâ orchestra, appearing in the bandâs self-titled musical short for Columbia and singing on the bandâs first recording sessions with Decca. Usher remained with Brooks through early 1946, where his wife, Cameron, joined him in January. Both had left the band by March of that year. In July, he and Cameron joined Pee Wee Erwinâs new band.\n\nIn May 1947, Usher was noted as an ex-Gene Krupa vocalist, though itâs unknown when exactly he may have sang with Krupaâs band. That month, he joined Charlie Barnet. By October, though, he was rehearsing with a new band formed by tenor saxophonist Emmett Carls. In early 1949, Usher appeared on his own five-day-a-week, 15-minute radio program on WINS as well as a three-day-a-week, half-hour program on WOR, both New York stations.\n\nIn later years, Usher lived in Paris, Arkansas. Billy Usher passed away in 1995 at the age of 74.\n\nNotes"
