        "text": "Presented online for the first time as an exclusive at HerbieHancock.com is the following epic essay by Bob Blumenthal, which originally appeared in the 1994 Warner Brothers double disc set The Complete Warner Brothers Recordings. We invite you to press play on our jukebox and enjoy an annotated history of Herbie’s fascinating Mwandishi period, spanning the albums The Prisoner, Fat Albert Rotunda, Mwandishi, and Crossings.\n\n“When I told Miles Davis’s manager that I wanted to form my own group,” Herbie Hancock explained to a full house at Boston’s Jazz Workshop in 1972, “he asked me, Who do you plan to have in your trio?’ When I told him that planned to lead a sextet, he told me it was impossible for a group of that size to survive. Well, I kept a sextet together for three years until last week, when we added a seventh member!”\n\nHancock was speaking with justifiable pride, given the parlous state in which most working jazz artists found themselves in the early 70s. He had not only kept his band together, but sustained a constant personnel for two of those three years, taking advantage of the familiarity bred by nightly playing to build a collective knowledge that informed every set. It would not last forever. By 1974, Hancock had reduced and reconfigured his instrumentation, adopted a funkier rhythmic slant and achieved pop-chart success. His sextet period was no mere transition phase, however; it resulted in some memorable and influential music, most of which was documented during Hancock’s affiliation with Warner Bros.\n\nIf anyone was likely to beat the odds on leading a band in that rock-fixated era, it was Herbert Jeffrey Hancock, who had already shown an incredible knack for joining visionary impulses with commercial acceptance for nearly a decade. His first recording as a leader in 1962 had produced the blockbuster “Watermelon Man,” his 1965 masterpiece Maiden Voyage began life as music for a cologne commercial on television, and he had displayed singular range and flexibility with his score for Michelangelo Antonioni’s epochal film Blow-Up. Then there was the nearly six years Hancock spent in the Miles Davis Quintet, one of the seminal ensembles of that or any jazz period. Hancock was aboard when the trumpeter first added electric instruments, and would reconnect with Davis for influential recording sessions during the years that the music in the present collection was created.\n\nSo Hancock had one of jazz’s more diverse palettes at his disposal when he formed his band-including a thorough knowledge of bebop, modal and free jazz, a pioneer’s interest in the electric, rock-inflected style that had not yet been dubbed fusion, and experience writing for other media that prepared him for all manner of compositional sound-painting. He also knew what kind of ensemble would offer the greatest possibilities, which is why he insisted on a sextet where the smart money would have told him to economize.\n\nThe particular three-horn blend that Hancock favored can be traced back to his 1968 Blue Note album Speak Like A Child, where flugelhorn, bass trombone and alto flute were orchestrated in an expansive manner that revealed the influence of Miles Davis’s old friend and collaborator Gil Evans. The same options were available in Hancock’s first sextet, which is heard on the late 1969 sessions that produced the album Fat Albert Rotunda. The band had recorded The Prisoner for Blue Note earlier in the year which is closer to the searching impressionism of Speak Like A Child. Fat Albert Rotunda, in contrast, reflects the funkier electric avenues that link “Watermelon Man” to his contemporary efforts with Davis.\n\n“I did the music for the Fat Albert cartoon show Bill Cosby did on TV,” Hancock explained in a 1971 interview. “Bill had the soundtrack tape, which he played for the executives at Warner Bros., and they flipped over it; they just loved it. So I chose to record Fat Albert Rotunda as my first album for the label-which gave me the freedom to do Mwandishi next.”\n\nThe album, which is Hancock’s most commercial venture to date, was built around the original Hancock sextet that included Johnny Coles (trumpet, flugelhorn), Garnett Brown (trombone), Joe Henderson (tenor sax, alto flute), Buster Williams (bass, electric bass) and Albert “Tootie” Heath (drums), with studio reinforcements added. Given the functional nature of the music, the emphasis on funk rhythms is not surprising and sounds less dated a quarter-century later than the primitive electric piano that Hancock employs. Creating music around Cosby’s popular characters provided an effective opportunity to write popular music with some challenging wrinkles. For the most part, Hancock succeeded surprisingly well.\n\nAfter its mysterious introduction, with what sounds like a banjo/sitar hybrid and muted trumpet, “Wiggle-Waggle” becomes a funky celebration with clever rhythmic displacements and voicings passed among the brass and reeds. As responsive parts begin to accumulate, Joe Henderson launches a frisky, emotions-on-sleeve tenor solo as the ensemble shouts support. A typically open Hancock voicing, far removed from standard funk of this type, introduces a trumpet solo played by Count Basie alumni Joe Newman, who was in the trumpet section rather than the more introspective Coles. Newman’s shakes and the more complex backgrounds set up Hancock, who leaves a calling card of sorts with his opening solo break. His mix of riffing, counter-rhythmic tension, melodic flow and exclamatory trills feeds off the full band as it repeats the infectious theme to the fade.\n\nThe groove is heavier on the next track, befitting a “Fat Mama.” The simple melodic material is embellished by evolving call-and-response figures from the horns that inspire Hancock’s piano inventions as surely as the lumbering swing of the rhythm section.\n\n“Tell Me A Bedtime Story” is the best-known composition from this session, and one of his most tender ballad creations. After a haunting trumpet introduction, the sextet states the theme (Henderson on alto flute), reinforced by the full ensemble on the reprise. The harmonic and rhythmic suspensions on the bridge, plus the quirky resolution of the main melody, add great character to an already memorable line. Hancock takes a gentle half-chorus before the theme returns and sets up a double recapitulation and quiet, tumbling coda.\n\nLumbering funk returns with “Oh! Oh! Here He Comes,” which gains added heft as the trombones shoulder the theme. Hancock’s electric piano percolates under and between orchestral riffs, holding the groove and leaving space to appreciate Buster Williams’s earth-moving electric bass.\n\nGrand piano brings on “Jessica.” Garnett Brown’s trombone states the theme first, with Henderson’s alto flute trailing countermelodies. Then Johnny Coles takes over for a heartfelt flugelhorn lead as the ensemble spreads under his improvisation. Hancock follows with his only acoustic solo in this collection, offering another, more intimate opportunity to appreciate the supportive work of Williams and Albert Heath.\n\n“Fat Albert Rotunda” begins with a fanfare, which brings on the infectious theme. The two-note figure that underpins the performance is the focus of Hancock’s opening electric piano solo, which is spurred by an added (and unidentified) electric guitar. Henderson explodes into his tenor solo (the man has always known how to get started) and continues to wrestle demons as the signature vamp adds intensity underneath. The theme returns, with horn punctuations, before Hancock leads the fade out.\n\nThe more excitable “Lil’ Brother” ends Hancock’s first Warner Bros. project with some added starters featured. Bernard “Pretty” Purdie is in the drum chair. The theme (scored for trombone and alto flute in unison) gives way to what becomes a recurring guitar break by the late Eric Gale and the hortatory tenor solo is played by Joe Farrell. After Hancock’s solo, the theme leads to a coda that allows some of the gentler images from Fat Albert Rotunda to momentarily reappear.\n\nBy the close of 1970, when Hancock recorded his next session, only Williams remained in the sextet. With the exception of the bassist and trombonist Julian Priester, the personnel was made up of younger and less familiar figures, and everyone in the band had taken a Swahili name. Hancock was Mwandishi, the horn players were Mganga Eddie Henderson, Pepo Mtoto Julian Priester and Mwille Benny Maupin; and the rhythm section was completed by Mchezaji Buster Williams and Jabali Billy Hart. An affinity quickly arose among these musicians, which Hancock described with great enthusiasm during a June 1971 interview with this author shortly after the album Mwandishi was released.\n\n“My current band has hit a point where we are really turning out some great group music,” he reported. “One night in Chicago this band gave me the greatest musical experience of my life. We all just played beyond ourselves. I know how well each man can play, and we all played better. It was a spiritual revelation. We have come close to capturing that magic several times since. My other band had excellent nights, too, but the emphasis was more on solos. That band, I don’t think, was as daring as the one I have now. The earlier band would go through several mood changes in one tune; it was like a game we used to play, but we don’t try to do that anymore. I think the group is a little more subtle now. We try not to push the music any certain way, we just let it happen the way it happens.”\n\n“I’ve played with some fantastic soloists,” he went on, “but there’s a thing that I think is more important than solos. I think music is supposed to make you high, to give you an experience so that you can transport yourself from wherever you are and that whole physical contact with the world so that you can gain a little more consciousness-inner consciousness. think it would be impossible for most of my early music to do that, just from the very nature of the material; but my new music is set up to do just that. It’s set up to make you high.”\n\nHancock called Mwandishi “my favorite record of all the records I have ever made, and the loosest I’ve ever done. None of the tunes have chords. After we play the melody, then we can go where we want to. Usually the structure of the melody leads you in a certain direction, so at least you’re not walking off of a cliff. That’s what I was trying to do on ‘The Egg’” (from his 1964 Blue Note masterpiece Empyrean Isles), “and it worked out fine. I was lucky; but it’s not luck anymore. Now I’ve found a way of structuring the material so that when there are no guidelines to follow, there’s enough of a catalyst in the writing to give you something to go on.”\n\nThe new approach is quickly defined in “Ostinato (Suite For Angela),” dedicated to political activist Angela Davis. After Henderson’s trumpet and Maupin’s bass clarinet spin incantations over Hancock’s Fender Rhodes, Maupin and Williams state the lopsided vamp in 15/4 that provides the track’s melodic content. The second drum part, played by Ndugu Leon Chancler, and the guitar and percussion effects, provided by Ronnie Montrose and Jose “Cepito” Areas, respectively add further layers of complexity to the hypnotic pattern of eight beats plus seven beats.\n\nThe full group simmers its way into Henderson’s trumpet solo-a journey of probing insistence that elicits attentive responses from Hancock and the percussionists. Like his predecessor, Henderson captured some of Miles Davis’s melancholy, though his attack and sense of structure were his own. Priester reinforces the bass line as Henderson concludes. Then Hancock enters for a typical display of how to employ voicings and odd meters for maximum drama. The drummers, who really open up under the electric piano solo, settle down for Benny Maupin, who plays a bass clarinet solo of agitated meandering that recalls his innovative and often neglected contribution to Miles Davis’s Bitches Brew. Note that Maupin, originally a tenor saxophonist, is never heard on tenor sax on these recordings – one sign that Hancock was headed somewhere else with his music.\n\n“You’ll Know When You Get There” is a logical extension of Hancock’s impressionistic side, with Williams on bass violin and Henderson carrying the melodic lead while the others move in and out of focus. There is particularly keen interaction in the rhythm section throughout, although Henderson also blows passionately without accompaniment. After building to some gentle explosions, the theme is reprised and Maupin emerges on alto flute.\n\nWilliams’s insistent bass often seems to be in the lead with Maupin the accompanist as the energy flows between alto flute and rhythm section. Hazy cadences from Hancock bring the theme back briefly. What follows sounds more like a trio collage than a piano solo per se and illustrates Hancock’s comments. For all of the atmospherics on this track, the melodic eloquence of Hancock the composer remains.\n\nOne of the strongest signs of the collective spirit that powered this sextet is the written contribution of its members. Priester’s lengthy “Wandering Spirit Song” is another example of music as experience. It opens slowly, like a flower seeking the sun, with bowed bass and low bass clarinet tones implanting an ominous texture on Hancock’s more optimistic keyboard ruminations. Maupin and a muted Henderson slowly sob the theme, with Priester ultimately joining the bass’ supporting dirge before a more sprightly waltz feeling emerges.\n\nAs the melody gains assertiveness, the horns separate and Priester emerges with a lyrical trombone solo that again leaves space for active support from Hancock and Williams. He is followed, after a reprise of the waltz, by more extended collective improvisation that ultimately yields to an abstract Maupin episode on bass clarinet. In our interview, Hancock remarked that he had come to view passages like this as more commercial than Fat Albert Rotunda because “the direction is a direction that people are ready to receive. It relates to things that are happening today, like vegetarianism, yoga, the Maharishi, organic foods, spirituality in general.”\n\nMaupin definitely takes the band through some visions worthy of Carlos Casteneda, before a return to the theme and an extended free concluding duet by Williams and Hancock. “Albums like Mwandishi fit into what I think might be considered the new mainstream of jazz,” Hancock said at the time. “The new avant-garde has finally found a direction, but it’s like a spectrum. It’s not one direction; there are many directions and they all have to do with giving people an experience rather than just giving them a bunch of notes.”\n\nThe experiential approach was carried further on the 1972 recording Crossings, which introduced the group’s seventh member, Patrick Gleason on Moog synthesizer, plus conga drummer Victor Pontoja and a five-voice chorus.\n\n“Sleeping Giant,” a particularly ambitious Hancock composition, touches on several moods and textures as well as the added players and the expanded arsenals of the sextet regulars. Everyone except Gleason is playing percussion on the opening, which carries a strong African flavor that reinforced the album’s striking Robert Springett cover painting.\n\nHancock and Williams toy with the meter before establishing a forceful 6/8 that the pair ride into a magnificent extended improvisation. As in “Ostinato,” the steady pattern frees Hancock for some striking rhythmic superimpositions, while also allowing a heady momentum to build. Hancock sounds a phrase to signal a change in mood, and the horns return with slowly congealing parts that make effective use of muted trumpet against a deep trombone bottom.\n\nWilliams emerges with an odd, halting pattern on electric bass that supports Priester’s echo-laden meditations as Hancock and Hart grow more active, finally taking the music into a funky 13-beat vamp for the rhythm section. The quieter theme reappears just as suddenly, then gives way to a steadier, more symmetrical passage where Hancock again blows over charged backing from Williams and the others. His percussive approach prevails until he sounds the cue riff once again to bring the horns back for more thematic musings.\n\nNow Maupin takes over, with Williams and occasional percussion in support, until the other horns and the funk tempo returns. Linear development and pure sound are both used effectively in Maupin’s soprano sax solo, with sympathetic comping from Hancock that helps build the tension. Then the other horns are cued back in and the music seems headed for a peaceful conclusion; but the giant, far from exhausted, gives one final kick before the band closes with a passage where sound turns to pure air.\n\nChords from an acoustic piano trigger “Quasar,” the first of two Maupin compositions that complete the Crossings session. Built around a simple unison theme and a 7/4 time signature, the piece takes on a fluid, other-worldly coloration with Gleason’s synthesizer washes and the composer’s peripatetic alto flute. Henderson follows with one of his active, probing episodes as a cowbell reinforces the beat. The ending is effectively ominous-lost sounds in uncharted space.\n\nMaupin’s other contribution, “Water Torture,” makes even greater use of Gleason’s presence. It begins with strange sonic drips and disembodied voices, the drum and percussion parts offering the anchors of stability in this strange new world until electric piano and bass clarinet state the slinking theme that could pass for one of Hancock’s own. What follows is not so much a solo as a collective impressionist sound-painting, with everyone applying dabs of color to the constantly reconfigured canvas. The melody reappears to signal new rounds of invention, with Henderson often hovering at the top of the sound mass and Gleason supplying ever more impetuous colors.\n\nHancock sustained this approach briefly after signing with Columbia in 1973 and recording Sextant – but not for long. “One thing became apparent to me last year,” he explained in a 1974 interview that explained the change in perspective that led to his ultra-funky and enormously successful Head Hunters album. “I’d go to friends’ homes and see my albums on the shelves with lots of other people’s records, and they’d play all the others except mine. My intention at the time was to play music to be listened to with undivided attention; but how many people have the time to approach music that way? Before, I was so interested in spirituality that I didn’t recognize that a person puts on a record with his hands and not his spirit.” So the emphasis shifted from “heavy musical trips that try to expand people’s minds” to “making people feel like getting up in the morning and going to work.”\n\n“I’m not knocking the other thing,” Hancock insisted, “I’m just saying that there are several ways to look at music.”\n\nHe has persisted, in the decades that followed, to continue looking at music from various perspectives. Many of which have roots in either the funk or the freedom of his Warner Brothers years. – Bob Blumenthal, 1994\n\nPresented online for the first time as an exclusive at HerbieHancock.com is the following epic essay by Bob Belden, which originally appeared in the 2013 Sony Box Set ‘The Complete Columbia Album Collection, 1972-1988’. We invite you to press play on our jukebox and enjoy an annotated history of Herbie’s discography through the decades.\n\nPart 1: INTRODUCTION\n\nHerbie Hancock is a Chameleon. Not in the literal sense of the word but in the sense of an evolving, inclusive entity that flows with the waters and rhythms of life, embracing each moment for what it is: an opportunity to interact, communicate, and produce sounds and textures unique to the circumstances but meant for the human race as a whole. The Complete Herbie Hancock Columbia Album Collection reflects this inclusive nature, seeded in his Buddhist philosophy of life and exemplified by his music artistry. This collection spans 16 years in the life of Herbie Hancock from 1972-1988, a period which yielded a staggering total of 31 albums whose scope is beyond clarification by simplification. On these discs are contributions by Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, Ron Carter, Tony Williams, Kimiko Kasai, Carlos Santana, Jaco Pastorius, Wynton Marsalis, Bennie Maupin, Paul Jackson, Harvey Mason, Mike Clark and Bill Summers, producers David Rubinson and Bill Laswell, and engineers Fred Catero, Dave Jerden, and Tomoo Suzuki. Represented in this collection are the hit songs, the rare Japan-only LPs, the special collaborations that were part artistic and part technological, the multifarious ever-changing soundscapes that illuminate the evolution of jazz music and popular music through a singular vision: that of Herbie Hancock.\n\nProducer David Rubinson and engineer Fred Catero both transcended the norms of the commercial music market by facilitating the creation of music that appealed to the jazz fans, the pop music fans, and the audiophiles of their day. The state-of-the-art sound that Rubinson achieved on his productions was often enabled by Fred Catero, the in-house engineer for Rubinson’s Automatt recording studios, in San Francisco. Rubinson’s vision and sense of perfectionism maintained the highest level of production and artistic participation, and facilitated Herbie’s engagement in many musical and technological developments that were unique, innovative, and organic in the energized music world of those times.\n\nPart 2: HISTORY\n\nHerbert Jeffrey Hancock – named after Herb Jeffries, the Duke Ellington vocalist of the early 1940s – was born on April 12, 1940, in Chicago, Illinois. Considered to be a child prodigy, Herbie began an intense study of classical music, culminating in a performance with the Chicago Symphony at the age of 11, performing Mozart’s D Minor Piano Concerto. Herbie’s basic introduction to jazz came from an Art Blakey LP (Hard Bop) and his musical interests began to move in that direction. While a student attending Grinnell College in Iowa as an engineering major, Herbie began to think in terms of jazz music as a life’s work and eventually, this brought him back to Chicago which was, in 1960, a bustling city with a deep and self-sufficient jazz scene. Though initially Herbie had to support himself by working in the post office, he soon became successful and his reputation grew to the point where he quickly became a top-call musician. During the winter of 1960, Donald Byrd was in need of a pianist for an engagement and Herbie was recommended. After a quick one-song audition (“French Spice” was the song), Herbie was hired on the spot and proved to have such an impact on Donald that he brought Herbie to New York City with him.\n\nThe association with Donald Byrd led to Herbie being signed to Blue Note Records in 1962. His first LP, Takin’ Off(1962), gave him the chance to re-record “Watermelon Man” and this too proved successful for him and Blue Note (leading to many covers of the song that appeared soon after his jazz hit and Mongo Santamaria’s famous version.). Herbie’s association with Blue Note lasted eight years (1962-69), producing eight released LPs and generating many classic jazz compositions – “Watermelon Man,” “Cantaloupe Island,” “One Finger Snap,” “Maiden Voyage,” “The Eye Of The Hurricane,” “Dolphin Dance,” and “Speak Like A Child” among them. In 1963 Herbie’s talent caught the ear of Miles Davis, who hired him in May of 1963, beginning a fruitful collaboration for five years. During Herbie’s tenure with Miles, he made lifelong musical connections with his fellow band mates Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams (later to also be members of the V.S.O.P. group). It was with Miles Davis that Herbie first traveled outside the United States and learned the subtle art of leading a band. During Herbie’s years with Miles, his growth as a diversified artist was evident in his many appearances as a recording session musician on many classic Blue Note sessions with the likes of Lee Morgan, Wayne Shorter, Donald Byrd, Kenny Dorham, Bobby Hutcherson, and Jackie McLean, as well as performing in clubs with musicians as diverse as Sonny Rollins and Benny Goodman. In 1966 he was commissioned to compose his first film score for Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up. During this time he was also composing for television and pursued a successful career composing advertising jingles. A number of Herbie’s famous compositions, such as “Maiden Voyage,” began as TV commercials.\n\nBy the fall of 1968, Herbie left Miles to form The Herbie Hancock Sextet. This was the name used in live performances during the making of Herbie’s first Warner Brothers LP, Fat Albert Rotunda, a recording of music used for the Bill Cosby television show, Fat Albert. In a musical sense Herbie was realizing the coloristic opportunities to expand his own unique sense of orchestration and form. With a textural template exposed with the recording of Speak Like A Child (1968) of a three-horn frontline and the musical partnerships created from The Prisoner (1969) recording session (Johnny Coles, Garnett Brown, Joe Henderson, Buster Williams, and Albert “Tootie” Heath), the seeds for Mwandishi were being sown.\n\nPart 3: THE MWANDISHI BAND\n\nThe new sextet that recorded both of Herbie’s next two Warner Brothers LPs, Mwandishi (Herbie’s Swahili name, meaning ‘Composer’) and Crossings, was formed in 1970, with Eddie Henderson, Julian Priester, Bennie Maupin, and Billy Hart (contextually replacing Coles, Brown, Henderson, and Heath) and Buster Williams (retained from the first sextet). Thus began Herbie’s odyssey of growth, change, exultation, and ultimate commercial disappointment leading to a re-invention and rebirth that had few, if any, precedents in jazz history.\n\nThe Mwandishi Band developed into a unique group, which created a conceptual music that mixed contemporary classical music with African textures, group improvisation and simultaneous individuality based on the varied personalities within the band. Crossings (Warner Bros., 1971-72) was a dramatic statement as to how far form and conception had come within the world of jazz music. The Mwandishi Band was an orchestra inside of a jazz septet. Each musician played a variety of instruments, all of them doubled on exotic percussion instruments, and in live performances an entire set of music could be one continuous suite. Herbie expanded the group to include the synthesist Patrick Gleeson in 1972, allowing for colors that were unheard of in music at the time. On Crossings, an artistic peak for this band, these fresh and inventive textures and formats for improvisations cemented the group’s place in contemporary jazz history. The next album by The Mwandishi Band was Sextant, Herbie’s very first for the Columbia label.\n\nThe group flowered during this current time of African-American self-awareness, and as this movement was defined as both a social and political movement, the musicians who embraced the moment (but not necessarily the movement) found themselves performing to small, enthusiastic but exclusive crowds, which made the sustaining of a seven-piece band with a lot of cargo more of a labor of love than a sound financial investment. In 1973, the tastes in jazz were changing rapidly. The jazz-fusion movement was moving in different directions, some purely populist and others hard-edged and rock-centric, while still other musicians were going into unique, individualist directions that could not be categorized. The audience for jazz music at the time wanted something that they could relate to in a direct way. Via fusion, jazz was gaining acceptance in the larger music public; for the first time a jazz musician could make a choice about the direction they wanted to take and find a way to make it viable either on a purely artistic level or on a mercantile level or, as in Herbie’s case, both. Herbie had that rare opportunity to make a choice, as his music was on the cutting edge of jazz and fusion jazz. After one fateful gig in Los Angeles, the direction options began to narrow.\n\nPart 4: HEAD HUNTERS\n\nHerbie and The Mwandishi Band were booked to headline a week of 16 shows in Los Angeles at the famed Troubadour club as part of their newly designed and expanded touring regime: rock clubs and college campuses. The nominal opening act was a newly signed group from San Francisco, the Pointer Sisters. David Rubinson managed and produced both the Pointers and Herbie, so it was only natural for one hand to help the other. From the opening notes of the Pointers’ set, there was an immediate ecstatic reaction from the crowd, and by the end of their short set the audience was standing on its feet wanting more. As The Mwandishi Band played its set, some of the audience was baffled and a few people began to leave the club (well documented in a review that appeared in Down Beat magazine in the summer of 1973). Herbie was struck by the energy and connection the Pointers had with the people, and resolved to find a way to reach a wider and more enthusiastic audience. Coupled with the financial strain that the septet was causing, plus Herbie’s growing spirituality and awareness of cause and effect, Herbie made a conscious decision to take his music in a new direction. He and Rubinson created a new band, retaining Bennie Maupin from The Mwandishi Band, and hiring jazz/funk electric bassist (and former jazz organist) Paul Jackson from Oakland, Afro-centric multi-cultural percussionist Bill Summers from New Orleans, and Harvey Mason on drums, a star of the Los Angeles studio scene. This newly formed quintet played low profile performances around Los Angeles and the Bay Area during the summer of 1973 and then went into the studio soon afterward to record the now-classic Head Hunters.\n\nThe impact of the recording started on Black College radio and campuses (particularly at Howard University in Washington DC), and exploded all over the U.S., Japan, and Europe. The LP went Gold in the U.S. within months and the edited single, “Chameleon,” ultimately became a hit at commercial radio and in the dance clubs, and was adopted by jazz-funk bands everywhere as an instrumental feature. On Head Hunters, Herbie returned to his roots as a composer of melodies and phrases that could take hold of the listener’s mind and wrapped them in a groove that went to the roots of public ritual music. With Mason and Summers, Herbie re-worked his first hit, “Watermelon Man,” to fit into the new sound of this group, and this new arrangement became a highlight on his concert tours. Live, Harvey Mason, whose studio commitments precluded touring with the band, was replaced by Paul Jackson’s old friend, Oakland-based drummer Mike Clark, completing the formation of the first touring edition of The Head Hunters Band, which was together from 1973-76, and their development into a cohesive and creative group was made evident on the release of the next LP Thrust (1974). Thrust was an extension of Head Hunters, and one of the songs originally recorded for the Head Hunters LP (“Actual Proof,” which had been recorded in 1973 with Mason), was re-recorded to allow for Mike Clark to appear on the entire LP.\n\nIn 1974 and 1975 Herbie’s Chameleonesque talents were vividly on display, as he created and recorded two extremely diverse projects: Death Wish and Man-Child. (Herbie’s score and soundtrack LP Death Wish will be discussed later). His last LP utilizing the full Head Hunters Band, and his first to feature Wah Wah Watson (Melvin Ragin), Man-Child was an expression of Herbie’s unique and personal concept of orchestration and texture; a primer on how to blend and synergize synthesized and acoustic instruments. The LP was recorded by Fred Catero in such a way as to allow the listener to hear in the most vivid detail the different tonal shadings and details of the widely varied sound of the instruments. Overlooked since its first release, Man-Child charted a different direction in the language of jazz for ensemble writing in the progressive musical environment. During the summer of 1975, Herbie toured Japan, where he and The Head Hunters Band were captured live in concert for CBS/Sony (Flood).\n\nAs the band began to settle into a more focused groove, more dance-funk than jazz funk, he worked ever more closely with Wah Wah Watson, and replaced Mike Clark with James Levi. The result of this change was Secrets (1976), which retained some of the original sound of The Head Hunters Band, but foreshadowed the changes coming in the next stage of Herbie’s creative direction.\n\nThe impact of Herbie’s recordings with The Head Hunters Band changed the world of jazz by opening up the mindset of both jazz musicians and the listening public to the fact that music could have the power of communicating to a larger set of minds and voices yet retain its musical complexity, quality, and integrity. The band had a string of hits that have become part of the global vocabulary of musicians (“Chameleon,” “Actual Proof,” “Hang Up Your Hang Ups”) and raised the bar for production standards.\n\nThis period was also marked by the vastly increased range of expression that the expansion of his keyboard arsenal afforded Herbie by the rapid development of the synthesizer. From simple monophonic keyboards (one note at a time) and sound effects commonly used merely to mimic brass and strings, synthesizers developed into acutely sensitive and expressive sound sources of their own, uniquely electronic but profoundly musical instruments. In Herbie’s hands, they are fully explored to their sonic and musical potential. On these recordings Herbie and his team continued their collaborative production practices that began with Mwandishi, and expanded thereafter. Herbie realized ever more fully that the studio itself is an instrument, and he became increasingly expert at recording techniques, post-production, mixing, and editing. Thus he would compose using the usual components of rhythm and melody and harmony, but with studio techniques part of the musical foundation, not just an afterthought.\n\nPart 5: VSOP\n\nIn the spring of 1976, Hancock manager Rubinson asked impresario George Wein to produce a live retrospective of Herbie’s career at his Newport Jazz Festival that summer in New York City, to feature a reunion of the legendary Miles Davis Quintet of 1964-68, featuring Miles, Herbie, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams. With Davis unavailable, Hancock and Rubinson decided instead to facilitate a concert called V.S.O.P. (a Very Special One-Time Performance), with programming centered around Herbie, and with Freddie Hubbard on trumpet in place of Miles. The flow of the concert was a mix of retrospective, reunion, and rejuvenation, apportioned equally as The Quintet, The Mwandishi Band, and The New Herbie Hancock Group (the band from Secrets, with Wah Wah Watson). Recorded by Rubinson and Catero for Columbia Records and released in the spring of 1977, V.S.O.P. in many ways was the springboard for the rebirth of acoustic jazz as a viable commercial entity. Newsweek even had V.S.O.P. on its cover declaring “Jazz Is Back.”\n\nV.S.O.P. (The Quintet) began touring the summer of 1977 with Hubbard, Shorter, Hancock, Carter, and Williams, recording a follow-up live 2-LP set in 1977 for the U.S. market (V.S.O.P.: The Quintet) and the Japan-only live 2-LP set V.S.O.P.: Tempest In The Colosseum. The group clearly began to demonstrate in their recorded performances the characteristics of a real working band, with new music being composed exclusively for each musician within the ensemble. Rather than being an imitation of a historical association, V.S.O.P. had a unique sound that was a logical extension of a historical association. It was only after applying individual learned experiences cumulatively to this situation that V.S.O.P. could be called a band and not an artifact. After taking a year off, V.S.O.P. re-assembled for a tour of Japan, recording a live 2-LP set (V.S.O.P.: Live Under The Sky) (1979) and their only studio LP, Five Stars (1979) during their stay. At the time that V.S.O.P. was created, the U.S. market for jazz was in a complete state of flux as styles changed at a moment’s notice and the pressures for jazz musicians to keep both flames (acoustic and electric) alive started to take its toll on the audience. V.S.O.P. lit a fire in the jazz market, culminating in the eventual rejuvenation of acoustic jazz during the early eighties. This group proved that there was a need and an avid audience for acoustic jazz and they maintained a touring schedule well into the eighties, but without a recording contract. Alumni of V.S.O.P. include Freddie Hubbard, Wynton Marsalis, Wayne Shorter, Branford Marsalis, Bobby Hutcherson, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Buster Williams, Tony Williams, and Al Foster. It is within this collection that the world will hear the complete body of work created by the group V.S.O.P. (1976-79) for the first time in its entirety. Long overdue.\n\nPart 6: POST HEAD HUNTERS: SECRETS AND BEYOND\n\nAt the very same time that Herbie was re-discovering his past with V.S.O.P., he was creating a new future – beginning with the recording of Secrets (1976). The core band was similar to the personnel that had recorded Manchild (Bennie Maupin, Wah Wah Watson, Paul Jackson, but now with James Levi on drums), but the direction that Herbie was going with his music required a break from the past. With the arrival of dance and funk music as the lingua franca of the American and international audience, Herbie transitioned his band from a free-wheeling jazz/funk fusion band to a more tight-knit funk band, yet still in a primarily instrumental setting.\n\nOn Secrets (1976), Herbie included background vocals on the dance track “Doin’ It,” but this was an adjunct to the instrumental melody and rhythm track. Then came even more conceptual changes with the release of Sunlight (1977) where Herbie began to fully realize the vocal possibilities enabled by the advance of synthesizer technology. Herbie’s creative use of the newly invented Sennheiser Vocoder allowed him to sing his songs in his own voice, and even harmonize them according to his own language, expanding his composing opportunities to include popular vocal music concepts. By increasingly developing his skills as a songwriter/collaborator, Herbie was able more fully to access and express the freedom of form that vocal music encouraged.\n\nThe method Herbie used for creating Sunlight and the next three “vocal” LPs – Feets Don’t Fail Me Now (1979), Monster (1980), and Magic Windows (1981) – was innovative and productive, and synergized and enabled as usual by further technological advances. Well before MIDI (Musical Instrumental Digital Interface) became a recognized standard for controlling and interfacing various digital devices, Herbie and his brilliant technical collaborator Bryan Bell were devising their own unique and increasingly efficient systems for controlling his growing collection of electronic instruments, and storing the data for recall and re-use. This meant that Herbie could assemble his entire sound array and create, edit and then recall and instantly re-assemble entire rhythm tracks and melodic concepts, essentially by himself. He developed a three-tiered compositional technique, first creating the rhythm track and basic harmonic/tonal structure, then the core melodies, and finally collaborating on the final song structures, melodies, and lyrics to create unique songs. The lyricists included his sister Jean, and the Grammy Award-winning writers Jeffrey Cohen and Allee Willis.\n\nFeets Don’t Fail Me Now was focused on dance/vocal music. Monster, while a mix of dance music, pop, and hard rock, most fully realized Herbie’s development as a songwriter and creator of pop vocal music. Recorded largely in L.A., the core recording band included Wah Wah, Ray Parker Jr. (later to become widely successful as a solo artist [Raydio] and the composer of the theme from Ghostbusters), Alphonse Mouzon on drums, and Sheila Escovedo (later known as Sheila E.) on percussion, plus Gavin Christopher and The Waters Family on vocals. Monster also featured Carlos Santana on the dance single “Saturday Night,” which crossed over from the dance charts to pop music formats.\n\nAs Sunlight was defining a new sound and direction for Herbie while still maintaining an intricate balance between acoustic and synthesized textures, by contrast, Mr. Hands (1980) was an LP that was, in a way, a collection of outtakes and musings, as exemplified by Herbie’s then recent pairings with Ron Carter and Tony Williams from V.S.O.P., and on bassist Jaco Pastorius’ debut LP. Included on Mr. Hands is a remixing of a track recorded on the original Head Hunters session, “Shiftless Shuffle.”\n\nFrom 1977 until 1981, the sound of most of the Hancock recordings was dominated by synthesizers. Polyphonic instruments were being designed and manufactured at an alarming rate until musicians were overwhelmed by the choices. Herbie found that some synthesizers had unique tonal qualities, and polyphonality, such as the Prophet models and Yamaha CS-80. In this period, Herbie’s and sound technician Bryan Bell’s programming yielded soundscapes that recalled “real” acoustic instruments – but synthesized, created, and controlled by Herbie alone. Bennie Maupin developed skills on the Lyricon, a wind synthesizer, first used in touches on Man-Child. The instrument became an integral part of the sound of the band, opening up new textures and enabling a wind musician’s technical facility to have influence on presenting electronic sounds.\n\nMagic Windows (1981) and Lite Me Up (1982) found Herbie in the studio environment favored by L.A. singer/songwriters. Lite Me Up was the first time that Herbie was basically the sole producer of his own album (except for two tracks which were produced by Narada Michael Walden and Jay Graydon). On Lite Me Up Herbie emulated his long-time friend, Quincy Jones, collaborating with songwriter and Jones collaborator Rod Temperton, while using Earth, Wind & Fire engineer George Massenburg and their studios, and a variety of L.A. session singers for the vocals. But, one more time, the Chameleon Herbie was poised to make another monumental, paradigm shift, a conceptually re-organizing and re-defining move that paralleled his shift in 1973 when Head Hunters was first constructed.\n\nPart 7: THE ROCKIT BAND\n\nThe music industry was suffering financial and esthetic woes as the seventies turned to the eighties. The Chicago Disco Riot in 1979 was a signal that things were changing in the public’s perception of what kind of music they wanted; a demand to segregate (or categorize by specific genres) music according to specific tastes, thereby limiting music and musicians intellectually from the ability to develop a broad, general audience for their music. Punk rock became new wave, tamed and commercialized. R&B and soul music slowly became hip-hop and then rap music. Music Television (MTV), a new video jukebox channel, began using promotional videos to create a successful cable broadcast company that had a profound effect on the music industry, replacing radio as the prime driver for a successful single or new artist. And MTV was dominated by pop music and had no R&B or jazz artists in their performance rotation. As for the state of jazz, the harder edges of fusion morphed into funk and then disco and then into an emerging concept that eventually became known as smooth jazz. With the success of V.S.O.P. and the recent trend of former fusion artists returning to acoustic jazz, many younger musicians began to look back to the past as inspiration for the future.\n\nNature abhors a vacuum, so kids in New York’s South Bronx in the late seventies, following closely the revolution in sound and music that had exploded in Jamaica, largely in Kingston, and lacking funds for fancy instruments and sound systems, turned to indigenous devices close at hand to create new songs, forms, and textures. As with the DJs in Kingston, the turntable became an essential instrument. The cheap microphone being broadcast over a boom box. Mouth percussion. Dancing. No-holds-barred words and rhymes. The U.S. version of this music was at first called breakbeat (and eventually hip-hop), but one thing was clear: this music was developing in an urban setting and one in particular – the South Bronx. To capture the energy and excitement of this new sound and direction, you had best be a musician and producer living in New York City in 1981-1982 and have your ear to the street. One such person was producer/musician Bill Laswell.\n\nHerbie met Laswell at a time when conjunction meant something. Herbie had been involved in every major development in modern jazz and pop music since 1962 and he was at a crossroads by the end of 1982. With Herbie’s immense intellectual curiosity and quick-to-comprehend sensibility when encountering new music concepts, the collaboration of Herbie Hancock and Bill Laswell flourished. Credit is also due to the mutual respect of musicianship shared between Herbie and Laswell and his band Material, which was the springboard for this collaborative project. The musicians created a positive environment to move a conjunctive idea into a complete summation of an emerging art form. What Herbie was looking to find in Monster, a mix of funk and rock, he found with the LP Future Shock (1983), and the globally mold-shattering single “Rockit.”\n\nAs with his life philosophy of inclusive participation, “Rockit” desegregated and de-ghettoized pop music, if only for a brief moment. The composition reflected the emerging breakbeat sound with the use of actual rhythm breaks (spaces left open in the performance for improvisation, usually in between choruses and verses), the turntable, heavy metal crunch guitars, a Fairlight Synthesizer sequence, the Linn Drum, and a techno-driven groove. The composition reflected the mixing of an inclusive and collaborative urban culture but was produced with such elegance that the sound of urbanism was embraced worldwide. The music video for “Rockit” also broke vast new ground. MTV played the “Rockit” video in heavy rotation, and Herbie was seen picture-in-picture, among the very first African-Americans to actually be seen and featured on the historically all-white MTV.\n\nFollowing Future Shock were two more Laswell produced projects, Sound-System (1984) and Perfect Machine (1988). Each LP/CD (as Columbia moved into full time CD production) was shaped around the basic sound of the “Rockit” band – turntable, samplers, drum machines, sequencers – but with subtle differences. Sound-System was more Afro-Centric and Perfect Machine tends towards real techno-metal and is intently computer driven.\n\nFuture Shock re-aligned the balance between electronic and acoustic music, street music and pop music, in favor of the electronic. Herbie’s “vocal” LPs and Future Shock opened doors for composing music that was created electronically first, using sequencers. In 1973 Head Hunters and the single “Chameleon” caused a revolution in which jazz and funk merged perfectly. Future Shock and “Rockit” from 1983 caused a similar revolution. While the effects were not felt as strongly in the jazz community at the time, they were embraced wholeheartedly in the global electronica and digital arts communities and on the streets and dance clubs of the world.\n\nPart 8: SPECIAL PROJECTS\n\nHerbie’s contract with Columbia was structured specifically to allow him artistic and creative freedom. He could deliver various projects which were ostensibly not “commercial,” and thus was afforded wide artistic freedom for an artist with an exclusive obligation to a single company. In Japan, Columbia/CBS Records partnered with Sony to form CBS/Sony. The people at Sony Japan had been long-time jazz fans and Herbie aficionados, and they proposed various recording projects, conceived strictly for the Japanese market.\n\nHis first project with Sony Japan was Dedication (1974). Taking advantage of Sony’s interest in audio technology, Herbie was able to utilize the advances that Sony engineers were developing at the time, often years ahead of the commercial application of the concept. Dedication was a live to PCM digital recording. This was one of the first recordings to use this new technology. One side was acoustic piano and the other side was all synthesized, both recorded live in real time, without any overdubbing.\n\nHerbie continued to record for CBS/Sony until 1981 and his output included The Piano and Directstep, early examples of direct-to-disc recordings. Direct-to-disc meant recording live to the actual master disc, which was then used to make stampers to press multiple copies, eliminating the middle elements which affected audio quality.\n\nDirectstep was also one of the first analog recording projects to be converted into a digital format for release as one of the earliest compact discs. The audio quality of these recordings is a tribute to Fred Catero and Tomoo Suzuki, with whom Rubinson and Hancock worked intensively.\n\nHerbie recorded two trio LPs, both direct to digital, that featured Ron Carter and Tony Williams (The Herbie Hancock Trio (1977) and The Herbie Hancock Trio With Ron Carter + Tony Williams (1981). Both LPs – the only piano trio albums Hancock ever recorded under his own name – demonstrated the synergy that these musicians possessed, a deep level of communication that was only obtained by years of conscious effort.\n\nHerbie rekindled the friendship and the musical spirituality he shared with Chick Corea by partnering for a series of duo concerts, which resulted in a collection of performances released as An Evening With Herbie Hancock And Chick Corea In Concert (1978). The following year, Herbie traveled to Japan for a series of concerts with his current group and recorded an all-vocal LP featuring the Japanese singer Kimiko Kasai (Butterfly, 1979). This LP featured many songs with lyrics by Jean Hancock, Herbie’s sister.\n\nBefore Wynton Marsalis became the jazz icon of today, and fresh from working with Art Blakey, his first major tour was with Herbie, Ron, and Tony. Quartet (1982) represents this collaborative juncture for both of these musicians. After the tour, Herbie went to New York and produced and performed on Wynton’s first Columbia LP.\n\nA Herbie Hancock project produced by Bill Laswell and Herbie that was not part of the Future Shock, Sound-System, Perfect Machine trilogy was the collaborative album with Foday Musa Suso, Village Life (1985), a one-of-a-kind recording mating Herbie’s synthesizers with the kora and talking drum of Suso.\n\nIn 1974, Herbie did the score for the motion picture Death Wish (1974). Within that project were musicians from The Head Hunters Band mixed with strings, woodwinds, and brass. At times the music goes beyond the limitations of a film score into a singular conception of a composition not dependent on a visual narrative.\n\nTen years later, Herbie was asked to be involved in the motion picture Round Midnight (1986). His role was that of a music supervisor, composer, arranger, and actor. It led to Herbie’s first Oscar, an Academy Award for Original Music Score in 1986. Round Midnight is a rare film soundtrack that works on and off the screen as a complete musical statement.\n\nHerbie left CBS (Columbia) Records in 1988 to embark on a continuing, multifarious recording career, culminating in his ground-breaking The New Standard (Verve, 1995), the elegant celebration of Gershwin’s World (Verve, 1998), the Album Of The Year Grammy Award-winning The River (Verve, 2007), and his grand opus, The Imagine Project (Hancock Records, 2010), which is the summation of all of his experiences in creating music, and expands this to embrace the extant inclusionary principles that make the music of Herbie Hancock so special.\n\nPart 9: SUMMARY\n\nBehind every successful artist lies a philosophy of life, whether it is spiritual, mercantile, or technological. It makes no specific limitation, and inside these elements of a life structure come evocations; in the case of musicians, these evocations are manifested in the form of a song, arrangement, recording, concert, and lasting personal connections. Taken in its entirety, The Complete Herbie Hancock Columbia Album Collection gives the listener and reader a glimpse into the internal philosophy of life of Herbie Hancock. Rarely does a collection of sound contain so much of a human being’s revelatory process. In this collection, you can listen to a musician reinvent himself time and time again, all on his own terms. You can understand one aspect of Buddhism, that of inclusion, as Herbie fought against the trends of exclusion by letting his music reach out beyond the restrictions of the status quo. The scope of his music, his person, his outlook on life and the human existence, can be taken as a whole when appreciating the legacy presented in this treasure chest of sound and human soul.\n\n– Bob Belden\n\nVery special thanks to Richard Seidel, Seth Rothstein, Hal Miller, Max Schlueter, and Melinda Murphy.\n\nSidebar: JEAN HANCOCK\n\nThis box set allows, for the first time, a chance for the listener to fathom the lyrics created for Herbie Hancock’s music by his sister, Jean Hancock. Jean created lyrics that reflected her vision of a world filled with love, hope, beauty, and, above all, optimism. Her words were aspirational, in that she wanted the listener to dream of the environment she would describe in a phrase or rhyme (not in the contemporary sense of rhyming as in hip-hop, but in the more classical poetic sense). In Jean’s vision, “Maiden Voyage” was transformed into an epic journey of self-discovery. Using the premise that love, in and of itself, is a profound human experience, “Satisfied With Love” promises that the only way to true love is to fill the cup of life to capacity. Jean reaches into heartache and the redemption of the soul with her words for “Harvest Time.” “Tell Me A Bedtime Story” is an elegant narrative that recalls the universal desire of children to enter the world of dreams, awaiting all of the fantastical rewards those dreams create.\n\nHer words reflected a gentleness that was poetic and sensitive, soulful and graceful, the meaning and impact of the poetry flowering with Herbie’s melodies and harmonies. The music that she and her brother created was in temperamental contrast to much of Herbie’s other songwriting collaborations, making these songs unique, artistic gems worthy of consideration.\n\nSidebar: DAVID RUBINSON\n\nDavid Rubinson, while less known to the wider public, was a revolutionary innovator in the world of production and recording. When studying Herbie Hancock’s work, it quickly becomes apparent that his long-time collaborator, Rubinson, had a strong influence on most of Hancock’s musical explorations. As producer of 25 of Hancock’s albums on CBS/Columbia, Rubinson’s role and importance in the development of Hancock’s career cannot be understated.\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, Rubinson began his career in 1963 at the age of 21 with a short stint as Associate Producer at Capitol Records, and in 1964 produced the Obie-Award winning off-Broadway production of The Cradle Will Rock, which led to his joining Columbia Records. He worked as a staff producer at Columbia from 1964-69, signing and producing important West Coast acts such as The Chambers Brothers, Taj Mahal, Moby Grape, and Santana. Growing increasingly disenchanted with restrictive union rules as well as Columbia’s corporate environment and the label’s initial unwillingness to set up a studio facility in San Francisco, Rubinson relocated to the Bay Area in 1969 as a partner with Bill Graham in The Fillmore Corporation, bringing with him his longtime colleague, the legendary Columbia staff engineer Fred Catero.\n\nPartnered with Graham and attorney Brian Rohan, The Fillmore Corporation was designed to produce, record, engineer, promote, manage, publish and book artists all under one roof, but quickly dissolved in November 1971 after mounting discord among the partners. In January 1972, Rubinson formed his own production and management company, David Rubinson & Friends Inc./Adamsdad Management. By this time, Hancock and Rubinson were already busy working together.\n\nThe collaboration between Hancock and Rubinson had started in 1970, when Warner Brothers Records and Hancock’s then manager, Lee Weisel, were seeking ways to develop Hancock into a more commercially viable artist and assigned Rubinson to this task following his success with Warners’ group Malo. But instead of pushing Hancock to pursue the soul- and funk-infused direction of Fat Albert Rotunda and catering to a larger audience, Rubinson advocated the increasingly avant-garde route that Hancock’s sextet was beginning to travel. In fact, Rubinson had earlier developed a keen interest in experimental electronic music back in New York City, employing it extensively while producing the band, The United States of America, whose 1967 LP includes many early examples of the use of the Moog and custom built synthesizers, sampling and ring modulators in a textual and largely non-melodic manner. A more widely known and earlier example of Rubinson’s pioneering use of technology was The Chambers Brothers’ 1967 genre-shattering “Time Has Come Today,” which makes unique and extensive use of echo reinsertion and tape feedback effects. Warner Brothers, however, was not at all happy with Hancock’s and Rubinson’s first collaboration, Mwandishi nor with their brilliant second effort, Crossings, and dropped Hancock from their roster at the same time they dropped Labelle and Earth, Wind & Fire. Shortly thereafter, Hancock and Rubinson (now Hancock’s manager as well) clinched a deal with Columbia via Herbie’s long-time fan and Rubinson’s old friend Bruce Lundvall, paving the way for a remarkable string of productions for this label.\n\nWith masterful mixing skills at their disposal, David Rubinson and Fred Catero spearheaded the nascence of a new level of production in jazz. But the most profound impact the two had on Hancock’s music, and indeed on most of their jazz and fusion productions beginning with Mwandishi, was their COLLABORATION – working together with exceptional creativity and vision in experimenting with studio post-production. After tracking extensive live takes to capture the group’s intimacy and cohesiveness, the duo, with full participation by Hancock, set about sculpting the music by treating the studio, and mixing and post-production as fully realized creative tools, that is, as another instrument. The degree to which Hancock was involved in this process was unprecedented in jazz. While having always taken a keen interest in new technologies, it was only then that he delved deep into production techniques for the first time and conceived these as forms of composition, expression and art. This marked a radical shift from the old style when artists would record their albums quickly, often in one day, and with little involvement or voice in the post-production process.\n\nWith an ever-growing artist portfolio and the seminal successes of Hancock’s Head Hunters and the Pointer Sisters’ hits, including “Yes We Can Can,” among others, Rubinson was quickly expanding his business and his art in the mid-seventies. When CBS, who had opened a studio in San Francisco, decided to divest itself of this property, Rubinson took over the lease, and in 1978, established The Automatt. The best-equipped and the only automated studio in the Bay Area at the time, it was Rubinson’s creative base for many of Hancock’s albums, as well as albums by Patti LaBelle, Santana and numerous other artists (Rubinson produced the music and soundtrack LP for Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now there as well).\n\nThe music production part of the relationship between Herbie Hancock and David Rubinson, which spanned the entire 1970s, was disrupted suddenly when Rubinson, who was usually working 12 to 16 hour days, suffered a heart attack in February 1982 and had to undergo bypass surgery later that year. His illness precluded continuing his career in the studio, mandating that he turn full time to artist management, including Herbie. Two years later, Rubinson reluctantly closed The Automatt after the owner quadrupled his rent. Gratefully, we are left with his extraordinary legacy of working with great and innovative artists – none more notable than Herbie Hancock.\n\nSidebar: HERBIE HANCOCK – COMPOSER\n\nAs much as Herbie Hancock is known for both his piano virtuosity and highly influential style, his wider public influence has been realized in his compositions. Since 1962, when Mongo Santamaria recorded “Watermelon Man,” Herbie has nurtured, developed, and matured as a composer of music that is beyond genre or limitations of style. At once immediately recognizable and possessed with a flow, rhythmic and harmonic, and topped with a melody that can be remembered from the moment of discovery, the compositions of Herbie Hancock will take the listener on a journey into his life and experiences.\n\nIn simple terms, a musical composition can be qualified as having an organized melody with harmony and rhythm. Individuality, experience, curiosity, and virtuosity are what set apart the great composers.\n\nHerbie can create music that is from his mind alone, such as “Watermelon Man” (on Head Hunters and Flood), “Maiden Voyage” (on Dedication, Flood, V.S.O.P., Tempest In The Colosseum, An Evening With Herbie Hancock & Chick Corea In Concert, Butterfly w/ Kimiko Kasai, and Perfect Machine), and “Actual Proof” (on Thrust and Flood), and he can collaborate with other composers as demonstrated by “Chameleon” (on Head Hunters and Flood), “Come Running To Me” (on Sunlight), “Hang Up Your Hang Ups” (on Flood, Man-Child, and V.S.O.P), and “Paradise” (on Feets Don’t Fail Me Now). This is a rare flexibility for a musician so closely associated with jazz. The range of imagination held in the compositions in this box is staggering. From the very abstract “Hidden Shadows” (from Sextant) to the impressionistic “Sun Touch” (from Man-Child) to electronica (Sound-System) to classic jazz such as “Domo” (from V.S.O.P.: Live Under The Sky), there is no path that is discarded in the process of complete self-discovery as a composer.\n\nThere are the popular songs from Herbie’s catalog of music that are constantly being transformed by the various musical situations in which Herbie presents himself. “Maiden Voyage,” for example, has evolved not only as a form of improvisation, but also as varied musical coloration on his numerous tours. On this box set “Maiden Voyage” morphs from solo piano (Dedication) to duo (An Evening With Herbie Hancock & Chick Corea In Concert) to acoustic jazz quintet (the V.S.O.P. recordings, to electric funk (Flood) to techno (Perfect Machine) in ways that demonstrate the dual flexibility of performer and composer, with both disciplines evolving in parallel.\n\nAn undervalued aspect of Herbie’s compositions is the variety of orchestration that he employs. A true pioneer in the mixing of acoustic and electronic instruments, this merging of aesthetics gave his music a very personal sound, so unique that it was instantly recognizable. From the three-horn front line of the Mwandishi band, he still managed to incorporate that sound in his later music, most noticeably on Man-Child and Death Wish, both recorded in a similar time frame. With “Sun Touch” (Man-Child), Herbie added a small brass ensemble, employed alto and bass flutes (overdubbed), used the natural textural differences to give electronic jazz a warmth that could not be achieved solely by synthesizers, and brought the bass clarinet into the forefront. Death Wish is another overlooked recording, owing in large part to its chronic un-availability since its release in 1974. “Joanna’s Theme” is the singular track from the album that mixes the intense emotional drama required for film scoring with the signature Hancock harmonic twists and turns. Both of these recordings – Man-Child and Death Wish – are ultimate extensions of a singular train of thought.\n\nAs the 1970s moved towards broader formats for composers to incorporate into their creative potential, Herbie was able to explore the effects of common socialization on popular music. As he approached funk and dance music with the same ideas that he applied to jazz and film music, one can hear exploration and experimentation with the goal of being able to imprint your DNA onto everything you touched. That is why this continuity can be heard in songs such as “I Thought It Was You” (on Sunlight, Directstep, and Butterfly) which combines the newly explored multi-part dance music form with hard core jazz fusion. When Herbie collaborated with contemporary pop songwriters, the music took on a different direction, but the sound of the presentation remained totally in the world of Herbie, as exemplified by Lite Me Up.\n\nIn his work with Bill Laswell, Herbie did not focus on composition in the classic sense. In an abstract way, Laswell brought Herbie back to his Headhunters roots, with music created collectively by musicians on the spot and in tune with society. This return to his instinctive roots laid the groundwork for Herbie’s creative output from the ’90s onwards. He composed less music but rearranged his own music, spontaneously customizing it for the occasion. By the mid-nineties, he started to explore other music through the eyes of an arranger. It was a natural and logical evolution for such an accomplished musician yearning to reflect contemporary society.\n\nSidebar: THE PIANIST\n\nHerbie Hancock’s acoustic piano style is a reflection of his early influences, not only jazz, but classical. His love of Mozart, Chopin, Lizst, and Beethoven taught his hands to phrase fluidly (while educating his ear) and this translated well to jazz. Gravitating to the styles and ideas of Horace Silver, Bill Evans, and Wynton Kelly, it soon became apparent that he could take elements from each and create his own unique harmonic and rhythmic approach to the piano.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Herbie’s piano performances is his touch and sensitivity to the colors and overtones that a piano is able to offer. With Miles Davis, he used the overtones to his advantage and literally invented ‘accompaniment as orchestration.’ As he began to lead groups of his own, it was only natural for his style to become more assertive.\n\nWith the advent of the Fender Rhodes electric piano in the mid-sixties, the concept of keyboard touch began to evolve. More and more, the performer had to adjust to the various levels of resistance that electric keyboards provided when pressing a key. The increase of volume also changed the way pianists adjusted to electric keyboards, and in general, they became more aware of the percussive nature of the instruments.\n\nHerbie was one of the first pianists to develop a distinctive touch on both the acoustic piano and the Fender Rhodes. Being a mechanical engineer by nature, Herbie began to customize his instruments, giving him his signature Rhodes sound – that of a soft, silky sheen. If you listen to the sound of the Rhodes from Head Hunters to Man-Child to Sunlight, you will find the texture and color of the instrument remain consistent and very personal.\n\nWith the development of the Yamaha Electric Grand Piano, Herbie was able to translate the percussive approach that came from his performances on the Rhodes and Hohner Clavinet in such a way that he transformed his approach to acoustic jazz. On acoustic piano, the dialogue that Herbie and Tony Williams maintained on the V.S.O.P. recordings demonstrates this new approach, in that the role of the piano became equal in strength to the drums. Yet during his sojourn with V.S.O.P., where his playing leaned towards the aggressive, Herbie returned to a softer-edged approach with the acoustic solo piano recording, The Piano. And on his duo recording with Chick Corea, you can hear him combine and fully exploit both the lyrical and the percussive signatures of his technique.\n\nFor examples of this evolutionary process listen to the following examples:\n\nFender Rhodes:\n\nHead Hunters – “Chameleon”\n\nThrust – “Butterfly”\n\nMan-Child – “Sun-Touch”\n\nSunlight – “Come Running To Me”\n\nAcoustic Piano:\n\nThe Piano – “My Funny Valentine”\n\nAn Evening With Herbie Hancock & Chick Corea In Concert – “Someday My Prince Will Come”\n\nHerbie Hancock Trio – “Speak Like A Child”\n\nHerbie Hancock Trio With Ron Carter + Tony Williams – “That Old Black Magic”\n\nSidebar: THE SYNTHESIST\n\nAs the electric guitar defined the sixties as the ‘it’ instrument, by the end of the seventies, the synthesizer was honored with this distinction. No other group of instruments changed the way music was conceptualized, created, and perceived more than the various synthesizers that developed during the 16 years covered in this collection. From the simple, monophonic (one note at a time) ARP synthesizers that lent an exotic nature to Sextant (1973), to the multi-voice (many notes at one time), computer-based instruments such as the Fairlight used on Sound-System (1984), Herbie Hancock was involved artistically, scientifically, and musically in the advancement of the challenging and ever-changing world of synthesis.\n\nEarly synthesizers were created without keyboards and their sounds were imitative of nature or things totally beyond description. Moog created the Minimoog in the late sixties, and ARP followed with the 2600, which gave the performer more options to alter the sound and included a primitive sequencer used most effectively on “Rain Dance” from Sextant. Most importantly, the ARP laid out the basic design for polyphonic synthesizers. Herbie settled on the ARP and the Moog, and on Head Hunters (1974), one can hear both instruments used to their fullest possibilities. The bass line on “Chameleon” is performed on a polyphonic Minimoog (giving the bass two voices to fatten up the sound) and the strings and otherworldly colors are performed on the ARP 2600 and the ARP String Ensemble.\n\nUsing Head Hunters as a starting point, one can take a journey through the history of the synthesizer as used in popular music. The subtle mixing of synthetic instruments and acoustic instruments was never exemplified better than by “Sun Touch” from Man-Child (1976). By the time Sunlight was recorded (1977), the synthesizer could become the voice (as with the use of the Vocoder). Other instruments expanded the multi-purpose uses, in essence replacing winds, brass, and strings with names like Prophet Brass or Oberheim strings. The best examples of the Prophet and Oberheim are on Magic Windows (1981) and Lite Me Up (1982).\n\nOn the ground-breaking Future Shock (1983), the production took advantage of the recent developments in computer-based analog synthesizers such as the Fairlight. The Fairlight, as well as the Synclavier, were forerunners of the modern Keyboard Workstation. It was during this period that the drum machine (the Linn Drum) began to have prominence in production methodology and a large impact on the way music was created. Ultimately, digital synthesis was developed using a computer program to imitate what an analog synthesizer could do. PCM, developed by Sony, was the concept used to make Herbie’s early digital recordings such as the Japan-only V.S.O.P. live albums from the seventies. In 1983, MIDI (Music Instrument Digital Interface) allowed for different instruments to be synchronized. With digital synthesis and MIDI, you could reduce the amount of keyboards and increase the amount of sounds (with the sound module coming soon after). You can hear this sound module effect on Sound-System (1984) and Perfect Machine (1988).\n\nHerbie was able to absorb all of the technical (and sometimes problematic) movements in commercial synthesis and construct a personal approach, unique sound, and sense of color. He could find the right sound from a particular instrument for the perfect moment, creating demand in the marketplace for that instrument. The logical reason he used the synthesizer was to expand his orchestration potential on recordings with larger acoustic ensembles (Death Wish and Man Child). Herbie, as well, has always had a love of mechanical engineering and all things technical. If you put those two sides of the thought process together, you could end up with one word—curiosity.\n\nHerbieHancock.com is pleased to provide fans, musicians, and students around the world with an excellent resource: the complete Electronic Instrument Glossary which appeared in the liner notes of the Complete Columbia Albums Box Set (2013). In this extensively resourced feature, you can discover the exact models of the instruments which Herbie played on many of his iconic, classic albums.\n\nKeywords\n\nSynthesizers are electronic instruments used to both replicate and affect acoustic sounds, and create an audio landscape which does not exist outside the realm of electronics. Generally in the shape of a keyboard, the synthesizer is the easiest electronic instrument to transition to from a piano; it became the cornerstone of Herbie’s electronic experimentation and expansion.\n\nSynthesis – A combination of two or more entities that together form something new.\n\nAnalog Synthesizer – A synthesizer that uses analog circuits and analog computer techniques to generate sound electronically. Analog technology translates audio information into electronic pulses and sends the pulses to another device which translates them back into the original sound. The only drawback to this technology is that an analog signal has a limit to how much data it can transfer at one time.\n\nDigital Synthesizer – A synthesizer that uses digital signal processing techniques to make musical sounds. Digital technology translates audio information into binary code, a series of “1”s and “0”s, and sends this information to the other end where a device translates that code back into the original sound. Digital technology allows for the ability to send much more information in the same space when compared to analog.\n\nMonophonic – One note or single musical line occurring at a time. On a monophonic synthesizer only one key on the instrument may be played at a time.\n\nPolyphonic – Musical texture is formed by the interweaving of several musical lines at once. On a polyphonic synthesizer several keys may be played at the same time.\n\nSampler – A sampler is an electronic musical instrument which is similar to a synthesizer but instead of generating sounds it uses sounds that are loaded or recorded by the user. Once a sample is stored, the user can play back that sound using a keyboard, sequencer, or some other form of trigger. Being able to combine a sampled sound with the features offered by a synthesizer offers the musician full creative control.\n\nSequencer – An application or a device designed to play back musical notation. Early sequencers were known as “step sequencers” and would play back a pattern of notes in a rigid way without capturing the rhythms and expressiveness of the player. The modern sequencer is able to play back music exactly the way the musician plays it and capture the actual performance as is. A modern sequencer could also be used as a controller for multiple synthesizers so the musician does not need a separate keyboard controller for each one. Another term for a modern sequencer is “digital audio workstation.”\n\nMIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) – A protocol that enables electronic musical instruments to communicate, control, and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not transmit audio signals but rather the event messages such as pitch, intensity, volume, and tempo. This system allows instruments such as synthesizers, drum machines, computers, and samplers to exchange system data.\n\nROM (Read Only Memory) – A type of storage media used in computers and other electronic devices. The data in ROM cannot be modified easily and is used to hold information that does not need to be changed or updated. Some synthesizers did not have great memory capabilities built into them early on, and a ROM cartridge was a great way to include more sounds and could be inserted into the synthesizer just like a game cartridge would be inserted into the early video game systems.\n\nalphaSyntauri – A digital, polyphonic synthesizer released in 1980. It was the first electronic instrument to be based off a home computer and also resembled one. Herbie used this instrument on the 1983 album Future Shock for the tune “Rough.”\n\nARP 2600 – This analog, monophonic, patch-cable synthesizer was first released in the early 1970s and had the look of an old telephone patch board. This instrument was used on the 1973 album Sextant for the tune “Rain Dance.”\n\nARP Keyboard Model 3604 – Just as you would use your keyboard to operate your home computer, the ARP keyboard serves as the controller for the ARP 2600.\n\nARP Odyssey – ARP released this analog, duo-phonic, compact studio version of the 2600 which featured the synthesizer and keyboard together as one piece of equipment. Herbie played this instrument on his album Head Hunters in 1973.\n\nARP PE-IV String Ensemble – A polyphonic synthesizer designed as a multi-orchestral machine to reproduce the experience of listening to a full string orchestra. Hancock played this on his album Dedication in 1974.\n\nARP Soloist – ARP’s monophonic analog synthesizer featuring 30 preset sounds and designed to sit on top and accompany an organ. This instrument can be heard on several of Herbie’s albums including Head Hunters and Thrust.\n\nE-MU 4060 Digital Keyboard – Released in 1976, this polyphonic keyboard controller included the ability to sample sounds and also featured a built-in sequencer. It could serve as a controller because of its ability to act as a trigger for other synthesizers if connected to them. Herbie used this instrument on his 1984 album Sound-System.\n\nE-MU Polyphonic Keyboard – A digital polyphonic synthesizer with built-in sequencer and sampling capabilities first developed by E-MU Systems in the early 1970s. This instrument was used by Herbie on his 1978 album Sunlight, among many others.\n\nFairlight CMI – This digital sampling synthesizer, released in 1979, was the first digital sampler of its kind and offered complete synthesis and editing of sampled sounds. Herbie used this on the tune “Rockit” for the album Future Shock in 1983.\n\nFairlight Series II – Fairlight’s second version of the CMI included MIDI and other new technology as it was developed in the early 1980s.\n\nFairlight Series III – Fairlight’s third and final version of the CMI featured increased memory and double the polyphony of its earlier versions.\n\nKurzweil K-250 – First released in 1984, this sampler synthesizer was able to produce sound derived from sampled sounds without the need of a disk drive. It featured both acoustic and ROM sounds built in with twelve-voice polyphony. Herbie used this instrument on his album Perfect Machine in 1988.\n\nMaestro Universal Synthesizer System – This analog synthesizer was made for use with the guitar. It serves the instrument as an effects pedal would. It also works with the Maestro Sample and Hold Unit which then can sustain the desired effect until the next sound is triggered. Wah Wah Watson used these instruments on the 1975 album Man-Child.\n\nMemorymoog – This polyphonic synthesizer was first made in 1982 and offered greater preset storage capacity and better sound than its competitors. This instrument was used by Herbie on the tune “Future Shock” for the album of the same name.\n\nMicromoog – A monophonic analog synthesizer first made in the mid-1970s offered musicians a smaller more affordable synthesizer than what was otherwise available. It can be heard on the 1978 album Directstep.\n\nMinimoog – First released in 1970, this monophonic analog synthesizer offered musicians a synthesizer they could easily take on tour for live performance because of its size and durability. This instrument was also known for its ability to produce rich bass sounds and was often used as the ‘Minimoog Bass.’ You can hear it in the famous bass line that opens “Chameleon” (Head Hunters).\n\nMoog Source – A monophonic analog synthesizer that was the first synthesizer to offer patch memory storage. Herbie used this instrument on his 1982 album Lite Me Up.\n\nMultimoog – A monophonic analog synthesizer first made in 1978 and designed to be an updated version of the Micromoog and cheaper than the Minimoog. This instrument was used by Webster Lewis on the album Directstep.\n\nOberheim Eight Voice – This analog polyphonic synthesizer was first released in the late 1970s and featured eight monophonic synthesizers wired together into one unit. Herbie used this instrument on his 1980 album Monster.\n\nOberheim Matrix 12 – Released in 1984, this polyphonic analog synthesizer is known for producing one of the best sounds available. It has an ability to produce an almost limitless variety of sounds. This was used on Herbie’s 1988 album Perfect Machine.\n\nPolymoog – This fully polyphonic analog synthesizer was released in 1975 and featured eight preset sounds, and had the ability to edit those sounds in a variety of ways. Herbie used this instrument on his 1978 album Sunlight.\n\nProphet 5 – First made in 1978, this was one of the first fully programmable polyphonic analog synthesizers. It featured patch memory storage, which allowed it to save every knob setting for storing and recalling preferred sounds. Herbie used this on his 1981 album Magic Windows, among many others.\n\nProphet Pro-One – Produced in the early 1980s, this monophonic analog synthesizer was a more compact and cheaper version of the Prohpet 5. Michael Beinhorn used this instrument on the album Future Shock in 1983.\n\nRhodes Chroma – A rare polyphonic analog synthesizer released in 1982 which featured the ability to connect to a personal computer before MIDI had been invented. This was first used by Herbie on the album Future Shock in 1983 and several more albums after it.\n\nRoland Jupiter 8 – Roland’s first professional analog polyphonic synthesizer made in the early 1980s. It featured eight-voice polyphony and easy programming. Herbie used this on his 1982 album Lite Me Up.\n\nRoland MKS-80 Super Jupiter – Made in 1984, this synthesizer is a refined Jupiter 8 in a standalone module. It had no keyboard connected to it, and any instrument run through this synthesizer was done so using external cables. It was used by Herbie on his 1988 album Perfect Machine.\n\nSennheiser Vocoder VSM201 – This synthesizer was designed specifically to be used with the voice via a microphone. It has the look of a standard PA unit with the ability to use controls normally found on a keyboard synthesizer with the human voice to alter the sound. Herbie first used the Vocoder for his vocals on his 1978 Sunlight album.\n\nSynclavier Digital – First made in 1979, this digital polyphonic sampling synthesizer was known as the top of the line and could cost as much as $200,000. It featured a full-size weighted keyboard with sixty-four note polyphony. Herbie first used this instrument on his 1982 album Lite Me Up.\n\nYamaha CE-20 – A digital synthesizer released in 1982 that featured fourteen preset monophonic sounds and six preset polyphonic sounds. This was used by Herbie on the tune “Earth Beat” for his 1983 album Future Shock.\n\nYamaha CP-30 – This electronic piano/synthesizer offers a 76-key keyboard and offers over 250 preset sounds to work with. You can hear this instrument being used on Hancock’s 1978 album Sunlight.\n\nYamaha CS-40 – Released in the late 1970s, this analog synthesizer could be played as a two-note duo-phonic instrument or be used in ‘unison’ mode which allowed for monophonic use. Webster Lewis used this instrument on the 1979 album Kimiko Kasai With Herbie Hancock: Butterfly.\n\nYamaha CS-80 – A polyphonic analog synthesizer released in 1977 that featured eight-voice polyphony and a basic memory system to remember the musician’s settings for each sound. Herbie used this instrument on his 1978 album Directstep.\n\nYamaha DX-7 – First made in 1983, this was the first commercially successful polyphonic digital synthesizer and was known for having greater clarity and quality of sound than the analog versions that came before it. This instrument was first used by Herbie on his 1984 album Sound-System.\n\nYamaha DZ7llFD – This updated version of the DX-7 held 64 voices in internal memory and another 64 voices in a RAM/ROM cartridge that could be accessed. In dual mode, one could layer these voices in different combinations and create a variety of sounds not available on the standard DX-7. This was used by Herbie on his 1988 album Perfect Machine.\n\nYamaha DX-1 Digital – This polyphonic digital synthesizer was the equivalent of two DX-7s put together and was the biggest and most expensive synthesizer in the DX line. Herbie used this on his 1984 album Herbie Hancock And Foday Musa Suso: Village Life.\n\nYamaha GS-1 – Yamaha’s first digital polyphonic synthesizer, released in 1981, included features such as velocity sensitivity and three band equalizer. This was used by Herbie on the tune “Earth Beat” for his 1983 album Future Shock.\n\nYamaha TX-816 – A digital synthesizer that takes its form as a rack unit simulates having eight DX-7s in one. This allows a musician to store and carry as many sounds as they like without needing several instruments to create them. It also features eight audio outputs and is compatible with all other DX synthesizers. Herbie used this on his 1988 album Perfect Machine.\n\nElectric Pianos\n\nAn electric piano produces sound mechanically, which is then turned into electronic signals using a pickup. Due to the mechanical aspect, the electric piano is an electro-mechanical instrument, unlike a synthesizer which is an electric instrument. The original sound is produced by pressing a key, which activates a hammer and then strikes a string, metal reed, or tuning fork, depending on the model. That sound is then amplified. The Wurlitzer and Rhodes electric pianos are the most popular examples. Herbie was first introduced to the instrument by Miles Davis and continued to use it on many of his own albums, often as his primary soloing instrument. He used it on some 17 albums in this boxed set during the years 1973-1981.\n\nYamaha Electric Grand Piano – First produced in the 1970s, the sound of these pianos is produced using hammer and strings in much the same manner as a piano with the addition of pickups under the strings (like the technology used to amplify a guitar). Herbie used this instrument on his 1976 album V.S.O.P.\n\nFender Rhodes Electric Piano – This electro-mechanical piano uses a hammer striking a tuning fork to create its unique sound. Fender released several models of the Rhodes piano, which ranged from having 61-73 keys. This instrument was used by Herbie on the 1973 album Sextant.\n\nRhodes 88 Suitcase Piano – An 88-key Fender Rhodes Electric Piano with updates, including plastic hammers to reduce its weight, built-in 100W stereo amplifier and ¼” outputs, allowing this instrument to be plugged directly into a mixing console. Herbie played the Suitcase Piano on his 1980 album Monster.\n\nHohner D6 Clavinet – Released in the 1970s, this amplified clavichord produced its sound using hammer striking strings. The clavichord is a stringed keyboard instrument used as early in history as the Middle Ages. Herbie used this instrument on his 1973 album Sextant.\n\nDrum Machines/Drum Pads\n\nAn electronic musical instrument designed to imitate the sound of drums and other percussion instruments. Most drum machines are sequencers that combine some features of a synthesizer to fully control the desired percussion sounds. A drum machine can look like anything from an electronic drum set used with sticks to a small square unit with pads or knobs to be controlled by hand. Herbie and his band mates used this instrument on various albums to create more rhythmic texture in the music without another drummer.\n\nLinn LM-1 – This was the first drum machine to use digital samples of real drums and also had the ability to be programmed. This was used by Herbie on his 1980 album Monster.\n\nLinn Drum – This drum machine released in the early 1980s featured 15 drum sounds sampled from real drums and a sequencer. It was the successor to the LM-1. Herbie used this instrument on his 1981 album Magic Windows.\n\nOberheim DMX – A programmable, digital drum machine released in 1981 that featured 24 individual drum sounds and eight-sound polyphony. Michael Beinhorn used this instrument on the 1983 album Future Shock.\n\nRoland CR-78 – A drum machine released in 1978 featuring analog sounds with digital controls and 34 preset rhythms. This instrument was used by Herbie on his 1980 album Monster.\n\nSynare Drum – The name Synare stands for synthetic snare. This drum pad allowed the user to drum rhythms onto it and then adjust the sound and tempo of those rhythms using knobs. Michael Beinhorn plays this instrument on the tune “Rockit” for the 1983 album Future Shock.\n\nYamaha RX11 Digital Drum Machine – Released in the early 1980s, this programmable drum machine featured 29 real drum samples and 12 audio outputs. Herbie used this instrument on his 1984 album Herbie Hancock And Foday Musa Suso: Village Life.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe following are instruments and electronic devices that do not fit into the other categories and were used by Herbie and his band mates.\n\nClavitar – Released in 1978, this keytar combines the keyboard and guitar into one unique instrument. The instrument is played like a keyboard but shaped like a guitar and straps around the neck allowing the keyboard player to roam freely on stage. Herbie plays the Clavitar on his 1980 album Monster.\n\nPhase Shifter – This is an effects unit that can alter sound using certain techniques to change the sound waves. While these effects units were originally large boxes with knobs and buttons, today they are most often small pedals used by guitar players. Herbie used the Country Man Phase Shifter on his 1976 album V.S.O.P.\n\nLyricon – This is an electronic wind instrument resembling the look of a soprano saxophone or an alto clarinet. The instrument has sensors on the mouth piece which are able to recognize lip pressure and wind pressure, as well as buttons to transpose the instrument to a different key and control the octave range. Bennie Maupin plays the Lyricon on the 1976 album Secrets.\n\nMaestro Echoplex – A tape delay effect first released in the early 1960s. This device allows a guitar or keyboard player to record themselves and play back that recording in real time, and then play another line on top of the recorded line. This allows one player to create layers of music and ideas. Herbie used this device on his 1973 album Sextant.\n\nMellotron – This electro-mechanical polyphonic keyboard, released in the 1960s, is in a class all its own. This instrument uses the technology of a sampler and a piano and looks like an organ. A key pressed causes this instrument to read a piece of magnetic audio tape and play back a preset sample lasting eight seconds. This instrument is played by Herbie on the tune “Hidden Shadows” for the 1973 album Sextant.\n\nShure Reverberation Mixer – This is a mixer you would see with any standard PA system. It allows for multiple instruments or microphones to be plugged into the unit, and the ability to control reverb, volume and more in the sound produced. Herbie used this mixer on his 1974 album Dedication.\n\nSteiner EVI – An electronic valve trumpet using a similar concept to the Lyricon in that the mouth piece could measure the amount of air pressure being used, and a button near the thumb controlled the octave. This instrument was played by Herbie on his 1980 album Monster.\n\nVoice Bag – The voice bag or talk box is a device that makes a synthesizer talk. The musician sends a note from their instrument into the voice bag. The voice bag then sends that same note through a plastic tube into the musician’s mouth. Using their mouth, throat, and larynx, the musician shapes that sound to make the sound talk. This instrument was used by Wah Wah Watson on the 1975 album Man-Child.\n\nWLM Organ – These electric organs were first produced in the early 1970s in Finland. The sound produced by these organs is similar to a Hammond, but is cleaner. Herbie plays this organ on his 1980 album Monster.\n\n– 2013 Sony Box Set Liner Notes\n\nThe pianist, composer and music ambassador Herbie Hancock is working on new music with a new band, and he’s about to present the first taste of it in live performance.\n\nNext Thursday, Aug. 11, Hancock brings a new lineup to Prospect Park in Brooklyn, N.Y., for an outdoor concert. (He’s to be joined by Terrace Martin on saxophone and keyboards, Lionel Loueke on guitar, James Genus on bass and Trevor Lawrence Jr. on drums.) Hancock says he expects to play some ideas that he’s been working on for a new record, which he’s hoping to release next year. NPR Music and WBGO will record and film the show for a later broadcast on Jazz Night In America.\n\nIn advance of that concert, Simon Rentner, who hosts a program called The Checkout on WBGO, sat down to interview Hancock. Their conversation touched upon the connection between Flying Lotus and Miles Davis, some special guests on the forthcoming album and what he’s doing with NASA. Here’s an excerpted transcript of their conversation, which you can hear in full via WBGO. Rentner started by playing an excerpt of an interview with Flying Lotus.\n\nThat brought me back to the opening passage of your memoir, Possibilities, Herbie, where you were in concert with the Miles Davis Quintet in the mid-’60s, where you played the wrong notes. But Miles Davis gave you a nod of confidence nevertheless.\n\nThat was an amazing event. I’ll never forget that. Because that was the hottest night of the whole European tour. The band was smokin’ and we had the audience in the palm of our hands. And at the peak of the evening, I played this chord that was really completely wrong, right? And Miles just took a breath and then he played some notes, and it made my chord right — it made it fit into the flow of things. And it took me many years to find that, what had actually happened.\n\nAnd the truth of the matter is I realized, finally, that Miles didn’t judge my chord. Like, no judgment whatsoever. He just heard it as something that happened, and dealt with it, and found these notes that worked. And that’s a very important lesson that I’ve learned and applied — not only to music, but I apply it to life.\n\nBut it seems like you’re applying it even to this Flying Lotus session, where you guys are on the edge, right?\n\nI had no idea actually what we were doing at the time, and when I first went over to his house to record something, I didn’t have any preconceived idea. And I know that a lot of things have changed, of course, since the older days of recording, but the way I was used to recording, in a recording studio and preparing everything in advance — I knew, now, things have changed a lot with young people since then. And so, I wanted to find out how he records. And I learned a lot actually, working with Steve Ellison, Flying Lotus. And, I really enjoyed it, you know.\n\nToward the latter part of those essentially five-and-a-half years with Miles [Davis], how Miles recorded began to change. And it relates very much to how young people often record today.\n\nIt was funny because I heard this drum track that he had just — he didn’t say anything, he just started playing it from his computer. And, then he said, “You think you might be able to put something on [this track]?” I said, “Sure.” So I started looking for something to do that would relate to what would essentially sound like a drum solo. And I found some phrases that kind of worked. And he put the whole thing on a loop, but after a few minutes, I began to notice that something I played was on a loop. I just kept going, and coming up with some other ideas, and he was recording them, and then certain things he would kind of snatch. In that loop. And then later on he would slice and dice and put it all together and made it part of the track called “Tesla.”\n\nReally, the new ingredient [in your new band] — I just had him on my show — was Terrace Martin, the saxophonist, who’s a part of [Flying Lotus’] posse.\n\nYeah, Terrace and I have been working together almost every day on different things, for the record. And he’s coming to Brooklyn for the concert.\n\nAnd when’s this record coming out?\n\nI don’t know [laughing]. I’m shooting for the spring, but I’m not putting a time limit on it. It’s going to come out when it’s ready.\n\nSo Terrace Martin and I agreed in our interview together that every time you do drop a new project, it is kind of an event, at least in the jazz music community. Everybody perks up and wants to listen to it right away. So what kinds of things are you messing around with, technologically speaking? Flying Lotus also said that you’re incessantly curious about what’s going on today. So what are you doing new with this project?\n\nWell, I’m working with a lot of young people, many of them are friends of Flying Lotus and Terrace Martin. Like Thundercat, the bassist. And also Robert Glasper, who—\n\nWho’s on the bill with you at Prospect Park.\n\nRight, exactly, great, he’s an amazing musician. And … well, Terrace plays not only alto saxophone, he also plays keyboards and he also works with the vocoder. He also plays drums but I don’t know if he’s going to play drums on the record. Trevor Lawrence, is one of the drummers that I’ve been working with on this record, Vinnie Colaiuta is another one, Jamire Williams — he’s also been working on some of the tracks.\n\nAnd all of these guys are just a joy to be around.\n\nBut I also have, from England, Jacob Collier. He came over.\n\nHe was recently in our studio. He played the [Hammond] C-3 organ for the very first time.\n\nHe did! What a great talent that guy is. Amazing.\n\nSo he’s [helped to] invent this software at MIT where he’s able to make six- or 12-part harmony in real time. Are you messing with that as well?\n\nHe brought it over and he was doing that when he was here, as well as playing keyboards. We haven’t finalized anything, but that’s a prototype that he’s still working on. And yeah, it’s a lot of fun.\n\nAlso in this Flying Lotus interview, he told me that you were sending music ideas to different planets, and to space. Can you elaborate on that?\n\n[Laughing] He’s talking about the Juno project. It’s something I’m doing with NASA and Jet Propulsion Lab[oratory]. You know, JPL. I don’t know if you heard about, but I’m sure many of your listeners have heard about the spacecraft that was sent from here to the planet Jupiter, that is now orbiting Jupiter. It’s going to make 33 orbits and then it’s going to make a third of an orbit as it crashes into the planet, but meanwhile it’s sending information in the form of tones back to the earth, and a lot of what is involved has to do with overtones, and the overtone series, with a lot of their scientific data.
