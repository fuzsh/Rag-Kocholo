        "text": "- E - (Ea - Ell) -\n\nIntroductory note:\n\nThe primary focus of the biographical register is musical personnel first active before the end of 1860, with a secondary focus on members of their circles - families, pupils, colleagues, and other important contacts - first active after 1860.\n\nBeyond that, there has been no systematic attempt to deal with musical personnel first active after 1860, and the coverage is selective.\n\nMajor upgrades of the contents of this page were completed in December 2019 and April 2024, and newly added documentation (including genealogical data) and Trove tagging now brings the page content up to the end of 1860 close to completion.\n\nOnly such biographical information as can be confirmed from standard national databases or original documentation presented is entered at the head of each person entry in this page. Where no certain evidence of a person's birth year has yet been identified, the assumption is that we do not and cannot yet know with sufficient certainty to propose one. Years of birth or death, and sometimes also names and spellings of names, thus sourced and presented here, will often differ more or less substantially from those given (but often merely hazarded) in standard Australian and international bibliographic and biographical records.\n\nThe texts given in gold aim for the most part to be diplomatic transcriptions, wherever practical retaining unaltered the original orthography, and spellings and mis-spellings, of the printed or manuscript sources. Occasionally, however, some spellings are silently corrected (for instance, of unusual music titles and composers, to assist identification), and some orthography, punctuation and paragraphing, and very occasionally also syntax, editorially altered or standardised in the interests of consistency, clarity, and readability.\n\nEADES, Richard (Richard EADES; Dr. EADES)\n\nAmateur musician, vocalist, pianist, surgeon, public lecturer, mayor of Melbourne\n\nBorn Dublin, Ireland, 16 August 1809; baptised St. Audoen, Dublin, 22 August 1809; son of William George EADES and Mary Ann CRANWELL (CRANWILL)\n\nMarried [1] Sarah Christina BEERE (d. 1852), St. Peter, Dublin, Ireland, 9 November 1843\n\nArrived Adelaide, SA, 23 October 1848 (surgeon superintendent per Roman Emperor, from Plymouth)\n\nArrived Melbourne, VIC, 15 February 1852 (per Reliance, from Adelaide, 5 February)\n\nMarried [2] Charlotte BEERE (Mrs. McKEE); St. Peter, Melbourne, 10 March 1857\n\nDied Prahran, VIC, 12 October 1867, aged \"58\"\n\nhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/search?l-publictag=Richard+Eades+1809-1867 (TROVE tagged by Australharmony)\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.party-1463756 (NLA persistent identifier)\n\nhttps://sydney.edu.au/paradisec/australharmony/register-E-1.php#EADES-Richard (shareable link to this entry)\n\nDocumentation:\n\nBaptisms, the year 1809, St. Audoen (CoI), Dublin; 2 registers; Irish genealogy\n\nhttps://churchrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details/942b9e0032715\n\nhttps://churchrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/display-pdf.jsp?pdfName=d-116-1-2-006 (DIGITISED)\n\nhttps://churchrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/display-pdf.jsp?pdfName=d-116-1-3-001 (DIGITISED)\n\nNo. 4 / Richard Son of Wm.

Dr. Eades delivered a highly edifying and entertaining lecture on the construction of the ear, and gave the subject, although apparently one of little interest to the non-professionals, a most happy and agreeable turn, by the omission of all technical jargon, which brought it within the easy reach of the most limited capacity . . . The silvery intonation and easy delivery of Dr. Eades added materially to the attractions of the lecture, and at its conclusion, the only regret that seemed to prevail was, that it ended so soon.

Dr. Eades, whose frequent discourses have so much obliged the committee and benefited the community, consented at a short notice to deliver, previously to leaving the colony, a lecture on \"Respiration\" . . . Dr. Eades professes, in an eminent degree, that \"conversational facility,\" which Byron so much admired, and which is, after all, the best medium of instruction, as it undoubtedly is best adapted to assist the reflective faculty and secure attention. In the musical entertainment that followed, Mr. F. S. Dutton, who has invariably exerted himself to serve the Institute, of which he is a Vice-President, joined Mrs. Murray, Master White, and the professionals, in eking out a very satisfactory evening's instruction and amusement.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Richard Baxter White (musician)\n\n\"SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.

The attendance was not so crowded as might have been expected, but the one hundred and fifty persons present were quite as many as could assemble with convenience and comfort . . . The chair was taken at half past seven o'clock by Dr. Eades, whose good nature and genuine bonhommie contributed much to the gaiety of the evening . . . the Chairman said that he hoped all present had come to enjoy themselves, and that every one was prepared to do his beat for the general amusement. Therefore, considering example better than precept, he would, though he neither sang nor played, at least make an attempt. He accordingly sat down at the pianoforte and enlivened the company with a pretty song, which was received with considerable applause . . . The evening passed off pleasantly enough, varied by occasional short addresses . . . varied by music, scientific experiments, conversation, promenade, and a recitation. The charm of these meetings is their sociality. A concert or a lecture must be very good in order to prevent a seme of weariness from sitting a couple of hours in the same position, a recognition of one's friends is limited to a laconic smile or nod of the head; but at these conversaziones one can be here, there, and every-where, in a minute, exchanging greetings with people whom one sees no where else, and keeping up an excitement and a conviviality highly gratifying and beneficial. We trust these meetings, for the future, now that the ice is broken, will be at least monthly; and that care will always be taken, without engaging professional musicians, to secure a liberal supply of vocal and instrumental music, with a comic song or two. It is but due to Mr. Gibbons to say that we are indebted to him mainly for the entertainment of last evening. There is a Concert Committee, a Lecture Committee, &c.; why should there not be a Conversazione Committee?\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Mechanics' Institution (Melbourne association and venue)\n\n1857, marriages solemnized in the district of St. Peter's Melbourne; register 1856-57; St. Peter's Eastern Hill\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com.au/imageviewer/collections/9732/images/43331_1831109387_0166-00014?pId=10530 (PAYWALL)\n\n1806 / 806 / [10 March 1857] at St. Peter's Church / Richard Eades / Widower 12th Sep'br 1852 / 4 living children by first marriage 2 dead / [born] Dublin / Physician / 47 / Melbourne / [son of] William George Eades, Merchant [and] Mary Ann Cranwill\n\nCharlotte McKee / Widow June 7th 1855 / [no children by previous marriage] / [born] Dublin / 30 / Melbourne / [daughter of] Richard Beere, Merchant [and] Ellen Byrne . . .\n\n\"DEATHS\", The Argus (14 October 1867), 4\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5780502\n\nEADES. - On the 12th inst., at his residence, High-street, Prahran, Richard Eades, M.A., M.B., aged fifty-eight years.\n\nSee also obituaries, \"DEATH OF DR.

The frigates were bound from South America to Cadiz. The account they gave of themselves was, that they had been prisoners of war in Buenos Ayres, in consequence of being on board the Lady Shore transport, bound for Botany Bay, in which a mutiny took place, and the Captain and Officers murdered, the mutineers carried the ship into Montevideo; and that they had been released by the order of the Government of Spain, and were to landed at Cadiz, and conveyed to England at the expence of that Government. This account was transmitted the Secretary of State's Office, with their names, viz. John Brown, Edward Eagle, Francis Ward, and Launcelot Knowles. An information being sent that they were arrived in the River, Sir R. Ford sent for them last Monday. They have since undergone several examinations, and the account they have given is follows: Edward Eagle said, was drummer in the New South Wales Corps; that he was on board the Lady Shore when the mutiny took place, that had no share in it; he was then only fourteen years of age; and that since that time he had chiefly been in prison in Buenos Ayres, in South America . . .\n\nThe mutineers were eleven Frenchmen and seven Irishmen, soldiers in the [New] South Wales Corps . . .\n\nThey sailed in the month of August 1797, from Falmouth for Botany Bay . . .\n\nthree remain in custody; one of them, that was a drummer, is to go for a soldier.\n\nDescription book, New South Wales Corps; Australian Joint Copying Project, UK National Archives, WO25/1302\n\nhttps://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-1303796244 (DIGITISED)\n\n[Private] Eagles Edw. / [enlisted] 7 Oct'r 1796 / London / [arrived] Duke of Portland / July 1807 / [age] 28 years 7 months / [born] Mortlake / Surrey [England] . . .\n\nBibliography and resources:\n\nPamela Statham (ed.), A colonial regiment: new sources relating to the New South Wales Corps 1789-1810 ([Canberra]: P.

Our entertainment which came off on the 24th ultimo combined both advantages, and therefore every one was pleased.

Mr. Eagleton read the opening address and assisted at the piano during the evening. The evening was enlivened by several amateur singers . . .

As Mr. Eagleton is well known, not only for his literary attainments, but also for artistic and musical abilities, we may congratulate the residents of that locality as having secured the services of a gentleman so well qualified for the onerous and trustworthy position he has been selected to fulfil.\n\n\"OLD IDENTITIES OF BEECHWORTH.

My father was senior partner in the firm of Eagleton and Glover, tailors and haberdashers (whatever that may mean); his Christian name was John, and he was married to Harriet Selby . . . My three brothers went to a boarding school near Dover, on the coast of Kent, I being kept at home on account of my delicate health. It was there that I developed some ability in drawing and music, which stood me in good stead in after life . . .\n\n\"OLD IDENTITIES OF BEECHWORTH . . .

This was the largest mass of gold yet found in Victoria, and the excitement, which was great enough before, now rose to fever heat. Every day I could see expeditions passing along the street, bound for Ballarat, in the hope of unearthing equally large masses of gold. The prevalent excitement was embodied in a song at one of the music halls, an adaptation of a popular song in London, with the refrain \"That licks me,\" and one verse was as follows: -\n\n\"Where they found that great big nugget,\n\nThat licks me;\n\nWhy wasn't it my fate to hug it,\n\nThat licks me.\n\nI shall be off to Ballarat now\n\nAnd at digging have a slap now,\n\nBut if I get the half of that now,\n\nThat'll lick me\" . . .\n\n\"MR. BENJAMIN EAGLETON\", Ovens and Murray Advertiser (15 September 1915), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article90771330\n\nThe ranks of the old pioneers of this district suffered another depletion on Monday last through the death of Mr. Benjamin Eagleton, a resident of Beechworth and its immediate neighbourhood for 56 years. His death was not unexpected as for the past two years his health had been fading, and he suffered from fainting fits. It was in one of these that he fell and smashed his right thumb. The death of his wife a few weeks ago affected him considerably, and although the members of his family did all that was possible to comfort him, he passed peacefully away about noon on Monday at the residence of his daughter, Mrs. Sidney Turner, in Short-street, at the ripe old age of 82 years and six months.\n\nThe late Mr. Eagleton was born in the ancient Borough of Southwark, a southern suburb of the City of London on 12th March 1833. His father was the senior partner in the firm of Eagleton and Glover, tailors and haberdashers. He was educated at a private school in Southwark, where he developed some ability in drawing and music, which stood him in good stead in after years. As a lad he was an omnivorous reader, and being possessed of a retentive memory he was enabled to turn the information thus gathered to good account. Mr. Eagleton commenced life as a junior clerk in a merchant's office in Mark Lane, where he remained for two years. In August 1852, attracted by the reports of the marvellous gold discoveries in Australia, he set sail for the new Eldorado in the sailing ship Eliza. After a voyage of four months he landed in Melbourne in December of the same year and shortly after obtained employment in an ironmongers store at high wages. The \"gold fever\" was on him, however, and in January, 1853, he set out in company with his brother for the Ballarat diggings where he had his first experience of gold mining. He worked on this field for about 12 months, and then returned to the city. In 1855 the Maryborough gold field attracted him, and he was present there during the \"Tipperary Riots.\" Creswick, Beaufort and Ararat fields were visited in turn, and in 1859 Mr. Eagleton came on to the Ovens, and during that year was on the Indigo gold field. In 1860 he went to Yackandandah, where he and his brother engaged in hawking drapery, etc., and subsequently carried newspapers from Beechworth to Yackandandah, a very profitable undertaking in those days. At about this time he became connected in a semi-official capacity with the \"Ovens and Murray Advertiser,\" the connection lasting continuously until a few years ago. In December, 1866, Mr. Eagleton was married at Yackandandah to Miss Agnes Rickard, and they started storekeeping at Bruarong - or Sutton as it was then known. He then entered the service of the Education Department, and in 1867 opened a school at Bruarong. He conducted this for 10 years, and was then transferred to Upper Indigo, where he remained for seven years. His next change was to Jamieson, in the Mansfield district, then to Tea Garden Creek, and after 18 months at that school he was placed in charge of the Black Springs - or Melbourne-road - School. Having reached the age of 60, he retired from the service after 27 years continuous employment, and then took up journalistic work, and as a contributor to this journal under the pen name of \"Billy Nutts\" he was well-known throughout the whole of the North-Eastern district. Subsequently he became editor of the \"Ovens and Murray Advertiser.\"\n\nThe late Mr. Eagleton could recount many amusing incidents of the early days, and about five years ago he published his reminiscences in our columns. He was also a very capable piano player, and his services were in great request at dances, socials, etc. A thoughtful, studious man, Mr. Eagleton kept himself well versed in current topics. He was a typical Bohemian, of most genial kindly temperament, with a good fund of humour, which made him always acceptable as a companion to his numerous friends. Always optimistic, he battled through his full share of life's worries without impairment of his nice disposition, and when his fortunes were at a low ebb a timely legacy of considerable amount put an end to his financial anxieties. He was at all times anxious to do a good turn to those deserving it, and always had a kindly thought for those in distressed circumstances. He was made an hon. life governor of the Ovens Benevolent Asylum for his thoughtfulness of the inmates of that institution. He leaves a grown-up family of three sons, Frederick, Charles and Albert, and two daughters, Mrs. W. Dugan and Mrs. S. Turner, to mourn their loss. His last mortal remains are to be laid to rest in the Beechworth Cemetery this (Wednesday) afternoon at 4 o'clock.\n\nEAMES, Miss (Miss EAMES)\n\nMusician, teacher of the pianoforte\n\nActive Geelong, VIC, 1854\n\nhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/search?l-publictag=Miss+Eames+pianoforte+teacher (TROVE tagged by Australharmony)\n\nhttps://sydney.edu.au/paradisec/australharmony/register-E-1.php#EAMES-Miss (shareable link to this entry)\n\nDocumentation:\n\n[Advertisement], Geelong Advertiser and Intelligencer [VIC] (23 September 1854), 5\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91860706\n\nPIANOFORTE.- Miss EAMES will be happy to give private lessons at her own residence or elsewhere.

Madame Vitelli was received with an applause which was not decreased by the flying reports respecting her arrival which have been current throughout the week. Her appearance and style of singing made a great impression on her audience. Mrs. Turner and Miss Earle sang some very charming ballads, and the orchestra, led by M. Fleury, played excellently well. The overture to \"Fra Diavolo\" and the \"Exhibition Quadrille\" were performed with an effect, we are satisfied, has never before been produced on Ballarat.\n\n\"MONTEZUMA PROMENADE CONCERTS\", The Star (6 October 1858), 2\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66050489\n\nIt is a matter of regret that so much exertion to provide really good music for the Ballarat public should meet with so small a success. Last evening it was impossible for any one in any degree competent to judge, to withhold the meed of high approbation which the performances deserved. The orchestra play with rare excellence of instrumentation, and M. Fleury's leadership, Messrs. King and Palin's solos on the clarionet and piccolo, and M. Labalestrier's solos on the cornet, were greeted with loud and deserved applause. Madame Vitelli has vastly improved since her last visit to Ballarat, and her rendering of the charming ballads committed to her care repeatedly called for the applause so well merited. Miss Earle sang with great taste and expression. We trust these concerts, as they become better known, will receive the support they so well deserve.\n\nEARL, John (John EARL; Mr. EARL; EARLE)\n\nDancing master, farmer, innkeeper, racing horse owner\n\nBorn Patterdale, Westmorland, England, c. 1790 (c. 1793)\n\nMarried Ann MOUNSEY (Mrs. HOLMES; Mrs. WILSON) (1787-1875), Barton, near Penrith, Cumbria, England, 30 April 1822 (separated from 1840)\n\nArrived Sydney, NSW, 18 June 1823 (per Thalia, from England)\n\nDeparted Sydney, NSW, 1840 (for England)\n\nDied Colby, Westmorland, England, 24 October 1876, aged \"86\" (buried Patterdale)\n\nhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/search?l-publictag=John+Earl+c1790-1876 (TROVE tagged by Australharmony)\n\nhttps://sydney.edu.au/paradisec/australharmony/register-E-1.php#EARL-John (shareable link to this entry)\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Dorothea Earl Richards (daughter, vocalist, actor); Henry Augustus Richards (son-in-law, musician, violinist)\n\nSummary:\n\nOn 30 April 1822, near Penrith, in Westmoreland (Cumbria), John Earl, dancing master, married the twice widowed, Mrs. Ann Wilson (born MOUNSEY; previously Mrs. Holmes). Three months later, on 10 August, he wrote from Patterdale, Ullswater, to London seeking consideration for a land grant in New South Wales, stating that he was raised on a farm, had a perfect understanding of the management of sheep, and capital of £500, and enclosed three references. His application was evidently successful, and he and his wife's five children arrived in Sydney on the Thalia in June 1823. On 5 July 1823 he was allocated 1500 acres, on Patrick's Plains, near what is now Singleton, and arrived there in the spring. Earl named his property \"Glenridding\" (after the Cumbrian lake village).\n\nThe 1828 Census listed John Earl, 38 years, innkeeper at Patrick Plains; Ann Earl, 40; and their daughter Dorothy Earl, aged 5 years; also four of Ann's other children, surname Holmes, Mary Ann, 18, Agnes, 13, Elizabeth, 12 years, and James, 14.\n\nIn June 1830, he was in Sydney, attempting to let his farm, and advertising a return to his former profession as a dancing master. There is no record of his success or otherwise in Sydney, and he appears to have been back at Patrick's Plains for most of the 1830s.\n\nHaving seen his only daughter, Dorothea Earl, married to Henry Augustus Richards in May 1840, Earl sold up his property, and returned to England, leaving money for his wife, Ann, to follow him later. She, however, seems to have decided to remain in Australia with her children. She died near Maitland, on 14 July 1875, aged 86.\n\nJohn Earl returned to his native Westmorland, settling at Colby, where he fathered at least eight more children by his housekeeper, Mary Pattinson. He died at Colby in 1876, but was buried at Patterdale.\n\nWith thanks for information used above, originally posted online from the Family History Society of Singleton newsletter\n\nhttp://www.xroyvision.com.au/singleton/singtext/53.html\n\nDocumentation:\n\n[News], Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle [England] (11 March 1815), 3\n\nhttps://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002309/18151007/027/0003 (PAYWALL)\n\nMr. Earl held his ball at the Cross Keys Inn, Burton-in-Kendal, on Friday, the 3d inst., which was attended by most of the respectable families in the neighbourhood, who were pleased to express themselves in the highest terms, their approbation of the uniform regularity with which his pupils went through a variety of new and fashionable dances; at the same time great praise is due to Mr. E. for his attention to the morals of those pupils under his tuition.\n\n[Advertisement], Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle (29 July 1815), 2\n\nhttps://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002309/18150729/021/0002 (PAYWALL)\n\nMR.

The production [on 6 July] of so magnificent a work on the stage would seem to be surrounded by difficulties almost insurmountable; yet we say with perfect sincerity that the company at the Theatre Royal have, or, rather will have, upon a second representation, achieved a most remarkable success. The pressure on our space hardly enables us to do justice to what we were impressed, with hardly a single exception, was a really meritorious undertaking . . . The tempest at the opening is equal to anything of the kind we remember in London, and the cave of Prospero is another triumph of scenic art, but fully as large a share of credit is due to Mr. Brooke as Prospero, and to Mr. Heir, as Caliban . . . The scene before the cave of Prospero introduced some dancing by Madame Strebinger Mrs. McGowan, and Miss Earl, which materially heightened the pleasure of the action . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Gustavus Vaughan Brooke (actor); Robert Heir (actor); Therese Strebinger (dancer); Fanny McGowan (dancer); Theatre Royal (Melbourne venue)\n\n\"THEATRICALS AND MUSIC.

The opening scene representing a storm at sea, with a vessel going ashore, was a triumph of scene painting and stage mechanism; and a ballet was introduced by Madame Strebinger, Mrs. McGowan, and Miss Earl, into the nymph scene, in the fourth act, with great success . . .\n\n\"THEATRE ROYAL\", The Argus (28 December 1857), 5\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7144112\n\nWe are enabled to praise Mr. Akhurst's last pantomime as an improvement upon its predecessor, as we also had occasion to refer to that in similar terms of commendation. In Harlequin Whittington and his Cat, the incidents of the story have been adhered to, with reasonable fidelity, and there is no lack of these anachronisms which contribute so much to the general grotesqueness of the piece . . . What lover of operatic music would object to the clever travesties of the scene from \"Lucrezia Borgia\" (in which Mr. McGowan made up so well, and acquitted himself so admirably), or to the burlesque upon \"Sardanapalus,\" which revived our recollections of the wild and fanciful music which heralded the approach of the processions? . . . There was a small fairy in radiant vestments cleverly impersonated by Miss Earl, and two full-grown fairies (represented by Madame Strebinger and Mrs. McGowan) who bounded about the stage so lightly that we almost expected to see them imitate the example of the policeman who subsequently carried into action the sentiment of a well-known song, and\n\n\"Took a flight / Towards heaven that night, / And left dull earth behind him\" . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: William Mower Akhurst (playwright); Robert McGowan (actor)\n\n\"SHAMROCK CONCERT HALL\", Bendigo Advertiser [VIC] (22 June 1858), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article87981274\n\nWe see by advertisement in this morning's issue, that Mr. Heffernan, determined upon giving the public a treat of no common diameter, has made arrangements with the celebrated danseuse, Madame Strebinger, and her pupil, Miss Earle, who will appear at the Shamrock to-morrow evening. These ladies, the former of whom is well known in the Australian Colonies as an artiste, who is second to no lady dancer who has ever appeared in the colonies, have for some time past been playing at the Theatre Royal in Melbourne, where, it is almost needless to say, they have been received with great applause. In addition to these ladies, we are glad to notice the name of M. Strebinger, the violinist, whose performances on this instrument are considered by many to be equal in brilliancy and execution to those of Miska Hauser himself. We trust that Mr. Heffernan's endeavors to cater for the public amusement may induce the good folks of Sandhurst to patronise the Shamrock as they used to do in the palmy days of Old Bendigo.\n\nASSOCIATIONS: William Heffernan (proprietor); Frederick Strebinger (violinist); Miska Hauser (violinist); Shamrock Concert Hall (Bendigo venue)\n\n\"SHAMROCK CONCERT HALL\", Bendigo Advertiser (24 June 1858), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article87981340\n\nThe performances at the Shamrock Concert Hall last evening were of a description rather different to those which the spirited proprietor of that place has hitherto provided for the amusement of his patrons, the public, and we should say, if we may judge from the crowds who attended the Shamrock last night, upwards of a thousand persons cramming the place, that his new speculation will prove a highly successful one. Never, on any occasion do we remember to have seen the Hall so crowded; many persons were in the early part of the evening compelled to leave, through not being able to obtain even standing room; and up till the hour of closing, the press of persons trying to obtain even a sight of the \"stars,\" was immense. It is almost needless to say, when such artistes as Madame Strebinger, Miss Earle, and M. Strebinger are concerned, that the performances wero highly successful throughout, the dancing by the ladies being of a character which has never before been witnessed in Sandhurst. Although, we must say, we could have wished that the stage had been a little larger, in order to have enabled them to display more fully those powers with which they are so highly gifted. M. Strebinger is evidently a violinist of no common order, and his performance last evening was a most valuable addition to the evening's entertainment. While rendering to the new arrivals all due praise, we must not forget our old friends Miss Urie and Thatcher, who, notwithstanding the increased attraction, were received last evening as heartily as ever . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: Louisa Urie (vocalist); Charles Thatcher (vocalist, flute player, songwriter)\n\n\"SHAMROCK CONCERT HALL\", Bendigo Advertiser (26 June 1858), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article87981398\n\nThe really elegant and fascinating performances of Madame Strebinger and Miss Earle last evening still maintained their attractive influence on the public, and a room well filled by delighted spectators was the result . . .

After the drama of \"Jacques Sincere,\" Madame Strebinger and her pupil Miss Earle, danced La Tarantella with admirable grave and dexterity. They were followed by Fraulein Fannie, who performed La Lithuanienne most charmingly, and the brothers Leopold, who were encored in their danse a la Chinoise. The crowning feature of the evening was, however, the ballet of \"La Giselle,\" in which Mdlle. Therese was the queen regnant of the occasion, though her honors were hotly disputed by M.

A good many years ago this lady was a deservedly popular actress in Melbourne. She began her stage career as a danseuse, having been a pupil of Madame Storbinger [sic, Strebinger], who, 30 years ago, was the premiere danseuse at the Theatre Royal. Afterwards, Miss Earle adopted the soubrette line in her profession, and achieved therein many successes. She was the original Polly Eccles in \"Caste\" when the piece was first played at the Haymarket, about 22 years ago. She was first married to Mr. John Edouin, brother of Mrs. G. B. W.

For some years she has been a stranger to the Melbourne stage, but in her young time she could hold her own against most comers.\n\n\"DEATH OF MISS TILLY EARL (MRS.

Miss Earl was also the original Polly Eccles, in the first presentation of the comedy, by the late Mr. Robertson, of \"Caste,\" at the Duke of Edinburgh Theatre, Melbourne, on the 11th of April, 1868. She was supported by Mrs. Walter Hill as Esther Eccles, Mrs. Gill as the Marquise, Mr. Bellair, Mr. Appleton, Mr. James Milne and Mr. W. B. Gill. The late Miss Earl was first married to the late Mr. John Edouin (brother to Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis), and while in India with Mr. Lewis' company, he died from brain fever. Mrs. J. Edouin, after some lapse of time, married in Sydney to her present husband, Mr. Charles Newton.

On post-mortem examination, it was found that his skull had sustained a fracture, apparently from the blow on the footpath, and the jury returned a verdict in accordance.\n\nEARLE, Augustus (Augustus EARLE; Mr. EARLE)\n\nMusical amateur, member of the Sydney Amateur Concerts, artist, painter\n\nBorn London, England, 1 June 1793; baptised St. Marylebone, 27 June 1793; son of James EARL [sic] and Caroline PILKINGTON (Mrs. SMYTH)\n\nArrived Hobart Town, VDL (TAS), 18 January 1825 (per Admiral Cockburn, from Tristan da Cunha)\n\nArrived Sydney, NSW, 14 May 1825 (per Cyprus, from Hobart Town)\n\nDeparted Sydney, NSW, 12 October 1828 (per Rainbow, for India)\n\nDied London, England, 10 December 1838\n\nhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/search?l-publictag=Augustus+Earle+1793-1838 (TROVE tagged by Australharmony)\n\nhttps://nla.gov.au/nla.party-485534 (NLA persistent identifier)\n\nhttps://sydney.edu.au/paradisec/australharmony/register-E-1.php#EARLE-Augustus (shareable link to this entry)\n\nDocumentation:\n\nBaptisms in the year 1793, St. Marylebone; register 1782-93; London Metropolitan Archives, P89/MRY1/009\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com.au/discoveryui-content/view/3385296:1624 (PAYWALL)\n\nJune / 27 / Augustus Earl [son of] James & Caroline / B. 1 June\n\n\"THE AMATEUR CONCERT\", The Monitor [Sydney, NSW] (21 July 1826), 5\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31757663\n\nON Wednesday Evening [19 July] about four hundred persons of both sexes assembled at the public School Room in Castlereagh-street, to listen to the musical selections of our Amateur performers of our new monthly Concert. Among the company we noticed the Lieutenant Governor, the Sheriff, the Clerk of the Council, the Clerk of the Peace, Dr. Townson, a number of Magistrates, Advocates, Military Officers, Civil Officers, principal Merchants, &c. &c. &c. All this denotes in unequivocal language the growing importance of this admirable public recreation . . .\n\nThe \"Bill of the Play,\" exhibited the following . . .\n\nDirectors for the Evening.\n\nMr. Earle. Mr. J. Paul, jun.\n\nMr. Jos. Underwood. Mr. Hayes . . .\n\nThe decorations were greatly improved by the filling up of the three windows at the head of the room, with drawings by Mr. Earle, representing the statues, in niches, of Apollo, Minerva, and Melpomene-the figures were commanding, and well executed. Between the statues were respectively placed, the Arms of the United Kingdom, and of these Colonies. We much approve of these Heraldic ornaments, but we would recommend them to be placed to the right and left over the first windows - they did not appear to us so good a relief to the statues as the plain wall would have been . . .\n\nAs there are now about 150 subscribers, we recommend that after paying the necessary expences of the institution, the surplus be retained in hand to be increased by the amount of a Benefit for Messrs. Edwards, Sippe, and Earle, who have united their exertions and talents to please the public, gratis . . .\n\nASSOCIATIONS: John Paul junior (member); Joseph Underwood (member); Mr. Hayes (member); John Edwards (member); George Sippe (member); Sydney Amateur Concerts (series); \"School room\" = Old Court House (Sydney venue)\n\n\"THE CONCERT\", The Australian [Sydney, NSW] (22 July 1826), 3\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37073176\n\nThe company assembled at the Concert-room, on Wednesday evening, was numerous and highly respectable - there could not, at the lowest computation, have been, fewer than two-hundred and fifty persons present - about one third of these, the ladies composed. Care had been taken since the preceding - concert to improve and preserve - as much of the sound as the deficiencies of the room, at least, in respect of its adaptation to the purposes of a concert-room would admit. To effect this desirable end, the eminent talents of Mr. Earle, were very happily employed. At the last concert it was found, that the niches of the three windows' behind the orchestra, as well as those at each side of the room absorbed a large portion of sound. It was therefore highly desirable and essential to remedy this defect. Mr. Earle hit upon a happy expedient, and by the aid of his talents and experience as an artist, fully succeeded. Those mischievious vacancies were condemned to be blocked up in a temporary manner. Those behind the orchestra, by the stately forms of the mythological patron and patronesses of poetry, music, and the liberal arts - those at one side, a sufficiency of blue gurrah, flushed even with the wall, and extending from the top to the bottom of each windowed nich [niche], it was thought, would assist retaining the \"echo of sweet sounds\" within proper limits.\n\nFrom a quarter past seven, to some minutes before eight, the company continued successively, pouring in. A director stationed, at the head of the stairs, received each party's ticket of admission. another ushered them into the concert-room, a third led the ladies to the entrance of a dressing or retiring room - from whence, as they re-issued, a fourth, introduced each one to, her seat. The Lieutenant Governor honored the company with his presence - the courteous manners and generous feelings of this gentleman, reflect credit on his taste and liberality. The efficient assistance rendered to the concert thro' his agency, by several of the military musicians has contributed in no slight degree towards their progressing success.\n\nSeveral Military and a number of Civil Officers, amongst whom were the. Sheriff, and Clerk of the' Council, were also present. The lights were disposed in much the same manner as on the former evening - three branches of Grecian lamps, pending from brass chains, in a right line along the centre of the ceiling, besides lesser lights, dispersed in other directions. The majestic form of Melpomene, as the muse of lyrical poetry, met the eye on first entering at the side door of the Concert-room. Her stately and perfectly designed figure, appeared to start from the canvas - she stood uprear'd on a pedestal; a wreath of laurel hung from between the fingers of her right hand - the other sustained a trumpet. This painting occupied the left windowed niche - it reached from about two feet below the ceiling to the floor of the orchestra. Melpomene is usually represented as the tragic muse; - as the patroness of lyric poetry. Horace has addressed to her one of his most admired odes- it appears in the third ode of the fourth book. The Royal Arms, with lion rampant, and the much doubted unicorn, divided Melpomene from Mr. President Apollo, whose classically designed person occupied the centre. In delineating the Royal Arms, the skilful Artist had dipped his pencil in the most vivid colours - the star and garter with the surmounting crown, and circling motto, appeared emblazoned with heraldic accuracy. - Apollo resting his lyre on the staff of AEsculapius, round which a healing serpent wound itself, stood next in classic dignity, on his pedestal of Parian marble. - A wreath of his own laurel encircled the head of this grand professor and inventor of medicine, music, poetry, and eloquence. The so much admired fascial angle in the contour and turn of the Belvedere Apollo's head, Mr. Earle imparted to his figure most happily. The real or assumed arms of Australia, appeared next; as if upborne by wisdom and the liberal arts - Apollo on the left side, Minerva on the right - A Kangaroo and Emu appeared to sustain the rising sun of Australia, which darting its rays eliptically up ward, whilst yet half sunk beneath the blue expanse of ocean, gave. a promise of future brilliancy.\n\nHope, reclining on her anchor, with a benignant smile, seemed, to rise on the sunbeams. She threw a halo of glowing rays around her enlivening figure, and recalled to the mind those beautiful lines in Campbell's pleasures of Hope;\n\n\"Eternal Hope! when yonder spheres sublime!\n\nPeriled their first notes, to sound the march of time,\n\nThy joyous youth began - but not to fade -\n\n'When all the sister planets have decayed;\n\n. When rapt in fire the realms of ether glow,\n\nAnd Heaven's last thunder shakes the world below.\n\nThou, undismayed, shalt o'er the ruins smile,\n\nAnd light, thy torch at nature's funeral pile!\"\n\nBeneath the rising sun was the following appropriate motto, \"E parvis magna\" (from small beginnings, great results proceed.) The blue-eyed virgin Minerva ranked next as the goddess of wisdom - her towering head sustained a helmet - one hand was armed with the spear - a shield, with the grisly head of the dying Medusa, protected the other. Those paintings, if the lights had been properly concentrated towards them would have had a just effect when viewed from any particular part of the room as it was, distance in place of improving, rather detracted from their appearance. Experience will, however, serve to correct this defect, and obtain for the Artist that share of admiration, to which his talents so justly entitle him . . .\n\n[Advertisement], The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (8 November 1826), 1\n\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2186870\n\nUNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THEIR EXCELLENCIES THE GOVERNOR IN CHIEF AND MRS.

The late Mr. Earle, who had been in failing health for some time, would have completed his 89th year in September next. He was born in London in 1831, and was educated at Highbury College. Thence he went to Singapore as a master. Later he was attracted to the Victorian gold-fields, and was in Ballarat at the time of the Eureka stockade. From Victoria he went to India, and was employed by the East India Company for some years. Although in India at the time of the Indian Mutiny in 1S57 he was not in the affected parts. Mr. Earle was of a roving nature, and after visiting England for a brief period he came to Australia in the 60's. He decided to settle in Brisbane, and was employed as accountant by Ward Bros. After they sold out to Alfred Shaw and Sons he became accountant to the latter firm. The deceased was of a literary bent, and was ultimately connected with journalism in Brisbane. He contributed the first and other serial stories published in \"The Week,\" and for many years controlled the \"Queensland Mercantile Gazette.\" \"Ups and Downs of Australian Life\" and several books of travel and other publications also came from his pen. The late Mr. Earle was one of the founders of the Johnsonian Club, and after severing his connection with the \"Gazette\" practically the whole of his time was spent in the work of the club, by whose members he was familiarly known as \"Daddy.\" The deceased was twice married, and leaves a widow, a son, and a daughter. The son, Mr. Arthur Earle, is connected with the Moreton Bay Oyster Co. The late Mr. Earle was predeceased by his elder son Reginald, who left one daughter, at present in London. The funeral will leave the deceased's late residence to-morrow, at 10 a.m., for the Toowong cemetery.\n\nSongs:\n\nUps and downs; or, incidents of Australian life by Horace Earle (London: A. W.
