        "text": "Ringo Starr, born as Richard Starkey on July 7, 1940 in Liverpool, England, is one of the world's most renowned drummers, achieving global fame as a member of the legendary band, The Beatles. Raised in a working-class family, Starr overcame numerous health issues during his childhood, which led to long periods away from school. It was during these hospital stays that he discovered his passion for music, particularly drumming. Starr began his musical career with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, which paved the way for his introduction into the Beatles. In 1962, Starr replaced Pete Best as the drummer for The Beatles, joining John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. His distinctive drumming style, characterized by his left-handed technique on a right-handed kit, played a pivotal role in shaping the sound of The Beatles. He also occasionally sang lead vocals on tracks such as \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" and \"Yellow Submarine,\" and even penned a few songs himself, including \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden.\" Starr's easy-going personality and unique sense of humor endeared him to fans and became a defining element of the Beatles' global image. Post-Beatles, Starr embarked on a successful solo career, releasing several hit singles like \"It Don't Come Easy\" and \"Photograph.\" Beyond music, Starr also delved into acting, featuring in films like Candy and The Magic Christian. He assumed the role of narrator and character voice for the children's television series, 'Thomas & Friends,' in the late 1980s. A prominent advocate for peace and love, Ringo Starr was knighted by Prince William in 2018 for his services to music, further cementing his legacy in the annals of rock 'n' roll history.\n\nJames Christopher Gaffigan (born July 7, 1966) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. His material often addresses fatherhood, laziness, food, religion, and general observations. He is regarded as a \"clean\" comic, using little profanity in his routines. He has released several successful comedy specials, including Mr. Universe, Obsessed, Cinco, and Quality Time, all of which have received Grammy nominations. Gaffigan's memoir Dad Is Fat (2013) and his most recent book Food: A Love Story (2014) were both published by Crown Publishers. He co-created and starred in the TV Land series The Jim Gaffigan Show, based on his life. He collaborates extensively with his wife, actress Jeannie Gaffigan, with whom he has five children. They are Catholic, a topic that frequently comes up in his comedy shows.\n\nJack Peter Benedict Whitehall (born 7 July 1988) is an English comedian, actor, presenter, and writer. He is known for starring as JP in the series Fresh Meat (2011–2016) and Alfie Wickers in the series Bad Education (2012–2014) and its spin-off film The Bad Education Movie (2015). He also co-wrote the latter two. From 2012 to 2018, Whitehall was a regular panellist on the game show A League of Their Own. In 2017, he appeared with his father in the Netflix comedy documentary series Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father and starred in the television series Decline and Fall. From 2018 to 2021, he hosted the BRIT Awards."
