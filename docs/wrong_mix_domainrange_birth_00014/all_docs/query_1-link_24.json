My heart is overflowing with happiness as I welcome to the world my two little miracles.\"\n\nCaterina's journey to motherhood has been a testament to hope, resilience, and the marvels of modern science. After navigating the challenges of IVF with the support of a clinically recruited donor provided by her fertility clinic, Caterina now celebrates the arrival of her beautiful little miracles.\n\nThe Wiggles are absolutely thrilled for Caterina and the arrival of her beautiful twin girls.

Recognisable by their blue, red, yellow, and purple skivvies, Anthony Field, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt become an unlikely music phenomenon, equipped with early childhood teaching fundamentals and a dose of self-belief. Surmounting numerous rejections from industry producers, The Wiggles take their career into their own hands and become the most successful children’s act of all time.\n\nThe film is a backstage pass to one of the world's greatest entertainment stories, and features decades of personal archive footage and intimate access to their sold-out shows. It’s the story of a life of music, friendship, joy, and the enduring power of the child in all of us.\n\nIt’s our biggest musical extravaganza ever! The Best Of The Wiggles is jam-packed with 80 tracks featuring classics such as Hot Potato, Fruit Salad, and Do the Propeller! alongside newer hits like Dippy Do Dinosaur Dance!, Sing Together, and Hey Tsehay!

Perfect for creating a calm atmosphere in nurseries, bedrooms, or any space in need of a touch of tranquility.\n\n“We understand firsthand the challenge of settling babies and toddlers to sleep, which is why we created this album. Our hope is that these gentle piano melodies offer a soothing solution for parents and carers, providing a peaceful pathway to bedtime for families everywhere” – Lachy Wiggle."
