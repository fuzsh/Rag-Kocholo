        "text": "Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary Handbook\n\n— Biographies and Sources —\n\nPalestrina, Giovanni Pierluigi Sante da, 1525-94\n\nGiovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (the latter name from his native city) was born 1525 or 1526 and died in 1594. He ranks as the foremost composer of the Catholic Church. He began as organist and musical director in his native town, but was soon called to Rome, where he was appointed composer to the Pontifical Chapel and Maestro of St. Peter’s. He filled many other engagements as composer, concert-master, conductor, and director in study. Palestrina’s works mark the culmination of the era of strict, simple contrapuntal composition, and brought this form of composition into its proper place as a means of expression and not as an end in itself. His complete works have been published in 33 volumes, containing 99 masses, 139 motets, and other compositions almost without number. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nPALESTRINA, Giovanni Pierluigi Sante da (1525-1594), born at Palestrina, Italy, received his early musical training at Rome, where he came under the influence of Orlando di Lasso, the great master from the Netherlands. At nineteen Palestrina became organist and chapelmaster in his home town, and after serving there a number of years, he was appointed master of the boys in the Julian Chapel in Rome. In 1555 he became a pontifical singer in the Sistine Chapel, but, after about six months, was dismissed because of a papal ruling that only unmarried priests be allowed to attend. He then became chapelmaster, first of St. John Lateran, and then of the Liberian Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore, spending his last twenty years in practical retirement at St. Peter’s. Palestrina is ranked as the foremost composer of the Roman Catholic Church. His greatest contribution to general hymnody was his stand against the introduction of popular airs and lyrics into the church services of the 16th century. Palestrina was able to present simple, polyphonic compositions that were noble and devotional in character. Among his works are 93 masses, 139 motets, and many hymns, prayers, and responses. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n357\n\nPalmer, Ray, 1808-87\n\nRay Palmer (1808-87), who rendered the translation for No. 382, served as a congregational preacher in Albany, New York. He was also for a time secretary for The American Congregational Union. Palmer ranks as the foremost American hymn writer. “My faith looks up to Thee” is his most famous hymn (L. H. 456). [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nPALMER, Ray (1808-1887), was a direct descendant of John Alden and his wife Priscilla, and of William Palmer, who came to Plymouth in 1621. The son of Judge Thomas Palmer, he was born at Little Compton, Rhode Island, November 12, 1808. Poverty forced him to leave home at thirteen after completing grammar school. While clerk in a Boston dry-goods store for two years, he passed through deep spiritual experiences, with the result that he joined the Park Street Congregational Church, whose pastor was Sereno Edwards Dwight. Palmer’s attention was now directed to the ministry. After three years at Phillips Academy, Andover, he studied at Yale College, graduating in 1830. Palmer continued his theological studies under pastoral supervision for a year at New York. Here he wrote the hymn “My faith looks up to Thee.” Then he continued his studies for three years at New Haven, where he was associated with Ethan A. Andrews in conducting a Young Ladies Institute. He was ordained pastor of the Central Congregational Church, Bath, Maine in 1835. Here he remained fifteen years except for a trip to Europe for his health in 1847. During these years he wrote some of his best hymns. In 1850 he was appointed to the First Congregational Church at Albany, New York. Here he also labored for fifteen years but had to resign because of failing health in 1865. He moved to New York and was appointed Corresponding Secretary to the American Congregational Union, resigning this post in 1878 and moving to Newark, New Jersey, where he was in active ministerial service for the Belleville Avenue Congregational Church, having especial charge of visiting the people of the congregation. On the day before he died, Palmer feebly repeated the last stanza of his favorite hymn: [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n“When death these mortal eyes shall seal, [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nAnd still this throbbing heart, [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nThe rending veil shall Thee reveal [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nAll glorious as Thou art.” [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nRay Palmer is said to have written more hymns than any other American. His Poetical Works, published in 1876, fill a volume of more than 350 pages. He died March 29, 1887. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n184\n\ntr. 11, 318\n\nParry, Joseph, 1841-1903\n\nJoseph Parry was born May 21, 1841, Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. Parry’s family moved to Danville, Pennsylvania, when he was 13 years old, though he often returned to Wales. He attended the Royal Academy of Music, 1868-1871. He was Professor of Music at the University of Wales, 1873-1877, and received his doctorate of music from Cambridge in 1878. He also taught at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, 1888-1903. His works include operas, oratorios, cantatas, piano pieces, and hymn tunes. He died February 17, 1903, Penarth, Wales. [The Cyber Hymnal]\n\n209, 296\n\nPaulsen, Paul Christian, 1881-1948\n\nPAULSEN, Paul Christian (1881-1948), son of Andreas Paulsen and Anne, née Holbeck, was born March 26, 1881, at Alstrup, Jutland, Denmark, and came to America in 1904. He was educated at Valley City (North Dakota) Normal School; Dana College and Trinity Seminary, Blair, Nebraska; and Chicago Lutheran Seminary, Maywood. After his ordination in 1911 he served the following parishes: Nelson-Osakis-Elmdale, Minnesota, Hartland-Oregon, Wisconsin; Chicago (south side); Calgary, Alberta, Canada; and Ferndale, California, from 1941 to 1946, when he retired to Selma, California. He died there July 26, 1948. He was secretary for nine years and president for three years of the Illinois District of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church. He contributed short stories to synodical papers and periodicals, both Danish and English, and was recognized as an outstanding translator of Danish hymns and songs. He was chairman of the joint committee created in 1925 by the two Danish synods to prepare an English hymnbook, the Hymnal for Church and Home, published in 1927, to which Paulsen contributed 63 translations from the Danish and ten original compositions. The committee also issued a Junior Hymnal. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\ntr. 83\n\nPedersen, B., 1608\n\nTHIS hymn was originally printed together with another spiritual song, about the year 1608, under the following title: “Tvende aandelige andægtige Sange, Odense Byes, mine gunstige gode geistlige og verdslige Øvrigheder med deres Menigheder til et ydmygt Taknemmeligheds Tegn, udi denne Forms Bekostning dediceret af B. Pedersen, K. ibidem” (Kannik sammesteds). The author served as canon or minister in Odense or in some city in the district of Fyen. According to a resolution of the church, the fourth stanza of this hymn was to be sung after Baptism, and the fifth stanza before Communion. It has been extensively used in the parochial schools of the church and as a closing hymn on confirmation day. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\n510\n\nPerronet, Edward, 1726-92\n\nEdward Perronet was the son of Rev. Vincent Perronet, whose father, David Perronet, a Frenchman, settled in England about the year 1680. Vincent, educated at Oxford, became vicar of Shoreham, Kent, 1726. He was a zealous evangelical preacher and labored with the Wesley brothers and George Whitefield. Edward Perronet was born August 2, 1721 (according to some, 1726). From his 23rd year he served with his brother Charles in the Methodist movement. In 1756 Edward Perronet wrote a satirical poem in which he bitterly attacked the State Church and its leading men. John Wesley and others were highly incensed over this poem and demanded that it should be suppressed. This was also done. Later on Edward Perronet became pastor for a congregation of dissenters in Canterbury, where he died January 2, 1792. He is mentioned as a zealous, fiery, and energetic preacher, who faithfully proclaimed the Gospel “in season and out of season.” His poems were published anonymously in three small volumes: I. Select Passages of the Old and New Testament Versified; 2. A Small Collection of Hymns, etc.; 3. Occasional Verses, Moral and Sacred, London, 1785. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nPERRONET, Edward (1726-1792), of French descent, was born at Sundridge, Kent, the son of Vincent Perronet, whose father, Pasteur Perronet, had been pastor in Switzerland. Edward was baptized and brought up in the Church of England, and originally he had no other thought than to be one of her clergy. However already at an early age, for reasons of conscience, he joined the Wesleys and became an itinerant preacher for them. Though strongly evangelical, he had a quick eye for defects which is a characteristic of his The Mitre, a bitter satire on the Church of England, published in 1757, which reflects contemporary ecclesiastical opinion and sentiment. It aroused John Wesley’s anger, and he demanded its immediate suppression. As a result, he left the Wesleys and joined Lady Huntingdon’s Connection in 1771. This he soon abandoned and became a minister of a small independent chapel at Canterbury, serving this church until his death in 1792. Later he and the Wesleys were reconciled. He died January 2, 1792, his last words being: [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nGlory to God in the height of his divinity, [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nGlory to God in the depth of his humanity, [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nGlory to God in his all sufficiency [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nInto his hand I commend my spirit.

Henkel in Corydon, Indiana, and ordained to the Lutheran ministry in 1858. He served as pastor of the Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States and was active as author. He published The Reformation of the 16th Century, 1889; St. Paul, 1901; and translated hymns. He died in 1917. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\ntr. 538\n\nPeterson, Victor Olof, 1864-1929\n\nPETERSEN, Victor Olof (18641929), was born in Skede, Smaland, Sweden, September 24, 1864, and came to America in 1867. He studied at Augustana College and Academy, Rock Island, Illinois, graduating in 1889. After a summer at the state museum at Springfield, Illinois, under his former professor, Dr. Joshua Lindahl, he taught physics and chemistry at Augustana College. After he took a chemistry course at Harvard, Augustana called him as regular professor. In 1906 he became secretary of the Rock Island Tropical Plantation Co. and from 1907 to 1913 managed the Chalchijapa Plantation in southern Mexico. Then he was engaged in the real estate and insurance business in Rock Island until in 1920 he was called as professor of chemistry at Huron College, Huron, South Dakota, where he remained until his death. He was a lover of hymns and translated a number of them from the Swedish Psalmbook. Three are in the present Augustana Hymnal. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\ntr. 104\n\nPetri, Olav 1493-1552\n\ntr. 342\n\nPetursson, Hallgrim, 1614-74\n\nNEARLY two hundred and fifty years ago [written in 1913], in a lonely Icelandic farm-house a leper lay dying. Outside the doors of the cottage Nature was lavish in her gifts of beauty. To the west the waters of the Whalefirth widened towards the Greenland Sea and the sunset. To the east they narrowed into a girdle of hill and fell, forming a land-locked bay, scene of exploits told in one of the Sagas of long ago. But within the cottage all was bare and comfortless. The membrane of the primitive window rattled in the autumn wind, while on the wooden locker-bed, built into the wall of the house, amidst the heart-breaking squalor of his disease, the leper lay dying. But look! his lips are moving, and, as we listen, we hear him pour forth in his beautiful language a hymn bright with the deathless hope of Christ’s Gospel, glad with the assurance of a speedy release from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. It was the man’s swan-song. Not long afterwards, by the quiet hand of death, he gained his heart’s desire.\n\nSuch must have been, as in imagination we reconstruct the scene from the knowledge at our disposal, the passing of Hallgrim Petursson, the sacred singer of Iceland. It was a notable example of the victory of the spirit over the flesh, of the triumph of the Christian in his hour of deepest physical need. Small wonder that this was the man who out of his poverty left to his countrymen one of the most precious legacies which they have ever received—those Passion Hymns, which Iceland hearts will cherish, as a poet of their own has said, “as long as the sun shines upon the cold Jokull.”\n\nHallgrim Petursson was born in the year 1614. His youth was cast in one of the stirring periods of Icelandic history. The breath of the Reformation was breathing upon the dead bones and waking them to life. Odd Gottskalksson had published his Icelandic New Testament in 1540, six years before the death of Luther—a version of which Gudbrand Vigfusson could write: “It is well worthy to stand by the side of that of Tyndal or Luther, and higher praise could hardly be given to it.” Bishop Gudbrand of Holar had brought out his complete edition of the Icelandic Bible in 1584, and was issuing hymns and other religious literature from his press. It was in this bracing atmosphere that Hallgrim spent his early years, his father being sexton of the Cathedral at Holar. Here doubtless were sown in the boy’s heart those seeds which later were to bear such abundant fruit. But the harvest was not yet. Possibly owing to some youthful indiscretion, the young Hallgrim was sent from the school at Holar to Copenhagen. Here, in the great city, the boy’s talents were in imminent danger of being lost. But divine providence was watching over him. Brynjolf Sveinsson, later to become one of the most famous of Icelandic Bishops, found him in a black smith’s shop, and with quick eye discerning the gold beneath the grime, put him again to school. His education in Copenhagen was continued until an event occurred which was to cast its influence over his whole life. It was in the year 1627, the year of Bishop Gudbrand’s death, that four ships from North Africa, three of them being corsairs from Algiers, fell upon the defenceless coast of Iceland. The main attack was delivered upon the Island of Heimaey, the chief of the Westman group. The wanton and inhuman atrocities committed by the pirates so burnt themselves into the memory of the unfortunate inhabitants, that Mr. Nelson Annandale relates that during his six weeks’ stay at Heimaey in the year 1898 he heard almost daily of the raid. Between three and four hundred persons were taken captives chiefly by the Algerians, and sold as slaves in the market at Algiers. Many suffered great cruelty, largely in the form of persecution for their faith. They were “chained in insupportable positions, beaten on the hands and faces, exposed naked in public places, and again beaten until they lost the power of speech.” At length, however, an Icelander was allowed to carry a petition to the King of Denmark, asking for I,200 rix-dollars as a ransom price for the surviving captives. A subscription was raised in Iceland, to which the King of Denmark himself largely contributed. This was paid over in due course, and in 1637, ten years after the raid, thirty-four survivors out of the hundreds taken were set at liberty.\n\nSome of these people broke their homeward journey at Copenhagen, and here it is that Hallgrim Petursson again comes into the story. During their enforced sojourn in North Africa, these survivors seem to have become more or less infected with Mohammedanism, or at least to have let a part of their Christian faith slip away into the limbo of forgetfulness. It was necessary to remedy this state of things, and to do so an Icelander, learned in Christian truth, but resident at Copenhagen, was needed. Hallgrim Petursson, now a distinguished theological student, fulfilled these conditions, and was forthwith appointed by the authorities to be the religious instructor of his rescued compatriots. Among the captives was a lady, Gudrid by name, who by her beauty had already attracted the attention of the son of the Dey of Algiers. The young prince had even wished to marry her. This, of course, could not be tolerated, and the source of temptation was sent out of the country among the other ransomed slaves. Gudrid thus became a member of the group which was confided to the pastoral care of Hallgrim Petursson. It was perhaps not unnatural that he in his turn should become a captive to those charms which had already proved too potent for the Algerian Prince. Such was the infatuation of the unfortunate man, that although Gudrid had been a married woman in Iceland before the raid, and although, for all that was known to the contrary, her husband was still living there, Hallgrim determined to leave Copenhagen and to sail back to Iceland with Gudrid. Upon their arrival in that country they remained together, and at length, hearing of the husband’s death, were married. This conduct was the great blot upon Hallgrim’s life. He did not go unpunished. The sweet fruit became bitter in his mouth. The Mohammedan leanings of his wife were through long years a pain and grief to his sensitive nature. Nor did his conscience keep silence.\n\n“Lord, I have sown the seed of sin;\n\nHideous have my transgressions been.”\n\nSo he sings in one of his Passion-Hymns, and it has been thought that the words bear a special reference to this episode of his career. This sin may have been in a sense the beata culpa, which, with its attendant remorse, drove him to the Cross for that gift of pardon and renewal, of which he was afterwards to sing so peerlessly to his countrymen.\n\nHallgrim Petursson was ordained in 1644 and was in 1650 appointed to the parish of Saurby on the Whalefirth in the south-west of Iceland. Here he gave himself largely to the exercise of his poetic gift, writing much religious verse; and it was here that, inspired by the example of Paul Gerhardt in Germany and of Kingo in Denmark, he achieved his greatest work in the composition of the immortal Passion-Hymns. They appeared in the year 1659, a first copy of the manuscript being sent to the daughter of that Bishop Brynjolf Sveinsson who had formerly befriended him in Copenhagen. But the singer of Christ’s Passion was soon himself to pass through a very furnace of affliction. He contracted the dread disease of leprosy. This he bore with exemplary fortitude, and passed away after a lingering illness in the glory of an unclouded hope. He died at Ferstikla near the parsonage of Saurby in the year 1674.\n\nThe Passion-Hymns are fifty in number. They tell the story of Christ’s sufferings from the moment when the Master sang the Pascal Hymn with His disciples in the Upper Room until the military watch was set and the seal made fast upon His tomb. Each hymn consists, as a rule, of from fifteen to twenty stanzas. The poet begins by paraphrasing the biblical narrative of that incident in the Passion Story with which he is about to deal. He thus accomplishes what is achieved in Oratorio by the recitative. He then passes on to meditation, exhortation, prayer or praise. The hymns were written to be sung, generally speaking, to German chorales of the sixteenth century. With these tunes of stately dignity they naturally blend. To sing them to lighter modern airs would jar on the ear as a kind of sacrilege. In fact, to fully appreciate the hymns, it is necessary to hear them sung to these slow and majestic melodies from the times of Luther, which give free play and scope to the beauty of the Icelandic vowel sounds. In former days it was the custom in the scattered farm-houses of Iceland to sing the Passion-Hymns through during Lent. This custom is still to some extent observed, as, for instance, in the chief Icelandic Church in Winnipeg. Nor can a better preparation for Good Friday, the “Long Fast Day,” as it is called by the Icelanders, be well imagined. The practice however is not as universal as it was, partly owing to the indifference which pervades so much of the modern world, and partly through the prevalence of views in recent years, which, as an Icelandic clergyman has pointed out, “must make the Passion-Hymns of Hallgrim Petursson die upon the lips.” It is however still true to say that this singer of the Cross is the outstanding poet of his people. His hymns have been called “The flower of all Icelandic poetry.” He is still sung and quoted with reverence and with affection. He holds his position, we might almost say, as the Shakespeare or the Milton of his native land.\n\nIf we seek the reasons for the spell which the Passion-Hymns have cast over the heart of Iceland for nearly two centuries and a half, we shall not have to look far for an answer. It is true that the range of thought is not wide, that the style is sometimes almost irritatingly didactic, and that the charm of colouring from nature through metaphor or simile is conspicuous only by its absence. The Passion-Hymns possess, however, one mighty secret. In exquisite Icelandic the poet dwells upon the benefits procured for sinful man by Christ’s Passion. He isolates (and surely e may forgive him for doing so) each particular suffering which the Redeemer underwent, and shows the gain wrought for man thereby. Was Christ left alone in His hour of need? It was that we might never be forsaken. Was Christ clothed in a robe of mockery? It was that we might be arrayed in a robe of glory. Was Christ hounded to death with the cry of “Crucify Him?” It was that heaven and earth might over us call “peace.” Were Christ’s feet pierced? It was that the sins of our wayward feet might be forgiven. Was Christ’s side, as Adam’s, opened? It was that His Bride, the Church, in that healing stream of Water and of Blood, might be born. The Passion of Christ is the adoring poet’s theme. Now in homely teaching, now in pathetic prayer, now in rapturous praise, he “placards “ Christ Crucified before his countrymen. He raised, as it were, a mighty crucifix of song over Iceland, and thither, for nearly two centuries and a half, the weary and the heavy laden have turned their eyes. He sang the theme of the ages, and his song has become immortal. Matthias Jochumsson, the leading poet of modern Iceland, has written a beautiful ode to commemorate the bicentenary of Hallgrim Petursson’s death. He therein speaks of him as “the David of this land of Jokulls.” He calls him a light “who lightened two centuries.” He tells us that from the time when the child first says his prayers at his mother’s knee, until the day when as an old man he turns him to his last sleep, it is Hallgrim’s hymns which have power to soothe and to heal. And when Matthias Jochumsson is describing in another poem the passing of Gudbrand Vigfusson, the great Icelander of Oxford, he pictures him Iying with the Havamal* at his head, Heimskringla at his breast, but the Passion Hymns at his heart. That is their secret. The Passion-Hymns have spoken to the heart of Iceland.\n\n(*Readers of Longfellow’s “Saga of King Olaf,” in the “Tales from a Wayside Inn,” will need no explanation of these terms.)

In 1673 he was appointed by Duke Ernst the Pious of Gotha as tutor of his three sons. Three years later Duke Friedrich I appointed him pastor of Friemar, near Gotha, and in 1682 made him a member of the consistory and superintendent at Gräfen-Tonna, also near Gotha.

After completing his course at the University of Halle and of Tübingen, he was appointed Württemberg secretary of the legation at Regensburg in 1732. He was privileged to hold a number of political offices. Finding himself no longer able to cooperate in carrying out the absolution of the Württemberg prime minister, Count Montmartin, he resigned and then retired to his estate, Deufstetten, near Crailsheim. Later on he was created Baron by the Emperor Joseph II, and in 1765 received the cross of the Red Eagle Order from Frederick the Great. An intermittent fever confined him to his bed from August, 1783, to his death, February 14, 1784, at Deufstetten. Pfeil was a man of deep and genuine piety. His hymn-writing began immediately after the spiritual change which he experienced on the tenth Sunday after Trinity, 1730, and it continued to be his favorite occupation, especially so in his later years at Deufstetten. He was one of the most productive of German hymnwriters, his published hymns numbering about 950.

He began his musical career as “kapellmeister” of Lüneburg. In 1604 he was called into the service of the Duke of Brunswick, first as organist, later as “kapellmeister” and secretary. He was appointed prior of the cloister of Ringelheim, but was not required to take up his residence there. Praetorius died in Wolfenbüttel upon his fiftieth birthday, February 15, 1621. He had become famous as composer of church music, among which should be mentioned the mammoth edition of over twelve hundred songs. He is also noted for various writings, among which the great Syntagma musica still furnishes much valuable source-material. He ranks high as a writer and also as a composer of church melodies. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nPRÄTORIUS, Michael (1571-1621). Michael Prätorius, the son of Michael Schultze (Praetorius being a Latinization of the name), was born at Kreuzburg Thuringia, on February 15, 1571. At an early age Prätorius attended the University of Frankfurt a. O., his brother supporting him. When his brother died, Prätorius became organist at Frankfurt and later held the same post at Lüneburg. In this latter town Prätorius began his career as Kapellmeieter. In 1604 he entered the service of the Duke of Brunswick at Wolfenbüttel and was appointed honorary prior of the Ringelheim Monastery near Goslar, but without compulsion to reside there. He died at Wolfenbüttel on February 15, 1621. Prätorius composed much and was a serious student of music. He began to write a complete encyclopedia of the art and practice of music, of which he finished three volumes with the title Syntagma Musicum. The second volume of this work is the most elaborate and valuable of all treatises on instruments and instrumental music in the 16th century. It is considered one of the most remarkable examples of musical scholarship in existance. Among his other titles were Musae Sioniae published in nine parts and Hymnodia Sionae.

From the brief and incomplete autobiographical preface attached to the first edition of his complete works, when he was 57 years old, it is evident that he received a good education, that he belonged to a noble family, that he studied law, became a lawyer, entered public life, and held a prominent position (Roman governor) under Emperor Theodosius.— At the age of 57 he retired to a monastery, where he died shortly afterwards.—The above mentioned preface also contains a list of his works.—His Cathemerinon Liber (Daily Round), contains 12 hymns, one for each hour of the day (at cock-crow, morning, before the meal, after the meal, evening, etc.) and a funeral hymn, “Deus ignee fons animarum,” Cathemerinon, No. 10. It consists of 44 verses. From this song has been derived the hymn “Jam moesta quiesce querela” (Despair not, O heart, in thy sorrow), formed from verses 31, 15, 10-12, 32-36 of the original poem. Archbishop Trench calls this song “The crowning glory of the poetry of Prudentius.”—It has been called the song of the catacombs, for it is believed to have been sung during the persecutions of the Christians in the catacombs of Rome, whose darkness was changed into light by the glorious hope of resurrection which this hymn gives. “Hors auf mit Tränen und Klagen,” has been a favorite hymn in Germany and in other countries.—Prudentius’ Liber Peristephanon consists of 14 hymns to the martyrs. They are glowing hymns which have gained world-wide admiration.—The above mentioned works, together with his Psychomachia, were among the most widely read books in the Middle Ages. From an esthetic point of view, Psychomachia is less important than the others, but it exerted a greater influence than any of his other works. In this he describes the conflict of Christianity with heathenism, presented allegorically as a conflict between Christian virtues and heathen vices. His Apotheosis and Hamartigenia are polemic writings. The former is directed against those who deny the divinity of Christ, the latter against the gnostic dualism of Marcion and his followers. Contra Symmachum (two volumes of 638 and 1131 hexameter verses) is of historic interest. The first volume attacks the heathen worship, and the second is directed against a petition by Symmachus to the emperor for the restoration of an altar and a statue of the goddess of victory, which Gratian had removed. His Dittochaeon is more of an archaeological than a literary work.— Prudentius has written about twenty-eight hymns, some of which are very long, and are found in various breviaries. One of them is divided into eight or nine hymns. It is especially in the Spanish ritual that the hymns of Prudentius are characterized by a deep earnestness. Portions of them are noted for their beauty and richness of expression, and for their dramatic power. However, some of them are artificial and stilted. It is to his credit that he followed the principle that new life and a new view of life will and must manifest themselves in new forms; and also the Latin language must take on a new form in order that it might promote the great truths which hitherto had been foreign to it. Bentley calls Prudentius “the Horace and Vergil of the Christians.”—In our day, a renewed interest in Prudentius has been awakened: J. Bergman’s Lexicon Prudentianum, Upsala, 1894; M. Schantz, München, 1904; J. R. Glover, Cambridge, 1901; F. Maigret, Paris, 1903; and many others. —Our English translation is by O. T. Sanden, 1909.\n\nRudelbach says: “The poetry of Prudentius is like gold set with precious stones.” Luther desired that Prudentius be studied in the schools, and also recommended his funeral hymn. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nPRUDENTIUS, Aurelius Clemens (348 - c. 413) . Of the life of Prudentius nothing is known beyond what he himself has written in a short introduction in verse to his works. He was a Spaniard, evidently of a good family, and was born somewhere in the north of Spain, either at Saragossa, Tarragona, or Callahorra. After receiving a good education befitting his social status, Prudentius applied himself for some years practicing as a pleader in the local court of law, until he received promotion to a judgeship in two cities successively and afterwards to a post of still higher authority, perhaps that of Roman governor. When Prudentius was fifty-seven, he became conscience-smitten on account of the follies and worldliness that had marked his youth and earlier manhood and determined to quit all his secular employments and to devote the remainder of his life to advancing the interests of Christ’s Church by the power of his pen. He retired to a monastery and then began that remarkable succession of sacred poems upon which his fame now rests. Prudentius is considered the most prominent and most prolific author of sacred Latin poetry in its earliest days. His hymns are contained in two of his works, Liber Cathemerinon (containing 14 hymns) and Liber Peristephanon (containing 14 hymns to the martyrs). These two works and his Psychomachia were the most widely read books during the Middle Ages. Prudentius wrote about 28 hymns in all. Bently calls him “The Horace and Vergil of the Christians. “Luther desired that Prudentius be studied in the schools, and Rudelbach was of the opinion that “the poetry of Prudentius is like gold set with precious stones.” [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n181\n\nPsalmodia Sacra, C.

He was an elder brother of the famous Dr. Edw. B. Pusey, author and professor at Oxford University. Philip took his academic degree at Oxford, but in 1853 received also the honorary degree of D. C. L. (doctor of civic law). He died July 9, 1855. Matthæus Apelles von Löwenstern was born April 20, 1594, in Neustadt, Silesia, where his father was a saddlemaker. The son became famous as a talented musician, and in 1625 was given a position with Duke Heinrich Wenzel. Six years later he was appointed royal councillor and chamberlain. Later he entered the service of Ferdinand III and was by him raised to the nobility. Finally he became secretary of state under Duke Karl Friedrich of Münsterberg. He died April 11, 1648, in Breslau. In all he wrote about 30 hymns, several of which have been translated into English and other languages. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nPUSEY, Philip (1790-1855). Pusey’s father was a son of the first Viscount Folestone, who assumed the name of Pusey instead of that of Bouverie. His elder brother was the famous Dr. Edward Bouverie Pusey, the Tractarian leader. Pusey, born on June 25, 1799, at Pusey, England, was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, but left without taking his degree. An Honorary D. C. L. was given him at Commemoration in 1853. After leaving the university Pusey settled on his estate and devoted himself to agriculture and public service. In the former field he was one of the most progressive men of his time; he wrote largely in this field. Pusey was one of the founders of the Royal Agricultural Society. He entered Parliament and sat for Rye, Chippenham, Cashel, and Berkshire. He introduced the term “tenant-right” into the House of Commons. Disraeli said that Pusey was “both by his lineage, his estate, his rare accomplishments and fine abilities, one of the most distinguished country gentlemen who ever sat in the House of Commons.” Pusey had many accomplishments: he was a connoisseur of art, a collector of prints and etchings, a copious contributor to the reviews, and one of the founders of the London Library. He was also interested in hymnology. He wanted to supplant the Sternhold and Hopkins version of the psalms by Milman’s hymns. In this he was opposed by his famous brother. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\ntr. 439\n\nRambach, Johann Jacob, 1693-1735\n\nJohann Jakob Rambach was born February 24, 1693, in Halle. From his earliest youth he was taught to be obedient and God-fearing. His parents were both deeply influenced by the pietistic movement through Spener. Rambach’s father was a carpenter without sufficient means to permit the son to take up regular studies. But as the boy showed extraordinary talent he was sent to the gymnasium at Glaucha. At fourteen years of age he left this institution and began work in his father’s shop to assist his parents in providing for the family. The following year he sprained his foot so that he could not work for several months. Being advised by his physician not to return to the carpenter’s trade, and encouraged by his parents to take up his studies again, he entered school once more in 1708 and showed such progress that he was permitted to enter the university in 1712. On account of a serious condition of hoarseness, from which he suffered since his birth, he planned at first to study medicine. But he was strongly advised that the church does not only need preachers, but teachers as well. He then entered in earnest upon his theological studies.\n\nDuring the spring of 1719 he became ill and spent the summer as the guest of Duke Henkel at the latter’s country home. He soon regained his strength. In August he visited Jena, in which city he was called to lecture at the university. He was also frequently called on to preach in the church. Both his lectures and his sermons drew large numbers. In the spring of 1720 he received his master’s degree. In 1723 he returned to Halle, where he was appointed adjunct and inspector of the orphanage, later (1726) professor extraordinary; and at A. H. Francke’s death, 1727, Rambach was made his successor as regular professor.\n\nRambach was esteemed very highly both as a professor and as a preacher. It has been claimed that the jealousy of his fellow teachers at Halle caused him to leave his position there. In 1731 he received two calls; one from the Duke of Hessen, asking him to become principal theological professor and superintendent at Giessen; the other from Denmark to become German court preacher and theological professor at the University of Copenhagen. Rambach chose Giessen. Here he found conditions quite different from those at Halle. The people had but little sympathy with an earnest and living Christianity, and Rambach’s activity was soon met with scoffing and opposition. It became a matter of continued grief to him that his preaching did not seem to bear any fruit. But he continued to work with untiring zeal. In 1734 he received a call from the newly established University of Göttingen, to become principal professor of theology. He felt inclined to accept this call, but yielded to the intense desire of the duke that he should remain. The following year he was stricken with a violent attack of fever. He realized that his end was drawing near, and it was his constant prayer that he might retain consciousness until the last. He died the 19th of April, 1735. His last words were, “I hold fast to Jesus, and I am prepared to go to Him.” It has been asserted that Rambach died from intense sorrow and grief over his flock.\n\nRambach wrote over 180 hymns. They were published in Geistliche Poesien, Halle, 1720; Poetische Fest-Gedancken, Jena and Leipzig, 1721; Erbauliches Handbüchlein für Kinder, Giessen, 1734; Geistreiches Haus-Gesangbuch, Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1735; Wunder der bis zum Tode des Kreutzes erniedrigten Liebe, Giessen, 1750. Rambach’s Geistliche Lieder, containing 165 hymns, was published in Leipzig, 1844, by Dr. J. L. Pasig. Many of his hymns were taken up by the German hymnals of the 18th century. Many are still in use. There are fifteen of Rambach’s hymns in English translation.\n\nRambach’s hymns are characterized by depth of thought, combined with clearness of expression. They are thoroughly Scriptural and churchly. Bunsen says that Rambach’s hymns formed a beautiful and very necessary counteraction to the sentimental poetry of his time. And Dr. J. L. Pasig says: “Because his hymns flow out from a heart which is aflame with intense love of Jesus Christ, who alone can give that peace which the world cannot give, therefore they are also permeated by the spirit of the Holy Scriptures, and they speak no other language but the language of the Bible, in which Christ is the central figure and the guiding star.” [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nRAMBACH, Johann Jacob (1693-1735), one of the outstanding leaders among the German Pietists, was born February 24, 1693, in Halle. When he entered Halle University in 1712, he felt that an impediment in his speech would make it more advisable for him to study medicine than theology; but he was strongly advised by his friends and teachers to change his mind. They recognized his great gifts and argued that the Church needed teachers as well as preachers. He then took up his theological studies in earnest. He was thirty years old when he became Professor Johann Daniel Herrnschmidt’s successor at the University of Halle. In 1727 Rambach became the successor of the great August Hermann Francke, founder of the Halle institutions. It has been claimed that the jealousy of fellow-teachers at Halle caused Rambach to leave that university in 1731 to teach at the University of Giessen. He had in that year received two calls: one from Denmark to become German court preacher and theological professor at the University of Copenhagen, the other, from the Duke of Hessen, asking him to serve as principal theological professor and superintendent at Giessen. He accepted the latter position. He found conditions at Giessen much different from those at Halle. His earnest work was not received well. He met with opposition and scoffing. He began to grieve over the fact that his preaching seemed to bear but little fruit. Yet he continued to labor with unremitting zeal at the ultimate expense of his health. He was only forty-two years old when he died from a violent attack of fever, April 19, 1735. His last words were “I hold fast to Jesus, and I am prepared to go to Him.” It has been said that intense sorrow over his unresponsive flock contributed to his untimely death. He wrote over 180 hymns in all, although he is better known as a hymnologist than as a hymn-writer. He published Über Dr. M. Luthers Verdienst um den Kirchengesang, 1813; Anthologie christlicher Gesänge, in six volumes (this is his greatest work). He was principal editor of the Hamburg Gesang-Buch, 1842.

After serving there for twenty-five years, Redhead became the organist of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in 1864 and served in this capacity until 1894. With Oakeley Redhead edited the first Gregorian Psalter under the title of Laudes Diurnae. This and Redhead’s other works for the Church greatly influenced the music of the Catholic revival.

So upon the advice of one Rev. Matthew Wilks he entered Hackney Seminary in the New Road, East London, as a theological student under the Rev. George Collison in 1807. In November, 1811, he was ordained as pastor of the congregation in which he originally was a member and with which he remained until November 27, 1861. He was active in founding institutions for orphaned children in London. In 1834 Reed and the Rev. J. Matheson were sent to the Congregational Churches of America by the Congregational Union of England and Wales as a deputation, in order to promote peace and friendship between the two communities. He spent six months in America. On this visit Yale University conferred upon him the honorary degree of D. D. After his return to England he published his Visit to American Churches in 1836. In 1843 he published the Revival of Religion in Wycliffe Chapel, in 1861 his Sermons. He died February 25, 1862. His Hymn-Book was a work of years and was published in complete form in 1842.

There he learned to know Luther and other leaders of the Reformation. He studied Hebrew and Greek under Reuchlin in 1521. He then became private secretary to Georg von Frundsberg. Later, in November, 1526, we find him and his friend Jakob Ziegler with Georg von Frundsberg’s troops on a campaign in Italy, helping Charles V fight against Clemens VII.

He was a bold and aggressive worker and was not afraid to speak his mind. He was a keen observer and recognized clearly the need of his times. In his didactic poems, which were published in many editions, he gave a number of-very interesting sketches of his age. But he was also a pedagog, a schoolmaster who could chastise; without regard for persons he swung the lash, and his own contemporaries in the ministry were often made to feel it keenly. In poetic power Ringwaldt resembled Luther. His best known hymn, “Es ist gewisslich an der Zeit,” “Det snart forvist paa Tiden er” (Landst. 573), has even been ascribed to Luther. Ringwaldt was one of the most prolific hymn writers of the 16th century. Wackernagel attributes to him 208 poems, of which 165 are hymns. In 1577 appeared his Der 91. Psalm neben sieben andern schönen Liedern; his Evangelia auf alle Sontag vnd Fest durchs ganze Jahr, about the year 1582. It contains hymns based upon the Gospel lessons for all the Sundays and holidays of the year. Handbüchlein: geistliche Lieder und Gebetlein, etc., was published in 1586. All these were published in Frankfurt an der Oder. Several of his hymns are found scattered among his poems mentioned above (Warnung des Trewen Eckharts and Die lauter Wahrheit). A selection of 59 Geistliche Lieder was published in Halle, 1853. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nRINGWALDT (Ringwalt, Ringwald), Bartholomäus (1532 - c. 1600), was born November 28, 1532, at Frankfurt a. O. He was ordained in 1557 and was pastor of two parishes before he settled in 1566 as pastor of Langenfeld near Sonnenburg, Brandenburg. He was still there in 1597, but seems to have died there in 1599, or at least not later than 1600. Ringwaldt exerted a considerable influence on his contemporaries as a poet of the people. After 1577 he published various didactic poems, giving a mirror of the times and of the morals of the people. He was one of the most prolific hymn-writers of the sixteenth century. Wackernagel gives 208 pieces under his name, about 165 of which may be called hymns. A selection of 59 as his Geistliche Lieder, with a memoir by H. Wendelbourg, was published at Halle in 1858. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n25, 26, 538\n\nRinkart, Martin, 1586-1649\n\nMartin Rinkart (Rinckart) was born April 23, 1586, in Eilenburg, Saxony. Having completed the course at the Latin school in his home town, he became assistant teacher and chorister in the ThomasSchule at Leipzig. In 1602 he enrolled in the university as a student of theology. In 1610 he sought the office of deacon at Eilenburg and even received the recommendation of the city council. But the superintendent denied his application, apparently on the ground that Rinkart was a better musician than a theologian, but in reality because he did not wish to have as a co-worker one who had been born and raised in the city, and one who had at times shown a rather headstrong disposition. Rinkart, however, received an appointment as teacher and cantor in Eisleben, and a few months later he became deacon of the Church of St. Anna of that city. In 1613 he moved to Erdeborn, and in 1617 the city council of Eilenburg appointed him archdeacon of his native city. During his activity here the Thirty Years’ War broke out and Rinkart, filled with untiring love and selfsacrifice, had to undergo many severe trials. In 1637 a deadly pestilence raged in the city. Eight thousand people perished, and for a long period Rinkart, three times daily, accompanied a dozen or more to the grave. Scarcely was this visitation over when a terrible famine ensued. People were driven to desperate straits, even to the extent of eating the carcasses of dogs and cats. Rinkart faithfully shared his bread with the famished followers that gathered about his home. In 1639 the Swedish general levied a forced contribution of 30,000 thaler upon the city. Rinkart went out to the leader and begged for clemency, but to no avail. When he came back, he gathered the people of the city and said: “Come, dear parishioners, we have not found grace with men; let us beseech God to help us.” The bells tolled for the hour of prayer. The congregation sang “When in the hour of utmost need,” and Rinkart, kneeling, appealed to God in a fervent prayer. This made such a profound impression upon the Swedish commander, that he yielded the greater part of the demand.\n\nRinkart’s people did not seem to appreciate his kindness and faithfulness toward them. He was forced to pay an exorbitant rental for the use of the parsonage, and when soldiers were billeted upon the city, his home was always filled. In addition to all this he was drawn into a long and unjust litigation, which brought him into extreme debt and poverty. The terrible war ended in 1648, and on December 8, 1649, Rinkart passed to his reward.\n\nRinkart did not write many hymns. Only one has been translated into Danish, namely, “Now thank we all our God,” “Nu takker alle Gud,” which appeared in Pontoppidan’s Hymnary, 1740.\n\nRinkart wrote a great deal and was very proficient in music. Many of his works have evidently been lost. Among other productions he wrote spiritual comedies and dramas based upon the events of the Reformation period. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nRINKART (Rinckart), Martin (1586-1649), son of Georg Rinkart or Rinckart, cooper at Eilenburg on the Mulde, Saxony, was born at Eilenburg, April 23, 1586. After passing through the Latin school at Eilenburg, he became, in November of 1601, a foundation scholar and chorister of the St. Thomas’s School at Leipzig. This scholarship also allowed him to proceed to the University of Leipzig, where he matriculated for the summer session of 1602 as a student of theology. After he completed his course, he remained for some time in Leipzig. In March, 1610, Rinkart became a candidate for the post of diaconus at Eilenburg. He was presented by the Town Council, but the Superintendent refused to sanction this arrangement, nominally on the ground that Rinkart was a better musician than theologian, but really because he was unwilling to have as his colleague a native of Eilenburg with a will of his own. Not wishing to contest the matter, Rinkart applied for a vacant mastership at the gymnasium at Eisleben and entered on his duties there in the beginning of June, 1610, as sixth master, and also as cantor of the St. Nicholas Church. After holding this appointment for a few months, Rinkart became diaconus of St. Anne’s Church, in the Neustadt of Eisleben, and began his work there on May 28, 1611. Thereupon he became pastor at Erdeborn and Lyttichendorf in 1613. Finally he was invited by the Town Council of Eilenburg to become archidisconus there, and in November, 1617, he became once again a resident of Eilenburg. Here he died December 8, 1649. A memorial tablet to his memory, affixed to the house where he lived, was unveiled at Eilenburg on Easter Monday, April 26, 1886. Rinkart was a voluminous writer and a good musician. A considerable number of his books seem to have perished; others survive only in single copies. He began to write poetry early and was crowned as a poet apparently in 1614. Among other things he wrote a cycle of seven so-called Comedies, or rather dramas, on the Reformation Period, suggested by the centenary of the Reformation in 1617.

He was a son of Kaspar Rist, Lutheran pastor at Ottensen, and from his birth he had been designated by his parents to be a minister. He began to attend school in Hamburg, and at an early age proved to be a very gifted boy. Having graduated from the Bremen Gymnasium at the age of twenty, he entered the university of Rinteln, where he, under the influence of Josva Stegmann, began to take interest in hymnology. Having completed his work at Rinteln, he became tutor of the sons of a Hamburg merchant, and accompanied them to the university of Rostock, where he studied Hebrew, mathematics, and medicine. [It is claimed by some that he studied also at Leipzig, Utrecht, and Leyden.] At the time of his stay in Rostock, this university was almost deserted on account of the hardships caused by the Thirty Years’ War, and the pestilence kept him in the sick-bed for some length of time. After a sojourn in Hamburg he was engaged as private tutor for a family at Heide, Holstein, and while staying there he was betrothed to Elizabeth Stapfel, a sister of Judge Franz Stapfel. Shortly afterwards he was appointed pastor at Wedel, near Hamburg. In the spring of 1635 he married and settled at Wedel, where he labored until his death, August 31, 1667. Like the rest of his countrymen, Rist had to suffer much from the “famine, plundering, and pestilence” caused by the Thirty Years’ War; but otherwise he enjoyed a happy life at Wedel, devoting his time to his pastoral duties and to the writing of poetry. He was respected and honored by all who learned to know him, and gradually he became very famous. In 1644 he was made poet laureate by Emperor Ferdinand III, and in 1653 was raised to the rank of nobility by the same ruler. Duke Christian of Mecklenburg made him a councillor of his civil and ecclesiastical courts. In 1645 he was admitted as a member of the Pegnitz Order, and in 1647 as a member of the Fruitbearing Society, which had been organized by Opitz and was the most famous poets’ union of that time. In 1660 he became the founder and head of the Elbe Swan Order, which, however, did not survive his death.\n\nSome writers describe Rist as a vain and ambitious man; but this must be refuted, and it also runs counter to the statements of several prominent historians. The fact that he belonged to the poets’ orders of his day and even organized one himself, testifies to his zeal in advancing the cause of poetry, and is by no means a proof that he cherished a vain craving for honor and fame. He has written about 680 hymns and spiritual songs. His hymn-writing embraces or covers, so to speak, the entire field of theology. There are poems for all classes and ranks and for almost all kinds of occasions in human life. Many of his songs are of inferior value and are not suited for church use, nor were they written for that purpose; but many will continue to be among the best church hymns. They are Scriptural, objective, full of Christian faith, and edifying in the best sense of that term. More than 200 of his hymns are said to have been in use in Germany, and many of them have been translated into other languages. The best of his hymns appeared in the following publications: Himlische Lieder, 50 hymns, Lüneburg, 1641, and Leipzig, 1642; Neuer Himlischer Lieder sonderbares Buch, 50 hymns, Lüneburg, 1651; Sabbatische Seelenlust, 58 hymns on the Sunday Gospels; Frommer und gottseliger Christen Alltägliche Hausmusik, 70 hymns, Lüneburg, 1854; Neüe musikalische Fest-Andachten, 52 hymns on the Sunday Gospels; Neüe musikalische Katekismus-Andachten, 50 hymns, Lüneburg, 1656. Among his secular poetry may be mentioned Friedewünschende Teutschland and Friedejauchzende Teutschland, two plays giving vivid pictures of the life and conditions of the common people during the Thirty Years’ War. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nRIST, Johann (1607-1667), was born on March 8, 1607, at Ottensen, near Hamburg, the son of the Rev. Kaspar Rist. From birth he was designated by his parents to be a minister. He attended school in Hamburg and at an early age proved to be a very gifted boy. At twenty Rist graduated from the Gymnasium Illustri at Bremen. Then he entered the University of Rinteln, where, under the influence of Josua Stegmann, he began to take an interest in hymnology.

While he was at Rostock, the University was almost deserted on account of the hardships caused by the Thirty Years War. The pestilence kept Rist in the sickbed for some length of time. After a stay in Hamburg he was engaged as tutor in the house of the lawyer Heinrich Sager of Heide, Holstein. While staying there, Rist was betrothed to Elizabeth Stapfel, a sister of Judge Franz Stapfel, whose influence seems to have had a good deal to do with Rist’s appointment as pastor at Wedel, near Hamburg, shortly afterwards. In the spring of 1635 Rist married and settled at Wedel. He devoted his time to his pastoral duties and to the writing of poetry. Gradually he became famous. In 1644 he was made poet laureate by Emperor Ferdinand m and in 1635 was raised to the rank of nobility by the same ruler.

In 1660 he became the founder and head of the Elbe Swan Order, which, however, did not survive his death on August 31, 1667. Johann Rist was a voluminous and many-sided writer. His secular works are of great interest to the student of the history of the times, and his occasional poems on marriages, etc., to the genealogist and local historian. He wrote about 680 hymns and spiritual songs, covering the entire field of theology. Not all of Rist’s hymns are of equal merit; many are poor and bombastic. But Rist never meant them for public worship, but for private use. Rist excels in his hymns for Advent and for Holy Communion. In general, the hymns of Johann Rist are Scriptural, objective, full of Christian faith, and edifying in the best sense of the word.

He was educated in Leipzig and Wittenberg; later he traveled in France, England, and Holland. On these travels he met Dr. Henry More, Rabbi Meier Stern, and Dr. John Lightfoot, and was induced by them to study alchemy, Oriental languages, and especially Kabbala (the oral tradition of the Jews, transmitted from Adam; the secret wisdom of the Rabbis). [Kabbala means, in this connection, the Jewish mystico-theosophic philosophy of religion; it arose from a desire for a deeper religious consciousness, as mysticism in Christianity.] Through these studies Rosenroth came in touch with Palsgrave Christian August, who in 1668 appointed him prime minister and privy councillor. In 1677 he was created baron by Emperor Leopold I. Rosenroth strove to harmonize the doctrines of Kabbala and Christianity. His monumental work, Kabbala Denudata, Sulzbach, 1677, made him world-famous. He ranks high as a writer of hymns. His hymns were published in 1684 under the title: Neuer Helicon mit seinen neuen Musen, das ist: Geistliche Sitten-Lieder. This volume contained 70 hymns, of which a few are translations from the Latin, others are versions of old German hymns. Sixteen of Rosenroth’s hymns were taken up by Freylinghausen in his hymnal, published in 1704, and again in 1714. The hymnologist Hoch says of Rosenroth’s hymns that they are the product of a noble, pure, and deep mysticist, with a truly poetic sentiment, and a fervent desire for union with Christ. Rosenroth died in 1689. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nROSENROTH, Christian Knorr, Baron von (1636-1689), was born on July 15, 1636, at Altrauden, Silesia, where his father was a pastor. He studied at Stettin, Leipzig, and Wittenberg and continued his studies traveling to Holland, France, and England. On these travels von Rosenroth met Dr. Henry More, Rabbi Meier Stern, and Dr. John Lightfoot. Although he was an ardent seeker after the philosopher’s stone, von Rosenroth found truth and peace only in Christianity. Later he served as pastor in Silesia. He became proficient not only in philosophy and chemistry, but also in theology and cabalistic lore. His memory was so unique that he knew nearly the whole Bible by heart. He died at Sulzback, Bavaria, at the very hour, so it is said, which he himself had predicted, May 8, 1689. He wrote 70 hymns, which show him to be a mystic of the school of Scheffler; they are full of a glowing desire for inner union with God in Christ. He was, indeed, a great scholar and statesman, and his learning led to his being taken into the service of the Palsgrave Christian August of Sulzbach, and that prince made him his prime minister in 1668. He was created a baron by Emperor Leopold I. His greatest pleasure was the study of the Kabbala - the oral tradition of the Jews, supposedly transmitted from Adam; the secret wisdom of the rabbis. He edited rabbinical writings, and his Kabbala Denudata made him world-famous. He strove to harmonize the doctrine of the Kabbala and Christianity. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n75, 84\n\nRoss, Roger R., 1817-99\n\n289\n\nRothe, Johann Andreas, 1688-1758\n\nJohann Andreas Rothe was born in Lissa, near Görlitz, Silesia, May 12, 1688. His father was pastor in Lissa. From the “Gymnasium” of Görlitz and Breslau young Rothe went, 1708, to the university of Leipzig to study theology. Following the final examinations he accepted a position as private tutor in the family of von Schweidnitz, near Görlitz. He preached frequently in the neighboring churches, and at one time Count N. L. von Zinzendorf happened to hear him and was so favorably impressed with the young man that he called him as pastor of Berthelsdorf in 1722. He was installed on August 30, 1722. His field included also the congregation of the Moravian Brethren of Herrnhut. Rothe’s firm stand in matters pertaining to the Church together with his fearlessness over against Zinzendorf finally brought on a break between the two. When Rothe was requested to report to the church authorities concerning Zinzendorf’s doctrine and practice, the latter was highly incensed, and Rothe resigned and accepted a call to Hermsdorf, near Görlitz. In 1739 he moved to Thommendorf, near Bunzlau, and labored there until his death, July 6, 1758.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Rothe in the beginning of his activity was greatly influenced by Zinzendorf, his colleague, as he was, on the whole, in sympathy with the Pietistic tendencies. This is especially apparent in his hymn writing and has rather enhanced the value of his hymn poetry. Whereas his forty or more church hymns are of a churchly character, they are all permeated by a marked sincerity and depth of feeling which characterizes the best productions of Zinzendorf and the Pietistic school. Later he approached more and more the strict and orthodox Lutheranism. For this reason also Zinzendorf failed in his attempt to again enlist Rothe’s services in the Moravian Church. Rothe is described as an able theologian, a fearless witness for truth, and a prominent preacher. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nROTHE, Johann Andreas (1688-1758), son of the Rev. Ägidius Rothe, was born at Lissa, May 12, 1688. As student of theology he graduated from the University of Leipzig; in 1712 he was licensed at Görlitz as a general preacher. Count von Zinzendorf heard him preach and later gave him a pastorate at Berthelsdorf (August 30, 1722). In 1737 Zinzendorf was displeased with Rothe’s doctrinal views; so Rothe accepted a call to Hermsdorf, near Görlitz, where he became minister in 1737. In 1739 he became assistant pastor at Thommendorf, near Bunzlau, where in 1742 he was made chief pastor and remained there until his death on July 6, 1758. His hymns number about 40. Though they do not rank high as poetry, yet they are characterized by glow and tenderness of feeling and by depth of Christian experience. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n499\n\nRung, Henrik, 1807-71, composer, born 31 March 1807 in Copenhagen, died the same place 12 December 1871. His childhood was in Næstved, where his father was toll-collector; in his younger years he studied the guitar, but first later he attained a real artistic development from his musical abilities (under L. Zinck and Weyse). Some years he was contrabassist in the royal chapel, but it was first in 1837 when he performed as composer of the music for “Svend Dyrings Hus” that he became known to a greater public. A number of years Rung lived as a real artist’s life in Italy in the Thorvaldsen circle and studied old Italian music; later he set himself to studying the art of singing in Paris. In 1842 Rung was installed as song-master at the royal theater and was at that tie a very much employed, productive theater composer for various plays and operas, of which non continue in the repertoire. His talent was a real lyric character, and his significance therefore came at being a composer of some romances, some hymn-melodies and folk-style songs. The fresh, natural melody and the folk-like knack in his songs brought them a significant dissemination. As a hymn composer Rung came through P. O. Bojsen in connection with the Vartov congregation and wrote for it his most famous melodies for “Krist stod op af Døde”, “Alt staar I Guds Faderhaand”, “Tag det sorte kors fra Graven”, “Rejs op dit Hoved al Kristenhed”, the baptism hymn “O, lad din Aand”, “Lad det klinge sødt i Sky” etc. By their folk-like power they penetrated strongly, and at the same time they established a successful artistic moment against the musical democratism rampant in Vartov singing. On 29 October 1851 Rung founded the Cecilia Society, which was to work for familiarity with classical Italian church music, and thus reached its goal in a model society which in great style has accomplished the work of make older church music known here at home. A bitter literary feud which struck him through the years, he carried on with 50 (in “Fædrelandet” and “Dansk Kirketidende”) against Berggreen (in “Berl. Tid.” and “Evang. Ugeskr.”) regarding Berggreen’s new chorale-book and its lack of reverence for the old Weyse chorale-book. Rung collected his own melodies and Vartov-melodies in 1857 into a so-called “Supplement to Weyse’s Chorale-Book”, originally 50 melodies, among them those by Gade, Hartmann, Barnekow, and others.

The son received his early education in St. Savior’s School of Southwark and the Merchant Taylors’ School of London. In 1822 he came to Manchester College, York, and completed his education in St. John’s College, Cambridge. Here he received a prize for his treatise, The Law Our School-Master to Bring Us to Christ. In 1829 he was ordained by the bishop of Lincoln, and from 1830 to 1852 he served as vicar of Caxton, Cambridge. During this period he wrote extensively on theological themes. About 1840 he published Hymn Tunes, Original and Selected. Many of his original hymns, together with translations from the German, appeared in Hymns for Public Worship, 1848, Dalston Hospital, London. In 1847 Christian Life was published, and in 1851 his edition of Psalms and Hymns. His original hymns and translations have been included in several hymnals. A great number of them appeared in Dr. B. H. Kennedy’s Hymnologia Christiana, 1863. He has also composed melodies which are in use. His hymn poems are characterized by religious fervor and deep piety. He wrote in all upwards of 140 hymns.

In 1829 Russell was ordained by the Bishop of Lincoln and served first as curate of Great Gransden and was then preferred to the Vicarage of Caxton, where he remained until 1852, when he went to the Vicarage of Whaddon, Cambridgeshire. Russell left there in 1866 for St. Thomas’s, Toxteth Park, Liverpool. The following year he was at Wrockwardine Wood, Shropshire, where he stayed until 1874 when he was presented to the Rectory of Southwick, near Brighton. Here Russell died after a long and distressing illness on November 18, 1874. Russell started his ecclesiastical life as an extreme high churchman, but through the study of Saint Augustine his views were changed, and he became and continued until his end a moderate Calvinist. He was a prolific writer. His best prose work appeared in 1859 under the title Memorials of the Life and Works of Bishop Andrewes. His hymnological works include: Hymn-Tunes, Original and Selected, from Ravenscroft and other old Musicians, c. 1840; Hymns for Public Worship, 1848, which contained some of his own hymns, original and translated from the German. In 1851 Russell published Psalms and Hymns, partly original, partly selected, for the use of the Church of England. He wrote 140 hymns; they are characterized as gracious and tender, thoughtful and devout. His translations are vigorous and strong.

At the age of 20 he entered the University of Jena, where he studied philosophy and law for four years. He served two years as secretary to von Platen, privy counsellor of Berlin. Later he served as tutor for a few young noblemen until 1665, when he entered military service as regimental secretary under the commander of Lüneburg and served also as ensign for a time., In 1667 he left the service and went to Kiel to present himself for the final examination for the degree of doctor of jurisprudence. First, however, he made a journey into Holland and Denmark in company with a number of students from Holstein. In 1670 he located as a lawyer in Brunswick. The following year he was granted his doctor’s degree, and in 1683 removed to Wolfenbüttel, where he became lawyer of the exchequer. In 1690 he was appointed counsellor of the exchequer. As a lawyer and statesman he became noted for conscientious work and was so unselfish in his practice that he would handle the court cases of poor people without pay; in a number of cases he even assisted in paying the costs. He died September 8, 1699, in Wolfenbüttel. He expressed the desire that his funeral sermon should be preached upon Psalm 73:23-24: “Nevertheless I am continually with Thee: Thou hast holden my right hand. Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.”\n\nSacer began to write poems at an early age. In 1660 he was accepted as a member of the “Order of the Elbe Swans” and was later presented with the wreath of laurels by the emperor himself. “A more beautiful wreath, however, was the one woven by himself: the 65 hymns which he wrote” (Skaar). His hymns are among the best of the period immediately following Gerhardt. They are permeated with a warmth of poetic feeling; they are thoroughly Scriptural and noted for their euphony of expression. Landstad’s Hymn Book contains three of Sacer’s hymns: No. 169, “Igjennem Tidens Plager”; No. 439, “Den Idræt Gud er tackkelig”; No. 634, “Kom, Menneske, at skue mig.” Sacer’s hymns were compiled and published by his son-in-law under the title Geistliche Liebliche Lieder, Gotha, 1714. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nSACER, Gottfried Wilhelm (1635-1699), judged by many to be one of the greatest hymnists immediately following the Gerhardt period, was born on July 11, 1635, in Naumberg, Saxony, where his father was senior burgomaster. At the age of twenty he entered the University of Jena as a student of philosophy and law. He held the office of secretary to the privy counselor at Berlin for two years and also served as tutor to some young noblemen until 1665, when he entered military service, first as regimental secretary and later as ensign. Two years later he left the service, planning to apply for the degree of doctor of jurisprudence at Kiel. Before this came about, he toured Holland and Denmark with some young Holstein noblemen. In 1670 he was a lawyer in Brunswick, receiving his degree in the following year. In 1683 he went to Wolfenbüttel to become lawyer of the exchequer; here he was appointed counselor of the exchequer in 1690. He earned a fine reputation as lawyer and statesman, being very unselfish and conscientious, handling the cases of the poor without pay and sometimes even assisting in paying costs. He died September 8, 1699, at Wolfenbüttel. Sacar showed poetic ability at an early age and was made a member of the poetical Order of Elbe Swans in 1660. He is often described as the “Kayserlicher Poet,” for he had been crowned with a wreath of laurels by the Emperor of Austria himself. He wrote 65 hymns; they were published in 1714 by his son-in-law under the title Geistliche Liebliche Lieder. They can be characterized as having poetic glow, dramatic force, euphony of expression, Scriptural content, and excellent style.

Sarum plainsong\n\n10, 108, 273\n\nSavonarola, Girolamo, 1454-98\n\nGirolamo Savonarola was born 1454, in Italy. He became a member of the Dominican Order of Friars. In Florence (Firenze) he appeared as a preacher of repentance. With fiery zeal he attacked the ungodliness and licentiousness of his times, and multitudes of people came to hear his impressive sermons. “The Church must be regenerated. The punishment from God will fall upon Italy and the whole world. The ministers of God busy themselves only with the outward ceremonies. The inner worship of God, they know not.” Pope Alexander sought to win him over by the promise of a cardinal’s hat, but to no avail. “I desire no hat but that of the martyr, dyed in my own blood.” Thereupon the pope ordered him to cease preaching. Soon after Savonarola resumed his preaching more vigorously than before, because he v.as personally convinced that he was sent by God. The pope placed him under the ban, but even that did not frighten him. He called the pope an atheist and appealed to the rulers of Europe to convoke a council to depose the shameful incumbent of the chair of St. Peter. Savonarola was executed in 1498. He must be regarded as one of the important forerunners of the Reformation.\n\nSavonarola found his spiritual songs to be of great help in furthering his cause. Florence was at that time ruled by Lorenzo di Medici, who wrote many frivolous ballads which he called Canti Carnascialeschi (Carnival Songs) to be sung during the carnivals. To counteract the influence of these ballads, Savonarola wrote spiritual songs in the same meter and set to the same tunes. At an earlier period he had written poems on the subjects of Doomsday, the Decadent Condition of the Church, and, as a supplement to a treatise on the Love of Christ, he wrote a number of hymns entitled: Laude e Contemplazioni infiammative (Inspiring Hymns of Meditation and Praise). Savonarola’s hymns have been severely criticized by many scholars. Italian critics say that his hymns are poorly worked out and unsuited for church use. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nSAVONAROLA, Girolemo (1454-1498), was born in Italy. Becoming a Dominican Friar, he appeared as a preacher of repentance in Florence, fearlessly attacking the ungodliness and licentiousness of the times. Pope Alexander vainly sought to win him over by the promise of a cardinal’s hat. The Pope finally ordered him to cease preaching, but Savonarola, personally convinced that he was sent by God, preached all the more vigorously. He was placed under the papal ban, but even this did not avail. Savonarola called the Pope an atheist and appealed to the rulers of Europe to convoke a council to depose the shameful incumbent of the papal chair. But the ecclesiastical and secular courts decided that Savonarola should be hanged and afterwards burnt. This sentence was executed on May 23, 1498, and so Savonarola met his death as a martyr. He must be regarded as one of the important forerunners of the Reformation. His spiritual songs helped to further his reform movement. He wrote them in the same meter and set them to the same tunes as the frivolous carnival songs of Lorenzo de Medici. Yet Lorenzo de Medici thought so much of Savonarola that he asked him to come to his death-bed and hear his confession.

He took up his studies in Wittenberg in 1550 and became one of Melanchthon’s favorite pupils. He was also an intimate friend of Selnecker. Having received his M. A. degree, he lectured for a time in Wittenberg, and in 1554 was called to the office of diaconus of Regensburg. In a short time, however, he incurred the displeasure of Bishop Gallus, who favored the teachings of Mathias Flacius. When Schalling in his sermons attacked Flacius, he was compelled to resign, in 1558. He was called to Amberg, but was again compelled to resign, this time because of his opposition to the Calvinistic views of Elector Friedrich III. Friedrich’s son, the later Elector Ludwig of Saxony, who was a Lutheran, recalled Schalling to Amberg in 1576 and made him court preacher and superintendent. After Friedrich’s death, the same year, he was made general superintendent of Oberphalz and court preacher of Heidelberg. A few years later, however, he fell from grace with the elector and had to resign his office, this time because he declined to accept the Formula of Concord, for the reason that this document, in his opinion, contained unjust attacks upon the followers of Melanchthon.
