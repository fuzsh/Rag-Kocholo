        "text": "We just can’t wait for Usher to take on the Super Bowl Halftime Show this Sunday! The “Yeah!” singer has been in the industry since he was barely a teenager and has been a star ever since. The eight-time Grammy-winning artist has had many ups and a few downs in his career but has managed to mostly stay on top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is the evolution of the beloved Usher Raymond IV.\n\nIn 2001, he began dating Chili from TLC, but they broke up in 2004. Fans suspected that his album “Confessions” touched on the issues he might have experienced in his relationship with her, but he denied those rumors. The pair dated off and on through the years, but Chili was officially over him in 2019.\n\nThe year 2004 was one of the biggest in Usher’s career. This was the year that the “Confessions” album was released — it was his first chart-topping album, selling more than one million copies in one week. The album features “My Boo” with Alicia Keys and the hit “Yeah” featuring Lil’ Jon and Ludacris.\n\nOne month later, Usher Raymond V was in a pool incident while under the watch of his aunt. Foster began a legal battle alleging her ex-husband wasn’t fit to take care of their two children. The judge ruled in the Grammy winner’s favor, allowing him to keep custody of the children.\n\nIn 2013, Usher became a coach on season 4 of the singing competition show “The Voice” alongside Shakira, Blake Shelton and Adam Levine. He returned for season six, in which one of the contestants on his team won the show."
