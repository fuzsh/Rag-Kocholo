        "text": "Personal Oddities\n\nManchester City and England goalkeeper Jim Mitchell is the only man to play for England while wearing spectacles, doing so in 1924 when capped against Ireland. He also played in the 1922 FA Cup Final for West Bromwich Albion wearing his specs.\n\nSheffield United's first ever goalkeeper was a bespectacled fellow by the name of Charlie Howlett.\n\nAnother keeper who played in his glasses was Swiss goalie Markus Schluepp, who played for St. Gallen in the late '70s/early '80s.\n\nFormer Millwall and Northern Ireland goalkeeper Ted Hinton used to keep his false teeth at the back of his net.\n\nNewcastle United and Celtic goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson took great delight in telling the press how he kept his false teeth safe during games by rolling them in a handkerchief and putting them in his cap in the back of the net.\n\nQueen of the South goalkeeper Willie Fotheringham actually left his false teeth in the back of his net following a game away to Arbroath. The gnashers were returned via a fish delivery lorry the following week.\n\nAfter losing the sight of one eye in a car accident, Gordon Banks retired from the professional game but went on to play in the odd charity and exhibition match as well as spending a season in the North American Soccer League.\n\nThe oldest player ever to play a competitive game in England was New Brighton's Neil McBain, who turned out against Hartlepools United in a Division Three (North) game in 1947 at the ripe old age of 51 years and 120 days. McBain was New Brighton's manager and had to play as an emergency goalkeeper, almost 32 years to the day since he made his professional debut.\n\nFormer England international Dave Beasant was named as one of Stevenage Borough's substitutes during their league game against Carlisle United in October, 2014 at the tender age of 55.\n\nIn 1964, Sunderland goalkeeper Derek Foster became the youngest person to play in the First Division when he made his debut against Leicester City at the age of 15 years and 185 days.\n\nThe oldest player ever to appear in a World Cup Final was Italy's goalkeeper and captain, Dino Zoff, who played in the 1982 final in Spain aged 40 years, 4 months and 13 days.\n\nAt the age of 38 years and 232 days, Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann became the oldest player ever to appear in the European Championship final when Germany lost to Spain in 2008.\n\nEgypt goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary becamse the oldest player ever to compete in the World Cup finals when he lined up against Saudi Arabia at the age of 45 in their group clash at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, marking his appearance by saving a first half penalty. El-Hadary broke the record set by Colombia's Faryd Mondragón, who made a substitute appearance at the 2014 Finals in a game against Japan at the tender age of 43 years and 3 days.\n\nIn January 2013, former Spanish international and Manchester United goalkeeper Ricardo came out of retirement to rejoin Osasuna after back-up keeper Asier Riesgo suffered a foot injury. Later that year he played against Real Madrid at the age of 41, becoming La Liga's oldest ever player in the process.\n\nCittadella keeper Andrea Pierobon holds the record for being the oldest professional player in the history of Italian football, having surpassed the previous record holder, fellow goalkeeper Marco Ballotta, in May. Pierobon is still going strong at the age of 45 in Italy's Serie B.\n\nIn April 2010, Dundee's Bobby Geddes replaced Tony Bullock in goal during a game against Raith Rovers after Bullock was forced off with a hamstring injury. Geddes was 49-years-old at the time.\n\nLegendary Baggies Keeper John Osborne apparently had a plastic knuckle - but this didn't prevent him from winning the FA and League Cup with West Brom during the 1960s.\n\nBulgarian International and former Reading 'keeper Borislav Mihaylov gained notoriety during the 1994 World Cup Finals in the United States when he suddenly appeared with a full head of hair having been completely bald on top only weeks before. It turned out that he had decided to wear a wig to help promote his toupee company back home (During the Quarter Final game against Mexico, the poor man had to adjust his hairpiece under the protection of a towel after the blazing sun had caused him to sweat just a little too profusely…)\n\nProbably the most instantly recognisable international goalkeeper of recent times was Faeroe Islands' goalie Martin Knudsen, who nearly used to always wear a bobble hat when he played.\n\nIn a similar vein, Hungarian goalkeeper Gábor Király always wears a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms rather than shorts when he plays.\n\nPeterborough United goalkeeper Fred Barber used to run out onto the pitch wearing a Freddie Kruger mask from the film Nightmare on Elm Street. When The Posh reached Wembley in the play-off finals he was politely told it was not the done thing to do at the home of football but wore it anyway.\n\nFormer Glasgow Rangers and Scotland goalkeeper Andy Goram suffered from schizophrenia in the latter part of his career.\n\nUS international Tim Howard suffers from Tourette's Syndrome.\n\nTom Farquharson, Cardiff City's keeper in their 1927 FA Cup triumph, apparently always carried a hand gun with him!\n\nDutch goalkeeper Edwin Zoetebier used to bring his own lunch with him when he was with Feyenoord, which consisted of smoked fish, a speciality he first savoured when he was living in the seaside town of Volendam.\n\nTurkish keeper Rüstü Reçber applies a thick layer of black charcoal under his eyes for almost every game, claiming that it helps block out the glare from stadium floodlights.\n\nTo celebrate winning his 50th international cap, Wales goalkeeper Paul Jones decided a trip to the barber's was in order and emerged from the players' tunnel sporting a \"50\" on either side with a Welsh dragon at the back. Unfortunately for Jones, he had a nightmare between the sticks as Slovakia ran out 5-1 winners in Cardiff.\n\nBefore the start of each half, Blackburn Rovers keeper Jason Brown performs a ritual that involves resting his head against each of his posts in turn, with his eyes closed and his hands in front of him as if in prayer.\n\nBrazilian goalkeeper Carlos José Castilho was colour-blind and often had trouble picking out white balls during night games.\n\nHaving grown tired of continually being overlooked by successive England managers - despite a string of impressive performances - West Ham United's Robert Green decided to make point when the Hammers played Birmingham City in February 2008 by wearing a pair of gloves with \"England's number 6\" emblazoned across them.\n\nFormer American international Alan Mayer used to wear an ice hockey-style helmet when he kept goal during the 1970s.\n\nNed Doig, who kept goal for Sunderland, Liverpool and Scotland at the end of the 19th Century, always wore a cap when playing to hide his baldness.\n\nWhen former Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Milija Aleksic began his career, he was so keen that he used to iron his bootlaces before playing.\n\nSteve Ogrizovic was told he had to give up the fags if he wanted one final contract with Coventry City while the club were still in the top flight, which he duly did.\n\nFor reasons best known to himself, Saint-Etienne goalkeeper Jeremie Janot decided to don a Spider-man outfit in 2005 for a game against FC Istres and yes, that did include the mask...\n\nFormer Aldershot, Tottenham and Southampton keeper Ron Reynolds was reputedly one of the first professional footballers ever to wear contact lenses.\n\nAustralia's Mark Schwarzer has worn the same pair of shinpads since he was six years old.\n\nBlackburn Athletic and Bradford Park Avenue goalkeeper Chick Farr was born with Syndactyly (webbed fingers).\n\nFormer West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Jimmy Sanders used to wear his 1954 FA Cup Winners medal around his neck when serving behind the bar of his pub after he retired from football.\n\nAirdrieonians keeper John Martin would often swing from the crossbar during games if supporters behind his goal asked him too!\n\nAberdeen's Harry Blackwell wore a waterproof coat and took to the field with an umbrella borrowed from a spectator in the inclement weather when Aberdeen beat Peterhead 13-0.\n\nOne-time Celtic and Portsmouth goalkeeper Dick Beattie was a horse-racing fan and used to wear a jockey's cap when in goal.\n\nTony Chursky, who kept goal for Seattle Sounders and Canada in the 1970s, was deaf in one ear as is Ajax, Fulham and Netherlands international Maarten Stekelenburg.\n\nNamibia international goalkeeper Athiel Mbaha has been deaf since the age of seven and apparently communicates with his teammates by screaming at them.\n\nWigan Athletic's Chris Kirkland was the last top-flight goalkeeper to wear a baseball cap to keep the sun out of his eyes, doing so during a game against West Ham United back in 2009.\n\nFormer Southampton and Aldershot goalkeeper Tony Godfrey holds the distinction of being Basingstoke Town's youngest and oldest player. Having turned out for The Dragons while still a schoolboy, he returned for one game in 1985 at the age of 45 after an injury crisis left the club without a keeper.\n\nHungary's Gábor Király became the oldest player to appear in the finals of the European Championships when he turned out against Austria in the Magyars' opening game of 2016 at the age of 40 years and 75 days, beating the record held by Lothar Matthäus.\n\nWhen Sander Boschker finally made his international debut for the Netherlands in 2010 at the age of 39, he became his country's oldest ever debutant and capped player.\n\nAC Milan's Gianluigi Donnarumma became the youngest ever goalkeeper to start a match in the history of Italian football when he turned out for against Sassuolo at the age of 16 years and 8 months.\n\nBengt Andersson shows no signs of retiring from football just yet. The former Sweden international goalkeeper recently joined Särö IK on a semi-professional basis and has form in this department. One of the oldest players to have appeared in the Allsvenskan, he won the Swedish league title with IFK Göteborg for the first time at the tender age of 41, become the oldest player to do so in the process.\n\nIndian goalkeeper Shilton Paul was named after England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. His dad was a big fan.\n\nAyr United goalkeeper Hugh Sproat admitted to Shoot! magazine in 1977 that he was such a fan of Punk Rock that he regularly wore earrings shaped like razor blades - one was green, the other blue in a nod to the auld firm...\n\nWhen Arbroath famously beat Bon Accord 36-0 in the Scottish Cup back in 1885, their goalkeeper, Jim Milne Sr, was apparently such a spectator that he smoked his pipe during the game.\n\nThere were many tales about former Queen's Park and Hearts goalkeeper Jim Cruickshank, most of which were probably apocryphal. However, one of the most frequent stories shared about the goalie was habit of walking onto the field of play with a transistor radio hidden in his towel, which was placed carefully beside the post and occasionally adjusted during lulls in play so he could tune into the horse racing from various circuits around the country.\n\nIn the early 90s, West Ham United goalkeeper Ludek Miklosko received a compliment of sorts when Hammers fan Danny Noise changed his name by deed poll to Danny Miklosko in honour of the Czech stopper.\n\nDutch goalkeeper Diederik Boer enjoyed a successful career with PEC Zwolle despite missing the little finger of his right hand, meaning he plays with only 9 fingers.\n\nSweden international and former Chelsea Ladies goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl suffers from vitiligo and has to apply high factor sunscreen before and during matches.\n\nFormer Dundee United goalkeeper Luis Zwick, who also had spells with Hansa Rostock and Schweinfurt 05, suffered from epilepsy as a child.\n\nDenmark's Henry From was the epitome of cool when he faced a penalty in the semi-finals of the 1960 Olympic football tournament against Hungary. With his team leading 1-0, From readied himself for the spot kick by removing his chewing gum and sticking it to the side of his goalposts. After he saved Pal Varhidi's shot, he pciked the chewing gum off the post and put it back his mouth, with Denmark going on to win the game 2-0.\n\nUnited States international goalkeeper Ruth Harker was blind in her left eye.\n\nBirmingham City, Hibernian and Scotland goalkeeper Jim Herriot used to smear dollops of mud from his goalmouth under his eyes before a game to combat the glare from floodlights, especially during midweek games.\n\nRoma's Francesco Quintini was reputedly the shortest goalkeeper to play in Serie A, standing at a height of just 1.68 m (5 ft 6 in).\n\nFormer Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers Ladies goalkeeper Danielle Gibbons was rendered deaf in her left ear following surgery in 2015 to remove a vestibular schwannoma.\n\nScottish goalkeeper Andy Greig, who enjoyed a career with Aberdeen, Darlington and Montrose either side of World War One, was born deaf.\n\nSuperstitious Goalkeepers\n\nFormer Wales international and Stoke City goalkeeper Leigh Richmond Roose was famously superstitious and always wore a lucky shirt beneath his goalkeeping jersey - an old black-and-green Aberystwyth top, was reputedly never washed.\n\nFormer Canadian international and Minnesota Kicks goalkeeper Tino Lettieri used to keep a lucky mascot in the form of a stuffed parrot called 'Ozzie' at the back of his net during games.\n\nSomething of a superstitious chap, former Scotland international Alan Rough always carried an old tennis ball and a key ring with a thistle motif on it to the ground with him and insisted on having a shave on the morning of every match. He always had to hang his clothes on peg No 13 too...\n\nAnother keeper with a superstitious streak in him was former Manchester United and England goalie Gary Bailey. The one-time Old Trafford custodian readily admits to using juju - an African form of black magic - during his spell with South African side Kaiser Chiefs. There must have been something in it as they won every domestic trophy while Bailey was in goal.\n\nAberdeen's Bobby Clark attributed his side's victory in the Scottish League Cup during the 1976/77 season to the white tie he wore with his match-day suit before every round, up to and including the final. Clark, a notoriously superstitious keeper, refused to change his tie during the competition, saying that it brought his side luck!\n\nThe much travelled former England goalkeeper David James has many pre-match superstitious rituals, probably the most disturbing of which is the need to spit on the walls of the changing room urinals before games.\n\nArgentina's Sergio Goycochea developed an equally disturbing superstitious ritual during the 1990 World Cup Finals, namely urinating on the pitch before his side's penalty shoot-outs against Yugoslavia and Italy. It must have worked as Argentina won on both occasions to reach the final.\n\nGhana international Robert Mensah was something of a flamboyant goalkeeper who would often mock opponents by reading a newspaper while the game was in full flow. He was also prone to wearing an over-size flat cap during games in attempt to put strikers off and he'd often get into scraps when opposition players tried to remove it, believing it was bringing them bad luck through the use of juju.\n\nAnother Ghana goalkeeper with a lucky charm is Brimah Razak, who carried his favourite Spider-man action figure onto the pitch with him during the 2015 African Cup of Nations. Ghana reached the final but the comic book hero was powerless to prevent Razak from missing the decisive penalty in the shoot-out against the Ivory Coast in the final.\n\nWhen former England international Reg Davies visited Bisham Abbey with Brian Clough's Derby County for a training session in the late 1960s, he refused to enter the building after being unnerved by a \"ghostly vibe\" that he picked up following the team's arrival.\n\nPior to every game he competed in, Irish keeper Shay Given, who enjoyed a successful career with Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United among others, would place a vial of holy water from Lourdes at the back of his goal as a lucky charm.\n\nAnother Irish goalkeeper with a superstitious habit was Celtic custodian Packie Bonner, who carried a piece of clay from County Donegal with him in his glove bag.\n\nWhen Scotland played in the 1978 World Cup finals in Argentina, goalkeeper Alan Rough took with him a good luck message from a Blue Peter viewer who won a competition on the programme and placed it in his net at the start of every game.\n\nJack Robinson, who played eleven times for England at the turn of the 20th Century and enjoyed spells with Lincoln City, Derby County and Millwall among others, was something of a superstitious chap and insisted on having a bowl of rice pudding before every game. There may have been something in it because the one time he failed to have his lucky pre-match meal, he was beaten eleven times!\n\nBristol Rovers goalkeeper Herbert Hoyle had a liking for oranges and apparently always placed one at the back of his net for good luck.\n\nIker Casillas is a rather superstitious goalkeeper. Among his many quirks is the need to touch his own crossbar whenever his team scored. However, one of Casillas' oddest rituals was when he wore his socks inside out on the advice of a gypsy prison inmate. He carried on doing so until manager Jose Mourinho benched him!\n\nFormer Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina developed a couple of pre-match rituals during his time at Anfield. Before every game he used to fill his car up with petrol at the same service station - even if he didn't need to - and insisted on parking in bay 39 in the players' car park at the ground.\n\nDuring UEFA Euro 2012, the Czech Republic squad decided not to shave, believing to do so would bring bad luck. Such was their commitment that goalkeeper Petr Čech refused to get out his razor even when his wife told him he looked awful and should have a shave!\n\nSpartak Moscow goalkeeper Artem Rebrov kisses his goalposts before each game.\n\nBefore found international fame at the 1990 World Cup finals, Colombia goalkeeper Rene Higuita visited a fortune teller with Atletico Nacional teammate Carlos Perea in a bid to improve their form, who advised them that their fortunes would change if the team wore blue belts and underparts. Having taken the advice on board, the club went on to win the Copa Libertadores in 1989.\n\nWest Ham goalkeeper Adrian sought a bit of luck before his side's London derby against Chelsea during the 2017/18 season and thought rubbing the head of Argentine teammate Pablo Zabaleta during training sessions would do the job. The ritual earned the goalkeeper a bit of publicity, with the Spaniard telling journalists that rubbing a bald head is supposed to bring good luck but it didn't work as he was dropped in favour of England goalkeeper Joe Hart. The match ended 1-1.\n\nEvery time Barcelona score a goal, their keeper, German Marc-André ter Stegen, takes a quick drink from his water bottle, positioned at the side of his net.\n\nBelgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois performs the same ritual prior to international games during the playing of his country's national anthem, La Brabanconne. While singing along to the anthem, Courtois touches his chin for good luck!\n\nBorussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki has to touch the match ball before the game kicks off, sometimes going to extreme measures, including taking the ball off of mascots, in order to do so.\n\nCoventry and Manchester City goalkeeper Perry Suckling kept a bible in the back of his net for good luck.\n\nFormer Leicester City and Bournemouth goalkeeper Ian Andrews was a creature of habit and always put his left boot on first before a match.\n\nBack in 1996, when Rafael Benitez's tenure at Real Valladolid was under threat, his kit man placed some garlic behind the goal of Valencia goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta hoping to bring him some bad luck. It seemed to work as the former Spanish goalkeeper had to be replaced before the game after he was injured during the warm-up. Unfortunately for Benitez and his kit man, the in-coming Jorge Bartual played a blinder, winning the Man of the Match award as Valencia triumphed 5-2.\n\nDuring is spell at Maine Road, Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Corrigan began to receive a sprig of lucky heather before every home game from flower seller and City fan Helen Turner, with the pair captured for posterity in the 1981 Topical Times Football Book performing the ritual.\n\nFormer Scotland and Norwich City goalkeeper Bryan Gunn had an interesting pre-match ritual while he was with Aberdeen; he would attempt to head-butt the crossbar, much to the amusement of manager Alex Ferguson.\n\nManchester United's David de Gea has an in-match ritual where he touches his crossbar every time his teammates score a goal.\n\nGoalkeeper Nicknames\n\nThe Black Octopus -

former French international Dominique Dropsy and his son Damien.\n\nBack in the 1980s, schoolboys around England had a good laugh or two at the expense of Brighton & Hove Albion's Perry Digweed and Crystal Palace's Perry Suckling.\n\nEgypt's goalkeeper in their only game of the 1934 World Cup was Mustafa Kamel Mansour, who later played for Queen's Park while studying in Scotland.\n\nIn 1964 Darlington signed the delightfully named Ray Snowball from non-league Crook Town.\n\nKeeping with the winter theme, York City signed Jack Frost from Grimsby Town in 1948 after he was \"frozen out\" at Blundell Park.\n\nPort Vale and Middlesbrough had a goalkeeper on their books called Joe Frail, who was once suspended by Vale after he missed a train to a match against Rotherham United and failed to give a suitable reason as to why.\n\nChelsea once signed a goalkeeper called Les Fridge, who only played once for the Blues in a 5-1 defeat against Watford. He later enjoyed a career north of the boarder with St. Mirren and Clyde among others.\n\nNASL side Chicago Sting once signed a keeper called Paul Coffee.\n\nThere can't be many goalkeepers named after a United States president but Belize international Woodrow Wilson West is certainly one of them.\n\nBelgian goalkeeper Cyprien Baguette earned his \"crust\" between the sticks for Charleroi and FC Brussels.\n\nKeeping it in the Family\n\nSpurs and England goalie Ian Walker's Dad Mike used to keep goal for Colchester United back in the Seventies. Mike tried to buy his son during his first spell in charge of Norwich City.\n\nMidfielders Stephen Clemence and Sam Shilton decided not to follow in their fathers' footsteps and battle it out for the England No1 spot like their dads, Ray and Peter, did in the late 70s/early 80s. They both opted for a career in the middle of the park instead, although Stephen was once forced to play in goal for Birmingham City after Nico Vassen was sent off.\n\nPeter Schmeichel's son Kasper followed in his father's footsteps, signing pro-forms with Manchester City before enjoying a career with Leicester City and Leeds United among others.\n\nDad Bobby may have played for Wales and been manager of the Welsh side at the time but when it came to his own International career Celtic keeper Jonathon Gould opted to play for Scotland instead, receiving a call-up to the Scottish World Cup Squad in 1998 following Andy Goram's departure.\n\nBirmingham City once boasted brothers Bob and Dave Latchford in their line-up. Centre forward Bob later found fame and fortune with Everton and England while their brother, Peter, who also happened to be a goalkeeper like Dave, went to Scotland and won an awful lot of trophies with Celtic.\n\nFormer Glasgow Rangers and England goalkeeper Chris Woods' great uncle was none other than Eric Houghton, one of the first stars of the modern game between the wars.\n\nOnly one set of goalkeeping brothers have ever been part of the same World Cup squad.

Jimmy even captained his country when Wales played England between the years 1895-97.\n\nGoalkeeping ran strong in the Springett family. Ron was capped thirty-three times by England, keeping seven clean sheets along the way, and was part of the 1966 World Cup winning squad while brother Peter was an England Under-23 International.\n\nEngland also capped goalkeeping cousins Harold Pearson and Harry Hibbs. Pearson's father Hubert was also a goalkeeper and was picked to play for England against France in 1923 but missed the match through injury and was never selected again.\n\nEngland and Nottingham Forest liked to keep it in the family at the turn of the century. Goalkeeper Harry Linacre played alongside his brothers-in-law Frank and Frederick Forman while at Forest and all three were capped by England, albeit in separate games.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland also like to keep it in the family.

Their father, Alan Snr, was also a goalkeeper and played for Preston North End.\n\nEngland goalkeepers Billy Moon and Teddy Taylor both had relatives who played Test cricket for England. In Moon's case it was his brother Leonard while Charlie Hallows was Taylor's cousin.\n\nFormer England and Nottingham Forest full back Jim Iremonger was a tall bloke but his brother Albert, who played for Notts County, was taller. At 6' 5\", Albert was one of the tallest goalkeepers ever to play League football. He also scored an own goal after taking a penalty at the opposite end of the pitch...\n\nFormer Spurs and England keeper Ted Ditchburn's father was once a champion boxer.\n\nReg Birkett, the first football international to play rugby union for England, came from a strong rugby playing family. Both his son and his brother were also rugby union internationals.\n\nBalding Bulgarian goalie and former Reading 'keeper Borislav Mihaylov followed in his father's footsteps when he went between the sticks. His Dad kept goal for the national side during the 1960s while his son, Nikolay, made it a hattrick of international keepers when he made his debut for Bulgaria in 2006.\n\nWolves' Michael Oakes father is former Manchester City defender Alan Oakes. Michael's cousin, Andy Oakes, played for Derby County.\n\nSpanish giants Barcelona can boast another father and son goalkeeping dynasty with current shot-stopper Jose Reina following in his father's footsteps.

His dad, Roy, was Ipswich Town's Championship-winning custodian in 1962.\n\nAnother player with a lot to live up to is Chelsea's Carlo Cudicini. Father Fabio was capped by the Italian national side and is a legend at AC Milan.\n\nItalian keeper Gianluigi Buffon comes from a very sporting family - his dad was a shot-putter, his mother used to throw the discus while his two sisters play in Italy's top volleyball league! What's more, former AC Milan and Inter goalkeeper Lorenzo Buffon is a distant cousin.\n\nThe first pair of brothers to play together at international level were James and Robert Smith of South Norwood Football Club, who played for Scotland in the first ever international against England way back in 1872. Robert Smith started the game outfield but replaced captain Bob Gardner in goal at the start of the Second Half. Both he and Gardner kept a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw.\n\nFormer Spurs player David Howells played alongside his goalkeeping brother Gareth in the Tottenham youth team. Gareth later went on to play for Torquay United and currently turns out for non-league Aldershot.\n\nIt has often been said that there is nothing harder than following in your father's footsteps. Thankfully, Pele's son, Edinho, saw sense and decided to become a goalkeeper, playing for the same team as his dad, Santos.\n\nSaudi Arabia's long-serving keeper Mohammad Al-Deayea replaced his brother in the Saudi National team before going on to play in two World Cup finals.\n\nSouthampton and Wales goalkeeper Paul Jones followed his eldest brother Mark into League football. His brother once had a spell with Hereford United.\n\nThe Dunne brothers both played for Manchester United during the 1960s. Goalkeeper Pat made several appearances during United's Championship winning season of 1964/65 before being replaced by Alex Stepney.

It's also worth noting that Les Sealey's uncle was former West Ham United striker Alan Sealey.\n\nManchester City stalwart Tony Book's brother, Kim, also played professional football and was the unfortunate goalkeeper between the sticks for Northampton Town when George Best ran riot for Manchester United in an 8-2 victory. Kim's son Steve followed him into goal, playing for the likes of Cheltenham and Swindon Town.\n\nGoalkeeper Hans Klodt played alongside his brother, winger Bernhard, in the FC Schalke 04 side that dominated German football in the 1930s.\n\nFrench international goalkeeper Fabien Barthez's father was a top-class Rugby Union player. Fabien himself used to play rugby before taking up football.\n\nFormer Bolton Wanderers and England goalkeeper John Sutcliffe's brother Charles was also a keeper, turning out for Sheffield United in the 1925 F.A. Cup Final.\n\nIpswich Town youngster Carl Pentney hopes to go one better than his dad, Lloyd, by making his League debut before too long. Despite playing non-league football with the likes of Clacton Town, Harwich & Parkeston and Wivenhoe Town, the nearest Lloyd came to the Coca-Cola Championship was the Rymans League.\n\nDynamo Kiev keeper Nikolai Trusevich played in the same all-conquering Kiev side as his brother-in-law, Iosif Livshitz. Trusevich later played for FC Start against the German military, including the infamous 'Death Match', during the Second World War after he was taken prisoner.\n\nThere's only two John Lukics... Former Arsenal and Leeds United goalkeeper John Lukic's son, also called John, was signed by Grimsby Town in the summer of 2005. John is also a goalkeeper like his father, er, John.\n\nUruguayan international and Nacional de Montevideo goalkeeper Sebastián Viera also followed in his father's footsteps. Mario Viera was also a goalkeeper for some note and played for his country in the 1979 FIFA World Youth Championship in Japan.\n\nCrawley Town goalkeeper Scott Ward, on the other hand, decided not to following in the footsteps of his brothers, Darren and Elliot, both of whom are centre halves for Crystal Palace and West Ham United respectively.\n\nWhen New Youngs met Air Force in a Sri Lankan FA Cup tie in June 2006, there was a bit of sibling rivalry involved. New Youngs lined-up with Damith Dayawansa between the posts while Air Force had his brother Saman as their goalkeeper. The game was eventually abandoned after Damith was arrested for going AWOL from his military unit. His unit? The Air Force, of course!\n\nFootball was in the blood of Icelandic brothers Johannes and Alti Edvaldsson. Johannes turned out for Celtic and Motherwell while Alti plied his trade in Germany with Borussia Dortmund and Fortuna Dusseldorf. Both were capped at international level. Their father, Evald Mikson, was also a footballer and played in goal for Estonia.
