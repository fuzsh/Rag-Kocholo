Never heard of Gyorgy Orth until now.\n\nOct 1, 2019\n\n#118\n\nharms\n\nShining Star of Paektu Mountain\n\nJoined\n\nApr 8, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n28,275\n\nLocation\n\nMoscow\n\nBudapest\n\n--------------------------------------Gyula Grosics-----------------------------------------------\n\nSándor Mátrai --------Ferenc Sipos------------Gyula Lóránt---------------Mihály Lantos\n\n--------------------------------------József Zakariás-------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------József Bozsik--------------------Nándor Hidegkuti-----------------------\n\nSándor Kocsis-------------Ferenc Puskas-----------László Kubala\n\nEdit: Puskas meant to be in.\n\nThat's fecking amazing, although I'd put the front three like Kubala (played a lot on the right for Barca) - Kocsis - Puskas (preferred left inside channel)\n\nNo Gyorgy Sarosi, Gyorgy Orth, and Ferenc Puskas?\n\nPuskas was in team. I put it in wrong. Apologies, I edited it. Was thinking of putting in Gyorgi Sarosi instead of József Bozsik. Never heard of Gyorgy Orth until now.\n\nThe beauty of Sarosi is that he played at the highest level as a striker, midfielder and center back (and once got nominated by 3 different journalists in a World XI as a striker, midfielder and defender) — I think you can easily find him a place in defence.\n\nOct 1, 2019\n\n#119\n\nBlackShark_80\n\nFull Member\n\nJoined\n\nNov 3, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n1,169\n\nPuskas was in team.
