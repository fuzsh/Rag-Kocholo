        "text": "The (http://forums.bigsoccer.com/threads/great-world-cup-teams-that-never-were.2005683/) thread got me thinking about great generations of footballers from countries. Some great generations did not get to play together and prove themselves on an international level for a variety of reasons. England's greatest generation of footballers did not get to play with one of their greatest contemporaries, Duncan Edwards, because of his early passing. Hungary's Golden Team, as powerful as its front line was, did not have all of its top attacking players available for selection because players abroad (Kubala, Nyers) were not included in the national team. Similar things occurred in Argentina in the 50s. I want to measure the quality of a generation by the total achievements of all the players in it, not just how well they performed together for the national team. For example the generation of English players in their primes in the late 1970s were major underachievers with the national team, but were major parts of English clubs dominating European Football.\n\nMy goal here is to simply define a generation as a group of players born in the same country in a certain time period. The time period took a little tinkering. I first looked at players born within 5 years of one another but this was too small a time period, as my goal was to grab a group of players who played together or could have played together because of their similar ages. With a 5 year time period players like Hidegkuti and Puskas, who clearly were part of the same generation and played together for much of their career could not be in one generation (Hidegkuti born in 1922, Puskas born in 1927). I then moved the time period to 10 years which seemed a little to big and players who were not associated with one another or careers did not really overlap in a meaningful way could be grouped in one generation (Domingos da Guia 1912 and Zizinho 1921). I settled on 8 years as the time period to use and in general it works relatively well with the reality of players careers. Usually on one team an 8 year gap between players ages in the maximum you see unless one player is very young and the other as unusual longevity.\n\nI decided to strictly limit players to the country they were born in to limit confusion and grey areas. In theory we are looking for the best generations of players produced by a country or region. In some situations you have players move to a country at a very young age and you could still argue they were \"produced\" by the country they played for. Lillian Thruman moved to France at the age of 9 and most if not all of his football education and career was in France. Players like Eusebio or Coluna developed the early part of their careers abroad before moving to the country they were associated with in their late teens. They clearly were not developed in Portugal in my opinion. To eliminate grey areas like Lillian Thurman, and arguments about ethnicity (which by my definition has nothing to do with who produced a player, Thierry Henry and William Gallas were born in France so they were available for French generations) I simply used where the player was born to determine eligibility. This interpretation hurts a number of excellent footballing generations, largely the two mention earlier. France's World Cup winning generation loses Thruman, Desailly, Viera etc and Portugal's generation of the 60s loses Eusebio and Coluna.\n\nTo make things simple for comparing generations of players across different time periods I have defined players by their roles not positions (http://forums.bigsoccer.com/threads...-function-not-position.2009089/#post-30813593).\n\nI have gone through each country and tried to identify their best generations. Then once that is complete it would be interesting to try to define the best generations among all countries.\n\nTo start off I will tackle one of the all time great footballing countries Brazil.\n\nThe first generation of players I wanted to capture was a generation built around Leonidas and Domingo da Guia. Going any earlier in time to players like Friedenreich does not make sense to me as there are not enough top players around Friedenreich to create a strong generation.\n\nI will list players in relative order for their importance/achievement/talent for each \"role\".\n\nLeonidas/Domingo da Guia generation stretches from 1910 to 1917. This was the generation of footballers that were in their primes for the 1938 World Cup that Brazil preformed well at.\n\nFinishers\n\nLeônidas da Silva (Leonidas)\n\nWaldemar de Brito\n\nCarvalho Leite\n\nJosé Perácio\n\nLeonídio Fantoni (Niginho)\n\nSylvio Pirillo\n\nUriel Fernandes (Teleco)\n\nChance Creators\n\nRodolpho Barteczko (Patesko)\n\nHércules de Miranda (Hércules)\n\nElba de Pádua Lima (Tim)\n\nLuís Mesquita de Oliveira (Luisinho)\n\nRomeu Pellicciari (Romeu)\n\nControllers\n\nJosé Augusto Brandão\n\nZezé Procópio\n\nAarón Wergifker\n\nAfonso Guimarães da Silva (Afonsinho)\n\nMartín Mercío Silveyra\n\nDefenders\n\nDomingos da Guia\n\nJose de Oliveira Junqueira\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nAlgisto Lorenzato (Batatais)\n\nThe strength of this generation is in the finishers and chance creators. There were enough excellent strikers, inside forwards, and wingers that many excellent players had difficulty getting into the national team. A player like Teleco is considered one of the greatest Cornthians players ever. He was top scorer in the Paulista 5 times (a record) and won four Paulista titles but to my knowledge never got capped due to the presence Leonidas and Carvalho Leite among others.\n\nThe weakness of this generation is among the controllers, defenders, and goalkeeper. There is decent depth at controller but none of the players were really considered the top halfbacks of their time in South America compared to contemporaries from Argentina (Ernesto Lazzatti, Jorge Alberti) and Uruguay (Obdulio Varela, Michele Andreolo). There is major lack of depth at defender with da Guia being an all time great but not much after that.\n\nZizinho/Ademir generation is from 1920 to 1927. This is generation of Brazilians that built strength through the 40s culminating in the 1949 South American Championship win and the 1950 World Cup final appearance. This generation also includes players who went on to be important veterans in the 1954 World Cup. I would say this is the generation that really elevated Brazil's status to a world power.\n\nFinishers\n\nAdemir Marques de Menezes (Ademir)\n\nHeleno de Freitas\n\nAlbino Friaça Cardoso (Friaca)\n\nOswaldo da Silva (Baltazar)\n\nCarlos Alberto Zolim Filho (Carlitos)\n\nAdão Nunes Dornelles (Adãozinho)\n\nChance Creators\n\nThomaz Soares da Silva (Zizinho)\n\nJair Rosa Pinto (Jair)\n\nOsmar Fortes Barcellos (Tesourinha)\n\nCláudio Christovam de Pinho (Cláudio)\n\nFrancisco Aramburu (Chico)\n\nFrancisco Rodrigues\n\nJosé Lázaro Robles (Pinga)\n\nYeso Amalfi\n\nPedro de Araújo Simão (Simao)\n\nElísio dos Santos Teixeira (Teixerinha)\n\nManuel Marinho Alves (Maneca)\n\nControllers\n\nDanilo Alvim\n\nJose Carlos Bauer\n\nRui Campos\n\nAntenor Lucas (Brandãozinho)\n\nMoacir Lamb (Biguá)\n\nEly do Amparo (Ely)\n\nJoão Ferreira (Bigode)\n\nJaime de Almeida\n\nWaldemar Fiume\n\nDefenders\n\nNilton Santos\n\nAugusto da Costa\n\nJuvenal Amarijo (Juvenal)\n\nOlavo Rodrigues Barbosa (Nena)\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nMoacir Barbosa Nascimento (Barbosa)\n\nCarlos José Castilho (Castilho)\n\nThis generation sports excellent depth at all positions. Finishers is headed up by an all time great and has good depth with very well thought of players in Heleno de Freitas, Fricia, and Baltazar behind for depth plus two all time great goal scorers from the Campeonato Gaucho in Carlitos and Adãozinho. The chance creator group is fantastic with amazing depth. Claudio is considered by many the greatest player in his clubs history (Corinthians) and led a signature club of the time to multiple championships but he could never get major playing time at inside forward because of Jair and Zizinho. Teixerinha is in a similar situation as one of the great Sao Paulo's sides top attackers but few caps to show. The group of wingers also has great depth but not quite the star power of the inside forwards. The controllers are deep with Alvim and Bauer heading up the group. The defenders are the weak spot of the team with one all time great players who came in at the tail end of this generation, but outside of that the players involved are not considered the best at their position outside of Brazil. The two goalkeepers are solid but not spectacular.\n\nDidi/Garrincha generation is from 1928 to 1935. This is in contention for the greatest generation in football history. Pele was not born until 1940 so he is difficult to join with this group of players. Despite Pele's absence I believe this group has more overall quality than any generation that can be made with Pele in it.\n\nFinishers\n\nWaldir Cardoso Lebrêgo (Quarentinha)\n\nEdvaldo Izídio Neto (Vava)\n\nEvaristo de Macedo Filho (Evaristo)\n\nPaulo Valentim\n\nWaldo Machado da Silva (Waldo)\n\nAluísio Francisco da Luz (Índio)\n\nChance Creators\n\nManuel Francisco dos Santos (Garrincha)\n\nWaldyr Pereira (Didi)\n\nJúlio Botelho (Julinho)\n\nJosé Macia (Pepe)\n\nJosé Ribamar de Oliveira (Canhoteiro)\n\nMario Zagallo\n\nDorval Rodrigues (Dorval)\n\nSidney Colônia Cunha (Chinesinho)\n\nJoel Antônio Martins\n\nEdvaldo Alves de Santa Rosa (Dida)\n\nVladem Lázaro Ruiz Quevedo (Delém)\n\nLuíz Trochillo (Luizinho)\n\nPaulo César Araújo (Pagão)\n\nControllers\n\nJosé Ely de Miranda (Zito)\n\nDino Sani\n\nRoberto Belangero\n\nJosé Ferreira Franco (Zequinha)\n\nJosé Mendonça dos Santos (Dequinha)\n\nMílton Alves da Silva\n\nDefenders\n\nDjalma Santos\n\nMauro Ramos de Oliveira (Mauro Ramos)\n\nOrlando Peçanha de Carvalho (Orlando)\n\nHilderaldo Bellini\n\nNílton de Sordi\n\nZózimo Alves Calazães (Zózimo)\n\nValdemar Rodrigues Martíns (Oreco)\n\nDalmo Gaspar\n\nJoão Carlos Batista Pinheiro (Pinheiro)\n\nJordan da Costa\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nGylmar dos Santos Neves (Gilmar)\n\nFélix Miélli Venerando (Félix)\n\nFinishers lack an all time great superstar but has a number of excellent high quality players. The chance creator group is likely the best group of chance creators ever produced by a generation in or outside Brazil. The log jam of great wingers for example is amazing with Garrincha, Julinho, and Dorval all competing for caps on the right and Pepe, Canhoteiro, and Mario Zagallo all competing on the left. The controllers are strong behind to greats in Zito and Dino Sani. Unlike the previous Brazilian generations there is depth and quality in defense as well as two solid goalkeepers.\n\nPele/Altafini generation from 1937 to 1944 and the Pele/Tostao generation from 1940 to 1947. These are in my opinion the two best ways to build a generation around Pele. It is possible to stretch from 1933 to 1940 and get Pele (1940) and Garrincha (1933) in one generation but that does not have the overall quality that these two choices have in my eyes.\n\n1937 to 1944\n\nFinishers\n\nEdson Arantes do Nascimento (Pelé)\n\nJose Altafini\n\nAntônio Wilson Vieira Honório (Coutinho)\n\nToninho Guerreiro\n\nProcópio Cardoso\n\nServílio de Jesus Filho (Servílio)\n\nFlávio Almeida da Fonseca (Flávio Minuano)\n\nRoberto Lopes de Miranda (Roberto Miranda)\n\nChance Creators\n\nJair Ventura Filho (Jairzinho)\n\nAdemir da Guia\n\nGérson de Oliveira Nunes (Gerson)\n\nJair da Costa\n\nAmarildo Tavares da Silveira (Amarildo)\n\nMengálvio Pedro Figueiró (Mengálvio)\n\nControllers\n\nWilson da Silva Piazza\n\nAntônio Lima dos Santos (Lima)\n\nOlegário Tolóí de Oliveira (Dudu)\n\nDenílson Custódio Machado (Denílson)\n\nDefenders\n\nCarlos Alberto Torres\n\nEveraldo Marques da Silva (Everaldo)\n\nRildo da Costa Menezes (Rildo)\n\nRoberto Dias\n\nDjalma Pereira Dias Júnior (Djalma Dias)\n\nHércules de Brito Ruas (Brito)\n\nAltair Gomes de Figueiredo (Altair)\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nHaílton Corrêa de Arruda (Manga)\n\nRaul Plassmann\n\n1940 to 1947\n\nFinishers\n\nEdson Arantes do Nascimento (Pelé)\n\nEduardo Gonçalves de Andrade (Tostao)\n\nAntônio Wilson Vieira Honório (Coutinho)\n\nDario José dos Santos (Dadá Maravilha)\n\nToninho Guerreiro\n\nFlávio Almeida da Fonseca (Flávio Minuano)\n\nRoberto Lopes de Miranda (Roberto Miranda)\n\nChance Creators\n\nJair Ventura Filho (Jairzinho)\n\nAdemir da Guia\n\nGérson de Oliveira Nunes (Gerson)\n\nDirceu Lopes\n\nJair da Costa\n\nValdomiro Vaz Franco (Valdomiro)\n\nNatal de Carvalho Baroni (Natal)\n\nControllers\n\nWilson da Silva Piazza\n\nAntônio Lima dos Santos (Lima)\n\nDenílson Custódio Machado (Denílson)\n\nAlcindo Martha de Freitas (Alcindo)\n\nDefenders\n\nCarlos Alberto Torres\n\nEveraldo Marques da Silva (Everaldo)\n\nRildo da Costa Menezes (Rildo)\n\nRoberto Dias\n\nJoel Camargo\n\nMário Peres Ulibarri (Marinho Peres)\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nRaul Plassmann\n\nI bolded the major names unique to each generation. The core of Pele's generation remains mostly the same with either group (Pele, Coutinho, Jairzinho, Ademir da Guia, Gerson, Jair da Costa, Piazza, and Carlos Alberto Torres). The major additions for the 37-44 group is Altafini, Amarildo, Mengalvio, and Manga and the 40-47 group is Tostao, Direcu Lopez, and Dadá Maravilha. Not sure which one I prefer. Overall the Pele generations have just as much top quality as the Garrincha/Didi generation but lack the depth of quality it had, especially at controller and defender. Pele's generation is probably ahead at finishers and close behind at chance creator despite the lack of depth comparatively since the top quality is so good for Pele's generation (Jairzinho, Ademir da Guia, Gerson, Jair da Costa, and Direcu Lopez/Amarildo and Mengalvio).\n\nI will continue the Brazil generations post Pele in another post.\n\nLilian Thuram was born in France mate. Guadeloupe is part of France juste like -let's say- Hawaï is part of the US.\n\nOne thing to consider is that goalies used to reach their primes later than field players (let's said 4 years later).\n\nSo, is common to see into the same generation on into their primes to \"field players\" with 21 y.o. and goalies with 34 y.o.\n\nBut, I understand if you want to stay things simple.\n\nOn to Italy.\n\nThe first major group of footballers is comprised of a few generations of inter-war players who had strong performances for the national team winning two World Cups and two Central European Cups between 1927 and 1938. Because the birth dates of signature Italian players of the time stretch from 1900 to 1916 multiple \"generations\" were needed to capture them all. These generations have less depth than other generations because of my exclusion of Oriundo, South American players who were purchased near the peaks of their careers by Italian clubs and then given prominent places in the national team. In this era more than any other, Oriundo had vital parts of the Italian national team, most notably Miguel Andreolo, Enrique Guaita, Julio Libonatti, Luis Monti, and Raimundo Orsi. These generations are especially short of chance creators because not only did the national team employ many Oriundo at these positions, many club team did as well with players like Raimundo Orsi, Enrique Guaita, Renato Cesarini, Francisco Fedullo, Arturo Chini Ludueña, Attilio Demaría, Francisco Frione, Niginho, Filo, Nininho, Roberto Porta, Attila Sallustro, Raffaele Sansone, Alejandro Scopelli, and Pedro Sernagiotto all taking starting positions in creative,attacking positions for prominent club team.\n\nCombi/Ferrari generation is from 1900 to 1907.\n\nFinishers\n\nAngelo Schiavio\n\nGino Rossetti\n\nVirgilio Levratto\n\nMario Magnozzi\n\nLeopoldo Conti\n\nChance Creators\n\nGiovanni Ferrari\n\nControllers\n\nLuigi Bertolini\n\nAttilio Ferraris\n\nAntonio Janni\n\nFulvio Bernardini\n\nPietro Serantoni\n\nAlfredo Pitto\n\nArmando Castellazzi\n\nDefenders\n\nVirginio Rosetta\n\nLuigi Allemandi\n\nUmberto Caligaris\n\nEraldo Monzeglio\n\nFelice Gasperi\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nGiampiero Combi\n\nGiovanni De Pra\n\nMario Gianni\n\nThis generation is very deep with players at controller, defender, and goalkeeper with lots of top talent as well. Players like Combi, Rosetta, Allemandi, Caligaris, Monzeglio, Bertolini, and Ferraris were all thought of as some of the best European players of their time at their positions. There is decent depth at finisher but a lack of star talent. Only one chance creator is present but he was great.\n\nThe nest generations moves three years younger to capture Meazza but in turn losses some of the top talent at defender and goalkeeper the previous generation had.\n\nAllemandi/Meazza generation is from 1903 to 1910.\n\nFinishers\n\nGiuseppe Meazza\n\nAngelo Schiavio\n\nGino Rossetti\n\nVirgilio Levratto\n\nPietro Pastore\n\nChance Creators\n\nGiovanni Ferrari\n\nCarlo Reguzzoni\n\nControllers\n\nLuigi Bertolini\n\nAttilio Ferraris\n\nAntonio Janni\n\nFulvio Bernardini\n\nPietro Serantoni\n\nMario Pizziolo\n\nAlfredo Pitto\n\nArmando Castellazzi\n\nMario Montesanto\n\nDefenders\n\nLuigi Allemandi\n\nEraldo Monzeglio\n\nFelice Gasperi\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nAldo Olivieri\n\nCarlo Ceresoli\n\nI big step forward at finisher is taken by adding the best Italian player of the time. More depth is added to the creator and controller roles as well but major top end talent is lost at defender and goalkeeper.\n\nThe final generation of this group moves even younger to combine with Meazza the other top Italian attacking talents of the time and acquires a mostly new group of controllers and defenders.\n\nMeazza/Piola generation is from 1909 to 1916\n\nFinishers\n\nGiuseppe Meazza\n\nSilvio Piola\n\nGuglielmo Gabetto\n\nAldo Boffi\n\nFelice Borel\n\nPietro Ferraris\n\nChance Creators\n\nGino Colaussi\n\nAmedeo Biavati\n\nControllers\n\nUgo Locatelli\n\nMario Perazzolo\n\nMario Pizziolo\n\nMario Montesanto\n\nDefenders\n\nPietro Rava\n\nAlfredo Foni\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nAldo Olivieri\n\nCarlo Ceresoli\n\nThe finishers position takes a huge step forward and is one of the strongest finisher groups of Italians ever with two all time great players and excellent depth. The chance creator position losses Ferrari but gains Colaussi, a relatively even trade. The depth at controller and defender is not present as it was in the earlier generations but the top talent is present in Locatelli, Rava, and Foni.\n\nThere is a relatively large time gap to the next major generation of players in my view with Italy having a down period after WWII (major set back with the air crash killing the majority of the national team) until the arrival of the great teams of the 60s the won four European Cups, a European Championship, and made a World Cup final.\n\nFacchetti/Rivera generation is from 1939 to 1946\n\nFinishers\n\nLuigi Riva\n\nRoberto Boninsegna\n\nPierino Prati\n\nSergio Gori\n\nChance Creators\n\nGianni Rivera\n\nSandro Mazzola\n\nMario Corso\n\nGigi Meroni\n\nAngelo Domenghini\n\nControllers\n\nRomeo Benetti\n\nGiacomo Bulgarelli\n\nGiancarlo De Sisti\n\nGiuseppe Furino\n\nGiovanni Trapattoni\n\nGiorgio Ferrini\n\nGianfranco Bedin\n\nFabio Capello\n\nMario Bertini\n\nAntonio Juliano\n\nGiovanni Lodetti\n\nDefenders\n\nGiacinto Facchetti\n\nTarcisio Burgnich\n\nSandro Salvadore\n\nGiuseppe Wilson\n\nRoberto Rosato\n\nPierluigi Cera\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nDino Zoff\n\nEnrico Albertosi\n\nLuciano Castellini\n\nThis generation is in clear contention for the best Italian generation even in my opinion. They have possibly the greatest Italian striker ever backed up by another excellent finisher. Two of the greatest number 10s Italy ever produced plus some very talented wingers at chance creator. An extremely deep group of defensive midfielders at controller. The group of defenders is somewhat lacking compared to younger generations but it still contains two all time great players. The goalkeeper group is also fantastic.\n\nThe next generation is also in contention for the best Italian generation ever in my opinion and is centered around the players who performed excellently at the 1978 and 1982 World Cups, winning the later. It can be organized in two ways around the core of player born between 1953 and 1956 (Scirea, Gentile, Antognoni, Tardelli, Conte, and Rossi). The first generation moves back to 1949 to acquire more players associated with 1978 (Causio, Bettega) while the second moves to 1960 for younger players who were emerging in the 80s (Cabrini, Baresi, Zenga).\n\nThe Bettega/Scirea generation is from 1949 to 1956\n\nFinishers\n\nPaolo Rossi\n\nRoberto Bettega\n\nAlessandro Altobelli\n\nPaolo Pulici\n\nRoberto Pruzzo\n\nFrancesco Graziani\n\nGiordano Bruno\n\nChance Creators\n\nGiancarlo Antognoni\n\nBruno Conti\n\nFranco Causio\n\nEvaristo Beccalossi\n\nControllers\n\nMarco Tardelli\n\nAgostino Di Bartolomei\n\nSalvatore Bagni\n\nGabriele Oriali\n\nRenato Zaccarelli\n\nGiampiero Marini\n\nDefenders\n\nGaetano Scirea\n\nCladio Gentile\n\nAntonello Cuccureddu\n\nMauro Bellugi\n\nLuciano Spinosi\n\nAldo Maldera\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nIvano Bordon\n\nFranco Tancredi\n\nThis may be the greatest group of Italian finishers ever depending on whether or not you prefer top end talent (1909-1916) or total depth of strong players (1949-1956). The chance creators are a very strong group by Italian standards and the controllers are solid led by Italy's best Tardelli. The defender group is solid but not great compared to other Italian generation, similar 1939 to 1946 with only a couple of top players. The goalkeeper group is weak. Overall this groups abundance of attacking players was reflected in the team attractive and attacking approach at WC 78.\n\nTweaking the generation to younger players changes the overall strengths and weaknesses of the generation.\n\nThe Scirea/Baresi generation is from 1953 to 1960\n\nFinishers\n\nPaolo Rossi\n\nAlessandro Altobelli\n\nRoberto Pruzzo\n\nGiordano Bruno\n\nAldo Serena\n\nChance Creators\n\nGiancarlo Antognoni\n\nBruno Conti\n\nEvaristo Beccalossi\n\nControllers\n\nMarco Tardelli\n\nAgostino Di Bartolomei\n\nSalvatore Bagni\n\nGiuseppe Dossena\n\nCarlo Ancelotti\n\nAntonio di Gennaro\n\nDefenders\n\nFranco Baresi\n\nGaetano Scirea\n\nAntonio Cabrini\n\nCladio Gentile\n\nPietro Vierchowod\n\nFulvio Collovati\n\nMauro Tassotti\n\nRoberto Tricella\n\nAldo Maldera\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nWalter Zenga\n\nStefano Tacconi\n\nGiovanni Galli\n\nFranco Tancredi\n\nThe finishers or still solid but not nearly as good as the previous group, losing Bettega, Pulici, and Graziani. The chance creators are unchanged except by the important loss of Causio and the controllers are tottaly unchanged. There are major additions to the defenders making this possibly the best generation of Italian defenders ever with Baresi, Cabrini, Vierchowod, Collovatti, and Tassotti adding to Scirea and Gentile. There is also a major upgrade at goalkeeper with an all time great in Zenga and additional depth. This generations strength also reflects the teams approach at WC 82 as oppose to 78, with a more pragmatic style centered around a great defense."
