        "text": "Ballads\n\n— In addition to the short overview I wrote about Yana Purim’s discography, I’m happy to include Depois do Amor. Yana Purim, indeed, the sister of… (yeah, you guessed it!), comes up with a beautifully arranged album of wonderful ballads. She sings them in her own characteristic tradition. Over the years Yana’s voice has matured in a way that’s perfect for this repertoire of ballads. The singer from Rio, living in Paris, France, chose some of the most beautiful ones to add to the tracklist of this CD.\n\nThree very dedicated persons created this new album in that cozy studio La Menuiserie, close to Paris: Yana, Jean Yves Candela, and sound master Remi Bourcereau. Pianist, arranger, and composer Jean Yves Candela delivered beautiful piano playing and did some amazing orchestrations. Completely dedicated to the voice of Yana, he gives the singer a more than perfect musical environment to stimulate her best performance. As a jazz pianist, he knows his way through wonderful soloing as well. The Algerian-born musician (1962) has also relocated to Paris. His love for the piano started when he, as a teenager, heard a record of the great Oscar Peterson. His extraordinary talent was shaped by the influences of the music of Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and pianist Bill Evans. He also has a great love for Brazilian music.\n\nYana Purim loves to write lyrics. Almost every song on this CD has (new) lyrics written by Yana. It gives “Oblivion,” the beautiful composition by Astor Piazzolla, an extra dramatic sentiment, intensified by the bandoneon. She also ventures into English lyrics, like in “The Retour.” It’s a quality she manages to use in a wonderful way. Singing her own lyrics adds to the sentiment of the vocals.\n\nDepois do Amor is maybe Yana Purim’s most beautiful album so far. Or as Yana says it: “This album makes me feel closer to my spiritual feelings.” One thing is for sure, it’s made with a warm dedication.\n\nALBUM INFORMATION\n\nYana Purim\n\nDepois do Amor\n\nRecords DK 3026991 (2023)\n\nTime: 66:05\n\nTracks:\n\nDepois do Amor (Michel Legrand – Yana Purim)\n\nChuva Gentil (Luiz Bonfá – Yana Purim)\n\nValsa para Elis (Yana Purim)\n\nMe Abraça (George Gershwin – Yana Purim)\n\nNear Than Me (Cristóvão Bastos – Yana Purim)\n\nAdágio (Egberto Gismonti – Yana Purim)\n\nOblivion (Astor Piazzolla – Yana Purim)\n\nEsquecendo Você (Antonio Carlos Jobim)\n\nNever Let Me Go (Bill Evans – Yana Purim)\n\nÉ Só Amar (Johnny Alf)\n\nThe Retour (Roberto Menescal – Yana Purim)\n\nPrace para Meu Irmão (Yana Purim)\n\nMy Funny Valentine (Richard Rodgers – Lorentz Hart)"
