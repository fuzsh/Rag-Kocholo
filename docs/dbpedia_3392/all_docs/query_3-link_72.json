        "text": "NFT created by Alexandre Freitas.\n\nThe idea of creating this website came across when, as a retired photographer with loads of unclassified files packed up and getting dusty. I decided that something had to be done. Ricardo Alfieri, a famous Argentinian photographer, had the same problem.\n\nSo we decided to join our archives and instead of classifying them the classical way, we decided to assemble stories around the pictures.\n\nSearching the market, we were surprised that platforms such as OpenSea, Superare or Foundation do not have collections of pictures on former soccer stars as Pelé, Maradona, Messi and other big names of the game.\n\nSo we decided to be pioneers and started the project of spreading in the market the pictures that no one else has.\n\nWe are joined in the endeavor by Pier Giorgio Giavelli, considered the world’s best soccer photographer, still going strong, who has an archive of more than 5 million pictures, having covered so far 11 World Cups.\n\nSome of these pictures have turned into NFTs, but we are ready to produce sports collections.\n\nPaulo Teixeira, co-founder.\n\nMESSI road to glory\n\nMessi is the new guy in the hood in Miami.\n\nThree world-class soccer photographers have decided to trust my idea to assemble a bunch of photos portraying Messi with Argentina National team, little known from the general public, since he spent most of his life in Spain.\n\nIt all started back in 2004 in Argentina – the part of the story covered by Carlos Sarraf and Ricardo Alfieri, co-founder of RAPT_10, the professional who had already extensively portrayed Maradona.\n\nThe other part of the collection is told by Pier Giorgio Giavelli an Italian globetrotter settled in Brazil. Together, they have 27 World Cups in their CV’s.\n\nThe whole NFT collection, composed of 109 photos is on sale for 100 ETH on OpenSea.\n\nThe NFT of Messi’s legs will be offered to buyers.\n\nEverybody Has a Smile\n\nDuring my career as a soccer photographer for Argentinian sports magazine El Gráfico and CONMEBOL, I had the chance to cover 10 World Cups and as many as Copas America. I got the thought that spectators go to those events with a different state of mind. Yes, to support their nation, but mostly to party with people from different environments and cultures.\n\nThey spend a long time preparing themselves to go to an important date. It takes hours for these, mostly youngsters, to get their faces painted, wear disguises, adjust clothing – with the final goal to show where they come from, who and how they are going to support their favorite teams and nations. No matter whether they are from Australia, Bolivia, Trinidad & Tobago, Brazil, Germany, Denmark, South Africa or Peru.\n\nThe arena is their stage.\n\nReviewing my archives of thousands of pictures, I picked those 50 for the collection which, in my view, best illustrate that, as a matter of fact,\n\n‘Everybody has a smile’.\n\nRicardo Alfieri\n\nHinchadas/Supporters\n\nThey are always there. On the, stands, their hearts are like one. Neither rich nor poor, neither bad nor good. They shout, sing, whistle, get depressed, get excited, cry, laugh, love, hate. They are flags and color. They are the mirror of what happens on the field, and they are of course an essential part of the spectacle. What would a stadium be without them? Would the party be the same? Would soccer transmit the same passion?\n\nArgentinian Ricard Alfieri, perhaps the most famous of artistic sports photographers, searched among his photos from the decade 2010 to 2020 to chose those exhibited here. On this occasion he does not show the goals, gestures, plays, dribbling, jumps, head butts, faces, hugs, and euphoria, from great players like Pele, Maradona, and Messi among other great stars. This time he pointed his camera at the fans without whose presence we would never have fallen so much in love with the most beautiful game in the world.\n\nCheers to the fans who never abandon their teams.\n\nCherquis Bialo, Argentinian journalist\n\n\"I WAS THERE!\"\n\nI was living in Rio and decided to fly to Lisbon with one idea in my head: take a shot with a fish-eye lens (16mm 2.8) of a packed Estadio da Luz in the FIFA U20 World Cup final between Brazil and Portugal, June 30, 1991.\n\nAt 6pm the sun was high that Sunday, dividing the arena in two parts: one in the light, the other in the shadow.\n\nI prayed for the game to go to extra-time, when the light would be even and I could finally take my dream shot.\n\nAnd so it happened.\n\nA draw in regular time (0-0), and at the end of the penalty shoot out, Portugal won (4-2). It was the second youth title the Portuguese won in a row, paving the path for outstanding careers for players like Rui Costa, Luis Figo or João Pinto, to name just a few.\n\nThe most amazing thing is that when I tell this story to people in Lisbon, no matter their age, I always hear the same answer: ‘Eu tava lá!’ (I was there!). As a matter of fact, 127,000 people attended the final, still an European record today. There was no room even for a needle.\n\nA collection of 20 pictures is featured in the Polygon blockchain, sold as a bundle for 10 ETH.\n\nPaulo Teixeira\n\nEL MARACANAZO\n\nSeptember 3rd, 1989, Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil x Chile.\n\nHalfway into the second period of the last qualifying match for the 1990 World Cup, a flare was thrown from the terraces and landed on the pitch, right behind Chilean goalkeeper Roberto Rojas. All of a sudden he was lying on the ground assuming he had been hit by it, the flare emitting clouds of smoke into the air.\n\nRojas’ head was bleeding and the referee was forced to call off the game.\n\nAs Ricardo and I left the ground and entered the press room, we learned that none of the 16 cameras placed around the arena had captured that critical moment. Which meant that Brazil was out and would not participate in a World Cup for the 1st time in the country’s history.\n\nOut of those 150,000 people present in the stadium, only one had captured the sequence: photographer Ricardo Alfieri. 6 shots for the eternity, the most important ones in his career.\n\nWith that proof in hand, published by TV Globo on prime time, Brazil could prove to FIFA that Rojas had cheated, having used a razor hidden in a glove to cut his head. Chile was suspended from all competitions for 8 years and Rojas banned for life.\n\nThe story behind that event is now being turned into a Netflix documentary.\n\nPaulo Teixeira\n\nTHE STORY OF MARADONA\n\nVilla Fiorito is the name of the shanty town in the outskirts of Buenos Aires where Diego Armando Maradona was born and where the photo story of Ricardo Alfieri begins.\n\nAs the star photographer of the sports weekly magazine El Gráfico, Ricardo had the opportunity to picture him as a kid playing the ball in muddy grounds through a whole career beginning at Argentinos Juniors, where it all started, until the day he lifted the World Cup trophy 1986 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico.\n\nAn amazing collection of 150 pictures which takes the viewer into the player’s intimacy, be it in Buenos Aires when he shot the exclusive picture the time Maradona’s first child Dalma was born or at Soccavo training ground in Napoli.\n\nTo be featured soon on OpenSea.\n\n100 STARS, part 1\n\nEvery human being has a gesture that defines him. In football, players are identified by a body language that tells the story about them.\n\nFranco Baresi, the iconic AC Milan defender who brilliantly guided his defense in the 80’s and 90’s, had one that was like an order: when he lifted up his right arm, it meant that his colleagues had to step forward and apply the off-side line. Bingo!\n\nI chose him to introduce the first collection of 100 stars that will be displayed on our website. Naming some others:\n\nCasagrande (Brasil), Chendo (Real Madrid), Lineker (Barcelona) Hughes (Barcelona), Dunga (Brasil), Rincon (Colombia), Gullit (Milan), Gatti (Independiente), Bell (Cameroun), Oman Biyck (Cameroun).\n\nJulio Cesar (Juventus), Medina Bello (River Plate), Ruggeri (River Plate), Pelé Riva Jair (Brasil), Raí (São Paulo), Higuita (Colombia), Ruben Paz (Uruguay), Savicevic (Yugoslavia), Schilacci (Juventus).\n\nSchuster (Barcelona), Simeone (Argentina), Ricardo (PSG), Alemão (Botafogo), Escobar (Colombia), Valderrama (Colombia), Rojas (Chile), Batistuta (River), Zinho (Flamengo), Edinho (Udinese).\n\nCareca (Sao Paulo), Van Basten (Milan), Jorginho (Palmeiras), Valdo (Benfica), Rivelino (Brasil), Jairzinho (Brasil), Pelé (Brasil), Gutierrez (River), Jorge Campos (Mexico), Platini (France).\n\nRenato (Brasil), Socrates (Brasil), Zamorano (Chile), Junior (Flamengo), Bebeto (Flamengo), Zico (Flamengo), Neto (Brasil), Goicoechea (Argentina), Futre (Porto).\n\nThese are some names of the collections that will be featured.\n\n100 STARS, part 2\n\nThis is how a toothless Ronaldo Nazário looked like back in September 1993, when he joined Cruzeiro from São Cristóvão. I had heard about a ‘young, phenomenal forward’, and I decided to take a plane from Rio de Janeiro to shoot the guy at Morumbi stadium in a game São Paulo vs Cruzeiro.\n\nIt will be part of the collectibles in the second serie of the 100 STARS collection, which will include names like:\n\nKlose (Germany), Ayala (Argentina), Buffon (Italy), Alexis Sanchez (Chile), Cannavaro (Italy), Nakata (Japan), Casillas (Spain), Koeman (Barcelona), Luis Figo (Sporting), Rui Costa (Benfica).\n\nJean Pierre Papin (Marseille), Zidane (France), Forlan (Uruguay), Piquet (Barcelona), Totti (Italia), Deco (Portugal), Gamarra (Paraguay), Adriano (Brazil), Diamantino (Benfica)\n\nRiquelme (Argentina), Chilavert (Paraguay), Xavi Hernandez (Spain), Silas (São Paulo), Muller (São Paulo), Leonardo (Flamengo), Quiñones (Equador), Alvarez (Colombia), Fernando Gomes (Porto), Juskowiak (Sporting).\n\nThern (Benfica), Roger Milla (Cameroun), Madjer (Valencia), Laudrup (Danmark), Mancini (Sampdoria), Stoichkov (Barcelona), Pancev (Yugoslavia), Boban (Dinamo Zagreb), Branco (Brazil), Procinesky (Real Madrid).\n\nBalakov (Sporting), Vitor Baía (FC Porto), Enzo Schifo (Belgium), Oliveira (FC Porto), Chalana (Benfica), Bochini (Independiente), Passarela (Internazionale), Shilton (England)…\n\nMore Collections to come...\n\nWembley 92 – Barcelona’s first Champions League title, summed up in 20 pictures.\n\nThe Yugos no more – a recollection of Yugoslavian players prior to the partition of the country into five others, back in the 90’s.\n\nDenmark Euro 92 – How a bunch of players packed their bags from holiday resorts to assemble and win the Euro 92 title in Sweden.\n\nMagic 10 – Ten players who best represented the most iconic jersey in football summed up in 20 pictures (back and front).\n\nMaracaña as it was – The Temple of football.\n\nPele as never seen – Featuring as a gangster in Pedro Mico film, 1985.\n\nAnd more…\n\nIn Honor Of...\n\nMARACANÃ. The Temple of Football.\n\nA radio reporter stretching his mike toward the goalkeeper.\n\nThat could only happen at Maracanã.\n\nA stadium that witnessed Pelé’s thousandth goal.\n\nCould have occurred elsewhere, but it happened in Maracanã.\n\nA stadium that holds the world’s attendance record: 200,000 souls for the 1950 World Cup final.\n\nIn preparation, a comprehensive collection of 20 pictures to be minted eventually on Opensea."
