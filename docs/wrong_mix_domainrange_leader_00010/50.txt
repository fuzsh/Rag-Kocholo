Maria das Neves Gomes is an FCT doctoral researcher at the Centre for Classical Studies of the University of Lisbon. Her PhD is an interdisciplinary project rooted both in Classical and Slavic studies, focusing on classical reception in Russian poetry of the early twentieth century. As a Visiting Student Researcher at the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures of Princeton University, she will work with her co-adviser and access top-tier resources to conduct research on Slavic studies, among which the personal archives of one of the poets she studies. She will investigate how a selection of modern Russian poets used Classical motives to conceptualize their identities, within a social context where the relationship with the Classics continued to be forcefully reshaped to fit political agendas. This touches on the complex issues of Slavic (and Classical) identities, historically in perpetual redefinition and conflict with the West.
