The University Talent Program for Finance brings this priority alive and helps develop the future talent pipeline of our Finance business.\n\nDuring the program, the young graduates will gain experience in several roles in our Finance business area. There will be 4 x 6-month rotations over the 2 year program, however these can vary according to business demands. We ask candidates to be geographically mobile and complete one rotation within our Finance Shared Service Centre, based in Bulgaria.\n\nThis project is focusing on the development of performance and financial capability within Shared Services, Commercial Finance, Supply Chain Finance, and either Internal Audit or Procurement.\n\nThe program will helps building experience in Finance, as well as building knowledge and capabilities in Financial Management, Operations and Strategy."
