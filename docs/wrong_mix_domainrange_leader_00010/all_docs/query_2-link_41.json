        "text": "What types of companies exist in Bulgaria?\n\nBulgaria, like many other countries, offers a variety of legal forms for doing business, each of which has its own characteristics, advantages and limitations. Choosing the best form of company depends on many factors, including the size of the business, the planned amount of investment, the goals of the owners, and the degree of personal responsibility desired. In this article, we will look at the main types of companies available in Bulgaria and their key characteristics.\n\nIndividual entrepreneur (ET – “Ednolichen trgovets”)\n\nAn individual entrepreneur is the simplest and most accessible form of doing business. This form is suitable for a single owner and does not require the formation of the authorized capital. The main disadvantage is unlimited personal responsibility for the debts and obligations of the business.\n\nPartnership (SD – “Sbiratelno druzhestvo”)\n\nA partnership implies the existence of two or more founders who conduct business under a common name and bear unlimited joint responsibility for the company’s obligations. This form is suitable for small family businesses or partnerships where a high level of trust between partners is important.\n\nLimited partnership (KD – “Komanditno druzhestvo”)\n\nIn a limited partnership, there is at least one limited partner (investor), whose liability is limited to the size of its investments, and one limited partner (managing partner), who bears unlimited liability. This type of company is suitable for projects where you need to attract external funding, but at the same time you want to maintain control over management.\n\nLimited Liability Company (OOD – “Oodruzhestvo s limitaena razgovornost”)\n\nOOD is the most popular form of legal entity in Bulgaria. It offers a limited liability of the founders (no more than the size of their invested contributions) and can be created by one or more persons. The authorized capital is divided into shares, which makes the OOD a suitable choice for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nJoint-Stock Company (hereinafter referred to as “Joint – Stock Druzhestvo”)\n\nA joint-stock company is suitable for large enterprises with a large number of investors. It requires a minimum authorized capital and can issue shares that can be publicly traded on an exchange. AD provides limited liability for shareholders, which makes it attractive for large investment projects.\n\nCooperative (Cooperative)\n\nCooperatives are most often created to work together in the agricultural sector, production, or service delivery. They can be organized by a group of individuals or legal entities that have pooled resources to achieve a common economic goal. Cooperatives are regulated by special legislation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe choice of legal entity form in Bulgaria depends on many factors, including the size and objectives of the business, the desired level of responsibility and the need for investment. Each form has its own unique characteristics and requirements, so it is important to carefully evaluate all options and, if necessary, consult with legal experts to choose the most suitable form for your business in Bulgaria.\n\nTable oftax rates for Bulgarian companies for 2024:\n\nWhat is the size of the company’s authorized capital in Bulgaria?\n\nThe size of the authorized capital is one of the key aspects when registering a company in Bulgaria, as it can influence the choice of the form of a legal entity, as well as the obligations and business opportunities. The authorized capital is the sum of funds or assets contributed by the founders or shareholders to the company when it was established. This amount serves as a guarantee of creditors ‘ interests and determines the minimum financial threshold that the company must maintain. In Bulgaria, the size of the authorized capital varies depending on the form of the company’s legal entity.\n\nLimited Liability Company\n\nMinimum authorized capital: 2 leva (approximately 1 euro).\n\nOOD is the most popular form of business in Bulgaria due to its flexibility and limited liability of founders, which does not exceed the size of their investments in the authorized capital.\n\nJoint-Stock Company (AD)\n\nMinimum authorized capital: BGN 50,000 for closed joint-stock companies (CJSC) and BGN 100,000 for open joint-stock companies (JSC) (approximately EUR 25,000 and EUR 50,000, respectively).\n\nAD is suitable for large businesses with the ability to attract investment through the issue of shares.\n\nLimited Partnership (CD) and Partnership (SD)\n\nFor these types of businesses, the legislation of Bulgaria does not set requirements for the minimum size of the authorized capital.\n\nThe founders are personally liable for the company’s obligations, which are unlimited for the partners in the partnership, and limited to the size of their contribution for the limited partners in the limited partnership.\n\nCo-op\n\nMinimum authorized capital: Determined by the founders and can be changed in accordance with the cooperative’s charter.\n\nCooperatives are usually created for joint activities in the agricultural sector, production or service provision, where the founders make equal contributions.\n\nImportance of share capital\n\nThe authorized capital is important not only as the financial base of the company at the time of its creation, but also as an indicator for creditors and partners, reflecting the financial stability and seriousness of the founders ‘ intentions. In addition to meeting the minimum authorized capital requirements, the company needs to take into account the needs of future operations and possible risks in order to ensure a sufficient level of capitalization.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe size of the authorized capital in Bulgaria depends on the form of the company’s legal entity and can vary from a symbolic amount to significant investments for joint-stock companies. Choosing the optimal size of the authorized capital requires careful analysis of the business objectives, its financing needs and planned activities. In any case, the authorized capital is the foundation for starting and developing a business, as well as an important factor for ensuring its financial stability and trust on the part of partners and investors.\n\nShould a company in Bulgaria have a local director?\n\nBulgarian legislation does not strictly require that the director or manager of a company must be a resident of Bulgaria. This means that foreign citizens can hold the position of director of a Bulgarian company without having to live in Bulgaria. However, there are several aspects that need to be considered:\n\nRegistration and taxation: The presence of a foreign director does not affect the company’s obligations to the Bulgarian tax authorities. The company must meet all local tax requirements, including corporate tax, VAT and other fees.\n\nCompany representation: Although the position of director does not require local residency, in practice it may be necessary to have a person capable of representing the company’s interests in Bulgaria to perform administrative procedures, communicate with government authorities and participate in legally significant events.\n\nBanking operations: To open and manage the company’s bank accounts in Bulgarian banks, you may need additional documents from a foreign director, such as proof of residency or a special power of attorney.\n\nPractical considerations\n\nAlthough there are no legal restrictions on the appointment of foreigners as directors, in practice there may be difficulties associated with managing a company from a distance. In some cases, it may be appropriate to appoint a local director or representative who can quickly address current issues, communicate with local authorities, and ensure that all necessary formalities are completed.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Bulgaria, there is no legal requirement that the director of a company must be a resident of the country. Foreign citizens are free to hold this position, subject to compliance with all applicable tax and administrative obligations of the company. However, it is important to take into account the practical aspects of business management and the possible benefits of having a local representative for effective interaction with government agencies and banks. In some cases, the involvement of a local director or manager may be recommended to facilitate business operations and minimize administrative difficulties.\n\nWhat is the amount of state fees when establishing a company in Bulgaria?\n\nThe establishment of a company in Bulgaria involves the payment of certain state fees, which are part of the administrative costs of the registration process. The amount of these fees may depend on various factors, including the chosen form of legal entity, the method of registration (electronic or paper-based), and additional services. Below is an overview of the main state fees associated with the establishment of a company in Bulgaria, up-to-date at the time of writing.\n\nLimited Liability Company\n\nRegistration fee: When registering a public association through the commercial register, the state fee is about BGN 110 (approximately EUR 56) for paper submission of documents and about BGN 55 (approximately EUR 28) for electronic registration.\n\nAdditional Fees: Additional fees may apply for publishing registration information in the Official Gazette.\n\nJoint-Stock Company (AD)\n\nRegistration fee: For AD, the state registration fee will be higher and will amount to about BGN 210 (approximately EUR 107) for paper documents and about BGN 105 (approximately EUR 54) for electronic registration.\n\nAdditional Fees: Similar to the OOD, additional fees may apply for publication in the Official Gazette.\n\nTrademark registration\n\nIf a company wishes to register a trademark in Bulgaria, this will be subject to a separate fee. The amount of the fee depends on the category of goods and services covered by the brand and can start from about BGN 100 (about EUR 51) per class of goods/services.\n\nOther fees and charges\n\nNotarial expenses: The company’s constituent documents must be notarized. Notary fees depend on the nature of the document and the size of the company’s authorized capital.\n\nFees for legal and consulting services: In addition to government fees, companies may also incur the cost of providing lawyers or consultants for registration and document preparation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe amount of state fees for the establishment of a company in Bulgaria is relatively small, especially when using the electronic registration form. However, potential entrepreneurs should also consider other possible costs associated with the registration process, including notary fees and legal consultants. It is always recommended to get up-to-date information about the amount of fees and documentation requirements immediately before starting the registration process, in order to ensure an effective and successful establishment of your company in Bulgaria.\n\nWhat is the annual cost of servicing a company in Bulgaria?\n\nThe annual cost of servicing a company in Bulgaria is an important aspect of financial planning for any business planning to operate in this country.

There are various legal forms for establishing a company in Bulgaria, each of which has its own characteristics, requirements and advantages. In this article, we will look in detail at the main ways to establish a company in Bulgaria.\n\nLimited Liability Company\n\nA limited liability company is the most popular form of business among small and medium-sized enterprises in Bulgaria.

Thanks to its flexible legislation and favorable tax regime, Bulgaria is an attractive jurisdiction for doing business in the European market.\n\nDo I need to have a legal address in Bulgaria?\n\nThe legal address in Bulgaria plays an important role not only in the process of registering a company, but also in its further operational activities. Understanding the legal address requirements will help entrepreneurs ensure compliance with Bulgarian legislation and avoid possible legal difficulties.

It is used as the official address of the company, where it is registered in the Trade Register and where official correspondence with government agencies and other institutions is carried out. Without specifying the legal address, the company registration process cannot be completed.\n\nLegal correspondence and notifications\n\nThe legal address is used for receiving all types of legal and official correspondence, including notifications from tax authorities, court notices, and other important documents.

Let’s take a closer look at this issue, taking into account various aspects of managing a company in Bulgaria.\n\nLegal aspects\n\nBulgarian legislation does not establish a general mandatory requirement for full-time employees for all types of companies. This means that from a legal point of view, a company can be registered and operate without hiring staff, as long as this does not contradict other specific requirements related to its activities.\n\nHowever, certain activities that require licensing or certification may have specific qualification and staffing requirements. For example, in the areas of education, medicine, construction, and transportation, staff requirements may be strictly regulated by relevant regulations.\n\nStrategic planning and management\n\nFrom a strategic planning perspective, the presence or absence of employees in a company affects its operational efficiency, scalability, and ability to grow. It is important to assess the business ‘ need for specialized skills and resources to achieve the company’s goals.\n\nCompanies that are engaged in intensive research, production, or service delivery may require hiring qualified professionals to work effectively and develop. At the same time, many modern business models based on information technology or remote services can operate with a minimum number of employees or even be fully automated.\n\nOutsourcing and freelancing\n\nAn alternative to hiring full-time employees can be outsourcing or freelancing services. This allows the company to remain flexible, reduce operating costs, and still have access to a wide range of specialized skills as needed. However, when choosing such a model, it is important to take into account aspects related to quality control and confidentiality of information.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn general, the need to have employees in a company registered in Bulgaria depends on the specifics of the business, its goals and development strategy. At the same time, it is important for companies to comply with all applicable legal requirements and evaluate their operational needs in order to choose the most appropriate HR management model. In any case, flexibility in resource management approaches and the use of modern business practices can contribute to the successful conduct and development of business in Bulgaria.\n\nHow do I choose a company name in Bulgaria?\n\nChoosing a name for a company is a key step in the process of starting a business, especially in a country with such a rich cultural and historical heritage as Bulgaria.
