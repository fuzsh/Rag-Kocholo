        "text": "header2 Key Developments in 2020\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak dominated public life and discourse from early March to mid-May, with the government commanding high levels of support due to its relatively well-managed and effective response. However, authorities’ response to the pandemic’s second wave was hesitant, and at the end of December, the country had one of the highest rates in the world of COVID-19-related deaths, as measured by number of deaths per million people.\n\nRomany neighborhoods were placed under harsher COVID-19 restrictions than neighborhoods where Roma did not constitute a majority. The severe restrictions placed on Roma drew statements of alarm from local and international rights groups, who said that in addition to unduly restricting movement, the rules harmed the ability of Romany people to access work, services, and education.\n\nMass antigovernment protests erupted in July in response to a series of corruption scandals, and continued through most of the year. The protests, at which participants called for the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his government, and the prosecutor general, featured occasional violence against participants and journalists by police, but were largely peaceful.\n\nThe European Commission’s new rule-of-law report, issued in September, reiterated long-standing concerns about the sweeping powers of and lack of accountability for the prosecutor general. The prosecutor’s decision to conduct a raid of the offices of President Rumen Radev’s staff was among the numerous catalysts of the year’s antigovernment protest movement; Radev had tried to block the appointment of the prosecutor general, Ivan Geshev, in 2019."
