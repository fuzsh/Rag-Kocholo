While President Menezes is on a visit in Nigeria, lusophone countries are urging the militia to hand power back to civilians.\n\nShooting was reported from the archipelago's capital São Tomé this night at 3 AM, but there are no reports of deaths or casualties. The rebel soldiers soon took control of government buildings, state broadcasters, the Central Bank and the international airport. They also detained most of the country's political leadership, including São Toméan Prime Minister Maria das Neves, National Assembly President Dionisio Dias, Defence Minister Fernando Daqua and Natural Resources Minister Rafael Branco.\n\nThe men behind the military coup made their first public appearance this morning on national radio. Here, Major Fernando \"Cobó\" Pereira ordered all senior government officials yet not detained to report to the coup makers. If not, he would \"not take responsibility\" for what could happen to them. Mr Pereira declared himself army chief-of-staff.\n\nThis afternoon, the national radio was made to read a declaration by the so-called \"National Salvation Junta\", to be headed by General Pereira. The junta declared \"to the national and international community\" that it had taken over all functions in the country, thus sidelining São Tomé's democratic institutions.\n\nThe military junta further announced, within short it was to inform São Toméan citizens of its new leadership, which was to head the country during a \"transition period\". It further was to \"respect universal democratic principle,\" without outlining any details.\n\nThe Major still has not mentioned his motives for the coup, but analysts agree that the military leaders probably want to get their hands on the poor country's oil resources. Oil production has not started yet, but investments in the sector are already streaming in to the nation.\n\nSão Tomé had established a relatively good democracy record with a low level of tensions, thus making the coup a total surprise. António Branches of the São Toméan daily 'Téla Nón' says military leaders however had accumulated grievances against the civilian leadership during this year. A formal letter of complaint over the army's situation, sent to government in April, still had not produced any results.\n\nThe coup plotters seemingly used the opportunity of President Fradique de Menezes' private journey to Nigeria. The São Toméan President from Abuja made a statement to the Portuguese news agency 'Lusa', saying he was \"very concerned\" and wanted to return to his country as soon as possible. Mr Menezes was said to be meeting with his Nigerian colleague Olusegun Obasanjo to discuss the next moves.\n\nIn Lisbon, São Toméan Foreign Minister Mateus Meira Rita was participating in an extraordinary summit of lusophone countries when receiving the news of the military coup in his country. Mr Rita condemned the coup, which he said probably was staged by the so-called \"Buffalo battalion\", special troops that had been trained in South Africa in the 1980s. He however also said he wished to open a dialogue with the rebels.\n\nThe São Toméan Foreign Minister also assured a condemnation from ex-colony Portugal and partner lusophone countries. Portugal further called on other countries to condemn the coup and not recognising its leaders. Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano further appealed for a speedy return to \"constitutional order\".\n\nPortugal's Ambassador to São Tomé, Mario de Jesus Santos, further has been given the authority to hold talks with the rebels and to hear out their demands for returning power to the country's elected leadership. With the military junta's declaration of a \"transition period\", this however seemed to have failed.\n\nThere have so far not been any talks of a possible military intervention from another country. Ex-colonial power Portugal does not have tradition for such military interventions.\n\nBy Rainer Chr Hennig\n\n© afrol News\n\n- Create an e-mail alert for São Tomé and Príncipe news\n\n- Create an e-mail alert for Politics news\n\nTweet Printable version\n\nOn the Afrol News front page now\n\nRwanda\n\nRwanda succeeds including citizens in formal financial sector\n\nafrol News - It is called \"financial inclusion\", and it is a key government policy in Rwanda.
