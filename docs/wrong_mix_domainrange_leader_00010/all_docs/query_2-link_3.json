        "text": "Main Trait Branch Subsidiary When to incorporate The branch is an extension of the parent company and it can be incorporated when that foreign entity needs a Bulgarian counterpart to conduct the same business operations. The subsidiary is a separate company and it can be used by a foreign corporation that wants to partially control interest in its Bulgarian counterpart. Liability In the case of the branch, the foreign company abroad is fully liable for the debts and obligations of its Bulgarian branch. The subsidiary is liable for its own debts and obligations in Bulgaria, just like any regular resident company. Level of independence The branch has a low level of independence, it reports to the parent company and as far as accountant maintenance are concerned, in some cases, they can be handled jointly. The subsidiary is an autonomous legal entity that may or may not report to the foreign company. It handles its accounts separately."
