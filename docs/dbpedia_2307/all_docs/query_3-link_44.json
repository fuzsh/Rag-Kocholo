A PhD in ancient Indian culture, she is the director of the C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation and C.P.R. Environmental Education Centre. She has pioneered the documentation of the ecological traditions of India, restored over fifty sacred groves, and established schools, the C.P.R. Indological Research Centre, and Shakunthala Jagannathan Museum of Folk Art. Her published works include Sacred Animals of India, Book of Demons, Book of Vishnu, Madras Then Chennai Now, Balaji-Venkateshwara, Ganesha, Painted Manuscripts of the Sarasvati Mahal Library, Arts and Crafts of Tamilnadu, and Art and Iconography of Vishnu Narayana, besides numerous research papers and newspaper articles. She is a professor and research guide for the PhD programme of the University of Madras and has received several prestigious national and international awards. M. Amirthalingam is a botanist and environmental education officer at C.P.R. Environmental Education Centre, Chennai. He has researched and published the books Sacred Groves of Tamil Nadu, Sacred Trees of Tamil Nadu, Temple Tanks of Chennai, and Flora and Fauna of Valmiki’s Ramayana, besides research papers and articles in various journals, magazines, and seminar proceedings. He is currently working on the All India Coordinated Research Project on Sacred Grove Ecosystem Service Assessment in the Inland Plains of Tamil Nadu sponsored by the ministry of environment and forests, Government of India.\n\nIn memory of Shakunthala and A.R. Jagannathan, a source of inspiration, encouragement, and love\n\nForeword India is a highly biodiverse country and at least four major factors are responsible for our rich endowment of plant and animal genetic resources. These are: cultural diversity (including spiritual values), culinary diversity, curative diversity (a wide variety of medicinal plants), and ecosystem diversity. Among these factors, spiritual values have contributed much to saving many important plants and trees. This book contains a fascinating account of numerous sacred trees and groves. The book also describes the efforts made from ancient times to invest on selected trees a sacred aura. The sthala vriksha is a good example of this tradition of celebrating our biological heritage. While reading this book, I was reminded of the following poem by Joyce Kilmer: I think that I shall never see A poem as lovely as a tree. A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast; A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray; A tree that may in summer wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain. Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.\n\nIn 1976, I undertook a study of the oldest trees of India. I wrote to the Chief Conservators of Forests of all states and requested information on the oldest living tree in their state. Most of the replies related to banyan trees including the famous banyan tree of the Theosophical Society, Chennai. Several of the famous banyan trees were also associated with saints and temples. Temple trees such as Excoecaria agallocha of the famous Nataraja Temple at Chidambaram have probably been worshipped because of their importance to life and livelihoods. For example, the temple tree of Chidambaram, which is a mangrove, might have been chosen because mangroves serve as bioshields against coastal storms and tsunamis. My study of the oldest tree of India revealed that a tree belonging to the species Morus serrata may be the oldest one (over 1200 years). Adi Shankara meditated beneath this\n\nspectacularly large mulberry tree in the valley of Joshimath. The age of this tree could be measured only from the year when Adi Shankara preached under it. Thus, there has been a strong correlation between our spiritual history and the history of sacred trees (Indian Farming, February 1977). We owe a deep debt of gratitude to Nanditha Krishna and M. Amirthalingam for capturing the wonderful biological and spiritual heritage of our country in this beautiful book. Chennai PROFESSOR M.S. SWAMINATHAN Chairman C.P.R. Environmental Education Centre\n\nAuthor’s Note When I wake up in the morning and look out of my window, the first thing I see is a cannonball tree with its unkempt stalks weighed down by clusters of flowers, standing on a bed of fallen flowers, which my gardener carefully collects and puts in a wide bowl of water on the dining table. This is intended to be a stress reliever, for such is the quality of the cannonball flower. I was born in an old colonial bungalow on an ancestral property known as ‘The Grove’ in Madras. At the end of the long garden there was, and still is, an ancient pipal tree, beneath which are five snake stones of different shapes and sizes, installed between 1903 and 1905 by my great grandmother, and a Ganesha relief dating back to the late Pallava period. Every day, my morning walk begins with a circumambulation of the pipal tree, the Ganesha, and the snake stones. I remember the days when the new moon arrived on a Monday, and a crowd of women from Teynampet village gathered to circumambulate the tree 108 times. My grandmother had taken the vow too, but, in view of her ill health, I would circumambulate the tree while she sat, prayed, and meditated beneath the pipal tree. And the ubiquitous tulsi still sits proudly in the centre of the open courtyard, within the house. Thus the sacred plants of India’s hoary past have been a part of my own personal tradition and it was inevitable that further research on this subject was essential to comprehend our great inheritance. I have seen sacred plants all over India, from the pipal at Rishikesh to the tulsi at Vrindavan, from the medicinal neem at Vaidishwaran (lord of medicine) temple at Kumbakonam to the khejari in Rajasthan’s sacred groves. And I wondered at the knowledge of our ancient Indians. Many of the stories I have narrated in this book have come to me from elders in my family and those whom either Amirthalingam or I have met in the course of our travels. Others come from Sanskrit and Tamil literature or the sthala purana (local history) of the temple. These are oral traditions, which have held together Indian society. M. Amirthalingam, scientist and environmental education officer at C.P.R. Environmental Education Centre, who has done path-breaking work in documenting sacred groves and sacred trees in Tamil Nadu and in Tamil literature, worked with me to put together this book. This book is thus the result of the combined research of a historian and a botanist, a Sanskritologist and a Tamilologist.\n\nIt is a great honour for us that Dr M.S. Swaminathan, the great scientist and father of the Green Revolution, consented to write the foreword for this book, for which we are truly grateful. Many people have helped us in many ways. Dr P. Sudhakar took the photographs and checked the taxonomy, particularly the new Latin names, which botanists give their plants; Y. Venkatesh and Prema Srinivasan did the drawings; G. Balaji and R. Sathyanarayanan photoshopped the photographs and drawings; S.P. Vijayakumari, librarian of C.P.R. Environmental Education Centre, and V. Kamesh Raj, librarian of C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation, searched and found the books and articles we were looking for; and H. Manikandan carefully preserved the cornucopia of materials that we had collected. Finally, this book would not have been possible but for the interest and enthusiasm shown by Udayan Mitra and Ameya Nagarajan of Penguin India; Ravi Singh, formerly of Penguin India; and Shruti Narain, copy editor at Penguin India, who spent much time and effort in checking every word and line and gave us excellent suggestions to improve the book. I would like to end by saying that trees and forests were regarded as sacred because our ancestors knew their important role in the environment—giving us oxygen to breathe, purifying the air of its pollutants, giving us food to eat and materials to build homes, providing homes for birds and animals, giving us medicines, and so much more. Their knowledge and respect for scientific information was far greater than ours. We cut down trees and destroy forests without a thought for the ill effects on the environment and have taken the earth to the brink of major ecological problems like global warming and climate change. It is never too late to realize that nature is more powerful than humans and will win the final war. For our own well-being, it would help if we preserve the wonderful plants that are abundant in nature. Chennai NANDITHA KRISHNA\n\nPA RT I\n\nIntroduction Bamboo bows drawn taut and lethal arrow heads catching the sun’s glint, the Baigas—a dwindling tribe in the remote jungles of Ranjara in Madhya Pradesh’s Dindori district—are standing guard for their gods against whom they consider state-sponsored marauders. These lush jungles have been their homes for generations and Baigas worship trees as gods. Tribal men, women and children now stand guard, armed against axes and saws—ironically, taking on forest officials who they think are facilitating the ‘slaughter’. The local village panchayat held frequent meetings to protest the forest department’s policy of felling trees. Running out of patience, the panchayat in its recent meeting asked every able man, woman and child to take up their traditional arms to ensure not a single tree is cut … The Baigas, who are nature-worshippers, say trees are their gods and felling them would devastate the ecology. The Times of India, Chennai, 12 April 2012\n\nSacred trees form an important part of the ecological heritage of India. Most temples, towns, and villages—and sometimes even Sikh temples and Muslims dargahs—are associated with trees. Some plants are sacred to the individual deity; others are sacred to the place. Sometimes, the tree is an integral or even larger part of the sanctity of the shrine; towns and cities and dynasties have been named after sacred trees. Several plants have been worshipped in India from time immemorial. Wherever the tulsi grows—from the Indo-Gangetic plains to the shores of the Indian Ocean at Kanyakumari—it occupies a position of pride in the central courtyard of the house, tended carefully by the housewife. Apart from the elaborate myths connecting it to Lord Krishna, the tulsi plant has several medicinal properties (Figure 1). The leaves are swallowed to prevent colds, headaches, stomach disorders and even heart problems, and are used extensively in Ayurvedic medicine. Tulsi is often powdered and drunk as a tea, or just eaten as fresh leaves. To protect and revere this plant with so many medicinal properties, it was designated as sacred, a fitting tribute to its role in providing invaluable healthcare.\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe worship of plants is an ancient phenomenon in India. It is probably the oldest form of worship. The association of a single tree with a sacred sthala or sthan is reflected in the chaitya vriksha and sthala vriksha (explained below) of literature and society. The plants that were sanctified reveal the socio-economic and health concerns of ancient peoples. Some were sanctified for their economic role, some for their produce, some for providing homes for animals and birds, and others for their medicinal and airpurifying qualities. The process reveals the people’s knowledge of their environment and its conservation. Tree worship is documented in all ancient societies all over the world. The earliest form of worship was probably the veneration of the tree. When people turned to food production, the Mother Goddess or the Earth Mother became the chief deity. Fertility, creation, and the world of plants and animals became her blessings to her devotees. The worship of the tree was the adoration of her creative abilities, symbolizing fertility so essential for the survival of the early people. Spirits—good and bad—were believed to reside in trees. If the trees were worshipped, then the resident spirits were pleased. As sacred forests were replaced by agriculture, a single tree was left, which was designated as the sacred tree. The earliest temples were little more than images placed under trees. Later, the tree and the image were enclosed by a fence made of wood, followed even later by stone. The temple was a later construction. Numerous references are made in literature to trees as abodes of gods. They sheltered the object of worship: a deity, a fetish, a weapon, or any other. As the open-air shrine beneath the tree was replaced by a shrine or temple for the deity, the tree became the sthala vriksha of the temple; the tree was associated with the deity and became an inseparable part of the local mythology. The sthala vrikshas of India constitute the single genetic resource for the conservation of species diversity. The sthala vrikshas once played a major role in local ecology and their worship celebrates our biological heritage. The sacred tree had many names: kalpa vriksha (tree of life which grants wishes), chaitya vriksha (tree shrine), and sthala vriksha (tree of the sacred site). There are many\n\nplaces that are named after sacred plants like Vrindavan, forest of the vrinda (tulsi or basil plant), near Mathura in the north, or Kanchipuram, town of the Kanchi (river portia tree), near Chennai in the south. Clans like Kaushika, Pallava, and Kadamba were named for grass, leaf, and flower respectively. Sacred trees are generally associated with Hindu deities, Jaina Tirthankaras, and the Buddha. During the medieval period, each temple had its sthala purana or story of the sacred site written, which emphasized the sacred characteristics of the tree and the water body associated with the temple. Trees were revered for any one of four primary reasons: for their medicinal qualities, such as the neem and the tulsi; for their economic value, such as the Alexandrian laurel which was used to build catamarans and ships off the Coromandel Coast; for their ecological importance, such as the mangrove in Chidambaram; and for their sociocultural role, such as the banyan, the meeting place of the Bania or business community.\n\nIn the Beginning … Plant worship is probably the oldest form of religion, because of the sheer magnificence and antiquity of huge trees. The Rig Veda (X.97) says that plants are ‘those that grew in old times … much earlier than even the shining ones [devas] … and are different from many different places …’ Plants were a source of energy, with healing powers, and personified the divine. Agni says ‘in plants and herbs … I have deposited the germ of increase’ (Rig Veda, X.183.3). The tree is the ‘lord of the forest … whose praises never fail’ (Rig Veda, IX.12.7), a symbol of self-regenerating life and immortality. A medicinal herb is a goddess born on earth (Atharva Veda, VI.136). Trees were called vanaspati or ‘lord of the forest’ and invoked as deities along with the waters and mountains. The Rig Veda (X.146) invokes the forest as Aranyani, a jungle deity. Indus–Saraswati Civilization There are several examples of tree worship on the seals of the Indus–Saraswati civilization. Of these, the sacred fig or pipal (Ficus religiosa) and the Indian mesquite or shami (Prosopis spicigera) are represented more frequently than other trees of doubtful identity and suggest that this was an important aspect of the Indus civilization. Trees are placed on a pedestal or fenced in, like village trees and sacred trees in temples (Figures 2[a] and [b]). On a steatite seal from Mohenjo Daro, a figure with a horned headdress, long braid, and bangles on both arms stands within a pipal tree. On one side, there is a kneeling worshipper and a gigantic ram—possibly a sacrificial offering. A human head rests on a small stool. Seven male figures are in procession below—possibly the sapta rishi of Vedic religion, a hierarchy working under the guidance of the Supreme Being, identified with the seven stars of the Big Dipper or Ursa Major. All the figures are dressed identically, with a single plumed headdress, bangles, and folded dhotis. The figures along the top of the seal are interspersed with pictographs and a single sign at the base of the tree (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 2(a)\n\nFigure 2(b)\n\nAccording to Buddhist scriptures, sacrifices were performed to yakshas or spirits of the trees (Coomaraswamy [1928] 1980, I.25; II.9). Even today, Hindus circumambulate the pipal seven times to the prayer vriksha rajaya namah. This seal may be a Harappan origin of this ritual. Other signs of pipal worship include a tree growing out of a central hub flanked by two unicorn heads, with pictograms below (Figure 4); a male figure—probably the spirit of the tree or yaksha—standing within a stylized pipal tree, a recurring theme on several mass-produced moulded pieces as well as on seals (Figure 5); and a nude male deity with a single branch bearing three pipal leaves rising from the middle of his headdress. The male figure has three faces, one facing front, one facing left, and one facing right. He is seated in a yogic posture, with bangles on both arms and an elaborate headdress of two outward buffalo-style curved horns (Figure 6). This person could only be Lord Shiva, the three-faced Trimukha or Trimurti, incorporating the Creator, the Preserver, and the Destroyer as he is celebrated in later art, such as the 8th century caves at Elephanta near Mumbai. This is also an early form of Dakshinamurti, or Shiva as a teacher sitting beneath a pipal tree. The Rig Veda (X.97.5) refers to the Supreme Being thus: ‘Your abode is the ashvattha tree; your dwelling is made of its leaves.’\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 6\n\nFigure 7\n\nWhile male figures stand within the pipal, a female figure with an arm stretched out sits on the shami or khejari and a tiger looks back at her (Figure 7). This theme is repeated on several seals and bas-relief tablets from Mohenjo Daro, where the tiger invariably looks back at a woman seated with one leg folded beneath the other, possibly in a yogic posture, on a shami tree. This is obviously the spirit of the tree, accompanied by the tiger, since no ordinary mortal would be accompanied by a tiger. Sometimes, a flying bird faces the woman and a bull precedes the tiger (Figure 8). In an unusual seal, a shamanic ritual is portrayed, wherein a woman with a horned headdress either dances or fights with a tiger. The tree behind the woman has fern-like leaves and is not the khejari (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 8\n\nFigure 9\n\nFigure 10\n\nAnother terracotta seal displays a framed swastika with a khejari tree on which sits the kneeling woman and the inevitable tiger looking back on one side, and an elephant on the reverse (Figure 10). In the next seal, there is a composite figure with the body of a tiger and the head of a woman with a long braid and horns on her head while a khejari grows out of the centre of her head (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 11\n\nThe tiger is the vahana (vehicle) and companion of the goddess, Shakti or Durga, who alone could quell the carnivore, a symbol of fertility. Could the woman on the tree be a proto-Durga who, in later tradition, rides the tiger? The khejari is the tree of Katyayani, a form of Durga. In Tamil literary sources about the five geographical divisions of land (aindu tinai) (Krishnan 2005, 34–36), Kotravai (or Durga, goddess of war) is the deity of the paalai or desert, as described by the Tolkappiyam (Raman 2005, 18), the earliest extant Tamil book (circa 200 BCE) and repeated in later Sangam literature. Kotravai comes from the Tamil kotraan, a desert plant of doubtful identity (Tamil Lexicon 1982, II.1167). In all the seals of the woman, the tree, and the tiger, the tree is invariably the shami, better known as the khejari; it is a desert plant, which lends credence to the theory of an Indus–Saraswati civilization, where the river had started to dry up. Even today, the Bishnois of the Rajasthan desert regard the khejari as their sacred tree, essential for their survival, and have given up their lives to protect the plant. The entire Chipko movement is based on the protection of the sacred khejari or shami, for which 363 Bishnois gave up their lives in 1731 and which led to the international ‘Hug a Tree’ movement. The worship of the khejari apparently goes back to the earliest civilizations of India. The female figure beside the khejari separates two battling tigers (Figure 12), or appears with a sapling growing between her horns. In an unusual seal from Harappa, a woman delivers a plant (Figure 13).\n\nFigure 12\n\nFigure 13\n\nIn the Vedic tradition, the shami was credited with the ability to produce fire. A legend in the Rig Veda (X.95.1–18) states that Pururavas created the primeval fire by striking a branch of the shami against one of the ashvattha (pipal). In later literature and tradition, the khejari is a feminine tree, identified with the Mother Goddess as Shamidevi (Stutley 1985, 122) while Shiva (as Dakshinamurti), the Buddha, and the Jaina Tirthankara Anantanatha—all men—sit in meditation beneath the pipal tree. The spirit of the tree, the yaksha or yakshi, is as old as the Indus–Saraswati civilization, giving sanctity to the tree within which he or she dwells. Tree Worship in Central Indian Cave Paintings Deep in the heart of the Indian subcontinent, in central India, are the caves and rock shelters of the Vindhya and Satpura Ranges in Madhya Pradesh, home to Bhimbetka (Raisen district), a living art gallery of Stone Age people, where their lives and concerns, and their efforts to survive the wildlife that surrounded them, are depicted vividly. The caves have managed to preserve the wonderful paintings for posterity. The entire area is covered with thick vegetation, abundant natural resources, flora, and fauna. The paintings depict the lives and times of the people who lived in the caves as well as the natural environment. Although trees were possibly the earliest objects of worship, there are few scenes of tree worship in rock art. In rock shelter number 10, there is a painting of a tree on which is\n\nseated a peacock; a man holds a sword and kneels to the right of the tree. On the left is a row of dancing people. I have little doubt that this is a Mesolithic (10,000–4000 years BP) scene of tree worship, in spite of the poor quality of the painting (Figure 14). In another Mesolithic scene, ceremonial-costumed figures dance around a tree held by a kneeling figure. Alpana- or kolam-like designs to the right of the tree suggest that this was some kind of celebration (Wakankar 1975, 20) (Figure 15). A dark red tree, possibly a kalpa vriksha, appears on an Early Historic (2500–2000 years BP) painting from Kharwai, also situated in Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh. Two peacocks stand to the right of the tree. The tree resembles the kalpa vriksha found in the art of Sanchi, Vidisha, and elsewhere (Figure 16).\n\nFigure 14\n\nFigure 15\n\nFigure 16\n\nTree Worship in the Vedas The Rig Veda mentions the plants tabulated below, all regarded as sacred in later literature. The plants mentioned in the Rig Veda are regarded as sacred because they appear in the Samhita. The Aryans of the early Vedic period were pantheists, worshippers of nature. The same trees were worshipped in both the Harappan sites and in the Vedas, indicating that they shared the same culture and traditions. Trees are very important for locating a text. The plants of the Rig Veda situate the Veda in the subtropical plains of India and Pakistan. Just like the fauna of the Rig Veda is obviously Indian, with peacocks (mayura), swans (hamsa), water buffaloes (mahisha), Indian bison (gaura), camel (ushtra), monkey (kapi), crocodile (makshika), elephants (varana), and horse (ashva)—all of which are common to the region. While scholars may debate over the origins of the Veda, there can be no denying geography. People will only write about the plants and animals that they are familiar with. There are no cold or temperate climate plants in the Rig Veda, not even the Kashmiri deodar. Soma is the most important plant in the Rig Veda. Mandala IX of the Rig Veda is called the Soma mandala, devoted to the ritual of soma pavamana or ‘purification of soma’, and six hymns in other mandalas are devoted to its praise. Soma was a ritual drink extracted from a plant. Where did the soma plant grow? According to the Mahabharata (10.785; 14.180), it grew on Mujavant, a mountain located in the Himalayas. North India is full of mountains, and Mujavant could be anywhere in the foothills. The plant had long stalks and was yellow in colour. The soma drink was prepared by priests who pounded the plant with stones. The juice was filtered through lamb’s wool and mixed with other ingredients (including cow’s milk) before it could be drunk. The imbiber became immortal (Rig Veda, VIII.48). This final statement sounds as if there is an element of fantasy about the soma: after all, immortality is still unknown! Soma was regarded as the oshadhipati or ‘lord of medicine’ and was regarded as a deity. There are many Rig Vedic descriptions of the mysterious soma plant that may correlate with the known stages or aspects of fly agaric (psychotropic mushroom), botanically known as Amanita muscaria, which grows in mountainous regions like the Himalayas. The theory that it had a Central Asian origin is untenable, especially when all the other Vedic plants belong to this region. Sacred Plants of the Rig Veda\n\nBhang, still commonly consumed as an intoxicant during festivals and weddings in north India, is one of the epithets used to refer to soma in the Rig Veda (IX.61, 13), suggesting that soma was nothing more mysterious than bhang or hemp (Cannabis sativa), a medicinal shrub that grows on the foothills of the Himalayas and in the hills of Pakistan. If so, there is no mystery about soma.\n\nIn the Vedic period, all of nature was, in some sense, divine—part of an indivisible life force uniting the world of humans, animals, and vegetables. Besides trees, grasses and herbs were also held sacred. Trees, says the Rig Veda, are the homes and mansions of the gods (X.97.4). The udumbara (cluster fig) was used for making the yupa (sacrificial pole), udumbara and khadira for making the sruva (ladle), nyagrodha for making the chamasa (sacrificial bowl), and bilva for its fruit and for making the yupa for the sacrifice. Varuna is the root of the Tree of Life, the source of all creation (Rig Veda, I.24, 7), a great yaksha reclining in tapas (meditation) on the waters from wherein a tree springs from his navel (Atharva Veda, X.7, 38). In the Yajur Veda (V.6, 4), this quality is inherited by Prajapati and, in the Mahabharata, by Narayana. The tree is the ashvattha but later the Creator was seated on the lotus, which issued from Narayana’s navel. The pipal was held in great esteem in the Vedic period. A tree of huge dimensions, it was symbolic of the cosmos and even of the Brahman. The imperishable pipal was later called the akshaya vata, the eternal tree. The pipal tree was the basis of a profound metaphysical doctrine in Rig Vedic and later Vedic literature. The Rig Veda (X.97) says that plants personify the divine and trees are the Vanaspati or lords of the forest, self-regenerating and eternal. Medicinal herbs are goddesses, according to the Atharva Veda. Forests are deities, called Aranyani. There are significant references to tree worship in the Atharva Veda (XIX.39, 6), which says that the ashvattha is the abode of the gods (ashvattho deva sadanah). The Atharva Veda says that the gods sit beneath the pipal tree in heaven. There are several references in the Atharva Veda to folk cults, including those that worshipped trees, spirits, and demons. There are also numerous hymns and verses where the tree was not only an object of worship but also a symbol of the cosmic tree of life. The common pipal tree symbolized the universe long before the Buddha obtained enlightenment beneath it. The Shvetashvatara Upanishad (3.9) says that a tree of huge dimensions filling the space around it with its numerous branches and foliage, with a lofty trunk and many stems rising high in the sky, was the symbol of the Cosmic Tree or Brahman. According to the Chandogya Upanishad (6.11), the Cosmic Tree symbolizes life while the Taittiriya Brahmana equates Brahma with the forest and the tree: Brahma tad vanam, Brahma sa vriksha asa (Brahma is the forest, Brahma is the tree; Rig Veda, X.81.4; Taittiriya Brahmana, II.8.9.6). The description resembles the banyan. Several other trees are listed as sacred: pipal, banyan, shami, flame of the forest, cluster fig, and Indian gooseberry (Chandogya Upanishad, 6.11). The branches of the pipal and shami were used to kindle the sacred fire. The Indian plum is another tree frequently mentioned in the Atharva Veda. It was, in all probability, popular in the Rig Vedic period also, for its wood was used to make sacrificial bowls. The Papavimochana Sukta of the Atharva Veda (XI.5, 1–23) has an invocation to numerous deities for deliverance from distress, which includes trees (vanaspati), herbs\n\n(aushadhi) and plants (virudha). The soft wood of the shami and the pipal was, as the lower and upper sticks, used for kindling the sacred fire. The fruit of the shami tree is called shamidhanya (Agrawala 1970, 115). The Rig Veda mentions the word naicashaakha, which has been described as ‘worshippers of the banyan tree’, whom the Veda finds distasteful because they indulged in human sacrifices. This is reminiscent of the Indus seal (Figure 3), where a worshipper offers a human head and a ram to a pipal tree within which stands a male figure.\n\nTree Worship in the Epics, Puranas, Jainism, and Buddhism There are sacred trees for each yuga.* The sandalwood tree (Santalum album) is the sacred tree of the Satya or Krita Yuga; champaka (Michelia champaca) of the Treta Yuga; the capper bush (Cleome fruiticosa) of the Dwapara Yuga; and the jackfruit tree of the Kali Yuga. Thus every era had its own sacred tree. The Ramayana and Mahabharata make several references to the worship of sacred plants and trees. It is evident that the Ramayana is not the product of poet Valmiki’s imagination and not at all far-fetched. Valmiki’s botanical information, like his geography, is authentic. Valmiki points out a plant’s geography and distribution and gives ethnic information of his times. Valmiki also frequently brings out the now-forgotten uses of plants. His Ramayana is the product of a single author and the text is a highly reliable account of that period, including edible and non-edible vegetation, sacred plants, medicinal plants, and forest ecosystems. Four sentiments dominate the forest environment: shanta (calm), madhura (sweetness), raudra (anger), and vibhatsa (disgust) (Amirthalingam and Sudhakar 2013, 13). The thick forests include Naimisha-aranya, Chitrakuta and Dandakaranya, Panchavati, Kishkinda, and Ashoka vana. The scope ranges from Ayodhya in modern Uttar Pradesh to Sri Lanka, giving a comprehensive idea of the different natural regions that fall within this area, which covers several major ecosystems: tropical dry deciduous (Chitrakuta and Dandakaranya), tropical deciduous (Panchavati), dry and moist deciduous (Kishkinda), alpine semi-forests (Himalayas, from where Hanuman plucked the sanjivani plant from Meru), and evergreen tropical forests (Sri Lanka). According to the Ramayana, there were several types of sacred trees. The rathya vriksha or roadside trees and the devata nishthana vrikshas or abodes of deities were further divided into the yaksha chaitya (yaksha’s tree shrine) and chaitya vriksha (tree shrine). There were also the chaturpatha varthi vriksha (tree at the junction of crossroads with revetments around its trunk) and smashana vriksha (tree grown on the cremation grounds) (Ramayana, 2.3.18; 50.8; 5.12.18; 22–29). Sita, on her way to the forest, worshipped and circumambulated a large banyan tree on the banks of River Kalindi, entreating it to enable her husband to fulfil his vow (Amirthalingam and Sudhakar 2013, 18). The forest of Dandaka, where Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita lived, and the grove of ashoka trees where Sita was imprisoned in Lanka are still sacred. The Ramayana makes several references to the worship of sacred plants and trees like the tulsi, pipal, banyan, and Indian gooseberry.\n\nThe Ramayana describes a wooden ritual post made of sleshmaataka wood (1.14.22– 23). Six poles of bilva tree were also erected as yupas (1.4.22), as were poles of the cutch tree, for the yagna (1.4.2). When Rama and Lakshmana were scouring the forest for Sita, they came across a badari tree. They asked the tree whether it had seen Sita. The tree answered in the affirmative and pointed in the direction in which Sita had gone. Pleased, Rama blessed the tree and gave it a boon that it would never die. In another incident, Rama came across Sabari, a poor tribal woman who was his great devotee. She tasted each and every badari fruit to see whether it was tasty before offering it to Rama. Rama said that anything offered to him with a pure heart and genuine love was clean and pure. Since then, the fruit has been regarded as sacred and is included in religious ceremonies. There were strict injunctions against the felling of trees in Lanka. Ravana says that he had never cut down a fig tree in the month of Vaisakha (April–May), and so he could not understand why fate was cruel to him. The Ramayana says that even during the reign of Ravana, the planting of trees was considered a worthy objective. There was a popular belief that the cutting of trees would bring about the destruction of the woodcutter and his family (Bhatla, Mukherjee, and Singh 1984, 37–42). The darbha grass, cut in bunches and spread out as a seat with the ends pointing eastwards, was used for sacred purposes (Ramayana, 1.3.2), while the grass was pointed in the opposite direction during the performance of the shraaddha or death ceremony (Ramayana, 2.104.8). The fresh leaf blade, elongated and pointing with sapphire-like lustre, was used as a missile by Rama (Ramayana, 5.38.29). The story of the origin of kusha grass and its religious importance is reinforced after Sita’s bhumi praveshah, when she entered the earth to leave this world. Sita prayed to her mother, the Earth, to take her back. The earth opened up. Her son Kusha ran forward to save his mother but could grasp only her hair. The hair turned to grass, and it was named for Kusha as he had tried to save her. Since then the kusha grass is held sacred and used in various rituals (Uttara kanda of the Ramayana). The Mahabharata (Southern Recension, 12.69, 41 ff) says that holy trees should not be injured as they are the abodes of devas, yakshas, rakshasas, and so on. The epic says that the yaksha is a vrikshavasin (tree dweller) (2.10, 399) and that trees have life (2.18.15– 17). It has several references to the worship of plants. Many were regarded as deities. Plants such as the basil, pipal, banyan, and Indian gooseberry were worshipped by the common people. In the Adiparva (138.25), the epic says the human heart makes man regard plants and trees with sanctity and as worthy of worship. The Mahabharata (3.187–89) also says that during the maha pralaya (great flood), the sage Markandeya was wandering around the huge abyss of water when he saw a child floating on the leaf of the banyan tree. The child identified himself as Narayana, the\n\nresting place of souls, the Creator and Destroyer of the Universe. The motif of the child on the leaf appears often in later Tamil literature and art. According to the Tamil epic Manimekhalai (XXV.178–192; XXIX.3–10), a Chola king went to the land of the Nagas and fell in love with a Naga princess who bore him a son, whom she sent to the king with a tondai or Indian caper creeper tied around him, as a mark of identification. As the ship was lost in a storm, the waves brought the child to the shore, giving him the name Tirai Taru or ‘given by the waves’. The Perumbaanaatruppadai (30–31) says that the child was Narayana, ancestor of Tondaiman Ilan Tiraiyan, ruler of Tondaimandalam in north Tamil Nadu, the land named for the Indian caper creeper on which he was found. An Amaravati inscription also says that Drona’s son Ashvatthama and an apsara (water divinity) had a child that was kept on a tender leaf. Such associations made the plants sacred (Krishna 1980, 7–8). Much later, the popular image of the child Krishna floating on a banyan leaf in the ocean was identified with Krishna and named Vata-patra-shayi, or ‘he who rests on the banyan leaf’. The cult of Krishna furthered the worship of trees. Krishna lived in a village surrounded by forests full of trees and told his friends to worship the beautiful trees that lived for the benefit of others. Every part of the tree, he said, is useful and everyone who approaches a tree benefits from it. Krishna advised the cowherds to follow the example of the tree in their lives. His attribute was the flute, a simple wind instrument made of bamboo, which he played in the vrinda or tulsi forest on the banks of the Yamuna River on moonlit nights. His favourite tree was the kadamba, which appears beside his image. While planning the city of Dwarka, Krishna fought Indra to bring the divine parijata (night flowering jasmine) tree to earth. His love of trees was translated into nikunja lila (play in the bower or arbour) by the Premopasaka Sampradayis of Braj, according to which devotees should meditate upon the divine couple Radha and Krishna’s nikunja lila and attain spiritual bliss as the path for attaining total happiness. The Mundaka Upanishad describes the Tree of Life on which dwell two birds in eternal camaraderie, one of which eats the fruits while the other looks on silently. The two represent vitality and reflection, Nara and Narayana, man and the divine. The root of this symbolism is found in the Rig Vedic hymn of Dirghatamas represented by the Tree of Life (Rig Veda, I.22.164.20). Puranic and Later Literature The Vamana Purana (Lal, Singh, and Mishra 2014, 18) identifies some plants with specific gods and goddesses. The lotus, a water plant which rose from the navel of Lord Vishnu, is the seat of Brahma the Creator. The thorn apple arose from the chest of Shiva. The cutch tree was created from the middle of the body of Brahma. The tamarind was created from the palm of Parvati. The five-leaved chaste plant emerged from the forehead of Ganesha.\n\nThe flame of the forest came out of the right side of Yama. The fig tree came out of the north-south side of Yama. The bamboo emerged from Rudra. The bamboo emerged from Skanda also. The pipal emerged from the sun. The shami came from Katyayani (Durga). The Bengal quince emerged from Lakshmi. Reeds came out of Nagaraja, the lord of serpents. The cotton-wool grass came from the snake king Vasuki.\n\nThe Matsya Purana and the Padma Purana describe a great tree plantation ceremony called the vriksha mahotsava. The Matsya Purana (154, 506–12) equates the planting of a tree with ten sons. In the Narasimha Purana (15, 7), the tree is equated with Lord Brahma himself. According to a popular myth, Shiva and Parvati were once enjoying privacy when Agni, the god of fire, suddenly entered the room without permission. Since her privacy was disturbed, Parvati got very angry, and was even more enraged when she realized that Shiva had not felt that there was anything wrong with Agni’s actions! She cursed all the devas to appear on earth in the form of trees. Fearing her curse, the devas approached her and explained that if all of them were to turn into trees, demons would be strengthened. Once they became strong, they would rule the world. There would be no one to control them, which would cause the spread of anarchy everywhere. They begged her to revoke the curse. Parvati replied that her curse could not be taken back but, if not as full trees, the gods would partly live inside trees. Hence Lord Vishnu entered the pipal, Lord Shiva the banyan, and Goddess Lakshmi the neem, thus sanctifying the three. In the Vishnu Sahasranamam (thousand names of Vishnu), the cluster fig, pipal, ashoka, and banyan are some of the names of Vishnu, while Shiva is conceived as a yupa made of shami wood. Parvati is aparna or leafless, suggesting that even the dry tree trunk bears shoots when associated with Goddess Aparna. In the Puranas, the Vanadevatas are happy forest deities. Cheta (mischief-maker) in the Mrichhakatika presumes that the (watchful) eye of the Vanadevata is as effective as that of the sun and the moon that are witnesses to the good and bad deeds of human beings. This is a traditional belief that has made trees and forests into earthly representatives of divinity. Finally, according to the Vishnudharmottara, each of the Sapta Matrikas (seven mothers, also called sapta kanni) sits beneath a tree. The seven mothers and their trees are as follows (Gopinatha Rao 1971, 145–58): 1. Brahmani: palasha (flame of the forest) 2. Vaishnavi: raja vriksha (royal tree; chirauli nut) 3. Indrani: kalpaka (turmeric or Curcuma) 4. Chamunda: plaksha (cluster fig) 5. Maheshwari: pundarika (lotus) 6. Kaumari: plaksha (cluster fig)\n\n7. Varahi: kalpaka (turmeric or Curcuma)\n\nFigure 17\n\nPunch-marked coins from Magadha (600–400 BCE) depict stylized and fenced trees with branches growing on either side of the stem. On later punch-marked coins, trees have been depicted within and outside a circle. In cast copper coins dating to the 3rd century BCE from Rajagriha, Sarnath, and Kausambi, trees are again depicted within a fence. A fenced tree was a sacred tree. In a coin of Agathocles (200 BCE) from Ai Khanum (Kunduz Province, north Afghanistan), there is a tree inside a railing (Figure 17). Even today, many Muslim villagers in Pakistan and Afghanistan tie strings and cradles to trees, in a prayer for progeny. Jainism Buddhism and Jainism, being offshoots of the Vedic religion, continued many of the earlier traditions. One of these was the sanctity of the tree, particularly the pipal. Each form of the Buddha and each of the Jaina Tirthankaras was associated with his own tree, under which he attained enlightenment. Plants and trees played an important role in Jainism. Although the historical founder of Jainism was Mahavira (599–27 BCE), the Jaina Purana and Charitra mention that Mahavira was the twenty-fourth Tirthankara. Jainism was closely associated with Hinduism, and Jainas continue to consider themselves to be members of the Hindu community, celebrating the same festivals and intermarrying with Hindus. Numerous plants and trees were held sacred and associated with the Tirthankaras, each of whom had an animal symbol and his own specific tree (see table below) under which he received kevala (special knowledge), like the Bodhisattvas. Each Tirthankara was also associated with a yaksha or yakshi, recognized as the spirit of the tree. Thus trees and plants enjoyed and played an important role in the religious traditions of Jainism. Jainism was concerned with the natural world. However, while trees and flowers were profusely used as ornamentation, they were rarely regarded as objects of worship. Nevertheless, in a frieze in the Jaya-Vijaya Gumpha, Cave 5, at Udayagiri (Odisha), there is a scene of a sacred tree, probably the pipal, with an umbrella above and a banner on either side, enclosed within a railing and being worshipped by a couple on either side. The\n\nmen have folded hands while the women carry trays of flowers and garlands. As Jainism was not influenced by Buddhism, this is yet another proof that the worship of the pipal tree long preceded the Buddha and was merely adopted by the Buddhists. Similarly, in Cave 3 (Anantagumpha) at Khandagiri in Odisha, a sacred pipal under an umbrella and within a railing is worshipped by a couple and two other persons.

Bhattacharya 1974, 34–60 Special mention needs to be made of the beautiful lotus. The sacredness attached to the flower and the philosophical symbolism gave it a special status in Indian art and it appears frequently in early Indian art. Buddhism In early Buddhist monuments, the Buddha (563–483 BCE) was never represented in human form but as his symbol, the tree. The tree is a substitute for the Buddha himself, as are other symbols like the dharma chakra, footsteps, and so on. There are several scenes of common people, kings, queens, and Brahmanas worshipping the Buddha represented as a tree, mounted on a platform and festooned with garlands. In the sculptures at Bharhut and Sanchi, we find people and animals paying obeisance to several sacred trees, representing the various stages of enlightenment of the Buddha. Gautama Buddha chose groves for his discourses and pointed to the roots of trees as the source of knowledge. His followers were advised to live in forests amid plants and animals. Later literature—the Pali Jatakas and Sutras—built up an elaborate mythology and identified three types of Buddhas: Dhyani (meditating), Manushi (mortal), and Bodhisattvas (future Buddhas). All the Buddhas\n\nreceived enlightenment under various bodhi trees. Tree worship was known as rukkhamaha in the Rukkha Dhamma Jataka (Gupte 1972, 108–10). Four trees are associated with the enlightenment of the Buddha. He sat under a pipal on the banks of the Niranjana River for the first seven days, in the bliss of his enlightenment; then he arose and sat under a nyagrodha for another seven days, in the bliss of his illumination; then he sat beneath a muchalinda (Indian oak) for another seven days, in the bliss of his calm; and, finally, he sat beneath a rajayatana (wild mango or Buchanania latifolia) for seven days, in the bliss of his emancipation. The four trees are known as the Tree of Enlightenment, the Tree of the Goatherd, the Tree of Muchalinda, and the Tree of Emancipation, respectively. The muchalinda was named after the serpent king who protected the Buddha from the storm that raged as he was meditating. According to the Pali canons, every Buddha has his bodhi tree (Kanitkar 2011, 175). The bodhi tree of Sikhin is a white lotus. The fig tree is the symbol of Kanak muni or Konagamana. According to Buddhaghosha’s description, it cannot have flowers. An old Indian belief states: ‘He who sees the flowers of the fig tree becomes a monarch.’ The bodhi tree of Buddha Kakut Sandha is the acacia, which abounds with fruits and flowers. A carving on a medallion at Sanchi depicts the bodhi tree under which Buddha Vipachit received enlightenment as the trumpet flower tree. The bodhi tree of Buddha Vishvabhrit is similar to that of Vipachit. According to another Buddhist tradition, the bodhi tree of Sikhin is the white mango, adorned with fragrant flowers and rich in delicious, juicy fruits, hanging together from the same stalk. The ashoka tree was the bodhi tree of Buddha Vipaswi. This tree was sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists. It was also the tree under which Gautama Buddha was born. Buddha Kapilavastu was associated with the Indian black plum tree. According to Buddhaghosha, the traditional bodhi tree of Vishvabhu was the sal. Bodhisattva Maitreya, the eighth Buddha was associated with the champaka tree.\n\nFigure 18\n\nA special form of temple was constructed around the bodhi tree, consisting of a gallery, supported by pillars, encircling the tree. Many reliefs depicting this form of worship are found at Bharhut, Sanchi, Mathura, and Amaravati. Seven bodhi trees represent seven different Manushi Buddhas in the stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi: paatali for Vipasyin (Figure 18), shala for Vishvabhu (Figure 19), shirisha for Krakucchanda (Figure 20), udumbara for Kanakamuni (Figure 21), nyagrodha for Kashyapa (Figure 22), pundarika for Sikhin (Figure 23), and pipala for Shakyamuni (Gautama Buddha) (Figure 24). The identification of these Buddhas on the basis of their bodhi trees was done with the aid of a panel, which contains the names of the Buddhas inscribed below their respective bodhi\n\ntrees (Srivastava 1983, 135). Interestingly, only the Mahapadana Suttanta mentions, in passing, the bodhi trees of the seven Buddhas, including the ashvattha.\n\nFigure 19\n\nFigure 20\n\nFigure 21\n\nFigure 22\n\nAmong the most famous scenes in the Bharhut stupa is the worship of the shirisha (Albizia lebbek Benth.) by the Naga Erapatra who wanted to decipher an inscription. He approached sage Narada, who bared his right shoulder in the direction of the deer park at Sarnath where the Master was preaching. In this relief, Erapatra worships the Buddha in\n\nthe form of the bodhi tree. The panel is inscribed as erapatra naga raja bhagavato vandate, or ‘the Naga king Erapatra worships the Lord’ (Figure 25), where Lord Buddha is represented by the Sacred Tree.\n\nFigure 23\n\nAnother much-worshipped tree at Bharhut is Mangifera indica or the mango, which represents good luck and fertility. On the Ajatashatru pillar, the Buddha, wearing two topknots, worships the mango tree along with many others. The scene represents the visit of King Ajatashatru to the Buddha (Figure 26). The mango tree is worshipped in several panels. It is interesting to note that whereas the Buddha is never represented in the Sungan art of Bharhut, he is present in scenes of obeisance to the mango tree alone. This may be an indication of the importance of the mango tree which, even today, is an auspicious symbol.\n\nFigure 24\n\nFigure 25\n\nBut it is the Ficus religiosa or pipal that appears in most panels at Bharhut: after all, the pipal is the Tree of Enlightenment. The pipal on the Prasenajit pillar is surrounded by a chaitya, beautifully decorated with an umbrella above, a platform below, and flower garlands, worshipped by two seated men, a standing man and woman, and two men above the chaitya. Another scene of pipal worship includes four kings on their elephants representing the four quarters above the tree. Yet another scene celebrates the greatness of the pipal: standing on a platform, decorated with garlands, two monkeys offer honey to the tree, while two women and two men stand beside it and two women and a child kneel before it (Figure 27).\n\nFigure 26\n\nThe bas-reliefs at Sanchi represent the simple religious action of worshipping trees. Sanchi Stupa I is known for its imposing gateways facing the four directions. Each gateway has two pillars supporting a superstructure of three horizontal curved architraves with spirally rolled ends. Between the architraves are three uprights. The architraves are filled with stories from five Buddhist Jatakas, and from events in the Buddha’s life. The Buddha is represented as a tree all over the gateways, even when he is descending a ladder from the Trayastrimsa heaven, accompanied by Brahma and Shakra (Figure 28). Sujata offers the Buddha—represented by a kalpa vriksha—payasa (sweet rice pudding) on his day of enlightenment. Ashoka’s visit to the sacred bodhi tree of Bodh Gaya has also been recorded on the western gateway (Figure 29). There are several varieties of kalpavalli, the wish-fulfilling creeper, producing jewelled ornaments and garlands. The motif that, like many others, owes its origin to popular beliefs and religion, was appropriated by the Buddhists to edify their own faith.\n\nFigure 27\n\nFigure 28\n\nFigure 29\n\nThe nyagrodha or banyan is the grand old tree of India. On the Sanchi stupa, it is worshipped by elephants in one scene and by royalty—a king and a queen—with retinue in another (Figure 30). There are several scenes of Gaja Lakshmi sitting on an open lotus, flanked by two elephants raining streams of water on the goddess. The lotus is depicted in several beautiful ways, particularly in the form of a variety of medallions on Stupa 2. There is a beautiful medallion with a graceful woman seated on a lotus amidst lotus stalks, flowers, and rhizomes (Figure 31).\n\nFigure 30\n\nIn Buddhism, the Nidanakatha says that a white elephant carrying a white lotus in his trunk circumambulated Mayadevi three times and entered her right side. The Buddha’s purity is likened to a lotus in water by the Lalitavistara. The Nidanakatha and Buddhacharita say that the Bodhisattva mounted the great lotus and surveyed the four quarters. When he walked, seven lotuses appeared, one for each step. Maya sits on a lotus throne or padmasana in Sanchi. Five kinds of lotuses are referred to in the Jatakas, of which four are portrayed in Sanchi. In some panels, Siddhartha’s birth is represented by a bunch of lotuses in a vase. The exuberance of lotuses in Buddhist monuments since Bharhut and Sanchi is indicative of its importance in Buddhism. In Hinduism, it is the seat of Brahma, the Creator. It is held by Vishnu, the Preserver. It is the seat or pedestal of Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, and Saraswati, goddess of wisdom and learning. The lotus is glorified in the hands of Bodhisattva Padmapani in Ajanta, where it becomes an object of beauty (M. Rao 2011, 74–80).\n\nFigure 31\n\nThe worship of the tree and of tree spirits appears in several Jataka tales. The Buddha was born under a sala tree in Lumbini, sanctifying it. According to the Nidanakatha, Sujata, the daughter of a general, worshipped a tree to have a son and offered payasa as a bali (offering). When her desire was fulfilled, she went to perform the bali at the tree. There she found the Bodhisattva Siddhartha and, mistaking him for the tree spirit, offered him the bali. The Mahavagga refers to a god living on a kakudha tree (white marudh) while the muchalinda tree beneath which the Buddha sat after attaining enlightenment was conceived as a tree spirit from the abode of Shakra (Indra). Tree deities were called Nagas and were able, at will, to assume human form like the\n\nNagas. The Mahavanija Jataka recalls the spirit of a banyan tree, who reduced merchants to ashes. Many of the Buddhist Theragatha praised trees and forests. The first Buddhist vihara (monastery), gifted by King Bimbisara, was the veluvana, a forest of bamboo trees in Rajgir. At Kapilavastu, the nyagrodharama (resting place of banyan trees) was the residence of the Buddha. Vaishali was famous for the mango grove donated by Ambapalli, the famous courtesan brought up by the owner of the grove. The Buddhist university town of Nalanda, visited by the Buddha, was famous for Pavarika’s mango grove. Finally, the Buddha attained mahaparinirvana in the upavattana sala (grove of sala trees) of Kushinagara. According to the Buddha, he who abstains from injuring plants is the perfect man. Human beings and nature are equally dependent on each other and need to live in close harmony. In fact, the events of the Buddha’s life were associated with trees and groves, celebrating the beauty of the natural world. The pre-Buddhist sanctity accorded to the pipal was applied to the Buddha, who attained enlightenment beneath this sacred tree. In early Buddhist art, where the figure of the Master could not be depicted, the pipal became the symbol of the Buddha. However, the pipal tree at Bodh Gaya, on the banks of the Niranjana River, is worshipped as the preeminent Bodhi tree beneath which the Buddha attained enlightenment. However, in the later art of Amaravati, there is a paucity of nature and an excess of humans. Nature appears as a part of the narrative but is no longer the object of worship. Plants are highly stylized and lack the natural spontaneity of the earlier periods. The shala represents the birth of the Buddha, the pipal his enlightenment. Nature becomes a symbol, a link between the artist who tries to depict the beauty of nature and the devotee who seeks divinity. New stories appear that do not belong to earlier canons. The Amaravati stupa contains sculptures of the bodhi or pipal being worshipped. According to Fergusson (1971, 223), ‘Tree worship (at Amaravati) is almost similar to that of the Sanchi stupa. The tree worship in the central building is in the place of honour but gradually it became less important before the sculptures at Amaravati were completed’. Tamil Literature According to Tamil Sangam literature, trees were the embodiment of divinity; in them, gods dwelt and had to be worshipped (Agam, 270.12; 7; Puram, 191.1; 198). Different trees are associated with different gods in the various Sangam texts. There are numerous references to trees that were abodes of deities (Narrinai, 83). The banyan was believed to have some divine force in itself, because some god or the other would be pleased to take shelter in its shade. It is always mentioned as being godly or possessed by some god (Agam, 287; 270.12; Puram, 199; Narrinai, 343). Shiva is visualized as sitting under a banyan and expounding eternal truths to four disciples. Vishnu is also called aalamara kadavul (god of the banyan tree) (Puram, 198). The commentator of the Purananuru takes the epithet aalamara kadavul to apply to either Shiva or Vishnu, but this\n\nis very rare and generally Shiva is considered to be the god of the banyan and is called aalamar selvan (Kalithogai, 83; Sirupanarrupadai, 17). Shiva, seated under the banyan and facing south, is Dakshinamurti, and this name is mentioned in the epic Silappadikaaram (23.144). Dakshinamurti is invariably seen on the walls of the Shaiva temples of Tamil Nadu. Ancient Tamils worshipped trees since the gods were believed to dwell therein. The tree so worshipped subsequently became the sthala vriksha of the temple. According to Sangam literature, just as the banyan was associated with Shiva and Vishnu, trees like the neem, Bengal quince, and Indian laburnum were sacred to particular deities, whose statues were erected beneath the trees (Puram, 199; Agam, 287; Paripadal, 4–67). Later, when temples were erected for the gods who had originally existed in the shade of trees, people took special care not to remove those trees, which were then preserved and worshipped. The best example of this is the 300 BCE Shiva lingam made of polished granite, situated at Gudimallam near Kalahasti. Shiva emerges from the lingam as a full figure standing on a yaksha, an early form of Lingodbhava. What makes the figure interesting is the fact that the lingam is surrounded by a stone fence within which excavations have revealed Mauryan gold coins and other organic remains, suggesting that worship was once conducted within the small fenced area that would have stood out in the open, beneath a tree, before a temple was constructed in the Pallava period to house it (Figure 32). In the Jambukeshwara temple in Thiruvanaikka near Trichy, the Shiva lingam stands at the foot of the Indian black plum tree, enclosed by a wall, and constitutes the garbhagriha (sanctum).\n\nFigure 32\n\nAt Vaidishvaran kovil near Kumbakonam, the original lingam (Adi Vaidishvara) is still preserved beneath the neem tree, which has medicinal properties, suggesting that Shiva was the god of medicine (vaidyam) and doctors (vaidya) and proving that the original temple was a mere deity beneath a tree, before later dynasties supplanted it with a huge lingam housed in a covered structure.\n\nEvery famous temple in Tamil Nadu has a holy tree of its own and is associated with either a local or a Puranic legend. Sometimes places too are named after the sacred tree, such as the town of Kanchipuram, named for the kanchi (river portia) tree. Thiruverkadu (white bark acacia) and Thillai (blinding tree or mangrove) are other examples. Although the mangrove is no longer found in Thillai (Chidambaram), the plant is worshipped as a sculpted sthala vriksha within the Nataraja Temple (Figure 33) (Amirthalingam 2005, 66).\n\nFigure 33\n\nEvery tree has a legend of its own. For example, the mango tree at Ekamreshwara temple in Kanchi is said to yield mangoes of different varieties, tastes, and sizes; thus it is worshipped as a divine embodiment. Goddess Parvati worshipped the Shiva lingam beneath the mango tree (Figure 34).\n\nFigure 34\n\nFigure 35\n\nThe names of early dynasties of south India, such as the Pallavas (from the word pallava or leaf) and Kadambas (from the name of the wild cinchona or kadamba tree), suggest even a totemic role for the tree. In Tamil Nadu, people still worship pipal and neem trees either standing alone or with a stone altar beneath. Often, a snake stone or Ganesha is placed beneath the tree (Figure 35). It is believed that such a tree was sacred and considered a vriksha devata because it was a symbol of fertility and longevity. Later, when the deities occupied the primary position, the trees were of secondary importance. There are sculptures of sacred trees in the temples of medieval Tamil Nadu, such as the seaside oak at the Meenakshi temple, Madurai (Figure 36); the Alexandrian laurel of Kapalishwara temple, Mylapore, Chennai (Figure 37); and the jackfruit tree at Kutralam, Tirunelveli district (Figure 38). Scenes of tree worship and the sacred tree embellish the temples and sculptures of India. This ancient custom of the common people continues till today. It is nearly impossible to find a temple without a sacred tree motif.\n\nFigure 36\n\nFigure 37\n\nFigure 38\n\nThe Woman and the Tree Yakshas and Yakshis As early as the Indus–Saraswati civilization, there are indications of the worship of the ‘spirit of the tree’ (Figures 3 and 5). There are many scenes of a figure standing or sitting within a tree on the seals from this era. The tradition of the yaksha or yakshi—the spirit of the tree or his/her equivalent—obviously had very ancient roots. The Atharva Veda (X.7, 38) describes ‘a great yaksha in the midst of the universe reclining in concentration (tapas) on the back of the waters, therein are set whatever gods there be, like the branches of a tree about a trunk’. Later, in the Mahabharata, this imagery is changed to a lotus emerging from the navel of Vishnu, holding Brahma, the Creator. Each town had its own spirit protector living in his particular tree, the chaitya vriksha. Large towns like Rajagriha, Mathura, and Varanasi had more than one. The yaksha or yakshi arranged marriages, granted children, and protected the chaste. The Mahabharata (2.5.100) enumerates the sacred trees of various towns and tells us that every village had a sacred tree, each identified with a yaksha. The word ‘yaksha’ occurs several times in the Rig Veda, Atharva Veda, Upanishads, and Brahmanas. The word generally means ‘a magical being’, something both terrible and wonderful. Its frequent appearance in Sanskrit literature refutes the many attempts to brand yakshas as non-Aryan. The yakshas belonged to a stratum of lower deities who were propitiated more out of a desire to prevent them from doing anything malevolent. This is particularly apparent in the Rig Veda, which betrays a general dislike of the human sacrifices performed in connection with yaksha worship. However, several Vedic gods—including Varuna and Brahma—are also referred to as yakshas. The role and the position of the yaksha, therefore, is ambiguous, to say the least. The importance of the yaksha comes from the fact that the worship of the yaksha living in the tree was as important as the worship of the tree itself. Trees were the natural abodes of the spirits, many of whom were identified by or named for the tree. There is an entire Buddhist Jataka dedicated to the worship of trees, shrubs, bushes, and plants; it is called the Rukkha Dhamma (or Vriksha Dharma) Jataka. A very important feature of yakshas and yakshis, and one that was of real importance in the ancient world, was their association with fertility. The Mahabharata refers to goddesses born in trees, to be worshipped by those desiring children. Such fertility roles\n\nare numerous. Vishwamitra and Jamadagni are produced, according to the Mahabharata, by their respective mothers embracing two trees, while queen Vitasavati of Bana’s Kadambari (134) worships the pipal and other trees in her desire for a child. Yakshas bestowed wealth and progeny; they were supposed to bring about marriages, safeguard women’s chastity (Rajatarangini), grant children and grandchildren (Avasyaka Sutra), and protect the foetus (Mahavamsa). The Hatthipala Jataka refers to the poor woman who points to the banyan tree as the source of her seven sons. Even today, the sacred tree of a temple or village is circumambulated when progeny are desired (Coomaraswamy [1928] 1980, I.14–16; II.1–12). The yakshas are vegetation spirits with powers of life. On a Bharhut coping, a vriksha devata—or yaksha—offers a bowl (of food) and a kamandal or kettle from which water is poured into the hands of a man seated below. This is probably an illustration of the ‘Story of the Treasurer’ in the Dhamma pada Asthakatha (I, 204) (Figure 39). This illustration reappears on a railing pillar in Bodh Gaya. A man stands in front of a tree receiving a water vessel (kamandal) and a plate from two hands emerging from the tree, which has an altar beneath it (Figure 40). In a detail from the parinirvana from Mathura, a vriksha devata stands hidden in a tree (Figure 41) (Coomaraswamy [1928] 1980, plate 25).\n\nFigure 39\n\nIn Jainism, yakshis look after the well-being of the Tirthankaras. Each Tirthankara has an attendant yaksha and yakshi, with supernatural powers. Sometimes, they are the objects of worship too. The important Jaina yakshas and yakshis include Ambika (Amba, Amra), attendant of Neminatha, named for the mango tree; Chakreshwari, attendant of Adinatha (Rishabhanatha); Kushmandi, who holds a mango; Lakshmi, holding a lotus, representing wealth; Padmavati, holding a fruit, attendant of Parshvanath; and Saraswati, seated on a lotus.\n\nFigure 40\n\nFigure 41\n\nYakshas and yakshis were also protective guardians who flanked the gateway in Sanchi. In later art, they were identified as the river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna who flanked the temple doorways. Finally, they became the goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati, seated on the sacred white lotus, a divine symbol of purity. There are sculptures of yakshas in trees from Bodh Gaya and Amaravati. Yakshas and yakshis stand under the ashoka, champaka, and kadamba trees in Mathura art. Whereas Vedic and epic literature lists out sacred trees and strongly promotes their worship, the Bhagavad Gita says that only persons of rajas (energetic or passionate) quality worship yakshas while the Buddhist Maitrayini Samhita and Lalitavistara attack worshippers of yakshas. Jaina texts also attack yakshas and yaksha worship. However, several Sanskrit texts, including the Kathasaritsagara, affirm that all sections of society— Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Sudras, and tribals—worshipped the yakshas. The worship of the yaksha occasionally involved offerings of blood, flesh, and wine, as described in the Dummedha Jataka (50), among others. Even human sacrifices were made to yakshas, according to the Mahavamsa and the Mahasutasoma Jataka. The Mahavamsa describes the conversion of the cannibal Yakkha Ratakkhi to whom bali (offerings of flesh) were made. The word bali, even today, denotes offerings of flesh as in animal sacrifice (Coomaraswamy [1928] 1980, II.7).\n\nLater, the worship of the individual tree—devoid of the yaksha—becomes more vegetarian and sattvik, with offerings of fruits and flowers. It is notable that while the Buddhists sought to convert yaksha worship to a more pacific form and the Jainas rejected it outright, Brahmanic religion retained the sanctity of the tree and discarded the sacrifices to the bloodthirsty yaksha, whose worship was obviously a remnant of ancient animistic forms of worship. Ananda Coomaraswamy, in his work Yaksas, has opined: ‘[W]ith very rare exceptions it is a spirit in the tree, not the tree itself that wills and acts’. The Milindapannlia (IV.3, 20) tells us that ‘the aspen tree conversed with Bharadvaja. But that last is said … by a common form of speech. For though a tree, being unconscious, cannot talk, yet the word “tree” is used as a designation of the Yaksha who dwells therein …’ (Coomaraswamy [1928] 1980, II.1–12). The Shalabhanjikas of Bharhut and Sanchi The scenes on the reliefs of the Bharhut, Sanchi, and Amaravati stupas show trees associated with female figures—the yakshis, dryads, or spirits of the tree. The woman who touches the plant with her foot is known as vrikshaka (tree maiden) or shalabhanjika (a woman who breaks the shala [sal] tree). The woman holds a branch of any flowering tree —ashoka, amra, kadamba, or champaka. She is actually a vrikshaka. She becomes responsible for the flowering and fruition of the tree whose branch she holds. Although the shalabhanjikas of the Buddhist sculptures of Bharhut, Sanchi, and Mathura are better known, the concept is first mentioned in the Vanaparva of the Mahabharata, where she is frequently addressed as pushpa-shaakha-dhaara (one who holds a flowering branch), and later in Ashvaghosha’s Buddhacharita (1st century CE) and the Shrishti kanda (17.57) of the Shivamahapurana. The Jaina Rayapaseniyasutta describes her thus: ‘The shalabhanjika women carved on the vedika pillars were standing in various graceful poses, well supported, beautifully ornamented, wearing garments painted in various colours and necklaces of various designs, curly hair, standing under asoka trees and holding their distended boughs, stealing the hearts of the gods as it were with their rolling glances and teasing as it were with the play of their eyes’ (S.P. Gupta 1985, I.25– 36). The shalabhanjika is a yakshi, a minor female deity or spirit of nature who resided in the tree. The fertility so gained by the tree became, in time, an attribute and ability of the tree itself. The ashoka dohada is a favourite theme in which the woman is shown kicking the ashoka tree and making it bloom. Kalidasa describes this ritual in Malavikagnimitra and Raghuvamsha. The tree is popular in southern and eastern India and is still associated with vrikshikas, also called surasundaris.\n\nAn extension of this association with fertility is the motif of the woman and the tree, which abounds in Indian art—seen in railings, gateways, and pillars at Bharhut, Bodh Gaya, Sanchi, and Mathura. Often, one foot is twined around the stem; sometimes it is raised and rests against the trunk. The most commonly represented trees are mango and ashoka. The dryad motifs—first seen in the nativity of the Buddha in the Lumbini garden where the shala tree supports Mayadevi, and later in the poetic fancy of the ashoka tree, which blooms only when touched by the foot of a beautiful woman—are closely connected with the idea of fertility.\n\nFigure 42\n\nThe best-known and most spectacular yakshis are the shalabhanjikas of the Sanchi gateways—nude, opulent, sensuous figures holding the kadamba (Figure 42), ashoka, or mango (Figure 43) trees in full bloom, laden with fruits and a thick canopy, so obviously figures of fertility in an otherwise monastic and near-puritanical situation. It is easy to believe on seeing such a figure that the touch of her foot was essential to give the tree life, to enable it to produce lush, ripe fruit. The shalabhanjikas of Sanchi are artistically excellent. Voluptuous, shamelessly naked, and dressed in heavy peasant jewellery—thick anklets, bangles, earrings, and waistbands—these female statues hold branches of several trees. The most famous of the shalabhanjikas are the women of the mango tree who even serve as corner brackets as they hang from the branches of the trees, which are full of luscious, ripe fruit.\n\nFigure 43\n\nWas it the woman or the spirit who was associated with the tree? A sculpture from Sanchi suggests the latter. A yaksha—a man—stands holding ripe mangoes on one side, with kadamba leaves hanging over his other shoulder. Obviously it was the spirit of the tree that was immortalized in sculpture. In some parts of India, there is a periodic ritual wherein women embrace the tree and partake of its bark or flowers. The inscribed figures of yakshas and yakshis, nagarajas, and devatas found on the toranas (gateways) and Jatakas, and in scenes from the life of Buddha, constitute an extensive iconography of the tree and its associations. Vrikshakas of the Kushana Period During the Kushana period (1st to 3rd centuries CE), Mathura was renowned as an important centre of art and sculpture. The relationship between the tree and the woman dominates Mathura art and women are shown standing under different trees in different poses. At Mathura, a few trees are specifically associated with female figures. The most popular tree was the ashoka, which was supposed to flower only when its roots were touched by the feet of beautiful young girls. The other trees are the wild cinchona, Indian rose chestnut, and champaka, a small tree with exquisitely scented flowers. The vrikshakas were symbols of fertility, worshipped by barren women to bear children. The Gandhara artists, also of the Kushana period, also depicted the women and tree motif. The vrikshakas appear on the railings of Bhuteshwara, Kankali Tila, Jamalpur, and Govindnagar in Mathura district. An important discovery was made in Sanghol in Fatehgarh district of Punjab. Sanghol has been continuously occupied since before 2000 BCE. From a stupa mound at Sanghol were found 117 sculptures, including sixty-five pillars. The pillars are carved with female figures in various poses and scanty clothing, extremely evocative and charming. They are yakshis, commonly known as shalabhanjikas, but actually vrikshakas. These vrikshakas belong to the Kushana period, known for its charming depiction of the female figure. Sanghol represents the formative phase of sculptural art. The discovery of the 117 Kushana vrikshakas at Sanghol was a historic find of Kushana sculptures in such large numbers and of such artistic excellence outside the Mathura region. Delicately carved out of fine-grained, red-mottled sandstone from the Rupbas outcrops, the sculptures belonged to a low railing running around the stupa. The crossbars represent rosettes and lotiform designs, while the pillars represent female figures in the form of the woman-and-tree motif or the mother-and-child concept. In the former category, female figures stand on dwarfish or grotesque figures, holding the branch of a tree overhead. A few representations show females either engaged in personal decoration or carrying trays and vessels meant for toilette. The Kushana sculptors produced wonderful replicas of trees, which are long and delicate, with soft ripples on their surface. The tree was beautifully arched to juxtapose\n\nagainst the gracefully curved figure of the vrikshaka. The yakshis of Sanghol are exquisite tributes to the spirit of the tree. Many trees are associated with yakshas and yakshis in the Kushana art of Mathura found in Sanghol. These include the ashoka (Saraca indica) (Figure 44); kadamba (Anthocephalus cadamba) (Figure 45); and sal/shala (Shorea robusta) (Figure 46). They are strongly sensual, even Bacchanalian, in some scenes. In a contemporary sculpture from Madhya Pradesh (1st to 2nd century CE) a naked woman with heavy bangles, waist girdle, earrings, and heavy necklace stands in tribhanga (tri-bent pose), holding a branch of the champa or magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora Linn.) (Figure 47). The local plant was celebrated as the vrikshaka’s tree. The yakshi and the tree were important aspects of Kushana sculpture. These beautiful women in the full glory of their youth represented life itself In contrast, the ugly dwarf beneath the yakshi’s feet served to underscore her beauty; he was a bharavahaka or load carrier, representing the apasmara purusha or personification of ignorance of later iconography.\n\nFigure 44\n\nFigure 45\n\nFigure 46\n\nFigure 47\n\nIn a rare sculpture from Mathura, a yaksha—not yakshi—stands beneath the Ficus\n\nelastica (Indian rubber tree). The plant is not native to Mathura and the yaksha makes an unusual substitution for the yakshi. One can only presume that this was a part of the prevalent popularity of tree worship. It is likely that the idea of worshipping the bodhi tree, in response to the Buddha’s refusal to permit the worship of his image, was inspired by the worship of the yaksha or the spirit who resided in the tree. In the sculptures of Bharhut, Sanchi, Amaravati, and Mathura, elaborate, multistoreyed structures are built around the bodhi trees, which represent the Buddha himself and which his followers worship ardently. The bodhi tree is encircled by a pillared gallery in the Bharhut panels, suggesting a special temple for the tree. The birth of the Buddha is symbolized by a sal tree above Mayadevi. Later Periods The Ikshvaku kings ruled central India in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. The stupa at Nagarjunakonda, like that at Amaravati, contains a scene of the birth of the Buddha, where Mayadevi is standing under a blooming ashoka tree with a chauri-bearer and a sprouted jar. At Nagarjunakonda, a yakshi’s raised left leg touches the ashoka tree. In the panel, the Buddha is seated under a bodhi tree, with divine figures praying to him. In another panel, apsaras are under an ashoka tree from which hang leaves and bunches of flowers. In yet another sculpture, the ashoka tree is again depicted with a maiden standing on a lion and holding bunches of flowers (P.R.R. Rao 1956, 39–46). The association of trees and women continued in the medieval sculptures of Khajuraho and Odisha, on the walls of the Lakshmana temple at Khajuraho; in the Raja-Rani temple at Bhubaneswar; and also the Sun temple at Konark. The Tree and the Snake The association of trees with snakes is also as old as Indian civilization. It appears on Harappan seals: two snakes flanking a tree, a naga-like figure guarding the shami, and so on. Much later, in the Bharhut images of the Sunga period (2nd century BCE), the Nagas— men and women with cobra hoods—worship symbols of the Buddha placed beneath the bodhi tree (Figure 25). While they are believed to have been members of the Naga tribe, they could equally have been anthropomorphic representations of the snake itself, which lived in the tree and was revered. It is a common sight in rural India to see snake stones installed in front of trees, particularly the pipal, which is the most sacred tree of India. It is found in almost every village in the country and is believed to be the dwelling place of the Hindu Trinity: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva (Figure 48). The pipal tree has been described as the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Life, the Tree of Eternal Life, and the Tree of Creation. By spreading its branches, it brings blessings to\n\nhumankind. This tree is closely connected with fertility, which the serpent symbolizes. The tree is worshipped, particularly by women, for both fertility and longevity of their husbands. The pipal tree is sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists. Where there is a pipal, there will also be a neem—so goes a popular saying—with the two often intertwined. A platform is built around them and one or more images of the snake installed on the platform and worshipped. This is believed to bless the worshipper with prosperity. Sometimes a Ganesha or Hanuman may also be installed with the snake stones and the place becomes a sacred prayer stop for passers-by. Weddings are performed of the neem and the pipal to ensure good rainfall.\n\nFigure 48\n\nThe association between trees and snakes is found in several religions. In Greek mythology, Ladon the snake, often referred to as a dragon or a serpentine dragon, is coiled around the tree in the Garden of Hesperides, protecting the golden apples. In Norse mythology, the serpent Niohoggr eats from the roots of the Yggdrasil, the World Tree. In Mayan mythology, the Vision Serpent lies on the centre axis of the world, on top of the World Tree. The fertility rod of the Sumerian god Ningizzida is entwined by two serpents. Similarly, the Egyptian cobra goddess Wadjet is coiled around papyrus reeds. In the Biblical Genesis, Satan is a fallen angel, also represented as a serpent, who lives on the tree and tempts Eve with the forbidden fruit (Fergusson 1971, 5, 7–8, 12–17, 24, 37–38).\n\nSpecial Trees Kalpa Vriksha The kalpa vriksha (Figure 49) is the wish-fulfilling tree of life, first mentioned in the Rig Veda (I.75). It was one of the gems that came out of the ocean during the samudra manthan (churning of the ocean), and Indra, king of the heavens, took it away to paradise. It is a very special tree that can bear any kind of fruit, which is why it is associated with different trees in different places. It is a symbol of life and prosperity, a focal point for one’s spiritual quest. There is a legend about the kalpa vriksha that was originally found in Uttarakuru. According to the Bhishmaparva (7.2) of the Mahabharata, the Siddhas who lived in Uttarakuru worshipped the kalpa vriksha. Some branches produced streams of milk tasting like nectar and the flavour of all six rasas. Other branches produced clothes and ornaments, still others yielded men and women of great beauty and youth. It was a golden tree of life, with golden branches and fruit, and had to be worshipped properly.\n\nFigure 49\n\nA 200 BCE pillar from Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh) is carved like a banyan tree, and a conch, a lotus, a vase of coins, and a bag tied with a string are hung from it. This was obviously the kalpa vriksha of ancient legend. Whereas the bodhi tree symbolizes enlightenment, the Shri or kalpa vriksha, surrounded by a railing with gold coins hanging from the branches, symbolizes Shri-Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity (Srivastava 1983, 135). The kalpa vriksha is depicted with festoons, gold coins, and so on. It is tall with bushy leaves, decorated with jewellery, and even has arms, which give food and drink to a weary traveller. The tradition of kalpatarus is also found among the Jainas. It is called the chaitya vriksha (Dwivedi 2011, 39–46). Several trees are referred to as the kalpa vriksha. They include the banyan, parijata, pipal, and coconut tree (also called kalpataru in the coastal districts).\n\nA kalpa vriksha is not a deity. Rather, it serves the deity and is a means to reach the gods. It is a symbol of the tree, which gives life and prosperity, endurance, growth, and generosity. Unlike human beings who ask for and desire material objects, the kalpa vriksha, like all trees, gives food, shade, fruits, nuts, and timber besides cleaning and purifying the air. It is a bulwark against heavy winds and stormy rains, and is selfsufficient. It is an example for human beings: just as a tree is wise and humble and bows before a storm and survives, we too must submit to the Divine Will. If we do good for the tree—watering, pruning dead branches, and taking care of it—it will reciprocate our efforts by providing fruit and flowers and a safe haven for people, animals, birds, and insects. Travellers are encouraged to sleep beneath a kalpa vriksha, for it is an excellent source of oxygen, herbs, and good aroma, which ensure clean, pure, and healthy air. The kalpa vriksha focuses the mind towards a spiritual direction. It is a ‘giver’ who never disappoints, whether the demands are spiritual or materialistic. However, it never grants evil or negative desires, such as death or disgrace for another. The kalpa vriksha, also known as kalpataru, kalpadruma, and kalpapaada, is guarded by flying kinnaras/kinnaris (celestial musicians, half-human half-bird), apsaras, and gandharvas. It is a popular motif in art and has even been adopted as an Islamic art motif.\n\nFigure 50\n\nChaitya Vriksha (Figure 50) Contrary to popular belief, the word chaitya did not originally denote a Buddhist prayer hall. In Sanskrit literature, the term chaitya occurs frequently. It denotes a tree with dense foliage and fruits, which provides shelter for people, birds, and animals. The tree was the chaitya or protector (chaitya is the same as chhatra, which means umbrella) of the image. The yakshas were believed to live in the sacred trees, which provided an ideal observatory from where they could observe and participate in daily activities. The Ramayana (2.3.18; 50.8; 5.12.18; 22–29) refers to chaitya vrikshas, so called because the trees were planted with revetments around their stems. In the course of time,\n\nall reveted trees began to be called chaitya vrikshas. The Adiparva of the Mahabharata (1.138, 25) says that a tree with dense foliage and fruits was called a chaitya vriksha (protector tree), which was archaniya (worthy of worship) and supujitah (worshipped). The tree was a protector of gods and people. Almost all the villages had their own chaitya vriksha. Such holy trees could not be injured because they were the abodes of devas, yakshas, and rakshasas. The earliest temple was the tree: the deity was enshrined beneath. The structural temple came later, although it has been mentioned in early literature. In a scene from Bharhut, a five-hooded Naga is seated beneath a jackfruit tree, with small leaves and large fruits. The leaves of the jackfruit tree are also used as an antidote for snakebites. In the 5th century BCE Gupta temple at Deogarh, Nara and Narayana are depicted seated beneath the sacred badari tree. In the 7th century BCE Jaina temple at Aihole, the deity is standing beneath a Cassia fistula tree, flanked by a woman attendant on either side while two yakshas are seated on the tree. In every village, there was a yaksha shrine associated with the locally sacred tree called yaksha chaitya, and a tree shrine called chaitya vriksha. In Buddhist literature, it is referred to as bodhighara. Originally, the chaitya vriksha was a tree filling the space around it with its numerous branches. Such a tree of huge dimensions was accepted in the Vedas as a symbol of the cosmos (Krishna 1999). The Buddhist Aupapatika Sutra describes the famous shrine of the Yaksha Punnabhadda as a great ashoka tree, with a dais of bricks below it, shaped like a throne and situated in an enclosure of arches and doorways within a wood. The Dhamma pada Asthakatha refers to the building of an enclosure around a tree for its spirit by a rich householder of Sravasthi, who also promised to honour it on the birth of a child. The Kah-gyur narrates the tale of the Brahmana from Nyagrodhika who worshipped the deity in the banyan tree for the birth of a child, while the Malavikagnimitra describes a bhittibandho or bhittivedikabandha (the wall or fence) built around an ashoka tree. The Buddha, Mahavira, and later Buddhist and Jaina monks often halted at chaitya vrikshas in the course of their wanderings (Coomaraswamy [1928] 1980, 19–23). Each Buddha was associated with his own tree, called bodhi vriksha or chaitya vriksha, under which he attained enlightenment. There is an element of totemism in the identification of each tree with a Buddha. Similarly, each Jaina Tirthankara is associated with a tree or plant, as in the case of Hindu deities. Sthala Vriksha When, how, and why the chaitya vriksha (Figure 50) became the sthala vriksha (Figure 51) is a matter of conjecture but there are a few clues. As the characteristics of the yaksha protector were absorbed by the tree, it became the protector of the town, village, or sthala.\n\nHowever, while sthala vrikshas abound all over the country, the concept of the chaitya vriksha is totally lost. Sthala vrikshas are associated either with the temple or the deity. Thus Shiva is generally associated with the Bengal quince (bilva) and Devi with the wild cinchona (kadamba). However, there are often aberrations to the rule and Shiva is associated with the Alexandrian laurel and mango at Mylapore (Chennai) and Ekamreshwara (Kanchipuram), respectively.\n\nFigure 51\n\nThe sthala purana of each temple also has a legend linking the vriksha to the deity or the consort. Thus the Alexandrian laurel and mango trees were the scenes where Devi performed penance to regain the hand and heart of Shiva in Mylapore and Kanchipuram, respectively. The sthala vriksha in Hindu temples is similar to the chaitya vriksha and was probably derived from the latter. It may stand either on the ground or, more often, on a raised platform. It is generally situated in the outer prakara (enclosure) of the temple and stands apart from the daily ritual. The worship of the sthala vriksha is different, with offerings of coconuts, flowers, and lighted lamps. People tie strings to the tree to fulfil a vow or a wish, such as granting children. The sthala vriksha is circumambulated by the worshipper who prostrates before the tree and sometimes encircles it with a string, as if to wall it and to trap the spirit within. A legacy of the chaitya vriksha tradition is the worship of the pipal commonly found in Indian villages. It is similar to the chaitya vriksha in that it stands alone, generally mounted on a wide pedestal, with an altar for devotees’ offerings. Often, there are snake stones (carvings of snakes) or figures of deities (generally Ganesha) beneath it. The tree is regarded as sacred, possessed by a spirit, the vriksha devata, possibly once the yaksha residing in the tree. Seven pradakshinas (circumambulations) are done around the pipal tree every morning to the chant of vriksha rajaya namah, meaning ‘salutation to the king of trees’. If the new moon appears on a Monday, women circumambulate the tree 108 times and light little handmade lamps made of wheat dough. Being symbolic of fertility and protection, the tree is worshipped, particularly by women, who tie toy cradles on to the branches to pray for children. The Buddha received enlightenment while meditating beneath the pipal while Dakshinamurti, Shiva as the teacher, sits beneath the banyan, facing south, to enable his\n\nstudents to face north, the source of wisdom. They are obviously remnants of earlier traditions of locating the deity beneath the tree. While the sacred tree was called chaitya vriksha till the epic period, the term sthala vriksha appears in Puranic literature. The Matsya Purana and Padma Purana describe the sanctity of the trees associated with the sthala and how there were massive vriksha mahotsavas or tree planting festivals. It is interesting to observe the gradual disappearance of one term and appearance of the other, as forms of worship changed. The term sthala vriksha is also associated with the sacred sthal, sthan, or holy place—the centre of pilgrimage. According to the Skanda Purana, the devas worshipped the self-created (Swayambhu) lingams in the forest. The tree under which the lingam appeared was described as the sthala vriksha. This legend, among others, points to the fact that the trees protected the image to be worshipped prior to the construction of temples. Many places are named after the vriksha. For example, Thillai (Chidambaram) is derived from the thillai (mangrove). Although the name thillai still exists, the mangrove itself is no longer extant in Chidambaram, as the shore has moved six kilometres away towards Pichavaram, where the plant abounds. Because of the tradition, a small mangrove tree is now grown beside the eastern gateway of the Nataraja Temple at Chidambaram. Sacred basil (vrinda or tulsi) of Vrindavan, Indian plum (badari or ber) of Badrinath, bamboo (vet) of Tiruvetkalam, rice (nel) of Tirunelveli, jasmine (mullai) of Mullaivayil, and Indian gooseberry (nellikkai) of Thirunellikka are trees for which the towns have been named. The choice of the sthala vriksha had interesting local socio-economic–ecological implications. For example, the Alexandrian laurel tree, which is the sthala vriksha of the Kapalishwara temple in the ancient Pallava town of Mylapore in Chennai, was once used to construct ships in the Pallava period. The mangrove of the Nataraja Temple at Thillai (Chidambaram is essential to the local ecology, as it prevents coastal erosion. Why did the term chaitya vriksha transform into sthala vriksha? The answer probably lies in the changing form of worship. Earlier, the tree was the chaitya or protector of the image, as depicted so often in art. The emphasis in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism was on images housed either in a rock-cut cave or beneath a tree. From the Puranic period onwards, the emphasis was on the construction of impressive temples and temple complexes. The protector (chaitya) tree gave way to the tree of the sacred spot (sthala). Puranic literature is replete with the importance of pilgrimages to sacred sthalas. In the sthala vriksha linger all the various associations of the chaitya vriksha: its near totemic association with the god, its protection of the place, its ability to grant children, the spirit or yaksha, and so on. Many towns are named after their sacred trees; many\n\nancient dynasties, like the Kadambas and the Pallavas, were named after a species or parts of a tree. Thus the lingering embers of ancient totemism lived on. The worship of the spirit or yaksha is not forgotten. He continues to wander around the outskirts of towns and villages, a lost soul who mounts the terracotta animals offered to him, at the entrance of the village or in the sacred groves where people believe he still lives. Thus the sthala vriksha of contemporary Hinduism is a natural evolution from a simple spirit and tree worship to the veneration of economic, ecological, and social forces. Today, it is none of these, and yet it is all. It represents the sanctity imbued in an object with ancient associations, a reminder of the role played by nature. It is a remnant of ancient pantheism, when people recognized the role of plants and their importance. It is a memory of the ecological heritage of the Indian subcontinent, where divinity was recognized in all life forms, respected and revered. Trees in Popular Culture The popular beliefs of rural India are reflected in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jaina beliefs. Trees could grant sons and wealth, and tree spirits injured those who injured the tree. Thus trees were propitiated with offerings of flowers and garlands, with lamps lit beneath them and offerings placed at the base. Originally, this was made to the spirit of the tree, the yaksha who lived within. At times, the tree itself was identified with the god and worshipped. When the religion of the yakshas lost popularity, a figure of an animal deity—Ganesha, Hanuman, or the sacred cobra—was installed beneath the tree and worshipped. An ancient pipal tree at Joshimath in Uttarakhand is associated with Adi Shankara, who wrote the Kalpa Shakti Sthavam in praise of this divine tree. The Indian nedler at Siddha Bakul in the temple of Lord Jagannath at Puri has a very interesting origin. Shri Krishna Chaitanya planted a piece of Indian nedler wood, used in the worship of Lord Jagannath, in the garden of his disciple Haridas Thakur, who had been born a Muslim. This piece of wood grew into a large tree, and Haridas attained enlightenment beneath it. When Haridas died, Shri Krishna Chaitanya ordered that he should be worshipped as an acharya. A few years later some government officers wanted to cut the tree for its wood. Mysteriously, one night, the tree hollowed its trunk, making it unusable. The tree continues to live with a hollow and open trunk, and has become a sacred shrine. The tradition of sacred trees knows no religious boundaries. This custom was also transferred to the Sufi shrines. Many Sufi saints lived beneath trees and, when they died, were buried at the same spots, which became shrines or dargahs. Visitors would tie strings to the tree to make a wish. Where a mausoleum was built, the strings were tied to the window trellis, as in the Ajmer dargah. This Muslim tradition—also found in Pakistan and\n\nAfghanistan—is a continuation of the older Hindu tradition. Generally, the night queen (parijata) is the sacred plant of Sufi shrines. While the date palm is not regarded as sacred, Muslims break their fast during Ramzan by eating dates. The olive tree, which covered the Mount of Olives, is sacred to several Christian sects who use its oil for baptism and communion. In Punjab, several gurdwaras are associated with trees, such as the ber or Indian plum (Ziziphus mauritiana) beneath which Guru Nanak received enlightenment. Guru Nanak described the tree as a saviour of creation and said, ‘O God, you are an infinite tree and I am a bird under thine protection’ (Kaler 2012, 5–8). Many clan names came from plants. King Kaushika, who became the Brahman Vishwamitra, belonged to the Kaushika gotra; Kaushika is derived from the word kusha meaning grass. Many plants are used to prevent the bad effects of the evil eye. The Atharva Veda says that the reverted leaves of the prickly chaff flower ward off spells and cause them to recoil on the sorcerer. The Santhals use the root of the rock fern to ward off sicknesses caused by the evil eye. The nomadic tribes of Rajasthan tie the leaves of the devil’s backbone around the necks of children as an amulet to ward off the evil eye. The Saoras of Odisha make an amulet of the bark of the false white teak as a protection. A neckl"
