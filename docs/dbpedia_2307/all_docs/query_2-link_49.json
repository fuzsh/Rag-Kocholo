        "text": "The Hindu Thaipusam festival is the most important religious event of the year for Singapore’s Indian minority population. However, drumming in the Thaipusam procession has been illegal since 1973. For some Hindus, this creates a sense of imminent danger, as drumming is believed necessary to sustain the trance of devotees undergoing penance. Such tensions culminated in 2015, when plain clothes policemen forcibly halted Hindu drummers during the Thaipusam procession, and a brawl ensued. In this article, I describe the long history of controversy surrounding Hindu drumming in Singapore, which goes back to the nineteenth century. Surveying the influence of liberal notions of the relations between sacred sounds, public space, discourses on heritage and postcolonial governmentality, I argue that the ‘soundscapes of modernity’ are not always homogeneous but may be fragmented and pluralistic, involving contestations over the efficacy of sacred sounds and debates on where they should be located on the streets of today’s ethnically diverse global cities.\n\nFor centuries, the songs of devotional poet-saints have been an integral part of Indian religious life. Countless regional traditions of bhajans (devotional songs) have been able to maintain their existence by adapting to serve the contemporary social needs of their participants. This dissertation draws on fieldwork conducted over 2014-2015 with contemporary bhajan performers from many different genres and styles throughout India. It highlights a specific tradition in the Central Indian region of Malwa based on poetry by Kabir and other Sants (anti-establishment poet-saints) performed by lower-caste singers. This tradition was largely unheard-of half a century ago, but is now a major part of Malwa’s cultural life that has facilitated the creation of lower-caste spiritual networks and created a space for those networks to engage in discourse about social issues. Malwa’s bhajan singers have also become part of India’s popular religious and musical life as certain performers have attained celebrity status and been recognized at the national level as living bearers of the Sant tradition. This dissertation follows performers and songs from Malwa into new contexts and explores the processes by which performers and audiences in diverse styles and contexts use Sant bhajans to construct understandings of the self. It further addresses the role of Sant bhajans in the formation of new communities comprising members from previously disparate social groups. It interrogates why Sant bhajans might be relevant and appealing to Indians from so many backgrounds and how these bhajans and their performers are relevant to major cultural, religious, and social discourses in India today. It describes and analyzes the various processes by which Sant bhajans are creating new arenas for artistic, spiritual, and social dialogue, and allowing previously marginalized voices to contribute to the formation of Indian culture.\n\nA sacred landscape is associated with the presence of divinity, which is made accessible through religious symbols and rituals such as pilgrimage. This paper demonstrates that contemporary pilgrimage performances may not necessarily be able to invoke spiritual connections that were inherent in traditional pilgrimages. It charts out the transformations in Hindu pilgrimage to the sacred landscape of Braj in North India. Braj encompasses hundreds of sacred sites associated with the life of Krishna (a god in the Hindu pantheon). Pilgrims undertake a circuitous journey, the Braj-yatra, to experience a divine encounter with Krishna in the forests and lakes of the region. Traditionally, this kind of pilgrimage has been organised and led by few coveted religious gurus for their followers. However, the burgeoning tourism and concomitant changes in the cultural economy of pilgrimage has not only affected the cultural ecology but also the symbolism, ritualisation, and interpretation of the sac...\n\nThis paper examines the spatial and temporal contexts that contribute to the fostering of communitas in contemporary South Asian religious travel, with particular attention to the influence of ritual performances and the mediation of social actors engaged in the cultural economy of religious tourism. It is based on the case studies of two sites located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra – Tuljapur and Shirdi. While the first is a site where hereditary lineages of priests perform rituals that are integral to pilgrimage practice, the second is associated with Sai Baba, a 20th century guru, whose spiritual-magical charisma continues to attract millions of visitors and the pilgrimage activity is managed by a centrally administered trust. Hence, they represent a spectrum of pilgrimage sites; at one end are the sites that are managed through social and informal networks (Tuljapur) and at the other are those managed by a public organization (Shirdi). A diverse range of religious functionaries including gurus, priests, and temple managers assist visitors in performing pilgrimage rituals and facilitate arrangements for lodging and boarding in Tuljapur. In Shirdi, these functions are handled by a charitable public trust that administers the shrine, and guides and tour operators and hotels that mediate movement and experience of visitors. The paper highlights how the different spatial modes of engagement with pilgrimage rituals and the mediation by religious specialists through distinct socio-spatial relationships play a significant role in creating the situations for fostering of communitas.\n\nThe ritual art form popularly known as 'Theyyam' occurs annually in the northern regions of the South Indian state of Kerala. The ritual is orchestrated and demonstrated by Dalit communities, who were formerly treated as untouchables throughout the history of the subcontinent. The impact of caste dynamics on this form of religious expression is explored in this work through ethnomusicological analyses, wherein the musical elements of Theyyam are compared to forms of music practiced by upper-caste communities in the same region. This work aims to highlight how knowledge, in essence, is a product of social hierarchy and forms of expressions birthed from knowledge are subtle representations of social discrepancy."
