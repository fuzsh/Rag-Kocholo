        "text": "This book moves beyond the all too well known temples at Khajuraho, Tanjore and Konarak to look at temples in Kutch, Kashmir, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Kerala--each unique not just for its style, but also for the imperatives of patronage and diversity of public functions that their temples served. We examine rock-cut temples, extraordinary brick ones, circular yogini temples, wood or bamboo and complex multi-faceted towers. Bewildering though they may be in their architectural variety, this volume shifts our focus away from their variety, to look instead at who built temples and why? What were they used for? Given that many Hindus do not believe in image worship, what makes temples valid spaces for worship, and what legitimises their public role? What was the nature of the activities and communities they fostered and how temples also became the focus of urban centres. The approach is art historical, ethnographic and comparative. Temples, as this book shows, have adapted and changed over the centuries and served a variety of ritual functions. They have also been major centres of the arts: painting and sculpture, dance and drama. To celebrate 75 years of Marg, this bumper issue, brings together the writings of pioneering art historians who have deepened our understanding of this remarkable expression of Indian architecture. Excerpts frpom the introductions to its chapters by Naman Ahuja are available here.\n\nThiruvottiyur temple also famously known as Thyagarajar -­‐ Vadivudai Amman Temple is situated on the Northern part of Chennai, quite close to the sea shore (Bay of Bengal). The temple is a vast historical and archaeological trove and attracts not only devotees, but also scholars and researchers from all over the country. The Main deity of this temple is Aadhipureeswarar, is said to be suyambu (mud mound) in form, like a protective layer is covering him and he is not allowed to be touched by both mortals and immortals. His consort Vadivudai Amman alias Tripurasundari is a widely revered deity among the locals. This temple has accumulated its religious richness of over several centuries and enriched by the architectural styles of various dynasties. Numerous saints and Saivite devotees are closely associated with this temple, such as Gnanasambandar, Appar, Sundarar, Adi shankarar, Pattinathar and many more. The earliest evidence of this temple appears in the Tevaram hymns sung by Gnanasambandar and Appar during the Pallava period and also we find few epigraphical records commemorating the same. At present Pallava Structures are completely missing, only few lion pillars are found inside the temple premises. This temple has been under the patronage and extended chronologically over a vast period of time by the South Indian rulers. Recent discovery of the Parantaka Chola inscription proves the continuation from Pallava to Chola. The present temple is a complete contribution of Cholas, Vijayanagara and Nayaka rulers. We also find interesting ancient sculptures and architectural features which are still alive, inside the temple. Published : International Journal of Law and Social Sciences (March 2016)"
