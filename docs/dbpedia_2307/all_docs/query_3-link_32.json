(ol®srrrfl ^ilduhsit i^iLiJwrT«raTi_nrT ®ljrr§giJITfO (3<?FfTLpS9T Foreword This book, Vedantam Vs Saiva Siddhantam a comparative study and the development of the latter from the earliest times gives a bird's eye-view of Siddhanta from the historical point of view. It also highlights some of the distinctive philosophical concepts which are logically coherent and practically more viable than other systems of thought including that of Sankara. The Dravidians had a settled way of life. Hence, their culture and civilization were more advanced than the nomadic Aryans. This has been testified by the excavations at Mohenjodaro and Harappa (Indus Valley Civilization - 2500 B.C). Later excavations have shown that this culture was spread throughout the Indian sub-continent. Since the Tamils alone had an early classical civilization, religion and literature of their own, quite distinct from the vedic heritage of the Aryans, the author is justified in tracing the lineage of the Tamils from the Indus valley Civilization. The concept that the vedic Aryans were civilized, and the indigenous Dravidians were barbarous, is a myth perpetuated by partisan and prejudiced writers of history. The author holds, and rightly so, that the Tamils had their written religious scripture (agamas), when the Aryans were at the stage of oral tradition. Saivism the religion of the Tamils has had a chequered history, touching its lowest ebb during the Kalapiras and the early part of the pallava regimes, getting revived through the Bhakti movement of the three great samaya-acharyas front the latter part of the pallava regime and ascending to its highest golden peak during the chola Dynasty (9th to 13th Century A.D.) IV The canonisation of the Saiva Thirumurais took place from the 1 1th to 13 th Century and was complete when Periapuranam was included as the 12th canon. The Thirumurais formed the basis for the philosophical theology of Sivajananbodham, the first of the fourteen Meikanda Sastras. Though there are several commentaries on Sivajnanabodham, Sivajnanamunivar’s Sivajnanamapadiam is hailed as the best and held in high esteem by the Siddhantins, for it upholds the Siddhanta faith in the three categories of Pati, Pasu and Pasa by providing a solid philosophical foundation. From the 15th Century onwards the Saiva Maths and their Adhenams took upon the noble task of preserving, expounding and propagating the religion and philosophy of Siddhanta. However, in the course of its history, Saivism has absorbed several elements from the vedic religion, while retaining its distinct identity. The author, for example, points out the fact that image worship and temple culture are exclusively Dravidian. The author, Thiru R. Namasivayam deserves all appreciation for having taken enormous pains to present the history of saiva Siddhanta in a nut - shell and Schieving the purpose the establishing the independent origin and development of saivism. I am sure, this book will find favour with the students and scholars of Siddhanta. Dr. P. Krishnan, Professor and Head Department of Saiva Siddhanta, University of Madras Chennai 600 005. INTRODUCTION Hinduism is a group of religions with their respective philosophical systems. The most important philosophhical systems of Hinduism are Vedantam and Saiva Siddhantam. The best known proponents in recent times of Vedantam were Swami Vivekananda and Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan; their speeches and writings helped Vedantam to gain credence in the West. The chief characteristics of Saiva Siddhantam is its scientific and logical, basis. It is pre-eminently scientific and the most modem scientific findings of, the West are concordant with it. Edwin Hubblle from California, U.S.A an athlete and ex boxer, had given up a promising career in Law in order to study Heavens showed that the universe had not existed for ever as most astronomers Note : Vide After Glow of Creation \" by Marcus Chown graduated at the University of London in 1980 with a first class degree in physics and subsequently a Master of Science in Astro Physics. End of the most dazzling achievements.of human thought has been the law \"Big Bang\" the hypothetical beginning of the Universe in which the whole of space and time was created in an infinitesimally small point which has expanded outwards for the past 10-20 billion years into the universe we know today - John Gribbin & Simon Goodwin The developemnt of an understanding of how the universe evolved from a super-hot, superdense state - the Big Bang - into the state we see today \" vide ORIGINS - \"Our place in Hubble's universe\" By John Gribbon & Simon Goodman Constable - Londin 1997 Origins - Our Place In Hubble's Universe Constable - London 19997 The causative factor of the \"infinitesimally point.\" is enigmatic Mayai postulated in the Saiva Siddhanta Philosophy 2 believed, but it had a beginning. Further he had found that sometime in the remote past a violent explosion took place. It was described as the \"Big Bang\". It was an explosion unlike any other. No void existed before this \"Big Bang\". There was literally nothing. The \"Big Bang” created everything and that included empty \"space\" (Akayam) matter and even \"time\" (kalam). The Agamic meaning of the word \"MAYAI\" is that which involves and evolves, that of \"LINGAM\" the Saiva Symbol of God and the lovely bronze image of Lord Nadarajah are that which Symbolizes involution and evolution among others. Mayai is real according to Saiva Siddhantam and from it the Universe evolves. Sivaperuman to redeem the Athmas (souls) from suffering and pain and too enable them to attain the eternal and boundless Bliss at His lotus like feet gives them the three forms of bodies from Mayai. The \"said bodies\" give circumscribed joy, knowledge and power of action to the Athmas. This is explained thus by Umapathy Sivachariar, the last of the Santana Achariar of Saivam. . . \"6$£$i6ij/rir>«nr6i/ib eSen&db'&n&Huu iDtrsnm aji^euiT^dbear ipgj&ieiijbgij. \" \"Carl Sagan' a Scientist of international repute in his book \"Cosmos\" 1995. (pages 284-286) made the following observation relating to Saiva Sidddhantam Concept of Creation and Destruction infinite in number and the great Oneness and all things evolving from the Oneness . (Ekan) \"The Chola Bronzes cast in the eleventh century A.D. includes several different incarnations of the God Siva. The most elegant and sublime of these is a beginning of each cosmic cycle, motif known as the \"cosmic dance of Siva\" The God called in the manifestation NADARAJAH the dance king, has four hands. In the upper right hand is a drum which sound is the sound of creation, in the upper left hand is a tongue of flame, reminder that the universe now newly created will billion of years from now be utterly destroyed.\" These profound and lovely images are 'I like to imagine' a kind of premonition of modem astronomical ideas.” 3 Dr. Fretijofcapra a research scientist of international repute in high energy physics, in his preface to the second edition of his book, the international best seller, \"Tao of physics\" (1983) states\". Five years ago, I had a beautiful experience which set me on a road that has led to the writing of this book. I was sitting by the ocean one late summer afternoon, watching the waves falling in and feeling the rhythm of my breathing, when I suddenly became aware of my whole environment as being engaged in a gigantic \"cosmic dance\". \"Being a physicist I knew that the sands, rocks, water and air around me were made of vibrating molecules and atoms and that these consisted of particles which interacted with one another by creating, destroying other particles. I knew also that the earth's atmosphere was continually bombarded by showers of cosmic rays, particles of high energy undergoing multiple collisions as they penetrated the air. All this was familiar to me from my research in high energy physics, but until that moment I had only, experienced it through graphs, diagrams and mathematical theories. As I sat on that beach my former experience came to life; I saw cascades of energy coming down from outer space, in which particles were created and destroyed in rhythmic pulses; I saw the atoms of the elements and those of my body participating in the cosmic dance of energy; I felt its rhythm and I heard its sound and at that moment I knew that this was the Dance of Siva, the Lord of Dancers worshipped by the Hindus\". The image of Lord Nadaraj - it should be remembered is a Saiva Siddhanta concept. Thus Saiva Siddhantam and Saiva Religion of late have gained wide credence amongst western scientists and intellectuals. \"Mayai\" which is real is not discernible and is beyond the concept of modem science. The ultimate indivisible component or particles of energy is evolved from \"Mayai\" which in turn becomes an atom, molecules and finally as matter. Similarly when the universe is destroyed it finally involves as Mayai. Prof., Einstein's famous equation - E = Me 2 represents this energy. The well known postulate of Saiva Siddhantam is something cannot come of nothing or become nothing. This is a acknowledge scientific principle known in Saiva Siddhantam as \"Satkariavatham\". 4 . Secondly Saiva Siddhanta philosophy and its principles are based on logical rules to give it a characteristic quality as a rational philosophical system. The \"Supakkam\" (part) of Sivagnana Siddhiar of Arulnandi Sivam following the Sivagnana Bhodam of his guru Meikandar, in the first three sutras out of the twelve as a prelude entitled\" Pramana iyal (rilj/ruxaw ^ujsv) laid down the logical rules that could be adopted to establish the realities of God, Soul, Anavam (ego) karma and Mayai and the attainment of Sivagnanam and moksha. This is a unique feature of Meikanda shastras. Sivagnana Siddhiar states : <3K!$6ifl6orir6v *£g,&LDgj(S0 <g{pSkij6V!rib - <3i6jT6)$6orir§yifii Q&Qbfmevmg, - tfieusm&si <g,(T6sr<y Q&iiijglujrrjb dfljbem&iLimGm iD(i^Qffrr6vir a>6oor@ 6vtrg)6vinb i5lp6§iDirujr @( s,Qsn6viTi£l (&,tb ^uo/rSj/r® g&qjjdb&soirGiD. \" <^6u@,fr - payiram (6) It is possible by the grace of God, to know him by the teachings contained in the Agamas, and also by proper argumentation and to perceive Him in our heart by Gnana Sadhana, our doubt having vanished and to get the darkness of Maya removed, and to dwell in the company of the Holy\" = Translation by J. M. Nallaswamy pillai. Finally Saiva Siddhantam is also based on epistemology (Theory of knowledge) - Arivuu Alavai Iyal. In the history of the Indian philosophical systems, when they were established positively, both logic and episte-mology became indispensable. (Vide \" <3its}uusM_<sb6h - «i. . ^ (2&6)i(2<!r$m$u$). The epistemology of the Vedanta is the Four Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, Smiritis Bhasyam of Adi Sankarar and the sutras of Badarayana. Note : The word \"Pramana\" is a Sanskrit derivative word. In Tamil it is known as \"Alavi Iyal.\" Sanskarar was the great expounder of Vedanta philosophy, but he was not the founder of the system. Gaudapada, who was Samkara's treacher’s teacher, was the first systematic expounder of Advaitam. 5 The epistemology of the Saive Siddhanta is the Four Vedas, Twenty, eight Saiva agamas. Eighteen puranas, Panniru thirumurai and the fourteen Meikanda shastras. Saiva Siddhantam has always a Catholic out look. It is not constricted by any blinkers. Saiva Siddhantam postulates that one need not accept anything as authentic however ancient it may be or reject anything new because it is of recent origin. \"Q&ir6ArsniDuj6mQ[D§t)i GIidsdguili jseortDirdbir siSIskp jB«r«Di0uSsjm7f jB 60 ffjQs,rr studsxSI Qurr j 2 ?a/to$ 2 )Sjr <B6TT/QcS jB6S)6i]Lurr a,tr Q^oto/sbtswd f5Ui/5s$©6W6w@6u/rr6 06W6a)tDu5lmirir uipsntDLUfp GbfTtymiiijbgtf js/fluu/r jB6vib Quir([^6jfl6ar <®L6ii(nf 6ii/r/jmu/i> g)f&£b aSsk GDtDuSImirir usvif Li&tf) GeojB&euGrr <&6 u®jb <$6UL1L% <3bfT {Fib - *3l60)6mUI_ &>t3blb whatever is old cannot be deemed to be good on account of antiquity alone and whatever book come today cannot be judged not good of its newness. Those who have no capacity to judge the faults and excellencies will praise it if others denigrate it and will condemn it on hearing others speak ill of it because they have no opinion of own\". Saiva Siddhantam does not condemn other religions or philosophical systems as false. God has provided each with the religion or philosophy best suited to him according to his or her state of enlightenment or capacity (Pakkuvam). Even Nihilism is acceptable to God. Sami Siddhantam defines a true religion as one which comprises within itself the best of all religions in proper perspective without denouncement. This is what Sivagnana Siddhiar States : §>S2*l<yiD IUfhl<S>sh QufT(IT)6tl £L_6B3T(/J)l£> [FJ T6 ivKCTT 6j?«jn_ GjditQi_it 601 QjDir6iJ6urru)6v s_6nu6i/ib ^6iipgu6n ujrr&l&iD luibQurr © 6 Tr^r 6 b lurr^ffia Q<5b6ir6ofl6or 6 j£l$lu$6Bnr6b @j6B)6iiQuj6V6vrnb $>tflug>(Sg,(3bT60ijr rffsajD^lLUir Q0rrQF,&iDujib ^gj/tyicujib Quirqf/shpirm ^p&S&smm ^6tD6iiQtu6vevirib ^©to«wD(Mr<»t£> 06 c» rSH-ra<aSu5l(QStD ^tSDSu^jsarQib ^r^miyaE, aSipurAngjib. \" \"Religions postulates and text books are various and conflict one with the other. It is asked which is the true religion, which is the true postulation and which is the true book, the answer is as follows : That is the true religion, postulate and book which does not conflict with this or that and comprises everything just within its folds. Since they are found as knowledge in the Vedas and Siva Agamas revealed by all knowing Lord Siva. Vedas and Siva Agamas repose at the Sacred feet of Lord Siva\". Sivagnana Siddhiar supakkam states that for the six categories of religions the goal is Lord Siva-(Stanza I payiram Man ga-LaValthu). Stanza 115 of Siddhiar States whatever deity you propitiate. Lord Siva only appears as that deity and answers your prayers. Saint Navukkarasar in his, \"Thiruperu Velur Patthikam sings thus : \"aSiflaSevrr Qp6§6arir<sb6ir (SeuQpira^ tfUMiig, Q&iiig,i 6rtfl6§mirjB Qdfaai eain CSi/ajiib enbiSItr/rjb (S&pjD&rrt&jib. \" \"A bigot out of anger or spite founds a New Religion, it is acceptable to Lord Siva\". The Veera Saivam, Kashmir Saivam. Vallalar's New cult of Samarasa Sanmargam, Hawai Saivam, U. S. A. of Satguru Sivaya Subramainiya Swamy and the Meiekander Atheenam of U. K. have by passed one or more of the aforementioned epistemological basis of saiva Siddhantam: hence they are considered as heterodox systems even though they have some common features and similarities with saiva Siddhantam. Hawai Saivam is actually an admixture of Monism and the remnant of western \"CHRISTIANITY\" * Note I : The division of the Thirumurai into Cantos was done by saint Nambiandar Nambigal or Thirunaraiyur at the behest of the great king Rajarajah is the Thirumurai kanda Cholas who retrieved Moovar Thevaram from an ant hill with divine assistance and his son Rajendran I. 7 \"Thirumanthiram\" is considered as a Thirumurai and is assigned as the tenth canto.* It has devotional Hymns but not exclusively. Thirumanthiram, deals with Saiva Siddhantam, Vedantam, Mayavatham, Vaishnavam etc. all in a general way.. It also deals with subjects that are not relevant to Saiva Siddhantam such as yogas of different sorts, Chakkarams, yantrams, transmigration of souls etc.. A general code of conduct which are strictly not relevant to saiva Siddhantam is embodied in the Thirumanthiram. Research scholars have recently discovered interpolations and inclusion of whole verses in the Thirumanthiram. On the other hand the Meikanda shastrams deals exclusively on Saiva Siddhantam, they are systematic elaborate and exhaustive and have been, since the time of Meikandar accepted as the standard books on Saiva Siddhantam and as such accredited by the Saiva world. Meikandar and his Spiritual Lineage were as divine as Thirumular. His birth too was pre-ordained similar to that of Thiruganana sampanthar. They were all knowing with absolute knowledge. Meikandar .whs bom to reiterate 'Saiva Nannery'* at a Critical period. The following Thevara Hymn of Thirugnanasambandar refers to his preordained birth. Lord Siva sent him back to the earth to save \"Saiva Neri from the throes of Godless Jainism\" and its monks who were bigots. The Thevara Trio led by Thirugnanasambander re-established Saivaneri. * Note 1 : Nannery is Religion Note 2': erai su(pKi(^w,!y 0 Tr<fisuttSi!,ibwii> LirdBLir au ^isaremirirweiaso srib. 9- d. £§/Bj£)uju uamj/nl® r&^snsxw 84 ®suir S«$i 0 ji 7 w«n 6 u jS6)©6iw«jru8i4i/r - 600 041 (tpg>rbu$uq 1997 Note 3 : Thirumular was beatified as one of 63 Nayanmars (saints). Sundaramoorthi Nayanar refers to him as \"Tambiran Thirumoolar:\". Nambiandar Nambigal in Thiruthoondar Thiruanthathi and Sekkilar in his epic Periapuranam a biography of the 63 Saints have extolled the greatness of Thirumoolar. Thirumular was more than a siththar. He was a Jeevanmuththar. 8 \"geD<BL@u3/r Q^fTsvuuruLi &qT>&$kumu tSqtjjBib (g/D<®@lC/r J^lsVfT0 6T68fG»6Hl 6S)IDLUSV Q&lLlt$lblD6BBr6Bljil6&r(2lD6b t5ljD&(g)iD[r gH dbiriLty&mnu i36s£uuQib & / tbLjefiil. iQjn<£>(g>ir>tT£)i <5binLt263UTiij&, dS^A^dlesrjii Q^eoTSDsaSm. ” Second-Thirumurai of thiruthuruthi \"O Lord of thiruthuruthi. Your sacred feet are Ceaseless from My Thoughts You inveigled me and directed me To be bom again on this earth To face disease and death Thus I am distressed.\" There is absolute harmony in the postulations of Thirumanthiram and Meikanda Shastras. In the circumstance it is blasphemy to say there is a long standing dispute and there are two schools of Saiva Siddhantam-Meikandar School and Thirumoolar school - and there is confusion among the adherents of Saiva Siddhantam. This alleged dispute and confusion are a figment existing in the imagination of some misguided persons who are promoting them. In the post Meikandar Santana period there were several eminent scholars of Saiva Siddhantam who were commentators of the Meikanda Shastras and other related works on Saiva Siddhantam. They took congnizance of all other philosophical systems prevailing then and commented on them on a comparative bases. In the 15th century A. D. there were great scholars Pandiperumal, Maraignana Sambanda Desikar, Niramba Alagia Desikar, Gnanaprakasar, Velliambalavana Munivar, Sivkkiira-yogikal and Madurai Sivaprakasar. Sri La Sri Sivagnana Munivar and Sri La Sri Arumuga Navalar of Nallur Jaffna were two colossuses who strode the Saiva world in the 18 & 19 centuries A.D. respectively. They were all saintly persons of undisputable integrity. It is surprising that none of them were aware of this divergence of views and the disputes. 9 Later in the present century lived Scholars N. Kathiravetpillai. Maraimalali Adigal and Thiru V. Kalyanasundaranar who too were not aware of this alleged dispute, it is a canard. Recently in 1988 Dharmapura Aadheenam of Tamilnadu has published a commemoration book \"Aruvahai Samayam - Saiva Siddhantam oppeedu (^£H6ij6tD&& &idiuu> - sn&sij JljSssrrjB&ib 6?ud(S) is a comparative study of all religions including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Even this book has not mentioned anything about this dispute of the two schools of saiva Siddhantam referred to as above. *Yoga Swamigal of Jaffna was not a monist. He sings thus : \"^t,6iriDir <s/g9(UfrQ0«ira2/ Q&rrmmQtDrrifl JBIT6ST IDJDJ50I (SutrCoGiiGmirtg. - £&6ifl(Euj jB6UQjnpr«jr gjtQ&QiDiy. \" \"The Soul is indesructible and eternal. Then I was told of, this truth Thou Parrot! Do you think I would forget it? Nalluran is my refuge\". It could be said with certainty that none of the Saiva's in Tamilnadu and Tamil Eelam are confused. These two countries are the bastions of Saivam and Saiva Siddhantam. Similarly the Neocult of Shri Sathya Sai Baba of Prashanthi Nilayam Puttarpathi Andra Pradesh South India claims that Shri Sathya Sai baba is the incarnation (avathar) of God and his identity as such are the miracles performed by him. This cult of late has gained credence amongst English educated expartnate Tamils of both sexes from Sri Lanka, now living in foreign countries and gainfully employed. They come from the traditional * Note : The Mystic the late Yogar Swamigal of Jaffna was said to be the spiritual guru of Sivaya Subramania Swamigal of Hawai U. S. A. \"Nalluran\" was Chellappa Swamigal the spitual Guru of Yogar Swamigal. Chellappa SWamigal of Kadait SWamigal santhanam lived by the Thermuddy - (80 it ( tpi.19) a high dais with a flight of steps used for mounting the Deity of the nallur Kanda Swamy Temple on to the Chariot. 10 Saiva Hindu families otherwise ignorant of Saiva religion and its philosophical system - Saiva Siddhantam which are their rich heritage, however wearing Vibuthy regularly. Siva Peruman does not incarnate like mortals to face death and disease and the process of aging, it would limit His Absolutism and constrain His ommipotency, however with His ommipotency he could at any time, anywhere take instantly any human form or any other form. Miracles are marvels. They have a definite place and purpose in the Saiva religion. They occur as willed (sangarpam) by Sivaperuman and are caused by His Thiruvarud sakthi (Grace) for the benefit of His devotees and humanity in general. They are absolute. The miracles associated with the Saivasaints Gnanasambander, Navukkarasar, Sundarar and Manicanvasagar and the rest of sixty three saints were marvels of great magnitude and consequence in the long history of the saiva religion, they were unimpeachable and not petty. Some of them have been enumerated here in their Glory. For about three centuries beginning from the latter part of the 3rd century A.D. most part of the Saiva country, present Tamilnadu was under the rule of Kalapirars a tribal clan from the bordering Karnataka. They were fanatical Jains as much as their monks who guided them, ruled with an iron fist. All Saiva religions and cultural activities were banned, any violation was punished severly. This interregnum periot was known as the \"Dark Period\" in the history of Tamilnadu. Finally when the Kalapirar were routed in battle by the Pandyan Pallavakings, they withdrew from Tamilnadu leaving behind their Jain Monks most of whom were bigots without any scruples. The Jain monks had converted both the Pandya Pallava kings to Jainism. The Jain Monks with the respective kings secured on their side let lose a reign of terror on the adherents of Saiva religion. The distressed Queen Mangayatkkarasiyar and the chief Minister Kulasiraiyar who remained as ardent saivaites & devotees of Somassundara Peruman of the Maddurai Temple invited Gnanasambandar who was very young to Madura to save Saiva Religion and the people from the atrocities of the Jains. The saint visited Madura. The Jain Monks did their best to prevent the mission 11 of Gananasambandar. They tried to set fire to the MUTT where Gananasambandar stayed and they attempted to poison him. None by the Grace of Somasundara Peruman was successful. The pandyan king fell seriously ill and Jain monks who were well versed in Medical and Tantric skills treated him, the illness became worse. Gnanasambandar visited the king applied Viputhi A and invoked the grace of Somasundara Peruman. Lo the Pandyan king recovered from his illness. The King was reconverted in to Saivism. Gnanasambandar's invocation another miracle took place on the banks of river Vaikai at Madura for want of space it is not being elaborated here. The irate Pandyn King executed the criminous Jain Monks on the spike. The Saiva religion was, re-established in its glory in the Pandyan King dom. Gnanasambandar's wedding at Achalpuram Temple was another marvel. Immediately following the wedding he led his bride and the retinue who were witness to it into a Column of Jothi which appeared before them. All of them, attained the sacred feet of Sivaperuman. Navukkarasar was an emdite Jain Monk. His elder sister Thilkavathiar by her incessant prayers to the Lord of Thiruvathigai temple got him reconverted to Saiva religion, It was a miraculous event. The infuriated criminous Jain Monks instigated the Pallava king who too was a Jain to commit various forms of torture fatal in Nature that could cause death. Navukkarasar was secured to a rock and was thrown into the sea. The rock miraculously floated and brought the saint back alive unscathed to the safety of the shore. Again Navukkarasar was entombed into a burning lime kiln. In this too he survived without in any way affected by the fire & heat. Finally an elephant in musk was spurred to trample the saint, the elephant refused to act. 12 Navukkarasar's invocaton to Sivaperuman brought back to live the dead son of his disciple Apputhy Adigal. The Saint was invited for a meal at latters residence and the lad who had gone to the back garden to fetch plantain leaf was bitten by a venomous snake and was dead. Several miracles were ascribed to Saffit Sundara the last of Thevara Trio. His invocation to the Lord of Avinase temple brought back to live a boy who was swallowed by a crocodile. When the time came for Sundarar to attain the feet of Sivaperuman, a white elephant descended from Mt. Kailas to bear him to the abode of Sivaperuman. Sivaperuman (Somasundarar of Madurai temple) turned a pack of jackals into thorough bred Arab steeds to save his devotee Manicavasagar from punishment from the Pandyan King. Manicavasagar was given gold to buy Arab steeds for the King's cavalry. Instead of buying the horses at Thiruperumthurai he squandered the gold in the service of Sivaperuman. The Lord as an Arab riding a horse rode past the king, to deliver them. The miracle took place in the 3rd century. Raja Raj an Cholan I the Great Chola Emperor was a saivite and a great devotee of Lord Natarajah of Chidambaram. His devotion earned him the epithet Sivapadasekaran. He built the Great Temple of Tanjore. His discovery of the full text of Thevara Hymns was a marvel and miracle of great consequence. The above mentioned miracles were marvels. They were materialized from Sutha Mayai consistent with the doctrine of Saivasiddhantam. One of the basic principles of saiva Siddhantam is satkaria vadam which is both rational and scientific. Mayai is a reality It is the material cause of the entire universe including our body. As stated earlier something cannot come of nothing or become nothing. All persons brought to live by the aforementioned miracles lived a full and normal life. On the other hand the alleged miracles of Satya Sai Baba and similar spiritual men are petite producing mini Sivalingam, Viputhi valuable jewellery items and wrist watches according to the social status and 13 rank of his devotes. They are said to be just produced from nothing by the wave of his hand they come from nowhere. It is most unscientific and irrational and in reality not possible. These prompted the rationalists to allege that the said miracles of Shri Satya Sai Baba savours of jugglery. Besides Shri Satya Sai Baba there are others who are performing similar feats. To be precise the same ones. Swami Premananda of Matale Sri Lanka at present lanquishing in a jail in India on charges of murder and rape is one of them. He is running an ashram close to Trrichinopoly. Further there are few others who are doing this without any pretence of spiritualism.* Similarly lay preachers from the west of the Jehova cult of Christianity following their prayer meetings claim to cure incurable persons bom dumb to speak and bom deaf to hear and cripple to walk. Shri Satya Sai Baba’s cult has no epistemological basis similar to Saiva Siddhantam or Vedantam, which is essential for a religious system. It is relevant to quote the following lines from the Sivapuranam Thiruvasagam of saint Manikavasagar. \"r^Adblb <£f6TT6]SjD<$ U%6VSVrrdj <S/S»63rsSgj/6D(gj£b ^&(g,6ii[Tih abrruumh ^ijgluumu «s/©6ir j£©sufnii (Suir&(g,6imu erssisnssru L/(g>a9uu/nii $6orGl&rr(tpu>i5l6dr jE>!Ttnji)g,$Gsr S/B/flaj/ruu. \" * Note : Vide Virakesari Illustrated weekly of 1.2.1998 page 3 Shri Premamanda of India a member of the research Organisation of Nationalists. He claims 1500 feats of jugglery and challenged all others who are indulging in similar feats. Premananda is from India he is a rationaliist and a layman without any spiritual pretensions. He is the organiser of a rational society and a research organisation engaged in the studies of happings which are outside the reclaim of nature. Premamanda claims that he could perform about 1500 feats with the help of magic and dexterity, more than what the spiritual persons could do. He has issued a challenge to them.

Saint Manikavasagar highlights this in the following lines of the Thiruvasagam Hymn. \"6iirr/£$i 6ugj iib 6mssr6i]!T&siT &trib6iiiTip6mm i D&snb r$6irurr6b s2>fTg>gjsugi/ib js/rib B-luitjb&I gubsniD Qmsbevrrjh GljSfrg) (S6U6adrigdF \" (*9ta5)<Slt22/sSj£6b 16 £$(ff)61]IT dFdbtb) Saint Thayumanunivar, a Saiva saint who lived in or about the 17 century AD at Thiruchirapally in the present Tamilnadu referring to the aforementioned siddhis (<$&&!) sings thus in his \"Thejo Mayananthe Hymn No. 8 ((S&C&ggrr LDLurrmjBgj urrusv) : \"dB J5&I& LDg)(5brfl&r)lL] 5U&IDIT ]5L.gjg)6Vrrib <35JI$Q6inb LI&$6)]ITGniLHLIlb <BLL6l)/rib 6j>(JT)i^lrhldbiD (Lp&<5$6&r (olDSV G)dbfT6TT6rT6VHLb iSbiLGl&aSI 6T(gsS®/ ^j,LL6u/nb Q6njb0ips6l6ir ®/rsSib6a)6iijs^/ gyBjg/S6OT<»£«r>jSU7ib (B aSI/bid esaareaarsvrrib Qsugs 6fQT)6wf dbrrsarmDso e_6u<£j£gj/ fL-soirsiKorrib 6§GJ0l6B0I6U6inj 6761/60 £)<S/r6T7 67760/717) * Note : The Disc in the hand of Lord Vishnu is an all powerful deadly weapon of destruction.

Stillness in Meditation is a very rare possibility, Oh Lord you dwell in me as absolute knowledge and bliss. A devottee who practices Yoga should be cautious. In the course of his spiritual exercise he might acquire some siddhis. How ever he should not indulge in exhibiting or exulting over them, this would digress him from his path to salvation and could make him to assume that he is Brahaman and cause a virtual set back in his spiritual progress. He would slip down from Grace into the slough of samsara, consequently he would also lose the siddhis. Finally Viputhy is considered to be the holiest symbol of the Saiva Hindus off all sects, all the four Saiva Nayamars have sung its Glory in unequal terms, they had visions of Sivaperuman with His Golden complexion turned milk white by the smearing of Viputhy on His anthromorphic body (s^(r^6u^^SI(f^(3iDsfil).

CHAPTER - 1 The culmination of the vedas according to brahmana vaidikas is the vedantam. The well known samaya achariar (preceptor) of this system of Hindu Religion is Adi Sankarar. It is called Kevala advaita. He lived in the 8th century A.D. in South India. The means of reaching Brahman is \"knowledge\" as sruiti has it - \"tam evam vidvan amrta iha bhavati. Nan yah pantha ayanaya vidyate\" - it is by knowing HIM that (one) becomes immortal here, there is no other path for going (to HIM)'* Umapathy Sivachariar the last of the four Meikanda Santhanam Saintly lineage (Saiva Siddhanta preceptors) called it mayavatham. His predecessor Arunandi Sivachariar categorized it in his treatise, Sivagnana Siddhiar as pura samayam. The religions and philosophies of India are generally divided by Saiva Siddhanta preceptors into two main classes, the orthodox or inner group (^HdbiF&unuib) and the heterodox or outer group (L/P^lDLUlb) Saiva Siddhantam posits thirty six thaththuvas (<s<sg/6n/B/<s6ir - tools) Vedanta posits twenty eight thaththuvas** Note : * Vide p. 106, History of the Tamils from the earlest times to 600 A.

It consists of three parts 1) Spiritual or pure (ag>g>u>) 2) Mundane - Impure (<s/<9rjS0ib) 3) Admixture of pure and impure - suddha suddha (&ib{bit&ih2>tb ) Pure - (5) (1) Sivam (2) Sakthi (3) Sathakkiam (4) Easwaram and (5) Sudden Viddhai. Impure - (24) Known as Pirakirithimayai and are twenty four in number. 21 (6) Earth (7) Water (8) Air (9) Space and (10) Fire. These are called five Bhoothas. (11) Smell (12) Palate (13) Light (14) Touch (15) Sound. These are called Thammathirais (16) Ears (17) Skin (18) Eyes (19) Tongue (20) Nose. These are known as Gnanainthiriangal .

Admixture (30) Time (Airevib) (31) Niathi (32) Kalai (33) Viddhai (34) Aragam (35) Purushan (36) Mayai. Vedanta Thathuvas are as follows : (1) 5 Elements (Bhoothas) (2) 5 Sense Organs-Ears, Eyes, Skin, Tongue, Nose. (3) 5 Functions of the Sense Organs - Sound, Touch, Sight, Palate, Smell. (4) 1 0 Organs of the Body - Mouth, Legs, Hands. Excretory, Genital Organs and their respective functions. (5) Jeevathma, Brahman, and Greater Space ( ujiDir&rrujib ) which is beyond conception. The Vedanta declares the existence of a single soul only Brahmam; Saiva Siddhantam declares the plurality of souls beside Pad (Lord.) Vedanta interprets the Maha Vakya in such way to deny the reality of the Pasu concept of Saiva Siddhantam. When the Vedas declare the existence of one soul (Brahmam) the Saiva Siddhantam replies that the Pathi (Lord) of souls is one; not that there is only one soul. Vedas do not deny the plurality of souls. \"So far as the distinctive contribution of Saiva Siddhanta to Hindu thought is concerned, we may mention Siddhantam's happy use of the term \"ADVAITA\". Advaita means for him not mere non 22 difference as it does for the Kevala Advaitin but aunion, in separateness - (Vide page 304 \"Saiva Siddhanta\" by V. A. Devasenapathy, M. A., P. Hd., Professor of Philosophy by Madras University 1974.) This Union is permanent and eternal with no return to the painful cycle of births and deaths. A person with love and devotion serenely (Sathuviga state of the inner senses) and steadfastly practises Sariai (erflmiu) or Kiriai (dlrflsnuj) or Yogam (Giuirdbib) the three paths that lead the Athma to the Lotus Feet of Sivaperuman, by His grace attains the state of Iruvinai Oppu G§©6)5!sr>63r §>ul/) - absolute detachment both in pleasure and in pain, this is followed by ripening of the Karma (iD6vuiflunr<5bib) then the Thiruvarul sakthi which was hitherto remained as Tirothana Sakthi settles in the Athma. At this stage Sivaperuman out of his love for the Athma appears as Preceptor (Guru) in human form and performs Dikshai to the said Athma, the Athma is inducted by Sivaperuman into the non-dual union. This takes place only in the instance of Athmas who were Sakalar subject to all the three Malas. In the case of Vingnanakalar who is subject to only Anavamalam, Sivaperuman resides within the athma and enlightens it, thus the Anavam loses its force and in the case of Pralaya Kalar subject to two Malas, Anavam and Mayai, Sivaperuman manifests as Sri Kandar with - four hands, three eyes and Neelakantham (throat blued with the swallowing of Snake venom,) and performs Dikshai. Saiva Siddhantam, mentions a world of words ( Gi&rrsv^iabib) besides the material universe. These words are derived from Sudha Maya. Words (ujSib) are made up of letters ( 6H6si6snb ). These words conjunct with Sound become Speech, the Speech we hear through our ears, words our indicative of objects and the means of Athma's knowledge, there are four categories of Speech-Vaikari, Sukkumai, Paisanthe and Mathimai (s er>u&ih$ifl8D6iJdbifl,w$>$mw6iD6}iabifl). All the Manthirams are based on them in the Sivaperu State the Athma knows everything directly without the means of words or speech. In the aforementioned dual union all the three categories of Athmas on their release experience Sivaperuman who is Sat-Chit - Ananda - Sivaperuman's Sorupanilai (Q&ir®ur&GD6o) - transcendal state. 23 Thus dual Union is called Sivaperu - (<fi6uu(Supi) absolute Mukthi in this State Thiruvarud Sakthi leaves the Athma and the Athma forgets the Thiruvarud Sakthi. It is difficult to achieve this. (The following verses from Thugal Aru Potham\" gi&mgu Surrpib - ^(flifkuir (#it t£fri^)cj(#l/D/Dinu6o jBiri$&6rT Illummates it : \"6TO)60mhI<3bip6Stp bHt_(2lD <fl6vQlD6&r£)l Q&nr6V6vtT(jy(ip6or(26or a(p^hi)snp - psbso!nu(S<sb6n jglmpuipprrSm jglsD6aurr fgsnsvLU06sflsv r£l6org)i6fil@ Gprrir rg. \" Brahman is eternally immaculate, Omniscient. Omnipresent, Omnipotent, Transcendent. Why should he don the shackle of the Mayai and subjects himself to it's painful cycle of births and deaths and the frailties of the human body- ignorance, confusion forgetfulness etc. This could not be possibly called play or sport of the Divinity by any stretch of imagination; this big question is posed by Umapathy Sivachariar of the Meikandan Lineage, he calls Mayavadam (Vedantam) - in Mayawatha Sangatpa Nirakaranam Part 4) CHAPTER - 2 Sri Kantar also known as Thiru Neelakanta Sivachariar has written a commentary (Bhashiyam) like Sankarar on the Vedanta Sutras in the light of the upanishadas and the siva agamas. Sri Kantar was contemporary of Sankarar, but senior to Sankarar. Sri Kantar's bhashyam was earlier to that of Sankarar. Sri Kantar, though eminent as Sankarar, was a recluse, leading a life of sanctity and devotion and imbuing the minds of such disciples as were drawn to him by his sanctity and holy way. Appaiya Thikshitar has written a commentary on the bhashiyam of Sri Kantar. Appaiya Thikshitar was the gum and mentor of the great King Krishna Thevarayar. He was saintly and a devotee of Lord Siva. He has sung one hundred slokams in Sanskrit in praise of Lord Siva. Sri Kantar's Vedantam known as* Sivaadvaitham has much in common with Saiva Siddhantham or Suththa advaitham. It is placed a step below Saiva Siddhantham. It is counted as one of the six orthodox religions (^< <riDUJihidb6Tj) while Sankara's kevala advaitam is placed in the heterodox group. Sri Kantar holds that both the living and material universe is not different from Sivaperuman. Note : *Siva Advaitham recognises the intelligent and the inert only and contends that is not consistent with reason to affirm the existence of Souls as different from Siva and the Universe-Page 220 Saiva Siddhanta by V. A. Devasenapathy, M.A., P.Hd., Professor of Philosophy University of Madras. 25 The athma is incapable of knowing and Sivaperuman is the knower of everything. (e_uJ)(itj<S(gj 6T6arguib ^ipSkqib jsotsdld f§6i)6S)6u. tflsnSiD <siGf)Gsrg>G»g>u-iib <sitfjlujib). The athma that attains mukthi becomes absolutely one with Sivaperuman unlike in the Suththa advaitham. Siva advaitham postulates parinamavadam, (uflgxMTtDewrgjuD) transformation theory, ascribing change to the chit sakthi of Sivaperuman. Nilakanta Vijayam, describes the meeting of Sankarar and Sri Kantar. Under Sri Kantar's influence Sankarar is said to have composed the Soundarya Lahari and other devotional works promoting bakthi. In one of these works he refers in most adoring terms to the great Thirugnanasambanthar and speaks of him as the dravida sisu (child) Thirugnanasambandar, it must be remembered was a brahmin. In Sivananda lahiri, Sankarar refers to Saint Kannappar the Veddah Saint and says, \"Foot wear used in paths becomes a bunch of holy grass to the person of Pasupathi. Washing-by spiting a mouthful of water a holybath, the remnants of half eaten flesh (as Neivethiam) a fresh oblation and a woodman the greatest of Bhaktas. What is there impossible for Bhakthi?\" * In \"Siva Poosankam\" Sankarar refers reverently to the unworldly deeds of the Saiva Saints Iyatpakayar, Siruthondar, and Sandeesar and says \"Oh Lord of the Mountain Thou didst show Thy Holy Presence before those who wronged a wife, a son and a father respectively. I am incapable of harming anybody. I do not know how Thou wouldst do any favour to me\".* Note : 1) The Elements of Saiva Siddhantham - by Thiru A.

It is through incessant devotion and love of Sivaperuman one could attain Mukthi. How this devotion and love could be fostered is thus described by Sri La Sri Arumuga Navalar in his Saiva Vinavidai : \"U<Sd6<S6rT/T<99tiJ plb(ip601L.IU @}60<5>t3E>666T!hl<5,6016mLILb U3iU$LUir<S&UJ <5fl6nQu©iD/rgp/fiS)i_uj ^ 6 Vdt>< 3 b 6 oonoi<s> 60 i 6 nLLiib, 6Tppi60i60onLiib Qurfhu <fi6iiQu([F>tDtr6Br 6Tppi60i60ortLjib pu)AQ<sb6b60irib ggipraaQ 6T6ifl6ujb&l $)LLIirg)l 6 T 6 drgIllb &-Ll< 3 brfh&(ff)lb Qu©lb <Sb(lfi 601600 TLLflb ^ 6 il 6 ^kU 6 VlSl 6 SI ,9/«n75ja (Sdbm^LtSev §>© &hprm5l60Mb g—snuLueuit dlpir §?©6u©ib pic&tg, @6O60/r SniDSmULL/tb @ 601 UlUpirp)l {flpgzl&xSb plD 3 >(p <fl 6 iiQu([f,iDtrGfih~g>gSla} ,316001 6 filGi) 6 miiib.\" \"^I6il60t ^/®6TTfrS6U ^611601 pi T6ir 6H600llhl<sSl<j <fl p60)p IDdSlfgi? <fl6Ul_llJ-[T 600Ipp60l60160l (ippSOlp 6§ 601601 QPQgpILD 6piU ^60}iyUU6U60t LLHT60I\" Sivapuranam, Thiruvasagam of Saint Manickavasagar. An easy way to keep up this constant thought of the Lord consists in meditating on HIS Name - namasivaya in five letters (pui<#l6imu) and singing the secred songs of thevaram, thiruvasagam, thiruvisaipa, thirupallandu and periyapuranam. The Lord's thiruvarul (grace) is necessary to attain mukthi. The Siva agamas prescribe four margas or paths for the attainment of mukthi. They are sariyai, kiriyai, yogam & gnanam. They are explained in beautiful and easy language by Kadavul Maamunivar in his thiruvathavur adigal puranam ; thus it says : \"^61160060 6TlDdb@) ^ lb ID60IT U>ljrOI(Sb6h ^J,<S<S6b, *3llbl£>6VIT U0pp6V, ^llbl£>6VfriT60 prr@l6vrr6ii60)£b prriru6v &60>i£>pp6v p60oruiJl6b 6Tibq£bip &rrpp&, prnb (ElD 61]LD ^{ > 6VUJlb z3t6Va£ll_6V, Ql£>Qp£&L.6V GflemOldb jB6b635)6TTcS@ @@jS6b , 6TLD &li$ILIITIT<£>(g) 6J6H60 ^601601611 Q&lUpti), jD^c 7lfl601LU HDlUPff) 6116U6V61UT<5b(p 61 lb &_6l)(gj ^6lfluSuiTLD . \" \"Laying flower beds and planting flower trees, Gathering their flowers and making garlands of various kinds for Us, 27 Chanting our praises, cleaning and paving with water and cowdung our temples And lighting them and the serving of our devotees These form sariyai and those who perform it with religious fervour, We admit to Our Kingdom\".

His relationship with the Lord was of a good son and father - sat putra margam. Saint Sundarar followed the yoga margam or path. His absolute devotion love and absorption was demonstrated when he visited Nataraja temple of Chidambaram and saw the Lord.

Saint Sundarar's relationship was that of a good friend - saka margam.

After mature consideration realising the truth of the tripatharthas. And getting rid of egoistic knowledge Which is trivial and attaining sivagnanam, Such is gnana sadans And those blessed souls who thus realize sivananam attain Our sacred feet.\" The former three are each absolute and finally the aspirants attain sivagnanam and the feet of the Lord in this case. Saint Manickavasagar followed the gnana margam or path. His relationship with the Lord was of a guru and disciple. Lord Siva manifesting as a gnanachariar soujourned at Thiruperumthurai seated under the shade of a salubrious kuruntha tree was giving discourses on Siva agamas to a group of alleged disciples who were really His Ganas. Saint Manickavasagar who had 30 gone to Thiruperumthurai to buy steeds from the Arab traders for the Pandyan King saw this scene of the Gnanachariar and His disciples, went close to them and was watching them. The Lord cast His blissful eyes on Manickavasagar and thus initiated him. It is called nayana theekai.. Manickavasagar was the Chief Minister of the Pandyan King. He fell at the feet of the Lord and from that moment he remounced every thing including the chief Ministership. Sri La Sri Arumuga Navalar the Saiva Savant has explained tensely and explicitly the said four paths in the following words : \"sn&ai &iDiu&sr>g> <#!«/Qu©tDirg2l«»Laj S&it iciT&dbdbLD ^rflsDiu, dQiflsnuj, Si urr&ib, (Qrrssnb srsn 6H&n<sbLJu(f)ib. ^sn6Ut56^56frS6TT &[flGniuiurr6i]g ) i Lip^Q^rr^eSlmirSeo £_(®6i/s£^l(f5(otD63f)«DLU SibitsksS^ Q&iiiiLiib 6uy5)u/r(0. <3£hf}&nmLurr6iig)i LVDibQ&rrySleb, <gi&&Q&rryp6v 6Tgp/ii> @U8Bn$asriT%)iib ^9/©sij(/56i/jS ja^©(Su36af)6i»tu SjBiT<sb<3£l3 : Q&iijujib 6iiy5luir®.

Sariai is said to be physical service to Sivaperuman's Anthromorphic Forms. Kiriai is the worship of the Lord as Sivalingam - formless form both physically and spiritually. \"Yogam, is the spiritual worship of Sivaperuman in His formless aspect Gnanam, is the worship of Sivaperuman with the true knowledge attained by His Grace, His* Satchitananda aspect. It transcends all the earlier three aspects - Anthromorphic, Sivalingam and Formless state.

It is as Jothi.

D. extolling the important role of the four saints : \"King of words , the son of Thonipuram Our Sundarar Vathavurar embodiment of gnanam not bom in time Where would be the holy ashes Which would be the vedas Where would be the five letters of my Lord.\" Bakthi is the bed rock of the Suththa Advaita Siddhanta Saivaism (Savaite Hinduism). The Sacret hymns of the four samaya kuravar and other beatified saints of Saivaite Hinduism, divided into twelve cantos are all soul stirring outpourings of their boundless Bakthi, constant singing of them with piety and devotion would imbibe bakthi. Regular temple worship and meditation on the Panchaksharam (five letters) are also necessary to attain the final deliverance of the athma (soul). The bakthi of saint Kannappar was unique and incomparable beyond description. Kannappan was a hunter (So/i _«r) lad bom of the forest, unsophisticated and illiterate. He was the son and successor of the Kalahasti forest tribal hunter chief. Kannappan went on his maiden hunting escapade with his comrades and roamed the forest of Kalahasti hunting wild anima ls. 32 In the midst of the jungle he beheld a lonely Sivalingam. - Lord Kudumi Thevar. Kannappan was like a cow with its newly bom calf refusing to lose sight of Him - The Lord. \"(SbjijpiT 6$ sen inmib Surrsvdb \" - Thirupulampal Thiruvasagam. In his ecastacy Kannappan embraced the Lord to his bosom. His heart sank to think that the Lord was alone in a lonely forest in the midst of wild beasts without any one to protect or give Him food. Day and night passed. He ate not, he slept not and watched the Lord. Kannappan completely lost his ego -all sense of his \"self - \"I\" and the world around him, thought of nothing except the Lord, for all intent and purpose the world had ceased to exist, he fully abnegated himself, what is more he could not feel the pain when he scooped his eye to implant on the Lord's bleeding eye. The sublimity of the bakthi of Kannappan was demonstrated to the world by the following endearing words of Kudumi Thevar, the Lord of Kalahasti when Kannappan had placed the sharp point of the arrow to scoop his second eye to implant on the other bleeding eye of the Lord, He (the Lord) pounced and held back firmly the hands of Kannappan and appealingly spoke to him as follows to stop the said scooping : 3>&msxstliu! abssatssaiin i ! 6T6ST <5/OTLt«rN_jS (2jZ>/T631/D6i) d66031633TUuJ\" * Saint Manicavasagar in thirukoththumbi Hymn 218 lauds in unequalled terms - Kannappan's bakthi: \"dusjorawruufflr 6puugj qit ^63tl/ ^esrenuo <X> 6301 UlSI 601 6163I60TUU63I 61 631 fyUlSA 5T63T«D63ni/tb ^LQtSrT653n_©6rf).... \" \"After finding that there was no one to equal Kannappan in Bakthi, my Father enslaved me too knowing that I was the most undeserving, not comparable in any way\". Note : * Vide Thirumaram of Thirukannappa Thevar - Saint Nakkeerar. 11th Thirumurai. 33 Kannappan bade his comrades to return to their homes and remained behind to guard the Lord Whom, he thought was alone in the forest and on the following morning he saw a Saintly Sivachariar (priest) performing poosanai in the conventional agamic way with holy water ($irg>g,ib) in a copper vessel, flowers. Naivethiam (cooked rice in honey and ghee) and offering obeisance with thupa (incense) and theepam (lamp) following it, Kannappan used his mouth as Kalasam and brought holywater and spat on Kudumi Thevar as abishekam (holy bathing) and offered roasted choice pork as naivethiam, the Lord relished it as much as He relished the former. Later as upasaram Kannapapan placed his sandalled foot on Lord's Face to the joy of the Lord. \" Qurra^tLujbffl^ Q&djfJmrn y,*6in63r®6rr Quit 6b 6§6miiia>& Q*®UL(fbjD if [Tty SMTLLhSbdbSO^lii SS!6ST(jp^>lb 6fil([TjLJLItj)g)l (o6Tll_ SUIT IT Q<3 =I_J^IlU G)UXri@6lfl/f/BjS/B/ <£©l Qupgji jS6srjnsuiT Qg>rrQ6mir&<5bib ^i_ rrQwir.\" -Thiruvasagam - Thiruthonokkam Saint Manickavasagar. Kannapans s sacrifice of his eye was supreme and spontaneous, absolutely selfless not expecting anything in return. In contrast the prayers and austere penance by the celestial minor deities - Mahavishnu, Brahma, Indran and host of others and the mumvars of the vedic age are not by any account selfless, it was always done with motive to gain power and long celestial life to indulge in its unlimited pleasures, after all they are all Anu (soul) vargam (species). Lord Vishnu to retrieve his prestigious weapon, the disc (&a,3>rrib) did penance to Lord Siva. He offered 1008 lotus flowers. One of them, coming short, offered his eye in its place. Probably referring to this and to those of others Saint Manickavasagar in his aruivuruthal thiruchathakam sings thus ; 'enrrtpgtgfisvgjiLD 6iirr6or6)iit <x>m j a™ 6n/rtp6nrr6<jr idsstld rSesrurrsv sS/ripssa/eugifB jS/rib s^luitjb&i sSibeniDQujeveorriB G<a/np Qsmxm^.\" 34 Hence it is futile in worshipping them. It is relevant to quote the thirupallandu here : \"Q(yfr6t>60fr635n_ aQjj^lu Qun(if}Sn (S&irgSl&gt g&UJlDfflg) Gl^63OTL©6T76Tflt <#6U6U/r6Bori£/b <#la Ojaiqig, <fl6o(Sg>6}jfr (flgyQrbjfil @&jit(3id 6iS6b6Ofr600ri_ <3b6or<x>g> (Siys5m(SiD(iT) 6fill_rhl<3b63l 6&6B)l-UUira>6&r U6V60IT 630r(o)L 631 SNIP Ug,lhl<5bl_J5 jSITgJlASdB U6bajfT63(jr(g <3h aJIS/Stn. ” -Senthanar - Ninth thirumurai \"You holy devotees who were well versed in the Vedas To Keep away from the cult of petty deities Who perish while, sing in praise of the Lord Bearing a bow & arrow Residing in the golden Mt. Meru and rides the bull. He is eternal transcending all time factor Wish HIM many years.\" One would wonder how Kannappan an illiterate hunter and dweller of the forest killing animals unacquainted with the shastras and religion attained such high state of Godliness and mukthi without the preliminary stages of spirituality. Arunandi Sivachariar in his preface verse to Sivagnana siddhar gives the answer as follows : \"usm&nLjBjn jD6ii£50ir6V (S&rr mjfilu uij tommu Ujs<^) i least qspiih G)ja/r688n_«o/riS @yir(o 60 T gjriu a>$u3&ftl6b Q&ir@)UU6or.\" \"Holy virtuous and pious devotees Consequent to their bakthi in the previous births to God Would be given mukthi direct by HIM Even though they had no knowledge of the shastras.\" The Sangam poet and Saint Nakkirar in the undermentioned verse states that there is no one equal to Aijuna, the Mahabharata hero in thapas (penance) and impliedly alludes that Arjuna was bom as Kannappan privileged to embrace the sacred body of Lord Kudimi Thevar of Kalahasti : 35 \"6u/nD/r«jr(S(Sfr «J 6 U 60 sumuQuirif e-fil&Lusnmu QurrAi ^it&rnb 2_60c5$d) ^)6ii(ipsDLUJfrfr - jSfnb ^fr<s@ib <56/rfiJ3IL_2)@ ^rfhlllJfTLUA &>lTSng>$ ^,l£6Wr8n6Bt&, ^sssjuiT00rr6ai GlujbfBsnuMJirjjD Q&sstpi.\" \"Who is there equal in thapas to Vjayan (Arjunan) Who fights valiantly with his chariot drawn by steeds driven by Krishna He had the rare privilege to touch the PERSON of The Lord of Kalahasti WHOM it is difficult for others to know.\" There is a story in Mahabharatha. When Aijuna was performing thapas to Lord Siva, Dhuriodanan instigated an asura to kill Aijuna. The asura took the form, of a wild boar and charged at Aijuna. Seeing this the Lord to save His devotee, in the guise of a hunter with His retinue and dogs killed the boar with an arrow. Aijuna who was disturbed from his thapas by the clamour of the hunters, the barking of the dogs and the snorting of the wild boar had sent an arrow himself. A wordy hot argument ensued as to who killed the wild boar which ultimately led to blows. Aijuna hit the Lord with the bow, it was followed by hand to hand fight. Arjuna was hurled into the air. Nothing discomforted by the fall. Aijuna returned to the fray when Lo! There was no Kirathan (Lord as Hunter,) to be seen. Then the Lord revealed Himself to Aijuna. This event demonstrates the intense bakthi of Aijuna. CHAPTER - 3 The Saivaite Hindu Religion as this is called is completely different from Vedanta and is called Suddha advaita Siddhantham. The vedanta posits only ONE REALITY behind the universe - Brahhmam. *The Saiva Siddhantha posits tatvatrayam threefold reality - pathi psau and pasam which could be established logically, scientifically and epistemologically. The Vaidika rites require the division of the people into four vamas (caste) and led to the exclusion of the members of the last vama from the study of the Vedas and Vedanta. The division of the people into four varnas also led to the development of the vamaashrama dharma. The outcome of this was the doctrine that sanyasa was open alone to the Brahmanas and mukthi or veedu was attainable only after the special training in the life of the sanyasi. The corollary of this doctrine was that mukthi according to the vaidika path is attainable only by Brahmanas and in consequence the portals of Sankara Math are closed to non - Brahmanas. The Siva agamas totally opposes these doctrines. Any one even a so called chandala of the lowest caste can procure a Sivalingam and perform Sivapooja. The Periapuranam the most sacred biographical masterpiece of religious literature on the lives of the Saiva saints, refers to sudra siva thondars who worshipped Lord Siva in temples. Note : * Vide Pages 120 & 121, History of the Tamils From the Earliest Times to 600 AD - By P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar. Asian Educational Service, New Delhi. Madras . 1995 37 The Vedanta and Vedas are sealed books to the Sudras. Badarayana a sutrakara has a special section establishing this view. He considered the sudras are not entitled to ceremonial purification and are prohibited from hearing the recital and the study of the Vedas. Centuries later Swami Vivekananda gave Vedanta a new dimension freeing It from Brahmincal fundamentalism and making it popular. The Siva agamas on the contrary are open to all. Even a menial pariah by caste could receive Siva thikshai from an Adi Saiva Priest of the highest order of the Chidambaram temple, the thillaival anthanar. Pettan Samban a firewood cutter, a pariah by caste received thikshai from saint Umapathy Sivachariar belonging to the legendary thillaival anthanars, an exalted congregation of saintly Adi Saivas, privileged in the past to perform pujas and otherwise serve Lord Natarajah at the Chidambaram temple. Sanyasam is not a necessary preliminary to Mukthi. Bhakthi opened to all castes can steer even a householder across the ocean of Samsara to Mukthi. The system of Caste under the clock of Dharmam was introduced into the Tamil country by the Brahmanas during the vedic age. On the question of Saiva religion and the system of Caste Arumuga Navala Peruman states thus : <9=n\"<2))(rf)6p(6f) dfiDtuGiD tSigjhsbib. <yir>LU<s^)gj /(63 &rr@fl Q< 3 >iT 6 nGii$i i 9 r(f 5 <zP 11/0325) ^9/g )/ usu npssi rpit 4 > r^ih QPQgOMDiLiib 6 ifl 6 /)rfr 0 ii) \" - gjIqFid) £)0/r6O3rL/f Lf!fir6ssnb\" - ih sb qvir it iPGP'S/B/T 6 V 6 VIT ^MSIIIT 3>6mT6V <3505?

To say that religion is subject to the Caste Restrictions and Considerations is Contradictory to the Principles of Scriptures, expediency and experiences \" - Thiruthondar Puranam prose by Arumuga Navala AVL - Page 38 \"The Glory of the Three Nayanmar.\" Navalar was not an adherent of caste, he only stressed on the strict observance of Saiva Ethics (sn&suQrbfl) 38 In this respect he always had a liberal outlook like the Saiva Nayanmars and Santnanacharias. Distinctions of caste, class and colour of skin are almost synonymous similarly are the untouchability of the Hindu Society and the apathied of the South African Society. Thanks to the reform zeal of Mahatma Gandhi and the granting of popular voting rights have eradicated the curse of untouchability. Similarly Nelson Mandela's epic struggle against the dominant white minority in South Africa has put an end to apartheid. Distinctions of caste, class and colour were borne with the Society from time immemorial The concept of classless Society visualized by Karl Marks Lenin and Trostky and Mao were only a dream, the Russian and the Chinese Revolutions have failed to create a classless society hence their eradication seems to be an impossibility. Caste and the Untouchability were vocationally based and conditioned in the Hindu Society. In the ancient days, there was animosity between the vaidikas and the agamikas. The latter denounced the shedding of blood in the name of Gods and opposed to the eating of all meat and fish and specially beef. \"South Indian Brahmanas of this period like those of the North India were meat eaters. They ate beef meat of the oxen and the cow and consumed intoxicant liquor known as somapanam. It was the impact of Tamil Saivaism, and Jainism, that made them to become vegetarians and adopting absentation from meat and liquor\" *The Brahmanas of South India are called smartas. In fact vegetarian in Tamil is called \"Saivam\". The vaidikas on the other hand regarded the agamas with supreme contempt. The Adi Saivas (temple priests) are regarded as inferior Brahmanas having had their origin from the Dravidians. For the agamikas the temple worship is a must. To the Vedantists it is not necessary. Even Jeevan mukthas (saints attaining Mukthi during their life time while in their bodies) regularly worshipped in temples. The four Nayanmars (jeevan mukthas) visited regularly the temples throughout the length and breadth of South India worshipping and singing soul stirring Hymns. The Jeevan Mukthas continued temple worship to 39 ward off the onslaught of the vasana malam. - remnant of the anava malam - the ego, the consciousness of \"I\" and \"Mine\" of an individual. This remnant is best illustrated by the common example of a container that had previously asafoetida (perunkayam). The remnant of the vasana malam could be perilous. Originally the agamic methods of worship being entirely fireless and not being accompained by the recitation of vedic mantras, must have been developed from the dasyu - non Aryan rites. \"The dasyu ritual consisted in offering food to the deity to the accompaniment of ritual singing and dancing. That was how, according to Valmiki, the coronation of Sugriva was celebrated, a coronation being in those days not a secular but a religious ceremonial\". The non- Aryan people who lived in India and Sri Lanka before the advent of the Aryan hordes were called dasyus. In course of time the fire rites has been absorbed into the agamic mode of worship. Dasyus were many tribes, most prominent and numerous were yakshas ((§jLu&3>rt), - leader Ravana ; Nagas - cobra tribe; the monkey tribe - Vali, Sugrivan and Hanuman belonged to this tribe, the latter were not really monkeys. They had monkey as its totem. They were not uncivilized aborigins or animals devouring humans as alleged maliciously by the Aryans who were their enemies. Both Ravana and Vali were great Saivaites devoted to the worship of Lord Siva. They were valiant at war. It should be noted both in the Vedas and the epics and puranams side by side with vicious denunciations of the alleged savagery of the dasyus, there are innumerable passages referring to their high civilisation, their castles and palaces their gold ornaments their wealth etc. Mayan, Visvakarma and Mahaduwatta were great architects and sculptors in building castles, temple and palaces, all dasyus. Mandothari, Queen of Ravana and the daughter of Mayan was not second to Sita in beauty, grace, and pathy bakthi. Mandothari excelled Sita, in Siva bakthi. Lord Siva described as \"QjSsjrsjr/rganLiu Ssusn” Lord of the Sourthem realm, on many occasions crossed the ocean from His abode at Uttarakosa Ma nk ai Temple and appeared before Mandothari in human form at her palace. 40 Ravana was a great scholar of the Vedas, he was an expert in reciting \"sama veda\" to music, he was without an equal. The rishis Viswamithra, Agastya and Pulasthiar were also dasyus. They were flot barbarians waiting to be civilized by the Aryans who were a normad tribe rearing cattle in the steppes of Central Asia before they intruded into India. In Rama's time Aryan customs began to infiltrate but slowly south of Godavari river. This compelling influence of Aryan civilzation made some rakshasas to learn Sanskrit. Ravana too had become an expert in it. Moreover many rakshasas became great Brahmanas, scholars of the Vedas and performers of austerities. They were called Brahmarakshasas. Agasthiar and Viswamithirar belonged to this class. Pulasthiar, Ancestor of Ravana was also a Brahmarakshasa. Great must have been the consequences of Raman's victory and extinction of Ravana's power south of the Godavari River and the Vindya Hills. The Aryans who had been pushing to the South of the Janasthana (outpost of Ravana at the southern bank of the River Godavari) even before Rama's time had now spread in larger numbers further south. The number of Brahmarakshasas increased. The word Brahmarakshasas originally meant either the progeny of Brahamanas who allied themselves with dasyus like the sons of Viswamitra who were banished by the irate rishi to the south. They became Brahmanas and formed the Viswamitra or Kausika gotras and those who became disciples of Agastya were affiliated to his gotra (lineage). Even before these the Bhargavas and their spiritual descendants had begun to spread in South India. The Bhagavata Purana IX 16-29-37 says that Maddhucchandas and the other younger sons who obeyed Viawamitra became Kausikas and other elder sons who disobeyed him belonged to the Viswamitra gotra. It is clear that the Brahmanas of the South India were not of Aryan origin and their claim that they are superior to Adi Saivars is not tenable. The New Brahmanas of the South in some respects preserve the customs of the Vedic age intact and in some others they have adopted south Indian customs that were un aryan, such as tying of thali as the most important act of the marriage rite and the wearing 41 round the neck a bit of thread dyed in turmeric. Another non- Aryan custom is the one in which the husband that is to be is welcomed by the mother of the bride and bride's maids is a relic of the old Dasyu rites, he and his bride are made to stand beneath the marriage pandal, their feet is symbolically washed in milk and balls of rice dyed in red and thrown in all directions. Another is taking of the right hand of the bride by the bride groom and the taking of the seven steps as the ritual act of the sacrament of the marriage. The aforementioned receptidn of the bride and bridegroom under the pandal, put up for the occasion is described in 'agam 86' The balls of rice mixed with blood such as is described in Thirumurugatrupadai is offered to Murugan in worshipping Him. These customs must have been introduced into Arya rites of vivaha (marriage) by the dasyu ladies whom the early Arya immigrants married. These Brahmanas follow the vaidika cult of Hinduism. It was the Aryan civilisation, culture and religion the starting point in the history of the delineation of the civilizations of India and Sri Lanka. Prior to this was a dark period as there was no direct and authentic evidence of the history of India and Sri Lanka before the advent of Aryans. In the circumstances the epochal discoveries of the buried cities of Mohenjadaro in the Sind and the Harappa in Punjab have revolutionized the saga of the ancient pre- Aryan and pre Vedic history of the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka which were inter connected from time immemorial. Further the recent excavations have revealed more buried sites and remains in places far apart in the Indian sub - continent evidencing that the Indus Valley civilizations spread over an extensive part of India. The Indus Valley civilization was a highly developed one and it must have taken number of millennia to reach that stage. The most significant feature of these findings is that the Mohenjadaro site contains a series of cities built on the top of the ruins of another. So far seven layers have been excavated many more may yield if excavated further. The people of this civilization were Dasyus of whom the Nagas, Yakshas and the people of Vali, Suggrevan and Hanuman were the most prominent tribes with their individual totems. They were all worshippers of Lord Siva and His Sakthi, the Mother Goddess. The artifact findings of female figures with elaborate head dress and ornamentation and dress and the figures of male deity seated with crossed legs on a pedastal like a Yogi are said to be anthropomorphic representation of Lord Siva and the Sivalingam the formless form, of Lord Siva as Sadasivamurthy are ample evidence of the cult of Siva and his Sakthi the mother Goddess; \"Qg>6M&srrr(Fj6m_iu ^lsu(o6sr (Surrjnjfil 6TJBJBITL.

The earliest canons of Saivaite Hinduism are the Siva agamas 28 in number preceding in time to the thirumurais and meikanda shastras. Saint Manickavasagar who lived in the present Tamil Nadu in the 3rd century in his \"keerthi thiruagavel\" sings : \"iDOTfflf u>/nr>63>6u u>(Sa>j 5 g>y iLpsafljb Q&it sir sir (8g>rrppi «S)sSs£©6Tf)ujii>. \" Lord Siva from the heights of the sacred Mahendra mountains revealed the Siva agamas. Valmiki's Ramayana has reference to the golden coloured Mahendra mountain now submerged under the ocean south of Cape Comerin*. This mountain abode of Lord Siva in the south was like the Mt. Kailash of the north. Ilangovadigal author of the 2nd century A.D., epic Silappathikaram refers to the suubmerged continent as the old territory of the Pandian dynasty at the sourthem extremity of which a gigantic mountain chain called Panmalai and a huge river called Pahruli were situated, India was known as Navalam* in those days and Kumari Kandam as it was known \"based on facts and figures found in irayanar ahapporul and Buddhist sources\".

Thus we find the Siva agamas are ancient beyond the concept of history and were in writing unlike the Vedas. \"Slowly, very slowly the Vedanta and Agama schools gravitated towards each other, in the puranas they exist side by side yet not blended into one. Even in the time of Adi Sankarar (8th century A.D.) we find the fundamental differences persisted and they were Note : ** Valmiki Ramayana and Sivatharumoththaram of Maraignana Sambanthar refer to the existance of Mahendra mountain as situated south of Pothigai hills.

Varatharajan, Palaniappa Brothers Madras Publication. (This mountain has gone under the ocean) * Tennents History Ceylon p. 7. 44 not amalgamated into one. Adi Sankarar in expanding the Vedanta sutras follows Badarayana and condemns the agamas as heretical, yet his \"prapanca hridya\" is a pure agama work and he is called \"Sanmathasthapanacarya\" because according to tradition he systematized the worship of Siva, Vishnu, Sakthi Ganapathy, Subramanya and Suriya and introduced it in the rituals observed in maths founded by him. * Saivaite Hindus long before the advent ol saint Manickavasagar (3rd Century A.D.) accepted both the Vedas and the Siva agamas. They are said to be collateral, if there is any conflict between the two the Siva agamas supersede. During the time of Saint Manicavasagar there was a highly developed system of Saivite Hindu religion based on the Siva agamas and it must have taken thousands of years to reach that stage. Maraimalai Adigal of Tamilnadu (1876 to 1950) the great scholar of Saiva Siddhantha and Tamil, after extensive research concluded that Saint Manickavasagar lived in the 3rd century A. D. His findings are further supported by the following references to Saint Manickavasagar in the 4th Thirumurai of Saint Navukkarasar of the 7th century A.

T. Srinivasa Iyengar. Asian Educational Services. 45 These are divine never failing words (QumuajirQuM^I) of Saint Navukkarasar. By the close of the 3rd century A. D., the muventhar (Chola, Pandya and Sera Kings) of the Tamil speaking people owing to their internecine wars had become weak and disorganised, they were vulnerable to invading hodes from outside; just then a tribal dynasty of rulers known as Kalapirar who had established a kingdom on the borders of the Tamil country, in Kannada invaded and occupied many parts of the Tamil territories. For about three centuries they ruled with an iron hand, they professed fundamental form of Jainism. This was a dark period for Saivaism, Tamil and the culture in the Tamil country. All religious and cultural activities were stilled, temples were closed, Saivaism had a big set back. Finally when the Kalapirars were defeated in war by the Pandyans and Pallavas, in the wake of their retreat Jainism in the most bigoted form had taken route in the Tamil country. Both the Pandyan and Pallava kings in the 7th century A. D. had become Jains, a ruthless and unscrupulous Jain priestly hierarchy controlled the countries and the respective kings. Saivism was at its lowest ebb, wearing viputhy and uttering Sivanamam were serious offences . All violations were punished severely. So much so the Pandyan Queen (Chola Princess) Mangaiyarkarasiar who remained as an indomitable Saivaite was wearing viputhi under cover on her bosom. It was left to Saints Thiru Gnanasambandar and Navukkarasar to bring back the respective kings to the fold of Saivism and re-establish Saiva neethi to its most exalted glory: following the footsteps of Saints ThiruGnanasambandar and Thirunavukkarasar, Sundarar (8th Century A.D) last of the thevara trios like his predecessors visited the temples in the length and breadth of South India singing Hymns and causing miracles, he consolidated the work of the previous two. This renaissance set in motion with vigour by the Nayanmars with their soul stirring Hymns in (j^jBjSuSjp) pure Tamil and the series of miracles and contact with masses transcending all caste and other social disability introduced into the Saiva Tamil society under Aryan Brahmanical influence, brought about an upsurge of bhakti among 46 the people and their rulers. This in later years generated unprecedented temple building activity under the Cholas who held sway over South India and Sri Lanka. The nayanmars - Saints Thirugnanasambandar and Sundarar singing thevara pathigams from the shores of Rameswaram on the Lord of the ancient Temple of Thiruketheeswaram and Saint Navukkarasar praising the Lord of Thirukeetheeswaram in the first two and a half line of his Thevaram on Thiruveelimilalai and Saint Thirugnanasambandar singing a pathikam on the presiding deity of Thirukoneswaram of Thirukonamalai, Sri Lanka, brought north and east parts of Sri Lanka which are Saivaite and Tamil speaking into the orbit of their renaiscence movement. North and east of Sri Lanka remain as the bastion of Saiva Siddhanta tradition and the Tamil language in its pristine purity more than in Tamil Nadu. The aforementioned temple building activity commenced with the Dowager Queen Sembianmadevi, the grand aunt of Rajaraja Cholan I. She built several new temples and rebuilt in granite renowned ancient temples which were of bricks. The Cholas of the Vijayalan Dynasty were one of the most gifted of dynasties which hailed in India. The Cholas - Rajarajan-1, his valiant son Rajendran-1 grandsons Rajathirajan-1, Rajendra Deva- 11, and Virarajendran who followed on the throne in that order and the grandsons of Rajendra- 1 by his daughter - Kulothungan-1 and his successors Kulothungan 11 otherwise known as Anapayan, Rajaraja 1 1 and Kulothungan 111 were all great devotees of Lord Nataraja of Chidambaram and Thiagesar of Thiruvarur. All the Cholas were crowned at the Natarajah temple, Chidambram by the legendary thillaival anthanar adisaivas. Rajarajan-l's great grandfather Parantaka (905-955 A.D.) covered the roof of the Nataraja Temple of Chidambaram with sheets of gold. Cholas made several liberal endowments to these temples. Rajarajan- 1 built the great temple of Tanjore, the grandest of the Chola temples, his son Rajenddran- 1 built the magnificent temple of Gangaikonda Cholapura, Rajarajan 11, the Son of Kulothungan 1 1 built the great temple of Darasuram close to Kumbakonam and Kulothungan 1 1 1 built the stupendous Thirupuvanam temple with a 47 separate temple for Sarapar within its complex, a unique manifestation of Lord Siva taken to subdue Vishnu as Narasimha who ran amok after killing Irania Kassipu and drank his blood, this temple is also close to Kumbakonam. Thiruketheeswaram temple has an equisite Icon of Sarapar. Natarajah temple of Chidambaram held the Cholas under a spell, with the result successive later Chola rulers devoted more and more attention and state resources to the expansion and embellishment of the temple which is considered as their kula theivam. Kulotunga 11 (A.D. 1133 to 1150) otherwise known as \"Anapayan\" according to Kulotunga ula sung by his court poet Ottakuthan gilded with gold the Ponnambalam and built seven storeyed gopurams etc. Since Chidambaram temple immemorially known as a Saivaite temple and as the seat of Saiva religion, Kulotunga considered the presence of the Govindaraja shrine as an anachronism and got it removed. Now it has been restored. The great achievement of his reign from the point of view of Saiva religion is the composition of the epic Periapuranam by Saint Sekkilar. Raja Raja 1 1 (A.D. 1 146 to 1 172) son of Kulotunga 1 1 became crown Prince in 1 146 A. D. Raja Rajah 1 l's rule was peaceful and was a period of religious and literary activities, the extent of the Empire remained unaltered. Gangai Konda Cholapuram was his capital, and Palayarai alias Ayirattali was his subsidiary capital. The poet Ottakuthan composed the raja raja cholan ula on him. Raja Raja 1 1 mostly stayed in Palayarai close to Darasuram. The Rajaraja Cholan ula and takkayagaparani sung by his poet Ottakuthan mention his temple building activities. While his grandfather Vikrama Chola and father Kulontunga 1 1 concentrated their attention mainly on expanding and embellishing existing temples, Raja Raja 1 1 built some magnificent new edifices, among them is the Raja Rajeswaram Udayar Temple of Darasuram in his 48 alternate capital city. This temple is now known as Airavateeswarar of Darasuram which is about four kilometres from Kumbakonam. This is one of the four stupendous all stone vimana temples built by Imperial Cholas, the others being Rajarajewaram of Tanjore built by RajaRajanl. Gangaikonda Cholapuram, built by his son Rajendranl and Thirubhuvana Iswaram built by Kulotunga 1 1 1 (A. D. 1 178 to 1218) \"In grandeur and sheer beauty of sculpturing, each vies with the others and each is great in its own way unique\". 0 Rajarajah 1 1 like Rajarajah 1 revered and loved to listen to the singing of thevaram and other thirumurai Hymns. In the prakaram of the Darasuram temple he had installed one hundred eighth (108) statues in stone of the othuvars who were regularly singing thevaram and other thirumurai Hymns at the temple as part of the temple rites and otherwise. Only those who had received Siva thikshai (initiation from a competent guru) could serve the Lord at the temple. The mantram imparted by the guru to the disciple at the time of the Siva thikshai is Sri panchaksharam - namasivaya (jBU><fisimu). Consequently the afore - mentioned othuvars appointed by Raj Rajah 1 1 to sing thevaran and other thrumurai Hymns had received Siva thikshai. They received the most sublime form of Siva thikshai known as nirvana thikshai. Out of the three prescribed in the Siva agamas, the other two being in the order of merit are Siva thikshai (&ux u tf&aneig) and viseda thikshai. Each of them were christened with a thiksha namam following the initiation - Isana Sivan, Agora Sivan and Thatpurusha Sivan were some of the thiksha names. They did not receive the achary a abishekam which is another exalted ceremony for inducting a person as a sivachariar (Priest), hence it is wrong to describe them as Sivachariars. The effect of the nirvana thikshai was that it destroyed their accumulated karma (^iQfdl^wsvib) and made them perfect (u<s@6nix>«nLjS6L>) to serve the Lord with absolute devotion and dedication without any other thought. The king to glorify them had established (^rrussriQQ^LU^sb) their images in stone in the prakara of the temple. The king treated them as bhaktas (ua>g>ir&6h) along with the nayanmars. 49 In Saiva religion there are two categories of officiating priests who are learned in the Vedas, Siva agamas, thirumurais and meikanda shastras. The first category of priests are recruited from the adi saivas of Dravidian origin, these priests officiate in Saiva temples, they are prohibited from performing funeral rites and post funeral rites. They should be married. They receive nirvana thikshai and acharya abishekam to function as officiating priests in Saiva temples. The second category are known as Saiva kurukals, they too receive nirvana thikshai and acharya abishekam to function as priests, they perform funeral rites and post funeral rites. They too should be married persons. They are selected from non adisaivas who are traditionally of vegetarian family groups observing Saiva traditions. CHAPTER - 5 SRI KRISHNA'S SIVA TfflKSHAI Sri Krishna it appears had failed to get himself initiated, but he had established a Sivalingam and was performing Siva pusai daily. One day the disciples of the great rishi Upamaniya munivar went and told him that flowers were scarce. He directed them to the place where the flowers used by Lord Krishna was dumped. These were fetched and with them the rishi performed his Siva pusa. Now this went on for sometime. Sri Krishna procured flowers from distant parts of his kingdom and used them in his pusai. The rishi then got those flowers fetched and used them anew in his devotion. When Lord Krishna came to know this through his servants was in great anger that the rishi was using flowers which were nirmalyam. (used flowers) The irate Lord Krishna went to the rishi and demanded explanation for the latter using once used flowers (nirmaliyam). The rishi calmly told Sri Jrishna that his pusai was not at all a pusai since he had not received Siva dikshai and his flowers could not therefore be considered as having been once used (nirmalyam). Sri Krishan is then said to have begged for and obtained initiation from Upamania munivar. Sri Krishana then began Siva pusai anew. Cholas were the greatest temple builders India had known their achievements in this field and sculpture both in bronze and stone attained unprecedented and unsurpassed height of skill and elegance during the reign of Rajarajan-1. Temples were built not only in their homeland but also in the conquered territories extending from Sri Lanka in the south to the river basins of Tungabadra and Godavari 51 and even as far as the Mahendra hills of Orissa in the north. The great ancient temple of Thiruketheeswaram was rebuilt in the elegant Chola style and it was renamed Rajarajeswaram by Rajendra Cholan- 1. He made several endowments and like the great temple of Tanjore directly administered it.N umber of temples were built at Polonaruwa by the Cholas. The building of Raja Rajeswaram of Tanjore and other great temples of stupendous proportion were all labour of love unlike the Pyramids of Egypt or the Taj Mahal of Agra in India where slaves and forced labour were used. The making of icons in Pancha Loga-gold, silver, copper, brass and tin tead was in the most advanced stages during the time of Rajarajah-1, when some of the exquisite and incomparable metal images of all time were cast. Adalvallan (Natarajah) is a masterpiece. At Thiruketheeswaram we have an elegant Somaskandar icon bearing the Chola stamp. All our fine arts prospered during the Chola period, this period of Cholas could be called the golden age of the Tamils. Rajarajan-1 had laid the foundation for a great empire. He had built large standing army and a powerful navy more than any other ruler in India. By his time the naval supremacy of the Chola had been well established in the Indian ocean and his reign culminated with the consequent conquest of Lakkadives - 12000 Islands off the western coast - Arabian sea. His Kingdom extended from Sri Lanka in the South to the basin of Tungabadra in the north and Mahendra Giri in the north east. A western Chalukya inscriptions at Hossur (Dharwar district of Karnataka state) avers that the Chola army which fought a bloody battle there under the command of his Son Rajendran- 1 against Satyasraya of the western Chalukyas consisted of nine lakhs of soldiers. The total strength of the standing army must have been considerably larger than this figure when we take into account of his engagements in other sectors such as Pandya country, Malainadu, Vengi and Sri Lanka. Note : * Vide kurmapuranam for the story on Sri Knshana receiving Siva Dikshai. Vide Periyapuranam - ''inir^sussr gj 6 usnrr a® ^snrouiir dSku icfr^jmsar (jpipGicaj sSW? 6meii006ii6sr \"-\"He who places his feet on the head of Madhavan, Yathava chief of Duwarakai\". 52 Rajarajan-1 lost his parents in his boyhood. In his formative age he came under the influence of the Dowager Queen Sembian Madevi, a grand aunt of his and his own elder sister Kundavi. They were both cultured and deeply religious devoted to Lord Siva. They were engrossed in listening to the singing of thevaram hymns in traditional pan isai. The ritual singing off thevaram is a practice of great antiquity. There is no way of knowing when exactly this practice began, but from the middle of the eight century A. D. there are inscriptional evidence of endowments having been made for this purpose. Pallava King Nandivarman 1 1 of the middle of the 8th century A. D. had made an endowment and it is found at Tiruvallam. During the reign of Parantaka-1 (Chola) three endowments could be traced, they were at Lalgudy, Thiruvavaduthurai and Andanallur.* Rajarajan-1 was a devotee of Lord Siva. His tutelary Deities were Natarajah of Chidambaram and Thiagesar of Thiruvarur. His spiritual mentor was saint Karur Thevar who was one of the galaxy of the Nine saints who sang thiruvisaippa and thirupallandu of the thirumurai hymns composed of twelve cantos. In the Thanjavur Rajarajaeswaram temple there is a painting marked PLC 10 of Rajarajan-1 and Karur Thevar. Rajarajan-1 's religious devotion took two forms. One was bhilding of temples and other was his desire to unearth the complete set of the thevara hymns which were in ola scripts. None of them were available in his kingdom. The devotion to Lord Siva and the Love for the thevaram hymns, he has inherited from his great grand aunt the Dowayar Queen Sembian Madevi and his sister Kundavi, royal ladies of great dignity. Rarajajan-1 prayed to Lord Natarajah and his prayers were answered forthwith, the thevaram hymns came to light through a miracle which brought him glory greater than his kingship. The discovery of hymns through Nambi Andar Nambigal and their Note : * Vide Middle Chola temples A. D. 985 -1070 S. R. Balasubramanian. * Vide Early Chola temples of S. R. B. 53 popularization by the King by the appointment of othuvars in large numbers to every temple, largest being to the Peria Udayar temple of Tanjore, was associated with a miracle popular in the history of Saivaism. By another miracle Rajarajan-1 through Madangasoodamani a descendent of Thiruneelakanda Yalpanar who accompanied in his yal to Sambandar when he sang the thevara Hymns, restored the original pann to the respective pathigams. He got Nambiandar Nambi to arrange into seven cantons; Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thirukovaiyar as the eighth canton. Both these miracles took place in the temple of Chidambaram. His great wisdom is equally seen here. Raja Rajan-1 caused the 8200 verses that comprised the new discovery from an underground chamber of the Nararajah temple of Chidambaram inscribed in a copper plate for the benefit of the posterity, more than the others. This was his greatest contribution to mankind. It was these hymns which inspired the construction of hundreds of Siva temples by him and his successors. These and his devotion to Lord Siva earned him the epithet \"Sivapathasekaran\". Rajendra - 1 Son of Rajaraja- 1 succeded his father to the Chola throne he was equally valourous and religious like his father. He got Nambiandar Nambigal to arrange Thiruvisaippa and Thirupallandu as the ninth canto. Thiruwanthiram as the tenth canto and the Thiruvalavudayar Pasurams, Karaikkal Ammiayar Hymns and his own hymns as the eleventh canto. Nambiandar Nambigal who was a school going lad during the period of Raja Raja 1 had flowered into manhood. He was an erudite saivaite scholar and an Arulalar. Rajendra- 1 built the great edifice Gangaikonda Chola puram. His devotion to, Sivaperuman and love to Thevara Hymns were similar to his fathers. Since the manthirams were seven Crores, the Thevarams were made into the first seven Cantos. Moreover Manthirams were eleven in numbers. Thirumarais were made into eleven Cantos vide- Thirumarai Kandapuranam of \"Umapathy Sivacharar.\" Subsequently the great Epic Periapuranam was sung at Golden Hall of Chidamparam in the presence of Nadarajah Peruman and the Assembly of the Monarch and Saivait Scholars and Devotees. The first syllable \"Ulakelum\" was prompted by Nadarajah Peruman. 54 Since it was undoubtedly an Arulalar's work it was assigned as the twelveth Canto of Thirumurai by the Monarch and the Assembly of scholars who formally approved and released it and recorded in Copper leaves. The first Canto of Panniru Thirumurai is the Thevaram of Gnanasambandar with the first hymn opening as \"Thodu-udaiya Sivan\" this along with \"Ukaram of Ulakelum represent the mona syllable of the \"PIRANAVA\" manthiram \"AUM\" (spib). This made the cantonisation as final and conclusive. CHAPTER -6 The next phase in the development of Saivaism is the composition of the Periapuranam of Sekklar, the Prime Minister of kulothungan 1 1, otherwise known as Anapayan. Sundarar thiruthonda thogai and Nambi Andar Nambigal's Thiruthonda anthathi were the precursors of the great composition Periapuranam. In Saivaism the worship of Sivan adiars' is as good as the worship of Lord Siva, hence the importance and relevance of Periapuranam as a sacred Saiva literature. Periapuranam is the twelveth and the final canto of the Panniru thirumurais.\" Periapuranam is the evidence of the pervasive influence of Saivaism into every state of Tamil society\". Saint Sekkilar entreated Lord Natarajah of Chidambaram and invoked His GRACE to make the composition. The Lord prompted the first syllable of the composition ('Ulakelam') of the invocatory verse - the first one. In the chamber 9 of the vimanam of the great temple of Tanjore in a panel, a marvellous painting of Rajarajan-1 and his three Queens worshipping Lord Natarajah of Cidambaram. In this Rajarajan-1 sports a kothu kondai and a beard and moustache and the pancha katcham tugged up to the knee. He looks young and tall and sprightly and majestic. Finally, so far as the Saivaite Hindu Temples are concerned what is applicable to them are the Siva Agamas and not the Vedas. Temples as religious Institutions were unknown to the Vedic period or did not form part of the Vedic form of worship. This view is supported by several eminent Sav"
