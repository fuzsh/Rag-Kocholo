You create Knowledge And light. You remove our sins. Please guide us into the right direction.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n-3-\n\nBeliefs of Hinduism Hindus believe in the Vedas and Aagamas. These are the world's most ancient scriptures, revealed by God. Hindus believe that the universe undergoes endless cycles of creation, preservation and destruction. Hindus believe in karma, where everyone’s destiny or future is a result of the choices and actions they make. Hindus believe that the soul reincarnates, taking many births until all karma has been resolved, attaining moksha, the state of no birth. Hindus believe that spiritual beings (souls) exist in unseen worlds. Hindus believe that temple worship, rituals and sacred rites create a spiritual connection with Devas (divine spiritual beings) and God. Hindus believe that all life is sacred so we must practise ahimsa, \"no harm\" to all life. Hindus believe that everyone must tolerate, understand, respect, help and love each other.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n-4-\n\nHindu Fesitvals and Celebrations\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n-5-\n\nThai Pongal\n\nThai Pongal is the harvest festival. It is held to thank the Sun and the cattle for the bountiful harvest every year. Pongal is celebrated on the 14th January. It is observed on the 1st of Thai month (in the Tamil calendar) which is in the middle of January. Thai is considered to be an auspicious month to hold weddings and other functions. It is a three day festival of nature worship. The main activity is the boiling over of a pot of milk followed by the cooking of the Pongal (a mixture of newly harvested rice, jaggery and dhal). There is a Tamil proverb that says ‘when Thai is born, a new way will be born’. On the day before Pongal, house yards are cleaned, very old things are discarded and replaced with new things and houses are repainted and decorated. On Thai Pongal day, everyone wake up before the sun rises, shower, wear new clothes and gather in front of the house. A flat, square pitch is made and decorated with kolam (designs in coloured flour). This kolam should be exposed to the Sun light. A fire wood hearth (stove-like) is set up using bricks or stands made of mud. A senior member of the family would begin by filling the pot (decorated with holy ash, sandal, kungumam, ginger, turmeric and mango leaves) with water and milk and then placing it on the stove while others worship the Sun and God. The climax is when the milk boils and spills out of the pot. This is a symbol of joy. Fire crackers are lit and everyone shouts ‘Pongalo Pongal’. Then the senior member of the family picks up raw rice with both hands, takes it round the mouth of the pot 3 times, while looking at the Sun, and finally places this raw rice into the pot to cook. The other members of the family will do the same. After the Pongal is cooked this rice and fruits are offered to the Sun. A banana leaf is used as the plate to hold the rice and fruits. All family members will say prayers and thank the farmers, Sun, nature and God. Finally the Pongal is served with fruits to family members and shared with neighbours, friends and relatives. It is a joyous occasion for the poor and rich Hinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n-6-\n\nfarmers. All villagers celebrate this harvest festival together irrespective of their religion.\n\n“Mattuppongal” is celebrated on the next day. The cattle that help the farmers to plough the fields, transport the goods and provide the milk are thanked. On this day the cattle are bathed and decorated. Turmeric and kungumam are applied on the horns of the cattle. Flower garlands, small bells and a garland of vadai are hung around their necks and they are paraded in the streets in India. This festival is also known as ‘Mahara Sangraanthi’. After decorating the cattle, freshly cooked Pongal is fed to them. The cows are regarded as the symbol of The Holy Mother (Goddess Shakthi).\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n-7-\n\nThaipoosam The Thai Poosam festival takes place in the month of Thai (Jan-Feb) on the day of the star Poosam, during full moon time. The popular myth or legend behind Thaipoosam is associated with Idumban and Murugan. Sage Agastya wanted to take two hills Sivagiri and Saktigiri to his place in the South and told his Asura disciple ldumban to carry them. On the orders Sage Agastya, ldumban carried the Sivagiri and Sakthigiri hills slung across his shoulders, one on each side. When he reached Palani feeling tired, he placed the hills down to rest.\n\nWhen ldumban restarted his journey, he found that he could not lift the hill. God Murugan had made it impossible for ldumban to carry it. Upon one of the hilltops the great Asuran spotted a little boy in loin clothes. Idumban demanded the boy to vacate the hill at once so that he could proceed with his task. The boy stubbornly refused. Idumban and the boy began to fight. In the battle ldumban was slain. Idumban’s wife pleaded with the little boy to forgive and free him and so ldumban’s life was restored. Idumban realized that the boy as none other than God Murugan. He sked for forgiveness requested God Murugan to allow for everyone to celebrate this day by carrying the kaavadi on their shoulders (signifying the 2 hills).\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n-8-\n\nIdumban also requested that he guard the entrance to the Palani hill. Hence we have the ldumban shrine half-way up the hill. Every pilgrim is expected to offer respect to ldumban before entering the temple of Dandaaudhapaani Swami. Since then, pilgrims to Palani bring their offerings on their shoulders in a kaavadi. The custom has spread from Palani to all Murugan temples around the world. Kaavadi bearers must have strict vegetarian food, must not drink any intoxicating drinks and must be in constant thought of God. Many of the Kaavadi bearers especially who do it as spiritual Sadhanaa, impose various forms of self-torture. Some devotees pass a sharp little spear through their tongue, which is made to protrude (thrust) out of the mouth. Others may pass a spear through the cheek. This type of piercing is done in other parts of the body also. These ‘Sadhanaas’ are performed to achieve the feeling of detachment from the body. The Kaavadi bearers enjoy high state of religious fervor. They dance in ecstasy (delight) and some appear to be possessed by a divine spirit.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n-9-\n\nSivaraathiri\n\nOne of the most ancient festivals in India is Sivaraathiri, meaning ‘night of Siva’ which falls on the new moon day of Feburary/March. On this night, God Shiva took the form of a huge column of infinite light, jyotirlingam (lingam of light). There is nothing to distinguish the appearance of this lingam, but it is believed that a person can see this linga as a column of fire piercing through the earth after he/she reaches a higher level of spiritual attainment.\n\nThere are several myths associated with the festival as to why Maha Sivratri is celebrated: 1. To remember the day God Siva took the form of the Jyotirlinga to settle a dispute between God Brahma and God Vishnu. 2. To commemorate the day on which Lord Siva consumed the deadly poison to save the world from destruction Devotees of God Siva stay awake through out the night praying. Siva temples are flocked by devotees, mostly women who perform traditional worship. The devotees abstain from eating and drinking for whole day and break their fast only the next morning, after the night worship. Poojas are performed through out the night in the temples. Maha Sivaraathri poojas is divided into 4 yaamams (sessions). 1. 6:30pm – 9:30pm 2. 9:30pm – 12:30am 3. 12:30am – 3:30am 4. 3:30am - 6:00am The well known story of the hunter illustrates the greatness of celebrating this night.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 10 -\n\nMaasi Maham Sivaraathiri and Maasi Maham festivals are the special Hindu festivals between 1st half of March and 2nd half of February (Tamil month Maasi).The star Maham is a powerful star among the 27 stars. The festival on Maham star in Maasi is said to be Maasi Maham. Maha Maham, also called day of Maamaangam, is celebrated only once in 12 years. This is because in the month of Maasi, when the sun, the full moon, the Maham star sign and Jupiter are aligned in a certain way, water in the Mahamaham tank at Kumbakonam (in India) is said to swell. On this day the nine holy rivers are believed to swell and meet at the Mahaamaham tank. The names of these Holy Rivers are Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswathi, Krishna, Godawari, Narmadha, Cauvery, Thungabadra and Sarayu. Pilgrims from all over the world flock to bathe (dip) in the Theertham (Holy water) in the Kumbakonam Kaasi Visvanaatha temple. They believe that realizing, asking for forgiveness and dipping in this tank will purify them. It is believed that many celestial beings (even Lord Brahma) have prayed for forgiveness for their sins by dipping into this tank. Also Dhaakshaayini, an incarnation of Goddess as daughter of King Dhaksha was born on this day, which is why Maasi Maham is celebrated throughout Shakthi temples.\n\nMahaMaha Tank at Kumbakonam. There are two holy theerthams (tanks) One tank is called MahaMaham tank while the other is called as Pottramarai tank at Madhurai.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 11 -\n\nMaha Utsavam ‘Maha’ means ‘great’ and ‘Utsavam’ means ‘festival’. This is an annual festival that is celebrated in Hindu temples between March and August. The festival usually lasts for 10 days. (The number of days may differ from temple to temple.) This festival gives an opportunity for all communities to involve themselves in hosting (upayam) a morning/evening pooja on one of the 10 days. This annual festival is expected to draw tens of thousands of devotees. Almost every Hindu will visit the temple for at least one of the Poojas.\n\nOn the first day the ceremony begins with the Kodi Etram (Flag Hoisting) to mark the beginning of the temple festival. For all 10 days, the morning and evening pooja involves the decorating of the deities, rituals, poojas to these deities, followed by the procession (carrying around) of the Utsavamoorthies, deities made of brass from the Vasantha Mandapam, within the inner court of the temple. The highlight of the festival will be the \"Ther\" (Chariot) festival which occurs usually on the 8th day in the morning. The temple bells will ring early in the morning, filling the area with a spiritual atmosphere. The \"Ther\" is taken round the outer-yard by hundreds of devotees, and accompanied by instrumental music and devotional songs. Many carry the kaavadi behind the ‘ther’ as a form of worship. Then the Utsavamoorthies are taken out from the chariot and placed in the Vasantha Mandapam where the final pooja, for the day, will be performed. The last day involves the Theertham or \"water cutting\" ceremony. The deities are immersed in the pond to mark the festival’s end. In the evening the flag is brought down after special pooja. Poongaavanam, which is also known as The Festival of Flowers, takes place the day after. This is to celebrate the Holy Wedding. This annual festival is concluded with an abhishekam and pongal to Lord Bhairawar.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 12 -\n\nPanguni Uthiram (The day of Celestial marriages)\n\nPanguni Uthiram falls in the month Panguni (March-April) when the Uthiram star and the full moon occurs together. It is said to be the time chosen for celestial weddings. On this day the well known celestial marriages took place: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nMeenakshi – God Shiva Devayanai - God Muruga Kamalavalli (Valli for short) - God Muruga Andal (also known as Kothai) – God Vishnu Sita and Rama (incarnation of God Vishnu) according to Valmiki Ramayana\n\nFrom Brahmanda Puranam, we learn that on Panguni Uthiram, every holy water joins Thumburu teertha (also spelt as Tirtha), one of seven sacred tanks in Tirupati Tirumala. The ancients chose Uthiram to convey to humans that it is for illustrating Grahasta Dharma (married life) that the Almighty manifests in the marital state despite their changelessness (no childhood, youth or old age). Devotees go to the temple at this time to see these weddings. This day is also the Jayanthi (day of Incarnation) of Lord Ayyappa\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 13 -\n\nHoli\n\nHoli is a joyful festival of colours and is celebrated on the full moon day which usually falls in the later part of February or March. It is celebrated in many parts of India, especially in North India. This festival is celebrated for two to three days. People pour coloured water on each other and cook many types of sweets and other eatables. Holi is celebrated in spring because it is welcoming spring. They also believe that it welcomes the New Year. There are many stories behind this festival Lord Krishna, the 8th incarnation of Lord Vishnu is also worshipped during the Holi festival. Putaki, the female demon was sent by the cruel king Kamsa to kill the child Krishna. But the infant Krishna destroyed her instead. Hence, bonfires lighted to celebrate the victory of Krishna. Holi, also known as Holika Dahan (death of Holika).The bonfires are lit in memory of the miraculous escape of young Prahlad. Hiranyakasip (the king of demons) had a son, Prahlad who was the greatest devotee of Lord Vishnu. Hiranyakasip wanted to kill his son. So he called his sister, Holika .She had a magic robe. This robe had the power to save the wearer from burning in fire. Hirnyakaship ordered his sister to sit on burning fire along with Prahlad. He thought that her sister would not be harmed by fire because of the magic robe and Prahlad would be burnt to death. But the result was the opposite Prahalad walked free. It is believed, no one can harm the person who has God as his savior. That day was celebrated with joyful colours to mark the victory of virtue and goodness over evil. This festival got its named ‘HOLI’ from this incident The spring season, during which the weather changes, is believed to cause viral fever and cold. So the playful throwing of natural coloured powders has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of Neem, Kumkum, Haldi, Bilva, and other medicinal herbs prescribed by Ayurvedic doctors\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 14 -\n\nHindu New Year\n\nHindu New Year is celebrated according to the Hindu calendar (Panchangam). The Hindu calendar is based on lunar months corresponding to the phases of the moon. The New Year usually falls on the 13th, 14th or 15th of April. The house and surroundings are cleaned several days before the New Year day. The elders of the family read the Panchangam to find out the times of the New Year. They also note the auspicious days and time for social visits and \"Kaivishesham\" (giving cash as presents). On the morning of New Year day, the householder and family have their ceremonial bath in specially prepared, medicated water and attend the poojas at the nearest temple. On returning home the whole family has a New Year meal consisting of milk-rice, delicious snacks and fruits. Then the head of the family gives Kaivishesham to the family, friends and employees. Several old customs are observed on this occasion. It is the time of great rejoicing and feasting, but above all, of family re-union.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 15 -\n\nRam Navami\n\nRam Navami is the celebration of the birthday of Rama, a divine figure in Hinduism. In the Ramayana, Dasharath, the king of Ayodhya, had three wives. They had no children, so they had no heir to the throne. Rishi Vasistha advised him to perform Puthra Kamesti Yagna, through which he could have a desired child. According to Guru’s advice, King Dasharath went to Maharshi Rushya Shrunga's ashram, to get him to perform the yagna. As the result of yagna, Yagneshwar appeared and gave Dasarath a bowl of Payasam and told him to give it to his wives. Dasharath gave one half of the payasam to his elder wife, Kausalya, and another half to his younger wife Kaikeyi. They both gave half of their portions to Sumithra, the youngest wife. After a few days, all three Queens conceived. On the ninth day (Navami) of April (first month in Hindu calendar), at noon, Kausalya gave birth to Lord Sri Ram, Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharath and Sumithra had twin boys, Lakshman and Shatrughan. Prince Ram and Lakshmana accompanied Viswamitra to the city of Mithila, the capital of King Janaka, where he married his daughter Sita after performing the superhuman act of bending Siva's bow (Siva Dhanu). Lord Ram, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, took the human form on earth when Adharma (evil) ruled over Dharma (good). He protects all his devotees by destroying the roots of Adharma. Lord Ram was born on earth to destroy the demon named Ravana. Celebrations begin with a prayer to the Sun early in the morning. At midday, when Lord Ram is supposed to have been born, a special prayer is performed. In northern India especially, an event that draws popular participation is the Ram Navami procession. The main attraction in this procession is a decorated chariot in which four persons are dressed up as Ram, his brother Laxman, his queen Sita and his disciple Hanuman. The chariot is accompanied by several other persons dressed up in ancient costumes. For the occasion, Hindus are supposed to fast (or restrict themselves to a specific diet). Temples are decorated and readings of the Ramayana take place.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 16 -\n\nChitra Pournami – Chitragupta Vrata (Full moon day in the month of April on the star of Chitra) The full moon of Chitra (April) month during the influence of Chitra star is particularly sacred to the Chitraguptas, the recording demi-gods of the Yama Loka (the abode of Lord Yamas). According to the Hindu mythology, Yama’s divine assistant, Lord Chitragupta, sends the soul of the deceased either to Svarga (Heaven) or Narakas (Hell) according to the nature of their sins. The terms of Chitragupta means “Hidden picture” representing the true picture of all our good and evil actions. The worship on this day is to remind us of the higher power that maintains a constant watch over every act of ours .This memory serves as an invisible check on our conduct. This is a powerful inducement to keep us in engaged in constantly doing good actions only. Pournami is a day dear to the mother. (Both full moon and new moon days are favourable for fore-fathers and mothers). On this day Uma Maheswarar Vratha is observed. Ancients believed that on these days the souls of our ancestors are resting in peace. The importance of the worship to the ‘Chitragupta’ is brought out in the following legend. Prahaspathy was the teacher of Indra (the king of demi-gods) Indra disobeyed his Guru. Then Guru gave up instructing Indra on what good deeds had to be done, and what should be not. During the period of Guru’s absence Indra did many evil deeds. When Guru resumed his duty again, Guru told Indra to undertake a pilgrimage for the wrong actions he had done in Guru’s absence. When Indra was on his pilgrimage, suddenly he felt the load of sins taken off his shoulders at a place near Mathurai in South India, and he found a Sivalingam there. The miraculous incident made him build a temple and perform the worship of the Lingam, The God Himself caused Golden Lotuses to appear in a near by pond. Indra was greatly pleased and blessed. The day on which Indra worshipped the God was Chitra Pournami. So he constructed another temple at that spot. That spot is Mathurai Meenaakshi Temple in South India. On this day in Mathurai annualy ‘Devendra Pooja’ continues to be performed.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 17 -\n\nSathya Naaraayana Vrata\n\n‘Satya’ means truth. ‘Naaraayana’ is a name of ‘Vishnu’ In the Hindu tradition ‘Sat’ means ‘Truth’ or Pure Being –it is considered the highest Reality; Satyanarayana Vrata reminding us all names and forms, refers to the nameless, formless God. In Hinduism the term ‘vrata’ denotes a vow or religious practice to carry out certain obligations with a view to achieve divine blessing for fulfillment of one or more desires. In Hindu mythology, Naarada Rishi was a Triloka Sanchari—the one who moves about in the three worlds. When he once visited the earth, there was great misery. He was unable to find a way to relieve human suffering. He approached Lord Naaraayana and related to Him the sad state on earth. Lord Naaraayana said to Naarada, to ask the people to observe the Satya Naaraayana Vrata in the evening of Shankranti or full moon day and hear the story of Satya Naaraayana, and that all miseries will come to an end. Rishi Naarada there upon returned to earth and preached the glory of the Satya Naaraayana Vrata. Many observed the vrata without taking any food during the course of the day and attained what they desired. All were happy and prosperous.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 18 -\n\nPradhosha Vrata\n\n(Holi Kailash & Manasarova lingam in Nepal in pradhosha pooja) Pradhosha occurs twice a month. One is during the growing or waxing moon period and other during the waning moon period. This denotes the meeting of the Sun and the Moon in a Horizontal Line. The Pradhosha worship is to be done in the evening just after sun set on the thirteenth day of each lunar fortnight.

Soorapathman responded by putting all devas in prison and treated them like prisoners. . The Devas turned to God Siva for help. As no one in the world could destroy Soorapathaman, God Siva needed to create a powerful person to punish him. So He opened His 3rd eye releasing Agni (sparks of fire) which passed through the 3 elements (space, air then water - the Ganga river) finally landing on the Saravana Poikai, a pond in a reed (type of grass) forest.

On noticing the peculiar behavior of Subramaniya Iyer who was a temple priest, he inquired the other priests about the individual. One said that he was a madman while another explained to the king that Subramaniya Iyer was only a devotee of Goddess Abhirami. Seeking to know the truth himself, Serfoji approached the priest and asked him what day of the month it was i.e. whether it was a full-moon day or a newmoon day. Subramaniya Iyer, who could see nothing else but the shining form of the Goddess, wrongly and rudely argued with the king that it was a fullmoon day. The king rode off informing the former that the death sentence would be declared if the moon did not appear in the sky by six in the night. Immediately realizing his mistake, Subramaniya Iyer is believed to have lit a huge fire and erected a platform over it supported by a hundred ropes. He sat upon the platform and prayed to the Goddess Abhirami to save him. He cut off one rope after another after completing each verse of his prayer. These hymns form the Abhirami Anthadhi. On completion of the 79th hymn, he saw a vision of Goddess Abhirami who threw Her earring into the sky which shone as a bright light (like the moon) upon the horizon. The king and crowd were amazed. Overcome with ecstasy, Subramaniya Iyer composed 22 more verses in praise of the Goddess. The king repented his mistake and immediately cancelled the punishment. He also gave him the title of \"Abhiraami Pattar\" meaning \"priest of Goddess Abhiraami\".

It has two major parts: Thiruvaasakam and Thirukkovaiyaar. Thiruvaasakam is the collection of all the songs that were sung during the entire life of Saint Maanickavaasagar. \"Thiruvaasakaththukku Urukaathaar Oru Vaasakaththukkum Urukaar” .This means” those who do not melt at hearing Thiruvaasakam, will not be able to melt for any other songs”. Thirukkovaiyaar was sung by Saint Maanickavaasagar before he attained Saayujyam (mukthi). One day God Siva went to Maanickavaasagar in the disguise of a Sivaachaariyaar (Brahmin priest) and asked him to sing the Thiruvaasakam and Thirukovaiyaar while he wrote it down to study it. Maanickavaasagar agreed to do it. The Sivaachariyar wrote the hymns and left them lying on the temple steps and disappeared. Other Brahmin priests of Thillai found these and it was signed at the end as ‘Maanikavaasagar repeated this, Thiru Chitrambalam wrote this’. The other Brahmins wanted to know the meaning, so asked Maanikavaasagar, who took them into the temple and pointing to the Natarajah statue ‘This Thillai Nataraja is the purport of these stanzas. He is the meaning of them ’.

While he was travelling, on the way he heard the Kirtanai in a garden at Tirupperunthurai. There he saw a Siva Yogi, seated under a tree. At once he was attracted by the look of the Siva yogi and surrendered to his feet. Immediately Sivayogi revealed “Namachivaya” the Panchakshara manthiram in his ear.Lord Siva gave him the name “Manickavasagar He of the gem of the words” and blessed him the wisdom of Saivaism Maaninckavaasagar dedicated his life to Lord and built a Siva temple with all the money that the King had given to buy horse. When the King came to know his activities and asked him to get back. Lord Shiva gave a diamond to Manickavasagar to give to the king, promising to bring horses on Aavani Mulam day. The king didn’t believe him and put him in jail. On the morning of Aavani Mulam, Lord Siva came in the form of a groom and brought the horses, but that night itself they turned into foxes and started to disturb the whole town. The king became really angry and punished Manickavasagar by making him stand in a dry river bed under the hot sun.\n\n.After this incident, he dedicated his life to the Lord and built a Siva Temple with all the money that the King had given to buy Lord Shiva made the river to flood to save His devotee.

Lord Siva made everyone else feel the pain of the beatings, the king realised God’s Divine play and released Manickavasagar and begged his forgiveness. Maanickavaasakar travelled around the Tamil Naadu, and reached Chidamparam. In history that a Buddhist ruler from Sri Lanka (Ceylon),heard about Maanikkavaasakar, also arrived at Cidambaram, with the hope of getting him to perform a miracle, that would restore the power of speech to his mute (incapable of speech-dumb) daughter.

The ruler from Sri Lanka, requested Maanikkavaasakar, to perform a miracle and restore his daughter's power of speech. Maanikkavaasakar's prayers caused the princess to speak, and also she answered every single question that had been raised by the Buddhist scholars. At Chidambaram, Lord appeared as a Siva Yogi before him, in order to write down the Thiruvaasagam and Thirukkovaiyaar that he had composed. When He had finished, the Lord placed them on the steps of the Chit Sabha and disappeared.\n\nThillai moovayiravar (Priests) asked Manickavasagar the meaning of the songs.

So at the young age of five he understood the power of God and followed the Vedas. One day Visarasarmar was walking through the meadow and he saw the herdsman hitting a cow with a rod, heavily. He couldn't bear this so immediately stoped the herdsman hitting the cow and decided to look after the cattle by himself. He looked after them with so much love that they gave plenty of milk. He distributed the milk to the appropriate owners and temples. Visarasarmar, while looking after the cows, decided to build a Lingam. Every day he would praise the Lingam and perform Poojas (abhishekam) using the milk. The villagers noticed this and believed that he was wasting the milk. They decided to complain to Visarasarmar’s father. One day the father went to the meadow and found his son worshiping the Lingam with the milk. Unable to understand his young son’s devotion, he became angry because of the waste of milk and hit Visarasarmar several times on his back. But Visarasarmar in deep thought, concentrating on his pooja and could not feel the pain. This made his father even angrier and he then kicked the milk pot that Visarasarmar was pouring on the Lingam. Visarasarmar was furious and could only see this act of this father as a sin against God. He immediately grabbed the nearest object and threw it at his father as a punishment and continued with his pooja. This object ended up being an axe which cut through his father’s legs, throwing him to the ground. Immediately Visarasarmar saw the Supreme light and a vision of the form of God Siva and Sakthi. He heard a voice saying “You punished even your Hinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 48 -\n\nfather for My service. Now I am your father. All offerings from the devotees to me will also belong to you and here after you will be called ‘Chandeswarar’\". Then the forms of God Siva and Sakthi embraced young Visarasarmar, who merged with this Supreme light and disappeared. His father’s soul attained Moksha because of this son’s devotion to God. By age, Visarasarmar was very young, but he showed the world the meaning of complete devotion and service. Following the words that were uttered by God to Chandeswarar, the last pooja in every temple is dedicated to Chandeswarar.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 49 -\n\nSeckilaar-Periyapuraanam\n\nSekkilaar was one of the greatest poets of Tamil literture.He was a 12th century poet.

As a minister of the state Seckilaar had access to study from stone carvings, plate engravings, above all he was able to know the histories through his knowledge due to the grace of God. He wrote about their lives in poetic form.

He started on his journey southwards, praying at holy temples. Nearing the outskirts of the village Chaththanur of Cholanadu, he saw a herd of cows in great distress. Their herdsman (idayan) by name Moolan had died on the banks of the river and the cows were in grief. The Yogi realizing that the cows would be consoled only if Moolan came alive, so he used his yogic powers to transmigrate his soul to the body of Moolan, and hid his own body nearby and the cowherd Moolan rose as Thirumoolar.

She did not know what to do so she prayed, asking for help from God. Immediately a mango appeared in her hand. She went outside and gave that to her husband. When he tasted the mango he was surprised at how tasty it was. He knew that this was not the mango he bought so ask her where she got this from. Ammaiyaar could not hide the truth any more so she told him what had happened. He didn’t believe her story so asked her to pray and get another mango for him.

The rishi invested him with the sacred thread. Markandeya learnt the Vedas and Sastras easily. Every one liked him. As the boy was getting on to be sixteen, Rishi Mrikandu became sadder and sadder. One day Markandeya asked his father the reason for their sorrow. The father said that the blessed son would live only sixteen years. You are now about to reach that age.

Then the Siva-Linga burst open and God Siva came out of it, and said, “Yama, go away! Don’t touch this boy. He is my beloved devotee. He will live for ever!” Yama went away. Markandeya then prayed to God Siva with greater emotion than ever. This prayer says at The end of each line, “What can Death do to me?” Many people recite this prayer even now.

He spent most of his time fixing the musical instruments of Athanur temple. Right from his young age, he was devoted to Lord Siva. Once he took some members of his caste to Thiruppunkur to see the pooja performed for the Shiva deity in the shrine. As they were untouchable they all were standing outside the temple. However, the Nandhi was obstructing their view from seeing this pooja. So Nandhanaar prayed and pleaded to God to see this pooja. Then a miracle happened where the Nandhi statue (which is made of stone) moved so that Nandhanaar and others could have His dharshan. This can be seen in this temple today, where the Nandhi is not located at the usual centre position. Nandhanaar was always talking and making plans to worship Shiva at the temple in Chithambaram. He kept telling every one that he would go tomorrow (‘naalai povean naalai povean’) so his nick-name became Thiru Naalai Povaar. Once he asked permission from his master to go to Chithambaram. His master refused his request and ordered him to take care of sowing seeds and prepare the fields for harvest. Nandhanaar was sad and prayed that night.

Narada is a travelling monk with the ability to visit distant worlds (lokas in Sanskrit). He carries a musical instrument known as a vina which he uses to accompany his singing of hymns, prayers and mantras as an act of devotion to his lord, Vishnu or Krishna. In the Vaishnava tradition Naradar is the first living being discribed inthe Puranic universe. He is regarded as the Triloka sanchaari, who roams the three lokas of Swargaloka (heaven), Mrityuloka (earth, literally: \"place of death\") and Patalloka (netherworld). He does this to find out about the life and welfare of people. He was the first to practise Natya Yoga. He is also known as Kalaha priya as he playfully causes quarrels amongst Gods (devas), Goddesses and people. Narada Muni has a specifically important place among the Vaishnava traditions.

They were great devotees of Lord Subramanya., They had a child, after a long time. It was very heavy so, they named him Thinnanar.\n\nThinnanar was Arjuna in the previous birth, according to Thiru Kalahasthi Puranam. When he went to worship Siva, to get Pasupatha Astra, and when the Lord came to him as a hunter, Arjuna did not recognize Him. So, he had to be born as a hunter again and worshiped the Lord, before attaining final liberation Thinnanaar was educated according to the hunters’ customs. He became a good archer. Even when he was young, his father retired, and crowned him king. One day, Thinnanaar went out hunting. A pig escaped from its net and was running away. Thinnanaar followed it accompanied by two others, Naanan and Kaadan. The pig was tired and stood near a tree. It was quickly killed by Thinnanaar. They were tired and thirsty. They proceeded towards the Ponmukali River. Thinnanaar wanted to climb the nearby mountain. Naanan followed him, saying that in the Kaalahasthi hill, there was Lord Kudumithevar (God with a Tuft) temple. Kaadan was busy cooking the pork\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 60 -\n\nWhen he began to climb the hill, He felt that a great burden was being lifted off his shoulders. He was losing body-consciousness. As he saw the Lord there, he felt supreme love and began to shed tears of joy. He felt that the Lord was lonely there, and he should stay with Him. He thought that the Lord might be hungry and though he was reluctant to leave the Lord alone, he quickly came down the hill to fetch some food for the Lord. He tasted and took the best pieces of the pork for Him. He filled his own mouth with water from the river and gathered flowers which he wore on his head. He took the pork, bow and arrow and went up the hill again alone this time. At the temple, Thinnaanar poured the water from his mouth, which was his ‘Abhishekam’. Then he decorated the Lingam with the flowers he had brought on his own head. This was his ‘Archanai’. He then placed the pork before the Lord. He went out and stood guard for Him, at the entrance, in for the fear of wild animals should hurt Him. In the morning again he went out to hunt and bring fresh food for the Lord. When Thinnanaar left the temple in the morning to get food for the Lord, Sivagochaariyaar, the temple priest, came there for the usual customary worship. He was horrified at the polluted state that some unknown person had done in the temple. He was well versed in the Agamas (rituals of Siva-worship). He performed the necessary purification rites and took bath again and began his formal worship. He brought water in a holy pot, with a bandage around his own mouth to prevent the breath of his mouth should pollute it. He brought fresh flowers in a holy basket. He brought fruits and sweets, newly made and unpolluted by anyone tasting it, before offering it to the Lord. He went home after the worship. Thinnanaar returned with fresh meat. He removed the priest’s decorations, and did the worship in his own way, and then as usual, stood guard at the entrance. This went on for five days. The priest was greatly upset about the pollutions of the holy place. He appealed to the Lord to stop it. Lord Siva wanted to show to Sivagochaariyaar the nature of Thinnanaar’s supreme devotion. He commanded him in a dream, to hide himself behind the Lingam, when Thinnaanar went to the temple the next day, and watch what took place. On the sixth day, Thinnanaar went out as usual for getting the Lord’s food. While returning, he saw many ill omens, which made him feel that something had happened to the Lord: He ran towards the Lord. He was grieved to see blood coming out from the Lord’s right eye. He treated the eye with herbs what ever he knew. Still the bleeding did not stop. A simple idea occurred to him: ‘flesh for flesh’. At once, with his own arrow, he took out his own right eye, and fixed it over the right eye of the Lord. The bleeding stopped. He was very happy. When he was dancing with joy, he noticed that the Lord’s left eye had begun to bleed. But, he had already found out the remedy. There was Hinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 61 -\n\nonly one problem: how to locate the eye of the Lord, when his own eye had been pulled out. So, Thinnanaar placed his foot at the place where the Lord’s left eye was on the Lingam, and began to pull his left eye out, with his arrow. Lord Siva appeared and held his hands shouting 3 times ‘Stop Kannappa!’ to stop from plucking his other eye. Lord Siva took him with both hands and returned Thinnanaar’s eyes. Sivagochaariyaar understood the true nature of Thinnanaar’s love and devotion. Thinnanaar then came to be known as Kannappar. True Bhakti is far superior to pure ritual. Thinnanaar’s readiness to pluck out is own eyes for GOD’S sake is total self-surrender or Athma-Nivedhana, the highest peak of devotion which immediately reveals the Lord in all His glory.\n\nHinduism for Juniors Part II\n\n- 62 -\n\nPrahalada\n\nPrahlada is famed for his exclusive devotion (bhakti) to Vishnu, Despite several warnings from his father Hiranyakashipu, Prahlada continues to worship Vishnu.

Holika, the sister of Hiranyakashipu, had a special shawl that would prevent fire affecting the person wearing it. One day, Hiranyakashipu ordered Prahlada to sit on a pyre on the lap of Holika. Prahlada prays to Lord Vishnu to keep him safe. When the fire starts, Holika burns to death, while Prahlada remains unharmed. This incident is celebrated as the Hindu festival of Holi. After tolerating much abuse from his father Hiranyakashipu, Prahlada was eventually saved by Vishnu in the form of Narasimha, (half-man, half-lion). The story of Prahlada gives a number of moral instructions such as:     \n\nGod exists everywhere. God will always save his devotees. Devotion can be practiced at any point of time.
