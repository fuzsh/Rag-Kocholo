        "text": "2.1.18. The Cruel Sceptre\n\n551 Than one who plies the murderer’s trade, more cruel is the king Who all injustice works, his subjects harassing. The king who gives himself up to oppression and acts unjustly (towards his subjects) is more cruel than the man who leads the life of a murderer.\n\n552 As ‘Give’ the robber cries with lance uplift, So kings with sceptred hand implore a gift. The request (for money) of him who holds the sceptre is like the word of a highway robber who stands with a weapon in hand and says “give up your wealth”.\n\n553 Who makes no daily search for wrongs, nor justly rules, that king Doth day by day his realm to ruin bring. The country of the king who does not daily examine into the wrongs done and distribute justice, will daily fall to ruin.\n\n554 Whose rod from right deflects, who counsel doth refuse, At once his wealth and people utterly shall lose. The king, who, without reflecting (on its evil consequences), perverts justice, will lose at once both his wealth and his subjects.\n\n555 His people’s tears of sorrow past endurance, are not they Sharp instruments to wear the monarch’s wealth away? Will not the tears, shed by a people who cannot endure the oppression which they suffer (from their king), become a saw to waste away his wealth ?\n\n556 To rulers’ rule stability is sceptre right; When this is not, quenched is the rulers’ light. Righteous government gives permanence to (the fame of) kings; without that their fame will have no endurance.\n\n557 As lack of rain to thirsty lands beneath, Is lack of grace in kings to all that breathe. As is the world without rain, so live a people whose king is without kindness. 69\n\n558 To poverty it adds a sharper sting, To live beneath the sway of unjust king. Property gives more sorrow than poverty, to those who live under the sceptre of a king without justice.\n\n559 Where king from right deflecting, makes unrighteous gain, The seasons change, the clouds pour down no rain. If the king acts contrary to justice, rain will become unseasonable, and the heavens will withhold their showers.\n\n560 Where guardian guardeth not, udder of kine grows dry, And Brahmans’ sacred lore will all forgotten lie. If the guardian (of the country) neglects to guard it, the produce of the cows will fail, and the men of six duties viz., the Brahmins will forget the vedas.\n\n2.1.19. Absence of ‘Terrorism\n\n561 Who punishes, investigation made in due degree, So as to stay advance of crime, a king is he. He is a king who having equitably examined (any injustice which has been brought to his notice), suitably punishes it, so that it may not be again committed.\n\n562 For length of days with still increasing joys on Heav’n who call, Should raise the rod with brow severe, but let it gently fall. Let the king, who desires that his prosperity may long remain, commence his preliminary enquires with strictness, and then punish with mildness.\n\n563 Where subjects dread of cruel wrongs endure, Ruin to unjust king is swift and sure. The cruel-sceptred king, who acts so as to put his subjects in fear, will certainly and quickly come to ruin.\n\n564 ‘Ah! cruel is our king’, where subjects sadly say, His age shall dwindle, swift his joy of life decay. The king who is spoken of as cruel will quickly perish; his life becoming shortened.\n\n565 Whom subjects scarce may see, of harsh forbidding countenance; His ample wealth shall waste, blasted by demon’s glance. The great wealth of him who is difficult of access and possesses a sternness of countenance, is like that which has been obtained by a devil. 70\n\n566 The tyrant, harsh in speach and hard of eye, His ample joy, swift fading, soon shall die. The abundant wealth of the king whose words are harsh and whose looks are void of kindness, will instantly perish instead of abiding long, with him.\n\n567 Harsh words and punishments severe beyond the right, Are file that wears away the monarch’s conquering might. Severe words and excessive punishments will be a file to waste away a king’s power for destroying (his enemies).\n\n568 Who leaves the work to those around, and thinks of it no more; If he in wrathful mood reprove, his prosperous days are o’er! The prosperity of that king will waste away, who without reflecting (on his affairs himself), commits them to his ministers, and (when a failure occurs) gives way to anger, and rages against them.\n\n569 Who builds no fort whence he may foe defy, In time of war shall fear and swiftly die. The king who has not provided himself with a place of defence, will in times of war be seized with fear and quickly perish.\n\n570 Tyrants with fools their counsels share: Earth can no heavier burthen bear! The earth bears up no greater burden than ignorant men whom a cruel sceptre attaches to itself (as the ministers of its evil deeds).\n\n2.1.20. Benignity\n\n571 Since true benignity, that grace exceeding great, resides In kingly souls, world in happy state abides. The world exists through that greatest ornament (of princes), a gracious demeanour.\n\n572 The world goes on its wonted way, since grace benign is there; All other men are burthen for the earth to bear. The prosperity of the world springs from the kindliness, the existence of those who have no (kindliness) is a burden to the earth.\n\n573 Where not accordant with the song, what use of sounding chords? What gain of eye that no benignant light affords? Of what avail is a song if it be inconsistent with harmony ? what is the use of eyes which possess no kindliness. 7 1\n\n574 The seeming eye of face gives no expressive light, When not with duly meted kindness bright. Beyond appearing to be in the face, what good do they do, those eyes in which is no well-regulated kindness ?\n\n575 Benignity is eyes’ adorning grace; Without it eyes are wounds disfiguring face. Kind looks are the ornaments of the eyes; without these they will be considered (by the wise) to be merely two sores.\n\n576 Whose eyes ‘neath brow infixed diffuse no ray Of grace; like tree in earth infixed are they. They resemble the trees of the earth, who although they have eyes, never look kindly (on others).\n\n577 Eyeless are they whose eyes with no benignant lustre shine; Who’ve eyes can never lack the light of grace benign. Men without kind looks are men without eyes; those who (really) have eyes are also not devoid of kind looks.\n\n578 Who can benignant smile, yet leave no work undone; By them as very own may all the earth be won. The world is theirs (kings) who are able to show kindness, without injury to their affairs, (administration of justice).\n\n579 To smile on those that vex, with kindly face, Enduring long, is most excelling grace. Patiently to bear with, and show kindness to those who grieve us, is the most excellent of all dispositions.\n\n580 They drink with smiling grace, though poison interfused they see, Who seek the praise of all-esteemed courtesy. Those who desire (to cultivate that degree of) urbanity which all shall love, even after swallowing the poison served to them by their friends, will be friendly with them."
