        "text": "This volume is a study of the beginning and evolution of temple architecture in India which covers sculptures and carvings as well. With over a hundred plates of temples and carvings on them including cave facades and pillar depictions it deals with temples constructed by the different ancient and medieval dynasties in Indian history particularly the early western Calukyan and later western Calukyans Pallava Pandya, Cola Hoyasala and Nayaka with illustrations that include maps plans of caves and even viharas and caityas it undertakes a study of the temples found in different states of India. The research discusses the variations in plans and elevations to examine development of temple architecture over time and new experiment actions in the building of temples by use of various materials. Reconstructing art and architectural styles from the remnants of the ruined temples in many places it explains terms and concepts in temple building and architecture and cites examples of various temple style and traditions including the best and earliest ones. The focus is on the Dravida and Nagara temple styles and a third hybrid form of sikhara that developed in the Deccan. Many Jaina temples are also covered.\n\nThis handbook is a comprehensive study of the archaeology, social history and the cultural landscape of the Hindu temple. Perhaps the most recognizable of the material forms of Hinduism, temples are lived, dynamic spaces. They are significant sites for the creation of cultural heritage, both in the past and in the present. Drawing on historiographical surveys and in-depth case studies, the volume centres the material form of the Hindu temple as an entry point to study its many adaptations and transformations from the early centuries ce to the 20th century. It highlights the vibrancy and dynamism of the shrine in different locales and studies the active participation of the community for its establishment, maintenance and survival. The illustrated handbook takes a unique approach by focusing on the social base of the temple rather than its aesthetics or chronological linear development. It fills a significant gap in the study of Hinduism and will be an indispensable resource for scholars of archaeology, Hinduism, Indian history, religious studies, museum studies, South Asian history and Southeast Asian history.\n\nThe decline of the Gupta Age by the end of the 6 th century witnessed the birth of a paramount power in north India under the Vardhanas of Thaneswar. Harshavardhana, the prominent ruler of this dynasty, however, for most part of his life ruled from Kannauj. Soon after them, i.e., by the second half of the 7 th century, smaller kingdoms emerged in north, central and northwestern India. These royal houses played a very important role in the further development of Nagara style of temple architecture which was introduced by the Guptas in the 5 th-6 th centuries. The major dynasties that flourished at different periods of time between 7 th and 11 th centuries, and which gave immense patronage to temple building activities, were the Gurjara-Pratiharas (8 th-11 th century), the Kalachuris (8 th-13 th century), the Paramaras (9 th-14 th century), the Solankis (10-13 th century) and the Chandellas (10 th-13 th century). They, individually and collectively, contributed greatly to the growth of the Nagara architectural tradition but with regional variations. The early Pratihara temples at Gwalior, Gyaraspur and Baroli in Madhya Pradesh show various stages of the development of central Indian temple architecture. For example, the Teli-ka-Mandir (c. 9 th century) dedicated to Sakti cult at Gwalior, is the oldest Pratihara temple in this region (Pl. 31). It has a rectangular mula-prasada (mula means 'root', 'original', etc., the main shrine where deity is consecrated) with the oblong sikhara or spire. It is also significant to note that here the Dravida style of sikhara penetrated somewhat strangely in this heartland of India at this early stages. The topmost part of the sikhara has the barrel-vaulted or wagon-top roof called sala sikhara-the reminiscent of the Dravidian order. The stepped-pyramidal roof, also called as 'Phamsana roof', built above the porch, is also peculiar to this early temple in this region. The sides of the temple wall have three projections with intermediate recessions. Rudimentary form of 'Latina' sikharas (sikharas resembling 'sugar loaf' mass), kudu window arches and lotus medallions decorate the exterior. From this simple style of architecture developed Latina mula-prasadas with pradakshina-pathas, balconies with chajjas or overhanging eaves, mandapas or halls with open vedika (railing) for free transmission of air and light. The Phamsana, or gable roofs, were adorned with purna-kalasa or padma-kumbha capitals or finials fixed along the long axis of the gable roof. The later Pratiharas further developed the mula-prasada and its superstructure. The basic elements of the north Indian temples are found in these temples (Figs. 33, 34, 35a, 35b & 36). This development can be seen in the temples of Baroli and Gyaraspur in Madhya"
