        "text": "Meykandar (13th century AD) also known as MeykandaDevar, was a great shaiva saint and scholar. He had rendered a famous devotional work called as Siva Jnana Bodham which tells the importance of the shaivism sect and features the greatness of Lord Shiva. His appearance closely resembles similar to Lord Muruga. His birth name was Swethavana Perumal.\n\nSome of the excerpts from the Holy Text, Sri Sivagnana Botham are as follows:-\n\nI. We humans are being created, protected and destructed by Lord Shiva, and this happens in our life, for a certain cause.Those who get relieved from the worldly bondages would consider Lord Hara (Shiva) is the only source of attaining eternal happiness in the world.\n\nII. Lord Shiva is the one who mingles with our souls. He can be realized by us through supreme devotion. He can be easily reachable based on our sincerity.Those who deeply involve themselves in the spiritual thoughts on Lord Shiva would be relieved from their bad Karmas, and there after their life would blossom like the freshly blossomed lotus flowers.\n\nIII. Don’t consider your physical body as your body, since actually the owner of the body is Lord Shiva only.Consider both happiness and sorrows as alike. Put all of your troubles on to the shoulders of our divine father Shiva.Let Lord Shiva be present on our soul forever.\n\nIV. Our soul is not meant for putting garbage on it. It has to be cleansed every day by doing regular prayers, puja and meditation on Lord Shiva.\n\nV. Worldly pleasures which we enjoy today would not happen for tomorrow also, since human life is subject to full of changes. Hence always enjoy spiritual pleasures in your life, let your organs also chant the glory of Lord Shiva, and let the entire universe recite the Shiva Mantra, “OM NAMAH SHIVAYA”.\n\nVI. Impossible things can be made into possible by worshipping Lord Shiva. Believe that with the grace of Lord Shiva, even an ant can become an elephant, and an elephant can be changed in the form of a small ant.\n\nVII. The things which present in the world are highly perishable, and we are expected to die on some day, nothing is permanent in this world, except Lord Shiva, hence try to concentrate more and more attention on worshipping Lord Shiva.\n\nVIII. Lord Shiva appears in the form of Guru Dakshinamurthi, and gives silent explanation about wisdom, knowledge and bhakti to the sages who were once surrounded with him. God can be approached only in the form of a Guru, and hence, Lord Shiva has taken the form of Guru Dakshinamurthi in order to spread the spiritual enlightenment among the noble ones.\n\nIX. The soul is the main cause of our happiness and sufferings, hence try to build a temple for Lord Shiva on your soul, and perform regular pujas to him on your mind temple. Adorn him with flowers, flower garlands and chant the Divine Mantras and names of Lord Shiva.Let our soul attains the highest purity, and let it reach the Lotus feet of the Lord.\n\nX. As the lord becomes united with our soul, thereafter we would be relieved from our pains and sufferings and at the appropriate time we would also get salvation through the grace of Lord Shiva.\n\nXI. As the soul becomes more pious, all the things in the world appear to be in the form of Lord Shiva, and even we would also appear in the form of Lord Shiva, “OM SHIVA SHIVA”.\n\nXII. We have been gifted with eyes only to see the divine beauty of Lord Shiva, our tongue must recite the Shiva MANTRA, our nose must be utilised to smell the divine Prasad of Lord Shiva, we must purify our blood by consuming the Holy Shiva Prasad, our ears are given to hear the songs of Lord Shiva, hands are given to us in order to bow it before the deity of Lord Shiva, our legs are given in order to visit the temples of Lord Shiva, our soul must be filled with the image of the holy Shiva lingam, our sensual organs must be kept under control, even our flesh, nerves and bones must praise the glory of Lord Shiva. In total, we have to utilise our entire body towards propagating Shiva Bhakti amongst the masses."
