        "text": "Trade and commerce are played a vital role in Ancient Tamilagam (Present Tamil Nadu & Kerala). The early Tamil classical literature and the works from the west like Historia Naturalis mentions about the export of beads, iron and steel and potteries from South India to the Roman Egypt and other Western Countries. The Roman literature mentions that the beads and steel imported into Rome from peninsular India was subjected to duty in the port of Alexandria. The archaeological excavations conducted in various places at present Tamil Nadu and Kerala established a firm datum line for the beginning of iron. The iron and steel furnaces from Kodumanal besides a cast Iron foundry at Guttur revealed the technological skill attained by the early smelters in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThis study focuses attention on the history of the Sriwijaya Kingdom which is the oldest kingdom in the Malay Land and is considered as the kingdom with the greatest maritime power in the middle of the 7th century. As a former large empire, the inscriptions of the Sriwijaya Kingdom were valued by many researchers as very little compared to the kingdoms on Java. This makes it difficult for researchers when going to explore the traces of the history of standing and traces of his government. The expansion of the entire archipelago territory by the Sriwijaya Kingdom was not only in the context of expanding the territory but also had economic motives and controlled the international trade routes. This study also discusses the economic development, civilization, and the process of entry of Islam in Sriwijaya until the emergence of an Islamic political entity that came to be known as the Palembang Darussalam Sultanate."
