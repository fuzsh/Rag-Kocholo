Nagendra THE BASIC UNITY OF INDIAN LITERATURES India is a vast country of many languages : Panjabi, Hindi and Urdu in the North-West; Oriya, Bengali and Assamese in the East; Marathi and Gujarati in the Central- Western regions and Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam in the South. There are, besides, several other languages which are as significant both from the literary and the philological points of view —for example, Kashmiri, Dogari, Sindhi, Konkani and Turn etc. Each one of them — especially each one of the former twelve languages, has its own treasure of literature which is extremely valuable from the point of view of literary quality, variety, volume, as well as antiquity. If we were to amass at one place the literary wealth of only the modern Indian languages, it will be as vast as the entire literature of Europe collected together : with the treasures of Vedic Sanskrit, Sanskrit, Pali, the Prakrits and the Apabhramshas superadded, the volume transcends our imagination — an ocean of Knowledge surges before us deeper than the Indian Ocean, vaster than the geographi- cal dimensions of India, loftier than the summits of the Himalayas and subtler than the conception of the Spirit, Each literature has a sharp individuality stamped with the characteristics of its own region. The regions of Panjabi and Sindhi and of Hindi and Urdu are so mixed up, yet their individual character cannot be mistaken. The social and cultural life of the Maharashtrians and the Gujaratis is so common, yet can these two literatures be confused ? Similarly, the four South Indian languages come from the same stock — they are all Dravadian languages, yet can there be any mistake between Tamil and Kannada or between Telugu and Malayalam ? The same is the case with the languages of Eastern India : Oriya and Assamese are deep-laden with Bengali, yet they have fully absorbed INTRODUCTION it in their textures and who can, for a moment, question their inde- pendent status ? AH these literatures have their own unmistakable distinctive merits : the Sangam literature of Tamil, the Avadhana and Udaharana literature of Telugu, the Sandesh-Kavya (Message- Poetry) and the Kilippatu (Parrot-Songs) as also the Mani-pravalam style (mixed style interwoven with Sanskrit and Malayalam) of Malayalam, the Pawaras (a form of the heroic ballad) of Marathi, the Akhyan and Phagu of Gujarati, the Bargeet and Buranji literature of Assamese, the ballads and poetical romances of Panjabi, the Ghazal of Urdu and the Riti (a kind of rhetorical erotic poetry) and Ghhayavad Schools of Hindi Poetry are some of the special features of the various Modern Indian Literatures which are remarkable in themselves. Yet possibly this distinction is not of the essence. Just as Indian culture is one inspite of a vast multiplicity of religions, ideologies and modes of living, in the same way it is not difficult to discover the essential unity of Indian literature in the variety of languages and media of expression. In a way, this fundamental unity of Indian literature is in no way less impressive than its enor- mous variety and vastness. It will be interesting to analyse here the basic elements of this Unity. To start from the beginning, except Tamil in the South and Urdu in the North almost all the modern Indian languages emerged more or less within the same period of Indian history. The earliest known poet of Telugu is Nannaya who flourished in the 11th cen- tury of the Christian Era, the first available work of Kannada is the ‘Kavirajamarga* written by King Nripatunga (814-877 A. D.) of Rashtrakuta dynasty and the oldest classic in Malayalam is the ‘Ramcharitam’ which, inspite of all its problems of language and date of composition, is believed to be a work of the 13th century A. D* The origin of Marathi and Gujarati is almost contempora- neous : the first literary work in Gujarati is the ‘Bahubali Rasa’ of Bharateshwar dated 1185 A, D. and the earliest specimens of Marathi are found in the Yadava literature of the 12th century. The same is the story of the Eastern languages — the ‘Charyageet' of tttHtODuCTtON iii Bengali had its origin possibly between the 10th and the 12th cen- turies; the earliest writings of the Assamese language beautifully re- presented by the ‘Prahlad-charit’ and the ‘Har-Gauri-Samvad* of Hem Saraswati belong most probably to the later half of the 13th century; in Oriya also the oldest specimens of satirical poetry and folk-songs were definitely available in the 13th century and in the 14th century flourished the great Utkal-Vyas — Saraladas. Similarly, in Panjabi and Hindi also, we have a continuous literary activity since the 11th century A. D. Only two languages are exceptions — Tamil which is as old as Sanskrit (although the Tamil scholars claim it to be of even earlier origin) and Urdu for which the earliest limits can be the 15th century at the most. ^ Besides their origins, the stages of evolution also of our langu- ages have a striking similarity. The first phase almost in all cases comes up to the 15th century, the earlier half of the Medieval Period in Indian Literatures ends with Moghul glory, i.*?., -about the middle of the 17th century and the later Medieval Period closes with the establishment of British rule which marks the beginning of the Modern Period. Thus the literary histories of most of the modern Indian languages are divided into four epochs which run parallel more or less in each literature. The reason for this parallel development is quite obvious — namely the political, social and cultural history of the nation. All these languages have flourished against a common background. Inspite of some gaps, India has had for the past several centuries a fairly common political set-up. Under the Moghuls, of course, there was a cU>se political and social contact between the North and the South which continued even after the dissolution of the Moghul Empire. Attempts were made for territorial expansion even earlier and although the Rajputs did not succeed in building up an All- India empire, yet the different provinces of the country were being ruled by various Rajput dynasties and thus the system of administra- tion was almost the same though the ruler was different. So also, there was a basic unity in the systems of government set up by the Muslims all over the country. This unity was later on established on firmer grounds by the British who set up a central form of govern- IV mTfcOfctJCTtoN ment. For these and other reasons the political conditions in the various linguistic states of India have been quite similar. The cultural unity of the country has been still greater and more deep-rooted. During the past thousand years, India has seen many a religious and cultural movement which swept over her entire geographical dimensions. After the disintegration of Buddhism, an interfusion of some of its sects with those of Shaivism and Shaktism gave birth to the Nath cult which was spread over the whole country near about 1000 A.D. — upto Tibet in the North, in the regions of Eastern Ghats in the South, in Maharashtra in the West and almost everywhere in the East. Although they laid greater emphasis on Yoga, yet the intellectual and emotional aspects of religion were not neglected by these sects of mendicants who com- prised the Naths, the Siddhas and the Shaivites — all, in their fold; and a number of them adopted the medium of poetry for self- expression and for the propagation of their beliefs. Thus, almost in every part of India, these hermits contributed to the growth of the majority of modern Indian languages in their earlier stages. They were succeeded by the Saint poets and the Muslim Sufis who influenced the social and religious life of India on a very wide scale. The Saint poets derived their inspiration from Vedanta — they practised and propagated a cult of devotion to the Absolute God. The Sufis also believed in an Absolute God but their medium of communion was love : although their stronghold was in the North- West India and in the Eastern regions, yet in the Bahmani State and in Bijapur and Golkunda as well, they had their centres and many a Sufi saint came from the South. Thereafter, started the Vaishnava movement which swept over the whole country with great velocity. Several forms of worship of Ram and Krishna with all their delicacies enchanted the devout and the whole atmosphere resounded with the music of devotional songs. The Muslim culture was also shedding its influence : the elements of the Iranian civiliza- tion with its love of luxuriance and ornament were being rapidly absorbed in the Indian pattern of life and a new court culture was evolving. Its richness was, however, soon lost in the general political and economic depression leaving a kind of sickly eroticism in its itoTkdDUOTibrt V wake. Then came the Western traders who brought with them Western manners and customs and who were quietly followed by Christian missionaries. In the later half of the 19th century, the British Empire had been established in India and the ruling class started propagating in a planned manner their civilization and culture and indirectly their religion also. This direct contact and conflict between the East and the West gave birth to modern India. Now, take the literary background. Although all the langu- ages of India do not belong to the same stock, yet their literary inheritance is common. The Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Puranas, the Bhagvata, classical Sanskrit literature, i.e ., the works of Kalidas, Bhavabhuti, Bana, Sri Harsha, Amaruka and Jaideva etc., the Buddhist and Jain literature in Pali, Prakrita and Apabhramsha — all this wealth has been inherited by all our languages alike. In philosophy, the Upanishads, the six schools of philosophy, the Smritis and in poetics many a classic such as the Natyashastra, the Dhwanyaloka, the Kavyaprakasha, the Sahityadarpana and the Rasagangadhara etc., have directly or indirectly influenced the thought-content of the Indian writer in every language. These have been really the perennial sources of inspiration for all the Indian literatures and their influence has gone a long way in bringing the Indian literatures together. Thus, there is an inherent unity in the Indian literature as a whole which has flourished against a common socio-political, cultural and literary background ever since its birth. An investigation into these common features will bear fruitful results. * The first trend which is common to most of our major langu- ages is the Nath literature. The Nath and the Shaivite mendicants have made a valuable contmbution to the development of the earlier phases of most of our literatures. Obviously, there was much greater activity in this field in the North-West and the East than in the South. In the South, Shaivism, of course, was very popular, but the attitude of the Shaivite poets there was more emotional than metaphysical or mystical. The abnormal Yogic practices influenced by Shaivite philosophy were not quite in vogue there-— a purely VI INTRODUCTION devotional attitude towards Shiva prevailed. The Nayanmars of Tamil, the Palkuriki poets and their successors in Telugu and the leaders of the Vira-Shaiva cult like Basaveswara and others in Kannada were different in spirit from the Nath and the Siddha poets of the North : the Southern poets were pure devotees whereas those in the North were mystics engaged in abnormal practices. Yet the influence of the Nath cult had infiltrated far in the South as is borne out by works like the Navanath-charitram of Telugu. In Bengali and in Marathi, the Nath school of poetry was a great force. In Marathi, Gorakhnath himself wrote his book ‘Amarnath-Sanvad': another major Nath poet of Marathi was Gaininath. Bengal, of course, was the stronghold of the Nath cult : the Nath litera- ture is obviously the richest in Bengali both in quality as well as in quantity; the literary creations under the inspiration of the Sahajiya cult and the semi-philosophical songs — ‘the Charyageet’ — were also mixed up with it. In the Assamese and the Oriya languages, there was hardly any sustained literary activity in this line although the impact of the Nath movement was unmistakable on both. The second citadel of the Nath cult was the Panjab. Whereas in Bengal it flourished in communion with the Buddhist movement, in the Panjab it was deeply influenced by Islam in general and by Sufism in particular. The historians of Panjabi literature trace their beginning in the writings of Gorakhnath and Charpat Nath. Some of their contemporary Muslim mendicants, like Farid and others, also contributed to its growth. The authors of this peculiar class of Panjabi literature were called Gurus, Naths, Siddhas, Pirs and Babas. This same stream flowed into Hindi as well — perhaps deeply coloured by Panjabi : actually it is today difficult to distin- guish between the Hindi and the Panjabi of that age. A number of verse and prose compositions of the Nath hermits are available in Hindi. Thus there is a widespread current of the Nath litera- ture flowing through most of the major languages of India. The second main trend in the earliest literature of modern Indian languages is the heroic poetry — and this also is a common trend. Heroic poetry in Tamil had its beginnings in the Sangam Era (500 B.C. — 200 B.G.). Some of the narratives in the ‘Patithup- INTRODUCTION vii pattu* are valuable specimens of heroic-cum-bardic poetry. For example, the ‘Porunaratruppadai* or ‘The Story of the Commander* was written in the glory of the king of Karaikala. The poet sings here of the fertility and the industrial as well as agricultural re- sources of the Chola State constantly fed by the everflowing streams of the Kaveri as also of the wisdom and valour of the ruler. The fourth narrative ‘Perumpanatruppadai' sings of the ruler of Kanchi and the ‘Padhitruppathu’ is a collection of eulogies of the kings of Chera dynasty by several poets. The famous epic of the Sangam Era — the Silappadhikaram — also is a work of heroic poetry. The author was the son of the Chera Emperor and he had become a mendicant in his later life The popular heroic poem — the ‘Palnati Vir Gharitram* of Telugu — is a remarkable specimen of this kind of poetry. Written in popular speech, this poem narrates in a force- ful and elevated style the glorious achievements of the heroes of Palnad (Guntur). The earliest poetic collection in Malayalam — the ‘Pajaya Pattukal’ — contains many heroic ballads; Percy Mcqueen has collected a large number of bardic folk-songs written in old Malaya- lam. The medieval heroic narratives of Marathi and the ‘Pawaras* (a ballad form of heroic poetry) also fall within this category. These bards have sung of the glorious deeds of their patron-rulers and heroes. Some of the earlier Gujarati poems like the ‘Ranamalla- chanda’ by Shridhar and the ‘Kanhad-de Prabandh' by Padmanabha are invaluable treasures of Indian heroic poetry. In Panjabi, Guru Govind Singh has composed some immortal heroic poems, but his ‘Chandi-Kavya’ and other works don’t really belong to this category of heroic poetry, which is, as I have hinted above, more or less bardic in character. The later poets of Panjabi did write in praise of the Sikh heroes and martyrs a number of bardic poems which are scattered here and there. In Hindi, an entire period is called the ‘Heroic* or the ‘Bardic Age’; such poetry was written in Hindi not only in the first half but also in the later half of the medieval ages. The ‘Prithviraj-Raso 1 and a number of other Raso-works written be- fore or after and the hcroical ballads like the ‘Alha-khand’ in the earlier period and the works of Bhushan and Sudan etc. in the later period occupy a place of honour in the history of heroic poetry of INTRODUCTION our country. They have their counterparts in Urdu also where poets like Anis and Dabir made a handsome contribution in their own way* Mystic Poetry is another major tendency of our literature and there have been mystic poets of very much similar character in almost all the languages of our country. The ‘Eighteen Siddhars’ of Tamil were saints who wrote mystic poetry in simple language. In Telugu, we have Vemana and Virabrahmam and in Kannada Sarvajna and others, who are all major poets of this school. The mystics of Marathi are, of course, very well-known. Saint Jnandeva and his follower Namdeva of the Malianubhava cult, many a saint of the Warkari Panth and the great Eknath etc., have written philosophical poetry of a high order under the inspiration of Vedanta. This creative activity continued for centuries and Marathi language possesses an enormous treasure of mystic poetry rich both in quantity as well as quality. In Gujarati, the writings of Akho in the 17th century and of several other saint poets like Sahajanand, Pritam Das etc. are equally mystical in character. These poets raised their voice against the orthodox Vaishnava sects — specially against the luxurious religious practices prevalent in the Vallabha sect which was so popular in Gujarat and stressed the efficacy of simple and pure life and of genuine love for God and for humanity. The Baul songs of Bengali were also written in the same vein : they occupied a prominent position in the literary history of Bengal in the 17th and 18th centuries. They expressed the common religious beliefs of the Hindus and the Muslims in simple and natural language. Their authors were saint poets who lived in villages or nearabout — away from the pleasures of life : they had renounced the World and had drunk deep at the fountain of Divine Love. The Kangha poet Bhimabhai revived this trend in Oriya in the 1 9th century. On the whole, however, the Mystic School of Poetry gained maximum momentum in the North-Western languages in Hindi, Panjabi and Urdu. Constantly enriched for centuries by great seers and poets like Nanak Deva and other illustrious Sikh Gurus as also by a large number of saint-poets — both Hindus and Muslims — Panjabi contains a vast treasure of such poetry. Similarly, the mystic school in Hindi is well represented by Kabir, Nanak, INTRODUCTION IX Dadu, Sundardas and many others : the stream flowed clear and massive from the beginning of the 15th right upto the 19th century. The Urdu poets also, writing under the influence of Sufism, made their own contribution which is adequate in quantity and rich in quality : really speaking the two trends of medieval poetry that Urdu shares fully with other modern Indian languages are the mystical lyrics and the philosophical romances. We now come to the long chain of romances which is also spread over the entire range of Indian literatures. It is a matter of pleasant surprise that themes of these romances in almost all the languages of the country are so very similar : almost the same leg- ends have been poeticized in different languages with some local variations. The romances in Telugu like the ‘Rajasekhara-Vilasam’, ‘Prabhavati-Pradyumnam*, ‘Kalapurnodayam’, ‘Chandramatiparina- yam% ‘Rasikjanmanobhiramam’ and ‘Chandralekhavilasam’ are rich in poetry and also in theme. The series of romances in Gujarati are still richer. In old Gujarati, Asayat wrote ‘Hansawali’ in 1371 A.D., Bhim wrote \\Sadayavatsa-Katha* in 1410 A. D. and Hiranand's romance ‘Vidyavilasini* was written two decades later. In the 16th century A. D. such poems became all the more popular and a number of high-class poetic romances such as ‘Nandbattisi* of Narpati, *Madhavanal-kamkandala' dogdhak (1528 A. D.) of Ganpati, ‘Hansavati-Vikramcharit-vivah’ (1560 A. D.) of Madhusudan Vyas, ‘ Dholamaru-chaupai , (1561 A. D.) of Kushal-Labh and *Rupchandra-kunwar Rasa’ (1581 A. D.) were composed within less than half a century. In the eighteenth century Samala made valuable contribution by adding to this series Padmavati (1718 A.D,), ‘Sudabahoteri* (1 765A.D.),‘Vinechand~ni-barta and Madana-Mohana* etc. In Bengali, the poetic romance centred round the love-story of Vidya Sundar and several poets headed by Bharat Chandra wrote poetic narratives based on this self-same theme. About a century earlier, some Sufi poets had adopted the themes of Hindu life for their mystical romances : Syed Alaol of the court of Arakan had translated into Bengali Jayasi’s famous classic — the Padmavat — which served as a source of inspiration to many works of this type. This current was ajl the more powerful in the languages of the North- X INTRODUCTION West and there are long series of romances in Panjabi and Hindi. The major romances in Panjabi are : Yusuf-Julekha Gopi Ghand Sassi-Punnu Chandarbhaga Hir-Ranjha Sinhasan-battisi Dhol-Sammi Betal Pachchisi Shirin Farhad Sorath Vija Laila Majnu Padmani Rup Basant Salbahan Gul Sanobar Urvashi Kamrup-Kamlata Tilottama Bahram Gor Ukha Chandarbadan Mear Bharat hari Hatim-Tai Devayani Puranbhagat Sundaran Bajmati Nal Damayanti Mrigawati Rasalu Kokiia Sakhi Sarwar Sefulmuluk Sohani Mahiwal Mirja Sahiban Rora-Jalali Khera-Sammi Suleman Balkis Gugga Chitrawali Of these, the Hir of Waris Shah is the richest — both in poetic quality and in romantic luxuriance. A number of other poets also — Damodar and Mukbil before him and Hamid, Abdul Hakim, Mohammad Muslim, Budha Singh, Ahmad Yar, Hasan and others after him wrote romances of a higher order and each one of them has its own merit. In Hindi, such poetry is still richer in quality as well as in quantity. About fifty poetic romances have already been discovered in Hindi and I am sure there are many more scattered about. Here, the Padmavat of Jayasi tops the list, of course, it may perhaps claim the highest rank among the romances of the Indian languages : in the art of plot-structure and in the richness of pathos, it excels even the Hir of Waris Shah. Of the rest, ‘Madhumalti’, ‘ChitravalP, ‘Gyandeep’, ‘Hans-Jawahir’, ‘Anurag-bansuri*, 'Dhola- maru-ra-doha\\ *Beli Krisna-rukmini-ri', ‘Ras-Ratan\\ the four versions Qf ‘Madhavanal-Kamkandala', ‘Rupmanjari’, 'Bisaldev-RasoyPrcnp INTRODUCTION xi PayonidhP, ‘Puhupavati* and ‘Nal-Daman* deserve special mention. In Urdu also, there is a series of romances — masanavis as they are called — which deal with spiritual or sensual love. They were written primarily by the poets of the South right from the beginning of the 17th century — Mulla Wajahi wrote Kutub-Mushtari in 1609 A.D*, Ghabbasi wrote ‘Saifulmulk aur Badi-ul-JamaP and ‘Tutinama’ (1639) based on Shuk-Saptati and Mir Taqi and Mirza Shauq made handsome contributions. They were followed by ‘Phulban’ of Ibn Nishati, c Man Lagan* of Bahari and ‘Ratan-o-Padam* of VVali Vellori. The Urdu poets in the North also tried their hand at romances. But quite often their tone was different. In place of the simple joys and sorrows of love of popular Indian life, the northern poets brought in Persian sophistication and their romances were essen- tially ornate and classical or pseudo-classical in character : the masanavis of Mir Hasan and Daya Shankar ‘Naseem* possess all these traits. Thus, we find a chain of romances of very much similar themes spread throughout India from Multan to Andhra and from Gujarat to Bengal. The most powerful trend of Indian literature is, however, the Vaishnava poetry which dominates almost all the major languages of the country .^Devotion is a vital element in Indian religion and as such there has been a vast treasure of devotional literature in almost all our languages from the very beginning. This element is still richer in the languages of the South where devotional writing began much earlier also. In Tamil the famous collection of the devo- tional songs is the ‘Nalayirappirabandham’ which consists of 4000 songs written by twelve Alwar devotees. Of these Thirumangai Alwar and Nammalwar possibly wrote the largest number of songs and poetess Andal was distinguished for the intensity of her emotion. In the later Medieval Age (1200-1750 A. D.) Pillaipperumal Ayyangar was a great Vaishnava poet whose ‘Ashta-Pirabandhnam* is a remarkable work of Vaishnava poetry. In Telugu both the branches of Vaishnavism namely the Rama cult and the Krishna cult inspired great poetry — there are more than 150 long poems based on the story of Rama. The well-known musician and poet Tyagaraja has defeated all his compositions to Rama. The ear- XII INTRODUCTION liest Ramayana in Telugu is the Ranganatha Ramayana which was written in the later half of the 13th century; the Bhaskara Ramayana and the Ramayana by Buddha Reddi also are equally important. Later on Kummari Molla wrote the famous Ramayanam which is not only large in volume, but is also very popular in Andhra on account of its poetic merit, simple style and charming descriptions. The most outstanding work of the Krishna ites is the ‘Bhagwatam' by Bammera Potana which is not inferior to its original in Sanskrit in poetic richness although it is primarily based on the same work. In the Prabandha Period (1500-1750 A.D.) the ‘Parijatapaharanam’ of Timmana was a rare achievement. In the Telugu literature of Madura the < Satyabhama-santwanam , and the ‘Radhika-santwanam/ which was written much later by poetess Muddupalni in the deca- dent age, are lovely poems of the Krishna cult. In Kannada, Vaish- nava literature covers one full era — the third era in the history of earlier Kannada literature is called the Vaishnava Era. Although some of the earlier epics of Kannada are based on the life-stories of Rama and Krishna, yet they don't come within the category of Vaishnava poetry. Real Vaishnava poetry is found in the countless prayerful songs of poets like Purandara Das and Kanaka Das who belonged to the 1 7th century A.D. These songs exercise a vital influence on the cultural life of Karnatak even today by virtue of their rich emotional content and popular lyrical style. The Ram- yana and the Bhagwata were also translated into Kannada by several devout poets in this era. The first available work of Vaishnava literature in Malayalam is the ‘Krishna-Gatlia’ of the 15th century. This poem deals with the whole life of Krishna — there are in all 47 episodes which depict all the phases of Krishna's romantic life in a charming manner without ever losing their poetic fervour. Although normally, the poet has delineated all the sentiments with success, yet he excels in the portrayal of love — erotic as well as maternal. The ‘Krishna Gatha’ was followed by ‘Bhasa-BhagwatamYHarinam- Kirtanam’ and a number of dramatised versions of Krishna’s life like the ‘Krishna-nattam’ and others. The tradition of Rama-Kavya in Malayalam was even earlier : the ‘Ramacharitam' of the Tamil School and‘ICannassa Ramayanam’ of the Niranam poets are rejn^k* INTRODUCTION xiii able works on the subject. Yet the greatest achievement in the field is the ‘Adhyatma-Ramayana’ by Eluttaccan. Whereas Valmiki has portrayed Rama as a great man and a noble ruler, Eluttaccan has deified Him like Tulsidas and has offered prayers to Him with feelings of warm devotion. Of the various Champu-poems (mixed poems), the Ramayana-Champu is the best and among the dramatic poems, the ‘Rama-nattam* occupies the highest position. In Marathi, Eknath wrote his short poetic narratives and devotional ‘abhangas’ under the direct influence of the Bhagwata cult and diffused an at- mosphere of spiritual bliss over contemporary literature. After him, Vaishnavism found an extremely effective exponent in Tuka Ram whose songs (the abhangas) cast a spell all over the Maharashtra region. It was, however, on Gujarati and on the languages of the East, namely on Bengali, Assamese and Oriya that Vaishnavism showered its choicest blessings. Gujarati like its sister language Brajbhasha excels predominantly in Krishnaite poetry — its poets like Narsi Mehta, Bhalana, Nakara, Vishnu Das, Premananda and others occupy a prominent place in the galaxy of the Vaishnava poets of India — poets like Narsi, Bhalana and Premananda occupy the same rank as Ghandi Das, Surdas and Nand Das. Their poetry is an invaluable album of the richest pen-pictures of colourful episodes of Krishna's life. One could pay as glowing tributes to the Krishna- Kavya of the Eastern languages — especially of Bengali. Although a poet like Ghandi Das had enriched Bengali litera- ture before the advent of Chaitanva, yet after Chaitanya the move- ment gathered tremendous momentum and all the poets of Bengali —nay of Oriya and Assamese as well — were completely soaked in the ‘Madhura Ras\\ The poetic literature which was written dur- ing a century and a half after Chaitanya under his direct inspiration can be divided into two categories : (i) biographical, and (ii) lyrical. Of his contemporary lyricists who drew their inspiration from and followed Chaitanya, Murari Gupta, Narahari Sarkar, Vasudeva Ghosh and Ramananda Basu were chiefly notable and among the multitude of poets who flourished after them, Jnana Das, Govinda Das, Lochana Das, Balrama Das and Shekhara (Kavi Shekhara, Ray Shekhara) occupy a prominent position by virtue of the quan- XIV INTRODUCTION tity of their work. Then, there was the Vaishnava Sahajiya sect for which love was the means and the end both : although it sometimes looks like a branch of Vaishnavism, yet in reality it was a successor of the original Sahajiya sect. According to them, every man in his ‘essential’ personality is Krishna and so also every woman is Radha. The devotee has to realize in himself or herself Krishna or Radha first — and then through their union he or she can achieve the state of eternal love or eternal bliss. The poets of this sect have composed thousands of songs and written a large number of technical treatises on the subject. Thus the Vaishnava literature in Bengali was dominated by poets of the Krishna cult. Yet the contribution of the Ramaites was not quite insignificant : the Ramayana of Krittibas Ojha by itself is a work of rare merit. The major poets of the Ram cult in Assamese are Madhava Kandali, Shankar Deva and Madhava Deva who composed the Assamese Ramayana in the l4th- 15th century A. D. The other work of Madhava Kandali — ‘Devajit’ — bears evidence of his devotion to Krishna, wherein he sings of the superiority of Krishna over other incarnations of Vishnu. In the 15th century, Shankar Deva composed his ‘Kirtans’ and his disciple, Madhava Deva compiled and edited them under the title of ‘Sanyukta-kirtan-ghosha' having added his own songs to it. This kind of song is called the ‘Bargeet’ which is a form peculiar to Assamese poetry. Generally, these songs cover all the aspects of Krishna’s life, but their main theme is the childhood of Krishna and in this respect they can compare favourably with the compositions of Brajbhasha poets on the same subject. In Oriya also, the Krishna cult was equally popular and Oriya poetry was so deeply soaked in the ‘Madhura Ras’ of Chaitanya that the historians of Oriya litera- ture today are not prepared to consider it as an unmixed gain. The main poets of this sect are Dinakrushna Das, Abhimanyu Saman- tasinhar, Kavisurya Baladeva, Bhaktacharan and Gopalkrishna who flourished between the 17th and 19th centuries of the Christian era. These poets have written passionate lyrics to express their devotional experiences and delineated the romantic events of Krishna’s life in colourful language. Among the Ramaites, the greatest was Balrama Das whose Ramayana occupies a unique iNTkODtJCTIOrt XV position in Oriya literature. Urdu and Panjabi are, however, exceptions in this respect. Although in Urdu as well, one could name a few poets who have written about Rama and Krishna — not only the Hindus but also some of the Muslims like Nazir Akbarabadi have written poems of devotion to Krishna — yet such poetry is insig- nificant both in quantity as well as in quality and does not really agree with the spirit and genius of Urdu poetry as such. Similar is the case with Panjabi. The Panjab was first under the influence of Islam and then Sikhism, which believed in an Absolute God, became the popular religion there, with the result that not much scope was left for Vaishnavism. Although the great Sikh Guru Govind Singh himself has written on the life of Rama and Krishna, yet it lacks the true Vaishnava spirit. Among the languages of the North-West, Hindi, of course, possesses an immensely rich treasure of Vaishnava poetry. Poets of almost all the Krishnaite sects wrote profusely in Brajbhasha. Besides the poets of Vallabha Sampradaya, who had their stronghold in Braj, the poets of other sects also such as the Nimbarka, the Gaudiya and the Madhwa made valuable contribu- tions. The Radha-Vallabh Sampradaya of Hita Harivansha and several other sects which based their philosophy primarily on Eros wrote passionate poetry on the erotic life of Radha and Krishna. The poets of the Ramaite cult had their stronghold in the regions of Oudh. The greatest Hindi poet in this field was, of course, Tulsidas who possessed a mighty genius and a universal poetic vision. From all points of view — devotional fervour, philosophical profundity and poetic wealth — Tulsidas reigns supreme. There are two major currents in Hindi Rama-kavya : one emphasises the moral aspects of life under the influence of Tulsidas and the other revels in the gaie- ties of life and depicts Rama as a romantic hero and although the first note is predominant by and large, the second also is not entirely insignificant. Thus, taken as a whole, the medieval Indian litera- ture is dominated by Vaishnavism and within Vaishnava poetry itself the Krishnaites hold the field. In this context, one is naturally reminded of the dramatic literature in Indian languages wherein the note of basic unity is still mote remarkable. The folk-drama based on the life of Krishna XVI INTRODUCTION and several other legends of mythology was very popular in the medieval ages and existed in every language in one form or the other. The self-same folk-drama assumed the form of Yakshagana in Telugu and Kannada, Attaktha in Malayalam, Lalit in Marathi, Yatra in Bengali and other eastern languages and of Rasa in Gujarati and Hindi. Here it is not the similarity of the theme, but the similarity of the form and the style which is really amazing : in all these forms of the Indian folk-drama we come across the same luxuriance of lyrical element, the same lack of action, and the same religious or pseudo-religious motifs. Hereafter begins the modern age in which the lines of develop- ment are all the more identical. In almost all the Indian languages, the modern age begins with the first stiuggle for India’s freedom in 1857 or nearabout. The impact of Western civilization was felt in the South and in Bengal a little earlier than in the central and North-Western regions, but the dawn of the Modern Age in India is marked not so much by the contact as by the conflict with the Western civilization — in other words by theYise of political cons- ciousness in India and as such the Modern Age in all the Indian languages covers more or less the same period. During these hundred years from 1857 to 1957 A. D., there are five clear phases of literary development : (a) renaissance (b) national-cultural awakening (c) romantic revival (d) socialistic consciousness under the influence of Marxian philosophy and (e) the dawn of Freedom. With some difference of time, all these trends can be easily discerned in the various literatures of modern India. In Tamil, the leader of the Renaissance was Ramlinga Swamigal who made a successful effort through his writings to revive the glory of ancient Indian culture and evoke a broad outlook by emphasising the unity of the various castes and creeds. He was succeded by Subramanya,Bharathi who was a mighty exponent of Indian nationalism in all its aspects — social, political and cultural. Chidambaram Pillai and V. V. S. Iyer who were active patriots of those days added vigour to the growing nationalist forces in Tamil literature. Although Tamil literature has always attached great value tb tradition, yet herein too, the Communist movement did INTRODUCTION xvii cast its spell and poets like Bharathidasan have expressed in quite sharp tones the feelings of popular emancipation* The leader of the Renaissance movement in Telugu was Viresalingam : his contribu- tion which is large in volume and varied in form, is in essence inspired by the new cultural awakening in the country to which he made a handsome contribution in his own way. G. V. Ramamurti and Gurzada V. Apparao gave this cultural awakening further impetus and started the modern Telugu movement. In the first quarter of the 20th century, poets like Rayaprolu Subbarao lent romantic splendour to Telugu poetry and in the fourth and fifth decades Srirangam Sriniwasarao and Dasarathi brought into Telugu literature a feeling of sharp social consciousness under the influence of Communism. In Kannada, the modern age was ushered in with the establishment of the Karnataka Vidya-vardhaka Sangha in 1890 when its founders who had all received Western education launched a scheme of translating into Kannada important works of English and Sanskrit. This gave them an opportunity to review and revive the past in new light. The movement gathered momentum from the Non-cooperation campaign of Mahatma Gandhi and a number of patriotic poets such as Srikantayya, Govinda Pai, Bendre, Sankara Bhat infused new vigour into life and literature. Almost simultane- ously Kannada poetry was touched by the golden rays of Tagore's romantic genius and Puttappa and Gokak wrote beautiful lyrics under his influence. For about two decades these two currents flowed in full swing ; thereafter, the impact of Marxian philosophy was felt by the authors of Kannada also and Krishna Rao, Karanth, Niranjana and a few other younger poets voiced the sentiments of the exploited masses with great gusto. So also in Kerala— the region of Malayalam, modern education had begun to show its effect in the middle of the 19th century. Classical works from English and Sanskrit were translated to cope with the growing needs of education. The Renaissance movement in Malayalam was led by Kerala Varina, Venmani and A, R. Raja Varma* The nationalist sentiment found its fullest expression in the later works of poet Vallathol who has written on all aspects of our national glory and condemned social &nd economic inequalities with passion. The harbinger of the xvni INTRODUCTION romantic spring in Malayalam was Sankara Kurup who was joined by Krishna Pillai whose pastoral elegy 'Ramanan* won phenomenal popularity* By about 1936 A. D., Malayalam poetry began to take a new turn. The main inspiration was Left Wing politics. In 1937, in a conference held at Trichur, some enthusiastic litterateurs founded a progressive school under the name of 'Jeevat Sahityam’ which was after sometime renamed as 'Purogamana Sahityam’. This school received its inspiration and strength from critics like A. Balakrishna Pillai, M. P. Paul and Joseph Mundasseri. Some of the better known progressive poets of Malayalam are N. V. Krishna Warrier, Akkitam, Vayalar Rama Varma, O. N. V. Kurup and P. Bhaskaran. In Marathi, the modern age had dawned in the first- half of the 19th century. Quite a variety of forces were respon- sible for it — such as the liberal education policy of the authorities, Elphinstone and Malcolm — of the Bombay Presidency College, the activities of the Bombay Native Education Society and the Dakshina Prize Committee, the work of the Christian missions, and publication of effective journals by Bal Shastri Jambhekar and Krishna Shastri Chiplunkar, then the publication of the ‘Kesari’ and lastly the contri- bution of stalwarts like Lokamanya Tilak, Justice Ranade and Gopal Krishna Gokhale* As early as the middle of the last century, several talented writers of Marathi translated the works of Kalidas, Bhavbhuti and Shudraka on the one hand and of Milton, Dryden, Scott, Pope, Gray, Goldsmith and Wordsworth on the other and thus imported a new imagery into Marathi. Mahajani, Kirtikar and Kunte occupy a prominent place in the poets of this group. They gave a new turn to Marathi poetry by imparting to it a note of national sentiment, seriousness of thought, an element of subjecti- vity and the directness of expression. Keshavasut’s ballad 'Tutari', the incomplete heroical epic 'Raja Shivaji’ of Kunte and the heroic lays of Govindagraj and of the revolutionary leader Savarkar arc powerful exponents of the national fervour. In the field of roman- ticism also Keshavasut was the pioneer, although the movement attained its full splendour in the poems of the later poets like Bee and Balkavi. Of late — within the last two decades, some of the youthful poets — Sharat Muktibodh, Karandikar and a few others have been writing under the inspiration of the Copijnunist ideology INTRODUCTION XIX and almost contemporaneous are the literary activities of the new intellectuals who have lost a talented leader in the death of Mar- dhekar. The historians of Gujarati divide their modern literature in three phases : (i) 1825-1885 A. D., (ii) 1885-1920 A. D. and (iii) 1920 onwards. They run more or less parallel to similar phases in other literatures. The dominant figure in the first era, namely the renais- sance, was Narmada who was a contemporary and also in a way a co-worker of Bhartendu Harishchandra of Hindi. In the second phase, the national cultural forces came to the forefront and they received further impetus in the third era, Gandhi was the fountain- head of this stream and a number of talented Gujarati writers received inspiration from him directly or indirectly. Nanhalal, Prof. Thakore, Kaka Kalelkar, Anand Shankar Dhruva, Uma Shankar, Sundaram and K. M. Munshi are the leaders of this school. The romantic art flowered in the lyrics of poets like Pujalal whose poetry combines in itself a subtle sense of beauty with charming imagery of an unconventional pattern. About 1940, in Gujarati also, the echoes of the Progressive Movement were heard in the works of several young poets like Maniar and others. Similarly, the experimentalists like Rajendra Shah and his colleagues are showing activity for the last one decade or so. Of modern Indian literatures, Bengali is possibly the richest in many respects. In the 19th century Bengal produced great social and cultural leaders like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Maharshi Devendranath Thakur and several literary giants such as Ishwar Chandra Gupta, Madhusudan Dutta and Bankim Chandra who brought about a revolution in society and literature. Here also the background of the modern age was prepared by the impact of Western culture and education on India's genius. The contact of Bengal with Europe was more intimate and direct and, therefore, modern age dawned there a little earlier and with greater splendour than in the Western regions. There also the process of regeneration was more or less the same ; the work of the Fort William College, propaganda of Christian missionaries and conse- quent reorientation of Hindu religion and culture by Indian leaders, activities of the School Text Book Society and translations of English classics combined to bring about a regeneration of Bengali literature in the later-half of the 19th century. The second phase XX INTRODUCTION in modern Bengali literature is shrouded in the literary glory of Rabindra Nath who gave a new mystic tone and evoked an exquisi- tely fine sense of beauty in Bengali poetry. Rabindra Nath had a universal poetic vision : his sympathies transcended the borders of the country and embraced the whole of humanity so that his nation- alism always had a broad human and cultural base. Thus, he was the fountain-head of the two powerful currents of Modern Indian Poetry — namely, the National-cultural school and the Romatic-mystic school. Although both of them are equally important, yet the latter attracted a larger number of followers and the new romantic trends which developed in various Indian languages in the first quarter of this century drew their inspiration from Rabindra Nath. In the fourth decade, however, there was a reaction against him and several Bengali authors who were influenced by Leftist ideologies raised their voice against the bourgeois mentality of Rabindra and Sharat. In poetry Subhash Mukhopadhyaya and in fiction Manik Bandyopadhyaya revolted against the two leaders and gave free expression to Marxian ideals. Then came the intellectuals like Vishnu De and others who are trying to recast the basic poetic pattern to suit the emotional and intellectual requirements of the modern age. In Assamese and Oriya also the evolution has been more or less similar. In Assamese literature, Anandaram Phukan was the first pilot of the nationalist movement and his collaborators were Kamalakant Bhattacharya, Hemchandra Barua and others who roused national consciousness by their heroic ballads and debunked prevalent social evils through their satires. The leaders in the second epoch were Chandra Kumar Agrawal, Lakshminath Bez- barua and Hem Chandra Goswami who can really be described as the makers of modern Assamese literature. The sentiments of patriotism which had infused new vigour into modern Assamese literature found fullest expression in the writings of these three authors and of several others inspired by them. Along with the powerful current of patriotism, one could also discern in these works the earlier traces of romanticism matured later on in the poetic art of Hiteshwar Barbarua, Yatindranath Duvara and Devakant Barua. Their poetry is highly subjective and is deeply influenced by English INTRODUCTION XXI Romantic Poetry and by Rabindra Nath. After the movement of 1942, the younger Assamese litterateurs were attracted towards Socialism and the poems in the collection ‘Modern Assamese Poetry* published in 1946 are resonant with violent notes of revolt against economic exploitation and social inequalities. Of late, Assamese poetry has also caught the infection of modern intellectualism and the new generation of poet — sat least the modem of them — are imita- ting Eliot and his colleagues with great zeal. Similarly, in modern Oriya literature, we find more or less parallel phases of evolution. There, the pioneers were Fakirmohan Senapati, Radhanath and Madhusudan. The light which they kindled blazed in full splendour in the writings of Gopabandhu Das and his contemporaries. The Satyavadi group of Gopabandhu was the stronghold of national and cultural re-awakening in Orissa and many a litterateur was directly or indirectly connected with it. Their attitude towards life and literature was, however, so rigidly moralistic from the very beginning that the urge for beauty and aesthetic ibliss was as though throttled. The result was the emergence of the ‘Sabu ja’ group of artists who drew their inspiration from Tagore and revelled in the expression of joy and romance of life. The poetical works of Baikunth Pattanayak and the novels and stories of Kalindicharan Panigrahi fall in this category. In the thirties, however, the growing influence of Socialism and Communism began to weaken Tagore’s hold on the imagination of the aspiring litterateurs of Oriya and in the fifth decade it found effective expression in the poems of Sachi Routray and others and in the contemporary era T. S. Eliot’s complicated poetic mechanism is attracting Vinod Routray, Vinod Nayak and others. Then come the thiee languages of North-Western India — namely Panjabi, Urdu and Hindi, They also, like their sister lang- uages, saw the dawn of Renaissance in the middle of the 19th century. Sir Atar Singh in Panjabi, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan in Urdu and Bharatendu Harishchandra in the non-official and Raja Shiva Prasad Sitar-e-Hind in the official circles of Hindi opened the shutters to bring in fresh air and new light by reorgani- zing education, by translating or arranging translations of Sanskrit and English works and by publishing journals. The Christian Mission? also played their part. In 1952 A, D. ? Ludhiana Christian xxu INTRODUCTION Mission published a translation of Bible in Panjabi and prepared a dictionary of Panjabi in 1854. InUrdu,Hali wrought radical reforms by removing from poetry shackles of conventional forms and using it as a medium for propagating the changing social and political values of life. Sir Syed renovated Urdu prose and fashioned it to suit the requirements of modern life. He set up a literary-scientific organization for translating English classics into Urdu and brought out a journal ‘Tahzib-ul-Akhlaq’ which played a very vital role in the development of Urdu prose. In Hindi, this period is known as Bhartendu Era in which Bhartendu and his literary friends rejuve- nated old techniques and introduced new forms in Hindi to cope with the demands of new life. It was really an era of great creative activity and revolutionary changes were wrought in the thought- content and in the form of Hindi Poetry as well as of Prose. The Christian Missionaries and the British rulers were also going ahead with their projects, of course, with a different purpose. Trans- lations and commentaries of Christian scriptures were published in Hindi and Urdu both and the British administration rendered valuable service to Hindi by employing the staff of Fort William College as also of some outside agencies like the School Text Book Society etc., in the preparation of text-books in Hindi. These aspirations further matured in the first two decades of this century when the notes of patriotism became more distinctly audible in the literatures of Panjabi, Urdu and Hindi. In Panjabi Gurumukh Singh Musafir and Hira Singh Dard wrote effective patriotic poems, in Urdu the great Iqbal shines out like the Sun although the verses of Akbar and Chakbast gained wider popularity on account of their liberal attitude. In Hindi, this was the time when our national poet Maithiii Sharan Gupta was attaining the peaks of his glory and he was followed by poets like Makhanlal Chaturvedi and Bal Krishna Sharma ‘Navin’. Later on, Siya Ram Sharan Gupta and Dinkar struck new notes in the national choir. The third main trend in modern Indian literature — namely Romanticism— attained its full glory in Chhayavad. Enriched by the poetic creations of Prasad, Pant, Nirala and Maha Devi, Chhayavad is a wonderful phenomenon in Indian poetry. In Panjabi, Bhai Vir Sin^h an$ INTRODUCTION XXUl Puran Singh are the leading poets of this school and in Urdu the poems of Akhtar Shirani and Majaz are bathed in romantic colours. Thereafter, the influence of Socialism becomes clearly marked in these literatures also* In Panjabi and Urdu, the note of revolt is louder than in Hindi : Josh Malihabadi, Firaq Gorakhpuri, Ahmad Nadim Qasimi, Ali Sardar Jafari in Urdu and Amrita Pritam and Kartar Singh Duggal in Panjabi have given a powerful expression to the people’s challenge. In Hindi, Pant's ‘Yug-vanP and ‘Grainy a’ , a number of stray poems of younger poets like Narendra, Anchal, Suman and Nagarjun, the novels and short-stories of Yashpal and the major works of Rahul Sankrityayana are written under the influence of Marxian philosophy. The latest trend, of course, is the Experimental Poetry or Prayogavad as it is styled in Hindi. Whether it bears this name or another or no name at all, there is no doubt that the more intellectual poets of Urdu and Panjabi also are being attracted towards this new trend and the poems of Pritam Singh Safir in Panjabi and of Faiz and N. M. Rashid are obviously written under this strain. The latest and also the greatest event in the history of India is the recovery of national freedom which has naturally influenced the literatures of all the modern languages of the country. India looks upon her freedom as the freedom of the World, as the liberation of all the countries from colonial and imperial bondages. For us, it does not signify only material victory — it is really a symbol of spiri- tual emancipation. All the regions of India resounded with festive songs in different languages to celebrate Independence, these songs are characterized by an unearthly bliss and a genuine sentiment of sympathy and friendship for the whole world. India’s successful peace-policy has deeply inspired the major poets of all our languages and given great impetus to National-Cultural Poetry which has now become really the most vital trend in Indian literature from Kash- mir to Kerala and from Assam to Saurashtra. In free India, the native languages have regained their rightful place and planned efforts are being made for their development in order to cope with the growing educational and administrative requirements of the nation, xxiv INTRODUCTION Thus, we see how the literatures of modern India have evol- ved and are still evolving on almost identical lines: (i) contact and conflict with Western culture through the efforts of Christian mis- sions and European trading companies and the consequent Renais- sance; (ii) growth of national and moral consciousness in literature as a result of the national movement under Gandhiji’s leadership; (iii) reaction against moral austerities of the Reformist movement in life and literature and birth of Romanticism; (iv) impact of Marxian ideology; (v) experiments to find new forms of expression for the complex experiences of modern intellectual life under the influence of litterateurs like T.S. Eliot and philosophers like Sartre, and lastly (vi) expansion of the national-cultural trends with concrete ideals of Universal Brotherhood after Independence— this, in brief, is an out- line of the development of Modern Indian Literature, common to all the languages of the country. Besides these regular trends, we find in Indian literatures some other common elements also which are less sustained and yet very important: for example, the series of narrative poems based on the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are common to all the languages of India. The Kamba Ramayanam in Tamil, the Ranganath Ramayana and the Bhaskara Ramayana etc. in Telugu, the Parnpa Ramayana in Kannada, the Adhyatma Ramayana of Eluttaccan (Ezhuttachchan) in Malayalam, the Ramakatha of Moropant in Marathi, the Krittibasa Ramayana in Bengali, the Ramayana of Madhava Kandali in Assamese, the Bilanka Ramayana of Sara- ladas and the famous Ramayana of Balarama Das in Oriya, and the Tulsi Ramayana — -more precisely the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsi Das in Hindi are beads of the same rosary. Similarly, the poetic narratives based on the Mahabharata are spread over the whole country: in Telugu three ancient poets Nannaya, Tikkana and Errana completed the Mahabharata, in Kannada the Mahabharatas of Pampa and Kumara Vyasa are very famous and in Malayalam the Mahabharata of Eluttaccan is in a way more original and complete than his Ramayana itself. In Marathi, Shridhar wrote the ‘Pandava Pratap’ but that is not quite remarkable; in Bengali there yverp abput 30 renderings of the Mahabharata in the 17th INTRODUCTION XXV and the 1 8th centuries of which the Mahabharata of Kashirarnis easily the best, in Assamese Ramasaraswati composed several Vadha- Kavyas based on the Mahabharata, in Oriya the famous Maha- bharata poet is the great Saraladas who is known in Orissa as the ‘Utkal Vyas\\ in Panjabi Krishnalal produced a verse-translation, and in Hindi the Mahabharata of Gokul Nath etc., in the later medieval age and the c Jaya-Bharat’ of Maithili Sharan (iupta in the modern times are works of permanent literary merit. So also, the transla- tions of the Bhagwata have been as common to all these languages. Quite obviously, all these renderings have served as strong ties of unity. Then, the influence of the works of Sanskrit poetics is an- other tie that binds Indian literatures together. The ‘Natyashastra 5 of Bharata, the ‘Dhwanyaloka 5 of Anandwardhana, the ‘Kavyadarsha* ofDandin, the ‘Kavyaprakasha* of Marnrnata, the ‘Sahityadarpana* of Vishwanatha, and the ‘Rasagangadhara’ of Jagannatha have been popular with the literary scholars in all the languages of the country. They are being studied, interpreted and also translated in different languages for the past several centuries. That is the reason why there is a basic unity in our literary ideals all over India. So far we have investigated the common elements in the theme and the content of Indian literature, but the similarity of forms and style is no less striking. To all the literatures of India, the poetic forms of Sanskrit namely the Mahakavya, the Khand-kavya the Muktak, the Katha and the Akhyayika etc., the various forms of Apabhramsha such as the Charit-kavya, the Prem-gatha (romance), the Rasa and the Pada, and so also some of the patterns of Persian poetry have comedown as a common legacy. Besides the varnika metres of Sanskrit, many a popular metre like the Doha and the Ghaupai are the favourite vehicles of Indian poetry. In the modern times, the literary forms of the West such as the lyric with all its sub-divisions namely the dde, the elegy, the sonnet and the verse-libre have infiltrated into all our languages alike. The same is true about our language complexion. Although the langur ages of India belong to two different stocks — the Aryan and the Dravidian, yet the influence of Sanskrit, and Pali, Prakrits, Apabhra- msha and Persian in the past and of English in the present is iNfRObUCfiOtf xkvi responsible for great similarities in the vocabulary and also in the syntax of our languages today. These languages have been drawing freely from Sanskrit right from their origin for the development of their semantics, for colour and metaphor and for the formation of new words and expressions; and they are doing so all the more at present. Within the last fifty years, the influence of English langu- age also has been very deep and vital. English is infinitely rich in metaphor and all the languages of our country have been absorbing the idioms, the modes of expression and the phrases of English con- sciously or unconsciously. Our prose, of course, is directly modelled on English prose. Consequently, there is a fundamental unity in the literary medium of our country which is re-strengthened by the unity of theme. Thus, it is not difficult to believe that ‘Indian Literature is one though written in many languages’. Unfortunately, till we regained our independence greater emphasis had been laid on the elements of diversity. Its essential unity is yet to be revealed in its fullness. This requires, in the first instance, an objective and systematic investigation into the elements of unity in variety and for that a basic change in our methods of study and research will be necessary. An enquiry into any trend of Indian literature cannot be confined to one language only for such an enquiry will always be very incomplete. For example, if a researcher in Madhura Bhakti confines his studies to Hindi or Bengali alone, he will not discover the whole reality : he will have to explore the literatures of Gujarati, Oriya, Assamese, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam as well wherein this current flows with almost the same force. There will be obviously many gaps in our study if it is limited to one language only. Many an event which appears casual or accidental to the historian of Hindi literature is really not so. The origins and the earlier tradi- tions of the vast treasure of devotional songs in Hindi, which baffled Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla, can be easily traced in the Southern languages and in Bengali besides, of course, the Apabhramsha. The treatment of childhood by Surdas was not a mere accident in Hindi literature : the Gujarati poet Bhalana in his descriptive lyrics, the Malayalam poet of the 15th century in his Rrishnagatha and the I^TkODUG^ION XXVil Assamese poet Madhava Deva in his ‘Bargeets’ have dealt with this subject with keen interest and with great success. A comparative study of the poems based on Ramayana and Mahabharata in different languages solves so many problems easily. There are countless designs in the plot-structures of our medieval Romances which cannot be properly understood without a close comparative study of these forms in various Indian literatures. To appreciate the essential meaning of Sufi poetry, we shall have to traverse into the realms of North-Western literatures — such as Kashmiri, Sindhi, Panjabi and Urdu, besides Persian, of course. Studies in Ramkavya in any Indian language — specially of the North, will be incomplete without a proper appreciation of the conception of Rama in TulsPs ‘Ramcharitmanas’. Similarly, the influence of the Ashta-Chhap poets of Brajbhasha had perceptibly or imperceptibly infiltrated into the poetry of Bengal and Gujarat and no research in their Krishna-kavya will bear desired fruits without a proper assessment of this influence. This method of inter-literary research will prove immensely useful in finding out many a missing link in every litera- ture, in resolving various knots and will reveal in a most effective manner tl e essential unity of Indian thought and sentiment. But this task is as formidable as it is important. The first and foremost is the difficulty of language. So far the knowledge of the Indian research-scholar is limited, besides his own language, to English and Sanskrit only — without any acquaintance with other regional languages, As such, one can legitimately apprehend that our scheme of inter-literary research might just remain a pious wish. Yet, I am sure that this difficulty cannot be insurmountable— and we can overcome it by coordinated and planned efforts. Some lang- uage-groups are such that a student of one language can pick up another with just a little practice — there translation, nay even transliteration is not necessary : for example one can manage (a) Bengali, Oriya and Assamese, (b) Hindi and Marathi and (c) Telugu and Kannada with the help of a few word-meanings and grammatical notes. For Hindi, Panjabi and Urdu, transliteration with some word-meanings can suffice : almost the same device could be used for Hindi and Gujarati, Tamil and Malay alam to a great extent. In Jcxvni INTRODUCTION the case of other languages, we can resort to translations. Then, there are many other effective measures of inter-linguistic communi- cation such as publication of literary histories of India in different languages, comparative studies, comparative researches, inter-literary seminars etc. Fortunately, such a consciousness has been roused in the country and several institutions are engaged in this useful work. It is a stupendous task and is yet in its infancy; it requires a well- organized all-India campaign and these sporadic efforts made here and there will not do. However, the very conception of the ‘Indian Literature’ as one unit is an auspicious augury. India’s national unity is based on its cultural unity and cultural unity requires sound emotional integration which is possible only through literature. Just as an integrated Indian nation is emerging steadily inspite of all the apprehensions and suspicions of the pessimists, so also a composite ‘Indian Literature’ is evolving gradually through the diversity of languages. With a common spiritual ‘subconscious’, how can the literary expression be essentially different ? X X X X In the end, may I add a few words, about the present volume ? The plan was drawn up about five years ago and I had started work on it immediately after. Quite naturally we wanted to present authentic surveys of different Indian literatures and accordingly we approached first-rank critics of all languages to assist us in the task. The original response was quite good and we sent round a tentative outline to our collaborators with a view to achieving a basic unifor- mity in the treatment of the subject, leaving, of course, the final decision to them. At the outset, with the ready promises of cooper- ation, it appeared as if the project was not so difficult as I had thought but as time passed, many formidable obstacles crossed my way : some scholars had readily agreed in the beginning, but afterwards they backed out almost as easily. Such a state of uncer- tainty continued for about a year and a half and I was torn between the ‘Ay’s and ‘No’s of my collaborators all the time : it was always a grievous shock whenever somebody abruptly said ‘No’ after having given a solemn promise. There were on the other hand certain very conscientious writers who had kept their word and their articles were lying with me for long for I could not use them unless the INTRODUCTION XXIX series was complete : they really showed extraordinary patience, but there was a limit to it and some of them had actually started asking me to return their articles. This tug-of war should have unnerved anybody, yet with my usual obstinacy, I persisted and ultimately after a hard struggle for full four years succeeded in collecting all the twelve articles. In the meantime, two of my publishers whom I had contracted were scared away by the uncertainty of the project and I was faced with the problem of finding out publishers for this symposium which required a substantial investment and was on the whole a very complicated scheme. At long last, I got hold of the present publishers and with their cooperation the ‘Indian Literature’ is now in your hands. The original outline which we had sent round to the authors had obviously become ineffective and the majority of the articles were written independently with the result that the uniformity which we had originally aimed at was shattered : even in length no uniformity could be achieved. But there was no alternative : requesting the authors to revise their articles would have only meant depriving ourselves of those articles. Therefore, we decided to publish them as they were without bothering about uniformity. There are many other flaws in our work — the absence of diacritical marks being the most glaring of them — still I am not dissatisfied with this attempt. It is the first venture to present a joint survey of Indian Literatures : our writers are authorities in their subjects and some of them occupy the very highest positions; some of the leading literateurs and educationists adorn our Editorial Board. I would, therefore, present this volume to the student of Indian Literature without much diffidence. In the end, I shall express my sense of deep gratitude to the learned authors and also to the members of the Editorial Board for all the guidance and assistance they have graciously given me from time to time. All the articles have been written originally in English, except for the one on Hindi Literature which has been rendered into English by Shri Kanwar Lai of Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi. I thank him sincerely and also Shri M. ISL Chaube who has assisted me in various ways in bringing out this book. University of Delhi. •Nagendra Dr. M. Varadarajan TAMIL The History of the Tamil Language TAMIL is the most ancient and highly cultivated of the South Indian languages. According to M. Srinivasa Iyengar, “Tamil occupies the same position in the Dravidian family that Sanskrit ■does in the Aryan”. 1 It is a classical language like Sanskrit, Greek or Latin; while her ancient contemporaries have changed beyond recognition and some of them ceased to be spoken tongues, Tamil continues to be one of the most vigorous languages of modern India. It may be said to be the only ancient language which is still young and healthy and also capable of expressing modern ideas. Its history can be traced upto the age of Tholkappiyam, the earliest extant Tamil grammar, which is generally ascribed to 1000 B. C. Having pursued our enquiry so far back we find ourselves dealing with a highly developed language, possessing a rich past of which we know nothing. Tholkappiyanar, the author of the grammatical work referred to, himself admits that he is not the first grammarian, quotes his predecessors and refers to a literary tradition already in existence.* The language of his age, as expounded by him in his work, differs from modern Tamil in vocabulary, but in morphology and syntax it remains almost the same. A study of this ancient work enables us to assess only the changes which the language has undergone through the subsequent ages. But it does not at all lead us to investigate into the origin of the language. There are a few legends and mythological references which tell us about the origin of the language. But it is only Dr. Caldwell of the last century who made an earnest and scientific attempt to trace its origin and development by a comparative study of the grammars of Tamil and the cognate languages, viz- Telugu, Kannada and 1 Tamil Studies, pp. 1 5 1 - 1 52 2 Tholkappiyam, Porulathikaram, 53 INDIAN LITERATURE Malayalam. He tried to advance further by a study of the languages of uncivilized peoples closely allied to these languages, the uncultivated languages of this group, viz- Tuda, Kota, Gond, Ku y Rajmahal, Oraon and Brahui . 1 Tracing the origin of a language is always found to be bound up with that of the people who spoke it and thus the problem belongs to primitive history, rather than to philology. Before the advent of the Aryans there was a race of people in India who were, for some reasons, called by the historians as the Dravidians. The Dravidians and the Aryans might have been ethnologically of the same race, but after having lived together for a certain period as members of the common stock of humanity, they might have separated themselves and migrated to different countries in different directions. The Dravidians settled in India and the Aryans went to the different parts of Asia and Europe. Many are the theories put forward regarding these Dravidians and Aryans, mostly hypothetical and imaginative, rather than historical and factual. Leaving apart these theories, the student of linguistics finds that there was already a language spoken by the people throughout the length and breadth of India long before the arrival of the Aryans. The Aryans came and settled in North India and from there a few gradually moved towards the South. So much so, the mixture of their language with that of the natives (the Dravidians) is found to be more in the north than in the south. Apart from the history of the people, the language itself furnishes certain evidences as to their antiquity. According to V. R. R. Dikshitar 2 , <c in the most ancient layers of the Tamil language can be discovered not only ample trace of Neolithic culture but also the birth of the iron age culture which succeeded it.” Its origin is generally believed to be coeval with the birth of man. There are geological reasons to consider that South India was the part of the world to settle first as a land mass and that the original race of mankind as well as the first language might have come into existence in South India and later on this original race travelled to other parts 1 A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages, p* 6. 2 Pre-historic South India, p. 179 TAMIL 3 of the world. There are a large number of Dravidian sounds, words and expressions in the north Indian languages as well as in the Scythian or North-Asian languages. R. G. Bhandarkar observes the existence of the short c e 9 and ‘o’ in Pali and the predilection the people showed for them, as well as the change of dentals to cerebrals without any influencing cause, and remarks : “these sounds must have existed and played an important part in the original language of the people, so that they were unable to shake them off entirely, even when they left their mother tongue and learned that of the Aryans with whom they came to be closely incorporated. If the original Pali speakers belonged to the same race as the Dravidians of Southern India, wc have a reason to believe that their native tongue contained them; for they exist in the Dravidian languages and are very characteristic of them .” 1 P.D. Gune admits that there are in the north Indian languages words of other than Sanskrit extraction and says that “they throw great light on the vocabulary not only of the Prakrits, but also of the present vernaculars and the non-Indo-Aryan clement in them”. Some of these words, according to him, are clearly Dravidian.* It is also obvious that the modern North Indian languages have the same fundamental grammatical structure as the South Indian languages . 3 The indigenous people of India are denoted by various terms, as the old or pre-historic Tamils by some, as Proto- Dravidians by some, more commonly as Dravidians for the sake of convenience to distinguish them from the Tamils who evolved later on as such from the original people in South India and cultivated Tamil as a literary language. These ancient Dravidians moved to the western countries not only by sea but also by land in days of unrecorded history and they left their impression on the languages of those countries. This largely explains why the languages of those countries adopted some peculiar features of the Dravidian languages, the features now found in the Tamil language . 4 This theory is confirmed by the large number of Dravidian words and grammati- cal expressions in the Scythian group of languages in Central and 1 Collected Works of R G. Bhandarkar, pp. 293-4 2 An Introduction to Comparative Philology, p. 220 3 V. R, R. Dikshitar, Pre-historic South India, p. 179 4 Ibid. pp. 194*195 £ INDIAN LITERATURE North Asia and in the Brahui language spoken in Baluchistan, as well as ill the language of the mountaineers of Rajmahal in North India. The European scholars who came to this country during the last century and studied the languages spoken by the peoples were impressed that all the Indian languages originated from Sanskrit which they found out to be a language closely affiliated to the European languages. Hence they used the term ‘Indo-European family* to include and indicate the affinity of all the Indian languages as well as Sanskrit. They came to this conclusion after studying mainly the vocabulary of the Indian languages, especially those of the North Indian languages. Neither the South Indian languages nor their literary works were examined adequately. The grammars of the various languages were not compared, nor were they aware of the non-Sanskrit elements in these languages. Resemblances which at first appeared to them to be valid evidences of relationship between the South Indian languages and the Indo-European languages, were overvalued despite the fact that these resemblances pertained to the unreliable field of vocabulary. While acknowledging the fact that the Dravidian languages came under Sanskrit influence, V. R. R. Dikshitar asserts that it was only in much later time and that the Dravidian languages had till then an independent origin and growth . 1 Rasmus Rask of Denmark was the first to perceive that the South Indian languages were totally different from Sanskrit and from the North Indian languages. The term ‘Dravidian* was not yet popular then and therefore he called these South Indian languages ‘Malabaric’ while some others termed them as ‘Tamuluc* or ‘Tamilue .* 2 This was an eye-opener to the linguists who came later on and sought evidences for grouping these languages separately as belonging to the ‘Dravidian family’. They realised that the North Indian languages and to a certain extent Sanskrit also had in them a few 1 Pre-historic South India, p. 192 2 Abel Hoveiacque, The Science of Language, p. 77 Whitney D. W., Language and the Study of Language p, 326. TAMIL 5 Draviclian elements. 1 Dr. Gundert and Dr. Kittel who made special study of Malayalam and Kannada wrote articles as early as 1869 and 1872 on the Dravidian elements in Sanskrit in the Journal of the German Oriental Society and in the Indian Antiquary for 1872. Dr. Caldwell did pioneer work in comparing the grammars of all the Dravidian languages. His research revealed that in morphology and syntax, the Dravidian languages differed from the Indo-European languages and that this difference was more funda- mental than the apparent similarity in vocabulary. He tried to prove the affinity of the Dravidian languages with the Scythian family. But one feels right in agreeing with Grierson who considers them as an isolated family with independent features of their own/ Tclugu and Kannada and Malayalam of the Dravidian languages are dependent on Sanskrit, but this dependence pertains to vocabulary and does not allude to their origin from Sanskrit. 8 Tamil, despite its borrowing a few words from Sanskrit, stands independent. The infusion of foreign words in a language is always an evidence of the contact of the people speaking a different language, but not of the affinity of the languages, much less of the origin of the language that borrowed. In Tamil, especially in mediaeval and modern literature, there are a number of Sanskrit words and even those words are found to have been sparingly used with restriction. Tholkappiyanar, the ancient grammarian, permits the usage of such words in literature, provided they arc adapted to the Tamil phonetic system. 4 The later grammarians have framed rules for this adaptation. All these go to prove that even in the field of vocabulary Tamils not dependent on Sanskrit. “Tamil is rich in synonyms and generally it is not through any real necessity but from choice, and the fashion of the age, that it makes use of Sanskrit/’ 5 If Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam of South India have admitted Sanskrit 1 The Aryan population of North India is not, therefore, a pure race, but containing among others, a strong Dravidian element. — Grierson, Linguistic Survey, Vol. IV- p. 278. 2 Ibid, p.289. 3 C.

Brown : A Grammar of the Telugu Language. 4 Tholkappiyam, Eluttathikaram, 401. 5 Caldwell: A Comparative Grammar of Dravidian Languages, p. 55 u INDIAN LITERATURE words to a greater extent, it is mainly due to the fact that the literatures and the grammars of these languages have mostly been 1/vritten by Sanskrit scholars. The coincidences of vocabulary are, says A.H. Sayce, accidental. 1 According to him, it is in the sentence, not in the isolated word, that languages agree or differ. The borrowing of grammatical forms is of much rarer occurrence and of more fundamental nature. Even in the field of vocabulary, the most fundamental words of languages, viz., personal pronouns, numerals, etc. reveal to a Certain degree the affinity or difference between them and the evidences they furnish as to the origin of a language are in a way reliable. But the numerals and personal pronouns of Tamil are totally different from those of Sanskrit and other Indo-European tongues. On the other hand, the modern North Indian languages, though called Indo-European or Aryan family of languages, have substituted agglutinated postfixes for flection and so have adopted the gram- matical machinery of the Dravidian languages. 2 Further the syntax of the former languages is almost the same as that of the latter, so much so that sentences from one language can be translated into another language by the mere substitution of word for word, as seen in the following two sentences in Tamil and Hindi. One has to fill in the appropriate words and postpositions of one language in the sentence-form of another, and the structure is then found complete. Tamil : Nan vittukku pokir-en Hindi : Men gharko jata-hun I house-to going-am (I am going to house) There are many such points of agreement between the North Indian tongues and the Dravidian languages in the structure of words and sentences, i. e., in morphology and syntax. Only penetrating study can bring to light such resemblances. Such a 1 Introduction to the Science of Language, p* 87 % Sayce: Introduction to the Science of Language, p, 174 TAMIL / study, it is regrettable to note, has not yet been undertaken in a scientific spirit. This requires an acuteness of perception and freedom from prejudices. Great play is here afforded for subjective views and inherited prepossessions. One must try to be free from these and seek for truth and truth alone. Such a comparative study leads one to conclude that the primitive parent Dravidian language was the spoken language of the whole of India during the pre-historic age and that the modern South Indian languages, Tamil, Telugu etc., were directly derived from it, whereas the North Indian languages evolved from the same parent language but became more and more changed on account of the mixture of many foreign words and forms. From the points of view hitherto explained it is evident that during the pre-historic age, before the advent of the Aryans into India, the then North Indians as well as the South Indians were speaking different dialects of the parent language of the Dravidian family. Later on, after the two races mixed together in the North, Sanskrit came up as a language refined for literature, as its name itself suggests. A little earlier than this, or simultaneously with this, in the remote South, Tamil evolved itself as a literary dialect (called Sen-Tamil) while the spoken dialect (called Kodun-Tamil) gradually underwent modifications, mostly due to the local cultural, social and political developments and changes and partly due to the influence of the social and cultural developments in the North. The dialects spoken in the adjoining countries were left uncared-for and so changed considerably from age to age till at last about the ninth or tenth century, Sanskrit scholars wrote works of grammar and literature in those dialects and thus paved way for the evolution of Telugu and Kannada. From the time when a dialect of the parent language of the Dravidian family came to be developed as a literary language called Tamil, it had been recognised as the standard language of Tamilnad, the southern part of the country famous for its cultural and social evolutions. 'In ancient India, only two languages had been recognised as cultured, Sanskrit of the North and Tamil of the South. Legends and mythological references trace the former to the Sanskrit 8 INDIAN LITERATURE grammarian Panmi and the latter to the Tamil grammarian Agattiyar . 1 Mythology traces the origin of these two ancient languages to Lord Siva who is said to have taught these to those grammarians respectively. This merely points to the antiquity as well as the highly cultivated literary role of the two languages. References are there in the earliest Kavya of Sanskrit, the Valmiki Ramayana, to the great Tamil kingdom of Pandiyas and its cultural and political glories. The earliest extant Tamil literature called Sangam literature bears ample internal evidences to these. Professor Max Muller gives due credit to Tamil as “the most highly cultivated language that possesses the richest stores of indigenous literature.” The language that was one of the many dialects of the primitive and parent language of the Dravidian family spoken throughout the length and breadth of this sub-continent some thou- sands of years ago, thus evolved itself as one of the highly cultivated languages of the world. Its antiquity is also evident from the fact that many Tamil words like ‘tugi’ (for peacock, from Tamil ‘togai’) and ‘arousa* (for rice, from ‘arid’ in Tamil) were introduced in the European languages as early as Solomon’s time, and according to some scholars even earlier in the fourth millenium before Christ when there was commercial intercourse between Tamilnad and the Mesopotamian valley. Tamil has retained its vigour and youthfulness and still remains one of the highly cultivated languages of the world. Dr. Winslow in the introduction to his Tamil-English Dictionary says : “It is not perhaps extravagant to say that in its poetic form Tamil is more polished and exact than Greek, and in both dialects with its borrowed treasures, more copious than Latin. In its fulness and power, it more resembles English and German than any other language”. Dr. Slater said “the Tamil language is extraordinary in its subtlety and sense of logic”. According to W. Taylor, “it is one of the most copious, refined and polished languages spoken by man”. Its phonetic laws governing the grouping of vowels and 1 The earliest masters in linguistic observation and classification were the old Indian grammarians— Jesperson, Language, p. 21 . TAMIL consonants in words are simple and natural. Languages in which there is an overabundance of involved consonant groupings or of consonant sounds to the detriment of vowel sounds are not pronounced correctly; \"there is in such languages a wide gulf between spelling and pronunciation, as in English. Tamil grammarians had anticip- ated more than three thousand years ago what most languages arc now discovering and had already avoided such consonant com- binations and favoured regular alternation of consonants and vowels. Tamil Grammarians lay great stress on the system of syllabation so as to avoid unpleasant consonant combinations and endings and permit only such groups and endings which arc easy to pronounce and aesthetically appealing to the ear. The technique of word formation in Tamil had been clearly explained by early grammarians and is still in vogue, unchanged and unquestioned. Tamil resorted to this technique and coined words from native roots and from words already coined out of such roots in an endless variety of ways ; so much so, there are now found in Tamil innumerable derivations and compounds with their roots easily recognisable. This is possible in Tamil because it is an aggluti- native language which always has the advantage of combining logical analysis with economy of means. This is the reason why Tamil had even as early as 200 A. D. a large and copious indigenous vocabulary of words that are now found in ancient Tamil literature, and why it has always been resisting unrestricted borrowing of words from other languages, even from Sanskrit. The Tamil vocabulary, even in its earliest literary period called the Sangam period, is found to be very rich and abundant, and if, as Vendryes says, the vocabulary of any language reveals its culture 1 , the early Tamil vocabulary really stands as an evidence not only to the fertility and vigour of the language but also to its ancient culture. Tamil is the only language in the world that retains its basic form unchanged as a spoken language for the past twenty centuries and more ; it is still the language spoken by about thirty-five million people in India, Ceylon and Malaya. Such an uninterrupted conti- 1 Language, p. 306 10 INDIAN LITERATURE nuity in its growth and development is due to its simple and natural phonetic laws and its healthy and indigenous technique of word-for- mation as explained above. The Beginnings of Tamil Literature As the culture of the ancient Tamils was indigenous to the soil on which they lived, and as it evolved before they came into contact with other people, the earliest Tamil literature was mainly due to the influence of the physical surroundings, due to geographical and not historical causes. The land was fertile with its mountains and rivers, plateaus and fields, stretching to the sea on the east, the west and the south. Nature and life lived in such natural surroundings inspired the imaginative bards to sing. Naturalism and romanticism were the •distinct qualities of their poems. There were poets like Wordsworth who painted pictures of the hills, the lakes, the rivers and the inno- cent folk of Tamilnad, though they never personified Nature as mod- ern poets do ; there were poets like Scott with apt descriptions of Nature, based on close observation, so accurate that a botanist might acquire a correct idea of the vegetation of the country. Their love of Nature was so powerful that it permeated the themes of love as well as of war in their poems. This blending of feelings in men and women with the beauties of Nature, though subtle and mysteri- ous, had been recognised and maintained as essential in the literary conventions of the earliest period of Tamil literature. The earliest extant literature of the Tamils is called Sangam Literature and it is dated not later than 500 B. C. to 200 A. D. It is a bouquet of blossoms varied in form and fragrance, •colour and complexion. Volumes of poetry had been swept away by inundations and many more were lost in course of time as the ancient people felt no need to preserve them. The early poets of Tamilnad, as those of other countries, sang unconsciously as birds. Even when the bards recorded the glorious deeds of their royal heroes in their poems, they were not preserved by the next generation and so perished. Later on somewhere about the third or fourth century A. D., some of the bards and the patrons felt a need for preserving them and they collected the available poems, selected those worth communicating to posterity and compiled them. These are the anci- TAMIL 11 ent collections now available to us. They are called the Eight An- thologies and the Ten Idylls. They consist of two thousand three hundred and eighty one verses varying from small lyrics of three lines to an idyll of seven hundred and eighty-two lines. There are four hundred and seventy three poets known either by the names they bore or by causal names culled from their poeti- cal works ; in the case of hundred and two poems, the authors are unidentified. Among the identified poets, about thirty are women, the famous poetess Awaiyar being one of them. These are mainly classified into two, one ‘Akam’ or ‘esoteric’ dealing with love, and the other ‘Puram 5 or ‘exoteric’ dealing with war and administration and morals. In no other period was T amil literature more bound by traditional literary conventions than in this period of Sangam works. The poets were firm in keeping up the tradition. The land was treated in five regions, viz., moun- tains, forests, fields, coasts and arid deserts, and the theme of love in five aspects, viz., union, patience, sulking, wailing and separation. Each of these five aspects had for itself a region, a season and an hour ; each region had its own flora and fauna, habits and customs, food and music etc. The poet dealing with a certain aspect of love restricted himself to its particular region, season, hour, flora, and fauna, etc. The natural peculiarities of each region are made to bear on the aspect of love pertaining to it. This is the reason why the Sangam poets while dealing with Nature elaborately, never took interest in Nature for its own sake. Yet their treatment of Nature was original, even if ponderous, and it was popular though bound by such strict conventions. They knew all the effects which the painter and the sculptor can and cannot achieve and brought them all into their poems successfully. They had a consum- mate choice and taste in words with which they skilfully painted such pictures. These literary conventions are found in Tholkappiyam, the earliest extant treatise on grammar. It is dated back to 1000 B.C. It contains 1276 sutras. Its first part is on Orthography, the second on Morphology and the third on Literary conventions and •usages. It is evident that this work was preceded by centuries of 12 INDIAN LITERATURE literary culture, for it lays down rules for different kinds of com- positions deduced from literary works of the best authors whose works had been in existence then and also refers to other gram- matical works which are now extinct. We have only names of certain works known to us through the references to them in later works and hence to attempt an account of the pre-Tholkappiyam works, will be groping in the dark. But for the survival of Tholkappiyam, the existence of literary works in Tamil before 1000 B.C. could not have been believed and it would have been considered as one of the legends gathering round Sangam literature. Now it is asserted that Thol- kappiyam is a work written during a period when literary activity in Tamil reached its high watermark. The first part deals with phonetic rules and different assimila- tions of sounds in words in a scientific manner. The second part elaborately explains the parts of speech, the formation of simple and compound words and syntax. It is a peculiarity in Tamil that the grammarians have based gender on the signification of words, not on the endings of words. There is no such thing as grammatical gender in Tamil even as early as Tholkappiyam. Modern philologists are of the opinion that Tholkappiyam is an advanced grammatical treatise and their view is based on the study of the first two parts of the work. The third part, called Porulathikaram, treats of literary con- ventions, rhetoric, prosody etc., and is the most important part and reflects such a mature culture as to lead us to infer that the Tamil people should have had a high degree of civilisation for many centuries before such a work could arise. As V.R.R. Dikshitar says, this part gives us a glimpse of the political, social and religious life of the people and the importance of the work is further enhanced by several commentators of great repute. According to Tholkappiyam, the subject-matter for a literary composition may be either Akam, the esoteric treatment of love, or Puram, the exoteric treatment of war and administration and morals. He also deals with sentiments expressed in poetry, rhetoric, prosody, idioms and traditions. Simile is the basis of all the figures of rhetoric, and 1 Studies in Tamil Literature, p. 26. TAMIL 13 it is analytically treated in one chapter. The chapter on prosody explains all the metrical devices of the language. The early Tamil literature possesses varied and polished forms of verse which are indigenous and independent of any Sanskrit model. This also proves the existence of an age-long poetic literature in Tamil before 1000 B.C. which enabled the author of the ancient grammar Tholkap- piyam to explain in detail the different metres and their rules as deduced from the poetical works of his age. “Dravidian genius”, -says T. Sesha Iyengar, “was conspicuous not merely in the sphere of language, but also in that of literature. Of all the races of India, the only people who had a poetical literature independent of Sanskrit are the Tamils, a typical Dravidian people.” As convention and system play an essential part in the literary works of the post-Tholkappiyam period, a proper understanding of them requires a basic knowledge of the third part of this great work of grammar. There are references here and there in the great commentaries of Sangam literature to other grammatical works called Agatthiyam, Pannirupadalam, Avinayam, Kakkaipadiniyam, Natrattham, etc. The former of these is said to have been written by Agatthiyanar. There arc many legends associated with this author and others of the three Sangams or Academics of Tamil literature. The Sangam Period (500 B.C. to 200 A. D.) The Ten Idylls (Patithuppattu) This is an anthology of ten idylls by eight different authors of the Sangam period or the Epoch of the Academies. These are richly wrought descriptive poems in the most finished classical style and contain charming portraits of Nature in some of her striking moods. In these we do not find that idle accumulation of hyperbolic conceits which characterises the literature of the mediaeval period. Only a sober-minded and judic- ious estimate of the values of life rendered pleasant with the beauties of Nature is found in these poems. The shortest of them contains 103 lines and the longest 782. Of these ten, Tirumurugatruppadai is a religious idyll by the 1 The Ancient Dravidians, pp. 114, 115, 119. 14 INDIAN LITERATURE celebrated poet Nakkirar. Atruppadai is a general theme in which a minstrel, songster, actor or poet who returns with bounteous presents from a benevolent patron addresses and guides a fellow minstrel, songster, actor or poet who suffers from the pangs of poverty and seeks for a patron to relieve his sufferings. This ‘atruppadai’ by Nak- kirar is an exceptional one and is dedicated to God Muruga (Subrah- manya) and is in the form of a devotee addressing a fellow devotee who is in search of Him. The title means ‘The Guide to God Muruga’. The different manifestations of the God and His different shrines in South India are described. There is a valuable commentary by Nacchinarkkiniyar on this. The second idyll Porunaratruppadai is a ‘Guide to a war- minstrel’, and is sung in praise of the Chola king Karikala. The poet Mudatthamakkanniyar gives a description of the ancient Chola kingdom, its fertility due to the unfailing waters of the Kaviri river, its agricultural and industrial prosperity and the wisdom and martial glory of the Chola king. The idyll affords rich materials to the student of ancient South Indian history. The third work Sirupanatruppadai by the poet Natthatthanar of Nallur is in the form of an address by a well-rewarded lyrist to a fellow artist. The patron celebrated here is Nalliyakkodan, a chieftain of Erumainadu. He is said to have excelled the seven great patrons called ‘Seven Vallals’ in his rich gifts to the bards. The poem abounds in descriptions of cities and villages and of the different kinds of life led by the people there. The fourth of this anthology is Perumpanatruppadai by Urutthi-- rankannanar in praise of the ruler of Kanchi (Conjcevaram) ,, Thondaiman Ilanthiraiyan. It is also a guide to the lyrist and equally valuable for a student of political and social history of ancient South India. Mullaip-pattu is the fifth idyll by Napputhanar, gold merchant ■ of Kavirippumpattinam, the ancient sea-port city of South India. It portrays the feelings of an ideal wife eagerly awaiting her husband’s return from a military expedition. The hero on the eve of his victorious return from the battle-field is counting his losses, while the queen in her seven-storeyed palace in a wintry night TAMIL 15 is counting days and consulting omens. When the queen almost lost all her patience and hopes, suddenly her ears catch the sounds of the king’s trumpets and conches blown at a distance along with the sounds of his chariot and his horses on his way home. The king’s elephants were trained in a northern language probably Prakrit. The Greeks, the Turks, the Egyptians, and the Chinese were there as the king’s chamber-guards and they were called ‘Yavanar’ in Tamil. Madhuraikkanchi is the next idyll, the longest of the idylls consisting of 782 lines. Though very rich in descriptions, it is free from fantasies or conceits. The author Mangudi Marudhanar here celebrates the ancient city of Madhurai and the Pandiya king Neduncheliyan of Thalaiyalankanam fame. Details of the army, trades, festivals, seaports, customs and manners of the people, and the administrative and martial glories of the Pandiya dynasty are all given in this long poem. N"
