It occupies an important place in the history of India. As the capital of the ChSlas from about 1026 A.D. for about 250 years, the city controlled the affairs of entire south India, from the Tunga- bhsdra in the north to Ceylon in the south. The great temple of Siv^a at this place is next only to the great temple of Tanjore in its monumental nature and surpasses it in sculptural quality. The city was founded by the eminent ChSla emperor probably to commemorate his victorious march to the Ganges and reflected his personality throughout the days of its eminence and continues to do so because of its great temple, though its role as a capital of the south has been forgotten by its inhabitants. It is now a small village, bounded in the west by the celebrated Gangai- kondan lake, one of the biggest lakes in south India, and by the river Vadavaru in the east. To the south and the north are fields with a few hamlets bearing names recalling their associations with the greatness of the city. A highway winding its way through this once great city runs north- south leading to the Lower Anicut, while another road cuts across the great lake east-west and connects this village with Jayamkondachu la puram, another Cho^ foundation about six miles to the west. The lofty tower of the great prdsdda could be seen from about a distance of six or seven miles. Besides the great temple and other ancient relics, inscriptions on the temple are our primary source of information for reconstructing the history of the city. Copper plate charters issued by Rajendra and his successors also give valuable information. A few Tamil literary works Uke the Thiruvisaippa of Karuvurdevar, the Kalingattup-parani of Jaj'amkondar, the Muvar Ula of Ottakkuttar, and the KoU Olugu furnish some data. The Sanskrit work, the Vikramankadeva Cbarita of Bilhana on the exploits of Vikramaditya VI, also throws some light. Records dealing with the Udaiyarpalaiyam zamin give some valuable information about the temple and the city. II Rajendra the Builder Gangaikonda ChSla Rajendra I, was the son of Rajaraja I through his queen, Vanavanmadevi, also called Tribhuvanamadevi, evidently a Chera princess. Ardra was the star of Rajendra’s nativity. Rajendra was a boy when Rajaraja ascended the throne in 985 A.D. Under the care and guidance of his father, he grew up as the most power- ful general in Tamil history. When once twenty years old, he led a Chola army into the heart of the Western Chalukya kingdom. He was then called Narmadi Chola Rajendra VidyMhara and the ornament of the Chola race. In this campaign Rajendra is said to have advanced as far north as Bijapur District with an army of 900,000 and as a result, terri- tories upto Rattapadi were annexed to the Chola empire. He is also identified with Pancavan Maraya, who served as the Mahadapdanayaka of the Vengi and Ganga countries. Between March 27th and July 7th, 1012 A.D., Rajendra was chosen heir apparent by Rajaraja. Rajendra jointly ruled with his father for nearly four years till 1016 A.D., when Rajaraja passed away. On the state of the empire at the time of Rajendra’s accession, Prof. K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, the greatest authority on Chola history, writes, “Rajendra inherited from his father an extensive empire compris- ing the whole of the modern Madras and Andhra and parts of Mysore and the island of Ceylon. The administration had been carefully organised and a fairly powerful bureaucracy brought into existence, which while it scrupulously respected the ‘hberties’ feudal and corporate, of the various magnates and associations that studded the land, successfully maintained the king’s peace and enforced all civil rights. The army was a strong and tried body of men, well able to defend the wide land frontier and to keep down any threatened outbreaks in areas newly subjected to the empire and ready for aggressive warfare abroad. The hold on Ceylon and some other islands like the Maidive islands was securely maintained by a powerful naval force which also served to protect the considerable overseas trade of the empire with the islands of the East Indies and with 3 China. During the thirty-three years of his reign, Rajendra turned these initial advantages to the best possible use and succeeded in raising the Che la empire to the position of the most extensive and most respected Hindu state of his time”. Rajendra fought many battles and won every one of them. For every victory he gained, he assumed a title commemorating his success. He also conferred titles on his victorious generals. The moment he assumed independent sovereignty, he embarked on a “conquest of the quarters’, the digvijaya. The western Chalukyas, were probably the first target of his attack. Rajendra conquered “Idaiturai-nadu, Banavasi, encircled by a continous hedge of forest, Kollipakkai whose ramparts were surrounded by sulli trees, and Mannaikkadakka whose fortifications were unapproachable, all in a single campaign, directed against Satyasraya the Ch^ukya ruler. Idaiturai-nadu was the country between the rivers Krishna in the north and Tungabhadra in the south comprising a large part of the present Raichur District.” KoUippakkai lies about 45 miles north-east of Hydera- bad and is now called Kulpak. Mannaikkadakkam is identified with Manyakheda (modern Malkhed). In this campaign, the Chola emperor, crossed the Tungabhadra and attacked the capital of the Chalukyas. After completing his successful expedition in the north (north being considered an auspicious direction, expeditions were first taken in that direction for ensuring victories) Rajendra started on a southern campaign in which he defeated the Pandyas, the Kerala ruler and finally the king of Ceylon. Of Rajendra’s southern campaign the Thiruvalangadu copper charter gives the following account. “This famous and heroic king, possessed of a powerful army, and bent upon the performance of meritorious deeds with heaps of money acquired by his own arm, then set his heart upon a digvijaya. “Accordingly, after arranging for the protection of his own capital, the unrivalled king Uttama-Cho la, first started in the direction marked by Trisanku (the south) desirous of conquering the Pandya king. “The commander dandandtha of the ornament of the solar race thereupon struck the Pandya king who had a great force; and the Pandya abandoned his home in fright and fled for refuge to the Malaya mountain, the abode of Agastya. 4 “Rajaraja’s son the master of policy, took possession of the bright spotless pearls, the seeds of the spotless fame of the Pandya kings. “After establishing there his own son Sri Chola Pandya for the protection of the Pandya country, the light of the solar race then procee- ded to the conquest of the West. “Having heard of the ignominy sustained by kings at the hands of Bhargava in battle, this proud king, finding him on the face of the earth, developed a desire to conquer the lands created by him. “Who else other than this supreme lord (Paramesvara) can enter- tain the thought in his mind of subjugating the ancient land protected by the glory of the ornament of the Bhrgukula and free from the inroads of enemies ? “The fearless Madhurantaka crossed the Sahya mountain and forthwith set upon the Kerala in great force and there ensued a fierce battle which brought ruins upon kings. “After having conquered the Kerala kings and harrowed the land guarded by the austerities of the lord of the Bhrigus, the prince returned to his capital, the abode of prosperity”. Both the Pandya and Kerala countries were placed under the voiceroyalty of his son who was crowned at Madurai, with the title Jata- varman Simdara-ChO.la Pandya. Rajendra is said to have built a palace at Madurai. The Chera king, Rajasimha, built a temple to Lord Vishnu at Mannarkoil, naming it Rajendra Ghola Vin^agar after Rajendra. Rajendra then invaded Ceylon. His father had defeated earlier Mahinda V and annexed a major part of Ceylon to the Chola empire and named it Mummudi-Chola Valantkiu with many subdivisions called Raja- raja Valanadu, Vikrama-cho la-valanadu etc. Rajondra’s expedition was thorough and complete. His Karandai plates record that “Rajendra con- quered the king of Ceylon with a fierce army and seized his territory, his queen, and her crown, his daughter, all his wealth, his transport, and the spotless garland of Indra, and crown of the Pandya left in his charge; after having lost the battle and being shorn of his queen, son and other belongings, the king of Ceylon, out of fear, came and sought the two feet of Rajendra as shelter”. The Ceylonese chronicle, Mahavamsa confirms this account and 5 states that with Pulattinagara as base the Cholas held sway over Raja ratta as far as the locality known as Rakkhapasanakanta .... king Mahinda dwelt twelve years in the Ch?5 la land and entered into heaven in the forty-eighth year (from his ascent of the throne)”. Probably Rajendra personally headed his array and brought the entire island of Ceylon under Cho la rule. Towards the end of his reign however, there was an uprising in south Cejdon which was dealt with by his able son. Rajadhiraja I. Rajendra next sent his celebrated expedition to the Gangetic plain to bring holy waters to purify his own land, after inflicting crushing defeats on all enemy forces upto Bengal. His Thiruvalahgadu copper charter states that “the light of the solar race (Rajendra), mocking Bhagiratha who by the force of his austerities caused the descent of the Gan^a.set out to sanctify his own land with the waters of that stream brought by the strength of his arm. “He seized Sakkarakottam, who.se warriors were brave; Madura- mandalara destroyed in a trice, the prosperous city of Xamanaikkonam with its dense groves, Pancapaj.ji who.se warriors bore cruel bows, Masuni- desa with its green fields, a large heap of family treasures together with many other treasures which he carried away after capturing the Indra- ratha of the ancient race of the moon together with his family in a fight which took place at Adinagar; a city whose great fame knew no decline, Oddavisaya which was difficult of approach on account of its dense forest defence; the good Kosalainadu, where Brahmins assembled; Tandabhutti, in whose gardens bees abounded, after having destroyed Dhammapala in a hot battle; Takkanaladatn whose fame reached all directions and which he occupied after forcefully attacking Ranasura; Vangaladesa where the rain water n“ver stopped and from which Govindachandra fled, having descended from his male elephant; elephants of rare strength, women and treasure which he seized after having been pleased to put to flight in a hot battlefield the strong Mahipala by the sound of a conch from the deep sea; Uttaraladara on the shores of the expansive ocean producing pearls and the Ganga whose waters bearing fragrant flowers dashed against the bathing places”. Rajendra’s father had integrated the Eastern Chalukya kingdom of Vengi politically and dynastically with the Chola line. As a result of Rajendra’s expedition all the countries north of Vengi, which included Kalinira. Odcla. Southern Kosala, the lower and upper Lilda and finally the Vangrdadesa (Bengal) were made to bow before the might of this Cho la emperor. Riiiendra himself went npto the banks of the Godavari, where hi- awaited the return of his trium;)liaut army, which brought Ganges water in golden ves.sel.s, carried on the heads of the vanquished riders. Almost a thousand years before Rajendra, a Chera king of the Sangam age, Senguttuvan had marched upto the Himalayas with an army to bring a stone to carve an image of Goddess Pattini. which he enshri- ned in a tem]de erected for the purpo.se. Two northern kings are said to have opposed Senguttuvan’s march, but they were vanquished in a trice and made to carry the stone on their head. This account is recorded in the Silappadhikaram. Some critics doubt its authenticity. But Rajendra’s expedition was an important landmark. According to R.D. Banerjce, \"the invasion of the great southern conqueror, Rajendra Cho la I, seems to have left a permanent mark in Bengal. Some obscure Karnata chief seems to have followed Rajendra and settled in West Bengal. From him was descended Samantasena. who is generally taken to be the founder of the Sena dynasty”. To commemor.vte this celebrated victory, Rajendra assumed the title of flanoaikontja Chula, a name given not only to his new capital ((.langaikondachblapuram) but akso to his temple. Th.> conquest of the overseas i.sl-md of Sumatra and the 3Ialay Peninsula forms the most important event in the life of Rajendra and perhaps in tlm anniN of South Indian historv. This triumphant naval expedition was directeil auainst the ruler of Srlvijaya who also held sway over Kadaram. Ililj.traja had cordial relations with Srlmara Vi jayottufiga- varman. the ruler of Srivijaya who visited the Cho la country and erected a Buddhi.st vihara in the name of his father for which Rajaraja gifted lands and money. After his father's death Rajendra confirmed the grant to this \\’ihara. But the relationship became strained sub.sequently. Either the flourishing overseas trade of Cholas was obstructed or Rajendra having conquered the countries in the north, west, and south wished to concpier the east, to conijilete hi.s >lir/njqi/a. The Xicobar islands, the upper and lower Sumatran islands known a.s Thimuridesa, Srivijaya, Singapore, the Malay jieninsnla and the lower part of Burma were subjugated. A number of pla.-es where he fought are detailed in Rajendra’s Tamil inseription.s. ‘Raji'ndra having despatched many ships in the midst of the rolling sea and having caught Sangrama Vijayottiiiiga Varman, the king of Kadaram, together with the elefihaTits in his glorious army, took the large heap of treasuries which that king had rightfully accumulated, captured with noise, the arch called Vidyadhara torana at the war-gate of his extensive city. Srivijaya with the jewelled wicked gate adorned with great splendour and the gate of large jcvels; Pannai with water in its bathing ghats; the ancient Malaiyilr with the strong mountain for its rampart; Mayirutlingam surrounded hv the deep sea as by a moat; Ilangasdka (Lankilsoka) undaunted in tierce battles; Majiiialam having abundant deep water as defence; ilavelimbangam having fine wails as defence; X’alaippandiiru having Va laippandilru: Talaittakkolarn praised by great men (v'ersed in) the sciences; MadamiTlingam, firm in great and fierce battles; Ilamuridesam whose fierce sttamLdh rose in war; .Manakkav arain in whose evt -nsive dower gardens honev' was collecting; and Kadaram of fierce strength wliich was protected by the deep .scfi’. For a detai!(‘d account of Rajendra's comjuest of K;\\daram and the identification of the various battlefields of the campaign, the reader may icfei- to Prof. K. A. Xil.ikanta Sa.stri’s ‘diu' Cholas’. To commemorate his signal victories Rajeiidra assumed the title of Kaclaramkondachdla. Rajendra thus completed a brilliant rUr/riJai/n “conquest of quai ters'. which made him a ( 'hakravarti. “The closing years of Rajendra's reign formed the most splendid period of the history of the Cholas of the X’ijayalaya line. The extent of the empire was at its widest and its military and naval prestige stood at its highest. There remained the necessity ever present in military em{)ires of carrying out punitive expeditions to suppress out breaks and keep the conquered territories under control. The emperor was ably assisted by his talented sons and other members of his family and the tasks of imperial administration were thus put in commission”. Rajendra had many titles like Madhurantaka, Uttaniacho la, Virachula, Mudikondachola, Panditachola, Gangaikondacho la. Gan- gaivum Pilrvadesamum Kadjtramum konda Ayyan. He had manv queens of whom Vanav’anmadevi, Mukkokilan, Pancav*anmadevi and X iramaJevi doservo mention. The last mentioned entered the funeral pyre with her husband at his death. Ill Later history The first Chola king to be crowned at Gahgaikondacholapuram was Rajakesari Rajadhiraja I, the eldest son of Rajendra I. Ho had been installed as crown prince verj’ early in Rajendra’s reign (1018 A.T).) and till his death in 1054, he led a life of warfare. He is probably identi- cal with Sundara ChO^ Pandya. who was installed as the viceroy of the Pandya country in his father’s reign. He quelled a rebellion in Ceylon, conquered a Pandya who fomented trouble, and dealt severely with the ruler of V'enad. In the north he led three e.xpeditions against the Chalukj'as, ransacked Kalyiinapura, their capital, and captured Kollapura. To commemorate this victory ho assumed the title, Kalyanapuramum. Kollapuramum konda Vijayarajendra. A few sculptures of exceptional beauty were brought by him as war trophies from Kalyanapura. One of the sculptures bears an inscription recording the fact that it was brought by Vijayarajendra from Kalyanapur.i after its con(]uest. Evidently, the sculptures of Durga, Oanes-i, and the solar pitha now in Gangaikonda cholapuram, was also brought home. Rajadhiraja performed the asva- medha, to celebrate his signal victories. In 10.54. at an advanced age, he led his army against the Chalukyas and fought a battle at Koppam, on the banks of the Tungabhadra. Raj^hiraja was mortally wounded while seated on his elephant. The Chola array fell into disarray and began to retreat in great confusion. The Chalukya army pressed forward with great force. Raj^hiraja s younger brother, Rajendra IT, who was sta- tioned behind, marched forwartl at great risk. The Chola array regrouped itself and followed its master. R.ajendra was wounded in the thigh and lQ.st some of his close associates. Nothing daunted, Rajendra moved for- ward. killing many able Chalukya generals. The Chalukya army was shattered. Somesvara, the Chalukya king, fled. Many able Chalukva war- riors lost their life or were taken prisoners. Thus Rajendra converted an almost imminent defeat into a brilliant success. As if to commemorate this brilliant success, Rajendra crow ned himself king on the battlefield, while his wounds were still fresh on his body Thus the second son of Rajendra I was crowned not at tlangaikon acholapuram. his capital. y but on the battlefield. Rajadhiraja came tf) be called the older brother who lost his life on an elephant’. Rajondra IT was .succeeded by his younger brother \\\"irarajcndra, who also w^on victories over the (’haluk^'a after winning a deci.sive battle against the Kalyani (diajukya, Vikramaditya. \\’irarajendra gave hi.s daughter in marriage tf) him. The earliest epigraph found on the temple belongs to the reign of Virarajendra. The epigraj)h records the issue of orders by Virarajendra confirming the gifts made by his father Rajendra I, and elder brother Rajadhiraja I. After Virarajendra passed away, his son Adhirajendra ascended the throne. He was quite friendly with his brother-in-law. Adhirajendra was a weak ruler, while Vikramaditya was shrewed and able. The trained and .seasoned Chola generals saw a danger to the Chola empire in this alliance. Th'^y refused to accej)t Adhirajendra. The Cholas always chose not the eldest son, but the ablest as their successors. The Chola generals were guided by this principle. But Vikramaditya came to the rescue of Adhirajendra. .M.irching on Kaiichi, he punisheil those who rebelled there and reaching Gangaikoiifj.acholapuram, crowned his brother- in-law as Chola king. He stayed there for two months to make the posi- tion of Adhirajendra secure and then returned to his capital. As soon as Vikramaditya left Gangaikondacholapuram, the Chola generals reltelled and in the uprising Adhirajendra lost his life. Aramahgadevi, a daughter of Rajendra J was married to the Eastern Chalukya ruler. Kaj.iraja Nart-ndra. Their son was named Rajendra, the future Kulottuhga. From Kalihgattupparani, a heroic poem composed on him by Ja\\ Mihkonfjar. it is learnt that Kulottunga was born and brought up in tkingiikondacholapuram. He had his education, military and other training .and was crowned Yuvaraja by Virarajendra at G.angaikondacholapuram. At the time of the uprising, at Gangaikondacholapuram Kulottuhga was wagina: <i war in the north. He at once ru.shed to Gangaik’.-nd.ichb Iapu“ani. The Chola generals found in him a capable ruler, crownefl him Chola emperor in the name of Kulottuhga. He immediately restorcfl peace in the kingdom. .V fragmentary inscription mentioning his mother Aramahgadevi is preserved in the Gangaikondacho lapuram temple. One of his inscriptions is also found in the temple. It refers to a gift of land to some other temple. An inscription dated in his 4l8t regnal year, in the temple gives the prasasti of a Gahadavala king of Kanauj. The inscription does not 10 give the name of the ruler or the nature of gift, as it is left unfinished. But according to K. A. N. Sastri it should be assigned to either Madana- pala or his son, Govindachandra of Kanauj. It points to some dynastic connection between the Gahadavalas and the imperial Cholas. The Kalihgattupparani a contemporary poem on Kulottuhga refers to Gangai- kondacho lapuram as Gangapuri. Gangaikondacho lapuram continued to be the capital of the successors of Kulottuhga. Thus Vikrama Cho la, Kulottuhga II, Rajaraja II, Rajadhiraja II and Kulottuhga III retained it as their capital. There are a few fragmentary records of Kulottuhga III in the temple. Kulottuhga III was the last of the great Chola emperors. He won signal victories against Ceylon, Madurai, and Karuvur (the Cheras) and assumed the title of Conqueror of Madurai, Karuvur and I lam. However, towards the close of his reign, the dynamic Maravarman Sundara Pandya humiliated him. He invaded the Chola country and razed Tanjore and Urandai to the ground and performed the Virabhisheka at Ayirattali and reached as far as Chidambaram. It is not known whether Sundara Pandya captured Gangaikondacho lapuram. At any rate, it is not mentioned in his inscriptions. The humiliation marked the beginning of the decline and fall of the Chola empire and with it of the Chola capital. Kulottuhga III did not live long after this defeat and was succeeded by an inefficient son Rajaraja III. The latter was driven out of his capital by the Pandya and tried to escape to the north to join the Kuntalas, (the Hoysalas of Mysore) but was intercepted by the Pallava chieftain, Kop- perunjihga probably at Tellaru where Rajaraja was made a captive. Hoy- sala Narasimha succesfully intervened and defeated the Pandya in the south. Hoysala generals captured Kopperunjihga’s territory and released the Chola. Rajaraja III was recrowned at Gangaikondacho lapuram. It is not known whether the city suffered on account of these wars. However the contemporary works speak of Mudikondacho lapuram as the Chola capital. Probably Riijaraja III had a preference for that place though Gangaikondacho Iap»iram continued to be of importance. Jatavarman Sundara, w'ho ascended the Pandya throne in 1251, conquered territories upto Nellore and kept the Cho las under subjection. Probably the Cho la was paying tribute to him. One of Sundara’s ins- criptions is found in the Gangaikondacho lapuram temple dated in his second regnal year. Evidently, he captured the city in his very first regnal year. Sundara established a special worship named after him in the 11 temple. Vikrama, who shared the Pandya throne with him, has left an inscription in the temple. Sundara was succeeded by Maravarman Kulasekhara, another able ruler in 1268 A.D. He defeated and probably killed the last Chola Rajendra III, in Kannanur in 1279. Gangaikondacho lapuram was included in his dominion and two inscriptions of him are found in the temple. After the death of Kulasekhara, in 1310 the Tamil country was invaded by Malik Kafur, a Muslim general and there was anarchy and confusion for a 3’oar. The Pandya hold on Gangaikondacho lapuram seems to have been weakened though they continued to hold sway in a nominal way over this part of the country. In 1 36.\"), Kumara Kampana, the Vijayanagara viceroy marched as far as Ramesvaram and brought the southern country under his control. There are no records of any of the Vijayanagara rulers till 1463, nearly a hundred years after Kampana’s conquest. There is a record of Thiruven- gaciamuflaiyan Ekaniranatha Gahgeyan dated 1463, who probably was a subordinate of the Vijayanagara ruler Mallikarjuna. An inscription of Praiida Viruj)aksha, the son of Mallikarjuna dated in 1483, is in the temple. This proves that Gangaikondacho lapuram was in the Vijaya- nagara empire. An inscription of Krishnadeva, in Tirthanagari (South Arcot) dated in 1517, records that the king gifted tax-free lands to many Siva and Vishnu temples in the Cholamandalara. Gangaikonda- cho lapuram temple is amongst them. In the early part of 16th century Gangaikondacho lapuram was brought under the Udaiyarpalalyam subdivision which became the seat of Arasukavalar, also called poligar. They wore local chieftains who acted as the subordinates of the Vijayasiagar emperors. They wore to keep hi perpetual readiness certain number of elephants, cavalry and foot soldiers to march against any army wheti c.alled upon. For this purpose they were allotted certain revenue from a number of villages, assigned to them. Gangaikondacho lapuram thus became a part of Udaiyarpalalyam sub- division. After the fall of the Vbjayanagar empire, the poligar of Udaiyar palaiyam continued to hold an important position in the area. In 1756 the French invaded Udaiyarpalalyam and forced the Poligar to pay a tribute of 40,000 Rupees. In 1765, the Nawab assisted by a party of English attacked the forts of Udaiyarpalalyam. During these battles, 12 (iansaikoncliicliolapnriim tofnplo was probably used as a fort and considerably suffered daniay<‘. Tlie bastions now found outside the enclosure walls in the west were probably erected during these wars. The district of Thiruchirappalli was handed over to the British East Tndia Company in 1801 when the poliyar of Udaiyarpalaiyam was paid an allowance of Rs. 1000. The estate was brought under the manage- ment of an agent of the Nawab. In 1817 the British Government restored a portion of the Polliam to the Poligar subject to a nominal Peshkist and gave him a zamindari sunnad. However Gangaikonda cholapurarn was c.vcluded from it. The greatest damage to the temple was done in 1836, when a dam was erected across the Collidam about seven miles from the temple. For the supply of stones of the construction, some vandal mem- bers of the public works department pidled down the enclosure walls, the dilapidated gopura, the front and great mandapa and carried away the stones. An interesting account published in a local publication of 1855 and reproduced in the Indian Antitjuary IV, page 274. states that ‘speaking of the noble temple of (iangaikondacholapuram it must not be omitted that when the lower Kolerun anikat was biult, the structure was dismantled of a large part of the splendid granite sculptures which adorned it and the enclosing wall was almost wholly destroyed in order to obtain materials for the work. The poor people did their utmost to prevent this destruc- tion and sp<ulation of a venerate<l edifice by the servants of a government that could show no title to it; but of course without success; they were only punished for contempt. A promise was made indeed that a wall of brick should be built in place of the stone wall that was pulled down; but un- happily it must be recorded that this promise has never been redeemed.’ IV The city then and now There is an interesting reference in the SiJappadhikaram. a [)osf Sahgam classic, to the foundation of Uraiyur as a capita) of the ChOlas of the Sahgam age. A cock is said to have attacked and chased away an elephant at Uraiyur. This inspired the f'hnla king to make Uraiyur his Metropolis, for he believed that the inhabitants of that place would be heroic and valorous as the cock. .A similar story of a rabbit chasing away a hound i.s tokl of the foundation of Pahchalanikurichi. the capital of Virapandiya Kattabomman. who defied the British in late 18th century A. D. [f these traditions are of any value, they indicate that ■\\ place which inspired a ruler to atta'ti phenomenal success, was honoured by being made capit.%1 of the rider, who cherished senti- mental attachment to it. Only thus can we explain for the foundation of fiangaikonclachb lapuram, the capital of the imperial t^hblas from the eleventh century. fTangaikondachb lapuram was unheard of even as a village when Rajendra I came to the f’hola throne. Tanjavur had been the ('ho la capital eversiiice it had been captured from the Muttaraiya f'hieftains by V’ijayalaya, who founded the imperial line of the C'holas in the middle of ninth century .A. D. Tanjavur serverl the interests <»f the Cholas well. It was well fortified and adorned with palace.s aiul mansions; it was there that Rajaraja I had built the great t«*mple; it was from there that he had brought for the first tiine the entire southern India under one parasol. Yet within few years of the erection of the great temple and within few years of his pa.ssing. his son. Rajendra shifted his capital to Uangaikondachojapuram. W as this because (iaiigaikondacho lapuram serve<l strategic purpo.ses better than Tanjavur (but Tanjavur had better claims with its fortifications and natural river barriers) ( \\o answer is possible except for a suggestion that it was probably here that Rajendra resolved to despatch a military expedition to the (iangetic plain. 14 The city of Gan)Efaikon4acholapuram was probably founded by Raj endra before his 17th regnal year as it is mentioned in one of his inscrip- tions of that year. Judging from the available literature and the remains we may conclude that it was an extensive city, carefully planned and laid in accordance with the architectural treatises to suit the needs of a capi- tal, rdjadhdni. The city seems to have had two fortifications, one inner and the other outer. The outer was probably wider. The villagers point to a mound running all around the palace as the outer fortification. Systematic brick robbing has been going on in this place. It is probable that the outer fortification built of burnt bricks, was about six to eight feet wide. It ccjnsisted of two walls, the intervening space (the core) being filled with sand. The bricks are fairly large in size and are made of well burnt clay. A fortification at this place called Rdjendra ChOlan Madil (the fort wall named Rajendra Chbla) evidently after the builder, is mentioned in an inscription. This fortification might be identical with this outer wall. The inner fortification was around the royal palace, probably identical with the Utpadni rlttu madil of the inscriptions. The royal palace also was built of burnt brick. The ceilings were covered with flat tiles of small size, laid in a number of courses, in fine lime mortar. The pillars were probably made of polished wood, supported on granite bases, a few pillar bases have survived to this day. Iron nails and clamps have been recovered from this palace site. In the reign of Virarajendra, Rajendra’s third son, the palace at ( iangaikontlacholapuram is referred to as Chbla-Keralan Thirumaligai ((’ho la Keralan palace) evidently after one of the titles of Rajendra I. The same inscription mentions a few parts of the palace as ddihhumi (the ground floor). KildisOjifhia (the eastern portico), and a seat named MdvuH vdnddhi- luiftn. Kvidently the palace was multistoried. In an inscription dated in the 49th year of Kulottuhga (1119 A.D.) reference is made to Gangai- kondacho lamaiigai at this place. It is likely that there were more than one royal building each having its own name. Besides the names of the palace and fort walls, the names of a few roads and streets are preserved in the epigraphs. Two entryways named Thiruvdsal. the eastern gate and the Vembugudi gate, evidently the south gate leading to the village Vembugudi situated in that direction are mentioned. Reference is also found to highways named after Rajaraja and Rajendra as Rdjardjan Penivali and Rdjendrnn Pert/vnli. Other streets mentioned in epigraphs are the ten streets (Pattute.ru), the gateway lane (Thiruvdsal Ndrdsam) and the Suddhamali lane. Probably in the reign of Kulottuhga, the fortifications were renewed and the city underwent some alterations and additions. An epigraph refers to the fort wall of Kulottuhga C!hola (KulOttungn OhOlan Thirumadil). The inscription also refers to the highways, KulOttungachdlan ThirvumdH pnuvali, Vildngndniydn Pervvali and Kulaiydnai p6na Peruvali (the highway through which a short elephant passed by). The strengthening of the fortification and additions to the city in the reign of Kulbttuhga I were probably necessitated by the upris- ing which led to the murder of ChOla king Adirajendra, Kulottimga’s predecessor. The epigraphs also refer to the Madhurantaka V’adavaru. now called the Vadavaru, running about three miles east of the ruined capital. Madhurantaka Vadavaru evidently named after one of the titles of Rajendra I, was a source of irrigation to a vast stretch of land bordering the capital. An irrigation channel called Anaivettuvdn (destroyer of elephants) Kdl is also mentioned. There were both wet and dry lands inside the Fort, used for cultivation and other purposes. The present positions of the existing temples throw some hght on the lay out of the city. With the palace as the centre to the city, the great temple, and the other teniple.s in the city seem to have been erecterl. Towards the north-east (ladnya) of the palace is the gaeat temple of ^iva. The Siva temple accord- ing to Vastu and Agamic texts should be in the north-east of the city or village and should face east. Till recent times, the local ])eo|>l.‘ .say an image of N’ishnu with his consorts was in aitn to tiie west of the palace. The temple of Vishnu should be in the west. To the soutii-east of the palace is a temple dedicated to Aiyanar (.Sasta). (Jbviously there should have e.\\isted other temples as prescribeti in traditional treatises A few village-, lying mostly to the east of the temple bear names , that recall their association with the original layout of the city. Thus V’^iracholapuram, Kollapuram. Meykavalputhiir, V^avanallur. V’lrabhSgha etc., are of interest. A number of small tanks and ponds mentioned in inscriptions and retained in tradition, supplied drinking w.iter to tiie residents. l)e.sides a ntimber of wella. Most of the ChD la kings who succeeded Rajendra were crowned liere. They retained it as their capital, reoriented and trained the efficient ChOla army. This capital of the most powerful empire in Asia at one time is now absolutely desolate only the temple of GangaikondachS la survives. To those who know of the brilliant history of the Oho la oinpire it is a tragedy. VV'hat caused the destruction of this city? The Pandyas who put an end to the Oho la empire late in the 13th century, avenging their earlier defeats at the hands of the Cholas, should have razed the city to the ground, a misfortune that befell on capitals in early times. It should have remained a heap of brick debris, the inhabitants of the nearby villages pilfering the bricks for their constructions. The people have also dug systematically deep into the ground and extracted cartloads of ancieiit bricks, at four annas per cartload. The residents boast that within a radins of five miles, no brick kilo is needed. V The temple (A) Architecture The temple of Gangaikondachollsvara is approached through the northern entrance from the road. The passage passes through the enclo- sure wall and leads on to the inner court. As one steps in, the great Vimdna arrests the visitor’s sight. The Vimdna with its recessed comers and upward movement presents a striking contrast to the straight- sided pyramidal tower of Tanjavur. As it rises to a height of 160 feet and is shorter than the Tanjavur tower, it is often described as the feminine counterpart of the Tanjavur temple. The Vimdna is flanked on either side by small temples; the one in the north now housing the Goddess is fairly well preserved. The small shrine of Chandikesvara is near the steps in the north. In the north-east are a shrine housing Durga, a well called lion- well (simhakeni) with a lion figure guarding its steps and a late mundapa housing the office. Nandi is in the east facing the main shrine. In the same direction is the ruined gdpura, the entrance tower. The main tower surrounded by little shrines truly presents the appearance of a great Chakravarti (emperor) surrounded by chieftains and vassals. The Gangaikondacholapurara Vimdna is undoubtedly a devdlaya chakravarti, an emperor among temples of South India. The enclosure Though the temple of Gangaikondacho lapuram follows the plan of the great temple of Tanjavur in most details it has an individuality of its own. Prom the remains it may be seen that it had only one enclosure wall and a gSpura while the Tanjavur temple has two gSpuras and enclosures. The prdkdra follows the Tanjavur lay-out in that it had a two storeyed cloister running all aroimd. Only a part of this h as survived in the north. The stones from the other portions were utilised to build the Lower Anaicut across the Kollidam. The pillars of cut stone are severely plain throughout as in Tanjavur. They have no inscription unlike at Tanjavur. The courtyard is 566’9” in length and 318'6“ width and has a transept at the west in line with the main sanctum. The cloister has a raised platform, 18’ in height. At regular intervals, bases for shrines are noticed. 18 These shrines should have resembled the prdkdra shrines of Tanjavur and in all probability housed the images of the eight directional deities, in their appropriate quarters as in Tanjaviir. However none of the images have survived. Evidently the prdkdra has been laid out in the traditional Vastu grid system called Vdstupadavinydsa. The Gopura The entrance tower, the superstructure of which has completely fallen down, is located in the east. It measures about 68' x 46' with a 12' entry way. It followed in pattern the outer gSpura of the Tanjavur temple, with no sculptures on its base except for the Dvarapalas. The stones from the ruined gopura were removed to construct the dam mentioned earlier. In the temples of Tanjavur, Darasuram and Tribhu- vanam, there are two gSpuras, the outer being taller than the inner. But in Gangaikondacholapuram there is only one g&pura, at the east. Besides this eastern entrance an entrance is provided in the northern enclosure, which now serves as the main entry on account of its proximity to the main road. Dr. James C. Harle in his excellent work the ‘ Temple gateways in South India ’ states that “the gopura of the great temple at Gangaikonda- cholapuram (A.D. 1030) belongs as far as one can teU in its present ruined state to the same early phase of development as the Tanjavur gdpuras. It w'as neither as large or as complex, however, as the Tanjavur gOpuras. On plan, the whole edifice forms a rectangle approximately 60 feet by 33 feet. Large dvarapalas were placed on the outer facade. One of them now lies on the ground in front of the gOpura and measures at- least seven feet. The unique dvnra, as at Tanjavur, is on the outerside of the entryway. The vestibules have two storeys, divided by a crude and massive architrave; in the lower, an exposed stair is built against the back wall; above a doorway in the same wall may have led either to another stairwaj' or to a circumambulatory corridor.” Dr. Harle further states that an early photograph (photo No. 2452 Indian Museum, Calcutta' shows the three upper storeys of the gdpura, in a dilapidated condition. A fairly large size bull is found on a pedestal inside the court, facing the main sanctum. It is made up of fallen stones and stucco. It is not known whether the original one was monolithic. A bali pitha is found east of Nandi. 19 The building to the north of Nandi, called Alankdra mandapa, and now housing the executive office of the temple was in all probability con- structed in the 1 9th century. The Simhakeni To the north of this mandapa is a circular well with steps provi- ded at the western end. The entrance of the steps is adorned with a lion figure which has given the name to the well. According to tradition Rajendra poured a part of the Ganges water, brought from his famous expedition, into the well, to sanctify it. An inscription on the lion sculp- ture, in 19th century characters, records that it was constructed by the Zamindar of Udaiyarpalaiyam. The Mahishasuramardini Shrine To the west of the lion-well is a shrine dedicated to the Goddess, Mahishasuramardini. The shrine is a later structure (probably built in 14- loth Century) and did not form part of the original layout. It con- sists of a sanctum preceded by a mandipa. The Goddess installed in the sanctum is similar to a Durga found at Veerareddi street, in the same village and is in all likelihood. Chalukyan in origin. The Southern Kailasa The shrine, south of the main Vimdnn and called the southern Kailasa has a sanctum preceded by a rnand ipa which in turn is fronted by flights of steps from south and north of which the basement alone remains. The outer walls of the sanctum and the front mandapa carry niches, housing images. The niches of the sanctum carry Dakshina- murthi in the south and Lingodhbhava in the west, while the niche on the north is empty. The niches on the front mandapa carry in the south Ganesa, Nataraja, Bhikshatana, and Subrahmanya and in the north, Gaunprasada, Durga, Ardhanari and Bhirava. The inner sanctum of the shrine is now in ruins. A little to the north-east of this temple is a granite basement, probably the ruin of a mandapa. It is now called the Alankdra mandapa. To the west of this is a well, probably coeval with the temple. To the south-west of the main temple, is a small shrine dedicated to Ganesa. It has a sanctum preceded by a mandapa. The structure could be assigned to the 13th century on stylistic grounds. 20 The temple of Goddess (Northern Kailasa) To the north of the main temple is a small shrine now housing the Goddess, Brhannayaki, the consort of Lord Gangaikopdacho lisvara. The temple, as mentioned earlier, resembles the southern Kailasa in every aspect and is called Uttara Kailasa. It has a sanctum, preceded by a front mandapa, provided with side-steps. In front of this is a bigger mandapa (mahdmandapa), which is well preserved, unlike its southern counterpart. The niches on the sanctum and the front mandapa carry the same sculptures as in the southern Kailua. Thus Ganesa, Katara^a, Bhikshatapa, Subrahmanya, Dakshinamurti, Lingodhbhava, Brahma, Bhairava, Ardhanari, Durga, and Gauriprasada are noticed in order, from the south, while in the southern Kailasa, the northern niche of the garbhagrha is empty, a sculpture of bearded Brahma is noticed in this temple. Two gatekeepers flank the entrance. In front of the gatekeepers, in the mahdmandapa, are images of Saraswati in the north and Gajalakshmi in the south. These two Goddesses, Lakshmi and Saraswati, occupy the same position in the main temple and also in the great temple of Tanjavur. They occupy these positions to suit some ritual needs. It is signiflcant that the mahdmandapa has steps to it only on the side. In ancient times, steps were always provided on the sides and not in front of the sanctum. The beautiful image of Goddess now enshrined in the sanctum of this temple should be a later instalation. Originally the temple should have enshrined a Siva Linga, hke the southern Kailua. Though seperate shrines for Goddesses came to be built in the main temples only from the reign of Rajendra I, no Devi-shrine was built originally in this temple, the present one being clearly a later institution. The Chandike^vara shrine The little temple to the north-east of the central shrine enshrining Chandikesvara, the steward of Siva temple is of interest. It is an all stone temple built on a raised basement, with a storeyed superstructure. The sanctum is approached by side steps. Inside the sanctum is an image of Chandikesvara, coeval with the temple. The outer walls of this sanctum have niches on all the three sides, carrying sculptures of Chandi- kesvara. He is the principal subsidiary deity in ^iva temples and till about 13th century A.D. all transactions relating to the temple were made in his name. Hence a separate shrine is provided for him in the temple complex. This shrine is coeval in time with the main temple. 21 The main temple The main temple consists of a sanctum tower called Sri Vimdna or Sri k5il, a big rectangular mandapa called the mahdmandapa with an intervening vestibule called mukhamandapa. The Sri Vimdna consists of the following parts beginning with the lowest basement. 1. The basement (upa-pttka) 2. The base (adhiahtdna) 3. The wall (bhitti) 4. The roof cornice (prastara) 5. The garland of miniature shrines (hdra) 6. The storeys {tala or bhumi) 7. The neck (griva) 8. The crown {sikhara) and 9. The finial {atupi). According to architectural treatises, basements (upa-pithaa) are intro- duced in temples to increase the height of the main tower; to add to struc- tural stability and to make the temple tower majestic. That these purposes are magnificently fulfilled by the basements of both the Tanjavur temple and GangaUcondacho lapuram temple, may be noticed even by a casual visitor not conversant with architectural principles. Besides the purposes mentioned above, the basement also provides, a space to walk around the tower. In this temple, the basement is ornamented with sculptures of lions and leogriffs with lifted paws. The main base adhiahtdna is decorated with well defined courses, consisting of the lotus moulding adaspadma, and the kumuda moulding, topped by a frieze of leogriflFs and riders. This constitute the main base, the top of which forms the flooring level of the inner sanctum. That portion of the structure rising above the main base up- to the roof cornice is called ‘the wall’ {bhitti or kdl). It is the principal element that encases the main sanctum and carries on it a number of niches housing various deities. The wall in this temple is divided into two horizontal courses by an intervening cornice. The lower and upper courses have an equal number of niches, on all the three sides except the front. On the vertical axis the wall surfaces are well defined by inter- vening recesses forming a rectangle in the centre and squares at the corners. Each is made up of a central niche housing a deity, flanked by a group of small sculptures which in turn are flanked by pilasters simulat- ing pillars. Thus each niche housing a deity appears as a miniature shrine. The recessed walls in the lower courses carry a vase and pilaster ornamentation, while on the upper courses, there are small niches hous- ing deities. Thus there are five principal deities in the lower course and nine deities in the upper course on each side. Since the mukhamandapa abutts the eastern wall, only one niche is retained in the lower course. On either side of the eastern wall, the upper course retains the principal niche at the comers and smaller niches at the recessed walls. The sculptures in the lower courses, of the Sri Vimdna depict various aspects of ^iva and also the subsidiary deities who include Ganesa, Vishnu, Subrahmanya, Durga, Brahma, and Bhairava, supplemented by Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Durga in the niches of the great mandapa. The sculptures were made separately and fitted into the niches. They are flanked by a group of small sculptures, carved in situ, illustrating the theme the niche sculpture seeks to represent. The sculptures on the upper courses repre- sent, besides some aspects of ^va, the guardian deities of the eight quar- ters. The roof comice consists mainly of three parts: (a) the frieze of dwarfs at the bottom, (b) the cornice forming the outer edge of the ceiling roof proper and, (c) the frieze of leogriffs on the top. The cornice is decorated with plain spade-like ornamentation topped by the head of a leogriflF. A row of miniature shrines runs around the tower like a garland, and is called a hdra. It consists of square pavilions at the corners, rectangular pavilions in the middle, with a nest (nida) ornamentation in between. Above this rise the main tower, consisting of nine stories includ- ing the ground floor. The upper stories of the main tower carry the same type of ornamentation, consisting of square and oblong pavilions except a change; the central wagon- shaped paviUon is flanked by square ones instead of “the nests\", the whole being projected forward than the rest. This is a change from the Tanjavur tower, which presents a pyramidal appearance without the central projection. 23 The neck is provided with four niches in the cardinal directions and bulls at the corners. The niches are topped by arch-like embellish- ment called klrtimukhaa. The globular element on the top called Sikhara is according to tradition, made of one stone weighing many tonnes. But, in fact, it is made of many pieces of cut stones dressed for the purpose, as may be seen from the portion where the plaster has fallen down. The finial, stvipi is a metal vase with a lotus-bud design at the top. It is gilded with gold and is said to carry an inscription named after Nallakka-tola-udayar, a Poligar of Udayarpalaiyam. It is not known whether the stupi is the original one and probably guilded by the Poligar or is a new one gifted by him. The sanctum enshrining the main deity, is encased by an inner wall. Between the inner wall and the outer, there is an intervening passage- called adndhdra running all around. The two walls are joined at the top by a series of corbelling. They are provided to support the massive super- structure. In the great temple of Tanjavur, the outer walls have openings in the centre leading into the intervening passage. Facing the openings are sculptures of deities. The inner faces of the passage are painted with scenes depicting exploits of ^iva and his devotees. But in the temple of Gangaikondacho lapuram, no painting is noticed in the inner passage. The central openings and corresponding sculptures, are also not found here. This inner passage around the sanctum is also found on the first floor. In the Tanjavur temple the inner wall of this passage carries 108 poses of dancing ^iva, of which 83 are fully finished and the rest are incomplete. But in Gangaikondacho Upuram no such sculptural representation is noticed. The inner sanctum, houses a very big ^iva Linga, rising to a height of thirteen feet. It is said to be the biggest Siva Linga enshrined in a sanctum in any South Indian temple. The entrance to the sanctum is guarded by massive doorkeepers, dvdrapdlaa. The mandapa immediately proceeding the sanctum is approached by steps leading to it from the north and the south sides and also from the great mandapa in the east. The entrances are guarded by big dvarapalas of remarkable beauty. The mar^apa ia supported by massive plain and square pillars. The eastern walls flanking the opening to the 24 gieat mandapa carrj' groups of small sculptures illustrating Saivite themes. The following are the the ues thus represented. The <;piso(le of Havana travelling in his chariot;’ shaking the Kailasa mountain; 'iva seated with Uma, pressing the mountain with his toe; Havana’s anguish under the weight of the mountain and finally ^iva bestowing boons on Havana, are depicted in three panels The second episode on the same wall depicts Vishnu, worshipping Siva with 1008 lotus flowers; finding one short he plucks his own eye and offers it as a flower; ^iva bestows grace on Vishnu. The panels closer to the entrance depict the marriage of ^iva with Uma. Uma, the daughter Himavan, desirous of marrying ^iva, undertakes austerities and worships ^iva; ^iva, after testing her steadfastness as a beautiful youth, marries her; the celestials witness the marriage; Brahma, the creator offers obla- tion to the sacrificial fire and Vishnu gives Uma in marriage to Siva. The east wall close to the entrance on the northern side depicts the Kiratarjuna scene; Arjuna the Pandava hero performs austerities to obtain a Pasupata weapon; Siva as a hunter accompanied by Uma as a huntress, tests Arjuna’s devotion; picks up a quarrel with Arjuna over a kill; Arjuna not knowing the personality behind the hunter, enters into a duel with him and is ultimately vanquished; ^iva manifesting himself bestows the weapon. At the extreme north of the same side are portrayed two episodes, one representing Siva quelling the pride of God of death, in order to protect his devotee and the other representing Saint Chandikeswara a great devotee of Siva, cutting off the leg of his father, who disturbed his faith and ^iva bestowing grace on both father and son. Though these group sculptures are carefully selected, they are imperfectly finished and lack the beauty and elegance of the sculptures of the main tower. The Mahamandapa Had the original mahamandapa been preserved, it would have retained the grandeur of its conception and beauty. But as it is, only the portion upto the main base is original. The side walls, the pillars and the ceilings hav e been reconstructed, probably in the 18th century A. D. Obviously the superstructure should have crumbled due 26 to neglect and vegetation. However a part of the original has survived upto the ceiling at the western end. From the surviving portion it may be seen, the roof {prastara) of the mahdmandapa was in level with the prastara of the ground floor (ddi bhUmi) of the main Vimdna. Like the walls of the main Vimdna, a horizontal cornice divides the outer walls of the mahdmandapa into two parts. They carry a series of niches both in the upper and lower courses. The sculptures of Vidyosvaras, Vasus, Adityas and other subsidiary deities were probably enshrined in them. As mentioned earlier, the ddibhumi of the main Vimdna has two floors inside the adndhdra passage, the intervening cornice forming the inter- mediate floor level. The mahdmandapa should have been a two storeyed pavilion, quite fitting with the mahdprdsdda of the temple. In view of the tall dvarapalas guarding the entrance to the mukhamandapa, the central passage should have had only the upper ceiling without the intermediate flooring. Thus the central passage was flanked by two storeyed structures, resembling the storeyed cloister of the enclosure. It is likely that the mahdma'^apa of Tanjavur was also originally a two storeyed structure. They would have presented a most spectacular sight when the deities were taken out in procession through the mahdmandapa. As it stands today the inner side of the mandapa has a central passage, leading from the front to the sanctum flanked by two raised platforms and a passage running around. Two massive dvarapalas are noticed at the western end guarding the entrance to the mukhamandapa. A room at the south western corner houses a beautiful Somaskanda image and a few other bronzes. A few sculptures and bronzes receiving regular worship are on the northern platform. The north eastern corner houses an interesting Solar altar, now worshipped as naoajraha (nine planets). The front entrance to the great mandapa, is again approached by steps from north and south. The entrance to the mandapa is guarded by massive dvarapalas. As the flooring of the mandapa is on a high elevation, the steps rise to a considerable height forming a high platform in the front. It is said that there is a sub-terranian passage with steps under this platform. Some claim that this passage leads to the royal palace, while others assert that it leads to the river KoUidam. Yet a third tradition says that it leads to an underground treasury wherein invaluable proper- ties belonging to the temple are preserved. Xone in the living memory has set foot on this passage for fear of darkness, poisonous gas and wasps. 28 It 18 not unlikely that the empty underground space below the great mandapa and the space between the steps, were utilised as store houses. The original steps leading to the front i'ut ranee of the great mandapa and the raised platform were probably disturbed and rebuilt as some of the stones built-in haphaz<ardly carry fragmentary inscriptions of the 13th Century A. D. (B) Sculpture The sculptures of Gangaikondacho leswaram are known for their boldness of conception and excellent execution. They present pleasing and charming faces full of life and rhythm. The images of Saraswathi, Chandesanugrahamurthi and Nataraja are undoubtedly from the dextrous hands of a master craftsman who has carved a permanent place for his creations in the art history of Tainilnad. The sculptures on the main Vimdna, the great mandapa, and the other small shrines represent the forms prevalent at that period and occupy fixed positions to suit the needs of worship, as enunciated in the Agamic texts. The images in the northern and southern Kailua shrines occupy identical positions. The main temple, being a mahdprdsdda, introduces additional images in its niches. An image of either Lingodhbhava or Vishnu is placed generally in the niche at the back of the Garbhagrka in ^iva temples. In the great Vimdna of Gangaikondaeholapuram both are found at the back. Vishnu with his consorts is seen in the lower niche while Lingodhbhava is shown in the upper niche. In some of the temples of the Cho la period, Subrahmanya is shown here at the back niche, especi- ally when the temple faces west. An image of Subrahmanya is also shown here at the back of the Garbhagrka. The image of Chandesanugrahamurti occupying the north eastern niche is also significant. In Pallava temples like Airavatesvara, Muktesvara and Matangesvara, all at Kanchi, Chandesanugrahamurti figures are noticed occupying an identical position. The upper row of niches in the main Vimdna carry sculptures of dikp^as and eleven Rudras, besides a few well-known forms of Biva. Of the eight dikpalas the one occupying the northern quarter is clearly Soma, identified by the halo behind his head. Soma facing north is found on the third floor of the monolith, Dharmaraja ratha at Mamallapuram. He is also found in the north on the enclosure wall of the Kail^anatha temple of Kanchi. Soma distinguished by a halo behind his head, is always shown as the guardian deity of the north in Tamilnad, unlike in the north where Kubhera is cepreseuted oa the. Vimdna, though both are hold identical in architectural treatises. It may be seen that besides the images identified, there are eleven images with four arms in a standing posture. The dikpalas are secondary deities called dvarana devalas, receiving daily worship. Besides the dikpalas the eleven Rudras (Ekadasa Rudras), the twelve Adityas, the eight Vasus, the eight Vidyesvaras, the eight miJrthis (ashtamurthis) and some other deities are also daily worshipped. According to Agamic te.xts the eleven Rudras should be shown standing with four arms, holding parasu and mrga in the upper arms, while the lower ones should be in the abhaya and varada poses. Evidently the eleven images on the Vimdna at Gangaikondacholapuram represent the eleven Rudras. The names of the eleven Rudras as given in texts are Sadyojata, Varaadeva, Aghora, Tatpurusha^ Isana, Mrtyunjaya, Vijaya, Kiranaksha, Aghorastra, Srikanta and Mahadeva. The great mandapaa at Tanjavur and Gangaikoridacholapuram carry a number of niches adorned with sculptures. In the Kailasanatha temple of Kanchi images of Lakshmi, Saraswathi, Durga and Jyeshta are found in the mandapa. According to Mayamatha, the well-known South - Indian text on architecture, these four forms of Goddesses are to be placed outside the Brahmaathdna, the place occupied by the main Vimdna. In Tanjavur and Gangaikondacho Ipuram Lakshmi, Saraswathi and Durga are found in identical niches on the walls of the great pavilion. Evidently they are enshrined in these niches to fulfil ritual needs. Some of the sculptures in standing posture found on the mahdmandapa have not so far been identified. It is likely they also represent the secondary deities. A series of sculptures at Tanjavur are shown with two arms, holding a sword and a shield. They are probably the eight Vasus, described in Agamic texts. Unfortunately the great mandapa at the Gangaikoridacholapuram has fallen down and undergone repairs. The majority of the niches are disturbod and are no more in existence. Some of the loose sculptures preserved in the enclosure may belong to this group. The representation of the guardian deities on the Vimdna, the sculpture placement in the niches of the Fi»iana and the presence of Saraswathi, Lakshmi and Durga in the niches of the mahdmandapa show that the builders had architectural treatises before them. 28 Tlie following is the sculpture placement in the lower niches of the main Vimdm. EAST-WALL (SOUTH SIDE) KANKALADHARA Six armed standing figure in tribhanga pose. The upper right arm holds a snake; the middle one feeds the mrga and the lower one playing on udukkai is broken. The upper left arm holds a trident across the back with a chowri hanging; the middle one is placed on the head of a dwarf standing by the side and the bottom holding the udukkai is broken. Pair of sandals adorn the feet. The plaster and paint- ing on the figure belong to a later period. On the wall to the right of ^iva are shown Surya on top; Bhutaga- nas in the middle and wives of sages at the bottom. The waU to the left of ^iva carries Chandra on top, ganas in the middle and wives of sages at the bottom. The makara torana above this niche carries a bas-relief of Uma- mahesvara in the middle. SOUTH -WALL GANESA :- Ganesa, dancing with four arms; upper right arm holds a parasu; the lower right holds the broken tusk; the upper left arm is lifted up; the lower left arm holds a fruit. The right leg is lifted up in rhythmic stance. Surya and Chandra, ganas and bhutas are shown on the sidewalls. Below the feet are shown three ganas, playing maddala, cymbals and conch. The Centre of the torana carries a faint carving. It represents a seated tiger, two fish and a bow which was the royal insignia of Rajendrachola. ARDHANARI :- A standing figure in Tribhanga pose with three arms; two to the right and one to the left; The upper right holds a parasu, while the lower right rests on the head of a bull standing besides it. The only left carries a full blown flower, probably nildtpala. A parrot seated on the arm is seen pecking the pollen. The right side of the head is adorned with a jaiamakutu and the left with a kesabandha. A lion pendant in the right ear and a roll pendant in the left are seen. A parasol above and one fly whisk on either sid\" are shown. The breast is shown pronouncedly on the left emphasizing the feminine aspect. The left leg wears a sari extending upto the knee. The right leg w’ears bringipdda. 29 No sculpture is represented on the side walls. The middle of the makara torana carries wavy lines. This figure of Ardhanari is particularly charming with a captivating smile on its face. The artist has been able to bring forth masculine firmness and feminine tenderness in the same face. DAKSHINAMURTI The original figure of Dakshinamurti that should have adorned this niche seems to have been lost. The present one is a late figure that could be assigned 13th Century A. D. It is disproportionate to the niche and is dwarfish. It is similiar to the sculptures of the period seated on a mountain with four arms. The upper right arm holds a rosary of beads. The lower right is in a teaching posture; the upper left holds fire and the lower, a book. The right leg is planted on the back of a lying dwarf; the left is bent and placed on the right knee. One of the image of sage, wearing kundala ear ornaments seems to be original. The side walls have four rows of miniature sculptures. East-wall two sages and two ganas; five women in second row; six ganas in third row and four sages in the fourth row. West wall first row, Agastya, two devas and Surya; second row, devas; third row devas and sages; and two devotees in the fourth row. HARAHARI Four armed figure standing erect in samihhanga pose. The right of the figure represents Kara and the left Hari. This figure is generally called Harihara, but the Saivite .Agamas designate this figure as Harahari. The upper right arm of the figure holds the axe and the lower right in boon bestowing (abhaya) pose; the upper left arm holds a conch and the lower arm is on the thigh. The dukula, the lower garment on the left is shown upto the knee while the one on the right represents the skin shown above the knee. No sculptures are shown on the side walls. A lotus is shown above the niche. ADAVALLAR (Nataraja) : A delightful figure of four armed dancing Siva, holding kettle drum in the upper right arm and boon bestowing palm on the lower right. The upper left carries fire and the lower left is thrown across the body in. gajcihi i! a. The matted locks are flying in rhythm on either side. On the right is shown Gahga. By the left side of the leg is shown an eight armed dancing Kali, carrying drum, sword, trident, abhaya, dandahasta etc. A three legged figure, probably representing Kuli is seen on the right. Below the feet is shown the woman- saint Karaikkal Ammai, who on account of her devotion, was endowed this privileged position of being seated below the seat of the Lord, singing 30 his Greatness. Three Ganas are also shown playing symbols and maddala. On the west side wall is shown Surya on top. Subrahmanya seated on peacock is shown flying towards the Lord while Ganapati moves equally briskly on his rat. Further down is four armed Nandikesvara playing maddala. Chandra is shown on the top on the side wall to the east. Two armed Goddess Parvati is leaning on a majestically look- ing bull; she holds a lotus in her right arm. WEST WALL GAlSGADHARA ; Four armed standing figure of ^iva, embracing Parvati standing by his side. The upper right arm of l^iva receives the falling Ganga in his matted lock; the lower right moves gently around Parvati. The upper left holds rarga; the left is placed on the thigh. The right arm of the Devi is placed on the thigh while the left is bent. Three rows of miniature sculptures are noticed on the side walls. Surya is shown on top of the wall right of l^iva; Devas are in the middle and two devotees at the bottom. The left wall carries Chandra at the top, devotees in the middle and Bhagiratha doing penance at the bottom. It is significant that the back wall (west wall) at the Kaila- sanatha temple of Kanchi carries a Gangadhara in a separate cell-shrine. LINGODHBHAVA Four armed standing figure of Lingodhbhava emanating from the shaft of fire. The right upper arm holds axe and the lower is in the abhaya pose; the left upper holds antelope and the lower is placed on the thigh. The leg below the ankle is hidden. A garland of flowers is shown around the Linga portion at the top. Vishnu as a boar is shown at the bottom in an outline. Brahma as swan is not represented. MAHA VISHNU : Four armed standing figure of Vishnu holding discus and the abhaya pose in the right arms and conch and hand-on-thigh pose with the left. On his right is shown two armed Srx wearing a breast-band and on the left is Bhudevi. The side walls show Surya and Chandra at the top, devas in the middle, and sages at the bottom. SUBRAHMANYA : A delightful figure of four armed standing Subrah- manya, carrying Sakti and Vajra in the upper arms while holding the lower right in abhaya, and the left on thigh. A prominent garland of flowers characteristic of Subrahmanya figures is shown at the root of the The Deva wears channavxra. crown. VISHNU ANUGRAHAMURTI : The God and Goddess seated on a pedestal, ^iva four armed, carrying Param and mrga in the upper arms; the lower left is placed on the thigh while the right is in the pose of hold- ing something, probably Chakra. The figure may be taken to represent Chakradanaraurti or Vishnu anugrhamurti. The Devi seated to the left of the Lord holds a lilly in her right arm. A parasol and a pair of chouries are shown above. Due to weathering, the stone has pealed off from the figure. The side wall to the left of the Lord carries an image of Chandra on top; two devotees in the middle and at the bottom is shown Vishnu worshipping Siva. The right wall carries Surya at the top and devotees in the middle. The bottom figures have weathered. NORTH -WALL KALANDHAKA Four armed ^iva, destroying Kala, right leg placed on Kala, and with the left pressing him. The upper right arm holding parasu (axe) is about to strike; the lower right holds the trident at ease; the upper left holds a mrga and the lower left points to Kala. Kala a fairly big figure, is shown struggling under the feet of the lord. Side walls carry Surya and Chandra at the top. On one side there are devotees and on another is shown Markandeya, the boy-saint worshipping Linga and the God of death dragging him forcibly with a rope. DURGA : Eight armed standing figure holding discus, arrow, sword and abhaya with the right arms and conch, bow, shield and hand-on- thigh pose with the left. Below her legs is shown a buffalo head, imperfectly carved. Behind her stands a lion. BRAHMA : Pour armed standing, three headed (the fourth head at the back not being visible) and bearded figure of Brahma in erect pose. Holds sruk and snva in the upper right arm and a rosary of beads in the lower right. Holds a bunch of dharbha grass in the upper left and a kundika in the lower left. He is flanked by two armed Devis. The Goddess to the right of Brahma, holds a bundle of palm leaves in her left arm. Evidently she is Sarasvati. The Goddess to the left is obviously Savitri, as Brahma is called Savitripati. The side walls carry Surya and Chandra and Devas and sages. BHAIRAVA : Eight armed standing nude figure, wearing a garland of skulls. A big snake coils around the thighs; round ball-like eyes, protrud- 32 ing teeth, flame like hairs; holding a trident, parasu, sword and noose in the right arm; and with left, fire, kapdla, khatvdnga and bell. Behind the figure is shown an imperfectly carved hound. KAMANTAKA Four armed seated figure; right upper arm holding a rosary of beads and the lower arm pointing down. The left upper arm holds a chowri and the lower is placed on thigh. The head dress is delightfully treateil and has a distinctiveness of its own. The side wall to the right carries a figure doing penance on top; below are two devotees. On the left side at the top is shown Manmatha aiming an arrow at Siva. Two devotees are shown in the middle and at the bottom are shown Manmatha and Bathi. EAST-WALL (NORTH SIDE) CHANDESANUGRAHAMURTI : Siva seated on a throne with four arms carries axe and antelope in his upper arms; with the lower the Lord is seen crowning Chandesa with a garland of flowers, a symbol of affection and stewardship. Chandesa is seen seated in front and with folded arms receiving the pride of place bestowed on him by his Lord. Chandesa is the embodiment of devotion and piety and the place he attained is consi- dered the highest, a devotee of Siv-a is privileged with. It is called the C'handlsa padam, the abode of deliverance. According to ^aiva Siddhanta Siva bestows this grace, in the company of Sakti, His consort. In the scii! )ture under reference, Parvati or Uma Parameswari as she is often desc ibed, is seated by the side of Her Lord. The treatment of orna- ments, the portrayal of limbs and affection with which Siva is seen tak- ing the garland around the head of Chandesa are suggestivm and truely convey the supreme message of Saiva Siddhanta, the image seeks to depict. In the figure of Chandesa, Rajendra Chola has carved his own image. Sri C. Sivaramamurti in his work ‘the Chola temples’ states that “The most remarkable carving here, the Chandesanugrahamurti panel, is almost a suggestion of the laurels won by Rajendra through the grace of ^iva and he humbly presents himself as a devotee of Lord, who blessed Chandesa”. On the side walls is shown the story of Chandesa; Chan4esa worshipping Siva as a Lihga; the cows standing by the side; his father watching the happenings hiding himself behind the branches of a tree; disturbing Chandesa’s worship; purturbed Chandesa throwing his axe at his father and Siva bestowing grace on both. 33 SARASWATI : Facing the image of Chandeswugrahamurti, on the west wall of the Mahamandapa is another delightful figure of Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge. The Devi is seen seated on a lotus throne with four arms; holds a rosary of beads and an amrta kalasa with the upper arms and palm leaves and teaching pose with the lower ones; behind her is shown a prabha, aureole. LAKSHMI : Correspondingly on the South side of the mahamandapa, in the west wall is an image of Goddess Lakshmi, seated on a lotus throne with two arms. The Devi holds lotus flowers in her arms; unlike Saras- vati, she is seen wearing a breast-band. Above her are shown two ele- phants pouring water from golden pots held in their trunks.

Chandra DVARAPALAS (GATE KEEPERS) There are altogether six pairs of massive, monolithic dvarapalas guarding the various entrances to the main temple, of which four pairs are found in the east. The first pair guard the entrance tower at the east. They are now fallen down and lie upside down. The second pair is to be seen at the eastern entrance to the mahdmandapa. The entrance from the mahdmandapa to the mukhamandapa is guarded by a third pair while the fourth guard the entrance to the sanctum. The side entrances to the mukhamandapa from the south and the north are also guarded by dvara- palas of exquisite workmanship. These dvarapalas are a class by them- selves. The Agamic texts mention four pairs of dvarapalas, each to guard a cardinal direction. Their names are given as under. East Kandi and Mahak^a; South :- Herambha and Bhringi; West :- Durmukha and Pandura and North Sita and Asita. The Vimdna of the Tanjavur temple has four pairs of dvarapalas each guarding a direction. Evidently they represent the images named above. In the temple of Gangaikondacho la- puram the Vimdna does not carry dvarapalas except in the east. The dvarapalas guarding the entrances to the garbhagrha are certainly Nandi and Mahakala; In all likelihood the dvarap^as guarding the south and north entrances to the Mukhaman^pa are Herambha and Bhringi, Durmukha and Pandura respectively. THE SOLAR ALTAR The solar altar called Saura pitha in Agamic texts is in the form of a full blown lotus on a square pedestal in two tiers. The upper tier carries eight deities portrayed at eight directions. They are considered the eight planets, which, including the central lotus representing Surya (sun) constitute the navagrahas, (nine planets) worshipped by the Hindus for the bestowal of good fortune and the removal of obstacles. The lower tier is modelled as a charriot with wheels on either side, drawn by seven horses. Aruna the Charioteer of Surya is shown driving the horses. The seven horses are said to represent the seven days of the week. The wheels are orna- mented with twelve petals, representing the twelve months of a year. At the corners are seen flying celestials, gandharvaa carrying flower garlands. The Agamic texts specify the worship of Surya in the form of a lotus altar. Evidently this is a representation of Saura pitha, solar altar, intended for daily worship. This elegant piece is also decidedly a Chalukyan sculpture, probably brought here as a war trophy. In recent years, it has assumed great significance as a large number of devotees worship it as Navagraha for the fulfilment of their vows. When the planet Saturn changes its position once in 27 months, nearly a million people offer worship to this altar. OTHER SCULPTURES : Besides the sculptures found on the walls of the shrines, a few loose sculptures are also found in the temple. A few of them have been collected and embedded on a platform by the side of the northern entrance. The following sculptures are found embedded Bhikshatna, Lingodbhava, Ganesa, Subrahmanya, Devi, Yirabhadra, Brahma, Durga, Chandrasekhara, Vrshabhantika, Vm^hara, Surya, Sage, Dvarapala, three figures of Nagaraja, two images of Vinadhara and four figures probably representing secondary deities. On the south enclo- sure wall, near the southern Kailasa, are found embedded a four armed standing Ardhanari, a Gajalakshmi and two images of Surya. By the side of the Lion-well, is found an im.age of Vishnu with Sridevi standing. By the side of the Solar pitha, in the mahdmandapa there are, an image of eight armed Durga and a Surya. These two images are in Chalukyan style and probably were brought as trophies. Sri C. Sivaramamurti in ‘ the Cho la temple ’ states that the Nandi in the temple of Goddess is Chalukyan in style. 36 (C) Bronzes There are a few bronzes of remarisable beauty preserved in the temple. They were probably gifted for worship when the temple was erected. Of the classical bronzes in the collection, Somaskanda, Subrah- manya, Durga, Bhogasakti, Adhikaranandi and probably Vrshabhantika are to be assigned to the period of Rajendra I. BHOGASAKTI : A two armed standing image of Parvati of arresting beauty is now placed near the sanctum. DURGA : Four armed standing figure in erect (samabhanga) pose; holds discus and conch in the upper arms and boon-bestowing and hand- on-thigh poses in the lower arms. The Goddess is shown wearing a breast-band; buffalo head is not represented below the feet. Appro- priate with its role the figure displays firmness with which the Goddess struck the demon. The conch and discus are supported by metal pieces issuing from the back. ADHIKARANANDI : Four armed figure in abhaya pose, standing on a lotus pedestal. The upper pair of arms hold axe and antelope; the lower arms in anjali pose hold a garland of flower in between. This image is particularly a good specimen representing the theme. SO.UASKANDA : Quite fitting with the great Linga in the sanctum and the mahapr^ada of the temple, the group of Somaskanda in the temple is fairly big in size and exhibits all the classical qualities of the Chola age. The group consists of Siva seated majestically on a pedestal with four arms. A two armed Devi is shown by the side. The original Skanda image is missing. The figures of Siva and Devi closely resemble the sculptures on the lower niches of the main vimana. The group could be assigned to the period of Rajendra I and was probably the principal Somaskanda image of the temple. It may be mentioned that the bronze image of Somaskanda is the main processional deity, representing the Linga in the sanctum. The Somaskanda image of Thiruvarur is called Vidi Vitankar and the one at Tanjavur was called Dakshinameru Vitankar. The Vimana of Tanjavur temple was called Dakshinameru by its builder Rajaraja I. The group of Som^kanda in the Gangaikonda- eholapuram temple should have been the main processional deity of the temple. This is the biggest group of Somaskanda image of the imperial Chola period now known to exist. 37 SUBRAHMANYA : By far the best bronze in the collection of the temple is the Subrahmanya image variously called Karthikeya, Devasenapathi and Muruga. The image about 3^' in height is shown with four arms standing on a lotus seat. Unlike the conventional lotus pedestals seen in most of the bronze images, the present one is realistically treated. The protrution at the bottom was probably to slide the image into a bigger pedestal which is now missing. The right upper arm holds sakti, the top of which is broken; the lower right holds a sword of which only the handle now remains, the blade is lost; the left upper arm holds a cock and the lower left holds a shield. The figure is elegantly proportioned and delightfully adorned with ornaments. The vigourous poise and the charming smilimg face are suggestive of youth and beauty. Subrahmanya as Muruga is adored as the embodiment of youth, beauty and knowledge. Muruga is the darling of the Tamil coimtry. His exploits are celebrated in Tamil litera* ture; Subrahmanya is a War God, Devasenapathi the greatest commander- in-chief of the celestials. Rajendra I was the greatest commander, the Tamil country ever saw. It is of interest to note that this great hero has chosen Subrahmanya as his favourite deity. The sword, sakti, and the shield in the hands of the image symbolise Subrahmapya’s martial quality while the cock stands for the final victory. VBSHAVAHANA : Four armed image of ^iva standing cross legged. The lower right arm is bent and placed on the head of a bull which is missing. The tall head dress, a Jaldmakuta is somewhat disproportionate. VI Minor Shrines DURGA SHRINES : Images of Durga are enshrined in four cardinal directions of the palace. Tradition says that these images guarded the four gates of the fortified city. These are now at PalliMai in the north, at Meykavalputhur in the east, and on Virareddi street in the south. The fourth in the west was originally near the bund of the great lake but has recently been brought nearer to the palace and enshrined. DURGA ON VIRAREDDI STREET : The Durga on Virareddi street is a remarkable piece. Durga is shown with eight arms, standing; right arms hold arrow from the quiver, chakra and a sword; the lower right is with a trident piercing the demon shown at her feet. The left arms hold aankha, bow, shield and the dying demon, Mahisha. Durga’s left leg is planted on the chest of the demon while her right leg steadies her on the ground. Her mount is shown to the right at the bottom. The demon holding a shield and a sword is on his knees slowly sinking. A halo is shown behind the deity. A careful study of the sculpture, the arms, the weapons, the dying demon and the style and the treat- ment of the figure suggest that this sculpture is Chalukyan in origin and was brought as war trophy. KANAKKUPILLAIYAR : A few furlongs to the south west of the big temple is a small shrine, enshrining a seated Ganesa of considerable beauty. It is four armed, holding the little axe, rosary of beads, a broken tusk, and a mdtulinga fruit. Around the waist is seen a serpent belt. This image also seems to be Chalukyan in origin. KURUVALAPPAR TEMPLE : The Vishnu temple about a mile to the west of the great temple is now called Kuruvalappar temple, believed to be a contraction of the term Kurugai Kavalappar. The temple is intimately associated with the lives of two Vaishnavite saints, Nathamuni and his grand-son Alavandar. Nathamuni spent his last days here. Alavandar on hearing that Nathamuni was on his death bed, hurried to this place ; but before he could reach, the great Acharya passed away. Sri Alavandar erected a temple in the place where the Acharya attained sidvation. 39 According to tradition the present temple was the one built by Alavandar. The main deity called Viranarayapap Perum^ is in standing pose. The temple is preceded by a small entrance tower. AIYANAR TEMPLE : To the south east of the palace remains, is a small shrine of Aiyanar. The temple faces south and houses a beautiful image of Aiyanar and his consorts Purna and Pusbkala. The sculpture of Aiyan^ is an elegant image and closely resembles the sculptures on the main temple and decidedly a sculpture of Rajendra’s period. VII Epigraphs Twelve inscriptions and a few fragments have been noticed so far on the temple. An inscription of Virarajendra Chola, the third son of Rajendra-I is the earliest and lengthiest running to about 216 lines. It relates to gifts of lands in a number of villages in the Chola empire, the proceeds from which were to be utilised for worship and maintenance of the temple. The accuracy with which the boundaries and measurements of the lands are recorded, the taxes from which the lands were exempted, the crops that were raised in the lands, the total quantity of grains to be measured out to the temple by each village, the names of the officers who drafted the endowment, the names of those who compared the drafting, the names of those who entered them in registers etc., recorded in detail in this epigraph, show the efficiency and thoroughness of ChSla adminis- tration. These gifts were ordered by Virarajendra while he was in the royal palace at Kanchipuram in his fifth regnal year. Though this is a single record, it relates to more than six orders of the king. The epigraph records that the order would take effect from the regnal years of Rajendra-I and Rajadhiraja-I. The earliest regnal year of Rajendra from which an order was to take effect, is mentioned as the 23rd. Evidently the temple was completed and consecrated before that ( 1035 A. D. ), It is likely that Rajendra, the builder of the temple, himself made these gifts. Probably they had not been recorded and Virarajendra ordered them to be entered in the proper registers. There are two orders, that took effect from the 26th and 30th years respectively of Rajadhiraja I, the son and successor of Rajendra. Evidently, some gifts were made in the reign of Rajadhiraja as well. From the records it is seen that more than one hundred and ten thousand bags of paddy were to be measured out to the temple every year by the villages mentioned in epigraphs. A careful study of the inscription reveals that most of the lands and proceeds recorded in this inscriptions are also recorded in the Tanja- vur inscriptions of Rajaraja as gifts to the great temple of Tanjavur. 41 It is strange that most of the lands gifted to Tahjiivur temple by Raja- raja should have been transferred to the temple of Gangaikondachola- puram by his son within twenty five years of the original gift. The inscription is of great value. It mentions the names of the various divisions and sub-divisions of the Cho la empire. It also gives a long list of officers who were in charge of the administration in the reign of Virarajendra. A certain Pallavaraiyan is mentioned as the Thiru- mandira Olai (royal secretary) of Virarajendra. He received orders verbally from the king and drafted them. The orders were scrutinised and approved by three senior secretaries (Thirumandira Olaindyakam) whose names are recorded as Vanadhirajan, Madhurantaka Brahmadhi- rajan and PaUavarayan. Sixty four other officers are also named; their names are given at the end of this chapter. The inscription is of interest from another angle. In listing the villages gifted it gives the names of various temples, tanks, colonies, irrigation channels; cremation grounds etc., in each village, thus furnish- ing details for a study of the contemporary history of these villages. These details are published at the end of this chapter. The name of the temple according to this inscription is Gangai- kopda Cho lisvaram. Rajendra is referred to as the father, the victor of Purvadesa, Gangai and Kadaram [Purvadesamum Gangaiyum, Kadd- ramutn Kondarulina Ayyar). Rajadhiraja is referred to as the elder brother, the victor of Kalyanapura and Kollapura who laid down his life while seated on an elephant (mxiurremuij ipih Q*rrsowmgy(y^ih ). The inscription also details the victories gained by Virarajendra. Another inscription of interest is a fragment found on the front steps of the great mandapa. It mentions Vanavanmahadevi and Aminan- gadevi. Vanavanmahadevi was the name of Rajt'ndra’s mother (Raja raja’s wife). One of Rajendra’s queens was also named Vanavanmaha- devi. It is not known who is referred to in this inscription; but in all likely- hood it refers to Rajendra’s queen. Ammangadevi. the other, was one of the daughters of Rajendra- 1. She was given in marriage to the Eastern Chalukya ruler Rajaraja Narendra. Their son was the celebrated Kulot- tunga-I. The next king represented in the inscription is Kulottunga I (1070- 1120). A record of his dated in 49th regnal year does not pertain to this 42 temple but relates to the gift of a village Sungam thavirtha Cho lanallur, as a devatana gift, for provisions etc., to the temple of Rajendra ChoUsvara in Pottalimada. Probably this temple was built in the reign of Rajendra I and was named after him. The inscription states that worship in the temple was stopped as sufficient provisions were not available. Kulottn- nga made the gift tax free and arranged for regular worship. A certain ascetic Aryadevan is mentioned in this inscription. The epigraph also records that the order of the king was issued when he was seated on a throne, at the eastern porch in the ground floor of Gangaikondacho la maligai in Gangaikonda cho lapuram. The last Cho la king represented in inscriptions is Kulottunga III. His inscriptions are in fragments and found by the side of the steps to the eastern entrance to the great mandapa. They record the victories gained by Kulottunga and the erection of a victory pillar. From the fragmentary nature of these inscriptions it may be surmised that a number of other Cho la inscriptions of the temple have been lost. Refe- rence has been made to the presence of an incomplete inscription of a Gahadawala king, probably of Madanapala. The earliest Papdya king to be represented here is Jatavarman Sundara Pandya, identical with the ruler who uprooted the Ch5 la empire. He ascended the throne in 1251. The sole inscription of his found in this temple is dated in his second regnal year. Evidently the gift was made when the Pandya emperor captured Gangaikondacho lapuram and paid a visit to the temple. He established a special worship called Sundara Pandyan sandhi, after his name to be performed daily. For this purpose Sundara gifted lands etc, in Gangaikondacho Upuram. The inscription mentions a number of places, in Gangaikondacho lapuram like the gateway lane, Suddharaali lane, Rajendra Cho la fort wall and Vemhugudi gate. Gangaikondacholapuram is said to lie in Ponparappiparru of Mannaikonda Cho la valanadu, a subdivision in Vadakarai Vikrama Chola valan^u. The next Paridya to be rspresented is Vikrama who ably assisted his brother Sundara. His record is dated in his sixth year (1157). Vikrama like his brother established a special worship in the temple after his own name as Rajakkalnayakan sandhi for which he gifted twenty »eZi«ofland. The epigraph names two villages Kulottungacholanallur, and Rajendrahcolanallur. It also mentions the boundaries of lands 43 gifted. The river Madhurantaka Vadavaru and irrigation channels called Anaivettuvan kal and Adigai Nayakan vaykal. A highway called the Rajendra Cholan highway is also referred to in this inscription. Two inscriptions of Pandya Maravarman Kulasekhara who ascended the throne in 1268 A. D. are found engraved on the temple. The first one dated in his fourth year, records the purchase of lands in Devaniputtur belonging to a certain Kumarmangalam Udayan, Sivatandan. The other inscription which is incomplete, is dated in Kulasekhara’a fifth regnal year. It records the sale of lands belonging to a number of individuals to the temples of Gangaikondacholisvarm. The epigraph mentions highways named the Kulottunga Cholan fort wall highway; the Vilangu- daiyan highway and a highway through which a short elephant passed. Two inscriptions of a chieftain, Thiruvengadamudaiyan Ekamra- natha Gangeyan of Vaippur, who was in control of this area are recorded in this temple. One of the inscriptions gives the Saka date 1385 (1463 A.D.). From the inscription it may be seen that this chieftain probably erected a mandapa named after himself, Ekamranathan Mandapa. While the chieftain was seated in a matha of Ekamranatha Mandapa the Mudalis, the temple priests, the tdnattdrs (those who looked after the pro- perties of the temple), the Parikarathar (temple attendants) and a certain Kasrairaraya (probably a person from Kashmir) assembled before him. The chieftain bestowed the right (probably on Kasmiraraja) of duties-over Thirumdligaikuru (maintenance of the enclosure and the right to enjoy proceeds apportioned for the purpose) for fifteen days in a month and lordship over the matha for the other fifteen days of the month. For this purpose he gifted two house sites in the northern row and two in the southern row of Rajendra Chola street. A certain Kuhurudaiyan is mentioned as the temple accountant. The other inscription of the chief- tain relates to a similar gift. Mention has been made of the inscriptions of Vijayanagara rulers in the temple. Note A The quantity of paddy measured or gold paid per annum as due to the temple by various villages mentioned in Virarajendra’s inscription are given below. As the inscription is damaged at some places, either the name of the village or the quantity measured is lost in certain cases. The total quantity of paddy measured amounted to 1,03,893 kalams (bags) per annum. As there are many gaps in the inscriptions, the total measurement should have been many thousand kalams more of paddy. The maximum measure received from a single village is 20,585 kalams. Unfortunately the name of the village is lost. Vayalur is the next village to measure 16,900 kalams. Evidently these villages should have been the most fertile villages during the Chola period.
