        "text": "Like many towns in Bulacan, Plaridel have its niche in Philippine History being the site of the Battle of Quingua – Battle of Quingua during the Philippine-American War in part of the defense of First Philippine Republic against the Northern Campaign of American Army. The battle was manned by Pablo Tecson – Lt. Colonel Pablo Ocampo Tecson of San Miguel, Bulacan under Gregorio del Pilar and during which Col. John Stotsenberg was killed on April 23, 1899. A marker now stands at the site of the battle in Barangay Agnaya.\n\nThe battle began when US Major Bell with the 4th Cavalry, while on a reconnaissance mission, came upon a strong Fillipino position led by Colonel Pablo Tecson, a Revolutionary officer from San Miguel, Bulacan who was under command of General Gregorio del Pilar. The Filipinos laid down heavy fire which halted Bell’s cavalry advance. After a short firefight, Bell recognized his position was badly exposed to the opposition, and as a result his force risked defeat. Bell sent for reinforcements, and the 1st Nebraskans came to his aid under Colonel John M. Stotsenburg, while Irving Hale sent companies from the 51st Iowa as well as artillery from the Utah Battery."
