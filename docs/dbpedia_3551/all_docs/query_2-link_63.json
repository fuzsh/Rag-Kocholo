Bagbag Bridge is located in Calumpit, Bulacan and was the site of the first battle between Filipino and American soldiers during the Philippine-American War in April 1899. It saw General Gregorio del Pilar lead Filipino forces in the longest battle of the war against advancing U.S. troops led by General Arthur MacArthur Jr. The bridge commemorates the bravery of Filipino soldiers who were victorious against the Americans in this battle. The Battle of Calumpit lasted from April 25-27, 1899 and was a continuation of fighting after the Battle of Quingua, with General Antonio Luna again facing off against MacArthur's forces.",
