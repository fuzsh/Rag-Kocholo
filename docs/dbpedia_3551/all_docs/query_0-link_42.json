        "text": "June 1, 1823, it was a very dark, gloomy night in Manila[1], the center of Spanish power and prestige in one of its remaining colonial possessions, the Philippine islands. Being detached from the rebellious New Spain in which declared itself an empire two years later, it became a royalist bastion of the former viceroyalty of the felon king Ferdinand VII, which recently cracked down on liberalism and ideas of the Enlightenment once the war in Europe had finally ended. All those who were inside the city, including the predecessor and now liutenenant-general Mariano Fernandez de Folgueras, were asleep with comfort and ready for the next day. The current captain-general, Jose Antonio Martinez, was outside the capital for relative reasons.\n\nManila, capital of the Spanish East Indies\n\n​\n\nOn the very same night, at around 10:00pm, a certain captain aged approximately 27 by the name of Andres Novales, along with his camp-de-aide Ruiz Calba[2] and various disgruntled, mostly criollo officers revolted in the capital, gradually took over the entirety of the capital, including important government buildings such as the cabildo, the Manila Cathedral, military facilities, etc.\n\nRebels confronting loyalists to join the mutiny, 1823​\n\nDuring the chaos, the mutineers turned their attention to find Martinez, which was outside of the capital at the time. Failing to find the peninsular, they instead turned towards Folgueras, where he was stabbed by Calba in the name of his superior, who otherwise declared himself Emperor of the Philippines. Other authorities who opposed were subsequently arrested. Novales, on the other side of the mutiny detained several European officers, including some fellow criollos, which he treated as brothers-in-arms with great courtesy although their arrest was deemed necessary to prevent them from escaping. The only obstacle left to secure absolute freedom for them was Fort Santiago, guarded by the emperor's own brother Mariano.\n\nAround this time, Andres arrived near at the fort, in which he persuaded his brother on joining the revolt. Mariano at first refused, until the younger brother promised to grant him the title of commander-in-chief of an army soon to be established in the future. This finally persuaded his brother to join the movement, and by the next day, the entirety of the capital was in rebel hands. With all of this happening, the soldiers shouted and cheered for their emperor, while the townsfolk, to the surprise of the rebels, joined their cause.\n\nMartinez, learning through two Indios who escaped the city in order to alert him about the incident, immediately gathered soldiers, and from there galloped and presented themselves outside the Manila walls to an engagement with the rebels. As this was happening, Novales prepared to defend the town; and at the first gun that was fired, the valorous governor fled, leaving his division without a Commandant. Lieutenant- colonel Santa-Romana, who was senior officer, seeing this specimen of his General's bravery, took the command, and commenced a vigorous attack.\n\nHowever, after a brief success, artillery and ammunition were carried by the orders of Mariano were brought to the frontlines, initiating a brutal attack where cannons tore down enemy lines, and in a mode of panic, the Spanish soldiers ran for their lives, having taken refuge in the surrounding towns.\n\nManila townsfolk celebrating the rebel victory in a game\n\n​\n\nHaving achieved victory against the Spanish, the emperor triumphantly marched towards the Plaza, and in front of an enthusiastic crowd, remarked his short speech before them:\n\nOn this very day of June 2, the one thousand-eight hundred-twenty-third year of our Lord, I stand beside the townsfolk of the former Spanish capital that, from now on, the battle for the independence of our beloved country has now began against the tyrannical forces of the felon king in Madrid. For over 2 centuries and a half, we, the Indios, mestizos, sangleyes and criollos served faithfully to the cause of Mother Spain in quelling various revolts and uprisings, and even foreign invasions that would otherwise cause the destruction of our beloved home, here in the Far East.\n\nBut now, Mother Spain has fallen into a deep state of decline steered even more by the oppressive and corrupt friars and peninsulars who otherwise claimed that God had chosen them to ran this empire. This, my fellows was the cause for our brethren on the other side to revolt and fight to the last man for their independence as well.\n\nI, now therefore, declare that this archipelago of the Far East, shall now be an independent nation just like the former British colonies of the New World that inspired our Hispanic brothers from the other side to revolt for theirs. Not even a single inch of Philippine soil shall remain in Spanish hands and the Almighty shall guide us into this road of independence. Long live the Empire! Long live the Philippines and its people! Long live this freedom!\n\nDown to the oppressive friars and of the Peninsulars!\n\nAndres I, Emperor of the Philippines at the Palacio del Gobernador, June 2, 1823​\n\nThe crowd and the soldiers once again cheered the emperor with enthusiasm, and the military officers celebrated all night in the Palacio del Gobernador.\n\n[1] - Only consisted of Intramuros before 1901\n\n[2] - Known only by the name of Ruiz in OTL\n\nNote: The Province of Manila, until 1859 known as Tondo named after the former municipality was a province in the Philippines that consists of Metro Manila minus Valenzuela (used to be a town of Bulacan until 1975) and the municipalities of Montalban (except its mountainous part) and San Mateo in modern-day Rizal, and before 1853 also consists 3 more Rizal municipalities: Antipolo, Cainta and Taytay as well as the defunct Bosoboso, annexed to Antipolo on 1903. In 1901, most of the province was merged with Morong to form Rizal, while the city itself was treated as a separate entity after its expansion.\n\nMartinez, who was humiliated at the battle, was determined to quell the rebellion once and for all. He subsequently escaped and took refuge in Pampanga through Bulacan in a 2-day journey. He then declared Bacolor as the temporary capital after 61 years since 1762. Afterwards, he sent his representatives to other parts of Spanish Luzon to warn of the rebels movement. He wasn't willing to lose to a bunch of people who armed themselves and just took over the entire capital.\n\nFollowing the battle of Manila, between June 3 and 5, Novales, or Andres I recruited about 3,000 men, composed of the King's Regiment (renamed the Emperor's Regiment), the urban militia, the Luzon Dragoons stationed in the city, Spanish defectors and irregulars who joined. The force was divided each to 1,000, each for the emperor, Mariano, and Calba. On June 6, the force departed from Manila, with about 500 of the urban militia stationed to defend the city from Spanish attacks. Their first objective was to capture Tondo south of the Pasig, which would be led by the Novales brothers, while Calba shall led the campaign north of it.\n\nBecause most of the soldiers, either recruited or volunteered the army were mostly irregulars, they overwhelmingly wore the dress of the common men, which is a baro. This picture shows a man wearing a baro and a salaual in the early-mid 19th century.\n\n​\n\nAfter the capture of smaller municipalities beyond Manila, Andres and Mariano themselves decided that they should part own ways, to make the campaign ran smoothly in a piecemeal. Mariano parted for Pineda[1], Andres parted for San Pedro Macati[2].\n\nFrom Pineda, Mariano quickly occupied the adjacent municipality of Malibay[3], recruiting about 200, and from there he headed his way towards Parañaque, where he met some mild resistance from some Spanish soldiers who fled Manila 4 days earlier, but for the most part he gradually succeeded in his objective in pacifying the town. As punishment to the friars and some principalia who supported the enemy, Mariano seized kept their lands and assets, which became one of the first state-owned lands in the Philippines. Las Piñas, a municipality south of Parañaque defected to the rebels.\n\nAs for Andres's case, entire municipalities such as San Pedro Macati, Pasig and Pateros[4] surrendered and defected to the rebels in a matter of hours. However, one municipality, Taguig[5] refused to comply the emperor's demands and gradually prepared for battle. In response, Andres ordered his troops to storm the town, but prohibit from looting and raping in order to present themselves as their liberators. Despite this however, some nevertheless did those, in which they were punished from walking the gauntlet, to hanging. Like Mariano he also seized friar and principalia lands on the municipalities they took. This caused Muntinlupa[6] to unconditionally surrender fearing that the events in Taguig might happen to them as well.\n\nSpanish soldiers in their defense on Tondo\n\n​\n\nIn the north, Calba first took San Nicolas, then advanced towards Tondo, the largest town second only to Manila by population, which was defended by survivors at Manila and some Kapampangans stationed in the area. The Spanish and their Indio allies fiercely defended the heavily important and populated town, for 4 days. As he began to receive about 150 casualties per day, Calba decided to capture Binondo, a municipality which has a long history of defying and rebelling against Spanish authority since the rebellion by sangleys in 1603. Along with Dilao[7] recruits and some from Caloocan[8], Calba surrounded the municipality by land on all sides, and initiated a blockade. Tondo surrendered to the rebels on June 10, in which those who surrendered were treated fairly and accordingly.\n\nThe fall of Tondo allowed Calba's forces to swiftly take Tambobong[9] and Caloocan without a fight, along with a few skirmishes. Mariquina[10] followed on June 11, and by June 12 all of Tondo province, as well as some parts of Cavite and Bulacan were now held by the rebels.\n\n[1] - Now Pasay (as of 1901)\n\n[2] - Now Makati (as of 1914), without the disputed Embo barangays\n\n[3] - Annexed to Pasay in 1903\n\n[4] - Included the Embo barangays and Fort Bonifacio area until the 1970s\n\n[5] - Without Fort Bonifacio\n\n[6] - Without the barangay of Tunasan, then known as Tunasancillo which was annexed from San Pedro, Laguna in 1905\n\n[7] - Now Paco (as of the late 19th century), Manila\n\n[8] - Without the salient of the southern part and the north, and included southern Q.C minus the San Juan, Marikina and Pasig territorial cessions until 1903\n\n[9] - Now Malabon (as of 1901), included Navotas until 1859, reannexed in 1903 and reseparated in 1906\n\n[10] - Included some portions of eastern Q.C until 1939, small portion reannexed back in 1941\n\nCapture of Cavite\n\nAs soon as news reached the southern provinces of Batangas, Cavite, Laguna[1] and Tayabas[2] of the capture of Manila to the army of a criollo captain, immediately various groups of people, especially those turned, often forced to banditry or those who defy friar ownership of their lands took the time to do their bidding. So much so that 3 days after the fall of Tondo, only major towns, often in the coast, or those heavily populated in the interior were left out of bandit-controlled territory. In Tayabas's case however, the residents formed a free government, since most land in Tayabas was natively owned, and only few belonged to the friars. Seizures of friar and allied principalia lands became common. Those who refused to cede were often lynched or murdered by peasants. Some parts of Bulacan[3] were also affected by bandits.\n\nThis was the case in the province of Cavite, where it was considered a center of banditry ever since the Spanish first set foot on Luzon. Since the 1770s onward banditry in the province had achieved a rate that was never seen before in other bandit-infested provinces such as Bulacan and Tayabas. The most prominent of these bandit groups was the one led by Luis de los Santos, well known by his nickname, Luis Parang or El Tulisan, which instilled terror on the Spanish due to his timely attack while waiting for the enemy to arrive, hence the nickname Parang, which came from para, meaning to park.\n\nParang was leading a peasant rebellion against the Spanish back in 1822 when he took word that Novales, a captain of the Spanish army in Manila, rebelled and took over the capital. He ignored this news, although it captured his interest as nobody except the Brits had even captured Manila. Later, he now expressed a desire to form an alliance with Novales after the entire province of Tondo fell to the rebels in a matter of days.\n\nSince the only parts of Cavite remaining under Spanish control are the municipalities of the Cavite peninsula[4] and Cavite Viejo[5], northern Bacoor as well as small pockets of villages loyal to the Spanish, Parang sent one of his accomplices, Juan Upay to Manila for the purpose of forging an alliance between the two sides, arriving at June 14. This reception generated mixed reactions, who distrusted bandits due to the destruction they caused. However, upon the arrival of the Novales brothers (Calba was stationed in Tambobong on Mariano's orders to defend northern Tondo from Spanish attacks) on June 15, they let them in, due to them knowing that most bandits were forced to their current status due to oppression. Andres had no time to met the Caviteño as he traveled around Tondo to recruit troops for the cause.\n\nUpay, Mariano and some of the principalia playing panguingue while discussing an alliance at the Palacio del Gobernador\n\n​\n\nInitially, Upay only considered forging an alliance at the behest of Parang, but instead Mariano gave him another offer: he, Parang and other major bandit leaders shall be inducted into the soon to be established Imperial Army to trained as regular officers, while their followers would be irregulars. However, Mariano warned them of the consequences if they attempted to loot, kill and persecute, even friars. This was something that Upay disagreed, but he had no other choice but to comply. He doesn't want the rebel government to been seen as brutes.\n\nAlong with over 500 troops, and equipment given to Upay by Mariano, he departed Manila by June 18, and reached Parang's camp two days later. Upay explained to Parang what Mariano told him, as well as a plan for a joint attack against the Spanish holding in the northern regions. He also told the bandit leader that they shall be inducted into the army, in which most of them agreed. Parang however chose to be the alcalde mayor (governor) of Cavite instead.\n\nWith all things set aside, they marched from their camp at Imus[6], to the outskirts of Cavite Viejo and Bacoor on June 19, still dawn, arriving by 9am in the morning. A contingent of troops sent by Mariano, numbered 200 marched from Las Piñas to join Parang's forces. While marching towards the capital, the townsfolk had mixed reactions: some welcomed them as liberators, while others closed their doors. Nevertheless, they took over friar and principalia estates, becoming state property, with some being distributed to the peasants.\n\nOnce they reached the outskirts of Dalahican[7], the Spanish tried to fend them off with cannonfire, in the hopes that their positions shall be liquidated. However, due to most of the soldiers defending the peninsula were mostly Indios, they often defy, or simply ignore any orders of their superiors. Even worse was some defected to the rebels, giving vital information about the area.\n\nA Spanish captain overseeing the defense fortifications at southern Dalahican\n\n​\n\nThe rebels decided to just encamp around the area while they themselves do marching and combat drills, at the same time sending some troops to retaliate for their previous bombings. This lasted for 3 days, and Parang decided to lure the Spanish by making a false retreat back to Cavite Viejo. Carrying all of their equipment and supply trains, they made such a move on June 23. The Spanish fell for the ruse, and the captain ordered a mobilization of his forces and to attack the retreating rebels, which later found themselves surrounded on all sides: north and south by rebel troops thanks to quick mobility of the army and east and west by sea. As a result the Spanish took heavy casualties and losses of equipment, and most of them became POWs. Those who managed to escape attempted to return, but news broke out that most of their Indio men had mutinied and took over Cavite Nuevo, causing them to surrender in droves.\n\nThe fall of Cavite reached the capital on June 25, and all of the bandit leaders were rewarded and retired. Some chose to become local chief of the cuadilleros in several barrios and towns. Parang was subsequently promoted to a general, but true to his word, he refused. Instead he took the position of alcalde mayor, and most Spanish officers were detained in Fort Santiago. Subsequent with the liberation of Cavite was the creation of the Asemblea de Cavite, the first, although localized form of an independent Philippine institution, followed by an assembly in Tondo.\n\nLaguna and Batangas campaigns\n\nAfter the fall of Cavite, the rebel leaders set their eyes on the province of Laguna. After resting for a while, they prepared their forces numbering about 2,000, and set foot on July 11 led by Juan Balat, a Lagueño who was also a bandit who joined Parang.\n\nFrom Muntinlupa, they took San Pedro Tunasan[8] without a fight, and advanced towards Biñan, where they found out that the entire municipality led by a defector of the principales, Juan Monica Mercado welcomed the rebels, and even allocated the local forces to the rebels. Mercado, despite being a respected figure among the Spanish, still nevertheless had some feuds with the friars about his hacienda. He saw the rebel movement as a tool to get rid of the friars, as well as seeing his native Laguna being ran by the Indios, both in the government and church alike.\n\nMercado himself joined the rebels under the ambitions of becoming the alcalde mayor of Laguna, which directly led him in conflict with Balat's own ambitions to become the alcalde mayor instead. Nevertheless, they put all of their differences and continued their march across the province.\n\nA voluntary irregular in Laguna who joined the rebel army\n\n​\n\nDuring their march across Laguna, defection of prominent principales was rampant, while peasants raided several friar lands.\n\nThe Spanish there finally decided to stop the advance once and met at Calauan at July 18, where they were soundly defeated by the better trained, and somewhat equipped rebel army of bandits-turned soldiers, irregulars and regulars in a series of skirmishes around the grasslands of the municipality. From there, they retreated back to Pila[9], the last municipality before Pagsanjan, the provincial capital. As a result, the Spanish fiercely defended the municipality, but due to several occasions of Indio soldiers defying orders, Pila fell on July 24, the same day of the battle. Afterwards, Mercado and Balat entered Pagsanjan, and celebrated by doing a victory march on its plaza.\n\nThe fall of Pagsanjan to the rebels caused the entirety of the province south of Paete[10] to surrender within rebel hands. Friars were often imprisoned, some escaped to the mountains and became monks, while the principalia faced harassment of lands, and some cases of lynching and mob attacks. Bandits in the province then surrendered and went back to their normal lives before they were forced into banditry.\n\nHowever, there were still some form of resistance up north of Paete, which was quickly subjugated by Balat, and a force from Andres, which unknowingly sent a force to assist the campaign at Laguna due to the belief that they were battling with the Spanish down south.\n\nBy July 28 all of Laguna was under rebel hands, after Infanta[11] surrendered without a fight the previous day.\n\nSimultaneous with the campaign in Laguna was another campaign in Batangas, led by Upay. Unlike in Laguna were there were large bandit activity but checked by Spanish forces occasionally, Upay entered Batangas with ease, in just 3 days from July 11 to 14. Balayan[12] surrendered by July 17 after a 3-day siege.\n\nThe battle of Mt. Macolod, on eastern Balayan began on July 18, just a day after the fall of Balayan proper to the rebels. The battle was famous for the first use of the Cuerpos Arqueros, an elite unit established by Upay himself, which was composed of the most skilled archers, but also riflemen who used handmade-guns found in the rural parts of Katagalugan. Since there are only few musketeers and granadiers stationed in the Philippines at this time, archers were still a major part of the local force, even though musketry has been expanded by the Spanish starting in the 18th century. The Cuerpos wore the first standardized uniform of any Philippine force excluding the Napoleonic-style uniforms of the Spanish army in the Philippines, characterized by wearing a long-sleeve baro, a long salaual, salacot with a red outline, and wide, red handkerchief on the shoulders.\n\nCuerpos Arqueros (bow illustration supposed to be much wider and larger lol)\n\n​\n\nWith these famed archers, combined with some well-trained regulars from former Spanish army regiments, the rebels managed to destroy the ill, panicked and disarray Spanish and its loyalists, beginning the fall of Batangas. After the battle, few skirmishes were exchanged at the outskirts of Batangas town on July 21, before the capital surrendered since it didn't want to suffer a long siege. As a result of this battle, along with the integration of free Tayabas into the empire, the rebels controlled much of the Tagalog heartland, and set the stage for the war to expand beyond it. Some coastal villages and some of the mountainous interior were taken by Spanish loyalist who continued to plague the rebels' control.\n\nThe dispute regarding the position of alcalde mayor of Laguna arrived at Manila on July 23, in which Andres suggested a compromise: Balat shall be the maestro de campo (commander of the province) while Mercado shall be the alcalde mayor, until elections were held in the near future. Upay was immediately named alcalde mayor of Batangas, where as the position of alcalde mayor of Tayabas remained vacant.\n\n[1] - Territory from the 1790s until 1856 included Rizal east of Cainta and Taytay and the northern and southern parts of the Quezon municipalities of Real and Mauban\n\n[2] - Territory before 1902 consisted merely of southern Quezon, renamed in 1946\n\n[3] - Territory until 1848 included Valenzuela (Polo until 1960) and excluded San Miguel (ceded 1848) and DRT(?)\n\n[4] - Divided into smaller municipalities until 1903\n\n[5] - Now Kawit (as of 1901), included much of Noveleta except the northern part until 1868\n\n[6] - Included Dasmariñas until 1867 (separated as Perez Dasmariñas, reannexed in 1903, separated and renamed in 1917)\n\n[7] - Former muncipality which currently comprises of northern Noveleta and southern Cavite City\n\n[8] - Now San Pedro (as of 1914), included before 1907 the Muntinlupa barangay of Tunasan (Tunasancillo until 1907)\n\n[9] - Included Victoria (Nanhaya until separated) until 1949\n\n[10] - Included Pakil (Paquil before the early 20th century) until 1676 and Kalayaan (separated as Longos) until 1909\n\n[11] - Included General Nakar until 1949 and Real until 1960\n\n[12] - Included Calaca until 1835, Tuy until 1866 (reannexed in 1903 and separated in 1911), Calatagan until 1912 and Lian until 1915 (itself included Nasugbu until 1947(?))\n\nAs news spread beyond the Tagalog provinces of the successful capture of Manila to the rebels, uprisings, mutinies and revolts erupted across the rest of Luzon, hoping to expel the Spanish in their home territories.\n\nRevolt in Ilocos\n\nThe provinces of Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur[1], freshly split since 1818 had just experienced a major revolt just 16 years earlier, had decided to revolt once more.\n\nEncouraged by the rebel victory at Laguna and Batangas, the Ilocanos, often led by the cailanes who were pardoned due to a revolt in 1814 and veterans of the Basi revolt in 1807, they started the revolt in Piddig on August 1, declaring allegiance to Andres I. It would the first of a series of revolts occurring outside of the Empire.\n\nA rebel captain in Ilocos training some Igorots that joined the revolt\n\nFlag of the Basi Revolt of 1807, reused by the Ilocanos in the revolt of 1823\n\n​\n\nRaising the banner of the 1807 revolt once more, the Ilocanos started their revolt on Piddig, and from there its spread to the municipalities of Sarrat, Dingras[2], Batac[3], and Vintar. Along the way numerous Ilocanos joined the rebels and they marched towards the capital, Laoag. A few cuadrilleros, some soldiers and Indio loyalist refused to open the roads towards Laoag, so the rebels besieged it on August 4. The capital surrendered after the municipalities of Bacarra was taken by force on August 5 and that Paoay[3] and San Nicolas joined the rebel cause the next day, as well as fears of massive looting of convents and private homes.\n\nAfter this recapture, the rest of Ilocos Norte surrendered to the rebels, therefore the attention of the rebels for now is Ilocos Sur, particularly Vigan. On August 7 a large force of 5,000 rebels marched from Badoc[3], reaching Magsingal by the 9th. There, they recruited hundreds more, while at the same time seizing haciendas for themselves and distributed evenly. However, they were forced into stalemate by a force of 300, who fiercely defended Santo Domingo, the town in which the Basi revolt came to an end.\n\nRevolt in Pangasinan\n\nPersonal standard of Palaris, used by some rebel groups in the province​\n\nStill in memory of the Pangasinenses are Palaris's revolt of 1762-1765, which was the second, and longest time that the Pangasinenses enjoyed freedom ever since it was conquered by the Spanish in 1576.\n\nPangasinan[4] once revolted on August 7, a week after Ilocos had revolted. However unlike in Ilocos, the revolt in Pangasinan was a series of simultaneous uprisings and Indio mutinies, often led by veterans, or their descendants of the Palaris revolt. Nevertheless it was considered a threat by the Spanish, as Pangasinan neighbored Pampanga[5], which was the location of Martinez's government. Immediately after the revolt began, Martinez hastily assembled a force of 900, 850 Kapampangans and 50 Spaniards to quell the already, disperse rebellions.\n\nA skirmish between Kapampangan soldiers of the Spanish and some Pangasinense rebels on the fields of Santa Barbara\n\n​\n\nDespite being vastly inferior to the Spanish, they achieved some form of victories, such as capturing Dagupan, a major town, and taking some northern municipalities, which cut the Spanish off from their comrades in Ilocos who continued to hold against the rebels there.\n\nRevolt in Bicol\n\nBicol was a peninsula south of the Luzon mainland, connected only by Tayabas. It is divided into two provinces: Ambos Camarines[6] and Albay[7]. Being the site of numerous shipyards, it was deemed of vital importance to the Spanish, as after the fall of Cavite, officials in the area expanded their presence on the two provinces.\n\nHowever, Bicol was also one of the most affected by rebellions throughout Philippine history, although most of it was unrecorded, or merely forgotten to history. As news had reached the peninsula and taking advantage of the chaos, the Palmero brothers named Antonio and Andres respectively, which reside in Ambos Camarines, started a rebellion in the town of Libmanan, about kilometers away from Nueva Caceres[8], the province's capital on August 13. From Libmanan however they decided to part ways, Andres went north while Antonio went south.\n\nAndres rapidly took over the entirety of the north, as most accepted Spanish rule. The municipalities of Daet[9] and Capalonga[10] continued to resist Andres and his forces, at the same time Antonio struggled to capture Nueva Caceres since it was highly defended by the Spanish. This caused the creation of the Milaor corridor, land in which neither controlled by either side. Banditry also appeared in parts of eastern Camarines and some parts of Albay.\n\nMeanwhile, down south, in Albay, Jose de Azcarraga, which recently returned from Manila, also started a rebellion. Taking place the same day as Camarines revolted, he marched to Legaspi and overthrowed the provincial government of Albay and installed himself as alcalde mayor. There was no resistance since most of the local populace, supported them.\n\n[1] - Territory until 1846 included Abra and the municipalites of Bangar, Luna (then Namacpacan) and Balaoan, excludes pre-1917 mountainous territory\n\n[2] - Included Banna until 1913 and Marcos until 1963\n\n[3] - All contained territories of Pinili, which became a municipality on 1920\n\n[4] - Territory until 1850 included La Union south of Balaoan and northern Tarlac, excluded territory west of Sual and the then Nueva Ecija municipalities of Balungao, Rosales, Umingan and San Quintin\n\n[5] - Territory from 1801 to 1848 inculded southern Tarlac, territories of the still huge municipalities of Gapan, Cabiao, San Antonio and Aliaga and San Miguel\n\n[6] - Territory included much of Tagkawayan, Quezon until its first partition on 1828\n\n[7] - Territory included Masbate until 1860, and Sorsogon until 1893\n\n[8] - Now Naga (as of 1919)\n\n[9] - Included Basud until 1902 (parts became Imelda in 1970, renamed San Lorenzo Ruiz in1989), Talisay until 1908 and Mercedes until 1948\n\n[10] - Included Santa Elena until the late 1960s\n\nOk, I have decided that this TL of a Philippine empire shall be continous, rather than being split into different timelines. The TL about a decentralized Spanish Philippines would continue however.\n\nWith all sides surrounded by enemies, Martinez became paranoid day by day, especially to the populace of Pampanga, which despite its reputation as one of the most loyal of all the ethnic groups in Luzon, since he considered even them to be potential of disloyalty and tension. Nevertheless, he called the cause of Spain to defeat the rebels, which by then was considered to be a major threat alongside various rebellions up north (who, unknown to Martinez were also aligned with the rebels in Manila).\n\nThe provinces of Nueva Ecija[1], Bataan and Zambales[2], were immediately garrisoned by elite Kapampangan troops in its major towns, to respond any streak of rebellion. Any considered to be allegedly support the Manileño rebels were detained, and forced into Spanish service.\n\nMeanwhile, Martinez appointed Pedro Macapagal, a descendant of Juan Macapagal who sided with the Spanish against Fransisco Maniago's 1660 rebellion, as the maestro de campo indio of all Spanish forces largely composed of natives. Martinez himself appointed Macapagal's son, Quirino who was born in 1797, as the leader of the mestizo volunteers. Although poorly trained and mostly unexperienced, save for the Macabebe Volunteers of Quirino, they departed, merely armed only with bolos, bows and arrows, and handmake bamboo lantakas on August 25, for Bulacan. At the same time Martinez sent another force of 300 to assist the Spanish forces in Pangasinan.\n\nA Manileño of the Army of Bulacan pulling a supply wagon for the troops\n\n​\n\nThe ill-equipped, and inexperienced Spanish force was in stark contrast to the rebels composed of Indios, mestizos, sangleys and insular Spanish officers, who were beginning to consider themselves Filipinos rather than the denonyms above. However, most of the now 9,000-Philippine force were mostly irregulars, only about 500, mostly from former regiments were to be considered regulars, and nevertheless they were more-well behaved since the leaders did not want themselves and the movement to be see as brutal and cruel, even for an irregular force in a normal army. Most of them were also trained by using archery, some musketry from the captains of the Cuerpos Arqueros unit and of several regiments.\n\nAlthough also lacking in supplies of food like the Spanish, they were nevertheless able to live off the land, since most farmers they encountered cheered their arrival as liberators, and as a token of gratitude, they would give some of their crop yield, and in some cases: livestock as the emperor Andres I promised in his reign the abolition of the tobacco monopoly, in place since Basco. The army was led by Calba, the northernmost commander. They were sent to the sparse province on August 23, two days earlier than the Spanish.\n\nThey first had an encounter at the capital, Bulacan[3], on August 26 in which the Spanish, despite being severely inexperienced fought since they were led into believing that the rebels were only armed with mere spears, daggers and bows. They were decisively defeated and this led to the rapid fall of the province.\n\nOn August 29, another battle occurred at Quingua[4], in which the Spanish attempted to stop the rebel advance by using their horses as an advantage. While it certainly did inflict damage on the rebels, it was nothing compared to the carabao charge led by farmers-turned cavalrymen, using pincer tactics as well as riding some of the Cuerpos that shot poisonous arrows to the Spanish, followed by a deadly infantry charge.\n\nA last attempt occurred at Baliuag[5] on August 31, where this time the Spanish used the bravery and determination of their, mostly Kapampangan troops to halt the advance of the rebels, this too failed. These military failures increased resentment among the Kapampangans, which were now convinced that they were used as cannon fodder against the \"inexperienced rebels\", of whom they suffered 2,000 casualties. Nevertheless, their bravery and determination to fight was admired by Calba, which taught his troops that the Kapampangans were of a model of a soldier's bravery, resillence and loyalty.\n\n[1] - Territory until 1848 included the Pangasinense municipalities of Balungao, Rosales, Umingan and San Quintin, Aurora, Quezon north of Mauban (incl. Pollilo Islands), and the entire eastern coast of the Cagayan Valley(?), excluded the then still huge municipalities of Gapan, Cabiao, San Antonio and Aliaga\n\n[2] - Territory until 1903 included the entirety of Pangasinan west of Sual\n\n[3] - Now Bulakan (as of the 1900s)\n\n[4] - Now Plaridel (as of 1936)\n\n[5] - Now Baliuag (as of the 20th century), included Bustos until 1860 (reannexed in 1903 and separated in 1916)\n\nPreparations for Pampanga's conquest\n\nAfter the conquest of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija joined the rebel movement on September 1 by imprisoning the friars and the alcalde mayor, establishing a government, an assembly and joined the Empire, requesting a new alcalde mayor for them. In response, he appointed his own brother Mariano as the de facto alcalde mayor, all but in name. By this time, Cagayan[1] too had been overran by bandits and rebels seeking for the Empire, and only Pampanga, and a handful of territory in Bicol and Ilocos remained Spanish. The army at this time had swelled to nearly 11,000, after 2,000 men from Bulacan and Nueva Ecija had joined the Empire. But this time, Andres decided to temporarily halt military campaigns as his troops were already tired and susceptible to mutiny.\n\nIn the mean time, Andres decided that the time had come to train these, mostly irregular troops into a formidable fighting force. He asked about Mariano about the matter, in which he suggested that only about 5,000 shall be trained as regulars, the other 5,000 remaining irregulars to serve as mercenary forces, while the 1,000 remaining shall be created as the Guardia Provincial de Tondo, the first of numerous provincial guards yet to be established.\n\nTo start, Andres formally established the Philippine Imperial Army on September 22, composed of the already existing units prior and during the revolt, like the King's Regiment (renamed the Emperor's Guard), Luzon Dragoons, Luzon Hussars, the urban militia of Manila and other municipalities such as those of Tondo, Mariquina and Tambobong, and the disciplinaries and provincial units in several provinces, the Cuerpos Arqueros, and the vast, vast number of irregulars. Doing so would require many criollo captains to train the irregulars, in which many willingly trained them. The drills and training lasted until early November, which was based on a drill manual written by the emperor himself.\n\nMost of the weapons used by the infantry were smuggled Qing-made guns purchased by some wealthy sangleys, handmade rifles such as surit-surit and sumpak, the bow and arrow, muskets left by the Spanish, bamboo pikes and bladed weapons. For the cavalry they utilized carabaos, as there were a severe lack of horses roaming in the wild to tame, and because they were numerous. The artillery was mostly bamboo lantakas, along with some typical ones. The uniform was still largely the typical baro-salaual-handkerchief on the shoulder/bandana type.\n\nFor the irregulars, they were mostly trained by Parang and his contemporaries, since they were well known to use bandit tactics, perfect for a mercenary force. They were trained for merely 3 weeks, as they intend to learn more about guerilla tactics than military ones. By November all of them were ready, with the irregulars being renamed the Mercenarios de Parang, the Imperial Regiment was added alongside the 2,500 force each under Andres I, while the 5,000 regular force were divided into 20 regiments composed of 250 each:\n\nInfantry Regiments​\n\nCavalry Regiments​\n\n1st Infantry Regiment (Tondo, named after their garrison at Tondo)\n\n2nd Infantry Regiment (San Isidro, named after St. Isidore the Laborer)\n\n3rd Infantry Regiment (La Naval, named after Our Lady of La Naval)​\n\n4th Infantry Regiment (Guadalupe, named after their garrison at Guadalupe, San Pedro Macati)\n\n5th Infantry Regiment (Soliman, named after Rajah Sulayman of Maynila)\n\n6th Infantry Regiment (Tinajeros, named after their garrison at Tinajeros, Tambobong)\n\n7th Infantry Regiment (Lagundi, named after the organic plant found within its garrison at the banks of Estero de Vitas)\n\n8th Infantry Regiment (San Luis, named after St. Louis XII of France)\n\n9th Infantry Regiment (Laureana, named after Andres I's wife, Laureana San Lucas, born 1804)\n\n10th Infantry Regiment (Dalahican, named after their garrison at Dalahican)\n\n11th Infantry Regiment (Don Galo, named after their garrison at Don Galo, Parañaque)\n\n12th Infantry Regiment (Malhacan, named after their garrison at Malhacan, Meycauayan)\n\n13th Cavalry Regiment (Tabuco, named after the old name of Cabuyao, Laguna where they are garrisoned)\n\n14th Cavalry Regiment (Dagat-Dagatan, named after their garrison at Dagat-Dagatan, Caloocan)\n\n15th Cavalry Regiment (San Juan, named after John the Baptist)\n\n16th Cavalry Regiment (San Agustin, named after St. Augustine of Hippo)\n\n17th Cavalry Regiment (Tagumpay, named after the Tagalog word for victory)\n\n18th Cavalry Regiment (Tipas, named after their garrison at Tipas, Taguig)\n\n19th Cavalry Regiment (Manggahan, named after the numerous mango trees near their garrison)\n\n20th Cavalry Regiment (Santol, named after their garrison at Santol, Bigaa[2]\n\nThe 5,000 force was divided between Andres I and Mariano, with Calba being the primary guard back home.\n\nMain regimental standard model for all regiments\n\n​\n\nArmy and naval flag\n\n​\n\nAt the same time as the founding of the army, Andres established the navy and appointed Jose Antonio de Ynchausti, as its first naval commander. Ynchausti, who has a reputation for shipbuilding and facilitating trade between Spain and New Granada[3], was a top choice for the majority of the military personnel, and seeing this as a way to expand his business and to help the rebel cause, he accepted this new position of his. Mainly composed of sailors who had experience rowing large vessels in trade, were ready in case for a blockade for Martinez's escape.\n\nA guilalo in the Philippine Navy\n\n​\n\nBeginning of the conquest\n\nLargely ready, the 10,000 force left for Pampanga on November 3, after All Souls Day in which they paid homage to their deceased loved ones. When they reached Baliuag, the Mercenarios largely dispersed themselves into the wild.\n\nThey reached Pampanga by November 5, in which they faced significant resistance at Macabebe[4]. Deciding that it would be better to first tackle the capital rather than engage directly in combat, they went ahead until they reached Apalit, where they met their first significant resistance. The 2,000 poorly-armed Kapampangans stationed in the area by Macapagal fiercely defended the area, but they were instantly defeated owing to the sudden maneuvers of the Mercenarios, which pounced upon the belagueared Kapampangans in the rear.\n\nTroops sent to defend Bacolor\n\n​\n\nAfter that battle, they went on and reached Santo Tomas, where the Filipinos launched a 9-day siege of the town, from November 8 to 17, where the Kapampangans laid booby traps, but to no avail. Nevertheless, the Filipinos decided to starve the town that forced them to surrender on November 17. They ultimately decided to halt their advance, as they feared for a Kapampangan reprisal due to the recent siege they caused. During this time, Mariano went south and took Macabebe after 3-day battle from November 21-24, which was a heavy loss against the Spanish considering most of their professional troops came from that municipality, the other being Arayat.\n\nFinally, Martinez hastily organized a large force of 3,000 to defend Bacolor, while sending another force of about 2,000 led by Pedro Macapagal to distract Mariano in the south, from the information he gained through spies.\n\nBattle of San Fernando\n\n​\n\nDesparate to halt the Filipino advance, which was happening quickly at a rapid pace, Martinez departed Bacolor on November 26, where they met at San Fernando, just east of Bacolor. There, Andres sent an ultimatum to Martinez, demanding their surrender, and in exchange he would grant the governor-general the right to leave the country, and to recognize it as independent. However, not wanting to be seen in Spain as a failure, Martinez refused. Another ultimatum was sent to Martinez on November 28, but this was also the one he refused. A third ultimatum was sent, which, too was refused on December 1.\n\nRealizing he could not convince Martinez to surrender, he now believed the only way to let him surrender was through war, so he readied his forces and advanced on to the plains on December 5, initially began with the sound of cannonfire. Martinez however had trained his troops using the oblique order, and so he gathered his forces mostly on one flank, which caused one side of Andres to collapse, and all of a sudden, Andres's army had violently dispersed due to panic and shock. Andres himself was almost captured by two cazadores hadn't by his quick riding of his horse. It looked like that Martinez was able to gain a victory, particularly a decisive one, when all of a sudden, the regiments of Tinajeros and Tabuco decided to bravely charge at the flank by deploying cannons at each rear and fired relentlessly.\n\nThis was highly important since the one they had surrounded and bombarded was mainly the supply train and most of the professional cazadores, which, coincided with the sudden timely raid by the Mercenarios had dealt a decisive blow on the Spanish, and now they were the ones that retreated. Andres's army marched to Bacolor and raised the Philippine bicolor on the plaza, symbolizing the victory and resillence of the common Filipino against the Spanish.\n\nAll of a sudden, when news reached throughout Pampanga the decisive defeat, the entire province turned into chaos.\n\nRetreat of Martinez to Iloilo and restoration of order\n\nWith all hopes of defeating the rebels in Luzon destroyed, Martinez decided to retreat to Iloilo to fight another day.\n\nThe retreat was characterized by sources as a chaotic, unorganized and quick one, in par with the Braganza's parting for Brazil in 1807. From Sexmoan[5], they reached Balanga on a 3-day journey from December 9 to 12, and laden with over 3 ships carrying him and over 400 loyalists and soldiers, they departed, reaching Mindoro in the afternoon, and from there, departed towards Iloilo from the 16th to 18th.\n\nWith now full control of the province, Andres placed Mariano's captive, Pedro Macapagal as the alcalde mayor of Pampanga to calm the situation down, and as a way of reconcillation between rebels and loyalists alike, though under heavy suspicion. Mariano and his force garrisoned over 500 troops in the capital, Bacolor, while he and his army pacify Pampanga north of Arayat from December 17, up until New Years' Eve, 31.\n\nThe rest of Manila erupted to celebration after the news reached them on January. A procession in honor of the Virgin Mary was made by secular Indio priests, under Mariano Gomes of Santa Cruz, Manila. In honor of the Tinajeros and Tabuco regiments, Andres I commissioned a marching song after the war, which became their regimental march.\n\n[1] - Territory until 1839 consisted of Cagayan Valley (except Batanes and the its eastern coast) and Cordillera (except Abra)\n\n[2] - Now Balagtas (as of 1966)\n\n[3] - Now composed of the countries of Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, as well as parts of Peru, Brazil and Guyana\n\n[4] - Included Masantol until 1878\n\n[5] - Now Sasmuan (as of 1991)\n\nWhile the Spanish were in disarray and had to face several dangers, the Filipinos took the time to formally organize its government and institutions. They also took the time to rest their soldiers for a while before continuing on towards the remaining Spanish territories.\n\nLand reforms\n\nOne of the biggest issues in Spanish Philippines is all about land reform, who should own it and how it should be acquired. Numerous haciendas all over the country were owned by friars, some by the principalia. Native landowners were deprived the right to farm and own their land, and usually when they filed complaints to retrieve their lands back, it was usually the friars that came out victorious. One major exception was Tayabas, where unlike the hacienda-ridden provinces such as Cavite, Laguna and Tondo, the natives owned and managed most of their land, according to an 1823 report by a Spanish friar in the area. If there are haciendas, most of the time they were few.\n\nIndio laborer on a hacienda\n\n​\n\nThere is also the notorious tobacco monopoly of the government, which despite making the Philippines self-sufficient from Mexico and mainland Spain, and even began the era of agricultural advancements over the Philippines, it was a burden to all farmers since they couldn't even plant the usual crop such as rice, and most of them were forced to sell exclusively towards the Spanish. Farmers that were caught planting their own tobacco and then selling it privately were apprehended.\n\nSince the government already seized a huge portion of the haciendas, the main issue is how it would be distributed to the peasants. Some of the commanders, such as Calba and Mariano took some lands for themselves. Andres also took some land but as government property. Andres didn't want to encounter an angry mob outside the Palacio as well as to portray his government as a stark contrast to the Spanish. There is also the issue of more flat plains and valleys yet to be settled by thousands. And what the soldiers would receive since the coffers are dry for payment. For this Andres took more land and titled it under his name, taking only some lands in his native Tondo, with most of them being reserved for the soldiers.\n\nFortunately at this time, the population back then was only 2.1 million without the Moros and other non-Christians, and half of them was in Luzon. And some of the largest haciendas were located in provinces whose interior is sparse. Andres distributed the hacienda land one by one, hacienda by hacienda. The first haciendas to be divided among farmers, peasants, some retired military personnel and former bandits were in the provinces of Tondo and Cavite. In Cavite, the policy was largely successful as it encouraged numerous bandit groups to return and settle back to their normal lives, with the help of Parang. Some haciendas were kept by officers and politicians. Tobacco lands that were deemed to valuable to be distributed became state-owned plantations.\n\nLarge swathes of land in the sparse Cagayan province remain for sale, with few being distributed for each farmer. This would set the future migrations of Ilocanos from their homes at Ilocos. Andres also pursued a policy of repoblacion in the otherwise sparse or uninhabited portions of the island.\n\nTo ensure its success Andres sent messengers to spread this program of distribution.\n\nEconomic reforms\n\nFor hundreds of years, the Spanish dominated trade in the archipelago since time immemorial. They also prohibited the archipelago from trading with other states, such as the Japanese, English, Dutch, etc. Only trade from China, and from there to Mexico in the port of Acapulco on what would became known as the galleon trade until 1815, when it was discontinued due to the Mexican War of Independence. Nevertheless, the Chinese dominated most of Philippine industries.\n\nA galleon\n\n​\n\nHowever, with Basco's reforms, by the the end of the 18th century the Philippines was largely self-sufficient thanks to advances into agriculture and especially the tobacco monopoly that gave them massive revenue. It was also during this point that two companies: Real Compañia de Filipinas and the Sociedad Económicas de Amigos del País were established by the Spanish to facilitate trade among outsiders. Some restrictions on traders especially those of British and American origin were relaxed, allowing new ideas and products to be introduced.\n\nEntering the 19th century, once again foreign traders and idead began to be restricted, as demonstrated by a massacre in 1820 against foreigners since rumors circulate that they had spread cholera among the native population. With the advent of the war in 1823, the Filipinos took control of the Real Compañia, while the Sociedad was at this point, dissolved.\n\nMeeting of Andres with his ministers regarding the company\n\n​\n\nAndres initially wanted to reform the company, but by this time it was in serious decline, since most of the merchants either sailed their own ways, or instead traded with other powers such as the British. To prevent its total decline, the company was privatized, and Andres ordered them to conduct trade with other countries, most notably the British and the Dutch. Tariffs against foreign traders were removed, and all of a sudden foreigners began flooding towards Philippine-controlled territory, establishing numerous firms, of which the largest number was British, enough to garner attention from Britain itself.\n\nSeveral ports were opened to facilitate trade, the first to be opened were the ports of Sual, Dagupan and Agoo in Pangasinan, where it is closer than Manila, and also numerous tobacco and other goods were already being produced in Pangasinan. Others soon followed in the near future.\n\nPolitical organization\n\nThe following administrative divisions that were located in Luzon as of 1824 were:\n\nTondo\n\nBulacan\n\nPampanga\n\nZambales\n\nCavite\n\nLaguna\n\nNueva Ecija\n\nCagayan\n\nTayabas\n\nBatangas\n\nMindoro (military commandancy)\n\nIlocos Norte\n\nIlocos Sur\n\nPangasinan\n\nBatanes (military commandancy)\n\nAmbos Camarines\n\nAlbay\n\nBataan\n\nThe city of Manila, which was located in Tondo province, was separated by decree on June 11, as a free city, becoming the first of its kind. It was also under the direct control of the Emperor and his Imperial Assembly. Afterwards, the capital was relocated to Tondo proper. Each province established its own assembly, and government. Most gobernadorcillos remained in power, some being removed as a result of their loyalist tendencies. Other free cities would be established in the Philippines, although as component parts of provinces, commadancies and districts.\n\nSome in Pampanga campaigned the return of Nueva Ecija and Bataan to their territories, as the latter two were sparse, had no economic value and was mostly dependent on Bulacan, Pampanga and Pangasinan for their industries. This was supported by the principalia of Pampanga led by the alcalde mayor Macapagal, who saw it as a way to dominate Philippine politics in favor of Spain. However, Andres, under Mariano's influence snuffed at the idea since he did not want any province to challenge central authority, due to fears of regionalism arising with the empire.\n\nThere is also the Ilocos question, where Ilocanos were divided on whether the two provinces should be reunited or not. Those who advocated for reunification reside in the major towns and the two capitals, while those who sided with the current status quo reside in the rancherias and other towns.\n\nReligious overhaul\n\nJuan Antonio Zulaibar, the archbishop of Manila died on March 4, 1824, therefore leaving the position vacant.\n\nThe Indio and insular friars and seculars took this as an advantage since Zulaibar was among those who pursue the sole management of all parishes in the Philippines should be turned over to the peninsulars instead. The archbishop also opposed Andres's rule over the islands, only being pressured to do so days before his death.\n\nSeal of the Archdiocese of Manila, pre-1949\n\n​\n\nWith the death of Zulaibar the peninsular friars suffered a major blow, as their primary supporter was now nonexistent and dead. Mariano Gomes de los Angeles, a secular priest of Imus, Cavite was the one that led the secularization movement, that began when Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa initiated the secularization project in the 1780s, that had a lasting effect on the church in the Philippines. Andres and the seculars formed an alliance, with the primary goal turning over the parishes to native clergy. They subsequently placed Hilarion Diaz as a temporary replacement of Zulaibar.\n\nHilarion Diaz\n\n​\n\nHowever, Andres had come to his realization that full-on secularization would most likely cause a conflict with the Catholic Church as a whole, and so he decided to sign an agreement with the regulars. It was agreed that the native clergy would indeed manage the parishes, but the seculars, notably friars would manage the facilitation of the remaining pagans to Christianity. With no other choice, the seculars agreed to this, and so began the uneasy relationship between the two sides that would last very well into the 20th century.\n\nPrelude and execution\n\nAfter nearly half a year of rest and drilling, the Philippine army was now ready for their invasion into the Visayan islands. Initially they wanted to launch a conquest, some wanted to just raid the islands before the conquest, and some wanted a bombardment of native villages along the coast. Ultimately, they convened on August 17 in the Arzobispal, as permitted by the tempo-archbishop Diaz.\n\nThere they forged a plan known as El Grande Bloqueo (lit. \"the grand blockade\"), a plan designed to takeover the entirety of the Visayas, first by blockading any routes that could choke trade with other places in the islands or China, that would cause them to surrender. The plan involved using Palawan as a launching pad for their blockade, firstly aimed at the former lands of the Panay confederation.\n\nFor this they readied their fleet, mostly composed of karakoas and joangas numbering 50, along with 5 ships captured from the port of Cavite, laden with over 10,000 (8,000 for the karakoas and 2,000 for the galleons) men and supplies, along with thousands of rowers, which were additional soldiers. The tradition of building these ships, of which renowned for their bird-like mobility, was revived by Ynchausti accompanied by shipbuilidng masters in Pampanga and Batangas when he took on charge as admiral of the navy. Built primarily of bamboo, it took them approximately 3 months from April to July from the conquest of Pampanga in January until June, where it was used for transporting troops primarily, while the ordinary battleships were laden with equipment, ammunition and artillery.\n\nThe fleet shall be divided into two: one for the blockade while the other for the conquest of Panay, Romblon and western Negros. The blockade fleet of 50 karakoas, led by Matias Guiang, a famed and mighty seafarer of Ilocos shall sail towards the opening of the Panay Gulf and the Tablas Strait, as well as other Visayan waterways, then subdivide the karakoa fleet into 10 each for the major towns in southern Iloilo[1] and western Negros[2] to surround its waters, in which after the surrenders, only they then could converge onto the shores and from there the conquests shall commence. Ynchausti on the other hand that led the galleon fleet, shall provide each galleon for every 10 karakoa onto every major town they have docked.\n\nA karakoa\n\n​\n\nOn September 1, after garnering additional supplies, the galleons left first, primarily because the trip would take 1-2 days before arriving in Panay, let alone if the winds tend to blow much faster. The galleons docked at the town of Bugasong, where they immediately took control as a their temporary base. 2 days later, Guiang led his fleet of karakoas first conquered the entirety of Palawan island and its outer islands with ease in just 3 days, where they recruited more troops. After that, they left on September 6, arriving that same night at Bugasong, the place where they agreed to assemble and conquer.\n\nFrom Bugasong, they divided the fleet into 10 karakoas and 1 galleon, headed towards the following towns:\n\nSan Jose de Buenavista​\n\nAntique[3]​\n\nOton​\n\nArevalo[4]​\n\nIloilo[5]​\n\nJaro[4]​\n\nIlog[6]​\n\nHimamaylan​\n\nBacolod​\n\nCapiz[7]​\n\nConquest of Panay and Negros\n\nThe fleets destined for blockade in Panay sailed towards them on September 10, where they initiated blockades. Initially, they went well as trade was already stagnant due to the Moro raids continuing to intensify and internal strife was beginning to rear against the oppresive hacienderos and principalias. To Guiang and his men's surprise, the people welcomed them and hoped that they would be the one defending them from the devestating Moro raids. Seeing this as an advantage, the Filipino rebels marched across the Antiqueño and Ilonggo interior uninterrupted, mostly succeeding.\n\nThe first resistance to the Filipinos was at San Jose de Buenavista, the capital of Antique. The capital refused to surrender, so the fleet decided to intensify their blockade by calling reinforcements from the recently subdued Antique town combined with a land siege. The town surrendered in less than half a day due to the lantaka bombardments and a rumor that the rebels shall set fire to the entire town. This resulted in the entire province going to the Filipinos. With the entirety of Antique fully occupied, its fleet sailed towards Capiz province to conquer that next.\n\nIn Iloilo, they had a much more difficult time in subduing the province, as the major towns which hold the bulk of the population such as Oton, Iloilo and it suburbs, Jaro, and other towns who continued to be loyal to Spain. Most of the Ilonggo interior however, gradually fell as either they were sparse, underdeveloped or a nest for revolutionaries as early as March. Guiang then ordered his fleet to sail towards Capiz first, while continuing the sieges of the major towns. Their main objective at Iloilo is to capture Martinez, to their dismay he escaped after he learnt of a Filipino fleet capturing a town in Antique, leaving for Cebu.\n\nCapiz fell in a mere week from September 19-26, as most of the populace was concentrated on the coast and thus, easy to occupy. Romblon was occupied entirely on September 27.\n\nIn Negros, the conquest went smoothly as Ynchausti himself or some fleets captured the major towns of Negros, while the other karakoas would just land in the coastal areas and occupy them without a fight.\n\nOverall, the conquest was smooth and quick, as well as having the advantage of the locals' support with the exception of few towns. The conquest was done by October, after the towns of Iloilo, Oton and Jaro surrendered on the 4th.\n\nFormal amalgamation of Bohol\n\nAfter the conquest of Negros. Guiang, on Mariano's orders on October 10 went towards Bohol, where the Dagohoy revolt had been still active since 1744. By this time Bohol was on the verge of becoming Spanish again, where it not for the genius guerilla tactics of the Boholanos.\n\nThe Dagohoy diplomats recieved the request on the 12th when some rebels fishing reported the authorities spotted karakoas waving the red-blue bicolor. They knew that this was the Filipino rebels that Dagohoy had been talking about and they immediately gave them a welcome on the town of Inabanga[8], the starting point of Dagohoy's rebellion as well as his birthplace. Dagohoy personally welcomed Guiang's men into their hideout in the mountains, where they agreed to a agreement on October 15.\n\nMeeting of leaders at Inabanga, with Guiang, some insular sea captains and Dagohoy's men\n\n​\n\nThere, on the 15th they formally met to draft discussions with Guiang. The latter offered Dagohoy the position of alcalde mayor of Bohol until his death would separate the island as a province after the war, and that he would be granted the exclusive right of monopoy of all trade from the central government in Manila for 30 years. In return, Dagohoy offered Guiang his method of communal farming (open-field system), which according to him would help eradicate the haciendas of the friars and loyalist principales on the rest of the island. After signing the agreement, Bohol, at least in terms of occupation was formally a part of the Philippines.\n\nA siege of Tagbilaran, the capital ensued on October 24 that lasted until November 3, after nearly a long period of besiegement and bombardments.\n\n[1] - Territory until 1992 included Guimaras\n\n[2] - Divided into Negros Oriental and Occidental in 1890\n\n[3] - Now Hamtic (as of the 1900s)\n\n[4] - Now districts of Iloilo City\n\n[5] - Only consisted of the city proper until 1903\n\n[6] - Included Kabankalan (separated as Cavancalan) until 1830\n\n[7] - Territory included Romblon until 1853 (reannxed 1907 and 1942, separated 1918 and 1945 respectively) and Aklan until 1958\n\n[8] - Included Clarin until 1919, and parts of Sagbayan (separated as Borja until renamed 1957) until 1949\n\nIn OTL, the Novales (Andres) couple had no offspring.\n\nAs the year of 1825 had begun, the Philippine empire now composed of the main islands of the Spanish East Indies, with Cebu and northern Mindanao, as well as the Marianas remaining under Spanish control. Also, it was also the year where Andres's wife, Laureana San Lucas was pregnant, therefore securing the line of succession as well as being used against the Spanish claim that San Lucas was barren. Previously, Mariano was the heir apparent to the imperial throne.\n\nNews about the relative success in Visayas had made the emperor very satisfied, and now he is in the belief that their newly found nation had secured its path of destiny towards independence. Everybody from the lower class to the high-ranking members of the government were now excited how this newly established nation shall perform. In the recently conquered territories, Philippine independence had mixed reactions. Those in eastern Visayas and the isolated, and overtaxed regions in Panay supported it, while those living in the major towns and lowlands are skeptical, but nevertheless supported independence. Some even aspired to become future figures in the mid-19th century.\n\nDuring this time, his staff persuaded him to take Cebu first, then after Northern Mindanao shall be next, since it would only take a few karakoas to take the major towns and proclaim Philippine rule there. Andres, however, had different plans. He initially wanted the Spanish surrender to be completely symbolic, in a letter to Jose de la Cruz, a poet he assigned to teach his son and that of Mariano that:\n\n\"...the surrender of the Spanish shall not only be a reminder of our homeland's independence, but also a symbolic one, which was a reminiscent of the chief Calipulapo (Lapulapu) of Mactan's victory against them on the 27th of April, the 1521st year of our Lord, in where we shall remind the Spanish that their rule shall end in the very island they first set on under Legazpi...\"\n\n​\n\nFragment of Andres I's letter to Jose de la Cruz, January 18, 1825​\n\nHe also wanted that the surrender of the Spanish shall take place in the very exact day of the battle of Mactan, further adding humiliation upon them.\n\nWhen February had arrived, Andres sent emissaries to Ynchausti in Negros for the conquest of northern Mindanao, and his symbolic plan of taking Cebu at the final moment. It also stated that the conquest should be done by 2 weeks, which seems pretty impossible to others' view. But, with the mobility of the karakoa, Ynchausti obliged, and readied only 2,000 men on 5 karakoas, and departed on the 3rd since the troops, this time mostly composed of Visayans from Panay and Negros had largely been trained by their Luzon counterparts, as well as being skilled to row and maneuver a karakoa.\n\nArriving the next day, they landed on Butuan[1], the main town, they immediately took control with the locals' support, and from there they sailed to the other major towns of northern Mindanao. The garrison towns in eastern Mindanao was captured much later. The last major town apart from Zamboanga southwards was Cagayan de Misamis[2] on Feburary 14. All in all, the conquest was pretty swift since Misamis had less people than the municipality of Tondo at the time, and most of the locals there are either prisoners, rebels deported to Mindanao or the Visayans there. Misamis itself was later converted as a military commandancy (equivalent to a territory by Phil. standards) after independence.\n\nAside from the conquest, the sultanates of Lanao were the first of the Moros to acknowledge Philippine suzerainty, as protectorate all but in paper.\n\n[1] - Included Cabadbaran until 1894 (separated as Tolosa, itself included RTR until 1982), Las Nieves until the late 1900s, Nasipit (itself included Carmen until 1949) until 1929, Buenavista until 1937 and Magallanes until 1969\n\n[2] - Now Cagayan de Oro (as of 1950?), included Alubijid (itself included Gitagum until 1961 and Laguindingan until 1963) until 1940 and El Salvador (itself included Opol until 1950) until 1948"
