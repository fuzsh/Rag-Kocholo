        "text": "Barasoain Church\n\nA national shrine, the historic Barasoain Church is the site of the Constitutional Convention of the first Philippine Republic, making the Philippines the very first Asian Government to promulgate a Constitution. It was the Seat of the First Philippine Republic on Sept. 15, 1898 to the last week of Feb. 1899 under the presidency of Pedro Paterno. In its convent the Universidad Literaria Cientifica de Filipinas was first housed. It also boasts of a light and sound museum under the management of National Historical Institute.\n\nOld Train Station\n\nBuilt sometime in 1896, the Estacion de Guiguinto (Guiguinto Old Train Station) of the Philippine National Railways is the town's most acclaimed historical landmark and heritage site. It was upon this site that around 200 Katipuneros fought for the cause of Filipino freedom led by Capt. Inocencio Tolentino. They ambushed a group of Spaniards on the night of 27 May 1898, including the parish friar of Guiguinto, Fr. Leocadio Sanchez, who brought cruelty to the natives in his regime. The incident inspired Severino Reyes to author one of the most famous zarzuela in the country \"Walang Sugat\" which was later made into a movie in 1939 and 1957.\n\nBagbag Bridge\n\nSite of the longest battle between the Americans and Filipinos led by General Gregorio del Pilar which took place in April 25, 1899. The bridge now standing serves as a reminder of the valor displayed by the Filipino who triumphed against the American forces.\n\nBattle of Quingua\n\nFilipinos are well-known to be courageous and freedom lovers. The people of Plaridel are no exception. The marker commemorates the historic Battle of Quingua (Plaridel at present) where the Filipinos triumphed over the American forces in their fight for freedom. Likewise, it also commemorates the death of Col. John Stotsenberg—a prominent figure of the Philippine-American war.\n\nCasa Real Shrine\n\nA printing press during the Malolos Republic, the Casa Real was restored in 1852 and converted into a municipal library. It is now a museum under the management of the National Historical Institute and serves as the final repository of still existing memorabilia.\n\nSimborio Chapel\n\nOne of the town’s major attractions is the Simborio Chapel. One of the oldest existing structure from the Spanish era, believed to have been constructed in the 1800s, is said to have been greatly unique from other similar structures because of its remarkably rather low height or elevation.\n\nSt. John the Baptist Church\n\nBuilt in 1572, the St. John the Baptist Church is the oldest church in Bulacan. Constructed under the supervision of Augustinian priest Fr. Diego Vivar-Ordoñez, the church had been witness to the Filipino’s struggle against Spanish, American and Japanese rule. Inside the church is a tunnel that, according to history, was used by priests during the Spanish regime to keep gold, religious statues, and ornate jewelry hidden from the sight of treasure hunters. Likewise, it is in this tunnel where revolutionaries and Spaniards were buried during the war. This was also Gen. Tanaka’s (Japanese Imperial Army) last battlefield.\n\nTecson House\n\nThree sons of original owners were all officers of the revolutionary army of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. For sometime, this house was used as the headquarters of Aguinaldo. The house is now owned by Mr. and Mrs. Cenen Mendiola. Simon Tecson is the Original Owner.\n\nEnriquez Ancestral House\n\nConstructed during the 1850s, it is one of the ancestral houses found in San Jose, Bulacan, Bulacan. Some of the documents of Marcelo H. del Pilar were found in this house. It houses a museum of rare antiques and historical artifacts. It is presently owned by acclaimed Filipino food historian Milagros Enriquez.\n\nFrancisca Reyes Aquino Shrine\n\nUnder the management of the National Historical Institute, this shrine was erected in honor of Francisca Reyes Aquino, the recipient of the National Artist Award for her significant contributions to the development of Philippine arts and to the cultural heritage of the country, particularly in the field of native dance.\n\nBasilica Minore De Immaculada conception\n\nThis historic church was in 1896 the seat of power of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo—the first president of the Republic of the Philippines. Located in front of the Basilica Minore is a century-old tree known as the Kalayaan Tree (Tree of Freedom) which was planted by Pres. Aguinaldo during a lull in the historic Malolos Convention. It is presently the seat of the Diocese of Malolos, and has been the bastion of faith for the past centuries.\n\nBulacan Museum\n\nThe Museo ng Bulacan (Bulacan Museum) houses a collection of valuable relics and mementos, articles, documents and handicrafts of the Philippine revolution. Located in Malolos to promote the cultural heritage and tradition of the province. It is under the management of the Provincial Government of Bulacan.\n\nMarcelo H. Del Pilar Shrine\n\nMarcelo H. del Pilar—patriot, writer, editor of the revolutionary paper La Solidaridad—is honored with this monument in Bulacan where he lived most of his life. The shrine is under the management of the National Historical Institute.\n\nSan Agustin Parish Church\n\nConstructed between 1769 to 1774, the style of Baliuag church is Baroque as seen on the facade and interiors. Dramatic tension is created by the interplay of volumes and openings. The Practico is the latest addition which mars the complete layout of style."
