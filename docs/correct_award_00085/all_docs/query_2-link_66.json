        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn Churchill: Walking with Destiny (2018), Andrew Roberts wrote that works about Sir Winston had exceeded 1000. This catalogue piles on, listing more than 1150, about 900 of which we have annotated. Winston Churchill was the subject of his first biography in 1905 when he was 30 years old. The flow hasn’t stopped. Here in the 21st century, 100 years later, some years see over 20 new Churchill titles.\n\nThe word “works” denotes any item individually published, from brief pamphlets to books large and small. Compiling and describing them is the purpose of this online listing, which will be updated seriatim. I hope it will serve as a living guide to the vast literature on the Greatest Briton.\n\nThis catalogue would not exist without the efforts of two bibliographic pioneers, H. Ashley Redburn (1914-1996) and Curt J. Zoller (1920-2014). They worked separately, and then together, updating their findings through the Churchill Societies. Curt also co-authored (with Michael McMenamin) Becoming Winston Churchill: The Untold Story of Winston and his American Mentor. Ashley’s work abides, not least with the Hillsdale College Churchill Project. See “Remembering Richard Haking: The General Who Saved Churchill’s Life.”\n\nCurt Zoller’s Annotated Bibliography of Works about Sir Winston S. Churchill (M.E. Sharpe, 2004) contains the full publishing history of works through that date. It also offers several additional lists not covered here: books and articles “substantially about” Churchill (e.g., the Alanbrooke Diaries); reviews of Churchill’s own works; dissertations and theses. His book remains available, and is the best source for this data.\n\nNomenclature\n\nFor books with contributions, contributors are identified, although their full titles may be edited for space. The word “Reprints” means only that a work was reprinted, hardbound or softbound. Consult the Zoller Bibliography for complete publishing histories. The word “e-book” indicates either a Kindle or other electronic edition.\n\nAnnotations (✸) and Acknowledgements\n\nAnnotations were written only for books personally examined. Through 2004, all save a handful (bylined) were written by me for Zoller Section A: “Works Entirely about Winston S. Churchill.” From 2005 on, bylines are supplied, most frequently: Antoine Capet (AC), Paul H. Courtenay (PHC), Michael McMenamin (McM), William John Shepherd (WJS). Dave Turrell (DT) and myself (RML). Other bylines are spelled out. Links to reviews are provided for Hillsdale and other publications with which the writers are connected.\n\nThe efforts and assistance of many contributors were profound. I am particularly grateful to Antoine Capet, Dave Turrell, Soren Geiger, and the Hillsdale College Churchill Fellows for kind assistance and corrections. Professor James Muller, University of Alaska, Anchorage, valuably proofread and made numerous corrections. The remaining errors are all mine. —Richard M. Langworth\n\nHow to search this list.\n\nPlease do not attempt to find items by scrolling. Instead, use the search box on your browser. On Macs, click Command-F or Apple-f.

London: Methuen, 1905, 270 pp. Reprints. ✸ The first biography, written by an admirer when Churchill was only 31. Though untainted by knowledge of future greatness, the author wrote favorably about young Winston and predicted that he would eventually become prime minister. Crudely reprinted by photocopy in 2010.\n\n1907\n\nLeech, H.J. Mr. Winston Churchill. Manchester: Abel Heywood, 1907. ✸ Churchill was “deselected” as Member of Parliament for Oldham after he defied its Conservative majority by becoming a Liberal in 1904. Denied the Tory nomination in Oldham for the general election of January 1905, he was invited to stand as a Liberal for North West Manchester, one of nine Manchester seats, with a tiny electorate of 10,000, a third of whom were Jewish. Churchill spoke strongly for Free Trade, popular in Manchester’s mill industries, and was duly elected.\n\n1909\n\nBatchelor, H. Crouch, compiler. Mr. Winston Churchill on the Radical Party: Before He Donned Their Livery and Accepted Their Pay. London: Pall Mall, 1909, 4 pp. softbound. ✸ An attack by a Conservative critic of Churchill’s early career as a Tory before he “crossed the floor” to the Liberals in 1904. Batchelor dwells on Churchill’s earlier critiques of the party he now spoke for.\n\n1910\n\nUnknown. Soldier and Statesman: Complete Life of the Rt. Hon. Winston L. Spencer Churchill. London: The Self-Help Press, 1910, 96 pp., softbound. ✸ A brief pamphlet-biography praising Churchill in five chapters, ending with his advocacy of “The People’s Budget” in 1909. Not a political tract, this was part of a series of booklets designed to encourage personal initiative.\n\n1912\n\n“A Young Scot.” Mr. Winston Churchill’s New Part. Edinburgh: Darien Press, 1912, 16 pp., softbound. ✸ “Mr. Winston Churchill, who advocated Army Reform and economy so eloquently as a Tory in 1900 and 1901…has now come out in all the panoply of a full-blown Jingo.” Churchill had fought for naval economy in 1908-10; as First Lord of the Admiralty beginning October 1911, he viewed the developing German High Seas Fleet with alarm and began advocating more spending, to the disappointment of his Liberal constituency of Dundee.\n\n1916\n\nScott, A. MacCallum. Winston Churchill in Peace and War. London: Newnes, 1916, 162 pp. ✸ An updated version of Scott’s 1905 biography; still full of admiration, it includes details on the Dardanelles campaign. The author argues that Churchill’s plan for forcing the Dardanelles and taking Turkey out of the war in 1915 was the correct strategic vision: that it failed through lack of military celerity on the scene and political support at home.\n\n1919\n\nKing, Joseph. The Political Gambler: Being the Record of Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War. Glasgow: Reformers’ Bookstall, 1919, 8 pp., softbound. ✸ In the kind of political irony for which he was well known, Prime Minister Lloyd George made Churchill war minister in 1919 after World War I had ended. Undeterred, Churchill supported the “gamble” of Allied military operations on behalf of the Whites against the Bolsheviks in Russia, but was eventually forced to bow to Cabinet pressure and to bring the British troops home. On the plus side, Churchill was responsible for the successful demobilization of millions of troops from the Western Front.\n\nSitwell, Osbert. The Winstonburg Line: 3 Satires. London: Bomb Shop, 20 pp., 1919, softbound. ✸ This anti-Churchill polemic publishes verses by Sitwell in the pro-Labour newspapers The Nation and Daily Herald. “A Certain Statesman” attacks Churchill’s actions in Russia, Gallipoli, Antwerp and Sydney Street; “More about Morale” and “The Governess of Europe” add criticism over the Allied military operation in Russia.\n\n1924\n\nCaptain X [Gibb, Andrew Dewar]. With Winston Churchill at the Front. Glasgow: Cowans and Gray Ltd, 112 pp., 1924, softbound. New edition subtitled Winston in the Trenches 1916. Barnsley, Yorks.: Frontline Books, 256 pp. Also e-book. ✸ Reviewed by Hillsdale: Churchill took his command in Flanders, dubiously as an exiled politician, but soon earned his soldiers’ respect. Gibb, who served with him, expounds favorably on the transformation. Gibb’s original was a slender volume. The new edition is an odd but useful amalgamation of Gibb’s 1924 text with extractions or rewrites from Sir Martin Gilbert’s The Challenge of War in the official biography. —WJS\n\n1925\n\nKeynes, John Maynard. The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill. London: Hogarth Press, 32 pp., 1925, softbound. ✸ A powerful and important critique of Churchill’s direction of Britain’s economy as Chancellor of the Exchequer, the post he held from 1924 to 1929. Keynes particularly attacked Churchill’s decision to return Britain to the Gold Standard, although in doing this he was following the prevailing advice of his financial experts.\n\n1927\n\n“Ephesian” [Roberts, C.E. Bechhofer]. Winston Churchill: Being an Account of the Life of the Rt. Hon. Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. London: Mills and Boon, 1927. Reprints. ✸ One of the earliest full biographies, concluding during his service as Chancellor of the Exchequer: a fascinating view of Churchill in mid-career, with some novel predictions. Later editions updated the story, the last (1940) covering Churchill’s fight against the India Act, the gathering threat of Nazi Germany, and his appointment as prime minister.\n\n1928\n\nA Member of the League to Enforce Public Economy. Mr. Churchill’s Budget Pledges and Performances. London: Cobden-Sanderson, 1928, 18 pp., softbound. ✸ A critique of Churchill as Chancellor of the Exchequer, who by now was viewed by some Conservatives to be spending and taxing at unacceptable levels.\n\nMuir, John Ramsay B. Rating Reform: The Right Way and the Wrong Way. An Examination of Mr. Churchill’s Proposals. London: Liberal Publications Department, 1928, 78 pp. ✸ An opposition critique of the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s proposals to reform the fixing of rates or property taxes.\n\nSydenham of Combe, Col. The Lord, et al. ‘The World Crisis’ by Winston Churchill: A Criticism. London: Hutchinson, 192 pp., 1928. Reprints. ✸ A critique of Churchill’s The World Crisis, vol. 3, 1916-1918. Contributors also consider the Dardanelles campaign in Churchill’s vol. 2. An important critical work, sufficiently powerful that Churchill replied to it in part in his 1931 abridged edition of The World Crisis. Contributors: Admiral Sir R. Bacon: “Mr. Churchill and Jutland.” Major-General Sir W.D. Bird: “Mr. Churchill’s Opinions: Some Other Points of View.” Major-General Sir F. Maurice: “Joffre, Galliéni and the Marne.” Sir Charles Oman: “The German Losses on the Somme.” Lord Sydenham of Combe: “Mr. Churchill as Historian.”\n\n1931\n\nGermains, Victor Wallace. The Tragedy of Winston Churchill. London: Hurst and Blackett, 1931. 288 pp. ✸ An early but typical critique for its era concludes that Churchill is clever but not wise, and that ventures as the Dardanelles caused consequences “irreparable, disastrous and appalling.” Very reflective of contemporary attitudes in the early 1930s.\n\n1932\n\nMartin, Hugh. Battle: The Life Story of the Rt. Hon. Winston S. Churchill. London: Sampson, Low and Co., 1932, 246 pp. Reprints. ✸ One of only two biographies to appear during the 1930s, when Churchill was considered politically finished. This work should be read alongside Germains (1931) for a distinct contrast in views over Churchill’s future. Includes Churchill letters.\n\n1934\n\nHay, Malcolm V. Winston Churchill and James II of England. London: Harding and More, 1934, 66 pp. ✸ An attack on Churchill’s portrait of King James II in Volume 1 of Churchill’s biography, Marlborough. Accuses Churchill’s ancestor, the First Duke of Marlborough, of disloyalty to the King, based on earlier arguments by Macaulay.\n\n1939\n\nRose, Franz Karl Anton. Das Ist Churchill [This Is Churchill]. Munich and Berlin: J.F. Lehmanns, 1939, 96 pp., softbound, text in German. ✸ The first of many anti-Churchill propaganda works, this one attacking his ancestors as well as himself (“Der kleine Marlborough”). It is interesting that he was already considered a menace by the Nazis months before he became Prime Minister.\n\n1940\n\nArthur, Sir George. Concerning Winston Spencer Churchill. London: William Heinemann, 1940, 200 pp. ✸ One of the first of many hagiographic songs of praise of Britain’s new war leader, well written, by a soldier who had served in Egypt and the Boer War.\n\nBroad, Lewis. Winston Churchill: Man of War. London: Hutchinson, 1940, 128 pp., softbound. ✸ First appearance of what would become extensive writings by the biographer Lewis Broad, who would develop his story to comprise eventually two thick volumes.\n\nBryce, W.J.. A List of the Printed Works of the Prime Minister. London: W.J. Bryce, Ltd., Booksellers, 1940, 4 pp. ✸ An early bibliography-catalogue which confirms that Marlborough was selling for £7, a Malakand Field Force first edition at 7/6 and The River War at 30/-.\n\nBuchan, William. Winston Churchill. London: Pilot Press, 1940, 96 pp., softbound. ✸ A brief paean to Churchill’s leadership. “Whether or not you agree with the principles by which Winston Churchill has guided his political life, you will, if you consider his work and writings fairly, be bound to admit that he has been a remarkably true and courageous prophet.”\n\nCole, Lloyd. Mr. Churchill and the Church. Sussex, Privately printed, 1940, 32 pp., softbound. ✸ The author draws on Churchill’s speeches for “lessons which I am convinced the Church in some senses needs to learn to-day.” The author’s object is to draw church-folk into support for Britain’s war effort.\n\nDawson, R. MacGregor. Winston Churchill at the Admiralty, 1911-1915. Toronto: Toronto University Press, 1940, 36 pp., softbound. ✸ Offers Churchill as an example in considering the role of a cabinet minister.\n\nDe Stäel-Holstein, Baron Lage Fabian Wilhelm. Mr. Churchill and the Opinion of America. Stockholm: Stockholms Bokindustri, 1940, 168 pp., softbound, text in English. ✸ Stresses the importance of America in the political equation of 1940.\n\nFerrão, Carlos. Churchill: Os Homens a Guerra [Men at War]. Lisbon: Parceria A. M. Pereira, 1940, 62 pp., softbound, text in Portuguese. ✸ Volume II in the collection “Os Homens da Guerra.” Volume I was “Daladier” by Francisco Velloso; volumes promised were “Reynaud” by Artur Portella and “Hitler” by Carlos Ferrão.\n\nHughes, W.M. Winston Churchill: Warrior-Statesman. Sydney, Australia: John Sands, 1940. ✸ Brief hagiography.\n\nKraus, René. Winston Churchill. Philadelphia and New York: J.B. Lippincott, 1940, 366 pp. Many reprints. ✸ A European writer working in the United States, Kraus was highly respected as a biographer of modern figures. Although generally without criticism, his best-seller provides some firsthand views of Churchill and Britain at war. A Japanese edition was published just before Pearl Harbor, an interesting sidelight on Churchill’s standing in what was soon to be an enemy nation.\n\nPersich, Walter. Winston Churchill: Ganz ‘Privat’ [Totally ‘Private’]. Berlin: Otto Schaffer, 1940, 292 pp.; expanded to 336 pp. in 1942, text in German. ✸ The title refers to a series of negative assertions disguised as revelations by the German press. Translations: Czech.\n\nPhelan, James Leo. Churchill Can Unite Ireland. London: Victor Gollancz, 1940, 120 pp. ✸ Argues that the Second World War was Churchill’s opportunity to complete the unification of an Ireland divided by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. WSC himself thought so, cabling Eamon de Valera on 8 December 1941: “Now is your chance. A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish.” There was no response, and the Irish Republic remained neutral.\n\nSchmidt, Wolfgang. Politische Gewalten in England: Das Kabinett Churchill [Political Forces in England: The Churchill Cabinet]. Bonn: Scheur, 1940, 54 pp., text in German. ✸ German propaganda negatively comments on Churchill’s Coalition Cabinet.\n\nSencourt, Robert (pseudonym for Robert E.G. George). Winston Churchill. London: Faber and Faber, 1940, 310 pp. Translations: Hebrew. ✸ An excellent account of Churchill’s life: racy, readable, highly colored. This work includes a chapter on the quality and power of Churchill’s writings.\n\nTreffz, Hermann. Winston Churchill: Das Leben des Generalverbrechers der Weltgeschichte [The Life of the General Criminal in World History]. Fellbach-Stuttgart: W. Baltrusch, 1940, 64 pp.. softbound, text in German. ✸ The Churchill as seen through Nazi eyes reminds one of similar warped visions circulating on the “Twitterverse” 80 years later.\n\nUnknown. Paroles dorées de Mr. Churchill adressées à la Nation Française [Golden Words of Mr. Churchill Addressed to the French Nation]. Paris: Comité d’Éclaircissement sur les Relations Franco-Anglaises, 1940; 10 pp., texts in English and French. Reprints.\n\n“Watchman” [Samuel Vyvyan Trerice Adams]. Churchill: Architect of Victory. London: Hamish Hamilton, 1940, 24 pp., softbound. ✸ An essay based on the chapter “Mr. Winston Churchill” in the author’s book, Right Honourable Gentlemen. Adams was praised by Labour’s Daily Herald as an acute examiner of political personalities, but the Sunday Times wrote: “Certainly fulfills one of the two objects which the author had in writing it—to entertain.”\n\n1941\n\n“Allan Junior.” The Premier’s Clarion Calls to Courage. Dundee and London: Valentine and Sons Ltd., 1941, 16 pp., softbound. ✸ A miniature booklet, 2 1/2 x 4,” containing an introduction, poem and commentary by the unidentified author, combined with quotes from Churchill’s 1940-41 speeches.\n\nBroad, Lewis. Winston Churchill. London: Hutchinson, 364 pp.; “Pocket Library” Series, London: National Book Association, 1941, softbound. Reprints and extended editions through 1956; published in two volumes 1958; republished in one volume, 1970. ✸ A long-running, often-extended biography. Heavily pro-Churchill, Broad nevertheless convened an impressive number of resource documents to construct what ended as a good reference work, but not judgmental.\n\nChaplin, E.D.W. Winston Churchill at Harrow. Harrow: The Harrow Book Shop, 1941, 102 pp.; revised with new introduction, 1941. ✸ An illuminating little book with extensive details and photographs documenting Churchill’s days as a Harrow schoolboy. The later edition adds new material.\n\nDavis, Richard Harding. Young Winston Churchill. New York: Scribners, 1941, 42 pp. ✸ A reprint of the author’s chapter on Churchill as a war correspondent in his Real Soldiers of Fortune (1906). Published to take advantage of Churchill’s World War II fame. Illuminating and useful account by a Boer War contemporary.\n\nFerdi, Katip. Çöçil Diyor Ki [It Declares Churchill]. Ankara: Cankaya Basimevi, 1941, text in Turkish. ✸ The first biography in Turkish.\n\nFletcher, J.W. A Condensed Life of the Right Honourable Winston Spencer Churchill, C.H.: Prime Minister of Great Britain. Sydney: New Century Press, 1941, 92 pp. ✸ Brief and fulsome, “with impressions formed from a study of his Literary Works and from collateral reading.”\n\nGuedalla, Phillip. Mr. Churchill: A Portrait. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1941, 348 pp.; several later editions and translations. ✸ A best-seller in its day, written by a onetime severe critic turned admirer. Lacking in archival documentation but well written, this is a useful example of how Churchill was held by most of his countrymen during his finest hours.\n\nHronek, Jiří. Churchil, život bojovníka [Life Fighter]. London: Nâakladem Czechoslovâaka, 1941, 64 pp., text in Czech.\n\nMacAlpine, Michael. Mr. Churchill’s Socialists: the Evidence and Some Conclusions.

Philadelphia and Toronto, 1941: John C. Winston, 250 pp.; several reprints. ✸ A physically beautiful binding containing an engaging if uncritical wartime biography, written from the American viewpoint. A period piece in appearance and style.\n\nMoir, Phyllis. I Was Winston Churchill’s Private Secretary. New York: Wilfred Funk, 1941, 232 pp. Reprints, several translations. ✸ The American author served Churchill only briefly, on his USA lecture tour in 1931. One of the few staffers not devoted to him, she found WSC rude and oblivious of those around him, but says his wife kept him under control. An important personal account, the first by a member of his secretariat.\n\nNott, Stanley Charles. The Young Churchill. New York, 1941: Coward McCann, 306 pp. ✸ An early attempt to describe his youth relies overmuch on Churchill’s own autobiography, picking up the errors and exaggerations. Still, it has a more comprehensive approach than Davis’s Young Winston Churchill (1941).\n\nPasemann, Ernest, compiler. Churchills Reden und Taten im Scheinwerfer der Presse und Karikatur [Speeches and Acts in the Spotlight of the Press and Caricature]. Leipzig and Berlin: Lühe Verlag, 1941, 104 pp., text in German. ✸ An attack on everything he stood for, with cartoons to illustrate.\n\nPeralta, Carlos.

London: George Allen and Unwin; Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1963, 364 pp. Translations: French. ✸ A critique perhaps overly based on recollections of Churchill’s rueful ex-friend Desmond Morton, who was dropped by WSC and never got over it. Thompson contends that WSC’s American blood gave him energy, his British blood romance, but Kirkus Reviews dissented: “That Churchill is egocentric is not a new charge, but that his was a narcissism so complete that the only person capable of interrupting his self-adoration was his Nanny is a charge repeated and examined at ridiculous length. Churchill is not supposed to have ever felt true friendship, all others in his life existed to be used, etc. The author was evidently fascinated by, rather than admiring of, the man on whom he took notes for years. As a personality portrait, this is sketchy—even naïve—guesswork. As a biography of the public man, it is a denigration.”\n\nWoods, Frederick.

Translations: French, Danish, Dutch, German, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish. ✸ Despite the title, coverage ends in 1960. An important source work by Churchill’s doctor, this work is tainted by the fact that Churchill was almost always ill when Moran saw him. John Colville remarked: “Lord Moran was never present when history was made, but he was sometimes invited to lunch afterward.” Researchers including Sir Martin Gilbert have found that the diary entries in the book do not coincide with the Moran diaries he examined; for some entries the actual diary is blank.
