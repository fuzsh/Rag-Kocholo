        "text": "The Nobel Prize is one of the most well-known awards in the world and brings worldwide recognition to winners and their affiliated institutions. The prize has been administered annually by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm since its creation in 1901. These international awards for achievements are given in the categories of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, the founder of the Nobel Prize. Each prize consists of a medal, a diploma, and a cash award.\n\nTruly, these honorees are some of the most brilliant thinkers and creators whose works vastly improve our understanding of the world and how we interact with it."
