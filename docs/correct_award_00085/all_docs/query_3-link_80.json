sell ‘em to their enemies\n\nI’m tryin’ to feed my soul with thought\n\nGonna sleep off the rest of the day\n\nSometimes no one wants what we got\n\nSometimes you can’t give it away\n\nNow the place is ringed with countless foes\n\nSome of them may be deaf and dumb\n\nNo man, no woman knows\n\nThe hour that sorrow will come\n\nIn the dark I hear the night birds call\n\nI can hear a lover’s breath\n\nI sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall\n\nSleep is like a temporary death\n\nWell, they burned my barn, they stole my horse\n\nI can’t save a dime\n\nI got to be careful, I don’t want to be forced\n\nInto a life of continual crime\n\nOr these:\n\nThey say times are hard, if you don’t believe it\n\nYou can just follow your nose\n\nIt don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere\n\nWe’ll just have to see how it goes\n\nMy old man, he’s like some feudal lord\n\nGot more lives than a cat\n\nNever seen him quarrel with my mother even once\n\nThings come alive or they fall flat\n\nYou can smell the pinewood burnin’\n\nYou can hear the school bell ring\n\nGotta get up near the teacher if you can\n\nIf you wanna learn anything\n\nRomeo, he said to Juliet, “You got a poor complexion\n\nIt doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!”\n\nJuliet said back to Romeo, “Why don’t you just shove off\n\nIf it bothers you so much”\n\nThey all got out of here any way they could\n\nThe cold rain can give you the shivers\n\nThey went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee\n\nAll the rest of them rebel rivers\n\nIf you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again\n\nYou do so at the peril of your own life\n\nI’m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound\n\nI’ve seen enough heartaches and strife\n\nMy grandfather was a duck trapper\n\nHe could do it

ring-dancin’ Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves\n\nI left all my dreams and hopes\n\nBuried under tobacco leaves\n\nIt’s not always easy kicking someone out\n\nGotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task\n\nSometimes somebody wants you to give something up\n\nAnd tears or not, it’s too much to ask\n\nOr these:\n\nIt’s bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying\n\nFame and honor never seem to fade\n\nThe fire’s gone out but the light is never dying\n\nWho says I can’t get heavenly aid?\n\nAin’t talkin’, just walkin’\n\nCarrying a dead man’s shield\n\nHeart burnin’, still yearnin’\n\nWalkin’ with a toothache in my heel\n\nThe suffering is unending\n\nEvery nook and cranny has it’s tears\n\nI’m not playing, I’m not pretending\n\nI’m not nursing any superfluous fears\n\nAin’t talkin’, just walkin’\n\nWalkin’ ever since the other night\n\nHeart burnin’, still yearnin’\n\nWalkin’ ‘til I’m clean out of sight\n\nAs I walked out in the mystic garden\n\nOn a hot summer day, hot summer lawn\n\nExcuse me, ma’am I beg your pardon\n\nThere’s no one here, the gardener is gone\n\nAin’t talkin’, just walkin’\n\nUp the road around the bend\n\nHeart burnin’, still yearnin’\n\nIn the last outback, at the world’s end\n\nOr these:\n\nI’m walking through the summer nights\n\nJukebox playing low\n\nYesterday everything was going too fast\n\nToday, it’s moving too slow\n\nI got no place left to turn\n\nI got nothing left to burn\n\nDon’t know if I saw you, if I would kiss you or kill you\n\nIt probably wouldn’t matter to you anyhow\n\nYou left me standing in the doorway, crying\n\nI got nothing to go back to now\n\nThe light in this place is so bad\n\nMaking me sick in the head\n\nAll the laughter is just making me sad\n\nThe stars have turned cherry red\n\nI’m strumming on my gay guitar\n\nSmoking a cheap cigar\n\nThe ghost of our old love has not gone away\n\nDon’t look like it will anytime soon\n\nYou left me standing in the doorway crying\n\nUnder the midnight moon\n\nMaybe they’ll get me and maybe they won’t\n\nBut not tonight and it won’t be here\n\nThere are things I could say but I don’t\n\nI know the mercy of God must be near\n\nI’ve been riding the midnight train\n\nGot ice water in my veins\n\nI would be crazy if I took you back\n\nIt would go up against every rule\n\nYou left me standing in the doorway, crying\n\nSuffering like a fool\n\nWhen the last rays of daylight go down\n\nBuddy, you’ll roll no more\n\nI can hear the church bells ringing in the yard\n\nI wonder who they’re ringing for\n\nI know I can’t win\n\nBut my heart just won’t give in\n\nLast night I danced with a stranger\n\nBut she just reminded me you were the one\n\nYou left me standing in the doorway crying\n\nIn the dark land of the sun\n\nI’ll eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry\n\nAnd live my life on the square\n\nAnd even if the flesh falls off of my face\n\nI know someone will be there to care\n\nIt always means so much\n\nEven the softest touch\n\nI see nothing to be gained by any explanation\n\nThere are no words that need to be said\n\nYou left me standing in the doorway crying\n\nBlues wrapped around my head\n\nOr these:\n\nThe walls of pride are high and wide\n\nCan’t see over to the other side\n\nIt’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay\n\nIt’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away\n\nOne look at you and I’m out of control\n\nLike the universe has swallowed me whole\n\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\n\nThere’s too many people, too many to recall\n\nI thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all\n\nWell, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud\n\nUp over my head nothing but clouds of blood\n\nOr these:\n\nThe air is getting hotter\n\nThere’s a rumbling in the skies\n\nI’ve been wading through the high muddy water\n\nWith the heat rising in my eyes\n\nEvery day your memory grows dimmer\n\nIt doesn’t haunt me like it did before\n\nI’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere\n\nTrying to get to heaven before they close the door\n\nWhen I was in Missouri\n\nThey would not let me be\n\nI had to leave there in a hurry\n\nI only saw what they let me see\n\nYou broke a heart that loved you\n\nNow you can seal up the book and not write anymore\n\nI’ve been walking that lonesome valley\n\nTrying to get to heaven before they close the door\n\nPeople on the platforms\n\nWaiting for the trains\n\nI can hear their hearts a-beatin’\n\nLike pendulums swinging on chains\n\nI tried to give you everything\n\nThat your heart was longing for\n\nI’m just going down the road feeling bad\n\nTrying to get to heaven before they close the door\n\nI’m going down the river\n\nDown to New Orleans\n\nThey tell me everything is gonna be all right\n\nBut I don’t know what “all right” even means\n\nI was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane\n\nMiss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore\n\nI been all around the world, boys\n\nNow I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door\n\nGonna sleep down in the parlor\n\nAnd relive my dreams\n\nI’ll close my eyes and I wonder\n\nIf everything is as hollow as it seems\n\nSome trains don’t pull no gamblers\n\nNo midnight ramblers like they did before\n\nI been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down\n\nNow I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door\n\nIf they aren’t, then I’m afraid being a poet sucks. I wish he’d win the Nobel once and for all, just to put an end to all the nonsense that’s been circulating about him being a poet or not. He’s a poet in every sense of the word, a great one as well.\n\nTo me Dylan is nothing if not Literary. A river of ideals and ideas, thought provoking questions and razor sharp commentary on the injustices of the world where the powerful tend to trample the “weak” and “insignificant.” Dylan’s work illuminates these discrepancies between the haves and the have nots, between the victims and the victimizers always coming down on the side of social justice.\n\nDylan may not be a poet- and has said so himself many times. (then again he has said he is a poet many times as well- but not in decades) I was just reading an interview with him where he says songwriting isn’t anything- anyone can do it- and of course this is a contradiction to other comments he has made. In any case, if anyone can write a song, no one that I can think of has produce a body of work that has shifted the whole trajectory of a genre- (folk/rock/pop music) or had such a profound affect and so many people of his generation as well as the generations following. Go to a Dylan show and there are 12 year olds and 75 year olds. By taking big ideas and literary content and combining them with music he made those ideas accessible, understandable as well as inspirational to millions of people who might not ever been exposed to them. His work opened minds, brought literary, philosophical, spiritual and the idea of justice for all to “pop” music and wound up shifting culture.\n\nI’ve been looking for the criterion which the committees use in awarding prizes but haven’t found it yet.\n\nFrom Nobel’s will:\n\n“…one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction …”\n\nI found this:\n\n“Nobel’s choice of emphasis on “idealistic” or “ideal” (English translation) in his criteria for the Nobel Prize in Literature has led to recurrent controversy. In the original Swedish, the word idealisk translates as either “idealistic” or “ideal”.[ In the early twentieth century, the Nobel Committee interpreted the intent of the will strictly. For this reason, they did not award certain world-renowned authors of the time such as James Joyce, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, Marcel Proust, Henrik Ibsen, and Henry James.\n\n“More recently, the wording has been more liberally interpreted. Thus, the Prize is now awarded both for lasting literary merit and for evidence of consistent idealism on some significant level. In recent years, this means a kind of idealism championing human rights on a broad scale. Hence the award is now arguably more political.”\n\nWell- to my mind Dylan’s work has lasting literary merit (including his use of the discipline of literary allusion) to a significant level. Consider the University studies courses and degrees awarded to students writing about his work. I imagine this will only increase as time goes on. His work has championed human rights- and still does. His lyrics may be less explicit, more shaded, nuanced and even esoteric than his earliest work they are just as full of meaning, beauty and ideas, they just take more unpacking.\n\nThe berst part of Dylan’s work, for me, is that it is not about what he meant, it is about what meaning we find over the course of time. Like all good literature, including poetry (and scriptures for that matter) the word is living. Meanings change as we change, we are worked on by the words, we learn, look within, grow change and come back to the literature and find it has also changed. There are new layers and textures. And then the cycle repeats. Bob Dylan’s literary gifts have vastly contributed to culture and the world- and perhaps more importantly to individuals. He continues to do so for which I am grateful.\n\nDoes he deserve the Nobel Prize? To my mind, yes. Does he care? Who knows- but given his beautiful response to winning an Academy Award I think he would be touched and grateful.\n\nWill he win it?\n\nI’m not going to even try to predict the outcome. I like being surprised.\n\nSorry for the length of this- I should have posted on my own blog."
