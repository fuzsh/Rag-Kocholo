Below is a listing of College of Medicine institutional scholarships awarded by the College of Medicine Scholarship Committee.\n\nGeorge Link Ackerman Scholarship\n\nAn anonymous donor established a scholarship in 1997 to honor Dr. George Ackerman. Dr. Richard P. Wheeler, Executive Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, College of Medicine, shared the following comments about his mentor and friend: “Dr. George Link Ackerman is a 1954 graduate of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences College of Medicine. He did his internship at the Philadelphia General Hospital and completed his residency in medicine and took further training in Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases at UAMS. He joined the faculty in 1961 and quickly rose through the academic ranks, caring for patients, teaching and publishing. He has received the ‘Golden Apple Award’ from students as the outstanding clinical teacher. He has also received the Distinguished Faculty Award from the Medical Alumni Association, the Outstanding Faculty Award from the Medicine Interns and Residents, and the Abernathy Award for Excellence in Internal Medicine from the Arkansas Chapter of the American College of Physicians. He has even had the UAMS yearbook, the Caduceus, dedicated to him. His ability to teach and inspire young physicians is legendary. His secret is his passion for life and learning.” Upon learning that a scholarship had been anonymously given to honor Dr. Ackerman, he requested that the name of the scholarship be the Dr. George Link Ackerman Scholarship. According to Ackerman, “George S. Link was a successful small businessman in West Texas in the first half of the century. He married my father’s cousin who had been reared in my grandparent’s home and was more a foster sister to my father than a cousin. My father and Mr. Link became close friends and I was named for him. Their son, George S. Link, Jr., was a handsome, charming fellow, a Naval Aviator in World War II during my teenage years, and a boyhood idol of mine. He financed my medical education so it pleases me to include the Link name in the formal description of this scholarship.” When reflecting on the criteria for the scholarship recipient, Dr. Ackerman stated, “I have always been an avid reader and literature is perhaps my chief avocation.” Therefore, he would prefer the recipient be a student who has demonstrated a keen interest in literature and/or scholarly approach to his or her studies. The inaugural award was presented in 1997.\n\nArcher, Chacko and Uwaydat Scholarship\n\nThrough the generosity of UAMS supporters, an endowed scholarship has been created honoring three UAMS doctors: Robert L. “Lee” Archer, M.D., Joseph G. Chacko, M.D., and Sami H. Uwaydat, M.D. This philanthropic investment will fund the Drs. Lee Archer, Joseph Chacko, and Sami Uwaydat Endowed Scholarship. The scholarship is to be awarded to one or more third- and fourth-year College of Medicine students with a demonstrated financial need.\n\nThe donors, who choose to provide this support anonymously, were inspired to create the scholarship fund to advance the critical need of health care in Arkansas and expressed hope their gift would inspire others to make similar gifts in support of education. They offered to match dollar for dollar the first $5,000 contributed by additional donors to this scholarship in 2020.\n\n“Our mission to generate the very best physicians for Arkansas starts with recruiting top Arkansas students to UAMS,” said Executive Vice Chancellor and College of Medicine Dean Christopher T. Westfall, M.D. “Scholarships are a crucial tool in this effort, so we are always grateful for those who initiate and contribute to scholarships.”\n\n“The donors of this new scholarship have shown that they aren’t just generous, but also forward-thinking,” Westfall said. “By encouraging others to contribute, the endowment will grow more quickly and potentially be able to support more promising and deserving medical students.”\n\n“This scholarship is also special in honoring three truly world-class faculty physicians,” he added. “I am not at all surprised that the donors were inspired by Dr. Archer, Dr. Chacko and Dr. Uwaydat.”\n\nArcher is chairman of the College of Medicine Department of Neurology. For more than 30 years at UAMS, Archer has provided world-class care for Arkansans with Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, stroke and movement disorders while teaching and mentoring future neurologists. He is a neurologist and professor in the College of Medicine and holds the Major and Ruth Nodini Chair in Neurology. He is past president of the Arkansas Medical Society, the largest professional society for physicians in the state. College of Medicine seniors have awarded Archer three Gold Sash and numerous Red Sash awards for his teaching, and he has received numerous awards from the college.\n\nChacko has been the director of neuro-ophthalmology at the Harvey & Bernice Jones Eye Institute since 2005. He has 25 years of experience in performing cataract surgery. Chacko is a professor for the Departments of Ophthalmology, Neurology and Neurosurgery in the UAMS College of Medicine. He is the medical student clerkship director in ophthalmology. In addition, he has served the underprivileged in Ghana and Guatemala through yearly surgical mission trips for over 20 years.\n\nUwaydat is an ophthalmologist with the UAMS Harvey & Bernice Jones Eye Institute and an associate professor and former interim chair in the Department of Ophthalmology in the College of Medicine. Uwaydat is director of vitreoretinal service, medical director of the Leland and Betty Tollett Retinal and Ocular Genetics Clinic, and director of the Ocular Electrophysiology Lab. His research focuses on age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and treatment of traumatic eye injuries.\n\nBetsy Ledbetter Askew Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship was established in 2008 with a very generous bequest from Dr. Askew, who graduated from the College of Medicine in 1950. After practicing anesthesiology in Shreveport, Louisiana for many years, she retired to her hometown of Jonesboro, Arkansas where both of her brothers practiced medicine. It was her fervent wish to help medical students and she requested that preference be given to a female student or students at the direction of the Scholarship Committee. The inaugural awards were presented in 2010.\n\nAtiq Family Scholarship\n\nIn 2020, it was the expressed desire of Dr. and Mrs. Omar Atiq to pledge a gift to the University of Arkansas Foundation for the benefit of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to establish the Atiq Family Scholarship. The scholarship shall be awarded each year to a UAMS student who is enrolled in the College of Medicine, is from Pine Bluff, Jefferson County, or the southeast region of Arkansas, in that order of preference. However, if a student from Pine Bluff, Jefferson County or the southeast region of Arkansas cannot be identified, the scholarship will be awarded to another qualified student. Selection of the recipient shall be made by the College of Medicine Scholarship Committee. The scholarship is for one academic year. Prior recipients may be considered for this scholarship during subsequent years. Should a recipient become ineligible, a new recipient may be named using the same criteria. The inaugural Atiq Family Scholarship was awarded in 2021.\n\nDavid Littleton Baker, Sr., Scholarship\n\nThe establishment of the David Littleton Baker, Sr. Scholarship for students in the College of Medicine fund is to provide a scholarship to a deserving student in the College of Medicine in loving memory of David Littleton Baker, Sr. by his family David and Nina Baker (donors), John and Karen Baker, James and Hollie Baker, and Mark and Julie Ferguson. The funds have come from philanthropic motivations of the family. The student who receives this scholarship will be enrolled in good standing in the College of Medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The student is selected by the Scholarship Committee within the College of Medicine. The inaugural award was presented in 2012-13.\n\nEddie Ball Memorial Scholarship\n\nThe friends and family of E.B. Ball of Eudora, Arkansas, founded a scholarship in memory of Eddie Ball, who was killed in an automobile accident in 1984 during his sophomore year of medical school. The scholarship is awarded annually to a member of the sophomore class who excelled academically during his or her freshman year of medical school and who demonstrates a willingness to serve others. The student must exemplify “diligence in the pursuit of becoming a humane and compassionate physician” in keeping with the wishes of the Ball family. The inaugural award was presented in 1985.\n\nBarton Foundation Scholarship\n\nThe income from an endowment given to the College of Medicine in 1964 by Mrs. T.H. Barton of El Dorado is used to recognize students based on their previous year’s academic performance. Barton Scholarships are given each year to rising sophomores, juniors and seniors who completed the prior year of medical school ranked at the top of their class. The Barton Foundation Scholarships are among the oldest and most prestigious awards offered by the College of Medicine. Since its creation in 1964, more than 1,300 students have received a total of 2.5 million dollars in Barton Foundation Scholarships.\n\nColonel Thomas H. Barton, a pioneer oilman and philanthropist, launched his small Lion Oil Company that included exploration, production, marketing, distribution, refining, and research programs. Barton was born in Marlin, Texas, on September 20, 1881. His father, Thomas Killebrew Barton, was a merchant and farmer in Falls County. At age sixteen, he entered Texas A&M College, but limited funds forced him to leave school early in his second year. He entered the U.S. Army in 1901 and was discharged in 1904 with the rank of corporal. From 1905 to 1917, he worked in a variety of occupations that included banking and lumber in Dallas County. In 1906, he was commissioned with the temporary rank of captain in the Arkansas National Guard. With the advent of World War I, he was transferred to the 141st Infantry, Thirty-sixth Division, as a captain in the regular army. Although his unit was shipped to France, he was sent to Camp Stanley, Texas, to assist in organizing and training cavalry regiments. He was discharged in 1919 with the rank of major. Barton remained in the Army Reserve from 1920 until discharged as a colonel in 1936.\n\nBarton arrived in El Dorado in January 1921, only days after oil was discovered. He quickly organized the El Dorado Natural Gas Company and expanded into the Natural Gas and Fuel Corporation in 1924. He served as its president until 1929, when he sold it to the Cities Service Company. During this time, he became the principal stockholder in the struggling Lion Oil Refining Company. On July 13, 1925, Barton married Madeline Mary Latimer; their plans to travel were curtailed in 1929, when he agreed to serve as Lion Oil’s president. Within three months, Lion had purchased producing leases in the Smackover (Union County) oil field that was literally overflowing with a colossal output of petroleum. The company continued to expand and, in 1935, discovered the third major producing geological zone in the Smackover field.\n\nBarton’s interest in livestock began as a youngster on the family farm. He worked closely with the Arkansas Livestock Show Association, established the Arkansas State Fair and, through his financial support, the T. H. Barton Coliseum in Little Rock was dedicated on September 29, 1952. Lion merged with Monsanto Chemical Corporation in 1955, and Barton served on Monsanto’s Board of Directors until his retirement in 1959.\n\nAs a humanitarian, Barton contributed considerable time and financial resources that include a medical and research wing at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Warner-Brown Hospital in El Dorado, Union County’s Barton Library, Union County Memorial Stadium, support for 4-H Clubs and the Boys Clubs statewide, and numerous student scholarships including the Barton Foundation Scholarships for outstanding medical students attending the University of Arkansas College of Medicine.\n\nBlackwell-Barnes Scholarship\n\nIn 1984, Dr. Banks Blackwell, an orthopaedic surgeon from Pine Bluff, established a scholarship for deserving students based on academic promise and in hopes scholarship recipients will remain in Arkansas to practice medicine. Dr. Lowry Barnes, the Chair of the UAMS Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, was the inaugural recipient of the Banks Blackwell, M.D., Scholarship in 1984 and 1985. Dr. Barnes has graciously decided to continue to honor the legacy of Dr. Blackwell by providing funds to the Blackwell-Barnes Scholarship fund. Preference is given to students from southeast Arkansas who hopefully will return to southeast Arkansas to practice medicine. In addition, although not binding, it is hoped students will pursue the specialty of orthopaedic surgery.\n\nRobert and Dorothy Bowling Scholarship\n\nRobert E. Bowling, Ph.D., established a scholarship fund in 1991 to honor the memory of his wife, Dorothy, and to celebrate his retirement after 34 years as a member of the faculty of the College of Medicine, which included 17 years as Associate Dean for Admissions. Dr. Bowling passed away in 2000. The Bowling Scholarship is awarded annually to a rising sophomore who demonstrates academic promise, a desire to serve others, and has financial need. The inaugural award was presented in 1992.\n\nHarold Braswell Challenge Scholarship\n\nDr. Harold Braswell graduated from the College of Medicine in 1955. He attended his 35-year reunion in 1990 and enjoyed his alumni weekend so much that he designated the Arkansas Caduceus Club, the College of Medicine alumni organization, as beneficiary of a new insurance policy. Upon his death in 1992, part of his gift was used to endow a scholarship for medical students. The scholarship is awarded annually to a student on the basis of academics, character and financial need. The inaugural scholarship was presented in 1995.\n\nHettye Sue and Mike Bridger, M.D., Distinguished Endowed Scholarship\n\nW. Mike Bridger, M.D., Class of 1967, received a Barton Scholarship during his time at the UAMS College of Medicine and established this scholarship in appreciation of the financial assistance he received. Dr. Bridger believed he received an excellent education at UAMS which enabled him to go anywhere to practice medicine. The award is made at the discretion of the College of Medicine Scholarship Committee. The inaugural award was presented in 2011.\n\nAristo Brizzolara, Sr., Scholarship Fund\n\nIn August 1980, Charles M. Brizzolara, M.D., sent a letter to then Associate Dean for Finance, Mr. George Warner, wishing to establish a scholarship fund in memory of his uncle Aristo Brizzolara, Sr. It was the desire of Dr. Brizzolara, Class of 1936, who attended medical school during the Great Depression, to provide financial aid to medical students who were in need of assistance. Dr. Brizzolara lived with his uncle during medical school. Aristo Brizzolara was born in Milan, Italy. He immigrated to the United States and became a respected businessman in Little Rock, dealing primarily in real estate. He is the progenitor of the distinguished Little Rock family, which includes a nephew, grandson and great-grandson who became physicians. Over the years, hundreds of medical students have been assisted by the Brizzolara Fund. Initially, the intent was to establish a scholarship fund and monies received were awarded as scholarships on an annual basis until 1990. However, the trust agreement document subsequently received referred to the fund as a “loan” rather than a “scholarship.” Brizzolara funds were disbursed to medical students as loans until 2005. In 2005, Mr. John Coffin, Director of UAMS Institutional Development, conversed with A.J. Brizzolara, M.D., who approved converting the fund back to a scholarship. As loans have been repaid and sufficient interest has accrued, the College of Medicine resumed awarding scholarships to medical students beginning with the 2014 academic year.\n\nThe Brooks Brothers, M.D., Scholarship\n\nIn consideration of his abiding interest in the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Robert A. Brooks, M.D., pledged a gift to the University of Arkansas Foundation in 2020 to establish an endowed scholarship for students of the UAMS College of Medicine. The scholarship was given in loving memory of his brother, Walter Allen Brooks, M.D., a 1946 graduate of the UAMS College of Medicine.\n\nWalter was born on March 29, 1924 in Russellville, Arkansas, Pope County. The son of a farmer, his family prized education. He graduated from Russellville High as valedictorian at age 17. World War II was on, but Walter was deferred to attend college at Arkansas Tech. Through a specialized Army training program, he did his medical training in three years, graduating in 1946 from the University of Arkansas medical school. The following year another important event occurred with his marriage to Marilyn Rose Gulley of Quanah, Texas on July 12, 1947. Walter then served in the Army and was stationed in Arabia. After returning to civilian life, Walter did a residency in surgery and then opened a practice in Marilyn’s hometown of Quanah in 1955. Walter was very active in both the medical and civic communities and was a well-known presence in both Quanah and the Texas Medical Association. Walter Allen Brooks died peacefully on April 20, 1997 in Quanah. He is buried there with his wife, Marilyn, who passed in 2011.\n\nThe scholarship is named The Brooks Brothers, M.D., Scholarship. The UAMS College of Medicine Scholarship Committee will have complete discretion of selecting a deserving medical student to honor the Brooks brothers and family. The inaugural award was presented in 2024.\n\nDr. King David Brown Scholarship\n\nDr. King David Brown left a substantial part of his estate to be used to provide scholarships for college students at three of the schools he attended: Meharry Medical College, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, and the College of Medicine at UAMS. Dr. Brown, whose own background necessitated financial assistance to medical school, established this scholarship for a student, preferably from his hometown of Magnolia, with a demonstrated need for financial assistance. The inaugural award was presented in 1998.\n\nRita and Robert Homer Bryant Memorial Scholarship\n\nMrs. Frances Bryant Edens of Corsicana, Texas, established a memorial fund in memory of her parents, Rita and Robert Homer Bryant. Robert, a 1915 College of Medicine graduate, joined the Army during World War I and was stationed in France. His surgical team operated much like a MASH unit. Dr. Bryant was impressed by the successful treatment of physical wounds but distressed by the lack of understanding of mental illness. Thereafter, Dr. Bryant and his wife made psychiatry their life work. Dr. Bryant retired from the Little Rock Medical Division of the Veterans Affairs Regional Office in 1958. The scholarship is awarded annually to an entering first-year student on the basis of remarkable achievement both inside and outside the classroom. The inaugural award was presented in 1988 at the first scholarship banquet hosted by the College of Medicine.\n\nBuchanan Key Scholarship\n\nThe Buchanan Key is among the oldest and most prestigious awards presented by the College of Medicine. According to Anna Buchanan, the late Dr. A. S. Buchanan (known in the family as Dr. Al), Class of 1905, established the Buchanan Keys in 1939 in memory of his brother, Dr. Gilbert Buchanan. One student is selected annually from each class, based on the vote of his/her classmates. After Dr. Buchanan’s death in 1953, the award was continued by his daughters, Mrs. Carl Dalrymple and Miss Katherine Buchanan, in honor of their father who practiced nearly 50 years in Prescott, Arkansas. The award consists of an engraved Buchanan Key. Beginning in 1999, the College of Medicine Founders Society voted to provide a $1,000.00 scholarship for each Buchanan Key recipient. In recent years, the Key was replaced with a commemorative plaque. The College of Medicine regards the award as a significant accomplishment because the winners are chosen not only on the basis of superior academic achievement but also by the vote of their classmates.\n\nFred T. Caldwell, Jr., M.D., Scholarship\n\nFred T. Caldwell, Jr., M.D., passed away on April 26, 2004. Born in Hot Springs on May 12, 1925 and raised primarily in Ashdown as the middle of three children, Fred was the son of Fred T. Caldwell, Sr. and Margaret Rodgers Caldwell. Most of his elementary and all his secondary education were received in Ashdown. In 1943 he enrolled at Ouachita Baptist University then transferred to Baylor University, where he received a B.S. In 1946 Fred entered Washington University School of Medicine, graduating in 1950 with an M.D. degree and membership in Alpha Omega Alpha. After interning in Pathology at the prestigious Barnes Hospital of St. Louis, he entered the Department of Surgery training program. After two years of training, he was inducted into the service. He spent two years in the army, most of that time in Korea. After his release from the army, Dr. Caldwell resumed his surgery training, completing his residency in 1958 under the leadership of Dr. Carl Moyer., adding one extra year of laboratory work to his training. His first professional position was at the Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse, New York. After a decade in Syracuse, the Caldwell family (now including twins, Paul and Elizabeth) moved to Arkansas, where Fred spent the remainder of his professional life as Professor of Surgery at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. There he conducted research on the healing of burn wounds and served as Director of the Burn Center at Arkansas Children’s Hospital. His many publications and verbal presentations made a major contribution to understanding the role of evaporative heat loss in the healing of burn wounds, and he was honored by election to the presidency of the American Burn Association. He also served for several years on the National Advisory Board for the Shriners’ Hospitals. Although Dr. Caldwell performed all varieties of general surgery, his main specialties were renal transplants, as part of the Transplant Team with Dr. William J. (Pat) Flanigan and the treatment of burns. The greatest delight in his professional work came from the training he provided the residents in General Surgery at UAMS. Under the leadership of the Chair of the Department, Dr. Gilbert S. Campbell, Fred’s colleague and friend, outstanding young people had been recruited for the Arkansas Department of Surgery training program. Fred Caldwell was a vital part of that training for 32 years, and his skill as surgeon and teacher will be long remembered and appreciated by scores of talented physicians and other health care personnel now working in Arkansas. In terms of recreation, Fred was a one-sport man–fly fishing. Over the years he fished in most of the world’s exciting waters, releasing most of the fish he caught. His favorite locale was Alaska, and he went fishing there almost every year for 20 years. His last recreational trip was to Costa Rica, where he caught a 120-pound tarpon. Although it is not actually a sport, birding meant almost as much to Fred. He spent many hours happily feeding birds and conducting a futile war against the squirrels that got most of the feed he put out for them. Fred Caldwell’s life cannot be summarized without reference to his enduring marriage to his wife, Bettye, and their family life together. Teenage sweethearts, they made it through all the trials of a two-career marriage and became ever closer over the years. During the last five or so years, Fred and Bettye traveled extensively to many exciting parts of the world. They were ready to embark on a long trip up the Amazon River when congestive heart failure with pulmonary complications forced him to put away his suitcase.\n\nDr. Caldwell’s wife, Bettye, established an endowed scholarship in loving memory of her husband, Fred T. Caldwell, Jr., M.D., who served a long and distinguished career at UAMS as a Professor of Surgery and as Director of the Burn Center at Arkansas Children’s Hospital. Dr. Fred Caldwell’s skill as a surgeon and teacher contributed greatly to care and healing of patients and to the recruitment and training of outstanding residents for the UAMS Department of Surgery. UAMS is very grateful for this Gift and for the many outstanding professional contributions of Dr. Caldwell. The inaugural Caldwell Scholarship was awarded in 2017.\n\nDr. J. Brad Carter Family Scholarship\n\nIt is the expressed desire of Dr. J. Brad Carter and Mrs. Melanie Carter to pledge a gift to the University of Arkansas Foundation, Inc. for the benefit of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Dr. Carter is from a small, rural area of Arkansas and faced significant challenges when pursuing his degree in medicine. Understanding these unique circumstances, Dr. Carter has established a scholarship that will help current and future students from small and rural areas in Arkansas pursue their education with the UAMS College of Medicine. This scholarship shall be awarded each year to a UAMS student who is a first-year student enrolled in College of Medicine and preferably is from a town with a population of 10,000 or less. Selection of the recipient shall be made by the College of Medicine Scholarship Committee, designee of the Dean and/or Provost. Each scholarship is for one academic year. Prior recipients may not be considered for this scholarship during subsequent years. The inaugural award was presented in the 2022-23 academic year.\n\nCalvin R. Cassady, M.D., and Margaret S. Cassady Scholarship in Medicine\n\nIt was the expressed desire of Joe R. Robbins, M.D. and Nancy Cassady Robbins, husband and wife, of Texarkana, Texas to give a charitable donation to the University of Arkansas Foundation for the purpose of establishing an endowed scholarship to be named the Calvin R. Cassady, M.D. and Margaret S. Cassady Scholarship in Medicine. Joe R. Robbins, M.D. was a 1984 UAMS College of Medicine graduate and former resident and fellow at UAMS. The scholarship is to benefit medical students in financial need enrolled in the College of Medicine. Preference is to be given to students who were born in, raised in, or who otherwise are from any of the following counties in Arkansas (in order of preference) Pike, Howard, Sebastian, Crawford or any other Arkansas county. The scholarship criteria reflects the donors’ intention to honor the lives of Calvin R. Cassady, M.D. and Margaret S. Cassady, parents of Nancy Cassady Robbins and in-laws of Joe R. Robbins. Dr. Cassady was born in Nashville, Arkansas and raised in nearby Murfreesboro where he met his childhood sweetheart, Margaret Shirley Terrell. Margaret graduated from Henderson State Teacher’s College in Arkadelphia Arkansas where she majored in home economics. Together they focused on Dr. Cassady’s new life as a medical student and resident at UAMS. They later became devoted parents, raising their children in Van Buren, Arkansas, where Dr. Cassady practiced as a successful and highly respected radiologist.\n\nFlorence Char Medical Student Distinguished Scholarship\n\nDr. James Graham, M.D., Executive Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences College of Medicine recalls the following: “Dr. Char was on faculty when I was a student and resident. She was a brilliant person who initially trained in pediatric cardiology, but then did training in genetics. For many years, she was the only trained clinical geneticist in the state. She established the first clinical genetics clinic in Arkansas and the first cytogenetics laboratory. She was quite amazing; a kind and exceptional individual!” Archived records show that Dr. Char served on the College of Medicine Admissions Committee in 1980, 1981 and 1982.\n\nIn January 1999 the College of Medicine received a check for benefits payable on the life of Dr. Florence Char for $100,000.00 plus $556 of interest. I. Dodd Wilson, Dean of the College of Medicine at that time, directed the funds be placed in the UAMS Foundation to establish The Florence Char Medical Student Education Fund. Dr. Wilson instructed that Dr. Char be included as a member of the Founders Society.\n\nThe Florence Char Medical Student Distinguished Scholarship is awarded to deserving medical students at the discretion of the College of Medicine Scholarship Committee. The inaugural awards were presented in 2024.\n\nClass of 1937 Alumni Scholarship\n\nThe Class of 1937, a product of the Great Depression, remembered the adversity of its medical-school years and recognized a continuing need to assist students with the costs of a medical education. Fourteen of the original 62 members of the Class of 1937 attended their 50-year Alumni Reunion in 1987 and decided to fund the first scholarship ever presented by an alumni class to the College of Medicine. Dr. J.A. Henry, who was instrumental in establishing the annual scholarship stated: “The chief reason for establishing the scholarship was in recognition of the School of Medicine which has provided for us the opportunity to become doctors. The remembrance of the austerity which characterized and tempered our medical school days no doubt influenced this scholarship. We only hope that any future recipient of this scholarship will feel gratitude and pride in his/her medical school alma mater which has prompted the creation of the Class of 1937 Scholarship.” The scholarship is awarded to an entering first-year student on the basis of outstanding academic achievement and need. This scholarship, along with the Class of 1981 Alumni Scholarship, is recognized as the genesis of the successful alumni scholarship effort spearheaded by Mrs. Janet Honeycutt, past Executive Director of the Arkansas Caduceus Club, and Dr. I. Dodd Wilson, former Dean of the College of Medicine and UAMS Chancellor. The inaugural award was presented in 1989.\n\nClass of 1942 Alumni Scholarship\n\nMembers of the Class of 1942 returned to Little Rock in 1992 to celebrate the golden anniversary of their graduation from medical school. During this time, they also decided to fund an endowed scholarship for the College of Medicine, and they accomplished their goal in only two years. The inaugural award was presented in 1994 to Chris Gibert. The Class of 1942 Scholarship is given annually to an upperclassman who has demonstrated superior academic achievement throughout medical school.\n\nClass of 1945 Alumni Scholarship\n\nThe Class of 1945 determined at its 45-year reunion in 1990 to establish a scholarship by the time of its 50-year reunion. Class agents campaigned for contributions from their classmates. The class presented its endowment to the College of Medicine during its golden anniversary celebration in 1999. The scholarship is awarded each year to a medical student on the basis of financial need and academic excellence. The inaugural award was presented in 1995.\n\nClass of 1946 Alumni Scholarship\n\nThe Class of 1946 decided in 1991 to fund a scholarship and, like the Class of 1945, present it to the College of Medicine on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of their graduation. The class presented the scholarship to the College of Medicine in June 1996. The scholarship is awarded to a student on the basis of outstanding academic achievement. The Class of 1946 reserved the right to amend the selection criteria in the future. The inaugural was presented in 1996.\n\nClass of 1947 Alumni Scholarship\n\nIn the midst of World War II, the accelerated class matriculated about 60 students in 1944 (Class of 1947) – the smallest medical school class since the depths of the Depression. Many of the members of the class were actually in the military (Army Specialized Training Program or Navy V-12 Program) while medical students, and school was held year-round so they graduated in a little over three years. Most were discharged after the end of the war while they were still in medical school, and were not called to active duty during World War II. However, many members of the Class of 1947 served during the Korean conflict.

Chester’s love of the outdoors was equaled only by his affection for the University of Arkansas and his love of medicine. As an anesthesiologist in the class of 1955, he was exemplary in his care for patients. Their well being always came first. The respect he had for his profession also found expression in the fondness he felt for his medical school class.

However, the class members accumulated sufficient funds by 1999 and did not want to delay another two years when students had need now. Therefore, the inaugural presentation was made in 1999, two years prior to their Silver Anniversary celebration, at the College of Medicine Scholarship Banquet held in the Grand Ballroom of the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock on September 17, 1999.

Dick, M.D., and Joseph Kennedy “Ken” Dick, MBA.\n\nThe purpose of this commitment is to establish the Dr. Rhonda and Ken Dick Endowed Scholarship and this was made through their revocable trust.\n\nAt the time the scholarship was presented to the College of Medicine in 2022, Susan S. Smyth, M.D., Ph.D., former UAMS executive vice chancellor and College of Medicine dean said “We are profoundly grateful to Dr. Rhonda and Ken Dick for their generosity and dedication to young Arkansans, especially those from rural areas, who aspire to become physicians and continue their legacy of service in our state. Scholarships are a powerful tool for recruiting promising students to UAMS and to careers in rural medicine, and this endowment will have a tremendous impact for generations to come.”\n\nThis scholarship will be awarded to a student enrolled at the College of Medicine who is an Arkansas resident who demonstrates financial need.\n\nThe Dicks have created the scholarship to honor the memory of Dr. Herd Stone to show appreciation for his mentorship and care for the individuals of Monroe County.\n\n“After working for Dr. Stone for about six months, he called me into his office to discuss my career plans. He encouraged me to go to medical school. It was something I had never considered,” said Rhonda. “I had not been exposed to many potential career opportunities in our small, isolated rural community and there weren’t many women practicing medicine at that time. So it had never occurred to me as a possibility.”\n\nWhile she attended Hendrix College and later UAMS, Stone continued his mentorship with her.\n\n“Dr. Stone taught me some valuable lessons that I carried with me through medical school later in my medical practice,” said Dick. “He often took me on house calls in the evenings to some of the most rural parts of Monroe County to provide medical care to disadvantaged people who were unable to make the trip to his clinic. Although I didn’t realize this until many years later, he did this for a reason. He wanted me to understand the challenges that many of my future patients might be facing. Those lessons served me well throughout my career.”\n\nThe couple hopes this scholarship will inspire and allow a student to consider a primary care career.\n\n“Considering the expense of medical school, it is understandable that many doctors feel that they need to become specialists in a field of medicine,” said Rhonda. “We wouldn’t mind that this scholarship would allow a student to pursue a career in primary care, and we would love it if it was in a rural community in Arkansas.”\n\nThe couple also said the scholarship honors their parents.\n\n“Rhonda and I have been blessed with great lives and much of that is because of our respective parents,” said Ken. “Growing up, we both received great support and love from our families, and it set us up to both have fulfilling careers.”\n\nRhonda retired as the medical director of Pediatric Emergency Medicine at Arkansas Children’s Hospital in 2019.\n\nKen retired as an assistant director of fiscal services for the Arkansas Bureau of Legislative Branch in 2006.\n\nDr. Edward Forrest Ellis Scholarship\n\nIn 1989, Dr. Ruth Ellis Lesh of Fayetteville established the Dr. Edward Forrest Ellis Scholarship as a loving memorial to her father who practiced medicine until his death in 1957 at the age of 93. Dr. Ellis was the first physician to perform major surgery in northwest Arkansas. He was born August 19, 1863, and moved to northwest Arkansas in 1866. In 1885, he graduated from Missouri Medical College in St Louis, which later became Washington University Medical School. In 1885, he became a member of the Washington County (Arkansas) Medical Society and the Arkansas Medical Society (President 1918-19). Dr. Ellis practiced in Hindsville for ten years, Springdale until 1904 and Fayetteville until his death in 1957. Dr. Lesh, a respected member of the Arkansas medical community, established the scholarship to assist medical students who demonstrate superior academic achievement and who possess character qualities to become outstanding physicians.

Ellison Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship was established in memory of Dr. E.T. Ellison of Texarkana by his children, Dr. E.T. Ellison, Jr, Class of 1973, and Mrs. Mary Ellison Becker. Dr. Ellison was chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at UAMS (1947-1948) when he left to help found the Collum-Carney Clinic in Texarkana. He continued to maintain his academic interests while pursuing his career as an excellent clinician. He loved both the intellectual mastery of the medical sciences and the application of that mastery to the relief of human suffering. In addition to publishing numerous articles in his field, Dr. Ellison had a well-developed grasp of all aspects of medicine. He was an extremely gifted technical surgeon and attributed his skill in that area to his emphasis on economy of motion. He was always very energetic, open to new ideas, and attentive to the complaints of patients and suggestions of colleagues. Above and beyond his love of medicine and patient care, he had a wide range of interests. He was an accomplished artist, civic supporter, and an avid golfer—one of the few people ever to score a hole-in-one playing left-handed and later to score one playing right-handed. The Ellison family desire that this scholarship be provided to medical students who share his passions and ideals. Preference is given to an entering first-year student from the Texarkana area who demonstrates academic excellence and financial need. The inaugural award was presented in 1994.\n\nDeborah Flowers Fawcett, M.D., Memorial Scholarship\n\nDeborah Lee Flowers Fawcett was born on May 2, 1952, in Hope, Arkansas, to Hollis Vernon Flowers and Myrtle Aline Crosby Flowers.

The trustees of the fund then formed the Ethel Brickey Hicks Charitable Corporation to grant and administer the loans. This became the Hicks Rural Scholarship program. For each year of qualifying rural practice, the graduate’s loan, up to $19,000 a year, was deemed a scholarship. Over the years, the program was highly successful, with approximately 95% of students practicing in qualifying rural Arkansas communities.\n\nIn addition to this program, beginning in 1999 the corporation’s trustees awarded $10,000 each year for the Ethel Brickey Hicks Merit Scholarship. This was awarded to a senior UAMS medical student, voted on by their classmates as to whom they would most want to represent their profession to the public. Through these two scholarships, the Ethel Brickey Hicks trust has awarded more than $1.7 million to UAMS medical students over the past 27 years.\n\nThe corporation’s $1 million gift represents the transfer of trust funds to UAMS to continue Hicks’ wishes to aid medical students for as long as possible. Now, the College of Medicine Scholarship Committee will determine the number of scholarships and amounts awarded each year, with preference given to medical students who pledge to practice in medically underserved communities. The new scholarship will be called the Ethel Brickey Hicks Endowed Scholarship.\n\nThe corporation credited Tom South, assistant dean for medical student admissions in the College of Medicine, with ensuring the success of the Hicks scholarships over the years. South, who has been with UAMS and the College of Medicine since 1984, is an ex-officio member on the college’s Scholarship Committee and has administered and shepherded countless medical student scholarships for more than 35 years.\n\n“To me, Tom South is a very important person to the Ethel Brickey Hicks Corporation’s giving to UAMS,” said trustee Janet Moore. “We often thought of making gifts to students outside Arkansas but did not because Tom made it so much easier for us to continue with our program at UAMS. He always adapted to whatever scenarios we wanted to propose. As far as I am concerned, Tom was responsible for bringing about the $10,000 merit award that was given to students for many, many years, and he was responsible for the funds staying solely within the College of Medicine.”\n\nAs an expression of appreciation to the Ethel Brickey Hicks Trustees, James S. Tipton of Nashville, Tennessee and Janet K. Moore of Hot Springs, Arkansas, Dean Smyth shared “Thank you so much for serving as trustees and facilitating this $1 million gift from the Ethel Brickey Hicks Charitable Corporation. Providing scholarships for students who want to practice in rural areas is a great step to reducing health disparities in Arkansas. This is a major priority for our college and a personal priority for me as Dean. This gift will help move these priorities forward.”\n\nJohn R. and Wilkie Dolby Hogan Endowed Scholarship\n\nJohn Rean Hogan and Wilkie Frost Dolby Hogan were married in January 1992 in North Little Rock. Mr. Hogan died on March 7, 1999, at the age of 96, and Mrs. Hogan died on November 27, 2009, at the age of 94. “Wilkie” was born February 17, 1915, in Huttig, Arkansas, the daughter of Amos Virgil and Wilkie Matilda Frost.

Dolby, after 56 years of marriage; her second husband, John R. Hogan, after seven years of marriage; and her firstborn son, John F. Dolby at age 39, as well as three brothers and four sisters. Mrs. Hogan established an annuity and expressed her desire to “support the work of the College of Medicine of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and in particular scholarships for students enrolled in the College of Medicine.” Upon termination of the annuity, the principal was distributed to establish the John R. and Wilkie Dolby Hogan Endowed Scholarship Fund. Her daughter, Annette Dolby Hester of Little Rock, stated it was her mother’s desire that scholarships be awarded to medical students on the basis of need and merit. The inaugural scholarship was awarded in 2012.\n\nDr. W.

He served as Professor of Dermatology in the College of Medicine where he made valuable contributions to his profession, particularly in the field of mycology. He earned the affection and appreciation of his patients. In his teaching career at the College of Medicine, he was demanding of and devoted to his students and residents, who called him “Attila the Honey.” Dr. Honeycutt was honored with the College of Medicine Distinguished Service Award after his untimely death at age 48. His friends and family, led by a former student, Paul S. Greenberg, M.D., chose to honor him by presenting a scholarship in his name, to be awarded annually to a medical student of character, compassion, collegiality and scholastic achievement.\n\nMrs. Janet Honeycutt served as the Executive Director of the Arkansas Caduceus Club for 20 years She graduated from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville where she met and subsequently married Dr. Honeycutt while he was in medical school. Janet was also awarded the College of Medicine Distinguished Service Award in 2004, making Dr. and Mrs. Honeycutt the only husband and wife team to win this award. Mrs. Honeycutt‘s poise and determination have been instrumental in earning the Arkansas Caduceus Club the reputation as one of the most exceptional alumni associations in the nation. Janet’s grace, endearing charm, her infectious character, boundless energy, and her enthusiasm for life were the foundation of her many accomplishments. Janet passed away after a brief illness in 2004. She will be greatly missed by all whose lives she has touched. Dr. and Mrs. Honeycutt’s children chose to honor both their father and mother with this scholarship. The inaugural Honeycutt award was presented in 1997 to William McDonnell of Hot Springs.

UAMS is certainly grateful for their service, leadership and generosity.”\n\nCreated in 2018, the Dr. Michael and Paula Jennings Distinguished Scholarship will be renamed the Dr. Michael Jennings and Paula Jennings Chancellor’s Scholarship when the pledged gift raises the endowed level to $1 million. It is awarded to a medical student entering their third year in the College of Medicine. The recipient is chosen each academic year based on financial need and experience or an interest in medical or health-related research, as determined by the College of Medicine Scholarship Committee.\n\n“I would not have been able to attend college without scholarship help, so we are very aware of the importance of financial aid, and I am grateful for the help I received,” said Paula Jennings. “Medical school is very expensive, and it is common for students to take on debt. Providing financial assistance eases the burden for students and may give them more flexibility in choosing their area of medicine without being driven by salary needs.”\n\nMichael Jennings, who was raised in northeastern Ohio, graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a bachelor’s degree in physics in 1970. He received a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard University in 1976. He then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt, Germany.
