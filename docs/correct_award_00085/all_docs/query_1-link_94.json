        "text": "Description\n\nWinston Churchill by Michael Wolff\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1953 was awarded to Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill “for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values.” Winston Churchill, one of the 20th century’s most prominent statesmen, also left behind a large body of writing. His works include an autobiography in which he describes his adventurous years as an officer and war correspondent, a comprehensive biography of his ancestor, the first Duke of Marlborough, and a multivolume work about the First and Second World Wars. The books are characterized by colourful narration but also by objectivity. Winston Churchill’s magnificent and epoch-making speeches during World War II also belong to his most important written works.\n\nFeatures;\n\nThe Great Nobel Prizes Series\n\nPublisher Heron Books, London; 1970\n\nMaroon Faux Leather Boards With Black Spine Hardback, 320 pp\n\nWith b/w illustrations throughout\n\nSize 205x125mm, 700g\n\nCondition: Very Good – Previous Owners Name, Very Good Copy\n\n5 Good Reasons To BUY NOW !!!\n\nFREE UK Delivery, Overseas Postage at Reduced Rate\n\nSuperfast Delivery – I always try to post within 24 hrs of payment to ensure you get your book(s) as quickly as possible.\n\nProfessional Packaging – I always use Top Quality packaging products to ensure you receive your item in the condition it was sent.\n\nMember of IOBA – “The books you want…from sellers you can trust”, www.ioba.org\n\n100% Satisfaction Guaranteed – If you are not 100% satisfied with your book then simply return it for a refund"
