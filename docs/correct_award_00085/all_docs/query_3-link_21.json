        "text": "Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, (30\n\nNovember 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British politician\n\nand author, best known as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n\nduring the Second World War. At various times a soldier, author\n\nand politician, Churchill is generally regarded as one of the\n\nmost important leaders in modern British and world history. He\n\nwon the 1953 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nChurchill's legal surname was\n\nSpencer-Churchill (he was related to the Spencer family), but\n\nstarting with his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, his branch of\n\nthe family used the name Churchill in his public\n\nlife.Contents\n\nEarly life of\n\nWinston Churchill\n\nWinston Churchill was a descendant of the\n\nfirst famous member of the Churchill family, John Churchill, 1st\n\nDuke of Marlborough. Winston's politician father, Lord Randolph\n\nChurchill, was the third son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough;\n\nWinston's mother was Lady Randolph Churchill (née Jennie\n\nJerome), daughter of American millionaire Leonard\n\nJerome.\n\nWinston Churchill was born in Blenheim\n\nPalace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire; he arrived unexpectedly early\n\nwhen his mother was attending a ball and was born in the ladies'\n\nroom. As was typical for upper-class boys at that time, he spent\n\nmuch of his childhood at boarding schools. He sat the entrance\n\nexam for Harrow School, but, famously, on confronting the Latin\n\npaper, carefully wrote the title, his name, and the number 1\n\nfollowed by a dot, and could not think of anything else to write.\n\nHe was accepted despite this, but placed in the bottom division\n\nwhere they were primarily taught English, at which he excelled.\n\nToday, this famous ancient public school offers an annual\n\nChurchill essay-prize on a subject chosen by the head of the\n\nEnglish department.\n\nHe was rarely visited by his mother (then\n\nknown as Lady Randolph), whom he virtually worshipped, despite\n\nhis letters begging her to either come or let his father permit\n\nhim to come home. In later years, after Winston reached\n\nadulthood, he and his mother became closer, developing a kinship\n\nalmost more like a brother and a sister than son and mother,\n\ncoupled by a strong friendship.\n\nHe followed his father's career keenly but\n\nhad a distant relationship with him. Once, in 1886, he is\n\nreported to have proclaimed \"My daddy is Chancellor of the\n\nExchequer and one day that's what I'm going to be.\" His desolate,\n\nlonely childhood stayed with him throughout his life. On the\n\nother hand, as a child he was very close to his nurse, Elizabeth\n\nAnne Everest (who would be known now as a nanny), and was deeply\n\nsaddened when she died on 3 July 1895. He paid for her gravestone\n\nat the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium.\n\nChurchill did badly at Harrow, regularly\n\nbeing punished for poor work and lack of effort. His nature was\n\nindependent and rebellious and he failed to achieve much\n\nacademically, failing some of the same courses numerous times and\n\nrefusing to study the classics (that is, Latin and Ancient\n\nGreek). Despite this, he showed great ability in other areas such\n\nas history, in which he was sometimes top of his class. The view\n\nof Churchill as a failure at school is one which he himself\n\npropagated, probably due to his father's disappointment regarding\n\nthe young Winston and his obvious readiness to label his son as\n\nsuch. He did, however, become the school's fencing\n\nchampion.\n\nThe\n\nArmy\n\nChurchill attended the Royal Military\n\nAcademy Sandhurst. Upon his graduation at age 20, Churchill\n\njoined the army as a Subaltern of the IV (Queen's Own) Hussars\n\nCavalry regiment. This regiment was stationed in Bangalore,\n\nIndia. On arriving in India, Churchill dislocated his shoulder\n\nwhile reaching from his boat for a chain on the dock and being\n\nthrown against the quay. This shoulder gave him trouble in later\n\nyears, occasionally dislocating from its socket.\n\nIn India the main occupation of Churchill's\n\nregiment was polo, a situation which did not appeal to the young\n\nman, hungry for more military action. He devoted his time to\n\neducating himself from books which he had sent out. The Bangalore\n\nClub, of which he was a member, has records (which they display\n\nto visitors) showing that Winston Churchill failed to pay dues of\n\n13 rupees, due to 'financial penury', a debt they believe to be\n\nstill outstanding. [1]\n\nWhile stationed in India, he began to seek\n\nout wars. In 1895 he and Reggie Barnes obtained leave to travel\n\nto Cuba to observe the Spanish battles against Cuban guerrillas.\n\nChurchill also obtained a commission to write about the conflict\n\nfrom the Daily Graphic newspaper. To Churchill's delight he came\n\nunder fire for the first time on his twenty-first birthday. On\n\nhis way to Cuba he also made his first visit to the United\n\nStates, being introduced to New York society by one of his\n\nmother's lovers, Bourke Cockran. In 1897 Churchill attempted to\n\ntravel to the Greco-Turkish War but this conflict effectively\n\nended before he could arrive. He therefore continued on to\n\nEngland on leave before hearing of the Pathan revolt on the North\n\nWest Frontier and rushing back to India to participate in the\n\ncampaign to put it down.\n\nChurchill had previously obtained a promise\n\nfrom Sir Bindon Blood, the commander of this expedition, that if\n\nhe were to command again Churchill could accompany him. He wasted\n\nno time in reminding Blood of his promise and was able to\n\nparticipate in the six-week campaign, also writing articles for\n\nthe newspapers The Pioneer and The Daily Telegraph at £5 an\n\narticle. By October 1897 Churchill was back in Britain and his\n\nfirst book, The Story of the Malakand Field Force, on that\n\ncampaign, was published in December.\n\nWhile still officially stationed in India,\n\nand having obtained a long period of leave, Churchill attempted\n\nto get himself assigned to the army being put together and\n\ncommanded by Lord Kitchener and intended to achieve the\n\nreconquest of the Sudan. Kitchener was opposed to having\n\nChurchill on the staff, feeling he should be back with his\n\nregiment in India, but Churchill pulled a great many strings to\n\nget his presence approved—even arranging for a telegram to\n\nKitchener from the Prime Minister the Marquess of Salisbury. In\n\nthe end, Churchill was able to attend the war after obtaining a\n\nposting to the 21st Lancers—a force whose composition was\n\nchosen by the War Office, not Kitchener. He also served as a war\n\ncorrespondent for the Morning Post, at a rate of £15 per\n\ncolumn. While in the Sudan, Churchill participated in what has\n\nbeen described as the last meaningful British cavalry charge at\n\nthe battle of Omdurman. By October 1898 he had returned to\n\nBritain and begun work on the two-volume The River War, published\n\nthe following year.\n\nIn 1899 Churchill left the army and decided\n\nupon a parliamentary career. He stood as a Conservative candidate\n\nin Oldham constituency in a by-election of that year. He came in\n\nthird (Oldham was at that time a two-seat borough), failing to be\n\nelected.\n\nOn 12 October 1899 the second Anglo-Boer\n\nwar between Britain and Afrikaners broke out in South Africa.\n\nChurchill set off as a war correspondent for the Morning Post,\n\nreceiving £250 a month for four months. Once in South\n\nAfrica he accepted a lift on a British Army Armoured Train under\n\nthe command of Aylmer Haldane; this train was thrown off the\n\ntracks by a Boer ambush and explosion. Churchill, though not\n\nofficially a combatant, took charge of operations to get the\n\ntrack cleared and managed to ensure that the engine and half the\n\ntrain, carrying the wounded, could escape. Churchill, however,\n\nwas not so lucky and, together with other officers and soldiers\n\nwas captured and held in a POW camp in Pretoria, despite doubt\n\nabout his combatant status.\n\nChurchill managed to escape from his prison\n\ncamp, resulting in a long-running criticism and controversy as it\n\nwas claimed that he did not wait for Haldane and another man who\n\nhad planned the escape, but who were unable, or unwilling, to\n\nrisk slipping over the fence when Churchill did. Once outside the\n\nPretoria prison camp Churchill travelled almost 300 miles (480\n\nkm) to Portuguese Lourenço Marques in Delagoa Bay. He\n\nachieved this due to the assistance of an English mine manager\n\nwho hid him down his mine and smuggled him onto a train headed\n\nout of Boer territory. His escape made him a minor national hero\n\nfor a time in Britain, though instead of returning home he took\n\nship to Durban and rejoined General Redvers Buller's army on its\n\nmarch to relieve Ladysmith and take Pretoria. This time, although\n\ncontinuing as a war correspondent, Churchill gained a commission\n\nin the South African Light Horse Regiment. He fought at Spion Kop\n\nand was one of the first British troops into Ladysmith and\n\nPretoria; in fact, he and the Duke of Marlborough, his cousin,\n\nwere able to get ahead of the rest of the troops in Pretoria,\n\nwhere they demanded and received the surrender of 52 Boer guards\n\nof the prison camp there.\n\nChurchill's two books on the Boer war,\n\nLondon to Ladysmith via Pretoria and Ian Hamilton's March, were\n\npublished in May and October 1900 respectively.\n\nChurchill in\n\nParliament\n\nAfter returning from South Africa,\n\nChurchill again stood as a Conservative party candidate in\n\nOldham, this time in the 1900 general election, or Khaki\n\nelection.\n\nHe was duly elected, but rather than\n\nattending the opening of Parliament, he embarked on a speaking\n\ntour throughout the United Kingdom and the United States, by\n\nmeans of which he raised ten thousand pounds for himself.\n\n(Members of Parliament were unpaid in those days and Churchill\n\nwas not rich by the standards of the time.) While in the United\n\nStates, one of his speeches was introduced by Mark Twain, and he\n\ndined with the New York Governor and Vice-President Theodore\n\nRoosevelt.\n\nIn February 1901 Churchill arrived back in\n\nthe United Kingdom to enter Parliament, and became associated\n\nwith a group of Tory dissidents led by Lord Hugh Cecil and\n\nreferred to as the Hughligans, a play on \"Hooligans\". During his\n\nfirst parliamentary session Churchill provoked controversy by\n\nopposing the government's army estimates, arguing against\n\nextravagant military expenditure. By 1903 he was drawing away\n\nfrom Lord Hugh's views. He also opposed the Liberal Unionist\n\nleader Joseph Chamberlain whose party was in coalition with the\n\nConservatives. Chamberlain proposed extensive tariff reforms\n\nintended to protect the economic pre-eminence of Britain behind\n\ntariff barriers. This earned him the detestation of his own\n\nsupporters — indeed, Conservative backbenchers staged a\n\nwalkout once while he was speaking. His own constituency\n\neffectively deselected him, although he continued to sit for\n\nOldham until the next general election.\n\nIn 1904 Churchill's dissatisfaction with\n\nthe Conservatives and the appeal of the Liberals had grown so\n\nstrong that on returning from the Whitsun recess he crossed the\n\nfloor to sit as a member of the Liberal Party. As a Liberal he\n\ncontinued to campaign for free trade. The winnable seat of\n\nManchester North West was found for him for the 1906 general\n\nelection which he won.\n\nFrom 1903 until 1905 Churchill was also\n\nengaged in writing Lord Randolph Churchill, a two-volume\n\nbiography of his father which came out in 1906 and was received\n\nas a masterpiece. However, filial devotion caused him to soften\n\nsome of his father's less attractive aspects.\n\nMinisterial\n\noffice\n\nWhen the Liberals took office, with Henry\n\nCampbell-Bannerman as Prime Minister, in December 1905 Churchill\n\nbecame Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. Serving under\n\nthe Secretary of State for the Colonies, Victor Bruce, 9th Earl\n\nof Elgin, Churchill dealt with the adoption of constitutions for\n\nthe defeated Boer republics of the Transvaal and Orange River\n\nColony and with the issue of 'Chinese slavery' in South African\n\nmines. He also became a prominent spokesman on free trade.\n\nChurchill soon became the most prominent member of the Government\n\noutside the Cabinet, and when Campbell-Bannerman was succeeded by\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith in 1908, it came as little surprise when\n\nChurchill was promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board\n\nof Trade. Under the law at the time, a newly appointed Cabinet\n\nMinister was obliged to seek re-election at a by-election.\n\nChurchill lost his Manchester seat to the Conservative William\n\nJoynson-Hicks but was soon elected in another by-election at\n\nDundee constituency. As President of the Board of Trade he\n\npursued radical social reforms in conjunction with David Lloyd\n\nGeorge, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nIn 1910 Churchill was promoted to Home\n\nSecretary, where he was to prove somewhat controversial. A famous\n\nphotograph from the time shows the impetuous Churchill taking\n\npersonal charge of the January 1911 Sidney Street Siege, peering\n\naround a corner to view a gun battle between cornered anarchists\n\nand Scots Guards. His role attracted much criticism. The building\n\nunder siege caught fire. Churchill denied the fire brigade\n\naccess, forcing the criminals to choose surrender or death.\n\nArthur Balfour asked, \"He [Churchill] and a photographer were\n\nboth risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer\n\nwas doing but what was the Right Honourable gentleman\n\ndoing?\"\n\n1910 also saw Churchill preventing the army\n\nbeing used to deal with a dispute at the Cambrian Colliery mine\n\nin Tonypandy. Initially Churchill blocked the use of troops\n\nfearing a repeat of the 1887 'bloody sunday' in Trafalgar Square.\n\nNevertheless troops were deployed to protect the mines and to\n\navoid riots when thirteen strikers were tried for minor offences,\n\nan action that broke the tradition of not involving the military\n\nin civil affairs and led to lingering dislike for Churchill in\n\nWales.\n\nIn 1911, Churchill became First Lord of the\n\nAdmiralty, a post he would hold into the First World War. He gave\n\nimpetus to military reform efforts, including development of\n\nnaval aviation, tanks, and the switch in fuel from coal to oil, a\n\nmassive engineering task, also reliant on securing Mesopotamia's\n\noil rights, bought circa 1907 through the secret service using\n\nthe Royal Burmah Oil Company as a front company.\n\nThe development of the battle tank was\n\nfinanced from naval research funds via the Landships Committee,\n\nand, although a decade later development of the battle tank would\n\nbe seen as a stroke of genius, at the time it was seen as\n\nmisappropriation of funds. The tank was deployed too early and in\n\ntoo few numbers, much to Churchill's annoyance. He wanted a fleet\n\nof tanks used to surprise the Germans under cover of smoke, and\n\nto open a large section of the trenches by crushing barbed wire\n\nand creating a breakthrough sector.\n\nIn 1915 Churchill was one of the political\n\nand military engineers of the disastrous Gallipoli landings on\n\nthe Dardanelles during World War I. Churchill took much of the\n\nblame for the fiasco, and when Prime Minister Asquith formed an\n\nall-party coalition government, the Conservatives demanded\n\nChurchill's demotion as the price for entry. For several months\n\nChurchill served in the sinecure of Chancellor of the Duchy of\n\nLancaster, before resigning from the government feeling his\n\nenergies were not being used. He rejoined the army, though\n\nremaining an MP, and served for several months on the Western\n\nFront. During this period his second in command was a young\n\nArchibald Sinclair who would later lead the Liberal\n\nParty.\n\nChurchill's\n\nReturn to power\n\nIn December 1916, Asquith resigned as Prime\n\nMinister and was replaced by Lloyd George. The time was thought\n\nnot yet right to risk the Conservatives' wrath by bringing\n\nChurchill back into government. However, in July 1917 Churchill\n\nwas appointed Minister of Munitions. He was the main architect of\n\nthe Ten Year Rule, but the major preoccupation of his tenure in\n\nthe War Office was the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil\n\nWar. Churchill was a staunch advocate of foreign intervention,\n\ndeclaring that Bolshevism must be \"strangled in its cradle\". He\n\nsecured from a divided and loosely organised Cabinet\n\nintensification and prolongation of the British involvement\n\nbeyond the wishes of any major group in Parliament or the nation\n\n— and in the face of the bitter hostility of Labour. In\n\n1920, after the last British forces had been withdrawn, Churchill\n\nwas instrumental in having arms sent to the Poles when they\n\ninvaded Ukraine. He became Secretary of State for the Colonies in\n\n1921 and was a signatory of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which\n\nestablished the Irish Free State.\n\nCareer between\n\nthe wars\n\nIn October 1922, Churchill underwent an\n\noperation to remove his appendix. Upon his return, he learned\n\nthat the government had fallen and a General Election was\n\nlooming. The Liberal Party was now beset by internal division and\n\nChurchill's campaign was weak. He lost his seat at Dundee to\n\nprohibitionist, Edwin Scrymgeour, quipping that he had lost his\n\nministerial office, his seat and his appendix all at once.\n\nChurchill stood for the Liberals again in the 1923 general\n\nelection, losing in Leicester, but over the next few months he\n\nmoved towards the Conservative Party, though initially using the\n\nlabels \"Anti-Socialist\" and \"Constitutionalist\". Less than one\n\nyear later, in the General Election of 1924, he was elected to\n\nrepresent Epping as a \"Constitutionalist\" with Conservative\n\nbacking (a statue in his honour in Woodford Green was erected\n\nwhen Woodford Green was part of the Epping constituency). The\n\nfollowing year he formally rejoined the Conservative Party,\n\ncommenting wryly that \"Anyone can rat [change parties], but it\n\ntakes a certain ingenuity to re-rat.\"\n\nHe was appointed Chancellor of the\n\nExchequer in 1924 under Stanley Baldwin and oversaw the United\n\nKingdom's disastrous return to the Gold Standard, which resulted\n\nin deflation, unemployment, and the miners' strike that led to\n\nthe General Strike of 1926. This decision prompted the economist\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes to write The Economic Consequences of Mr.\n\nChurchill, correctly arguing that the return to the gold standard\n\nwould lead to a world depression. Churchill later regarded this\n\nas one of the worst decisions of his life. To be fair, it must be\n\nnoted that he was not an economist and that he acted on the\n\nadvice of the Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman (of\n\nwhom Keynes said, \"Always so charming, always so\n\nwrong.\")\n\nDuring the General Strike of 1926,\n\nChurchill was reported to have suggested that machine guns be\n\nused on the striking miners. Churchill edited the Government's\n\nnewspaper, the British Gazette, and during the dispute he argued\n\nthat \"either the country will break the General Strike, or the\n\nGeneral Strike will break the country.\" Furthermore, he\n\ncontroversially claimed that the Fascism of Benito Mussolini had\n\n\"rendered a service to the whole world,\" showing, as it had, \"a\n\nway to combat subversive forces\" — that is, he considered\n\nthe regime to be a bulwark against the perceived threat of\n\nCommunist revolution. At one point, Churchill went as far as to\n\ncall Mussolini the \"Roman genius … the greatest lawgiver among\n\nmen.\"\n\nThe Conservative government was defeated in\n\nthe 1929 General Election. In the next two years, Churchill\n\nbecame estranged from the Conservative leadership over the issues\n\nof protective tariffs and Indian Home Rule, which he bitterly\n\nopposed. He denigrated the father of the Indian independence\n\nmovement, Mahatma Gandhi, as \"a half-naked fakir\" who \"ought to\n\nbe laid, bound hand and foot, at the gates of Delhi and then\n\ntrampled on by an enormous elephant with the new viceroy seated\n\non its back\". When Ramsay MacDonald formed the National\n\nGovernment in 1931, Churchill was not invited to join the\n\nCabinet. He was now at the lowest point in his career, in a\n\nperiod known as \"the wilderness years\". He spent much of the next\n\nfew years concentrating on his writing, including Marlborough:\n\nHis Life and Times — a biography of his ancestor John\n\nChurchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough — and A History of the\n\nEnglish Speaking Peoples (which was not published until well\n\nafter WWII). He became most notable for his outspoken opposition\n\ntowards the granting of independence to India (see Simon\n\nCommission and Government of India Act 1935).\n\nSoon, though, his attention was drawn to\n\nthe rise of Adolf Hitler and the dangers of Germany's rearmament.\n\nFor a time he was a lone voice calling on Britain to strengthen\n\nitself to counter the belligerence of Germany. [2] Churchill was\n\na fierce critic of Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler,\n\nleading the wing of the Conservative Party that opposed the\n\nMunich Agreement which Chamberlain famously declared to mean\n\n\"peace in our time\". [3] He was also an outspoken supporter of\n\nKing Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis, leading to some\n\nspeculation that he might be appointed Prime Minister if the King\n\nrefused to take Baldwin's advice and consequently the government\n\nresigned. However, this did not happen, and Churchill found\n\nhimself politically isolated and bruised for some time after\n\nthis.\n\nRole as wartime\n\nPrime Minister\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War\n\nChurchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, just as he\n\nwas in the first part of the First World War. According to myth,\n\nthe Navy sent out: \"Winston's back!\"\n\nIn this job he proved to be one of the\n\nhighest-profile ministers during the so-called \"Phony War\", when\n\nthe only noticeable action was at sea. Churchill advocated the\n\npre-emptive occupation of the neutral Norwegian iron-ore port of\n\nNarvik and the iron mines in Kiruna, Sweden, early in the War.\n\nHowever, Chamberlain and the rest of the War Cabinet disagreed,\n\nand the operation was delayed until the German invasion of\n\nNorway, which was successful despite British efforts.\n\nOn 10 May 1940, hours before the German\n\ninvasion of France by a surprising lightning advance through the\n\nLow Countries, it became clear that, following failure in Norway\n\nand general incompetence, the country had no confidence in\n\nChamberlain's prosecution of the war and so Chamberlain resigned.\n\nThe commonly accepted version of events states that Lord Halifax\n\nturned down the post of Prime Minister because he believed he\n\ncould not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords\n\ninstead of the House of Commons. Although traditionally the Prime\n\nMinister does not advise the King on the former's successor,\n\nChamberlain wanted someone who would command the support of all\n\nthree major parties in the House of Commons. A meeting with the\n\nother two party leaders led to the recommendation of Churchill,\n\nand as a constitutional monarch, George VI asked Churchill to be\n\nPrime Minister and to form an all-party government. Churchill,\n\nbreaking with tradition, did not send Chamberlain a message\n\nexpressing regret over his resignation.\n\nOne author has alleged that that the King\n\nfavoured the appointment of Halifax, fearing that his own reign\n\nwould not survive the war, and thought that Halifax would\n\nnegotiate a settlement with Hitler to allow Britain to stay out\n\nof the war, so preserving the monarchy.\n\nChurchill's greatest achievement was that\n\nhe refused to capitulate when defeat by Germany was a strong\n\npossibility and he remained a strong opponent of any negotiations\n\nwith Germany. Few others in the Cabinet had this degree of\n\nresolve. By adopting this policy Churchill maintained the United\n\nKingdom as a base from which the Allies would eventually attack\n\nGermany, thereby ensuring that the Soviet sphere of influence did\n\nnot also extend over Western Europe at the end of the\n\nwar.\n\nIn response to previous criticisms that\n\nthere had been no clear single minister in charge of the\n\nprosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional\n\nposition of Minister of Defence. He immediately put his friend\n\nand confidant, the industrialist and newspaper baron Lord\n\nBeaverbrook, in charge of aircraft production. It was\n\nBeaverbrook's astounding business acumen that allowed Britain to\n\nquickly gear up aircraft production and engineering that\n\neventually made the difference in the war.\n\nChurchill's speeches were a great\n\ninspiration to the embattled United Kingdom. His first speech as\n\nPrime Minister was the famous \"I have nothing to offer but blood,\n\ntoil, tears, and sweat\" speech. He followed that closely with two\n\nother equally famous ones, given just before the Battle of\n\nBritain. One included the immortal line, \"We shall defend our\n\nisland, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches,\n\nwe shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the\n\nfields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall\n\nnever surrender.\" The other included the equally famous \"Let us\n\ntherefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves\n\nthat, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a\n\nthousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'\n\n\" At the height of the Battle of Britain, his bracing survey of\n\nthe situation included the memorable line \"Never in the field of\n\nhuman conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\", which\n\nengendered the enduring nickname \"The Few\" for the Allied fighter\n\npilots who won it. One of his most memorable war speeches came on\n\nNovember 10th 1942 at the Lord Mayor's Luncheon at Mansion House\n\nin London. That day, word had come that American and British\n\ntroops had surrounded the port of Casablanca in Africa. As most\n\npeople were saying it was the beginning of the end, Churchill\n\nfamously said\n\n\"This is not the end. It is not even the\n\nbeginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the\n\nbeginning\"\n\nHis good relationship with Franklin D.\n\nRoosevelt secured the United Kingdom vital supplies via the North\n\nAtlantic Ocean shipping routes. It was for this reason that\n\nChurchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected. Upon\n\nre-election, Roosevelt immediately set about implementing a new\n\nmethod of not only providing military hardware to Britain without\n\nthe need for monetary payment, but also of providing, free of\n\nfiscal charge, much of the shipping that transported the\n\nsupplies. Put simply, Roosevelt persuaded Congress that repayment\n\nfor this immensely costly service would take the form of\n\ndefending the USA; and so Lend-lease was born. Churchill had 12\n\nstrategic conferences with Roosevelt which covered the Atlantic\n\nCharter, Europe first strategy, the Declaration by the United\n\nNations and other war policies. Churchill initiated the Special\n\nOperations Executive (SOE) under Hugh Dalton's Ministry of\n\nEconomic Warfare, which established, conducted and fostered\n\ncovert, subversive and partisan operations in occupied\n\nterritories with notable success; and also the Commandos which\n\nestablished the pattern for most of the world's current Special\n\nForces. The Russians referred to him as the \"British\n\nBulldog\".\n\nChurchill's health suffered, as shown by a\n\nmild heart attack he suffered in December 1941 at the White House\n\nand also in December 1943 when he contracted\n\npneumonia.\n\nChurchill supported the bombing of Dresden\n\nshortly before the end of the war; many including Churchill, who\n\nwrote about it on 28th March 1945, have since maintained that the\n\ncity was primarily a civilian target with little military\n\nvalue[citation needed]. However, the bombing was seen at the time\n\nas being helpful to the Soviet allies, and the perspective of the\n\nBritish who had lived through the Blitz on London has to be taken\n\ninto account (who considered that the destruction of cities was\n\nboth just retribution for German attacks on British cities, and\n\nalso a lesson to Germany never to go to war again).\n\nChurchill was party to treaties that would\n\nredraw post-WWII European and Asian boundaries. These were\n\ndiscussed as early as 1943. Proposals for European boundaries and\n\nsettlements were officially agreed to by Harry S. Truman,\n\nChurchill, and Stalin at Potsdam. At the second Quebec Conference\n\nin 1944 he drafted and together with U.S. President Franklin D.\n\nRoosevelt signed a toned down version of the original Morgenthau\n\nPlan, where they pledged to convert Germany after her\n\nunconditional surrender \"into a country primarily agricultural\n\nand pastoral in its character.\"\n\nThe settlement concerning the borders of\n\nPoland, i.e. the boundary between Poland and the Soviet Union and\n\nbetween Germany and Poland, was viewed as a betrayal in Poland\n\nduring the post-war years, as it was established against the\n\nviews of the Polish government in exile. Churchill was convinced\n\nthat the only way to alleviate tensions between the two\n\npopulations was the transfer of people, to match the national\n\nborders. As he expounded in the House of Commons in 1944,\n\n\"Expulsion is the method which, insofar as we have been able to\n\nsee, will be the most satisfactory and lasting. There will be no\n\nmixture of populations to cause endless trouble… A clean sweep\n\nwill be made. I am not alarmed by these transferences, which are\n\nmore possible in modern conditions.\" However the resulting\n\nexpulsions of Germans was carried out by the Soviet Union in a\n\nway which resulted in much hardship and, according to amongst\n\nothers a 1966 report by the West German Ministry of Refugees and\n\nDisplaced Persons, the death of over 2,100,000. Churchill opposed\n\nthe effective annexation of Poland by the Soviet Union and wrote\n\nbitterly about it in his books, but he was unable to prevent it\n\nat the conferences.\n\nOn 9 October 1944, he and Eden were in\n\nMoscow, and that night they met Stalin in the Kremlin, without\n\nthe Americans. Bargaining went on throughout the night. Churchill\n\nwrote on a scrap of paper that Stalin had a 90 percent \"interest\"\n\nin Romania, Britain a 90 percent \"interest\" in Greece, both\n\nRussia and Britain a 50 percent interest in Yugoslavia. When they\n\ngot to Italy, Stalin ceded that country to Churchill. The crucial\n\nquestions arose when the Ministers of Foreign Affairs discussed\n\n\"percentages\" in Eastern Europe. Molotov's proposals were that\n\nRussia should have a 75 percent interest in Hungary, 75 percent\n\nin Bulgaria, and 60 percent in Yugoslavia. This was Stalin's\n\nprice for ceding Italy and Greece. Eden tried to haggle: Hungary\n\n75/25, Bulgaria 80/20, but Yugoslavia 50/50. After lengthy\n\nbargaining they settled on an 80/20 division of interest between\n\nRussia and Britain in Bulgaria and Hungary, and a 50/50 division\n\nin Yugoslavia. U.S. Ambassador Harriman was informed only after\n\nthe bargain was struck. This gentleman's agreement was sealed\n\nwith a handshake.\n\nAfter World War\n\nII\n\nAlthough the importance of Churchill's role\n\nin World War II was undeniable, he had many enemies in his own\n\ncountry. His expressed contempt for a number of popular ideas, in\n\nparticular public health care and better education for the\n\nmajority of the population, produced much dissatisfaction amongst\n\nthe population, particularly those who had fought in the war.\n\nImmediately following the close of the war in Europe, Churchill\n\nwas heavily defeated in the 1945 election by Clement Attlee and\n\nthe Labour Party. [7] Some historians think that many British\n\nvoters believed that the man who had led the nation so well in\n\nwar was not the best man to lead it in peace. Others see the\n\nelection result as a reaction not against Churchill personally,\n\nbut against the Conservative Party's record in the 1930s under\n\nBaldwin and Chamberlain.\n\nWinston Churchill was an early supporter of\n\nthe pan-Europeanism that eventually led to the formation of the\n\nEuropean Common Market and later the European Union (for which\n\none of the three main buildings of the European Parliament is\n\nnamed in his honour). Churchill was also instrumental in giving\n\nFrance a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council\n\n(which provided another European power to counterbalance the\n\nSoviet Union's permanent seat). Churchill also occasionally made\n\ncomments supportive of world government. For instance, he once\n\nsaid:\n\nUnless some effective world supergovernment\n\nfor the purpose of preventing war can be set up… the\n\nprospects for peace and human progress are dark…\n\nIf… it is found possible to build a world organization of\n\nirresistible force and inviolable authority for the purpose of\n\nsecuring peace, there are no limits to the blessings which all\n\nmen enjoy and share.\n\nAt the beginning of the Cold War, he\n\nfamously popularised the term: the \"Iron Curtain\", which had been\n\nused before by Nazi leaders Hitler and Goebbels. The term entered\n\nthe public consciousness after a 1946 speech at Westminster\n\nCollege in Fulton, Missouri, when Churchill, a guest of Harry S\n\nTruman, famously declared:\n\nFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in\n\nthe Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.\n\nBehind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna,\n\nBudapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these famous cities\n\nand the populations around them lie in what I must call the\n\nSoviet sphere.\n\nSecond\n\nterm\n\nChurchill was restless and bored as leader\n\nof the Conservative opposition in the immediate post-war years.\n\nAfter Labour's defeat in the General Election of 1951, Churchill\n\nagain became Prime Minister. His third government — after\n\nthe wartime national government and the brief caretaker\n\ngovernment of 1945 — would last until his resignation in\n\n1955. During this period he renewed what he called the \"special\n\nrelationship\" between Britain and the United States, and engaged\n\nhimself in the formation of the post-war order.\n\nHis domestic priorities were, however,\n\novershadowed by a series of foreign policy crises, which were\n\npartly the result of the continued decline of British military\n\nand imperial prestige and power. Being a strong proponent of\n\nBritain as an international power, Churchill would often meet\n\nsuch moments with direct action.\n\nThe Mau Mau\n\nRebellion\n\nIn 1951, grievances against the colonial\n\ndistribution of land came to a head with the Kenya Africa Union\n\ndemanding greater representation and land reform. When these\n\ndemands were rejected, more radical elements came forward,\n\nlaunching the Mau Mau rebellion in 1952. On 17 August 1952, a\n\nstate of emergency was declared, and British troops were flown to\n\nKenya to deal with the rebellion. As both sides increased the\n\nferocity of their attacks, the country moved to full-scale civil\n\nwar.\n\nIn 1953, the Lari massacre, perpetrated by\n\nMau-Mau insurgents against Kikuyu loyal to the British, changed\n\nthe political complexion of the rebellion and gave the\n\npublic-relations advantage to the British. Churchill's strategy\n\nwas to use a military stick combined with implementing many of\n\nthe concessions that Attlee's government had blocked in 1951. He\n\nordered an increased military presence and appointed General Sir\n\nGeorge Erskine, who would implement Operation Anvil in 1954 that\n\nbroke the back of the rebellion in the city of Nairobi. Operation\n\nHammer, in turn, was designed to root out rebels in the\n\ncountryside. Churchill ordered peace talks opened, but these\n\ncollapsed shortly after his leaving office.\n\nMalayan\n\nEmergency\n\nIn Malaya, a rebellion against British rule\n\nhad been in progress since 1948. Once again, Churchill's\n\ngovernment inherited a crisis, and once again Churchill chose to\n\nuse direct military action against those in rebellion while\n\nattempting to build an alliance with those who were not. He\n\nstepped up the implementation of a \"hearts and minds\" campaign\n\nand approved the creation of fortified villages, a tactic that\n\nwould become a recurring part of Western military strategy in\n\nSoutheast Asia.\n\nThe Malayan Emergency was a more direct\n\ncase of a guerrilla movement, centred in an ethnic group, but\n\nbacked by the Soviet Union. As such, Britain's policy of direct\n\nconfrontation and military victory had a great deal more support\n\nthan in Iran or in Kenya. At the highpoint of the conflict, over\n\n35,500 British troops were stationed in Malaya. As the rebellion\n\nlost ground, it began to lose favour with the local\n\npopulation.\n\nWhile the rebellion was slowly being\n\ndefeated, it was equally clear that colonial rule from Britain\n\nwas no longer plausible. In 1953, plans were drawn up for\n\nindependence for Singapore and the other crown colonies in the\n\nregion. The first elections were held in 1955, just days before\n\nChurchill's own resignation, and in 1957, under Prime Minister\n\nAnthony Eden, Malaya became independent.\n\nHonours\n\nFrom 1941 to his death, he was the Lord\n\nWarden of the Cinque Ports, a ceremonial office. In 1941 Canadian\n\nPrime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King swore him into the\n\nQueen's Privy Council for Canada. Although this allowed him to\n\nuse the honorific title \"The Honourable\" and the post-nominal\n\nletters \"P.C.\" both of these were trumped by his membership in\n\nthe Imperial Privy Council which allowed him the use of The Right\n\nHonourable.\n\nIn 1953 he was awarded two major honours:\n\nhe was invested as a Knight of the Garter (becoming Sir Winston\n\nChurchill, KG) and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature\n\n\"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as\n\nwell as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human\n\nvalues\".\n\nA stroke in June of that year led to him\n\nbeing paralysed down his left side. He retired as Prime Minister\n\non 5 April 1955 because of his health but retained his post as\n\nChancellor of the University of Bristol, and remained a member of\n\nparliament until 1964. In 1959 he became Father of the House, the\n\nMP with the longest continuous service.\n\nIn 1955, after retiring as Prime Minister,\n\nChurchill was offered elevation to the peerage in the rank of\n\nduke. He considered the offer, and even chose the name \"Duke of\n\nLondon\". However, he then declined the title after being\n\npersuaded by his son Randolph not to accept it. Since then, only\n\nBritish royals have been made dukes.\n\nIn 1956 Churchill received the Karlspreis\n\n(known in English as the Charlemagne Award), an award by the\n\nGerman city of Aachen to those who most contribute to the\n\nEuropean idea and European peace.\n\nIn 1960, Churchill College, Cambridge was\n\nestablished as the national and Commonwealth memorial to\n\nChurchill.\n\nIn 1963, he became the first person to\n\nbecome an Honorary Citizen of the United States.\n\nChurchill is the tenth most admired person\n\nin the 20th century, according to Gallup.\n\nFour schools in Canada, one in Vancouver,\n\none in Hamilton, one in St. Catharines and one in Calgary were\n\nnamed in his honour.\n\nFamily and\n\nPersonal Life\n\nOn 12 September 1908 at the socially\n\ndesirable St. Margaret's, Westminster, Churchill married\n\nClementine Hozier, a dazzling but largely penniless beauty whom\n\nhe met at a dinner party that March (he had proposed to actress\n\nEthel Barrymore but was turned down). They had five children:\n\nDiana; Randolph; Sarah, who co-starred with Fred Astaire in Royal\n\nWedding; Marigold, who died in early childhood; and Mary, who has\n\nwritten a book about her parents. Churchill's son Randolph and\n\nhis grandsons Nicholas Soames and Winston all followed him into\n\nParliament. The daughters tended to marry politicians and support\n\ntheir careers. Some of the siblings wrote serious\n\nbooks.\n\nClementine's mother was Lady Blanche\n\nHenrietta Ogilvy, second wife of Sir Henry Montague Hozier and a\n\ndaughter of the 7th Earl of Airlie. Clementine's paternity,\n\nhowever, is open to debate. Lady Blanche was well known for\n\nsharing her favours and was eventually divorced as a result. She\n\nmaintained that Clementine's father was Capt. William George\n\n\"Bay\" Middleton, a noted horseman. But Clementine's biographer\n\nJoan Hardwick has surmised, due to Sir Henry Hozier's reputed\n\nsterility, that all Lady Blanche's \"Hozier\" children were\n\nactually fathered by her sister's husband, Algernon Bertram\n\nFreeman-Mitford, better known as a grandfather of the infamous\n\nMitford sisters of the 1920s.\n\nWhen not in London on government business,\n\nChurchill usually lived at his beloved Chartwell House in Kent,\n\ntwo miles south of Westerham. He and his wife bought the house in\n\n1922 and lived there until his death in 1965. During his\n\nChartwell stays, he enjoyed writing as well as painting,\n\nbricklaying, and admiring the estate's famous black\n\nswans.\n\nFor much of his life, Churchill battled\n\nwith depression, which he called his black dog.\n\nAware that he was slowing down both\n\nphysically and mentally, Churchill retired as Prime Minister in\n\n1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden, who had long been his\n\nambitious protégé. (Three years earlier, Eden had\n\nmarried Churchill's niece, Anne Clarissa Spencer-Churchill, his\n\nsecond marriage.) Churchill spent most of his retirement at\n\nChartwell and in the south of France.\n\nIn 1963 U.S. President John F. Kennedy\n\nnamed Churchill the first Honorary Citizen of the United States.\n\nChurchill was too ill to attend the White House ceremony, so his\n\nson and grandson accepted the award for him.\n\nOn 15 January 1965, Churchill suffered\n\nanother stroke — a severe cerebral thrombosis — that\n\nleft him gravely ill. He died nine days later, aged 90, on 24\n\nJanuary 1965, 70 years to the day after his father's\n\ndeath.\n\nBy decree of the Queen, his body lay in\n\nState in Westminster Hall for three days and a state funeral\n\nservice was held at St Paul's Cathedral. [8] This was the first\n\nstate funeral for a non-royal family member since that of Field\n\nMarshal Lord Roberts of Kandahar in 1914.\n\nAs his coffin passed down the Thames on the\n\nHavengore, the cranes of London's docklands bowed in salute. The\n\nRoyal Artillery fired a 19-gun salute (as head of government),\n\nand the RAF staged a fly-by of sixteen English Electric Lightning\n\nfighters. The state funeral was the largest gathering of\n\ndignitaries in Britain as representatives from over 100 countries\n\nattended, including French President Charles de Gaulle, Canadian\n\nPrime Minister Lester Pearson, Prime Minister of Rhodesia Ian\n\nSmith, other heads of state and government, and members of\n\nroyalty. It also saw the largest assemblage of statesmen in the\n\nworld until the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005.\n\nIt has been suggested it was Churchill's\n\nwish that, were de Gaulle to outlive him, his (Churchill's)\n\nfuneral procession should pass through Waterloo Station. This is\n\ncomplete myth. Though President de Gaulle did attend the service\n\nand the coffin departed for Bladon from Waterloo Station, there\n\nis absolutely no connection. In fact, Churchill did not plan his\n\nown funeral as commonly believed; he made a few suggestions, but\n\nthere was a private committee which made the plans, and he was\n\nnot on it.\n\nAt Churchill's request, he was buried in\n\nthe family plot at St Martin Church, Bladon, near Woodstock, not\n\nfar from his birthplace at Blenheim.\n\nBecause the funeral took place on 30\n\nJanuary, people in the United States marked it by paying tribute\n\nto his friendship with Roosevelt because it was the anniversary\n\nof FDR's birth. The tributes were led by Roosevelt's\n\nchildren.\n\nOn 9 February 1965, Churchill's estate was\n\nprobated at 304,044 pounds sterling (equivalent to about\n\n£3.8m in 2004).\n\nOne of four specially made sets of false\n\nteeth, designed to retain Churchill's distinctive style of\n\nspeech, which Churchill wore throughout his life is now kept in\n\nthe Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons of\n\nEngland.\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.biographyonline.net/politicians/winston_churchill.html\n\nhttp://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/117269/Sir-Winston-Churchill\n\nhttp://translate.google.com/translate?hl=es&langpair=en%7Ces&u=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1953/churchill-bio.html\n\nAuthor: (Latin American\n\nHistorian)"
