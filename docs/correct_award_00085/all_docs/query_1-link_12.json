        "text": "Winston Churchill, a gifted writer, was a master of the English language. He wrote forty-three books that filled seventy-two volumes. Throughout his life, Winston Churchill found the writing of books and articles a means of supporting himself and his family.\n\nChurchill's first book about an uprising in India, The Story of the Malakand Field Force, was published in 1898. About writing, Winston Churchill wrote \"It was great fun writing a book. One lived with it. It became a companion.\"\n\nMany of Winston Churchill's forty-three books are about events of historical importance. To this day, Winston Churchill's reprinted books can still be purchased.\n\nWinston Churchill was bestowed the great honor of winning The Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953.\n\nList of Publications by Winston Churchill\n\nTHE STORY OF THE MALAKAND FIELD FORCE\n\nFirst published by Longmans Green, London: 1898\n\nTHE RIVER WAR\n\nFirst published by Longmans Green, London: 1899 (2vols)\n\nSAVROLA\n\nFirst published by Longmans Green, New York: 1899\n\nLONDON TO LADYSMITH VIA PRETORIA\n\nFirst published by Longmans Green, London: 1900\n\nIAN HAMILTON'S MARCH\n\nFirst published by Longmans Green, London: 1900\n\nMR.
