        "text": "Current Work\n\nMy newest book a biography called \"The Running Away Account: Jessica Mitford in America\" was published by Counterpoint Press in 2010.\n\nOver the course of her long and adventurous life, Jessica Mitford was an investigative journalist, civil rights activist, vivid raconteur and champion of outsiders and underdogs. You find that her admirers and detractors use the same words to describe her: muckraker, subversive, mischief-maker, tease, and nuisance. In a series of literary exposes like \"The American Way of Death, The Trial of Dr. Spock\" (about conspiracy laws during the Vietnam era) and \"Kind and Usual Punishment\" (about the necessity of prison reform) Mitford fearlessly defied authority figures. It was a habit she'd cultivated reaching back to the Thirties, when as the daughter of English aristocrats she'd repudiated wealth and privilege to run away to the Spanish Civil War with Winston Churchill's nephew, Esmond Romilly. The inscription on the Mitford family coat of arms was \"God Careth for Us,\" but embarrass the powerful, mock the hypocrite and shift the complacent were always mottos more to Decca's taste.\n\nProfessional Background\n\nI've published two books. Red Star Sister was published in 1998. It is a memoir. A Motel of the Mind is a collection of lyric essays (some written by me and some by Gary Amdahl). It was published in 2001.\n\nMy memoir Red Star Sister was awarded the 1999 PEN Center USA West prize for Creative Nonfiction. I've been awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship for short fiction, a McKnight Award in Screenwriting, and two Jerome Fellowships in Playwrighting. I've worked as a playwright-in-residence at various theatres, also as a librettist for operas associated with both the Minnesota Opera and the Philadelphia Opera. I was a contributing editor to the literary journal and book review The Hungry Mind Review for eight years and I was the on-staff monthly book columnist for Elle magazine (1998-99). I have also received a Dayton Hudson Grant for literary criticism. I was also a Sundance Fellow in Arts Journalism. I've held International Writing Fellowships at the Camargo Foundation, in France and at Hawthornden in Scotland. In the U.S. I've been in residence as a writing Fellow at the McDowell Colony, Centrum, Yaddo, Ragdale and the Virginia Center for the Arts.\n\nLeslie Brody is a long-time member of the Johnston Center Faculty Advisory Committee."
