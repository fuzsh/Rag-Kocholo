        "text": "Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa has won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2010\n\nAlfred Nobel, the man responsible for the prestigious awards that recognise excellence in various categories, had a specific vision in mind for the winners in the field of literature.\n\n\"The person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction,\" is how Nobel described the awardee.\n\nLet's take a look at some lesser known facts related to the distinguished authors who have won the Nobel Prize in literature\n\n...\n\nTill date, 102 Nobel Prizes have been awarded in literature. But no awards were given for seven years: 1914, 1918, 1935, 1940, 1941, 1942, and 1943.\n\nWhy? Because the Nobel Foundation clearly states, 'If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation's restricted funds.'\n\n...\n\nRudyard Kipling, author of the The Jungle Book, was the youngest recipient of the award. He was only 42 years old when he received the award in 1907.\n\nThe Nobel Prize was awarded to Kipling 'in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author'.\n\n...\n\nDoris Lessing, who won the Nobel in 2007, was the oldest author to do so. The British author was 88 years old when she won the Nobel Prize.\n\nShe was described by the Swedish Academy as 'that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny'.\n\nOnly 12 female authors have won the Nobel Prize in literature so far. They include illustrious names like Toni Morrison, Pearl Buck, Nadine Gordimer and, of course, Lessing.\n\n...\n\nOnly two people have declined the Nobel Prize in literature so far.\n\nBoris Pasternak, who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1958, accepted the award first. But the authorities in Soviet Union made the Russian author give up the Nobel Prize\n\nJean Paul Sartre, who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1964, declined the prize because he had 'consistently declined all official honours.'\n\n..."
