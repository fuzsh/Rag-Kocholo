Giulio Mongeri was one of the architects prominent in architectural activities both in the last years of Ottoman Empire and first years of the Republic and undertook an effective role in the architectural understanding of the next generation by raising the architects of the future as an instructor of the Academy of Fine Arts. In the study, it is aimed to gain especially the sketches and photos obtained from his diary and not published anywhere else to the scientific world as a new contribution to the knowledge in the available publications. Giulio Mongeri himself, his family and environs in which he was raised, his personality and attitude as a trainer have been appraised in the light of new information. The buildings of Mongeri in Ankara have been studied comparatively with the other buildings in Ankara in this period and an attempt is made to assess the differences in his approach.\n\nTra storia e leggenda. Indagini sul network artistico tra Sofonisba Anguissola, Giulio Clovio e Levina Teerlinc\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnnemie Leemans\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The article explores the relation between two miniature painters: the Croatian Giulio Clovio and the Fleming Levina Teerlinc. The starting point of this research is a letter written in the 1540s, which is written by Annibal Caro in name of Giulio Clovio. The letter is addressed to a young nameless female miniature painter. This female miniature painter can be identified as Levina Teerlinc because of a corresponding characteristics and profile. The focal point of this letter is an exchange of self-portraits between Clovio and the female painter. Proof that it is Levina Teerlinc who sends Clovio her self-portrait is to be found in the testament of the Croatian artist, that reminds Â«il ritratto di Livinia meniatriceÂ» or Â«the portrait of Livinia miniature painterÂ».Historiography connected the event to the portrait of Giulio Clovio, painted by the hand of Sofonisba Anguissola. In this portrait the Croatian is depicted with a portrait miniature in his hand. Federico Zeri, owner of the portrait until 1998, believed that the miniature portrayed Levina Teerlinc. This present article argues that the miniature is a self-portrait of Sofonisba Anguissola. Evidence for this can be found in another portrait of this painter of Cremona. In the portrait of her master Bernardino Campi, Anguissola depicts Campi in the action of painting her portrait, which essentially is a self-portrait. In both paintings, the master paints a portrait of his pupil Sofonsiba: Bernardino Campi is her master for painting, while Giulio Clovio is her master for miniature painting. Clovio, just like Campi, is depicted in the act of painting, with the brush in his hand and his eye focussed on the viewer. Further, the article describes exhaustively the provenance of the portrait of Clovio. It particularly emphasises the typology of headgear the miniature painter wears and compares it with a similar sample worn by a contemporary Englishman. Finally, this study proposes to give some\n\nConference on Statistical Science Honouring the Bicentennial of Stefano Franscini's Birth\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nMorgenthaler, Stephan; Ronchetti, Elvezio\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe Conference on \"Statistical Science\", held in Monte Verita (Switzerland) on 18/20 November 1996, was intended to honour the memory of Stefano Franscini at the occasion of the bicentennial of his birth (1796-1996). It was jointly organized by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the University of Geneva. These proceedings gather a selected collection of contributions presented by statisticians from universities, research institutes and national statistical services of Europe, North America and Asia. Part I focuses on a historical appreciation of Stefano Franscini's life and work. Authors develop a deep analysis of the historical context, the political action, the scientific achievement and the intellectual legacy of the founding father of Swiss official statistics. The reader thus has an opportunity to appreciate the various facets of this exceptional man who not only drew the first comprehensive statistical portrait of Switzerland but also establis...\n\nGiulio Angioni's Assandira: The Art of Writing in Between the Furrows\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarlo Maxia\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Il lavoro di Giulio Angioni si Ã¨ mosso costantemente tra antropologia e letteratura. I due campi permettono di cogliere livelli elevati di complessitÃ e di profonditÃ su tematiche talvolta comuni. Ã il caso di Assandira e dei testi scientifici dedicati al lavoro agropastorale. Nel romanzo lâantropologo mette in scena aspetti particolari della cultura, con una forte presenza delle emozioni, evanescenti e contradditorie.

The major emphasis, however, is on modern results in stability theory and its application in the theory of control and numerics. In particular, stability of the following problems is treated: linear, nonlinear and time-dependent systems, discretizations of ordinary and partial differential equations, systems with time delay on multidimensional systems. In addition robust stability, pole placement and problems related to the stability radius are treated. The book is an outgrowth of the international conference \"Centennial Hurwitz on Stability Theory\" which was held to honor Adolf Hurwitz, whose artiÂ­ cle on the location of roots of a polynomial was published one hundred years ago. The conference took place at the Centro Stefano Franscini, Monte Verita, Ascona, Switzerland, on May 21~26, 1995.

Interview with Prof. Giulio Giorello\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSilvia Peppoloni\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Prof. Giulio Giorello is amongst the most prominent philosophers of science in Italy and in the world. He is currently Professor of the Philosophy of Science at the University of Milan, Director of the Series âScience and Ideasâ (Raffaele Cortina Books Editor, and Literary Journalist of the cultural pages of the Corriere della Sera, one of the most important of the Italian newspapers. In this keynote presentation, in interview form, he talks about the value that the Earth sciences have had through history, framing this group of disciplines in ethical and epistemological terms, and highlighting some important elements that have to be considered in geological activities.\n\nCibo e scrittura nei romanzi di Stefano Benni\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFrancesca Nava\n\n2015-07-01\n\nÂ In his nearly forty-year-career, Stefano Benni published a large number of works, each of which is deeply different from one another: all of them are hardly analyzable for their complexity not so much from a quality as from a quantity point of view, because his whole framework is based on the rhetorical device of adiectio. Therefore, it is very useful to analyze the author's works with an intertextual perspective, whose peak is represented by the food theme. Starting from this assumption, it is possible to undertake a textual analysis of his novels, both focused on stylistic features and organized according to a functional standpoint which allows to understand the different uses of the food in the authorâs novels: a hint for the authorâs imagination, a social pointer, a metaphor, a frame to the charactersâ qualities.\n\nEuridice by Giulio Caccini: Two (? Copies of the Original Score Held in the Cathedral of Ljubljana around 1620\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMetoda Kokole\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available LâEuridice, composta in musica in stile rappresentativo by Giulio Caccini (1551â1618 is considered the first fully preserved and printed opera in music history. It was composed in 1600 to the libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini, itself commissioned for the wedding celebrations of Maria de Medici and her spouse, the French king Henry IV. The score was printed in 1600 in Florence and dedicated to Count Giovanni Bardi; in 1615 it was reprinted in Venice, but without the dedication. In fact, Caccini had not been commissioned to write the music for that occasion: in 1600 the official composer of the opera EuridiceÂ had been Jacopo Peri, whose version, with approximately one sixth of Cacciniâs music â the parts sung by Cacciniâs family members, including Euridiceâs part â was performed in Florence on 6 October 1600. At this hybrid performance, parts of Giulio Cacciniâs opera were heard for the first time. The only known full staging of Cacciniâs opera took place on 5 December 1602 at Palazzo Pitti in Florence to honour Cardinal Montalto. It entertained the noble public for two hours. Considering the simplicity and shortness of the extant score, the performance cannot have been a simple one: it would have included repetitions, dances, and other unwritten additions. In the tradition of humanist Florentine circles, Ottavio Rinucciniâs libretto follows one of the most famous classical myths â the story of the divine singer Orpheus, which was particularly appropriate for a first attempt to resurrect the classical tragedy, believed to have been entirely sung. Yet Rinuccini was inspired not only by Ovidâs and Virgilâs narratives of the myth but also by Angelo Polizianoâs Favola di Orfeo and some other, earlier Renaissance sources. Thee story itself was partly changed and adapted to the occasion of an important state marriage, a common practice in later operatic texts as well. It tells only the first part of the myth, centred on the\n\nAn Italian Architectâs First Visit to Ankara: Giulio Mongeri â 1897\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSedat BornovalÄ±\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Giulio Mongeri is an Italian architect credited as behind some of the most important structures all across Turkey, but foremost in Istanbul and Ankara. He served the Ottoman state in the first quarter of the 20th century, and provided a noteworthy contribution to Ankara in the Early Republican era. Mongeri carried out his first visit to Ankara in 1897. His observations of the era are extremely interesting. Mongeriâs notes on this visit were published over a few weeks in the 25th volume of Illustrazione Italiana journal, which rarely sees daylight nowadays and is barely spoken of in the Ankara research literature. As a contribution to Turkish publications about Ankara, this study aims to evaluate this visit and compare it from various perspectives to other publications and the Ankara of today.First of all, new digital imaging was carried out in place of the low-resolution digitalized copies published by the Italian Ministry of Culture and Tourism, then a field examination of Mongeriâs route was carried out, and following study comparing this to historical sources, it was made ready for detailed investigations to be carried out by later researchers. On certain issues, Mongeri was not well informed, but on many others his deep interest in history emerges thanks to the education he had received in Milan. These travel notes may catch the eye as showing from an earlier age the basics of the historicist approach he would take in his professional life as a historian..\n\nStefano Jacoviello, \"La rivincita di Orfeo. Esperienza estetica e semiotica del discorso musicale\", Mimesis Edizioni, Milano â Udine, 2012\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuca Marconi\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFull Text Available A partire dagli scritti di Roman Jakobson, Nicolas Ruwet, Jean-Jacques Nattiez e Gino Stefani, la relazione tra la semiotica e la musica Ã¨ stata spesso affrontata da numerosi studiosi che anche oggi praticano, specie in Canada, in Finlandia e in Italia, la disciplina chiamata âsemiotica (o semiologia della musicaâ. Negli ultimi anni, in questo ambito spesso si Ã¨ preferito realizzare studi su alcuni problemi specifici piuttosto che concentrarsi su una teorizzazione generale. Al contrario, Stefano Jacoviello, dopo aver pubblicato brevi saggi di carattere prevalentemente analitico, in questo volume, di ampio respiro teorico, presenta una sorta di manifesto teso a rilanciare, specie in Italia, il ruolo della âsemiotica del discorso musicaleâ come disciplina particolarmente adatta ad affrontare questioni teoriche generali.\n\nCataloging, analysis and communication of urban modifications. The glimpse of the washhouse of Borgo SolestÃ in Ascoli Piceno from the art collection of Giulio Gabrielli\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlessandra Meschini\n\n2012-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The detection of forms of growth in the use of the Cultural Heritage by the a large community, has established, in its valorisation process, the need of characterising the intent of popularising the knowledge, with methods able to set involving communication channels and more comprehensible contents. As regard to this picture and in occasion of a collaboration with the Pinacoteca Civica of Ascoli Piceno, the contribution intends to relate to the results of some studies oriented to investigate the opportunity of reading the transformation happened in the â800s of some urban glimpses of Ascoli Piceno, through the artistic production of the painter Giulio Gabrielli from Ascoli. Starting from a traditional work of analysis, cataloging and comparison of iconography and historic cartography, aimed at verifying the reliability of the urban modifications depicted by the artist, the process ended up investigating the opportunities offered by the technological methods of 3D animation, directed to the communication of such documentary value.\n\nCritical Issues and Key Points from the Survey to the Creation of the Historical Building Information Model: the Case of Santo Stefano Basilica\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCastagnetti, C.; Dubbini, M.; Ricci, P. C.; Rivola, R.; Giannini, M.; Capra, A.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe new era of designing in architecture and civil engineering applications lies in the Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach, based on a 3D geometric model including a 3D database. This is easier for new constructions whereas, when dealing with existing buildings, the creation of the BIM is based on the accurate knowledge of the as-built construction. Such a condition is allowed by a 3D survey, often carried out with laser scanning technology or modern photogrammetry, which are able to guarantee an adequate points cloud in terms of resolution and completeness by balancing both time consuming and costs with respect to the request of final accuracy. The BIM approach for existing buildings and even more for historical buildings is not yet a well known and deeply discussed process. There are still several choices to be addressed in the process from the survey to the model and critical issues to be discussed in the modeling step, particularly when dealing with unconventional elements such as deformed geometries or historical elements. The paper describes a comprehensive workflow that goes through the survey and the modeling, allowing to focus on critical issues and key points to obtain a reliable BIM of an existing monument. The case study employed to illustrate the workflow is the Basilica of St. Stefano in Bologna (Italy), a large monumental complex with great religious, historical and architectural assets.\n\nIl mito di Ulisse nel romanzo del secondo Novecento: il tragico e lâantitragico in Stefano DâArrigo e Walter Jens\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNora Moll\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available In Twentieth Centuryâs Literature, the various declinations and rewritings of the Odysseusâ theme were conducted both in the tragic and the anti-tragic mode: the latter involving often, but not necessarily, the use of narrative strategies of parody. Referring to Hans Blumenberg (1979, we can speak of a constant âwork on mythâ that goes hand in hand with the development of postmodern poetics and elaboration of history, characterized by different narrative styles and strategies depending on the literary and cultural context in which they are inserted. Starting from one of the main theories about literary rewriting, as well as about mythopoetic and mythocritical discourse in twentieth century, this article aims to examine in a comparative perspective two novels, conceived almost at the same time in the Fifties, even if published separated by a distance of years. This is the \"Mediterranean\" novel Hocynus Orca (1975, by the Sicilian Stefano D'Arrigo, and Das Testament des Odysseus (1957, by the German writer Walter Jens, who is also known for his theoretical work on Greek mythology and tragedy. In these novels both authors choose the odyssean hypotext for liaising with the difficult legacy of World War II, but also to express its positioning in the contemporary world. The need to \"complete\" (Blumenberg the myth of Ulysses thus produces in D'Arrigo a reinterpretation of the novel in the epic and tragic way, while Jens escapes to the anti-tragic modus offering to its anti-hero a secondary way out from his own myth.\n\nJournal of Genetics | Indian Academy of Sciences\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nHome; Journals; Journal of Genetics.

The pressure induced spin transition of Fe-bearing MgO and MgSiO3 are detected often by using high-resolution K-edge X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) [1,2,3] and confirmed by theoretical simulations. [4,5] Since the Fe K-edge XES is associated to the 3p orbital, which is far from the valence orbitals (3d and 4s), it provides no information about its coordination environments. However, the Fe L-edge XES and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can directly present the distribution and intensity of Fe-3d character. To identify both the spin states and the coordination environments of iron-bearing MgSiO3, we systematically investigate the L-edge XAS, XES and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy of Fe2+- and Fe3+-bearing MgSiO3 under high pressure by using the first-principles density functional method combined with the slater-transition method. Our results show that Fe2+ and Fe3+ can be distinguished easily by taking the XPS spectra. The spin transition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ can also be clearly certified by XAS and XES. Interestingly, the broadness of L-edge XES of Fe changes depending on the iron position, meaning that its coordination environment might also be distinguishable by using high-resolution XES measurements.

He was possibly the son of Abraham Usque typographer of the Ferrara Bible (1553 written in ladino. We have evidence of his passing through Venice between 1560 and 1567, alternating stays in Constantinople, the Ottoman capital where he probably died. We owe to SalomÃ³n Usque the translation of Petrarch's Canzoniere into Spanish, published by NicolÃ² Bevilacqua in Venice in 1567. Usque is the author of the tragedy titled LâEster arranged in 1619 by Leone Modena. He also wrote poetry in Italian. Among the manuscripts of the FerrarÃ­an codex N.A. 5 belonging to the Biblioteca Ariostea there is a laudatory canzone addressed to Guidobaldo II Montefeltro (1514-1574, the Duke of Urbino, which is edited for the first time in the present article. The distribution of encyclopedic content reminds the distant source of St. Isidore of Seville, but there are some analogies with the poem Las siete edades del mundo written by Pablo de Santa Maria (born around 1350- 1435, a Spaniard converted Jew.\n\nSalomÃ³n Usque era hijo de judÃ­os portugueses que la diÃ¡spora llevÃ³ a Ferrara. Fue tal vez hijo de Abraham Usque, tipÃ³grafo de la Biblia de Ferrara en ladino (1553.

The article aims to analyze how the bookâs main character, during his loneliness, reminisces about events from his past. And because the novel is set in the Baroque, RobertoÂ´s memories respect the spirit of that time : numerous flashbacks are evoked by unexpected metaphors that link very distant things. The ship, which is for a young man a cumbersome prison, becomes a real Theatre of Memory, according to Giulio Camilloâs idea.\n\nBaccio del Bianco and the Cultural Politics of the Medici Court\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIoana MÄgureanu\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Baccio del Biancoâs career, an artist with a polyvalent education and multiple talents, is examined in the light of the artistic politics dominant in Florence in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, as a result of a cultural programme carefully coordinated by the Medici court: a clear emphasis on the manual, productive aspect of the arts, and on the âapplied arts,â and a close connection between the artistic domain and the scientific one.

Tra fascino della storia e fascino delle storie\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlice Bencivenni\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Thanks to Aristotle Detective, set in fourth century Athens, Margaret Doody realizes her assumption about the Hellenistic beginnings of the Novel. Two heroes, the historical Aristotle and Stefanos, a fictional former pupil of the Lyceum, act as forerunners of the couple Sherlock Holmes/Watson in the year 332 B.C. The juridical framework of the plot fits ancient sources about Greek institutions. Clues to the resolution of the murder puzzle are chosen from archaeological evidence. Vases and inscriptions, deceiving story characters and modern readers, help Aristotle to come out of the maze.\n\nIl processo Andreotti.

Meyerâs 'GÃ¶ttliche Komodie'\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nG. Oberprieler\n\n1989-05-01\n\nFull Text Available The harmonious, almost idyllic ending of C.F. Meyerâs last completed novella Angela Borgia must seem surprising in the context of his prose work as a whole. It is believed to reflect the intensified desire of the ageing and sickly poet to find a small livable âparadiseâ in this world, based on Christian values. Manâs possible redemption and moral development are shown in the person of Giulio in strong parallel with Danteâs way to heavenly Paradise in the Divine Comedy. The fundamental difference between the two works lies, however, in the fact that the realist Meyer at the end of the 19th Century transfers Danteâs poetic vision of the hereafter not only to this world, but to a large extent to the physical sphere within man himself.\n\nA case of Paget from a Northern Italy medieval necropolis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRossetti, Chiara; Pasquinelli, Lidia; Verzeletti, Andrea; Armocida, Giuseppe; Licata, Marta; Fulcheri, Ezio\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAn excavation conducted in 2002 by the Lombardy Archaeological Heritage in the St. Giulio Church (Cassano Magnago-Northern Italy) revealed an adult skeleton with an important alteration of the left femur. The femur, longer than the contralateral, exhibited an expansion of the full diaphysis; the surface was coarsened and porous. In cross section, it appeared that almost all the cortical bone had been converted into cancellous bone. Macroscopic and radiological alterations are suggestive of the monostotic form of Paget's disease, a chronic disorder, characterized by focal areas of excessive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by a secondary increase in osteoblastic bone formation. Differential diagnosis is complex for Paget's disease, requiring histological analysis, which revealed a thickened and disorganized trabecular pattern with thick cement lines. Such features, resembling to a mosaic pattern, are typical of Paget's disease. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

He was also a member of a new generation of anatomists. They had continued the tradition of the most famous Italian scientists, which started from the Renaissance up until the nineteenth century. Although he carried out important studies of neuroanatomy and comparative anatomy, as well as embryology, his name is rarely remembered by most medical historians. His name is linked to the nucleus he discovered: the Staderini nucleus or intercalated nucleus, a collection of nerve cells in the medulla oblongata located lateral to the hypoglossal nucleus. This article focuses on the biography of the neuroanatomist as well as the nucleus that carries his name and his other research, especially on comparative anatomy and embryology.\n\nINFN-Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati School on the Attractor Mechanism 2009\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n4th School on Attractor Mechanism : Supersymmetric Gravity and Black Holes\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis book is based upon lectures presented in the summer of 2009 at the INFN-Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati School on Attractor Mechanism, directed by Stefano Bellucci.

A careful study of both comedias shows a deep intertextual relationship between the play by Lope and the Comedia de Miseno, discovered by Stefano Arata. The Comedia de Miseno was written at the end of the 16th century by Loyola, an almost unknown author. This paper also shows the influence of the ejemplo XXV from El conde Lucanor on the Comedia de Miseno. At the same time, it rejects the direct influence of the ejemplo XXV on La pobreza estimada, as previously thought by critics.\n\nPermuted tRNA genes of Cyanidioschyzon merolae, the origin of the tRNA molecule and the root of the Eukarya domain.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDi Giulio, Massimo\n\n2008-08-07\n\nAn evolutionary analysis is conducted on the permuted tRNA genes of Cyanidioschyzon merolae, in which the 5' half of the tRNA molecule is codified at the 3' end of the gene and its 3' half is codified at the 5' end. This analysis has shown that permuted genes cannot be considered as derived traits but seem to possess characteristics that suggest they are ancestral traits, i.e. they originated when tRNA molecule genes originated for the first time. In particular, if the hypothesis that permuted genes are a derived trait were true, then we should not have been able to observe that the most frequent class of permuted genes is that of the anticodon loop type, for the simple reason that this class would derive by random permutation from a class of non-permuted tRNA genes, which instead is the rarest. This would not explain the high frequency with which permuted tRNA genes with perfectly separate 5' and 3' halves were observed. Clearly the mechanism that produced this class of permuted genes would envisage the existence, in an advanced stage of evolution, of minigenes codifying for the 5' and 3' halves of tRNAs which were assembled in a permuted way at the origin of the tRNA molecule, thus producing a high frequency of permuted genes of the class here referred. Therefore, this evidence supports the hypothesis that the genes of the tRNA molecule were assembled by minigenes codifying for hairpin-like RNA molecules, as suggested by one model for the origin of tRNA [Di Giulio, M., 1992. On the origin of the transfer RNA molecule. J. Theor. Biol. 159, 199-214; Di Giulio, M., 1999. The non-monophyletic origin of tRNA molecule. J. Theor. Biol. 197, 403-414]. Moreover, the late assembly of the permuted genes of C. merolae, as well as their ancestrality, strengthens the hypothesis of the polyphyletic origins of these genes. Finally, on the basis of the uniqueness and the ancestrality of these permuted genes, I suggest that the root of the Eukarya domain is in the super\n\nModelling and Accuracy in a Bim Environment for Planned Conservation: the Apartment of Troia of Giulio Romano\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAdami, A.; Scala, B.; Spezzoni, A.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nModeling of Cultural Heritage in a BIM environment, and in general of existing buildings, requires special attention because there are two diametrically opposed possibilities. On the one hand the attempt is to realize a very complex and accurate model, in order to provide the most comprehensive representation of the architecture as possible. The opposite position leads to build a very schematic and symbolic model of as-built architecture. It is not easy to determine which is the right balance between these two attitudes because each architecture requires a personalized approach and not standards. It's, however, necessary to find rules to figure out which items are represented, what is the minimum level of detail to consider adequate and how to deal with alterations from simple and linear geometries. These two facing possibilities deal with different goals and tools. In the field of restoration or planned conservation, that is the most common approach for existing buildings, the attention focuses on the exceptions and particularities of each architecture: the important aspect is to understand and describe exactly each part as a singularity (as it is). In this context it is very difficult to find a standard or a common solution. The first possibility of modelling seems to be very close to this approach, but it clashes with two important aspects. A first problem concerns the modelling software. Usually commercial BIM modelling software doesn't allow to realize very complex and high detailed solutions. They prefer working with predefined families and try to categorize each element in standard solution. The possibility to build new families is expected, but it often requires a lot of time. The second difficulty is the real efficiency of such an accurate model. In fact, it could be very difficult to link external elements to the model or use it in many traditional BIM applications. In this paper, we suggest another possible approach that represents the first result of a research about the modelling of Cultural Heritage for BIM application. The proposed solution aims to give as much information as possible about the architecture, and, at the same time, to guarantee a higher efficiency. In this case we considered commercial BIM software like Revit or Archicad. They are the most widespread and well-known software BIM oriented and they also allow the use of their embedded database structure. The core of our solution is to describe the architecture not only by a 3D model but also by the representation of the reliability of the accuracy of the model itself. In this way we try to combine the necessity of working with commercial software, in which it is difficult to be very accurate, and the information about the real object. In historical complex architecture, for example, it is very difficult to find a straight and planar wall. It is quite difficult, or at least time consuming, to model that kind of wall with high accuracy. But it is possible to represent the real wall by a schematic wall with a false color map which describes where the 3D model is well fitting and where there are some differences. In this way we don't lose any information but, at the same time, we have a very usable BIM model.\n\nNew insights on the petrology of submarine volcanics from the Western Pontine Archipelago (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nConte, A. M.; Perinelli, C.; Bianchini, G.; Natali, C.; Martorelli, E.; Chiocci, F. L.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe Pontine Islands form a volcanic archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It consists of two edifices, the islands of Ponza, Palmarola and Zannone and the islands of Ventotene and Santo Stefano, respectively. The Archipelago developed during two main volcanic cycles in the Plio-Pleistocene: 1) the Pliocene episode erupted subalkaline, silica-rich volcanic units, which constitute the dominant products in the western edifice (Ponza and Zannone Islands); 2) the Pleistocene episode erupted more alkaline products, represented by evolved rocks (trachytes to peralkaline rhyolites) in the islands of Ponza and Palmarola and by basic to intermediate rocks in the eastern edifice (Ventotene and Santo Stefano Islands). In this paper we present new geochemical and petrological data from submarine rock samples collected in two oceanographic cruises and a scuba diving survey. The main result is the recovery of relatively undifferentiated lithotypes that provide further insights on the magmatic spectrum existing in the Pontine Archipelago, allowing modelling of the whole suite of rocks by fractional crystallization processes. New major and trace element data and thermodynamic constrains (by the software PELE) indicate the existence of three distinct evolutionary trends corresponding to a HK calcalkaline series in the Pliocene, followed by a transitional and then by a shoshonite series in the Pleistocene. In particular, the transitional series, so far overlooked in the literature, is required in order to explain the genesis of several peralkaline felsic rocks recognized in the Archipelago. On the whole, the new geochemical data i) confirm the orogenic signature of the suites, ii) allow to rule out an anatectic origin for both subalkaline and peralkaline rhyolites and iii) indicate highly heterogeneous mantle sources, due to crustal components variously recycled in the mantle via subduction.\n\nINFN-Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati School 2011\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBlack objects in supergravity\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis is the sixth volume in a series of books on the general topics of supersymmetry, supergravity, black holes and the attractor mechanism.

Buthayna Eilouti and Amer Al-Jokhadar address patterns in shape grammars in the ground plans of Mamluk madrasas, religious schools. Giulio Magli goes back further in history, to the age of Greek colonies in Italy before they were conquered by the Romans, to examine patterns in urban design. In Traditional Patterns in Pyrgi of Chios: Mathematics and Community Charoula Stathopoulou examines the geometric patterns that decorate the buildings of the town of Pyrgi, on the Greek island of Chios. Curve Fitting is a study of ways to construct a function so that its graph most closely approximates the pattern given by a set of points.

While human intellectual activity was said to be 'above time' during the Middle Ages, Renaissance scholars such as Marcantonio Genua (1491-1563), Giulio Castellani (1528-1586), Antonio Montecatini (1537-1599) and Francesco Piccolomini (1520-1604), greatly influenced by the Simplician and Alexandrist interpretations of Aristotle's works, proposed alterna- tive conceptions based on the interpretation of De anima 3.6 (430b 7-20) according to which intellectual acts happen in a both 'undivided' and 'divisible time'. In order to explain Aristotle's puzzling claim, they were led to conceive of intellectual activity as a process similar to sensation, corresponding to a certain lapse of time (Castellani), an instant (Montecatini), or a mix of instantaneousness and concrete duration (Piccolomini), depending on their theoretical options.\n\n2 AngÃ©licos: Argan e Didi-Huberman.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJoÃ£o CÃ­cero Teixeira Bezerra\n\nFull Text Available Resumo O presente artigo apresenta dois perfis criados para Fra Angelico por dois historiadores da arte, Giulio Carlo Argan e Georges Didi-Huberman.

However, isotopic analyses on algae showed that the gamma-ray emitting artificial radionuclides that one might expect to leak from a damaged nuclear reactor (such as U-235, I-131, Cs-137) were absent, and that U-238/U-234 activities were in equilibrium with values typical of sea water; this excluded any direct anthropogenic contamination as a result of the accident. We used alpha autoradiographic techniques to detect possible traces of transuranium radionuclides; 160 samples of algae, granites, sea urchins, gastropods, limpets, cuttlefish and jellyfish were collected from the area, as well as from other Mediterranean coastlines and the Baltic Sea. All samples were autoradiographed, and selected samples further analysed by alpha spectrometry. There were no alpha track concentrations above background levels in our control Mediterranean specimens. In the samples from the La Maddalena and Baltic areas two different track distributions were observed:-those homogeneously distributed over the surfaces examined; -groups (10 to over 500) of radially distributed alpha tracks (forming 'star' bursts, or 'hot spots') emanating from point sources. By comparing radionuclide activities measured by alpha spectroscopy with alpha track densities, we extrapolated Pu activities for all samples. About 74% of algae had Pu activities of less than 1Bq/kg and 0.25Bq/kg, 16% had accumulated Pu to levels between 1 and 2Bq/kg, and a very few specimens had concentrations between 2 and 6Bq/kg. Plots showed that alpha tracks and stars concentrate around the northern and eastern margins of the Rada (Basin) di Santo Stefano, sites facing the nuclear submarine base on the eastern shore of the island of Santo Stefano. What is the source of these nuclides: last century's atmospheric nuclear testing, Chernobyl or\n\nDiscovery or invention? The difference between art and communication according to Ernst Gombrich\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTiziana Migliore\n\n2011-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper sets out to explore the boundaries between artworks and advertising works in line with the thinking of Ernst Gombrich. His distinction between art and other forms of communication emphasises the importance of âdiscoveryâ as opposed to mere âinventionâ. What are the symptoms of an artwork according to Gombrich? The difference with advertising is not ontological at all: anything that comes out of the artistâs top hat and is traded between dealers, gallery owners and collectors is art, whereas any graphic work produced for communication purposes and conveyed by the media is propaganda. Ultimately the most valid distinction lies in the modality and the internal dynamics of the artwork itself. By re-examining some examples provided by Gombrich â from the colour of light in John Constable to Giulio Romanoâs Palazzo Te, from Raphaelâs Madonna della sedia to Saul Steinbergâs work â this paper delves further into an issue not comprehensively dealt with by Gombrich and whose importance is still underestimated.\n\nJulius Caesar Arantius (Giulio Cesare Aranzi, 1530-1589) and the hippocampus of the human brain: history behind the discovery.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBir, Shyamal C; Ambekar, Sudheer; Kukreja, Sunil; Nanda, Anil\n\n2015-04-01\n\nJulius Caesar Arantius is one of the pioneer anatomists and surgeons of the 16th century who discovered the different anatomical structures of the human body. One of his prominent discoveries is the hippocampus. At that time, Arantius originated the term hippocampus, from the Greek word for seahorse (hippos [\"horse\"] and kampos [\"sea monster\"]). Arantius published his description of the hippocampus in 1587, in the first chapter of his work titled De Humano Foetu Liber. Numerous nomenclatures of this structure, including \"white silkworm,\" \"Ammon's horn,\" and \"ram's horn\" were proposed by different scholars at that time. However, the term hippocampus has become the most widely used in the literature.\n\nPhotocatalysis\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBignozzi, Carlo Alberto (ed.) [Ferrara Univ.

An underestimation of the clay fraction measured by LDM was obtained with respect to the SHM and a set of equations useful to refer laser diffraction measurements to SHM was calibrated using the measurements carried out for 635 soil samples. Finally, the proposed equations were tested using independent measurements carried out by LDM and SHM for 112 soil samples with a different texture classification.\n\n18 December 2012 - British University of Edinburgh Principal T.

As one of the most important achievements in the field of catalysis, macromolecular science and polymer materials, their inventors were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 âfor their discoveries in the field of chemistry and technology of high polymersâ. These discoveries have stimulated an intensive, both basic and applied research all over the world, up to the present times, leading to great development of the polymer industry. The important biographical data and scientific advancements of K. Ziegler and G. Natta are presented as well. Karl Ziegler, a German scientist, Director of Max Planck Institute for Coal Research in MÃ¼lheim, besides many scientific achievements, in 1953 discovered a new process for the polymerization of ethylene into linear polyethylene under mild conditions by using titanium chloride and alkyl aluminium catalytic system that was superior to all existing polymerization. Giulio Natta, an Italian scientist, Director of the Department of Industrial Chemistry at Polytechnic, University of Milan, besides many achievements in petrochemical processes, in 1954 obtained for the first time isotactic polypropylene and Montecatini Co. started its production already in 1958. He conducted pioneering studies on the chain microstructure of synthetic organic polymers and postulated the mechanisms of stereospecific polymerizations. Since the discovery of the Zeigler-Natta catalyst, stereospecific polymerization and processes, significant developments have occurred. The breakthrough in polymerization processes such as fluid bed, liquid phase loop reactor and reactor granule technology led to significant development and growth of polyolefin production.

Especially in the elderly, hearing loss can impair the exchange of information, thus significantly impacting everyday life, causing loneliness, isolation, dependence, and frustration, as well as communication disorders. Due to the aging of the population in the developed world, presbycusis is a growing problem that has been reported to reduce quality of life (QoL. Progression of presbycusis cannot be remediated; therefore, optimal management of this condition not only requires early recognition and rehabilitation, but it also should include an evaluation of QoL status and its assessment.Keywords: hearing loss, presbycusis, quality of life, elderly\n\nMasonry structures between mechanics and architecture\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPedemonte, Orietta; Williams, Kim\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis book provides an overview of state of the art research in the mechanics of masonry structures. It continues the series Between Mechanics and Architecture, initially launched in 1995 from the collaboration of several renowned scholars, including Edoardo Benvenuto and Patricia Radelet-de Grave. Â The contributions in this volume represent the main approaches to the complex topic of masonry structures. In addition to historical studies, the mechanical behavior of masonry arches and structures is studied using different approaches (structural analysis, limit analysis, elastic analysis, plasticity, mathematical approaches, etc.), at times difficult to reconcile, at others intertwined and complementary.

Biochemical studies from several laboratories have implicated C75 as the general acid and hydrated magnesium as the general base. We have previously shown that C75 has a pKa shifted > 2 pH units toward neutrality [Gong, B., Chen, J. H., Chase, E., Chadalavada, D. M., Yajima, R., Golden, B. L., Bevilacqua, P. C., and Carey, P. R. (2007) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129, 13335â13342.], while in crystal structures, it is well-positioned for proton transfer. However no crystallographic evidence for a hydrated magnesium poised to serve as a general base in the reaction has been observed in high-resolution crystal structures of various reaction states and mutants. Herein, we use solution kinetic experiments and parallel Raman crystallographic studies to examine the effects of pH on rate and Mg2+-binding properties of wild-type and 7-deazaguanosine mutants of the HDV ribozyme. These data suggest that a previously-unobserved hydrated magnesium ion interacts with the N7 of the cleavage site Gâ¢U wobble base pair. Integrating this metal ion binding site with the available crystal structures provides a new three-dimensional model for the active site of the ribozyme that accommodates all available biochemical data and appears competent for catalysis. The position of this metal is consistent with a role of a magnesium-bound hydroxide as a general base as dictated by biochemical data.

Major theories of consciousness make distinct predictions about the role of PFC, providing an opportunity to arbitrate between these views empirically. Here we address three common misconceptions: (1) PFC lesions do not affect subjective perception; (2) PFC activity does not reflect specific perceptual content; and (3) PFC involvement in studies of perceptual awareness is solely driven by the need to make reports required by the experimental tasks rather than subjective experience per se. These claims are incompatible with empirical findings, unless one focuses only on studies using methods with limited sensitivity. The literature highlights PFC's essential role in enabling the subjective experience in perception, contra the objective capacity to perform visual tasks; conflating the two can also be a source of confusion.

Moreover, due to their ability to cross cellular membranes, their nanosize dimension, high surface area and relatively good biocompatibility, CNTs have also been employed as a novel gene delivery vector system. In our previous work, we functionalized CNTs with two polyamine polymers, polyethyleneimine (PEI and polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM. These compounds have low cytotoxicity, ability to conjugate microRNAs (such as miR-503 and, at the same time, transfect efficiently endothelial cells. The parameters contributing to the good efficiency of transfection that we observed were not investigated in detail. In fact, the diameter and length of CNTs are important parameters to be taken into account when evaluating the effects on drug delivery efficiency. In order to investigate the biophysical and biological contributions of polymer-coated CNTs in delivery of miRNAs to human cells, we decided to investigate three different preparations, characterized by different dimensions and aspect ratios. In particular, we took into account very small CNTs, a suspension of CNTs starting from the commercial product and a 2D material based on CNTs (ie, buckypapers [BPs] to examine the\n\nCERNâs job diversity on display at the CitÃ© des MÃ©tiers\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCorinne Pralavorio\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFrom 3 to 8 November, CERN took part in the CitÃ© des MÃ©tiers careers fair in Geneva.

Evaluations of mood state and sleep quality were performed up to 60 minutes before national and international sports competitions began. Descriptive and inferential statistics (including logistic regression) were used to evaluate the relationship of sleep quality and mood states with performance (i.e., winning or losing). Athletes typically had good sleep quality and mood states similar to the Iceberg profile (i.e., high vigor and low tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and mental confusion). The Wald test revealed that sleep, anger, tension, and vigor predicted athletes' performance. Specifically, poor sleep quality and low vigor and anger decreased the odds of winning, whereas higher tension increased these odds. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated that the results were sufficiently generalizable. Overall, we observed a significant relationship between sleep and mood states, which in turn both significantly influenced athletes' sports performance. Thus, coaching staff and athletes should monitor athletes' sleep quality before competitions to ensure athletes are in the optimal condition for performance.\n\n5th Seminar on Stochastic Processes, Random Fields and Applications\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nRusso, Francesco; Dozzi, Marco\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis volume contains twenty-eight refereed research or review papers presented at the 5th Seminar on Stochastic Processes, Random Fields and Applications, which took place at the Centro Stefano Franscini (Monte VeritÃ ) in Ascona, Switzerland, from May 30 to June 3, 2005.

Fatigue is the most frequently reported symptom in LC patients throughout the entire course of disease, and all international guidelines recommend early screening for cancer-related fatigue (CRF and symptoms that can affect patients' quality of life. In patients with LC, fatigue belongs to the symptom cluster of pain, depression, and insomnia, which are commonly observed simultaneously, but are typically treated as separate although they may have common biological mechanisms. The treatment of CRF remains one of the difficult areas in the oncology field: scarce evidence supports pharmacological therapies, while some interesting data arising indicates alternative remedies and physical exercise seem to be one of the most effective approaches for CRF at any stage of LC.

On June 2013, during a multidisciplinary field campaign, soil samples were collected in the caldera area to determinate the main mineralogical assemblages and to investigate the distribution of trace element concentrations and the possible relationship to the contribution of fluids of deep origin. Soil samples were analysed with XRD and for the chemical composition of their leachable (deionized water and pseudo total (microwave digestion fraction both for major and trace elements. The results allow to divide the samples in 2 groups: Lakki Plain and Stefanos Crater. The latter, where a fumarolic area is located, shows a mineralogical assemblage dominated by phases typical of hydrothermal alteration. Their very low pH values (1.9 â 3.4 show the strong impact of fumarolic gases which are probably also the cause of strong enrichments in these soils of highly volatile elements like S, As, Se, Bi, Sb, Tl and Te.Â\n\nDialogue sur le mariage, dialogue dans le mariage. Sur le troisiÃ¨me livre de la Civil Conversatione de Stefano Guazzo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJoanna Dimke-Kamola\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The starting point for this study of the marriage according to Guazzo is the notion of conversation in its original meaning, as living together. The treaty of Guazzo (1574 develops the concept of Â« civil conversazione Â» in which men exchange their opinions, but especially support each other and show mutual respect and amiability, which avoids conflicts. The study shows the analogies between such ideal of communication and Guazzoâs vision of the marriage â both envisaged in the humanistic and Christian perspectives: as foundations of society and means of mutual edification. Guazzoâs discourse concerning conversation of the spouses oscillates between the necessity of accomodation to the spouse (related to concealment and sincerity. Given the complexity of codes that characterize other types of communication, Â« marital conversazione Â» is presented as the closest to the ideal of transparency.\n\nMercury and trace element fractionation in Almaden soils by application of different sequential extraction procedures\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSanchez, D.M.; Quejido, A.J.; Fernandez, M.; Hernandez, C.; Schmid, T.; Millan, R.; Gonzalez, M.; Aldea, M.; Martin, R.; Morante, R. [CIEMAT, Madrid (Spain)\n\n2005-04-01\n\nA comparative evaluation of the mercury distribution in a soil sample from Almaden (Spain) has been performed by applying three different sequential extraction procedures, namely, modified BCR (three steps in sequence), Di Giulio-Ryan (four steps in sequence), and a specific SEP developed at CIEMAT (six steps in sequence). There were important differences in the mercury extraction results obtained by the three procedures according to the reagents applied and the sequence of their application. These findings highlight the difficulty of setting a universal SEP to obtain information on metal fractions of different mobility for any soil sample, as well as the requirement for knowledge about the mineralogical and chemical characteristics of the samples. The specific six-step CIEMAT sequential extraction procedure was applied to a soil profile (Ap, Ah, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons). The distribution of mercury and major, minor, and trace elements in the different fractions were determined. The results indicate that mercury is mainly released with 6 M HCl. The strong association of mercury with crystalline iron oxyhydroxides, present in all the horizons of the profile, and/or the solubility of some mercury compounds in such acid can explain this fact. Minor mercury is found in the fraction assigned t"
