I have just begun to research my heritage. My grandfather was Russell DeSalvo(Rossario DiSalvo). He was born in Sicily, I think in San Giuseppe,in 1891, and came to the U.S.around 1901. his father was Joseph,and also came at the same time. His mother was Antonnia Puma. My grandfather came through Ellis Island, but I don't know who sponsored him. He spent some time in North Carolina, and eventually made his way to Cincinnati, Ohio.Any info would be appreciated. Thanks!

His name was somehow changed when he immigrated, the immigration date is unknown. He married Susan Nottingham after he immigrated, his children's birthdates are in the 1880s. I am guessing that his name could have been LUCHINI since I found another LUCHENE whose name had been changed from LUCHINI. This other Luchene married a woman named NOTTINGHAM and lived in Michigan near where Ferdinand & Susan lived. Anybody have a clue as to how to proceed?

I am looking for living relatives and any further information on ancestors earlier than those I now mention. My gg-grandfather's name is Domenico born 1805 in Barga. His wife is named Assunta. Her maiden name was also Caproni. Sketchy information I have from a relative is that Domenico was raised by a Henry Marcucci. Assunta's parents Lorenzo and Marghorita along with Domenico and Assunta are all listed on the 1840 Barga church record. Domenico's son Antonio is my g-grandfather. He came to Chicago where he had a Saloon in the 1870s and 1880s. He married an Illinois girl named Mary Eliza Darnell. his older brother Joseph stayed in Italy and had several sons most of whom came to the Chicago area. Antonio helped most of them get started in business. I have located a few of their descendants but many of them either died young or went back to Italy before 1906. I have located another Caproni family group in the US centered in Maysville, Ky. I went to their reunion in 1995. Their roots are also from Barga/CastelVecchio.\n\nName: Michael A Giannetti\n\nEmail:firstmag@bellatlantic.net\n\nLocation: Bedminster, NJ USA\n\nDate: Saturday, April 17, 1999 at 20:25:48\n\nComments:\n\nJoe- this is a very nice page-thank you for allowing me to comment in your guest book-- Michele Giannetti and his 15 year old son arrived in NY NY Nov, 1893.
