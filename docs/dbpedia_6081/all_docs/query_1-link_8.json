        "text": "The Columbian Lawyers Association of Brooklyn got their passports out and traveled all the way to Staten Island where they were welcomed by Justice Ralph Porzio during its monthly meeting at Nino’s Restaurant on Hylan Boulevard on Jan. 10.\n\nThe Columbian Lawyers are one of the most powerful and influential bar associations in Brooklyn, but the group does include many members who live or practice in Staten Island so once a year they hold a meeting there.\n\nPorzio, who graduated from St. John’s University School of Law in 1984, is a former assistant district attorney in the Staten Island D.A. ‘s Office, who also worked for 17 years in private practice. and served as a Family Court judge from 1996 through 2006 following an appointment by Mayor Rudy Giuliani. He also served as counsel to State Senator Andrew Lanza.\n\nPorzio lectured for one hour during the Columbian Lawyer meeting on, “Topical Issues Involving Virtual Court Appearances, Virtual Trials, and Testimony.”\n\nPresident Salvatore Scibetta explained that the meeting was helpful to members, who might only practice part-time in Staten Island, but need to be informed on the latest developments in how that court handles virtual trials.\n\nPorzio was able to give them the latest update, and insight on how attorney’s might use the process to streamline their practices."
