        "text": "Annette is a 2021 musical romantic drama film directed by Leos Carax (in his English-language debut), and with a screenplay by Ron Mael and Russell Mael of Sparks, and Carax, from an original story, music and songs by the band. The plot follows a stand-up comedian (Adam Driver) and his opera singer wife (Marion Cotillard) and how their lives are changed when they have their first child; Simon Helberg and Devyn McDowell also star.\n\nAnnette was released in France on 7 July 2021 by UGC Distribution, a day after premiering as the opening film at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.[1] The film has received positive reviews from critics.\n\nPlot[]\n\nAfter a swift courtship, provocative stand-up comedian Henry McHenry (Adam Driver) publicly declares his engagement to world-famous soprano Ann Desfranoux (Marion Cotillard). Shortly afterward, Ann gives birth to their daughter Annette, portrayed by a wooden marionette puppet. The marriage becomes fraught with Henry having to take care of Annette while his wife is traveling due to her increasingly successful career.\n\nAnn soon has a dream of six women who come forward with allegations of past abuse by Henry and eventually a nightmare of Henry almost killing her himself. His career begins to spiral, exacerbated by an onstage meltdown, and he comes to resent Ann for her continued success. The two schedule a private cruise to mend their relationship, but it ends in disaster when Ann falls overboard during a stormy night as Henry drunkenly forces Ann to waltz with him. After her mother's death, the infant Annette suddenly gains the ability to sing using her mother’s voice which is used to haunt Henry.\n\nThough cleared of legal suspicion for Ann's death, Henry finds himself at a financial dead-end without her income. He contacts Ann's former accompanist (Simon Helberg), showing him Annette's singing voice and suggesting they use her gift for a musical act. The accompanist reluctantly agrees, having been in love with Ann, and as they tour together Baby Annette proves a worldwide hit. Henry continues drinking heavily and staying out late, still haunted by Ann. When Henry returns home, he hears Annette singing the melody of “We Love Each Other So Much,” supposedly it being only Ann and Henry’s song. Henry blows up at the accompanist who implies to Henry that he is Annette's real father, and Henry murders him, witnessed by Annette. Henry plans one final performance for Baby Annette, at the halftime show of the \"Hyperbowl\", but she refuses to sing and instead declares \"Daddy kills people\" to the packed stadium. Henry is tried and convicted for the killings.\n\nA few years later Annette visits her father in prison and when he tells her she looks different, she speaks not from the puppet sitting before him, but from a human child (Devyn McDowell) standing at the window. Annette denies his attempts to reconcile with her, and even blames her mother for using her to get revenge. Henry and Annette share one final goodbye before leaving him alone in the prison visiting area. The Annette puppet lies discarded and lifeless on the floor.\n\nCast[]\n\nAdam Driver as Henry McHenry\n\nMarion Cotillard as Ann Defrasnoux\n\nCatherine Trottmann as Ann’s singing soprano voice\n\nSimon Helberg as The Accompanist\n\nDevyn McDowell as Annette\n\nHebe Griffiths as the singing voice of Annette’s puppet form.\n\nAngèle, Kiko Mizuhara, Julia Bullock, Claron McFadden, Noémie Schellens, and Natalie Mendoza as the Six Accuser Chorus\n\nNatalia Lafourcade as LAPD Police Officer\n\nKanji Furutachi as Doctor\n\nRila Fukushima, Eva Van Der Gucht, and Laura Jansen as Nurses\n\nRebecca Sjöwall as Connie O'Connor\n\nNino Porzio as Sheriff Garoni\n\nWim Opbrouck as Baby Annette Announcer\n\nRussell Mael as Russell Mael/Jet Pilot\n\nRon Mael as Ron Mael/Jet Pilot\n\nLeos Carax as Leos Carax\n\nNastya Carax as Nastya\n\nRebecca Dyson-Smith as Photographer\n\nGraciela María as Photographer\n\nColin Lainchbury-Brown as Hyperbowl Announcer\n\nGeoffrey Carey as Ape of God Announcer\n\nProduction[]\n\nIt was announced in November 2016 that Leos Carax was set to make his English language film debut, with Adam Driver, Rooney Mara and Rihanna in talks to star in the film.

Filming was moved to begin in Summer 2019.[8]\n\nDevelopment resumed on the project in May 2019, with Marion Cotillard now cast to replace Williams.[9][10] In October 2019, Simon Helberg joined the cast of the film.[11]\n\nFilming began in August 2019, with shooting taking place in Los Angeles, Brussels, and Bruges[12] as well as various locations in Germany including Münster, Cologne, and Bonn.[13] Production concluded in November 2019.[14] In January 2020, it was revealed that Belgian singer Angèle was cast in an undisclosed role.[15]\n\nMusic[]\n\nThe first song from the film's score and soundtrack, \"So May We Start\", was released on 28 May 2021.[16] The stars of the film, while not trained singers, do most of their own singing.[17]\n\nA second song from the soundtrack, \"We Love Each Other So Much\" was released to the public on June 25, 2021 on multiple streaming services. The soundtrack Annette (Cannes Edition - Selections from the Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released on CD and double vinyl on MasterWorks / Milan label though Sony Music: it contains 15 tracks.\n\nThe movie contains multiple Sparks song excerpts not on the soundtrack, including \"Rock, Rock, Rock\", \"Thanks But No Thanks\", \"Bon Voyage\", and \"Calm Before the Opera\".\n\nRelease[]\n\nThe debuted at the Cannes Film Festival on 6 July 2021.[18] It was released in France on 6 July, by UGC Distribution.[19][20] It was released in the United States in a limited release on 6 August 2021 prior to digital streaming on Amazon Prime Video on 20 August 2021.[21] In June 2021, the film's UK and Ireland distribution rights were acquired by streaming service MUBI.[22]\n\nReception[]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 172 reviews, and an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"A dreamy, delicate dance between farce and fantasia, Annette is a magnificently ludicrous rock opera whose experimental approach to its emotional extremes is an ambitious, if not peculiar, return for director Leos Carax.\"[23] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[24]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nTemplate:IMDB\n\n[TBA Annette (Feature Film)] on [TBA Crew United]\n\nTemplate:Leos Carax Template:Sparks"
