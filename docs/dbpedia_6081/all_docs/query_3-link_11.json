        "text": "Vesi pizzeria for almost 100 years floods the streets of Naples with an irresistible fragrance, with a quality that has been handed down from generation to generation since 1921, always guaranteeing the same care, without ever going back on the choice of products, without ever losing touch with tradition and ensuring full customer satisfaction.\n\nBorn with “don Ciccio”, the Vesi family history has evolved over time through the experience gained in many pizzerias that have grown and have established themselves thanks to its art.\n\nToday Vesi, with three locations in the historic center of Naples, is a guarantee of quality and innovation. Once you have stepped in the pizzeria, you’re home: a small and welcoming environment, wooden tables and delicate smell of dough.\n\nThe first glimpse at the San Biagio dei Librai location is Salvatore, the third brother after Giuseppe and Ferdinando to follow the very ancient footprints of a family that is among the most illustrious in the preparation of this divine dish, all Neapolitan. The other brothers, proud of their origins, stand out for their creativity and their recipes in the two locations of Piazzetta Miraglia and Via Bellini. The colorful menu of 42 different pizzas persists in the timeless tradition of healthy taste of genuine ingredients, unquestionably quality guaranteed by the STG brand. The award-winning Vesi team keeps the classic recipes of grandfather Ciccio, not forgetting the familiar inclination to new creations. Among these, the one presented at the Napoli Pizza Village 2017: ‘O Cappiello ‘e Totò, dedicated to the prince of laughter, with the peculiar shape of a hat guaranteed by its work with double dough."
