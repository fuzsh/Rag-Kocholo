        "text": "Factors predicting survival in ALS: a multicenter Italian study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCalvo, Andrea; Moglia, Cristina; Lunetta, Christian; Marinou, Kalliopi; Ticozzi, Nicola; Ferrante, Gianluca Drago; Scialo, Carlo; SorarÃ¹, Gianni; Trojsi, Francesca; Conte, Amelia; Falzone, Yuri M; Tortelli, Rosanna; Russo, Massimo; ChiÃ², Adriano; Sansone, Valeria Ada; Mora, Gabriele; Silani, Vincenzo; Volanti, Paolo; Caponnetto, Claudia; Querin, Giorgia; MonsurrÃ², Maria Rosaria; Sabatelli, Mario; Riva, Nilo; Logroscino, Giancarlo; Messina, Sonia; Fini, Nicola; Mandrioli, Jessica\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe aim of this multicenter, retrospective study is to investigate the role of clinical characteristics and therapeutic intervention on ALS prognosis. The study included patients diagnosed from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013 in 13 Italian referral centers for ALS located in 10 Italian regions. Caring neurologists collected a detailed phenotypic profile and follow-up data until death into an electronic database. One center collected also data from a population-based registry for ALS. 2648 incident cases were collected. The median survival time from onset to death/tracheostomy was 44Â months (SE 1.18, CI 42-46). According to univariate analysis, factors related to survival from onset to death/tracheostomy were: age at onset, diagnostic delay, site of onset, phenotype, degree of certainty at diagnosis according to revised El Escorial criteria (R-EEC), presence/absence of dementia, BMI at diagnosis, patients' provenance. In the multivariate analysis, age at onset, diagnostic delay, phenotypes but not site of onset, presence/absence of dementia, BMI, riluzole use, R-EEC criteria were independent prognostic factors of survival in ALS. We compared patients from an ALS Registry with patients from tertiary centers; the latter ones were younger, less frequently bulbar, but more frequently familial and definite at diagnosis. Our large, multicenter study demonstrated the role of some clinical and demographic factors on ALS survival, and showed some interesting differences between referral centers' patients and the general ALS population. These results can be helpful for clinical practice, in clinical trial design and to validate new tools to predict disease progression.\n\nEstablishment of an Italian chronic migraine database: a multicenter pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarbanti, Piero; Fofi, L; Cevoli, S; Torelli, P; Aurilia, C; Egeo, G; Grazzi, L; D'Amico, D; Manzoni, G C; Cortelli, P; Infarinato, F; Vanacore, N\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTo optimize chronic migraine (CM) ascertainment and phenotype definition, provide adequate clinical management and health care procedures, and rationalize economic resources allocation, we performed an exploratory multicenter pilot study aimed at establishing a CM database, the first step for developing a future Italian CM registry. We enrolled 63 consecutive CM patients in four tertiary headache centers screened with face-to-face interviews using an ad hoc dedicated semi-structured questionnaire gathering detailed information on life-style, behavioral and socio-demographic factors, comorbidities, and migraine features before and after chronicization and healthcare resource use. Our pilot study provided useful insights revealing that CM patients (1) presented in most cases symptoms of peripheral trigeminal sensitization, a relatively unexpected feature which could be useful to unravel different CM endophenotypes and to predict trigeminal-targeted treatments' responsiveness; (2) had been frequently admitted to emergency departments; (3) had undergone, sometime repeatedly, unnecessary or inappropriate investigations; (4) got rarely illness benefit exemption or disability allowance only. We deem that the expansion of the database-shortly including many other Italian headache centers-will contribute to more precisely outline CM endophenotypes, hence improving management, treatment, and economic resource allocation, ultimately reducing CM burden on both patients and health system.\n\nThe Italian dementia with Lewy bodies study group (DLB-SINdem): toward a standardization of clinical procedures and multicenter cohort studies design.\n\nPubMed\n\nBonanni, L; Cagnin, A; Agosta, F; Babiloni, C; Borroni, B; Bozzali, M; Bruni, A C; Filippi, M; Galimberti, D; Monastero, R; Muscio, C; Parnetti, L; Perani, D; Serra, L; Silani, V; Tiraboschi, P; Padovani, A\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) causes elevated outlays for the National Health Systems due to high institutionalization rate and patients' reduced quality of life and high mortality. Furthermore, DLB is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease. These data motivate harmonized multicenter longitudinal cohort studies to improve clinical management and therapy monitoring. The Italian DLB study group of the Italian Neurological Society for dementia (SINdem) developed and emailed a semi-structured questionnaire to 572 national dementia centers (from primary to tertiary) to prepare an Italian large longitudinal cohort. The questionnaire surveyed: (1) prevalence and incidence of DLB; (2) clinical assessment; (3) relevance and availability of diagnostic tools; (4) pharmacological management of cognitive, motor, and behavioural disturbances; (5) causes of hospitalization, with specific focus on delirium and its treatment. Overall, 135 centers (23.6Â %) contributed to the survey. Overall, 5624 patients with DLB are currently followed by the 135 centers in a year (2042 of them are new patients). The percentage of DLB patients was lower (27Â Â±Â 8Â %) than that of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (56Â Â±Â 27Â %) patients. The majority of the centers (91Â %) considered the clinical and neuropsychological assessments as the most relevant procedure for a DLB diagnosis. Nonetheless, most of the centers has availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 95Â %), electroencephalography (EEG; 93Â %), and FP-CIT single photon emission-computerized tomography (SPECT; 75Â %) scan for clinical applications. It will be, therefore, possible to recruit a large harmonized Italian cohort of DLB patients for future cross-sectional and longitudinal multicenter studies.\n\nDisorders of glucose metabolism in Prader-Willi syndrome: Results of a multicenter Italian cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFintini, D; Grugni, G; Bocchini, S; Brufani, C; Di Candia, S; Corrias, A; Delvecchio, M; Salvatoni, A; Ragusa, L; Greggio, N; Franzese, A; Scarano, E; TrifirÃ², G; Mazzanti, L; Chiumello, G; Cappa, M; CrinÃ², A\n\n2016-09-01\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by a high incidence of altered glucose metabolism (AGM). However, epidemiological data on impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are still discordant. We performed a multicenter study based on 274 PWS patients [144 females, aged 20.3Â Â±Â 10.4Â yrs (range: 8.1-50.1 years)] evaluating the prevalence for AGM in the entire group, and according to age (children <10Â yrs; adolescents 10-18Â yrs, and adults >18Â yrs), Body Mass Index (BMIÂ =Â kg/m(2)), gender, genotypes (deletion or uniparental disomy for chromosome 15), and GH therapy (GHT) (untreated, previously or currently treated). Altogether, AGM was detected in 67 (24.4%) of patients (0.7% IFG, 10.2% IGT, 13.5% T2DM). The prevalence of AGM was correlated to age (pÂ =Â 0.001), BMI (pÂ =Â 0.001) and HOMA-IR (pÂ =Â 0.001). However, gender, genotype, and GHT did not influence AGM development in univariate analysis. These data were confirmed as positive predictors when inserted in a multivariate analysis model. This study is the first report on the prevalence of AGM in a large population of PWS. Overall, PWS subjects show a high prevalence of AGM that appears more common in obese and adult subjects. Our data confirm the main role of obesity on the individual metabolic risk clustering in PWS, and thus reinforce the concept that improvement in weight control remains the most important goal of any PWS treatment program.

Aim of the present multicenter study was to investigate attitudes and determinants associated with acceptance of influenza vaccination among Italian MRs. A survey was performed in 2012 on MRs attending post-graduate schools of 18 Italian Universities. Each participant was interviewed via an anonymous, self-administered, web-based questionnaire including questions on attitudes regarding influenza vaccination. A total of 2506 MRs were recruited in the survey and 299 (11.9%) of these stated they had accepted influenza vaccination in 2011-2012 season. Vaccinated MRs were older (P = 0.006), working in clinical settings (P = 0.048), and vaccinated in the 2 previous seasons (P<0.001 in both seasons). Moreover, MRs who had recommended influenza vaccination to their patients were significantly more compliant with influenza vaccination uptake in 2011-2012 season (P<0.001). \"To avoid spreading influenza among patients\" was recognized as the main reason for accepting vaccination by less than 15% of vaccinated MRs. Italian MRs seem to have a very low compliance with influenza vaccination and they seem to accept influenza vaccination as a habit that is unrelated to professional and ethical responsibility. Otherwise, residents who refuse vaccination in the previous seasons usually maintain their behaviors. Promoting correct attitudes and good practice in order to improve the influenza immunization rates of MRs could represent a decisive goal for increasing immunization coverage among health care workers of the future.\n\nGHPSS multicenter Italian survey: smoking prevalence, knowledge and attitudes, and tobacco cessation training among third-year medical students.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaulle, Rosella; Bontempi, Claudio; Baldo, Vincenzo; Boccia, Giovanni; Bonaccorsi, Guglielmo; Brusaferro, Silvio; Donato, Francesco; Firenze, Alberto; Gregorio, Pasquale; Pelissero, Gabriele; Sella, Alberto; Siliquini, Roberta; Boccia, Antonio; La Torre, Giuseppe\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHealthcare professionals have an important role to play both as advisers - influencing smoking cessation - and as role models. The aims of this study were to examine smoking prevalence, knowledge and attitudes among Italian university students attending medical schools using the Global Health Professions Student Survey (GHPSS) approach. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among University students of 9 Italian medical schools (age ranging between 19 and 29 years). The GHPSS questionnaire was self-administered. A logistic regression model was used to identify possible factors associated with tobacco smoking status. Data were analyzed with the software SPSS 19.0 for Windows. Seven hundred thirty medical students (response rate 100%) were enrolled. The prevalence of current smokers was 20.4% (males 22.4%, females 19.1%). Of the total sample, 87.7% believed that health professionals should receive specific training in techniques to quit smoking, and 65% believed that health professionals had a role in giving advice or information about smoking cessation. However, 89.4% answered that they had not received specific training on smoking cessation techniques. Multivariate analysis showed that students belonging to universities in southern Italy were more likely to be smokers (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.03-3.97). This Italian multicenter survey found that one fifth of future medical doctors are smokers. There is a need to adopt a standard undergraduate curriculum containing comprehensive tobacco prevention and cessation training to improve their effectiveness as role models.\n\nComorbidity of dementia with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): insights from a large multicenter Italian cohort.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrojsi, Francesca; Siciliano, Mattia; Femiano, Cinzia; Santangelo, Gabriella; Lunetta, Christian; Calvo, Andrea; Moglia, Cristina; Marinou, Kalliopi; Ticozzi, Nicola; Drago Ferrante, Gianluca; ScialÃ², Carlo; SorarÃ¹, Gianni; Conte, Amelia; Falzone, Yuri M; Tortelli, Rosanna; Russo, Massimo; Sansone, Valeria Ada; ChiÃ², Adriano; Mora, Gabriele; Poletti, Barbara; Volanti, Paolo; Caponnetto, Claudia; Querin, Giorgia; Sabatelli, Mario; Riva, Nilo; Logroscino, Giancarlo; Messina, Sonia; Fasano, Antonio; MonsurrÃ², Maria Rosaria; Tedeschi, Gioacchino; Mandrioli, Jessica\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo assess the association, at diagnosis, between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and dementia in a large cohort of well-characterized Italian patients. We investigated the phenotypic profile of 1638 incident patients with definite, probable or laboratory-supported probable ALS, diagnosed from January 2009 to December 2013 in 13 Italian Referral Centers, located in 10 Italian Regions, and classified in two independent subsamples accounting for presence or not of dementia. The collected ALS features, including survival and other follow-up data, were compared between the two subgroups using a one-way analysis of variance and Chi-square test, as appropriate, logistic regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Between-subgroup comparisons showed an older age at clinical observation (pÂ =Â .006), at onset and at diagnosis (pÂ =Â .002) in demented versus non demented ALS patients. After adjustment for these variables, diagnosis of dementia was significantly associated with higher odds of family history of ALS (pÂ =Â .001) and frontotemporal dementia (pÂ =Â .003) and of bulbar onset (pÂ =Â .004), and lower odds of flail leg phenotype (pÂ =Â .019) and spinal onset (pÂ =Â .008). The median survival time was shorter in demented versus non-demented patients, especially in case of classical, bulbar and flail limb phenotypes and both bulbar and spinal onset. Our multicenter study emphasized the importance of an early diagnosis of comorbid dementia in ALS patients, which may have clinical impact and prognostic relevance. Moreover, our results may give further inputs to validation of ALS-specific tools for the screening of cognitive impairment in clinical practice.\n\nSurvey on treatments for primary headaches in 13 specialized juvenile Headache Centers: The first multicenter Italian study.\n\nPubMed\n\nToldo, Irene; Rattin, Martina; Perissinotto, Egle; De Carlo, Debora; Bolzonella, Barbara; Nosadini, Margherita; Rossi, Livia Nicoletta; Vecchio, Angelo; Simonati, Alessandro; Carotenuto, Marco; Scalas, Cinzia; Sciruicchio, Vittorio; Raieli, Vincenzo; Mazzotta, Giovanni; Tozzi, Elisabetta; Valeriani, Massimiliano; Cianchetti, Carlo; Balottin, Umberto; Guidetti, Vincenzo; Sartori, Stefano; Battistella, Pier Antonio\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe purpose of this retrospective multicenter study was to evaluate the use and the self-perceived efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in children and adolescents with primary headaches. Study of a cohort of children and adolescents diagnosed with primary headache, consecutively referred to 13 juvenile Italian Headache Centers. An ad hoc questionnaire was used for clinical data collection. Among 706 patients with primary headaches included in the study, 637 cases with a single type of headache (migraine 76% - with and without aura in 10% and 67% respectively; tension-type headache 24%) were selected (mean age at clinical interview: 12 years). Acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (in particular ibuprofen) were commonly used to treat attacks, by 76% and 46% of cases respectively. Triptans were used overall by 6% of migraineurs and by 13% of adolescents with migraine, with better efficacy than acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Preventive drugs were used by 19% of migraineurs and by 3% of subjects with tension-type headache. In migraineurs, flunarizine was the most frequently used drug (18%), followed by antiepileptic drugs (7%) and pizotifen (6%), while cyproheptadine, propanolol and amitriptyline were rarely used. Pizotifen showed the best perceived efficacy and tolerability. Melatonin and nutraceuticals were used by 10% and 32% of subjects, respectively, both for migraine and tension-type headache, with good results in terms of perceived efficacy and tolerability. Non-pharmacological preventive treatments (i.e. relaxation techniques, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy, acupuncture) were used only by 10% of cases (migraine 9%, tension-type headache 15%). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially ibuprofen, should be preferred to acetaminophen for acute attacks of migraine or tension-type headache, because they were usually more effective and well tolerated.

We performed a multicenter study to identify all patients aged 18 years and over who were admitted to 10 Italian EDs during 2009 for hypertensive crises (systolic blood pressure â¥220 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure â¥120 mmHg). We classified patients as affected by either hypertensive emergencies or hypertensive urgencies depending on the presence or the absence of progressive target organ damage, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was then performed to assess variables independently associated with hypertensive emergencies with respect to hypertensive urgencies. Of 333,407 patients admitted to the EDs over the one-year period, 1,546 had hypertensive crises (4.6/1,000, 95% CI 4.4-4.9), and 23% of them had unknown hypertension. Hypertensive emergencies (nâ=â391, 25.3% of hypertensive crises) were acute pulmonary edema (30.9%), stroke (22.0%,), myocardial infarction (17.9%), acute aortic dissection (7.9%), acute renal failure (5.9%) and hypertensive encephalopathy (4.9%). Men had higher frequency than women of unknown hypertension (27.9% vs 18.5%, p<0.001). Even among known hypertensive patients, a larger proportion of men than women reported not taking anti-hypertensive drug (12.6% among men and 9.4% among women (p<0.001). Compared to women of similar age, men had higher likelihood of having hypertensive emergencies than urgencies (ORâ=â1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70), independently of presenting symptoms, creatinine, smoking habit and known hypertension. This study shows that hypertensive crises involved almost 5 out of 1,000 patients-year admitted to EDs. Sex differences in frequencies of unknown hypertension, compliance to treatment and risk of hypertensive emergencies might have implications for public health programs.\n\nHospital Admissions for Hypertensive Crisis in the Emergency Departments: A Large Multicenter Italian Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPinna, Giuliano; Pascale, Claudio; Fornengo, Paolo; Arras, Sebastiana; Piras, Carmela; Panzarasa, Pietro; Carmosino, Gianpaolo; Franza, Orietta; Semeraro, Vincenzo; Lenti, Salvatore; Pietrelli, Susanna; Panzone, Sergio; Bracco, Christian; Fiorini, Roberto; Rastelli, Giovanni; Bergandi, Daniela; Zampaglione, Bruno; Musso, Roberto; Marengo, Claudio; Santoro, Giancarlo; Zamboni, Sergio; Traversa, Barbara; Barattini, Maddalena; Bruno, Graziella\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEpidemiological data on the impact of hypertensive crises (emergencies and urgencies) on referral to the Emergency Departments (EDs) are lacking, in spite of the evidence that they may be life-threatening conditions.

The natural history of scimitar syndrome was analyzed in 44 affected individuals (from 9 Italian centers). The median age at diagnosis was 1.05 years (range, 1 day-41 years). Thirty-three patients (75%) had an isolated form; 11 patients (25%) had associated congenital heart diseases. Twenty-two patients (50%) were symptomatic at diagnosis, including respiratory symptoms (n=20) and congestive heart failure (n=6). Patients with associated congenital heart defects had a higher prevalence of congestive heart failure (4 of 11 [36.4%] vs 2 of 33 [6.1%]; P=.027), pulmonary arterial hypertension (7 of 11 [63.6%] vs 2 of 33 [6.1%]; P=.027) than patients with isolated forms. Ten patients (22.7%) underwent correction of associated cardiac defects, leaving the anomalous pulmonary venous drainage intact. The median length of follow-up after diagnosis was 6.4 years (range, 0.2-27.5 years). Two patients died, both with associated cardiac defects and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. Of 42 survivors, 39 (92.8%) were asymptomatic at the last follow-up visit; 3 patients still complained respiratory symptoms. There was no difference between isolated and associated forms of the disease. In most patients, scimitar syndrome presented as an isolated lesion with a benign outcome. Nonetheless, when associated with other cardiac defects and pulmonary arterial hypertension, there was an increased risk of congestive heart failure and mortality. Correction of associated cardiac defects (transforming \"associated\" into \"isolated\" forms), together with the therapeutic occlusion of anomalous arterial supply to the lung, led to a benign outcome comparable to that in primarily isolated forms.

Multi-center, retrospective, observational study of HIV patients included in the MASTER Italian Cohort with a cancer diagnosis from January 1998 to September 2012. Malignancies were divided into ADC or NADC on the basis of the Centre for Disease Control-1993 classification. Recurrence of cancer and metastases were excluded. Survivals were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared according to the log-rank test. Statistically significant variables at univariate analysis were entered in a multivariate Cox regression model. Eight hundred and sixty-six cancer diagnoses were recorded among 13,388 subjects in the MASTER Database after 1998: 435 (51%) were ADCs and 431 (49%) were NADCs. Survival was more favorable after an ADC diagnosis than a NADC diagnosis (10-year survival: 62.7%Â±2.9% vs. 46%Â±4.2%; pâ=â0.017). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma had lower survival rates than patients with Kaposi sarcoma or cervical cancer (10-year survival: 48.2%Â±4.3% vs. 72.8%Â±4.0% vs. 78.5%Â±9.9%; p<0.001). Regarding NADCs, breast cancer showed better survival (10-year survival: 65.1%Â±14%) than lung cancer (1-year survival: 28%Â±8.7%), liver cancer (5-year survival: 31.9%Â±6.4%) or Hodgkin lymphoma (10-year survival: 24.8%Â±11.2%). Lower CD4+ count and intravenous drug use were significantly associated with decreased survival after ADCs or NADCs diagnosis. Exposure to cART was found to be associated with prolonged survival only in the case of ADCs. cART has improved survival in patients with an ADC diagnosis, whereas the prognosis after a diagnosis of NADCs is poor. Low CD4+ counts and intravenous drug use are risk factors for survival following a diagnosis of ADCs and Hodgkin lymphoma in the NADC group.\n\nPreliminary results of endovascular aneurysm sealing from the multicenter Italian Research on Nellix Endoprosthesis (IRENE) study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGossetti, Bruno; Martinelli, Ombretta; Ferri, Michelangelo; Silingardi, Roberto; Verzini, Fabio\n\n2018-05-01\n\nBecause of advances in technology and experience of the operator, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has supplanted open repair to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The low 30-day mortality and morbidity of EVAR make the endovascular approach particularly suitable for patients at high surgical risk. However, endoleak or endograft migration requiring secondary intervention or open surgical conversion is a limitation of EVAR. The Nellix system (Endologix, Inc, Irvine, Calif) has been designed to seal the entire AAA to overcome these limitations with EVAR. We report the results of a retrospective, multicenter study with endovascular aneurysm sealing (EVAS) aimed to assess technical success, procedure-related mortality, complications, and reinterventions. This study included patients selected for elective treatment with the Nellix device per the endovascular repair protocol at 16 Italian vascular centers. All patients were enrolled in a postoperative surveillance imaging program including duplex ultrasound investigations, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance controls following local standards of care. From 2013 to 2015, there were 335 patients (age, 75.5Â Â± 7.4Â years; 316 men) who underwent elective EVAS. In 295 cases (88.0%), EVAS was performed under standard instructions for use of the Nellix system. Preoperative aneurysm diameter was 55.5Â Â± 9.4Â mm (range, 46-65Â mm). The inferior mesenteric artery and lumbar arteries emerging from the AAA were patent in 61.8% and 81.3% of cases, respectively. Chimney grafts were electively carried out in eight cases (2.4%).

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of vinflunine and to evaluate the prognostic significance of risk factors in a large, unselected cohort of patients with metastatic TCCU treated according to routine clinical practice. This was a retrospective multicenter study. Italian cancer centers were selected if, according to the Registry of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA), at least four patients had been treated with vinflunine between February 2011 and June 2014, after first- or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary objective was to test whether the efficacy measured by overall survival (OS) in the registration study could be confirmed in routine clinical practice. Multivariate analysis was carried out using Cox proportional hazard model. A total of 217 patients were treated in 28 Italian centers. Median age was 69 years (IQR 62-76) and 84% were male; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) was â¥ 1 in 53% of patients. The median number of cycles was 4 (IQR 2-6); 29%, 35%, and 36% received an initial dose of 320 mg/m 2 , 280 mg/m 2 or a lower dose, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for the entire population was 3.2 months (2.6-3.7) and 8.1 months (6.3-8.9). A complete response was observed in six patients, partial response in 21, stable disease in 60, progressive disease in 108, with a disease control rate of 40%. Multivariate analysis showed that ECOG PS, number of metastatic sites and liver involvement were unfavorable prognostic factors for OS. Toxicity was mild, and grade 3-4 adverse effects were mainly: neutropenia (9%), anemia (6%), asthenia/fatigue (7%) and constipation (5%).

We enrolled 309 patients (age 1 month-18 years) candidate to different central venous access devices (VAD) - 56 peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC), 178 short term centrally inserted central catheters (CICC), 65 long term VADs, 10 VADs for dialysis - in five Italian Hospitals. Three age groups were considered: A (<4 years, n = 157), B (4-11 years, n = 119), and C (12-18 years, n = 31). IC-ECG was applicable in 307 cases. The increase of the P wave on IC-ECG was detected in all cases but two. The tip of the catheter was positioned at the cavo-atrial junction (CAJ) (i.e., at the maximal height of the P wave on IC-ECG) and the position was checked during the procedure by fluoroscopy or chest x-ray, considering the CAJ at 1-2 cm (group A), 1.5-3 cm (group B), or 2-4 cm (group C) below the carina. There were no complications related to IC-ECG. The overall match between IC-ECG and x-ray was 95.8% (96.2% in group A, 95% in group B, and 96.8% in group C). In 95 cases, the IC-ECG was performed with a dedicated ECG monitor, specifically designed for IC-ECG (Nautilus, Romedex): in this group, the match between IC-ECG and x-ray was 98.8%. We conclude that the IC-ECG method is safe and accurate in the pediatric patients. The applicability of the method is 99.4% and its feasibility is 99.4%. The accuracy is 95.8% and even higher (98.8%) when using a dedicated ECG monitor.\n\nSurvival in HIV-Infected Patients after a Cancer Diagnosis in the cART Era: Results of an Italian Multicenter Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGotti, Daria; Raffetti, Elena; Albini, Laura; Sighinolfi, Laura; Maggiolo, Franco; Di Filippo, Elisa; Ladisa, Nicoletta; Angarano, Gioacchino; Lapadula, Giuseppe; Pan, Angelo; Esposti, Anna Degli; Fabbiani, Massimiliano; FocÃ , Emanuele; Scalzini, Alfredo; Donato, Francesco; Quiros-Roldan, Eugenia\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjectives We studied survival and associated risk factors in an Italian nationwide cohort of HIV-infected individuals after an AIDS-defining cancer (ADC) or non-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC) diagnosis in the modern cART era. Methods Multi-center, retrospective, observational study of HIV patients included in the MASTER Italian Cohort with a cancer diagnosis from January 1998 to September 2012. Malignancies were divided into ADC or NADC on the basis of the Centre for Disease Control-1993 classification. Recurrence of cancer and metastases were excluded. Survivals were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared according to the log-rank test. Statistically significant variables at univariate analysis were entered in a multivariate Cox regression model. Results Eight hundred and sixty-six cancer diagnoses were recorded among 13,388 subjects in the MASTER Database after 1998: 435 (51%) were ADCs and 431 (49%) were NADCs. Survival was more favorable after an ADC diagnosis than a NADC diagnosis (10-year survival: 62.7%Â±2.9% vs. 46%Â±4.2%; pâ=â0.017). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma had lower survival rates than patients with Kaposi sarcoma or cervical cancer (10-year survival: 48.2%Â±4.3% vs. 72.8%Â±4.0% vs. 78.5%Â±9.9%; p<0.001). Regarding NADCs, breast cancer showed better survival (10-year survival: 65.1%Â±14%) than lung cancer (1-year survival: 28%Â±8.7%), liver cancer (5-year survival: 31.9%Â±6.4%) or Hodgkin lymphoma (10-year survival: 24.8%Â±11.2%). Lower CD4+ count and intravenous drug use were significantly associated with decreased survival after ADCs or NADCs diagnosis. Exposure to cART was found to be associated with prolonged survival only in the case of ADCs. Conclusions cART has improved survival in patients with an ADC diagnosis, whereas the prognosis after a diagnosis of NADCs is poor. Low CD4+ counts and intravenous drug use are risk factors for survival following a diagnosis of ADCs and Hodgkin lymphoma in the NADC group.

Italian Study Group on Vulvar Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\n1996-09-01\n\nTo investigate epidemiologic, clinical and pathologic aspects of various grades of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). A retrospective, multicenter study of 370 cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) was performed by the Italian Study Group on Vulvar Disease. Of the 370 cases, 148 were VIN 1 (40.0%, 53 were VIN 2 (14.3%), and 169 were VIN 3 (45.7%). The mean age of the patients was 52.6 years. During the study period an increase in the rate of human papillomavirus-associated VIN was observed. In addition, while VIN 1 and 2 were associated mostly with squamous cell hyperplasia, VIN 3 was almost equally associated with lichen sclerosus and squamous cell hyperplasia; the difference was statistically significant. Intraepithelial or invasive squamous neoplasia of the lower genital tract was associated in 22% of the cases (82/370). The results of the investigation, although not allowing firm conclusions due to the retrospective and multicentered nature of the study, demonstrate the extreme heterogeneity of VIN lesions.\n\nSubclinical atherosclerosis and history of cardiovascular events in Italian patients with rheumatoid arthritis: Results from a cross-sectional, multicenter GIRRCS (Gruppo Italiano di Ricerca in Reumatologia Clinica e Sperimentale) study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuscitti, Piero; Margiotta, Domenico Paolo Emanuele; Macaluso, Federica; Iacono, Daniela; D'Onofrio, Francesca; Emmi, Giacomo; Atzeni, Fabiola; Prete, Marcella; Perosa, Federico; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo; Emmi, Lorenzo; Cantatore, Francesco Paolo; Triolo, Giovanni; Afeltra, Antonella; Giacomelli, Roberto; Valentini, Gabriele\n\n2017-10-01\n\nevents, subclinical atherosclerosis was detected in 16% of our patients, (176 patients), a figure lower than that reported worldwide (32.7%) and in previous Italian studies.This is the first Italian multicenter study on subclinical and clinical atherosclerosis in patients with RA.

A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2015 to January 2016, using a data collection tool composed of three validated questionnaires and a sociodemographic form. Eight hundred twenty-four nurses filled out the questionnaire. Despite their awareness of homosexuality as a \"natural expression of one's sexuality,\" Italian nurses showed only moderately positive attitudes towards lesbian and gay patients. A more positive attitude was displayed by women when compared with men (p < .001). Greater knowledge of homosexuality was associated with female gender (p = .042), moderate-wing political affiliation (p = .014), and more affirmative behaviors (p = .008). Men were found to have greater awareness of being prepared to care for LGBT people (p = .022). Although Italian nurses displayed moderately positive attitudes and affirmative behaviors, there is the need to increase their cultural competencies regarding sexual minorities. LGBT patients feel some discomfort in approaching physicians or nurses. It is important to know nurses' attitudes in caring for LGBT patients in order to modify inappropriate and discriminatory behaviors.

A multicenter study on Italian patients using the dermatology life quality index.\n\nPubMed\n\nIngordo, Vito; Cazzaniga, Simone; Medri, Matelda; Raone, Beatrice; Digiuseppe, Maria Donata; Musumeci, Maria Letizia; Romano, Ivana; Fai, Dario; Pellegrino, Michele; Pezzarossa, Enrico; Di Lernia, Vito; Peccerillo, Francesca; Battarra, Vincenzo Claudio; Sirna, Riccardo; Patrizi, Annalisa; Naldi, Luigi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIt is believed that vitiligo has an impact on the overall patient quality of life (QoL). To estimate QoL in a fairly large sample of Italian vitiligo patients by using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-one vitiligo patients referred to 9 dermatological centers were offered to participate by filling in the Italian version of the DLQI questionnaire. The mean total DLQI score was 4.3 (SD Â±4.9; range: 0-22). In multivariate analysis, DLQI >5 was associated with female gender, stability of the disease over time and involvement of the face at disease onset. The impairment of QoL is overall limited in Italian vitiligo patients, especially if it is compared with results from other available studies. This could be due to cultural and ethnic characteristics of the sample.\n\nDevelopment of a website and biobank database for the Nanosized Cancer Polymarker Biochip Project: a Multicenter Italian Experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeon, Antonette E; Fabricio, Aline S C; BenvegnÃ¹, Fabio; Michilin, Silvia; Secco, Annamaria; Spangaro, Omar; Meo, Sabrina; Gion, Massimo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Nanosized Cancer Polymarker Biochip Project (RBLA03S4SP) funded by an Italian MIUR-FIRB grant (Italian Ministry of University and Research - Investment Funds for Basic Research) has led to the creation of a free-access dynamic website, available at the web address https://serviziweb.ulss12.ve.it/firbabo, and of a centralized database with password-restricted access. The project network is composed of 9 research units (RUs) and has been active since 2005. The aim of the FIRB project was the design, production and validation of optoelectronic and chemoelectronic biosensors for the simultaneous detection of a novel class of cancer biomarkers associated with immunoglobulins of the M class (IgM) for early diagnosis of cancer. Biomarker immune complexes (BM-ICs) were assessed on samples of clinical cases and matched controls for breast, colorectal, liver, ovarian and prostate malignancies. This article describes in detail the architecture of the project website, the central database application, and the biobank developed for the FIRB Nanosized Cancer Polymarker Biochip Project. The article also illustrates many unique aspects that should be considered when developing a database within a multidisciplinary scenario. The main deliverables of the project were numerous, including the development of an online database which archived 1400 case report forms (700 cases and 700 matched controls) and more than 2700 experimental results relative to the BM-ICs assayed. The database also allowed for the traceability and retrieval of 21,000 aliquots archived in the centralized bank and stored as backup in the RUs, and for the development of a centralized biological bank in the coordinating unit with 6300 aliquots of serum. The constitution of the website and biobank database enabled optimal coordination of the RUs involved, highlighting the importance of sharing samples and scientific data in a multicenter setting for the achievement of the project goals.\n\nUndernutrition, risk of malnutrition and obesity in gastroenterological patients: A multicenter study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRizzi, Massimiliano; Mazzuoli, Silvia; Regano, Nunzia; Inguaggiato, Rosa; Bianco, Margherita; Leandro, Gioacchino; Bugianesi, Elisabetta; NoÃ¨, Donatella; Orzes, Nicoletta; Pallini, Paolo; Petroni, Maria Letizia; Testino, Gianni; Guglielmi, Francesco William\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAIM: To investigate the prevalence of undernutrition, risk of malnutrition and obesity in the Italian gastroenterological population. METHODS: The Italian Hospital Gastroenterology Association conducted an observational, cross-sectional multicenter study. Weight, weight loss, and body mass index were evaluated. Undernutrition was defined as unintentional weight loss > 10% in the last three-six months. Values of Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) > 2, NRS-2002 > 3, and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) from 17 to 25 identified risk of malnutrition in outpatients, inpatients and elderly patients, respectively. A body mass index â¥ 30 indicated obesity. Gastrointestinal pathologies were categorized into acute, chronic and neoplastic diseases. RESULTS: A total of 513 patients participated in the study. The prevalence of undernutrition was 4.6% in outpatients and 19.6% in inpatients. Moreover, undernutrition was present in 4.3% of the gastrointestinal patients with chronic disease, 11.0% of those with acute disease, and 17.6% of those with cancer. The risk of malnutrition increased progressively and significantly in chronic, acute and neoplastic gastrointestinal diseases in inpatients and the elderly population. Logistical regression analysis confirmed that cancer was a risk factor for undernutrition (OR = 2.7; 95%CI: 1.2-6.44, P = 0.02). Obesity and overweight were more frequent in outpatients. CONCLUSION: More than 63% of outpatients and 80% of inpatients in gastroenterological centers suffered from significant changes in body composition and required specific nutritional competence and treatment.

The Italian translation of the FSFI has been used in several studies conducted in Italy, but a linguistic validation of the Italian version does not exist. The aim of this study was to perform a linguistic validation of the Italian version of the FSFI. A multicenter cross-sectional study conducted in 14 urological and gynecological clinics, uniformly distributed over Italian territory. We performed all steps necessary to determine the reliability and the test-retest reliability of the Italian version of the FSFI. The study population was a convenience sample of 409 Italian women. The reliability of the questionnaire was calculated using Cronbach's alpha, which was considered weak, moderate, or high if its value was found less than 0.6, between 0.6 and 0.8, or equal to or greater than 0.8, respectively. The test-retest reliability was assessed for all women in the sample by calculating Pearson's concordance correlation coefficient for each domain and for the total score, both at baseline and after 15 days (r range between -1.00 to +1.00, where +1.00 indicates the strongest positive association). Cronbach's alpha coefficients for total and domain score were sufficiently high, ranging from 0.92 to 0.97 for the total sample. The test-retest procedure revealed that the concordance correlation coefficient was very high both for FSFI-I total score (Pearson's P = 0.93) and for each domain (Pearson's P always >0.92). For the first time in the literature, our study has produced a validated and reliable Italian version of the FSFI questionnaire. Consequently, the Italian FSFI can be used as a reliable tool for preliminary screening for female sexual dysfunction for Italian women.

Chemical parameters (hardness, free chlorine concentration, and trace element concentrations), water systems, and building characteristics were evaluated to study risk factors for colonization. The hot water systems of Italian hotels were strongly colonized by Legionella; 75% of the buildings examined and 60% of the water samples were contaminated, mainly at levels of â¥103 CFU literâ1, and Legionella pneumophila was the most frequently isolated species (87%). L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated from 45.8% of the contaminated sites and from 32.5% of the hotels examined. When a multivariate logistic model was used, only hotel age was associated with contamination, but the risk factors differed depending on the contaminating species and serogroup. Soft water with higher chlorine levels and higher temperatures were associated with L.âpneumophila serogroup 1 colonization, whereas the opposite was observed for serogroups 2 to 14. In conclusion, Italian hotels, particularly those located in old buildings, represent a major source of risk for Legionnaires' disease due to the high frequency of Legionella contamination, high germ concentration, and major L. pneumophila serogroup 1 colonization. The possible role of chlorine in favoring the survival of Legionella species is discussed.

Conflicting data regarding the prognostic association of MLBD in SLN-negative patients have been reported. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic role of MLBD in patients with negative SLN biopsy. Retrospective data from 656 melanoma patients who underwent a SLN biopsy (1991-2012) at six Italian centers were gathered in a multicenter database. MLBD was defined as lymphoscintigraphic and intraoperative identification of an SLN in more than one nodal basin. Clinical and pathologic variables were recorded and analyzed for their impact on survival. SLN-negative patients with MLBD were at lower risk of melanoma recurrence [hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, PÂ =Â 0.05) and melanoma-related death (HR 0.68, PÂ =Â 0.001) independent of common staging features. Multivariable Cox analyses of disease-free interval (DFI) and disease-specific survival (DSS) showed that MLBD maintained a favorable role and ulceration an unfavorable role. Histologic regression was independently associated only with DFI. When survival was stratified according to presence of MLBD, histologic regression and Breslow thickness <2Â mm were associated with improved DFI (5-year DFI: 96.9 vs. 66,1Â %, respectively; HR 0.48, PÂ <Â 0.001) and DSS (5-year DSS: 96.7 vs. 71.8Â %, respectively; HR 0.52, PÂ =Â 0.005) compared to patients without these three favorable parameters. Patients with negative SLN biopsy results have better prognosis when two or more lymphatic basins are identified and analyzed. Further research is required to investigate the mechanisms behind this evidence.\n\n[MISSCARE Survey - Italian Version: findings from an Italian validation study].\n\nPubMed\n\nSist, Luisa; Contini, Carla; Bandini, Anna; Bandini, Stefania; Massa, Licia; Zanin, Roberta; Maricchio, Rita; Gianesini, Gloria; Bassi, Erika; Tartaglini, Daniela; Palese, Alvisa; Ferraresi, Annamaria\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Missed Nursing Care (MNC) refers to nursing interventions that are not completed, partially completed, or postponed. Despite the relevance of MNC, no assessment tools are available in the Italian context, and no data regarding the occurrence of this phenomenon has been documented on a large scale to date. The study aims were: (1) to validate the Italian version of the MISSCARE Survey tool; (2) to measure the prevalence of missed interventions and reasons for missed care as perceived by clinical nurses working in Italian health care settings. After having conducted the forward and backward translation, pre-pilot and pilot phases were developed to ensure face and content validity as well as semantic and conceptual equivalence of the Italian version with the original version. The MISSCARE survey questionnaire was then distributed to 1,233 clinical nurses of whom 1,003 completed the questionnaire. Overall, 979 questionnaires were analysed. The questionnaires were completed from January to March 2012, by nurses working in medical and surgical hospital departments in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. Construct validity and internal consistency of the instrument were assessed. The face and content validity were ascertained by a group of experts. The instrument acceptability was good given that 79.4% of respondents replied to all items. Construct validity was investigated by an Exploratory Factor Analysis. Four factors explaining 64.18% of variance emerged: communication, lack of facilities/supplies, lack of staff, and unexpected events. Internal consistency, evaluated with Cronbach a, was 0.94. The nursing interventions omitted with greater frequency were, in order: ambulation (74.8%), passive mobilization (69.6%) and oral care (51.3%). The three main reasons for missed interventions were: an unexpected increase in the number of patients (90.5%), increased instability of the clinical condition (86.1%) and insufficient human resources (85.5%).

On the other hand, a lower representation of task-oriented coping style was found in mothers of DD children ( p â<â0.001) in comparison to mothers of control-children. Our study shows the clinical relevance of the burden carried by the mothers of children affected by DD and suggests the importance to assess parents, particularly mothers, to improve family compliance and clinical management of this disorder.\n\nMulticenter AIDS Cohort Study Quantitative Coronary Plaque Progression Study: rationale and design.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakanishi, Rine; Post, Wendy S; Osawa, Kazuhiro; Jayawardena, Eranthi; Kim, Michael; Sheidaee, Nasim; Nezarat, Negin; Rahmani, Sina; Kim, Nicholas; Hathiramani, Nicolai; Susarla, Shriraj; Palella, Frank; Witt, Mallory; Blaha, Michael J; Brown, Todd T; Kingsley, Lawrence; Haberlen, Sabina A; Dailing, Christopher; Budoff, Matthew J\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe association of HIV with coronary atherosclerosis has been established; however, the progression of coronary atherosclerosis over time among participants with HIV is not well known. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study Quantitative Coronary Plaque Progression Study is a large prospective multicenter study quantifying progression of coronary plaque assessed by serial coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). HIV-infected and uninfected men who were enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study Cardiovascular Substudy were eligible to complete a follow-up contrast coronary CTA 3-6 years after baseline. We measured coronary plaque volume and characteristics (calcified and noncalcified plaque including fibrous, fibrous-fatty, and low attenuation) and vulnerable plaque among HIV-infected and uninfected men using semiautomated plaque software to investigate the progression of coronary atherosclerosis over time. We describe a novel, large prospective multicenter study investigating incidence, transition of characteristics, and progression in coronary atherosclerosis quantitatively assessed by serial coronary CTAs among HIV-infected and uninfected men.\n\nStakeholders' views on data sharing in multicenter studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nMazor, Kathleen M; Richards, Allison; Gallagher, Mia; Arterburn, David E; Raebel, Marsha A; Nowell, W Benjamin; Curtis, Jeffrey R; Paolino, Andrea R; Toh, Sengwee\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTo understand stakeholders' views on data sharing in multicenter comparative effectiveness research studies and the value of privacy-protecting methods. Semistructured interviews with five US stakeholder groups. We completed 11 interviews, involving patients (nÂ =Â 15), researchers (nÂ =Â 10), Institutional Review Board and regulatory staff (nÂ =Â 3), multicenter research governance experts (nÂ =Â 2) and healthcare system leaders (nÂ =Â 4). Perceptions of the benefits and value of research were the strongest influences toward data sharing; cost and security risks were primary influences against sharing. Privacy-protecting methods that share summary-level data were acknowledged as being appealing, but there were concerns about increased cost and potential loss of research validity. Stakeholders were open to data sharing in multicenter studies that offer value and minimize security risks.\n\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: analysis of germline MEN1 mutations in the Italian multicenter MEN1 patient database.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarini, Francesca; Giusti, Francesca; Fossi, Caterina; Cioppi, Federica; Cianferotti, Luisella; Masi, Laura; Boaretto, Francesca; Zovato, Stefania; Cetani, Filomena; Colao, Annamaria; DavÃ¬, Maria Vittoria; Faggiano, Antongiulio; Fanciulli, Giuseppe; Ferolla, Piero; Ferone, Diego; Loli, Paola; Mantero, Franco; Marcocci, Claudio; Opocher, Giuseppe; Beck-Peccoz, Paolo; Persani, Luca; Scillitani, Alfredo; Guizzardi, Fabiana; Spada, Anna; Tomassetti, Paola; Tonelli, Francesco; Brandi, Maria Luisa\n\n2018-03-01\n\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is caused by germline inactivating mutations of the MEN1 gene. Currently, no direct genotype-phenotype correlation is identified. We aim to analyze MEN1 mutation site and features, and possible correlations between the mutation type and/or the affected menin functional domain and clinical presentation in patients from the Italian multicenter MEN1 database, one of the largest worldwide MEN1 mutation series published to date. The study included the analysis of MEN1 mutation profile in 410 MEN1 patients [370 familial cases from 123 different pedigrees (48 still asymptomatic at the time of this study) and 40 single cases]. We identified 99 different mutations: 41 frameshift [small intra-exon deletions (28) or insertions (13)], 13 nonsense, 26 missense and 11 splicing site mutations, 4 in-frame small deletions, and 4 intragenic large deletions spanning more than one exon. One family had two different inactivating MEN1 mutations on the same allele. Gastro-entero-pancreatic tumors resulted more frequent in patients with a nonsense mutation, and thoracic neuroendocrine tumors in individuals bearing a splicing-site mutation. Our data regarding mutation type frequency and distribution are in accordance with previously published data: MEN1 mutations are scattered through the entire coding region, and truncating mutations are the most common in MEN1 syndrome. A specific direct correlation between MEN1 genotype and clinical phenotype was not found in all our families, and wide intra-familial clinical variability and variable disease penetrance were both confirmed, suggesting a role for modifying, still undetermined, factors, explaining the variable MEN1 tumorigenesis.\n\nPros-IT CNR: an Italian prostate cancer monitoring project.\n\nPubMed\n\nNoale, Marianna; Maggi, Stefania; Artibani, Walter; Bassi, Pier Francesco; Bertoni, Filippo; Bracarda, Sergio; Conti, Giario Natale; CorvÃ², Renzo; Gacci, Mauro; Graziotti, Pierpaolo; Magrini, Stefano Maria; Maurizi Enrici, Riccardo; Mirone, Vincenzo; Montironi, Rodolfo; Muto, Giovanni; Pecoraro, Stefano; Porreca, Angelo; Ricardi, Umberto; Tubaro, Andrea; Zagonel, Vittorina; Zattoni, Filiberto; Crepaldi, Gaetano\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Pros-IT CNR project aims to monitor a sample of Italian males â¥18Â years of age who have been diagnosed in the participating centers with incident prostate cancer, by analyzing their clinical features, treatment protocols and outcome results in relation to quality of life. Pros-IT CNR is an observational, prospective, multicenter study. The National Research Council (CNR), Neuroscience Institute, Aging Branch (Padua) is the promoting center. Ninety-seven Italian centers located throughout Italy were involved. The field study began in September 1, 2014. Subjects eligible were diagnosed with biopsy-verified prostate cancer, naÃ¯ve. A sample size of 1500 patients was contemplated. A baseline assessment including anamnestic data, clinical history, risk factors, the initial diagnosis, cancer staging information and quality of life (Italian UCLA Prostate Cancer Index; SF-12 Scale) was completed. Six months after the initial diagnosis, a second assessment evaluating the patient's health status, the treatment carried out, and the quality of life will be made. A third assessment, evaluating the treatment follow-up and the quality of life, will be made 12Â months after the initial diagnosis. The 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th assessments, similar to the third, will be completed 24, 36, 48 and 60Â months after the initial diagnosis, respectively, and will include also a Food Frequency Questionnaire and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly. The study will provide information on patients' quality of life and its variations over time in relation to the treatments received for the prostate cancer.\n\nPathological Gambling among Italian Nursing Students.\n\nPubMed\n\nCicolini, Giancarlo; Della Pelle, Carlo; Simonetti, Valentina; Comparcini, Dania; Sepede, Gianna; Cipollone, Francesco\n\n2018-04-01\n\nTo investigate the role of psychiatric dimensions, behavioral or substance addictions and demographical variables as determinants of pathological gambling among nursing students. Multicenter cross-sectional study. From June to October 2015 a survey was carried out among Italian Nursing students. Data were collected using a six-section tool. Nursing students who completed the survey numbered 1083, 902 (83.3%) had some problems with gambling and 29 (2.7%) showed pathological gambling. Percentage of pathological gambling was significantly associate with illicit drug/alcohol use (65.5%; p=0.001) and with male gender (58.6%) comparing to student nurse with non-pathological gambling (20%) and those with some problem (24.2%). Significant main effect was observed for IAT score (Beta=0.119, t=3.28, p=0.001): higher IAT scores were associated with higher SOGS scores. Italian nursing students have some problems with gambling and pathological gambling problem, and males are those who have more problems. Results might be useful for faculties of health professionals to identify students at risk in an early stage, to direct prevention tailored interventions. Nursing faculties should be aware of the prevalence of Gambling among students. Prevention interventions should be planned to minimize the risk of gambling behavior in the future nurses' health care workers. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A controversial association of bisphosphonate use and risk of atrial fibrillation has been reported. In our study, current alendronate users were associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation as compared with those who had stopped bisphosphonate (BP) therapy for more than 1 year. Bisphosphonates are widely used to prevent bone fractures. Controversial findings regarding the association between bisphosphonate use and the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) have been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of AF in association with BP exposure. We performed a nested case-control study using the databases of drug-dispensing and hospital discharge diagnoses from five Italian regions. The data cover a period ranging from July 1, 2003 to December 31, 2006. The study population comprised new users of bisphosphonates aged 55 years and older. Patients were followed from the first BP prescription until an occurrence of an AF diagnosis (index date, i.e., ID), cancer, death, or the end of the study period, whichever came first. For the risk estimation, any AF case was matched by age and sex to up to 10 controls from the same source population. A conditional logistic regression was performed to obtain the odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The BP exposure was classified into current (<90 days prior to ID), recent (91-180), past (181-364), and distant past (â¥365) use, with the latter category being used as a reference point. A subgroup analysis by individual BP was then carried out. In comparison with distant past users of BP, current users of BP showed an almost twofold increased risk of AF: odds ratio (OR)â=â1.78 and 95% CIâ=â1.46-2.16. Specifically, alendronate users were mostly associated with AF as compared with distant past use of BP (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.59-2.43). In our nested case-control study, current users of BP are associated with a higher risk of atrial\n\nSpelling Acquisition in English and Italian: A Cross-Linguistic Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarinelli, Chiara V; Romani, Cristina; Burani, Cristina; Zoccolotti, Pierluigi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe examined the spelling acquisition in children up to late primary school of a consistent orthography (Italian) and an inconsistent orthography (English). The effects of frequency, lexicality, length, and regularity in modulating spelling performance of the two groups were examined. English and Italian children were matched for both chronological age and number of years of schooling. Two-hundred and seven Italian children and 79 English children took part in the study. We found greater accuracy in spelling in Italian than English children: Italian children were very accurate after only 2 years of schooling, while in English children the spelling performance was still poor after 5 years of schooling. Cross-linguistic differences in spelling accuracy proved to be more persistent than the corresponding ones in reading accuracy. Orthographic consistency produced not only quantitative, but also qualitative differences, with larger frequency and regularity effects in English than in Italian children.\n\nSpelling Acquisition in English and Italian: A Cross-Linguistic Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMarinelli, Chiara V.; Romani, Cristina; Burani, Cristina; Zoccolotti, Pierluigi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe examined the spelling acquisition in children up to late primary school of a consistent orthography (Italian) and an inconsistent orthography (English).

This study presents a multicenter characterization of MLC-defined small field for Elekta and Varian linear accelerators. Measurements were performed using the Exradin W1 plastic scintillator detector. The project enrolled 24 Italian centers. Each center performed Tissue Phantom Ratio (TPR), in-plane and cross-plane dose profiles of 0.8Ã0.8cm 2 field, and Output Factor (OF) measurements for square field sizes ranging from 0.8 to 10cm. Set-up conditions were 10cm depth in water phantom at SSD 90cm. Measurements were performed using two twin Exradin W1 plastic scintillator detectors (PSD) correcting for the Cerenkov effect as proposed by the manufacturer. Data analysis from 12 Varian and 12 Elekta centers was performed. Measurements of 7 centers were not included due to cable problems. TPR measurements showed standard deviations (SD)<1%; SD<0.4mm for the profile penumbra was obtained, while FWHM measurements showed SD<0.5mm. OF measurements showed SD<1.5% for field size greater than 2Ã2cm 2 . Median OFs values were in agreement with the recent bibliography. High degree of consistency was registered for all the considered parameters. This work confirmed the importance of multicenter dosimetric intercomparison. W1 PSD could be considered as a good candidate for small field measurements. Copyright Â© 2017 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Prospective, multicenter study. Four medical/surgical Italian PICUs in three tertiary hospitals. Families of children, 0-16 years old, admitted to the PICUs were invited to participate. Inclusion criteria were PICU length of stay greater than 24 hours and good comprehension of Italian language by parents/guardians. Exclusion criteria were readmission within 6 months and parents of a child who died in the PICU. Distribution, at PICU discharge, of the EMpowerment of PArents in THe Intensive Care questionnaire with 65 items divided into five domains and a six-point rating scale: 1 \" certainly no\" to 6 \"certainly yes.\" Back and forward translations of the EMpowerment of PArents in THe Intensive Care questionnaire between Dutch (original version) and Italian languages were deployed. Cultural adaptation of the instrument was confirmed by a consultation with a representative parent group (n = 10). Totally, 150 of 190 parents (79%) participated in the study. On item level, 12 statements scored a mean below 5.0. The Cronbach's Î±, measured for internal consistency, on domain level was between 0.67 and 0.96. Congruent validity was measured by correlating the five domains with four gold standard satisfaction measures and showed adequate correlations (rs, 0.41-0.71; p < 0.05). No significant differences occurred in the nondifferential validity testing between three children's characteristics and the domains; excepting parents with a child for a surgical and planned admission were more satisfied on information and organization issues. The Italian version of the EMpowerment of PArents in THe Intensive Care questionnaire has satisfactory reliability and validity estimates and seems to be appropriate for Italian PICU setting. It is an important instrument providing benchmark data to be used in the process of quality improvement\n\nUAIS Unruptured Aneurysms Italian Study (Dedicated to Massimo Collice).\n\nPubMed\n\nMaira, Giulio; Mannino, Stefano; D'Aliberti, Giuseppe; Albanese, Alessio; Sabatino, Giovanni; Delfini, Roberto; Tomasello, Francesco; Alafaci, Concetta; Marchese, Enrico\n\n2018-02-23\n\nUnruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) are increasingly identified and are an important health-care burden; in the past they were commonly treated by surgical clipping, but nowadays endovascular coil embolization is increasingly employed as an alternative. The Unruptured Aneurysms Italian Study (UAIS) is a multicentric cooperative prospective study aimed to delineate the \"State of the Art\" of UIAs treatment in Italy. 51 Italian Neurosurgical and Neuroradiological Units, representatives of all 20 Italian regions are involved in the Study. UAIS started on June 2003 and ended on July 2007. 1138 patients were collected by that date, but 181 were ruled-out due to severe violation of the protocol; 957 had complete data and could be statistically evaluated. UAIS demonstrates that the treatment of UAs, as performed in Italy as a Nation, is effective in improving long-term outcome vs natural history, particularly in aneurysms larger than 7 mm.\n\nThe pediatric heart network: meeting the challenges to multicenter studies in pediatric heart disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBurns, Kristin M.; Pemberton, Victoria L.; Pearson, Gail D.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose of review Because of the relatively small numbers of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease cared for in any individual center, there is a significant need for multicenter clinical studies to validate new medical or surgical therapies.

Aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of MCI, its subtypes, and rates of conversion to dementia 1Â year later in an elderly Italian population. The data are based on an Italian multicenter population-based cohort study with both cross-sectional and longitudinal components. Two thousand three hundred thirty-seven individuals over 65 underwent screening, clinical confirmation and 1-year follow-up. The prevalence of MCI was 21.6% and the amnestic multiple domain was the most frequent subtype (63.2%). The conversion rate to dementia was 4.1% and was found only in the amnestic multiple domain and in the unclassifiable subjects, persons with cognitive deficit but neither demented nor with MCI. The prevalence of MCI in this population sample was similar to that found in other population studies using Petersen's modified MCI criteria as well as his original criteria. With regard to conversion to dementia, our results emphasize the importance to better classify the unclassifiable subjects at high risk of progression to dementia and also at risk of being undiagnosed and untreated. MCI is characterized by extreme variability and instability. Data on the prevalence and the rate of conversion from MCI to dementia are difficult to compare given the important differences from study to study especially with regard to the diagnostic criteria utilized and their operationalization.\n\nDepressive Symptoms Correlate with Disability and Disease Course in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: An Italian Multi-Center Study Using the Beck Depression Inventory.\n\nPubMed\n\nSolaro, C; Trabucco, E; Signori, A; Martinelli, V; Radaelli, M; Centonze, D; Rossi, S; Grasso, M G; Clemenzi, A; Bonavita, S; D'Ambrosio, A; Patti, F; D'Amico, E; Cruccu, G; Truini, A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDepression occurs in about 50% of patients with multiple sclerosis. The aims of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a multicenter MS population using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) and to identify possible correlations between the BDI II score and demographic and clinical variables. Data were collected in a multi-center, cross-sectional study over a period of six months in six MS centers in Italy using BDI II. 1,011 MS patients participated in the study. 676 subjects were female, with a mean age of 34 years (SD 10.8), mean EDSS of 3.3 (0-8.5) and mean disease duration of 10.3 years (range 1-50 years). 668 (%) subjects scored lower than 14 on the BDI II and 343 (33.9%) scored greater than 14 (14 cut-off score). For patients with BDI>14 multivariate analysis showed a significant difference between EDSS and disease course. BDI II scores for subjects with secondary progressive (SP) MS were significantly different from primary progressive (PP) patients (p < 0.001) but similar to relapsing-remitting (RR) patients. Considering subjects with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (BDI II score from 20-63), in relation to disease course, 11.7% (83/710) had RR MS, 40.7% (96/236) SP and 13.6% (6/44) PP. Using the BDI II, 30% of the current sample had depressive symptoms. BDI II score correlates with disability and disease course, particularly in subjects with SP MS. The BDI II scale can be a useful tool in clinical practice to screen depressive symptoms in people with MS.\n\nA Bibliography of Italian Studies in North America\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCherubini, Jon C., Comp.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThis quarterly bibliography of Italian studies in North America includes books, bibliographies, and reviews of comparative literature studies, translations, and publications on art, music, philosophy, history, cinema, and sociology, which are closely related to literature.

The aim of this study was to compare the adherence of Italian endocrinologists to the ATA/AACE and ETA guidelines on the management of newly diagnosed primary hypothyroidism and to validate the Italian version of the Morisky-Green Medical Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) questionnaire as applied to the evaluation of the adherence of patients with hypothyroidism to LT4 treatment. This was an observational, longitudinal, multicenter, cohort study, involving 12 Italian Units of Endocrinology. The study enrolled 1,039 consecutive outpatients (mean age 48 years; 855 women, 184 men). The concordance of Italian endocrinologists with American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American Thyroid Association (AACE/ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) recommendations was comparable (77.1% and 71.7%) and increased (86.7 and 88.6%) after the recommendations on LT4 dose were excluded, considering only the remaining recommendations on diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up. The MMAS-8 was filled out by 293 patients. The mean score was 6.71 with 23.9% low (score <6), 38.6% medium (6 to <8), 37.5% highly (= 8) adherers; the internal validation coefficient was 0.613. Highly adherent patients were not more likely to have good control of hypothyroidism compared with either medium (69% versus 72%, P = .878) or low (69% versus 43%, P = .861) adherers. Clinical management of hypothyroidism in Italy demonstrated an observance of international guidelines by Italian endocrinologists. Validation of the Italian version of the MMAS-8 questionnaire provides clinicians with a reliable and simple tool for assessing the adherence of patients to LT4 treatment.

The feasibility of providing an experimental OF data set, useful for on-site measurements validation, was also evaluated. This work was performed in the framework of the Italian Association of Medical Physics (AIFM) SBRT working group. The project was subdivided in two phases: in the first phase each center measured OFs using their own routine detector for nominal field sizes ranging from 10Ã10cm 2 to 0.6Ã0.6cm 2 . In the second phase, the measurements were repeated in all centers using the PTW 60019 microDiamond detector. The project enrolled 30 Italian centers. Micro-ion chambers and silicon diodes were used for OF measurements in 24 and 6 centers respectively. Gafchromic films and TLDs were used for very small field OFs in 3 and 1 centers. Regarding the measurements performed with the user's detectors, OF standard deviations (SD) for field sizes down to 2Ã2cm 2 were in all cases <2.7%. In the second phase, a reduction of around 50% of the SD was obtained using the microDiamond detector. The measured values presented in this multicenter study provide a consistent dataset for OFs that could be a useful tool for improving dosimetric procedures in centers. The microDiamond data present a small variation among the centers confirming that this detector can contribute to improve overall accuracy in radiotherapy.

The purpose of this study was to report complications by using this technique in patients with focal liver cancer. Methods: Members of 14 Italian centers used a 2.45-GMHz generator delivering energy through a cooled miniature-choke MW antenna and a standardized protocol for follow-up. They completed a questionnaire regarding number and type of deaths, major and minor complications and side effects, and likelihood of their relationship to the procedure. Enrollment included 736 patients with 1.037 lesions: 522 had hepatocellularmoreÂ Â» carcinoma with cirrhosis, 187 had metastases predominantly from colorectal cancer, and 27 had cholangiocellular carcinoma. Tumor size ranged from 0.5 to 10 cm. In 13 centers, the approach used was percutaneous, in 4 videolaparoscopic, and in 3 laparotomic. Results: No deaths were reported. Major complications occurred in 22 cases (2.9%), and minor complications in 54 patients (7.3%). Complications of MWA do not differ from those RFA, both being based on the heat damage. Conclusion: Results of this multicenter study confirmed those of single-center experiences, indicating that MWA is a safe procedure, with no mortality and a low rate of major complications. The low rate of complications was probably due to precautions adopted, knowing in advance possible risk conditions, on the basis of prior RFA experience.Â«Â less\n\nExploring American and Italian consumer preferences for Californian and Italian red wines.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorri, Luisa; Noble, Ann Curtis; Heymann, Hildegarde\n\n2013-06-01\n\nTo increase the market share of Californian wines in other countries, wine preferences need to be explored in potential markets. This work studied the preferences of American and Italian consumers for red wines produced in California and Italy, focusing on wines made from the same varieties in each location. Descriptive analysis and consumer preference tests were performed. Americans scored each of the Californian wines significantly higher in preference than the Italian wines. In contrast, the Italian consumer preference scores for many Italian and Californian wines overlapped. By external preference mapping of the American consumer segments, the ideal flavour of one cluster was closest to the Californian Zinfandel, Merlot and Syrah, which had the 'most balanced' flavour profiles. Another cluster of Italians also preferred the Californian wines. In addition, one Italian cluster was driven by a dislike of the leather, band-aid and medicinal aromas of the Italian Merlot and Refosco. The results provided information that can contribute to wine marketing research necessary for successfully exporting Californian red wines to Italy and vice versa.

The principal aim of this study was to establish the psychometric performance of the Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN) scale in its Italian version and to assess, through the SWN scale, the subjective experience of stabilized psychotic outpatients in maintenance with APs. The original short version of SWN, consisting of 20 items, was back translated, and a focus group was also conducted to better improve the comprehension of the scale. The results showed a good performance of the Italian version of the SWN as documented by the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha; 0.85). A satisfactory subjective experience was reported in the sample of schizophrenic outpatients interviewed (SWN mean total score: 84.95, SD: 17.5). The performance of the SWN scale in the present study was very similar to that reported by Naber et al. in the original validation study. Large multi-center studies are needed to better establish differences in the subjective experience of schizophrenic patients treated with first- and second-generation APs.\n\nLinguistic, geographic and genetic isolation: a collaborative study of Italian populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nCapocasa, Marco; Anagnostou, Paolo; Bachis, Valeria; Battaggia, Cinzia; Bertoncini, Stefania; Biondi, Gianfranco; Boattini, Alessio; Boschi, Ilaria; Brisighelli, Francesca; CalÃ³, Carla Maria; Carta, Marilisa; Coia, Valentina; Corrias, Laura; Crivellaro, Federica; De Fanti, Sara; Dominici, Valentina; Ferri, Gianmarco; Francalacci, Paolo; Franceschi, Zelda Alice; Luiselli, Donata; Morelli, Laura; Paoli, Giorgio; Rickards, Olga; Robledo, Renato; Sanna, Daria; Sanna, Emanuele; Sarno, Stefania; Sineo, Luca; Taglioli, Luca; Tagarelli, Giuseppe; Tofanelli, Sergio; Vona, Giuseppe; Pettener, Davide; Destro Bisol, Giovanni\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe animal and plant biodiversity of the Italian territory is known to be one of the richest in the Mediterranean basin and Europe as a whole, but does the genetic diversity of extant human populations show a comparable pattern? According to a number of studies, the genetic structure of Italian populations retains the signatures of complex peopling processes which took place from the Paleolithic to modern era. Although the observed patterns highlight a remarkable degree of genetic heterogeneity, they do not, however, take into account an important source of variation. In fact, Italy is home to numerous ethnolinguistic minorities which have yet to be studied systematically. Due to their difference in geographical origin and demographic history, such groups not only signal the cultural and social diversity of our country, but they are also potential contributors to its bio-anthropological heterogeneity. To fill this gap, research groups from four Italian Universities (Bologna, Cagliari, Pisa and Roma Sapienza) started a collaborative study in 2007, which was funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research and received partial support by the Istituto Italiano di Antropologia. In this paper, we present an account of the results obtained in the course of this initiative. Four case-studies relative to linguistic minorities from the Eastern Alps, Sardinia, Apennines and Southern Italy are first described and discussed, focusing on their micro-evolutionary and anthropological implications. Thereafter, we present the results of a systematic analysis of the relations between linguistic, geographic and genetic isolation. Integrating the data obtained in the course of the long-term study with literature and unpublished results on Italian populations, we show that a combination of linguistic and geographic factors is probably responsible for the presence of the most robust signatures of genetic isolation. Finally, we evaluate the magnitude of the diversity\n\nMulticenter Case-Control Study on Restless Legs Syndrome in Multiple Sclerosis: the REMS Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nManconi, Mauro; Ferini-Strambi, Luigi; Filippi, Massimo; Bonanni, Enrica; Iudice, Alfonso; Murri, Luigi; Gigli, Gian Luigi; Fratticci, Lara; Merlino, Giovanni; Terzano, Giovanni; Granella, Franco; Parrino, Liborio; Silvestri, Rosalia; AricÃ², Irene; Dattola, Vincenzo; Russo, Giovanna; Luongo, Carmela; Cicolin, Alessandro; Tribolo, Antonella; Cavalla, Paola; Savarese, Mariantonietta; Trojano, Maria; Ottaviano, Salvatore; Cirignotta, Fabio; Simioni, Valentina; Salvi, Fabrizio; Mondino, Fiorella; Perla, Franco; Chinaglia, Giorgia; Zuliani, Cristina; Cesnik, Edward; Granieri, Enrico; Placidi, Fabio; Palmieri, Maria Giuseppina; Manni, Raffaele; Terzaghi, Michele; Bergamaschi, Roberto; Rocchi, Raffaele; Ulivelli, Monica; Bartalini, Sabina; Ferri, Raffaele; Fermo, Salvatore Lo; Ubiali, Emilio; Viscardi, Massimo; Rottoli, Mariarosa; Nobili, Lino; Protti, Alessandra; Ferrillo, Franco; Allena, Marta; Mancardi, Gianluigi; Guarnieri, Biancamaria; Londrillo, Francesco\n\n2008-01-01\n\nStudy objectives: To verify the existence of a symptomatic form of restless legs syndrome (RLS) secondary to multiple sclerosis (MS) and to identify possible associated risk factors. Design: Prospective, multicenter, case-control epidemiologic survey. Settings: Twenty sleep centers certified by the Italian Association of Sleep Medicine. Patients: Eight hundred and sixty-one patients affected by MS and 649 control subjects. Interventions: N/A. Measures and results: Data regarding demographic and clinical factors, presence and severity of RLS, the results of hematologic tests, and visual analysis of cerebrospinal magnetic resonance imaging studies were collected. The prevalence of RLS was 19% in MS and 4.2% in control subjects, with a risk to be affected by RLS of 5.4 (95%confidence interval: 3.56â8.26) times greater for patients with MS than for control subjects. In patients with MS, the following risk factors for RLS were significant: older age; longer MS duration; the primary progressive MS form; higher global, pyramidal, and se"
