        "text": "1615\n\n400 Conejos\n\nNumber one among Mexican mezcals, 400 Conejos is synonymous with quality artisanal mezcal produced solely from Espadin agave. Born as a tribute to the ancient Mesoamerican traditions which only allowed priests to establish a channel of communication with the divine, which were based on the ritual consumption of drinks obtained from agave. The gods of these drinks were called \"centzon-totchtin\", or 400 rabbits, in the Nahuatl language, which evoked the idea of a very large and incalculable number. Each bottle would have contained the essence of one of these spirits, each characterized by its own personality. Those who drank an agave distillate, therefore, would have been monitored by one of the 400 rabbits, without knowing which rabbit it was.\n\n400 Conigli\n\n7 Engenhos\n\n9 di Dante\n\nA. Robert\n\nAalto\n\nAalto\n\nAbadia Retuerta\n\nAbadia Retuerta\n\nAbbazia di Novacella\n\nThe Novacella Abbey is located in the northernmost wine-growing area of Italy, the Isarco Valley, in South Tyrol . In these places, the altitude, the cool climate and the soils rich in minerals allow the optimal development of the aromas and taste of the typical white wines of the area. The Abbey has been producing wines since 1142; a tradition with ancient origins today combined with the most advanced technologies, an innate passion for wine and great professionalism contribute to the creation of wines with a strong personality, joyful and quality. Novacella Abbey: in the best crus of the Isarco Valley The Abbazia di Novacella company cultivates its grapes in the best crus of the Isarco Valley, where the microclimate is very particular. This is in fact the northernmost area of Italy, where the altitude creates strong temperature variations, which enrich the grapes with extraordinarily intense aromas, but which are mitigated by the so-called \"Ora del Garda\" a warm wind that caresses the vineyards every day with the mild air of Lake Garda, with a beneficial effect on the production of the grapes. White wine: the best of Abbazia di Novacella Abbazia di Novacella is famous above all for white wines, which in this area are able to express the maximum of aromas. Vines such as Riesling , Sylvaner , and above all aromatic grapes such as Gew√ºrztraminer and Kerner are able to express all their innate elegance and complexity of aromas.

What are the best wines of Abbazia di Novacella? Among the best wines of Abbazia di Novacella are the Praepositus Kerner, awarded every year by the best national and international guides, and the Praepositus Riesling, one of the highest expressions of South Tyrolean Riesling. Does the Novacella Abbey also produce red wines? The Novacella Abbey is famous for white wines but also has a production of red wines, obtained from the typical South Tyrolean vines such as Schiava and Lagrein but also from international grapes such as Pinot Noir . How can you combine the Gew√ºrztraminer from Abbazia di Novacella? The Gew√ºrztraminer from Abbazia di Novacella goes well with all the aromatic and spicy dishes of oriental cuisine, but also with sweet and sour dishes of our local tradition. Also ideal as an aperitif to accompany spicy dip and complex dishes.\n\nAberfeldy\n\nAberfeldy Distillery was founded in 1896 in Perth County, Highland , by the sons of John Dewar, a well-known blended whiskey producer. A distinctive feature of this whiskey is that it is obtained with the pure water of the Pitilie Burn stream that flows not far from the distillery and flows into the River Tay: this stream has always been known for the content of its alluvial gold bed, this is why Aberfeldy whiskeys are often referred to as Golden Dram. The production process is slow and laborious, which sets Aberfeldy apart from other Scottish distilleries. The long fermentation in larch washbacks gives it typical honey notes while the double aging seals its incredible softness. Today Aberfeldy whiskeys are known worldwide as single malt whiskeys but still contribute their honey notes to the flavor of Dewar's blended whiskey. Aberfeldy whiskey Whiskey Aberfeldy has been able to reach the highest levels and was awarded at the World Spirit Competition in San Francisco with the Double Gold Medal at the Highland Single Malt Scotch Whiskey Guranteed 12 Years in Oak Aberfeldy (aged for 12 years in oak barrels). The same recognition was given to the precious Highland Single Malt Scotch Whiskey Guaranteed 21 Years in Oak Aberfeldy, the rich and full-bodied Single Malt, aged in ex-Bourbon barrels and distilled in a discontinuous alembic still. These are precious and complex whiskeys, in which the intense golden yellow color anticipates the rich range of aromatic fragrances, which amazes with hints of fruit jam and honey that alternate with notes of tobacco, vanilla and nutmeg and announces a complex taste and enveloping, worthy of precious spirits such as gold. Was Aberfeldy born in Scotland? Aberfeldy was born in the heart of Scotland, and more precisely in the Highlands. What awards has the Aberfeldy 12 received? Aberfeldy 12 received the Double Gold Medal at the World Spirit Competition in San Francisco.\n\nAberlour\n\nThe village of Aberlour is located in the center of Speyside, nestled in the legendary and magnificent landscape of the Highlands of Ben Rinnes. Here, along the banks of the River Spey is Aberlour, a small and familiar distillery that has become a legend for malt lovers. Already since 1879, with the founder James Fleming, the distillery has distinguished itself for the quality of its whiskeys, produced using the purest spring water flowing along the River Spey and processed by the craftsmanship of the masters of the Aberlour house, through the use of selected barrels, which gave life to single malt whiskeys of undisputed quality.\n\nAbsolut\n\nAbsolut is an already famous and well-established reality, whose origins date back well over 100 years ago in the small town of √Öhus, in the Swedish region of Scania. A strong bond with the territory and its farmers is the faith carried forward by Absolut, which produces its own Vodka by sourcing winter wheat exclusively from the farming families of the Scania community of about 300 companies. In a cooperative and sustainable way, through the use of non-invasive agricultural techniques, the use of selected yeasts and recycling everything possible from the production process - from the raw spirit to the glass of the bottles - the result is a quality of undisputed value, characteristic of a brand that now needs no introduction.\n\nAccomasso\n\nAccornero\n\nAchaval Ferrer\n\nAchaval Ferrer\n\nAdami\n\nAdami was born in 1920, when Abele Adami purchased a small vineyard from Count Balbi Valier. The winery is located in Colbertaldo, a hamlet of the municipality of Vidor, in the extraordinary wine-growing landscape between Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, a terroir known for the production of Prosecco. The cellar produces exclusively Prosecco, with a process that naturally develops carbon dioxide with the pressure necessary for the development of bubbles that give great finesse and persistence, transforming the wine into sparkling wine. Over time, Adami has obtained numerous national and international awards, which testify to the success of the quality of its wines.\n\nAdanti\n\nAdler von Klausen\n\nAdler Von Klausen was born in the charming town of Klausen, Chiusa, in the province of Bolzano, in the magical Valle Isarco, the beating heart of South Tyrol, a terroir traditionally extremely suited to viticulture, one of the most interesting regions in Europe for the production of white wines, with a variety of vines and microclimates declined on rugged slopes and steep slopes, which make viticulture almost a heroic undertaking. Adler von Klausen, literally, ‚Äúeagle of Chiusa‚Äù, is the symbol of the cellar that also stands out on the label and depicts the eagle, an animal that in symbolism represents cosmic power, absolute freedom and, therefore, life. The wines do not betray this expectation and fully embody the variety of terroirs of the Valle d'Isarco.\n\nAerstone\n\nAgricola La Portera\n\nAgripunica\n\nAgripunica, one of the best known and most renowned brands in the panorama of wine production in Sardinia and Italy, is located in Santadi, in the south-west of the island. This area, known as Southern Sulcis, represents the ideal environment for the production of great wines, thanks to a particularly favorable climate and a great brightness that allows the grapes to reach an optimal degree of ripeness. The company cultivates only grapes typical of the area. The two red wines of Agripunica are soft and elegant, with a delicate and round tannic outfit. The white wine is fresh and mineral, with fruity notes that make it particularly pleasant to drink.\n\nAgust√≠ Torell√≥ Mata\n\nAi Palazzi\n\nAlain Michelot\n\nAlbert Meyer\n\nAlbert Sounit\n\nAlberto Ballarin\n\nAlberto Nani\n\nAlfred Gratien\n\nAlice Bel Colle\n\nAlice Bel Colle is an interesting cooperative of Alto Monferrato, which produces quality wines with a typically territorial face. It was founded in 1955 and now it can count on a hundred members and a park of about 350 hectares, divided into 200 hectares of white muscat, 60 of brachetto, 50 of barbera and the remaining 40 divided between dolcetto, chardonnay, cortese and others. grapes of the territory. The estate is located in the splendid hilly area surrounding the village of Alice Bel Colle, a few kilometers north of Acqui Terme. The vines are cultivated at an altitude of over 400 meters above sea level, on splendid sunny aspects, always well ventilated. The richness of the cellar resides in a mosaic of small plots located in the most suitable areas of the territory, with different exposures, soils and microclimates, so that each variety can be grown in the most suitable place. The small plots are managed with care and artisanal passion, directly by the owners, who know their vineyards very well and know how to obtain excellent quality grapes. All harvests are strictly manual, with selection in the vineyard of the best grapes, perfectly ripe and healthy. The vinification takes place in the modern cellar equipped with cold rooms for pre-fermentation cryomacerations and stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature. In the first decades, production was mainly concentrated on Barbera and sweet wines produced with aromatic vines. Later a new range of wines was created that represents the territory very well, based on three historical grape varieties of Monferrato: barbera, brachetto and moscato. Today the Barbera vineyards are grown only in the best areas. The quantity has decreased a lot and at the same time the quality has grown at the same pace, with wines of great richness and aromatic concentration. The 360 ¬∞ Collection is the spearhead of the winery, produced with grapes from the most suitable vineyards and made with strict regulations, which provide for low yields per hectare. The attention of the winery is increasingly oriented towards the production of high quality labels, which can best enhance the varieties present for centuries in the area and the typical characteristics of the terroir. The supervision of the production is entrusted to the advice of Beppe Caviola, one of the most famous and expert Piedmontese oenologists. This is how genuine authentic wines are born, a true expression of a wonderful territory and ancient traditions.\n\nAlip√∫s\n\nAlip√∫s is the name of a range of agave espadin mezcal selected and bottled in the Los Danzantes distillery. But it is also the name of an initiative, of an idea, that of defending and protecting mezcalero, in order to maintain the production of mezcal an exclusive prerogative of the Oaxaca region. Its peculiarity is to have, for each edition, the name of the small town where the distillate is produced, in such a way as to make its terroir of origin unique, recognizable and absolutely exclusive. Here, masters with extreme experience and expertise, choose the agaves and, after having cooked them in ovens buried in the stone, they are milled with horse-drawn wheels on a stone floor: this craftsmanship ensures that fermentation takes place in completely natural way. The distillation then takes place in traditional copper stills. A craftsmanship that, pushed to extreme levels, guarantees the authenticity of the distillate, to preserve it at its best and make it inimitable.\n\nAllegrini\n\nLeading company of the Valpolicella Classica, Allegrini has been producing wine of the highest quality for over 400 years and is considered an absolute protagonist in the development of this wine area. Following the strenuous work conducted by Giovanni, the Allegrini family was able to gather his industrious spirit and passion, to embark on a road to enhance the viticultural and oenological heritage that this land had to offer. While remaining anchored to a rigorous tradition, the company has always shown itself to be a far-sighted winemaking reality and vigilant on the evolution of times and taste, succeeding with Franco Allegrini, today considered one of the greatest Italian winemakers, to bring significant innovations in the production of the key wines of Valpolicella Recioto and Amarone: a drying method has been adopted that is more careful to preserve the integrity of the grapes, the Ripasso technique has been revised which combines the traditional pomace with a part of grapes put to dry which enrich the product with aromatic complexity and elegance, the use of the barrique was introduced alongside the traditional Slavonian oak cask and the aging period was reduced in order to preserve the flavor and fruity aroma. Finally, in recent years, there has been the creation of a new, younger and fresher line, Corte Giara, with wines produced near Lake Garda and in other areas of Verona, easy to drink, more suitable for moments of conviviality. Allegrini also includes other companies within it: Villa della Torre, located in Fumane, where the family adventure began in 1854, Poggio al Tesoro and San Polo, which instead represent the transposition of the know-how of the prestigious reality of Valpolicella, respectively in the terroirs of Bolgheri and Montalcino.\n\nAlois Lageder\n\nFounded in 1823 in South Tyrol, Alois Lageder has always been synonymous with excellent quality and sustainability. Now in its fifth generation, the company stands out for its ability to blend tradition and innovation in complete harmony. Alois Lageder dedicates himself to viticulture in a biological-dynamic regime, following a philosophy inspired by the holistic approach. Every activity carried out on the estate is guided by a great respect for nature and the desire to exploit and make the most of the characteristics and qualities of each vineyard.\n\nAlpha Estate\n\nAlta Vista\n\nThe Alta Vista company was born from the idea of Count Patrick d'Aulan, heir to a family winemaking tradition of over 200 years, to combine French wisdom with a new and extraordinary territory for wine, that of the Argentine Andes. The Alta Vista vineyards are divided for 211 hectares in the terroir of the province west of Mendoza, at over 1000 meters of average altitude, with cutting-edge viticulture techniques studied in depth to leave nothing to chance: from diversified pruning to each vineyard being studied on the climate and the characteristics of the soil. International vines such as Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, in addition to Malbec - a vine that has more roots in Argentina - make up the Alta Vista production line, certainly among the most famous and appreciated expressions. of the terroir of Mendoza.\n\nAltemasi\n\nAltemasi is one of the most representative companies in the production of Trentodoc Metodo Classico, the Trentino sparkling wine characterized by finesse and elegance. At the origin of this prestigious belonging to the Trentodoc denomination is the processing of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir which, with the use of expert winemaking art and respecting long waiting times, manages to guarantee sparkling wines with a distinct and memorable flavour. Finesse and elegance depend in fact on the typical climatic conditions of the mountains and are recognizable in the 'highest farms' from which Altemasi takes its name. Various types of terrain and altitudes, as well as significant daily temperature variations, allow the wines to develop an aromatic range which proceeds in the glass with punctuality, gustatory precision and enthusiasm. With Altemasi, respect for mountain viticulture merges with cutting-edge processing techniques: the cellar founded in 1993 and developed on four levels is a small temple for the creation of taste. These are the premises for creating sparkling wines suitable for accompanying traditional dishes from aperitifs to refined first courses, always characterized by a crunchy and savory touch, excellent creaminess and fullness on the palate. Altemasi Trentodoc Altemasi Trentodoc includes six types of sparkling wine, each characterized by a recognizable identity and designed to satisfy multiple taste variations. With the Trentodoc Riserva Graal we are faced with a long refinement on the yeasts for 68 months: the result is a sparkling wine with a golden color and a persistent perlage, with hints of apple, peach, bergamot and white chocolate, ideal for celebrating a important event. Another reference wine is Trentodoc Pas Dos√©, aged for 60 months and capable of fruity and floral aromas with a touch of greater minerality and very suitable to accompany smoked fish and shellfish in general. The beauty of Altemasi is being able to lose yourself in many fragrances always full of new surprises for the palate. What are the characteristics of Altemasi Blanc de Noirs? With the Trentodoc Blanc de Noirs we are faced with a sparkling wine that ages for over 36 months on the yeasts: hints of yellow pulp fruits are finely intertwined with notes of red currants, denoting great structure and excellent persistence. What are the characteristics of Trentodoc Altemasi Ros√©? Trentodoc Altemasi Ros√© has highly recognizable characteristics as a blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes. It is a sparkling wine that ages for 15 months on the lees and has a firm pink colour, hints of wild strawberry and ripe cherry, great creaminess on the palate and a persistent finish. Perfect wine for an aperitif in style, it goes well with platters of cold cuts and cheeses as well as white meats. Why try Trentodoc Altemasi Brut Millesimato 2020? Trentodoc Altemasi Brut Millesimato 2020 is the authentic expression of Chardonnay, the vine of freshness and purity that distinguishes an important vintage. With over 30 months of aging on the yeasts, this sparkling wine of fine grain and delicate touch presents notes of citrus and brioche on the nose, great momentum on the palate with a pleasant and moderate crunchiness that defines an uncommon wine with great structure.\n\nAltesino\n\nAltesino is a forerunner of the various and important innovations that have affected the production of Sangiovese di Montalcino over time and has established itself as a leading reality and reference point in the sector. The philosophy that inspires the company is based on the intense relationship created with a territory rich in history and beauty, whose wines represent a perfect combination of tradition and culture. The wines of Altesino are united by a very high quality, the result of a great and meticulous care of all the stages of the production process: from the cultivation of the vineyards to the vinification, up to maturation and refinement.\n\nAlvaro Palacios\n\nAlvaro Palacios\n\nAlvi's Drift\n\nA 7000-hectare property, belonging to the Van der Merve family since 1928, which stands in the mountains that outline the landscape of the Breede Valley, between the cities of Worcester and Villiersdorp, in South Africa. It is the Alvi's Drift Private Winery, with a name that recalls the homonymous bridge built to access the estate, which boasts a wine production of absolute importance, with 500 hectares of land planted with 19 varieties of grapes, immersed in a suggestive landscape and luxuriant. Grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Bouschet and Petit Verdot, but also Chardonnay and Viognier. Wines that are simply unique, as demonstrated by the large series of awards, born from the passion for experimentation but also from an extraordinary terroir.\n\nAmara\n\nAmarano\n\nAmaras\n\nAmaro Kahneman\n\nAmaro Locale\n\nAmastrone\n\nAmazzoni\n\nAmbrogio e Giovanni Folonari\n\nThe Folonari family has been linked to the wine world for over 2 centuries. Starting with the forefather Lorenzo Folonari, who moved to Val Camonica with his family, generations of entrepreneurs dedicated to the trade and production of wine followed one another. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the brothers Italo and Francesco Folonari moved the company headquarters from Val Camonica to Brescia and later also acquired the Ruffino winery in Tuscany. The brothers' goal was to become producers and distributors of the prized Chianti Classico, both in Italy and abroad. After the Second World War and the profound changes that this brought to Italy in terms of economic growth, the Folonari family acquired the Tenuta di Nozzole and del Cabreo, located in Greve in Chianti, starting to produce new high quality wines. 2000 saw the birth of Tenute Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari, five owned estates distributed in the areas with the highest wine-growing vocation in Tuscany. Thanks to research, creativity and investment in innovation, the Folonari name is still associated with quality wines, with character and elegance. Red wine Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari The red wine Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari represents the excellence of Tuscany: from the Chianti Classico of the Tenuta di Nozzole to the Brunello di Montalcino of the Tenuta La Fuga, passing through the Bolgheri of the Tenuta Campo al Mare and the Montecucco Sangiovese of the Tenuta di Vigne in Porrona. The fine reds produced in the historic Tenuta di Nozzole, located in the land of choice of Sangiovese, are the Chianti Classico d'Annata, Riserva and Gran Selezione, available on Vino.com. In addition to Sangiovese, the company cultivates Cabernet Sauvignon with which it produces Il Pareto, a multi-award-winning Supertuscan by Italian and international critics, available on Vino.com. Other Supertuscans with great personality are born in the Cabreo Estate: Cabreo Il Borgo, an elegant blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and Cabreo Black, a Tuscan IGT Pinot Noir. The Tenuta Campo al Mare, which extends into the municipality of Castagneto Carducci, gives life to the best Bolgheri DOC of the company: the Campo al Mare Bolgheri Rosso DOC and the Baia al Vento Bolgheri Superiore DOC, produced with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. From the Sangiovese vine of Tenuta La Fuga, the Folonari family obtains its best Brunello di Montalcino and Rosso di Montalcino DOCG wines, while the reds Torcalvano Nobile di Montepulciano DOCG, Nobile di Montepulciano Riserva originate from the vineyards of the Nobile di Montepulciano wine area. DOCG and Rosso di Montepulciano DOC. Vino.com includes in its catalog a wide selection of the best Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari reds, all to be tried.\n\nAmuerte\n\nAnae\n\nAndeluna\n\nThe charm of Argentina resonates in the products signed Andeluna, a reality that was born in the mid-90s thanks to Ward Lay. Ward, coming from a family of North American entrepreneurs, decides to invest part of his profits by building a winery, joining in partnership with the family of Italian origins Reina Rutini. The area identified to start production is that of the Uco Valley, in the shadow of the Tupungato mountain, one of the most suitable areas of the entire nation; Michel Rolland, an internationally renowned winemaker, is called to monitor each stage of the process. Today Andeluna is a winery that rests on very solid foundations, and the Barale family, already present in Argentina with other wineries, took over its management. The production philosophy is totally focused on respect for the terroir, the true and only interpreter of what the Valle de Uco is able to bring in the glass. Among the rows, which are spread over a vineyard area of about 80 hectares, various varieties are grown, both native and international, such as Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvigon, Merlot, Torront√©s, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Vines that give life to a varied range of labels, from which the rocky and calcareous character of the soil from which they arise emerges, giving us an authentic sip, which, in the case of the Tupungato Malbec \"Altitud\" and the Valle de Uco Malbec \"1300\", reaches internationally recognized quality levels.\n\nAndr√© Clouet\n\nAndr√© Fays\n\nAngel's Envy\n\nAngostura\n\nLeading company in the production of bitters and as famous as it is appreciated in the production of Caribbean Rum, Angostura is nowadays an essential brand for any self-respecting cocktail bar. The company dates back to 1824, when Dr. Siegert perfected the famous formula for the aromatic bitter Amargo Aromatico, which at the time he used for military surgical practices in the army of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var - in the locality of Angostura in Venezuela. Realizing the potential of what he had created, Angostura became a family business and the headquarters moved to Trinidad, in the heart of the Caribbean. Through almost three centuries of refinement and continuous research, Angostura still aims today at the continuous renewal and leadership of the amaro and rum market, so much so that it has become a Royal Warrant brand of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nAnne Boisson\n\nAnne Boisson\n\nAnselmi\n\nRoberto Anselmi is remembered among the wine producers who have best been able to enhance and bring to the fore the wines from the Garganega variety. While operating in Monforte d'Alpone, a Veronese area entirely within the boundaries of the Soave Classico DOC appellation, and while producing wines in which Garganega reaches percentages equal to or greater than 90%, Anselmi promotes its labels under the Veneto IGT brand, in the form protest against regulatory constraints he considered too mild and permissive. Anselmi's wines, born from vineyards located in the high Veronese hills, on soils rich in volcanic tuff that give a typical mineral imprint, are made with innovative means pursuing principles of measure and sobriety. The highest qualitative peaks are reached by the plots of the historic Soave areas, above all Capitel Croce and Foscarino.\n\nAnselmo Mendes\n\nAntica Fratta\n\nThe Antica Fratta winery is located in Monticelli Brusati, in the Franciacorta area . Elegance, pleasantness and exclusivity are the key words on which the philosophy of the company is based, which has chosen to follow the path of a limited and very accurate production, with the awareness that it is precisely the details that make the difference. Thanks to a great work in the vineyard (which includes clonal selections, low production of grapes per vine and manual harvesting of the bunches) and a careful winemaking process (from soft pressing to assembly tests), Antica Fratta today produces ambitious and elegant wines , which embody the true essence of Franciacorta.\n\nAntiche Cantine Migliaccio\n\nA history of traditions and modern winemaking techniques merges into what, in the 2000s, was called Antiche Cantine Migliaccio. Immersed in the evocative, wild and unspoiled Punta Fieno, it is one of the most virgin locations on the island of Ponza. When in 1734 Carlo Borbone colonized the island of Ponza, he entrusted the already planted area of Hay to Pietro Migliaccio: Migliaccio, of Ischian origins, imported the ancient typical vines to the island, saving them from oblivion: Biancolella, Forastera, Guarnaccia , Aglianico and Piedirosso. Here, in a place that is difficult to access and for this reason even more magical, the old Ponza peasants now cultivate the vineyard as it once was: thanks also to the help of the oenologist Vincenzo Mercurio, unique wines are born, from the happy union of an extraordinary terroir , technique and passion.\n\nAntico Borgo dei Colli\n\nAntoine Jobard\n\nAntoine Jobard\n\nThe Antoine Jobard domaine, nestled in the heart of Meursault in Burgundy, is an estate that boasts a long family history. Originally part of the Pierre Jobard domaine, the property was equally divided between his sons Charles and Fran√ßois Jobard. The latter, Antoine's father, maintained the high quality of Meursault's production for fifty years, starting in 1957. In 2005, after 3 years of close collaboration with his father, Antoine who represented the fifth generation of Jobard took the reins of the company, assuming exclusive responsibility for the entire winemaking activity. Under his leadership, the estate has continued to stand out for its fine, long-aged Meursault white wines, but, since 2019, following the acquisition of the Mussy domaine in Pommard, it has also begun producing notable red wines. The production management has focused on the innovative choice of producing lighter, more fragrant and accessible wines. The first vintage produced immediately met with considerable success. The Antoine Jobard domaine stands out not only for the quality of its wines, but also for the adoption of environmentally friendly viticultural practices and for a winemaking that reflects the unique personality of each terroir . Located in the most prestigious climats of Meursault, such as Blagny, Charmes, Poruzots and Genevri√®res, Jobard wines are celebrated for their exceptionality and the uniqueness that each label brings with it. This fusion of tradition, innovation and dedication continues to make the Antoine Jobard domaine a shining star in the Burgundy wine scene.\n\nAntonella Corda\n\nAntonelli\n\nIn 1881 a family from Spoleto, the Antonellis, bought the Montefalco estate, located in the province of Perugia, transforming it into a modern and innovative wine company. Antonelli is a company that today boasts 170 hectares of vineyards in the center of the Montefalco DOCG and takes care of all its production in every single detail, leaving nothing to chance: a great history behind it but always looking towards the future make it one of the most important realities of Umbria, with wines that fully express the character of a land. Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Grechetto and Trebbiano Spolentino, these are the most representative grapes of the estate, whose salient feature is precisely the elegance and refinement. Not only that: for years now the winery has undertaken a path of research, improvement of the vine and experimentation in the cellar in search of the perfect balance, of that harmonious and graceful taste rather than vigor, with delicate extractions and a sparing use of wood, to give the wines an extraordinary freshness and drinkability.\n\nAperol\n\nThe history of Aperol is inextricably linked to the name of the Barbieri brothers. It was 1919 when Silvio and Luigi Barbieri presented it for the first time at the international fair in Padua. But it was in the 1980s that a new season for Aperol was inaugurated thanks to the diffusion of the legendary Venetian aperitif, the Spritz Aperol. Light, fresh, drinkable but with an elaborate taste given by the union of top quality herbs and roots. What are the ingredients of Aperol? The ingredients that make up this drink with a light alcohol content are easily identifiable on the label. The production method is the same generally used for bitter bitters. A mix of spices, fruit, roots and flowers is macerated in water, until the desired alcohol content and flavor are obtained. while in Italy Aperol is marketed with an alcohol content of 11 degrees, a slightly higher alcohol content is used abroad: 15 degrees. Among the fruits used, the orange is certainly recognisable, which gives it the characteristic bright orange colour. Among the herbs, on the other hand, the use of rhubarb is known: a plant that favors digestion, often used precisely in the production of bitters and digestives. Rhubarb itself contains a yellow/orange pigment in its leaves and roots, which contributes to the orange color of Aperol. Beyond this information, however, the Aperol recipe and the mix of herbs used to produce it remain a secret. In fact, the original recipe has remained the same and secret until today. Simply unique. How is Aperol Spritz made? The Aperol Spritz is certainly one of the most famous and most drunk drinks in the world. Precisely for this reason, it is prepared by many people and everyone has their own \"secret recipe\" for preparing the perfect cocktail. However, the International Bartenders Association, or the International Association of Barmen, has developed and disseminated the recipe for preparing the perfect bittersweet cocktail. To prepare the Spritz, fill the glass with ice cubes. Then add two parts of Prosecco DOC , two parts of Aperol and one part, i.e. a splash, of soda. Finally, garnish with a slice of orange. This is the official recipe for Aperol Spritz, even if a splash of seltzer or even sparkling water is often used instead of soda. What is the difference between Aperol and Campari? There can be no confusion between the two most famous Italian aperitifs: Aperol and Campari . Despite this, we often wonder what the difference is between these beloved classics of the Italian tradition. First of all, the flavour: those who know them well know that campari has a stronger, more intense flavour, with more pronounced bitter notes. This is precisely because Aperol contains a greater quantity of sugar. In terms of alcohol content, however, campari has a much higher degree than that of Aperol, 25% against 11%. Finally the colour: Campari has a very intense dark red colour, which depends on the pigment coming from the Carmine of Cochineal. Cochineal is a small animal that lives on the blades of prickly pears, whose females contain a red pigment. Cochineal Carmine is detached from the plant. Dried, cleaned and reduced to powder, it is then treated with ammonia or with a solution of soda ash. The solid part is eliminated by filtering it thus leaving the purified liquid. If necessary, lime is added to obtain shades of purple. Why buy Aperol online?

Founded in 1815 by John McDougall, in this wild and arid land, the company has a rather troubled history, with continuous closures and changes of ownership, until 1997 when it was bought by Glenmorangie. However, the quality of the products has never changed, which have always been an indication of absolute excellence in the field of single malt whiskeys, produced from the water of the lakes of Arigh Nam Beist and Uigeadail and which, together with the decisive aroma of the peat used in drying of the malt and salty scents due to the proximity of the sea, give Ardbeg whiskey its typical peculiarities that have distinguished it over time.\n\nArgiano\n\nArgiolas\n\nArgiolas\n\nThe history of the Argiolas Winery begins in the early 1900s in Serdiana, a land of vineyards and olive trees in southern Sardinia. It is here that, in 1906, Antonio, the patriarch, was born, who began to plant the rows, to combine vineyard to vineyard and to produce always looking for quality, with the utmost rigor and respect for the territory.

The principles of all domaines are based on respect for the heritage of grapes and terroir, enhanced by separately vinified plots, with meticulous attention to each individual cru.\n\nBaron de Marck\n\nBaron de Sergolle\n\nBaron de Sigognac\n\nIn the Armagnac house it is said that the Baron of Sigognac, fascinated by the idea of time and its flow, makes a change to all the watches he finds in the cellar: on these watches, the dial had ten divisions instead of twelve. Thus, the seconds had become years, the minute hand moved only once every two decades and the hour hand marked the centuries. This is how the Baron discovers the almost esoteric rite of aging in Armagnac: the slow passage of time and patience. Legend also has it that the baron used to separate each harvest into different barrels and was the first to realize he wanted to sell his brandies as real vintage armagnacs. Today, Armagnac is a distillery of absolute importance, based on two fundamental principles: the exclusive use of reliable and traditional production methods and the choice of quality in every phase of production, starting with the care of the vineyards and respect for traditions. . Thus, tasting an Armagnac is an experience of life, the deliberate and conscious choice to sip a distillate of boundless quality.\n\nBarone Montalto\n\nBarone Pizzini\n\nFounded in 1870, Barone Pizzini is one of the oldest wineries in Franciacorta and the first to produce Franciacorta wines from grapes grown under organic farming, leaving each vineyard the opportunity to express itself, in a harmonious partnership between nature and technology. 140 years of tradition, knowledge and experience, a long journey made up of research, commitment, effort, study and great satisfaction, which culminates in the goal of producing pure wines, free of any residue extraneous to nature and created in full respect of each terroir and of its peculiarities.\n\nBarone di Serramarrocco\n\nBarramundi\n\nBasilisco\n\nAmong the most fascinating wineries in the Lucanian wine scene, Basilisco develops inside the ancient lava caves of the \"Shesh\", the historic Cantine di Barile Park, which the Feudi di San Gregorio company wanted to re-enhance through a courageous project recovery. A place so suggestive and scenographic that it was chosen by Pasolini to set ‚ÄúThe Gospel According to Matthew‚Äù. The vineyards located on the slopes of the Vulture, all organically run, are affected by the influence of the now extinct volcano that marks the characteristics of a terroir, characterized by a soil of volcanic origin that is enriched with layers of tuff and flysch. The vinification processes take place on the north side of the cave at an ideal temperature of 16-18 ¬∞ C, at the end of which the wine is left to rest in the silent meanders of the volcano.\n\nBastianich Winery\n\nBastianich Winery was born in 1997 in Friuli with the aim of creating wines with a unique and unmistakable taste, which know how to tell the story of this land. The desire to rediscover one's origins was already alive in the Bastianich family even before the company was founded, when the best Friulian wines were promoted in their restaurants in the United States. Following meetings with the most important local winemakers, in 1997 the Bastianich family decided to give shape to their passion for wine and began to cultivate the first vineyards in Buttrio and Cividale del Friuli, areas historically suited for the production of quality whites. . Today, the company owns 35 hectares of vineyards distributed over these two areas belonging to the Colli Orientali DOC : from the hills of Buttrio and Premariacco it obtains more full-bodied and structured wines, such as Vespa Bianco, Vespa Rosso and Calabrone; the most aromatic wines are born from the vineyards of Cividale del Friuli. Sustainable cultivation practices, respect for the rhythms of nature and enhancement of native vineyards are the watchwords of Bastianich Winery and this is why its wines are so widely appreciated. Bastianich Winery white wine Bastianich Winery white wine is born from a careful care of the land of origin and the place of production. The Collio area, in fact, is characterized by a soil rich in clayey marl (called \"ponca\" in the Friulian language) alternating with layers of sandstone. Marl is easily disintegrated in the presence of atmospheric agents and, alternating with sandstone, creates a natural system to retain water and regulate its availability for plants. According to where the vineyards are planted, wines are obtained that are very different from each other in aroma and body: the hills of Buttrio and Premariacco, in the southernmost area of the Colli Orientali DOC, enjoy the heat coming from the sea and give life to wines soft whites, like the Vespa Bianco and with character, like the Bianco Plus, both available on Vino.com. On the hills of Cividale del Friuli, on the other hand, the bora blows, the cold wind coming from the north, which gives white wines a greater aroma, as can be felt in the Ribolla Gialla Vigne Orsone, available on Vino.com. How is Bastianich Vespa wine born? Bastianich's Vespa Bianco Venezia Giulia IGT is the result of a skilful blending of Chardonnay , Sauvignon Blanc and Picolit grapes, hand-picked and selected already in the vineyard. They ferment separately in steel and oak barrels at a controlled temperature, after which, the wine ages in oak and steel on the fine lees. The process ends with a further refinement in the bottle. The result is a wine with an intense straw yellow color, which opens on the nose with aromas of wild flowers and citrus fruits, accompanied by mineral and honey notes. It is undoubtedly a white of excellent quality, which over the years has received numerous awards, such as the Cinque Grappoli Bibenda award. What is Bastianich Calabrone wine characterized for? Bastianich's Calabrone Venezia Giulia IGT Rosso wine comes from the hills of Manzano, Buttrio and Cividale. It is mainly composed of Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso grapes, blended with Schioppettino, Pignolo and Merlot grapes and presents a rich and complex bouquet of aromas: the hints of chocolate and coffee are enriched by spicy and fruity notes. An elegant and well-structured wine, to be paired with robust red meat dishes and wild boar dishes. What are the characteristics of Bastianich Ribolla Gialla wine? Ribolla Gialla Vigne Orsone Bastianich Winery wine originates from pure Ribolla Gialla grapes grown in the vineyards of Cividale, in the Colli Orientali del Friuli DOC area. It is characterized by its intense mineral and fruity notes, but also by its freshness and acidity. Perfect in combination with fried vegetables and fish, it also accompanies seafood dishes and sushi. The Spumante Brut Ribolla Gialla Plus, on the other hand, is a dry, structured and elegant wine, which opens on the nose with notes of citrus and green apple and in the mouth it is fresh and clean.\n\nBava\n\nBeatesca\n\nBeaumont des Cray√®res\n\nBeefeater\n\nThe Beefeater story begins in 1863, when James Burrough buys a distillery whose specialty was making \"Taylor & Son\" liqueurs in Cale Street, Chelsea. After years of study and experimentation, James Burrough comes to compose the catalog, which in 1876 included the James Burrough London Dry, the Ye Old Chelsea and the Old Tom Style gin. He decides to add a new brand: Beefeater London Dry gin. The Beefeater enjoyed immediate success, so much so that in 1895 the official recipe was drawn up and it was declared the company's reference product. Today the distillery is in the hands of Allied Domecq, which since 2005 has been part of the Pernod Ricard group, which with great entrepreneurial intuition has invested heavily in the brand, making Beefeater the company's flagship gin. Beefeater is a purely London gin that winks at the new generations, without forgetting the legacy of its great past.\n\nBegali\n\nSan Pietro in Cariano, beating heart of the Valpolicella Classica, 1943: from these space-time coordinates, the winery of Lorenzo Begali, which has always been a fascinating family-run business in the Veronese area, begins. With 12 hectares of company property, the grapes grown here are mainly indigenous, expression of the Valpolicella terroir: Corvina, Corvinone, Rondinella and Oseleta. Work in the cellar follows a classic, traditional, one would say, old-fashioned style: even before the work in the cellar, upstream of all reality, there is a deep-rooted respect for the land, for the plants, which are raised and cared for. tenderly in all seasons. The result? Wines for everyday life, to be drunk on everyday tables, as well as a fine Amarone, such as Monte Ca 'Bianca, a frank and sincere wine that has convinced us so much.\n\nBel Colle\n\nBelisario\n\nCreating a style, not a fashion: this is the banner of Cantine Belisario, born in 1971 in Matelica, in the province of Macerata. Today it is a company that can dispose of 300 hectares of vineyards and can be considered the largest producer of Verdicchio di Matelica DOC, where each label has its own specific vineyard. With a team made up of an oenologist, four winemakers, four cellar masters and various offices, Cantine Belisario can be said to be a solid reality in the Marche landscape. A benevolent microclimate, particularly mild and sunny, allows for limited production and full ripening of the fruit. Characteristics that you will find in their extraordinary wines, recognized and awarded by important guides and authoritative sommeliers.\n\nBellavista\n\nBellavista is the reference Franciacorta for those who love class and elegance. Bellavista is one of the most prestigious names in Franciacorta. It represents not only an absolute level of excellence, but also a piece of history of this famous Denomination dedicated to the production of the Classic Method. The Bellavista company was founded in 1977 thanks to Vittorio Moretti who decides to recover some family vineyards, bringing the company over time to an extension of more than 200 hectares of vineyards. The vineyards are cultivated on the reliefs of the gentle hills created by the moraine of an ancient alpine glacier. The mild climate, the draining soils rich in pebbles, have proved to be a perfect habitat for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir to be made sparkling. Great attention in the vineyard, strictly manual harvests and delicate vinification with a soft pressing of the grapes, guarantee musts of excellent quality. With vines that embrace Lake Iseo up to lap the Alps, Bellavista is the company that pays particular attention to production methods to create cuv√©es recognizable in the taste and sensitivity of its creators. With about ninety selections, Bellavista pursues maximum naturalness, respecting the vineyard and enhancing the peculiarities of Franciacorta , distinguishing itself for qualitative consistency and great recognition. The continuous search for excellence in the combination of Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio is further refined by Bellavista with the careful care of plots distant from each other and each with its own name. This is the consistency renewed by a qualitative challenge for the many Classic Method proposals such as the recognizable bottle of Franciacorta Brut DOCG Grande Cuv√©e Alma Bellavista with 40 months aging on the lees or the Bellavista Alma Non Dosato which uses nine reserve wines in the cuv√©e. The variety of Franciacorta Bellavista The variety of Franciacorta Bellavista depends on countless factors involved in the creation of the cuv√©es. Franciacorta Bellavista is initially created with Pinot Nero, Pinot Bianco and Chardonnay grapes that come from one hundred and seven vineyards located near Lake Iseo. The manual harvesting and selection of the grapes is one of the most important moments in the process of creating Franciacorta Bellavista. As a Classic Method, the base wine obtained for the Franciacorta Bellavista is assembled in cuv√©es destined to referment in the bottle for a few months. The selection of wines, the aging of some of these in oak and the possibility of drawing on reserve wines are factors capable of guaranteeing complexity to Franciacorta Bellavista before the second fermentation begins. The Franciacorta Bellavista certainly stand out the Franciacorta Brut Sat√®n DOCG 2016 Bellavista with aging for at least 5 years in the cellar and the Millesimato Bellavista Teatro alla Scala Brut, a blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero from old vines with more than a quarter of the wines aged in oak. Is Bellavista a Prosecco? Bellavista is produced in Franciacorta while Prosecco is produced in the provinces of Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia . As a Classic Method, the Bellavista ferments a second time in the bottle while the Prosecco undergoes the second fermentation in the autoclave. Furthermore, Bellavista cannot be a Prosecco because it is created with grapes other than Glera such as Chardonnay, Pinot Nero and Pinot Bianco. What is Bellavista Ros√© made from? Bellavista Ros√© is made from 55% Chardonnay and 45% Pinot Nero grapes. The ros√© color of Bellavista Ros√© is mainly due to the pigments present on the skins of Pinot Noir while the particularity of this sparkling wine consists in the creation of a blend of more than 30 different selections and the refinement of some of these base wines in oak. What does the Bellavista Brut match with? There are many labels of Bellavista Brut, that is of Classic Method sparkling wine vinified to have a final sugar residue between 0 and 12 g / l. It is ideal to accompany appetizers and seafood first courses but it lends itself very well as a refined or informal aperitif wine.\n\nBellussi\n\nBelsazar\n\nVermouth in Berlin has the face of Belsazar, the company founded in 2013 by Sebastian Brack and Maximilian Wagner, both from the high ranks of spirits who can count on the help of the Schladerer House Distillery, located in the heart of the Black Forest, in the region of Baden-Wurttemberg. Fruit brandy, aged wine must, highly selected botanicals and wines chosen from indigenous productions: these are the four fundamental ingredients that constitute the key to their success. An absolute novelty in the German panorama, perhaps for this reason less known than the Turin reality or the Vermouth di Chamb√©ry, but certainly no less noteworthy, far from it. We liked it so much.\n\nBeluga\n\nBeluga distillates are born in the Mariinsky distillery, founded in 1900 in the uncontaminated and wild Siberia with excellent raw materials, such as water from artesian wells that contribute to making this vodka brand one of the most appreciated of its kind.

Guido Berlucchi's first attempts to create a sparkling wine date back to 1961. This happened also thanks to the advice of the oenologist Franco Ziliani, who suggested producing a sparkling wine with the Classic Method, taking up the French technique. In addition to the intuition and knowledge of French sparkling wines, the right combination of climatic factors and skilful interventions in the vineyard and cellar have also allowed Berlucchi to present his Classic Method Franciacortas as distinctive and unique products. Berlucchi's production tradition continues unabated today with the direct descendants of Guido Berlucchi, who still continue to present the world with a unique and expressive Franciacorta. Since 2016, Berlucchi has chosen to follow the path of environmental sustainability , taking care of quality before quantity. Berlucchi supports this production choice with the classification of the vineyards and the mapping of the land to supply the vineyard with dedicated and targeted care. What kind of wine is Berlucchi? Franciacorta Berlucchi is a sparkling wine refermented in the bottle with the Classic Method . Given the extreme versatility and skill with which it is produced, it can be indicated for casual occasions but also prove to be a perfect collector's wine. Guido Berlucchi, under the advice of the oenologist Franco Ziliani, in 1961 created the progenitor of the current Franciacorta: the Pinot di Franciacorta Classic Method. This makes Franciacorta Berlucchi a real authority in terms of the Franciacorta Classic Method The Classic Method refers to the traditional method which involves the second fermentation in the bottle and which takes the French Champenoise Method as a reference and example. All the production of Franciacorta begins with a careful monitoring of the vineyards with very advanced systems that allow saving resources and optimizing quality. The hand harvest is another expression of care and is followed by transport in small crates and soft pressing of the bunches. The fractionation of the musts allows the grapes to be divided up and assigned to steel vats or oak barriques after cold decantation. Having defined the cuv√©e on which all the flavor of Franciacorta will depend, the resulting wine is ready for a second fermentation. After making the blend, the sparkling process begins. The first step is the tirage : the liqueur de tirage is added to the cuv√©e, i.e. a mixture of yeasts, sugar and mineral nutrients for the yeasts and immediate bottling is carried out. Each bottle is closed with a crown cap which contains a small container needed to collect the lees during the remuage phase. The addition of the mixture allows the fermentation in the bottle to begin: from this fermentation the carbon dioxide produced remains trapped in the bottle allowing the development of the perlage. During this phase, the yeasts undergo a process of autolysis: they slowly degrade, releasing molecules. To get the lees and the deposit moving, the bottles are periodically shaken with a bang. The activity of the yeasts is closely linked to the refinement process which allows Berlucchi Franciacorta to be enriched with organoleptic qualities thanks to a rest in the cellar, away from light sources and at a controlled temperature. After a minimum refinement period of eighteen months, Franciacorta is ready for the remuage stage. In the case of Berlucchi Riserva Palazzo Lana the aging period can reach ten years. The remuage phase involves the periodic rotation of the bottles. In this way the extinct yeasts move towards the neck of the bottle: this operation, in addition to making the wine clear and free from lees, facilitates disgorgement. Disgorgement is a delicate process, necessary to expel the lees that have deposited on the neck of the bottle. During this phase, the initial part of the bottle is immersed in a solution at -25¬∞C for fifteen minutes. As soon as the deposit has frozen, the cap is removed and the frozen deposit is expelled. At this point it is necessary to fill the bottle with the same sparkling wine or a blend of wine which will determine the relative sugar content. The closure with the cork stopper makes the bottle ready to be labeled and distributed on the market. What does Berlucchi '61 mean? The Franciacorta Berlucchi '61 line is dedicated to the year of production of the first sparkling wine that recalls the collaboration between the oenologist Franco Ziliani and Guido Berlucchi. 1961 was the first year in which, after less successful attempts, the first Berlucchi cuv√©e was born, destined to mark the history of Franciacorta in the years to come. The top sparkling wines such as Franciacorta Brut Sat√®n or Franciacorta Ros√© Nature belong to the '61 line. and owes its origin to experimentation and strong roots in the production context. What to combine with Berlucchi? Berlucchi wines are perfect from aperitifs to desserts, with a preference for courses with delicate and sweet flavours . The typical hints of bread crust and yeast obtained during the long aging are perfectly integrated with the fruity and floral aromas. These hints are typical of classy wines, made to offer a measured and surprising taste, undoubtedly long-lasting.

The Brunello di Montalcino Riserva 2012 is a particularly important vintage for the Biondi Santi family, as it was dedicated to Franco Biondi Santi, one of the pillars of the company. Of the 39 vintages of Biondi Santi Riserva, 24 of these bear the signature of Franco Biondi Santi, not surprisingly defined as the gentleman of Brunello. The 2012 Riserva is the most representative wine of its creator's enological vision: fresh and refined, it opens on the nose with pleasant fruity scents that evolve into balsamic notes, aromatic herbs and licorice. On the palate it is sapid and persistent, with a clean and fragrant finish.\n\nBisleri\n\nBisol\n\nPresent with continuity within the Valdobbiadene territory for more than 5 centuries, Bisol is a company with a strong family dimension that has handed down its historical experience from generation to generation. Following the First World War, the only event that temporarily halted the development of this winery, the first reference for this reality was Eliseo Bisol, with whom, in 1542, viticulture resumed flourishing and a path of growth aimed at absolute quality, inspired by the prestige of Champagne. Today Bisol extends over 20 farms immersed in the most suitable areas of the DOCG Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore, with plots at times very steep and difficult to work, but certainly the best for the cultivation of Glera, for exposure and soil composition. The farm located on top of the Cartizze hill, the most precious vineyard in Italy, represents the apex for the quality of Prosecco, which it finds with the Desiderio Jeio line, inspired by the affectionate nickname \"Jeio\" with which his wife used to call her husband Desiderio Bisol, the highest peak, the result of a careful selection from the best vineyards of all the estates. In the Bisol range of products we also find a Cru line, made up of labels obtained from a single farm, carefully selected and vinified, able to reveal the uniqueness and character of each micro-zone in the glass.\n\nBisson\n\nA curious fate that of Pierluigi Lugano, the patron of Bisson, who made his first wine at the age of six: during the experience of his first harvest, in the cellar of a friend, he learned the art of pressing and delighted to bottle. A sort of predestination, which will see him by now a master of art and sommelier in 1978, when he decides to enhance the grapes of the Ligurian Riviera del Levante, with excellent results. Let's think, for example, of Abissi, a sparkling wine born in Trigoso di Sestri Levante, in the province of Genoa, whose second fermentation takes place by immersion in stainless steel cages, at a depth of 60 meters in the depths of the Bay of Silence. of Sestri Levante. A very special sparkling wine.\n\nBlackadder\n\nBlumenfeld\n\nBlumenfeld wines originate in the terroir of Gries, formerly known as Keller, \"cellar\" in German.

It is a typical red of Alto Adige, made from 100% Pinot Nero grapes, harvested in September and left to ferment in steel at a controlled temperature. The vinification process is completed with a further period of aging in cask. It opens on the nose with a scent of cherry, plum and raspberry which is perfectly combined with hints of licorice and violet.

Sauvignon Blumenfeld lends itself to a great variety of combinations. Due to its fresh and delicate flavor, it is perfect to be enjoyed as an aperitif. Moreover, thanks to its vegetal aromas of tomato leaves, sage and nettle and its hints of acacia, peach and lime, it goes very well with vegetable or fish dishes.
