        "text": "Introduction\n\nSeveral models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks of acute respiratory diseases and their phase differences at different latitudes on the Earth (e.g. Lofgren et al., 2007 and references therein). Internal biological dynamics that allow influenza viruses to evade host's immunity and become more virulent (Cox and Subbarao, 1999) manifest mainly through “antigenic drift,” the property of such viruses to mutate rapidly (Agranovski et al., 2004, 2005). For A and B influenza viruses, such mutations develop at rates of 6.7 × 10−3 and 3.2 × 10−3 nucleotide substitution per site per year, respectively (Lofgren et al., 2007; McCullers et al., 1999). These imply, on average, 6 and 3 mutations per RNA segment of each virus every 6 months, respectively, sufficient (especially for type-A influenza) to trigger recurrences of epidemics on antigenic-drift timescale. However, without an external forcing mechanism, such recurring events are typically of modest intensity, can only last for a few cycles, and most importantly are not able to reproduce the observed phase shift between the north and south hemisphere on the Earth.\n\nOne or more concurring external mechanisms must be invoked to explain all evidence, and several have been proposed (e.g. Ebi et al., 2001; Grais et al., 2003; Grais et al., 2004; Liao et al., 2005; Viboud et al., 2004; Baker et al., 2020). These include, but are not limited to, weather-related temperature and humidity oscillations on the Earth (e.g. Baker et al., 2020), the observed yearly pattern of air travel (e.g. Grais et al., 2003, but see also Grais et al., 2004), indoor heating during winter (e.g. Liao et al., 2005), and bulk aerosol transport of virus through global convective currents or related to weather oscillations like “El Niño” (e.g. Ebi et al., 2001; Viboud et al., 2004).\n\nMost of these, however, modulate on timescales that are either typical of seasons on the Earth or longer and thus singularly can only explain some aspects of seasonality of recurring outbreaks, or the onsets of particularly violent outbreaks. For example, the load of air-travel flow is typically larger during northern hemisphere summers, and this is in contrast with most of the outbreaks developing during falls and winters in these countries. On the other hand, vastly populated areas in the north hemisphere lie at relatively low latitudes in temperate regions where indoor heating is not massively widespread: yet, even in these areas, influenza epidemics typically develop during winters and remain inactive in summers. Similarly, temperature, humidity, and air pollution are not homogeneously distributed through the planet, and micro-climate can vary substantially at the same latitude, depending on the particular geographical or industrial setting of even contiguous areas. The cross-influence of all these factors could certainly synergize to produce the observed geographical and time modulations, but this would require a hard-to-obtain perfect fine-tuning of the many parameters at play.\n\nThe one mechanism that has been acting constantly at (almost) the same pace every day of the year and every year for the past four billion years is the irradiation of the Sun on the Earth. At a given location on the Earth, this is modulated daily by the Earth's spinning and yearly by the Earth's orbit around the sun ( ).\n\nSolar UV photons with wavelength in the range 200–290 nm (UV-C radiation) photochemically interact with DNA and RNA and are endowed with germicidal properties that are also effective on viruses (Kowalski, 2009; Rauth, 1965; Kesavan and Sagripanti, 2014; Chang et al., 1985; McDevitt et al., 2012; Welch et al., 2018; Walker and Ko, 2007; Tseng and Li, 2005). Fortunately, UV-C photons are filtered out by the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere, at around 35 km (e.g. Walker and Ko, 2007). Softer UV photons from the Sun with wavelengths in the range 290–320 nm (UV-B) and 320–400 nm (UV-A), however, do reach the Earth's surface. The effect of these photons on single- and double-stranded RNA and DNA viruses (e.g. Lytle and Sagripanti, 2005; Lubin and Jensen, 1995) and the possible role they play on the seasonality of epidemics (e.g. Martinez, 2018), are nevertheless little studied. In two companion papers, we present a number of concurring circumstantial pieces of evidence suggesting that the evolution and strength of the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic (Zhu et al., 2020; Cobey, 2020) might have been modulated by the intensity of UV-B and UV-A solar radiation hitting different regions of the Earth during the diffusion of the outbreak between January and July 2020 (Nicastro et al., 2020, submitted) and provide a measurement of the lethal UV-C dose for COVID-19 (Bianco et al., 2020, submitted).\n\nFor the solar virus-inactivation mechanism to be effective in modulating the disease's transmission and settling the duration and recurrence of epidemics, both direct contact (e.g. through exposed surfaces) and airborne transmission have to play a role. This is indeed the case for most respiratory diseases (e.g. Prather et al., 2020 and references therein). Additionally, the time needed for aerosol particles to gravitationally settle has to be comparable or longer than the typical UV-B/UV-A virus's lethal time (Nicastro et al., 2020, submitted). This is probably not true (in still air) for the largest (∼100 μm in size) and thus heaviest droplets produced in coughs and sneezes, where the gravitational settling time is of the order of few seconds (Morawska and Cao, 2020), but can certainly be the case for significantly smaller, micron or sub-micron size, aerosol particles (like those that commonly contain the influenza virus, e.g. Tellier et al., 2019) that can survive in still air for longer than 12.4 hr (Tellier et al., 2019).\n\nHere we present a simple mathematical model of epidemics that includes the effect of solar UV photons (“solar pump,” hereinafter) as an infra-day resonance mechanism that acts systematically every day with strength and on timescales (from minutes to hours) dictated only by astronomical parameters and explore its parameter space. We demonstrate that such a physically motivated model is able to naturally reproduce the seasonality of influenza-like epidemics as well as its distribution with latitude on the Earth, without forcing seasonal oscillations with ad-hoc mathematical prescriptions (e.g. Dushoff et al., 2004; Neher et al., 2020). Moreover, it matches reasonably well the Italian data of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics (see Methods in Supplementary Information), predicting different short-term future scenarios, depending on the efficiency of the solar pump.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur model is able to reproduce in a particularly precise way the seasonality of respiratory diseases where airborne transmission is the main path of infection and their phase-latitude dependence. The solar-pump mechanism works more efficiently on free-to-spread (i.e. no distancing measure adopted) epidemics with intrinsic reproductive number R0 lower than ≈2–3. For epidemics with larger intrinsic reproductive number, and no restriction measures at work, the first outbreak could quickly produce herd immunity (e.g. Baker et al., 2020) and the onset of seasonality due to the solar-pump mechanism may be harder to achieve even in the presence of fast LOI rates. Nonetheless, even for highly contagious diseases that turn into pandemic, like the recent SARS-CoV-2, our model is able to explain the qualitative differences generally observed when the strength of the pandemics is compared in countries located in the northern, tropical, and southern hemisphere (e.g. Nicastro et al., 2020, submitted).\n\nAccurate predictions of ongoing epidemics depend critically on the initial and boundary conditions of the simulations. For example, the particular set of model parameters we used to match the Italian data of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics (see 's caption for details) is obviously not unique. In particular, these predictions depend (given the initial dates for lockdown and phase 2) on the starting time of the epidemics and the actual efficiency of the solar effect (two parameters strongly degenerate with each other: see below). The second of these parameters, in turn, depends on the exact knowledge of the virus' UV-C lethal dose D0, the way this is delivered, and the time the virus (in aerosol or surfaces) remains exposed to the dose. Accurate modeling of this phenomenon is beyond the scope of this work. However, it is useful to show the comparison with drastically different solar-pump efficiencies to highlight the potential predictive power of the model for, e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.\n\nshows the results of three simulations for the group at 40° north and solar-pump efficiencies ε = 1 (same as A; red curve), ε = 0.3 (∼3 times lower than in the case of : compare, e.g. green and blue curves of ; green curve), and ε = 0 (blue curve). Some of the remaining model parameters are tuned to match the Italian SARS-CoV-2 curve of growth of contagions (see figure's caption for details) from the start of epidemic through 21 August 2020 and with the observed under-sampling factor of 6. Most of the tuned parameters can be compared with observables, which allows for a quantification of the solar-pump effect. In particular, the red, green, and blue curves have epidemic starting dates t0 = 6, 19, and 22 January 2020. This parameter is particularly critical in setting the normalization of the curves and the date of their first peak, given the known under-sampling factor of 6 (as observed in Italy) and lockdown starting date of 11 March 2020 (the official date of lockdown in Italy). For comparison, the first Covid-19 cases have occurred in Italy over the period of 1–10 January 2020 (Cereda et al., 2020). Two additional sensible parameters, which model the shape of the peak, the initial declining phase of the first outbreak, and the recovery phase of contagions, are the Rt halving time during lockdown and the phase 2 starting date. The plotted models have halving times of 28 (red curve), 18 (green curve), and 15 (blue curve) days. For comparison, in the three regions of Italy most heavily hit by the outbreak and that largely dominated the number of daily infected till July 2020, Rt halving times from their peak values have been estimated in 24 (Lombardy), 17 (Emilia-Romagna), and 28 days (Veneto; see Flavia et al., 2020 and Moriano et al., 2020). Finally, phase 2 starting dates in the models are 17 (red curve), 10 (green curve), and 12 (blue curve) April 2020, respectively, 9, 16, and 14 days earlier than the official start date of phase 2 in Italy. These comparisons suggest a relatively high solar-pump efficiency during the first six months of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy.\n\nAn additional way of assessing the relative importance, if not the exact magnitude, of the solar-pump mechanism versus other external forcing mechanisms will be to compare the evolution of the epidemic in Italy over the next several months with model predictions. The three curves of differ substantially in short- and long-term predictions of the evolution of the epidemic. In all cases, Italy, where distancing measures have now greatly being relaxed, should start seeing a strong increase in the number of new daily infected in September, and this should continue, in the absence of distancing measures, through the end of November 2020 for maximum solar-pump efficiency (red curve) and through mid January 2021 for low solar-pump efficiency (ε ≤ 0.3: green and blue curves). Moreover, at low solar-pump efficiencies (green and blue curves), the number of daily infected shall start climbing again around late spring 2021 and then again, roughly every six months for a few additional cycles, dictated only by the LOI rate (γin = 0.0055 in these simulations) and until the solar mechanism starts differentiating the green from the blue curve. On the contrary, at maximum solar-pump efficiency (red curve), contagions will not be able to spread again till late summer 2021 and then will adjust to seasonal cycles.\n\nFinally, as shown in , , and , at each given time, the solar-pump mechanism acts differently at different latitudes on the Earth. Thus, comparing our model predictions with SARS-CoV-2 data in countries located at opposite latitudes over the next few months should also tell us quantitatively about the importance of the solar-pump effect in modulating the spreading of this disease.\n\nLimitations of the Study\n\nOur model for the diffusion of contagions (see Methods in Supplementary Information) considers population groups as ideal isolated systems (i.e. no cross-mixing of populations in different groups at different latitudes on the Earth). This condition is certainly not verified in today's global world, in which daily exchange of people and goods are massive and, generally, not strictly controlled (unless measures to limit the spread of contagions are taken by governments, as in the case of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemics). This type of complexity could easily be introduced in our basic system of differential equations (see Methods in Supplementary Information) by considering cross-mixing through a matrix of either observed (i.e. based on air-, ground-, and sea-traffic data) or randomized exchange rates of susceptible and infected individuals among groups. However, the introduction of such an additional degree of complexity in the model (which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper), while could contribute to wash out and partially homogenize differences between specific groups at different latitudes, could hardly build up or break the strict seasonality that is typically observed in the recurrence of respiratory diseases and whose explanation is the main scope of this work.\n\nThe basic ingredient of our model that generates seasonality and latitude-dependent phase differences among groups is a physically motivated resonant forcing mechanism (the solar pump) that acts as a daily modulator of the reproductive number Rt (see Methods in Supplementary Information). The mechanism is based on the virus-inactivation power of the solar UV photons that reach the Earth's surface and is dictated by the shapes of the daily solar irradiation curves on Earth, which, for a given latitude and time of the year, depend only on the Earth's spinning around its rotation axis and whose self-similarity throughout a solar year is determined only by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. However, the exact efficiency of this mechanism depends on the quantification of several intrinsic parameters of the specific epidemic, such as the lethal dose of UV photons needed to inactivate the specific virus when exposed to solar-like spectra, the average lifetime of the virus in aerosol or surfaces, its transport in wind or low-atmosphere currents, etc. The quantification of these parameters for given viruses is beyond the scope of this work, whose aim is to show the potential of solar radiation in modulating the short- and long-term evolution of epidemics outbreaks and demonstrate that the unavoidable, infra-day (minute timescales) resonant mechanism naturally offered by the solar-pump can efficiently synchronize with internal LOI rates to explain the course of epidemics on much longer timescales.\n\nRelated to the above caveat, the efficiency of the solar-pump mechanism, which can only act on outdoor droplets generated through speaking, coughing, and/or sneezing aerosol and surfaces-deposited particles, depends also on the social habits of different population groups, located even at similar latitudes on the Earth, often dictated by climate, and on specific location's weather (e.g. diffuse cloud coverage). For example, outdoor living, even in winters, is much more common in Mediterranean countries than in North American states at similar Earth's latitudes. This is often anti-correlated with the massive use of indoor air-conditioning (offices, shopping malls, private homes, private and public transportation, etc.), which is known to be an efficient mean of diffusion of contagions and could, for example, contribute to explaining why the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics has spread aggressively during the initial part of summer in northern locations like the State of Texas in the US. Similarly, the diffuse cloud coverage (especially during the times of the days when the solar irradiation is maximum) in tropical countries, during specific times of the year (e.g. the monsoon season in India, or the rain seasons in the northern of Brazil, or hurricane seasons in central and tropical America) will reduce the efficiency of the solar pump and could act as an amplifier of the growth of contagions in specific periods of the year. Again, the consideration of such additional degrees of complexity in the model is certainly possible but would require a somewhat arbitrary (if not based on solid social and weather data) introduction of group-dependent weights in the parameterization of the efficiency of the solar-pump mechanism, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nFinally, we stress that the large number of parameters of the model together with the degeneracy of some of these parameters make it difficult to exactly quantify the relative importance of the solar-pump mechanism in epidemics with high intrinsic reproductive number and for which eternal forcing mechanisms like lockdown and phase 2 are introduced. As discussed in the session above, the epidemics starting time in the model is strongly degenerate with the under-sampling factor (the ratio between actual infections and detected cases), the efficiency of the solar pump, and, more moderately, the starting date of adoption of distancing measures. The exact shape of the declining and recovery phases of the curves of growth of the epidemics, when distancing measures are in effect and after they are relieved, also influence the proper modeling of actual epidemics data. In our model we assume that during these two phases, the contact rate (and so Rt) evolves exponentially, with one single halving and doubling time, respectively (see Methods in Supplementary Information). This does not have to be (and most likely is not) the case, practically. Measures adopted can (and most often do) vary on the go, and this implies either different functional shapes or variable halving/doubling times within the same phase. Such complexity introduces degeneracies between the exponential halving and doubling times and the starting dates of lockdown and phase 2 in the model, when modeling global data over externally controlled declining and recovering phases. A data-driven modeling approach to the problem, together with an accurate knowledge of all observables of the epidemics, are the only way to break these degeneracies without increasing the degree of complexity of the model (which, in turn, would introduce additional degrees of degeneracy).\n\nResource Availability\n\nLead Contact\n\nAuthor Fabrizio Nicastro (fabrizio.nicastro@inaf.it) has the role of lead contact for this paper.\n\nMaterials Availability\n\nThis study did not generate new unique reagents.\n\nData and Code Availability\n\nAll data used in this paper are public and available at specific repositories.
