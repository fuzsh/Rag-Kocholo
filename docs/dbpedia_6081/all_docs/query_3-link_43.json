        "text": "What you see is a selection of the best pizzerias you absolutely cannot miss if you are in Naples for a weekend or just for a day. Among the 10 suggestions of the best pizzerias in Naples, you will certainly find more renowned places and others that Neapolitans are mainly familiar with. Most offer traditional flavours but also new ones from abroad and other Italian cities.\n\nNaples is a city firmly attached to its culinary tradition and in particular to pizza in its most traditional form and in the more innovative variants dictated by the times and new fashions.\n\nFind out which are the best pizzerias worth trying during your visit to Naples in 2024.\n\nTradition. It is the watchword if you can try the pizza at Antica pizzeria da Michele. One of the most famous pizzerias in Naples was founded back in 1870 thanks to the intuition of Michele Condurro, who, in keeping with family tradition, decided to pursue a career as a pizza maker and open a shop at the entrance to the Forcella district from Corso Umberto. What makes Pizzeria da Michele unique is the menu. In fact, among the possible pizzas, you can only choose two alternatives: the Marinara and the Margherita. This is a clear choice and legacy of Michele, who has left the running of his pizzeria to his children and grandchildren, who continue the tradition, without affecting its strength and flavor. The interior style of the pizzeria is still very much the same as when it opened in the early 20th century. Another legacy is that at Michele's you can't reserve a table. So you'll wait your turn, taking the classic paper number.\n\nVia Cesare Sersale, 1 – 80139 Napoli\n\nMore information on Antica pizzeria da Michele❯\n\nErrico Porzio has amassed over a million followers on TikTok, and his restaurants, located throughout Campania and Rome, are revered landmarks for pizza lovers. After all, Porzio's expertise in the field is undeniable. A maestro pizzaiolo and social media sensation, he has dedicated years to relentless experimentation and innovation, constantly refining techniques and concocting inventive yet successful flavour combinations. The result is an authentic, unpretentious product that has quickly become a staple of the contemporary pizza scene. Many enthusiasts are willing to journey great distances for a taste of his creations, even those residing beyond the borders of Campania. The experience justifies the pilgrimage: Porzio's pizza is truly as delicious as it appears on the smartphone screen.\n\nVia Partenope, 11/12, 80121 Napoli NA More information on Pizzeria Errico Porzio❯\n\nThis beautiful pizzeria is located in the heart of Pignasecca, in the centre of Naples, a stone's throw from Spaccanapoli. We are in one of the most populous and colourful markets in Naples, characterised by the sounds, colours and aromas of the particular Neapolitan folklore. The Pizzeria & Trattoria al 22 is so deeply rooted in the surrounding neighbourhood that there is a constant intermingling with other businesses, especially in the choice of raw materials and local products. The pizzeria has been a family-run business for about three generations and the style of the place demonstrates this; when you enter the pizzeria you feel at home, and the welcome and the staff are very courteous and attentive to your requests. If you find yourself trying the pizza at 22 you can ask for the Pizza del Sindaco, a tribute to the first citizen of Naples and then included on the menu with its mix of yellow and Piennolo del Vesuvio tomatoes and with provola, pecorino and basil.\n\nVia Pignasecca, 22, 80134 Napoli NA\n\nMore information on pizzeria and trattoria Al 22❯\n\nEmbracing the mantra \"Vivere di pizza è meraviglioso\" (living of pizza is marvellous), Vincenzo Capuano's passion for all things pizza is palpable in every bite. Born in 1989, Capuano has quickly risen to fame as the 2022 World Champion in Contemporary Pizza, amassing a large following on social media and captivating estimators across Italy. From Bari to Milan, Capuano has established a series of successful venues, with multiple locations in Naples alone, including the restaurant in Piazza Vittorio and openings in the Vomero district and Piazza Trieste e Trento. With its high and airy crust to cut with scissors, Capuano's pizza is as good for taste buds as it is for the eyes. It's one of the best you'll eat in Naples in 2024.\n\nP.zza Vittoria, 8, 80121 Napoli NA\n\nMore information on Vincenzo Capuano❯\n\nBehind the birth of this pizzeria is an iconic story almost worthy of a film or TV series. Pizzeria Mammina was born in the last century when two seamstresses from Mergellina, amidst embroidery, patching, sewing and de-sewing, passed on cooking tips and then delighted in putting them into practice on Sundays at what is one of the traditional lunches of the Neapolitans. Realising their culinary talent, the two seamstresses decided to take over the tailor's shop where they worked and turn it into a Neapolitan trattoria, that today ranks among the best pizzerias in Naples, with three locations in the city. Mammina's menus include typical local products and food from other Italian regions. The genuineness of Mammina derives from the choice to include organic or km 0 food on the menu, thus supporting a healthy and productive supply chain.\n\nVia Partenope, 15/18, 8012, Napoli NA\n\nVia Santa Brigida, 65, 80132 Napoli NA\n\nVia Duomo, 235, 80138, Napoli NA\n\nMore information on Mammina Pizza e Cucina Genuina❯\n\nLino Ranieri carries with him the legacy of four generations of restaurateurs and a great passion for arts and history. Family traditions and personal interests merge with his culinary vision, brought to life in the beautiful and central setting of Casa Reale, just a stone's throw from the Maschio Angioino and the San Carlo theatre. Perusing the menu, you'll find the classics of Neapolitan cuisine: genovese, pasta e patate, spaghetti alla Nerano. Nevertheless, you'll also bump into intriguing detours that hint at a kind of creativity not necessarily tied to tradition (like ravioli with zucchini flowers, cheese, and prawns). Anyway, we are here to talk about pizza, so let's get to the point: Casa Reale makes one of the best pizzas in Naples. We were won over by its contemporary dough, fluffy and highly digestible, and locally sourced ingredients. A rustic yet smart venue in an excellent location does the rest.\n\nVia San Carlo, 27/28/29, 80133 Napoli NA\n\nMore information on Casa Reale di Lino Ranieri❯\n\nIn the heart of the kingdom of pizza, the historic center of Naples, there is an innovative yet traditional place that keeps pace with its delicate flavors. Antonio Sorbillo, who gives his name to the pizzeria, has respected and consolidated the tradition of pizza but has brought a new wind to the way of working the dough, rolling out and decorating- not garnishing- the pizzas. The dough itself is different in its texture. The double-zero flour is always the same but the dosages change the leavening times and the choice of raw materials to season the pizza, which is always thin but does not overflow from the plate, remaining an extra large pizza. The sign of tradition is evident but what can be seen most is the dexterity of the under-30 pizza makers who populate the kitchen and who are part of the new tradition of Neapolitan pizza makers that has been depopulating in recent years with a pizza with a wide and soft crust and with a reinterpretation of traditional flavors.\n\nVia dei Tribunali, 38, 80138 Napoli NA\n\nMore information on Antonio Sorbillo❯\n\nOne of the best pizzas in Naples for 2024 is the crowning glory of Totò Sapore, a traditional restaurant helmed by master pizzaiolo and entrepreneur Angelo Ranieri. At his headquarters on Viale Antonio Gramsci, very close to the splendid seafront, you can savour reassuring dishes prepared to perfection. The flavours represent the authentic tastes of Neapolitan cuisine, presented in a format that captivates even the most discerning connoisseurs. Try the genovese with mezzanelli to believe it: it's addictive. But let's get back to pizza. Ranieri, a world champion in 2017, creates doughs that are light and easily digestible. Our recommendation is to dive straight in and indulge in more tantalising variations like succulent Mammà: a topping of ragù, parmesan fondue, sautéed aubergines, and meatloaf, all held together by a ricotta-stuffed crust. Aren't you already hungry?\n\nViale Antonio Gramsci, 18/B, 80122 Napoli NA\n\nMore information about pizzeria Totò Sapore❯\n\nNaples is a land of historic pizzerias that have \"raised\" generations of Neapolitans. These are places that feel like home, where the youth of yesterday, now grandparents, continue to return with their children and grandchildren, year after year, decade after decade. Time passes, but the places that hold our hearts remain the same. Pizzeria Trianon is undoubtedly one of them. Founded in 1924 by Ciro Leone and Giorgina De Somma, it is among the custodians of the authentic Neapolitan pizza tradition. The establishment on Via Pietro Colletta, right in the heart of the historic centre, was a regular haunt for the great Napoli artists of the last century: Totò, Macario, Nino Taranto. After performing at the Trianon, the iconic theatre from which the pizzeria takes its name, they would pass by to enjoy a bountiful \"ruota di carro.\" Thin, soft, and so large that the plate cannot contain it, the house speciality is a true delight!\n\nVia Pietro Colletta, 44, 80139 Napoli NA\n\nMore info on Pizzeria Trianon❯"
