        "text": "Abstract\n\nSTEP (the SMC in Time: Evolution of a Prototype interacting late-type dwarf galaxy) is a Guaranteed Time Observation survey being performed at the VST (the ESO VLT Survey Telescope). STEP will image an area of 74 deg2 covering the main body of the Small Magellanic Cloud (32 deg2), the Bridge that connects it to the Large Magellanic Cloud (30 deg2) and a small part of the Magellanic Stream (2 deg2). Our g, r, i, Hα photometry is able to resolve individual stars down to magnitudes well below the main-sequence turn-off of the oldest populations. In this first paper, we describe the observing strategy, the photometric techniques and the upcoming data products of the survey. We also present preliminary results for the first two fields for which data acquisition is completed, including some detailed analysis of the two stellar clusters IC 1624 and NGC 419.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\nDwarf galaxies in the Local Group provide a distinct laboratory for studying and testing galaxy formation theories and cosmology. To understand the history of formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as their interactions with the environment, we need to study the 3D structure and the distributions of age, chemical abundance and kinematics of both stellar and gaseous components. We also need to obtain a global picture of the star formation history (SFH), accounting for both the intrinsic evolution and the effects of interactions with neighbouring systems. This is best achieved in nearby galaxies, where individual stars can be resolved down to faint absolute magnitudes, thus, probing stellar masses from high to low and ages from young to old. In closer systems, the stellar populations can be characterized in exquisite detail, with deep photometry and spectroscopy, and their SFHs can be reliably derived over the whole Hubble time, from the most recent epochs back to the earliest ones (see e.g. Tolstoy, Hill & Tosi 2009, and references therein).\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, MV = −16.8 ± 0.2 mag; D⊙ ∼ 64 kpc; de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991; Udalski et al. 1999) is the closest dwarf galaxy of late morphological type, hence, the ideal target for detailed studies of the properties of this most common class of galaxies. Its mass (between 1 and 5 × 109 M⊙; e.g. Kallivayalil, van der Marel & Alcock 2006; Bekki & Stanimirović 2009, and references therein) is at the upper limit of the typical late-type dwarf masses. Its high gas content (⁠|$M_{\\rm H\\,{\\small {I}}} =4 \\times 10^8$| M⊙; Brüns et al. 2005) and low present-day metallicity (Z = 0.004; see e.g. Russell & Bessell 1989) are also common features of dwarf irregulars (dIrrs) and starburst dwarfs.\n\nThe old populations in dIrrs may be representative of the stellar content of the early, gas-rich galaxies that are believed to have contributed significantly to the build-up of more massive galaxies (e.g. De Lucia & Helmi 2008; Cooper et al. 2010) more than 9 Gyr ago. These old stellar populations are quite a bit more metal poor than the comparatively high present-day SMC metallicity of Z = 0.004 (see e.g. Kunth & Östlin 2000).\n\nAs a member of the nearest group of interacting galaxies, the SMC is also an ideal benchmark to study the effects of tidal interactions on galaxy evolution. In fact, there are clear signatures that the SMC is interacting with its neighbours, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Milky Way (MW). In particular, the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are connected by an H i-dominated gaseous Bridge (Hindman, Kerr & McGee 1963; Irwin, Kunkel & Demers 1985; Harris 2007) that, like the Magellanic Stream, may result from their mutual gravitational effects and/or the influence of the MW. The SMC Wing, the portion of the SMC main body protruding asymmetrically towards the LMC (Shapley 1940), may also be the result of tidal forces. Also, the bar of the SMC, which stands out when using young populations as tracers, has a highly asymmetric and elongated structure with its north-eastern part closer to us than its south-western part (Haschke, Grebel & Duffau 2012b). To complicate matters further, remarkable line-of-sight depth variations are well established in the SMC. For instance, Hatzidimitriou & Hawkins (1989), using horizontal branch (HB) and red clump (RC) stars, found that the north-eastern periphery of the galaxy (at more than 2 kpc from the optical centre) suffers an average depth of 17 kpc with a maximum of 23 kpc, while the south-west region shows a depth of about 10 kpc on average. More recently, Subramanian & Subramaniam (2009) found a depth between 0.67 and 9.53 kpc, with an increase near the optical centre. Finally, Glatt et al. (2008b) found depths between 10 and 17 kpc using the RC of several populous star clusters.\n\nState-of-the-art computations based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data (Kallivayalil et al. 2013) assume that the Clouds are bound to each other, with the SMC on an elliptical orbit around the LMC. It was estimated that the frequency of MC-like systems in the Universe is only a few per cent (e.g. Robotham et al. 2012) and they may have entered the MW potential only recently.\n\nThe Bridge holds important clues about the most recent (the last ∼100 Myr) interaction between the Clouds, its own formation history and possible origin. Intermediate-age and old stars, probably stripped by either Cloud, may also be present in the Bridge (Bagheri, Cioni & Napiwotzki 2013; Noël et al. 2013) and would provide additional information about its origin.\n\nA wealth of data on the SMC is available in the literature, although not as complete as for its bigger companion, the LMC. Yet, we are still missing crucial information for our understanding of how the SMC has formed and evolved. For these reasons, a long-term international project has been set up with the aim of studying in detail the stellar populations, the structure and the evolution of the SMC in space and time, thanks to the exploitation of high-performance telescopes, such as the HST, the VLT (Very Large Telescope) and other 10 m class telescopes. The project aims at collecting both photometric and spectroscopic data to study the (variable and non-variable) stellar populations of the SMC, from the oldest to the youngest objects and derive their chemical abundances, spatial distribution and kinematics. In particular, HST is providing high spatial resolution photometry of selected SMC fields, along with old and young clusters (PIs J. Gallagher and A. Nota; see e.g. Nota et al. 2006; Sabbi et al. 2007; Glatt et al. 2008a,b, 2009, 2011; Sabbi et al. 2009; Cignoni et al. 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013), whereas VLT spectroscopy with FORS in the Ca ii triplet (PI E. Grebel) allows us to study the age–metallicity relation of the SMC clusters (Kayser et al. 2008).\n\nIn this context, the scope of this paper is to present the first results from the VST (VLT Survey Telescope) survey STEP (The SMC in Time: Evolution of a Prototype interacting late-type dwarf galaxy; PI V. Ripepi). We describe the STEP survey in detail in Section 2, while the data reduction is reported in Section 3. The resulting colour–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for two fields are discussed in Section 4, an example of analysis of star clusters is given in Section 5. A brief summary closes the paper.\n\n2 THE STEP SURVEY\n\nThe STEP survey is based on VST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO; PI V.Ripepi). The survey aims at performing the first deep and homogeneous optical photometric monitoring of the entire SMC body as well as of the Bridge. The VST (Capaccioli & Schipani 2011) is an ideal instrument for a homogeneous survey of the properties of the stellar populations present in the SMC components (main body, Wing, Bridge, outskirts), thanks to its wide field of view (FoV, 1 deg2) and a magnitude limit optimal for the SMC distance. It provides the most natural complement to HST imaging, which reaches much fainter magnitudes with high spatial resolution, but over very small FoVs.\n\nSome of us (VR, MRC, GC and MM) are deeply involved in the VMC@VISTA European Southern Observatory (ESO) Public survey (PI: M.R. Cioni) that is achieving YJKs photometry of the Magellanic System (LMC, SMC, Bridge, Stream, 184 deg2 at Ks = 20.3 mag). STEP and VMC@VISTA are designed to complement each other: the target fields of the two surveys overlap completely in the SMC and Bridge region, and will provide, when completed, homogeneous |$g,r,i,{\\rm H}{\\alpha },Y,J,K_\\mathrm{s}$| photometry for millions of stars in the SMC and the Bridge.\n\nThe CMD, containing stars born over the whole lifetime of the galaxy, is a fossil record of its SFH. With STEP, we aim at investigating the stellar populations of the SMC with CMDs at least a couple of magnitudes fainter than the main-sequence (MS) turn-off (MSTO) of the oldest population. This is crucial to break the age–metallicity degeneracy and safely recover the SFH of the investigated objects. The SFH will be derived using the synthetic CMD technique (e.g. Tosi et al. 1991; Cignoni & Tosi 2010). This kind of study has already been performed on several SMC fields both with ground-based and HST data (e.g. Dolphin et al. 2001; Zaritsky et al. 2002; Harris & Zaritsky 2004; McCumber, Garnett & Dufour 2005; Chiosi et al. 2006; Noël et al. 2007, 2009; Cignoni et al. 2013; Weisz et al. 2013, and references therein). Our plan, however, is to obtain CMDs significantly fainter than the oldest MSTO for the entire galaxy, including its halo and the wing in the direction of the LMC. This will allow us to infer for the first time the SFH in a homogeneous way over the whole SMC and over the entire Hubble time.\n\nWe intend to use classical variable stars (RR Lyrae, Cepheids, anomalous Cepheids, δ Scuti etc.) as population tracers, especially in the unexplored region of the Bridge. Indeed, these variable stars provide us insights on the conditions at the epoch of their formation by probing young ages: 50–200 Myr with short- and intermediate-period classical Cepheids; intermediate ages: ∼1–2 Gyr, with the anomalous Cepheids and old ages: t > 10 Gyr, with the RR Lyrae stars (for previous similar studies on the SMC body, see e.g. Haschke et al. 2012b; Subramanian & Subramaniam 2012). Eventually, the time series images are stacked, allowing us to derive deep CMDs and, in turn, to perform a quantitative analysis of the SFH of the investigated tiles (in analogy with the VISTA telescope surveys, hereinafter we call ‘tile’ one single OmegaCAM pointing), completing the information gathered from the analysis of the pulsating stars.\n\nSTEP also aims at investigating the first stages of star formation (SF) by securing a complete mapping of pre-MS (PMS) objects. A survey of young stellar objects in the SMC was conducted with the Spitzer satellite by Sewiło et al. (2013) and HST has already permitted to examine in detail the PMS in a number of SMC regions (Nota et al. 2006; Carlson et al. 2007; Cignoni et al. 2011), but again only with the wide field VST survey we will be able to infer the whole distribution.\n\nSTEP will allow us to identify and survey the whole population of SMC star clusters of any type, age and mass above our detection limit. We will make a homogeneous census of the SMC candidate clusters, and thus be able to ascertain whether NGC 121 is indeed the only example of an old system in the SMC, as currently believed, or other as old or possibly older clusters are identifiable (see e.g. Shara et al. 1998; Glatt et al. 2008a).\n\nIn summary, STEP will eventually allow us to answer several open questions: 1) Are the trends of SFH with position connected with the interaction history of the SMC? (2) Do field and cluster components share the same SFH? (3) What are the cluster and field age–metallicity relations? (4) What are the evolution properties of low-metallicity stars in the mass range 1–2 M⊙? (5) Which is the variable star population of the Bridge? (6) Which is the SFH of the intracloud population? (7) How did the stellar component of the Bridge form: by tidal stripping or local formation (Bekki & Chiba 2007; Harris 2007)? (8) What is the impact of metallicity on PMS accretion and on the global properties of SF (SF rate and efficiency, and initial mass function)?\n\nThere is no other completed or ongoing optical survey on nearby galaxies as deep, wide and panchromatic as STEP. The Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey (MCPS; see e.g. Zaritsky et al. 2000, 2002; Harris & Zaritsky 2004, and references therein) provided photometry of about 16 deg2 centred on the SMC. As we shall see in the next sections, compared to MCPS, the STEP survey has the major advantage of observing with a spatial resolution (i.e. CCD pixel size) 3.5 times higher and with significantly better average seeing conditions. These occurrences mean that STEP can observe stars as faint as g ∼ 22.5-23 mag (i.e. the magnitude of the oldest MSTO) with uncertainties lower than 10–15 per cent even in the most crowded regions of the SMC. The OGLE III survey (see Udalski et al. 2008) provides an unpaired amount of information for the variable stars in the SMC body, but, again, it is much shallower than STEP and does not cover the Bridge. The next-generation OGLE survey (OGLE IV) covers a wider area around the Magellanic System, including the Bridge, but is still shallower than STEP. The Southern Sky Survey (http://rsaa.anu.edu.au/research/projects/skymapper-southern-sky-survey) that is being performed with the Skymapper telescope (Keller et al. 2007) will observe the SMC and the Bridge, but at shallower magnitude limit (g ∼ 22.9 mag with S/N1 ∼ 5) than STEP and with a worse spatial resolution. Furthermore, their planned six-epoch sampling is too coarse for an accurate identification and characterization of the Bridge variables. First results of the Outer Limits Survey, an NOAO survey designed to detect, map and characterize the extended structure of the MCs, were presented by Saha et al. (2010). However, contrarily to STEP, this survey aims at investigating only the outer regions of the MCs. NOAO observations to further sample the Magellanic stellar periphery have recently began as part of the Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (Olsen et al. 2014).\n\n2.1 Observing strategy of the STEP survey\n\nTo address the questions listed above, we proposed, and obtained, to use part of the VST GTO time allocated by ESO to Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) in return for the procurement of the telescope and acquire g, r, i, Hα2 photometry for 72 deg2 covering the whole SMC body, the Bridge and 2 deg2 of the Magellanic Stream down to a limiting magnitude (AB system) g ∼ 24 mag with S/N = 10, and r(Hα) ∼ 22.5 mag with S/N = 5. The survey is organized with tiles of 1 deg2 each, partially overlapping with each other to allow a homogeneous calibration.\n\nIn addition, we acquired 24-epoch time series photometry of 8 deg2 on the Bridge down to V ≃ 19.5 mag (i.e. reaching fainter than the mean magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars), with S/N = 100. When summed up, these images will allow us to reach g ∼ 24 mag with S/N = 10. Originally, we planned to image with time series the whole Bridge. However, after the first observations in Period 88 (see below), we found that the huge overheads in pointing and filter changing made the observing efficiency (shutter time/total duration of the exposure) so low that we decided to complete only the eight Bridge fields already started and cover the remaining Bridge fields using the same observing strategy adopted for the SMC body (i.e. without time series).\n\nDetails on the instrumentation and the observing strategy are reported in the following sub-sections, while the data reduction is discussed in Section 3.\n\n2.2 The VST telescope and OmegaCAM\n\nThe VST (built by the INAF–Osservatorio Astronomico di Capodimonte, Naples, Italy) is a 2.6-m wide field optical survey telescope (Capaccioli & Schipani 2011). VST is placed at Cerro Paranal, Chile on the same platform as the VLT 8-m telescopes. VST has an f/5.5 modified Ritchey–Chretien optical layout on an alt-azimuth mounting. It features a two-lens wide-field corrector, with the dewar window acting as a third lens (and an optional atmospheric dispersion compensator – ADC) giving a correct FoV of 1 deg2 (see Schipani et al. 2012). The primary mirror is a concave 2.6 m hyperbolic meniscus axially supported by 84 active supports, placed on four rings and laterally sustained by passive astatic levers. The convex hyperbolic secondary mirror is controlled by a hexapod with 5 degrees of freedom. The telescope is equipped with OmegaCAM, a 1 deg2 camera build by a consortium of European Institutes (Kuijken 2011). The camera is a 32-CCD, 16k×16k detector mosaic with 0.214 arcsec per pixel scale (for the two-lens corrector, 0.215 for the ADC configuration). The CCDs are thinned, blue-sensitive, three-edge buttable CCD44-82 devices of high cosmetic quality made by e2v. The field distortion is very low, and the image scale is practically constant over the whole FoV. The gaps between the CCDs are rather narrow, and the overall geometric filling factor of the array is 91.4 per cent.\n\nOmegaCAM can handle 12 filters that can be changed during the night. Currently, the available filters include the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ugriz set, Johnson B and V filters, plus several narrow-band filter mosaics such as Hα. It is important to note that the VST filter system is actually based on the USNO u′g′r′i′ system (Smith et al. 2002) which is slightly different from SDSS ugriz (for details, see Fukugita et al. 1996; Gunn et al. 2001). This is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 where the throughput of the filters used in the present survey are displayed and compared with those of the SDSS (properly rescaled to improve the comparison).\n\nHowever, since we will calibrate our data on the ‘natural’ SDSS system, in this paper, we use the ugriz notation. The OmegaCAM calibration plan ensures that all data can be photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 0.05 mag and 0.1 arcsec rms precision, respectively.\n\n2.3 STEP area coverage\n\nThe main aim of the survey is to image the body of the SMC and the Bridge. The choice of the survey fields was driven by:\n\nComplete coverage of the SMC+Bridge area. In particular, we tried to include the classical SMC diameter limit at B ≈ 25 mag arcsec−2 (Bothun & Thompson 1988) as well as major features traced by the distribution of stars, star clusters (e.g. Irwin 1991; Bica et al. 2008) and H i gas (e.g. Muller et al. 2003; Staveley-Smith et al. 2003; Hatzidimitriou et al. 2005) for both the SMC and the Bridge.\n\nMaximize the overlap with the VMC survey (see Cioni et al. 2011).\n\nIn order to accomplish these tasks efficiently, we used the Survey Area Definition Tool (SADT; Arnaboldi et al. 2008). A geodesic rectangle with vertexes α = 23:53:54; 04:29:30; δ = −75:54:46; −70:02:00 was generated as the basis of the tile-creation process. The unnecessary tiles were removed leading to the coverage shown in Fig. 2. This figure shows the 72 tiles (coloured boxes), which define the area surveyed by STEP (apart from the two tiles placed into the Magellanic Stream). The tiled area covers almost completely the distribution of stellar clusters and associations (black dots) and maximizes the overlap with the VMC survey (grey boxes).\n\nThe coordinates of the centres of each STEP tile are given in Table 2. Each tile is identified by two numbers: the first number gives the row and the second the column of the position of the tile in the mosaic that covers the surveyed area. Row numbers increase from south to north and column numbers increase from west to east.\n\nIn the process of defining the mosaic, SADT requires as input the observing parameters that are associated with small (i.e. jittering) and large (i.e. mosaicking) displacements in the tile position. For the STEP survey, the maximum jitter was set to 10 arcsec, and the tile overlap in α and δ to 120 arcsec.\n\n2.4 STEP observations\n\nWe can distinguish our observations as ‘deep’ (on the SMC body, on the Wing and on part of the Bridge) and ‘time series’ (seven fields in the Bridge and one in the SMC periphery). Table 3 describes the main parameters of the VST observations, including the exposure times. For the time series, we decided to take a single exposure per epoch and filter. The images at different epochs of each tile were slightly dithered to cover the gaps between CCDs in the stacked images. As for the deep exposures, we divided the total exposure time, as estimated by the OmegaCAM Exposure Time Calculator3 into 5 or 10 sub-exposures (see Table 3). To avoid saturation for the bright SMC/Bridge stars, we also acquired five short (25 s each) exposures per tile. We chose the same dithering pattern for both time series and deep exposures. In particular, we adopted the ‘5-point diag’ pattern4 which offsets the telescope by the same amount between successive exposures. The size of the steps in X and Y directions is as large as the largest gap in the mosaic, i.e. about ±25 arcsec in X and ±85 arcsec in Y. A typical weight map for the stacked tile is shown in Fig. 3, where the brighter regions are those with larger S/N. Although the weight map is provided as output by the vst–tube package, we did not use it in the derivation of the photometry (see next sections).\n\nFor the deep images, we required clear sky, but we allowed for thin cirrus for the time series photometry, to increase the probability of programme execution. Moreover, images obtained in each of the two filters were left free to be acquired in different nights. Hence, to perform the photometric calibration of the data, we need secondary standard stars. For time series tiles, this was secured by requiring that at least two of the epochs were taken under photometric condition. To calibrate the deep tiles, instead, we planned for a couple of short exposure g, i images (see Table 3) to be acquired during a photometric night. These images were sufficiently deep to provide a huge amount of stars to be used as secondary standards.\n\nFinally, we exploited the overlap between adjacent tiles to correct for residuals in the photometric zero-points. The overall zero-point of the photometry was checked using calibrations obtained during different observing runs.\n\nMost of the observations of the STEP survey are obtained in service mode by ESO staff. This guarantees efficiency of operations and a high level of data homogeneity. Only a few hours of observation were conducted in visitor mode (GTO compensation time).\n\nThe constraints on the observing conditions varied as a function of the crowding of the target regions. In general, for the SMC body and the Wing, we required a better seeing than for the less-crowded tiles in the Bridge. A summary of the observing constraints is provided in Table 4.\n\nSince the SMC and the Bridge never rise above 50° from the horizon, the seeing measured on the images is expected to be significantly larger than that measured at the zenith. Hence, to keep a reasonable probability of realization of the observations, we decided to accept a seeing limit of 1.0–1.1 arcsec (corresponding to ∼0.7 arcsec at the zenith) even for the crowded body of the SMC. These values of seeing allow us to reach our scientific goal in terms of magnitude limit.\n\nA more relaxed constraint of 1.4 arcsec seeing was used for the uncrowded regions of the Bridge to be imaged in time series mode. For the Bridge tiles to be observed with one-epoch deep images, this constraint was reduced to 1.1 arcsec to account for the shorter total exposure time with respect to those obtained by summing up all the time series images.\n\nThe efficiency (hours of actual observations/hours allocated) of the STEP observations is shown in Table 5. A quick comparison of columns 2 and 3 reveals that, at face value, the observing efficiency was of the order of 54 per cent. However, it can be noticed that the actual efficiency was significantly lower. Table 5 also reports the average grade5 from Period 88 to 91. It can be seen that grades ‘A’ and ‘B’ were obtained only in 27 and 42 per cent of the cases, respectively. The remaining 31 per cent of the images was graded as ‘D’, i.e. with characteristics that are by more than 20 per cent outside the limits we had set, in terms of seeing and/or ellipticity. This last occurrence is particularly harmful because it prevents us from obtaining a good astrometric solution for the images composing one mosaic, making the tiles sometimes completely useless, and to be re-observed in the following semester. Hence, even if the observing efficiency of the STEP observations was formally of 54 per cent, the survey efficiency, i.e. the percentage of useful data, was well below 50 per cent.\n\n2.5 STEP progress\n\nAs shown in Table 5, STEP observations started on P88. Time series photometry was collected till P90. The number of epochs for each tile is listed in Table 6. Given the extremely low efficiency (shutter time/total duration of OB) of this kind of observations (as low as 25 per cent), we decided to acquire only deep tiles starting from P91.\n\nAs for the deep tiles, at the moment of writing, there are 16 tiles completed (see Table 2 and Fig. 2), whereas several additional tiles were so far only partially observed (see Table 2). The observations in r, Hα will start as soon as the g, i survey is completed.\n\n2.5.1 The first two completed tiles\n\nWe have chosen to give highest priority to observations of two tiles which include fields already observed by our group with the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS): one in the most active region of the SMC main body and the other in the most external regions of the Wing. The former is tile 4_6, around the very young cluster NGC 346, and the latter is tile 3_7 in the Wing. They cover the NGC 346 and the SFH9 ACS fields observed, respectively, by the HST programmes 10248 (PI Nota; see Nota et al. 2006) and 10396 (PI Gallagher; see Sabbi et al. 2009). This allows an immediate comparison of the VST photometry with the exquisite one from ACS, as well as an independent check on the calibration. The plates shown in Figs 4 and 5 report the OmegaCAM@VST mosaic images relative to tiles 3_7 and 4_6, respectively. Fig. 6 exhibits an enlargement of the northern part of plate 5, including the well-known star-forming region NGC 346 and several other interesting clusters and associations.\n\nSince STEP covers the whole SMC, it will eventually include not only all our HST fields, but also those studied and published in the astronomical literature, both from space and from the ground.\n\n3 DATA REDUCTION\n\nIn this section, we describe the procedure adopted for the treatment of the raw data and the production of the final catalogue ready for the scientific exploitation. In the following, we refer mainly to the deep exposures. Details on the treatment of time series data will be provided in a dedicated paper.\n\n3.1 Pre-reduction, astrometry and photometric calibration\n\nTo have the same zero-point for all the mosaic chips, a gain-equalization procedure has been used. The procedure finds the relative gain correction which gives the same background level in adjacent CCDs. For the OmegaCAM@VST images, it was necessary to apply a further correction caused by scattered light. This is frequent for wide-field imagers where telescope and instrument baffling can be an issue. This results in a centrally localized additive component to the background, and the flat-field does not accurately estimate the spatial response of the detector. Indeed, if not corrected, after flat-fielding, the image background would appear perfectly flat but the photometric response would be position dependent (Andersen, Freyhammer & Storm 1995). This error can be mitigated through the determination and application of the IC map. The IC map was derived using SDSS DR8 stars in properly selected fields. The magnitude residuals (VST-SDSS) as function of the position were fitted using a generalized adaptive method (GAM) in order to obtain an IC map used to correct the science images during the pre-reduction stage. The GAM allows us to obtain a well-behaved surface also in case the FoV is not uniformly sampled by standard stars. As an example, we show in Figs 7 and 8 the IC map and the position dependence of the zero-point before and after the IC application.\n\nThe absolute photometric calibration was computed on the nights reported in Table 8 comparing the observed magnitude of standard stars with SDSS photometry.\n\nIn Table 8, we report the zero-points and colour terms obtained using the Photcal tool.7 Since the photometric standard star fields were observed with a span in airmass too small for a suitable fit, an average value for the extinction coefficient was adopted. Relative photometric correction among the exposures is obtained by minimizing the quadratic sum of the differences in magnitude between overlapping detections. The tool used for such task is SCAMP (Bertin 2006). Absolute and relative astrometric calibration is performed using SCAMP as well. Resampling for the application of the astrometric solution and final image co-addition has been obtained using SWARP (Bertin 2002).\n\nWe note that the lack of a significant number of standard stars with (g − i) < 0.0 mag makes it difficult to constrain the photometric calibration in the colour range −0.7 < (g − i) < 0.0 mag. For this reason, the photometric calibration for stars with the bluest colours, corresponding to the young stellar populations in the SMC, could be less accurate than for stars in the colour range 0.0 < (g − i) < 2.5 mag. We are working to solve this problem by observing a significant number of blue stars in the Stripe 82 standard field (Ivezić et al. 2007). These observations will allow us to accurately constrain the colour terms in the calibration equations. In the meantime, we can check quantitatively the goodness of our photometry by comparing our data with those from the MCPS survey. To this aim, we have first to transform the MCPS BVI photometry into SDSS g, i. This can be achieved by adopting the Jordi et al. (2006) results8 for Population I objects, as the metallicity of the SMC is closer to Population I than Population II stars. We note that these transformations are nominally valid for (V − I) < 1.8 mag, i.e. (g − i) < 2.1 mag; however, it is not clear which is the validity boundary towards blue colours. Secondly, we have matched the STEP and MCPS catalogues accepting stars within 1 arcsec and with S/N ≥ 20 in each band (for both surveys). The result of this comparison for tiles 3_7 and 4_6 is shown in Fig. 9. These figures show that there is fairly good agreement between the two photometries. Even if a significant scatter (∼0.08 mag) is present, the formal average differences (in the sense STEP-MCPS) are Δg(3_7) ∼ −0.004 mag; Δi(3_7) ∼ −0.018 mag; Δ(g − i)(3_7) ∼ +0.014 mag; Δg(4_6) ∼ +0.014 mag; Δi(4_6) ∼ −0.014 mag; Δ(g − i)(4_6) ∼ +0.027 mag. The maximum deviation is less than 3 per cent in colour in tile 4_6, confirming the absence of significant photometric errors on the calibration.\n\n3.2 Photometry\n\nOur fields present different levels of crowding. The SMC body, in particular, is heavily congested with stars. This requires the use of point spread function (PSF) photometry. We employed the package daophot IV/allstar (Stetson 1987, 1992) and the PSF function was left to vary across the FoV. Usually a first- or second-order variation of the PSF with radial position was sufficient to recover star shapes even at the edges of the tiles.\n\nAt the end of the pre-reduction procedure, we were left with three images for each filter and deep tile. Two are mosaics resulting from the stack of the short and long exposures, respectively (see Table 3), the third image is the single shot acquired to produce secondary standard stars. Each image was measured separately. For each filter, the output short- and long-exposure files were matched to adjust the residual photometric zero-point difference (usually of the order of 0.01–0.015 mag) by averaging the photometry of the stars in common. This match was performed in α and δ, which were calculated from the allstarx,y physical coordinates using the World Coordinate System of the images and the package xy2sky.9 For the match, we used the stilts10 package setting a tolerance in both α and δ of 0.25 arcsec, i.e. slightly more than 1 pixel. The resulting g, i catalogues were matched in the same way, allowing us to obtain a unique catalogue including all the photometry for each tile.\n\nSimilarly, the pair of g, i single exposures acquired with the purpose of providing secondary standards were matched. For all the stars in common, we then applied the colour terms listed in Table 8 (we recall that the zero-point is already photometrically calibrated by the vst–tube pipeline), obtaining the desired secondary standard stars.\n\nFinally, the last step of the whole procedure was the refinement of the photometric calibration. This is achieved by matching the catalogue of the secondary standard stars with that including all the photometry of the tile and correcting for the possible difference in zero-points. Since most of the data have been acquired in ‘clear’ conditions, corrections were found to be small, of the order of a few per cent.\n\nTo show the quality of the photometry, we report in Fig. 10 the errors provided by allstar in g and i as a function of the magnitude for the nine sub-frames in which we virtually divided each tile with the aim of identifying possible differences in the behaviour of the photometric errors.\n\n3.3 Completeness\n\nA detailed estimate of the completeness of our photometry is a fundamental step for an accurate reconstruction of the SFH (see e.g. Tosi et al. 2001, and references therein). We followed the usual procedure of adding artificial stars to the images and calculating the percentage of the recovered stars. More in detail, the steps of our procedure were the following:\n\nThe colour, the magnitude and the relative frequency of the stars to be inserted in the images were calculated on the basis of a synthetic CMD roughly representing a population characteristic of the SMC and Bridge. The range of magnitude taken into account was 14 < g < 26.5 mag and the total number of artificial stars was about 2 million for each tile, distributed along many different completeness experiments (see next point).\n\nTo avoid self-crowding, we sub-divided the images in virtual boxes 70×70 pixels in size each. One artificial star is placed inside each box at random position, so that we can place several thousands of artificial stars avoiding the problem of self-crowding.\n\nA star is considered as recovered if it is measured both in g and i and if its position and magnitude are returned within 0.25 arcsec and 0.75 mag of its input values, respectively.\n\nThe result of this procedure is shown in Fig. 11 for the two tiles presented in this paper. To verify the presence of possible differences in completeness within each image, the tiles were divided into nine sub-frames 20 arcmin × 21 arcmin each. The completeness in g and i are represented with different colours. The figure shows that the magnitude level corresponding to 50 per cent completeness is brighter (g ∼ 23.5 mag) for tile 4_6, which is much more crowded than tile 3_7 (g ∼ 24-24.5 mag). It is instructive to compare these values with those obtained with HST by Sabbi et al. (2009) for the fields SFH9 and SFH4, included in the tiles 3_7 and 4_6, respectively. Indeed, an inspection of their fig. 3 reveals that for HST data 50 per cent completeness was reached at V ≈ 26.2 mag, I ≈ 26 mag and V ≈ 24 mag, I ≈ 25.2 mag for fields SFH9 and SFH4, respectively. Even if the g and V magnitudes cannot be directly compared, we can roughly conclude that VST data become severely incomplete at about 1–1.5 mag brighter than with the HST photometry.\n\nArtificial stars also provide a realistic estimate of the photometric error, hence, the best age resolution achievable within STEP. In the range 22.5 < g < 23 mag (approximately the magnitude of the oldest TOs in the SMC), tile 4_6 is characterized by a photometric accuracy in g magnitude of about 0.2 mag. This translates into a maximum precision of ∼17 per cent in the derived ages (see Vandenberg & Bell 1985), which is equivalent to an age error of 1.7 Gyr at 10 Gyr. For tile 3_7, however, crowding conditions are less severe and the age error at 10 Gyr drops at about 1 Gyr. Although these performances are not comparable with those reached with HST, they are superior to the performances of the MCPS, where the maximum age resolution at 10 Gyr is worse than 3 Gyr.\n\n4 THE STELLAR POPULATIONS IN THE CENTRAL AND WING REGIONS\n\nAs planned by our observing strategy, the first STEP fields for which data acquisition was completed were tile 4_6, around the very young cluster NGC 346, and tile 3_7 in the Wing. As described in Section 2.3, field 3_7 includes our HST/ACS field SFH9, while field 4_6 covers our HST/ACS pointing on NGC 346 and also overlaps with the ESO Public Survey VMC tile SMC 5_4.\n\n4.1 Tile 3_7\n\n4.1.1 CMD\n\nThe CMD of all the stars measured in tile 3_7 is displayed in Fig. 12. There are a number of stellar evolution phases easily identifiable in the CMD, including a well-defined and extended MS, a prominent RC (visible at 0.75 < g − i < 1 mag and 19.7 < g < 20.2 mag) and a blue loop (BL; mostly visible at 0.7 < g − i < 0.9 mag and 19 < g < 19.5 mag).\n\nThere are also contaminants. Fig. 13 shows the data CMD with overlaid a simulation11 of the MW foreground expected in tile 3_7, according to the Galactic model for star counts described in Castellani et al. (2002) and Cignoni et al. (2007). Different colours represent the three major galactic components, namely halo (blue), thick disc (red) and thin disc (green). According to this comparison, we suggest that in the CMD of Fig. 12, the group of stars in the colour range 1.75 < g − i < 3 mag and g > 20 mag and the vertical sequence at g − i ≈ 0.6 mag and g < 18 mag are likely foreground MW stars along the line of sight. However, it is also noteworthy that simulations do not show MW stars redder than g − i ≈ 2.5 mag, while observations reach g − i ≈ 3 mag and beyond. Although there are known theoretical problems to reproduce observed stellar colours at such low temperatures, we suggest that part of the mismatch is due to background galaxies. Indeed, using near-infrared VISTA observations for LMC fields, Rubele et al. (2012) find unequivocally that background galaxies are important contaminants, dominating star counts for Y − Ks > 2 mag and Ks > 17 mag, while MW foreground stars are concentrated at Y − Ks ≈ 1–1.5 mag.\n\nIn Fig. 12, isochrones of different ages and metallicities from Marigo et al. (2008) are overlaid on the CMD. The metallicity of the youngest isochrones is assumed to be Z = 0.004, which is consistent with spectroscopic derivations from H ii regions in the SMC (see e.g. Russell & Bessell 1989; Kurt & Dufour 1998) and from stellar abundances of very young stars (see e.g. Gonzalez & Wallerstein 1998; Hunter et al. 2007, 2009; Bouret et al. 2013), while the metallicity of the older isochrones (Z = 0.001) is chosen to best fit the RGB (see e.g. Butler, Demarque & Smith 1982; Haschke et al. 2012a). The assumed distance modulus is (m − M)0 = 18.90 mag (see e.g. Harries, Hilditch & Howarth 2003), while the reddening value is E(B − V) = 0.08 mag.\n\nThe presence of bright MS stars, BL and RC stars provides circumstantial evidence that tile 3_7 has been actively forming stars for the last few Gyrs. Moreover, the conspicuous number of upper-MS (UMS) stars between the 5 and 100 Myr isochrones suggests that the region went through a recent intense SF phase producing such massive stars. Looking back in time, the next relevant feature is a rather short BL, roughly consistent with a 400–500 Myr old population, while the paucity of BL stars brighter than g = 19 mag suggests a reduced SF 100–300 Myr ago. The RC is roughly round and well populated, which implies a continuous activity at intermediate epochs. On the other hand, there is no evidence for an extended or even red HB, suggesting a very low SF rate earlier than 10 Gyr ago. Overall, these results compare well with previous investigations of the region. Using deep HST/ACS data, Cignoni et al. (2013) studied the detailed SF of a field (SFH9) included in tile 3_7. Their results show a broadly constant intermediate-age activity (1–7 Gyr ago), with a recent burst of SF overimposed, and very modest activity in the first few Gyr.\n\nIn order to better visualize the variation of extinctions and crowding conditions, we divided tile 3_7 into nine sub-regions 20 arcmin × 21 arcmin large, and compared their CMDs (see Fig. 14) to the same set of isochrones. The old isochrones bracket well all the observational RGBs, except in sub-regions C and F where the foreground reddening is probably higher.\n\nOn the other hand, the blue edge of the MS appears often bluer than our youngest models (see e.g. sub-region E). Adopting a slightly lower metallicity or reddening could mitigate this effect, but would cause other inconsistencies. In fact, the adopted metallicity (Z = 0.004) provides excellent fits to the MS derived from HST data (see e.g. Cignoni et al. 2012, 2013). Moreover, younger populations are generally more reddened than older ones (see e.g. Zaritsky et al. 2002), while the data would require the opposite. We do not elaborate further on this issue because of possible problems in the calibration of blue stars. As discussed in Section 3.1, this aspect will be improved in future papers. Here, our main aim is only to show the full potential of the STEP survey.\n\n4.1.2 Spatial distribution\n\nThe spatial distribution of stars in different evolutionary stages yields important information on the SF processes over the region. We have counted stars in different age regions of the CMD (see Fig. 15), sampling the UMS (red box), RC (green box), BL (pink box) and sub-giant branch (SGB, blue box) stars. Field contamination (FC; interlopers from the MW and background galaxies) and highly reddened RC stars are sampled with the cyan and yellow boxes, respectively. Fig. 16 shows the spatial distributions of these different groups of stars.\n\nFrom the spatial point of view, we note that populations grow more compact as one moves towards younger ages. In particular:\n\nUMS stars (top-left panel in Fig. 16) appear clumpy and irregularly distributed. Two major concentrations are visible at (α = 21.1, δ = −73.2) and (α = 18.9, δ = −73.3). In terms of age, this implies that most of the ongoing and recent (i.e. in the last 100 Myr) SF is concentrated in these locations, while the activity is stagnant in the rest of the field.\n\nBL stars (top-right panel in Fig. 16) appear more evenly spatially distributed than UMS stars, but still a bit clumpy. However, given the paucity of these objects compared to UMS stars (10 times more numerous), it is difficult to assess the significance of the various structures, except the mild gradient of increasing concentration towards the upper-right corner of the FoV, which is clearly overdense with respect to the opposite corner. Physically, this implies that either SF younger than 500 Myr and older than few Myr (the minimum age of BL stars) is occurring on extended scales, not just in few clumps like the UMS, or that stars have been able to disperse during this length of time.\n\nOverall, RC stars (middle-left panel) follow the spatial distribution of BL stars, but are more evenly distributed along the δ axis. This reflects the fact that RC stars are intermediate-age stars (1–8 Gyr ago), so they have had sufficient time to diffuse throughout the SMC. The lack of RC stars (‘hole’) around (α = 18.8, δ = −73.25) is likely due to an extended cloud of obscuring matter (actually the ‘hole’ is part of a large region showing large extinction – see fig. 4 in Haschke, Grebel & Duffau 2011). Indeed, when we look at the map (middle-right panel) of stars taken from the yellow box in the CMD of Fig. 15, we find a clear overdensity at the location of the hole, hence, suggesting that the missing RC stars are actually normal RC stars moved to the yellow box because of higher reddening. As a further support of this interpretation, Fig. 17 shows the CMD of all stars near the hole (yellow dashed box in the middle-right panel of Fig. 16). Its elongated RC, broad RGB and UMS are unique signatures of a large differential reddening. However, the total number of highly reddened stars is less than 1 per cent of the stars in the entire tile, hence, they are unnoticeable in the CMD of Fig. 12.\n\nThe distribution of SGB stars (bottom-left panel) shows a net gradient of increasing concentration from left to right, without significant excess at the upper-right corner (where BL stars are more concentrated). This mainly reflects the increasing number of star counts moving towards the SMC centre.\n\nField contaminants (bottom-right panel) are uniformly distributed over the FoV. The only few visible overdensities are likely due to MS stars scattered into the FC box because of the reddening.\n\n4.2 Tile 4_6\n\n4.2.1 CMD\n\nTile 4_6 hosts over four times more stars than tile 3_7. As a consequence, crowding is more severe and the corresponding CMD (Fig. 18) much shallower (but still 1 mag deeper than the oldest MSTO) and broader. In terms of stellar populations, there are two striking differences from 3_7's CMD (see Fig. 12): (1) 4_6's CMD shows a prominent RGB bump, just above the RC, while this feature is missing in tile 3_7; (2) the morphology of the RC is rather elliptical in the 4_6 CMD, while it shows a clear protrusion towards brighter magnitudes in tile 3_7. In terms of age/metallicity, the evidence of an RGB bump brighter than the RC is a clear indication that intermediate and old SF took place at relatively low metallicity (Z = 0.001 or less) in tile 4_6. However, its apparent lack in the tile 3_7 CMD could be just due to the lower number of stars. On the other hand, the populous RC protrusion in the tile 3_7's CMD represents a significant difference from tile 4_6, since the latter is globally much more populated. Considering that the RC protrusion is likely populated by objects at the transition between RC and BL phases, therefore, by stars with ages between 500 Myr and 1 Gyr, our conclusion is that tile 3_7 has been relatively more active than tile 4_6 at these epochs. If we take into account that tile 3_7 is in the Wing region, at the edge of the Bridge connecting the SMC to the LMC, it is tantalizing to relate the enhanced SF of tile 3_7 with an SMC/LMC interaction.\n\nAs for tile 3_7, the comparison with stellar isochrones shows an overall good agreement. We derive a reddening E(B − V) = 0.04, which is lower than in tile 3_7. As in tile 3_7, the chosen isochrones do not bracket the whole colour distribution spread which characterizes both the MS and RGB. In particular, the observational CMD extends much further to the red than the models, hence, suggesting that a minor fraction of stars in tile 4_6 are either more reddened or more metal rich than the average of the tile. Once again, the division in sub-regions helps to disentangle the problem (see Fig. 19). Indeed, the sub-regions where the RGB is redder than models (for example, sub-region F and I) are those whose MS is globally redder, which is more consistent with a reddening effect than a metallicity difference.\n\nConcerning the MS, it is worth noticing that different sub-regions can show very different morphologies. For example, the CMD of sub-region G shows a clear turn-off consistent with a SF burst 100 or 200 Myr ago, while sub-regions like B show a much more extended MS, probably consistent with an activity extending to a few Myr ago. Interestingly, most of the regions show signs of the two events, suggesting that the SF burst in one sub-region could have triggered a burst in a neighbour sub-region, as in the scenario derived by van Dyk, Puche & Wong (1998) and Dohm-Palmer et al. (2002) for Sextans A.\n\n4.2.2 Spatial distribution\n\nFig. 20 shows how stars of different evolutionary phases are distributed over tile 4_6. Unlike tile 3_7, it is clear that 4_6 harbours many clusters and associations, probably because of the generally higher activity of the region. As in tile 3_7, the stellar density of older populations (RC and SGB, middle-left and bottom-left panels, respectively) increases smoothly towards the SMC centre (in this case, the lower-right corner of tile 4_6), while the density of younger populations (UMS and BL, top-left and top-right panels, respectively) is very irregular and dominated by inhomogeneities. Indeed, most UMS stars are found aggregated in clusters/associations (identified clusters are indicated with labels c1 to c18 in the maps in Fig. 20; Table 9 shows their literature names and properties), with the most prominent ones corresponding to NGC 346 (c15 in the map) and NGC 371 (c9).\n\nWe point out that the distribution of RC stars shows clusters as well (c10, c11, c12), but none of them turns out to have a counterpart in the UMS map. A simple explanation is that all agglomerates found in the latter are younger than 100 Myr, hence, too young to host RC stars.12 Vice-versa, clusters detected only in the RC maps are necessarily too old to have UMS stars still alive. It is also worth of notice that among clusters visible using RC stars, namely c10, c11 and c12, only c10 and c12 are seen also in the SGB map. Indeed, the c11 cluster is the well-known NGC 419 (see Table 9), which is about 1 Gyr old, hence, the transition between the MS and the RGB phase, i.e. the SGB phase, is poorly populated (Hertzsprung Gap). Note the excellent correspondence between the literature ages reported in Table 9 and the evolutionary phase adopted to detect the different c1–c18 structures.\n\nFinally, the map of reddened RC stars (middle-right panel) resembles that in tile 3_7 and suggests a very patchy reddening distribution.\n\n5 STAR CLUSTERS IN STEP\n\nAs discussed in Section 2, the study of stellar clusters in the surveyed area is an important part of the STEP survey. In the previous section, we have already discussed some of the clusters which can be readily identified in tile 4_6. The clusters (and associations) listed in Table 9 represent only part of the cluster/association content of tile 4_6. Indeed, the compilation by Bica et al. (2008) reports about 114 objects including both clusters and associations in tile 4_6 only. Clearly, most of these objects are small and a significant number of them could actually be asterisms. A detailed analysis of these objects is beyond the scope of this paper, and will be object of future works. Here, to give a flavour of the survey capabilities in such kind of studies, we present a more detailed analysis of two known clusters lying in tile 4_6, namely NGC 419 and IC 1624.\n\n5.1 Surface brightness profiles of NGC 419 and IC 1624\n\nThe number density and surface brightness profiles (SBPs) are useful tools to study the properties of star clusters in different galactic environments. These profiles contain information about the cluster's formation and evolution due to internal dynamic process and interaction with the galactic environment (see e.g. Djorgovski & Meylan 1994; Gnedin & Ostriker 1997; Binney & Merrifield 1998; Lamers et al. 2005; Mackey & van den Bergh 2005, and references therein).\n\nThe most commonly used analytical functions to describe the SBPs of star clusters are those by King (1966) and by Elson, Fall & Freeman (1987) and Elson (1999), i.e. the so-called EFF profiles (similar to the Plummer 1915 model), the latter being particularly suited for young massive clusters in the MCs (see e.g. Elson 1999; Carvalho et al. 2008, and references therein). For this reason, in the following, we will adopt the EEF profiles to fit the SBPs of NGC 419 and IC 1624.\n\nGiven the high level of crowding in the cluster cores (with the consequent large incompleteness, especially in the case of NGC 419), we decided to avoid the use of the number density profile and to concentrate on the SBP. We followed the approach devised by e.g. Hill & Zaritsky (2006) and Carvalho et al. (2008), consisting in building the profile shape to the integrated light, which does not suffer incompleteness.\n\nTo build the SBP for each cluster, we followed closely the recipe by Carvalho et al. (2008), adopting also their coordinates for the cluster's centres. Details of the procedure can be found in section 2.2 of Carvalho et al. (2008). Here, we recall that we measured the surface brightness in four sets of concentric annuli with radial steps of 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 arcsec, centred on cluster's centres. We took the mean and the standard deviation of the counts in each annulus. The background was subtracted to the counts, after evaluating it in a number of loci in the surrounding of the clusters. The counts were eventually converted to magnitudes and plotted against the radius from the cluster centre. The result of such a procedure is shown in the upper-right panel of Figs 21 and 22 for NGC 419 and IC 1624, respectively.\n\nWe adopted a weighted least-squares method to fit equation (2) to the observed SBPs. In order to obtain a better profile, we restricted the fit to a maximum radius (fitting radius) beyond which the cluster is no longer distinguishable from the background. We adopt this fitting radius in the next section as a limit to decide whether or not a star belongs to the cluster. The fitting radius is shown as a dashed line in the upper-right panel of Figs 21 and 22. In the same figures, a solid red line shows the result of the fit, while Table 10 lists the values of the relevant parameters of equation (2).\n\nThese values compare well with similar analyses present in the literature. In particular, for cluster NGC 419, our results appear to be in good agreement with those by Hill & Zaritsky (2006), Carvalho et al. (2008) and Glatt et al. (2009), taking also into account the difference in the adopted filter (g instead of V), centre coordinates (apart from Carvalho et al. 2008), spatial resolution (CCD pixel size), extension (size of the frame) and depth of the exposures used in these different investigations. As for IC 1624, the agreement with Carvalho et al. (2008) is worse (especially for μ(0)); this is perhaps due to the different statistics adopted (see section 2.2 and table 3 in Carvalho et al. 2008).\n\n5.2 The age of NGC 419 and IC 1624\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, we assumed the fitting radius to be a (rough) measure of the ‘effective’ cluster radius (i.e. we consider all stars within this radius as belonging to the cluster). The soundness of our choice is confirmed by looking at the upper-left panels of Figs 21 and 22, even if some contamination from the field is still present (see lower-panels of Fig. 22). Furthermore, the fitting radii estimated here agree very well with (half of) the major and minor axes (according to Bica et al. 2008) listed in Table 9 for the two clusters.\n\nThe CMDs of NGC 419 and IC 1624, as well as those of the surrounding fields, are shown in the lower-left and lower-right panels of Figs 21 and 22, respectively. The CMD of NGC 419 is rather scattered, due to the high crowding, which boosts dramatically photometric errors and incompleteness towards the cluster centre. Indeed, the CMD within the effective radius is almost 1 mag shallower than the CMD of the external field. On the other hand, the CMD of IC 1624 is rather loose because of the global paucity of stars in this cluster.\n\nIn terms of age, there is a clear difference between the two clusters, with IC 1624 being much younger than NGC 419 (see also Table 9). To be more quantitative, we adopted the isochrones by Marigo et al. (2008) to estimate the ages of the two clusters. The best-fitting models are shown in Figs 21 and 22 (lower-left panels) whereas the age and the other relevant parameters are listed in Table 11 (we recall here that the calibration, especially for blue colours is subject to improvement, which can affect e.g. the reddening estimate in Table 11).\n\nNGC 419 is known to host multiple stellar populations. A visual inspection of higher resolution data (HST/HRC, see fig. 42 in Glatt et al. 2008a) shows clearly a very broad MSTO, more consistent with a prolonged SF than a single burst population. Indeed, using isochrone fitting applied to MSTO stars, Glatt et al. (2008a) found an age spread between 1.2 and 1.6 Gyr. Afterwards, Girardi, Rubele & Kerber (2009) re-analysed the data modelling the CMD with synthetic populations, and concluded that only an age spread of about Δlog age≈0.15 dex allows us to reproduce the MSTO and RC morphologies simultaneously. In our data, the magnitude difference between RC and bulk of the MSTO suggests an age between 900 and 1100 Myr (see the bottom-left panel in Fig. 21), but the large photometric errors prevent any definitive conclusion about a genuine age spread. It is also worth of notice the large number of stars just above the RC, which are not seen in the external field. The presence of these object can be naturally explained in terms of blending due to the severe crowding conditions. Anyway, we cannot exclude that the innermost region of the cluster is harbouring an even younger sub-population (composed by BL stars).\n\nThe situation is completely different in IC 1624. The 170 Myr old isochrone (see Fig. 22) fits very well all the main evolutionary phases, including the MSTO (around g ∼ 18 mag), the red envelope of the BL (g − i ∼ 0.8 mag) and the average luminosity of the loop. Interestingly, the field around the cluster appears to be younger than the cluster itself. This is not surprising given the proximity of the young Nebula-Association NGC 395 (see Figs 6 and 20, and Table 9).\n\n6 SUMMARY\n\nThe STEP survey is a deep, homogeneous and uniform g, r, i, Hα survey of ∼72 deg2 across the SMC and the Bridge, as well as 2 deg2 on the Magellanic Stream. The STEP observations, based on INAF-VST GTO, started in 2011 November.\n\nThe STEP data will provide, among other things, a detailed history of SF across the SMC and the Bridge, and an inventory of variable stars along eight fields in the Bridge, outside the region investigated by the OGLE III survey.\n\nThis paper presents the STEP survey strategy, the technique adopted for the data reduction and the first results aimed at assessing their scientific quality.\n\nThe data presented here show the potential of the survey in addressing its main science goals and validate the adopted observing strategy. In particular, we analysed qualitatively two tiles, namely tiles 4_6 and 3_7, centred on the north of the SMC bar and on the Wing, respectively. The CMDs of these fields show a wealth of sub-structures and a clear separation between the various populations hosted in the galaxy. It is also clear that our photometry allows us to investigate in detail the populations producing the oldest MSTO in the galaxy, i.e. one of the main aim of this survey. These diagrams will form the base of the SFH analysis which will be the subject of future papers.\n\nTo illustrate some additional scientific applications of the STEP survey, we investigated two stellar clusters falling into the 4_6 tile, namely NGC 419 and IC 1624. We used the stellar radial density profiles to estimate their structural parameters, whereas the analysis of their CMDs allowed us to estimate their age by means of isochrone fitting.\n\nFinally, the STEP survey will be of great importance for the astronomical community because it represents the optical complement to the VMC ESO public survey (Cioni et al. 2011) which is surveying the Magellanic System in the near-infrared YJKs bands at a comparable level of sensitivity. Similarly, STEP will complement the HST observations already obtained in the optical bands, that, albeit immeasurably better for resolution and depth, are nevertheless confined to small FoVs throughout the SMC. Finally, we plan to release to the community the catalogues as well as the reduced images as soon as they are fully validated.\n\nWe wish to thank our anonymous referee for his/her competent and useful review that helped us to improve the paper.\n\nPartial support to this work was provided by the following projects: PRIN-MIUR 2010 (2010LY5N2T) ‘Chemical and Dynamical evolution of the MW and Local Group galaxies’ (PI F.
