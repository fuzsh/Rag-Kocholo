        "text": "André Clouet\n\nThe origins of the Clouet family are lost in the mists of time. Distant ancestors held the position of the king's printer for several hundred years. It took the Clouet family more than two centuries and several generations to build their collection of vineyards, the divine old masters of our home in Bouzy.\n\nAndré Clouet's descendants took over his estate, ensuring it remained in the family. The property had aged but has now been modernized and the team working to anticipate the Maison André Clouet is above all inspired by the desire to preserve the personality of its champagnes.\n\nThe bottles are exported to all five continents, but destined only to a few because production is unfortunately limited.\n\nThese fabulous vintages are haunting, from the moment they meet the eyes to the moment on the lips.\n\nAneri\n\nANERI was born from the skilful hand of Giancarlo Aneri, considered by many to be the prince of marketing. His path can be considered a university case history.\n\nTo be successful - says Aneri - you need to know where you want to go. When I started my business in the world of wine, I made a project, I chose a product, Prosecco first. Fresh and fragrant as it is, by virtue of its versatility it is an Italian wine par excellence. A product that the world envies us because it was born in a delimited area near Venice and has no equal in the world. Our company controls the production of three farms that produce prosecco grapes at the highest quality level and had the honor of accompanying the toast for the 100th anniversary of Juventus, the installation of the Presidents of the Republic Ciampi and Napolitano and of the United States President Barack Obama.\n\nFrom the forerunner prosecco, the Aneri range has expanded over time and today includes: a great red, Amarone Stella, a precious wine honored by the President of the Italian Council in 2004 to the 25 Heads of State on the occasion of the signing of the European Constitution in Rome and donated to the Eight Great Ones of the Earth during the G8 Summit in L'Aquila in 2009; the Pinot Bianco Leda, an elegant wine with harmonious aromas, produced in Alto Adige; Pinot Nero Ale, ruby red in color with intense and refined aromas, soft and delicate; Gewurztraminer Leda, a fresh and fragrant white, which has conquered even the most refined female palates.\n\nGewurztraminer Leda Aneri can be recognized with closed eyes but this does not mean that it will cease to amaze at every taste. And the last born in the Aneri house could not be missing, the Spumante Rosè di Sorbara Reny, which immediately rose to the honors of the critics: with a bright red color, it has aromas of violet and lemon and is pleasantly fresh in the mouth. But above all very persistent, like a handful of black cherries. These wines have been appreciated by Putin, Sarkozy, Bush and Cameron; they are consumed in Palazzo Chigi and the Quirinale; are in the wine lists of some of the most prestigious and trendy clubs in the world, from the Four Seasons in New York to the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, from the luxurious hotels of the Orient Express chain to the Starwood Hotels, from the five-star ones of Sir Rocco Forte, at the Palace of Saint Moritz, from the L'Anima restaurant in London, at the Cipriani in Montecarlo, the Stresa in Paris, the San Pietro in New York and the Cracco restaurant in Milan, just to name a few.\n\nThe Aneri philosophy is to produce only high quality wines, albeit in limited production, which respect the tradition of the land, the vine and the good life.\n\nIf a product is appreciated by those who produce it, it will be easy to offer it around the world. As in other sectors of Made in Italy, customers recognize the credibility of the brand and this is the best guarantee and the secret of a company's success.\n\nBortolotti\n\nHaving earned his diploma as a wine technician at the Conegliano Enological School a few years ago, in 1947 Umberto Bortolotti realized his aspirations, giving life to the Cantine in Valdobbiadene in the pioneering spirit and fervor typical of the post-war period. Seriousness and enthusiasm immediately gave him prestige and in 1954 the company was moved to its current location which, originally a factory and farm, became the subject of subsequent renovations and expansions in response to changing needs.\n\nThe evolution, inherent in the development of the productive activity, never betrayed the personal and professional ethics to refer to. And in fact seriousness, industriousness and respect will subsequently be inherited today also by his son Bruno and his nephew Daniele at the management of the cellars, today one of the historical wineries of the Valdobbiadenese area. The Cantine Umberto Bortolotti company, referring to the local wine tradition, which is accompanied by an advanced sparkling wine technique, and above all making a qualitative choice with all its suppliers operating along the hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, has been presenting its sparkling wines for over seventy years quality.\n\nSpecialized in the production of Valdobbiadene DOCG Prosecco Superiore, it has for a long time maintained a relationship of trust and ever-growing need with its suppliers, in order to protect and promote the strong territorial identity of a viticulture defined by many as \"heroic\". And the same report asks those who choose its products.\n\nCasa Divina Provvidenza\n\nEstablished in 1821, the \"Casa Divina Provvidenza\" farm, sold by the Vatican state to the Cosmi family, has returned to its former glory by focusing on tradition, on the history of a territory like Neptune and on the rediscovery of native vines, a unique heritage in Lazio for more of 2 centuries. The Cosmi have been winemakers for 3 generations, devoted to the enhancement of a wonderful fruit of the earth: grapes.\n\nThe company has chosen to give the best for its tradition by producing quality wines, with modern technologies, choosing the best machinery and specializing, thus combining ancient values and modernity, establishing a company that believes in the future and in work. Today a wing of the farmhouse is the occasional residence of the owners while the rest is dedicated to the processing of wine, up to the bottling and packaging of the product. Adjacent to the cellar there is the Company Enoteca with the tasting room, a destination for tourists and local people.\n\nCastello del Terriccio\n\nCastello del Terriccio is one of the largest agricultural properties in Tuscany: approximately 1500 hectares in total, of which 65 are destined for vineyards and 40 for olive groves, extending along the northern limit of the Tuscan Maremma near Bolgheri.\n\nThe fortunate combination of soil, air and light make this microcosm unique where nature and the intervention of man are integrated with balance, who, with foresight, has been able to safeguard the biodiversity of the territory over time, maintaining the presence of different crops and spontaneous vegetation next to the vineyards.\n\nThe estate offers views of rare beauty and charm: the vineyards alternate with forests of turkey oaks, oaks, eucalyptus trees and the Mediterranean scrub that colors and perfumes the landscape. Beyond the scrub there are still meadows, farmhouses, grassy expanses sloping down to the sea which limits the Maremma coast between Castiglioncello and Bibbona. The many streams and the lake that collects them ensure water for the flora and abundant wildlife.\n\nFrom the property you can see, on clear days, four islands of the Tuscan archipelago. At sunset, the spectacle of the fiery sun disappearing into the Tyrrhenian Sea. The ruins of the medieval castle that gives the estate its name are located on the highest hill, the one that enjoys the highest view.\n\nIn addition to vineyards and olive groves, the property includes an important Limousine cattle breeding in the wild.\n\nCastello di Rubbia\n\nObtained in the womb of the rock of a karst promontory and embellished with a stylistic canon that refers to the ancient domed vaults, our cellar is a perfect synthesis between modernity and tradition.\n\nThe living karst rock walls of the cellar tell the geology of millions of years of history with fossils and minerals.\n\nIn this place, from the grapes of our vineyard, the Castello di Rubbia wines are born: they find their identity in the slow flow of spontaneous macerations and fermentations that can last for months. In the silence of the long refinements on the yeasts they find their own identity, each with their own rhythm walks in search of stability, or balance, the first axiom for a wine that is about to embark on a new life in the bottle, without the need for filtration.\n\nThis period varies from 2 to 5 years before presentation and public availability.\n\nChampagne Castelnau\n\nLocated in the heart of Reims, the production site of the company extends for five hectares and has three levels of cellars in which the wines can develop at their best and reach their complete maturity. Castelnau is a brand specialized in long aging on yeasts. The Maison produces 600,000 bottles from 900 hectares divided between 150 different crus.\n\nCreated in honor of General Edouard de Curières de Castelnau in 1916, Champagne de Castelnau became famous during the First World War. Since 1925, and for three generations, Champagne de Castelnau has been owned by a family from Epernay.\n\nVery popular for a good part of the twentieth century, particularly in the 1930s, Champagne de Castelnau is, all over the world, the guest of honor of royal families and circles of the French army. In 1962, in Reims, a dozen winemakers combined their vineyards and their skills to create the Regional Cooperative of Champagne Wines, a cooperative that, in 2003, bought Champagne de Castelnau.\n\nToday, the cooperative has one of the largest vineyards in the Champagne region and has made Champagne de Castelnau its most representative brand.\n\nCoppo\n\nThe history of the Coppo company is inextricably intertwined with that of Piedmontese wine, in particular with the development of Canelli, homeland and capital of Italian sparkling wine, still today one of the most important Italian wine-growing poles.\n\nA story of tradition and courageous vision of the future, of sacrifice and innovation. A story that demonstrates the unconditional love of the Coppos for their places of origin, the vines that have always been cultivated in Piedmont and the long family tradition.\n\nThe origins of the company date back to 1892 and for over 120 years they followed the fortunes of the family, still the sole owner today. The ability, since its origins, to lead the own vineyards and to vinify and bottle the grapes produced under its own brand make the Coppo winery one of the oldest wineries in Italy. So much so that, in 2012, Unioncamere included the company in the national register of historic companies with more than a century of uninterrupted activity in the same product sector.\n\nCotarella\n\nThe philosophy of a company cannot be made only of words. The philosophy of a company is the backbone of all the choices that that company makes, in all its fields of action. We believe in our values and our commitment is to always act in compliance with them. Only in this way will we be able to obtain a final product that makes us truly satisfied and proud of ourselves as a company, as people, as a family.\n\nAlthough constantly evolving, the Cotarella family is founded on some immutable pillars. Love for our roots, culture as a continuous exchange, constant research, curiosity, the willingness to innovate and innovate. The passion for our work and the pleasure of listening and sharing. Without all these things we would not be who we are today nor would we be ready to face tomorrow.\n\nOur passion for viticulture and the strong sense of belonging to the territory of origin have pushed us for over thirty years to enhance our wine heritage according to a production philosophy centered on some key values.\n\nDal Maso\n\nThe history of the Dal Maso family begins at the end of the nineteenth century on the gentle hills of Montebello Vicentino in the province of Vicenza. The founder of the family was Serafino Dal Maso, the great-grandfather and founder of the company. From the end of the 1960s his father, Luigino Dal Maso, marked the great turning point, following, indeed always anticipating, the evolution of the wine market in the 1980s and 1990s. In fact, an important series of investments began, the acquisition of new properties in the most suitable areas of Gambellara, of the Berici Hills south-west of Vicenza, and already in those years he started the first exports to numerous foreign markets. Loyalty to the Venetian territories is what has always characterized the cellar: each wine speaks of the style, the Dal Maso family and the terroir of the Berici Hills, Gambellara and the Lessini Mountains. It is the earth that possesses the qualities, man just has to understand them. Dal Maso wines are the mirror of an artisan knowledge of making wine that turns into research and project, based on the careful study of the peculiarities of each vineyard.\n\nDe Buris\n\nDe Buris is not just a wine. De Buris is an enchanted place, a villa rich in history and art whose roots go back to Roman times. Villa De Buris preserves two thousand years of Valpolicella history: Here the De Buris project has found the ideal space to grow and transform.\n\nHere it is the vineyard: we are in the highest part of the La Groletta vineyard, at 250 meters above sea level, with very low yields it has always been considered a privileged area for the quality of the grapes. The best place to give birth to a dream: looking at Lake Garda but protected by the Lessini Mountains, in an ideal position, because the microclimate must be perfect.\n\nThe soil, then, is thin and fresh, the main way to reach that ideal of quality that has guided our project.\n\nA growth path started more than twenty years ago by the Tommasi family, one of the protagonists of the history of Amarone and Valpolicella and which is finally realized with the fourth generation. Everything revolves around the one hundred and ten days of drying, a Time for the grapes that will return multiplied in the glass dressed in richness, complexity and depth, after five years of aging and resting in large Slavonian oak barrels.\n\n«The 2009 season passed under the banner of good weather, a year that will remain in the memory of our territory. Ten years of constant and obsessive attention, from harvest to marketing.\n\nDenis Bovière\n\nAfter several years of vine growing, Jean Bovière decided to develop his own Champagne in 1957. He passed on his know-how and his passion to Denis Bovière who in turn passed it on to Florian Bovière who came to join us on the site. ' operating for several years now….\n\nOur vineyard is about 4 hectares 80 composed of 80% of Pinot Noir and 20% of Chardonnay. Age of vines: 35 years on average, the oldest vine of the company was planted in 1938.\n\nIn enamelled and stainless steel vats where the fermentation process takes place slowly.\n\nThe first \"alcoholic\" fermentation transforms the juices (or musts) into wines. The yeasts \"eat\" the sugar and thus produce alcohol and carbon dioxide.\n\nThe second \"malolactic\" fermentation converts malic acid into lactic acid. This fermentation takes place at the end of the alcoholic fermentation. Stabilizes and sweetens the wine by reducing its acidity. Then comes the \"filtration\" to eliminate the solid particles, the wine today is called \"limpid wines\".\n\nThen we carry out the assembly, a step that consists in mixing the wine of the different plots and the different vines to obtain a final product, balanced between fruitiness, softness and freshness. And finally the bottling where the second fermentation takes place slowly. It will give the fine bubbles, which contribute to its charm and elegance.\n\nDonnafugata\n\nDonnafugata was born in Sicily from the initiative of a family that, with passion, has been able to innovate the style and perception of Sicilian wine in the world.\n\nGiacomo Rallo, the fourth generation of a family with over 160 years of experience in quality wine, founded Donnafugata in 1983 together with his wife Gabriella, a pioneer of viticulture in Sicily.Today the sons José and Antonio lead the company and a team of people oriented to excellence.\n\nDonnafugata would not be the company it is today if Gabriella had given it another name.\n\nThe name Donnafugata refers to the novel by Tomasi di Lampedusa the Leopard. A name that means \"woman on the run\" and refers to the story of a queen who found refuge in that part of Sicily where the company's vineyards are today. A story that inspired the company logo: the image of a woman's head with hair in the wind that stands out on each bottle.\n\nA face that is also that of Gabriella Rallo, the “donnafugata” who abandons her job as a teacher to take care of the Contessa Entellina vineyards full time. One of the first women in Sicily to produce wine in a sector typically dominated by men: a pioneer of quality viticulture for women.\n\nEttore Germano\n\nFour generations of men in love with the vineyard. We are in the fourth generation of men in love with the vineyard. From the 4 hectares of property prior to the great-great-grandfather in the Cerretta area, one of the best mentions of the Barolo hills, the vineyard area has tripled, reaching today, counting as many as 10 hectares in Serralunga d'Alba and 9 in Cigliè, in Alta Langa.\n\n​Great-grandfather Francesco and grandfather Alberto mainly took care of the vineyard and the sale of grapes, the predominant trade in the area at the time, selling it to manufacturing companies but also to private individuals, and making wine only very small quantities for their own consumption and some friends.\n\nThe family grows with the joy of the birth of our two children: Elia (1998) and Maria (2001). In the following years we manage to buy another hectare in the Prapò area, one in Lazzarito, one in Pradone (appendix of the Lazzarito) and another in Cerretta. In 2010 my mother inherits from her cousin Tommaso Canale about half a hectare in the most famous historic vineyard of Serralunga la Vignarionda.\n\nFabio Mottola\n\nAfter graduating in agriculture and a five-year experience in my father-in-law Michele Satta's cellar, I began my personal adventure, driven by a great passion for wine and for the work of the artisan winemaker.\n\nMy vineyard initially consisted of a plot of almost 20 years of age, excellently located at the foot of the Castagneto Carducci hill, it is called Le Pievi, about 4 hectares of excellent land with twenty-year-old vines. Shortly thereafter I also acquired an excellent vineyard of over two hectares of white grapes, especially Vermentino, in the locality of Le Fornacelle.\n\nIn 2012 I bought what had always seemed to me an excellent vineyard: Le Gonnare. The name means \"the washerwomen\" because it is located at the foot of an ancient stream. So a soil of torrential deposits, with a lot of skeleton, facing north, deep and rich in clay. Fresh and very late as regards the ripening of the grapes.\n\nAbout 7 hectares in all. A small reality, so much so that I can personally follow every little step of cultivation and winemaking.\n\nFratelli Brunello\n\nThe Fratelli Brunello distillery, founded in 1840, is the oldest artisan distillery in Italy.\n\nIt all started with a woman, Maria Marzari, one of the first female entrepreneurs in the world of grappa.\n\nМоntegalda, 1840. This is where the history of the oldest artisan distillery in Italy begins.\n\nThe progenitor of the dynasty is Bortolo Lotto (1824-1907), a beloved and respected figure in the town of Montegalda.\n\nOn the ground floor of the Palazzone - still today the seat of the Brunello distillery - it has a “bruso” (boiler) for the production of brandy, an oil mill and a mill for sulfur.\n\nToday the Brunello Brothers need to give a signal of innovation for an artisan distillery that has been its strong point for over 180 years of its centuries-old history.\n\nIn recent years, marked by changes in tastes, consumption and in the way of drinking, it has become necessary to review not only the image of Grappa Brunello but also the product lines and give them a precise connotation in an increasingly complex market .\n\nGabe\n\nTenute Gabe is a winery located in the heart of a picturesque landscape, where winemaking tradition blends with innovation and passion for the production of high quality wines. Surrounded by rolling hills and lush vineyards, the winery is an example of excellence in the wine industry, boasting a rich history and an ongoing commitment to sustainability and respect for the environment.\n\nThe structure of the cellar is modern but respectful of traditional local architecture, with large spaces dedicated to the vinification and aging of the wines. Every stage of production, from tending the vineyards to harvesting the grapes, is carried out with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that each bottle reflects the authenticity of the territory and the skill of the winemakers.\n\nTenute Gabe wines are the result of a careful selection of grape varieties and cutting-edge winemaking techniques. Among the most popular labels, full-bodied and complex red wines, fresh and aromatic whites, and elegant sparkling wines stand out, each of which tells a story of passion, dedication and love for the land.\n\nIn addition to the production of wines, Tenute Gabe offers unforgettable wine tourism experiences, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the beauty of the area, discover the secrets of winemaking and taste the products directly in the cellar. With warm and professional hospitality, the cellar represents an ideal destination for lovers of wine and good food.\n\nGigante\n\nA few animals, small plots of land and a vineyard make up the new family business. The dream begins to take shape and in the 80s the first bottles of Gigante wines come out. Until then, in fact, the wine was sold to a tavern in the village as house wine. It is Ferruccio's young nephew, Adriano Gigante who, moved by the enthusiasm of his twenty years, decides to be daring with the first bottlings.\n\nThe label on the bottles bore the name of the Gigante family, accompanied by the image of the peacock, then as now the undisputed king of the courtyard.\n\nSince the end of the 90s Adriano has been joined by his wife Giuliana in the management and, after completing his studies, his cousin Ariedo Gigante, still the company's oenologist, brought his skills into the family business.\n\nA passion for wine that was born over time and that step by step gained strength, has increasingly tightened ties and transformed Ferruccio's dream into a reality, established nationally and internationally, of quality local wines.\n\nGrillesino\n\nLocated in the municipality of Magliano in Toscana (GR), the Grillesino was born in 1999 from the desire of Giancarlo and Saverio Notari to produce a wine being able to manage every production phase. With vineyards mostly belonging to the Morellino di Scansano DOCG area, the company now reaches an extension of 42 hectares all planted with spurred cordon with a planting density of 6000 plants per hectare. From 2000 to 2002 the Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties were planted for a total of 18 ha, which at the Grillesino are expressed with great complexity and richness of aromas.\n\nThe planted clones were selected with the collaboration of the University of Agriculture of Florence and the Institut d'Oenologie de Bordeaux; collaboration which also led to the identification of the Cabernet-Margaux clone, used for our Ceccante.\n\nIn 2004 the extension and restructuring works of the winery were completed and in the same year 17 hectares were acquired for the production of Vermentino. The property is completed by two small vineyards planted with Pinot Blanc and Viognier.\n\nThe wines are vinified with modern technologies and undergo very light filtration treatments so that typicality is one of their major characteristics.\n\nIn 2004 the extension and restructuring works of the winery were completed and in the same year 17 hectares were acquired for the production of Vermentino.

Jako Wine originates from the encounter between an oenologist of rare wisdom and an expert, tireless ambassador of wine. Passion, love, courage: these are the seeds to give life to a great family of wines. The Jako Wine project was born in 2015, from the production of a classic method sparkling wine, initially shared exclusively for friends: a few bottles tasted in company during meetings and celebrations. At that time we did not yet have the plan to sell such a precious product close to our heart. But we were already proud of all the aromas and nuances that we were able to enclose in each glass. Strengthened by our convictions and constant appreciation by users, we have decided to finally share our excellent wine. Here is the decision to sell it by opening up to the market. Without forgetting the starting point: making wines for friends and for anyone who knows how to appreciate our philosophy.\n\nKaltern Kellerei\n\nThe history of Cantina Kaltern goes back a long time. It took more than a century for our winery to become what it is and what it represents now: professionalism, passion, sense of belonging, experience and the highest quality standards.\n\nToday, Cantina Kaltern is one of the most important wineries in South Tyrol, and the wine-growing municipality of Caldaro, the best known and most loved in South Tyrol, is proud of its fame. But Caldaro is not a special place only for wine lovers and connoisseurs. Wine is the great protagonist of the life of the community: it has forged it over the years, it has given and gives work, it fills the inhabitants and farmers with pride and is for many a full-time professional commitment, pursued with great passion by many. different areas, whether in the vineyards, in the cellar, in the gastronomy or in the trade.\n\nIn Caldaro, wine is synonymous with taste and quality. What makes our small wine-growing community with its large natural and bathing lake and its wines truly unique is the community that surrounds it. Spreading the spirit, the euphoria, the common commitment, the wine and, of course, the natural beauties all over the world. Cantina Kaltern plays an important role in this sense that perfectly reflects the company philosophy: union of intentions and constant search for quality.\n\nLe Macchiole\n\nFounded in the early eighties, Le Macchiole is one of the historic realities of Bolgheri, which over time has become the absolute reference for quality Tuscan wine. The project is realized thanks to Eugenio Campolmi and Cinzia Merli, among the pioneers of the area, through the original vision of a suitable territory still at the dawn of its stylistic definition. It was precisely their action, both in the vineyard and in the cellar, with the creation of wines that have become symbols for their caliber and personality, that contributed to the fame of Bolgheri.\n\nToday it is Cinzia who leads the company, with the decisive contribution of her sons Elia and Mattia, now protagonists of the company, as well as an increasingly cohesive and close-knit team of collaborators. An extended family that never ceases to innovate, surprising and surprising itself, in the wake of history. Changing to remain itself, Le Macchiole shows a constantly evolving physiognomy thanks to a contemporary reading of the wine and its terroir.\n\nThe convinced choice of organic farming and an increasingly sustainable approach, the ever more precise definition of a style that favors finesse and elegance, as well as authenticity and personality, sculpt the face of a historic but not static winery, an aware protagonist of its time.\n\nLe Ragnaie\n\nThe Le Ragnaie farm covers an area of 28 hectares in the municipality of Montalcino, in the province of Siena. Our lands are cultivated with vineyards and olive groves, following the dictates of organic farming *, and are located in three distinct areas of the Montalcino area, allowing us to make wine from three different terroirs. Our cellar is located in the Ragnaie business center, in essential and rational environments that allow us to work in maximum safety and cleanliness.\n\nAfter the harvest the grapes are selected on a vibrant sorting table where the best bunches are chosen, allowing us to vinify only quality grapes. The musts are fermented and macerated in concrete vats where, with the help of manual pumping over, they remain from 25 to 90 days. After pressing, the wines rest in our barrel cellar in large Slavonian oak barrels\n\nThe period of stay in oak varies from 12 months for the IGT Troncone, 24 months for the Rosso di Montalcino and 36 months for the Brunellis.\n\nAfter bottling, the wines rest in a controlled temperature and humidity environment until they are put on the market.\n\nLuppolajo\n\nWe produce all the beers of our three lines, both low and high fermentation, with a manual system with two 12hl double-cooked vats. In this way we can personally control every phase of the production process and give a personal cut to each of our beers. Each step is followed directly by our brewers in a complex alchemy between the beer theory applied in the conception of the recipes and the manual work that is carried out daily in the brewhouse.\n\nOur 130hl cellar allows us to produce more than 1000hl per year. Our fermenters, of different sizes and characteristics, have been chosen to enhance the individual beer styles and allow us to adopt different production techniques based on the type of beer to be produced each time.\n\nOur beers, packaged manually, are all refermented in kegs or bottles at the end of a maturation period that varies from three to six weeks. Once the refermentation is complete, the beers are ready to be labeled and stored in a cold room at 4 degrees.\n\nMarcazzan Fabio\n\nThe Marcazzan Fabio winery is located in San Giovanni Ilarione, a small village in the foothills east of Verona. Descended from generations of winemakers, Marcazzan Fabio, in 2016, at the age of 24, decided that the time had come to realize his dream. Thus he began to make wine; starting from a certainty, which has become the philosophy of the winery itself: excellent wine is produced from excellent grapes and from excellent processing and care of the bunch, when the latter is still in the vineyard.\n\nStarting from these basic principles, the Marcazzan Fabio winery stands out for its method and raw materials, for the right combination of \"Mother Earth\" and for the vineyards that are more than 50 years old. This type of production involves a lower yield but a considerable increase in the quality of the bunch. Our vineyards have their roots in a volcanic-basaltic land, this is the characteristic that gives our products a scent and aroma rich in tradition and history.\n\nThrough our products we want you to savor the experience that has been lovingly passed down from generation to generation. “I work and believe a lot in what I do, in the products and quality that I propose; This is why I am looking for people who believe, appreciate and value this philosophy of mine and who support me in realizing this dream\"\n\nMerotto\n\nIn the genealogical memory of the family we can date the beginning of agricultural history with Agostino Merotto, an ancestor who was already known in the area for the quality of his Prosecco at the beginning of the 20th century. Crossing and overcoming the period of the two great wars of the last century, naturally poor in oenological references, we arrive at the years of the rebirth and rediscovery of crops and peasant commitment towards the suitable areas of the different territories.\n\n1972 therefore marks the beginning of the entrepreneurial history of Graziano Merotto who immediately demonstrates a vocation and a precise attitude towards the world of sparkling wines, concentrating sacrifices and experiments in search of a level of excellence that was recognizable and able to leave a qualitative trace destined to remain in the history of the area to which it belongs.\n\nThis path, almost fifty years long now, has been completed according to a reasoned progression, in a balanced balance between the advent of technologies and the work of the land practiced in a sustainable way in order to preserve its integrity and value. An articulated road requires good travel companions and the team of human resources involved in the production chain, from the countryside to the Collaborators who work in the most distant countries of the globe, represents, according to the philosophy of Graziano Merotto, the true corporate heritage, without which nothing would be possible and the transformation of grapes into wine would remain an end in itself.\n\nMontevetrano\n\na friendship of the mid-80s between a group of wine lovers with the desire to experiment. It was 1983 and among them were Silvia Imparato and Riccardo Cotarella. 6 years after the first bottles of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Aglianico, the first vintage of a wine that will have the same name as the castle: Montevetrano.\n\nAn extraordinary success, which continues today. After 20 years, to celebrate the first vintage of Montevetrano, Core is born, a new 100% Aglianico red wine which in 2015 is joined by Core Bianco, a blend of Fiano and Greco.\n\nToday Montevetrano is an estate of 26 hectares, of which about 5 are vineyards, in the Regional Park of the Picentini Mountains, in Southern Italy. The vineyards are in San Cipriano Picentino, in an ancient property of the Bourbons 100 meters above sea level, on the crest of a hill among oaks, chestnuts, hazelnuts, citrus and olive trees, in the shade of an ancient medieval castle.\n\nThe borders are marked by bushes of blackberries and ancient roses that lead to the rows in the space of the \"vineyard of the horse\", at the height of the manor house of the end of the 1700s.\n\nNardini Distillerie\n\nThe first distillery in Italy. Let yourself be surprised by the bicentennial history of a family whose name, through centuries and generations, has become synonymous with a product, an icon of an entire nation.\n\nSon of Bortolo Nardini and Maria Maddalena Giacomuzzi, Bortolo Nardini was born on 25 May 1739 in Segonzano (Tn) in the Cembra Valley. In the country with an ancient winemaking tradition, it was a widespread practice to distil the pomace to obtain a source of income and sustenance. At the time the distillers moved from house to house, with a mobile still, to distil the pomace deriving from the production of wine \"for third parties\" and Bortolo Nardini, having undertaken this \"job\", went as far as Bassano del Grappa.\n\nPushed as far as Bassano del Grappa, Bortolo Nardini was the victim of an accident that forced him to stop in the city. During his convalescence, he had the opportunity to get to know Bassano better and to understand its strategic importance as a commercial crossroads between Valsugana and Venice. With a precise vision and the tenacious will to turn it into reality, he bought the Osteria al Ponte, today “Grapperia Nardini”, to produce grappa with a still on a permanent plant and resell it.\n\nFor the first time it was no longer the distiller, with his mobile still, who went to the farmers to distill but the farmers themselves gave him the pomace for the production of grappa. Bortolo calls his grappa \"Aquavite di marc\", in the Latin way without the \"c\", playing on the etymology that sometimes wants it to be \"aqua of life\" other \"aqua of the vine\". The first grappa of Italy is born, Grappa Nardini.\n\nThe new generation of Nardini: Bortolo, Orazio, Mario, brings an important innovation: the reserve grappa, “Aged in oak barrels like cognac”. Grappa Nardini Riserva is born.\n\nNatalina Grandi\n\nFive generations, a single territory. Tenuta Natalina Grandi tells the story of the passion carried on from father to son. The production takes place entirely in the ten hectares of land owned, divided between Gambellara and Lonigo, between hills and plains. The totally pure grapes are processed with an organic supply chain, which results in a natural, fine flavor that recalls the origins of the earth.\n\nThe vines of Tenuta Natalina Grandi have their roots in a soil of volcanic origin, this gives the wines a recognizable flavor starting from their interpretation in dry wines up to the sweet type.\n\nIn the hills, in Monte di Mezzo, grape yields are lower, this allows the production of more structured wines such as Recioto and Gambellara Classico.\n\nIn the plain, on the other hand, called the locality of Giaroni, wines with greater freshness are produced, such as Prosecco, Solo Lei and Ricordo.\n\nSince 2016 Tenuta Natalina Grandi has chosen to follow the guidelines to obtain organic certification to regularize and highlight a conduct that the company has already chosen for years. In cultivation no pesticides are used, herbicides treatments are limited to a minimum, while the mulching and fertilization of the soil takes place with green manure, the mixture of herbs and flowers that becomes fertilizer.\n\nThe company's sustainability is also expressed during the harvest, which still takes place manually.\n\nThe grapes, harvested in a natural way, transfer an ancient flavor to the wine, leaving narrative aromas between the lips.\n\nNoelia Ricci\n\nNoelia Ricci is a project born in 2010 within the Pandolfa Estate, an estate rich in history that extends for 140 hectares in Predappio, at the foot of the Tuscan-Romagnolo Appenino. The name Pandolfa seems to derive directly from Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, known as the “Lupo di Rimini”, who would have stationed in these places for a long time before setting out to sack the Castle of Fiumana in 1436.\n\nFrom 1626 to 1941 the owners of the estate were the Marquis Albicini.\n\nIn 1941 the property passed to Commendator Giuseppe Ricci, an entrepreneur from Forlì. In the years of the Second World War, the history of Pandolfa changed its sign.\n\nFrom a pleasant place for the holidays of the marquises, it found itself at the center of the tragic events of the war. It was occupied by the Germans and then attacked by Polish troops, while many displaced people found refuge in its cellars. Once peace returned, in the 1950s, Giuseppe Ricci began the renovation of the estate, involving well-known local artists, who here created works of art up to the legacy of these places.\n\nRicci also began to rethink agricultural production, which had been of great importance during the Albicini period, bought two adjacent farms and planted Sangiovese, Trebbiano and Albana vines.\n\nPatrì\n\nCantine Patrì has solid roots, a tenacious history that was born in the territory of Butera since 1936 when Rocco Paterna gave life to the farm, it was then the son-in-law Giuseppe Patrì who took the reins with foresight and resolve.\n\nAnd with the same determination, years later, his son Rocco, his wife Patrizia and their children Giuseppe, Elisa and Daniela, decided to enhance the extraordinary viticultural heritage of Butera, allocating one third of the two hundred and fifty hectares owned to the production of wines.\n\nToday the company is the pride and ambassador in the world with its labels, of the expressive vivacity of the DOC Riesi, the DOC Sicilia and the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG.\n\nThe reason that prompted the Patrì family to make wine is to be found in the vocation of the lands and grapes which, combined with the skilful hand of man, is today able to arouse suggestions that only Sicily can offer, and interpret the needs of consumers oriented towards quality red and white wines, elegant, well structured and Mediterranean.\n\nPhraya\n\nPhraya, east. 2011. To be honest, the story originates much earlier; It was 1977 when the Sangsom Distillery was founded, today considered among the oldest in Thailand. With the launch of Phraya the distillery, known for the production of quality Thai rum, decides to put its skills to the test, with an innovative impetus. Produced in the province of Nakhon Pathom, the first and oldest national city, this rum brings with it virtuous characteristics, starting from the choice of name; “Phraya”, in fact, is a Thai word used in the past to indicate one of the highest degrees that could be conferred on someone by the king, indicating his exceptional ability. The symbolism behind Phraya is also virtuous: earth, water, fire, air. The cosmogony concerning the connection between human microcosm and natural macrocosm, for which the life of the human species and the survival of the cosmos depends on the balance between the elements, served as the inspiring muse for the creation of Phraya. With the aim of producing a blend with superior taste and experiential sensations, in Phraya each of the four elements plays a fundamental role, contributing to the uniqueness of this rum.\n\nPiccoli\n\nThe Piccoli Agricultural Company has a history of vines and vines that have been intertwined for more than fifty years in a courageous journey in search of continuous improvement.\n\nThe story of a family with solid and authentic values, cultivated and handed down with love, generation after generation.\n\nThe land and the vineyard have been part of Piccoli since the time of their grandmother, thanks to our parents Daniela and Tiziano, their dedication and their sacrifice it was possible to create an ambitious project. A family cellar, in which every element is studied in detail.\n\nA new chapter opens with us, Veronica and Alice, two sisters who with love and passion wish to carry on this challenge, so different but at the same time so complementary.\n\nTogether we have learned what it means to play as a team, together we are family and added value.\n\nPodere Marini\n\nThe central value of this family business is represented by the deep respect with which it wants to relate to the land, the people and the territory in which it operates. A territory in which and with which the Marini company has been measuring and evolving for the past 300 years!\n\nThe original nucleus was built for the cultivation of olive trees and the production of oil and still today, of the total area of about 300 hectares, 130 are olive-growing. Subsequently 35 hectares were destined for the production of Clementine di Calabria, a leading product of regional agriculture, protected by the Community IGP trademark.\n\nIn 2003 the Marini family enriched the offer again by focusing on quality viticulture. 7 hectares of vineyards were planted in hilly, clayey soils, at about 500 m asl, and the new cellar was built. With this activity, the Poderi Marini company returns to discover, interpreting it in a modern key, a tradition that has been present in this area since ancient times.\n\nThe assortment of vines includes the indigenous Aglianico and Magliocco and the international Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, for the reds, and Chardonnay and Sauvignon for the whites. The training system adopted in all the vineyards is the spurred cordon, the density of the vines is 5,200 vines / ha with productions never exceeding 60 q / ha.\n\nThe cellar is new and equipped with modern oenological systems. Finally, in the vineyard and in the cellar, the production method of organic farming is adopted. All choices that testify to the constant orientation of the Marines to cutting-edge technologies, to quality productions with deep respect for tradition and the environment. In the cellar the company avails itself of the over twenty-year expertise of the oenologist Gianfranco Cordero. Consistent with the production orientation of the company, the techniques adopted aim to ensure the lowest impact on the fruit from the harvest, strictly in boxes, to the pressing and in all subsequent stages of wine production.\n\nRon Millonario\n\nIn 1904, in the north of Peru, the Hacienda Agrícola de Chiclayo was founded in Chiclayo, a small settlement between the sea and the mountains known as the \"city of friendship\". Here, a group of farmers joined together to trade their own sugar, and to this end they built, with great personal sacrifice, a small refinery.\n\nIn 1922, the Peruvian landowner family Piera de Castillo, whose boss was Don Rolando, bought the hacienda, the refinery and the vast sugar cane plantation from the Gutiérrez family. While there was a lot of raw material, the technology was elementary. The lack of technical knowledge meant that sugar cane and all its potential could not be fully exploited. The workforce, coming from the local inhabitants around the hacienda, was also poorly trained.\n\nIn 1933 Don Rolando sent his eldest son Augusto to study chemical engineering at the University of Cambridge. In the summer of 1938 a ship destined for Peru left London, carrying the precious cylinder mill for sugar and a Scottish column still for distillation.\n\n1950 was an unforgettable year for the young Augusto Piera de Castillo: Ron Millonario was officially born.\n\nThe rum was the fruit of hard work, but since few could afford to taste it, it acquired the name \"por los millionarios\", in recognition of that exclusive club of individuals wealthy enough to buy its spirit and enjoy its unique charm.\n\nIn search of new products, Fabio Rossi landed in Peru in 2004 and discovered a warm, rich and pleasant to drink product. He had stumbled upon a real treasure from Peru. The continuous trust of the Rossi brothers in the products has begun to bear fruit. Increasingly appreciated by experts from all over the world, Millonario can be counted among the best.\n\nRon Santiago de Cuba\n\nFor over 8 generations the Masters of Cuban Ron from the city of Santiago de Cuba have followed their tradition and experience rather than a recipe, creating a rum with rhythm and soul that dances in the glass, always dreaming of something better.\n\nThe Oriente region has been known as the Cradle of Rum Light since 1862 and Santiago de Cuba is the city where the tradition of Cuban Ron Ligero found its origins. Here, the scorching heat of the Caribbean sun, the humidity of the land and the sea intertwine perfectly to create the optimal conditions for growing sugar cane, enriching the aging process and giving depth to our unique liquid.\n\nRum is the soul of Cuba and what makes it unique can be broken down into three elements: the raw materials, the aging and blending method and the expertise of the Masters of Cuban Ron.\n\nScala\n\nHistoric company, farmers since the seventeenth century, has dedicated a lot of effort to the cultivation of vineyards and has always produced selected and refined \"Cirò wines\" since 1949.\n\nThe culture of refinement has been handed down from father to son and currently Luigi Scala, a winegrower in the cellar of all time, continues the production of Cirò with great reference to family traditions. From the cultivation of the vine to the processing and aging of the wine, the Scala company carefully takes care of the phases of its product which aims not so much at the quantity, but above all at the excellent quality of a Calabrese wine that wants to stand out.\n\nThe continuity and philosophy of all time is also ensured by the entry into the company of Francesco Scala, currently in charge of commercial relations.\n\nSt. Michael - Eppan\n\nThe grape metamorphosis takes place in the cellar. A combination of ancient and innovative winemaking techniques. The \"respect for the fruit\" is the most important rule for the production of long-lived wines with great personality.\n\nThe grapes are rigorously vinified for peculiarities in order to enhance each single vineyard.\n\nThe wines are then aged in steel or wooden barrels to emphasize the individual characteristics.\n\nSince the Eighties, the space of the white and red barriques has conquered the heart of the winery. In them the selections of the most precious and prized wines mature in small French oak barrels. This refinement requires great sensitivity and gives life to complex wines, which embody a perfect symbiosis between fruit and nuances that wood can enhance.\n\nIn the Cantina San Michele Appiano the traditional aging of wines in large wooden barrels still plays an important role today. For this reason, in recent years the historic cellar has been completely renovated with over 50 large oak barrels. The four ancient 150 hl barrels stand out immediately, graceful with ancient carvings, depicting historical events starting from 1907.\n\nSteel is indispensable for modern winemaking. In fact, it represents the ideal material for both fermentation vats and storage tanks, guaranteeing hygiene and cleanliness.\n\nThe steel allows a clear transformation of musts and wines, and is able to enhance the freshness and aromas of the different varieties.\n\nTamburino Sardo\n\nThe Azienda Agricola Tamburino Sardo, founded in 1968 by Adriano Fasoli is now managed together with his two sons Stefano and Giuliano. It is located on the hills of Custoza, at the highest point, known as the Tamburino Sardo hill. The name derives from a page in the history of Italian Independence of 1848-1866 mentioned by De Amicis in his book “Cuore”. For 50 years the Fasoli family has been producing quality and local wines ranging from Custoza to Bardolino and thanks to a joint venture of love, also Valpolicella Superiore, Ripasso and Amarone.\n\nThe founder of the company, Adriano has been working in the vineyard since he was a boy as was the custom in the past. He passed on his passion, his seriousness and above all his technical skills in the vineyard and in the cellar to his children and is still at their side in the management of this big-hearted company.\n\nTenuta Sallier de la Tour\n\nOur history and that of “Muntagna” met in 2007, when the Tascante project - Pocket and Etna - was born, which is above all the exact synthesis of our idea of a vineyard on the highest volcano in Europe, Etna. A force of nature in its primordial state. Today with great pride I present to you the new born: the wines of the district. A research and study project of the territory that began with the first experimental vinification in 2004. An intense work that then took shape with the purchase of the first vineyards in 2007 in Contrada Sciaranuova and Pianodario, and subsequently in Contrada Rampante, in 2015. Knowing the character of a land, understanding its nuances, identifying its strengths and any more problematic aspects, is not an easy and immediate achievement. You can get an idea right away, but it takes time to understand the details. And the details make the difference. The Nerello Mascalese and the volcanic soils of Etna interact in an almost magical way, expressing the strength of the territory in a distinctive and unmistakable way.\n\nTenuta Ulisse\n\nThe heirs of tradition and the interpreters of new technologies collaborate in the company. There is passion, that of Antonio and Luigi Ulisse brothers and founders of the project, there is meticulousness and planning: in two words the Ulisse style. The production structure of the Tenuta Ulisse cellar is state-of-the-art: the vinification area is equipped with the latest generation technologies and the modern bottling line guarantees the utmost care in the packaging of the products.\n\nSmall tanks to keep the different types of product separate according to the characteristics of each individual vineyard (altitude, exposure, soil type, clone, training system, grape harvest period, etc.) to enhance the characteristics of the typical vines of our territory.\n\nPerfectly healthy grapes must arrive in the cellar, organoleptically complete, harvested at the right degree of ripeness. Respecting its naturalness, enhancing its oenological value, enhancing the varietal peculiarities of each vine is for Tenuta Ulisse, from the very beginning, an iron rule on which Antonio and Luigi Ulisse, harvest after harvest, manage to form a new model of winemaking enterprise, rooted in the territory but with an eye to the most demanding and prepared markets.\n\nTorquadra\n\nQuality, innovation, research, professionalism and love for our work are our hallmark.\n\nTorquadra products are distinguished by their difference in taste and aroma, presenting finesse and personality as the common denominator of excellent products, obtained with pomace from classic and native Trentino vines.\n\nThe complex process of distillation of the pomace follows the discontinuous \"bain-marie\" and steam method: the all-Trentino method which, thanks to the water vapor, allows to obtain a better regulation of the cooking temperature, and therefore to obtain a finer product. It is a type of distillation that favors quality.\n\nIf our grappa is so precious it is due to the use of high quality fresh pomace and to this type of\n\ndistillation which heats them slowly and evenly.\n\nOur barricaded Grappas, the strong point of our production, are left to age for several years in small French oak, cherry or acacia barriques.\n\nThus in full harmony the grappa slowly extracts a natural color and a full and elegant character from the wood.\n\nAll the barricaded grappas have achieved important awards in international competitions\n\nTramin Kellerei\n\nCantina Tramin, the home of theGewürztraminer , was born in 1898 from a small project with a few families started by ChristianSchrott , parish priest of Termeno and deputyto the Austrian Parliament, to guarantee subsistence and a future for mountain winemakers. Thanks to the strength of this union , Cantina Tramin over time it has become one of the most successful cooperatives in the region and a recognized example in the world.\n\nIn 1971 Cantina Tramin merged with the historic Cantina Sociale di Egna, founded in 1893. A union that associates the heritage of traditions and vineyards in a single cooperative reality, including the prestigious lands in Mazzon and Glen dedicated to Pinot Noir. the arrival in the company of our oenologist Willi Stürz, in the 90s the inversion of the trend towards quality is consolidated and the project of the wines of the Selezione begins, which today includes Nussbaumer, Terminum, Unterebner, Stoan, Freisinger, Maglen , Urban and Loam: the maximum expression of our oenological savoir-faire and the result of a selection of our finest vineyards. From here on, all production will be oriented towards excellence. In 2010 the refurbishment of our headquarters was completed, a project curated by the architect Werner Tscholl, a structure-sculpture that becomes an icon and symbol of Termeno.\n\nThe latest addition to the Tramin house is Troy, an elegant high mountain Chardonnay, with which we are going to enrich this world-renowned variety with a unique alpine interpretation.\n\nToday we produce an average of 1.9 million bottles per year, 70% destined for the national market, and the remaining 30% for the foreign market. Working together to create wines that are a harmonious expression of our environment is the guiding principle of Cantina Tramin.\n\nUgo Bing\n\nThe personality of the wines and the intense taste of the oil have one thing in common: the faithful imprint of the land where they are born. Il Fiano, an ancient village near Certaldo, has been owned by the Bing family since 1940. These lands, unique in terms of exposure and geological origin, are naturally suited to high quality productions.\n\nThe lands are exposed to a fan from east to west, for over 65 hectares, and oriented to the south at the Poggio ai Monti vineyard, located at 330 meters above sea level. Another 14 hectares of vineyards are located in Novoli, about 1 km further north-east, in the Vergignolo valley.\n\nThe formations that originated the substrates can be traced back to three lithological types: the \"tufo\", the \"mattaione\" and pebbles mixed with coarse sand. Near Novoli, the soils are of clayey, loamy-clay substrate, while the 65 hectares of Fiano are of medium texture, tending towards clayey and accompanied by the presence of skeleton, in the form of pebbles.\n\nVal di Suga\n\nTenimenti Angelini, owned by the Angelini family and part of the group of the same name, was founded in November 1994 with the acquisition of three historic wineries in Tuscany: the Azienda Agricola Val di Suga in Montalcino, the Tenuta Trerose in Montepulciano and the Fattoria San Leonino in Castellina in Chianti.\n\nThree appellations of great prestige and tradition for one of the companies that have focused more on the production of quality wines, but capable of being faithful witnesses of their respective territories.Val di Suga is the estate where the wines of the most prestigious appellation are born: Brunello of Montalcino.\n\nA property that extends for over one hundred hectares and which is characterized by a unique element: the vineyards that surround the cellar are arranged on three different sides. The possibility therefore of using the grapes from the three areas, very different from each other in terms of soil and exposure, allows Val di Suga to offer harmonious and well-balanced wines, where all the best characteristics of this magical territory known in Worldwide.\n\nValter Sirk\n\nThe Collio Goriziano is a hilly region in the extreme west of Slovenia located near the border with Italy.\n\nBut it is from 1991 that the production began on its own with the creation of the Valter Sirk winery, After a period of development within the Slovenian borders, now the production has been directed towards new markets both internal and external to Europe.\n\nAmong the picturesque villages of this region there is also Višnjevik, The village is mentioned for the first time in the thirteenth century along with the history of the Rittersberg Castle.\n\nAmong the picturesque villages of this region there is also Višnjevik, The village is mentioned for the first time in the thirteenth century along with the history of the Rittersberg Castle. Since the seventeenth century, Collio has been known as an appropriate region for growing wine and fruit. So the roots of the Višnjevik wine industry date back to the Middle Ages. The nice village of Višnjevik is situated on the top of the 320 meter high hill above the valley of the Reka stream.\n\nVelenosi\n\nThe Velenosi winery was founded in 1984 by two very young entrepreneurs, Angela and Ercole Velenosi. Then with the experience of Doctor Paolo Garbini, Velenosi Srl was established in 2005. Over 35 years of experience in the sector and a strong passion have allowed the creation of this reality where, through the use of cutting-edge equipment, the outstanding wine.\n\nThe heart of the company is located in the historic city of Ascoli Piceno, which is located in the Marche region at a distance of about 20 km from the Adriatic Sea and at an altitude of 150/200 masl. The farms of the company extend among the hills that surround the splendid valley of the Tronto river, which, thanks to its clayey and fertile soils, has always been suited to the cultivation of vines.\n\nIn addition to the four companies located in Ascoli Piceno, Castorano, Monsampolo del Tronto and Castel di Lama, there is a vineyard in the Ancarano area (TE) and in the San Marcello area (AN), between the Castelli di Jesi."
