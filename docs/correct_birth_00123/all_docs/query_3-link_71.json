He won the NBA's Most Valuable Player award five times, and six times led the Chicago Bulls to the league championship. A 6'6\" guard with a superb shot, stout defensive skills and a killer competitive instinct, Michael Jordan led the Bulls to his first three championships came in 1991, 1992 and 1993. But in October of 1993 he stunned his fans by retiring from basketball and beginning a professional baseball career, saying that playing baseball had been an early dream of his. Jordan played the 1994 baseball season for the minor league Birmingham Barons. In March of 1995 he ended his baseball career and returned to the Bulls. With Jordan back, the Bulls won three more championships in 1996, 1997 and 1998. He retired from basketball in 1999. In the year 2000 he became a part owner and executive for the NBA's Washington Wizards. In 2001 Jordan began considering another comeback as an NBA player, and that fall, at age 38, he returned once again to play for the Wizards. He played for two more full seasons, retiring for the third and final time in April of 2003, and later becoming a part owner of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats -- first (in 2006) a minority owner, and then majority owner in 2010. For all his playing skills, Jordan may be better known for his long promotional collaboration with the sportswear brand Nike. His signature shoe, the Air Jordan, is perhaps the most iconic athletic footwear brand in America. Michael Jordan was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nExtra Credit:\n\nMichael Jordan wore uniform number 23… His endorsement deal with Nike led to the creation of Air Jordans, the popular athletic shoe… Michael Jordan married the former Juanita Vanoy in 1989.

Jordan paid a reported $168 million to Juanita in the settlement… Michael Jordan married the Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto on April 27, 2013. They have two children, twins Ysabel and Victoria, born in 2014… Michael Jordan starred with Bugs Bunny in the 1996 feature film Space Jam.\n\n4 Good Links\n\nNBA.com has a nifty overview of his career\n\nA fun look back on his brief time with baseball's Birmingham Barons\n\nWikipedia has a mammoth list of dates, stats and more\n\nFrom YouTube, grainy footage of some amazing buckets\n\nTrending\n\nHere are the facts and trivia that people are buzzing about."
