        "text": "Michael Jordan is undoubtedly one of the most talented, the most successful and the most popular basketball player of all times. Known as His Airness, Jordan was one of those players who could truly mesmerize with his basketball skills and divine talent. He was born on Feb. 17th, 1963 and spent his childhood in North Carolina. His father was an avid baseball fan, thus Michael was in love with basketball since his early years. His childhood dream was playing for the NC university team, and he promised himself to make his dream come true no matter what. He had difficulties with starting his basketball career since in his teenage years he was only 5.9 feet tall, but after just one summer full of training and spending time in the gym he managed to grow up to 6.4 feet of height. He joined NC University team and just 3 years later he was invited to Chicago Bull's camp. With this team, he became one of the best defenders known with his unique abilities to “fly” and perform his brand-name slam dunks. He also has a large number of MVP awards in various tournaments and competitions. He led his team to the Champion title in 1991, 1992 and 1993, but then he suddenly announced his decision to quit basketball and become a professional baseball player. The idea failed, and in 1995 he appeared on the court of Chicago again. That resulted in bringing three consequent Champion titles to the team. He planned to finish his career in Chicago Bulls, but after the events of 09/11/02, he played for a short time in Washington Wizards in order to give his earnings to the families of the tragedy victims. MJ is a big fan of golf, motorcycles, and charity. He is one of the owners of Charlotte Hornets basketball team. He is married for the second time and has 5 children in his two marriages."
