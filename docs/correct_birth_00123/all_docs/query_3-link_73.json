        "text": "Do you know Michael Jordan? This basketball player is really famous because of many reasons. He has helped impact society like the other people in the world today. I chose this person, to research, because I was born in Los Angeles, California. I liked Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan is the closest to him I can get. One Jordans quotes is,”There is no such thing as a perfect basketball player, and I don't believe there is only one greatest player either. Everyone plays in different eras. I built my talents on the shoulders of someone else's talent. I believe greatness is an evolutionary process that changes and evolves era to era. Without Julius Erving, David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Elgin Baylor there would never have been a Michael Jordan. …show more content…\n\nOne thing he was viewed as a superstar. In the “NBA Encyclopedia Playoff Edition” it states,”Even contemporaneous superstars recognized the unparalleled position of Jordan. Magic Johnson said, ‘There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.’ Larry Bird, following a playoff game where Jordan dropped 63 points on the Boston Celtics in just his second season, appraisal of the young player was: ‘God disguised as Michael Jordan’” (www.nba.com/history/players /jordan_bio.html). This explains that Michael Jordan was a really good player and a lot of people look up to him. Another thing he was known as the best player. Ethan Sherwood Strauss wrote,”At age 50, Michael Jordan is remembered as basketball's greatest player ever. “ This shows how good he really is and see him as the best. Other than the best, he was also known as a man who could fly. Ethan S. Strauss also wrote,”Jordan will be remembered as the man who could fly, but dunking was not his signature. No, MJ was a layup artist of the highest order, someone who could turn hang time into dazzling 360-degree floaters through traffic.” This evidence helps show how he played the game. He didn’t dunk a lot. This made him to be a layup artist. Finally, he was also known as many other things. In “Michael Jordan Biography” it says,”Professional basketball player, Olympic athlete, businessperson, actor”(Biography.com Editors). This shows that Michael Jordan has done more things than just play basketball. He was an actor and many other things. These are some examples of what people view Michael Jordan"
