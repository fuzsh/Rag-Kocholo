        "text": "Chicago Bulls\n\nJordan was the third player chosen overall in the 1984 NBA draft, selected by the Chicago Bulls. The 6-foot 6-inch (1.98-meter) guard quickly demonstrated the wisdom of their choice. In his first season he averaged 28.2 points per game and was named the NBA’s rookie of the year. Wilt Chamberlain was the only other player to score 3,000 points in a season before Jordan did it in the 1986–87 season. Jordan won seven consecutive scoring titles from the 1986–87 season through the 1992–93 season. He led the Bulls to three consecutive NBA championships, in 1991, 1992, and 1993. He also led the U.S. basketball team to a gold medal in both the 1984 and 1992 Olympic Games.\n\nSaying that he did not have “anything else to prove,” Jordan retired from professional basketball in October 1993. In 1994 he signed on to play for a minor league baseball team, but after one season he decided to return to basketball. He rejoined the Bulls late in their 1994–95 season. After leading the team to three more back-to-back championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nIn January 2000 Jordan bought a share of the Washington Wizards and also became the team’s president of basketball operations. But he soon wanted to return to the court. He gave up his ownership and management positions with the Wizards in September 2001 in order to play on the team. In the 2002–03 season he became the first player in NBA history age 40 years or older to score more than 40 points in a game. Jordan’s final retirement from basketball came in May 2003.\n\nCareer Statistics and Honors\n\nJordan was named the NBA’s most valuable player (MVP) in 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1998. He was also the MVP of the finals for each of his six championship seasons with the Bulls. At the time of his retirement in 2003, Jordan ranked third in career scoring, with a total of 32,292 points, behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. Jordan’s scoring average of 30.12 points per game was the highest in league history. Jordan became part owner of the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats in 2006 and took over control of the team as its majority owner in 2010; he was the first former NBA player to become a majority owner of one of the league’s teams. Jordan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in September 2009. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016."
