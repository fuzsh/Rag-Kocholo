        "text": "Michael Jordan's Biography\n\nMichael Jordan is considered by most analysts and sports historians to be the greatest basketball player of all time, and for good reason. He played a total of fifteen seasons in the NBA, primarily for the Chicago Bulls (though he came out of retirement in 2001 to play for the Washington Wizards), led his team to six championships, and holds a truly astonishing number of league records.\n\nJordan’s international fame helped to popularize the NBA as a whole in the ‘80s and ‘90s, and his legacy and brand are still strong to this day. He’s a multi-talented guy, and briefly retired from basketball to pursue a career in minor league baseball—but Air Jordan couldn’t stay away from the court for long. He also starred in the 1996 film Space Jam as himself, alongside the animated Looney Toons. In all, it’s been an impressive career.\n\nThere are conflicting reports about what Michael Jordan likes to drink, and how much. Perhaps the most interesting stories go back to his days in the NBA, when he was known to drink at least a few beers in the locker room after every game. Writer Sam Smith recalled that after their first championship in 1991, he “sucked down champagne like a baby sucking on a bottle.” We’d expect nothing less."
