        "text": "Michael Jordan\n\nAmerican basketball player\n\nTop Questions\n\nWhat was Michael Jordan famous for?\n\nAmerican basketball player Michael Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to six National Basketball Association (NBA) championships (1991–93, 1996–98). He was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988.\n\nHow many times was Michael Jordan in the Olympics?\n\nMichael Jordan led the U.S. basketball team to Olympic gold medals in 1984 in Los Angeles and in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nHow tall is Michael Jordan?\n\nDuring his playing career, Michael Jordan stood at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 meters) tall.\n\nDoes Michael Jordan own a basketball team?\n\nIn 2006, Michael Jordan became minority owner and general manager of the American basketball team the Charlotte Bobcats (now known as the Charlotte Hornets).\n\nWhat was Michael Jordan's nickname?\n\nDuring his playing career, Michael Jordan, a guard, was an exceptionally talented shooter and passer and a tenacious defender. He earned the nickname “Air Jordan” because of his extraordinary leaping ability and acrobatic maneuvers, and his popularity reached heights few athletes have known.\n\nMichael Jordan (born February 17, 1963, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) is a former collegiate and professional basketball player widely considered to be one of the greatest all-around players in the history of the game. Jordan’s unmatched athleticism and competitive drive revolutionized the sport while winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls (1991–93, 1996–98).\n\n(Read James Naismith’s 1929 Britannica essay on his invention of basketball.)\n\nEducation and Olympics\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThat ’90s Quiz\n\nJordan grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, and entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1981. As a freshman, he made the winning basket against Georgetown in the 1982 national championship game. Jordan was named College Player of the Year in both his sophomore and junior years, leaving North Carolina after his junior year. He led the U.S. basketball team to Olympic gold medals in 1984 in Los Angeles and in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain. The players who competed in the latter Games became known as the Dream Team.\n\nNBA: Chicago Bulls\n\nIn 1984 Jordan, a guard standing 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 meters), was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. He quickly became known as an exceptionally talented shooter and passer and a tenacious defender. In his first season (1984–85), he led the league in scoring and was named Rookie of the Year; after missing most of the following season with a broken foot, he returned to lead the NBA in scoring for seven consecutive seasons, averaging about 33 points per game. He was only the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain) to score 3,000 points in a single season (1986–87). Jordan was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988.\n\nIn October 1993, after leading the Bulls to their third consecutive championship, Jordan retired briefly and pursued a career in professional baseball. He returned to basketball in March 1995. In the 1995–96 season Jordan led the Bulls to a 72–10 regular season record, the best in the history of the NBA (broken in 2015–16 by the Golden State Warriors). From 1996 to 1998 the Jordan-led Bulls again won three championships in a row, and each time Jordan was named MVP of the NBA finals. After the 1997–98 season Jordan retired again.\n\nCareer stats\n\nPoints per game: 30.1\n\nTotal points: 32,292\n\nSteals per game: 2.3\n\nTotal steals: 2,514\n\nTotal games: 1,072\n\nDuring this time Jordan earned the nickname “Air Jordan” because of his extraordinary leaping ability and acrobatic maneuvers, and his popularity reached heights few athletes (or celebrities of any sort) have known. He accumulated millions of dollars from endorsements, most notably for his Nike Air Jordan basketball shoes.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He was also appointed president of basketball operations for the club. However, managing rosters and salary caps was not enough for Jordan, and in September 2001 he renounced his ownership and management positions with the Wizards in order to be a player on the team. His second return to the NBA was greeted with enthusiasm by the league, which had suffered declining attendance and television ratings since his 1998 retirement. After the 2002–03 season, Jordan announced his final retirement. He ended his career with 32,292 total points and a 30.1-points-per-game average, which was the best in league history at that time, as well as 2,514 steals, then the second most ever.\n\nIn 2006 Jordan became minority owner and general manager of the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats (now known as the Charlotte Hornets). He bought a controlling interest in the team in 2010 and became the first former NBA player to become a majority owner of one of the league’s franchises. Jordan sold his share in 2023.\n\nOther activities\n\nJordan made a successful film, Space Jam (1996), in which he starred with animated characters Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. In 1996 the NBA named him one of the 50 greatest players of all time, and in 2009 he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
