        "text": "A company controlled by former NBA superstar Michael Jordan paid a recorded $16.5 million for a home in Jupiter's exclusive Bear's Club community in March 2024, not far from the sprawling 3-acre estate he built a decade ago.\n\nPalm Beach County official records show the sale of the home was completed March 27 between former homeowners Michael A. and Marla Murphy and the Illinois-based Bull & Bear LLC.\n\nBull & Bear LLC is also the owner of the 26,300-square-foot home the retired Chicago Bulls icon built in 2013 at 172 Bears Club Drive, a private golf-course community on Donald Ross Road east of Alternate A1A.\n\nHow big is Michael Jordan's new home in Jupiter's Bear's Club?\n\nThe new home covers 9,100 square feet with five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a four-car garage, pool and a guest house.\n\nWhat was the listing price for Michael Jordan's house located at 103 W. Bears Club Drive?\n\nThe house was listed in November 2023 at $18.5 million, according to the multiple listing service, or MLS. While the deed recorded last month shows a sale price of $16.5 million, the sale price on the MLS is $17 million, possibly reflecting the inclusion of other items such as furniture.\n\nWhat is the Bear's Club in Jupiter?\n\nThe Bear's Club was founded by Jack and Barbara Nicklaus in 1999. According to Realtor.com, there are just 61 estate homes in the Bear's Club. Jordan's custom-built home on 3.05 acres is likely the largest, according to the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser's website.\n\nWho did Michael Jordan marry?\n\nJordan married former model Yvette Prieto in 2013 at The Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea, holding a reception after at the NBA star's home in the Bear's Club.\n\nDoes Michael Jordan own 1000 North restaurant?\n\nThe sprawling upscale 1000 North restaurant and private club was brought to life by a group of investors including Michael Jordan, golf star Ernie Els and Cigar Aficionadoâ€™s founder/publisher Marvin Shanken."
