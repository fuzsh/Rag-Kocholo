Jordan played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. He is widely considered the greatest basketball player of all time.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nI can accept failure. Everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying [no hard work].\n\nTalent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships. (p. 20, 24)\n\nJordan, Michael. I Can't Accept Not Trying : Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of Excellence. San Francisco, CA: HarperSanFrancisco, 1994. p. 129\n\nI've reached the pinnacle of my career. I just feel that I don't have anything else to prove. When I lose the sense of motivation and the sense of 'to prove something' as a basketball player, it's time for me to move away from the game of basketball.\n\nAnnouncing his retirement from the Bulls (1993-10-06) Classic NBA Quotes: Michael Jordan.

Never second-guess life.\n\nHow to be like Mike (2005)\n\nI set another goal … a reasonable, manageable goal that I could realistically achieve if I worked hard enough. I approached everything step by step.\n\nHow to be like Mike (2005)\n\n(In 1985, Jordan broke his foot and the management, namely Jerry Krause, wanted to limit his return for fear of worsening the injury - the idea was to play seven minutes in each half) The [Bulls] came up with this whole theory you can play seven minutes a game when I'm practicing two hours a day... I didn’t agree with that math. I wanted to play. I wanted to make the playoffs. [...] Jerry [Reinsdorf] said, \"Let me ask if you had a headache and\" - there was a 10 percent chance then I’d reinjure my ankle - \"and you've got 10 tablets and one of them is coated with cyanide, would you take it?\" I looked at him and said, \"How bad is the headache?\" Jerry looked at me and said, \"I guess that's a good answer, you can go back and play.\"\n\nHall of Fame induction address, 2009\n\n[Jerry Krause] said organizations win championships. I said, \"I didn't see organizations playing with the flu in Utah.\"\n\nHall of Fame induction address, 2009\n\nI was in Chicago in 1994 and at this time I had no thoughts of coming back and playing the game of basketball, Bryon Russell came over to me and said, \"Why'd you quit? You know I could guard you.\" When I did come back in 1995 and we played Utah in '96, I'm at the center circle and Bryon Russell is standing next to me. I said, \"You remember what you said in 1994 about, 'I think I can guard you, I can shut you down, I would love to play against you?' Well, you're about to get your chance.\"\n\nHall of Fame induction address, 2009\n\nI can remember a game, we were down with about 5 to 10 points, I go off about 25 points, we come back and win the game, we're walking off the floor. Tex (Winter) looks at me and says \"There's no \"I\" in team!\" I looked at Tex and say, \"There's not, but there's an 'I' in win!\"\n\nHall of Fame induction address, 2009\n\nLimits, like fears, are often just an illusion\n\nHall of Fame induction address, 2009\n\nCan I still dunk... Are you stupid?\n\nJordan's reply to Jay Leno's question, 2010\n\nAs a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers. I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.\n\nI was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background, so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported.\n\nIf we all work together, we can foster greater understanding, positive change and create a more peaceful world for ourselves, our children, our families and our communities.\n\nMichael Jordan: ‘I can no longer stay silent’, The Undefeated (July 25, 2016)\n\nQuotes about Jordan\n\n[edit]\n\nOnce Michael gets up there he says, \"Well, maybe I’ll just hang up here in the air for a while, just sit back.\" Then all of a sudden, he says, \"Well, maybe I’ll 360. No, I changed my mind. I’ll go up on the other side.\" He’s just incredible.\n\nMagic Johnson, quoted in Classic NBA Quotes: Michael Jordan. NBA Encyclopedia. NBA Media Ventures. Retrieved on 2006-11-22.\n\nI think he's God disguised as Michael Jordan.\n\nBoston Celtics forward Larry Bird, after beating the Bulls in a 1986 Eastern Conference first-round playoff game that ended in 2OT, a game in which Jordan had scored 63 points.\n\nQuoted in Joel Achenbach (1999-01-15). \"'This Is a Perfect Time for Me to Walk Away'\". The Washington Post: p. A1 .\n\n\"So, it's the Cavs 5, and Jordan 4.\"\n\n\"…Daugherty grabbed him, and Jordan put it in anyway - he is unbelievable.\"\n\n\"…he is so strong that he can shoot and score with people actually having their hands on the ball, as Ehlo did that time…\"\n\nQuotes made by Cleveland Cavaliers broadcaster Joe Tait during Game 4 of the 1988 NBA Playoffs series against the Bulls, May 5, 1988\n\nThat play was “Give the ball to Michael and everyone else get the fuck out of the way.”\n\nBulls head coach Doug Collins on The Shot, quoted in the NBA Encyclopedia.\n\nYou don't hesitate with Michael, or you'll end up on some poster in a gift shop someplace.\n\nFelton Spencer, quoted in the NBA Encyclopedia.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan's three-point explosion in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against Portland is easily one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. As he made his sixth straight, he winked directly at Mike Fratello and me in the broadcast booth and held his palms up in a shrug, as if to say, “What can I do?”\n\nMarv Albert, quoted in the NBA Encyclopedia.\n\nMichael and I combined for 57 points.\n\nTeammate Bill Wennington, referring to The Double Nickel, a 55-point scoring performance by Jordan against the Knicks, on March 28, 1995, Jordan's fifth game back in the league.\n\nHe didn't miss games. He played hurt, with pain, when he was sick. He came out and performed at an intense level. I don't think anybody ever went away disappointed after watching Michael.\n\nPhil Jackson, quoted in Michael Jordan's 50 Greatest Games by Bob Condor\n\nThis is a day that I had hoped would never come. It has to be the toughest day in the history of the Chicago Bulls. It's a tough day for Chicago.\n\nBulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, quoted in \"Michael Jordan Retirement Press Conference\" (transcript). NBA Media Ventures. 1999-01-13 .\n\nNumber 45 doesn't explode like Number 23 used to.\n\nNick Anderson, quoted in an interview after Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals on May 7th, 1995.\n\nTo me, Jordan is the god of Basketball, and I think he will always be.\n\nDirk Nowitzki, quoted in an interview with German newspaper Die Welt, 2007-04-20.
