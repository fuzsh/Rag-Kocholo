        "text": "Michael Jordan was born February 17th, 1963 in Brooklyn, New York to James R. Jordan and Deloris Peoples. Michael and his family would soon move to Wilmington, North Carolina when he was just a toddler due to an increase in crime in Brooklyn. By Michael's sophomore year of high school he was 5'11 and was believed to be too short for the varsity basketball team at Emsley A. Laney High School. Michael would instead join the Junior Varsity team where he averaged 40 points per game becoming the star of the team. This, combined with Michael growing four inches over the summer, helped Michael earn a spot on the Varsity team in his Junior year. In his Senior year, Michael was recruited by several colleges but chose to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Michael would go on to be drafted 3rd overall by the Chicago Bulls in the 1984 NBA draft. Michael would go on to play 14 seasons with the Chicago Bulls and 3 seasons with the Washington Wizards. Michael also played on the United States Olympic teams in 1984 and 1992 where he won a gold medal at both.

He was 56 years old.\n\nPaternal Grandparents of Michael Jordan\n\nWilliam Edward Jordan was born March 2nd, 1915 in Pender County, North Carolina to Dawson Jordan and Clemwood Burns. Rosa Bell Hand was born September 6th, 1919 in Pender County, North Carolina to James Chester Hand and Ada Herring.

On his draft card he is listed as being 25 years old, living in Pender County, North Carolina, and working at a place called Harrells Store. It is unknown if William was ever drafted or if he ever served in combat.\n\nRosa died on December 4th, 1988 at age 69 and William died on July 3rd, 1990 when he was 75. During their lives together, they would have four children, Maryallene, James, Esta, and Harry.\n\nPaternal Great-Grandparents\n\nDawson Jordan was born June 24th, 1892 in North Carolina to an unknown father and Charolette Reilon.
