Jordan played for the Chicago Bulls, helping them obtained six championship titles in eight years. Now remembered for being the best and the most popular athlete in the sports world. He had a great influence on the people. \"Jordan was just another great legend\" (Stein 2). Being a role model on and off the court Jordan showed his abilities to play the game and his kindness towards other people, especially those who admired him the most. \"His widespread appeal to fans has helped keep basketball one of the world's most popular spectator sports\" (Stein 1).\n\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born on February 17, 1963, in Brookling, New York. He was the fourth of five children. His father was James Jordan and his mother was Deloris Jordan. Still a kid Jordan and his family moved away from the dangerous streets of Brookling, to go and live in a nice neighborhood located in Wilmington, North Carolina. Michael was always into sports. His favorite sport was baseball. \"He was discouraged by the fact that he could not play against his older brother and this would always get him mad\" (Wolff 130). He was not that tall, but he didn't loose hope of growing and achieving his long time goal of being a well-known professional athlete.\n\nBy junior high Jordan was five feet and eleven inches. Event though his brother Larry was only five and seven inches, he would always beat Jordan in One on One's games. Larry helped the young Jordan with his game, by practicing and guiding him during his vacation. By the time the summer ended Jordan was six feet and three inches tall and had mastered the game of basketbal...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...with all kinds of people was usually graceful. Especially for someone with so much pressure. He was very patient towards those people who tried to cheat him. His passion for the game made him lovable. Everyone liked him and who ever didn't was mistaken.\n\nMichael Jordan was the man, called not human sometimes for his spectacular and incredible plays. This man excited us during games like nobody has done it before. Jordan had it all inside and outside the court. He was both a respectable player and an honorable citizen. He made his presence on the court be felt. The name of Michael Jeffrey Jordan will forever remain in the minds and hearts of the people that watched him play. It will be a hard time for those who would try to explain who this \"Legend\" was to the young people that never saw him play, and that would always envy us for not having watched him."
