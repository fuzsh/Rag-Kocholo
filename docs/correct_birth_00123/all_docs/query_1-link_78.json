        "text": "Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ, is an American former professional basketball player, entrepreneur, and majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets NBA team. His biography on the National Basketball Association (NBA) website states, \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\" Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. Michael attended the in-state school University of North Carolina. Here is his childhood home. Please don't trespass or attempt to take anything. This is still a residential area. Just appreciate the humble beginnings of one of the most influential athletes and human beings in modern American history."
