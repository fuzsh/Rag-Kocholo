        "text": "Background\n\nMichael Jordan was one of James and Deloris Jordan’s five children born on February 17, 1963. Jordan’s family relocated to Wilmington, N.C., when he was young. His father was a G.E. plant superintendent and his mother a banker. In his father’s words: “Work hard and avoid the streets.” At first, Jordan didn’t make his high school basketball team as a sophomore. The next year he made the team. After high school, he got a basketball scholarship to play for Dean Smith at U.N.C.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls were a losing club that drew barely 6,000 spectators to home games when Jordan was chosen. Jordan swiftly changed that. His style of play and competitive nature reminded sportswriters and fans of Julius Erving, a 1970s great. Jordan’s tremendous jumps and hang time wowed fans throughout the league. He made the All-Star squad his first year and was subsequently voted the league’s Rookie of the Year. Jordan missed 64 games due to a fractured foot from 1985 to 1986, but he returned to score 49 and 63 points against the Boston Celtics in the playoffs, both N.B.A. records. From 1986 to 1987, Jordan began the All-Star game after collecting a record 1.5 million votes. He scored 3,000 points in a season for the first time since Wilt Chamberlain (1936 to 1999).\n\nThe Bulls won the N.B.A. title in 1993 after a grueling playoff series with the New York Knicks. Chicago had won their third consecutive postseason championship, with Jordan as M.V.P. Two men killed Jordan’s father, James, during a heist that summer. Jordan’s anguish at his father’s death and media reports about his gambling forced him to quit basketball in October. Jordan had won three N.B.A. championships in a row, three regular season M.V.P. awards, three playoff M.V.P. awards, seven consecutive scoring crowns, and was an All-Star every year he played. He was the Bulls’ all-time top scorer in nine seasons.\n\nIn the 19 years after his debut, Jordan has retired three times. He retired in 1993, then again in 1998, and ultimately in 2003."
