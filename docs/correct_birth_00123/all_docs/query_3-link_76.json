        "text": "WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT/Gray News) – Legendary basketball player Michael Jordan was proud Tuesday as he returned to his hometown of Wilmington, North Carolina for the grand opening of a new family medical clinic.\n\nHe and his mother made a surprise visit to the Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic’s grand opening to celebrate a big day in healthcare.\n\nThe new clinic is designed to provide healthcare for families in need.\n\nJordan grew up in Wilmington and donated $10 million to make the clinic a reality. Jordan has already helped open clinics similar to this one in other parts of the state, but he wanted his legacy to live on in Wilmington as well.\n\n“That’s what this clinic is about. When the families are not able to support, we’re there to support you, and having money doesn’t matter,” Jordan said. “We’re going to do whatever we can to support you, because that’s what happened to me, that’s where I got it from.”\n\nErnie Bovio, who heads Novant Health New Hanover Regional, said this venture with the Jordan family is new for his organization.\n\n“We’re bringing a new clinic to serve what’s been typically an underserved community to provide primary care, preventive care, screenings, those types of things, and we’re really excited about it, it’s going to be a tremendous community resource,” Bovio said.\n\nBovio said the NBA legend being there in person to open this first location shows his commitment to this community.\n\n“It was pretty cool for Michael Jordan to come here and help us dedicate and celebrate. It was really his generosity and vision that made this a reality,” Bovio said.\n\nJordan plans to open another clinic in Wilmington and has helped fund similar clinics in Charlotte."
