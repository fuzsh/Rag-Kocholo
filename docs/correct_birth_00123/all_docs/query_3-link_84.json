        "text": "Popularly known as His Airness or Air Jordan, Michael Jordan won the hearts of millions with his famous dunk shot. The basketball legend showed a knack for the game from the time he was in school. Having won several awards in college for his basketball prowess, he decided to compete in the NBA Championships at the age of 21. Though not chosen by the best NBA team, this talented player gave it his all as a member of the Chicago Bulls. He proved to be a match-turner, changing the fate of his team with his talent. From being a losing team, Chicago Bulls began winning most of their matches, and finally emerged victorious for six consecutive championships. This remarkable player is considered a treat to watch, and though he retired on two occasions, he returned every time only to mesmerize the spectators. From Chicago Bulls, he moved on to the Washington Wizards, first serving as President of Operations, and then as a player. After his final retirement, Michael Jordan took over the Charlotte Bobcats as a part-owner, with a majority hold in stakes. He then went on to become the only billionaire basketballer in history."
