The vibrant and ecstatic environment of Brooklyn has always been a magnet to artists. But what this passionate place of culture and heritage also offers is a hometown to the legends. Following the same, Carmelo Anthony and Michael Jordan joined hands for the Air Ship collection and gave a special homage to their birthplace. Also, the most anticipated sneaker on everyone’s wish list finally gets a face in the latest release “Where I’m From.”

As Carmelo Anthony takes center stage, AWAKE NY shows off its inspirations from the 90s’ downtown NYC on their fresh collaboration AWAKE NY x Jordan Air Ship PE SP Game Royal. Here is the “Love Letter” to the borough. The Brooklyn-born 10x NBA All-Star recently posted the promo on his Instagram page with the caption, “AWAKE NY & Jordan presents “WHERE I’M FROM” A love letter to the birthplace of greatness: Brooklyn.”

The short film recorded in Fort Greene features aspects of Brooklyn that made a huge part of Melo’s life. From the basketball court to the neighborhood, this video takes everyone to the insides of New York’s borough. It begins with, “We don’t question what the greatest of all time is. Where I’m from, legends are born.” It also says, “When we get in our zone, the world stops and watches.” And undeniably both Michael Jordan and Carmelo Anthony, NBA legends, brought all their spectators to the edge of their seats when they played.
