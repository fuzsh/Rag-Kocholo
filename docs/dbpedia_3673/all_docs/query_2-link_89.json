        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — PRO BASKETBALL\n\nCarmelo Anthony is remaining with the Knicks, saying he wants “to stay and build here with this city and my team.”\n\nAnthony made his decision official Sunday with a posting on his website. He writes: “In the end, I am a New York Knick at heart.”\n\nAnthony explains that he owed it to himself to explore other opportunities as a free agent, but in the end his “heart never wavered.”\n\nThe Knicks can pay the All-Star forward they acquired in February 2011 nearly $130 million over five years.\n\nKnicks President Phil Jackson is expected to talk about Anthony’s decision later Sunday in Las Vegas, where the Knicks are practicing on an off day at the summer league.\n\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — Jeremy Lin has joined the Lakers in a trade with Houston along with first- and second-round draft picks in 2015 for the rights to center Sergei Lishchuk.\n\nThe Lakers made the deal official Sunday.\n\nLin will make about $15 million this season in the last year of a deal that counts only $8 million against the salary cap. The Lakers have cap room to absorb Lin’s contract.\n\nLin averaged 12.5 points and 4.1 assists last season but lost his starting job. The Harvard player was born in Los Angeles and figures to be popular with the city’s large Asian community.\n\nLishchuk played for Valencia in Spain last season. He was drafted by Memphis in the 2004, dealt to the Rockets in 2008 and traded to Lakers in 2010.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have suspended struggling second baseman Dan Uggla for one game.\n\nThe team announced the suspension on its Twitter feed on Sunday morning, with no further explanation. Manager Fredi Gonzalez declined comment before Atlanta’s game at the Chicago Cubs, calling it an “internal matter.”\n\nUggla has played sparingly since rookie Tommy La Stella was promoted from Triple-A Gwinnett on May 28. The 34-year-old Uggla is batting .162 with two homers and 10 RBIs in 48 games.\n\nAtlanta also promoted infielder Phil Gosselin from Triple-A Gwinnett. Gosselin hit .345 with five homers and 30 RBIs in 88 games with Gwinnett.\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) — Babe Ruth’s 1918 contract with the Boston Red Sox has sold for more than $1 million, along with other baseball memorabilia up for auction in Baltimore.\n\nThe contract was among about three dozen Ruth-related items up for auction Saturday night at the Sports Legends Museum a day after the 100th anniversary of Ruth’s major league debut. Ruth was born in Baltimore.\n\nA spokesman for Goldin Auctions says a recently discovered Ruth bat from 1916 to 1918 sold for $214,000. But the first ball Ruth hit over the fence at Yankee Stadium did not reach the minimum price to sell.\n\nA Mickey Mantle glove from 1965 to 1966 sold for $180,000. And a Roy Campanella MVP award sold for $180,000.\n\nSWIMMING\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Michael Phelps was beaten by Yannick Agnel in the 100-meter freestyle at the Bulldog Grand Slam on Sunday.\n\nAgnel, who won two gold medals for France at the 2012 London Olympics and trains with Phelps at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club, won with a time of 49.37 to Phelps’ 49.42.\n\nRyan Lochte won the 200 individual medley in 1:58.65, defeating Chase Kalisz (1:59.38).\n\nAllison Schmitt, a six-time Olympic medalist who won three golds at the London Games, won the women’s 100 freestyle with a time of 54.64. Megan Romano was second in 54.93 and Amanda Weir was third in 55.17.\n\nIn other events, Becca Mann won the women’s 800 freestyle, Melanie Margalis took the women’s 200 IM, Kylie Stewart the women’s 200 backstroke, Michael Klueh the men’s 1,500 freestyle and Tyler Clary the men’s 200 backstroke.\n\nTENNIS\n\nNEWPORT, R.I. (AP) — Australian Lleyton Hewitt won in his third time in the final match at the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, beating second-seeded Ivo Karlovic of Croatia 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) on Sunday.\n\nThe 33-year old Hewitt captured his 30th career ATP title in a match that lasted 2 hours, 30 minutes.\n\nLike last year, when he had a chance to serve out the match for the title, Hewitt was broken in the second set and then lost to Nicolas Mahut of France.\n\nThis time, the third-seeded Hewitt closed it out on serve in the tiebreaker when Karlovic hit a forehand return long.\n\nAmerican John Isner beat Hewitt in the 2012 final."
