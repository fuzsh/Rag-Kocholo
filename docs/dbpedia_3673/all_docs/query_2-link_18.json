        "text": "Emily Brunemann\n\nEmily Brunemann is an American open water swimmer from Crescent Springs, Ky. Born Sept. 19, 1986 Brunemann was born into an extremely athletic family in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her parents, James and Mary Lynn, were both both student-athletes at Xavier, and her brother, Christopher, played football at Western Kentucky.\n\nBrunemann is married to Michael Klueh, a 13-time All-American from the University of Texas. Both are Dolfin-sponsored athletes vying for a trip to Rio 2016.\n\nCollege swimming career\n\nBrunemann graduated from Notre Dame Academy in high school, and graduated in 2005, choosing to swim for the University of Michigan. While at Michigan Brunemann studied Psychology, and was an extremely successful NCAA athlete. In 2006 as a freshman she qualified for the NCAA Championships, finishing 16th in the 1,650 free.\n\nDuring her sophomore year Brunemann this time finished fourth in the mile, and 12th on the 800 free relay. When she returned in 2008 for her senior year of competition, Brunemann had a great meet. She was the NCAA Champion in the 1,650 free, finished fourth in the 500 and sixth in the 400 IM. Brunemann also was on the 800 free relay that came in 14th.\n\nDrug ban\n\nIn 2009 during her senior year of NCAA competition, Brunemann was banned sixth months from the sport and missed NCAA competition. In an out-of-competition urine test, the result tested positive for a banned diuretic. Brunemann’s test was a mistake — she thought her mother’s diuretic was actually a laxative, which the arbitration panel took in consideration.\n\nNational and international pool competition\n\nBrunemann really experienced her first international competition in 2007, when she competed at the Japan Open. She finished ninth in the 800-meter free, ninth in the 400-meter free and 29th in the 200-meter free.\n\nAfter her collegiate career came to an end, she competed at a few U.S. National competitions including the 2009 National Championships where she came in fifth in the 800 free. Two years later she returned to the same competition, and this time came in seventh in the 800 free.\n\nOlympic Trials\n\nIn 2008 Brunemann had qualified for her first Olympic Trials, with qualification standards in numerous events. She finished ninth in the 800 free, 17th in the 400 free and 20th in the 400 IM. Four years later in 2012 Brunemann she qualified once again, this time finishing 11th in the 800 free.\n\nOpen water career\n\nShe began to pick up open water swimming early in 2009 at the National Championships, swimming in both the 10K and 5K, where Brunemann picked up a first and a fifth. Her finishes put her on the World Championship Team, where she finished ninth in the 5K and 24th in the 10K.\n\nIn 2010 she earned a bronze in the 10K Pan Pac Championships, and in 2013 Brunemann won the overall women’s title in the eight-race FINA World Cup, becoming the first American woman to do so.\n\nIn 2015 at the National Championships, Brunemann finished fourth in the 10K, and she moved on to the Pan Ams. She also competed in the 25K at the 2015 World Championships in Kazan. At Pan Ams she finished fourth again."
