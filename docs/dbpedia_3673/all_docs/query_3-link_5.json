        "text": "March 25, 2009\n\nJanice Lu, Texas Media Relations\n\nMichael Klueh's college resume includes an American record, nine All-America honors, ten Big 12 Championship titles and three school records.\n\nThe only things missing from Klueh's career at Texas are an individual and team NCAA title. But for Klueh only one thing will be on his mind as he heads into his last NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships, which begin Thursday in College Station.\n\n\"I'd pick an NCAA team title without a doubt. That has to be the easiest choice in my life,\" Klueh said. \"I really haven't thought much about this being my last meet as a collegiate swimmer. I've been more focused on the team.\"\n\nSo focused that when asked to give his thoughts about his college swimming career ending, the answer came back to the team.\n\n\"If anything, I'm going to dig deeper and go places my body shouldn't be able to go because I love these guys and I am racing not only for myself, but the whole team and for everyone who has ever swam here,\" Klueh said.\n\nSuch a selfless attitude by a swimmer may seem strange. There is a widely held belief that swimming is only an individual sport. But the Evansville, Ind., native feels differently.\n\n\"On the college level, swimming is very much a team sport,\" Klueh said. \"A team can get on a roll and start to feed off each other and people start swimming times they had never clocked before. My main goal this week is to help the team and really get the younger guys going by swimming well.\"\n\nIf he continues to swim like he always has, Klueh has a good chance of contributing to the total team points with solid swims in the 200 freestyle, 500 freestyle, and the 1650 freestyle. The current school record holder in the latter two, Klueh recorded a second- and third-place finish, respectively, in those same events at last year's NCAA Championships.\n\nBut equally important for the distance swimmer is ensuring that he and his teammates are all on the same page this weekend.\n\n\"We want swim the best we can and win the close races. That's all we can ask for,\" Klueh said. \"We can't control what other schools are going to do, but the team knows that if we do our best, we're going to be up there, and we're ready for that kind of pressure.\"\n\nChallenges like these seem to bring out the Longhorns' strength as a tight-knit group.\n\n\"I love the guys I'm training with. I've got a tough training partner in Jackson Wilcox, a freshman. I've had the most intense training sessions ever with him,\" Klueh said. \"We're pretty similar, I think, in that we hate to lose more than we love to win.\n\n\"Overall, it's amazing how close we are as a team. We live with each other and we're all best friends. Whatever we're doing that weekend, we're doing with 40 other guys.\"\n\nIn addition, the Longhorns will have their veteran coaches guiding them through the obstacles.\n\n\"(Head Coach) Eddie (Reese) and (Assistant Coach) Kris (Kubik) are the best coaching duo in the world by far. Every year they produce really fast swimmers,\" Klueh said. \"They are good at finding talent and producing a top-level swimmer.\"\n\nLike Klueh himself. In fact, his current post-college swimming plan is to keep training with these same coaches and teammates and explore any career possibilities in swimming.\n\n\"I want to continue swimming. In the short run, there are the World Championship trials in early July and the definite goal is to make the World Championships. But from there, I will see where swimming takes me,\" Klueh said.\n\nKlueh also has his academic priorities. The Academic All-Big 12 kinesiology senior is also interested in pursuing a career in the sciences.\n\n\"I recently decided that I want to study pharmacy so now it's going to take me some extra time to accomplish that goal,\" Klueh said."
