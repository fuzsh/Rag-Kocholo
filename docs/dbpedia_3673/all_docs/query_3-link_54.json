To see a list of scholarships that may need additional action on your part to receive consideration, select “Recommended” under “Opportunities.” All students who qualify will be automatched to these opportunities. Qualifying does not guarantee you will receive a scholarship only that you are now eligible to be considered for one. To note, you may also need to complete and submit a conditional application based on your college.\n\nBrowsing “All” Scholarships: Below is a list of all scholarship opportunities within Indiana State University’s Blackbaud system. The majority are for the 2024-2025 academic year. The “Deadline” column indicates the deadline to complete the application including submitted letters of recommendation to receive consideration. This is not the deadline to accept the award."
