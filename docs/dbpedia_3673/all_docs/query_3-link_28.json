        "text": "BLOOMINGTON, Indiana, November 3. TEXAS sophomore Dave Walters swept all five of his freestyle events and sophomore Ricky Berens won three butterfly events as the top-ranked Longhorns defeated No. 5 Michigan and No. 8 Indiana for the second time in as many days at IU's Counsilman-Billingsley Aquatics Center.\n\nIn an \"overdistance\" meet featuring events contested at unconventional distances, Texas defeated the host Hoosiers by a 91-41 margin and topped Michigan by a 69-63 count to finish the weekend at a perfect 4-0.\n\nWalters (Yorktown, Va.), who helped Team USA to gold in the 800-meter freestyle relay at the 2007 FINA World Championships, opened the meet with a win in the 600-yard freestyle in 5:24.39. Junior Caleb McDermott (Canyon Lake, Texas) responded with a victory in the 600 IM in 6:02.11.\n\nBerens (Charlotte, N.C.), a gold medalist for Team USA at the 2007 Pan American Games, chalked up his first of three victories in the 300 butterfly, when he clocked 2:51.03. Walters added his second win of the day when he finished the 300 freestyle in 2:34.89.\n\nJunior Michael Klueh (Evansville, Ind.) put the finishing touches on a successful return to his home state with a win in the 2000 freestyle in 18:34.30. Berens then added his second win of the day in the 150 butterfly, as he was victorious in 1:17.04. Walters tallied his third win of the day when he clocked 1:11.35 in the 150 freestyle.\n\nBerens registered his final butterfly win of the day in a conventional distance, 100 yards, finishing in 47.68. Walters tacked on his fourth win by finishing the 100 freestyle in 45.06, and Klueh added a 400 freestyle win in 3:34.23. Walters concluded his productive day by taking the 50 freestyle in 20.52.\n\nNo. 8 Texas collected NCAA provisional-qualifying marks from juniors Alexi Spann and Jacqueline Martin-Lacey as it put the finishing touches on a 190-180 victory over No. 23 Indiana Saturday at IU's Counsilman-Billingsley Aquatics Center. No. 13 Michigan defeated Texas by a 214-156 count, as the Longhorns, Wolverines and Hoosiers concluded the tri-meet.\n\nSpann (Austin, Texas), a 2007 All-American in the 200-yard breaststroke, took second in the same event Saturday in a NCAA provisional-qualifying time of 2:17.66. Junior Alison Soelter (Ulysses, Kan.) added a third-place finish in 2:18.33.\n\nMartin-Lacey (Nashville, Tenn.) took second in the 200-yard butterfly in a NCAA provisional-qualifying time of 2:02.29, while sophomore Susana Escobar (Queretaro, Mexico) placed third in 2:02.80.\n\nJunior Hee-Jin Chang (Seoul, Korea) led a two-three-four Texas finish in the 100 freestyle with a second-place time of 51.26. Freshman Brie Powers (Kalamazoo, Mich.) followed in 51.41, and sophomore Alex Basso (Houston, Texas) took fourth in 51.44.\n\nTexas added a third-place showing in the 400 freestyle relay, as Powers, Basso, freshman Adrienne Woods (Dexter, Mich.) and Chang clocked 3:30.72. Junior Rebecca Orr (Austin, Texas) added a third-place finish in the 200 backstroke in 2:01.96."
