        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana: Katie Ledecky broke Janet Evans’ 25-year-old meeting record to claim the women’s 1500 meters freestyle at the US National Championships on Saturday, and becoming the second fastest American of all time in the event.\n\nLedecky finished in 15:47.15 and was ahead of compatriot Kate Ziegler’s 2007 world record of 15:42.54 through 800 meters before backing off, still beating second place getter Chloe Sutton by more than 20 seconds.\n\nIt was also the fastest time of the year and capped a great meeting, which doubled as selection trials for the Barcelona world championships from July 28-Aug.4, for Ledecky who also won the 400 and 800 freestyle titles.\n\n“I was really happy with it,” the 16-year-old told reporters. “It was a swim I was looking forward to all week. I just wanted to go out with a bang.\n\n“I just wanted to swim a controlled swim, feel good and see what I could do and I’m looking forward to seeing what the US can do in Barcelona.”\n\nOlympic champion Ryan Lochte claimed the men’s 200 individual medley, also in the fastest time of the year at 1:55.44.\n\nLochte was ahead of world record pace but faded in the back half much to his disappointment.\n\n“That’s the story of this meet for me — going out fast and holding on for dear life,” he said.\n\n“I have four more weeks until worlds. Hopefully my legs won’t be as tired.”\n\nCaitlyn Leverenz won the women’s 200 IM.\n\nNathan Adrian won the men’s 50 freestyle ahead of Anthony Ervin while the evergreen Natalie Coughlin won the women’s 50 to qualify for her sixth world championships team.\n\nThe US team for the 2013 swimming World Championships announced on Saturday after completion of the US trials:\n\nMen\n\nNathan Adrian (50m, 100m freestyle)\n\nRicky Berens (4x100 free relay, 4x200 free relay)\n\nTyler Clary (200m butterfly, 200m backstroke, 400m individual medley)\n\nKevin Cordes (100m, 200m breaststroke)\n\nConor Dwyer (200m freestyle, 200m individual medley)\n\nAnthony Ervin (50m freestyle, 4x100m free relay)\n\nJimmy Feigen (100m freestyle)\n\nNic Fink (100m breaststroke)\n\nAndrew Gemmell (5km)\n\nEugene Godsoe (50m, 100m butterfly)\n\nMatt Grevers (100m backstroke)\n\nCharlie Houchin (4x200m free relay)\n\nConnor Jaeger (400m, 800m 1500m freestyle)\n\nBJ Johnson (200m breaststroke)\n\nChase Kalisz (400m individual medley)\n\nMichael Klueh (4x200m free relay)\n\nRyan Lochte (200m freestyle, 200m backstroke, 100m butterfly, 200m individual medley, 4x100m free relay)\n\nTom Luchsinger (200m butterfly)\n\nMichael McBroom (1500m freestyle)\n\nMatt McLean (400m freestyle, 4x200m free relay)\n\nAlex Meyer (10km, 25km)\n\nDavid Plummer (50m, 100m backstroke)\n\nSean Ryan (5km, 10km)\n\nKevin Steel (50m breaststroke)\n\nJordan Wilimovsky (25km)\n\nWomen\n\nCammile Adams (200m butterfly)\n\nHaley Anderson (5km)\n\nElizabeth Beisel (200m, 400m individual medley)\n\nRachel Bootsma (50m backstroke)\n\nChelsea Chenault (4x200m free relay)\n\nNatalie Coughlin (50m freestyle, 4x100m free relay)\n\nMaya DiRado (200m butterfly, 400m individual medley, 4x200m free relay)\n\nClaire Donahue (100m butterfly)\n\nEva Fabian (25km)\n\nMissy Franklin (100m, 200m freestyle, 100m, 200m backstroke)\n\nJessica Hardy (50m, 100m breaststroke)\n\nChristine Jennings (10km, 25km)\n\nBreeja Larson (100m, 200m breaststroke)\n\nMicah Lawrence (200m breaststroke)\n\nKatie Ledecky (200m, 400m, 800m 1500m freestyle)\n\nCaitlin Leverenz (200m individual medley)\n\nChristine Magnuson (50m butterfly)\n\nBecca Mann (5km, 10km)\n\nSimone Manuel (50m freestyle, 4x100 free relay)\n\nJordan Mattern (4x200 free relay)\n\nElizabeth Pelton (100m, 200m backstroke)\n\nMegan Romano (4x100m free relay)\n\nChloe Sutton (400m, 800m freestyle)\n\nDana Vollmer (100m butterfly)\n\nShannon Vreeland (100m freestyle, 4x200m free relay)\n\nHead Men’s Coach: Bob Bowman\n\nHead Women’s Coach: Dave Salo\n\nHead Open Water Coach: Catherine Vogt"
