They almost won last year, they didn't lose anybody and they have the No. 1 recruiting class.\"\n\nMichigan comes into the meet 1-0 after beating Iowa to open the season, but its three opponents each have identical records.\n\nFacing top talent early has its benefits and helps the team keep focused on its goals, said senior captain Richard Funk\n\n\"It allows us to be as motivated as we would be at the end of the season, but in October, which is great for our fitness and shape going forward,\" Funk said. \"Having this level of competition this early only helps us going into the later part of the season because we'll get fast and tough racing at the get-go.\"\n\nBoth the men's and women's teams will split their events starting at 6 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. Saturday, with post-grad races showcasing some of the nation's top swimmers during breaks.\n\nThe meet will include four of the top eight American distance swimmers, including Michigan's Connor Jaeger and Sean Ryan, and Texas' Michael McBroom and Michael Klueh. Other notable post grads will include Emily Brunemann and Junya Koga of Club Wolverine, Louisville's Joao De Lucca and Indiana's Lindsay Vrooman.\n\nRelated: Michigan swim faces challenge of replacing 'one of the best senior classes in college swimming'\n\nOn the men's side, Michigan took fourth in last year's NCAA meet, with Texas finishing second, Indiana 10th and Louisville 11th. The Texas, Indiana and Louisville women's teams finished No. 9, 12 and 15, respectively.\n\nU-M's men's team beat both Texas and Indiana last season, while the women's team fell to both. The Cardinals join the quad meet for the first time this year, making their dual-meet debut against the Wolverines."
