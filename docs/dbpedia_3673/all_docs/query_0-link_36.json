        "text": "BY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nEvansville Christian School in Newburgh, Ind., opened the home portion of the 2024 high school baseball season Thursday, April 1 against defending IHSAA Class 1A state runner-up Barr-Reeve.\n\nOn April 2, a tornado swept through the Vanderburgh County area area and caused considerable destruction to the Scott Township Park diamond where the Eagles play. There was also a fence down and trash cans overturned at Evansville Central High School’s field.\n\n“We lost a yard barn, a batting cage, half of our fence all-around including our backstop. We also had some damage to our concession stand,” says Evansville Christian coach Joe Paulin in a partial list of the wreckage at Scott Township Park caused by high winds. “Our first base bleachers blew up over a 20-foot fence and skipped across our field and into the left field corner and smashed the fence out. We woke up to that damage and it was heart-breaking.”\n\nAt a house next to the field, a tree fell and covered it and the roof was blown off of its hollow-block garage.\n\n“There were no fatalities and thankful no one was (at the field) at the time,” says Paulin.\n\nAlmost immediately the clean-up work began. The community has rallied to repair the off-campus facility the team has called home for seven years while Eagles baseball — varsity, junior varsity and Cub — has scrambled to find places to play and practice.\n\n“We’ve had to do a lot of re-scheduling,” says Paulin.\n\nThe weekend before the storm, there were about 50 volunteers doing work on the field to get it ready for the season.\n\n“We had it in the best shape it’s ever been,” says Paulin. “Less than a week later is when he damage occurred.”\n\nThrough much time, effort and donations, the field is coming back.\n\n“We feel that God has a plan,” says Paulin. “We’re going to build it better than it was.”\n\nMore than a month after the today, Evansville Christian plans to play its second home game of the spring on its home field. There’s a night game slated Friday, May 10 against Vincennes Rivet.\n\nPaulin started the EC program in 2017. Another memorable moment is his time there is when the team bus broke down. While waiting for help, he had the Eagles practicing in a gas station parking lot.\n\nSays Paulin, “We needed the work.”\n\nHeading into a May 3 road game against Perry Central, Evansville Christian is 4-6. The 2024 regular season is winding down with IHSAA sectional tournaments beginning the end of the week leading into Memorial Day (May 27).\n\nThe Eagles, which became eligible for the state tournament for the first time in 2023, is to play in a Class 1A sectional with host Northeast Dubois, Cannelton, Springs Valley, Tecumseh and Wood Memorial.\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nIf it seems like every time Indiana University Southeast baseball followers look up they see Mason White on the bases, it’s because he is there very often.\n\nThe lefty-swinging outfielder for a squad that’s 25-15 overall and 17-4 in the NAIA-affiliated River States Conference so far in 2024 has played in 41 games (all starts) and is hitting .430 (65-of-151) with 14 home runs, one triple, 16 doubles, 56 runs batted in, 45 runs scored and a 1.328 OPS (.500 on-base percentage plus .828 slugging average). He has been hitless in just four games and has 20 multi-hit contests. He gathered four hits March 13 against Campbellsville.\n\nThe lefty thrower was the everyday right fielder for IUS then moved to center field a few weeks into the season.\n\nWhite, who is 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, was recognized as RSC Player of the Week on March 18, 2024.\n\nHe also received that honor March 28, 2023. The ’23 season — his first with the New Albany-based Grenadiers — White appeared in 53 games (all starts) and hit .320 (65-of-203) with 13 homers, two triples, 25 doubles, 57 RBIs, 48 runs and 1.037 OPS (.382/.655).\n\nBrett Neffendorf is in his first season as IU Southeast head coach. Previous head coach Ben Reel stepped down at the end of 2023 and joined the Grenadiers as an assistant in recent weeks.\n\n“My first impression when I came is that (Coach Neffendorf) really cared,” says White. “He is very organized.\n\n“(Coach) Reel has been a big influence in my life. He’s done a lot of things for me personally. He’s a good guy to talk to one-on-one and you can talk about anything. He knows the game of the baseball and I’ve learned a lot from him.”\n\nIUS assistants Joe Nattermann and Gregg Oppel oversee the team’s hitters.\n\n“They have a very simple approach to hitting,” says White. “They don’t try to do too much. They only (make adjustments with) with guys if they need it or see something.”\n\nHis approach in the batter’s box?\n\n“I envision myself doing my job,” says White. “I don’t try to do to much at the plate.\n\n“I hit the ball back to where it came from. That’s my mental cue.”\n\nWhile White has driven a few balls over the fence, including in the first inning Tuesday, April 16 against Georgetown (Ky.), he does not consider himself a classic power hitter.\n\n“I’m a gap-to-gap guy,” says White. “Every once in awhile a pitcher will give me something I like and I’ll take advantage of that.”\n\nOn defense, White and the other outfielders meet with Nattermann to talk about the tendencies of opposing hitters and what the Grenadier flyhawks are going to do in certain situations.\n\nWhite likes what the Grenadiers have going on.\n\n“This group is special,” says White. “We’re an older team.\n\n“The connection is strong. We get along very well.”\n\nWhite played with three IUS mates — Ryan Kassel, Colin Long and Kody Putnam — at Southeastern Illinois College, a National Junior College Athletic Association member in Harrisburg, Ill. Putnam (Evansville Central Class of 2019) shared the field with White in high school while Kassel (Evansville Reitz Class of 2019) and Long (Evansville Reitz Class of 2020) were opponents.\n\nThe 24-year-old is scheduled to graduate from IUS this spring as a General Studies major. He is uncertain about additional college eligibility.\n\n“My goal is the play the next level,” says White. “If I want to do that I can’t be too old.”\n\nWhite redshirted for the 2022 season after transferring from SIC.\n\nIn three seasons for the Jeremy Irlbeck-coached Falcons (2019-21), White played in 108 games as an outfielder, first baseman and left-handed pitcher and hit .313 (108-of-344) with six homers and 61 RBIs.\n\nSays White, “I grew into my body, got a little more athletic and moved to the outfield.”\n\nWhite did not play college summer ball in 2019. He was with the Ohio Valley League’s Henderson (Ky.) Flash in 2020, OVL champion Dubois County (Ind.) Bombers in 2021, Prospect League’s Terre Haute (Ind.) Rex in 2022 and New York Collegiate Baseball League-winning Rochester (N.Y.) Ridgemen in 2023.\n\nBorn and raised in Evansville, Ind., White got his diamond start at the Stringtown fields, Highland Baseball and Garvin Park. He played travel ball for the Southern Indiana Spikes and was with Eugene Pate American Legion Post 265 as a high schooler.\n\nWhite played baseball and basketball at Evansville Central High School, graduating in 2018. His coach on the diamond was Mike Goedde. Scott Hudson guided him on the hardwood.\n\n“Coach Goedde was more of a quiet-minded individual,” says White. “He really knows the game. He coached the University of Southern Indiana and the University of Evansville. He had a good idea on what he was doing.\n\n“Coach Hudson (who went on to steer Wapahani girls) was a firecracker. He was a guy was couldn’t stop moving. He was all over the plate all the time, but that’s what made him such a good coach. He’s a genius at the game.”\n\nMason is the son of Jason White and the late Tara Mattox. He has three sisters (Kendra, McKenzie and McKenna) and a half-brother (Maddox).\n\nJason White coached Mason until college.\n\n“My dad has always been the reason I’m as good as I am,” says Mason. “He texts or calls me after every game and supports me mentally.”\n\nFormer Evansville Central cheerleader and basketball player Kendra White the oldest and is married with a child. McKenzie White (Evansville Central Class of 2024) played volleyball and basketball and is preparing for college. Seventh grader McKenna White plays in the school band. Maddox Ferrari, 8, attends Stringtown Elementary and plays basketball.\n\nMason White has been around folks with an affinity for the MLB team in St. Louis.\n\n“Our family favors the Cardinals,” says White. “I just like watching good players play.\n\n“I like Bryce Harper and Paul Goldschmidt. Those are my top two players right now. I like how Goldschmidt keeps it simple (while hitting). Even though he’s a righty, I reflect it in the lefty batter’s box.”\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nOnce a “walking medical phenomenon” who broke his humerus bone while pitching after Tommy John elbow surgery and came back to compete in the major leagues, Evansville, Ind., native Aaron Barrett is now using his experiences as the rehab/complex pitching coordinator for the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nBarrett toed the rubber in big league action for the Washington Nationals in 2014, 2015, 2019 and 2020 and was with the Phillies’ Triple-A team — the Lehigh Valley IronPigs — for 15 games in 2022.\n\nNear the end of that season, he transitioned into a bullpen/assistant pitching coach.\n\n“I knew I wanted to stay in baseball, but I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do,” says Barrett, 36. “After that season, the rehab pitching coordinator role opened up.”\n\nIn 2023, he served in that position at the Phillies complex in Clearwater, Fla. He oversaw all players, including pitchers, with some sort of injury. He collaborated with physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches and put together throwing programs, movement assessments, specific drills and monitored the player’s progress over time to get them back in the game.\n\n“Our motto is you want to be the best version of yourself,” says Barrett. “It was a lot of fun. There’s a really good culture down there.\n\n“This year there’s a little bit of a promotion. I’m in charge of the same role in rehab. As the complex coordinator I’ve overseeing the entire complex from a pitching standpoint.”\n\nThe Florida Complex League team is there along with new players plus Dominican Summer League players and Barrett helps them with their programs and plans, monitoring their workloads and individual goals.\n\nWhen a player exits rehab he coordinates where they’re going, what their plan is and their progression once they get to the affiliate club.\n\n“It’s a lot of work but it’s awesome,” says Barrett. “It’s been a blast.\n\n“It’s a different kind of grind.”\n\nAfter having father Dave Barrett as his first coach, Aaron went on to be a 2006 graduate of Evansville Central High School, where he played for coach Jason Engelbrecht. He played two seasons for coach Rob Fournier at Wabash Valley College (2007, 2008) in Mount Carmel, Ill., and two seasons at the University of Mississippi (2009, 2010) for coach Mike Bianco.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate to have some really good coaches from the youth level through my professional career,” says Barrett. “A lot of coaches throughout my life have made a big-time impact. The game has really given me a lot. I wanted to be able to give all the things that I learned back to the next generation of players. It’s paying it forward.\n\n“Through all of my experiences — not only as a player but the rehab side of things — it’s a perfect fit. Because of all the time that I spent, I can really relate with these players and know exactly what they’re going through.”\n\nBarrett’s immediate boss is Phillies pitching coordinator Travis Hergert. Above Hergert is player development director/assistant general manager Preston Mattingly.\n\n“We grew up together,” says Barrett of Indiana Baseball Hall of Famer Don Mattingly’s second son. “I’ve known Preston since I was about 8 year old.\n\n“This is very natural for us.”\n\nMultiple factors got Barrett to join the Phillies. Besides his relationship with Mattingly, he also came into the organization knowing Brian Kaplan (who is Phillies director of pitching development) and Sam Fuld (who serves as vice president/general manager to president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski).\n\nBarrett has been at Carpenter Complex in Clearwater since the first week of January which is when rehab players reported. Recently wrapped up was a five-week high performance camp with strength and conditioning and individualized programs.\n\nSays Barrett, “It’s another unique way we can stay in-touch with these guys and monitor their build-up.”\n\nTechnology allows for the tracking of data, including making sure players are not ramping up too fast or two slow in terms of velocity. Strength and conditioning has numbers that it uses to help players.\n\nAs a player, Barrett witnessed a change toward a data-driven way of attacking baseball.\n\n“My first half in the big leagues it was a little bit more of an old-school approach,” says Barrett. “The analytical side was just being introduced into the game then I got hurt. When I came back — the last four years of my career — I had to learn the new era about analytics and what my pitch shapes were.\n\n“I learned all that stuff.”\n\nAaron Barrett met Kendyl Mygatt while a student at Mississippi. She had transferred to Ole Miss from Texas Tech, and played soccer at both schools. They married on October 20, 2012. The couple has three children — daughter Kollyns (6) and sons Paxtyn (3) and Camdyn (born in December 2023).\n\nThe Barretts reside in the Florida panhandle town of Santa Rosa Beach. They also have a place in Evansville and try to get back their when possible to see family, including Aaron’s parents (who also have a “snowbird” condo in Florida) and grandparents.\n\n“Evansville was a great place to grow up and live,” says Barrett. “It gave me a great foundation to be in the position I am now.”\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nA squad chock-full of exceptional players — many from Indiana — competed in the high-profile World Wood Bat Association World Championship sponsored by Perfect Game.\n\nThe 5 Star/Chicago Cubs Scout Team went 4-2, making it to the Sweet 16 in the 104-team event at Oct. 4-9 at Roger Dean Complex in Jupiter, Fla.\n\nThe field featured another squad fullof players from the Hoosier State — Team Indiana Bulls. With an online tournament roster featuring standouts from Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, 5 Star/Top Tier Roos Mafia went 8-0 and won the title.\n\n“Jupiter is the best tournament in the country every year for high school ballplayers,” says Bobby Morris, who served as hitting/assistant coach for the 5 Star/Chicago Cubs Scout Team. “We had a good run.”\n\nFrom the Class of 2024 looking at Indiana players (there were also eight from Illinois, three from Kentucky, one from Michigan and one from Nebraska on the 30-man online tourney roster), there was outfielder Cole Decker (Evansville North/Cincinnati commit), first baseman/third baseman/right-handed pitcher Josh Ferguson (Evansville Central/Marshall commit), right-handed pitcher Alex Graber (Homestead/Northern Illinois commit), middle infielder Reid Howard (Forest Park/Western Kentucky commit), right-handed pitcher/utility Christian Klug (Indianapolis Bishop Chatard/Navy commit) and left-handed pitcher Ethan Lund (Hamilton Southeastern/Uncommitted);\n\nAlso, catcher/third baseman/outfielder Thomas Lynch (Evansville Memorial/Purdue commit), right-handed pitcher Brendin Oliver (Mooresville/Cincinnati commit), catcher/first baseman J.T. Stiner (Indianapolis Cathedral/Uncommitted), right-handed pitcher/third baseman/middle infielder/outfielder Cameron Sullivan (Mt. Vernon of Fortville/Notre Dame commit), right-handed pitcher Conner Vander Luitgaren (Center Grove/Evansville commit), right-handed pitcher/first baseman Mason Weaver (Homestead/Uncommitted) and right-handed pitcher Max Winders (Carmel/Western Kentucky commit).\n\nRepresenting the Class of 2025 were first baseman/left-handed pitcher/outfielder Mason Braun (Home schooler from South Bend/Uncommitted), first baseman/left-handed pitcher/outfielder Davian Carrera (Boone Grove/Indiana U. commit), right-handed pitcher/third baseman/shortstop Xavier Carrera (Boone Grove/Indiana U. commit) and first baseman/third baseman/right-handed pitcher Joshua Flores (Lake Central/Cincinnati commit).\n\nAccording to their Prep Baseball Report file, travel affiliations for these Indiana players: Decker (Louisville Legends 2024 National); Ferguson (Indiana Nitro Gold); Graber (Elite Baseball Training-Chicago); Howard (Midwest Canes); Klug (Cubs Scout Team); Lund (Nitro Gold); Lynch (Indiana Bulls Black 16U); Oliver (Canes Midwest 17U); Stiner (Cubs Scout Team); Sullivan (Indiana Nitro); Vander Luitgaren (Canes Midwest); Weaver (17U Indy Sharks Lantz); Winders (Canes Midwest); Braun (Indiana Tucci Mustangs National); Davian Carrera (5 Star Great Lakes Chiefs National); Xavier Carrera (5 Star Great Lakes Chiefs National); and Flores (5 Star Great Lakes Chiefs National).\n\nMorris, owner of the 5 Star Great Lakes Chiefs based in Crown Point, Ind., coached a 5 Star team with Carmel resident Jerry Cowan in Jupiter the past two years.\n\nIn 2023, Morris and Cowan joined with Chris Tierney of Elite Baseball Training in Chicago.\n\nEBT, headquartered two miles west of Wrigley Field and developed by Chicago Cubs Director of Hitting Justin Stone, has a relationship with the MLB team and 5 Star had a WWBA World Championhip bid so the fall team became the 5 Star/Chicago Cubs Scout Team.\n\n“We have the blessing and the support of the Cubs,” says Morris. “They watch our team closely — not just our performance but from a scouting perspective.\n\n“It’s really exciting for the kids. It’s a great opportunity.”\n\nMorris, a Munster (Ind.) High School graduate who played in the Cubs, Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds and Texas Rangers organizations, says the positives for the players are numerous.\n\nA group high-level players — most NCAA Division I commits — gets to play together in elite tournaments and against top-notch teams prior to their trip to Jupiter. Hitters get to hone their skills with wood bats and against better pitching and there is the exposure to professional baseball and scouts from around pro and college baseball.\n\n“I’d like to think they get very good coaching in the process,” says Morris, 50.\n\nTierney, 40, was the Cubs Scout Team’s director and pitching coach.\n\n“What I spend a lot of my time doing is teaching these guys how to get high-level hitters out and pitch with more confidence,” says Tierney. “These guys are getting constantly challenged.”\n\nTierney says the level of talent the scout team sees in the fall is far superior to that seen in the summer.\n\n“Whenever we go somewhere they usually put us against the top teams,” says Tierney.\n\nBefore Jupiter, the Cubs Scout Team competed in Prep Baseball Report tourneys at The Rock in Franklin, Wis., and Grand Park in Westfield, Ind., as well as exhibitions with Team Indiana, the Cangelosi Illinois Sparks, Chicago Scouts Association and Cincinnati Reds Fall Scout Team.\n\n“It’s easy to collect a bunch of all-star-oriented kids but if they don’t get a chance to play together usually they’re not very effective in (the WWBA World Championship),” says Cowan. “A lot of teams will try to go down there with a collection of studs. We try to work with our kids all fall long. We play in five or six (elite) tournaments before we go down there so they get a chance to jell together.\n\n“We as coaches have a better feel for what they can do in those team situations.”\n\nCowan, 55, had coached the 5 Star Midwest National team in 2022 and decided to focus his baseball attention on the fall team.\n\nIn forming a fall scout team, Cowan has forms a list of players who will be draft-eligible or headed to a top college program.\n\n“We identify those kids early on,” says Cowan. “I’m already starting to identify the (Class of 2025 and Class of 2026 players) for next year.”\n\nSince getting back from Jupiter, he has already 50 players reach out about getting involved next year.\n\n“When you go down there and you’re one of the top 16 teams in the nation it’s a big deal,” says Cowan. “Now that we’re affiliated with the Cubs we’ve got kids calling us from all over the Midwest.\n\n“It’s growing really fast.”\n\nWhile the 2023 team was formed through invitations, Cowan says he can see area code tryouts being part of the team-building process in the future.\n\n“It’s a select group,” says Cowan. “We’re looking for the best players.”\n\nJared Cowan — aka J.J. — is Jerry’s son and served as a Cubs Scout Team assistant. He played for Brad Lantz at Guerin Catholic High School and Jake Martin at Wabash College. The 25-year-old worked with Cubs Scout Team infielders.\n\nAnd that’s not all.\n\n“Jerry and Jared try to nurture these kids more than from just a baseball perspective,” says Morris. “I’ve got a lot of respect for how they handle things.”\n\nMorris notes that just because an athlete has committed to a school that’s no reason for a coaching staff to take their eyes off of him.\n\n“It’s so much more important for colleges to continue to watch players because of the introduction of the Transfer Portal,” says Morris. “These players have the opportunity of leaving one, two, three years down the road.\n\n“The game has changed with Name, Image, Likeness (NIL money) being available for players. The dynamics are ever-shifting.”\n\nAdds Cowan, “(a player’s) position within the program can change since the time they committed to it. A lot of times these kids are making decisions as sophomores and juniors and they’re babies.\n\n“They’re having to make huge life-altering decisions and they just don’t have enough data points to possibly be making those decisions.”\n\nCowan has also witnessed what he calls re-recruiting.\n\nSchool X may offer a 25-percent scholarship and School Y comes along proposing 50 percent.\n\nSometimes a player has not developed since their commitment and that original offer is rescinded or downgraded.\n\n“Even players who sign (a commitment letter), it’s only a year-to-year contract,” says Cowan. “That contract is renewable (or revocable) every year.”\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nDaniel Ashby had the privilege of playing baseball for four current or future head coaches while at Vincennes (Ind.) Lincoln High School.\n\nA member of the Lincoln Class of 2011, Ashby had Brandon Pfoff as his head coach with Chris Clements and Tim Hutchison — who were later Alices head coaches — and junior varsity coach Michael Bezy (now head coach at South Knox High School in Vincennes) on the staff.\n\nAfter graduating from Indiana University in Bloomington in 2015 with a Secondary Education specializing in English and Social Studies, Ashby became a Lincoln baseball coach. He was JV coach in 2016 and 2017 under Clements and varsity assistant to Hutchison 2018-2020.\n\n“I had shoulder problems at the end of my junior year going into senior year and I missed a lot of (playing time),” says Ashby. “I was kind of an extension of the coaching staff. That’s where I learned all the strategy and stuff that goes into it.”\n\nDaniel and Lexi Ashby dated in high school and college and have been married for six years. The couple has two children — son Simon (4) and daughter Ellie (2).\n\nAfter taking time away from coaching, Ashby is back as Alices head coach in 2023-24. The English teacher at Lincoln was hired during the summer.\n\nVincennes Lincoln (enrollment around 750) is a member of the Southern Indiana Athletic Conference (with Castle, Evansville Bosse, Evansville Central, Evansville Harrison, Evansville Mater Dei, Evansville Memorial, Evansville North, Evansville Reitz and Jasper).\n\nSIAC teams play each other once in conference play during the season.\n\nThe Alices are part of an IHSAA Class 3A sectional grouping in 2024 with Heritage Hills, Jasper, Pike Central, Southridge and Washington. Lincoln has won 18 sectional titles — the last in 2022.\n\nAshby, who begins leading non-fall athletes in twice-a-week IHSAA non-contact period activities starting in September, is making confidence-building a priority.\n\n“We have to believe that were are better than we probably are,” says Ashby. “It’s no secret we play a very demanding schedule.\n\n“We’ve been instilling belief and confidence really early.\n\n“The SIAC is very tough and you’re going to take your lumps. You have to understand what the ultimate goal is and what that could prepare us for.”\n\nAshby notes that conference membership has been a hot-button topic around Vincennes.\n\n“Baseball is a sport that if you get the right guys on the mound, play good defense and you don’t beat yourself you’re going to find yourself in a position to compete. That’s our goal.\n\n“It’s about how do we define success. We know that our regular-season and conference record at times is going to be a challenge. Can you keep the kids involved and believing throughout the season? Can you keep that long-term vision?”\n\nAshby faces the challenge with a staff that so far includes Bill Beard and Dustin Jones as the varsity level and Brady Brown and Jake Beaman with the JV.\n\nBeard, a retired Vincennes University professor, is a former Vincennes Rivet and South Knox head coach. He led the Rivet Patriots to IHSAA Class 1A state runner-up finishes in 2009 and 2013.\n\nJones played at Rivet and later Beard’s pitching coach. He is also the No. 1 boys basketball assistant at Lincoln and is technology director for Vincennes Community School Corporation.\n\nFirst-year Lincoln teacher Brown and long-time teacher and football defensive coordinator Beaman are also 2011 Lincoln graduates.\n\nRecent graduates moving on college baseball include Brandt Nowaskie at Indiana State University and Treven Madden, Cameron Madden and Blake Mincey at Oakland City (Ind.) University).\n\nThere are no current college commitments though standout lefty swinging/throwing outfielder/pitcher Raden Benson is uncommitted.\n\nRobert M. Hill Field at Four Lake Park — about two miles from the Lincoln campus — is home of Alices baseball. Prior to the 2023 season, the facility got a new press box, concessions and restrooms as well as Bermuda grass on the infield.\n\n“It’s in the best playing shape I’ve ever seen it,” says Ashby. “We want to re-do the bullpens.”\n\nThe high school program is fed by Vincennes Cub League, which annually draws about 700 players, plus seventh and eighth grade squads at George Rogers Clark Middle School.\n\nKirk Bouchie is VCL president.\n\nVincennes was host the 2022 Cal Ripken 10U World Series and regularly puts on Ohio Valley Regional tournaments.\n\nChad Deckard is head coach and Josh Braun (Lincoln Class of 2009) assistant at Clark Middle School. The teams play around 15 games in the spring. Veterans Field at VCL is being remodeled and will be Clark’s home diamond.\n\nAshby has been the radio voice of Lincoln football, basketball and baseball the past three years on WZDM 92.1 FM with Pat Hutchison (brother of Tim) as his color man.\n\nThe agreement between Ashby and the station is that he will do football this fall and not call basketball in the winter.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nCory Bosecker spent the past four college baseball seasons at Butler University in Indianapolis.\n\nA 6-foot-3, 215-pound left-handed pitcher, the Evansville, Ind., native took the mound for the Bulldogs 39 times (30 starts) and posted a 5.93 earned run average while amassing 165 strikeouts and 71 walks in 162 1/3 innings.\n\nIn 2023, Bosecker made a team-high 14 mound appearances (all starts) with 5.20 earned run average, club-leading 72 K’s and 33 walks in 72 2/3 innings.\n\nHe played for two head coaches — Dave Schrage and Blake Beemer — and was also a Sports Media major.\n\nNow — with an extra year of eligibility because of the COVID-19 pandemic that shortened the 2020 season — Bosecker has found a new diamond home.\n\nAs a lefty, he drew plenty of interest when he entered the Transfer Portal and has landed at Western Kentucky University and will be with the Hilltoppers for his final year in 2023-24.\n\n“I almost forgot what the recruiting process was the first time around,” says Bosecker, who signed at Butler out of Evansville Central High School where he graduated in 2019. “This has been a little more intense. It’s been fun and stressful week.”\n\nMarc Rardin is WKU’s head coach.\n\nBosecker, 22, says his best qualities as a pitcher include his experience and his ability to give his team a chance to win each time he takes the mound.\n\n“Sometimes I go out there and don’t have my best stuff, but I battle through that,” says Bosecker. “This year it helped to solidify that by adding a third pitch.”\n\nThrowing from a three-quarter overhand arm slot, Bosecker adopted a slider to go with his four-seam fastball that sits from 90-92 mph and “circle” change-up.\n\n“This year it went through a couple of different stages,” says Bosecker of his slider. “At the beginning of the season it was tighter. Throughout the season I got some more depth on it.”\n\nBosecker grew up on the north side of Evansville.\n\nHe played at Highland Little League until 12U.\n\nTravel ball teams included East Baseball at 13U (coached by Houston Dillman), Golfmoor Baseball at 14U (Mike Fetcher and Andy Cook), Southern Illinois Bullets at 15U (Tyler Choate), Indiana Spikes (Choate) at 16U and Ironmen at 17U (Ryan Wheeler). He took his 18U summer off before heading to Butler.\n\nBosecker’s high school head coach was Mike Goedde.\n\n“Coach Goedde was one of the favorite coaches I’ve had,” says Bosecker. “He was willing to help anybody and everybody.\n\n“He’s definitely that old school coach. He wasn’t scared to tear into somebody. He was also right there to build you back up. Overall, he was a really positive guy.\n\n“He was always dedicating his time to helping us and helping the program.”\n\nConsidering his spring workload and looking for a new college team, Bosecker opted not to play this summer.\n\nHe was with the New England Collegiate Baseball League’s North Adams (Mass.) SteepleCats in 2021 and 2022.\n\nCory is the son of Kevin and Jean Bosecker and older brother of Sydney Bosecker.\n\nHis father is a warehouse manager, mother a computer consultant and sister a Butler student majoring in Criminology and minoring in Psychology. The former Evansville Central tennis player just finished her freshman year.\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nEvan Kahre is coming to the close of a college baseball journey that has led to hundreds of relationships.\n\nA senior outfielder at the University of Southern Indiana in Evansville, Kahre has graduated with a Finance degree and is exploring his future options.\n\n“I don’t have anything set in stone yet,” says Kahre, who turned 24 in April. “But I have a lot of things I want to try to do. I know I have a lot of different opportunities. The great thing about playing baseball and going to three different (colleges) and playing summer ball I know I have 300-500 guys that could call me at anytime to offer me a job or an opportunity to work anywhere or do anything.”\n\nKahre (pronounced Car-EE) was born in Evansville, grew up on the north side of town and graduated from Evansville Central High School in 2017. He has spent two years each at Olney (Ill.) Central College, the University of Evansville and USI.\n\nHe played in 65 games and hit .356 (67-of-188) with three home runs, three triples, 13 doubles, 31 runs batted in, 56 runs scored and 18 stolen bases for the OCC Blue Knights in 2018.\n\nKahre committed to Evansville in the fall of his sophomore year at Olney then had hand surgery after winter break. He got into just two games in 2019 and took a medical redshirt.\n\nHe appeared in 12 games at Evansville in 2020 — the season cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic and got that year of eligibility back.\n\nKahre played in 19 games for the Purple Aces in 2021 and went 0-of-7 at the plate and opted to move on.\n\n“I was very fortunate,” says Kahre. “Growing up in Evansville I knew a lot of guys around USI’s baseball team. Coach (Tracy) Archuleta was one of the first people to call me after I entered the Transfer Portal.\n\n“I just love him as a person and as a coach as well. He’s very personable and easy to talk to.”\n\nArchuleta, who has led the Screaming Eagles program since the 2007 season, has shown the ability to get the most out of players.\n\n“When it comes down to it, if you mess up in a game he’s going to hold you accountable, which is good,” says Kahre. “He expects more out of every individual than they think they’re capable of and that’s how he’s created great teams and great players in the past.”\n\nSouthern Indiana went from NCAA Division II in 2022 to NCAA D-I in 2023.\n\n“I already knew what we were getting into,” says Kahre, having been with a D-I program at Evansville. “I really wish a lot of other guys could have seen that.\n\n“Baseball is so mental. It’s about the mindset and what you think of it. If we think we’re going to lose we probably don’t have a good chance to win. If we think we’re just as good as any team we have a really good chance to win.”\n\nMany of the players on the 2022 USI roster made the transition in 2023.\n\n“The guys we’re playing now aren’t any different than the ones we played in Division II,” says Kahre. “They put their shoes on the same way in the morning as we do.”\n\nKahre sees no skill gap between D-I and D-II position players. There might be a little with hitters and there tends to be more velocity coming from DI weekend starting pitchers.\n\nUSI is in the nine-team Ohio Valley Conference. The top eight makes the OVC tournament. The Screaming Eagles (15-36, 6-14) are currently in eighth ahead of Lindenwood.\n\nA regular season-closing series at Tennessee Tech is May 18-20.\n\n“We really need to get some wins this weekend,” says Kahre.\n\nAs an outfielder, Kahre works with assistant Seth LaRue as well as Archuleta.\n\nKahre, who is 6-foot-3 and 195 pounds and throws and hits right-handed, goes into the Tennessee Tech series hitting .304 (49-of-161) with two home runs, three triples, seven doubles, 21 runs batted in, 36 runs scored, 22 walks and 12 stolen bases. He has started in all 40 games in which he has played.\n\nIn 2022, he played in 43 contests (all starts) and hit .290 (40-of-138) with no homers, five triples, six doubles, 22 RBIs, 34 runs, 29 walks and eight stolen bases.\n\n“I’ve always been able to run a little bit,” says Kahre. “The goal is to get into scoring position.”\n\nKahre is aware of pitchers throwing off-speed pitches. He studies his pick-off move and reads balls in the dirt.\n\nDuring the season, Kahre was moved to the lead-off spot in the Southern Indiana batting order.\n\n“I see it as a leadership role,” says Kahre. “I’m trying put together a good at-bat and get on-base to start us in a positive direction.”\n\nThe past two years, Kahre played in the College Summer League at Grand Park in Westfield, Ind.\n\n“I had a great host family,” says Kahre, who stayed both years with Trevor and Abbey Hash.\n\nHe did not play summer ball in 2020 and was with the Dubois County Bombers in Huntingburg, Ind., in 2018 and 2019. Andy Lasher (who is now head coach at Oakland City University) was the manager the first year and Travis LaMar the second.\n\nKahre’s formal baseball start was in Cal Ripken. He played travel ball for Boonville/Indiana Gold and in his 17U summer the Indiana Outlaws (now known as the Canes Midwest) and the 18U Evansville Leathernecks (based out of the training facility then now as Extra Innings and now Complete Game).\n\nMike Goedde, a former USI head coach and two-time UE pitching coach, was Kahre’s head coach at Evansville Central.\n\n“Playing in high school is where I learned a good amount more about how the game should be played,” says Kahre. “(Goedde) taught us how to do the little things right.”\n\nBrett and Stacey Kahre have three sons — Evan, Dax and Ashton. Brett Kahre played football at Evansville Central and now works in engineering for Brake Supply in Evansville. Stacey Kahre played softball at Evansville Reitz and UE and owns Midwest Skin Institute, a dermatology business in Evansville.\n\nDax Kahre (Evansville Central Class of 2021) played baseball in high school and is now a USI student. Ashton Kahre played baseball and soccer and picked up lacrosse in high school. He is an Evansville Central senior.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nTodd DeWeese likes to keep it moving on the baseball field.\n\nEspecially when it comes to the offensive side of the game.\n\nA 1986 graduate of Francis Joseph Reitz High School in Evansville, Ind., DeWeese played for a coach — Steve Johnston — who taught some of the concepts that DeWeese uses as the 10th-year head coach at his alma mater.\n\n“We learned to do a lot more offensive situational things,” says DeWeese. “There were hit-and-runs, bunts and steals.\n\n“There are a couple of things from when I played at Reitz that we still use in today’s game. It’s a lot of putting runners in motion and playing small ball.”\n\nLed by seniors Anthony Acuff (8), Pierce Herrenbruck (5) and Nate York (5), Reitz (14-10) had 43 stolen bases and four home runs through the first 24 games of 2023.\n\n“We use the steal more than the sacrifice bunt,” says DeWeese. “We don’t have the firepower right now so we have to incorporate the small ball.”\n\nFormer second baseman and Greater Evansville Baseball Hall of Fame inductee DeWeese played at the University of Southern Indiana in Evansville for Gary Redman.\n\n“We use defensive bunt situations that he instilled in us,” says DeWeese. “We use his slap-and-steal. You don’t see a whole lot of that.\n\n“Rodman was very good in first-and-third situations.”\n\nBefore taking his current post, DeWeese was an assistant at Evansville Bosse for four years on the staff of Jeremy Jones (current Evansville North head coach).\n\nReitz (enrollment around 1,300) is a member of the Southern Indiana Athletic Conference (with Castle, Evansville Bosse, Evansville Central, Evansville Harrison, Evansville Mater Dei, Evansville Memorial, Evansville North, Jasper and Vincennes Lincoln).\n\nThe Panthers are part of an IHSAA Class 4A sectional grouping in 2023 with Castle, Evansville Central, Evansville Harrison and Evansville North. Reitz has won five sectional titles — the last in 2015.\n\nElijah Dunham (Reitz Class of 2017) was a standout at Indiana University and is now with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in the New York Yankees organization.\n\nOther recent graduates moving on to college baseball include the Class of 2019’s Nolan Cook (University of Southern Indiana), Class of 2020’s Adam Euler (University of Evansville), Colin Long (Vincennes University) and Aaron Massie (Northern Kentucky University), Class of 2021’s Bryce Cape (Southeastern Illinois College) and Class of 2022’s Gavin Schippert (Wabash College) and Stone Silver (Wabash Valley College).\n\nCooper Davis (DePauw University), Herrenbruck (Rend Lake College), Kiefer Parsons (Oakland City University) and York (Rend Lake College) are current commits in the Class of 2023.\n\nReitz, which is a part of Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation, plays its varsity home games at historic Bosse Field (which opened in 1915). The facility is also used by Mater Dei High in the spring and the professional Evansville Otters in the spring and summer.\n\nWhile its 315 feet down the lines, it’s around 400 feet to center field and about 375 to the gaps, meaning the old park has an outfield bigger than most.\n\nIndiana High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Famer Don Mattingly (Evansville Memorial Class of 1979) poked 25 career triples — an IHSBCA record.\n\nThree of the top 10 single-season triples marks in IHSBCA annals belong to Memorial teams that played many of their games at Bosse Field.\n\n“You better have a center fielder that can cover some ground,” says DeWeese.\n\nExpansive foul ball territory often makes pop-ups an adventure.\n\n“Bosse Field can make a lot of third basemen and first basemen look lost,” says DeWeese. “They give up on it. There’s a lot of movement and (the ball) ends up behind them.”\n\nThere’s another quirk with the proximity of dugouts to home plate.\n\n“Bosse Field is so tight if we’re in the third base dugout and there’s a left-hander up I’ll duck down below the net line of the dugout,” says DeWeese. “You’re probably 25 feet away from home.\n\n“You don’t have time to react. It’s right on you.”\n\nJunior varsity, freshmen and Cub teams play and varsity practices — and occasionally plays games — at Barker Avenue Sports Complex.\n\nReitz Cub Baseball this year features about 20 eighth graders that are on a path toward the high school. That squad plays doubleheaders each Sunday. There are also rural youth leagues on the west side that feed athletes to Reitz.\n\nIn 2023, DeWeese counts Steve Gresham and Jay Hille as varsity assistants. Mark Zeller leads the junior varsity team with help from Camden Hahn and Terrance Davis. Freshmen are guided by Garry Barr with assistance from Kevin Kisner. Hille, Zeller, Hahn and Barr are all Reitz grads. Gresham went to Wood Memorial High School in Oakland City, Ind., and Davis to Ben Davis in Indianapolis.\n\nDeWeese teaches Social Studies to sixth graders at Perry Heights Middle School.\n\nTodd and wife Shelly DeWeese, a Jasper (Ind.) High School graduate, have two children — son Connor (24) and daughter Riley (23). Connor DeWeese (Class of 2017) played baseball and football and Reitz. Riley DeWeese (Class of 2018) was in soccer, track and cheerleading.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nPaul Gries has been a very active member of the Evansville, Ind., athletic community.\n\nThe Pocket City native taught for 34 years in the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation — 10 at Plaza Park (K-8) and the rest at Central High School. His main subjects were Physical Education and Health.\n\nWhatever the season, Gries was organizing and coaching youngsters in flag football, softball, baseball, soccer, basketball and more.\n\nIn 1978, he accepted an invitation to join John Wessel’s Central boys basketball coaching staff.\n\nIn 1980, he was asked to be a Bears baseball assistant.\n\n“We hardly had a program at all,” says Gries, who took over as head coach in 1981 and began working in earnest on Central’s field.\n\n“If you want to call it a field,” says Gries. “It was nothing. But I had dreams of what I wanted the baseball field to look like.”\n\nWith the help of players, coaches and parents, a diamond which was named in honor of Gries in 2016 (Paul Gries Field was dedicated in 2017 a few days after Gries underwent heart surgery) was steadily-crafted.\n\nGries, 79, was head baseball coach at Central for 21 seasons (1981-2001) before retiring at 58 and going into the Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nHis teams went 408-196 and earned the first seven sectional titles in program history (1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1996, 1997 and 1998) plus the first two regional championships (1981 and 1987) and only semistate crown (1987). Central lost 4-1 to the LaPorte’s mythical national champions in the ’87 state championship game at Bush Stadium in Indianapolis.\n\nGries coached in the IHSBCA North/South All-Star Series in 1987 and was named National Coach of the Year in 2000.\n\n“I had some good players (including 1985 graduate and future big league pitcher Andy Benes) and tied to get the most out of every player,” says Gries. “I was spending 14-hour days at Central High School. I was putting every ounce into it.\n\n“It just wore me out.”\n\nIt was in 1987 that Gries was approached by longtime professional baseball man and Evansville resident “Singing” Ed Nottle, who had a daughter who was taught by Gries.\n\nNottle wanted to help Gries and other coaches raise money for their programs.\n\n“We had car washes, candy sales and whatever you can image, but we were making making peanuts until Ed came along,” says Gries, who gathered all the high school and college coaches in town at the EVSC office and what came from planning sessions was the Friends of Bosse Field “Night of Memories.”\n\nWhat began as a group of former baseball professionals who wanted to ensure that the history of Bosse Field would not be forgotten while fundraising turned into the Tri-State Hot Stove League. Gries served with that organization for 31 years, including stints as vice president and president, and is still involved.\n\nOne of the first “Night of Memories” guests was National Baseball Hall of Famer Yogi Berra. Gries flew to New Jersey to bring Yogi to town.\n\nOver the years, Evansville native and Indiana Baseball Hall of Famer Don Mattingly aka “Donnie Baseball” was at the first special night and has only missed it on a few occasions.\n\nGries coached Taylor Mattingly (Don’s oldest son) at Central. When Don was playing for the New York Yankees, he would get in the batting cage take swings after winter workouts by the Bears.\n\n“He’d say, ‘Paul, give me some situations.’ I’d, ‘man on third, tie game, one out in the eighth or ninth inning’ and Mattingly just hit those fly balls,” says Griese. “It was unbelievable how Mattingly prepared himself.”\n\nThe next Tri-State Hot Stove League “Night of Memories” is scheduled for Saturday, Jan. 21, 2023 at Meeks Family Fieldhouse in the Carson Center at the University of Evansville. A paid autograph session is slated from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. Central Time followed by a chat and live/silent auction at 6.\n\nFeatured guests include Don Mattingly, Jamey Carroll, Jerad Eickhoff, Aaron Barrett, Colson Montgomery, Elijah Dunham, Cameron Decker, Wayne Hagin, Denny McLain, Darrell Evans and Graig Nettles.\n\n“He’s unbelievable,” says Gries of emcee Hagin, who has been a play-by-play man for the Oakland Athletics, San Francisco Giants, Chicago White Sox, Colorado Rockies, St. Louis Cardinals and New York Mets. “People love listening to the stories.”\n\nAmong past guests: Mattingly, Carroll, Eickhoff, Barrett, Hagin, Gabby Allison, Rick Ankiel, Clint Barmes, Andy Benes, Yogi Berra, Raymond Berry, Lou Brock, Don Buse, Steve Carlton, Jack Clark, Roger Clemens, Danny Cox, Andre Dawson, Jim Edmonds, George Foster, Kyle Freeland, Steve Garvey, Bob Gibson, Goose Gossage, Mark Grace, Bob Griese, Kevin Hardy, Keith Hernandez, Whitey Herzog, Paul Hornung, Al Hrabosky, Andruw Jones, Tommy John, Jim Kiick, Harmon Killebrew, Lily King, Ray Lankford, Tony LaRussa, Johnny Latner, Larry Little, Gaylord Perry, Bobby Plump, Ozzie Smith, Bob Feller, Brooks Robinson, Scott Rolen, Enos Slaughter, Frank Robinson, Andy Van Slyke, Lee Smith and Brad Wilkerson.\n\n“They come from all over when they know Don Mattingly is here,” says Gries. “They can get close to him. People in New York can’t do that.”\n\nCollege/Pro Football Hall of Famer Griese (Rex Mundi High School Class of 1963 and Purdue University Class of 1967) has been to many “Night of Memories.”\n\n“We do this for the kids,” says Gries, who notes that the a non-profit group has raised close to $2 million for youth athletics and youth-focused organizations in Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky in three decades.\n\nGries says the event at its peak netted up to $90,000 in one day.\n\nSome of the money has been given to Habitat for Humanity. Gries says Mattingly, Bob Griese, Brian Griese (Bob’s son who now coaches with the San Francisco 49ers), Calbert Cheaney (a 1989 Evansville Harrison High School graduate who played at Indiana University, the National Basketball Association and now coaches with the Indiana Pacers) and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Jerry Sloan (who played at Evansville College and the NBA and was a longtime NBA coach) all\n\ngave large sums to sponsor homes.\n\nA 1961 graduate of Evansville Mater Dei High School, Gries’ prep baseball coach was Len Will (an Indiana Football Hall of Famer).\n\n“He was the gentlest man that I know,” says Gries. “That was the example he shared with us (athletes).”\n\nOn the basketball court, Gries eclipsed the 40-point mark three times including a single-game record of 44. That was long before the 3-point arc was put in place. Mater Dei was led on the hardwood by Ed Schultheis in Gries’ freshman and sophomore years and Tom Gore in his junior and senior seasons.\n\nGries went to Indiana State College (now Indiana State University) for basketball and baseball during an era when freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity.\n\nThe injury bug kept biting him on the hardwood. He suffered torn cartilage working out early in his freshman year then experienced ankle and groin ailments as a sophomore and decided not to stick with the Duane Klueh-coached Sycamores.\n\nOn the diamond, Gries earned three letters (1963-65, helping the Sycamores go a combined 37-24-2) playing for Paul Wolf (who wound up as a member of both the IHSBCA Hall of Fame and ISU Athletics Hall of Fame).\n\nOne of his fond memories is playing catch with future IHSBCA Hall of Famer Tommy John and having John feed the pitching machine for him during preseason workouts before the 1961 Terre Haute Gerstmeyer High School valedictorian reported to spring training.\n\nGries paced Indiana State in batting average, hits and runs as a junior in 1964 (.357, 25 and 20 ) and senior in 1965 (.413, 26 and 13). He hit .439 in conference games and was Indiana Collegiate Conference co-MVP with Ball State’s Merv Rettenmund (who went on to play 13 in the majors with the Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Reds, San Diego Padres and California Angels and coached for the Texas Rangers, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres twice, Atlanta Braves and Detroit Tigers).\n\n“The great thing about Paul Wolf is that he was old school,” says Gries.\n\nWolf was a minor league middle infielder 1926-33, including time with the Indianapolis Indians in 1930-31. He was able to pass on wisdom to Gries, who was a switch-hitting shortstop at Indiana State and moved to second base in his second of two pro seasons in the Washington Senators organization (1965-66).\n\n“Pee Wee” (he was 5-foot-9 and 157pounds) spent much of the 1965 Appalachian League season on the disabled list with a sprained ankle after a collision at home plate.\n\nIt was during the Vietnam War era and Gries left baseball to joined the U.S. Army Reserves and got married for the first time.\n\n“I got to see the difference between high school and college and college and pro,” says Gries. “What a big step it is.”\n\nDivorced in 1989, Gries was single for 14 years and has been married to Mary, a fellow Catholic who moved to Evansville from Auburn, Ind., for 19 years.\n\nGries has five children, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n\n“They are the joy of my life,” says Gries. “I’m going to spend as much time with my kids as I can.”\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nRobbie Frank was a sophomore starter on Evansville (Ind.) Central High School’s IHSAA state runner-up baseball team in 1987.\n\nThe 29-win Bears lost 4-1 to LaPorte in the championship game. The Slicers went to be named mythical national champions in that season.\n\nFrank started at shortstop for Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Famer Paul Griese as a junior and senior at Central and played one season as a utility player at Saint Louis University for Billikens head coach Bob Hughes.\n\nThe Central Bears were ranked No. 1 during the 1988 season. Central lost to Memorial in the sectional championship in both 1988 and 1989 — 3-0 and 8-2. The Tigers lost in the first round of the semistate in 1988 and won the state crown in 1989.\n\nEnergy and passion are two things Frank saw Griese bring to the diamond.\n\n“It was a great experience to play under him,” says Frank. “We were a very talent team 1987-89. It was a good time to be at Central.”\n\nIn the summer of 1989, Frank played American Legion baseball for Evansville Funkhouser Post 8. Henry “Mac” LaRue was the manager and son Mark LaRue the head coach.\n\nLater on, Frank coached Highland Little League teams in Evansville, including a state runner-up squad when his players were 12 and state champion unit when they were 13. Bryce Frank, Robbie’s son, was on those teams.\n\nRobbie Frank has served as manager for Evansville Pate American Legion Post 265, guiding a junior squad to the state championship in 2021 and leading a senior team in 2022. He plans to do the same again in 2023, scheduling 30 to 35 games against the best competition he can find.\n\nFrank also spent the past 10 years as an Evansville Central assistant. After head coach Mike Goedde retired at the end of a 12-year run in 2022, Frank was elevated to head coach.\n\n“He’s an old school coach,” says Frank of Goedde. “He’s big on playing the game the right way. He gives a lot of responsibility to the kids — not only in baseball but in life.”\n\nGoedde expected his players to represent themselves, their families and their schools in an appropriate way.\n\n“You never know who’s watching or looking out,” says Frank.\n\nWhen Frank was hired as Central head coach he had one-on-one meetings with returning sophomores, juniors and seniors to discuss expectations.\n\nHe plans to have IHSAA Limited Contact Period practices — twice a week for two hours — working around basketball which is also having LCP workouts.\n\nAmong the recent Central graduates to move on to college baseball are the Class of 2022’s Aiden Esarey (Goshen College), Gavin Kelley (Grace College), Ben Kennedy (Taylor University), Ethan Lyke (Murray State University), Ethan Rothschild (University of Southern Indiana) and Kaiden Turner (Grace College), 2021’s Henry Brown (Indiana State University), Garrett Causey (University of Southern Indiana) and Mason Simon (Oakland City University), 2019’s Cory Bosecker (Butler University) and Kody Putnam (Southeastern Illinois College and transferred to Jacksonville State University), 2018’s Sean Becker (Indiana University-Kokomo and transferred to Kentucky Wesleyan College) and Mason White (Indiana University Southeast) and 2017’s Evan Kahre (University of Southern Indiana).\n\nEvansville Central (enrollment around 1,075) is a member of the Southern Indiana Athletic Conference (with Castle, Evansville Bosse, Evansville Harrison, Evansville Mater Dei, Evansville Memorial, Evansville North, Evansville Reitz, Jasper and Vincennes Lincoln).\n\nThe Bears were part of an IHSAA Class 4A sectional grouping in 2022 with Castle, Evansville Harrison, Evansville North, Evansville Reitz and Jasper.\n\n“It’s a dogfight every year,” says Frank.\n\nCentral has won nine sectional titles — the last in 2017.\n\nThe process of hiring Frank’s assistant coaches is in progress.\n\nThe Bears play home games at Paul Griese Field. Goedde had Bermuda grass added to the infield a few years ago.\n\nEach spring, Cub Baseball in Evansville has eighth graders (and some seventh graders) competing on behalf of the high schools they are feeding.\n\nRobbie Frank, who is president of Frank Insurance Services Inc. (owned by father Gene Frank), has three children — Faith, Ellie and Bryce. Faith Frank (20) is a former Evansville Central basketball and track athlete now studying at Ivy Tech in Evansville. Ellie Frank (19) was a two-time first-team all-state lacrosse player for the Bears and is now a Murray (Ky.) State University freshman. Bryce Frank (17) is a junior baseball player at Evansville Central."
