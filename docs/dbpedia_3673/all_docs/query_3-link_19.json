        "text": "By Gretchen Ross - bio | email | Twitter\n\nPosted by Sarah Harlan - email\n\nEVANSVILLE, IN (WFIE) - Saint Mary's officials said they can't talk in specifics about the case of Jennifer McGarrh because of patient confidentiality, but officials did confirm the patient does have Swine Flu.\n\nWhen the doors open to Saint Mary's Medical Center, a new warning greets visitors.\n\n\"If you have an individual or a visitor who has been exposed to seasonal flu who has a headache, who doesn't feel well, who has all the signs and symptoms, they should not come to the hospital,\" Michael Klueh, PhD with St. Mary's Medical Center said. \"They should stay at home for the protection of the other visitors, patients, and staff.\"\n\nDoctor Michael Klueh with Saint Mary's said the medical centers' policy states a maximum of two visitors are allowed to see a patient being treated for the H1N1 virus.\n\nDr. Klueh said about five extended family members that visited Jennifer Mcgarrh were asked to leave, not because they displayed symptoms of the Swine Flu, but because they had been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"We did provide the mother and father of the patient with a room here in Evansville because they are from out of town,\" Klueh said.\n\nA family member said they asked to get tested for H1N1, and were told the hospital could not test them.\n\n\"We would send them to their physician, and actually the recommendation is to not test for H1N1 on every patient, or everyone who has been exposed, but rather there are recommendations from the CDC, and the state as far as prophylactics and giving them antiviral,\" John Gallagher, MD with St. Mary's Medical Center said.\n\nWhile Doctor John Gallagher said he can't speak to individual patients, he said high-risk patients like pregnant women who catch H1N1 are treated within 48 hours.\n\n\"Basically, the criteria for hospitalization would be the same for the flu as other illnesses,\" Gallagher said. \"Does it require the skill and equipment we have to care for them?\"\n\nRight now, McGarrh is listed in the intensive care unit in critical condition.\n\nSaint Mary's officials said there are five recent cases of H1N1: one in-patient and four out-patients.\n\nOf those four, three were children and one was a geriatric case."
