They currently compete in the Missouri Valley Conference. The team last played in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 2011.\n\nTheir first season was 1896; making the Sycamores the oldest basketball team in the NCAA, along with Bucknell, Minnesota and Washington. The records from 1896-1899 no longer exist. The Sycamores boast of 2 College Player(s) of the Year; 14 All-Americans, 33 1,000-point scorers and 1,360+ victories. Their victory count places them in the Top 70 of all NCAA Division I programs.[1]\n\nIn addition, the Sycamores have 23 Post-Season Appearances (7 NCAA, 2 NIT, 1 CBI, 12 NAIA and the 1936 Olympic Trials) with 5 National Championship Appearances (2 NCAA, 3 NAIA). Seven Sycamores were members of the 1951 Pan-American Games Gold Medal-winning team. The Sycamore's greatest season was 1978-79, when star Larry Bird led an undefeated team to the national title game versus the Magic Johnson-led Michigan State team; and ended the season as the NCAA Division I National Runner-Up with a record of 33–1.\n\nThe Sycamores were the National Runner-Up in the College Division (now Div II) in 1968 and won the NAIA National Title in 1950, with NAIA Finals Appearances in 1946 and 1948 and NAIA National Semi-finals appearances in 1949 and 1953. Past coaches include the legendary John Wooden; fellow Purdue University star Dave Schellhase, Indiana-coaching legend Glenn M. Curtis and well-known college coaches such as Bob King, Royce Waltman, Tates Locke and Ron Greene. The Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team play their home games at Hulman Center (10,200); and are coached by Greg Lansing.\n\nDiv I NCAA Tournament Results[]\n\nThe Sycamores have appeared in 3 NCAA Tournaments.

The winning team would earn the right to name five players to represent the United States in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, the first Games to feature the American sport of basketball. By earning the bid, the Sycamores joined a select group of college teams hand-picked by the Amateur Athletic Union, the U.S. governing organization.\n\nThe Olympic team members were selected from the best AAU teams and winners of the national collegiate tournament conducted in eight regional districts. The Sycamores earned a bid by defeating every team on their schedule, including the 1935 national AAU champion Tulsa Diamond Oilers. Indiana State advanced to the district finals and were pitted against Coach Ray Meyer’s DePaul Blue Demons, at Chicago Stadium, DePaul’s home court. Despite vaulting to a 10–0 lead, maintaining a 16–10 halftime advantage and outscoring the hosts from the field, Marks’ cagers lost on a long shot in the waning moments of the game, 29–28.\n\n1951 Pan American Games[]\n\nThe 1949–50 squad won the NAIA 1950 National Championship. Subsequently, Coach John Longfellow and eight Sycamore players were invited to represent the United States in the inaugural (1951) Pan American Games, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Sycamores Roger Adkins, Dick Atha, Richard Babcock, Bob Gilbert, Tom Kern, Gene Lambdin, Ed Longfellow, and Cliff Murray represented the United States and Indiana State University. The United States defeated the national teams of Ecuador (74–32), Cuba (77–55), Panama (90–55) and Brazil (69–42) to reach the championship game against Argentina. The Americans defeated the hosts, (57–51), for the gold medal.\n\nUSA Basketball[]\n\nIn addition to the Olympic Trials and the 1951 Pan-American games; Larry Bird was a member of the 1992 Dream Team, as well as a member of the 1977 World University Games and 1978 World Invitational Tournament teams.
