        "text": "Oct. 24, 2014\n\n Complete Results | Photo Gallery\n\nSite: Ann Arbor, Mich. (Canham Natatorium)\n\nScores: Michigan 107, Texas 79; Michigan 124, Louisville 62; Michigan 130.5, Indiana 55.5 (After Day 1)\n\nNext U-M Event: Saturday, Oct. 25 -- vs. Indiana, Texas, Louisville (Canham Natatorium), 10 a.m.\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Behind five event wins, the University of Michigan men's swimming and diving team burst out to leads over Texas (107-79), Louisville (124-62) and Indiana (130.50-55.50) on the first day of the team's big quad meet on Friday (Oct. 24) inside Canham Natatorium.\n\nSenior captains Justin Glanda (200-yard freestyle) and Richard Funk (100-yard breaststroke) both claimed impressive victories, as did junior Dylan Bosch (200-yard butterfly) and freshman Paul Powers (50-yard freestyle). Powers was perhaps the most impressive, touching the wall at 19.79 in the 50-yard freestyle, an NCAA 'B' time that currently ranks eighth best in program history in only his second collegiate meet.\n\nMichigan hit a bump in the meet's first event, as the quartet of Aaron Whitaker, Funk, Bosch and Bruno Ortiz had the fastest time (3:11.06) but was disqualified due to an early takeoff on the last leg. But the Wolverines responded quickly, beginning with the 200-yard freestyle, where Glanda and junior Anders Nielsen went 1-2, touching the wall within two hundredths-of-a-second (1:36.93 and 1:36.95, respectively). Those two and sophomore Jack Mangan, who was sixth (1:37.77), all achieved NCAA 'B' times.\n\nThe Wolverines used depth to grab some more points in the 100-yard backstroke. Freshmen Tristan Sanders (49.00) and Aaron Whitaker (49.06) were third and fourth, while junior Peter Brumm was fifth (49.13). Then, just before the break, Funk rallied to win the 100-yard breaststroke (53.22) after trailing by four tenths-of-a-second at the halfway point. Junior Matt McNamara (55.62) and sophomore Chris Klein (56.02) were fourth and fifth, respectively, in that race, as well.\n\nIn the 200-yard butterfly, Bosch was in a field of his own. Last year's NCAA champion got out of the water first at 1:43.93, more than three seconds faster than Indiana's Steven Schmuhl, who took second (1:47.37). Bosch also scored a second-place finish in the 200-yard individual medley (1:47.13), a team best. Following Powers in the 50-yard freestyle was Ortiz in third (20.20) and sophomore Vinny Tafuto in a tie for fifth (20.36).\n\nU-M placed four of the top six in the 1,000-yard freestyle, including Nielsen (second, 9:07.20), freshman PJ Ransford (third, 9:08.52), sophomore Cameron Stitt (fifth, 9:19.27) and freshman Ian Rainey (sixth, 9:21.31).\n\nThe Wolverines did get some better luck in the final relay of the night, as the foursome of Powers, Ortiz, Tafuto and Glanda took first (1:18.98). Powers, who went 19.79 earlier in the night, was slightly better in the leadoff leg on this race, going 19.77. In fact, the three other men on that relay finished in less than 20 seconds for their splits, too: Ortiz (19.67), Tafuto (19.88) and Glanda (19.66).\n\nIn the diving well, senior Thomas Jahnke (262.75) and sophomore Ryan O'Donnell (252.00) were the team's best finishers in eighth and ninth, respectively.\n\nAll four teams are back in the water tomorrow (Saturday, Oct. 25) to conclude the quad. The action will begin at 10 a.m.\n\nPOST-GRADAUTE RACES\n\n100-yard Backstroke\n\nJunya Koga (Club Wolverine) -- 45.48\n\nJames Wells (Bloomington Swim Club) -- 46.60\n\nPedro Oliveira (Cardinal Aquatics) -- 47.62\n\n200-yard Breaststroke\n\nCody Miller (Bloomington Swim Club) -- 1:53.78\n\nKyle Whitaker (Club Wolverine) -- 1:56.38\n\n200-yard Freestyle\n\nJoao De Lucca (Cardinal Aquatics) -- 1:34.09\n\nMichael Klueh (Club Wolverine) -- 1:35.07\n\nConnor Jaeger (Club Wolverine) -- 1:35.64\n\nMichael Wynalda (Club Wolverine) -- 1:36.28\n\nHassaan Abdel Khalik (Club Wolverine) -- 1:37.72\n\nMichael McBroom (The Woodlands Swim Team) -- 1:37.96\n\nPedro Oliveira (Cardinal Aquatics) -- 1:45.11\n\n50-yard Stroke\n\nZach Hayden (Club Wolverine) -- 19.86\n\nJunya Koga (Club Wolverine) -- 19.94\n\nKyle Whitaker (Club Wolverine) -- 21.68\n\nCody Miller (Bloomington Swim Club) -- 21.84\n\nJames Wells (Bloomington Swim Club) -- 21.84\n\nN O T E S\n\n Though the 'A' team in the 400-yard medley relay was disqualified, the 'B' team of Tristan Sanders, Matt McNamara, Peter Brumm and Paul Powers took third (3:15.86). That group beat Indiana's top team by nearly a full second.\n\n Several swimmers rank among the nation's best following Friday's times: Richard Funk in the 100-yard breaststroke (first), Justin Glanda and Anders Nielsen in the 200-yard freestyle (first and second), Dylan Bosch in the 200-yard butterfly (second), Paul Powers in the 50-yard freestyle (third).\n\n Among the post-graduate races tomorrow (Oct. 25), the 1,000-yard freestyle appears to be the best. Four of the top eight American distance swimmers will swim the race, including Connor Jaeger (No. 1), Michael McBroom (No. 2), Sean Ryan and Michael Klueh."
