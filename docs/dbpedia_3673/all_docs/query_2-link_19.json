        "text": "PLANTATION, Florida, March 14. THERESA Michalak won the 100 fly and 400 IM and Michael Klueh picked up his second individual win of the meet in the men’s 200 free during the second nigh of racing at the Speedo Champions Series sectional meet in Plantation, Fla.\n\nNight two began with finals in the women’s and men’s 200 free. SwimMAC Carolina’s Patricia Castro Ortega dominated the women’s event with a 2:00.88, almost two seconds ahead of South Florida’s Alia Atkinson, who posted a 2:02.85. Atkinson finished a hair ahead of TSC’s Paige Schultz (2:02.94) who claimed third. Club Wolverine’s Michael Klueh earned his second individual win of the meet with a 1:50.95 in the men’s 200 free. He finished comfortably in front of Gator Swim Club’s Nikita Denisyako (1:52.85) and his teammate, Nicholas Alexiou (1:53.42).\n\nCanadian Martha McCabe earned a tight victory over the Bolles’ Valentina Artemeva in the 100 breast, 1:11.54 to 1:11.64. Genevieve Robertson of Marlin Aquatics rounded out the top three in 1:12.19. In the men’s race, Club Wolverine earned another individual victory with Zachary Hayden taking first in 1:02.37. Anton Lobanov from Bolles got second in 1:03.28, well ahead of Azura Florida’s Alexander Morgan (1:06.43).\n\nTheresa Michalak, a German competing for the University of Florida and Gator Swim Club, took the women’s 100 fly crown by a narrow .15 over South Florida’s Alia Atkinson, 1:01.01 to 1:01.16. Danielle D’Aoust of Marlin Aquatics picked up her first top three finish of the meet with a 1:03.49. The men’s 100 fly title went to Bolles’ Mario Todorovic in 54.43. Fourteen-year-old Michael Andrew of Indie Swimming lowered the 13-14 boys’ National Age Group record in the event with a second place showing of 54.59. That lowered Justin Lynch’s 2011 record of 54.80, and Andrew’s previous best time of 54.98. Luke Torres of Gator Swim Club finished third in 55.00.\n\nMichalak picked up her second win of the night in convincing fashion, taking the 400 IM in 4:49.06. Canadian Vanessa Treasure finished seven seconds behind in 4:56.23, while Club Wolverine’s Emily Brunemann rounded out the top three in 4:56.28. The race for the men’s 400 IM title came down to the touch in an exciting race between Gator Swim Club’s Blake Manganiello and Blue Dolfins’ John Fulginiti. Fulginiti had a huge lead over Manganiello before Manganiello made it very interesting over the last 100, cutting Fulginiti’s lead from three seconds to two-tenths. Fulginiti held on to win, 4:37.66 to 4:37.89. Gator Swim Club’s Eric Stobbe took third in 4:38.17.\n\nSouth Florida claimed the women’s 800 free relay in 8:35.94, ahead of Blue Dolfins (8:50.06) and Pine Crest (8:56.82). Azura Florida took the men’s 800 free relay in 7:58.80, slightly ahead of Blue Dolfins’ 8:00.98. Azura Florida’s B relay took third in 8:01.34."
