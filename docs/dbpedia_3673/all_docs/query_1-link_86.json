        "text": "BASKETBALL\n\nDeng agrees with Heat\n\nFree agent forward Luol Deng agreed Sunday to a $20 million, two-year deal with the Miami Heat, said Herb Rudoy, one of Deng's agents. The deal includes a player option for the 2015-16 season, Rudoy said. Deng is entering his 11th NBA season, having spent almost his entire career with the Chicago Bulls. He appeared in 40 games with the Cleveland Cavaliers after a trade last season. He fills a need in Miami, which lost LeBron James last week after the four-time NBA MVP said he would leave the Heat after four seasons and return to the Cavaliers. Deng has averaged 16.0 points per game in his career, after being chosen No. 7 overall from Duke in the 2004 draft. His contract should be signed early this week.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nFour more all-stars added\n\nSan Francisco's Tim Hudson, Cincinnati's Alfredo Simon, San Diego's Huston Street and Washington's Tyler Clippard have been added to the roster for Tuesday's All-Star game at Target Field as the National League changed about one-third of its pitching staff. They replace a quartet of pitchers who started Sunday: the Giants' Madison Bumgarner, the Reds' Johnny Cueto, the Padres' Tyson Ross and the Atlanta Braves' Julio Teheran. Hudson, a four-time All-Star, is 7-6 with a 2.87 ERA, and Simon is 12-3 with a 2.70 ERA. Street has 24 saves and a 1.09 ERA, and Clippard is 6-2 with a 2.03 ERA in 43 relief appearances.\n\n• Dan Uggla's future in Atlanta was in question Sunday after the Braves suspended the struggling second baseman for their final game before the All-Star break. The team announced the suspension on its Twitter feed, with no further explanation. The 34-year-old Uggla has played sparingly since rookie Tommy La Stella was promoted from Triple-A Gwinnett on May 28. The three-time All-Star is batting .162 with 2 home runs and 10 RBI in 48 games.\n\n• Babe Ruth's 1918 contract with the Boston Red Sox has sold for more than $1 million, along with other baseball memorabilia up for auction in Baltimore. The contract was among about three dozen Ruth-related items up for auction Saturday night at the Sports Legends Museum a day after the 100th anniversary of Ruth's major league debut. Ruth was born in Baltimore. A spokesman for Goldin Auctions said a recently discovered Ruth bat from 1916 to 1918 sold for $214,000. But the first ball Ruth hit over the fence at Yankee Stadium did not reach the minimum price to sell. Among other items sold, a Mickey Mantle glove from 1965 to 1966 sold for $180,000. And a Roy Campanella MVP award sold for $180,000.\n\n• Jury selection is set to begin in a lawsuit against former major leaguer Jose Offerman for attacking another player with a baseball bat during a 2007 minor league game in Connecticut. Attorneys are scheduled to begin picking jurors Wednesday in Bridgeport federal court. Offerman is being sued by former minor league catcher Johnathan Nathans. Offerman was playing for the minor league Long Island Ducks in 2007 in a major league comeback bid when he was hit by a pitch, charged the mound and hit two Bridgeport Bluefish players with his bat including Nathans. Nathans suffered a head injury and sued Offerman and the Ducks for $4.8 million.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nAlabama DL Reed arrested\n\nPolice say Alabama defensive lineman Jarran Reed was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. Tuscaloosa police say Reed was stopped early Sunday after hitting another car while both backed out of parking spots. Police say Reed drove a 2011 Dodge Charger toward the parking lot's exit before he was pulled over. A police department news release said the 21-year-old junior college transfer's blood alcohol level registered as .13 percent. The legal limit in Alabama is .08 percent. Reed practiced with the Crimson Tide during the spring after transferring from East Mississippi Community College, along with fellow defensive lineman D.J. Pettway. Both are expected to contend for playing time.\n\n• Baltimore Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith became the fifth player on the team to be arrested during the offseason after he received a criminal citation Saturday night in Towson, Md., for failing to follow an officer's orders. The incident occurred after Baltimore County police were called to a Towson restaurant because a woman had reportedly passed out in the bathroom. Police arrived and found the woman throwing up into a sink in the bathroom. Police say Smith was with her and refused to obey an officer's repeated orders to leave the bathroom. Smith, 25, was cited late Saturday at a police precinct in Towson and then released. A Ravens spokesman said Sunday that the team is \"gathering information\" on the incident. Four other Ravens had encounters with the law this offseason. Running back Ray Rice was arrested for felony assault; offensive lineman Jah Reid was cited for felony aggravated assault; wide receiver Deonte Thompson was arrested for felony possession of marijuana; and running back Lorenzo Taliaferro was charged with misdemeanor destruction of property. Rice and Reid were accepted into a pretrial diversion program. Thompson had the charges dropped. Taliaferro has a court date scheduled for later this month. Smith started all 16 games for the Ravens last season. He had 58 tackles, 2 interceptions and forced 2 fumbles in his third NFL season.\n\nSWIMMING\n\nPhelps fails in 100 meters\n\nMichael Phelps was beaten by Yannick Agnel in the 100-meter freestyle at the Bulldog Grand Slam in Athens, Ga., on Sunday. Agnel, who won two gold medals for France at the 2012 London Olympics and trains with Phelps at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club, won with a time of 49.37 to Phelps' 49.42. Ryan Lochte won the 200 individual medley in 1:58.65, defeating Chase Kalisz (1:59.38). Allison Schmitt, a six-time Olympic medalist who won three golds at the London Games, won the women's 100 freestyle with a time of 54.64. Megan Romano was second in 54.93 and Amanda Weir was third in 55.17. In other events, Becca Mann won the women's 800 freestyle, Melanie Margalis took the women's 200 IM, Kylie Stewart the women's 200 backstroke, Michael Klueh the men's 1,500 freestyle and Tyler Clary the men's 200 backstroke.\n\nTENNIS\n\nHewitt breaks through\n\nAustralian Lleyton Hewitt won in his third time in the final match at the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport, R.I., beating second-seeded Ivo Karlovic of Croatia 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) on Sunday. The 33-year old Hewitt captured his 30th career ATP title in a match that lasted 2 hours, 30 minutes. Like last year, when he had a chance to serve out the match for the title, Hewitt was broken in the second set and then lost to Nicolas Mahut of France. This time, the third-seeded Hewitt closed it out on serve in the tiebreaker when Karlovic hit a forehand return long. American John Isner beat Hewitt in the 2012 final.\n\n• Pablo Cuevas defeated fifth-seeded Joao Sousa of Portugal 6-2, 6-1 in the Swedish Open final on Sunday at the Bastad Tennis Stadium. The 28-year-old Uruguayan, who has fought a serious knee injury for the past three years, won his first ATP tournament. He is currently ranked 111th. The 40th-ranked Sousa was chasing his second ATP title.\n\n• Top-seeded Simona Halep of Romania overpowered second-seeded Roberta Vinci to win the Bucharest Open final 6-1, 6-3 Sunday for her eighth WTA title. Halep, ranked third in the world, was more consistent from the start and easily took the first set. The 31-year-old Vinci lost her serve to trail 4-2 in the second before Halep won the final game to love and clinched the title in under 70 minutes. Halep now leads Vinci 4-2 in head-to-head meetings. The 22-year-old Halep is enjoying the best year of her career. She was runner-up in the French Open and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon.\n\nMOTOR SPORTS\n\nMarquez wins German GP\n\nMarc Marquez won the German Grand Prix at the Sachsenring for the fifth time in as many visits to make it nine victories from as many races in his MotoGP title defense. Marquez, at 21, is the youngest rider to win nine consecutive races. The Spaniard finished comfortably ahead of compatriots Dani Pedrosa and Jorge Lorenzo. Valentino Rossi of Movistar Yamaha MotoGP was fourth. The start of the race was disrupted by rain, and the podium finishers started from the pit lane after switching from a wet set-up to dry. Home favorite Stefan Bradl led the early laps but his bike was not set up for the drying conditions and the German rider finished a disappointing 16th. Marquez, who had claimed pole position, cut through the pack before pulling clear with Repsol Honda teammate Pedrosa, who ultimately finished 1.466 seconds behind. Lorenzo was 10.317 seconds off the winning time. Marquez stretched his lead in the standings to 225 points, ahead of Pedrosa on 148 and Rossi on 141.\n\nSports on 07/14/2014"
