        "text": "On Dec. 11, 1988, in St. Andrew, Jamaica, Alia Shanee Atkinson was born. Although the island is globally known for breeding some of the world’s fastest men and women on land, Atkinson’s parents took a different approach to sports. “Considering where I come from a lot of Jamaicans don’t know how to swim, so my parents thought it was necessary to have all their children know how to swim,” she said. Growing up, she was always around the water. “We all started swimming and we all just stuck with it.” By the time high school came around, Atkinson moved to the sunshine state of Florida to continue her swimming career, while attending Charles W. Flanagan in Pembroke Pines. Despite the initial adaptations the athlete made to her new American life – like getting used to the school system – Atkinson became a Flanagan Falcon and later joined their swim team, The Comets.\n\nShe competed at the 2004 Olympics and later in the 2008 Olympics, she finished 25th in the Women's 200 breaststroke. She carried the flag for her country at the opening ceremony of the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she set the Jamaican Record in the 100 fly. She also competed in the 2010 Commonwealth Games. She placed first in the 200 Breaststroke at the 2010 NCAA Championships, swimming for Texas A&M. She also qualified for the 2012 Olympics 100m women's breaststroke finals after defeating Canadian rival Tera van Beilenin in a head to head race for the final position. She then placed 4th in the finals of the 2012 Olympics 100m women's breaststroke finishing with a time of 1:06.93. Atkinson won the 100m breaststroke at the 2014 Short Course World Championships in Doha becoming the first black woman to win a world swimming title."
