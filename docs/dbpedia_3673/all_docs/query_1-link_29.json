        "text": "Indiana University waited 40 years to place one swimmer on the U.S. Olympic team. The Hoosiers might wait 24 hours for a second.\n\nCody Miller, born with a deformity that diminishes his lung capacity, finished second in the men’s 100-meter breaststroke Monday night in the U.S. Olympic Trials at Omaha, Neb.\n\nThat secured the IU graduate’s spot on the team heading to Rio de Janeiro. The Hoosiers also had had the fastest qualifier in the women’s 100 breaststroke,19-year-old Lilly King.\n\nKevin Cordes took the men’s race in 59.18. Miller, fourth after 50 meters, finished fast to post 59.26. The top two make the Olympics.\n\n“I’ve had a lot of closing speed this meet, so I was really focused on trying to hammer that last 20 meters and try and get my hand on the wall,” Miller said in IU news release. “I got the job done, got on the team and just trying to soak it in right now. It’s very surreal.”\n\nThe Hoosiers had four swimmers on the U.S. team at Montreal in 1976: Jim Montgomery, Gary Hall, Charlie Keating and Jennifer Hooker. Montgomery won a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle, becoming the first man under 50 seconds.\n\n“Very few people we have coached train harder with more passion and determination than Cody,” Indiana coach Ray Looze said. “His meaning to our program is immeasurable and we’re so happy for his family and the Hoosier nation on such an outstanding accomplishment.”\n\nMiller, 24, grew up in Las Vegas as the son of a single mother. She could not swim and wanted to be sure her son could. He learned to swim early, and the sport helped broaden his chest and develop his rib cage.\n\nHe was diagnosed with pectus excavatum, or a sunken-in chest. Sometimes surgery is performed on those with the condition, but Miller never had that done. Most breaststrokers are 6-3 to 6-5, and he is 5-10.\n\n“Every kid dreams of this and the fact that I’m not very big and have a lot of disadvantages, it’s unbelievable that I’m here to do this,” Miller said.\n\nIn semifinals of the women’s 100 breaststroke, King won her semifinal in 1:05.94 and was fastest overall. Molly Hannis won the other semifinal in 1:06.24.\n\nGetting the last of eight spots for Tuesday’s final was Miranda Tucker, who has left the IU program. As a freshman this year, she was second to King in the NCAA 200-yard breaststroke.\n\n“I took it out a little fast, but other than that, I’m happy with the time and to be qualified first,” said King, who won two NCAA titles in March.\n\nIn another final, Amy Bilquist will try to become the first ever to make the Olympics out of Carmel’s long-dominant swim program. The 18-year-old graduated from Carmel High School last year and just completed her freshman year at University of California.\n\nShe won her semifinal of the 100 backstroke in 59.85 and is seeded No. 3 behind Olivia Smoliga, 59.16, and Kathleen Baker, 59.36. Georgia’s Smoliga is the NCAA champion in the 50- and 100-yard freestyles. Olympic gold medalists Missy Franklin and Natalie Coughlin barely made the final as the No. 7 and 8 qualifiers.\n\nBilquist had the No. 2 time of prelims, 59.67. Coincidentally, she was in a lane adjacent to former Carmel teammate Claire Adams, whose Olympic quest was over almost before it began.\n\nAdams, 17, broke her hand Tuesday. She swam anyway and was 46th overall in 1:02.46. She set a world junior (under-18) record of 59.58 in winning a national title last summer and was the No. 4 seed.\n\nIn another semifinal, IU’s Blake Pieroni was 12th overall in the men’s 200 freestyle in 1:48.44, missing the cut to eight. He qualified for semifinals with the No. 7 time, 1:47.93. This was his best shot to make the Olympic team because top six are customarily selected for the 800 freestyle relay.\n\nEvansville native Michael Klueh, 29, was 10th in 1:48.14. Zane Grothe, who trains with the IU team, was 16th in 1:50.24.\n\nMaxime Rooney, 18, whose world junior record is 1:47.10, was ninth in 1:47.98.\n\nCarmel Swim Club’s Drew Kibler was 33rd in prelims in 1:50.01 – fastest in the nation by a 16-year-old this year. He came to Omaha seeded 48th.\n\nRooney and Kibler should be selected to the U.S. team for the Junior Pan Pacific Championships, set for Aug. 24-27 at Kihei, Hawaii.\n\nLedecky makes team, misses record\n\nKatie Ledecky earned her first spot for Rio, winning the the 400 freestyle in 3:58.98, third-fastest time in history. Leah Smith claiming an Olympic berth by finishing in 4:00.65. IU graduate Lindsay Vrooman was fourth in 4:08.99.\n\nKelsi Worrell became the University of Louisville’s first Olympic swimmer, winning the 100 butterfly in 56.48. Dana Vollmer, 28, a four-time gold medalist who gave birth to her first child 16 months ago, was second in 57.21.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter David Woods at (317) 444-6195.
