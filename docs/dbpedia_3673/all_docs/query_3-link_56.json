        "text": "People in six states across the country, including Indiana, now have confirmed cases of meningitis.\n\nThose cases are linked to steroid back injections contaminated with a type of fungus, and several people in the Tri-State may be affected.\n\nOfficials at the Vanderburgh County Health Department say they're in the process of notifying all the physicians in town who may have administered that injection. It's a situation doctors say they're not taking lightly.\n\n\"We are in the process of notifying all 560 patients,\" said Chief Risk Officer at St. Mary's Michael Klueh.\n\nSt. Mary's Medical Center Officials say more than 5,000 of their patients may have received back injections from the lot of recalled steroid solution, 10 of them exhibiting symptoms of meningitis.\n\n\"We just want to make sure we stay ahead of the curve and are proactive getting the word out,\" Klueh said.\n\nDoctors tell 14 News, this type of contamination is rare, but serious.\n\nThursday afternoon, federal officials report 35 meningitis cases in six states, five cases resulting in death.\n\nThe symptoms to look out for? \"Unusual headache that's getting worse or a fever, stiff neck,\" said Vanderburgh County Health Officer Dr. Ray Nicholson.\n\nThe contaminated lots came from the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nSt. Mary's says those injections were administered at their Surgicare facility. They tell us, doctors are still giving injections, but from a different manufacturer.\n\n\"It's medically appropriate for chronic pain patients in this case and this should not deter them from seeking the appropriate treatment,\" said Klueh.\n\nThe health department says that form of steroid injection can also be given for inflammation in areas like the shoulder or knee.\n\nAnd while infection of those areas won't lead to meningitis, doctors say you should still seek treatment.\n\nHealth officials say this type of meningitis is not spread from person to person. They say it can be treated with an anti-fungal.\n\nFYI: If you know the lot number of your medicine we do know the numbers of the recalled product.\n\nMethylprednisolone Acetate 80 mg injections-\n\nLot #05212012@68 (Before Use Date-11/17/2012)\n\n#06292012@26 (BUD-12/26/2012)\n\n#08102012@51 (BUD 2/6/2013)"
