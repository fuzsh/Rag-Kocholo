(Canham Natatorium)\n\nScores: Michigan 183, Texas 170; Michigan 237, Louisville 116; Michigan 242.50, Indiana 110.50\n\nRecords: U-M (4-0, 1-0 B1G), Indiana (2-2, 0-1 B1G), Louisville (1-3), Texas (3-1)\n\nNext U-M Event: Saturday, Nov. 1 -- host Alumni/Intrasquad Meet (Canham Natatorium), 10:30 a.m.\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. -- With the meet's results in the balance, the University of Michigan men's swimming and diving team won the 400-yard freestyle relay to clinch a victory over Texas (183-170) while also defeating Louisville (237-116) and Indiana (242.50-110.50) on Saturday (Oct. 25) at Canham Natatorium. Following senior Justin Glanda, junior Anders Nielsen and freshman Paul Powers, senior Bruno Ortiz held off a late Texas charge to touch the wall first at 2:55.47, securing the win over the second-place Longhorns (2:56.12).\n\nIn addition to the 400-yard freestyle relay team, U-M owned the top two spots in the 200-yard medley relay. The 'A' team of freshman Aaron Whitaker, Ortiz, junior Dylan Bosch and Powers clocked in first (1:26.96), with Powers splitting at 19.39 down the final 50 yards of freestyle. The 'B' team was right behind, as the quartet of junior Peter Brumm, senior Richard Funk, senior/junior Jeremy Raisky and sophomore Vinny Tafuto were second (1:27.45). The next closest relay was Indiana, timed at 1:29.05.\n\nThe Wolverines only had two wins on the day -- both on those relays -- but it was the depth that was essential to their victories. U-M was paced by a pair of third-place finishes in the early going, freshman Tristan Sanders in the 200-yard backstroke (1:46.45) and Glanda in the 100-yard freestyle (44.31). Before the first break, Funk collected a second-place finish in the 200-yard breaststroke (1:58.80).\n\nIn the 500-yard freestyle, the Wolverines collected three of the top five spots, with Anders Nielsen in second (4:26.37), Glanda in fourth (4:29.51) and freshman PJ Ransford in fifth (4:29.74). Then, in the 100-yard butterfly, Brumm had a neck-and-neck race with Texas' Joseph Schooling (an Olympian in 2012 for Singapore), missing first place by just one hundredth-of-a-second (47.93). Whitaker was right behind in third (47.96). The Longhorns stole another race, as Will Licon out-touched Bosch by two tenths-of-a-second to win the 400-yard individual medley. Bosch was clocked in at 3:50.69.\n\nOn the diving boards, sophomore Ryan O'Donnell scored a team-best finish on the three-meter (279.20). Following him were seniors Thomas Jahnke in 10th (277.15) and Kevin Bain in 11th (267.90).\n\nThe Wolverines are back in the pool at Canham Natatorium next Saturday (Nov. 1) for their annual alumni/intrasquad meet as part of Homecoming weekend. That will begin at 10:30 a.m. The team's next official competition is Friday, Nov. 7, and Saturday, Nov. 8, when it faces Penn State and Virginia in State College, Pa.\n\nPOST-GRADAUTE RACES\n\n100-yard Breaststroke\n\nCody Miller (Bloomington Swim Club) -- 52.84\n\nCarlos Almeida (Cardinal Aquatics) -- 54.26\n\n200-yard Backstroke\n\nJames Wells (Bloomington Swim Club) -- 1:42.90\n\nPedro Oliveira (Cardinal Aquatics) -- 1:43.63\n\n100-yard Freestyle\n\nJoao De Lucca (Cardinal Aquatics) -- 42.60\n\nJunya Koga (Club Wolverine) -- 43.81\n\nHassaan Abdel Khalik (Club Wolverine) -- 44.66\n\nMichael Wynalda (Club Wolverine) -- 44.67\n\nKyle Whitaker (Club Wolverine) -- 47.65\n\n1,000-yard Freestyle\n\nConnor Jaeger (Club Wolverine) -- 8:41.09\n\nMichael McBroom (The Woodlands Swim Club) -- 8:57.04\n\nMichael Klueh (Club Wolverine) -- 8:57.59\n\n Day 1 Results"
