Being every inch the supportive wife, Elsa Pataky headed to the Avengers: Endgame premiere last night to show her support to husband Chris Hemsworth.

And Elsa certainly stole the show, as she put on a seriously sizzling display.

The mum-of-three looked a vision as she posed up a storm next to her husband on the purple carpet.

Elsa looked sensational as she donned a floaty white jumpsuit, which had major ethereal vibes.

But sure to bring her signature sex appeal, the all-in-one ensemble featured a plunging neckline, which teased at her ample cleavage.

The halter-neck design also meant the outfit was completely backless, showing off her bronzed skin.

She styled her beachy blonde locks into voluminous curls, which were pulled to one side, showing off her gold dangly earrings.

She kept her makeup understated apart from a slick of burgundy across her plump pout.

Chris meanwhile looked ultra dapper in a blue Jacquard print suit, which he paired with a skinny black tie.

Elsa and Chris, 35, have been married since 2010.

The duo share three children â€“ a daughter, six, and twin boys, four.

Last year, the pair starred opposite each other in movie 12 Strong.

Chris and Elsa's high-adrenaline movie told the story of the first Special Forces team that were sent to Iraq following the events of 9/11.
