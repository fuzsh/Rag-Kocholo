Elsa Pataky and Chris Hemsworth have welcomed a new member to their family.

On Thursday, the Spanish actress introduced a dark grey horse to her daughter India, 7, in Byron Bay, after adopting the animal.

Elsa, who is also talented equestrian rider, has been teaching her eldest child how to ride over the past few years.

Elsa married Thor star Chris in 2010, and the couple live in Byron Bay with their children: daughter India Rose, seven, and twins Tristan and Sasha, five.

'Our new member of the herd,' Elsa wrote alongside a picture of the horse on Instagram, also adding a secondary Spanish caption which translated in English to 'our new family member'.

Elsa has previously posted about owning a horse named Chester, but it's unclear if the family own more.

The beauty has shared photos and videos of the family with horses in the past, including sunset rides with her daughter along the beach in Byron Bay.

They also have a pet dog, Sunny.

The family relocated to the coastal town in 2014, after previously living in Los Angeles.

They are due to move into their new $20million Byron Bay 'mega mansion' in the coming months, after almost three years of construction and renovations.

In the meantime, they have been renting another home nearby as they await completion on their property.

Elsa previously said that the family decided to move to Australia for the quieter, more laid back lifestyle.

'In Byron we just feel like locals. People really respect us... and it's what I always dreamt of giving to my kids.'
