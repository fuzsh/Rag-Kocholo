Chris Hemsworth's wife Elsa Pataky has spoken candidly about growing up in Madrid.

The 44-year-old told Jones magazine that her childhood 'wasn't the happiest' but she refuses to be sad about it.

'I'm probably overpositive. I think it's because my childhood wasn't the happiest and you can either be sad about it or you can try to make the best of it,' Elsa said.

'And I decided in life that I just wanted to get the best of it. In any situation, I'm trying to always turn negative into positive and make things look better.'

She continued: 'But at the same time, I'm very passionate and I want things to be my way. I'm stubborn and I will make it happen.'

Elsa married her husband Chris 10 years ago, and the power couple reside in a $20 million mansion in Byron Bay, on the New South Wales north coast.

The property offers plenty of room for Chris and Elsa's children - daughter India Rose eight, and twin sons Tristan and Sasha, six.

Last year, Chris admitted that he moved his family to Australia in 2014 after feeling 'suffocated' by his career while living in Los Angeles.

'Living in Australia, it's easier to detach myself from work and you get a bit more leeway to let a few emails and phone calls slide on by,' he said.

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, the star said he grew tired of constantly being surrounded by billboards of himself and never switching off from his projects.

The father added: 'There's not a single person there (Byron Bay) that I interact with, or close friends of mine, that are really in the industry and that's hugely refreshing.'

Similarly, speaking to OK! Magazine earlier that year, Chris said living in Hollywood meant 'you just kind of lose touch with reality'.
