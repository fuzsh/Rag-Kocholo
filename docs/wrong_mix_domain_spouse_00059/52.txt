Elsa Pataky has taken to Instagram to mark husband Chris Hemsworth's birthday by sharing a new behind-the-scenes photo from the set of Thor: Love and Thunder.

In the Marvel Studios sequel, Pataky made a (very) brief cameo as the Wolf Woman the God of Thunder hooks up with... while sitting on a giant wolf.

The model-turned-actress also appeared as a Sakaaran Nurse in Thor: Ragnarok, and stood in for Natalie Portman in the post-credits scene of Thor: The Dark World.

"Happy birthday to my favourite parrot trainer, kids handler and wife tamer," she captioned her post. "There’s nothing you can’t do. We love you to the moon and back."

This black-and-white shot gives us a much better look at Pataky's wolf-like makeup as she rehearses her scene with Hemsworth.

Love and Thunder proved to be fairly divisive (at 65%, it's the lowest-rated Thor movie on Rotten Tomatoes), but recently managed to beat Ragnarok's domestic box office haul, and has now passed $700 million worldwide.

Thor: Love and Thunder finds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey unlike anything he’s ever faced – a quest for inner peace. But his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who – to Thor’s surprise – inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor.

Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher’s vengeance and stop him before it’s too late.
