        "text": "Chris Hemsworth just made his Met Gala 2024 debut, and even though this is his first one ever, his fit has already stolen the show (and all of our hearts). Arriving on the red cream carpet with his wife Elsa Pataky, the Australian actor and Met Gala co-chair rocked up in a three-piece suit, all courtesy of Tom Ford.\n\nUp top, the Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga star wore a silky off-white shirt (with the top few buttons undone, of course, because that's what heartbreakers do). He layered this with a waistcoat, and his jacket featured incredibly fanged out peak lapels. It's textbook Tom Ford, really, and even though Hemsworth decided to wear it sans tie, it still had what it takes to be one of the most memorable Met Gala looks of the evening. In fact, it's exactly the kinda thing one should wear for an intense 48-hour love affair in a five star hotel. A modern day Prince Charming, if you will, which is perfectly in line with this year's ‘Sleeping Beauties’ theme. Clever!\n\nBut it wasn't just his suit that had every Twitter Met Gala critic gassed up. He was also kitted out in lots and lots of bling. You'll find a long chain around his neck. You'll find some shiny rings on pretty much every single finger. And on his left wrist, you'll find a Chopard Alpine Eagle. We all knew he was a watch guy, but this is exactly what a holy grail looks like. And if it's your first Met ever, of course you're going to pull out the big guns.\n\nIt's one part Aussie hunk, one part Greek god, 100 percent Chris Hemsworth."
