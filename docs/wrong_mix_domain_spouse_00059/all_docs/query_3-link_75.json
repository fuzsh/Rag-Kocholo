        "text": "By: John M Jerva\n\nThe Hemsworth household is representing action cinema quite nicely this year as Chris is giving us Thor: Love and Thunder as well as the highly anticipated sequel to Extraction. Not to be outdone by her husband, Elsa Pataky of the Fast and Furious franchise is delivering a little one-woman war machine action all her own in the upcoming Netflix actioner Interceptor. Pataky is the last line of defense when ruthless mercenaries take over an interceptor platform which is our last line of defense against a nuclear strike, and we now have first look footage for you as Netflix has released an official trailer featuring Pataky kicking all kinds of merc ass. Take a look below along with eye catching new key art!\n\nStarring along with Pataky are Starring alongside Pataky is Luke Bracey, Aaron Glenane, Mayen Mehta, Rhys Muldoon, Belinda Jombwe, Marcus Johnson, Colin Friels, and Zoe Carides. The film comes from first time director Matthew Reilly who is an Australian born author. Reilly also co-wrote the script.\n\nThere’s no shortage of action set pieces and stunts as Pataky makes action cinema proud as she takes on numerous men twice her size and does it with gusto and neck breaking hand to hand dominance. Say what you will about female centric action films, but it doesn’t matter what gender you are because anyone and everyone is equipped to have a deadly skill set. I’m all in as long as they’re done well, and things blow up and bullets slice through the air while people get punched and kicked in the face. The only people who complain about action films with a female lead are single guys who can’t get a date for some strange reason. Hmmmmm. Change my mind, I dare you."
