        "text": "The coronavirus lockdown even gets to \"Thor\" star Chris Hemsworth, who is quarantining with his family in Australia.\n\nHemsworth tells Australian GQ that he feels blessed and \"fortunate\" during the downtime caused by the global shutdown. It's also an opportunity to spend precious time with his twin sons, Sasha and Tristan, 6, and daughter, India Rose, 8 – whom he shares with actress wife Elsa Pataky.\n\nBut Hemsworth, 36, starring in the Netflix film \"Extraction,\" admits the uncertain time is daunting.\n\n“It’s probably the first time in about 10 years that I don’t know what I’m doing for the next six months,” says Hemsworth. “I don’t have it all mapped out. To some degree, it’s nice not to have a schedule, but the unknown and the uncertainty is intimidating.”\n\nThe star is spending time \"attempting to home school the kids, which is a feat in itself,\" he says. \"They’re better students than I am a teacher, to be honest.”\n\nIn addition to the quality family moments, the time has given Hemsworth the opportunity to think about life in a Hollywood career that has moved at breakneck speed since he appeared in 2011's \"Thor.\"\n\n\"I’ve spent probably 15 years in what felt like a marathon, a constant workload,” he says. \"I’ve been constantly trying to find the balance. I’ve really yearned for more stillness and felt a definite need to slow down. Not having a schedule in front of me has made me reposition my values and what’s important, and I think most people are having those kinds of thoughts right now.\"\n\nEspecially with the children, being away from home on long movie shoots during normal times has become more and more difficult for Hemsworth.\n\n“Every job I’d take, every time I’d go off on these extended trips, it got harder and harder. For a little while you don’t think the kids notice and then you realize they do,\" he says. \"I absolutely want to continue to make films that I’m proud of, but that can also wait. Now what’s more important is my kids are at an age I don’t want to miss. And I’d hate to look back in 20 years and go, ‘Right, let’s get to work as a parent’ and I’ve missed it all.\"\n\nHemsworth now gets the opportunity to have his growing children watch his movies, even if he doesn't get the star treatment at home.\n\n\"I get a kick out of it when they actually enjoy my movies,\" he says. \"But there’s also an equal share of eye-rolls – I couldn’t be less cool in their eyes. It’s nature’s way of telling me the truth. You can fall into a false sense of self-importance on a film set, where you feel you’re special, so it’s good to remind yourself that it’s not the case. And kids certainly drive that home.\""
