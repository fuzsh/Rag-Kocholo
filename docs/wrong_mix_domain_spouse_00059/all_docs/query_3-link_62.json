        "text": "He's one of the world's biggest movie stars but Chris Hemsworth certainly hasn't let fame go to his head. When the Australian star visited the set of Home and Away the show that gave him his first break, he decided to appear in one scene as an extra for old times' sake.\n\nFans will have to be very attentive to spot the Avengers star when the episode airs on Tuesday. In the scene 31-year-old Chris is seen very briefly in the Summer Bay diner, eating a meal dressed in an understated grey T-shirt and cap as actresses Jessica Grace-Smith (Denny Miller), Cassie Howarth (Hannah Wilson) and Isabella Giovinazzo (Phoebe Nicholson) have a heart-to-heart.\n\nChris Hemsworth made a cameo on Australian TV show Home and Away\n\nChris, who played Kim Hyde from 2004 to 2007, caused excitement when he showed up to chat with the actors last year. Jessica shared a picture of herself with the Hollywood hunk on her Instagram page, joking to followers that it was \"Just another tough day at work\".\n\nSince making it big in Tinseltown the heart-throb has gone back to his roots in more ways than one. He recently decided to move back to Australia with his wife Elsa Pataky and their three children, India, and twin boys Tristan and Sasha. He says he has no regrets on returning home to raise his family.\n\n\"It's the first time in years I've felt like I have a home again,\" he told Australia's Daily Telegraph. \"For ten years, I've had no base and led a pretty nomadic existence. Since we moved back, I feel much more grounded, and I like that.\"\n\nThe Hemsworths now live in the coastal town of Byron Bay, which Elsa has revealed has a hippy vibe to the extent that she sometimes goes barefoot when out and about.\n\nChris added: \"We were living in California and it just wasn't conducive for the lifestyle that we wanted with kids.\n\n\"Los Angeles is tricky to get around, there's paparazzi to deal with, and I had this feeling that I just wanted to move back to Australia.\n\n\"My wife loves it. And I thought that's where I want my kids to grow up â€“ that's the world I want them to be a part of, because that part of the world is such a special place.\""
