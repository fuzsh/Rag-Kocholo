        "text": "Chris Hemsworth is working the demigod dance skills, as his hilarious salsa lesson birthday present to wife Elsa Pataky demonstrates.\n\nThe Thor star gave Pataky, who turned 42 Wednesday, a wild demonstration lacking in any skill. But he more than made up for it with goofy heart, posting the scene on Instagram.\n\n\"Gave my wife a dance lesson for her birthday, I should've given myself one too,\" Hemsworth wrote in the caption of the blooper-esque video. \"Happy Birthday love.\"\n\nUndaunted, he added the hashtags #danceismylfe #salsa4life.\n\nHemsworth has also gone viral showing off his poor dancing skills to Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\" with the couple's children â€” an effort so bad it led to his own dog attacking him.\n\nMore: Chris Hemsworth goes into '12 Strong' battle pondering Thor's future\n\nWhatever, the salsa skills worked on Pataky, the actress originally from Madrid, Spain. She posted a selfie on her own Instagram with Hemsworth goofy-slobbering over her.\n\n\"Best birthday ever, with all the people I love, especially this one, always making me laugh,\" she wrote.\n\nThen she posted another video of the two pulling wine from a barrel, switching glasses mid-stream to perfection.\n\n\"Great team, not a drop spilled,\" she wrote. \"Got your back baby!!\""
