        "text": "Thor action star Chris Hemsworth has sent fans into a spin after it was revealed in a wholesome fishing video that one of his sons doesn’t call him ‘Dad’.\n\nThe Aussie heartthrob is currently living it up in Fiji at the Tavarua Island Resort for a pre-Christmas vacation with his actress wife Elsa Pataky and their three kids — daughter India, 11, and twin sons Tristan and Sasha, 9.\n\nAmong the many activities they’ve been up to was a day out on the water in search of a whopping big fish. And, they got one.\n\n“My son wanted to catch a fish for the locals in Fiji and after 3 attempts and about 12 hrs at sea, we pulled in this beauty. Fed the village for 3 days,” Hemsworth posted to Instagram, alongside a series of striking photographs of the giant swordfish and videos of the catch. And, of course, a couple of snaps showing off his bulging biceps...\n\nWhile the fish was impressive, Hemsworth’s followers were reeled into another part of the short clip.\n\nThey noticed that his son Tristan didn’t call him ‘Dad’ when he was encouraging him to reel in the massive fish.\n\n“C’mon, Chris, c’mon, keep on fighting it,” Tristan can be heard saying, and Hemsworth replies, “I’m fighting, bro.”\n\nAfter one fan questioned, “Why is his son calling him Chris 🤔,” a flood of comments followed, sparking debate about whether it’s just an “Aussie thing” or if it’s “disrespectful”.\n\nOne fan replied, “My 5-year-old daughter calls her dad by his name, most of the time, I call my mum and dad by there (sic) names, might be an Aussie thing 🤷‍♀️.”\n\n“Yep, it’s an Aussie thing. My kids do it all the time. I tell them off, but they just laugh,” added a follower.\n\n“It’s an Aussie thing, I guess. Many of us do that,” another fan posted.\n\nBut some weren’t so sure about it.\n\n“Disrespect calling your father by his name at that age. I have always heard Chris call his father dad,” one fan argued.\n\n“Nah, the son calling his dad by Chris is weird and not BFF behaviour,” wrote another.\n\nBut despite what fans may think, Hemsworth reassured his 58.5 million followers and the person who posed the question that he and his son were the best of mates.\n\n“Ps if your (sic) wondering why my son calls me Chris, it’s because I’m his BFF and true mates don’t call each other dad, @tavaruaislandresort,” Hemsworth wrote.\n\nIn a separate post, Hemsworth and his family can be seen enjoying a meal with the locals and having a dance afterwards.\n\nPataky also took to Instagram to share photos of the stunning holiday, showing the family enjoying the crystal clear Fijian waters snorkelling and surfing, riding trikes on the beach, and soaking up glorious sunsets.\n\nHemsworth seems to enjoy a fishing trip, back in October he and his daughter Indi jetted off to Iceland for some quality time together. Hemsworth posted pictures of the duo enjoying a day of fishing, with the caption, “dinner sorted, thanks Indi”."
