The LA-based jewelry designer, who has been linked to the Oscar-winner since last November, opted to sunbathe topless with a blue patterned sarong around her waist.\n\nRamon, who was previously married to \"The Vampire Diaries\" star Paul Wesley, was recently spotted out wearing a gold \"B\" initial necklace, with a source telling Entertainment Tonight that the couple are still \"seeing each other and having fun.\"\n\n\"They enjoy each other’s company and have similar interests,\" the insider added. \"They’re both creative, like to travel, and are happy being low-key. Things are good between them, but Brad isn't rushing anything.\"\n\n\"Brad is very careful and intentional about who he dates,\" the source noted. \"He likes to ease into things and let things grow naturally.\"\n\nBRAD PITT SUNBATHES WITH TOPLESS GIRLFRIEND INES DE RAMON IN MEXICO AMID ‘SEMI-RETIREMENT’ PLANS\n\nMeanwhile, Pitt has been locked in an intense legal battle with his ex-wife Angelina Jolie over the couple’s former French vineyard, Château Miraval.\n\nPitt and Jolie, 48, were married for two years before the actress filed for divorce in 2016.

In June 2017, Clooney and Amal welcomed twins Alexander and Ella.\n\nGEORGE CLOONEY ON WHY HE WON'T LET AMAL WATCH 'BATMAN & ROBIN': ‘I WANT MY WIFE TO HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR ME'\n\n\"Listen, I didn't want to get married; I didn't want to have kids,\" Clooney said during an appearance on the \"WTF With Marc Maron\" podcast in November 2021. \"And then this extraordinary human being walked into my life, and I just fell madly in love.\"\n\nThe \"Syriana\" star went on to describe his wife as \"the most extraordinary, smart, brilliant, beautiful woman\" he's ever met, and said he \"couldn't be happier.\"\n\n\"It is a joy beyond anything I could ever have imagined,\" Amal told Elle in 2022 of her marriage to Clooney. \"I feel so lucky to have found a great love in my life, and to be a mother — this is how I get my balance.\"\n\nBen Affleck flashes abs\n\nBen Affleck's wife Jennifer Lopez showed off her husband's impressive physique in a Father's Day tribute that she posted in June.\n\nThe 50-year-old Oscar winner was seen shirtless with his toned abs on full display in a mirror selfie that the 53-year-old star shared on Instagram.\n\nAPP USERS CLICK HERE\n\n\"Daddy Appreciation Post.
