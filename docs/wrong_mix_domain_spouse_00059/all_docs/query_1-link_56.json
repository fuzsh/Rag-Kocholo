        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nWarning: There are major spoilers ahead for \"Thor: Love and Thunder.\"\n\nInsider rounds up callbacks to Marvel films, comics, and other details you might have missed.\n\n\"Thor 4\" has cameos from Chris Hemsworth's family members and references to the Infinity saga.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGorr the God Butcher wields the Necromancer, a powerful sword that corrupts its wielder.\n\nThere have been a few different versions of the Necrosword in the comics that have been wielded by Malekith (the \"Thor: The Dark World\" villain), Eddie Brock, and Galactus. ln the source comics, Thor sent the Necrosword into a black hole.\n\nIn \"Love and Thunder,\" Thor explains the Necrosword simply as a weapon that can kill a god. It's been passed around since the dawn of time and infects the wielder. It's unclear if the sword gives Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) immortality, too.\n\nGorr's first kill with the Necrosword is a god named Rapu, played by \"What We Do in the Shadows\" star Jonny Brugh.\n\nBrugh and \"Thor 4\" director Taika Waititi previously worked together in the mockumentary FX series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Hemsworth's son, Tristan, plays a young version of Thor in the montage of him growing up.\n\nThe scene occurs early in the movie, as Korg (voiced by director Waititi) tells the story of how Thor went from a baby to one of the greatest superheroes.\n\nHemsworth has 8-year-old twin sons named Tristan and Sasha that he shares with his wife, actress Elsa Pataky.\n\nHemsworth confirmed the cameo in a recent interview with reporter Kevin McCarthy.\n\nThe actor also revealed that he's not the only cast member whose kids appeared in the movie. Waititi as well as costars Christian Bale and Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) all had their children in the film.\n\nTheir kids play the Asgardian kids that Gorr captures in the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHemsworth's 10-year-old daughter India Rose plays Love, Gorr's daughter.\n\nHemsworth's character becomes Uncle Thor to the girl and raises her following the death of Gorr near the end of the movie.\n\n\"It was really cool,\" Hemsworth told McCarthy of having his kids in the movie. \"They really wanted to be in it.\"\n\n\"It felt like a one-off fun family experience,\" he added. \"I don't want them to now go and be child stars and actors. It was just a special experience we all had.\"\n\n\"They had a great time,\" Hemsworth said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsa Pataky, Hemsworth's wife, appears as a woman who passionately kisses Thor atop a giant wolf.\n\nThe scene occurs early in the film, as Korg recaps some of Thor's past love interests, including Pataky's character, a pirate, and Jane.\n\nThis isn't the first time Pataky has shared an on-screen kiss with Hemsworth, who she married in 2010.\n\nThe \"Fast and Furious\" star previously served as Portman's stand-in for a kissing scene between Thor and Jane in \"Thor: The Dark World.\"\n\nZia Kelly, Portman's stunt double in \"Thor 4,\" plays a swashbuckling pirate.\n\nShe and Thor kiss on a boat in the montage narrated by Korg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThor wears a hat that says \"World's Strongest Avenger\" while working out.\n\nThor wears the hat during a montage that shows him getting into shape and going from \"dad bod\" to \"god bod.\"\n\nThe phrase is designed in the original Avengers font from the comics and is also a callback to a fan-favorite scene from \"Thor: Ragnarok.\"\n\nThor's tank top is a nod to Norse mythology.\n\nThe white shirt has the Yggdrasil on it, which is a sacred tree that's surrounded by the Nine Realms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a callback to the first \"Thor\" film, Jane references the Einstein-Rosen Bridge to another patient in the chemo ward.\n\nWhile at the hospital doing chemotherapy, she notices the person sitting next to her reading her book on space and time. Jane ruins her own book by tearing the pages out and putting a pen through them to explain wormholes to him.\n\nIn the first \"Thor\" movie released in 2011, Jane's knowledge of astrophysics helped her to realize that the Bifrost Bridge, which allows for travel among the Nine Realms, is the theoretical Einstein-Rosen Bridge wormhole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAstrophysicist Erik Selvig video chats with Jane while she's at the lab.\n\nIn \"Love and Thunder,\" Erik (Stellan Skarsgård) tells Jane that unfortunately, the latest test results regarding her stage 4 cancer haven't shown any changes.\n\nErik was first introduced in \"Thor.\" He returned for \"The Avengers,\" \"Thor: The Dark World,\" and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\"\n\nErik was one of the people who disappeared when Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers and wiped out half of all life in the universe in \"Infinity War.\"\n\nErik, along with the others who were dusted, came back to life after the Avengers defeated the Mad Titan in \"Avengers: Endgame.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew Asgard has an ice cream shop called Infinity Conez.\n\nNew Asgard has been turned into a tourist destination complete with nods to Marvel's Infinity saga. The ice cream shop's name is a play on the six infinity stones and King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is seen cutting the ribbon for the grand opening.\n\nThe character Darryl Jacobs from Waitit's \"Team Thor\" shorts has a cameo as a tour guide in New Asgard.\n\nThe mockumentary showed what Thor was up to between \"Captain America: Civil War\" and \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" Daley Pearson portrayed Thor's roommate in the Marvel shorts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Quill/Star-Lord references Gamora when he tells Thor he experienced love but it was \"taken away.\"\n\nIn \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" Thanos sacrificed his daughter Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) so that he could acquire the Soul Stone.\n\nHowever, there's still another version of Gamora out in the world. An earlier version of her, from before she met Peter and the Guardians of the Galaxy, was brought into the current MCU timeline in \"Avengers: Endgame.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuke Hemsworth, Matt Damon, Sam Neill, and Melissa McCarthy act out scenes from \"Thor: Ragnarok.\"\n\nThey reenact Odin's death scene and Hela'a first encounter with Thor and Loki in \"Ragnarok.\"\n\nHemsworth and Damon are even dressed in outfits that are similar to the ones Thor and Loki wear when they travel to Earth to find their father, suggesting that Thor or someone else weighed in on the play,\n\nThe last fictional play was approved by Loki, but he was killed in \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcCarthy's real-life husband, Ben Falcone, has a cameo as an Asgardian stage manager.\n\nHe bows on stage with Damon, Hemsworth, Neill, and McCarthy when they finish their play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA shot of Thor and Korg overlooking a fallen god is a near-perfect recreation of a panel from the comics.\n\nAfter a distress signal from Thor's friend Sif (Jaimie Alexander) about Gorr's murder spree, he and Korg travel to the wintry climate to investigate the death of Falligar the Behemoth.\n\nA similar visual, with Thor standing solo, appears in writer Jason Aaron and artist Esad Ribic's \"Thor\" run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThor has Nick Fury's name stored in his cell phone as Nick Furry.\n\nIn a flashback to a rocky portion of his relationship with Jane, Thor receives a call from Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and ditches a meal with Jane to see what's up.\n\nThor says that the last time he saw Jane was eight years, seven months, and six days ago, giving a vague hint at when this film takes place.\n\nIf we're to believe that the last time Jane and Thor saw each another was 2015's \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" where Jane is briefly mentioned at a Tony Stark party, then \"Love and Thunder\" takes place in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA poster for \"Mad Titans\" is seen in the room of a boy on New Asgard who's the son of Heimdall.\n\nIt's black with a purple skull and can be spotted when Gorr infiltrates New Asgard. Heimdall's son is named Astrid but prefers to go by Axl, inspired by Guns N' Roses member Axl Rose. The boy has a Guns N' Roses poster in his room, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe screaming goats, Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder, are from the comics.\n\nIn the movie, Thor receives them as a gift from another planet. They end up pulling the New Asgard tourist boat that the God of Thunder uses for his mission.\n\nWaititi told Insider's Jason Guerrasio that the noises the goats make were inspired by a meme of a Taylor Swift song that has screaming goats in it.\n\nIn the comics, the two goats pull Thor's chariot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Asgard tour boat that's helmed by the screaming goats is named Aegir.\n\nThis is a fitting moniker because, in the comics, Aegir is the Asgardian God of the Seas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmnipotence City is from the comics.\n\nIn the comics, the city is billions of years old and serves as the site of the parliament of pantheons.\n\nIn \"Love and Thunder,\" Omnipotence City is a secret place known only to gods. According to Russell Crowe's Zeus, gods participate in orgies and hang out at the Golden Temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Omnipotence City's coliseum, you can briefly see a throne made out of scissors.\n\nKorg points out the throne — which has a Kronan god named Ninny of the Nonnysitting on it — to Thor, Jane, and Valkyrie when they enter the Golden Temple.\n\nIt strongly resembles the famous \"Game of Thrones\" seat that's made entirely out of swords.\n\nStephen Hunter, who played Bombur in the \"Hobbit\" movies, has a cameo as a fur god in Omnipotence City.\n\nThe Golden Temple features an array of gods with different specialties, including magic, dreams, carpentry, and even dumplings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBobby Holland Hanton, Hemsworth's stunt double, has a cameo as a character named Habooska the Horrible.\n\nIn case you missed him in the movie Hanton posted a behind-the-scenes photo on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThor has tattoos dedicated to his brother Loki, who was killed by Thanos in \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\nHe has tattoos of Loki's horns, the phrase \"RIP Loki,\" the word \"brothers,\" a broken heart, a flower, a headstone, a moon, a banner that reads \"rest in mischief,\" and a scroll on his back.\n\nFans on Twitter have pointed out that the scroll appears to have the names of people in Thor's life who have died. It appears to say: \"Mother, Father, Heimdall, Loki?, Tony, Natasha.\" The latter two names refer to Tony Stark/Iron Man and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow.\n\nThe question mark next to Loki's name implies that perhaps he remembers that there's a variant of his brother who escaped a different timeline in \"Avengers: Endgame.\"\n\nWaititi told Insider that a version of the \"RIP Loki\" tattoo was supposed to be included in \"Thor: Ragnarok\" as part of a comedic moment, but it got scrapped.\n\nThe director said that Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was the person who suggested making Thor's \"Love and Thunder\" tattoos so large that they covered his whole back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tour boat's bar has a light-up sign that reads \"Cocktails and Dreams.\"\n\nThis is a nod to the 1988 Tom Cruise movie \"Cocktail,\" in which he played a bartender.\n\n\"I think a lot of the design of that stuff was like, what would seem really just weird,\" Waititi told Uproxx of the detail. \"Like other things that are going through space, why not have Cocktails and Dreams on the outside of the goat boat?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJane telling Thor, \"You better come back to me\" is reminiscent of the past \"Thor\" films.\n\nIn \"Thor\" and \"Thor: The Dark World,\" the pair always depart with Thor vowing to return. But then ends up leaving her on Earth for several years before returning.\n\nAs Jane's health declines, Thor asks her to stay behind while he goes to the shadow realm in search of the children. He vows to return to her as soon as he can.\n\nThis time around, Jane refuses to stay behind. She wields the hammer, fully aware that it's drawing its power from her human strength, and joins Thor in saving the day.\n\nStatues of the Cosmic Entities appear at the gate to Eternity.\n\nThe statues include Mistress Death (also known as Death or Lady Death in the comics), Eon, Infinity, Living Tribunal, and Uatu (the Watcher).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThor gives the Asgardian kids powers using the speech Odin gave in \"Thor.\"\n\nIn the first film, when Odin sends Thor to Earth, he whispers to Mjolnir, \"Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\"\n\nIn \"Love and Thunder,\" Thor empowers the children and gives them a pep talk before fighting Gorr and his monsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" star Brett Goldstein's end-credits cameo as Hercules is foreshadowed earlier in the film.\n\nThor's plan to rescue the Asgardian kids that Gorr has taken hostage involves assembling a powerful team. He suggests that they go to Omnipotence City — a place that has gods like Ra, Hercules, and Zeus, the \"oldest and wisest of them all\" — to gather an army.\n\nThe mention of Hercules seems irrelevant until the mid-credits scene, when it's revealed that Zeus is alive. The God of Thunder turns to his son, Hercules, and says that he wants to remind people that gods are not a joke.\n\nRead next\n\nMovie Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman\n\nAdvertisement"
