Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHilary Swank and her husband, Philip Schneider, welcomed twins in April 2023.\n\nSwank became a first-time mother in April 2023 at age 48.\n\nIn April 2023, Swank posted an Instagram photo showing her twins, revealing she'd given birth to a son and a daughter.\n\n\"It wasn't easy. But boy (and girl!) was it worth it,\" she wrote, adding that she was posting \"from pure Heaven.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamie Chung and Bryan Greenberg welcomed twins via surrogate in October 2021.\n\nGreenberg and Chung, who wed in 2015 according to People, announced the birth of their twin sons on Instagram in October 2021.\n\nChung told Today Parents in June 2022 that they used a surrogate because she was \"terrified\" to get pregnant.\n\n\"I was terrified of putting my life on hold for two-plus years. In my industry, it feels like you're easily forgotten if you don't work within the next month of your last job,\" she said, calling surrogacy \"a compromise that we made together as a couple.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLance Bass and husband Michael Turchin also welcomed twins via surrogate the same month.\n\nThe twins, Alexander and Violet, made their red-carpet debut at an event in February 2023.\n\n\"It's just nice to be able to get out. We've never really been out too much with them, especially in a public forum like this. They've never done a red carpet before,\" Bass told E! News at the event.\n\n\"Being dads is the best thing ever. Everyone always told us but it is so true that this life is so much better with these kiddos,\" he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMariah Carey gave birth to Monroe and Moroccan in April 2011. They're now 12 years old.\n\nThings didn't work out with the twins' father, Nick Cannon; Cannon filed for divorce in December 2014, TMZ reported in January 2015. The split was finalized in 2016, E!

They also share a daughter, 11-year-old India.\n\nBut they have shared some really adorable shots, all the same. Check them out on Pataky's Instagram, or this old snap Hemsworth shared in 2021 of the three kids as babies.\n\nIn 2022, India made her on-screen debut, playing Love in \"Thor: Love and Thunder.\" The twins also appear in the film, with one of his sons playing a young Thor, and the other playing an Asgardian child.\n\n\"It felt like a fun, one-off family experience,\" Hemsworth told reporter Kevin McCarthy in 2022. \"I don't want them to now go and be child stars and actors. It was just a special experience we all had and I loved it. They had a great time.\"\n\nJulia Roberts is the mom of 18-year-old twins Hazel and Phinnaeus, though they're not often photographed together.\n\nAccording to People, Roberts and her husband, Daniel Moder, welcomed the twins in November 2004.

Graham wrote in an essay for Glamour that she hemorrhaged the night she gave birth to Malachi and Roman in a home birthing tub in her apartment. It took weeks to recover.\n\nIn addition to Roman and Malachi, who turned 1 on January 14, Graham gave birth to her first son, Isaac in January 2020, People reported.\n\nGraham took to Instagram to celebrate the twins' first birthday. \"Happy birthday to my beautiful boys, Roman & Malachi!\" wrote Graham. \"You two are constantly curious, utterly hilarious, and always changing. You keep me on my toes and make it totally worth it that I had to write this from the kitchen floor, covered in God knows what.
