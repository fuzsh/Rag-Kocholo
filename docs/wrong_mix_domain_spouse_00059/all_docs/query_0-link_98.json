        "text": "Joe Manganiello and Sofía Vergara\n\nSince Alex Dunphy is in this list, let’s take a look at another Modern Family star. Anyone who watches the comedy series, will love Gloria Delgado-Pritchett. The role is portrayed by Colombian-American actress Sofia Vergara. She began dating Magic Mike star and Dungeons & Dragons fan and player, Joe Manganiello.\n\nBased on reports, the two began dating in 2014. After six years together, they announced their engagement during Christmas. In 2015, they said their vows and began a new life together as a married couple. The height difference wasn’t an issue for them at all. Vergara is 5’7”, while Manganiello is a full ten inches taller than her, at 6’5”. When the couple unfortunately divorced in 2023 it wasn't over the height gap.\n\nRhea Durham and Mark Wahlberg\n\nAmerican actor, Mark Wahlberg, can be pretty intimidating because of the roles he takes on. He’s known for starring in gritty films, like The Fighter and The Departed. He also tried careers in rap, producing, and business. And who can forget is lingerie model phase in the 90s. However, the action star extraordinaire seems tame when he stands next to his wife, who’s an inch taller than him.\n\nWhen Rhea Durham came to Wahlberg’s life, he finally had a partner in crime for the arduous red carpet events. But that’s also when the height difference became apparent. Durham is a model, so yeah, she’s tall. The height, of course, wasn’t an issue for the happy couple. Wahlberg and Rhea enjoyed their long courtship so much, they decided to cap it off eight years later with a wedding! The couple has been blessed with a quartet of beautiful kids; two daughters, Ella Rae and Grace Margaret, and two sons, Brendan Joseph and Michael.\n\nShakira and Gerard Pique\n\nThis couple first met when soccer player Gerard Pique appeared in Shakira’s “Waka-Waka” music video, for the 2010 World Cup. At that time, this tall guy had already piqued Shakira’s interest. Pique, 6’4” towers over Shakira at 5’0” by an entire foot. Despite the height difference, the magic still happened.\n\nA year after filming the music video, Gerard Pique and Shakira Shakira made their relationship official. Soon after, they got married. Now, Shakira and Pique are happy and thankful for their two children. While the two are no longer together, they’re doing well as individuals too. Shakira has continued to be a sold-out artist, even after years of being active in the industry; and Pique is still one of the most popular center-backs in both FIFA and EUFA.\n\nJamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl\n\nThis is the 21st century. Surely by now, the “guys should be taller” standard is outdated. Height has nothing to do with love. Like age, it’s just a number. No couple proves this point more than the adorable Jamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl. These two are pretty well-known in their individual careers. Cullum is a singer and songwriter while Dahl is a model and author.\n\nDahl towers over Cullum by almost half a foot. Dahl once commented about their height difference, stating, “I think if we were both slightly more neurotic people, it would be crippling, but the fact of the matter is that we’re both happy. It’s cool.” This couple tied the knot in 2010 and they’re very happy together, spending a lot of their time in the company of their two amazing daughters.\n\nJustin Theroux & Jennifer Aniston\n\nYes, yes. We are aware of this couple’s decision to end their togetherness. But, they were once married, so we’re still stacking them up on this height comparison list! Jennifer Aniston is undeniably loved by people, because of the phenomenal TV sitcom, Friends. She played the unforgettable role of Rachel Green. Friends will break your heart, but it will also give you lots of laughs in every episode. And Aniston played an integral part of the gang for many years.\n\nAniston’s love life has always been a front page deal for the media, so her relationship with comedian and screenwriter, Justin Theroux, was a big deal. With pictures of them appearing constantly, their height difference was a regular topic of conversation in the gossip magazines. The pair met in 2011, on the set of Wanderlust, and immediately began dating. Then, in 2012, they got engaged. By 2015, they were married. Keeping to their tradition of changing things up every two years, the couple decided to end their marriage in 2017. With such a lot of time shared together, we hope that they’re still good friends.\n\nJessica Simpson and Eric Johnson\n\nHere’s another couple with a perfect foot of distance between them. Jessica Simpson and Eric Johnson are happy to take one for the team. After Jessica Simpson split with singer Nick Lachey, she had an on-and-off relationship with another singer, John Mayer. She had been through many other dating controversies until she met the irresistible NFL tight end, Eric Johnson.\n\nSimpson and Johnson began dating in 2010. A few months later, they announced their engagement, and not long after, they welcomed a daughter in 2012, and a son in 2013. Then came 2014, when they decided to tie the knot. By early 2018, the announcement came that they are welcoming their third baby.\n\nStephanie Seymour & Azzedine Alaia\n\nAnother model in the list! Stephanie Seymour also served as the face of Victoria’s Secret and Playboy. She’s a supermodel through and through. She even authored a book for models, professional and aspiring ones alike. She wrote Stephanie Seymour’s Beauty Secrets for Dummies in 1998, and snagged a spot in the North American FHM’s 100 Sexiest Women list, for 2000.\n\nSteeped in fashion as she is, it’s no wonder Seymour fell in love with a couturier and shoe designer, Azzedine Alaia. They’re just a perfect match! At first, the 7-inch height difference seems like it might get in the way. But love has a way of filling such small voids. This couple’s time together was sadly cut short, however, as Alaia passed away in 2017.\n\nKatie Holmes & Tom Cruise\n\nSince we’re on a roll, why not go all the way through Cruise’s marriages?! After Tom Cruise’s divorce from Nicole Kidman, he began dating again. This time, he set his sights on Katie Holmes. When they attended red carpet events, Holmes’ high heel height advantage made Cruise appear to shrink by her side.\n\nSeems like Cruise is harboring his own fetish for taller girls. In 2005, the couple announced that they were dating, on The Oprah Winfrey Show. On October of the same year, they said that they were having their first child. The year after their daughter, Suri, was born, the couple got married. Sadly, this too didn’t last. After more than five years of marriage, they broke it off.\n\nReese Witherspoon and Jim Toth\n\nReese Witherspoon is undoubtedly one of the most popular stars in Hollywood. She received a lot of praise when she took on the role of Elle Woods in \"Legally Blonde.\" Her nominations and trophies show how great she is at her craft. But has anyone ever bothered to pay attention to Reese’s height? It didn’t occur to any of her fans until they saw her standing next to her ex husband.\n\nThe award-winning actress stands at 5’1”. Meanwhile, her former husband, Jim Toth, towers above her in the frame, standing way taller, at 6’1”. Toth is a talent agent who’s worked with some of Hollywood’s most popular celebrities. While we all notice Reese’s height, this talent-spotting guru didn’t care in the slightest.\n\nStacy Keibler and Jared Pobre\n\nStacy Keibler had to go through quite a rough road before she met her soulmate, Jared Pobre. Before Pobre, she went out with American actor and businessman, George Clooney. They stayed together for two years. However, Clooney soon went his own way, marrying international human rights lawyer, Amal Clooney.\n\nWhen Keibler got over the heartbreak, she began dating another businessman and long-time friend, Jared Pobre. He is the founder and former CEO of Future Ads, now known as Propel Media, an online-advertising company. During their courtship, Keibler continued her pro-wrestling and acting career. Everything was going right for Keibler. And then there came a surprise. Jared Pobre prepared a beach wedding in Mexico for the lucky star. Her happiness, Keibler remarked, was indescribable.\n\nSlavica & Bernie Ecclestone\n\nAs former CEO of the Formula One Group, Bernie Ecclestone holds a whole lot of stock in the world of business. After stepping down from the role, he remained in the company as chairman emeritus and adviser. To put it simply, Bernie Ecclestone has more riches than any one heart could desire.\n\nThe business mogul has been married four times. One of his wives was Slavica Ecclestone, a multi-lingual Croatian international model whose clients included the likes of Armani. While working with a Formula One project, she met Bernie and, despite the vast differences that stretched between them—a 28-year-gap and full foot of height—love blossomed between the two. Slavica stands at more than 6 feet, while Bernie peeps just a few inches over the 5 foot mark. Even if he tiptoed, he couldn’t come close to matching the model’s epic height. However, that barely matters anymore, since they split up in 2009.\n\nVictoria Beckham & David Beckham\n\nWho wouldn’t cheer for this handsome English retired football player? David Beckham played for several teams when he was still an active player of the sport. Before he retired, he was billed as one of the best midfielders in the history of football. But Beckham didn’t just win in football, he scored big in life.\n\nIn 1997, he started dating Victoria Adams. Yes, that’s our girl, Posh Spice, from the legendary Spice Girls. It was a great scoop for the media, who doggedly followed the love story of the two. Their relationship was quite literally impossible to hide. At 6’0”, Beckham stands out quite a bit, especially with wee Posh standing next to him. Their romance brought them to the altar in 1999, and they are now parents to three sons and a daughter.\n\nEliza Dushku & Rick Fox\n\nElisha Dushku’s height is a respectable 5’5”. But her husband, Rick Fox, is just soaring at 6’7”. Nothing new for a basketball player. Elisha Dushku is well-known because of her roles in popular films like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, This Boy’s Life, and Wrong Turn. Her voice was also featured in various video games.\n\nDushku began dating LA Lakers player and actor, Rick Fox, in 2009. A year after, it was confirmed that the couple was already living together. Sadly, some things are not meant to last. That included this cute couple’s romance. In 2014, it was made known to the public that they had separated.\n\nTina Fey and Jeff Richmond\n\nYou can’t always tell the height difference between two people when it’s just a matter of a few inches. That impression holds true for this couple. Tina Fey is taller than Jeff Richmond by just 3 inches. But when Fey wears her pumps, Richmond looks just how she likes to describe him—travel size.\n\nTina Fey and Jeff Richmond have been dating for seven years before marrying in 2001. Ever since they met in 1994, they have also been working together to produce great pieces of cinema and television. They both have breakthroughs in the field of comedy, including The Second City, 30 Rock, and The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\n\nFreida Pinto & Dev Patel\n\nFreida Pinto’s breakthrough in her acting career, began with her debut role in Slumdog Millionaire. She was even nominated for several awards thanks to her radiant performance. You may also recognize her from the sci-fi film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes. In her debut movie, she met Dev Patel, who was also highly praised for his performance in the heartwarming film. Together, they attended awards nights and red carpet events.\n\nThat was when their love story began. In 2009, they started seeing each other romantically. They took it slow, dating for six years. Maybe, the slowness was a sign they somehow knew it wasn’t going to work out. Surely not because of their 5-inch height difference? Whatever the reason, in 2014, they made it known to the public that they were going their separate ways.\n\nNicole Kidman and Keith Urban\n\nHere’s another one of those couples where the girl is taller than the guy—Nicole Kidman is 5’11” and Keith Urban is 5’10”. This couple is always so lovey-dovey, even in public. During interviews and on red carpets, they steal the show with how sweet they are. Nicole Kidman is also an award-winning actress who made her mark in the industry at a young age. Almost all of her films, critics say, have been commercially successful. They earn high revenues and commendations from different review-aggregation sites.\n\nAfter her divorce from fellow actor, Tom Cruise, Kidman gave love another try. And we’re all happy that she did. Like Cameron Diaz, Kidman fell in love with a musician. She has been married to country singer, Keith Urban, since 2006. To prove that this couple are head over heels for each other, here are some of Urban’s most sentimental country music lyrics: “Definitely, we both met each other at the right time. Meeting her and getting married with her was not life-changing. It was life-beginning.”\n\nChanning Tatum & Jenna Dewan\n\nHere’s another Magic Mike actor on the list. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan did that old Hollywood thing and made their onscreen romance real. After the filming of Step Up, Dewan and Tatum began dating. Eventually, they got married and welcomed a daughter.\n\nThe couple’s 10-inch height difference hasn’t seemed to bother them. And when they dance together, they look good, as if the height difference weren’t there. They just have this chemistry that makes them look comfortable and compatible with each other. Sadly, the fans of this OTP were dismayed, when they announced their split in 2018.\n\nGigi Hadid and Zayn Malik\n\nThis couple was also stuck in an on-and-off ride, but fans remain loyal to them. Who wouldn’t? Despite Gigi’s slight height advantage, they’re perfect for each other. Zayn, after leaving One Direction, successfully launched a solo career. But in his love life, he’s not going alone. He’s got his lovely model girlfriend, Gigi Hadid. Being a Victoria Secret Angel, Hadid stands an inch taller than Zayn.\n\nThey seemed to be doing all right in their two-year relationship. But news broke out about their breakup, and fans were dismayed. Recently, however, Gigi Hadid uploaded a post to Instagram that implies they might be back together. Fans are holding their collective breath until an official statement comes out.\n\nAri Cooper And Deryck Whibley\n\nSum 41 frontman, Deryck Whibley, was married to fellow rockstar Avril Lavigne before eventually marrying Ari Cooper. Lavigne was 5’2”, and Whibley 5’6”. Height obviously wasn’t an issue. Now, with his new wife, things are different. Ari Cooper stands at 6’0”, half a foot taller than Whibley. Love’s ability to transcend such details as an unconventional height difference wasn’t the only wonder Whibley discovered when he met Cooper.\n\nIn 2014, he suffered organ failure due to alcohol abuse. He had to stay in the hospital for months, during which time his loving fiancé never left his side. He even said in an interview that she was a huge help in turning his life around. A turbulent year later, the two got married and Whibley is now happily living the sober life.\n\nPeter Dinklage and Erica Schmidt\n\nWho among the Game of Thrones characters is your favorite? I’m sure there’ll be a lot of you whom immediately think of the clever and charismatic Tyrion Lannister. Who wouldn’t love Tyrion? He’s smart, eloquent, and has the remarkable ability to always dodge the everpresent hand of death. This endearing character is played by Peter Dinklage, who’s also popular for his roles in The Station Agent and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\n\nPeter Dinklage was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. But this condition hasn’t stood between him and a stellar career, celebrated by a host of loving fans. Dedicated though his fans may be, there’s someone whose love for Dinklage we can’t parallel. That person is none other than Dinklage’s wonderful wife, American actress Erica Schmidt. The pair were married in 2005 and until now, have remained private about their personal lives. In fact, they haven’t even revealed their kids’ name to the public. But of course, we respect that. Whenever Dinklage is asked about his family, he delivers some touchingly beautiful answers. When one interviewer asked about his wife, Dinklage replied, “she’s very inspiring. She’s definitely the artist of the family. I am just the TV actor who pays the bills.”\n\nLeBron James and Savannah Brinson\n\nHere’s another giant on the basketball court. Even nonbasketball fans know of LeBron James. This guy is in contention for the next NBA GOAT, after all! Ever since high school, LeBron had a thing with sports. He was a football and basketball player in high school. And that’s where he met Savannah Brinson, who was a cheerleader and softball player at the time. Meaning they’re one of those adorable couples who came together as high school sweethearts.\n\nEveryone couldn’t agree more that they’re meant to be. When James first met Brinson, he wasn’t as tall as he is now. But his height was already pretty impressive. They got along well, obviously. In 2011, James proposed to Brinson during a New Year’s Eve Party. This beautiful couple has stood the test of time, with more than 15 years of marriage, and three gorgeous children to be proud of.\n\nKhloé Kardashian & Lamar Odom\n\nAnd the Kardashians are back! Khloe Kardashian seems to really have a thing for taller guys. She dated Lamar Odom in 2009 (before her tryst with Tristan Thompson). The two first met at a party for Artest, Lamar Odom’s teammate. Odom played for the LA Lakers when he and Khloe dated each other.\n\nExactly a month after she met Odom, they were married. Their wedding was even featured in the Kardashian’s reality TV show, giving us the opportunity to take a glimpse into the world of the socialites. There was even a spinoff show, called Khloe and Lamar. As with most things in the world of reality TV, the affair was short lived.The couple only remained married until 2016. Kardashian pursued the divorce, and it was finalized that very same year.\n\nChris Bosh & Adrienne Williams\n\nHere’s another one from the NBA scene. Chris Bosh is not really the biggest player in Miami Heat. But come on, he’s 6’11”. By any standards other than basketball, that’s crazy tall. His giant stature becomes more pronounced when he poses next to his wife, Adrienne Williams. American businesswoman and philanthropist, Williams is a full two feet shorter than her athletic husband.\n\nNonetheless, Bosh and Williams got married in 2011. If you haven’t figured it out by now, height is just a number. They’ve been enjoying their married life and have happily welcomed three sons and a daughter into their fold.\n\nKaley Cuoco & Ryan Sweeting\n\nKaley Cuoco has been rocking our TV screens as Penny, in the CBS sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, since 2007. So iconic is the show, and her role in it, we doubt she’ll ever be able to shake it. After a number of called-off engagements, Cuoco finally met the one she was willing to walk down the aisle with. That someone just so happened to be a good 10 inches taller than her.\n\nAfter three months of dating, Cuoco became engaged to her tennis playing sweetheart, Ryan Sweeting. By December of 2013, they were married. Sadly, two years after, they decided to break things off. They filed for a divorce in 2015. Just like Khloe Kardashian, the divorce was finalized in 2016. Seems like 2016 was a year for “out with the old, in with the new!”\n\nEva Longoria & Tony Parker\n\nEva Longoria has had her fair share of marriages with tall husbands. One of them was Spurs point guard, Tony Parker. They first met in 2004, and got engaged two years later. Then, in 2007, they had a church wedding. Whenever the couple walked down the red carpet, they would steal the scene. Tony Parker’s height is pretty eye-catching.\n\nTony Parker stands at more than 6 feet, and Longoria is a 5 flat. Yes, that’s more than a foot difference. People often become speechless because of the huge gap. Well, it didn’t seem to bother the two. They just smiled and had their photos taken. Sadly, this relationship didn’t last either. Longoria eventually moved on and got married again. That’s how it usually goes in Hollywood.\n\nKhloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson\n\nOf course, there has got to be another Kardashian in this list. Khloe Kardashian is an American TV personality, entrepreneur, and need we say it, socialite. She stars in the reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians and other spin-offs. For more than five years, she was married to Lamar Odom, a basketball player. They even had their own TV show.\n\nAfter the split, she found love again with another basketball player, Tristan Thompson. Kardashian already has an impressive height of 5’9”, but having a basketball player for a boyfriend meant 5’9” is short. Thompson plays ball at 6’9”. In 2017, this couple announced that they were having a baby. And then earlier in 2018, it was said that they were expecting another one. Sadly, it was recently reported that they split up after Tristan was caught cheating. Very Bad, Tristan.\n\nNicole Kidman & Tom Cruise\n\nYou might have thought this golden oldie wouldn’t get a mention on this list. But how could we forget the Nicole Kidman-Tom Cruise love story? Kidman met Cruise in 1989, during the filming of Days of Thunder. And, from her dating history, it seems she may have a thing for guys who are shorter than her.\n\nOn Christmas Eve of 1990, Kidman and Cruise got married. It was Cruise’s second marriage at the time. They even adopted two children, Isabella Jane and Connor Anthony, while they were married. In 2001, the couple split. Cruise filed the divorce. In 2006, Kidman admitted that she still loved Cruise dearly, and it wasn’t easy to totally erase him from her life.\n\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner\n\nJoe Jonas rose to fame as member of boyband, The Jonas Brothers. Now, he is also part of the new American band, DNCE, who dominated the charts with their hit debut single “Cake by the Ocean.” Joe Jonas also starred in many Disney Channel shows and several movies. Like all child stars before him, Jonas has had his fair share of whirlwind romances before finally meeting the girl he’s going to marry.\n\nBut none of the past girlfriends were able to sweep Jo-Jo off his feet like Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner did. He stands at 5’7″ and Sophie is 5'10\". They started dating in 2016. Even with the three-inch height difference, they decided to get engaged last October.\n\nChristina Ricci & James Heerdegen\n\nThis small woman is a face of success and contentment. Christina Ricci’s diminutive stature has always been obvious, but was never a hurdle for her award-winning acting career. Her breakout role was as Wednesday Addams, in The Addams Family movies. In 2008, Ricci dated actor Owen Benjamin. They met in the filming of All’s Faire in Love, and even announced their engagement. However, they were just not meant to be.\n\nIn 2013, Ricci met a new beau who was destined to become a big part of her life. She happily informed her family and friends that she was engaged to James Heerdegen, a camera dolly technician she worked with in Pan Am. In October of the same year, they got married and eventually had a son.\n\nDaena E. Title & Jason Alexander\n\nYou probably know Jason Alexander from his long-running roles as George Costanza in Seinfeld, and his sleazy appearance as Phillip Stuckey, in Pretty Woman. However, the talented actor has also busted out many lead roles in Broadway musicals. He married actress Daena Title, way back in 1982, with not a care in the world, given that she breezes through life a good four inches higher than he does.\n\nUnlike many Hollywood couples who are divorced before you even realized they were married, Alexander and Title are staying true to their wedding vows. Just as they have been for the last 35 years. With more than three decades together and two children—Gabriel and Noah—that’s a feat of love that dwarfs any concerns about height difference.\n\nMila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher\n\nHere’s some showbiz buzz for you! Mila Kunis actually shared her first kiss ever with co-star Ashton Kutcher. It was in the sitcom they starred in together as teenagers, That ‘70s Show. With their acting careers just kicking off, the pair shared more of a brother-sister relationship at the time. It wasn’t until many years later that a romantic spark bloomed between the two. Somehow though, the show’s producers and its audience knew that there should be something more between them.\n\nThe couple they portrayed in the sitcom was always in the midst of an on-and-off relationship. But in real life, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were solid from the moment they realised they were meant for one another. They’ve since vowed to love each other in sickness and in health, making it official with their wedding, in 2015. Now they are happily living the married life, with two kids, Wyatt and Dimitri.\n\nDanny DeVito and Rhea Perlman\n\nThis next couple’s height difference isn’t that apparent, with petite Perlman only standing two inches taller than diminutive DeVito. Together, the pair have already won five Emmys. They have numerous remarkable works to their names, and fans can’t seem to get enough of this pint-sized power couple. Most people remember them fondly as the couple in the 1996 film, Matilda. They also worked together in the sitcom Taxi, which, needless to say, was a phenomenal hit.\n\nThe first time they met was actually by happenstance. Rhea Perlman went to the 1971 staging of The Shrinking Bride. Just as fate planned, Danny DeVito was in that play. They fell so deeply in love that after just two weeks they decided to move in together! So, it wasn’t a surprise when they walked down the aisle a year later. At present, they have three children.\n\nCarla Bruni & Nicolas Sarkozy\n\nItalian-French singer Carla Bruni has decidedly mesmerized former French President, Nicola Sarkozy. They met at a dinner party in 2007. At the time, the president had only recently divorced his ex-wife, so he and Bruni took things slow. The following year, the loved up pair were married in Paris. Sarkozy was Bruni’s first husband, while she was his third wife. After their wedding, she was overrun with state visits, as she suddenly had the responsibility of accompanying the president on such engagements. In 2011, they welcomed their daughter Giulia.\n\nThe attitude toward height difference between this couple is a little different to most of the other lovers we’ve listed here. It’s rumored that the president is actually quite sensitive about it. Whenever they visit other states, Bruni wears flats. It’s not much of a secret, now that Sarkozy wears heeled shoes to try to square up with his wife’s height.\n\nPharrell Williams and Helen Lasichanh\n\nOur next couple started out as friends. In fact, Pharell Williams and Helen Lasichanh were lost in friend-zone limbo for two years until they realized they were meant to be. Despite this long stretch of passion-free friendship, and the two-inch height difference, Williams and Lasichanh were both smitten with each other. “She just stood out,” Pharrell said, describing the love of his life. And he’s not just talking about Helen’s soaring 5’11” height. Pharell’s statement 100% describes how Helen captivated his heart.\n\nFinally, after five years of dating, they decided to take their vows. The couple even wore rather unique outfits to their wedding. They colored their life event with plaid. The happy pair are now parents to a son and triplets. Pharrell now has every reason to sing “Happy.”\n\nCourtney Mazza & Mario Lopez\n\nThis couple only has a four-inch difference in their height. Not much, right? Why would these two good-looking people care about such a small height difference? They ain’t got no time for that. Mario Lopez is a TV host and actor. He is popularly known as AC Slater, from Saved by the Bell. Having been through quite a few marriages in the past, he finally realized that his meant-to-be was right there waiting for him in the same industry.\n\nIn 2008, Lopez met Broadway star, Courtney Mazza. She is a marvelously talented dancer and actress. They ran into each other during the production of Broadway musical, A Chorus Line. After four years, they got married. Now, they enjoy being a mom and a dad to Gia and Dominic. So it seems Lopez was saved, not so much by the bell as by Broadway!\n\nAmy Poehler & Will Arnett\n\nAmy Poehler is a deservedly famous comedian, best known for her role in the sitcom, Parks and Recreation, and as a cast member in Saturday Night Live. She’s also starred as the voice of Joy in the hilarious animation, Inside Out. It seems only natural for a comedian to fall for a fellow comedian. And this is exactly how things worked out for Poehler.\n\nThe funny lady’s match was met in the form of Will Arnett. He was cast in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, took voice roles in Ratatouille, Despicable Me, and, of course, Bojack Horseman. In 2003, this couple tied the knot. Since then, they’ve worked together on films and animations. They have two sons, Archie and Abel. However, after nine years of love, unfortunately, they informed their friends and family that they were separating. Another one of those love stories with a rather sad ending.\n\nKevin Hart and Eniko Parrish\n\nIf you’re into comedy movies, you most probably know Kevin Hart. He starred in Soul Plane, Scary Movies 3, and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. He also landed roles in Ride Along, The Secret Life of Pets, and Get Hard. With such a giant reputation, it’s not obvious that Hart is just 5’4” tall.\n\nHart is actually three inches shorter than his stunning wife, Eniko Parrish. But he doesn’t take any offense to the jokes about it... most of the time. In fact, he even makes light of this height difference himself. Sometimes, though, he takes things seriously. At a recent red carpet event, he even dropped some words that left the audience in awe: “I don’t believe in doing things to manufacture my body to appeal to what I think people might like.” Word. Just be who you are, Kevin!\n\nKim Kardashian & Kris Humphries\n\nSeems like the Kardashians are getting the spotlight in this list. Here’s yet another one who’s found herself in a relationship with a guy much taller than her. It’s no longer new that Kim Kardashian’s life has become a public spectacle. Of course, it sprung from the reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nKim has been married to Kanye West since 2014, and has three kids with him. But from 2011 to 2013, Kim was married to basketball player, Kris Humphries. It was a noticeable relationship, in large part because of their height discrepancy. Humphries stands at 6’9”, more than a foot taller than Kim. Their relationship didn’t last and Kim filed for a divorce. Surely, the height difference wasn’t to blame?\n\nJenna Elfman and Bodhi Elfman\n\nJenna Elfman left a mark in showbiz in the 1990s, starring as the leading lady in various films and sitcoms. When Jenna attends red carpet events with Bodhi Elfman, her husband, she usually sports a-rockin' set of stilettos with her outfit. When she does, the minuscule height difference between them becomes way more apparent. While they both tower at nearly 6 feet, Bodhi is an inch shorter than his wife. But, when it comes to red carpet events, he doesn’t have the benefit of shoe-based elevation.\n\nJenna and Bodhi Elfman first met during a Sprite commercial audition in 1991. This beautiful couple hasn’t just stood the test of their height difference. They have definitely stood the test of time. Married since 1995, the loved-up duo are still going strong to this day. Now, they’re happily spending their time working on their craft and, of course, raising their children.\n\nPaul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly\n\nIf you’re an avid fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you’re pretty familiar with Paul Bettany. He is the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., and eventually became Vision. He also starred in popular films, like Da Vinci Code, Dogville, Inkheart, Legion, Creation, A Beautiful Mind. Bettany was fortunate to have met the love of his life in the same industry.\n\nPaul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly first met when they starred in A Beautiful Mind. However, it seems it just wasn’t the right time back then. They were both in other relationships while they were filming. Bettany admitted that Connelly was his crush, ever since he saw her in Labyrinth. Soon after, he realized that his crush was actually full-blown love, and he contacted her. In 2003, they got married in Scotland, and are now happy with their children, Stellan and Agnes.\n\nRosie Huntington-Whiteley & Jason Statham\n\nRosie Huntington-Whiteley rose to notoriety as one of the infamous Victoria’s Secret Angels. She is also the face of other famous brands, like Burberry and Marks & Spencer. From modelling, she’s spread her wings with roles in Transformer: Dark of the Moon and Mad Max: Fury Road. Behind the angelic appearance of the top model, lies a very feisty actress. Feisty and tall—the actress and model, at 5’9”, towers over her action star partner.\n\nSince 2010, Rosie has been in a relationship with action megastar, Jason Statham. The Crank actor announced in 2016 that he would be marrying his statuesque sweetheart. Later on, they welcomed Jack Oscar Statham as the newest member of their family. With not a care in the world about their height difference, we wish this sweet little family all the best!\n\nKristen Bell and Dax Shepard\n\nIn both love and comedy, these guys have vowed to always be there for each other. When it comes to the love side of things, their 5’1” vs. 6’2” height difference definitely makes them stand out. Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are partners in crime that have been making us smile ever since they kicked off their satirical music video remakes. Then, their Hollywood films and adorable social media videos always have us in stitches.\n\nThe pair started dating in 2007. Three years later, they announced their engagement. Together, they’ve appeared in Veronica Mars, When in Rome, Hit and Run, and CHiPs. They seem to be inseparable even on screen. After delaying their marriage, the two finally dove in after Shepard proposed for a second time on Twitter! Of course, Kristen Bell said yes... again.\n\nKate Middleton and Prince William\n\nThere has got to be a spot for a royal couple on this list. And today, we’re giving that space to Kate Middleton and Prince William. The Princess of Wales is already gifted with height, standing at a stately 5’9”. But there’s something about the prince’s blue blood that’s seen him soar to a staggering 6’3”. Such towering figures are only fitting for royalty. People will not only look up to them as monarchs, but also because of their height.\n\nKidding aside, Kate Middleton studied art history at the University of St. Andrews. She first met the prince in 2003. Both were students at the time. Eight years later, they became husband and wife at the Westminster Abbey. At present, they are parents to three children who are already in line for inheriting the throne… and perhaps their parents’ height too?\n\nVanessa Hudgens & Austin Butler\n\nIf Ashley Tisdale is on this list, we’d better include Vanessa Hudgens! Just like Ashley Tisdale, Hudgens also partnered with a guy who’s more than 10 inches taller than her. The High School Musical star’s relationship with co-star, Zac Efron, seemed to be working out well at first.\n\nOf course, everyone was hoping for the Troy-Gabriella love team to play out in real life, too. But it didn’t last. The actress and singer went on to find love with a fellow musician. Actor and singer Austin Butler captivated her immediately. They started dating in 2011, though the two have since split.\n\nTracy Pollan & Michael J. Fox\n\nWe all know Tracy Pollan from Family Ties. She rose to fame primarily because of her portrayal of Ellen Reed, in this iconic family sitcom. This talented girl is two inches taller tha her (equally talented) husband, actor Michael J. Fox. She met Fox on the set of Family Ties, where she played his girlfriend, but at the time, their romance remained strictly on-screen.\n\nIt seems, though, that fate had more in store for the couple. They met again through Bright Lights, Big City, years after the sitcom that shot them both to stardom. Then, the sparks were undeniable. The two-inch height difference melted from their minds, as a beautiful relationship began to flourish. In 1988, they decided to tie the knot, and now have four children, including a set of twins! Their eldest is Sam Michael, followed by the twins, Aquinnah Kathleen and Schuyler Frances Fox, and the youngest, Esme Annabelle Fox.\n\nCandace Cameron Bure & Valeri Bure\n\nCandace Cameron Bure is a popular American actress who took on the role of DJ Tanner, in the Full House series. She also starred in St. Elsewhere, Growing Pains, and Some Kind of Wonderful. She even won third place with Mark Ballas, in Dancing with the Stars, season 18. Clearly, Candace Cameron is a pretty busy woman!\n\nIn 1996, someone came into her life that probably made it even busier. She met Russian-American National Hockey League right winger, Valeri Bure. Cameron’s Full House co-actor, Dave Coulier, took on the role of their match-making fairy godfather. He introduced them at a charity hockey game, and the rest is history. They’ve been married since 1996 and, over the years, made three little additions to their little family: two sons and a daughter. Meaning the Bure team is now complete with Natasha, Lev, and Maksim.\n\nIan Somerhalder and Nikki Reed\n\nLet’s hear some cheer from The Vampire Diaries crowd. This one’s for you, guys. Damon Salvatore and Rosalie Hale made it in real life. Fans were excited when Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed announced that they were dating in 2014.\n\nSome more good news for the fans and family of the two, came when they confirmed their engagement in 2015. A few months after the engagement, they got married in the wonderful and magical Malibu. Two years later, they had their first child. They started as strangers, brought together as co-stars and now they are blissfully happy with their daughter, Bodhi Soleil. Finally a vampire story with a happy ending!\n\nNatalie Portman and Benjamin Millepied\n\nNatalie Portman is a huge figure in Hollywood. She’s known to choose her roles very well. One of the characters she portrayed, that certainly put her on the map, was in the critically-acclaimed psychological horror, Black Swan. Aside from being an award-winning actress, Portman is also a Harvard graduate, and she even said once, “I’d rather be smart than a movie star.”\n\nIn 2012, Portman married Benjamin Millepied, a French ballet dancer. They met during the filming of Black Swan in 2009, where Millepied was the choreographer. Just a year after, they announced their engagement. The couple then left L.A. and went to Paris in 2014, when Millepied accepted a job as director of dance, in the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher\n\nCelebrity couple, Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher, also brush off their whole-foot height difference. They said that love will always be at the top of their priorities. Height is probably not even on the list. Fortunately, they have a lot of similar interests that stack up to make their relationship work. The best one is their sense of humor. They just find each other too much fun to be with.\n\nOf course, it’s not just love that completes their perfect union. Baron and Fisher insist there has to be trust, respect, and a bouquet of other contributing factors. Religion being one of them. Cohen is a devout Jew and, since Fisher wanted to spend the rest of her life with him, she decided to convert to Judaism. She even released a statement about her decision before their wedding: “Religion comes second to love as far as we are concerned,” Isla Fisher said. She was ready to give it her all for their future together.\n\nHilaria Baldwin & Alec Baldwin\n\nAlec Baldwin is an American comedian, host, actor and writer who comes from a renowned family of actors. You might be familiar with him from 30 Rock, the Mission Impossible series or perhaps from his remarkable portrayal of Donald Trump, on Saturday Night Live.\n\nIn 2011, Baldwin dated Hilaria Thomas, an actress and yoga instructor from Manhattan. In the early days of dating, they lived in Greenwich Village and, after a year of loved up happiness, they got engaged. Two months later, they were on their way down the aisle in New York City. They’re now happily married with a daughter and three sons: Carmen, Rafael, Leonardo Angel Charles, and Romeo Alejandro David.\n\nJoel Madden and Nicole Richie\n\nJoel Madden is the lead vocalist of Good Charlotte, and also tags the roles of actor, producer, and DJ to his list of credentials. Nicole Richie, on the other hand, is more renowned as a socialite who has since made a name for herself in the fashion industry. She is also known simply for being best friends with Paris Hilton. They even had a Fox reality TV show, called The Simple Life.\n\nMadden and Richie began dating in 2006. With Richie standing at an adorably petite 5-foot flat, the seven-inch height difference was instantly obvious. The loved up couple didn’t mind, however. On the contrary, they confirmed they were getting married in 2010. This came after daughters, Harlow and Sparrow, came to their lives. In 2008, the baby photos of Harlow were sold to People magazine. Can you guess how much for? $1 million. She was, of course, a precious little baby, but that’s one insanely lucrative baby shower!\n\nMariah Carey & James Packer\n\nDubbed the “Songbird Supreme,” Mariah Carey is well-known for her five-octave vocal range. Who can forget her prominent whistle every time she offers a song for us? The fact that she stands 5’8” tall makes her even more intimidating. But when she stands next to ex-fiance, James Packer, who’s an astonishing 6’6”, our songbird doesn’t look so large.\n\nIn 2016, Carey was engaged to Australian investor, James Packer. It was such a brief romance that the very same year, they called the whole thing off. Not a very happy ending, since they didn’t even reach the wedding day. At least they knew, before things got messy, that it wasn’t going to last.\n\nTiffani Thiessen & Brady Smith\n\nSince we already have Mario Lopez from Saved by the Bell, let’s add another one from the cast! Tiffani Thiessen also starred in the sitcom, playing Kelly Kapowski. She’s also that pretty Valerie Malone, from Beverly Hills. Later in life, she met an actor from Houston, Texas, who became her other half.\n\nBrady Smith graduated from Stephen Austin State University, in 1994. In 2005, he married Tiffani and has been enjoying blissfully married life ever since. Their lives changed in a great way when they were blessed with their two children—a daughter named Harper, who was born in 2010, followed by their son, Holt, in 2015.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe and Erin Darke\n\nHarry Potter is a grown-up now. Although at 5’5” it doesn’t look that obvious. Two years after the release of the last movie in the franchise, wizarding star, Daniel Radcliffe, went on to explore some mighty different showbiz ventures. He starred in various movies, including the critically-acclaimed Swiss Army Man. In one of his recent projects, Kill Your Darlings, he plays the famous Beat poet, Allen Ginsberg. It was on the set of this film that he also happened to meet the love of his life.\n\nErin Darke is a fellow actor, starring regularly in both film and theatre. She is also known as Cindy, in Good Girls Revolt. After meeting on set, Darke and Radcliffe started a relationship that would go on for six years and counting. Although Darke is two inches taller than Radcliffe, they seem to be going strong. No spells or love potions needed for this one!\n\nKristen Stewart & Robert Pattinson\n\nYou would be lying if you said you’d never heard of this tumultuous Twilight duo. The on-screen mortal-vampire couple made it real in 2009. It’s undeniable that fans of Twilight surged in number when they found out. Stewart and Pattinson kept it hidden pretty well for a long time, and denied it even in the face of a plethora of photos showing their obvious affection for each other.\n\nPattinson towered over Stewart by more than 6 inches. That certainly drew more attention whenever they tried to discreetly go out at the time. Finally, in 2012, Pattinson disclosed it to the public; he was in a relationship with Stewart. But that was also just moments from the end. Pattinson’s heart was painfully and publicly broken after US Weekly released photos of Stewart with (married) director, Rupert Sanders. Sad but, unfortunately, true.\n\nHayden Panettiere and Wladimir Klitschko\n\nProfessional boxer, Wladimir Klitschko (6'6\"), married Hayden Panettiere (5'0\"), the American actress who starred as Claire Bennet in Heroes. Klitschko’s real-life cheerleader might be 18 inches shorter than him, but who cares? Aside from the huge height difference, they also have a 13-year age gap.\n\nDespite the age and height issues, Klitschko and Panettiere are happily married. In 2014, they welcomed a new member to the family. Hayden gave birth to their lovely first daughter named Kaya. They don’t seem to mind that Kaya might possibly inherit her dad’s height. Unfortunately though, after nine long years, the couple decided to call it quits. Oh well, at least they'll always have Kaya.\n\nDannii Minogue and Kris Smith\n\nDannii Minogue is an Australian singer, model, and actress responsible for the songs “Love and Kisses,” “Jump to the Beat,” and “Baby Love,” to name a few. While she stood only a couple of inches, about five foot tall, her singing career was definitely shooting up to far greater heights. Since stepping away from the microphone, she’s taken on judging and mentoring roles, with X-Factor UK and Australia’s Got Talent.\n\nIn 2008, the famous singer dated English model and rugby player, Kris Smith. They met during Smith’s 30th birthday and, two years of romance later, Minogue’s pregnancy was announced to the public. Their son, Ethan Edward Minogue-Smith, was delivered via Cesarean Section. Despite having a baby and doing great in their careers, they still decided to go their separate ways. But surely their 11-inch height difference couldn’t have contributed to the split?\n\nBella Hadid and The Weeknd\n\nBella Hadid and The Weeknd are two of the biggest names in showbiz. Their tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship (currently off) made lots of headlines for a while. While their height difference is only an inch, Bella is the taller one, meaning her penchant for high heels leaves the Weeknd regularly craning his neck to look up at her. Neither of them seemed to mind this though, and Bella wasn’t going to give up her shoes.\n\nWhen they were together, The Weeknd was incredibly supportive of Hadid, always getting to his feet whenever Bella walked down the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show runway. He even sat with Bella’s mom when she was in attendance. When it was The Weeknd’s turn to take to the stage, Bella was equally supportive and joined the concert crowd to sing along to The Weeknd’s songs.\n\nShaquille O’Neal and Laticia Rolle\n\nShaquille O’Neal is a world-renowned, American professional basketball player who stands at 7’1”. After 19 years on the court, he became a sports analyst on Inside the NBA. Outside his basketball career, he’s also arguably successful as a media personality. Everything seems to work for the big guy, including love.\n\nShaq has been with his longtime girlfriend, Laticia Rolle, since 2014. At 5’6”, the former NBA star dwarfs Laticia. But these two don’t seem bothered by the space that stretches between them. Instead of picking on their differences, these two focused more on their similar interests. In high school and college, Laticia was also a basketball superstar. We bet their one-on-one driveway games were fierce. Sadly, the two split and Shaquille is now happily married to Shaunie O'Neal.\n\nRod Stewart and Penny Lancaster\n\nBritish rock singer and songwriter, Rod Stewart, had been married twice before he met photographer and model, Penny Lancaster. It seems like this rock star has a type. His previous wives, Alana Stewart, and Rachel Hunter, were both taller than him. Penny is no different, standing a good few inches taller than Stewart.\n\nThe couple met when Rod Stewart offered Penny Lancaster the role of photographer on one of his tours, in 1999. Eventually, they fell in love and celebrated the birth of their first child, in November 2005. In 2007, they made a joint decision to lead their relationship to the altar. Four years later, they celebrated the birth of their second child. Stewart and Lancaster stayed true to their vows and have fallen even more in love since.\n\nLady Gaga & Taylor Kinney\n\nOf course, we know Lady Gaga for all her quirks, her unique music videos, and yeah, her height. Gaga stands at a miniature 5’1”. Even when decked out in the fiercest of heels, her diminutive stature is glaringly obvious. So much more so, when she stood alongside her American actor and model boyfriend, Taylor Jacks Kinney.\n\nYou may know Kinney from his portrayal of Mason Lockwood, in The Vampire Diaries. He met Gaga in 2011, during the filming of the music video for “You and I.” WIth sparks flying between them, they decided to give romance a try and began dating. In 2015, they announced they were getting married. But by July 2016, they’d decided it was a bad romance. They enigmatically cited “personal reasons” as the cause of their split. And that was the end of that. Talk about poker faces!\n\nAdam Levine and Behati Prinsloo\n\nTechnically, Adam Levine is taller than his wife, Behati Prinsloo, by an inch. However, the photos seem to show otherwise. When Behati puts on her killer heels, Adam just loses the game. We all know Adam Levine as the frontman of Maroon 5. He has been an active singer since 1994. The South African Victoria’s Secret model, Behati Prinsloo, meanwhile, has spent her career killing it in the fashion and modelling industry.\n\nThe beautiful couple first met during the 2011 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. They started dating in 2012, but it was short-lived. In 2013, however, they suddenly announced their engagement. For their honeymoon, they traveled to South Africa, Prinsloo’s home country. Now, the two are happily married with two kids, Gio Grace and Dusty Rose.\n\nLevi Meaden and Ariel Winter\n\nAriel Winter became famous when she took on the role of Alex Dunphy, in Modern Family. She’s also the voice actress of Sofia, in Disney’s Sofia the First. Growing up in the spotlight means that people everywhere knew everything about her personal life from a very young age. Tat includes when she started dating Canadian actor Levi Meaden.\n\nWe’ve seen Levi Meaden in War for the Planet of the Apes, Alice in the Attic, Pacific Rim: Uprising, and a lot more. The two have since moved on to other relationships, but when they were together the fact that Meaden is 5’11” tall, while Winter is just 5’1” didn't seem to bother them in the slightest.\n\nAnna Faris & Chris Pratt\n\nChris Pratt is best known for his role as Andy Dwyer, in Parks and Recreation, and as the Star-Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy. Before he rose to fame, he met Anna Faris at the table reading for the film, Take Me Home, in 2007. She was cast as Pratt’s character’s love interest. The role, as it so often does, incarnated in real life. By 2008, they were engaged, and then were married the year after. They then decided to settle in LA, California.\n\nThe next few years became a challenge for the couple. Faris gave birth to their son, Jack, in 2012. However, he was born premature and had to be kept under thorough observation for a month. Pratt said that it tested his faith, but he and his wife continued to pray for their baby. They got through that challenge. Still, in 2017, the couple split. The divorce was finalized earlier in 2018. They have since gone on with their individual lives.\n\nSeth Green and Clare Grant\n\nNothing beats a relationship where the two of you understand each other’s humor. Even height can’t come between that kind of chemistry. Seth Green and Clare Grant felt the sparks because their senses of humor complemented each other. They first met in 2006, running into each other at the reopening of Golden Apple Comics. Since they were both comic buffs, they met again at the annual Comic-Con convention in San Diego.\n\nWhile they may not see eye to eye physically, Seth is 5’4” and Clare stands at 5’7”, the pair are perfectly on par when it comes to their interests. They both love comic books, TV, and something we also adore: fast food. With so many shared loves, the pair didn’t just team up for the Emmy award-winning animated TV show Robot Chicken, they also teamed up for life. Grant and Green became engaged in 2009 and got married in 2010.\n\nHayden Christensen & Rachel Bilson\n\nWhile we’ve given you a healthy dose of height-challenged couples who remained blissfully happy together, this list is, admittedly, full of couples who didn’t make it to the end of the line. But we’re cool with that. It’s better to leave than stay in a partnership that just ain’t working out. And this was exactly the case for our next couple. You surely know Hayden Christensen from his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker, in the Star Wars series. Rachel Bilson, meanwhile, shot to fame in The OC, then later shifted her attention to the big screen, starring in Jumper and The Last Kiss.\n\nChristensen stacks up at six foot neat, while Bilson is just two inches over five feet. While it made photos a little awkward, this height difference didn’t matter a bit for the two; they lived together in love for quite a long time. Their relationship first blossomed in Jumper, where they were unable to resist each other’s charms. In 2009, Bilson appeared in public with an engagement ring. That was when it all came out. But, by 2010, it was called off without any explanations whatsoever. The on-again-off-again pair now have a daughter, Briar Rose, who was born in 2014. However, three years after her birth, they called it quits once again.\n\nFergie and Josh Duhamel\n\nWho doesn’t know Fergie? She’s such an iconic singer we don’t even need a last name to differentiate her. We have seen her grow as a singer with the Black Eyed Peas, move into a bunch of creative collabs, and then finally branch out on her own as a solo artist. Behind this successful career, lies a happy life with her chosen family.\n\nAmerican actor, Josh Duhamel, is known for his appearances in Transformer films, Life As We Know It, Safe Haven, and most recently in Love Simon. Duhamel met Fergie on the set of his show, Las Vegas, in 2004. Fergie appeared with the Black Eyed Peas on the show, and the chemistry was immediate. The two eventually went out and, after years of dating, got married in 2009. They’ve since been gifted with a son, Axl Duhamel. And they have separated in 2018.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. first met on the set of I Know What You Did Last Summer, back in 1997. They became immensely popular 90s icons, both individually and as a much-loved couple. Prinze stands almost a full foot taller than Gellar, but that hasn’t been an obstacle for the famous pair.\n\nIn 2002, they got married and became parents to two children. People love this couple for having stayed strong, in the crazy world of Hollywood, for more than 15 years now. And even when they decided to lie low and leave the limelight behind, people still remember them. Who could ever forget the vampire slayer? Not to mention their iconic 90s rom-coms that went straight to every teenager’s heart. This is one couple that will always stay in the heart of their 90s-film-loving fans.\n\nMegan Fox & Machine Gun Kelly\n\nThere may be a huge age and height difference between these two, but it seems, for the lovebirds, that doesn’t change a thing. MGK and Megan Fox began dating in June 2020. More than a year after their first public outing, Fox and Kelly appear to be going strong.\n\nOne of the biggest things that people notice about Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox as a couple is the fact that they have such a huge height difference between them. In fact, he stands at 6‘4\" while she stands at 5’4”. He is literally an entire foot taller than her!\n\nCarmelo Anthony and La La Anthony\n\nAs a basketball player, Carmelo Anthony towers over most people, at 6’8”. This doesn’t look unusual on the court, amongst his fellow basketball-playing giants. But when you put someone who’s only 5’6” beside Anthony, you immediately understand just how big the guy is.\n\nThis is everyday life for American TV personality, La La Anthony, because she just so happens to be Carmelo’s wife. When they’re together, the basketball superstar can’t look like anything other than a giant. This doesn’t seem to bother the pair, though. They’re both busy working on their high-profile careers. Despite the busy schedules, they make sure that their priorities are well-set with both, insisting that their son always comes first. ”We are the best of friends and our number one commitment is to our 10-year-old son, Kiyan,” La La said. How sweet!\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith\n\nThere’s actually a lot going on behind the movie scenes for celebrities. Off cam, some love teams make it real. Let’s take the Smith couple for example. Will Smith first met Jada when she auditioned for a role in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. She wanted to take the role of Will Smith’s character’s wife, Lisa Wilkes. Unfortunately, Jada didn’t make the cut.\n\nDid you know why Jada wasn’t accepted for the role? They said that she was too short and so wouldn’t make a believable fit for Smith! She had to stand next to a 6’2” guy which would make framing a nightmare for the camera operators. Ironically, this couple, that were told they made no sense in TV land, ended up becoming husband and wife in real life. Jada took on an irreplaceable role in Will’s life and they’ve been defying the declaration of the television executives ever since.\n\nReese Witherspoon and Jake Gyllenhaal\n\nIt’s Reese again! The actress also dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal, after they met in 2007, on the set of the film Rendition. Actors seem to spend a lot of time falling in love with each other on movie sets. These two were not exceptions.\n\nGyllenhaal is a full 10 inches taller than Witherspoon. Reese just makes it over the 5 foot mark, at 5’1”, while Jake towers at 5’11”. The difference was adorably obvious when photos of them dating were released in the media. But when you’re overflowing with love for each other, who has time to bother with metrics?\n\nAshley Tisdale and Christopher French\n\nThe High School Musical fans out there will surely remember Sharpay Evans. She’s so over Troy and Gabriella. Like, seriously. She’s happy with her new partner in life, Christopher French. Our Sharpay Evans looks so cute next to French, even though he’s more than a foot taller than her.\n\nAfter graduating from High School Musical, Ashley Tisdale didn’t stop making music. In fact, she works it out with her boyfriend. Christopher French is the lead singer for Annie Automatic, an LA-based alt rock band. The two started dating in 2012, and their love seems to still be going strong. Their mutual musical inclinations surely share some of the credit. Ashley Tisdale has already released two studio albums. For her third, she is working with French. Something for Sharpay Evans fans to watch out for!\n\nSam Cooper & Lily Allen\n\nSmile! It’s time to take a look at the lovely little Lily Allen. At 5’2”, the singer certainly looks small when she poses near her hubby, Sam Cooper, who stands ten inches taller at 6’0”. Lily started dating Sam in July, 2009. The following year, they announced that they were welcoming an addition to their family.\n\nUnfortunately, Allen’s pregnancy had some complications. On her sixth month of carrying the baby, she contracted a viral infection. Sadly, their little one never got a chance to see the world. Lily was, understandably, diagnosed with PTSD as a result of the incident. But, with time, the brave couple were able to move on. In fact, in 2010, they got engaged, and were then married in 2011. They now have two daughters, Ethel and Marnie. However, the two recently decided to end their marriage due to Sam’s reported infidelity.\n\nChris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky\n\nMeasuring in at 6’3”, Chris Hemsworth was made for the role of Thor, the God of Thunder. He’s got the acting chops, the charisma, and the height required to play an ancient deity.\n\nIn real life, Hemsworth found an equally astonishing goddess, with all the requisite features… apart from the towering height. Spanish actress and model, Elsa Pataky, stands at 5’3”. That’s a whole foot shorter than Hemsworth, but it’s no big deal to this heavenly duo. It seems like not a force on Earth could come between the two. They even tied the knot soon after they first met, in 2010. That was a great move for the couple. Now, after a few years of marriage, they have one daughter and two sons.\n\nJay Cutler and Kristin Cavallari\n\nThe gift of height is not just for basketball players. Football players are also huge. Retired football quarterback, Jay Cutler, played for more than 10 seasons in the NFL. He stands out in the field at 6’3”. That’s a foot taller than his wife Kristin Cavallari, an American TV personality and actress.\n\nCutler and Cavallari began dating in 2010. A year later, they announced their engagement. There were some issues during the engagement but they still pushed through. In 2013, they finally got married. At present, they are very happy to have two sons and a daughter in their lives.\n\nZendaya and Tom Holland\n\nThis couple isn’t official yet, but as fans, we’d like to believe that they are together. The pair came to life during the Spider Man: Homecoming film. Zendaya and Tom Holland play classmates in the Marvel film. Holland as Peter Parker and the Spider Man, and Zendaya as Michelle. Their love story has yet to bloom, but there was definitely a spark. When they attended the red carpet premiere of the film together, the height difference between them became more apparent. Zendaya actually stands two inches taller than Holland.\n\nThese two seem very fond of each other. The biggest scoop about them was when Tom Holland was seen leaving Zendaya’s house… with a suitcase. What could that mean? Fans went crazy with speculation after the photos were released online. But until now, Zendaya and Holland haven’t disclosed what the real story between them is.\n\nSalma Hayek & Edward Norton\n\nEdward Norton is known for being quite picky about the roles he takes on (though he seems to have a bizarre penchant for characters with more than one personality). He has been nominated for multiple awards, thanks to his stellar performances. After a few years in showbiz, he crossed paths with another performer, who would come to play an important role in his life.\n\nMexican film actress and model, Salma Hayek, got her start in telenovelas and other films. She too has received a wealth of nominations thanks to her captivating performances. While she has starred alongside many handsome leading men, 6’0” tall Norton made a lasting impression on her. The pair dated for a few years, but perhaps the constant neck strain of looking up at her beau took a toll on Hayek, as the pair split before things got too serious.\n\nMiley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth\n\nSince Chris Hemsworth is on this list, it would feel wrong if we didn’t include his 6’3” brother, Liam Hemsworth. While he was partnered up with Miley Cyrus, their height difference was already pretty obvious. The media released plenty of photos of them dating in real life at the time. However, like many of their Hollywood cohorts, the couple fell into the on-and-off-again dating trap.\n\nTheir longest breakup was huge news in showbiz. Miley cut her hair and released the Wrecking Ball album. Fans were deeply saddened by the split. Not too long after the breakup, the two suddenly announced a wedding! Since then, however, they have managed to split up again.\n\nLisa Bonet and Jason Momoa\n\nThe Game of Thrones fan kingdom was collectively devastated when Khal Drogo passed away. Daenerys lost her sun and stars, and the moon of her life. But outside of the GoT universe, the actor behind Khal Drogo, Jason Momoa, has his own life. From 2017 to 2022, he called actress Lisa Bone his sun, stars, and moon.\n\nBonet is 5'2\" and 12 years older than Momoa, but he stands taller than her at 6’4”. Nevertheless, the couple didn’t really concern themselves with their height and age differences. Momoa even took on the role of stepfather to Bonet’s daughter, Zoe. Bonet had Zoe with her previous husband, rockstar Lenny Kravitz. Today, Momoa and Bonet co-parent two children though they are no longer married.\n\nKourtney Kardashian & Scott Disick\n\nLast one for the Kardashians, we promise! We apparently need to keep up with them, so it’s important to check out the latest updates, no? It seems Khloe isn’t the only one who’s fond of tall boys. Her sister, Kourtney is, too. From a young age, Kourtney was killing it as a successful businesswoman and model. And it was in this industry that she met Scott Disick. He also dabbles in the world of business and works as a model for supplements and books. He’s also really tall, like really. Taller than Kourtney by 11 inches.\n\nIn 2006, Kardashian and Disick met at a house party in Mexico. They were, like so many celebrities before them, into the whole on-and-off kind of relationship. But all of that changed in 2009, when Kourtney gave birth to Mason Dash Disick, their first child. The delivery was even aired in Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Disick tried to propose multiple times, but always got shot down before he could follow through. In 2012, they had their second child, Penelope Scotland Disick. And then, Reign Aston Disick followed as the third child, in 2014. It felt like everything was going to be alright between the pair. And, let’s face it, Scott’s roasting of the Kardashian clan was the most entertaining part of their show. However, in 2015, the couple sadly declared that it was the end. In 2022 Kourtney tied the knot with new love Travis Barker in Portofino, Italy. Go Kourt!\n\nCameron Diaz and Benji Madden\n\nWho doesn’t know Cameron Diaz? She’s a big-time star in Hollywood and stands at 5'9\". She has made a name for herself in movies like \"Charlie’s Angels,\" \"Shrek,\" and \"There’s Something About Mary.\" Now that the towering, blonde beauty is fresh in your mind, it’s time for you to meet this musician who, according to Cameron, makes her life feel complete.\n\nNicole Richie played matchmaker for Cameron and Good Charlotte frontman, Benji Madden. Cameron said yes to Madden’s marriage proposal in 2015, despite the obvious height difference. Cameron stands taller than Madden by 2 inches. After a whopping 17 day engagement, the happy couple was married. Three years later, Cameron decided to retire from acting."
