        "text": "Thor: Love and Thunder was all about Jane Foster and the God of Thunder rekindling their romance. However, it seems as though Chris Hemsworth managed to sneak in a loving cameo from his wife Elsa Pataky.\n\nIt’s no secret that Elsa Pataky has been a common player in the Thor franchise, having been the kissing double for Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster in The Dark World and appearing as a servant washing Chris Hemsworth in Ragnarok. A new image from Love and Thunder gives fans their best look yet as Pataky’s cameo as the wolf-woman kissed by Hemsworth in the film’s opening.\n\nIt seems as though Thor: Love and Thunder was a fun film to work on for Chris Hemsworth, especially if he got to kiss his wife in a werewolf costume. However, between Elsa Pataky’s cameo and the screaming goats, Hemsworth suggests the fun they had on set may have led to the film’s mixed reviews. While it’s unclear where Thor will go next in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it’s certain Hemsworth will have his wife along for the ride.\n\nIs Chris Hemsworth returning to the role of Thor?\n\nWhen asked about his future as Thor, Hemsworth remained tight-lipped, stating that he is eagerly awaiting Marvel’s creative direction. “I’m waiting to see what they have to offer creatively [and] if there is something new,” he teased\n\nThe synopsis of Thor: Love and Thunder reads as follows:\n\nThe film finds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey unlike anything he’s ever faced – a quest for inner peace. But his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who – to Thor’s surprise – inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher’s vengeance and stop him before it’s too late.\n\nDirected by Taika Waititi and produced by Kevin Feige and Brad Winderbaum, Love and Thunder stars Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, Jaimie Alexander, Taika Waititi, Russell Crowe, Natalie Portman, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper."
