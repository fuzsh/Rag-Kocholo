Hemsworth and Pataky married during the Christmas holidays in 2010. They have three children together: a daughter, India Rose, born in May 2012, and twin sons, Tristan and Sasha, born in March 2014. In 2015, Hemsworth and Pataky moved from Los Angeles to Byron Bay in his native Australia.\n\nIn March 2021, along with the film's announcement, Hemsworth was revealed be an executive producer in Matthew Reilly's directing debut film, the Netflix production Interceptor, which would also star his wife Elsa in the leading role. Upon the film's release in June 2022, it was revealed that Hemsworth had also filmed an extended cameo for the film, appearing as Jed.
