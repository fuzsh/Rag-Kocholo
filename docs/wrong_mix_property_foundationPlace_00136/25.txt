✵ Preface

T

he encouraging reception from students and instructors to the previous editions of Contending Voices: Biographical Explorations of the American Past has led me to create a third edition. As before, this book uses paired biographies to bring alive the debates and disagreements that have shaped American history. It is based on the assumption that students find history more engaging when they realize that it is full of conflict. Through biography, individual men and women emerge from the tangle of events, dates, and facts that often make history so challenging for students. Following the organization of most survey texts, each chapter examines two individuals who stood on different sides of an important issue. Their stories, combined with a small set of primary sources in each chapter, show students how individuals—from the pre-English settlement of the New World to the present—influenced their times and were influenced by them. At the same time, the book’s biographical approach naturally incorporates political, social, economic, cultural, religious, and diplomatic histories while underscoring the diversity of those who shaped the past. This biographical approach highlights competing perspectives, prompting students to think about issues from multiple viewpoints. The biographical essays that introduce the Sources were written with these pedagogical goals in mind. Although students will encounter familiar names in these pages, many of the thirty individuals in each of Contending Voices’ two volumes rarely appear in survey texts. All of them, however, addressed significant events and issues of their times. In Volume I, sixteenth-century conquistador Hernán Cortés and Dominican priest Bartolomé de Las Casas contest the fate of Native Americans. In the seventeenth century, the pitched battles between Governor William Berkeley and rebel Nathaniel Bacon reveal forces shaping early Virginia. Other chapters illuminate the Great Awakening, the American Revolution, and the ratification of the Constitution. Later, the life-and-death conflict Between William Henry Harrison and Tecumseh reflects the larger struggle between Whites and Indians sparked by westward expansion in the early nineteenth century. In the same period, chapters pairing union organizer Sarah Bagley with industrialist Nathan Appleton and Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado of Mexican California with merchant Thomas Larkin focus on the rise of the factory system and Manifest Destiny. At mid-century, George Fitzhugh and Hinton Rowan Helper debate slavery’s impact

PREFACE

on the South and reveal deep fears at the heart of a growing sectional conflict. Still later, antiwar Democrat Clement Vallandigham and radical Republican Benjamin Wade demonstrate the limits of dissent during the Civil War. New biographies in Volume I include newspaper editor Benjamin Franklin Bache who highlights the conflict between Federalists and Republicans in the 1790s, and Wade Hampton, who led a Democratic assault on the Republican Reconstruction government of South Carolina, illustrating the limits of Reconstruction. Volume II offers a similar diversity of individuals and topics. The new biographies in Volume II feature Samuel Gompers, who squared off against Terence Powderly in a battle to define the American labor movement in the late nineteenth century, and Richard Clarke and John Yoo, who clashed over the Bush administration’s “war on terror.” In the early twentieth century, the radically different views of home economics pioneer Ellen Richards and anarchist Emma Goldman illuminate both progressive reform and the changing role of women in American society. Antiwar critic Randolph Bourne and war propagandist George Creel further illuminate aspects of progressive reform as well as the new power of advertising and the effects of World War I on American society. Japanese-American internee Harry Ueno and internment director Dillon Myer illustrate the experience of Japanese relocation during World War II. Later battles are brought to life in chapters pairing civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer with black leader Roy Wilkins; women’s rights champion Betty Friedan with feminist Gloria Steinem; and Interior Secretary James Watt with novelist Edward Abbey. They illustrate the challenges confronting the civil rights, women’s, and environmental movements and the conflicts dividing them. While permitting easy access to often unfamiliar topics, Contending Voices is also designed to build students’ critical thinking skills. Each chapter begins with a brief essay providing an introduction to the lives and ideas of the two individuals who held conflicting views on an important issue. The essay does not offer a complete accounting of subjects’ lives—an impossible task—but focuses instead on aspects that illuminate the chapter’s main topic. Each essay begins with a short vignette designed to capture the reader’s attention and includes a running glossary, which defines terms that may be unfamiliar to many survey students. A set of four to seven primary sources illustrating and amplifying the chapter’s central themes follows each essay. These sources demonstrate the variety of sources historians use to understand the past and reflect another premise behind this book—that the best way for students to learn history is to explore it themselves. Their explorations are assisted by a brief set of Questions to Consider following the primary sources. In addition, references to each primary source appear in the essays, helping to integrate the primary and secondary material. A brief introduction to each primary source also aids student analysis. Finally, a brief Further Reading section contains both biographical and general works that will help interested students explore each chapter topic further. Many people made valuable contributions to these volumes. At the College of Southern Nevada (CSN), Charles Okeke offered welcome encouragement, while administrative assistants Arlene Menezes and Alaina Priscu provided technical assistance. As usual, CSN Interlibrary Loan Librarian Marion Martin cheerfully and efficiently tracked down the needed material. At Cengage Learning, Megan Curry and Megan Chrisman oversaw the revision process and brought deft hands to the manuscript. Margaret Bridges carefully guided the manuscript through the production phase, while Jennifer Meyer Dare worked diligently to secure appropriate images. Numerous colleagues around the country reviewed these chapters and offered many useful ideas, suggestions, and criticisms. These volumes benefited greatly from their

✵ The Cross and the Sword in Spain’s New World: Bartolomé de Las Casas and Hernán Cortés

T

he pulse of the sixty-six-year-old Bartolomé de Las Casas quickened as he stepped into the court of King Charles I of Spain in 1540. The Catholic friar could not suppress his nervous anticipation. After all, he carried to Charles a story of bloody conquest and naked exploitation that the monarch would surely find shocking. In the half century since Columbus’s voyage of discovery in 1492, Spanish conquerors claimed vast portions of the New World and put millions of its native inhabitants under Spain’s yoke. Las Casas knew that none of these men figured more prominently in Spain’s conquest than Hernán Cortés. In 1519, the young conquistador marched fewer than six hundred Spanish soldiers into the Aztec Empire in central Mexico and took it over. In little time, the area represented the heart of Spain’s vast empire in the New World. Las Casas was aware that Cortés and other conquerors brought great wealth and glory to His Majesty’s realm. Yet he believed that there was much more to the story of Spain’s conquest of the New World. Las Casas was no stranger to the New World. After arriving in the West Indies in 1502, he lived there on and off for the next four decades. He sought passage to the Indies to make his fortune and along with many other Spaniards secured the right to control the labor of numerous Indians for his own benefit. As a young colonist, he seemed destined to live as a prosperous West Indian planter. Life in the New World took a strange turn, though. Less than a decade after his arrival there, Las Casas heard the call of the priesthood. Then a few years after his ordination, he heeded another call. Increasingly troubled by the cruelty of many Spaniards toward the Indians, Las Casas denounced the system by which his countrymen held many native people and renounced

his own grant of Indian laborers. Then he proceeded to make it his life’s work to defend the Indians and challenge the Spaniards’ treatment of them. Now as he stepped into the royal court, he was ready to lay before his king the gruesome details of the Spanish extermination of the Indians and the conquistadors’ brutal rule over the survivors. Among the “tyrants” he singled out was the founder of New Spain, Hernán Cortés. Impressed as Cortés was by the way the Aztecs lived, Mexico’s conqueror had no doubt that they should be converted by the sword and then be made to serve his—and his nation’s—ends. After conquering the Aztecs, Cortés grew rich and powerful from his exploitation of Native American labor, inspiring other Spaniards to conquer millions more Indians. The conquistadors exacted an awful price from their victims, and now Las Casas pleaded with the Spanish king to take control of the Indians away from these greedy men. As he stood in His Majesty’s court, he believed that the fate of the New World’s native population was at stake.

“THE INDIANS HAVE SLAIN LAS CASAS!” Bartolomé de Las Casas’s connections to the New World and its native inhabitants began almost as soon as Spain’s encounter with them. Las Casas was born in 1474 in the southwestern Spanish town of Seville. The son of a merchant who had fallen on hard times, Bartolomé was eighteen years old in 1493 when he witnessed Columbus’s triumphant procession through the streets of his hometown after the latter had returned from his first voyage to the New World. Later that same year, Las Casas’s father and uncle shipped out

with Columbus on his second voyage and were among the first colonists to settle in Hispaniola.* When Bartolomé’s father returned to Spain in 1498, he brought along a present for his son: a Taino Indian servant from Hispaniola. We do not know the young man’s reaction to this gift, but his imagination must have been fired by tales of Columbus’s adventures. In 1502, when he was twenty-eight, Las Casas sailed with his father to the West Indies. With a university education in Latin, he was qualified to hold the position of doctrinero, or teacher of Christian doctrine. As such, he would earn an ample salary and was able to acquire property. As soon as Las Casas’s ship reached Santo Domingo,* he discovered that there were plenty of opportunities to do just that. He immediately heard the news that gold had been discovered on the island and that a war with the Tainos had produced a large number of slaves to mine it. Years before, the Tainos had impressed Columbus with their meekness and hospitality. It had not taken long, however, for friendly relations between the Spaniards and Tainos to descend into a nightmare of slaughter and enslavement. Here and elsewhere in the West Indies, Columbus had set in motion a series of events that would have devastating consequences for the New World’s native peoples. Periodically, his men kidnapped Tainos “to learn the secrets of the land.” In 1494, Columbus dispatched his first human cargo from the New World to be sold at the slave market in Seville. Later that year, his men launched a savage attack on the Tainos that resulted in the destruction of villages, the killing of countless people, and the shipment of five hundred more slaves to Spain. By the time Las Casas arrived in Hispaniola, many Tainos were working as forced laborers for the Spaniards in the mines and fields. These practices may shock modern sensibilities, but they reflected the attitudes of Spanish culture at the time. Unlike most of Europe, southern Spain had not done away with slavery by the late fifteenth century. That area had been a stronghold of the Moors—Muslims from North Africa who had invaded Spain in the eighth century and occupied parts of it until the late fifteenth century. The Spaniards viewed the invaders as infidels—that is, non-Christians—and as such inferior. They applied the same views to the native inhabitants of the Caribbean islands. To the Spaniards, these people—living without cities, clothes, private property, or any concept of economically productive work—appeared utterly irresponsible and uncivilized. Moreover, as Christians, the Spaniards saw these strangers who worshiped numerous gods as heathens. By the late fifteenth century, the Spaniards, who viewed Africans in the same way, began to import African slaves to the West Indies to replace the native workers who had succumbed to Old World diseases and Spanish cruelty. In the fifty years following Columbus’s arrival, the Indian population fell by perhaps 90 percent. In the fifteenth century alone, Spanish and Portuguese slave traders shipped as many as a quarter of a million Africans to the West Indies to fill this void. As Las Casas settled down in the West Indies, he gave no indication that he disagreed with the Spaniards’ attitudes toward the Indians. Shortly after arriving there, he helped to suppress several Indian uprisings and was rewarded with an encomienda—a grant of land and the native people living on it. In theory, the encomenderos—the recipients of these grants—were responsible for the protection of the people entrusted to them and for their introduction to Christianity. But in reality, the encomienda system was nothing more

than slavery. Ambitious and energetic, Las Casas had few qualms about this arrangement. In fact, when a group of Dominican* friars arrived on Hispaniola in 1510, Las Casas was unmoved by their arguments against the colonists’ mistreatment of the Indians. Even Las Casas’s decision to become a priest the same year did not lead immediately to his rejection of the encomienda system. In early 1512, he joined an expedition led by a military adventurer named Diego Velásquez who was already engaged in the conquest of the neighboring island of Cuba. Serving as chaplain, he witnessed the slaughter of hundreds of Indians that, he said, left “a stream of blood running … as if a great number of cows had perished.” Las Casas attempted to stop the massacre, but without success. Afterward, however, he accepted an encomienda on Cuba, where he prospered by farming and raising cattle. Within a few years, Las Casas began to have doubts about the treatment of the native people. The turning point came as he was preparing a sermon after discussing the plight of the Indians with some Dominicans who shared his concerns. As he thumbed through the Bible, his eyes fell on this passage: “Tainted his gifts who offers in sacrifice ill-gotten goods.” Las Casas was unable to get these words out of his mind, and he finally concluded that everything done to the people of the West Indies was “unjust and tyrannical.” Committed now to giving up his own Indian slaves, he soon delivered his first sermon denouncing the treatment of the islanders. In fact, the Indians posed a thorny problem for Spanish Christians. Like the Moors, the New World’s natives were outsiders captured in battle. Unlike the Moors, they were not stubborn infidels, but people capable of salvation. At the same time, Indian labor was the key to extracting the New World’s wealth. Indeed, making the natives economically productive was essential to “civilizing” them. In 1512, King Ferdinand had called a group of jurists and theologians together to consider what to do about the Indians. The group called for the teaching of Christian doctrine to the native people, but it also offered Ferdinand a powerful justification for Indian service. Because of their “natural lack of understanding,” the Indians were unable to rule themselves. They could not be considered slaves, but for their own good, they would have to “work for those who govern them.” Shortly thereafter, Ferdinand issued the Laws of Burgos, the first royal confirmation of the encomienda system. These laws contained provisions to prevent the abuse of Indian laborers, but those provisions were largely ignored. Spain was a poor country, and the impoverished Spanish crown had an obvious interest in the gold mines of the West Indies. Moreover, numerous royal officials had a vested interest in the encomienda system. Indeed, Ferdinand was the largest holder of Indians in the New World. Thus the Laws of Burgos salved Spanish consciences, but wealth continued to flow out of the West Indies, and the natives continued to die in the mines and fields. In contrast to most of his countrymen, Las Casas believed that the Indians, despite their primitive mode of living, were rational beings with “excellent, subtle, and very capable minds.” Like other clerics, he never doubted the need to save the Indians by making them economically productive. But he also knew that their way of life poorly fitted them for servitude. Slavery did not “civilize” the Indians; it killed them. They could be converted and civilized only through “love and tenderness.” Determined to see the encomienda system destroyed, Las Casas returned to Spain in 1515 and gained an audience with Ferdinand. Within weeks, however, Ferdinand was dead. When Las Casas then took his case to officials in charge of Spanish affairs in the New World, he got the cold shoulder.

In response, Las Casas devised a remarkable plan to save the people of the New World by scrapping the encomienda system. Under his plan, the Indians would live in their own villages, learn to govern themselves, and claim a share of the profits of their labor. They would also be treated in a humane manner, although they would continue to work for the Spanish settlers and produce revenue for the Crown. For Hispaniola, where the native population had already been largely destroyed, he proposed an alternative plan. Spanish peasants would be sent to the island to work alongside, and eventually intermarry with, the surviving Indians. Las Casas endorsed the importation of African slaves to do heavy labor and to compensate the colonists who had lost their encomiendas. He seemed to have few qualms about enslaving Africans, perhaps because he believed that Africans could better endure the rigors of slavery, or perhaps because Africans were more “outlandish” to him than the Native Americans he was so eager to save. Las Casas presented his plan to Francisco Jiménez, the cardinal of Spain and the regent* of the young King Charles I.* In response to Las Casas’s proposals, Jiménez named him “Protector of the Indians,” and royal authorities issued orders granting free passage and land to Spanish peasants who immigrated to the West Indies. Las Casas soon learned, however, that the great landowners in Spain had no desire to lose their tenants. Forced to abandon his plan, Las Casas developed an even grander scheme to save the Indians. Battling colonial agents at court for a year, he finally secured a grant of land running about eight hundred miles along the coast of Venezuela. Only a few missionaries had penetrated the area, and thus the native inhabitants had been spared the fate of the Tainos. Under Las Casas’s plan, the Indians would be converted and live in towns. He knew that any successful effort to save the Indians had to profit the Spaniards, so he promised to the Crown handsome revenues resulting from the production of gold and various trade items. Las Casas’s model community was doomed to failure, however. When he set sail from Spain in 1520, he was accompanied by seventy condemned men escaping punishment. Shortly after he arrived in Venezuela, he sailed to Santo Domingo in an attempt to stop Spanish slave traders’ continued attacks on the Indians there. A few days after he left Venezuela, the Indians killed several Spaniards and burned a monastery. When his ship landed at the wrong end of Hispaniola, he was forced to walk across the island to Santo Domingo. As he walked, people told him the news from Venezuela: “The Indians … have slain the cleric Bartolomé de Las Casas and all his household!” Las Casas was stunned. He had compromised his principles, he believed, when he threw in with the Spaniards, who were interested only in money. Taking the news from Venezuela as “a divine judgment,” and no longer confident that he had been chosen to save the Indians, he decided to turn his back on the world. In 1522, he entered the Dominican monastery in Santo Domingo and the next year took his vows as a Dominican friar. To “all appearances,” as Las Casas himself put it, for the next eleven years he “slept.” As he dozed off, Hernán Cortés was putting millions of Indians under Spain’s yoke.

“A VAST MULTITUDE OF CORPSES” Hernán Cortés was a restless man of action. Born in Medellín* in 1485, the son of an army commander, young Hernán was sent off to study Latin and law at the same university attended by Las Casas. Two years later, at the age of sixteen, he returned to Medellín, convinced that his future lay in the military. In 1504, still only nineteen, Cortés sailed for the West Indies, landing in Santo Domingo. Soon after his arrival, like Las Casas, he participated in an expedition under the command of Diego Velásquez to crush an Indian revolt. He distinguished himself in the fighting and, again like Las Casas, was rewarded with an encomienda. For six years, he enjoyed life as a planter. Then in 1511, he accompanied Velásquez’s expedition to conquer Cuba—the same expedition that left Las Casas shocked by the carnage he witnessed. Rewarded with another encomienda, Cortés settled in the seaport of Santiago, in southwestern Cuba. In the years since Columbus’s first voyage to the New World, the Spaniards had seized control of the West Indies, visited Florida, and probed the coasts of Central and South America. Strangely, however, they had never sailed due west from Cuba. Then in 1517, an expedition in search of more Indians to work Cuba’s mines and fields did just that, landing on the Yucatán, a peninsula extending northward into the Caribbean Sea from southern Mexico. When the expedition returned to Cuba the following year with gold and other treasure, Velásquez immediately outfitted another group, which returned with still more gold and the knowledge that the Yucatán was not, as previously thought, an island. Determined to discover what lay to the north of this peninsula, Velásquez turned to Cortés to lead a third expedition. The restless encomendero seized the opportunity. To finance the voyage, he borrowed heavily and even pledged his encomienda as collateral. Cortés set sail in early 1519 with an armada of 11 ships carrying 553 soldiers, 4 cannon, and a banner that read, “Friends, let us follow the cross with true faith, with which we will conquer.” His orders were to explore further, rescue any Spaniards captured by the Indians during the earlier expeditions, find any gold and silver he could, and colonize the area if conditions were favorable. The fleet made its way to Cozumel, an island off the northeastern tip of the Yucatán. There Cortés encountered people living very differently from the primitive West Indians. For the first time, he saw native cities and evidence of a highly organized society. These Indians were descendants of the Mayas, who had built a complex civilization in southern Mexico and Guatemala between the sixth and tenth centuries. Like other Mesoamerican* peoples, the Mayas built stone structures, lived in cities, and used sophisticated agricultural techniques. They also worshiped numerous gods and practiced human sacrifice, both of which were shocking and incomprehensible to the Spaniards. Although he was no priest, Cortés took his Catholic faith seriously. The product of a militantly religious society, he was driven by his duty as a Christian warrior to bring these heathens to God. After entering one blood-splattered temple, for example, he smashed the idols inside, erected a cross, and ordered a priest to say Mass. Before his conquest was over, he would strike down many more Native American idols. Sailing on, Cortés’s party soon landed near the mouth of the Tabasco River on the Gulf of Mexico. When the native Tabascans gave the Spaniards a hostile reception, the Spaniards brought their horses and superior arms to bear, killing more than eight hundred

Tabascans. The Indians then presented Cortés with gold and twenty young women. One of the women spoke Mayan and Nahuatl, the Aztec language. Named Malinche, she had been born into a noble Aztec family. After her father died, her mother remarried and bore a son. To make sure this son received his inheritance, her mother and stepfather sold Malinche into slavery. Now handed over by the Tabascans, she soon became Cortés’s faithful helper and lover. She also played another important role, translating Nahuatl into Mayan, which a priest rescued from the Yucatán then translated into Spanish. Cortés now had the means to communicate with the emperor of Mexico. As the expedition continued along the coast, Cortés heard tales of a magnificent kingdom in the interior. Anchoring at the site of modern-day Veracruz, he soon received a chief bearing gifts of gold from the Aztec emperor, Montezuma II. The Aztec leader had already heard about the battle with the Tabascans and no doubt wanted to learn more about these newcomers, their strange animals, and their weapons that made a deafening roar. Cortés told the emissary that he represented a great monarch on the other side of the ocean, information that confirmed an important Aztec myth. The Aztecs believed that a white-skinned, bearded god named Quetzalcoatl had founded the Indian race and then sailed away to the east, promising to return and reestablish his rule. The Aztec emperor may or may not have believed this myth, but he surely did not want to give up his power. The ambassador told Cortés that Montezuma did not want to see him. Cortés was undeterred. If he returned to Cuba without enough gold to pay for the voyage, he would lose his encomienda. Facing disgrace and financial ruin, he knew there was no turning back. After executing two conspirators who wished to head home, he had his men unload all the ships’ provisions; then he ordered the vessels burned. Without the possibility of retreat, the choice was now simple: the conquest of Montezuma’s empire or death. In this desperate hour, messengers arrived from the chief of the Totonacs, another Mesoamerican people who had recently been defeated by Montezuma’s warriors. Cortés was encouraged by evidence of dissension among the Indians. In August 1519, the Spaniards set off with thirteen hundred Totonac warriors for Tenochtitlán,* the capital of the Aztec Empire. It was an arduous and bloody trek. More than two hundred miles lay between the coast and the heart of Montezuma’s empire on Mexico’s central plateau. Getting there required a climb to more than 7,300 feet above sea level. Along the way, the expedition came under attack by the Tlaxcalans, another people in central Mexico subject to Aztec rule. Overwhelmed by the Spaniards’ superior arms, the Tlaxcalans decided to join the invaders. By the time Cortés marched into the Aztec religious center of Cholula, about sixty miles southeast of Tenochtitlán, his army had swollen to six thousand men. They were met by more than twenty thousand people. Warned by Malinche that the Cholulans were planning an ambush, Cortés struck first. With the aid of their Tlaxcalan allies, the Spaniards fell on the Cholulans and slaughtered them. Two days later, six thousand men, women, and children lay dead. Cortés pressed on to Tenochtitlán, arriving at its outskirts in early November. Realizing that he could not prevent the Spaniards from entering his domain, Montezuma invited the visitors into the city. The capital of an empire numbering perhaps 16 million people, Tenochtitlán was an awesome sight. With some 300,000 residents, it was larger than any city the Spaniards had ever seen. In many ways, it was also the most sophisticated. Built on an island in Lake Texcoco, it was supplied with water by

an aqueduct linked to the mainland. People and goods entered the city across three viaducts, each fortified with drawbridges. Its plaza, the site of a weekly market, could accommodate 60,000 people. In short, Tenochtitlán was the creation of a highly organized civilization. Dominated by pyramids that seemed to touch the sky, it amazed even the hard-bitten Spanish soldiers. Montezuma’s gifts of gold, silver, and jewels had the same impact. The emperor no doubt hoped that the Spaniards would be impressed by his power and generosity and then depart. Cortés had no intention of leaving, however. The Aztecs astounded Cortés with their magnificent achievements and highly organized social structure, which was similar to that of Spain. But in Cortés’s eyes, they were still barbarians. In every town on their trek to Tenochtitlán, his men had seen temples where humans were sacrificed to appease the unpredictable gods. In the Aztec capital, Montezuma took Cortés to the top of the highest pyramid, the temple of the war god Huitzilopochtli, where Cortés saw a fearsome idol covered with dried human blood. Witness to such sights, Cortés never doubted that the Aztecs were heathens—or the justice of bringing them to God by the sword. [See Source 1.] Not intimidated by Montezuma’s power, Cortés seized the emperor and held him hostage. He justified the action by claiming that some Spaniards left in defense of Veracruz had been killed by Montezuma’s men. Cortés detained the emperor for five months, while the Spaniards studied the Aztecs and surveyed their empire. Then he ordered Montezuma to gather his nobles and announce that he was submitting to the Spanish monarch. As tribute, the Spanish took huge quantities of gold objects. It seemed that Cortés had accomplished the unthinkable: the peaceful conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Aztecs began to grow restless, however, and Cortés received word that a Spanish fleet had arrived at Veracruz with orders from Diego Velásquez to return to Cuba immediately. Leaving a small force in the Aztec capital, Cortés returned to the coast to persuade this force to join him. While he was away, more than six hundred Aztec nobles and some three thousand spectators assembled in Tenochtitlán’s temple area for sacred dances. Fearing an insurrection, Spanish troops fell on the crowd. When they were finished, the courtyard was littered with bodies, and the leading Aztec nobles had been wiped out. [See Source 2.] When Cortés returned from the coast, the Aztecs were up in arms. Desperate, he forced Montezuma to appear before his people and plead for peace. But the move backfired. Many Aztecs, disillusioned with the emperor’s apparent cowardice, turned on Montezuma with stones and arrows, fatally wounding him. With his valuable hostage lost, Cortés retreated. As the Spaniards tried to escape, the Aztecs, led by Montezuma’s brother Cuitlahuac, attacked. Bogged down by gold and other loot, the Spaniards lost 450 men, 4,000 Indian confederates, and dozens of horses. In the confusion of battle, they also lost much of their treasure. Cortés barely escaped, but the Aztecs had not seen the last of him. The invaders returned to their Tlaxcalan allies, who had amassed a force of 150,000. They marched back to Tenochtitlán, slaughtering all who resisted. As smallpox raged through the empire, killing Cuitlahuac, Cortés and his army laid siege to the capital. When the Aztecs continued to hold out, Cortés decided that the only way to defeat them was to systematically destroy the city. With the assistance of his Indian allies, the Spaniards laid waste to Tenochtitlán. The siege and campaign of destruction lasted for seventy-five days. When it was over in August 1521, the Aztecs had lost perhaps 140,000 people. Their once magnificent capital was reduced to rubble, and its streets and canals were littered with “a vast multitude of corpses.” The victorious Spaniards were quickly disappointed, however. Searching for more Aztec wealth, they found little. Even torturing Cuitlahuac’s twenty-three-year-old

successor, the last Aztec emperor, produced no treasure. Frustrated in his hopes for immediate riches, Cortés organized expeditions to the outer reaches of the Aztec domain, speeding the Spanish discovery of more Mexican territory and the founding of new cities. In short order, all of the Aztec Empire was under Cortés’s command. The decimation of the Aztec lords and priests, who were often burned at the stake, hastened the consolidation of Spanish control. Accustomed to authoritarian rule, the surviving Indians quietly submitted to their new masters. The outlines of a new society quickly emerged from the ashes of the old. One characteristic—a racially mixed population—began to appear when Malinche presented Cortés with a son shortly after the conquest. Because most of the early Spanish immigrants to Mexico were male, sexual liaisons and sometimes even marriages between Spaniards and Native American women were common. In time, many more mestizos (mixed-blood children) were born. Just as Mexico City was built on the site of the destroyed Aztec capital, the new society was based on the exploitation of Indian labor. Like Mexico City, the encomiendas, which Cortés generously distributed to himself and his officers, were a symbol of one culture’s conquest of another. [See Source 3.] His own grants included twenty-two towns and perhaps as many as ninety thousand Indian vassals. Appointed governor of New Spain in 1522, Cortés lived regally. “I did not come here,” he declared, “to till the land like a peasant.”

A “TYRANNICAL PESTILENCE” As Cortés built New Spain, Bartolomé de Las Casas studied and contemplated behind monastery walls. After eleven years in retreat, he was ready to resume his role as “Protector of the Indians.” Turning to Central America, he founded a Dominican monastery in Nicaragua in 1534. After attacking the Spanish governor’s efforts to conquer the Indians there, he left to evangelize the people of Guatemala. As three military expeditions had failed to convert them, Guatemala’s governor granted Las Casas permission to use peaceful means instead. When his efforts began to bear fruit, he published The Only Method of Attracting All People to the True Faith (1537), an assault on the assumption of Cortés and other conquistadors that the Indians could not be converted unless conquered. [See Source 4.] His confidence restored, Las Casas again took up his fight against the encomienda system. After winning an audience with King Charles in 1540, Las Casas read at court his account of Spanish atrocities against the Indians. Determined to shock the king, he related revolting details of the Spaniards’ “murder and destruction” of the Indians and the “tyrannical pestilence” introduced among them. Then he called on Charles to take the revolutionary step of abolishing the encomienda system, the very basis of Spanish control of the Indians. [See Source 5.] In 1542, Charles responded by issuing the New Laws, which prohibited the enslavement of any more Indians, stripped officials of their encomiendas, and transferred other encomiendas to the Crown upon the death of their owners. Indians would be emancipated from the plantations and set on the path to freedom. Getting the New Laws on the books was one thing, but enforcing them was quite another. When Las Casas returned to the New World, he encountered the wrath of Spanish settlers. When he arrived in southern Mexico, where church officials had offered him a bishopric*, local encomenderos were up in arms over the New Laws, and colonial officials refused to enforce them. So he set off again for Spain. On his way, he visited Mexico City,

where he defended the New Laws and denounced the encomienda system before political authorities and fellow bishops. Word of his actions reached Spain, and in 1547 officials there rebuked him. Las Casas refused to back down, and the New Laws stayed on the books. By that time, the man directly responsible for the virtual enslavement of New Spain’s Indians had suffered a reversal of fortune. Cortés’s fabulous success in Mexico had sparked tremendous interest in New Spain. On the heels of his conquest came an influx of settlers, many of whom also were anxious to make their fortunes. They came to develop Mexico rather than merely loot it. That required administrators and politicians rather than soldiers. As conquest gave way to settlement, Cortés was pushed aside. He faced constant challenges to his authority and was accused of hiding part of Montezuma’s treasure and defrauding the Crown of its revenue. Under a cloud, Cortés was stripped of his governorship. Playing on Cortés’s love of conquest, Charles named him governor of the lands of the “Southern Sea”—the Pacific Ocean. Cortés outfitted several expeditions to explore the Pacific and search for a strait connecting it and the Caribbean. Little came of these voyages, although he did discover a sea between lower California and Mexico, which he named for himself. When he traveled to Spain to ask Charles to protect his remaining military power, he was met with indifference. Worn down by his struggle with Spanish authorities, he decided to stay in Spain and settle his “account with God.” Although there is no evidence that he ever regretted his conquest of the Aztecs, he told Charles in 1544 that “it is better to lose my fortune than my soul.” He never returned to the New World and in 1547 died at the age of sixty-two. By then, other conquistadors had set off in search of more Native American empires. In 1531, Francisco Pizarro and several hundred Spanish soldiers marched into the Inca Empire high in the Andes mountains along the west coast of South America. Conquering and enslaving the Incas, Pizarro and his men seized a mother lode of gold and silver. A little later, other military expeditions probed north from New Spain. In the early 1540s, Francisco Coronado searched futilely for fabled cities of gold in what would later be the southwestern United States. At about the same time, Hernando de Soto traveled into the Mississippi Valley. Inspired by Cortés’s success, these men helped Spain forge the richest European empire by the beginning of the seventeenth century. They also provided later English settlers in the New World a vivid example of the relationship between wealth and labor exploitation. Cortés played a large role in defining the nature of the Spanish experience in the New World. By imposing the encomienda system on New Spain, he sealed the fate of millions of Indians. True, the passage of the New Laws—and Las Casas’s successful efforts to keep them on the books—led to a decline of the encomienda system in the seventeenth century. But a new system of labor exploitation soon arose. Haciendas (large estates) came to be worked by Indians who were free and entitled to wages for their labor. In reality, these peons, or farm workers, quickly fell into debt and became debt slaves. The Catholic Church, New Spain’s largest landowner by the seventeenth century, supported this system of debt peonage. As Indians became tied to the land, it was easier for clerics to see them as inferior dependents. Meanwhile, black slavery continued for several centuries as well, but only on a small scale compared to that in the West Indies and other areas of the New World. Most of New Spain’s black slaves were imported in the sixteenth century and were absorbed into the larger Native American population. Indian debt peonage remained the dominant form of labor exploitation for generations. Cortés’s legacy was visible even in New Spain’s remote borderlands. By the time the Spaniards settled in Mexico’s far northern frontier at the end of the sixteenth century, their attitudes toward the Indians were already fixed. The consequences for the Indians were much the same as they had been farther south. In New Mexico, colonized by Spaniards in 1598, the Pueblo Indians rose up in revolt in 1680 against the exploitation

of their labor and efforts to wipe out their religion. When Spanish authorities regained control twelve years later, they were less zealous in fighting the Indians’ culture. Nevertheless, the Indians remained in a subservient position. In California, colonized in 1769, the Indians were virtually enslaved by the missionaries there. In fact, wherever the Spaniards settled, their assumptions about the Indians’ inferiority reinforced the basic Spanish need for labor. It was a powerful combination. The belief of Las Casas and a few other sixteenth-century clerics that Native Americans could be fully integrated into Spanish colonial society was no match for it. Las Casas continued to struggle against Spanish policies in the New World for the rest of his life. Convinced that his most important work could be done at court in Spain, he resigned his New World bishopric in 1550 and moved to a Dominican monastery in his homeland. There he fought Spanish injustices against Native Americans and Africans with his pen. Las Casas had by then changed his views about African slavery. He knew that thousands of black slaves had been imported into the New World, but not one Indian had been freed as a result. He realized that the Africans’ enslavement “was as unjust as the Indians,’” but the Indians’ fate still troubled him more. In 1552, he published his Very Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies and two years later completed a sweeping History of the Indies. Both books recounted in gruesome detail Spanish atrocities in the West Indies and Cortés’s brutal conquest of Mexico. Eventually translated into many languages, these books had a huge impact on history. In particular, they laid the foundation for the long-standing “Black Legend” that the Spaniards had the bloodiest hands of all the Europeans in the New World. Often embraced by later English and American historians to exonerate English settlers, this legend was a gross distortion. The English, of course, amassed their own bloody record against the Indians. Moreover, the Spaniards often mixed with the Indians, as Cortés’s union with Malinche demonstrates. By contrast, the English violently dispossessed the Indians of their land and pushed them away from areas of European settlement. For all his work to save the Indians, Las Casas had a greater impact on Spain’s image in the New World than on the native peoples themselves. In fact, he regretted until he died that he had not done more to affect their fate. Surely, he had had little influence on Cortés, who had established a colony with millions of Indians in bondage. Long after Las Casas died, though, his writings did have an influence on how later generations viewed Mexico’s conqueror. Although Las Casas could not see the conquest of the New World as the native peoples did, he did see those events through sympathetic eyes. Thus he left enduring images that made it easier for later historians to question the more traditional views of the conquest. If Cortés prevailed over the Indians, Las Casas in the end prevailed over him.

✵ Revolt on the Virginia Frontier: Nathaniel Bacon and William Berkeley

A

s he paused just outside of Jamestown, Virginia, Nathaniel Bacon was in no mood to be denied. The twenty-nine-year-old planter stood accused by his own cousin, Governor William Berkeley, of slaughtering Indians. Declared an outlaw, Bacon was determined to fight back. He would wrest from Berkeley a military commission allowing him to wage indiscriminate war on the “savages.” Backing Bacon were six hundred wellarmed and angry colonists. Four hundred of them were on foot, too poor to afford a horse. At two o’clock in the afternoon on June 23, 1676, Bacon’s men marched into Jamestown. Within a half hour, this “scum of the country,” as one observer called them, had secured control of the capital. Now Bacon would get what he wanted. Flanked by two musket-wielding columns, he marched up to the statehouse door. “God damn my blood, I came for my commission, and a commission I will have before I go,” he shouted. Undaunted by Bacon’s show of force, the seventy-year-old Berkeley flew out of the statehouse and confronted his young cousin. “Here! Shoot me … shoot,” he screamed as he ripped open his shirt. Again Bacon demanded a commission as “general of all forces in Virginia against the Indians.” When the enraged governor replied that he would rather see his own hand cut off, Bacon’s men responded with shouts of “We will have it.” Then they turned their guns on the legislators who had crowded at the windows to witness the confrontation outside. “Damn my blood, I’ll kill the governor, council[,] assembly[,] and all,” Bacon shouted. Bacon’s threat had the desired effect. One frightened legislator waved a handkerchief and shouted back, “You shall have it. You shall have it.” The assembly quickly persuaded Berkeley to grant Bacon his military command. Three days later, Bacon left

Jamestown with his commission and his army. Yet the governor’s problems with Bacon and his followers were not over. In the following months, Bacon’s men waged brutal war against the Indians, turned their guns on Berkeley’s government, forced it to flee Jamestown, and burned the colony’s capital to the ground. Not until early 1677 did Berkeley’s forces stamp out the uprising that came to bear Bacon’s name. But Bacon’s Rebellion had vividly demonstrated that not all was well in Virginia.

“AMBITIOUS AND ARROGANT” Nathaniel Bacon and William Berkeley shared more than family ties—and hot blood. As sons of prominent English families, both had received an elite education and sought personal advancement in Virginia. Yet the two men arrived in the colony under very different circumstances: One brought the blessings of the king, while the other carried the burden of his own family’s rejection. William Berkeley was born in 1606 into a family with long influence at the English court. After receiving degrees from Oxford, he followed his family’s footsteps to the Privy Council, a body of close advisers appointed by the monarch, where he became a favorite of Charles I.* As the author of several plays and pamphlets, the young courtier made a mark with his pen and polish. Eventually, however, the colonies came to play the key role in Berkeley’s advance, as they often did in the lives of younger sons whose older brothers inherited family estates. (In William’s family, John, first Lord Berkeley of Stratton, was the favored son.) William was appointed commissioner of Canadian affairs in 1632 and governor of Virginia nine years later.

When Berkeley arrived in Virginia in 1642, he promptly won the support of the colony’s important planters, who were alarmed about talk in Parliament of reviving the defunct Virginia Company.* Such a move would jeopardize property titles established after the company’s demise in 1624. When Berkeley landed with assurances that the company would not be restored, the grateful assembly presented him with two houses and an orchard. His reputation rose even higher when he met a threat to the colony from the Powhatan Indians, who had dealt the fatal blow to the Virginia Company when they attacked the colonists in 1622. In 1644, they struck again, leaving five hundred settlers dead. In response, Berkeley led a military force to the frontier, crushed the Powhatans’ resistance, and extracted a treaty that ended hostilities on the frontier for a generation. Berkeley proved no less popular with royal officials. A staunch supporter of the monarchy, he shared with other seventeenth-century aristocrats a disdain for commoners and once boasted that Virginia had neither free schools nor printing presses. Thus when the English civil war* broke out in 1642 between Oliver Cromwell’s parliamentary forces and the supporters of King Charles, Berkeley stood behind the Crown and even provided refuge for royalists during the war. Although he had to surrender his power when Cromwell’s fleet sailed up the James River to Jamestown, his loyalty to the king paid off. Living quietly for seven years at Green Spring Manor outside Jamestown, Berkeley watched from afar as the government in England established by Cromwell eventually collapsed. Then shortly after the monarchy was restored in 1660, he found himself back in the statehouse when Charles II named him governor. With the support of other prominent planters, Berkeley quickly reestablished his political hold. Like the governor, many of his supporters were the second sons of wealthy English families. Often holding choice seats in the colony’s government, they were also eager to claim what they regarded as their rightful inheritance. Some of them, such as Virginia secretary Thomas Ludwell, were related by marriage to the governor, who had solidified his own position through matrimony as well. (After arriving in Virginia, Berkeley had won the hand of Frances Culpeper, whose family owned vast tracts in the colony.) Once established in the colony, these members of Virginia’s landed gentry expected to be treated with proper deference, and they recommended the colony enthusiastically to prospective settlers. As Berkeley himself noted, “A small sum of money will enable a younger brother to erect a flowering family in the New World.” Whereas Berkeley had found a place for himself in Virginia, newcomer Nathaniel Bacon found prospects there far less to his liking. Born in 1647, the only son of an English gentleman, Bacon grew up on his father’s estate, Freestone Hall, surrounded by vast fields and woodlands. He attended Cambridge University and then continued his education back at home under the guidance of a private tutor. After a three-year grand tour of the continent, Bacon returned to Cambridge, where he was granted a master’s degree in 1668. Following the path trod by numerous forebears, he read law at the Inns of Court.* By 1670, the young esquire had returned home and married Elizabeth Duke, the daughter of a Suffolk squire.

There seemed to be more to Bacon’s makeup, however, than good breeding and a fancy education. In England, many who knew him came to doubt his character. His tutor acknowledged his “quick wit” but also concluded that he was “impatient of labor.” Bacon’s father-in-law was so dismayed at his daughter’s choice that he disinherited her and would never speak to her again. Bacon also disappointed his own father, who had been forced to withdraw him from Cambridge for “having broken into some extravagances.” Later, when the young spendthrift was caught defrauding another young man of his inheritance, Bacon’s father gave him eighteen hundred pounds and packed him off to Virginia. When the tall, thin, dark-haired Bacon arrived in Virginia in 1674, his youthful indiscretions were thousands of miles behind him. With Elizabeth, a daughter, and his father’s largesse in hand, he was graciously received by Governor Berkeley and by another cousin, Nathaniel Bacon Sr. With the assistance of his namesake, who sat on the governor’s council, Bacon was soon established as a frontier planter. Claiming that he had “always been delighted in solitude,” Bacon used his endowment to purchase Curles Neck, a plantation forty miles up the James River in Henrico County. He took up residence there and began planting tobacco. He also bought another tract twenty miles farther upriver at the Fall Line,* which he placed in charge of an overseer. Altogether, Bacon owned more than twelve hundred acres. In addition, Berkeley granted him a seat on his council and a license to trade with the Indians. Though exiled in disgrace, Bacon had made an astonishing recovery in a remarkably short time. Yet the frontier, which provided Bacon with solitude and a measure of prosperity, would bring him little peace. He was not there long before older residents began to accuse him of “despising the wisest of his neighbors for their ignorance.” The young man, they said, was “ambitious and arrogant,” possessing a “dangerous hidden pride of heart.” In addition, festering social and economic problems were about to erupt, thrusting Bacon into a life-and-death struggle.

Relying on the labor of indentured servants, many of Virginia’s planters had made handsome profits during the colony’s early tobacco boom. By the time Bacon arrived, however, the days of getting rich quick by growing tobacco were over. After selling as high as twenty-seven pence a pound in 1618, tobacco had fallen in price to a penny a pound by 1630 and would never rise much above two and a half pence for the rest of the century. Virginians had been too successful in producing the leafy plant. Yet low prices had not stopped the colony’s growth or, until the middle of the century, posed a threat to its stability. Even after the boom, immigrants continued to arrive, drawn by the dream of getting rich by planting tobacco. Many of these newcomers—mostly young men— arrived as servants, usually indentured for four years in exchange for passage across the Atlantic. Although approximately two thousand African slaves lived in Virginia by the 1670s, cheaper servants provided the main source of labor in the tobacco fields. With land easy to secure in the colony’s early years, they could look forward to joining the ranks of the planters. In time, some former servants would even come to control the labor of others and begin to prosper. *

By the mid-seventeenth century, the number of servants who became freemen began to grow. Earlier, servants were lucky if they survived their terms of indenture. By the 1650s, however, Virginians began to live longer, thanks perhaps to healthier diets. Though still often overworked and abused by masters, more servants lived to become freemen. Mostly, of course, they planted tobacco, further depressing its price. They also competed for good tobacco land. Virginia had abundant uncultivated land, but prominent planters had secured much of the choice tidewater* land, often through their connections to the government. In fact, many were members of the “Green Spring faction,” as Berkeley’s influential supporters came to be known. By the 1660s, freemen who wished to plant found themselves facing a difficult choice. They could move to the frontier, where it was often impossible to ship tobacco to market and the danger of Indian attack was ever present. Or they could rent land from one of Virginia’s big landowners. Many naturally chose the safety of settled areas. Though surrounded by vast stretches of uncultivated land, perhaps a third of the free adult males now worked as tenants for the colony’s big planters or moved from place to place as vagrants. In 1670, the assembly declared these landless freemen ineligible to vote. In effect, an artificial scarcity of land had created a pool of poor—and powerless—workers. Making matters worse, Virginians faced a crushing annual poll tax of as much as 200 pounds of tobacco, export taxes, and customs duties. The taxes helped fill the king’s coffers, but they also paid for generous perquisites of office in Virginia. From the governor and legislators to clerks of the county courts, officeholders rewarded themselves handsomely. Governor Berkeley’s salary was an astonishing twelve hundred pounds sterling—more than the average freeman could hope to see in a lifetime. In addition, he took 200 pounds of tobacco for every marriage license issued, 350 pounds annually from every tavern, and an annual tribute of beaver pelts from the colony’s subject Indians, as well as payoffs from licensed fur traders. Meanwhile, the Speaker and clerk of the House of Burgesses were awarded as much as 20,000 pounds of tobacco each for every session of the legislature. As making money by planting tobacco grew more difficult, the colony’s government became the way to wealth in Virginia. Yet participation in the government was beyond the reach of former servants. Not a single servant who arrived in Virginia after 1640 was elected to the House of Burgesses, much less appointed to the governor’s council. In the years before Bacon’s Rebellion, discontent boiled to the surface of Virginia society. In 1661, servants rebelled in protest against their treatment. Though confined to one county and quickly suppressed, that uprising was followed two years later by the revelation of a plot among servants in another county. “Consider us,” Berkeley told the king, “as a people press’d at our backes with Indians, [and] in our Bowills with our servants.” Free Virginians, moreover, could be just as unruly, and the governor had to put down two small insurrections of freemen in 1674. To be sure, full-scale armed revolt was unlikely because settlers were spread over the land, separated by rivers and forests. Still, when war erupted, the colony mustered large numbers of armed men, and that could be dangerous. When the governor gathered a force in 1673 to prevent a Dutch invasion of the colony, he observed that one-third of the defenders were poor or indebted freemen who would just as soon join the Dutch “in hopes of bettering their condition by sharing the plunder of the country with them.” As Berkeley would soon learn, an armed force raised to defend the colony from a different threat could be even more dangerous.

REVOLT ON THE VIRGINIA FRONTIER

23

About the same time Bacon took up residence in Virginia, trouble was stirring on the colony’s frontier. In the three decades following the Powhatans’ failed uprising in 1644, the Pamunkey, Appomattox, Chickahominy, and other tribes lived peacefully under the sovereignty of the English king. The Indians, Berkeley boasted, “are absolutely subjected, so that there is no fear of them.” The continuing growth of the English population in Virginia, however, threatened to change that. By 1670, maybe forty thousand English and four thousand subject Indians made Virginia their home. As the settlers’ numbers grew, so did encroachment on Indian lands near the Fall Line. The result by 1675 was rapidly escalating violence. In July of that year, some thirty Virginians responded with a violent outburst to the murder of a white settler by a Doeg Indian. First they killed eleven Doegs. Then they surrounded a cabin sheltering more frightened Indians and gunned them down when they attempted to flee. Fourteen bodies lay around the cabin by the time the men realized that the victims were friendly Susquehannas. Later that summer, a thousand armed Virginians descended on the Susquehannas. The Virginians were convinced that the Susquehannas, the most powerful tribe along the Fall Line, were sheltering other Indian marauders. The Susquehannas denied any involvement in the recent attacks. They blamed them on the Senecas, one of the Iroquois tribes that had squeezed the Susquehannas from the interior, just as the English now pressed them from the other direction. But their denials fell on deaf ears. Surrounding a fort sheltering about a hundred Susquehannas, the Virginians grabbed five chiefs who ventured out to ask the reason for the armed force. The Virginians led the chiefs away and murdered them. The rest of the Susquehannas eventually slipped out of the besieged fort at night, killing ten Virginians in their escape. In early 1676, the Susquehannas, still furious about the murder of their chiefs, launched a raid near the falls of the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, leaving sixty settlers dead. Confronted with rising danger on the frontier, white settlers demanded that the governor respond with armed force. [See Source 1.] Berkeley was in a bind. As governor, he was responsible for maintaining order in the colony so that Virginians could continue to produce tobacco revenue for the Crown. He was also charged with overseeing the lucrative fur trade. Peaceful relations with the Indians were in both his and the colony’s best interests, and he was livid about the murder of the Susquehanna chiefs. “If they had come to treat in peace,” he declared, “they ought to have gone in peace.” He was also well aware of the dangers of sending a force of armed Virginians to the frontier, given the recent indiscriminate attacks against the Indians. Thus the governor sought a solution that addressed the frontier dwellers’ concerns without needlessly provoking the Indians. Berkeley’s answer became evident when he convened the assembly in March 1676. The representatives promptly declared war on “all such Indians who … shall be discovered to have committed murders … and depredations.” It also moved to restrain vigilante action on the frontier, passing a bill authorizing a string of forts to be built along the Fall Line. The forts would be manned not by frontiersmen, but by men from more secure parts of the colony. They would be commanded by officers reporting directly to the governor. In addition, the assembly forbade trade with the Indians, even by those with licenses. “Sad experience,” it declared, had demonstrated that traders had broken the law by providing guns and powder to the Indians. From now on, commissions for trade with the Indians would be granted by the governor’s appointees on the county courts. While issuing harsh words against the Indians, the legislature had actually exercised a restraining hand on white settlers. Frontiersmen reacted angrily to the new laws. The forts would require new taxes at a time when tobacco prices were low and many planters were already in dire financial straits. Moreover, they charged, the forts would be placed too far apart to prevent Indian raids.

The Indians could easily penetrate a stationary defense and attack exposed plantations at will. The frontier planters could not legally raise their own force to repel the Indian threat, but if they did not take action, they left themselves exposed to “the merciless power of a most bloody and barbarous enemy.” It was, they protested, “a sad dilemma.” Fed by growing suspicion about Berkeley’s motives and increasing doubts about the loyalty of any Indians, rumors spread up and down the Fall Line: Building forts was intended only to reward Berkeley’s cronies with contracts. Berkeley’s friends were selling arms to hostile Indians. Virginia’s Indians were paying tribute to other tribes two hundred to three hundred miles away to unite with them. And as the Indian uprising known as King Philip’s War raged in New England, some Virginians even began to dread a “general combination of all [tribes] from New England hither.” In an atmosphere of growing fear and frustration, Bacon emerged to lead the fight against the Indians. The impetuous young planter had already run afoul of Berkeley’s Indian policy. When Bacon saw fit to seize some Appomattox Indians the previous fall for allegedly stealing corn, the governor condemned his “rash[,] heady action.” Now Bacon, who recently lost an overseer in a Susquehanna attack and had just begun a trading business, scorned Berkeley’s plan for frontier defense. He accused the governor of excluding settlers from the Indian trade only to reward his “favorites.” Although Bacon had little in common with Virginia’s freemen, he shared with them a feeling that an inside group was reaping rewards at the expense of others. He was not the only socially prominent newcomer to conclude that he had been treated unfairly. Richard Lawrence, an Oxford graduate; William Drummond, former governor of Carolina; and Giles Bland, whose family claimed extensive landholdings in Virginia, all had had run-ins with Berkeley or his officials. When Bland had arrived in 1671 to take over as customs collector, for instance, Berkeley’s secretary Thomas Ludwell had dismissed him as a “puppy and Sonn of a whore.” Feeling similarly excluded from Berkeley’s ruling circle, Bacon paid a visit in April 1676 to a force of backcountry volunteers at the urging of several other planters. Denouncing the governor as “negligent, wicked, treacherous, and incapable,” Bacon took unauthorized command of the force, promising to bear all the costs of the campaign against the Indians. The lives of the frontier inhabitants, he declared, had been “wretchedly sacrificed,” and he resolved to risk his “life and fortune” in their defense. Bacon’s new position provoked a speedy response from Berkeley, who warned Bacon not to mutiny and ordered him to Jamestown. Bacon refused to go and instead requested that Berkeley entrust him “with the country’s safety” by granting him a commission for command of the volunteers. When Berkeley denied the commission, Bacon issued his “Appeal of the Volunteers to all well minded and charitable people.” Because “wrongs and violences” had been “cunningly” committed by several Indian tribes, he declared, it was very difficult to distinguish from which tribes “the said wrongs did proceed.” As Bacon and his men mobilized for their first campaign, it would soon become clear just how little use they had for making distinctions between friendly and unfriendly Indians.

“SO GLORIOUS A CAUSE” In May 1676, Bacon and several hundred of his followers set out to solve Virginia’s Indian problem. In search of the Susquehannas, they marched about eighty miles southwest from the James River through thick forests to a fort belonging to the Occaneechees, a friendly tribe living near the present border of Virginia and North Carolina.

Occaneechees, they found what they were looking for: a party of Susquehannas, refugees from the Virginians’ attack on their fort to the north. When the Susquehannas sought the Occaneechees’ aid, they instead alerted the Virginians to their new neighbors’ whereabouts. After providing Bacon’s exhausted force with food and shelter, the Occaneechees offered to attack the Susquehannas themselves. Bacon and his men were only too willing to have the Occaneechees do their fighting for them.
