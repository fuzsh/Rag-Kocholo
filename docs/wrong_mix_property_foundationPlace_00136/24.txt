In Memoriam Bennett David Hill 1934 – 2005

Bennett Hill, who authored many of the chapters in earlier editions of this book, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of African American Catholics. When Bennett was ten, the family moved north to Philadelphia, where his father worked for the U.S. Postal Service and his mother for the Veterans Administration. Bennett attended public schools, and his intellectual prowess was soon evident. He won a scholarship to Princeton University, where he received an excellent education that he always treasured. Majoring in history and graduating cum laude, Bennett was a trailblazer— one of the ﬁrst African Americans to receive an undergraduate degree from Princeton. He subsequently earned a doctorate in European history at Princeton, joined the history department of the University of Illinois at Apago Urbana-Champaign, and laterPDF servedEnhancer as department chair. Bennett was a popular but demanding teacher with a passion for medieval social history. His colleagues at Illinois remember especially his keen intellect, elegant taste, literary ﬂair, and quick, sometimes mischievous wit. (He once persuaded some of his students that he followed medieval tradition and trimmed his front lawn with sheep rather than a lawn mower.) Establishing a scholarly reputation as a leading expert on medieval monasticism, Bennett heeded a spiritual call in midlife and became a Benedictine monk and ordained priest at St. Anselm’s Abbey in Washington, D.C. He often served Mass at the parish church of his grandparents in Baltimore. Yet Bennett never lost his passion for European and world history, teaching regularly as a visiting professor at Georgetown University. An indefatigable worker with insatiable curiosity, he viewed each new edition as an exciting learning opportunity. At the time of his sudden and unexpected death in February 2005 he was working on a world history of slavery, which grew out of his research and reﬂected his proud heritage and intensely ethical concerns. A complex and many-sided individual, Bennett was a wonderful conversationalist, an inspiring human being, and the beloved brother and uncle of a large extended family. His sudden passing has been a wrenching loss for all who knew him.

Preface

A History of Western Society grew out of the authors’ desire to infuse new life into the study of Western Civilization. We knew that historians were using imaginative questions and innovative research to open up vast new areas of historical interest and knowledge. We also recognized that these advances had dramatically affected the subject of European economic, intellectual, and, especially, social history, while new research and fresh interpretations were also revitalizing the study of the traditional mainstream of political, diplomatic, and religious developments. Despite history’s vitality as a discipline, however, it seemed to us at the time that both the broad public and the intelligentsia were generally losing interest in the past. That, fortunately for us all, has not proven the case. It was our conviction, based on considerable experience introducing large numbers of students to the broad sweep of Western Civilization, that a book in which social history was the core element could excite readers and inspire a renewed interest in history. Our strategy was thus twofold. First, we incorporated recent research by social historians as we sought to re-create the life of ordinary people in appealing human terms. At the same time, we were determined to give great economic, political, cultural, and intellectual developments the attention they unquestionably deserve. We wanted to give individual readers and teachers a balanced, integrated perspective so that they could pursue—on their own or in the classroom—those themes and questions that they found particularly exciting and signiﬁcant. In an effort to realize fully the potential of our fresh yet balanced approach, we made many changes, large and small, in the editions that followed.

previous editions, while blending in the most important recent ﬁndings.

Conceptual and Content Revisions Several main lines of revision have guided our many changes. In particular, we have approached the history of the West as part of the history of the world and have devoted more space to Europe’s interactions with the rest of the world. This has meant that some parts of the book have been completely reconceptualized and reorganized, as have many of the sections within chapters. Chapter 15 is now entirely devoted to European exploration, discovery, and conquest and also includes coverage of world contacts before Columbus. Chapter 19 includes discussion of European trade with Asia, and Chapter 20 incorporates extended coverage of the impact of colonial products, including sugar, tea, coffee, and tobacco. Chapter 21 has considerable new material on the Haitian revolution; Chapter 29 includes more on World War II outside of Europe; and Chapter 30 has more on decolonization in the Middle East and Africa. A second major change is updated discussion of gender throughout the text. The development of women’s and gender history has been a central part of the expansion of historical knowledge over the last several decades, and this edition includes even fuller discussion of the role of gender in shaping human experience than did previous editions. Some of this new material focuses on women, including women’s role in the court culture of early modern Europe (Chapter 16) and women’s work in the Industrial Revolution (Chapter 22). Other sections ask readers to consider the ways in which gender is related to other social hierarchies, such as social status and race (Chapters 13 and 30), or ways in which religious or intellectual concepts are gendered (Chapter 16). New scholarship on gender has meant revisions in other sections as well, including discussion of the Reformation, the witch-hunts, the scientiﬁc revolution, nineteenthcentury cities, and cold war Europe. The discussion of gender is accompanied by updates to the material on sexuality in many chapters, as this is a ﬁeld of scholarship growing very rapidly.

Changes in the Ninth Edition In preparing the Ninth Edition we have worked hard to keep our book up-to-date by including as much valuable and relevant new scholarship as possible. We have also strengthened our distinctive yet balanced approach to a wide range of topics. In addition, we have revised the layout of the chapters somewhat to foreground the historical questions posed and answered in each chapter, and added a new map feature. This edition includes the best of

Preface

These two major lines of revision are accompanied by continued enhancement of content that began in earlier editions. The social history focus that has been the core element of this book since its ﬁrst edition continues. In addition to more material on Europe in a global perspective, we have continued to incorporate more discussion of groups and regions that are frequently shortchanged in the general histories of Europe and Western Civilization. This expanded scope reﬂects the renewed awareness within the profession of Europe’s enormous historical diversity, as well as the efforts of contemporary Europeans to understand the ambivalent and contested meanings of their national, regional, ethnic, and pan-European identities. Several chapters examine notions of race during times of signiﬁcant cultural change, including the Renaissance (Chapter 13), the ﬁrst wave of colonization (Chapter 15), the Enlightenment (Chapter 18), and nineteenth-century urban society (Chapter 24). An important part of this continued broader focus is material on Islam. Chapters 17, 25, and 27 all include signiﬁcant new material on the Ottoman Empire. Several of the new features focus on Muslims living in Europe, as well as issues involving Christian-Muslim relations. We believe that including examples of problems of historical interpretations in our text helps our readers develop the critical-thinking skills that are among the most precious beneﬁts of studying history. Examples of this more open-ended, interpretative approach include debates about the impact of Enlightenment thought (Chapter 18) and renewed debate on personal and collective responsibility for the Holocaust (Chapter 29). Concern with terminology is key to new ways in which history is being studied, researched, and presented, and among the historiographical issues we present are some that ask readers to consider the implications of words they (and historians) use regularly without thinking much about them. This includes discussion of the terms “Renaissance” and “modern” (Chapter 13) and disputes about who was and was not part of “the nation” (Chapter 25) or included in understandings of “Europe” (Chapter 31). This edition includes several major changes in the organization of chapters. Chapter 14 now includes material on the Reformations, religious wars, and witch-hunts, while, as noted above, Chapter 15 now focuses on exploration and overseas expansion.

answered in the course of each chapter and repeated in an end-of-chapter summary that concisely reiterates the chapter’s ﬁndings. For this edition, many of the questions have been reframed, and the chapter summaries rewritten, to maximize the usefulness of this popular pedagogical device. Dates have been added to most chapter titles. This edition also adds a new feature, “Mapping the Past.” Historians have long relied on maps to help explain the stories that they tell, but we have found that students often do not pay as much attention to the maps as they should. Thus in the new “Mapping the Past” feature, one map in each chapter includes questions for discussion. Some of these questions refer only to a single map, while others encourage students to compare different maps in order to trace processes over time.

Distinctive Features In addition to the new “Mapping the Past” feature, this edition continues to include distinctive features from earlier editions that guide the reader in the process of historical understanding.

The DBQs provided are in the same format as those found on the AP* exam. Within the chapters, DBQ icons draw the student’s attention to passages that are especially meaningful in the context of the various questions.

Individuals in Society Included in each chapter is the feature “Individuals in Society,” which offers a brief study of a woman, man, or group, informing us about the societies in which they lived. Each study or biographical sketch has been carefully integrated into the body of the text. The “Individuals in Society” feature grew out of our long-standing focus on people’s lives and the varieties of historical experience, and we believe that readers will empathize with these human beings as they themselves seek to deﬁne their own identities. The spotlighting of individuals, both famous and obscure, perpetuates the greater attention to *“AP” and “Advanced Placement Program” are registered trademarks of the College Entrance Examination Board, which was not involved with the production of, and does not endorse, this product.

Preface

cultural and intellectual developments that we used to invigorate our social history in earlier editions, and it reﬂects changing interests within the historical profession as well as the development of “micro-history.” The range of men and women we consider is broad. For this edition, and sometimes at readers’ suggestion, we have dropped some individuals and replaced them with others who add their own contributions to history. In keeping with this edition’s increasing attention to individuals from outside western Europe who had an impact on European developments, Chapter 17 looks at Hürrem, ﬁrst the concubine and then the wife of Suleiman the Magniﬁcent, and Chapter 21 at Toussaint L’Ouverture, leader of the revolution in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. Chapter 23 focuses on the French historian Jules Michelet, who viewed nationalism as a means of lessening social tensions, and Chapter 30 on Margaret Thatcher, the ﬁrst woman to become prime minister in Britain. Chapter 31 focuses on Tariq Ramadan, the controversial European-Muslim intellectual. In addition to these new individuals, in some cases, such as Leonardo da Vinci (Chapter 13), we have kept the same individuals, but completely rewritten the feature to bring it in line with current scholarship.

terpretation. Selected for their interest and importance and carefully ﬁtted into their historical context, these sources do indeed allow the student to “listen to the past” and to observe how history has been shaped by individual men and women, some of them great aristocrats, others ordinary folk.

Images in Society This edition continues to include the photo essay “Images in Society.” Each essay consists of a short narrative with questions, accompanied by several pictures. The goal of the feature is to encourage students to think critically: to view and compare visual illustrations and draw conclusions about the societies and cultures that produced those objects. “Art in the Reformation” (Chapter 14) examines both the Protestant and Catholic views of religious art. Chapter 17 presents the way monarchs displayed their authority visually in “Absolutist Palace Building.” Moving to modern times, the focus in Chapter 19 changes to “London: The Remaking of a Great City,” which depicts how Londoners rebuilt their city after a great catastrophe. “Class and Gender Boundaries in Women’s Fashion, 1850–1914” studies women’s clothing in relationship to women’s evolving position in society and gender relations (Chapter 24). “Pablo Picasso and Modern Art” looks at some of Picasso’s greatest paintings to gain insight into his principles and the modernist revolution in art (Chapter 28).

Apago PDF Enhancer Listening to the Past A two-page feature called “Listening to the Past” extends and illuminates a major historical issue considered in each of the text’s chapters through the presentation of a source or small group of sources. In the new edition we have reviewed our selections and made judicious substitutions. Chapter 20 focuses on Louis Sebastien Mercier’s comments on everyday life in eighteenth-century Paris, and Chapter 23 on the reﬂections of a Czech historian writing during the revolution of 1848. Chapter 27 features Arab protests regarding the establishment of the League of Nations mandates in the former Ottoman Empire and the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Chapter 31 examines riots in the suburbs of Paris by French people of Arab descent in late 2005. As in the “Individuals in Society” feature, in addition to these brand-new sources, sources that appeared in previous editions have often been contextualized in new ways reﬂective of current scholarship. Each primary source opens with a problem-setting introduction and closes with “Questions for Analysis” that invite students to evaluate the evidence as historians would. Drawn from a range of writings addressing a variety of social, cultural, political, and intellectual issues, these sources promote active involvement and critical in-

Additional Features The illustrative component of our work has been carefully revised. We have added many new illustrations to our extensive art program, which includes more than four hundred color reproductions, letting great art and important events come alive. As in earlier editions, all illustrations have been carefully selected to complement the text, and all carry informative captions, based on thorough research, that enhance their value and have been revised for the current edition. Artwork remains an integral part of our book; the past can speak in pictures as well as in words. The use of full color serves to clarify the maps and graphs and to enrich the textual material. The maps and map captions have been updated to correlate directly to the text, and new maps, as well as the “Mapping the Past” feature, have been added. Each chapter includes a chronology feature that lists major developments in the period discussed in the chapter. In addition, topic-speciﬁc timelines appear at key points throughout the book. Once again we provide a uniﬁed

timeline at the end of the text. Comprehensive and easy to locate, this useful timeline allows students to compare developments over the centuries. A list of Key Terms concludes each chapter. These terms are highlighted in boldface in the text. The student may use these terms to test his or her understanding of the chapter’s material. In addition to posing chapter-opening questions and presenting more problems in historical interpretation, we have quoted extensively from a wide variety of primary sources in the narrative, demonstrating in our use of these quotations how historians evaluate evidence. Thus primary sources are examined as an integral part of the narrative as well as presented in extended form in the “Listening to the Past” chapter feature. We believe that such an extensive program of both integrated and separate primary source excerpts will help readers learn to interpret and think critically. Each chapter concludes with a carefully selected list ofsuggestions for further reading, revised and updated to keep them current with the vast amount of new work being done in many ﬁelds. These bibliographies are shorter than those in previous editions, as readers may now ﬁnd more extensive suggestions for further reading on the website bedfordstmartins.com/mckaywest. Throughout the text, icons direct students to online interactive maps and primary sources corresponding to discussions in the text and to the student and instructor websites.

The Crisis of the Later Middle Ages, 1300–1450

chapter preview

Prelude to Disaster

• What were the demographic and economic consequences of climate change?

The Black Death

• How did the spread of the plague shape European society? The Hundred Years’ War

• What were the causes of the Hundred Years’ War, and how did the war affect European politics, economics, and cultural life?

uring the later Middle Ages, the last book of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation, inspired thousands of sermons and hundreds of religious tracts. The Book of Revelation deals with visions of the end of the world, with disease, war, famine, and death. It is no wonder this part of the Bible was so popular. Between 1300 and 1450 Europeans experienced a frightful series of shocks: climate change, economic dislocation, plague, war, social upheaval, and increased crime and violence. Death and preoccupation with death make the fourteenth century one of the most wrenching periods of Western civilization. Yet, in spite of the pessimism and crises, important institutions and cultural forms, including representative assemblies and national literatures, emerged. Even institutions that experienced severe crisis, such as the Christian church, saw new types of vitality.

Challenges to the Church

• What challenges faced the Christian church in the fourteenth century, and how did church leaders, intellectuals, and ordinary people respond? Economic and Social Change

• How did economic and social tensions contribute to revolts, crime, violence, and a growing sense of ethnic and national distinctions?

Prelude to Disaster In the first half of the fourteenth century, Europe experienced a series of climate changes that led to lower levels of food production, which had dramatic and disastrous ripple effects. Political leaders attempted to find solutions, but were unable to deal with the economic and social problems that resulted. • What were the demographic and economic consequences of climate change?

Climate Change and Famine The period from about 1000 to about 1300 saw warmer than usual climate in Europe, which underlay all the changes and vitality of the High Middle Ages. About 1300 the climate changed, becoming colder and wetter. Historical geographers refer to the period from 1300 to 1450 as a “little ice age,” which they can trace through both natural and human records.

Death from Famine In this fifteenth-century painting, dead bodies lie in the middle of a path, while a funeral procession at the right includes a man with an adult’s coffin and a woman with the coffin of an infant under her arm. People did not simply allow the dead to lie in the street in medieval Europe, though during famines and epidemics it was sometimes difficult to maintain normal burial procedures.

Evidence from nature emerges through the study of Alpine and polar glaciers, tree rings, and pollen left in bogs. Human-produced sources include written reports of rivers freezing and crops never ripening, as well as archaeological evidence such as the abandoned villages of Greenland, where ice floes cut off contact with the rest of the world and the harshening climate meant that the few hardy crops grown earlier could no longer survive. The Viking colony on Greenland died out completely, though Inuit people who relied on hunting sea mammals continued to live in the far north, as they had before the arrival of Viking colonists. An unusual number of storms brought torrential rains, ruining the wheat, oat, and hay crops on which people and animals almost everywhere depended. Since longdistance transportation of food was expensive and difficult, most urban areas depended for bread and meat on areas no more than a day’s journey away. Poor harvests— and one in four was likely to be poor—led to scarcity and starvation. Almost all of northern Europe suffered a

“Great Famine” in the years 1315–1322, which contem-

poraries interpreted as a recurrence of the biblical “seven lean years” (Genesis 42). Even in non-famine years, the cost of grain, livestock, and dairy products rose sharply. Reduced caloric intake meant increased susceptibility to disease, especially for infants, children, and the elderly. Workers on reduced diets had less energy, which in turn meant lower productivity, lower output, and higher grain prices. The Great Famine proved to be a demographic disaster in France; in Burgundy perhaps one-third of the population died. The many religious houses of Flanders experienced a high loss of monks, nuns, and priests. In Scandinavia and the Baltic countries, low cereal harvests, declines in meat and dairy production, economic recessions, and the lack of salt, used for preserving herring, resulted in terrible food shortages. Hardly had western Europe begun to recover from this disaster when another struck: an epidemic of typhoid fever carried away thousands. In 1316, 10 percent of the population of the city of Ypres may have died between

Prelude to Disaster

May and October alone. Then in 1318 disease hit cattle and sheep, drastically reducing the herds and flocks. Another bad harvest in 1321 brought famine and death. The province of Languedoc in France presents a classic example of agrarian crisis. For more than 150 years Languedoc had enjoyed continual land reclamation, steady agricultural expansion, and enormous population growth. Then the fourteenth century opened with four years of bad harvests. Torrential rains in 1310 ruined the harvest and brought on terrible famine. Harvests failed again in 1322 and 1329. In 1332 desperate peasants survived the winter on raw herbs. In the half century from 1302 to 1348, poor harvests occurred twenty times. These catastrophes had grave social consequences. Poor harvests and famine led to the abandonment of homesteads. In parts of the Low Countries and in the ScottishEnglish borderlands, entire villages were abandoned. This meant a great increase in the number of vagabonds, what we call “homeless people.” In Flanders and East Anglia (eastern England), where aspects of the famine have been carefully analyzed, some peasants were forced to mortgage, sublease, or sell their holdings to get money to buy food. Rich farmers bought out their poorer neighbors. When conditions improved, debtors tried to get their lands back, leading to a very volatile land market. To reduce the labor supply and the mouths to feed in the countryside, young men and women sought work in the towns. Poor harvests probably meant that marriage had to be postponed. Later marriages and the deaths caused by famine and disease meant a reduction in population. Meanwhile, the international character of trade and commerce meant that a disaster in one country had serious implications elsewhere. For example, the infection that attacked English sheep in 1318 caused a sharp decline in wool exports in the following years. Without wool, Flemish weavers could not work, and thousands were laid off. Without woolen cloth, the businesses of Flemish, Hanseatic, and Italian merchants suffered. Unemployment encouraged people to turn to crime.

Government Ineptitude To none of these problems did governments have effective solutions. The three sons of Philip the Fair who sat on the French throne between 1314 and 1328 condemned speculators, who held stocks of grain back until conditions were desperate and prices high; forbade the sale of grain abroad; and published legislation prohibiting fishing with traps that took large catches. These measures had few positive results. As the subsistence crisis deepened, popular discontent and paranoia increased.

Starving people focused their anger on the rich, speculators, and the Jews, who were targeted as creditors fleecing the poor through pawnbroking. (Expelled from France in 1306, Jews were readmitted in 1315 and were granted the privilege of lending at high interest rates.) Rumors spread of a plot by Jews and their agents, the lepers, to kill Christians by poisoning the wells. Based on “evidence” collected by torture, many lepers and Jews were killed, beaten, or hit with heavy fines. In England Edward I’s incompetent son, Edward II (r. 1307–1327), used Parliament to set price controls, first on the sale of livestock after disease and poor lambing had driven prices up, and then on ale, which was made from barley (the severe rains of 1315 had contributed to molds and mildews, sharply reducing the crop). Baronial conflicts and wars with the Scots dominated Edward II’s reign. Fearing food riots and violence, Edward condemned speculators, which proved easier than enforcing price controls. He did try to buy grain abroad, but yields in the Baltic were low; the French crown, as we have seen, forbade exports; and the grain shipped from Castile in northern Spain was grabbed by Scottish, English, and rogue Hanseatic pirates on the

high seas. Such grain as reached southern English ports was stolen by looters and sold on the black market. The Crown’s efforts at famine relief failed.

The Black Death Royal attempts to provide food from abroad were unsuccessful, but they indicate the extent of long-distance shipping by the beginning of the fourteenth century. In 1291 Genoese sailors had opened the Strait of Gibraltar to Italian shipping by defeating the Moroccans. Then, shortly after 1300, important advances were made in the design of Italian merchant ships. A square rig was added to the mainmast, and ships began to carry three masts instead of just one. Additional sails better utilized wind power to propel the ship. The improved design permitted year-round shipping for the first time, and Venetian and Genoese merchant ships could sail the dangerous Atlantic coast even in the winter months. Ships continually at sea carried all types of cargo, and they also carried vermin of all types, especially insects and rats, which often harbored disease pathogens. Rats, fleas, and cockroaches could live for months on the cargo carried along the coasts, disembarking at ports with the grain, cloth, or other merchandise. Just as modern air travel has allowed diseases such as AIDS and SARS to spread quickly over very long distances, medieval shipping did the same. The most frightful of these diseases first emerged in western Europe in 1347, carried on Genoese ships, a disease that was later called the Black Death.

when millions died. Doctors and epidemiologists closely studied this outbreak, identified the bacillus as bubonic plague, and learned about the exact cycle of infection for the first time. The fourteenth-century outbreak showed many similarities to the nineteenth-century outbreak, but also some differences. There are no reports of massive rat dieoffs in fourteenth-century records. The plague was often transmitted directly from one person to another through coughing and sneezing (what epidemiologists term pneumonic transmission) as well as through flea bites. The fourteenth-century outbreak spread much faster than the nineteenth-century outbreak and was much more deadly, killing as much as one-third of the population when it first spread to an area. These differences have led some historians to question whether the fourteenth-century disease was actually bubonic plague or whether it was some other disease, perhaps something like the Ebola virus. In the late 1990s French paleomicrobiologists studying the tooth pulp from bodies in two plague cemeteries found DNA from Y. pestis, a finding that has been viewed as convincing by most medical historians, though similar studies of English plague cemeteries have not yielded the same results. These debates fuel continued study of medical aspects of the plague. Some scholars suggest that the type of fleas that normally live on humans might have also been agents in plague transmission in the fourteenth century (which would account for the lack of a rat die-off), or that the fourteenth-century strain of the disease might have been particularly deadly, or that improvements in sanitation and public health by the nineteenth century— even in poor countries such as India—might have limited the mortality rate significantly. Though there is some disagreement about exactly what kind of disease the plague was, there is no dispute about its dreadful effects on the body. The classic symptom of the bubonic plague was a growth the size of a nut or an apple in the armpit, in the groin, or on the neck. This was the boil, or bubo, that gave the disease its name and caused agonizing pain. If the bubo was lanced and the pus thoroughly drained, the victim had a chance of recovery. The next stage was the appearance of black spots or blotches caused by bleeding under the skin. (This syndrome did not give the disease its common name; contemporaries did not call the plague the Black Death. Sometime in the fifteenth century, the Latin phrase atra mors, meaning “dreadful death,” was translated as “black death,” and the phrase stuck.) Finally, the victim began to cough violently and spit blood. This stage, indicating the presence of millions of bacilli in the

• How did the spread of the plague shape European society?

Pathology Most historians and almost all microbiologists identify the disease that spread in the fourteenth century as the bubonic plague, caused by the bacillus Yersinia pestis. The disease normally afflicts rats. Fleas living on the infected rats drink their blood; the bacteria that cause the plague multiply in the flea’s gut; and the flea passes them on to the next rat it bites by throwing up into the bite. Usually the disease is limited to rats and other rodents, but at certain points in history—perhaps when most rats have been killed off—the fleas have jumped from their rodent hosts to humans and other animals. One of these times appears to have been in the Eastern Roman Empire in the sixth century, when a plague killed millions of people. Another was in China and India in the 1890s,

bloodstream, signaled the end, and death followed in two or three days.

Spread of the Disease Plague symptoms were first described in 1331 in southwestern China, part of the Mongol Empire. Plagueinfested rats accompanied Mongol armies and merchant caravans carrying silk, spices, and gold across Central Asia in the 1330s. Then they stowed away on ships, carrying the disease to the ports of the Black Sea by the 1340s. Later stories told of more dramatic means of spreading the disease as well, reporting that Mongol armies besieging the city of Kaffa on the shores of the Black Sea catapulted plague-infected corpses over the walls to infect those inside. The city’s residents dumped the corpses into the sea as fast as they could, but they were already infected.

In October 1347 Genoese ships brought the plague from Kaffa to Messina, from which it spread across Sicily. Venice and Genoa were hit in January 1348, and from the port of Pisa the disease spread south to Rome and east to Florence and all of Tuscany. By late spring southern Germany was attacked. Frightened French authorities chased a galley bearing the disease away from the port of Marseilles, but not before plague had infected the city, from which it spread to Languedoc and Spain. In June 1348 two ships entered the Bristol Channel and introduced it into England. All Europe felt the scourge of this horrible disease (see Map 12.1). Although urban authorities from London to Paris to Rome had begun to try to achieve a primitive level of sanitation by the fourteenth century, urban conditions remained ideal for the spread of disease. Narrow streets filled with refuse and human excrement were as much cesspools as thoroughfares. Dead animals and sore-covered

beggars greeted the traveler. Houses whose upper stories projected over the lower ones blocked light and air. And extreme overcrowding was commonplace.

brick, but many wood, clay, and mud houses remained. A determined rat had little trouble entering such a house. Standards of personal hygiene remained frightfully low. True, most large cities had public bathhouses, but we have no way of knowing how frequently ordinary people used them.

resistance to serious disease. Fleas and body lice were universal afflictions: everyone from peasants to archbishops had them. One more bite did not cause much alarm. But if that nibble came from a bacillus-bearing flea, an entire household or area was doomed. Mortality rates cannot be specified because population figures for the period before the arrival of the plague do not exist for most countries and cities. The largest amount of material survives for England, but it is difficult to use; after enormous scholarly controversy, only educated guesses can be made. Of a total English population of perhaps 4.2 million, probably 1.4 million died of the Black Death in its several visits. Densely populated Italian cities endured incredible losses. Florence lost between one-half and two-thirds of its 1347 population of 85,000 when the plague visited in 1348. The most widely accepted estimate for western Europe is that the plague killed about one-third of the population in the first wave of infection. Nor did central and eastern Europe escape the ravages of the disease. Moving northward from the Balkans, eastward from France, and southward from the Baltic, the plague swept through the German Empire. In the Rhineland in 1349, Cologne and Mainz endured heavy losses. In 1348 it swept through Bavaria, entered the Moselle Valley, and pushed into northern Germany. One chronicler records that, in the summer and autumn of 1349, between five hundred and six hundred died every day in Vienna. Styria, in what today is central Austria, was very hard hit, with cattle straying unattended in the fields. As the Black Death took its toll on the German Empire, waves of emigrants fled to Poland, Bohemia, and Hungary. The situation there was better, though disease was not completely absent. The plague seems to have entered Poland through the Baltic seaports and spread from there. Still, population losses were lower than elsewhere in Europe. The plague spread from Poland to Russia, reaching Pskov, Novgorod, and Moscow. No estimates have been made of population losses there or in the Balkans. In Serbia, though, the plague left vast tracts of land unattended, which prompted an increase in Albanian immigration to meet the labor shortage. Across Europe the Black Death recurred intermittently from the 1360s to 1400. It reappeared with reduced virulence from time to time over the following centuries, making its last appearance in the French port city of Marseilles in 1721. Survivors became more prudent. Because periods of famine had caused malnutrition, making people vulnerable to disease, Europeans controlled population growth so that population did not outstrip food

supply. Western Europeans improved navigation techniques and increased long-distance trade, which permitted the importation of grain from sparsely populated Baltic regions. They strictly enforced quarantine measures. They worked on the development of vaccines. But it was only in 1947, six centuries after the arrival of the plague in the West, that the American microbiologist Selman Waksman discovered an effective vaccine, streptomycin. Plague continues to infect rodent and human populations sporadically today.

Care Fourteenth-century medical literature indicates that physicians could sometimes ease the pain, but they had no cure. Medical doctors observed that crowded cities had high death rates, especially when the weather was warm and moist. We understand that warm, moist conditions make it easier for germs, viruses, and bacteria to grow and spread, but fourteenth-century people—lay, scholarly, and medical—thought in terms of “poisons” in the air or “corrupted air” rather than germs. This “corrupted air” came from swamps, unburied animal or human corpses, too much rain, the position of planets or stars, or perhaps other causes. The poisons caused illness, which doctors thought of as an imbalance in the fluids in the body, especially blood. Certain symptoms of the plague, especially bleeding and vomiting, were believed to be the body’s natural reaction to too much fluid. These were often symptoms of other illnesses as well, and doctors frequently prescribed bloodletting, that is, taking blood from the body by applying leeches or making small cuts in veins, as standard treatment. If the plague came from poisoned air, people reasoned, then strong-smelling herbs or other substances, like rosemary, juniper, or sulfur, held in front of the nose or burned as incense might stop it. Perhaps loud sounds like ringing church bells or firing the newly invented cannon might help. Medicines made from plants that were bumpy or that oozed liquid might work, keeping the more dangerous swelling and oozing of the plague away. Because the plague seemed to strike randomly, perhaps wearing jewelry with random number and letter combinations, or drinking water in which ink used to write these magical combinations had been dissolved, would help. Such letter and number combinations, called cryptograms, were especially popular in Muslim areas. They were often the first letters of words in prayers or religious sayings, and they gave people a sense of order when faced with the randomness with which the plague seemed to strike.

The Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375), describing the course of the disease in Florence in the preface to his book of tales, The Decameron, identified what many knew—that the disease passed from person to person: Moreover, the virulence of the pest was the greater by reason that intercourse was apt to convey it from the sick to the whole, just as fire devours things dry or greasy when they are brought close to it. Nay, the evil went yet further, for not merely by speech or association with the sick was the malady communicated to the healthy with consequent peril of common death, but any that touched the clothes of the sick or aught else that had been touched or used by them, seemed thereby to contract the disease.1 Improve Your Grade Primary Source: The Plague Hits Florence

Wealthier people often fled cities for the countryside, though sometimes this simply spread the plague faster. Some cities tried shutting their gates to prevent infected people and animals from coming in, which worked in a few cities. They also walled up houses in which there was plague, trying to isolate those who were still healthy from the sick. When the disease struck the town of Salé in Morocco, Ibu Abu Madyan shut in the members of his household with sufficient food and water and allowed no one to enter or leave until the plague had passed. Abu Madyan was entirely successful. Along with looking for medical causes and cures, people also searched for scapegoats, and savage cruelty sometimes resulted. Many people believed that the Jews had poisoned the wells of Christian communities and thereby infected the drinking water. This charge led to the murder of thousands of Jews across Europe. According to one chronicler, sixteen thousand were killed at the imperial city of Strasbourg alone in 1349. Though sixteen thousand is probably a typical medieval numerical exaggeration, the horror of the massacre is not lessened. Scholars have yet to explain the economic impact that the loss of so many productive people had on Strasbourg and other cities. If medical science had no effective treatment, could victims’ suffering be eased? Perhaps it could, in hospitals. What was the geographical distribution of hospitals, and, although our estimates of medieval populations remain rough, what was the hospital-to-population ratio? How many patients could a hospital serve? Whereas earlier the feudal lord had made philanthropic foundations, beginning in the thirteenth century individual merchants—out of compassion, generosity, and the custom of giving to

parish collections, and in the belief that the sick would be prayerful intercessors with God for the donors’ sins— endowed hospitals. Business people established hospitals in the towns of northern France and Flanders; Milan, Genoa, and Venice were well served, and the thirty hospitals in Florence provided a thousand beds in 1339. Sixty hospitals served Paris in 1328—but probably not enough for its population of two hundred thousand. The many hospitals in the Iberian Peninsula continued the Muslim tradition of care for the poor and ill. Merchants in the larger towns of the German Empire, in Poland, and in Hungary also founded hospitals in the fourteenth century, generally later than those in western Europe. Sailors, long viewed as potential carriers of disease, benefited from hospitals reserved for them; in 1300 the Venetian government paid a surgeon to care for sick sailors. At the time the plague erupted, therefore, most towns and cities had hospital facilities. When trying to determine the number of people a hospital could accommodate, the modern researcher considers the number of beds, the size of the staff, and the building’s physical layout. Since each medieval hospital bed might serve two or more patients, we cannot calculate the number of patients on the basis of the beds alone. We do know that rural hospices usually had twelve to fifteen beds, and city hospitals, as at Lisbon, Narbonne, and Genoa, had on average twenty-five to thirty beds, but these figures do not tell us how many patients were accommodated. Only the very rare document listing the number of wrapping sheets and coffins for the dead purchased in a given period provides the modern scholar with information on the number of patients a hospital had. Hospitals could offer only shelter, compassion, and care for the dying. Many people did not see the plague as a medical issue, but instead interpreted it as the result of something within themselves. God must be punishing them for terrible sins, they thought, so the best remedies were religious ones: asking for forgiveness, praying, trusting in God, making donations to churches, and trying to live better lives. In Muslim areas, religious leaders urged virtuous living in the face of death: give to the poor, reconcile with your enemies, free your slaves, and say a proper goodbye to your friends and family.

Apago PDF Enhancer Patients in a Hospital Ward, Fifteenth Century In many cities hospitals could not cope with the large numbers of plague victims. The practice of putting two or more adults in the same bed, as shown here, contributed to the spread of the disease. At the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris, nurses complained of being forced to put eight to ten children in a single bed in which a patient had recently died. (Giraudon/The Bridgeman Art Library)

plague was often exemplary. Priests, monks, and nuns cared for the sick and buried the dead. In places like Venice, from which even physicians fled, priests remained to give what ministrations they could. Consequently, their mortality rate was phenomenally high. The German clergy especially suffered a severe decline in personnel in the years after 1350. In taking their pastoral responsibilities seriously, some clergy did things that the church in a later age would vigorously condemn. The institutional church has traditionally opposed letting laymen and, especially, laywomen administer the sacraments. But the shortage of priests was so great that in 1349 Ralph, bishop of Bath and Wells in England (1329–1363), advised his people that “if they are on the point of death and cannot secure the services of a priest, then they should make confession to each other, as is permitted in the teaching of the Apostles, whether to a layman or, if no man is present, even to a woman.”2

Economic historians and demographers sharply dispute the impact of the plague on the economy in the late fourteenth century. The traditional view that the plague had a disastrous effect has been greatly modified. The clearest evidence comes from England, where the agrarian economy showed remarkable resilience. While the severity of the disease varied from region to region, it appears that by about 1375 most landlords enjoyed revenues near those of the pre-plague years. By the early fifteenth century seigneurial prosperity reached a medieval peak. Why? The answer appears to lie in the fact that England and many parts of Europe suffered from overpopulation in the early fourteenth century. Population losses caused by the Black Death led to increased productivity by restoring a more efficient balance between labor, land, and capital. What impact did visits of the plague have on urban populations? The rich evidence from a census of the city of Florence and its surrounding territory taken between

1427 and 1430 is fascinating. The region had suffered repeated epidemics since 1347. In a total population of 260,000 persons, 15 percent were age sixty or over (a very high proportion), suggesting that the plague took the young rather than the mature. Children and youths up to age nineteen constituted 44 percent of the people. Adults between the ages of twenty and fifty-nine, the most economically productive group, represented 41 percent of Florentine society. The high mortality rate of craftsmen led Florentine guilds to recruit many new members. For example, between 1328 and 1347 the silk merchants guild accepted 730 members, and between 1408 and 1427 it admitted 784. It appears that economic organizations tried to keep their numbers constant, even though the size of the population and its pool of potential guild members was shrinking. Moreover, in contrast to the pre-1348 period, many new members of the guilds were not related to existing members. Thus the post-plague years represent an age of “new men.” The Black Death brought on a general European inflation. High mortality produced a fall in production, shortages of goods, and a general rise in prices. The

shortage of labor and workers’ demands for higher wages put guild masters on the defensive. They retaliated with measures such as the Statute of Laborers (1351), an attempt by the English Parliament to freeze the wages of English workers at pre-1347 levels. Such statutes could not be enforced and thus were unsuccessful. The price of wheat in most of Europe increased, as did the costs of meat, sausage, and cheese. This inflation continued to the end of the fourteenth century. But wages in the towns rose faster, and the broad mass of people enjoyed a higher standard of living. Population decline meant a sharp increase in per capita wealth. The greater demand for labor meant greater mobility for peasants in rural areas and for industrial workers in the towns and cities. Labor shortages caused by the Black Death throughout the Mediterranean region, from Constantinople to Spain, presented aggressive businessmen with a golden opportunity, and the price of slaves rose sharply. Even more significant than the social effects were the psychological consequences. The knowledge that the disease meant almost certain death provoked the most profound pessimism. Imagine an entire society in the grip of the belief that it was at the mercy of a frightful affliction

Flagellants In this manuscript illumination from 1349, shirtless flagellants scourge themselves with whips as they walk through the streets of the Flemish city of Tournai. The text notes that they are asking for God’s grace to return to the city after it had been struck with the “most grave” illness. (HIP/Art Resource, NY)

about which nothing could be done, a disgusting disease from which family and friends would flee, leaving one to die alone and in agony. It is not surprising that some sought release in wild living, while others turned to the severest forms of asceticism and frenzied religious fervor. Some extremists joined groups of flagellants, who whipped and scourged themselves as penance for their and society’s sins in the belief that the Black Death was God’s punishment for humanity’s wickedness. Groups of flagellants traveled from town to town, often provoking hysteria against Jews and growing into unruly mobs. Officials worried that they would provoke violence and riots, and ordered groups of them to disband or forbade them to enter cities. Plague ripped apart the social fabric. In the thirteenth century, funerals, traditionally occasions
