        "text": "§1.861-4 Compensation for labor or personal services.\n\n(a) Compensation for labor or personal services performed wholly within the United States. (1) Generally, compensation for labor or personal services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items, performed wholly within the United States is gross income from sources within the United States. * * *\n\n* * * * *\n\n(b) Compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States—(1) Compensation for labor or personal services performed by persons other than individuals—(i) In general. In the case of compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States by a person other than an individual, the part of that compensation that is attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States, and that is therefore included in gross income as income from sources within the United States, is determined on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of the income under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will be such that an apportionment on the time basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, will be acceptable.\n\n(ii) Example. The application of paragraph (b)(1)(i) is illustrated by the following example.\n\nExample. Corp X, a domestic corporation, receives compensation of $150,000 under a contract for services to be performed concurrently in the United States and in several foreign countries by numerous Corp X employees. Each Corp X employee performing services under this contract performs his or her services exclusively in one jurisdiction. Although the number of employees (and hours spent by employees) performing services under the contract within the United States equals the number of employees (and hours spent by employees) performing services under the contract without the United States, the compensation paid to employees performing services under the contract within the United States is higher because of the more sophisticated nature of the services performed by the employees within the United States. Accordingly, the payroll cost for employees performing services under the contract within the United States is $20,000 out of a total contract payroll cost of $30,000. Under these facts and circumstances, a determination based upon relative payroll costs would be the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of the income received under the contract. Thus, of the $150,000 of compensation included in Corp X’s gross income, $100,000 ($150,000 x $20,000/$30,000) is attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States and $50,000 ($150,000 x $10,000/$30,000) is attributable to the labor or personal services performed without the United States.\n\n(2) Compensation for labor or personal services performed by an individual—(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, in the case of compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States by an individual, the part of such compensation that is attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States, and that is therefore included in gross income as income from sources within the United States, is determined on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of that income under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will be such that an apportionment on a time basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, will be acceptable.\n\n(ii) Employee compensation—(A) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, in the case of compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States by an individual as an employee, the part of such compensation that is attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States, and that is therefore included in gross income as income from sources within the United States, is determined on a time basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section.\n\n(B) Certain fringe benefits sourced on a geographical basis. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, items of compensation of an individual as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States that are described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(D)(1) through (6) of this section are sourced on a geographical basis in accordance with those paragraphs.\n\n(C) Exceptions and special rules—(1) Alternative basis—(i) Individual as an employee generally. An individual may determine the source of his or her compensation as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States under an alternative basis if the individual establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that, under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, the alternative basis more properly determines the source of the compensation than a basis described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B), whichever is applicable, of this section. An individual that uses an alternative basis must retain in his or her records documentation setting forth why the alternative basis more properly determines the source of the compensation. In addition, the individual must provide the information related to the alternative basis required by applicable Federal tax forms and accompanying instructions.\n\n(ii) Determination by Commissioner. The Commissioner may, under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, determine the source of compensation that is received by an individual as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States under an alternative basis other than a basis described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section if such compensation either is not for a specific time period or constitutes in substance a fringe benefit described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section notwithstanding a failure to meet any requirement of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. The Commissioner may make this determination only if such alternative basis determines the source of compensation in a more reasonable manner than the basis used by the individual pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.\n\n(2) Ruling or other administrative pronouncement with respect to groups of taxpayers. The Commissioner may, by ruling or other administrative pronouncement applying to similarly situated taxpayers generally, permit individuals to determine the source of their compensation as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States under an alternative basis. Any such individual shall be treated as having met the requirement to establish such alternative basis to the satisfaction of the Commissioner under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, provided that the individual meets the other requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(1)(i) of this section. The Commissioner also may, by ruling or other administrative pronouncement, indicate the circumstances in which he will require individuals to determine the source of certain compensation as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States under an alternative basis pursuant to the authority under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(1)(ii) of this section.\n\n(3) Artists and athletes. [Reserved.]\n\n(D) Fringe benefits sourced on a geographical basis. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, compensation of an individual as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States in the form of the following fringe benefits is sourced on a geographical basis as indicated in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D). The amount of the compensation in the form of the fringe benefit must be reasonable, and the individual must substantiate such amounts by adequate records or by sufficient evidence under rules similar to those set forth in §1.274-5T(c) or (h) or §1.132-5. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D), the term principal place of work has the same meaning that it has for purposes of section 217 and §1.217-2(c)(3).\n\n(1) Housing fringe benefit. The source of compensation in the form of a housing fringe benefit is determined based on the location of the individual’s principal place of work. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(1), a housing fringe benefit includes payments to or on behalf of an individual (and the individual’s family if the family resides with the individual) only for rent, utilities (other than telephone charges), real and personal property insurance, occupancy taxes not deductible under section 164 or 216(a), nonrefundable fees paid for securing a leasehold, rental of furniture and accessories, household repairs, residential parking, and the fair rental value of housing provided in kind by the individual’s employer. A housing fringe benefit does not include payments for expenses or items set forth in §1.911-4(b)(2).\n\n(2) Education fringe benefit. The source of compensation in the form of an education fringe benefit for the education expenses of the individual’s dependents is determined based on the location of the individual’s principal place of work. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(2), an education fringe benefit includes payments only for qualified tuition and expenses of the type described in section 530(b)(4)(A)(i) (regardless of whether incurred in connection with enrollment or attendance at a school) and expenditures for room and board and uniforms as described in section 530(b)(4)(A)(ii) with respect to education at an elementary or secondary educational institution.\n\n(3) Local transportation fringe benefit. The source of compensation in the form of a local transportation fringe benefit is determined based on the location of the individual’s principal place of work. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3), an individual’s local transportation fringe benefit is the amount that the individual receives as compensation for local transportation of the individual or the individual’s spouse or dependents at the location of the individual’s principal place of work. The amount treated as a local transportation fringe benefit is limited to the actual expenses incurred for local transportation and the fair rental value of any vehicle provided by the employer and used predominantly by the individual or the individual’s spouse or dependents for local transportation. For this purpose, actual expenses incurred for local transportation do not include the cost (including interest) of the purchase by the individual, or on behalf of the individual, of an automobile or other vehicle.\n\n(4) Tax reimbursement fringe benefit. The source of compensation in the form of a foreign tax reimbursement fringe benefit is determined based on the location of the jurisdiction that imposed the tax for which the individual is reimbursed.\n\n(5) Hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit. The source of compensation in the form of a hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit is determined based on the location of the hazardous or hardship duty zone for which the hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit is paid. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(5), a hazardous or hardship duty zone is any place in a foreign country which is either designated by the Secretary of State as a place where living conditions are extraordinarily difficult, notably unhealthy, or where excessive physical hardships exist, and for which a post differential of 15 percent or more would be provided under section 5925(b) of Title 5 of the U.S. Code to any officer or employee of the U.S. Government present at that place, or where a civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions threatens physical harm or imminent danger to the health and well-being of the individual. Compensation provided an employee during the period that the employee performs labor or personal services in a hazardous or hardship duty zone may be treated as a hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit only if the employer provides the hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit only to employees performing labor or personal services in a hazardous or hardship duty zone. The amount of compensation treated as a hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit may not exceed the maximum amount that the U.S. government would allow its officers or employees present at that location.\n\n(6) Moving expense reimbursement fringe benefit. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(6), the source of compensation in the form of a moving expense reimbursement is determined based on the location of the employee’s new principal place of work. The source of such compensation is determined based on the location of the employee’s former principal place of work, however, if the individual provides sufficient evidence that such determination of source is more appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(6), sufficient evidence generally requires an agreement, between the employer and the employee, or a written statement of company policy, which is reduced to writing before the move and which is entered into or established to induce the employee or employees to move to another country. Such written statement or agreement must state that the employer will reimburse the employee for moving expenses that the employee incurs to return to the employee’s former principal place of work regardless of whether he or she continues to work for the employer after returning to that location. The writing may contain certain conditions upon which the right to reimbursement is determined as long as those conditions set forth standards that are definitely ascertainable and can only be fulfilled prior to, or through completion of, the employee’s return move to the employee’s former principal place of work.\n\n(E) Time basis. The amount of compensation for labor or personal services performed within the United States determined on a time basis is the amount that bears the same relation to the individual’s total compensation as the number of days of performance of the labor or personal services by the individual within the United States bears to his or her total number of days of performance of labor or personal services. A unit of time less than a day may be appropriate for purposes of this calculation. The time period for which the compensation for labor or personal services is made is presumed to be the calendar year in which the labor or personal services are performed, unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, or the Commissioner determines, that another distinct, separate, and continuous period of time is more appropriate. For example, a transfer during a year from a position in the United States to a foreign posting that lasted through the end of that year would generally establish two separate time periods within that taxable year. The first of these time periods would be the portion of the year preceding the start of the foreign posting, and the second of these time periods would be the portion of the year following the start of the foreign posting. However, in the case of a foreign posting that requires short-term returns to the United States to perform services for the employer, such short-term returns would not be sufficient to establish distinct, separate, and continuous time periods within the foreign posting time period but would be relevant to the allocation of compensation relating to the overall time period. In each case, the source of the compensation on a time basis is based upon the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) in that separate time period.\n\n(F) Multi-year compensation arrangements. The source of multi-year compensation is determined generally on a time basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, over the period to which such compensation is attributable. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F), multi-year compensation means compensation that is included in the income of an individual in one taxable year but that is attributable to a period that includes two or more taxable years. The determination of the period to which such compensation is attributable, for purposes of determining its source, is based upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. For example, an amount of compensation that specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar years is attributable to the entirety of that multi-year period. The amount of such compensation that is treated as from sources within the United States is the amount that bears the same relationship to the total multi-year compensation as the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that labor or personal services were performed within the United States in connection with the project bears to the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that labor or personal services were performed in connection with the project. In the case of stock options, the facts and circumstances generally will be such that the applicable period to which the compensation is attributable is the period between the grant of an option and the date on which all employment-related conditions for its exercise have been satisfied (the vesting of the option).\n\n(G) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii):\n\nExample 1. B, a nonresident alien individual, was employed by Corp M, a domestic corporation, from March 1 to December 25 of the taxable year, a total of 300 days, for which B received compensation in the amount of $80,000. Under B’s employment contract with Corp M, B was subject to call at all times by Corp M and was in a payment status on a 7-day week basis. Pursuant to that contract, B performed services (or was available to perform services) within the United States for 180 days and performed services (or was available to perform services) without the United States for 120 days. None of B’s $80,000 compensation was for fringe benefits as identified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. B determined the amount of compensation that is attributable to his labor or personal services performed within the United States on a time basis under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (E) of this section. B did not assert, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(1)(i) of this section, that, under the particular facts and circumstances, an alternative basis more properly determines the source of that compensation than the time basis. Therefore, B must include in income from sources within the United States $48,000 ($80,000 x 180/300) of his compensation from Corporation M.\n\nExample 2. (i) Same facts as in Example 1 except that Corp M had a company-wide arrangement with its employees, including B, that they would receive an education fringe benefit, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(2) of this section, while working in the United States. During the taxable year, B incurred education expenses for his dependent daughter that qualified for the education fringe benefit in the amount of $10,000, for which B received a reimbursement from Corp M. B did not maintain adequate records or sufficient evidence of this fringe benefit as required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. When B filed his Federal income tax return for the taxable year, B did not apply paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(2) of this section to treat the compensation in the form of the education fringe benefit as income from sources within the United States, the location of his principal place of work during the 300-day period. Rather, B combined the $10,000 reimbursement with his base compensation of $80,000 and applied the time basis of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section to determine the source of his gross income.\n\n(ii) On audit, B argues that because he failed to substantiate the education fringe benefit in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, his entire employment compensation from Corp M is sourced on a time basis pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. The Commissioner, after reviewing Corp M’s fringe benefit arrangement, determines, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(1)(ii) of this section, that the $10,000 educational expense reimbursement constitutes in substance a fringe benefit described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(2) of this section, notwithstanding a failure to meet all of the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, and that an alternative geographic source basis, under the facts and circumstances of this particular case, is a more reasonable manner to determine the source of the compensation than the time basis used by B.\n\nExample 3. (i) A, a United States citizen, is employed by Corp N, a domestic corporation. A’s principal place of work is in the United States. A earns an annual salary of $100,000. During the first quarter of the calendar year (which is also A’s taxable year), A performed services entirely within the United States. At the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year, A was transferred to Country X for the remainder of the year and received, in addition to her annual salary, $30,000 in fringe benefits that are attributable to her new principal place of work in Country X. Corp N paid these fringe benefits separately from A’s annual salary. Corp N supplied A with a statement detailing that $25,000 of the fringe benefit was paid for housing, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(1) of this section, and $5,000 of the fringe benefit was paid for local transportation, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3) of this section. None of the local transportation fringe benefit is excluded from the employee’s gross income as a qualified transportation fringe benefit under section 132(a)(5). Under A’s employment contract, A was required to work on a 5-day week basis, Monday through Friday. During the last three quarters of the year, A performed services 30 days in the United States and 150 days in Country X and other foreign countries.\n\n(ii) A determined the source of all of her compensation from Corp N pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A), (B), and (D)(1) and (3) of this section. A did not assert, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(1)(i) of this section, that, under the particular facts and circumstances, an alternative basis more properly determines the source of that compensation than the bases set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A), (B), and (D)(1) and (3) of this section. However, in applying the time basis set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, A establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the first quarter of the calendar year and the last three quarters of the calendar year are two separate, distinct, and continuous periods of time. Accordingly, $25,000 of A’s annual salary is attributable to the first quarter of the year (25 percent of $100,000). This amount is entirely compensation that was attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States and is, therefore, included in gross income as income from sources within the United States. The balance of A’s compensation as an employee of Corp N, $105,000 (which includes the $30,000 in fringe benefits that are attributable to the location of A’s principal place of work in Country X), is compensation attributable to the final three quarters of her taxable year. During those three quarters, A’s periodic performance of services in the United States does not result in distinct, separate, and continuous periods of time. Of the $75,000 paid for annual salary, $12,500 (30/180 x $75,000) is compensation that was attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States and $62,500 (150/180 x $75,000) is compensation that was attributable to the labor or personal services performed outside the United States. Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(1) and (3) of this section, A sourced the $25,000 received for the housing fringe benefit and the $5,000 received for the local transportation fringe benefit based on the location of her principal place of work, Country X. Accordingly, A included the $30,000 in fringe benefits in her gross income as income from sources without the United States.\n\nExample 4. Same facts as in Example 3. Of the 150 days during which A performed services in Country X and in other foreign countries (during the final three quarters of A’s taxable year), she performed 30 days of those services in Country Y. Country Y is a country designated by the Secretary of State as a place where living conditions are extremely difficult, notably unhealthy, or where excessive physical hardships exist and for which a post differential of 15 percent or more would be provided under section 5925(b) of Title 5 of the U.S. Code to any officer or employee of the U.S. government present at that place. Corp N has a policy of paying its employees a $65 premium per day for each day worked in countries so designated. The $65 premium per day does not exceed the maximum amount that the U.S. government would pay its officers or employees stationed in Country Y. Because A performed services in Country Y for 30 days, she earned additional compensation of $1,950. The $1,950 is considered a hazardous duty or hardship pay fringe benefit and is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(5) of this section based on the location of the hazardous or hardship duty zone, Country Y. Accordingly, A included the amount of the hazardous duty or hardship pay fringe benefit ($1,950) in her gross income as income from sources without the United States.\n\nExample 5. (i) During 2006 and 2007, Corp P, a domestic corporation, employed four United States citizens, E, F, G, and H to work in its manufacturing plant in Country V. As part of his or her compensation package, each employee arranged for local transportation unrelated to Corp P’s business needs. None of the local transportation fringe benefit is excluded from the employee’s gross income as a qualified transportation fringe benefit under section 132(a)(5) and (f).\n\n(ii) Under the terms of the compensation package that E negotiated with Corp P, Corp P permitted E to use an automobile owned by Corp P. In addition, Corp P agreed to reimburse E for all expenses incurred by E in maintaining and operating the automobile, including gas and parking. Provided that the local transportation fringe benefit meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3) of this section, E’s compensation with respect to the fair rental value of the automobile and reimbursement for the expenses E incurred is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(3) of this section based on E’s principal place of work in Country V. Thus, the local transportation fringe benefit will be included in E’s gross income as income from sources without the United States.\n\n(iii) Under the terms of the compensation package that F negotiated with Corp P, Corp P let F use an automobile owned by Corp P. However, Corp P did not agree to reimburse F for any expenses incurred by F in maintaining and operating the automobile. Provided that the local transportation fringe benefit meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3) of this section, F’s compensation with respect to the fair rental value of the automobile is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(3) of this section based on F’s principal place of work in Country V. Thus, the local transportation fringe benefit will be included in F’s gross income as income from sources without the United States.\n\n(iv) Under the terms of the compensation package that G negotiated with Corp P, Corp P agreed to reimburse G for the purchase price of an automobile that G purchased in Country V. Corp P did not agree to reimburse G for any expenses incurred by G in maintaining and operating the automobile. Because the cost to purchase an automobile is not a local transportation fringe benefit as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3) of this section, the source of the compensation to G will be determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (C) of this section.\n\n(v) Under the terms of the compensation package that H negotiated with Corp P, Corp P agreed to reimburse H for the expenses that H incurred in maintaining and operating an automobile, including gas and parking, which H purchased in Country V. Provided that the local transportation fringe benefit meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3) of this section, H’s compensation with respect to the reimbursement for the expenses H incurred is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(3) of this section based on H’s principal place of work in Country V. Thus, the local transportation fringe benefit will be included in H’s gross income as income from sources without the United States.\n\nExample 6. (i) On January 1, 2006, Company Q compensates employee J with a grant of options to which section 421 does not apply that do not have a readily ascertainable fair market value when granted. The stock options permit J to purchase 100 shares of Company Q stock for $5 per share. The stock options do not become exercisable unless and until J performs services for Company Q (or a related company) for 5 years. J works for Company Q for the 5 years required by the stock option grant. In years 2006-08, J performs all of his services for Company Q within the United States. In 2009, J performs 1/2 of his services for Company Q within the United States and 1/2 of his services for Company Q without the United States. In year 2010, J performs his services entirely without the United States. On December 31, 2012, J exercises the options when the stock is worth $10 per share. J recognizes $500 in taxable compensation (($10-$5) x 100) in 2012.\n\n(ii) Under the facts and circumstances, the applicable period is the 5-year period between the date of grant (January 1, 2006) and the date the stock options become exercisable (December 31, 2010). On the date the stock options become exercisable, J performs all services necessary to obtain the compensation from Company Q. Accordingly, the services performed after the date the stock options become exercisable are not taken into account in sourcing the compensation from the stock options. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A), since J performs 31/2 years of services for Company Q within the United States and 11/2 years of services for Company Q without the United States during the 5-year period, 7/10 of the $500 of compensation (or $350) recognized in 2012 is income from sources within the United States and the remaining 3/10 of the compensation (or $150) is income from sources without the United States.\n\n* * * * *\n\n(d) Effective date. * * * Paragraph (b) and the first sentence of paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to taxable years beginning on or after July 14, 2005.\n\n§26.2651-1 Generation assignment.\n\n(a) Special rule for persons with a deceased parent—(1) In general. This paragraph (a) applies for purposes of determining whether a transfer to or for the benefit of an individual who is a descendant of a parent of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse) is a generation-skipping transfer. If that individual’s parent, who is a lineal descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse), is deceased at the time the transfer (from which an interest of such individual is established or derived) is subject to the tax imposed on the transferor by chapter 11 or 12 of the Internal Revenue Code, the individual is treated as if that individual were a member of the generation that is one generation below the lower of—\n\n(i) The transferor’s generation; or\n\n(ii) The generation assignment of the individual’s youngest living lineal ancestor who is also a descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse).\n\n(2) Special rules—(i) Corresponding generation adjustment. If an individual’s generation assignment is adjusted with respect to a transfer in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a corresponding adjustment with respect to that transfer is made to the generation assignment of each—\n\n(A) Spouse or former spouse of that individual;\n\n(B) Descendant of that individual; and\n\n(C) Spouse or former spouse of each descendant of that individual.\n\n(ii) Continued application of generation assignment. If a transfer to a trust would be a generation-skipping transfer but for paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any generation assignment determined under this paragraph (a) continues to apply in determining whether any subsequent distribution from (or termination of an interest in) the portion of the trust attributable to that transfer is a generation-skipping transfer.\n\n(iii) Ninety-day rule. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any individual who dies no later than 90 days after a transfer occurring by reason of the death of the transferor is treated as having predeceased the transferor.\n\n(iv) Local law. A living person is not treated as having predeceased the transferor solely by reason of a provision of applicable local law; e.g., an individual who disclaims is not treated as a predeceased parent solely because state law treats a disclaimant as having predeceased the transferor for purposes of determining the disposition of the disclaimed property.\n\n(3) Established or derived. For purposes of section 2651(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an individual’s interest is established or derived at the time the transferor is subject to transfer tax on the property. See §26.2652-1(a) for the definition of a transferor. If the same transferor, on more than one occasion, is subject to transfer tax imposed by either chapter 11 or 12 of the Internal Revenue Code on the property so transferred (whether the same property, reinvestments thereof, income thereon, or any or all of these), then the relevant time for determining whether paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies is the earliest time at which the transferor is subject to the tax imposed by either chapter 11 or 12 of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of section 2651(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the interest of a remainder beneficiary of a trust for which an election under section 2523(f) or section 2056(b)(7) (QTIP election) has been made will be deemed to have been established or derived, to the extent of the QTIP election, on the date as of which the value of the trust corpus is first subject to tax under section 2519 or section 2044. The preceding sentence does not apply to a trust, however, to the extent that an election under section 2652(a)(3) (reverse QTIP election) has been made for the trust because, to the extent of a reverse QTIP election, the spouse who established the trust will remain the transferor of the trust for generation-skipping transfer tax purposes.\n\n(4) Special rule in the case of additional contributions to a trust. If a transferor referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section contributes additional property to a trust that existed before the application of paragraph (a)(1), then the additional property is treated as being held in a separate trust for purposes of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code. The provisions of §26.2654-1(a)(2), regarding treatment as separate trusts, apply as if different transferors had contributed to the separate portions of the single trust. Additional subsequent contributions from that transferor will be added to the new share that is treated as a separate trust.\n\n(b) Limited application to collateral heirs. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply in the case of a transfer to any individual who is not a lineal descendant of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse) if the transferor has any living lineal descendant at the time of the transfer.\n\n(c) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:\n\nExample 1. T establishes an irrevocable trust, Trust, providing that trust income is to be paid to T’s grandchild, GC, for 5 years. At the end of the 5-year period or on GC’s prior death, Trust is to terminate and the principal is to be distributed to GC if GC is living or to GC’s children if GC has died. The transfer that occurred on the creation of the trust is subject to the tax imposed by chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code and, at the time of the transfer, T’s child, C, who is a parent of GC, is deceased. GC is treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below T’s generation. As a result, GC is not a skip person and Trust is not a skip person. Therefore, the transfer to Trust is not a direct skip. Similarly, distributions to GC during the term of Trust and at the termination of Trust will not be GSTs.\n\nExample 2. On January 1, 2004, T transfers $100,000 to an irrevocable inter vivos trust that provides T with an annuity payable for four years or until T’s prior death. The annuity satisfies the definition of a qualified interest under section 2702(b). When the trust terminates, the corpus is to be paid to T’s grandchild, GC. The transfer is subject to the tax imposed by chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code and, at the time of the transfer, T’s child, C, who is a parent of GC, is living. C dies in 2006. In this case, C was alive at the time the transfer by T was subject to the tax imposed by chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, section 2651(e) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply. When the trust subsequently terminates, the distribution to GC is a taxable termination that is subject to the GST tax to the extent the trust has an inclusion ratio greater than zero. See section 2642(a).\n\nExample 3. T dies testate in 2002, survived by T’s spouse, S, their children, C1 and C2, and C1’s child, GC. Under the terms of T’s will, a trust is established for the benefit of S and of T and S’s descendants. Under the terms of the trust, all income is payable to S during S’s lifetime and the trustee may distribute trust corpus for S’s health, support and maintenance. At S’s death, the corpus is to be distributed, outright, to C1 and C2. If either C1 or C2 has predeceased S, the deceased child’s share of the corpus is to be distributed to that child’s then-living descendants, per stirpes. The executor of T’s estate makes the election under section 2056(b)(7) to treat the trust property as qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) but does not make the election under section 2652(a)(3) (reverse QTIP election). In 2003, C1 dies survived by S and GC. In 2004, S dies, and the trust terminates. The full fair market value of the trust is includible in S’s gross estate under section 2044 and S becomes the transferor of the trust under section 2652(a)(1)(A). GC’s interest is considered established or derived at S’s death, and because C1 is deceased at that time, GC is treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below the generation of the transferor, S. As a result, GC is not a skip person and the transfer to GC is not a direct skip.\n\nExample 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3. However, the executor of T’s estate makes the election under section 2652(a)(3) (reverse QTIP election) for the entire trust. Therefore, T remains the transferor because, for purposes of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code, the election to be treated as qualified terminable interest property is treated as if it had not been made. In this case, GC’s interest is established or derived on T’s death in 2002. Because C1 was living at the time of T’s death, the predeceased parent rule under section 2651(e) does not apply, even though C1 was deceased at the time the transfer from S to GC was subject to the tax under chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code. When the trust terminates, the distribution to GC is a taxable termination that is subject to the GST tax to the extent the trust has an inclusion ratio greater than zero. See section 2642(a).\n\nExample 5. T establishes an irrevocable trust providing that trust income is to be paid to T’s grandniece, GN, for 5 years or until GN’s prior death. At the end of the 5-year period or on GN’s prior death, the trust is to terminate and the principal is to be distributed to GN if living, or if GN has died, to GN’s then-living descendants, per stirpes. S is a sibling of T and the parent of N. N is the parent of GN. At the time of the transfer, T has no living lineal descendant, S is living, N is deceased, and the transfer is subject to the gift tax imposed by chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code. GN is treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below T’s generation because S, GN’s youngest living lineal ancestor who is also a descendant of T’s parent, is in T’s generation. As a result, GN is not a skip person and the transfer to the trust is not a direct skip. In addition, distributions to GN during the term of the trust and at the termination of the trust will not be GSTs.\n\nExample 6. On January 1, 2004, T transfers $50,000 to a great-grandniece, GGN, who is the great-grandchild of B, a brother of T. At the time of the transfer, T has no living lineal descendants and B’s grandchild, GN, who is a parent of GGN and a child of B’s living child, N, is deceased. GGN will be treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below the lower of T’s generation or the generation assignment of GGN’s youngest living lineal ancestor who is also a descendant of the parent of the transferor. In this case, N is GGN’s youngest living lineal ancestor who is also a descendant of the parent of T. Because N’s generation assignment is lower than T’s generation, GGN will be treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below N’s generation assignment (i.e., GGN will be treated as a member of her parent’s generation). As a result, GGN remains a skip person and the transfer to GGN is a direct skip.\n\nExample 7. T has a child, C. C and C’s spouse, S, have a 20-year-old child, GC. C dies and S subsequently marries S2. S2 legally adopts GC. T transfers $100,000 to GC. Under section 2651(b)(1), GC is assigned to the generation that is two generations below T. However, since GC’s parent, C, is deceased at the time of the transfer, GC will be treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below T. As a result, GC is not a skip person and the transfer to GC is not a direct skip.\n\n§301.6343-3 Return of property in certain cases.\n\n(a) In general. If money has been levied upon and applied toward the taxpayer’s liability, or property has been levied upon and sold, and the receipts have been applied toward the taxpayer’s liability, or property has been levied upon and purchased by the United States and the United States still possesses the property, and the Commissioner determines that any of the conditions in paragraph (c) of this section exist, the Commissioner may return—\n\n(1) An amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon;\n\n(2) An amount of money equal to the amount of money received by the United States from a sale of the property; or\n\n(3) The specific property levied upon and purchased by the United States.\n\n(b) Return of levied upon property in possession of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pending sale under section 6335. Other than as provided in §301.6343-1(b) or in paragraph (d) of this section, the Commissioner, in his or her discretion, may return levied upon property that is in the possession of the United States pending sale under section 6335.\n\n(c) Conditions authorizing the return of property. The Commissioner may return property upon determining that one of the following conditions exist:\n\n(1) Premature or not in accordance with administrative procedures. The levy was premature or otherwise not in accordance with the administrative procedures of the Secretary.\n\n(2) Installment agreement. Subsequent to the levy, the taxpayer enters into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy the liability for which the levy was made by means of installment payments. If, however, the agreement specifically provides that already levied upon property will not be returned under section 6343(d), the Commissioner may not grant a request for return of property under this paragraph (c)(2).\n\n(3) Facilitate collection. The return of property will facilitate the collection of the tax liability for which the levy was made.\n\n(4) Best interests of the United States and the taxpayer—(i) In general. The taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) has consented to the return of property, and the return of property would be in the best interest of the taxpayer, as determined by the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate), and in the best interest of the United States, as determined by the Commissioner.\n\n(ii) Best interest of the taxpayer. The National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) generally will determine whether the return of property is in the best interest of the taxpayer. If, however, a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to return property and has not specifically requested the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) to determine the taxpayer’s best interest, a finding by the Commissioner that the return of property is in the best interest of the taxpayer will be sufficient to support the return of property. Only the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) may determine that a return of property is not in the best interest of the taxpayer.\n\n(5) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c):\n\nExample 1. A owes $1,000 in Federal income taxes. The IRS levies on a broker with respect to a money market account belonging to the taxpayer and receives payment from the broker which it applies to the taxpayer’s outstanding liability. However, the IRS failed to follow procedure provided by the Internal Revenue Manual (but not required by statute) with regard to managerial approval prior to the making of the levy. The Commissioner may return an amount of money equal to the amount of money the IRS levied upon and applied toward the taxpayer’s tax liability.\n\nExample 2. B owes $1,000 in Federal income taxes. The IRS levies on a bank with respect to a savings account belonging to the taxpayer and receives funds from the bank, which it applies to the taxpayer’s liability. Subsequent to the levy, B enters into an installment agreement, under which B will pay timely installments to satisfy the entire liability. The installment agreement does not by its terms preclude the return of levied upon property. The revenue officer verifies that B is financially capable of paying the entire liability, including accruals, in the agreed-upon installment payments. The Commissioner may return an amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon and applied toward the taxpayer’s liability.\n\nExample 3. C owns a house that is deteriorating and in unsalable condition. C is in the process of renovating the house for sale when the IRS levies upon C’s bank account for the payment of a $20,000 outstanding Federal tax liability and receives funds in the amount of $3,000, which it applies toward C’s liability. A notice of federal tax lien is the only lien encumbrancing the house. C requests that an amount of money equal to the amount seized from the bank account be returned so that C can complete the renovations on the house. Without the funds, C will be unable to complete the renovations and sell the house. Upon examination, the Commissioner determines that the IRS will be able to collect the entire tax liability if C’s house is restored to salable condition. If the National Taxpayer Advocate, or the Commissioner in lieu of the National Taxpayer Advocate, determines that the return of the seized money is in the taxpayer’s best interest, the Commissioner may return an amount of money equal to the amount seized from the bank account, in the best interest of the taxpayer and the United States.\n\n(d) Best Interests of the United States and the taxpayer to release levy and return of property where levy made in violation of law—(1) In general. If the IRS makes a levy in violation of the law, it is in the best interests of the United States and the taxpayer to release the levy and the IRS will return to the taxpayer any property obtained pursuant to the levy. For example, the IRS will release the levy and return the taxpayer’s property if the levy was made—\n\n(i) Without giving the requisite thirty-day notice of the right to a hearing under section 6330;\n\n(ii) During the pendency of a proceeding for refund of divisible tax in violation of section 6331(i);\n\n(iii) Before investigation of the status of levied upon property in violation of section 6331(j);\n\n(iv) During the pendency of an offer-in-compromise in violation of section 6331(k)(1); or\n\n(v) During the period an offer to enter into an installment agreement is pending (or for 30 days following the rejection of an offer, or, if the rejection is timely appealed, during the period that the appeal is pending) or during the period an installment agreement is in effect (or during the 30 days following a termination or, if a timely appeal of termination is filed, during the period the appeal is pending) in violation of section 6331(k)(2).\n\n(2) Property may not be credited to outstanding liability without the taxpayer’s permission. When the release of a levy and the return of property are required under this paragraph (d), the property or the proceeds from the sale of the property received by the IRS pursuant to the levy must be returned to the taxpayer unless the taxpayer requests otherwise. The property or proceeds of sale may not be credited to any outstanding tax liability of the taxpayer, including the one with respect to which the IRS made the levy, without the written permission of the taxpayer.\n\n(e) Time of return. Levied upon property in possession of the IRS (other than money) may be returned under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section at any time. An amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon or received from a sale of property may be returned at any time before the expiration of 9 months from the date of the levy. When a request for the return of money filed in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section is filed before the expiration of the 9-month period, or a determination to return an amount of money is made before the expiration of the 9-month period, the money may be returned within a reasonable period of time after the expiration of the 9-month period if additional time is necessary for investigation or processing.\n\n(f) Purchase by the United States. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e)(1)(C), the United States will be treated as having received an amount of money equal to the minimum price determined by the Commissioner before the sale.\n\n(g) Determinations by the Commissioner. The Commissioner must determine whether any of the conditions authorizing the return of property exists if a taxpayer submits a request for the return of property in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The Commissioner also may make this determination independently. If the Commissioner determines that conditions authorizing the return of property are not present, the Commissioner may not authorize the return of property. If the Commissioner determines that conditions authorizing the return of property are present, the Commissioner may (but is not required to, unless the reason for the return of property is that the levy was made in violation of law and is governed by paragraph (d) of this section) authorize the return of property. If the Commissioner decides independently to return property under paragraph (c)(4) of this section based on the best interests of the taxpayer and the United States, the taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) must consent to the return of property.\n\n(h) Procedures for request for the return of property—(1) Manner. A request for the return of property must be made in writing to the address on the levy form.\n\n(2) Form. The written request must include the following information—\n\n(i) The name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the person requesting the return of money (or property purchased by the United States);\n\n(ii) A description of the property levied upon;\n\n(iii) The date of the levy; and\n\n(iv) A statement of the grounds upon which the return of money is being requested (or property purchased by the United States).\n\n(i) No interest. No interest will be paid on any money returned under this section.\n\n(j) Administrative collection upon default. If the Commissioner returns property under this section, and the taxpayer fails to pay the previously assessed liability for which the levy was made on the returned property, the Commissioner may administratively collect the liability. Collection may include levying again on the returned property as long as statutory and administrative requirements are followed.\n\n(k) Effective date. This section is applicable on July 14, 2005.\n\nMark E. Matthews,\n\nDeputy Commissioner for\n\nServices and Enforcement.\n\nApproved June 30, 2005.\n\nEric Solomon,\n\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (Tax Policy).\n\nNote\n\n(Filed by the Office of the Federal Register on July 13, 2005, 8:45 a.m., and published in the issue of the Federal Register for July 14, 2005, 70 F.R. 40669)"
