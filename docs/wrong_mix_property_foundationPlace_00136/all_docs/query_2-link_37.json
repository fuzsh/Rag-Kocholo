        "text": "Studies of the basic trends of the regions’ development show that currently one of the priorities of each region is to expand cooperation between territorial communities in the framework of achieving common goals and objectives. Taking this into consideration, the purpose of the scientific article is to study the peculiarities of establishing interterritorial cooperation of amalgamated territorial communities (ATCs) as a tool to increase their capacity. The following documents are the methodological basis for studying the theoretical, methodological and practical features of establishing interterritorial cooperation of amalgamated territorial communities as a tool to increase their capacity, namely: The Law of Ukraine No. 1508-VII; regional development programs elaborated by European Commission for member states of European Union. The methods of theoretical analysis and synthesis and methods of comparison, description and observation have been used to reveal the purpose of the scientific article. It has been established that currently the key directions of ATCs’ interterritorial cooperation as tools to improve their capacity should include the following measures, namely: 1) improving of the population’s life quality; 2) improving the quality and accessibility of medical services; 3) improving the quality and accessibility of educational services; 3) improving the quality of infrastructure facilities; 4) attracting investment in the development of the territorial community; 5) satisfaction of the territorial community population’s needs for accessibility and market saturation with products; 6) increase in revenues to the budget of the territorial community and to the state budget, etc.. It has been found out that the interterritorial cooperation of ATCs should be based on the principles, defined by the Law of Ukraine “On Cooperation of Territorial Communities”, in particular, on the principle of legality, the principle of good faith, the principle of mutual benefit, the principle of transparency and openness, the principle of equal rights of participants and the principle of mutual responsibility of participants of interterritorial cooperation according to the results this cooperation. Based on the data of the State Service of Ukraine for Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre, it has been determined that currently about a thousand amalgamated territorial communities have been created in Ukraine, and according to Statistics Poland, there are currently 2460 gminas in Poland. In the context of the information processing provided by the OECD, it has been established that in Poland the basic principles of regional development are defined by the Strategy for Responsible Development for the period up to 2020 and the National Strategy of Regional Development 2010-20: Regions, Cities, Rural Areas. It has been found out that the European Commission has developed and implemented a number of programs to ensure the appropriate level of regional development in Poland, among which the special attention should be given to Operational Programme Development of Eastern Poland. It has been determined that the European Commission also developed and implemented the corresponding program for the Czech Republic (Integrated Regional Operational Programme), which is aimed at ensuring the development of the regions and territories of this country.\n\n\"This paper introduces a new field to organization studies – that of organizational territoriality – as well as introducing the papers to the special issue on The Territorial Organization. Organization seen as territory may function symbolically, offering an additional metaphor to those suggested by Morgan, or materially, taking into account existing studies of organizational space and architecture. This paper integrates perspectives from anthropology, human and economic geography, psychology, philosophy, history and literature to provide conceptual tools for developing the field. This includes considerations of macrolevel nation-state political economy and corporate power, with boundary marking and defence; the micro-level of psychosocial spaces; the meso-level of organizationally networked spaces; the role of maps and mapping; the materialities of landscape, terroir and practices of dwelling; the symbolic significance of taskscapes and vistas; mobile practices of wayfaring and nomadics; and processes of territorialization, deterritorialization and reterritorialization. We argue that organizational territoriality studies (OTS) brings together a number of disciplinary perspectives that combine understandings of space and time with power, embodiment and materiality to shed new light on issues of culture, identity and meaning. As such it forms not simply a disciplinary subfield of organization studies, which in one sense it clearly is, but also a space of articulation, translation and exchange between disciplines. Keywords: organizational territoriality; organizational space; terroir; taskscape; landscape; deterritorialization; reterritorialization; vistas; nomadics \""
