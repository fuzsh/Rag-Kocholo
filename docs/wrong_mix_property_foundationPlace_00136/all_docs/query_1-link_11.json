It is Company's policy to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.\n\nL) GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.\n\nUnless prohibited by local law, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement of this Agreement (below) shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Any action to compel arbitration, or challenging the enforceability or applicability of the arbitration provisions herein, must be filed in the federal or state courts of Delaware. Any action filed in any other court shall be transferred to, or dismissed without prejudice for refiling only in, the federal or state courts of Delaware, after removal to the appropriate federal court, if applicable, for determination by the Delaware federal or state court as to whether the action should be stayed pending, or otherwise referred to, arbitration. Any claims that are not referred to arbitration must be adjudicated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Delaware. For such claims, the federal and state courts of Delaware shall have exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue over you and us, and you and we waive any objection based on inconvenient forum. If either party files suit in any court other than the federal or state courts of Delaware, in deciding whether to transfer or dismiss the action, or otherwise give effect to this provision, the court shall apply the standard set forth in Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, 571 U.S. 49 (2013). The parties also agree that transfer or dismissal cannot be denied based on inconvenience to the parties, piecemeal adjudication of the claims, a risk of inconsistent findings of law or fact, the presence of other parties who are not party to these terms, or any other private or public consideration.\n\nYou agree that regardless of any law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Company Services and/or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\n\nNothing in this Agreement is intended to limit a party’s right to seek equitable relief. If the Arbitration Agreement (as set forth below) is held to be unenforceable, you and we agree that any claims or disputes that you or we have against each other must be resolved in the federal or state courts located in Delaware to the extent permissible by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims appropriately brought in small claims court may be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction. For the sake of clarity, the choice of Delaware law shall not exclude, limit or supersede a consumer’s rights or remedies under mandatory consumer protection laws in the jurisdiction where the consumer resides.\n\nM) ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.\n\nPurpose: This section of the Agreement (henceforth referred to as “Arbitration Agreement”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any Disputes that may arise between you and The Meet Group, Inc. Arbitration is a form of private Dispute (as defined below) resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their Disputes and potential Disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such Dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.\n\nPlease read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and The Meet Group, Inc. shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your and our right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).\n\nFor the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, “Tagged” means the Meet Group, Inc. and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Tagged regarding any aspect of your relationship with Tagged, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver in this Arbitration Agreement). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.\n\nYOU AND TAGGED EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\n\nPre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution: For all Disputes, you and we must first give each other an opportunity to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration. You must commence any Dispute you have with us by mailing written notification to The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) your phone number, (4) your email address used to create your Tagged account, (5) a written description of the Dispute, (6) a description of the specific relief you seek, and (7) your personal signature. If Tagged does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. We must commence any Dispute we have with you by sending you a written notification to the email address used to create your Tagged account that includes a written description of the Dispute and a description of the specific relief we seek. If the Dispute is not resolved to our satisfaction within 45 days after you receive our written notification, we may pursue our Dispute in arbitration. Either party may communicate directly with the other in an effort to satisfy or resolve any Dispute, including by communicating any offers or demands.\n\nArbitration Procedures: If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or Tagged may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration. However, this shall not preclude the application of the Mass Filing section below. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nFor arbitration before the AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000 USD, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 USD or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. This Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. However, this shall not preclude the application of the Mass Filing section below.\n\nIn the event of a mass filing (defined in the section titled Mass Filing below), the procedures, fees, and costs described in the Mass Filing section will govern notwithstanding any applicable rule of the arbitration provider to the contrary.\n\nBecause your contract with Tagged, the Agreement, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.\n\nArbitration Award: The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\n\nLocation of Arbitration: The arbitration may be heard in Delaware, as otherwise required by the arbitration provider’s rules, or in another location mutually agreed to by the parties. The parties may appear via teleconference as though they were appearing in person unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator.\n\nPayment of Arbitration Fees and Costs: The initiating party must pay all filing fees that the arbitration provider requires to be paid by the initiating party. Your and our responsibility to pay other administrative and arbitrator fees and costs will also be as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is responsible for reimbursing the respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, filing, and/or other fees incurred as a result of the frivolous claim. The arbitration provider may also impose such obligation on the claimant’s attorneys. Fees, costs, and sanctions may also be awarded in the arbitration against a party of a party’s attorney as provided pursuant to applicable law. You may qualify for a waiver of certain arbitration costs under the arbitration provider’s rules or other applicable law. If you meet the standard for proceeding in forma pauperis in federal court, Delaware state court, or the courts of your state of residence, cannot obtain a waiver from the arbitration provider of any filing fees you are required to pay, and the arbitration provider refuses to administer the arbitration without your payment of said fees, Tagged will pay the filing fees for you.\n\nClass Action Waiver: The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action), except as set forth in the Mass Filing section below, unless both you and Tagged specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other member or user of the Tagged and hi5 services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding, except as set forth in the Mass Filing section below.\n\nLimitation of Procedural Rights: You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and Tagged are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Tagged might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). You and we give up those rights. Other rights that you or we would have if you or we went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.\n\nSeverability: If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above and Mass Filing clause below) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver or Mass Filing clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.\n\nContinuation: This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with Tagged and your use of the Tagged and hi5 services.\n\nMass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against us or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, or if we assert 25 or more similar demands for arbitration or counterclaims against similarly situated parties, within a period of 60 days or otherwise close in proximity (“Mass Filing”), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply:\n\nAcknowledgment of Mass Filing Protocols. If you or we, or you or our counsel, files a demand for arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you and we agree that the demand for arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection. If the parties disagree as to whether a series of filings fits within the definition of Mass Filing above, the arbitration provider shall resolve the disagreement. You and we also acknowledge that the adjudication of the dispute may be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time of filing of the demand for arbitration, and pending resolution of the bellwether proceedings.\n\nBellwether Arbitrations. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators where there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. The parties shall select ten individual arbitration claims (five per side), designated the “Initial Test Cases,” to proceed to arbitration. Only the Initial Test Cases shall be filed with the arbitrator. All other claims shall be held in abeyance. This means that the filing fees will be paid only for the Initial Test Cases; for all other demands for arbitration in a Mass Filing, the filing fees (together with any arbitrator consideration of the other demands) will be in abeyance, and neither you nor Tagged will be required to pay any such filing fees. You and Tagged also agree that neither you nor we shall be deemed to be in breach of this Arbitration Agreement for failure to pay any such filing fees, and that neither you nor we shall be entitled to any contractual, statutory, or other remedies, damages, or sanctions of any kind for failure to pay any such filing fees. If, pursuant to this subsection, a party files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance and not refer them to the arbitrator pending resolution of the Initial Test Cases. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.\n\nGlobal Mediation. Following the resolution of the Initial Test Cases, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all the remaining individual arbitration claims comprising the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”), deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Initial Test Cases until the Initial Test Cases and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded. After the final awards are provided to the mediator in the Initial Test Cases, the mediator and the parties shall have 90 days to agree upon a substantive methodology and make an offer to resolve the outstanding cases.

Service Description\n\n1.1. Once you have signed up for an account, we will provide you with access to an online platform over which you will be able to get know other registered customers (also known as members). The Service can only be accessed via mobile apps on iOS and Android devices (although, in the future, other operating systems may be made available), or via our Tagged and/or Hi5 website (please note that certain features are only available via the mobile app or web); and the Service includes some services that are free and some that are chargeable.\n\n1.2. The Service contains member \"profiles\", which contain content (also referred to as \"data\") made available by those members. You can also find more information about the types of personal information that are collected and how this information is made available to other members in our Privacy Policy (see Clause 5 below). We offer our Service globally; and it is possible for our members to search for and contact other members in any of the countries in which we operate.\n\n2. Access to the Service and Conclusion of your Subscription\n\n2.1. To access and use the Service you will need to register. To do this, you will need to choose an available registration option, such as email, SMS, Sign in with Apple, Sign in with Google or Facebook, and provide login credentials, such as email address and a password of your choice. You are responsible for keeping your password and account credentials confidential. Furthermore, you are responsible for any and all culpably caused activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security once you receive knowledge of it.\n\n2.2. Once you have successfully registered, you will be able to access our free-of-charge Service (\"Basic Membership\").\n\n2.3. We also offer various services or features that are subject to a fee. Before you sign up to purchase such services or features, we will provide you with further information about what you will be purchasing, for example, where applicable: the main characteristics of the services or features, the term of your subscription (including any extension), how to terminate your subscription, the price and any payment conditions and limitations of means of payment. In case you purchase Virtual Goods (see Clause 3.3 below), we will further inform you that these are redeemable only on the Service for digital merchandise and content and that they are not refundable. If you want to upgrade your Basic Membership by choosing a membership that is subject to a fee (\"Premium Membership\"), or access any other services or features subject to a fee, you acknowledge that by pressing the \"Buy now\"-button (or comparable button), you will have confirmed that you want to purchase the Premium Membership or other services or features that you have selected. Our contractual relationship for such purchases will be confirmed on the date that you receive a confirmation of your order. Please note, however, that the fulfilment of your payment obligation to us is subject to the respective payment service provider verifying and processing the purchase.\n\n2.4. You can also make purchases via our Apple iOS app or Google Android app. This includes purchasing a Premium Membership or any other services or features subject to a fee. In this case, we remain responsible for the provision of our Service. You will receive an order confirmation regarding your Subscription Terms after any such purchase. However, any purchase and/or subscription is concluded (and must be cancelled or terminated) through Apple / Google only (see Clause 5.3), and is subject to the technical standards and principles established by Apple / Google, over which we have no control. As a rule, a purchase via an app store will take place when you click on \"Buy now\" (or a comparable button) and, when required, you enter your password or equivalent credentials (e.g., touch ID or face ID) for the app store. Your contractual relationship with Apple / Google will be confirmed on the date that Apple / Google sends you an email confirmation of your order; and Apple / Google will invoice you for any Premium Membership charges through your Apple / Google account. You will also find in the app store all the essential information that you need about your contractual relationship with Apple / Google. If you purchase a Premium Membership via the app store that is subject to automatic extension, the Premium Membership will run for a fixed term, which will automatically extend unless you terminate your subscription with Apple / Google in accordance with Apple's / Google's Terms of Service. Please note that Clauses 5.3 and 12 of these Terms of Service will not apply where you have purchased a Premium Membership via Apple / Google.\n\n2.5. Please also see Clauses 14 and 15 below for those terms that will apply if you have downloaded our app from Apple or Google. Please also note -- if you have downloaded our app from Apple's / Google's app store, Apple's / Google's app store terms of service apply and these will prevail over these Terms of Service if there is any conflict.\n\n3.

Virtual Goods are redeemable only on the Service for digital merchandise and content. Virtual Goods do not expire. Virtual Goods are non-refundable. Virtual Goods have no monetary value and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Virtual Goods are not transferable or assignable. You will not be entitled to a refund, money or any other compensation for unused Virtual Goods when an account is closed due to a serious breach by you of these Terms of Service or where you decide to close your account.\n\n3.4. You may use Virtual Goods to purchase Gifts for other users of our app or other apps, which are visible to you. The price for each Gift will be displayed at the point of purchase. Gifts constitute a limited license to access a certain feature on the Service\n\n3.5. We may also offer certain additional services offered from time to time such as shopping and e-commerce offerings and various informational services.\n\n3.6. We may change the Service: (i) to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; or (ii) to implement minor technical adjustments and improvements, for example to address a security threat (however, these changes will not affect your use of the Service). In addition, although we provide a description of our Service on our website, we may change the main characteristics of our Service from time to time without incurring any additional costs for you. However, if we do this, we will notify you on this within a reasonable period prior to such change taking effect and you may then contact us to terminate end your subscription within 30 days of being informed of such change if the change impairs your ability to access the Services or your usability of the Services and if such impartment is not only insignificant before the changes take effect (and, in case you have subscribed to a in relation to a Premium Membership through us, you will receive a refund from us for the part of the service you have paid for but not received because of the earlier termination of your subscription). Any such notification will inform you on the nature and reasons for such change, the time when the change will take effect, and your right to terminate the subscription within 30 days of such notification in accordance with this Clause 3.6.\n\n4. Use of Data\n\n4.1. You can find further information about how we use or otherwise process your personal information and what our obligations are in relation to data protection in our Privacy Policy.\n\n4.2.

It is your responsibility to follow the user guidelines in Clause 8 below. You may be contacted by our \"Trust and Safety Team\" in the event of anomalies for the purpose of resolving such anomalies. In this case, we will state, in detail, the reasons for contacting you and you are obliged to cooperate with and respond within a reasonable period of such request being made. If we recommend actions, you should seriously consider them. Should you reject a recommended action, you are obligated to inform us within a reasonable period and state the reasons for rejecting our suggested cause of action. You should also report problematic content or behaviour to us through the reporting function.\n\n4.3. We may automatically delete unanswered messages sent by or to profiles that have been identified as spam or romance scamming or have been otherwise deleted.\n\n5. Termination/Extension\n\nPlease refer to Section 11 if you would like to cancel your Premium Membership within the 14-day cancellation/ \"cooling off\" period (your right to cancel).\n\n5.1. You can terminate your Basic Membership at any time with immediate effect in your account settings or by contacting us (support@themeetgroup.com).\n\n5.2. If your Basic Membership has active Virtual Goods you must communicate any termination to us support@themeetgroup.com. Please make sure to provide the email address connected to your account or comparable credentials so to allow us to identify you.\n\n5.3. If, at any point, you wish to discontinue your Premium Membership, you may do so at your convenience. If your Premium Membership account is billed through our website, you must visit http://www.hi5.com/account_info.html , click the Subscriptions and Payments tab, select 'cancel your subscription' and click 'Cancel Premium' at least three days prior to your next scheduled automatic payment so that we can process your cancellation properly. If you fail to do so, you can still cancel by the end of the respective subscription term, however we may collect the money for the following period which we will then refund to you. Your right to terminate your Premium Membership based on other grounds remains unaffected. In this case, you must state the grounds for extraordinary termination when cancelling your subscription based on this ground. If your Premium Membership account is billed through Apple, you must cancel at least 24 hours prior to your next scheduled automatic payment, by following the process outlined here. If your Premium Membership account is billed through GooglePlay, you must cancel within seven days from the start of your billing cycle, by following the process outlined here. You may also write to us using the contact details provided below in Clause 16. Subject to Clause 5.5 and Clause 11 below, any termination of your subscription will not take effect until the end of the current billing period (and, as such, you will not be entitled to any refund). Thus, in order to make sure that your Premium Membership does not automatically extend, you must tell us that you want to terminate your subscription before the end of your then-current subscription term.\n\n5.4. If you delete your Basic or Premium Membership, any previously purchased Virtual Goods will also be deleted, and existing payment obligations from purchases of paid-for services or features (like Virtual Goods) will remain in place, subject to applicable cancellation rights (see Clause 12).\n\n5.5. To authenticate your identity and your termination request, you must include the email address connected to your account or other personal details so to allow us to identify you.\n\n5.6. If you choose to purchase a Premium Membership, your membership will automatically renew on a monthly basis, unless you cancel your subscription in accordance with this section.\n\n5.7. If you terminate your Premium Membership, your account will revert to a Basic Membership. If you want to terminate your Basic Membership, please follow the procedure set out in Clause 5.1.\n\n5.8. Subject to Clause 5.4 and in accordance with Clause 3.6, if you want to terminate your Premium Membership because we have told you about an upcoming substantial change to our Service, your subscription will end immediately after we receive your termination notice in text form (for example email or fax) and we will refund you for any portion of the Premium Membership that we have not provided. If you have purchased your Premium Membership through Apple / Google, any cancellation and refund will be made in accordance with Apple's / Google's own terms as further described in Clauses 2.4 and 5.3.\n\n6. Functionality, Compatibility, Interoperability, Warranties, and Liability\n\n6.1. Please be aware that although we use our best efforts , we cannot guarantee that the Service will be available 100% of the time.

It is your responsibility to install such updates within a reasonable time. If you fail to do so, although we have informed you that an update is available and the consequences of not installing it, we will not be liable for any product defects resulting from your failure to install the update; this shall not apply if the fact that you have not installed the update or have installed it incorrectly is not due to inadequate installation instructions provided by us to you.\n\n6.6.

We shall be liable for damages arising out of the use of the Services within the scope of statutory provisions, irrespective of the legal grounds, only in accordance with the following provisions:\n\na) We shall be liable without limitation for damages resulting from death or personal injury, as well as for damages caused by our wilful intent or gross negligence, our legal representatives or vicarious agents, as well as for damages caused by non-compliance with a guarantee given by us or by fraudulently concealed defects.\n\nb) For all other damages due to a breach of essential contractual obligations resulting from simple negligence by us, our legal representatives or vicarious agents, our liability shall be based on the merits of the case. Essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) are those whose fulfilment enables the proper implementation of the contract in the first place and on whose fulfilment the contractual partner may ordinarily rely. In such cases, we shall be liable for an amount of compensation as would be typical for foreseeable damages in such a contract. Liability is otherwise excluded.\n\nc) Liability under the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected by the above provisions.\n\n6.11. You are required to take appropriate measures to prevent and mitigate damage, in particular to ensure, where technically possible, appropriate security of your data on your devices.

Por regla general, una compra a través de una tienda de aplicaciones tendrá lugar cuando hagas clic en \"Comprar ahora\" (o un botón similar) y, cuando sea necesario, introduzcas tu contraseña o credenciales equivalentes (por ejemplo, Touch ID o Face ID) para la tienda de aplicaciones. Tu relación contractual con Apple/Google quedará confirmada en la fecha en que Apple/Google te envíe un correo electrónico de confirmación de tu pedido; y Apple/Google te facturará cualquier cargo de Membresía Premium a través de tu cuenta de Apple/Google.
