        "text": "A bag drop is provided at the half marathon start lines. Please use the bag you receive at packet pickup to put any items that you have at the start and won’t be running with. Using the zip tie provided in your bag, attach the tear-off tag on your bib to the bag. Bags will be transported down to the finish line, 15 minutes before the start of the race. You can retrieve it after you finish.\n\nRuntastic is not liable for the loss or damage of any belongings that are put in the Drop Bag, left along a course or at an Aid Station. There is inherent risk to using the Drop Bag service so please only put items in the bag or leave items at an Aid Station that do not have personal, essential or great value.\n\nIf you lose an item at the race, please visit the Blue Runtastic Information Tent during the event to see if it has been turned in.\n\nSTART: Bags dropped at the start line in the bag trailer/vehicle will be taken to the Finish Bag Pick-Up Corral.\n\nCOURSE: Bags and clothing left along the course will be picked up by the clean-up crew and thrown away or donated.\n\nAID STATION: Bags and clothing left at an Aid Station Clothing Drop will be taken to the Finish Bag Pick-Up Corral but may not arrive until near the end of the event.\n\nAs a courtesy service, all Clothing and Bags that are not picked up at the Finish Bag Pick-up Corral will be taken to Runtastic’s main office at 50 North Center St. American Fork, UT 84003.\n\nClothing and bags can be picked up from that location Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. for the two consecutive weeks following the event. Participants are welcome to come look through the clothing during those times. Runtastic hopes that participants can recover any lost items but does not have the resources to look for items lost."
