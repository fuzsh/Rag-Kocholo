        "text": "There's a reason this is one of the biggest trail running events in the country! Moab in November is a trail runner's dream...perfect weather and world class single track make this event one you don't want to miss. Featuring the Magnificent Seven trail system, the course will challenge you with technical slickrock and rocky climbs. Runners make their way up the Gemini Bridges Trail to the first aid station with views from Court Point and into the beautiful Bride Canyon. After the 15 mile aid station, runners are treated to the extraordinary views from Bull Run Trail. Every crest and turn gives stunning views of Arches National Park, the La Sal Mountains, and the Moab Valley. Come see why this race sells out year after year!\n\n​\n\nDead Horse Ultra is part of our Run Moab Series. Check out all of our Moab races!\n\nGPS Coordinates (Click for Google Map)\n\n38.65610703685277, -109.67716714972123\n\n​\n\nFrom Center St. and Main St (Highway 191), head north out of town, approximately 10 miles. Make a left into Gemini Bridges parking lot. The parking lot is one way, counter clockwise, traffic. There is a special drop off zone notated on the map. The drop off zone does not allow for cars to park. Be ready to exit vehicle immediately.\n\nOversized vehicle and camper parking is located across the street, at the Bar M parking lot. You must use the lot at the trailhead. Lots closer to the highway are private property. There is a short walk over to the start/finish line. **Do not cross highway, instead use pedestrian path under the highway. Consider carpooling!**\n\nThere will be parking attendants pointing out parking spots. Treat parking attendants with respect. They have the final say in your parking location. Runners will be held responsible for crew/spectators. Yelling and being aggressive with parking attendants will result in asking you to leave the private property permanently. If you park in an unacceptable location, you risk being ticketed. Do not park on highway. Do not drop off on highway. If you do so, you will be denied entry onto private property where event is hosted. This will ensure we can continue to host this event. Parking rules are a part of our safety plan.\n\nSaturday, November 16, 2024\n\n5:15 a.m. - 8:15 a.m.\n\nCheck-in, packet pickup at the starting line.\n\n6:00 a.m. – 50 mile start (6:00, 6:05, and 6:10)\n\n7:00 a.m. - 50k start (7:00, 7:05, 7:10)\n\n8:00 a.m. - 30k start (8:00, 8:05, 8:10)\n\n8:30 a.m. - 15K (8:30, 8:35, 8:40)\n\n10 minutes before each race start - pre-race announcement\n\nRunners will choose their own wave, based on where they anticipate finishing. This is done to limit passing along the course and spread runners out for aid station volunteers. Please choose the wave where you will feel the most comfortable and have the most fun! Waves will start 5 min apart.\n\nWave 1- Top 33%\n\nWave 2- Middle 33%\n\nWave 3- Bottom 33%\n\n​\n\nRUNNERS MUST ATTACH CHIP TO SHOE. NO CHIP ON SHOE = NO TIME"
