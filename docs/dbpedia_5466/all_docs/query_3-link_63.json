Click here for answers to frequently asked questions related to this application.\n\nThe “Standard Application” MAY NOT BE USED to register a “collection” of unpublished works. If you submit 2 or more works on the “Standard Application” the Copyright Office may register only 1 of your works and remove the remaining works from the claim. To register those works you will need to resubmit them using an appropriate application form.\n\nThe Copyright Office has implemented a new group registration option for musical works that are published on the same album. Read more.\n\nIn addition, the Office has implemented a separate group registration option for sound recordings, photos, artwork, and liner notes that are published on the same album. Read more."
