Drag files and folders to the right side of (or below) the other line that separates recently used apps. An alias for the item is placed in the Dock.\n\nWhen you drag a folder to the Dock, you can view it as a stack. By default, the Dock comes with a Downloads folder. See Use folders in the Dock.\n\nRemove an item from the Dock: Drag the item out of the Dock until Remove is shown. Only the alias is removed; the actual item remains on your Mac.\n\nIf you accidentally remove an app icon from the Dock, it’s easy to put it back (the app is still on your Mac). Open the app to make its icon appear again in the Dock. Control-click the app’s icon, then choose Options > Keep in Dock.\n\nBelow Dock on the right, change the options you want.\n\nFor example, you can change how items appear in the Dock, adjust its size, locate it along the left or right edge of the screen, or even hide it.\n\nTo learn about the options, click the Help button at the bottom of the window."
