The monitor-rotation feature is controlled by the graphics card of a computer. If that feature is turned on for your computer, it will take priority over the Ruler shortcut key, and the result will be that your monitor display will be rotated 90 degrees when you press Alt+Ctrl+right or left arrow key. You can reset your monitor rotation by pressing Alt+Ctrl+up arrow.\n\nIf you want to use the Ruler manipulation key combination, turn off the monitor-rotation feature by right-clicking your computer desktop and choosing a command such as Graphics Properties or Graphics Options. Find a Hot Keys command, and set it to Disabled. (The exact arrangement and names of these commands vary by manufacturer.) After you've turned off the monitor-rotation feature, the Alt+Ctr+arrow key combinations can be used on both the Ruler and on shapes that have been inserted on a slides in PowerPoint.\n\nTo draw a line Tap a pen or highlighter on the Draw tab, and begin drawing.\n\nTo align individual items Select each one in turn and drag the object until its selection handle snaps to the ruler.\n\nTo align a group of items at once Multi-select the items by selecting one and then tapping and holding it while you successively tap other items with another finger.
