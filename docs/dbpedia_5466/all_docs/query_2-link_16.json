        "text": "For the Public\n\nIssuance of REAL ID Compliant Documents to Citizens of the Freely Associated States\n\nOn December 17, 2018, President Trump signed the REAL ID Act Modification for Freely Associated States Act, Public Law 115-323. This Act amends the REAL ID Act of 2005 to authorize states to issue full-term REAL ID compliant driver’s licenses and identification cards to citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (collectively known as the Freely Associated States, or FAS) who have been admitted to the United States as nonimmigrants pursuant to a Compact of Free Association and who meet the identification requirements of the REAL ID Act.\n\nState Compliance\n\nState Implementation\n\nThe SAVE response will indicate Parolee and the date that the applicant was paroled into the United States. In addition, the SAVE response will generally include an “OAR” (Operation Allies Refuge) class of admission (COA) if the individual is an Afghan parolee. For limited situations in which an Afghan parolee has another parole COA such as “PAR” or “DT”, the procedures for receiving Afghanistan as the Country of Citizenship through initial verification depend upon whether the agency is using the web services access (system-to-system) or web browser access method:\n\nWeb Services – SAVE may provide Afghanistan in the Country of Citizenship field (NonCitCountryCitCd) as part of the initial verification response.\n\nWeb Browser – SAVE may provide Afghanistan in a new Country of Citizenship field as part of the initial verification response screen.\n\nThe procedure for obtaining Afghanistan as the Country of Citizenship through additional verification is the same for both access methods. Specifically, user agencies should include a “Request verification of Afghan citizenship” note in the comments field for the additional verification request. SAVE will then respond with “Citizen of Afghanistan” in the DHS Comments to Agency field.\n\nIn addition to the plastic I-551 Permanent Resident Card, the following documents qualify as a valid, unexpired Form I-551:\n\nA foreign passport with an unexpired temporary I-551 stamp, or with a temporary I-551 printed notation on a machine-readable immigrant visa (MRIV) with a DHS admission stamp, within the stated validity period, which is normally one year from the date of the DHS stamp;\n\nA DHS Form I-94 or Form I-94A with a photograph and an unexpired temporary I-551 stamp; or\n\nA U.S. Department of State Form DS-232, Unrecognized Passport or Waiver Cases, with a temporary I-551 printed notation on a machine-readable immigrant visa (MRIV) with a DHS admission stamp and validity period, which is normally one year from the date of the DHS stamp.\n\nIn all cases, the documentation presented for proof of identity and lawful status must be verified through Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE).\n\nYes. States should accept DHS-issued EADs that have had the validity period automatically extended by DHS because they are unexpired. These include EADs that bear a “Card Expires” date that has passed, or one that has a future expiration date on its face. To determine whether an EAD validity period is extended, states should follow the scenario-based guidance below and then use SAVE to verify the extended EAD validity period.\n\nDocumentation\n\nApplicant presents an EAD and an individual notice that includes language referring to an extension of the validity period of the EAD.\n\nIf the individual notice is a Notice of Action (Form I-797 or Form I-797C) and\n\nThe EAD bears a category listed in Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension, then follow the guidance on that webpage and verify it by using SAVE.\n\nThe EAD bears a category not listed in Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension, then the EAD may still be automatically extended. As with all EAD extensions, verify it by using SAVE.\n\nApplicant presents EAD and a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Category (A12 or C19) but no extension notice.\n\nIn this situation, visit the country-specific TPS webpage available through the applicable country link on left side of the Temporary Protected Status webpage.\n\nUse the information on the country-specific TPS webpage to determine whether there is a blanket automatic extension of expiring EADs for TPS beneficiaries of that country.\n\nSAVE Verification\n\nVerify all EAD extensions using SAVE. SAVE will generally include any status and/or EAD extension as part of its initial verification response. In situations where SAVE does not, please submit an additional verification request. If a previous SAVE case verified an applicant’s status and/or employment authorization, please submit a new verification request to determine whether there has been an extension or change."
