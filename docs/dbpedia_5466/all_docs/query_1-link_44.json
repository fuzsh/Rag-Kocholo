We invite you to celebrate all the things that make the running community the vibrant, diverse network of athletes that it is. This unique competition levels the playing field, valuing every distance, every runner, and even every volunteer.\n\nWe’re excited to bring a little friendly competition to this year’s newly reimagined Greater St. Louis Marathon! Read all about how your team can earn points for your club towards becoming the CHAMPIONS of the inaugural Greater St. Louis Running Club Championships!\n\nCategories\n\nUnder 10 participants\n\n11- 25 participants\n\nOver 25 participants\n\nSpecial Awards for 2024\n\nTeam who traveled the farthest\n\nFarthest combined distance run\n\nTeam Spirit (best uniforms/best campsite decor/etc – totally subjective on this one!!)\n\nHow do you earn points for your team?\n\nRace registration: The distance you register for is the first way you earn points for your team. Marathoners will earn the most points down to the 5K with the least.\n\nRace results: Using an age-graded system, your finish time will earn you additional points for your team. Everyone will receive points with a finish time, but additional points will be earned for those with faster age-graded times.\n\nVolunteering: Have some non-runners, or runners who are training for a different race, on your team? Volunteer hours will earn points towards your team total. (FYI, runners who are participating in the race can also earn volunteer points in shifts at the Expo or other pre-race volunteer needs!)\n\nOn-Course Cheer Station: The ultimate point-earning opportunity! If your team has enough people who aren’t running (or are family members of runners!) and you set up an official cheer station on-course, your team will receive a healthy amount of points for doing this awesome act of running community fellowship! (Please note: cheer stations must be “official” and registered with the event to be eligible for points.)\n\nWinners will be announced LIVE at the after-party, and can expect to earn bragging rights, some great prizes from our partners, and the satisfaction of running and competing with some really awesome teammates!\n\n2024 Club Commons Map & Running Club Campsite Locator\n\nDownload a PDF\n\nTeam “Campsite” Details:\n\nEach space is roughly 40×50 rectangle, with some variation\n\nSpaces are built with perimeter fencing and interior bike rack.\n\nSpots will be assigned on a first-come, first served basis.\n\nRules + Regulations:\n\nOvernight security will be provided for teams to leave tents, chairs, etc. DO NOT leave valuables or individual possessions overnight.\n\nTeams may leave their own gear + items during the day, but are required to staff their own space. GO! St. Louis is not responsible for the care of each team’s possessions left in their space.\n\n10×10 tents are permitted. Anything over 10×10 must be approved by GO! St. Louis.\n\nNo fires, propane, or other flammable equipment is permitted.\n\nAny animals brought into the space must be on leashes at all times.\n\nNo weapons of any type may be brought into the area.\n\nNo generators are allowed, and electricity will not be provided in the area.\n\nSet Up Camp at the WashU Runner Club Commons\n\nTailgating, runner-style! Set up camp (all but the overnight part, that is!) in our Club Commons and enjoy your own team’s designated area to hang out and relax before, during (for the non runners) and after the races. Our hosts at Wash U have activities and runner services planned in the common area and you’ll have front row seats for the post-race party.\n\n#RallyTheLou Challenge\n\nRace day just got a whole lot more fun! Complete the #RallyTheLou Challenge by running one of our morning race distances: 10K, Half Marathon or Full Marathon and then complete our afternoon 5K! In addition to the bragging rights of running two races in one day, you will receive some great swag too!\n\n#RallyTheLou Challenge participants who complete the challenge will receive:\n\n5K medal and event shirt\n\n10K, half or full marathon medal and event shirt\n\nA commemorative #RallyTheLou Challenge medal\n\nPremium #RallyTheLou Challenge sweatshirt\n\nRegister at the Expo\n\n#RallyTheLou Challenge FAQ\n\nI’ve already registered for one of the races, but I want to do the challenge. What do I do?\n\nNo problem, send an email info@gostlouis.org to upgrade your current registration to the challenge.\n\nDo I have to complete all events to get the swag?\n\nAs with any race, you must complete each event to get its medal, and you must complete all events in your challenge to receive both the commemorative challenge medal and sweatshirt.\n\nIf I’ve registered for each event separately, am I registered for the challenge automatically?\n\nNo. If you are interested in registering for the challenge, but have registered for each event separately, please email info@gostlouis.org the office and we can walk you through the process of registering for the challenge.\n\nRace Weekend\n\nPresented By:\n\nAbout the Expo\n\nThe Greater St. Louis Marathon Expo & Packet Pickup, presented by Terrain Magazine, will be the official packet pickup location for registered runners this year. With 50 booths expected at the two-day event, the Expo & Packet Pickup invites runners, their friends and families to stop by to check out health, fitness and running exhibits from local and national vendors.\n\nPacket Pickup\n\nTo receive your packet for race day, you MUST pick up your packet at the Expo & Packet Pickup. Admission to the Expo & Packet Pickup is FREE and OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.\n\nVendor Information\n\nInterested in becoming a vendor at the Greater St. Louis Expo?

If a participant is not able to attend the Expo and pick up their own bag, they can complete a Packet Pickup Authorization Form, which allows someone to complete the process. No race bags will be released to an individual who does not have the proper form. A limit of ONE additional bag per person is enforced.\n\nExpo & Packet Pickup Location\n\nSt. Louis Union Station – Midway East\\\n\n1820 Market Street\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63103\n\nExpo Hours\n\nThursday, April 25: 3pm – 7pm\n\nFriday, April 26: 11am – 8pm\n\nThursday, April 25\n\n3:00pm – 7:00pm\n\nGreater St. Louis Marathon Expo & Runner Packet Pick Up\n\nFriday, April 26\n\n11:00am – 8:00pm\n\nGreater St. Louis Marathon Expo & Runner Packet Pick Up\n\nSaturday, April 27\n\nRACE DAY!!\n\n5:00am\n\nWashU Runner Club Commons opens\n\nThe tailgate continues for the big day!

REGISTER HERE\n\nWhat is the cost of the race?\n\nEntry fees vary depending on the race and the time of year you plan to register. Once registration opens, it will continue until a race sells out or closes.\n\nWhat is the age limit for each distance?\n\nMarathon – 18 years of age on race day\n\nHalf Marathon and Marathon Relay – 14 years of age on race day\n\n10K – 12 years of age on race day\n\n5K – 6 years of age on race day\n\nWhat does my registration fee go towards?\n\nFunds generated from participant registration fees go toward costs associated with event shirts, finisher medals, and a variety of operational costs such as: official permits, medical supplies, security, race bibs, barricades, hydration equipment, staffing and timing services. In addition, as a local non-profit organization a portion of your entry fee helps support GO! St. Louis youth initiatives, aimed at keeping kids active.\n\nCan I get a refund if I cannot participate?\n\nUnfortunately, we do not offer refunds for any of the events. Costs associated with the pre-planning and ordering of participant amenities well in advance of the race prohibit us from offering refunds. In addition, refunds are not issued if the event is cancelled due to severe weather, disaster or emergency occurrences that may affect the safety and health of the participants. Please take a moment to read the full waiver that is available at the time of registration.\n\nCan I transfer my registration to another person if I cannot participate?\n\nNo, transfers are not permitted under any circumstances. While this practice may seem harmless, it can result in serious consequences to both parties involved. It’s an issue of false identity and a liability issue. Why? The most important reason is that your race bib is attached to your identity, so if an emergency occurs that requires medical attention or a race official must identify a participant, we need to have accurate information. In addition, finisher awards may be impacted. If race organizers identify an individual who has given their race bib to another person, it will result in disqualification and a minimum two-year ban for both individuals for any GO! St. Louis race.\n\nCan I defer my entry to another date?\n\nHalf and Full Marathon Participants Only\n\nYes. If for a medical reason you are unable to participate in the Half Marathon or Marathon on April 27 2024, you have the option of deferring your entry to either the 2024 Great GO! St. Louis Halloween Half Marathon or the Half or Full Marathon during the 2025 Marathon & Family Fitness Weekend with a note from a medical professional. This deferral is valid for 50% of the entry fee. The deferral is neither transferable to another person or another race and is non refundable. The deferral is only valid for one calendar year.\n\nTo defer you must email the GO! St. Louis office (info@gostlouis.org) by April 23, 2024. No deferrals will be processed after this date for any reason.\n\nCan I participate if I do not have my race bib on race morning or decide to join the race without officially completing the registration process?\n\nNo, this is not allowed. This is frequently termed “race bandit” by race organizers and will be strictly enforced. Course monitors are trained to spot participants who are not displaying a race bib, and they will be escorted from the race course by officials and banned from future GO! St. Louis events.\n\nWhat is packet pickup?\n\nAll registered participants receive a race bag (a.k.a. packet or goody bag) that includes their official race number, race information, and promotional product samples. Your race bag must be picked at the Greater St. Louis Marathon Expo & Runner Packet Pickup. There is NO race day packet pickup for the marathon, half marathon, 10K, or relay on Saturday, April 27. Packet Pickup will be held at:\n\nLocation:\n\nSt. Louis Union Station – Midway East\n\n1820 Market Street\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63103\n\nExpo Hours:\n\nThursday, April 25 – 3:00pm – 7:00pm\n\nFriday, April 26 – 11:00am – 8:00pm\n\nWhat do I need to bring to pick up my race bag?\n\nAs a registered participant you will receive a final race confirmation sent via email a few days prior to race day. Please bring a copy of this confirmation and a photo ID to the Expo to receive your race bag.\n\nI arrived at the Expo late and did not get my requested shirt size?\n\nOn a very limited basis, you may be faced with the situation where you go to pick up your packet and the shirt size you requested during the registration process is not available. With any race which requires large amounts of event shirts (10,000+), the order must be placed 4-6 months in advance of the event, so a certain amount of estimation of sizes takes place. Even with over-ordering it is not an exact science. Although if this happens, it generally affects a small number of participants. To ensure you receive your requested size shirt, we encourage you to visit the Expo as early as possible.\n\nCan I pick up another participant’s race bag?\n\nAlthough we stress that it is very important that every registered participant pick up their own bag, we do realize that in some cases it is not feasible. If a participant is not able to attend the Expo and pick up their own bag, they can complete a Packet Pickup Authorization Form, which allows someone to complete the process. No race bags will be released to an individual who does not have the proper form. A limit of ONE additional bag per person is enforced.\n\nDo all four members of my relay team need to pick up their race bags individually?\n\nNo, we require only the relay team captain or a designated team member to pick up all four team member’s bags. We do not release individual packets to team members. We do encourage all members of a relay team to visit the Expo and enjoy the experience as a team, if possible.\n\nWhat if I didn’t get my email confirmation or want to confirm my race entry?\n\nIf you did not get your confirmation email and would like to confirm that you are registered for the race, please email info@gostlouis.org.\n\nCan I transfer to another distance before race day?\n\nYes, you can transfer to any other distance offered during race weekend. Keep in mind if you are transferring to a race that has a higher entry fee cost, you will be responsible for the additional cost. For example if you registered for the 5K and now want to participate in the half marathon, you would incur additional entry fee costs. No partial refunds are provided if you transfer to a race with a lower entry fee. In addition, a transfer can only be made if space is still available in the race. Please follow these instructions to switch your race distance:\n\nCreate a RunSignup account if you don’t already have one by going to www.runsignup.com.\n\nClick on the person outline in the top right hand corner of the screen.\n\nClick on Create an Account or Sign In (if you already have an account):\n\nThen, click on PROFILE – this will take you to the page where your race is listed.\n\nClick on Manage Registration.\n\nClick on Transfer Event.\n\nClick on Start Transfer and choose the event you wish to transfer to and continue through registration until complete. You will be charged the difference between the event you registered for and the new event.\n\nIf you have any issues during the transfer process, please email us at info@gostlouis.org.\n\nAll distance changes can be completed online before April 23. After April 23, all event changes must be done at the Gateway Outdoor Expo Event Change booth.\n\nDo you offer a military entry fee discount?\n\nWe do offer a 15% entry fee discount for all active duty, veterans, guard members and reserve members, however this does not include family members or military spouses. To receive the military discount code, please email us at info@gostlouis.org. Participants utilizing the military discount will be required to provide a military ID or papers during the packet pickup process. This discount is only valid on new registrations and cannot be applied to a previous registration.\n\nWhat happens if extreme weather occurs during the event?\n\nIf extreme weather or an emergency situation becomes an issue during the Event, the GO! St. Louis President and Race Director and Medical Director will meet and determine the status/future of the Event. Depending on the situation, the Event may be delayed, ended early, or canceled. Information will be relayed to the race committee. Participants will be notified by course monitors and race officials.\n\nWe will also provide updates about Event delay(s) or cancelation(s) as quickly as possible through our website, social media and local media.\n\nPlease see our Race Day Protocol for Weather HERE\n\nWhat is a corral/wave start?\n\nWe assign participants a corral (A, B, C, D, E, etc.) based on their predicted finish time. On race day we have large corral signs that correspond with the letter on your race bib, this is where you line up for the race. To ease congestion at the start we release the corrals in waves, which are generally a minute or two apart.\n\nCan I change corrals to run with a friend if we are assigned different corrals?\n\nYes, you may elect to start in a lower corral with your friend, but you cannot go to a higher corral. For example if you are in corral B, you may go back to C or D, but cannot go to the A corral.\n\nDo you have any course time limit rules?\n\nThe marathon course route re-opens to traffic at a rolling schedule according to a 6.5-hour marathon pace or (approximately 15:00 minutes per mile). Marathoners and Half Marathoners must maintain a 15:00 minute per mile pace throughout the race. The time limit rules will be strictly enforced. There will be a pace leader leading a 6 hour 30 minute marathon pace or 3 hour 15 minute half marathon pace (15:00 minutes per mile). The time limit will begin when the 6:30 marathon pace group crosses the start line after the start of the race. Anyone who falls behind the last pacer, leading 15:00 min/mile must get into the sag vehicle and be transported to the finish, or move to the sidewalk and obey all traffic signals.\n\nAny Marathon or Marathon Relay participant who falls behind the pace (behind the 6:30 pace group) prior to the Half Marathon turn to the finish will be required to finish with the Half Marathon. Any marathoner, who turns at the half marathon split and completes the half marathon, will receive finish line amenities (food, water, medical assistance if needed). After the half marathon turn to the finish, course support (police, course monitors, and water stations) will not be available to marathoners or marathon relay teams who fall behind the 15:00 minute per mile pace. Anyone who falls behind the pace must get in the sag vehicle and will be transported to the finish line, or move to the sidewalk and obey all traffic signals. Marathoners who only complete the Half Marathon will not be eligible for overall or age group awards.\n\nHow do you capture my finish time?\n\nYour official race bib has a timing strip on the back, so do not remove this strip. Once you cross the start line your timing strip activates, and will not stop until you cross the finish line. In addition, we will have various timing mats on the course to capture your progress along the way. Athletes vying for prize money will be judged on gun time, while age group awards will be issued based upon tag (chip) time.\n\nDo you allow participants to walk in the races?\n\nAbsolutely, we love walkers, but we ask that you agree to the time limit rules (15:00 per mile pace).\n\nDo you allow participants to use headphones, phones, iPods, etc.?\n\nAlthough we do not restrict such devices, we strongly discourage the use for safety reasons. If you make a decision to wear a music-playing device during the race, please keep one headphone out of your ear so that you can hear any on-course instruction from race officials.\n\nI love to run with my dog, may I bring him or her to run with me?\n\nNo. We love our pets too, but for safety reasons pets are not allowed on the course at any time. Participants that compete with a pet will immediately be escorted off the course and disqualified.\n\nCan I bike, rollerblade, roller skate, skateboard, etc. on the course?\n\nNo, we do not allow any “wheels” on the race course for safety reasons, other than approved wheelchair participants, emergency personnel or race officials . The use of “wheels” will result in a disqualification.\n\nCan I participate in a wheelchair?\n\nYes, we do permit competitive wheelchairs in the marathon and half marathon race only. All wheelchair participants must register as such and wear a helmet at all times. We do not allow hand-crank chairs to participate in any race. Wheelchair participants start the race a few minutes prior to the elite division start. Please email info@gostlouis.org if you are interested in participating as a wheelchair participant.\n\nI’m a disabled athlete, can I participate?\n\nYes, we will make every effort to provide a safe race experience for athletes of all abilities. If you are a disabled athlete and would like to compete, please send us an email at info@gostlouis.org, to ensure we can accommodate any special requirements.\n\nCan I run or walk with a baby jogger or stroller?\n\nNo, we do not allow baby joggers or strollers in the marathon, half marathon, or marathon relay race for safety reasons. Participants will be escorted off the course and disqualified. We do, however, allow baby joggers or strollers in the 5K or 10K race. Participants are asked to start at the back of the start line area.\n\nDo you offer Gear Check?\n\nYes, Gear Check is offered for the Marathon, Full Marathon, Marathon Relay, and 10K ONLY beginning at 5:30 AM on race day. Participants MUST re-use the “Clear” plastic bag they received at the Expo. Simply tear off the Gear Check tag from your race bib and affix it with the small zip tie (these are provided at the gear check tent). Your official race bib number is also your gear check number. We discourage you from placing valuables in the gear check bags. For security reasons we will not accept backpacks, luggage or any large bags. All personal items must be placed in a clear bag, where contents are visible. No exceptions.\n\nVolunteer Opportunities\n\nGet involved!\n\nIf you are looking for a fun and rewarding experience, consider joining the more than 3,000 volunteers who help make GO! events and programs a success every year.\n\nVolunteer\n\nSupport GO!
