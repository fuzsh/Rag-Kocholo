        "text": "In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Program\n\nThe In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home assistance to eligible aged, blind, and disabled individuals as an alternative to out-of-home care and enables recipients to remain safely in their own homes.\n\nWho is it For:\n\nEligibility criteria for all IHSS applicants and recipients:\n\nYou must also be a California resident.\n\nYou must have a Medi-Cal eligibility determination.\n\nYou must live at home or an abode of your own choosing (acute care hospital, long-term care facilities, and licensed community care facilities are not considered \"own home\").\n\nYou must submit a completed Health Care Certification form.\n\nHow the program works:\n\nA county social worker will interview you at your home to determine your eligibility and need for IHSS. Based on your ability to safely perform certain tasks for yourself, the social worker will assess the types of services you need and the number of hours the county will authorize for each of these services. This assessment will include information given by you and, if appropriate, by your family, friends, physician, or other licensed health care professional.\n\nA completed Health Care Certification (SOC 873) must be received by the county prior to authorization of services.\n\nYou will be notified if IHSS has been approved or denied. If denied, you will be notified of the reason for the denial. If approved, you will be notified of the services and the number of hours per month which have been authorized for you.\n\nIf you are approved for IHSS, you must hire someone (your individual provider) to perform the authorized services. You are considered your provider's employer and, therefore, it is your responsibility to hire, train, supervise, and fire this individual.\n\nIf your county has contracted IHSS providers, you may choose to have services provided by the contractor.\n\nIf your county has homemaker employees, you may receive services from a county homemaker.\n\nHow are IHSS payments made?\n\nYou may contact the social worker assigned to your case to determine the IHSS hourly rate in your county. Because unions negotiate with the employer of record in each county, the wage rates may vary from county to county. The State issues all checks for individual provider payments. If the provider qualifies, the State withholds the applicable amounts for disability insurance and Social Security taxes.\n\nNeeds Assessments\n\nIHSS assessments are completed during home visits at the initial intake assessment and annual reassessments. Recipients may request for a reassessment of need at any time if their needs or circumstances change. County social workers continuously monitor recipients’ cases and have frequent contact with recipients to ensure their needs are appropriately met through program services. IHSS social workers complete a needs assessment for each applicant or recipient using the following criteria: the Functional Index Rankings, the Annotated Assessment Criteria, and the Hourly Task Guidelines (HTGs).\n\nService Authorizations\n\nService authorizations are assessed during the needs assessment, which is a comprehensive review of the recipient’s medical history/diagnosis, medications/purpose, emergency contacts, physicians’ information, household composition, functional index rankings, mini-mental health assessment, necessary referrals to Adult Protective Services (APS), Child Protective Services (CPS), Fraud, community services, etc., language preferences and whether an interpreter is needed, and a full biopsychosocial assessment. The social worker needs to document all service needs and justify service authorizations in the case narrative.\n\nHow to Apply:\n\nTo apply for IHSS, complete an application and submit it to your county IHSS Office.\n\nSOC 295 - Application For Social Services\n\nTranslations:"
