Over the years, this holiday tradition has evolved from its modest and humble beginnings to a spectacular, joyous sight to see ‚Äì in daytime or nighttime.\n\nToday, as the train pulls into each station, Santa waves to riders from his sleigh on an open-air flatcar carrying his reindeer and decorated holiday trees.\n\nEach car of the train is wrapped with holiday and seasonal images. Thousands of twinkling lights outline the shape of the train and windows, with even more lights running across the tops of the cars.\n\nCharity food delivery\n\nThe CTA family continues its decades-long tradition of supporting Chicago communities. Each year, our employees donate their time and money to purchase groceries and assemble food baskets for delivery to community organizations across the city. This year, we'll donate approximately 600 food baskets to local community organizations.\n\nEach food basket contains all the ingredients for a complete meal including a canned ham, potatoes, mixed vegetables, muffin mix, macaroni and cheese, fruit cocktail, green beans, corn and dessert.\n\nPhotos with Santa are back!\n\nMake sure your camera and/or mobile devices are charged and ready, as photos with Santa are back! For the first time since 2019, riders and fans of the Allstate CTA Holiday Fleet will be able to partake in photo sessions with Santa on designated dates for both the festive bus and train (see schedules for more details).\n\nPhotos with Santa will be taken by a CTA employee using your device. Please have devices ready for use when it‚Äôs your turn with Santa. Photos are on a first-come, first-served basis, limit one photo set-up per family/group. Photo props will be available.\n\nNOTE: Every effort is made to accommodate those lined-up for photos; however, there is a firm-cut-off time to ensure the Allstate CTA Holiday Bus/Train depart and remain on schedule. See on-site staff for more information.\n\nTrain schedule\n\nThe Allstate CTA Holiday Train will travel all rail lines beginning in late November through late December as part of regular rail service, making stops at all stations along the respective routes. Schedules for each rail line will vary. Normal CTA fares apply.\n\nüì∑ = Photos with Santa days\n\nAllstate CTA Holiday Bus\n\nDay or night, the commutes of thousands and the streets of Chicago‚Äôs neighborhoods are made merry with the Allstate CTA Holiday Bus. A part of our holiday tradition since 2014, this 60-foot bus has been transformed by CTA employees into a winter wonderland to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to customers and bring added cheer during the holiday season.\n\nYou‚Äôll know this bus is near when you hear holiday music playing and a jolly ‚ÄúHo-ho-ho!‚Äù from down the street. Look up and you‚Äôll see Santa waving and greeting all the good boys and girls of Chicago from the roof hatch of the bus.\n\nThe exterior of the bus features Santa and reindeer on a roof, getting ready to deliver gifts to good boys and girls.\n\nBus Schedule\n\nThe bus will travel multiple CTA bus routes throughout the city between late November and late December, as part of regular service. Normal CTA fares apply.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use the holiday bus tracker to track the whereabouts of Ralphie and Santa along the scheduled route. This information will only be available while the bus is in service on the dates and times listed below.\n\nTravel tips\n\nBoth the train and bus are in-service vehicles that operate as part of regular service; therefore, they cannot dwell at stations/stops for long periods of time. While every effort is made to accommodate riders, space is limited and boarding is not guaranteed.\n\nTo ensure everyone has an opportunity to see and take part in this annual tradition, here are a few suggested tips to make the most of your experience:"
