We will allow individuals to pick up someone else's bag, but will require a digital or hardcopy of the person's ID and a written note authorizing them to do so.\n\nIf you will be arriving in town after the expo is closed or are otherwise unable to attend the expo, you may elect to pick up your packet and bag on race morning for an additional fee. This option may be selected during registration. There is an option to have your entire race packet mailed to you. You may select this option during registration.\n\nParking & Busing\n\nParticipant parking is not available at the finish venue. All designated parking is a short shuttle ride from the finish line (approximately 15 minutes). The address for both marathon and half marathon parking is 650 E Hospitality Ln. San Bernardino, CA 92408. Please utilize the Parking & Busing map to ensure easy access to parking and bus loading race morning.\n\nREVEL Big Bear is a point to point route and as such, we will bus you from the designated parking area to the start line. Marathon and half marathon participants will board buses in two separate locations within in the parking area. All participants must take the bus and your bib is the ticket to board the bus. There is no parking at the start lines, and participants may not be dropped off at the start venues.\n\nMarathon buses will load from the NE corner of the lot on E Carnegie Dr and will depart from 3:15-3:45AM. Half marathon buses will load from the SW corner of the lot on E Hospitality Ln and will depart from 3:45-4:30AM. Please arrive on time and make sure you board the correct bus. From approximately 8:00 AM to 1:30 PM there will be a continuous shuttle for participants to return to their cars from the finish area to the designated parking.\n\nPlease make sure that you are on time and that you get on the right bus! Staff will be on hand to help direct runners and ensure that parking and busing runs smoothly. Estimated travel time is 60 minutes to the full marathon start and 30 minutes to the half marathon start. Please plan your bathroom needs accordingly. Some porta potties will be available at the busing area as well as the start lines.\n\nSpectators will be allowed to park in the area surrounding the finish venue. Please tell your fan club to park on the city streets (Dearborn St and San Bernardino Ave) near the finish venue.\n\nDrop Bags\n\nYou will receive a race bag when you pick up your packet at the expo. This bag is for you to take to the starting areas. A number that matches your race bib will be put on the outside of your race bag. This is to identify your bag at the finish area after the race, and you will need your bib to prove ownership of your bag when you pick it up. Please carry any belongings to the starting area in this bag, as opposed to any other personal bags, which cannot be identified by your race number. Bags must be placed in the bag trucks at the starting areas at least 15 minutes prior to the race start. Please do not leave keys, wallets or valuables in your drop bag.\n\nStart & Finish Areas\n\nStart Areas\n\nThe half marathon begins in the vacant lot located on the South side of Valley of the Falls Dr. in Forest Falls, CA just East of Highway 38. The full marathon begins an additional 13.1 miles up Highway 38 at the Greyback Amphitheater in the San Bernardino National Forest.\n\nPorta-potties, water, Nuun, basic first aid items, and last-minute instructions will be provided at the starting areas. While we will provide gloves and mylar blankets, we highly recommend that you come prepared for cold temperatures at the start line by layering and then shedding your layers to put in your drop bag just before the race begins.\n\nFinish Area\n\nThe finish line is located on E. San Bernardino Ave, between Dearborn St. and Wabash Ave. It is adjacent to the Redlands Sports Park. The finisher's area will be packed with food, massage, vendor booths, and more. Please refer to the above map in the Parking and Busing section for a visual layout of the finish venue.\n\nTiming & Bibs\n\nTiming\n\nThe races will be chip-timed using timing tags adhered to the back of your bib. Your time will begin when you cross the starting line, not at the start gun, and will stop when you cross the finish line. Overall prize winners (top 3 in each race) will be determined by gun time, not chip time. Please do not tamper with the timing chips, as they cannot be replaced once linked to your bib number.\n\nBibs\n\nBecause the timing tag is adhered to the back of your race bib, it is important that you do not cover your bib with clothing or other objects that may interfere with the tag reader when you are crossing the start and finish lines. Furthermore, in order to ensure that race volunteers, officials, and photographers can properly identify you, you must wear your bib on the front of your person in an unobstructed position. If the photographers along the course cannot see your bib number, we will have no way to get your photos to you.\n\nAid Stations\n\nAid stations will be located approximately every two miles along the courses. All aid stations will be supplied with Nuun Endurance Lemon Lime electrolyte drink, water, porta-potties, and basic first aid supplies. Additionally, various aid stations will be supplied with doTERRA Deep Blue, GU Energy gels, fruit, and medical personnel.\n\nSafety & Medical\n\nCourse Safety\n\nThe road will be partially closed to traffic during the race. During this time, the down-bound (Southbound) lane will be reserved for runners. Traffic in the up-bound (Northbound) lane will remain open to up-bound traffic only. Candlestick barricades will be placed along the center of the road, and for your safety you must stay to the right of these cones at all times while in the canyon.\n\nRace volunteers and police officers will be present at all major intersections and turns on the courses to guide runners and stop traffic when necessary. Please follow their directions at all times in order to ensure your safety.\n\nMedical Assistance\n\nEach aid station will be supplied with a first-aid kit that will include items such as bandages, moleskin, vaseline, anti-inflammatories, etc. If you are in need of any of these items, simply stop and ask the volunteers at the aid station and they will be able to help you.\n\nIn addition to the first-aid kits, various aid stations will be staffed by medical professionals and equipped with advanced medical supplies. The medical provider and their trained EMTs will be ready to service runners at the medical aid stations. See the Aid Stations section for more details.\n\nMultiple sag wagons and ambulances will be roaming the course as well to respond to any emergencies and transport runners who cannot continue to the finish line. A full-service medical tent will also be at the finish line.\n\nPacing & Time Limits\n\nTime Limits\n\nBecause the roads used for the race must be re-opened for normal traffic patterns, we are required to set course time limits that must be strictly adhered to. The course time limit for the full marathon is based on a 15:00 minute per mile pace, which is a light jog. This equates to a 6:33 marathon. The time limit for the half marathon is based on a 30:00 minute per mile pace, which is a leisurely walking pace. This equates to a 6:33 half marathon. Both races start at 6:00am, and participants will need to finish by 12:33pm.\n\nThose who are unable to maintain the required pace must consent to be picked up by an escort vehicle and escorted to the finish venue, where they will still be allowed to cross the finish line and receive a medal.\n\nBased on the USATF certification standards the course is measured on tangents or SPR-Shortest Possible Route. Therefore if you run on the inside or outside line the entire length of the race your GPS may reflect a distance slightly greater than 13.1 or 26.2.\n\nPacers\n\nPacers will be running both the full marathon and half marathon to lead everyone to a fast time.\n\nThe full marathon will include pacers at various Boston-qualifying paces, including:\n\n3:00 (Men's 18-34 BQ mark, 6:52/mile pace)\n\n3:05 (Men's 35-39 BQ mark, 7:03/mile pace)\n\n3:10 (Men's 40-44 BQ mark, 7:15/mile pace)\n\n3:20 (Men's 45-49 BQ mark, 7:37/mile pace)\n\n3:30 (Women's 18-34 BQ mark, 8:00/mile pace)\n\n3:35 (Women's 35-39 & Men's 55-59 BQ mark, 8:12/mile pace)\n\n3:40 (Women's 40-44 BQ mark, 8:23/mile pace)\n\n3:50 (Women's 45-49 & Men's 60-64 BQ mark, 8:46/mile pace)\n\n4:05 (Women's 55-59 & Men's 65-69 BQ mark, 9:20/mile pace)\n\n4:20 (Women's 60-64 & Men's 70-74 BQ mark, 9:54/mile pace)\n\nThe half marathon will include pacers at the following paces:\n\n1:30 (6:52/mile pace)\n\n1:40 (7:38/mile pace)\n\n1:50 (8:24/mile pace)\n\n2:00 (9:10/mile pace)\n\n2:10 (9:55/mile pace)\n\n2:20 (10:41/mile pace)\n\nWeather\n\nAlthough we cannot predict the weather, we can provide some historical weather averages for the area on the date of the race:\n\nAverage Low: 52 F\n\nAverage High: 82 F\n\nAverage: 65 F\n\nPlease remember that these are average temperatures for Redlands, CA, and that temperatures may be considerably cooler in the morning at the start. While we will provide gloves and mylar blankets, we highly recommend that you come prepared for cold temperatures at the start line by layering and then shedding your layers to put in your drop bag just before the race begins.\n\nSpectator Information\n\nSpectators will not be allowed on Highway 38 anywhere in the canyon during the race. Spectators are asked to select cheering points in the City of Mentone and City of Redlands only. Please note that there will be no parking allowed along the entire route.\n\nAlternatively, spectators are invited to await the arrival of their runners at the finish venue on E. San Bernardino Ave (adjacent to Redlands Sports Park). There will be plenty of activities and things to see while waiting at the finish line.\n\nSpectators will be allowed to park in the area surrounding the finish venue. Please tell your fan club to plan to park on the city streets (Dearborn St and San Bernardino Ave) near the finish venue.\n\nResults & Awards\n\nAge Divisions\n\nAge divisions include the following:\n\n1-14\n\n15-18\n\n19-24\n\n25-29\n\n30-34\n\n35-39\n\n40-44\n\n45-49\n\n50-54\n\n55-59\n\n60-64\n\n65-69\n\n70-74\n\n75-79\n\n80+\n\nResults\n\nRace times will be available shortly after you cross the line at the race, and will also be posted online as soon as possible after the race."
