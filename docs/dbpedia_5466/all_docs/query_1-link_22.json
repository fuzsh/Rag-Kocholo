Photographers will also be at the finish to capture your sprint across the line and take your photos in front of our backdrops.\n\nAll race photos will be provided for free. We will also use photos you select to create a personalized highlight video for you. It is crazy to pay $50 to $100 for a single image download like you may have experienced before. Your memories are on us! Your photos will be made available shortly after the race along with your results on the results page. You will receive a link via email a few weeks after the event to select the photos for your video.

We guarantee that this will be a shirt you'll want to keep, and maybe purchase an extra or two. During registration you can select between a long sleeve, short sleeve, tank, or tri-blend t-shirt. Select the size of shirt you want, but don't sweat it if you're not sure about sizing. You can try it on at the expo, and if it doesn't fit you can exchange it for a better size, subject to availability. We don't want you to be stuck with a shirt that doesn't fit!\n\nSwag\n\nREVEL White Mountains swag and sponsor swag will be available for pick-up at the expo.

Iced towels will be given to all runners as they cross the finish line.\n\nFinish Line Festivities\n\nOnce you cross the finish line, stick around and enjoy the exciting atmosphere at the finish.

Check out the vendor booths, get a photo in front of our beautiful backdrops, and give a hand to the rest of the runners coming in.\n\nTransfer, Withdrawal & Deferral Policy\n\nWe understand that things come up, which is why we try to be as flexible and accommodating as possible. We allow runners to transfer between distances (half to full or full to half), transfer their entry to another individual, defer to another event, defer to next year and even withdraw from the race if their plans change. Visit our withdrawal, transfer & deferral page for more details.\n\nTravel\n\nRental Cars\n\nREVEL Race Series has teamed up with Enterprise & National to get you the best rate! Book your rental car using this booking link.\n\nAirport\n\nIf you are traveling to REVEL White Mountains, the closest airports are Portland International Jetport (56 miles),Manchester Airport (99 miles), and Boston Logan International Airport (129 miles)\n\nPartnering Hotels\n\nWe have partnered with several hotels in the area to provide our runners with the best rates and additional amenities to make your travel experience great!\n\nExpo\n\nThe REVEL White Mountains Expo will be held at a date, time, and location TBA. REVEL's Online Coach, Paul Carmona will speak at 10:30AM and 3:00PM at the Expo & Packet Pick-Up.\n\nA photo ID is required to pick up your race bag. We will allow individuals to pick up someone else's bag, but will require a digital or hardcopy of the person's ID and a written note authorizing them to do so.\n\nIf you will be arriving in town after the expo is closed or are otherwise unable to attend the expo, you may elect to pick up your packet and bag on race morning for an additional fee. This option may be selected during registration. There is an option to have your entire race packet mailed to you. You may select this option during registration.\n\nParking & Busing\n\nREVEL White Mountains is a point-to-point route and as such, participants are required to utilize race provided shuttles for transportation to the starting areas. Participants should utilize the race-specific parking option or be dropped off near the bus pickup location. Please note, pickup locations and time windows differ between the marathon and half marathon. Race staff members will be assisting at each pickup location. To ensure participants are boarding the appropriate buses specific to their race distance, participants should have race bibs visible at bus loading.\n\nThere is no parking at either race start location and participants are not permitted to being dropped off at the start line.\n\nMarathon buses will load at Settlers Green Outlet Village along Common Court south of the North Conway Grand Hotel from 3:15AM - 4:15AM. Half Marathon buses will load from Cranmore Mountain Resort from 3:45AM - 4:45AM. Estimated travel time is 60 minutes to the full marathon start and 40 minutes to the half marathon start. Please also note, there will be NO overnight parking permitted at any of the race parking locations.\n\nShuttle service from the finish line and to both parking locations will be available between 7:30AM and 1:30PM.\n\nGear Bags\n\nParticipants will be provided with a race bag upon collecting their packet at the expo. This designated bag is intended for use in transporting personal items to the starting areas. Each bag will be affixed with a unique number corresponding to the individual's race bib. This numerical identification facilitates the retrieval process at the finish area post-race. Participants are required to present their bib as proof of ownership when reclaiming their bags.\n\nIt is imperative that participants utilize the provided race bags for transporting belongings to the starting area, rather than utilizing alternative personal bags. This ensures efficient identification based on individual bib numbers. All bags must be deposited into the designated bag trucks stationed at the starting areas no later than 15 minutes prior to the start of the race.\n\nStart & Finish Areas\n\nStart Areas\n\nThe half marathon begins at Russell-Colbath House Parking Area. The full marathon begins at CL Graham Wangan Overlook.\n\nPorta-potties, water, Electrolyte, basic first aid items, and last-minute instructions will be provided at the starting areas. While we will provide gloves and mylar blankets, we highly recommend that you come prepared for cold temperatures at the start line by layering and then shedding your layers to put in your drop bag just before the race begins.\n\nFinish Area\n\nThe finish line is at Ham Arena, located at 87 W Main St, Conway, NH 03818. The finish festival will be open to participants and spectators, as well as visitors and local community members. The festival will offer a variety of post-race amenities for finishers, as well as a beer garden, food & beverage offerings, photo opportunities, and more.\n\nTiming & Bibs\n\nTiming\n\nThe races will be chip-timed using timing tags adhered to the back of your bib. Your time will begin when you cross the starting line, not at the start gun, and will stop when you cross the finish line. Overall prize winners (top 3 in each race) will be determined by gun time, not chip time. Please do not tamper with the timing chips, as they cannot be replaced once linked to your bib number.\n\nBibs\n\nBecause the timing tag is adhered to the back of your race bib, it is important that you do not cover your bib with clothing or other objects that may interfere with the tag reader when you are crossing the start and finish lines. Furthermore, in order to ensure that race volunteers, officials, and photographers can properly identify you, you must wear your bib on the front of your person in an unobstructed position. If the photographers along the course cannot see your bib number, we will have no way to get your photos to you.\n\nAid Stations\n\nAid stations will be located approximately every two miles along the courses. All aid stations will be supplied with electrolyte drink, water, porta-potties, and basic first aid supplies. Additionally, various aid stations will be supplied with doTerra Deep Blue Rub, GU Energy Gels, fruit, and medical personnel. Flavors of GU Energy Gels will include Tri-berry and Salted Caramel (both caffeinated), and Campfire Smores (non-caffeinated).\n\nSafety & Medical\n\nCourse Safety\n\nThe road will be partially closed to traffic during the race. During this time, the westbound lane of Kancamagus Highway will be reserved for runners. The eastbound lane will be utilized for mobilizing two-way vehicle traffic via passing zones navigated by police escorts. Candlestick barricades will be placed along the center of the road, and for your safety you must stay to the left of these cones at all times while on the highway.\n\nRace volunteers and police officers will be present at all major intersections and turns on the courses to guide runners and stop traffic when necessary. Please follow their directions at all times in order to ensure your safety.\n\nMedical Assistance\n\nEach aid station will be supplied with a first-aid kit that will include items such as bandages, moleskin, vaseline, anti-inflammatories, etc. If you are in need of any of these items, simply stop and ask the volunteers at the aid station and they will be able to help you.\n\nIn addition to the first-aid kits, various aid stations will be staffed by medical professionals and equipped with advanced medical supplies. The medical provider and their trained EMTs will be ready to service runners at the medical aid stations. See the Aid Stations section for more details.\n\nMultiple sag wagons and ambulances will be roaming the course as well to respond to any emergencies and transport runners who cannot continue to the finish line. A full-service medical tent will also be at the finish line.\n\nPacing & Time Limits\n\nTime Limits\n\nBecause the roads used for the race must be re-opened for normal traffic patterns, we are required to set course time limits that must be strictly adhered to. The course time limit for the full marathon is based on a 15:00 minute per mile pace, which is a light jog. This equates to a 6:33 marathon. The time limit for the half marathon is based on a 30:00 minute per mile pace, which is a leisurely walking pace. This equates to a 6:33 half marathon. Both races start at 6:00AM, and participants will need to finish by 12:33PM.\n\nThose who are unable to maintain the required pace must consent to be picked up by an escort vehicle and escorted to the finish venue, where they will still be allowed to cross the finish line and receive a medal.\n\nBased on the USATF certification standards the course is measured on tangents or SPR-Shortest Possible Route. Therefore if you run on the inside or outside line the entire length of the race your GPS may reflect a distance slightly greater than 13.1 or 26.2.\n\nPacers\n\nPacers will be running both the full marathon and half marathon to lead everyone to a fast time.\n\nThe full marathon will include pacers at various Boston-qualifying paces, including:\n\n3:00 (Men's 18-34 BQ mark, 6:52/mile pace)\n\n3:05 (Men's 35-39 BQ mark, 7:03/mile pace)\n\n3:10 (Men's 40-44 BQ mark, 7:15/mile pace)\n\n3:20 (Men's 45-49 BQ mark, 7:37/mile pace)\n\n3:30 (Women's 18-34 BQ mark, 8:00/mile pace)\n\n3:35 (Women's 35-39 & Men's 55-59 BQ mark, 8:12/mile pace)\n\n3:40 (Women's 40-44 BQ mark, 8:23/mile pace)\n\n3:50 (Women's 45-49 & Men's 60-64 BQ mark, 8:46/mile pace)\n\n3:55 (Women's 50-54 BQ mark, 8:59/mile pace)\n\n4:05 (Women's 55-59 & Men's 65-69 BQ mark, 9:20/mile pace)\n\n4:20 (Women's 60-64 & Men's 70-74 BQ mark, 9:54/mile pace)\n\nThe half marathon will include pacers at the following paces:\n\n1:30 (6:52/mile pace)\n\n1:40 (7:38/mile pace)\n\n1:50 (8:24/mile pace)\n\n2:00 (9:10/mile pace)\n\n2:10 (9:55/mile pace)\n\n2:20 (10:41/mile pace)\n\nWeather\n\nAlthough we cannot predict the weather, we can provide some historical weather averages for the area on the date of the race:\n\nAverage Low: 38 F\n\nAverage High: 65 F\n\nAverage: 52 F\n\nPlease remember that these are average temperatures for Conway, NH, and that temperatures may be considerably cooler in the morning at the start. While we will provide gloves and mylar blankets, we highly recommend that you come prepared for cold temperatures at the start line by layering and then shedding your layers to put in your drop bag just before the race begins.\n\nSpectator Information\n\nDue to the restricted and controlled vehicle traffic pattern being implemented on Kancamagus Highway throughout the race, spectators will not be allowed to spectate along the highway. Spectators are encouraged to show their support as runners cross the finish line at Ham Arena. The finish festival will feature plenty of activities while waiting for runners to reach the finish line.\n\nSpectator parking will be available near the finish festival at Kennett Middle School. Please note Kennett Middle School is a short walking distance from the finish festival and no specator parking will be available at Ham Arena.\n\nResults & Awards\n\nAge Divisions\n\nAge divisions include the following:\n\n1-14\n\n15-18\n\n19-24\n\n25-29\n\n30-34\n\n35-39\n\n40-44\n\n45-49\n\n50-54\n\n55-59\n\n60-64\n\n65-69\n\n70-74\n\n75-79\n\n80+\n\nResults\n\nRace times and results are live and will be available shortly after you cross the finish line."
