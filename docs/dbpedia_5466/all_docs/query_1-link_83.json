        "text": "Run Oak Island is part of the BAM! Race Series (BAM is short for Big. Ass. Medals.) 2025 will be the 12th year for this series that started in 2014 with Run Sunset Beach being the very first event for Coastal Race Productions. While the bling might catch your eye, race day and our team will keep you coming back for more! We hope you’ll join us to earn your own Big Ass Medal!\n\nNOTE: You do NOT have to run all 3 events in the series (although we’d love you to!) You can participate in just 1 individual event and you will earn all the swag (medal/shirt/etc..) from that event weekend.\n\nSo, why do we call it the BAM! Series? Well, everyone calls it that because these finisher medals (that everyone earns) are massive! Even the 5K finishers earn a 4″ medal, the 10K are 5″ and the half marathon medals are 6″ and the Oak Island Full Marathon medal is 8″ wide! We even sell a custom hand-made medal rack for you to display them on if you’d like!\n\nIf you choose to run any combination of 5K, half marathon, full marathon or virtual event with us at each of the 3 BAM races in a calendar year – you’ll earn some extra swag! And this year it is a MASSIVE medal!\n\nThe 2025 BAM Series includes 3 races:\n\nRun Oak Island (2/15) l Run Sunset Beach (4/12) l Run Ocean Isle Beach (10/25)\n\nWe are excited to host 3,000+ participants in the 2025 Run Oak Island Ultra, Full Marathon, (2) Half Marathons, 10K, 5K and 1 Mile races on Saturday February 15th! Below are the course maps with downloadable PDF’s and certifications for you to review! If you want to share the maps with anyone, please CLICK HERE and share that specific page.\n\nULTRA MARATHON (26.25 Miles) & FULL MARATHON (26.2 Miles)\n\nStarting just before sunrise at 6:45am, The Ultra & Full Marathons start together along with the East Half Marathoners. You’ll see the sunrise over the marsh in the first few miles. The country club and arboretum bring beautiful scenery and some shade if its a warmer sunny day as well as some 1,000 yr old live oak trees. Snag a selfie with the lighthouse before turning around with ocean views on and off for the next 11 miles. Tackle the intracoastal bridge around mile 23 and enjoy a flat race to the finish line. Please review the turn-by-turn route below.\n\n*One of the flattest & most scenic full marathons on the East Coast.\n\n*World’s Shortest Ultra Marathon!\n\nDOWNLOAD PDF OF THE FULL MARATHON COURSE\n\n-FULL MARATHON CERTIFICATION: NC19001BDS-\n\n*An Ultra Marathon is anything longer than a Full Marathon. The ultra is not “certified”, however, you run the Full Marathon and an extra .05 miles making it the worlds shortest ultra (that we know of).\n\nEAST HALF MARATHON (13.1 MILES)\n\nYou basically run with the Full Marathon participants out to the lighthouse. You skip the arboretum and have a different turnaround (AFTER THE FULL MARATHON’S TURNAROUND) and you’ll break away to the finish line taking a right on 46th St. as the full marathon continues straight to the West end of the island. This is the FLATTEST Half Marathon you will find! Please review the map and turn-by-turn route below.\n\nDOWNLOAD PDF OF THE “EAST” HALF MARATHON COURSE\n\n-HALF MARATHON CERTIFICATION NC19031BDS-\n\nWEST HALF MARATHON (13.1 MILES)\n\nStarting 15 minutes after the Ultra Marathon, Full Marathon & East Half Marathon; the East Half starts at 7:00am along with the 10K runners. Participants enjoy a scenic 5 miles along the ocean (running on the road) before tackling a 65’ elevation over the intracoastal waterway bridge (twice) around mile 9. It’s a little more challenging than the East but also provides a whopping 6.5 HOUR time limit so it’s very walker friendly and not intimidating at all. We do not offer pacers, overall or age group awards for the West Half – those are all provided on the competitive East Half Marathon. Please review your turn-by-turn route below.\n\nDOWNLOAD PDF OF THE “WEST” HALF MARATHON COURSE\n\n– HALF MARATHON CERTIFICATION NC16006BW –\n\n10K (6.2 MILES)\n\nThe 10K starts with the West Half Marathon at 7:00am. You’ll run with the West Half Marathoner’s until you reach 3rd Pl. You take a right, quick left, turnaround and head straight back to the finish. It’s a very east flat and fast route with minimal turns and a scenic oceanfront view (while running on the road) for half of the race. You’ll finish under the same arch you started under. Please review your turn-by-turn route below.\n\nDOWNLOAD PDF OF THE 10K COURSE\n\n-10K CERTIFICATION NC24003DF-\n\n5K – Starting just 15 minutes after the 10K and West Half Marathon, the 5K takes off at 7:15am. Running at ZERO elevation, this flat and fast 5K has minimal turns for you to reach your new PR! You’ll have over 1 mile ocean front running (on the road) and 1 turnaround. Please review your turn-by-turn route below.\n\nDOWNLOAD PDF OF THE 5K COURSE\n\n– 5K CERTIFICATION: NC16005BW –\n\n1 Mile – This is an easy out and back on a backroad (Dolphin Dr.) where you finish into the same arch as all of the other participants. It starts at 8:00am on 46th St. between Dolphin Dr. & Ocean Blvd.\n\n*The 1 Mile is not timed or certified. It is a fun run/walk.\n\nIf you can’t make it to the race on race day – you can choose to run these events virtual. This page will explain:\n\n– What is a virtual race?\n\n– How to sign up for a virtual race?\n\n– How to complete a virtual race?\n\n– Can I switch to virtual if I’m already registered for the in-person event?\n\n– And a few other FAQ’s.\n\nWhat is a Virtual Race?\n\nA virtual race is when you run the event on your own time – where ever you want. While we can’t wrap up the after party and ship you the beer and bbq, we will ship you your swag items in the mail after the event.\n\nHow to sign up for Virtual?\n\nThis is super easy. Just head over to the registration page and find the registration distance you want to sign up with that also says “Virtual”. So if you want to run the half marathon virtually – select “Virtual Half Marathon”.\n\nHow To Complete A Virtual Race?\n\nThis is on the honor system. Run anywhere/anytime, no need to send us proof or log your miles online. Everyone that is registered for virtual will get the swag (medal & giveaway) shipped to your door within 2 weeks after the race.\n\nCan I Switch To Virtual If I’m Registered For The In-Person Race?\n\nYes, but there are deadlines and a small $15 processing fee to cover the shipping/handling. If you’ve signed up to be at the race but for any reason you can’t make it and want to switch or “transfer” your race to a virtual race, here are a couple of things to keep in mind:\n\n#1) It must be done no less than 7 days in advance before the event.\n\n#2) You must manage this yourself by logging into your RunSignUp account and choosing the “Event Transfer” option and choose the “Virtual” option for your distance and race. Again, keep in mind there will be an online processing fee to make any changes.\n\nFAQ’s & Policies:\n\nPlease keep in mind, these are our policies and they may differ from another virtual race company. We think you will find our options very accommodating to you as a runner and we ask that you please read them carefully. We are a small company and cannot make any special exceptions\n\nThis is something that you must register for separately and the following registration policies apply.\n\nMust be registered for the virtual option in order to receive race packet by mail.\n\nIf you are registered to run in a race and cannot attend, all of the registration policies on our FAQ page still apply to you. The only way to run a race virtually and receive your packet in the mail is if you are registered under the virtual option.\n\nYou may transfer to the virtual option up to 7 days prior to an event. You will manage this through your personal RunSignUp account and there is a $15.00 processing fee. CLICK HERE to login.\n\nPackets will not be available for pick up race weekend. Even if you come to the race for any reason, or send family/friends to pick up your packet, we will not hand out any bibs, shirts, medals, or other swag items for any virtuals during a race weekend.\n\nALL virtual packets will be mailed within 2 weeks of the race.\n\nWe will only ship packets to those who are actually registered for the virtual option. (Cut off for this is 7days prior to the each event)\n\n*If you decide to come to the race instead of run it virtually. You must manage this through your RunSignUp account 7 days prior to the event. You will have to pay the difference in price as well as a $15.00 processing fee but we would love to have you join us! It’s so much more fun to run with friends!\n\nNO EXCEPTIONS!\n\nGeneral FAQ’S:\n\nVisit our General FAQ’s page for answer’s to all of your questions regarding Coastal Race Events.\n\n*Please Note:\n\n#1) Anyone on the course without a race bib will be asked to leave the course.\n\n#2) Anyone running with a dog unless you have the required USATF paper work will be asked to leave the course.\n\n#3) Companion riders on bicycles are not allowed and will be asked to leave the course.\n\nThese are all due to insurance regulations and are grounds for disqualification – It is for the safety of ALL participants.\n\nRegistration Policy:\n\nWe allow for deferrals, event transfers and bib transfers with minimal fees and deadlines. We currently do not allow for refunds or race transfers on our events. You may read more about this on our FAQ page here.\n\nEvent Transfer:\n\nIf you want to change from one distance to another distance at the same race on the same weekend, we allow you to do this yourself prior to any Coastal Race Productions event. This cutoff to switch is typically the final week leading up to a race and based upon availability in that event. You will manage this through your RunSignUp account and there is a $15 processing fee. Need Help? Click Here for a tutorial on how to edit this.\n\nCourse Support:\n\nThe full marathon will have 13 different water stops along the route and the half marathon will have 7 different water stops along the 13.1 mile course. All stops have water and Gatorade. There is 1 water stop along the 5K course and 2 along the 10K course as well. Volunteers from Non-Profits across Brunswick County are assisting on the course for directions, as well as at the finish line and all of the water stops. Signage is marked on the ground, over 100 directional signs, and a biker will lead the half and full marathon courses. We have 8′ mile marker flags for every mile on the 5K, 10K, Half Marathon & Full Marathon. Post race nourishment includes bananas, gatorade, bbq and beer! You’re going to LOVE running a Coastal Race Productions event!\n\nPhotos:\n\nWe hire some amazing photographers to provide FREE race day photos to you. While they try to get some of everyone, there are no guarantees! All photos will be uploaded to our Facebook page, please feel free to download them, tag yourself and share with your friends and family.\n\nCan I walk:\n\nAbsolutely! Our 1 Mile and 5K races have no time limit and our “West” Half Marathon time limit is 6.5 hours – plenty of time to walk most of the course if you’d like. If registering for the “East” Half Marathon, we ask that you’re able to finish in 3.5 hours. If you feel like you will be close to the 3.5 hour time limit on the East Half Marathon, we suggest registering for the West.\n\nAge Restrictions:\n\nWe have no age restrictions however we do ask for parent or guardian signatures on all minors under 18 years of age. Young athletes should be guided by an adult or be comfortable running a pace that will allow them to be completed within our time limits. They also need to be able to run on a partially open course with others.\n\nAre Dogs Allowed:\n\nSorry but they are not allowed on USATF certified courses. In order to be a sanctioned event – dogs are not allowed for safety reasons. If you have a 4 legged running companion for medical reasons, you can file a request through the USATF ADA Committee (which takes 4-6 weeks) by clicking here and if they approve, they will provide you documentation that you will then need to provide to us. Here is a direct link to the form you’ll need to fill out.\n\nRegister Offline:\n\nWe really prefer for you to register online if at all possible – it’s quick and easy with the link at the top of the page. We don’t offer offline or paper entries. Please email us if you have any concerns with registering online and we’ll do our best to accommodate you as an anonymous registrant or other options.\n\nCertified Course:\n\nEvery Coastal Race Productions event is certified with USATF and measured for accuracy. If you are hopeful for a state or national record, please give us a heads up so that we’re expecting it and can take proper actions to fill out the paperwork needed for your submission. Our courses are not just close – they are exact! Our Oak Island Marathon is a Boston Qualifier.\n\n*The 1 Mile is not a timed or certified distance.\n\nDiscounts:\n\nWe’re offering the lowest prices we can for everyone and have done away with any discounts. You’ll notice price increases as we get closer to raceday so register early to save the most. Also, if you bundle and register for more than 1 race at a time, you’ll save even more (bundle discounts not valid during super early bird registration)\n\nTiming:\n\nWe partner with a professional Timing Company that will provide accurate results. These will be available to print on race day and online immediately upon crossing the finish line.\n\nOverall awards are placed by Gun Time – be sure to get to the very front of the corral.\n\nAge group awards are placed by Chip Time – meaning you can start near the back and your official start time won’t be until you cross the start line. This also means that it’s possible for someone behind you to have a faster time and place higher."
