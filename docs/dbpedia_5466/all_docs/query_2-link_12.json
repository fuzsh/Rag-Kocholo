        "text": "Post hook...scroll stopper...opening line...call it whatever you want, but that first line of your LinkedIn post is super important if you want to capture the attention of your reader.\n\nBUT HOW?!\n\nThis was one of the things that I used to struggle with the most when I would sit down in front of my computer. I knew the story that I wanted to tell...but I have no clue how to tell that story effectively.\n\nI've been creating content (sometimes more, sometimes less) on LinkedIn since 2016. Here are some ideas to help you get started on your next post!\n\n1. Ask questions\n\nThis is probably the easiest hook that you can create and works great! Pose a question to the reader that speak to their passions, interests, or even things that they dislike! The key is to make it interesting enough that they'll genuinely think about the answer. So, for example, let's say you're a dentist. Instead of:\n\nIs gingivitis and plaque a concern of yours?\n\nAsk something more like this, that speaks to the challenges they might be having:\n\nWant to smile for photos and not feel self conscious when you say cheese?\n\nYou can also speak directly to something you know your audience loves or might have a strong opinion, like this:\n\nDo you love coffee?\n\nDoes pineapple belong on pizza?\n\nShould North America switch to a four day workweek?\n\nLastly, you can make 'em ponder with a head scratching questions like:\n\nWhat does x and x have in common? (make it a surprising combo)\n\nWould you rather x or x?\n\n2. Share a shocking or surprising statistic\n\nThis one is pretty self explanatory, but share a short statistic that would shock or surprise your reader like (just as an example this isn't a fact!)\n\nDid you know that by the time you've finished ready this line, 2 new users have signed up for LinkedIn?\n\nAnd if you're not sure how to find interesting statistics to share, Google is your bestie.\n\nYou can try just searching for your keyword (the topic that you want to discuss) + statistics or facts to find some gems. When I'm looking for stats specifically on LinkedIn users, I also include the year, like this:\n\nInteresting or surprising quotes are another way to open your LinkedIn post, like this one about social media:\n\n“Social media has given us this idea that we should all have a posse of friends when in reality, if we have one or two really good friends, we are lucky.” – Brene Brown\n\n3. Make it personal\n\nReaders love seeing the human side of the writer (you), and stories have existed since our cavemen days, sitting around a fire. It connects us in our shared humanity, and a good story hook, in my opinion, is by far the most powerful opening line that you can create for your LinkedIn post.\n\nHere are a couple examples of story hooks.\n\nThis is a hook followed by a pause before you would share the full story:\n\nI never imagined that I would be sharing this story...that this would have happened to me in real life...\n\nHere's a story hook that uses a surprisingly statement and the rest of the post would explain the statement:\n\nJust two weeks in my new job, my career was over. There was no coming back from this.\n\n4. Use a metaphor or speak to a shared value\n\nIf you're struggling to write that first line, start with the message of the post or story. For example, if I wrote a LinkedIn post about the importance of family and having a work life balance, for my first line, I might simply say:\n\nThe one place that you are irreplaceable is at home.\n\n5. Paint a picture\n\nShift the focus entirely onto the reader and take them for a ride in their imagination. Let them picture themselves in a certain emotional state. Some of the words that work well for \"imagine\" posts are:\n\nEnvision\n\nPicture\n\nConsider\n\nVisualize\n\nPonder\n\nExplore\n\nIn the near future, traditional office spaces have become obsolete, and companies have embraced a fully virtual working environment.\n\nIn your role as HR, you are tasked with resolving a complex workplace conflict between two team members.\n\nIn the world of LinkedIn, capturing the attention of your readers starts with a compelling opening line. Whether you choose to ask thought-provoking questions, share surprising statistics, tell personal stories, use metaphors, or paint vivid pictures, the goal is to engage your audience from the very beginning. Remember, storytelling and connecting on a human level can be incredibly powerful in creating an impactful post.\n\nSo, the next time you sit down to write a LinkedIn post, put these ideas into practice and watch as your opening line becomes a scroll stopper that grabs the attention of your readers. Happy writing!\n\nIf you found this post helpful, I would so love if you'd share it with your LinkedIn community!
