If you have already received your packet and your virtual bib number, contact us at [email protected] with your request.\n\nWAVES\n\nHow do the waves work?\n\nWe invented and continue to perfect the wave start, which has been used at the BOLDERBoulder since 1982. There are over 100 waves in the BOLDERBoulder with each wave is organized by pace. so you can race, run, jog, or walk at your own speed.\n\nThe first 39 waves (a 10K time faster than 75:00) require a proof of time that we can place you in the exact right wave for your pace.\n\nYou can select any of the other waves without proof of finish time. This way you can participate with others like yourself and not get lost in a mass start. Learn more about how our waves work.\n\nThe wave start allows us to manage the entire race based upon how many participants we place in each wave. We can calculate the correct and proper size and layout for each start group (wave), and establish the specific start times and exact time increments in between each wave.\n\nThrough this process, we can structure the event and manage when participants get to the start, where they stage, how they progress through the course, and how they arrive at the finish for their unimpeded and uninterrupted crossing at the finish line in Folsom Field.\n\nDo I need to qualify? Only for the first 39 waves.\n\nThe first 30 waves are set aside for those who expect to finish faster than 75 minutes and have a qualifying time since May 29th, 2023.\n\nHere’s how you can qualify:\n\nUse your 2023 BOLDERBoulder time: Anything 1:15:00 or faster gets you in the perfect qualified wave for your pace.\n\nUse your 2023 ColderBOLDER 5K time: Anyone who finished faster than 32:38 minutes automatically gets in a qualified wave. Check your results.\n\nUse other races (since May 29th, 2023) Use results from ANY timed race, from three miles to a marathon, which you’ve completed since May 29th, 2023 and we’ll place you in a qualified wave based upon your time. Check the Equivalent Times Chart to see how your race time translates to a 10K time. Submit your result to [email protected].\n\nCan I start with friends or family? Yes.\n\nWe can help you start with your family or friends; the rest of the day is up to you. If you want to be in the same start wave, register everyone online at the same time. Enter the names of those you want to run with in the appropriate field. Qualifying rules still apply, and everyone in your group will be placed in the slowest person’s wave (it helps if everyone chooses the same participant type).\n\nCan I change waves once I register? Yes.\n\nIf you want to change waves or to run in a qualified wave, we can make that happen, assuming there are still bibs available in the wave you want. The cost is $10.\n\nTo request a bib number change prior to the race, email us at [email protected] – Note: you won’t be allowed to move up to a faster wave on race day unless you have the correct bib number for that wave.\n\nFor all bib changes on Saturday or Sunday, bring us your original bib number and come to our SOLUTIONS tent at the Race Weekend Sports Exhibit on the Pearl Street Mall.\n\nWe will also accommodate Race Day bib changes for $15 – bring your original bib number and come to our SOLUTIONS TENT at the START AREA in the parking lot near 30th and Walnut beginning at 5:30 a.m. on Monday May 29th\n\nGENERAL\n\nIs the course wheelchair accessible?
