        "text": "When you want to click something specific on the slide, like each arrow shape here, to start an animation effect, use a trigger.\n\nOn this slide, each green arrow triggers a text effect when I click it.\n\nHere is the sequence, again: Arrow 1 triggers the first text animation, which is a Wipe entrance effect.\n\nArrow 2 triggers the second effect, and Arrow 3 triggers the third.\n\nCompare this with a typical list animation, where I click to play each effect, but I don’t click anything specific to do it.\n\nIn the first example, the effect starts only when I click an arrow, which is a trigger for the effect.\n\nSo, triggers let me specify click points for effects.\n\nI can create as many triggers as I need.\n\nFor example, I could make this text banner be a trigger also—starting a picture effect.\n\nTo set up a trigger, you first apply an animation effect to the thing you want to trigger.\n\nFor this slide, I want to trigger a text effect on this banner shape.\n\nI’ll select the shape and apply a Wipe entrance effect.\n\nNow, I specify a trigger for the effect. In the Animation Pane, I select the effect, which activates the Trigger command.\n\nI click Trigger, point to On Click of, and select Arrow 1, which is my arrow shape over here.\n\nNow the arrow is a trigger.\n\nTriggers are useful for starting sound files and videos, which PowerPoint views as animation effects.\n\nInstead of clicking the sound media on this slide to play it, I can pull it off the slide, so it never appears, and set up a trigger to play it, namely this button shape.\n\nOn the slide, when I click the button, it triggers the sound effect.\n\nOn a slide with video, I can do the same thing: pull the video media off the slide, set it to Play Full Screen, and create a trigger to start it— this big green arrow.\n\nOn the slide, when I click the big green arrow, it triggers the video to play."
