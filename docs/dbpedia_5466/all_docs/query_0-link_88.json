        "text": "Read\n\nNovember 11, 2023\n\nDNF @ 65%. But to be honest, I started skimming around the 35% mark. This was not it. I‚Äôm sorry, but it was actually bad; I don‚Äôt usually type long reviews for books I don‚Äôt finish, but this pissed me off badly enough to do exactly that. It‚Äôs even worse that I had high expectations, which just serves as a reminder that you should never have high expectations for books. Now what exactly was wrong with this book? Well, many things.\n\n1) Unbalanced dynamics. You expect me to believe that Jakub was just all fine and dandy with Ethan and Creed being all lovey dovey when the team accused him of being homophobic? How does that make any sense unless he‚Äôs a robot? This book was in no way realistic, which would be fine if it had anything else going for it. The author essentially wrote Jakub as some unemotional cyborg to keep up with her plot, and it was irritating as hell. Speaking of irritation, not only was I annoyed at the dynamics, but the lack of equal POV‚Äôs pissed me off. This is what I despise most about ‚Äúwhy choose‚Äù books; there‚Äôs bound to be uneven POV‚Äôs unless you switch off every chapter to give each character a fair perspective. But nope, the author clearly messed up here because it‚Äôs primarily Ethan and Creed sharing their thoughts. And the cut-off‚Äôs for certain chapters were so unnecessary and lazy. Like how are you going to cut Jakub and Ethan‚Äôs Xmas time together short and switch to Ethan and Creed cuddling right after. Why wasn‚Äôt there a damn full chapter of Ethan and Jakub that didn‚Äôt involve sex in some way? You really think they‚Äôre in love? Gtfo. Jakub not even being mentioned by name in the blurb just proves this book to be unbalanced. Idgaf about what your thoughts are on poly relationships (I‚Äôm fine with them if they‚Äôre written well), but excluding a whole character and trying to justify it by writing he was okay with it is just mediocre writing. It takes away personality and makes it hard to connect.\n\n2) Bland characters with a dull ‚Äúromance.‚Äù For the amount of tropes this book covers, you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be more interesting. Unfortunately, this was stale and boring as hell. You expect me to believe that Ethan and Creed loved each other when there was literally NO build up that was SHOWN rather than TOLD. It was just written that they loved each other and that Jakub was okay with it, but that‚Äôs just lazy writing. You can‚Äôt just tell the readers that something is happening just to say it occurred; fucking show it through descriptive writing and actual meaningful interactions. Enough with the ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù every other chapter when there was more time spent interacting with college/high school students or teammates than as a couple/throuple. Individually, the characters were terrible. How did we drift so far away from actual endearing or interesting characters like Egon and Rakesh to such dry, unimaginative characters here? Jakub at least was romantic with the roses and candles, but other than that, he was robotic and drab. Ethan was ridiculous, and I didn‚Äôt see his appeal at all; how the hell did this man pull 2 dudes? It‚Äôs a mystery. Credence was by far the worst though. Sure, he felt more human in the sense that he possessed insecurities, but goddamn was he plain. Anytime it was his POV, I rolled my eyes so hard. The only cool or unique thing about him was his name. And, I love how most of their interactions were sex-based or focused around saying ‚Äúily‚Äù with no reason to (notice the sarcasm?)!!! So much romance HAHAHAAHAHAHH üòê\n\nIt would‚Äôve been fine to claim Ethan and Creed loved each other for years before actually getting together if they were referenced in the first book. But nope, they were new characters that were introduced here, meaning that their relationship felt so shallow and meaningless due to a lack of build-up.\n\nI commend the author or editor or whoever made those errors in the previous book for improving their grammar. However, in exchange for less mistakes, there was a lack of descriptive scenes. Basically, it wasn‚Äôt a good trade-off at all. Similar to Jakub‚Äôs trade to Buffalo. I really wish it was Creed‚Äôs ass that got traded or hell, I wish this was an MMMM so that things felt more balanced. I‚Äôm sorry for being so judgmental and rude here, but this book was such a shame. I‚Äôll just reread Shiver instead of entertaining this further.\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\n* 4 stars *\n\nStarting Line is the second book in the For Puck's Sake series by Crea Reitan, but it can also be read as a standalone.\n\nIt's a nicely done MMM story between three hockey players. Two of them, Jakub and Ethan, are secretly married and have an open relationship. They're playing for different teams so they're also doing the long-distance thing. They're always honest with each other, completely open about everything, and very secure in their relationship and their feelings. They have a strong relationship despite the physical distance between them through most of the year because they put a lot of effort into communicating and being totally honest.\n\nThe third MC, Creed, is Ethan's teammate, linemate, and one of his closest friends. It's clear there's something more than friendship between them even though they haven't taken that step yet at the beginning of the story. Jakub knows about Creed, has known about him from the start, and is aware of Ethan's feelings. He's supportive and encourages Ethan to pursue what's between them.\n\nThere's absolutely no cheating in this story. Everyone is on the same page, everything is happening out in the open, they're all honest and they're all on board with the evolution of their relationships.\n\nFor me, the story really began once Jakup got traded and all three of them were on the same team. It happened fairly early in the book but I still wish it was even sooner.\n\nAfter that happened, the relationship between all three of them started to change. They were spending a lot of time together getting to know each other and becoming comfortable in each other's company. Creed started to relax more with Jakub and to trust him. He had some self-confidence issues that Ethan and Jakub helped him overcome, and even though he didn't quite overcome them, he did reach a point where he felt safe with both of them.\n\nI won't go into too much detail about the later part of the book, I'll just say that I'm glad we also got to see them all together in a relationship and the book didn't end right when they figured things out.\n\nAll three of them worked well together, it was like they completed each other. I don't think there was a missing piece in Jakub and Ethan's relationship before Creed but I do believe that he fit with both of them effortlessly.\n\n~ Copy provided by Bayou Book Junkie for my reading pleasure. A review wasn't a requirement. ~\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\n2.5\n\nHablan demasiado de cosas ajenas a lo que nos interesa... üôÑ\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nI actually really enjoyed the main characters and their dynamic but there was too much else going on in this book that distracted from them. Literally every single side character in this book read like they cameos from books the author previously wrote or like they were being set up to be main characters in a sequel, which is great for a couple characters, but not every. single. one. And all that only for the main characters of the first book of this series to be mentioned briefly once lol.\n\nI don‚Äôt wanna rag on this book too much, it just wasn‚Äôt for me, which was disappointing because there was a great story and relationship dynamic going on there that made me want it to be for me.\n\nBut also, there‚Äôs like a 2 page full break down of this world‚Äôs OnlyFans type websites that was just‚Ä¶ bizarrely detailed and entirely unnecessary? I think they were trying to set up this storyline where Creed finds out his younger cousin was kicked out by his family for making porn on ReachMe (a dumb name for OnlyFans). But that was even more confusing because instead of Creed, a millionaire who knows how hurtful it was to be shunned by his bigoted family reaching out to offer to help support his 18 year old cousin, instead he digs around to find his cousin‚Äôs account and makes his whole hockey team subscribe to it?? And that‚Äôs the last we hear of it??\n\nEver so slight very mild spoiler: one of the reasons this book is a 2 star read for me instead of a 3 star is it is mentioned at least a dozen times since like chapter 2 how bad Creed‚Äôs agent is and how much he needs a new one. By halfway in I told myself if Creed didn‚Äôt get a new agent by the end of the book, it was an automatic 2 stars because that‚Äôs just ridiculous. And, well. Lol.\n\nMay 12, 2024\n\nI enjoyed the book a lot, and I thought the way it was written was very sensitive and thoughtful. I just wish I could read a poly book where half the book didn‚Äôt have to be a careful justification on why different forms of love are valid and beautiful.\n\nMy favourite parts were when the team supported them unconditionally.\n\nDecember 20, 2023\n\nThis story of an open relationship becoming a triad is sweet and warm, and I do like a book that has unusual dynamics. The most interesting point for that was early on, when Ethan, who has been happily but secretly married to Jakub (who plays for an opposing team) for years, realizes he's also falling in love with Creed, a teammate. Since he and Jakub have had an open marriage, the new part for them is having something more than just sex involved with a third party. And then, as they are negotiating life as a V with Ethan the guy in two separate relationships, Jakub gets traded to the same team. Something he and Ethan would've adored years ago, but now complicated by the new relationship with Creed.\n\nI had to suspend disbelief somewhat, mostly with regard to Jakub, who was portrayed as a saint about watching his husband falling for someone else at a distance, while he was alone and isolated. Ethan had it all - the chance to be out, supportive teammates, supportive management, more star power, and a lover right there within reach. Jakub was closeted and alone. That Jakub had no bitterness, no jealousy, had in fact endured that imbalance of fortunes for so long without any regret, seemed implausible. (And the book would've been much more interesting, though less sweet, if he had battled his own jealousy and insecurity as he tried to support Ethan.) I also wished we had seen a bit more ambivalence on the part of Ethan's teammates - their wholehearted support was lovely but not nuanced.\n\nI did like the coming out process, and the external impacts, since we got some much needed conflict there. The loving moments had a lot of caretaking (which I'm a bit of a sucker for) and some elements like sensation play that we don't see as often. Early on, I wished the author had written a book where an open relationship was allowed to keep working, but those are unpopular with romance readers so I understand the impetus behind providing a solid, warm, conclusive HEA.\n\nNovember 3, 2023\n\nStarting Line, book two in the For Puck‚Äôs Sake series-\n\nMy rating is 4 stars.\n\nThis is the second book in a standalone series. There is some character crossover but it isn‚Äôt necessary to read all the books to comprehend and experience this one. (I haven‚Äôt read the first book.)\n\nThe tropes within this book are:\n\nMMM\n\nFound family\n\nObedience\n\nCaregiver\n\nCuckold\n\nSensation Play\n\nVoyeurism/Exhibitionism\n\nHigh Emotion\n\nVideo sex\n\nHEA\n\nThis is the first book that I‚Äôve read by Crea Reitan and I REALLY enjoyed it. It is so much more than just another MMM hockey romance. I loved the depth of emotions in this book!I also really appreciated the physical differences written between the three MMC‚Äôs, it made the book more realistic, in my opinion. The found family trope hits hard, as well, and I‚Äôm a huge fan of that trope.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to give any spoilers but this book was better than I anticipated. This is all about inclusivity and love. The evolution of the relationship between Ethan, Jakub and Creed was absolutely breathtaking. The support characters were exactly that! So supportive and protective of their teammates. Jakub is my favorite MMC, the caretaker, he did a brilliant job caring for his laskos. The spice was spicin‚Äô and this book contains one of the hottest spice scenes I‚Äôve ever read.\n\nIt ends with an HEA but I wish there would have been something‚Ä¶more. I‚Äôm not sure what but, I wanted more. I hope the author writes a novella with Creed‚Äôs perfect‚Ä¶day in it. I would love to see that. Overall, this is a great read and I will be going and reading from the author‚Äôs backlist. Crea Reitan has earned another fan!\n\nI received an advance reader copy and am leaving my review voluntarily.\n\nMay 4, 2024\n\n3.75üåü\n\nInitially I thought I wasn‚Äôt going to be a fan because with this book and the first, the story started off pretty slow and boring. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, on any other day I would‚Äôve probably DNF‚Äôed but this author can take all my gold coins after the masterpiece that was shiver.\n\nI love how different these books are, I don‚Äôt wanna spoil anything but I was afraid of the chemistry between the characters because of the ‚Äúlong distance marriage‚Äù elements in the plot. I was pleasantly surprised when I feel in love with the characters and the love they have for each other. I also love that this didn‚Äôt have an unrealistic ending. The author gave the characters a happy ending while reminding us that the world has a long way to go.\n\n_________________\n\nDidn‚Äôt think I was gonna continue the series after reading shiver but at this point, it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôm obsessed!\n\nRead\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\n‚ÄúI want to be with both of you together.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs like my mind reminding me that the world isn‚Äôt black and white like that. Not everything is a choice. Sometimes you can keep both options.\n\nARC Review~\n\nI‚Äôm withholding a star rating for the moment because this book left me feeling conflicted. The parts that I loved - I *loved* but not all of it worked for me.\n\nThe book starts with Jakub and Ethan being secretly married for years and playing on different hockey teams. This arrangement works for them as they want to focus on their careers first and they‚Äôve always had an open relationship. Ethan has been slowly falling in love with his teammate Creed and once Jakub gives him the green light to pursue that relationship it seems like every is going to go well. Until Jakub is traded and all three men end up on the same team as the starting line.\n\nThe three MCs are almost too perfect and their interactions were sweet, heartbreaking, sexy, or funny when the moment called for it. I really enjoyed watching them navigate their non-traditional romance together. The spice was interesting! The sensory play scene in particular was both erotic and showed how much they all trusted each other.\n\nAt times it felt like the book focused more on the way a poly queer relationship is view by society rather than the developing relationship itself. There was so much going on outside of the relationship but I wanted more character interaction because what we get is really special. I‚Äôm not at all dismissing the topics the author wanted to touch on, they‚Äôre incredibly important, but it came across almost preachy at times and took me out of the story.\n\nI think if you like your romance with a hefty side of social commentary this might be for you!\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nYay, one of my favourite authors has another book out. It‚Äôs an MMM read and another book to add to her ‚ÄúFor Puck‚Äôs Sake‚Äù series. You don‚Äôt need to read book one to get this story. (But it‚Äôs my favourite so far, so if you haven‚Äôt read ‚ÄúShiver‚Äù and you like this type of book, then go grab it, you won‚Äôt be sorry)\n\nEthan doesn‚Äôt hide who he is, and that‚Äôs a gay man playing ice hockey. He‚Äôs good at his sport. He‚Äôs also known in the press as a bit of a player, always with a new man‚Ä¶..\n\nBut Ethan has a secret, and if it ever got out‚Ä¶. Well it could be bad news for anyone associated with him‚Ä¶..\n\nBut since meeting and playing with his teammate Creed, Ethan hadn‚Äôt looked at another man‚Ä¶. He wants Creed, but dating a teammate can get messy and Ethan feels if he lets go then his feelings for Creed could turn into something more!\n\nCreed has crushed and loved his teammate Ethan almost as long as he‚Äôs known him. He knows his feelings would be reciprocated, but something is hold Ethan back. He just wants a change at a happiness he never had as a young man. Will Ethan ever love him back?\n\nAnd the third person in this story ‚Ä¶. Jakub. Also a hockey player, and Ethan‚Äôs secret husband! He‚Äôs the caregiver in this long distance relationship, he loves Ethan with every molecule in his body. He‚Äôs also aware of Ethan‚Äôs attraction to Creed.\n\nCreed has known about Jakub, and vice versa. Ethan is the center of both their world. But as the book continues, you get the sense that Jakub would spoil and care for Creed as well.\n\nI loved how the three of these wonderful characters held each other up. I liked how vastly different they are, but gel so well when they are together. The chemistry between Ethan and Creed is strong and fierce, between Ethan and Jakub it‚Äôs loving and a power exchange. And even between Creed and Jakub there is a tentative relationship growing. I loved how understanding Jakub was with Ethan. A long distance secret relationship couldn‚Äôt have been easy on them, but you get the intensity of their love for one another clearly coming across the pages.\n\nThen the sh!t hits the fan!! And the unthinkable happens!! It pops their bubble and has the potential to tear their worlds apart!! Can they really be together, or will the media/family and friends pull them apart?\n\nI loved this story. I also liked the explanation given in this book by the author. it‚Äôs a little heavy on the politics of gender and sexuality. But you can see where the author is going, they are her views, and I might not agree with everything, they are still out out there and not rammed down your throat.\n\nI adored Ethan and Creed‚Äôs teammates, and hope they all get a story üíú\n\nIf you like sports romance, MMM romance and a tangled love story then grab it now.\n\nü¶ã\n\nNovember 17, 2023\n\nThis book was a very strange read for me. I‚Äôm not sure if it was editing or timeline confusion but there were many times I had to stop and think ‚Äòwait, what?‚Äô\n\nEthan snd Creed are finally going to get together and they tell each other they love each other. Creed specifically says he‚Äôs loved Ethan for years. Later when Creed is feeling like the relationship may not work he‚Äôs upset because he knows he‚Äôs falling for Ethan and may already have fallen. ?? We already had love declarations 90 pgs in, why are we here again?\n\nE and C have also been BFF‚Äôs for YEARSSSSSSS! This is how it‚Äôs explained. But once they get together romantically they are talking as if they‚Äôve just met.\n\n‚ÄúWhat about you? Siblings?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm an only child.\n\nReally, this hasn‚Äôt come up in all the time you‚Äôve been joined at the hip as friends and teammates?\n\nThe amount of cameos that were in this book were overwhelming. Especially since these were not people from book 1 in this series but from other books the author has written. Way too many side plots that were never mentioned again or meaningless to the story.\n\nGiving the book 3 stars because even though I found this to be a head scratcher, I will come back for the next book just out of pure curiosity. I‚Äôm hoping to see Azure Danye again, the player that gave Ethan ‚Äòmurderer‚Äô vibes.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 23, 2024\n\nToo many characters to keep track of and too much explanation about mundane unrelated things.\n\nNovember 11, 2023\n\n4.5‚≠êÔ∏è\n\n3üå∂Ô∏è\n\nIloved this book! They way Crea writes poly is beautiful. Truly a love story. This book is based on hockey but it's not the main focus of the book. It plays a part as in friendships and the dynamic of these relationships play out but it's so much more than that.\n\nThis book is about honesty, transparency and trust. Jakub and Ethan and Creedence are so unique and different in who they are. How each of their relationships develop is special to each couple and as a throuple (or whatever they decide to call themselves) they are just magnetic.\n\nEthan loves to give up control\n\nJakub is the care taker, and one to lead mostly\n\nSweet Sweet Creed is a little of both and a perfect piece to Ethan and Jakub's puzzle.\n\nI will also say the team dynamics and support that Ethan and Creed get and than also Ethan is dream worthy. It's an ideal and one I hope can be true for all gay/poly athletes. With that said it is shown that not all fee that way nor had an easy time being gay and an athlete.\n\nThis book was a love story. With a little spice added in. But I will say I appreciated the sensation play that is often not read in books! I hope you read this because it was amazing in my opinion!\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nTo give credit where credit is due I really loved all 3 mmcs, usually I struggle with poly books because I pick favourites but this one I liked them all equally and thought they were a really cute throuple and everything worked out.\n\nBut aside from that this book was baaaad. The dialogue was really disjointed and the movie was not playing in my head because they spoke like really formal robots! Nobody says furthermore in real life. Then there were so many side characters and names and descriptions of people that were confusing and went nowhere. Like multiple page descriptions of made up social media sites, random celebs and only fans stars?! What was the reason?!!! I lost it at the ice castle with a hot tub let‚Äôs be for fucking real here üò≠üò≠\n\nNovember 16, 2023\n\nI've hit a point now with Crea Reitan's book where I don't actually read the blurbs anymore as I like the surprise of the story when I open this and this one was amazing. Ethan and Jakub have a secret relationship that they have kept private, and Ethan also has the hots for Creed. The first chapter of the story absolutely blew me away and kept me turning the pages all the way to the end. They talk about authors sucking you into a story, and this definitely did it for me.\n\nI really liked the dynamics of the characters, it shows a true open marriage where each side of the couple is trusting of their partner and there's no jealousy to be seen. It's a sweet story, with some pretty steamy scenes and I loved every minute of it. Will I be reading more in this series, I most certainly will and can't wait for book three to come out.\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nThis book is mostly about how to navigate other people‚Äôs reactions to the master characters relationship. There are fewer spicy scenes then I would likeüòÖ But the scenes that are in the book is very goodüî•\n\nüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nthis surprised me but in like a really good way. i'm kinda impressed ngl.\n\nNovember 11, 2023\n\nI enjoyed this once the trade happened, everything up to that point I skimmed. After the guys were all 3 together, I enjoyed it a ton more and was more invested in their relationship.\n\nJanuary 1, 2024\n\nIt's like I knew as soon as I met him that I was going to fall in love with this man.\n\nEthan and Credence became best friends while playing for the same professional hockey team. Being two out players meant they were never afraid of showing their affection for each other and their teammates were actually rooting for them to get together. Their friendship naturally progressed towards a deeper connection, but there was something stopping Ethan from taking things to the next level: Ethan is married to Jakub, another hockey player from a rival team. Their marriage, which was open from the start, has remained secret for the last seven years and nobody kew Jakub's not straight. With Jakub's blessing, Ethan and Creed get together and start exploring their feelings towards each other. But in the hockey world, nothing stays secret forever and a trade can happen so quickly...\n\nBecause the blurb seemed promising and because I loved Shiver so much, I had high expectations for this book. Unfortunately, it kinda missed the mark for me. It was still an entertaining read, but I wanted more. In my opinion, the story needed more work: some scenes with multiple characters were unnecessary and it was hard to keep track of who's who, especially since they didn't make another appearance in the book. There was also a good deal of social commentary in some scenes or internal monologue, which felt a bit preachy at times. Also, many important moments were told rather than shown (for example, Ethan and Jakub's Christmas celebration). For this reason, I didn't quite feel the passion between all three characters (outside of the many physical scenes, which were great).\n\nJune 14, 2024\n\nDnf at 33%\n\nThis was not for me i feel like the whole poly relationship was not equal between them. Also i would have liked to see Ethan and Creed‚Äôs first meeting with each other. This was way too instalove for me.\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\nI think this book made up for the first one in the series.\n\nWith the great number of hockey romances littering the book market lately, the same old tropes involving college and professional level hockey players has not only repetitively unoriginal, but also easily forgotten. Therefore, I was intrigued first by the blurbs for the first two installments in this series, and secondly by the fact that I really enjoyed the two other books I had read (and immediately purchased, as I could see myself repeatedly rereading them) by this author. Well, I didn't exactly enjoy the first one (sorry - the storyline was good, but its characters and situational scenes were too over the top for me), but Starting Line is a solid representation of all the strengths and talent this writer possesses. We are given the perspective of each of the three main characters (Ethan, Creed, & Jakub), of an unconventional love story between three equally compelling, captivating, extremely beautiful men who all play professional ice hockey really well. Their story begins with an erotic introduction to Ethan and Jakub, who have been secretly married for nearly eight years, weathering physical distance and proximity, playing on different teams, separated by hundreds of miles, and sustained by their deeply devoted love and commitment for and to each other, as well as maintaining open lines of communication and an equally honest, accepting open relationship that allowed for other partners either separately or when they were together.\n\nI thought I might be weirded out by Ethan falling in love with another man when he was married to and clearly very much in love with his husband; however, their story was written with so much emotive dialogue between all three, with the author bleeding compassion and love through every word on the pages, that I caught myself grinning at times, laughing out loud at others, unable to stop reading until them very final page. This book was a wonderful journey of discovery, moving from close friendship to falling in love (platonic with undercurrents of sexual attraction - very hot), and the satisfying comfort of camaraderie from a unique collection of teammates who had somehow managed to become a brotherhood, an extended family of returning making.\n\nThis story was written with flair, but maintained so much committed support, love, and fierce protectiveness, honor, pride and trust in an environment for a sport that usually didn't come together for players the way Ethan's and Creed's team and organization did for them. The entire team demonstrated solidarity and a united protectiveness that was so lovely I teared up, with only one player apparently objecting (whom Ethan didn't even remember the name of, and management immediately removed so our guys didn't have added stress over). I have to reiterate just how well this story was written. Truthfully, the focus was on the overwhelming, indisputable evidence and truth of the love and absolute devotion and commitment these three strong, talented, physically beautiful and formidable men at the height and apex of their careers had for each other. I kept thinking from around the fifth chapter that it was so obvious how the only player who could possibly rise to and complete their dream starting line was Jakub. Five beautiful stars.\n\nMay 25, 2024\n\nMMM\n\nObedience\n\nCaregiver\n\nSensation play\n\nVoyeurism/Exhibitionism\n\nCuckold\n\nVideo sex\n\nHigh emotion\n\nHEA\n\nLa primera vez que le√≠ una novela con una pareja que fuera poly desde el principio, que la relaci√≥n no empezaran al mismo tiempo. Me encanta la relaci√≥n de llevan Jakub y Ethan, la forma en que Jakub ama y cuida de su amante (que luego se traslada a Creed con igual intensidad) es muy hermoso. Claramente, no entiendo como puede ver como algo lindo el ver c√≥mo su esposo se enamora de su mejor amigo, pero como no son mis sentimientos, me encanta.\n\nAdem√°s, Ethan y Creed son la representaci√≥n de friends to lover que amooooo. Por tres a√±os tuvieron toda esta tensi√≥n sexual y amor que no pod√≠a suceder, pero era inevitable que terminaran juntos. Ethan es sunshine, aunque cuando se meten con las personas que ama, puede hacer el mundo arder. Creed es m√°s reservado e inseguro, pero tiene tanta confianza en Ethan que se deja mostrarse vulnerable. Al mismo tiempo, Ethan es sumiso por naturaleza, y le da el control a Creed en su vida sexual, a pesar de los roles invertidos. Tienen profundidad los personajes.\n\nAl principio pens√© que Jakub iba a estar en la periferia porque no ten√≠a muchos povs. Despu√©s, se hizo medio obvio que lo iban a pasar al equipo de Buffalo con ellos dos. Es un obvio bueno igual, yo quer√≠a que pasara, adem√°s que exist√≠a la posibilidad de que no pasara y se retirara del deporte, de igual manera iba a vivir con Ethan y la din√°mica iba a cambiar.\n\nLas interacciones de Jakub y Creed al principio eran awkward, osea, Creed es el novio del esposo de Jakub. Entrar en la din√°mica poly sin sentirse que estaba de m√°s le cost√≥ bastante. Pero Jakub y su naturaleza de cuidador y protector no dej√≥ que Creed se distanciara. Inevitablemente, de vuelta, no pudieron evitar enamorarse del otro. La fantas√≠a y el deseo de Ethan se hizo realidad.\n\nLo que hizo el management del equipo fue super sucio, sabiendo el esc√°ndalo que de pod√≠a armar, tradearon a Jakub con Ethan y Creed y todo se fue a la mierda con la sociedad y las redes sociales. A management le chup√≥ un huevo y medio que esas fueran sus vidas y trat√≥ de utilizarlas para poner una imagen inclusiva en su empresa. Si bien ellos tres no se dejaron manipular, los afect√≥ bastante.\n\nLas escapadas que tienen a distintos lugares son lo mejorrrrrrrrrr. Se aman tanto que es insoportable de la mejor manera.\n\nAlso y, por √∫ltimo, highlight a los compa√±eros de equipo que son lo m√°s.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nThis is a fantastically written story that gives a voice to an established couple who are happily in an open relationship, and then one partner falls in love with someone else but it is a happy and much loved occasion. What brings the drama is that all three men are hockey players in the NHL, where people are only just used to and accepting of having open gay players, let alone ones in a committed polyamorous relationship.\n\nEthan and Jakub may be in a long distance marriage for most of the year with their teams being on opposite sides of the country but that doesn't stop their love shining through their conversations and actions. I love the openness and honesty that they have, clearly what allows them to have an open relationship that full of trust. Ethan's friendship with his teammate, Creed, is something that many have seen budding into so much more but it would mean a big change for all involved but especially Creed who has never considered being in a triad relationship before. Jakub has seen the emotion developing on Ethan's part and just wants his partner happy but can also see how they would fit together. Creed needs time to adjust to the idea and then presence of Jakub being there, as a part of the relationship he has with Ethan but Jakub is such a sweetheart that you can't help but be drawn to him.\n\nThe drama comes in the form of the media and how they portray what they see as a very negative thing. First that two hockey players in a marriage was secret and then add in the poly aspect and they jump on attacking these men who, up until this point, where much beloved players who could do no wrong. They are blessed with hugely supportive teammates and coaching team but it, of course, mainly falls onto their shoulders which is a huge emotional burden.\n\nI found this to be a fantastically written story, both from the relationship side and the the team's as they have a really strong bond of friendship among them all. I definitely want to go back and read the first of the series and look forward to more from this author.\n\nI received an ARC and am happily giving a review.\n\n**This is the best thing that's ever happened to me. More than hockey. Or financial security. Over success. The love and support I have from men who want me just as I am? This is everything beautiful and I'm going to hate seeing others comment on it negatively.**\n\nNovember 16, 2023\n\nDee's Grade: A\n\nKink:üö¶üö¶üö¶/5\n\nSpice: ü•µü•µü•µ/5\n\nAngst: ü•πü•πü•π/5\n\nHumor: ü§£ü§£ü§£/5\n\nToxicity: ‚ò£Ô∏è/5\n\nBullying: üíî/5\n\nIntimacy: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•/5\n\nChemistry: üåãüåãüåãüåãüåã/5\n\nDirty Talking: ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨/5\n\nHurt/Comfort: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π/5\n\nCodependency: ü´Çü´Çü´Ç/5\n\nProtectiveness: ü™¶ü™¶ü™¶ü™¶/5\n\nPossessiveness: ‚öîÔ∏è/5\n\nCommunication: üó£üó£üó£üó£üó£/5\n\nThe Dark Matter: üåíüåí/5\n\nThe Swoon Factor: ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†/5\n\nGrowth and Healing: ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥.5/5\n\nComfort Readability: ü§óü§óü§óü§óü§ó/5\n\n** If the score is ONE EMOJI that means little to none of whatever category/trope was present in the book.\n\nStarting Line is a refreshing take on a polygamous relationship. From the opening of the book we see that Jakub and Ethan have a hot and heavy long distance relationship full of love and open communication. It was sexy to read.\n\nThen we get to see Ethan and Creed interact. We witness their affection and strong connection that we learn has been developing for three years.\n\nEthan is hesitant to shift his relationship with Creed from platonic to romantic. Even though he's in an open relationship, he's never been involved with another partner on a deeper level. Creed is his best friend and he's in love with his partner.\n\nJakub is the caretaker in the dynamic and all he wants is Ethan to have everything he desires so he encourages him to take the leap. What I loved about Jakub is he had zero expectations about him having a relationship with Creed. He only cared about Ethan and Creed being able to explore their love.\n\nThis a great book with all of the obstacles and drama coming from outside of the relationship which is founded on communication and respect.\n\nThat is actually my only complaint about the book. Crea wrote such interesting characters within a loving dynamic that I wanted more of them. I wanted more time seeing them settling into the life they were building together. Here's hoping we get to see more of them in the future.\n\nDefinitely read this book! You don't have to read book 1 first but you should just because it's awesome.\n\nJanuary 5, 2024\n\nI debated between 2-3 stars on this one. I liked the main characters and their dynamic in this book! I didn't feel like it dragged that much, and the love and support Jakub, Ethan, and Creed had for one another was really nice. But I also had some issues, like why isn't Jakub even named in the synopsis? I was honestly surprised when we got his POV since at first it didn't even seem like he was going to be a narrator even with this being a poly book. And the confusion didn't stop there. There were so many names of teammates and names of other teams' players being thrown around the entire book, and while unique names are cool and fun, when literally every single character being mentioned has one there's no way to keep track of who's who. There was also randomly way too much detail on the oddly named social media/OnlyFans websites?? ShareIt and ReachMe....why. Is there a reason why can't we at least still use instagram/twitter in this world? It felt like I was missing something. And the scene with the onlyfans stars, why did we get a whole education of the different types of accounts and stars etc?? This plus getting too much info on all these side characters felt like it was setting up for a sequel but I would still have no idea who exactly we were supposed to be focusing on. The whole thing with Creed's cousin and the online videos was also so random and never really addressed again, as was his agent!! Why was there a couple mentions of Creed's agent being useless and not reaching out at all while he's going through a scandal, and they talked about how he should get a new one...someone who literally supports LGBTQ+ athletes...and then absolutely nothing happened about it?? Ethan, Jakub, and Creed's happy ending is wrapped up in a pretty bow wit all of them happy to commit to each other forever which is lovely, but it felt like there were so many random things thrown in this book with a few loose ends left unanswered.\n\nDecember 7, 2023\n\nThis is a very beautiful, romantic, steamy albeit unconventional story and I believe that was exactly the goal of Crea: to show just how incredibly difficult yet fulfilling and wonderful a unique relationship can be even if it is not set up by society‚Äôs rules.\n\nCharismatic star athlete Ethan and his best friend Creed play on the same hockey team. Creed has been adoring Ethan for years but the two never crossed the line of true friendship. Creed is also one of the very few people who knows about Ethan‚Äôs long-time secret marriage to rival hockey player Jakub. While their long-distance open marriage works really well and both Jakub and Ethan had several quick hookups throughout the years, Ethan never touched Creed, fearing he feels a lot more than just a passing sexual need towards his teammate. Ethan finally gives into Jakub‚Äôs urging and gets ready to explore just how deep his connection runs towards Creed when a management decision creates a storm in and outside of their private lives. I loved this story and while there are parts when the information becomes almost too much, it shines the light on the struggles gay public figures encounter daily, how they are judged for unconventional domestic arrangements, and how it affects their professional lives. The absolute adoration these three men had towards each other was beyond amazing and their sexual chemistry was melting me. Crea's writing is beautiful, I was caught up in the emotions and I couldn't get enough of these guys exploring each other. It was a journey for them to solidify their roles and get to their HEA, and I‚Äôm so glad I was able to witness it.\n\nMMM\n\nFound Family\n\nCuckold\n\nNo cheating\n\nVarious Kinks\n\nSteamy\n\nPlease check the author‚Äôs note for sensitive content!\n\nI was fortunate to have received a copy of this book from the author, and this is my honest review.\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nüå∂üå∂üå∂üå∂\n\n-‚ÄúFaster.‚Äù\n\nI groan, my back arching slightly as I stroke my dick.

Look at you. So needy for me.‚Äù-\n\nThese are the very first sentences of Starting Line, and they set the tone of the book. There is spice from the very first sentence, and the chemistry between these characters is visceral.üî•\n\nEthan and Jakob are pro hockey players in a very loving yet secret marriage. It's been seven years, and no one has any idea. In fact, the general knowledge is that Jacob is straight. Their marriage is open, which means they both do random hookups until Credence(Creed) joins Ethan's team and it's love at first sight for both of them. Ethan and Creed have a very public love affair and are the darlings of gay hockey until Jacob is traded to their team. Normally, this is where the author would turn somebody into a villain, but they don't. Instead, the guys develop a very loving and supportive relationship while paparazzi wage warfare on them. It turns out that Jakob is a caretaker with a super romantic side. I definitely need more Jakob in my life üíò Their team rallies behind them and supports them 100%.\n\nThis is a great book.\n\nNice and spicy üå∂üå∂üå∂üå∂/5 chilis on the spicy scale. With a HEA and an epilogue that hints of things to come. There are a few characters that I hope get their own book, Isaac, in particular.\n\nI read this one, and I highly recommend it.\n\nIt's 3 POVs, first person.
