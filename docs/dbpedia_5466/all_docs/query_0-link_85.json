        "text": "All Marine Corps Marathon Weekend participants are required to attend Packet Pick-up, located within the MCM Health & Fitness Expo, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, to obtain the official bib with timing device and technical competitor shirt. Runners are required to bring the e-Card and a photo ID to Packet Pick-up. E-Cards are emailed to all participants in the weeks prior to the event.\n\nRunners are highly encouraged to pick up their own materials and verify personal information.\n\nFor runners unable to attend Packet Pick-up, proxy pick-up is an available option. Runners may designate an individual to obtain their bib and event materials. The individual picking up the bib for a registered runner must present a hard or digital copy of the completed e-Card with a copy of the runner’s photo ID, as well as a copy of his/her ID. Please be sure to obtain the runner’s preferred shirt size. E-Cards are emailed to the registered runner before the event. Parents may sign waiver and retrieve packets for their children under 18 years of age.\n\nPacket Pick-up is not available on event morning.\n\nThe official MCM, MCM50K and MCM10K participant bibs feature the timing device attached to the reverse side of the bib. These must remain in place for proper timing to occur.\n\nEmergency medical and contact information form is also on the back of the bib. All participants must complete this information.\n\nThe UPS Baggage Sticker will be attached to the reverse side of every bib. The sticker features the runner’s bib number and the assigned UPS truck to be utilized for baggage drop off and pick up on event day. Carefully peel the front of the sticker off the backing and attached to the clear plastic bag to facilitate easy identification by UPS volunteers.\n\nTrack a Runner\n\nRelatives, friends, running buddies and even MCM participants themselves can follow a runner’s progress along the course in real time. The virtual status reports will provide updates for one or multiple runners from various split locations and the finish line.\n\nThe timing data may be delivered by text, posted on a Facebook timeline, sent via email and/or sent over Twitter feed. During registration for this service, individuals may select the preferred means to receive updates. Registration for Track a Runner will be available soon."
