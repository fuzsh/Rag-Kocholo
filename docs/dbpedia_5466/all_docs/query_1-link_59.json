This is part of our joint commitment with WWF Germany for a more sustainable marathon. Together with you, we can do a lot of good and preserve and reclaim areas worthy of nature conservation.\n\nBefore you start with the registration, we would like to ask you to take 2-3 minutes of time to protect your health by completing our non-binding and free health check.\n\nRegular physical activity has a positive effect on your health. However, sport is no guarantee for a risk-free state of health. Familial risk factors, but also lifestyle-related risks are not always in direct correlation with your training condition and should be known in advance. Therefore, please be honest with yourself when answering the questions.\n\nWith the PAPS test, we want to help you become aware of your own state of health—there are no consequences for your eligibility to participate. The recommendation at the end of the test is made available to you for your personal and voluntary further use. The PAPS test does not replace a visit to the doctor and cannot provide 100% certainty of an existing or emerging risk. The collected, non-personalized data will not be handed over to the organiser. The data may be used in anonymised and encrypted form for scientific purposes by the Medical Board of SCC EVENTS."
