        "text": "DAY PRIOR TO DEBARKATION\n\nThe Debarkation Talk is held in the morning, the day prior to debarkation (or last sea day), starring none other than your Cruise Director in the main show lounge. We record this presentation to play on channel 15 of your stateroom TV. The Debarkation Talk will provide detailed information for guests on the following topics.\n\nSail & Sign Accounts\n\nCustoms Declarations\n\nDigital Debarkation System for North America Cruises:\n\nAn overview of the two debarkation options: Carry Off Luggage (Self-Assist) and Checked Luggage (Zone Numbers)\n\nSpecial groups (Faster to the Fun guests, Platinum and Diamond guests, Suite guests)\n\nEarly flights\n\nSpecial Assistance\n\nBack-to-Back guests\n\nLiquor collection\n\nGangway location and flow\n\nGuest Satisfaction Survey\n\nDetailed review of debarkation flyer that highlights key logistical information\n\nA fun Farewell Parade consisting of crew, staff and officers\n\nCasino: Cash out any casino chips or slips as the Casino Cashier Desk is closed on debarkation morning.\n\nSail & Sign Account: Your statement will be printed at midnight and delivered to your stateroom. Any purchases made after midnight will be added to your total owed. You may check your statement on our Sail & Sign Kiosks, on your TV or the HUB App.\n\nIf you registered your Sail & Sign account with a credit/debit card, your account will still be active on the morning of debarkation. For credit card accounts, billing is submitted to the your credit card company. Your bank places a hold on all onboard purchases. Even though your account will be settled with us, it is up to your bank to release any holds and it may take 3-5 days or more.\n\nFor cash accounts, if you have exceeded the amount of your cash deposit, you must pay the outstanding balance at Guest Services by the last evening of the cruise so you can disembark the ship without any delay. Any refundable overages greater than $10 USD will be refunded via check mailed within 7 days after the cruise to your home address on file. Overages less than $10 USD will be donated to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital (excluding Australia ships). If you wish to have the full overage in cash, you may retrieve it from one of the Sail & Sign Kiosks or Guest Services.\n\nLiquor Purchases: For cruise durations 6 days and more, liquor purchased from the gift shop or from ashore that was held for safekeeping will be delivered to your stateroom after 7:00pm, the evening prior to debarkation (some exceptions may apply). For cruise durations 5 days and less, liquor will be available for collection in a designated lounge on the morning of debarkation. Guests cruising back-to-back will collect all items at the end of the 2nd cruise.\n\nDigital Debark - Debarkation Options\n\nDigital Debark is our debarkation procedure using the Carnival Hub app, in order to help streamline the process and minimize crowds while still giving guests plenty of options for how they choose to leave the ship at the end of their cruise vacation.\n\nBefore 1:00pm on the last day of the cruise, log into the HUB app and navigate to the last day of 'My Planner', accessible via the main menu, and select 'Schedule Debarkation'.\n\nYou will be guided to select your preferred debarkation option: 'Express Debarkation' or 'Checked Luggage'. Then select all members of your party and select a suitable time for you and your party to debark the ship.\n\nIf you choose 'Checked Luggage', select the number of tags you require (one tag per bag). Luggage tags will be delivered to your stateroom the last day of the cruise.\n\nOnce you have completed 'Schedule Debarkation', the confirmation will remain available in your planner. Upon arrival to the home port, listen to the Cruise Director's announcements and follow the debarkation notifications coming through on your HUB app.\n\nOption 1: Express Debarkation - Carry Off Your Luggage (Self-Assist)\n\nIf you would like to disembark early and are able to carry your own luggage off the ship, this option is for you. This option is a great for anyone with an early flight back home.\n\nYou do not need to put your luggage outside of your cabin the last evening of your cruise. Keep all your belongings with you and on the last morning of the cruise, you will be among the first to debark the ship, as soon as the vessel has cleared immigration and debarkation can begin. Please know that in addition to carrying off your own bags, there may be escalators, stairs, and lines to contend with.\n\nOption 2: Checked Luggage\n\nNew luggage tags will be delivered to your stateroom the last day of the cruise.\n\nAll original Carnival luggage tags need to be removed.\n\nEach tag needs to be filled out and attached to every piece of luggage.\n\nThe tear-off section needs to be kept as reference.\n\nPlace your tagged, packed luggage outside of your stateroom the last night of the cruise between 8:00pm and 10:00pm.\n\nDo not pack medicine or other important documents in your luggage. Ensure you keep out your Sail & Sign Card, proof of citizenship and photo ID.\n\nMake sure you leave out an outfit for the last day. In the morning.\n\nYour luggage will be collected by our staff and placed into a secure area on board for offloading upon arrival in the morning.\n\nYou will be called to the gangway by the scheduled time you selected.\n\nYour luggage will be waiting for you in the baggage claim area of the terminal building, separated by zone number.\n\nYou must personally locate your luggage and either carry it out or seek the assistance of a porter. The customary tip is $1 USD per bag.\n\nGuests at the Diamond and Platinum levels of the VIFP program who have earned priority debarkation as a perk will not be impacted, as their top level luggage tags will be delivered to their staterooms without the need to select any digital option. The same goes for guests who have purchased Faster to the Fun or who are staying in suites, which also include priority debarkation as a benefit.\n\nGuests requiring wheelchair assistance or are not traveling with an able-bodied companion, should select through the HUB app 'Checked Luggage' debarkation, then select the option 'someone in my party requires assistance'.\n\nGuests who are taking an optional transfer that includes a shore excursion will receive detailed instructions.\n\nBack-to-Back guests will receive detailed instructions during the cruise advising how they will be processed on Debarkation day.\n\nGuests who prefer not to use the Carnival Hub app can still visit the display set up near Guest Services to choose their luggage tags in person.\n\nTaking Care of Business\n\nSail & Sign Cash Account: If not done so alreadly, please settle any outstanding account balances with Guest Services before 8:00am so you can disembark without delay.\n\nDebarkation Morning Purchases: You may use your Sail & Sign card or personal credit card for purchases.\n\nLiquor Purchases: For cruise durations 5 days and less, liquor will be available for collection in a designated lounge on the morning of debarkation. Guests cruising back-to-back will collect all items at the end of the 2nd cruise.\n\nThe Photo Gallery is open for last minute purchases until 8:30am.\n\nCarnival airport transportation tickets are available for purchase on the Carnival HUB App or at the Carnival Adventures or Guest Services desks until arrival.\n\nWaiting for Departure\n\nWe kindly ask that you vacate your stateroom before 8:30am. Please double check and make sure you have removed all valuables from your stateroom safe as well as personal items from closets and drawers.\n\nYou may enjoy one last breakfast or relax with a cup of coffee.\n\nThe main dining room serves breakfast 6:30am-8:00am (open seating)\n\nThe lido restaurant serves breakfast 6:00am-9:00am\n\nPromenade Cafe (JavaBlue) is open 6:00am-9:00am\n\nYou will need to select a location on the ship while waiting to be called for departure. Each ship will provide a list of designated areas (lounges and outdoor space) for guests to wait; in the interest of safety, guests should not wait in the stairwells or lobby area.\n\nOnce the ship has cleared Immigrations and debarkation starts, Carry off guests will be among the first to to be alerted via notification through the app that they can leave the ship. Guests will proceed to the gangway with their luggage.\n\nOnce carry off guests are off the ship, a notification will be sent through the app to alert guests that their luggage is ready and they can leave the ship. Luggage will not be available in the terminal until the specific group has been called.\n\nGuests who require special assistance will disembark with their luggage when their group is called through the HUB app notifications and will be escorted off the ship into the baggage claim area. Unfortunately, due to port regulation, wheelchair escorts are not allowed to assist with the handling or collection of luggage at the terminal building.\n\nGuests who have pre-purchased a shore excursion that includes return transfers to the airport will meet in a designated area and guided to the gangway as a group.\n\nWe generally clear the ship of all guests approximately three hours after the published arrival time in the home port.\n\nDebarking the Ship\n\nPrior to leaving the ship, guests will need to have in hand:\n\nSail & Sign card\n\nU.S Citizens will need Travel Documentation (passport, birth certificate and photo I.D, etc)\n\nNon-U.S Citizens will need Travel Documentation (passport) and required forms and documentation required by U.S Immigrations.\n\nIn order to 'check out' of the ship's security system, each guest will need to present their Sail & Sign card as they leave the ship.\n\nU.S Customs Border and Protection (CPB) Interview: After leaving the ship, U.S Citizens and Non-U.S Citizens will show CPB officers their travel documentation. Note: Depending on the home port, the process for Non-U.S Citizens may be conducted on board immediately following the ship’s arrival at the terminal.\n\nIn nine U.S homeports, guests debarking the ship at the end of a closed loop cruise will pause at a kiosk with a camera and take a photo. Within seconds, the image is biometrically compared to their passport or visa photo to verify the guest’s identity. U.S travelers and select foreign nationals who prefer to opt out of the facial biometric process can simply request a manual document check from a CBP Officer.\n\nThe U.S homeports using this secure, streamlined technology, include Miami, Port Canaveral, Tampa, Jacksonville, New York, Baltimore, Mobile, Galveston and Long Beach.\n\nBaggage Claim: Guests will proceed to the baggage claim area of the cruise terminal. Please wait for your zone number to be called otherwise you luggage will not be available in the terminal. Luggage will be grouped by zone number for easy location. Guests should double check to ensure they have claimed their own luggage as well as all of their bags.\n\nAll confiscated items will be returned to guests in the terminal by the shoreside security upon debarking the vessel.\n\nU.S Customs Border and Protection (CPB) Luggage Inspection: Prior to exiting the cruise terminal, guests will proceed to the CBP area - this is a formal but brief check of luggage and an oral declaration of merchandise purchased.\n\nTransportation Back Home:\n\nGuests who have purchased our optional transfers must proceed to the buses outside the cruise terminal with their luggage for transportation to the airport.\n\nTaxis and other alternative transportation services will be located outside the cruise terminal.\n\nGuests who purchased shore excursions must ensure their luggage is on the same bus on which they are traveling.\n\nDamaged, Lost Luggage, or Luggage Left on the Ship or Cruise Terminal - check here"
