        "text": "New in 2024! Invite-only registration begins on March 8. How it works:\n\nAll those who register for the AJC Peachtree Road Race receive an exclusive \"invite link\" in their confirmation email.\n\nThis link can be shared with friends and family to register for the race. When they click on this link, the need to choose the INVITE EXCLUSIVE option during registration.\n\nThe more people who use your exclusive invite-only link to register, the more chances you have to win prizes - FREE adidas shoes, a VIP Peachtree experience, AND MORE! The invite link has the lowest price for nonmembers, but that price will only last from March 8 to March 14.

A list of official qualifying events can be found here.\n\nView the 2024 start wave standards here.\n\nAtlanta Track Club members are guaranteed start wave placement A-M! Not a member? Become one here, and then register for the Peachtree to guarantee an earlier start wave placement.\n\nYes, all times submitted for start wave placement will be verified by Atlanta Track Club. If your time is not correct, cannot be verified or you do not submit a time, members will be placed in waves K - M, while non-members will be be randomly placed in waves U-Y.\n\nYour name in registration must match your name in the results that you submit for verification.\n\nThere are two options to receive your race number. There is no event day number pick up. All numbers must be obtained prior to July 4.\n\nOption 1: Race Number Delivery by UPS\n\nRace number delivery by UPS may be purchased for an additional $22.50 fee during registration or by managing your booking. If you choose this option, $22.50 will be added to your registration fee and your race number will be shipped in June.

Shipping fees are non-refundable.\n\nClick here to enter your booking confirmation ID\n\nClick Manage\n\nUnder Making Changes click Purchase or view add-ons\n\nAdd UPS Number Mailing to your basket and check out\n\nOption 2: Picking up your race number at the Expo\n\nIf race number delivery by UPS is not purchased, your second option is to receive your race number at the Expo for no additional cost. Participants must attend the Peachtree Road Race Health & Fitness Expo presented by Publix on July 2 or 3 at the Georgia World Congress Center.\n\nIn the case we are shipping the following items to you, please notify us of your address change as stated below:\n\nRace Number Delivery by UPS\n\nIf you purchased Race Number Delivery by UPS and your shipping address changes, it is your responsibility to notify questions&commat;atlantatrackclub.org by May 10.

Registration is also not refundable unless you purchased Refundable Registration.\n\nWhat is Refundable Registration?\n\nDuring the registration process, participants have the opportunity to add Refundable Registration offered by Protect Group. To secure Refundable Registration, an additional service fee of 14% on all items purchased (excluding event processing fees and donations) will be assessed at checkout. If you are unable to attend the event for one of the covered reasons, Refundable Registration enables a participant to receive a 100% refund of their entry fee and product purchases within 10 business days of submitting a claim. Read more about it here.\n\nYes. Become a member today for an earlier start wave at the Peachtree and access to the post-race member party sponsored by SweetWater Brewing. Membership doesn't stop at the Peachtree, because you'll also receive discounts to all Atlanta Track Club events, deals and discounts from our partners, an adidas member T-shirt and free races as part of the Grand Prix Series presented by Summit Coffee.\n\nHow it works? Join with the same name and email you used for your Peachtree registration and we will be able to identify you as a member and reassign your wave on June 26. While your bib won't have the member information on it, the wave will be correct and you can stop by the membership booth at the Peachtree Health and Fitness Expo presented by Publix to get your new member wristband for the post-race party or pick it up outside Park Tavern on race day with ID. Please note that we are in the process of assigning waves and your wave may not be assigned yet.\n\nYou can also take advantage of the \"members-only\" hour at the Expo. Since your check-in pass will not have your membership on it, you can let the volunteer know that you recently joined to access the early hour.\n\nIf you and someone you wish to participate with are assigned to different Start Waves, you can always move back to join the same wave together. However, advancing to a different wave is not allowed. For example, if you are in Wave H and your friend is in Wave L, you may join them in Wave L, but they cannot start in Wave H.\n\nYes, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Peachtree Road Race is a timed event. All event participants will receive a MyLaps timing tag attached to their race numbers. The tag is activated when you cross the start line mat and stops timing when you cross over the finish line mat. For accurate timing, wear your bib on the front of your shirt and do not cover it under any layers such as a fuel belt. If you do not cross the timing mats at the start, you will be disqualified and removed from the results.\n\nRace photos are handled by MarathonFoto. You will receive an e-mail with a link to pictures of you after the event.\n\nFor those participants who purchase the photo package during registration: You can expect to receive a photo confirmation email from MarathonFoto typically within 24 hours of the race. Participants should allow 24-48 hours post-race for image upload and the identification process to complete, and then refer to their photo confirmation email to access the link to download their photos. Once on the order confirmation page, you will see a red DOWNLOAD IMAGES access link to download photos at no additional cost to the participant.\n\nPlease note: Sometimes, these emails can end up in your spam folders. We encourage participants to check their span folders for their photo confirmation email if they cannot find it.\n\nFor those participants who have not purchased photos before July 4 but would like access to their photos for purchase: You can search for your photos by bib number or last name either on Marathonfoto.com, or through the event specific photo link provided to the race (coming at a later date). You will also receive an email from MarathonFoto typically within 48 hours of the race with a direct link to your personalized photo gallery for purchase.\n\nGeneral questions: If any participants have questions regarding Marathonfoto photos, please visit the customer service help desk here for assistance.\n\nAll registrations are non-transferable and nondeferrable. Registration is also not refundable unless you purchase Refundable Registration.\n\nWhat is Refundable Registration?\n\nDuring the registration process, participants have the opportunity to add Refundable Registration offered from Protect Group. To secure Refundable Registration, an additional service fee of 14% on all items purchased (excluding event processing fees and donations) will be assessed at checkout.

Be sure not to stop suddenly or veer into the paths of other runners. If you are running with friends, run no more than two abreast. Doing this will keep foot traffic on the course moving smoothly."
