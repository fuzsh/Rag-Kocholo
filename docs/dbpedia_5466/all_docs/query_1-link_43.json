        "text": "When is the 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon?\n\nThe 46th running of the Bank of America Chicago Marathon will take place on Sunday, October 13, 2024.\n\nWhat are my options if I sign up and can’t participate?\n\nRegistered participants will have the opportunity to cancel their entry and access a guaranteed entry for the next event. All event fees (entry, ancillary products, etc.) are non-refundable and will not be applied to future participation. Participants who select this option must complete the 2025 application process and pay the 2025 entry fee to redeem their guaranteed entry. Please note, this opportunity will not be available to participants who received a guaranteed entry through the charity or tour group applications.\n\nIndividuals will also have the option to purchase refundable booking during the application process.\n\nLearn more about the options available to registered participants if they choose not to participate.\n\nAre participants required to pick-up their race materials in person?\n\nYes. All participants are required to pick up their own participant packet (bib number and timing device) at the Abbott Health & Fitness Expo during the scheduled hours of operation. All participants are required to show a government-issued photo ID that reflects the name they registered under upon picking up their own participant packet.\n\nDoes the Bank of America Chicago Marathon have a recommended training plan? Yes. The Bank of America Chicago Marathon offers an official 18-week training program developed by Nike Coaches. The program is made to be adaptive to all runners and customized to fit in with your daily schedule and needs. For more information and to download the program, please visit the Training & nutrition page.\n\nDoes the event offer race day hospitality?\n\nThe event offers race day hospitality at the Skyline Hospitality Tent. Tickets for the tent are now available online. Additional hospitality offerings, including Pre-Race Participant Fast Track and the East Side Viewing Area, are available in the Marathon Store.\n\nYom Kippur falls on Bank of America Chicago Marathon weekend in 2024. Are there accommodations available for participants who observe Yom Kippur?\n\nThe 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon is scheduled to take place the day following Yom Kippur. We recognize this may impact some individuals’ travel or plans to participate and, as we have done previously, we’re working closely with the Chicago Jewish community to identify opportunities for individuals to observe the holiday and take part in the event if they so choose. Additional information on these opportunities will be available in the months leading up to the event.\n\nWhen will future runnings of the Bank of America Chicago Marathon take place?\n\nTo create consistency and predictability for community members impacted by the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, the Chicago Marathon takes place on the second Sunday of October. View anticipated dates for future runnings of the Chicago Marathon. Please note that these dates are subject to change.\n\nWhat is the difference between a guaranteed entry and a non-guaranteed entry?\n\nA guaranteed entry ensures you a spot in the field for the 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon, provided that you agree to the terms of that entry (Charity Program, International Tour Program) or that you qualify for that entry (Chicago Marathon Legacy Finisher, Time Qualifier, Bank of America Chicago Distance Series, 2023 Cancelled entry, American Development Program or Para Athletics Program).\n\nA non-guaranteed entry is subject to a selection through a drawing.\n\nWhat are the application deadlines?\n\nTuesday, October 17 at 10 a.m. (S. Central Time): Applications for the guaranteed and non-guaranteed entry paths open.\n\nThursday, November 16 at 2 p.m. (U.S. Central Time): Guaranteed and non-guaranteed entry applications will close.\n\nThursday, December 7: Non-guaranteed entry applicants will be notified via email of their entry status throughout the day on Thursday, December 7.\n\nLearn more about the different application paths.\n\nWhat is the entry fee for the 2024 race?\n\nThe entry fee* reflects the cost and the resources required to stage a world-class marathon. Every dollar that is collected through registration is invested back into the event to help cover these expenses and to enhance the overall participant experience.\n\nU.S. residents (those who live in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories): $240 (USD)\n\nNon-U.S. residents: $250 (USD)\n\nApplicants must provide credit card information as a part of the application process. The entry fee is processed automatically when an application is approved or selected through the drawing. When completing the application please use a credit card that has an expiration date of December 2023 or later.\n\n*A processing fee is applied to all entry fees.\n\nWhy is a processing fee applied to the entry fee at the point of registration?\n\nThe processing fee included at the point of registration is charged by the registration service for providing its software and services. This processing fee is non-refundable in all circumstances.\n\nI identify as non-binary. Will I be able to select non-binary as a gender option when registering?\n\nYes. The event introduced the opportunity for applicants to register as a non-binary participant during the 2022 application process. Discussions are ongoing with non-binary athletes to ensure we’re creating an inclusive event experience. We invite you to share your feedback with our team at office@chicagomarathon.com.\n\nI’m hesitant to sign up just under a year before the 2024 event. Will there be opportunities to sign up closer to the event date?\n\nIndividuals who are interested in signing up closer to the event may do so by running and fundraising on behalf of a charity. Each charity manages its own unique charity team, participant benefits and fundraising requirements. While fundraising requirements may vary from charity to charity, participants are required to raise no less than $1,250 (USD) if the entry is claimed during the application window (Tuesday, October 17 to Thursday, November 16) and $1,750 (USD) if the entry is claimed following the application window (Friday, November 17 to Thursday, September 12, 2024). Charity program entries are available on a first-come first-served basis until Thursday, September 12, 2024 or when the charity has reached its capacity, whichever comes first.\n\nWhat happens if my friend or family member gets selected and I don’t?\n\nThe person who did not receive an entry through the drawing has the opportunity to access a guaranteed entry by running with a charity in the event’s official Charity or International Tour Programs.\n\nWhat are the requirements of running for charity at the 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon?\n\nEach charity manages its own unique charity team, participant benefits and fundraising requirements. While fundraising requirements may vary from charity to charity, participants are required to raise no less than $1,250 (USD) if the entry is claimed during the application window (Tuesday, October 17 to Thursday, November 16) and $1,750 (USD) if the entry is claimed following the application window (Friday, November 17 to Thursday, September 12, 2024). Charity program entries are available on a first-come first-served basis until Thursday, September 12, 2024 or when the charity has reached its capacity, whichever comes first. Those interested in participating for charity should directly contact the charity of their choice with any questions.

Those interested in joining an international tour group should directly contact the tour partner of their choice with any questions. More information on this application will be available soon. Please note, this application closed on Sunday, August 18, 2024.\n\nI completed the charity or tour group application/registration and no longer want to run with a charity or tour group. What do I do?\n\nPlease contact your charity team or tour group coordinator directly for additional information.\n\nI want to run for a charity but I don’t see them listed on the website?\n\nOnly charities that are a part of our official Charity Program have access to guaranteed entries. Individuals selected through the drawing or those utilizing a guaranteed entry are welcome to run on behalf of any organization or cause.\n\nI would like my charity or tour group to be a part of one of the event’s official programs. How can I get more information?\n\nFor more information on the official Charity Program and International Tour Program email eventpartnerrelations@cemevent.com.\n\nHow were the Time Qualifier standards determined?\n\nTime Qualifier standards are based, in part, on the number of participants who have historically met the qualifying standards for the Bank of America Chicago Marathon’s fastest start corrals, as well as the need to arrive at a number of likely registrants that can be managed for the 2024 Chicago Marathon.\n\nThe standards introduced for non-binary applicants are inclusive of the qualifying times for the two previously existing divisions. Applicants can expect standards to adjust in the coming years as data becomes available to help inform future qualifying times. Discussions with non-binary athletes are ongoing, with the goal of creating more inclusive event experiences.\n\nWhat documentation is needed to prove qualification for this entry path?\n\nApplicants must submit results records for a marathon completed during the qualifying window (January 1, 2022 to November 16, 2023). The results documentation must include a finish time completed within the qualifying time standards and division (men, women or non-binary).\n\nFinish times at race distances other than a marathon will not be considered.\n\nA verifiable time is one run on a course certified by USA Track & Field (USATF), World Athletics or a similar governing association; considerations will not be made for non-certified races, weather or course conditions.\n\nCan those who narrowly missed the qualifying time, or who ran a comparable time at a different distance (e.g. half marathon, 50K, etc.), or who ran a qualifying time prior to January 1, 2022, be considered for guaranteed entry as a Time Qualifier?\n\nNo. Exceptions to qualifying times, distances and dates will not be made.\n\nCan those who run a qualifying time after the application window register as a Time Qualifier?\n\nNo. All time qualifiers must register during the application window.\n\nWhat constitutes a verifiable time for guaranteed entry as a Time Qualifier?\n\nA marathon time run on a course certified by USA Track & Field (USATF), World Athletics, or similar governing association on or after January 1, 2022. Proof must be submitted in the form of an official finisher certificate or official results page. Exceptions/considerations will not be made for non-certified events, weather or course conditions, or for any race distance other than a full marathon.\n\nI participated in the 2020 Bank of America Chicago Marathon Virtual Experience. Will my participation count towards the legacy or time qualifier entry application?\n\nNo. The Virtual Experience results listing will not be incorporated into the official Bank of America Chicago Marathon results and cannot be used as a qualifying time for other events.\n\nWill past Bank of America Chicago Marathon finishers be given preference to register for the 2024 Chicago Marathon?\n\nYes. Those who have completed five or more Chicago Marathons within the last 10 years may register for the 2024 Chicago Marathon with a guaranteed entry. Beyond this consideration, past Chicago Marathon finishers have the same registration options as all other interested individuals.\n\nWill the Time Qualifier standards change for 2025?\n\nYes. Updated Time Qualifier standards have been announced for the 2025 Bank of America Chicago Marathon.\n\nIs it possible that the event might sell out through the issuance of guaranteed entries, thus negating the drawing?\n\nNo. The guaranteed entry application paths are in place to supplement the non-guaranteed drawing, not replace it. The allotment of charity and tour group entries is managed in a manner to maintain the diversity of the participant field and the equity of the entry process.\n\nIs there a fee to apply for the non-guaranteed entry drawing?\n\nThere is no fee to apply for an entry.\n\nIs there a limit to the number of people that can apply for a non-guaranteed entry?\n\nNo. The application will remain open for entry until application deadline.\n\nHow many entries will be available through the non-guaranteed entry drawing?\n\nWe don’t know at this time, as that number will depend on the total number of people who register with a guaranteed entry by the application deadline.\n\nHow many entries are allotted to charities and tour groups?\n\nThere is not a specific allotment of entries for charities or tour groups. Rather, the registration process for these groups has been designed to help them achieve the same number of participants they have had in past years, and to allow for slight, incremental growth.\n\nIs there an advantage to applying for the drawing earlier versus later?\n\nNo. The time at which someone applies for the drawing will have no bearing on their chances of selection.\n\nWhen/how will I know if I’ve been selected through the non-guaranteed entry drawing?\n\nApplicants will be notified via email of their entry status on Thursday, December 7. If an applicant receives an entry through the drawing, the entry fee is automatically processed. Individuals who apply for, but do not receive an entry through the drawing, may still register by opting to run for select official charities or tour groups.\n\nCan someone apply for the non-guaranteed entry drawing multiple times to increase their chances of selection?\n\nNo. Prior to selection, duplicate entries will be removed from the system and therefore will not increase one’s chances of selection.\n\nWhat happens if I enter the non-guaranteed entry drawing multiple times and get selected more than once?\n\nDuplicate entries will be removed from the system prior to the drawing.\n\nIf I’m not selected to receive an entry is there still a way I can participate in the 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon?\n\nYes. Individuals who apply for, but do not receive an entry through the drawing may still register by opting to run for select official charities or tour groups.\n\nWhat are my options if I sign up and can’t participate?\n\nRegistered participants who are unable to participate in the 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon can cancel their entry through Wednesday, October 9, 2024 via their participant account. All event fees (entry, ancillary products, etc.) are non-refundable and will not be applied to future participation. Participants who select this option must complete the 2025 application process and pay the 2025 entry fee to redeem their guaranteed entry. It’s important to note that once an entry is cancelled the process cannot be undone.\n\nThis opportunity is not available to participants who received a guaranteed entry through the charity or tour group applications.\n\nI am injured and/or cannot run the event (family commitment, work obligation, etc.). Can I get a refund, donate my entry or transfer my entry to someone else?\n\nNo. Per our event rules: Sale and/or transfer of race entries/bib numbers is strictly prohibited and will result in the disqualification and/or banning of any individuals involved from future events. All entry fees are non-refundable.\n\nAre there cancellation options for participants who are or recently have been pregnant?\n\nWe have put into place an exception to our standard event policies to permit deferral for participants who need to cancel their registration due to being pregnant, recently pregnant or postpartum. Click here for more information on the pregnancy and postpartum policy.\n\nAre there any exceptions at all? If I provide medical documentation for my surgery, injury, etc., can I receive a refund?\n\nThere are no exceptions to the event rules.\n\nI cancelled my entry, but something changed and now I’m able to participate. Can I undo my decision to cancel my entry?\n\nNo. Once you cancel your 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon entry it cannot be undone. Registered participants have until Wednesday, October 9, 2024, to complete the individual cancellation process. We encourage you to complete the process when you are confident you can no longer participate in the 2024 event.\n\nWhat are my options if race organizers cancel the event?\n\nIf it is determined, for reasons outside of the event’s control, that the 2024 Bank of America Chicago Marathon cannot take place, registered participants will have the option to receive a partial refund for their 2024 entry or the opportunity to defer their place to the 2025 event and receive a discount on their 2025 entry fee.\n\nLearn more about the options available to registered participants in the event of a race cancellation.\n\nWhy does the event not allow participants to defer their place and entry fee?\n\nOur current policy in the event of a cancellation considers a participant’s financial commitment to the event, as well as the cost and the resources required to stage a world-class marathon. Every dollar that is collected through registration is invested back into the event to help cover these expenses and to enhance the overall experience for our participants. Planning and financial commitment for each year’s event begins well in advance of the application window for the next event.\n\nLearn more about the options available to registered participants in the event of a race cancellation.\n\nWhat is refundable registration and who is it available to?\n\nIndividuals who are concerned they may not be able to participate in the 2024 event can pay an additional service fee (16% of all items purchased, excluding event processing fees) for a 100% refund of the entry fee and additional products paid by the participant during the registration process. Registered participants, who purchased refundable registration, and are unable to participate in the race (for one of the wide range of perils covered) must apply to receive a 100% refund of their entry fee and ancillary purchases. An update on the application should be received within 10 business days of the application submission. Please note, refundable registration is not eligible to participants whose entry will be paid for by a charity, tour or sponsor partner.\n\nLearn more about the options available to registered participants if they choose not to participate.\n\nWho is eligible to purchase refundable registration?\n\nRefundable registration is available to individuals who paid for their entry and/or additional products during the registration process. Please note, refundable registration is not available to individuals whose entry will be paid for by a charity, tour or sponsor partner.\n\nWhen can I purchase refundable registration?\n\nThe option to purchase refundable registration is only available during the application/registration process.\n\nIf event organizers cancel the event would I receive a refund on my refundable registration purchase?\n\nNo. In the event of a cancellation by the event, the additional service fee associated with refundable registration would not be refunded.\n\nI purchased refundable registration. When can I apply for a refund?\n\nIf you purchased refundable registration you can start your application for your refund any time leading up to the event and you have until 60 days following the event to submit your claim. In the event of illness/injury please note, refund applications where the conditions are unpredictable and the event is more than two months in the future will not be approved.\n\nHow long does it take to complete the refundable registration refund application form?\n\nThe online refund application can take 5-10 minutes if you have all evidence required for your claim prepared. While you have the ability to start the form, save your progress and submit your relevant evidence into the form at a later date, we encourage you to have all required evidence ready before starting the application process.\n\nWhat is my booking reference number?\n\nYour booking reference can be found in the products section of your registration confirmation email. You will see REFUNDABLE REGISTRATION REFERENCE NUMBER followed by your alpha-numeric booking reference. Please note that this is a different number than your event registration number.\n\nWhy do I need to submit my bank account information when completing my application?\n\nProtect Group only provides refunds via bank transfer as the event’s registration provider does not share payment details from your original registration. You will need to ensure the home country of your bank and the bank account information requested on the refund application form are accurate. Entering the information incorrectly may impact the ability to receive a refund if your application is approved.\n\nIf approved, how long does it take to receive my refund?\n\nOnce you have fully submitted your refund application form and included all required evidence, the Customer Experience team from Protect Group will review your application within 24 hours.
