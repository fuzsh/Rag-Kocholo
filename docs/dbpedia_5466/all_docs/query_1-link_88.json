Practice results from single-best laps:\n\nJosef Newgarden 234.052 mph\n\nFelix Rosenqvist 233.485\n\nPato O'Ward 233.465\n\nAlexander Rossi 233.155\n\nKyle Kirkwood 232.896\n\nKyle Larson 232.845\n\nScott McLaughlin 232.817\n\nTakuma Sato 232.715\n\nRyan Hunter-Reay 232.211\n\nSantino Ferrucci 232.068\n\nWill Power 231.990\n\nRinus VeeKay, did not practice\n\nPicking Up Speed\n\n(12:45 p.m. UPDATE): Kyle Larson jumped from the ninth-best four-lap average to sixth-best at 232.091 mph with roughly 15 minutes left of Fast 12 practice.\n\nJosef Newgarden's 233.707 mph four-lap average leads the Fast 12 drivers in their one and only hour-long practice ahead of 3:05 p.m.'s top-12 qualifications.\n\nHalfway Through Fast 12 Practice\n\n(12:30 p.m. UPDATE): We're halfway through Fast 12 practice, which ends at 1 p.m. and Kyle Larson is currently eighth-fastest with a lap of 232.341 mph.\n\nReigning Indy 500 champion Josef Newgarden leads all drivers at 234.052 mph. Felix Rosenqvist, Pato O'OWard, Alexander Rossi, Kyle Kirkwood, Scott McLaughlin, Takuma Sato, Larson, Ryan Hunter-Reay, Santino Ferrucci and Will Power are the top-11 with 30 minutes remaining of practice. Rinus VeeKay has not timed.\n\nLarson also had to evoke some of his dirt-track racing prowess to catch a slide with his Chevy-Dallara No. 17 Hendrickcars.com Arrow McLaren race machine.\n\nSetting The Stage\n\n(12 p.m. UPDATE): Team Penske's Will Power, Scott McLaughlin and Josef Newgarden topped Saturday's Indianapolis 500 qualifications in that order while Larson turned the sixth-fastest speed of the day despite a plenum event that foiled his morning qualifying run and forced him to work his magic in the heat of the afternoon day.\n\nIndy 500 Qualifying Results: Kyle Larson Advances To Sunday's Fast 12\n\nDoes Larson have a real chance to land on the front row — or perhaps the pole? — of the legendary event? Race strategist Brian Campe says it's game on.\n\n“Now it’s, what’s possible? With a bit of handwaving on temperatures and scenarios, I think we have a shot at a front-row start tomorrow,” Campe told FloRacing after Saturday's momentous qualifying run. “We should approach tomorrow with that in mind.”\n\nLarson will be up against a diverse and stout crop of NTT INDYCAR Series drivers in the Fast 12: The powerful Team Penske trio of 2018 Indy 500 champ Power, McLaughlin and reigning Indy 500 champ Newgarden; 2016 Indy 500 winner and teammate Alexander Rossi; McLaren teammate Pato O'Ward; fan favorite Santino Ferrucci; Japan's beloved two-time Indy 500 winner Takuma Sato; qualifying ace Rinus Veekay; 2012 Indy 500 winner and former INDYCAR champ Ryan Hunter-Reay; and Sweden's own Felix Rosenqvist.\n\nRELATED: Why Kyle Larson Needed A Second Indy 500 Qualifying Run On Saturday\n\nShould Larson replicate Saturday's superb qualifying run — advancing into the Fast 6 starts at 5:25 p.m. — it'll create quite the evening schedule for him as he has to be in North Wilkesboro, N.C., before 8 p.m.'s NASCAR Cup All-Star Race at North Wilkesboro Speedway. The Fast 6, meanwhile, ends at 5:55 p.m.\n\n“I think that’s great. It’s just really cool,\" Larson said of the vying for the Indy 500 pole after Saturday's run. \"It makes the windows a lot tighter for tomorrow.\n\nHe laughed, then continued.\n\n\"It’s something to be proud of for sure on my part, but qualifying is about the team,\" he added. \"They brought a fast race car. Proud of everybody’s effort.”\n\n2024 Indianapolis 500 Coverage\n\nIndianapolis 500 Schedule And How To Watch\n\nHere's The 2024 Indianapolis 500 Entry List\n\nWho Has Won The Indy 500 In Back-To-Back Years?\n\nWhat Is The Indianapolis 500 And Coca-Cola 600 Double?\n\nBack-To-Back Indy 500 Winners\n\nKyle Larson Indy 500 Coverage\n\nWhy Kyle Larson Needed A Second Indy 500 Qualifying Run On Saturday\n\nIndy 500 Qualifying Results: Kyle Larson Advances To Sunday's Fast 12\n\nBreaking Down Kyle Larson's Fast Friday & Indy 500 Qualifying Draw\n\nKyle Larson 'Back On Track' During Indy 500 Fast Friday\n\nEngine Change Slows Kyle Larson's Indy 500 Thursday Practice\n\nHow Tony Kanaan Is Coaching Kyle Larson At The Indy 500\n\nKyle Larson Makes 'Huge Progress' During Wednesday's Indy 500 Practice\n\nKyle Larson 'Not Too Stressed' About Lost Indy 500 Practice Time\n\nKyle Larson Recaps Rain-Shortened Indy 500 Opening Practice\n\nKyle Larson Breaks Down Latest IndyCar Test Ahead Of Indy 500 Debut\n\n2024 Indianapolis 500 Sunday Schedule\n\n(All times Eastern Standard Time)\n\n8:30 a.m. — INDYCAR Ministry\n\n10:00-10:15 a.m. — Track sweep\n\n10:45-11:30 a.m. — Enlistment ceremony\n\n12:00 p.m. — Peacock broadcast goes live\n\n12:00-1:00 p.m. — Fast 12 practice\n\n1:00-2:00 p.m. — Last Chance qualifying practice\n\n2:00 p.m. — Intermission; qualifying technical inspection\n\n3:00-6:00 p.m. — NBC broadcast goes live\n\n3:05-4:05 p.m. — Fast 12 qualifying\n\n4:15-5:15 p..m.— Last Chance qualifying\n\n5:25-5:55 p.m. — Fast 6 qualifying\n\nPole Award Presentation\n\nFront Row Press Conference\n\n6:15 p.m. — Race day pit selection\n\nINDYCAR teams move pits to race day location"
