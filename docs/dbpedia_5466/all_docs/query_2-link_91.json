The process often takes about 10 minutes.\n\nDuring this process, the account provider (Login.gov or ID.me) will ask you to provide certain personal information and identification (ID). This process helps us make sure that the person creating your account is really you—and not someone pretending to be you. It’s a lot like the process for setting up a bank account.\n\nIdentity verification is not about whether we trust that you’re who you say you are. It’s about protecting you from scammers who may try to set up an account in your name to access your information and benefits.\n\nAfter you verify your identity, you won’t have to do it again for that account unless you lose access to your account’s multifactor authentication method or need to recreate your account. In the future, we may ask you to help us reverify your identity once every several years for added protection.\n\nWe know that uploading a photo of your ID for verification can sometimes be difficult.

Then you can follow the instructions to enter the code and complete the process.\n\nYou’ll need a computer or tablet with an internet connection to verify your identity.\n\nLearn more about verifying your identity on the ID.me website\n\nCommon questions about multifactor authentication\n\nMultifactor authentication is an extra layer of protection on your sign-in account. It helps us make sure that it’s you trying to use your account—and not someone pretending to be you. It’s also called 2-factor authentication or MFA.\n\nEach time you sign in to a VA website or app, you’ll use multifactor authentication to confirm you’re you. You’ll do this using a device that only you should have, such as your mobile phone.\n\nYou’ll get a unique code through a method of your choice. Options may include an app like Google Authenticator, security key, text message, phone call, or backup codes. You’ll enter the code to use your account. Login.gov may offer other options like face or touch unlock for signing in securely and privately.\n\nThis way, even if someone were to guess or steal your username and password, they can’t access your account.\n\nPlay our video on multifactor authentication (YouTube)\n\nLearn about MFA methods on the Login.gov website\n\nLearn about MFA methods on the ID.me website\n\nIdentity verification and multifactor authentication work together to protect your identity and personal information:\n\nIdentity verification is a one-time process. You complete this process when you first set up your sign-in account. To verify your identity, you provide certain personal information and identification (ID). Identity verification helps us make sure only you can create your sign-in account—and no scammer can create one in your name.\n\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of protection that’s part of the process of signing in to use your account. When you first set up your account, you set up your choice of MFA method (like an authenticator app) on a device only you have access to. Then, you use that method to provide a specific code we send you each time you sign in. Multifactor authentication helps us make sure only you can use your sign-in account to access and manage your benefits and health care.\n\nThank you for your feedback."
