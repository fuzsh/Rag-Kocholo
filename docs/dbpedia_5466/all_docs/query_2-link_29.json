With the close partnership of the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, the High Line has transformed into a public space where every New Yorker and visitor is welcome and can experience the intersection of nature, art, and design. The High Line also facilitates a national learning community, called the High Line Network, for leaders of similar projects.\n\nWho is Friends of the High Line?\n\nFriends of the High Line, a nonprofit organization, oversees the public programming, public art, maintenance, and operations for the High Line. We raise nearly 100% of the High Line’s annual budget.\n\nWhat was the High Line used for?\n\nAs a freight rail line, the High Line was in operation from 1934 to 1980. It carried meat to the Meatpacking District, agricultural goods to the factories and warehouses of the industrial West Side, and mail to the Post Office.\n\nWho owns the High Line?\n\nThe High Line is owned by the City of New York and is under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. It was donated to the City by CSX Transportation, Inc.\n\nThe land beneath the High Line is owned in parcels by New York State, New York City, and more than 20 private property owners.\n\nOn the High Line\n\nIs the High Line wheelchair accessible?\n\nYes. The entire High Line is wheelchair accessible. Check out our Visitor Info page to learn more.\n\nWhy aren’t dogs allowed on the High Line?\n\nWe know many of our supporters are dog owners, and setting our “no dogs” rule was a tough decision. Ultimately, the rule is necessary because of the limited space in the park, the large number of visitors, and—most importantly—the health of the High Line’s landscape. The park’s planking system was designed to direct rainwater runoff toward the planting beds. This means that dog urine, which is highly acidic, would end up in the soil and damage the plants. We appreciate your understanding.\n\nWho can I ask for help while on the High Line?\n\nYou can spot our staff and volunteers, who wear t-shirts or other clothing with the High Line logo (and/or identification badges).\n\nAbout the park\n\nWhen did the High Line open to the public?\n\nThe High Line was constructed and opened in stages. The first section, from Gansevoort St. to 20th St., opened in June 2009. The park extended to 30th St. in 2011, and the High Line at the Rail Yards opened in 2014. The last section of the original High Line—the Spur at 30th Street and 10th Avenue—opened in spring 2019.\n\nWho designed the High Line?\n\nThe design team was selected in 2004 by Friends of the High Line and the City of New York: James Corner Field Operations (project lead), a landscape architecture firm; Diller Scofidio + Renfro, an architecture firm; and planting designer Piet Oudolf.\n\nHow is the High Line sustainable?\n\nThe High Line is inherently “green”—it re-purposes a piece of industrial infrastructure as public green space. As a landscape, the High Line also serves the function that a green roof would serve in the city, reducing the amount of storm-water that runs into the sewer system, because the park’s pathways allow water to drain into the adjacent planting beds. We at the High Line are committed to enhancing our sustainability in all operations and maintenance as well; read more on our Sustainable Practices page.\n\nHow do I…?\n\n… get involved with the High Line?\n\nEveryone in our community, and all New Yorkers, are warmly invited to engage with the High Line and be part of our daily operations. To stay informed, subscribe to our newsletter. We also invite you to learn more about becoming a volunteer. Most importantly: Consider becoming a member today—we rely on our members’ support!\n\n… hold a photo or film shoot on the High Line?\n\nLearn about film and photo shoots in the park.\n\nDiscrimination and harassment\n\nWe do not tolerate any discrimination against or harassment of our staff, volunteers, or visitors. It’s illegal to harass someone because of their race or national origin under New York City Human Rights Law. Approach a High Line staff member or call 311 to report harassment or discrimination to the New York City Commission on Human Rights."
