        "text": "Using professional-grade email marketing tools like Campaign Monitor, almost every part of your email marketing campaigns can be personalized, using tactics that range from the simple to the more advanced. We’ll cover each of these tactics so you can understand the realm of possibilities.\n\nIt’s entirely possible to start simple and then work your way toward more advanced tactics as you go along. The key is to use personalization in big and small ways to add value to your customers’ experiences.\n\nBasic Email Personalization Tactics\n\nMost marketers using basic personalization tactics are looking to do email newsletter-type marketing. They may not have the resources or bandwidth to focus on email personalization, but some basic tactics can help them get better results from their efforts and increase their engagement metrics.\n\n1. “From” name\n\nThe “from” name is one of the most prominently displayed elements of your campaign when it arrives in your subscriber’s inbox.\n\nOn many desktop and mobile clients, this field has a larger text and heavier font to help people quickly identify who the email is from before the recipient opens it.\n\nGiven its prominence, it’s unsurprising that 68% of Americans say they base their decision to open an email on the “from” name.\n\nTo appeal to these people and get more of them to open your campaigns, you can personalize the “from” name of your emails so that different subscribers see different names.\n\nA common use case for this is sending your marketing campaigns from the individual sales representative or account manager that is currently working with a particular account.\n\nDubsat does a good job of this in their promotional campaigns, dynamically changing the “from” name so that the email campaign appears to come from the account manager the client interacts with regularly.\n\nIf you’re a Campaign Monitor customer, you can do this easily using Personalization Tags.\n\nAs you create your campaign, you simply enter the Personalization Tag you wish to use in the “from” name area. Then, when you send your campaign, it will automatically be replaced by the information you have stored in your email list (i.e., the name of the sales representative who is working with the account).\n\n2. Subject line\n\nAfter the “from” name, the subject line is the second most prominent element in the inbox.\n\nOn most devices, the subject line has a darker, heavier text in an attempt to make it stand out among the other details of the email.\n\nGiven its prominence in the inbox, it’s inevitable that your chosen subject line will have a significant effect on open rates, and our research shows that using the recipient’s first name in the subject line can increase open rates by 26%.\n\nConverse does this well in their email campaigns, adding the subscriber’s first name to the subject line to help the campaign stand out in the inbox and get people to open.\n\nIf you’re a Campaign Monitor customer, you can do this using Personalization Tags.\n\nWhen writing your subject line, simply click the “Insert Personalization” button and you’ll see a list of the different Personalization Tags you can insert into your subject line. Then, when you send your campaign, it will automatically be replaced by the information you have stored in your email list (i.e., the first name of the subscriber.)\n\nMedium sophistication email personalization tactics\n\nMarketers that are utilizing medium sophistication personalization tactics are starting to develop deeper relationships with consumers, and are moving toward marketing that is more targeted and fosters even higher levels of engagement.\n\n1. Email content\n\nBeyond just the “from” name and subject line, there are also many ways in which you can personalize the body content of your email campaigns to make them more relevant to subscribers and increase the chance they’ll click through.\n\n2. Copy\n\nIf you have your subscriber’s first name, company, or even t-shirt size stored in your email list, then you can easily use that information to personalize the text in your email campaigns.\n\nThe most common example of this is adding a subscriber’s first name to the email, like this example from Sephora, who included the subscriber’s first name to address them more directly.\n\nWhile first name personalization may be the most common example, it is far from the only thing you can do.\n\nUsing custom fields, you can store any piece of information you choose on your subscribers (e.g., gender, t-shirt size, birthday, etc.) and then use it to personalize campaigns.\n\nDropbox does an excellent job of this, including the subscriber’s company name to take the personalization to a new level and increase the relevance of the email for the reader.\n\nIf you’re a Campaign Monitor customer, you can personalize your copy directly in the drag-and-drop email builder.\n\nSimply select the “Insert personalization” drop-down, and you’ll see all the different Personalization Tags available. When you send your campaign, the tags will be automatically replaced by the information you have stored in your email list (i.e., the first name of the subscriber.)\n\n3. Imagery\n\nBeyond just text, you can also dynamically change the images in your email marketing campaigns to better appeal to specific subscribers.\n\nUsing imagery is a powerful way of increasing your email click-through rate. In fact, in a recent campaign, we tested dynamically changing the images to match the subscriber’s location. We created different images for people in the UK, USA, and Australia and tested them against a generic version (with just one location-agnostic image) to see if personalized images worked better.\n\nBy making the images in our email campaign personalized to the subscriber’s location, we were able to increase our email click-through rate by 29%.\n\nIf you’re a Campaign Monitor customer, you can easily do this in the email builder. Simply select the images you wish to personalize, and then select the segment of your list you want it to show for (i.e., subscribers in Australia).\n\n4. Dynamic content offers\n\nSavvy brands are using demographic and geographic data to personalize the offers delivered to each consumer. You can dynamically change entire sections of content within your email to make the entire campaign more relevant and more appealing to subscribers.\n\nA common use case for this would be showing menswear to your male subscribers, while showing womenswear to female subscribers.\n\nAdidas did this in their email campaigns for the Originals series. By dynamically switching the products being promoted based on the subscriber’s gender, they ensured each subscriber saw the most relevant and appealing products that would entice them to make a purchase.\n\nIf you’re a Campaign Monitor customer, you can easily do this in the email builder. Simply select the section of content you wish to personalize, and then select the segment of your list you want it to show to (i.e., male subscribers).\n\n5. Re-engagement\n\nYou can use email marketing personalization and automation to encourage customers who have already engaged to come back.\n\nFor example, St. Jude Children’s Hospital automatically sends reminders to re-engage their past donors. They’ll automatically receive a message six months after donating to remind them of St. Jude Children’s Hospital’s impact that encourages them to donate again.\n\nTo re-engage inactive subscribers, you can send a re-engagement campaign asking them if they still want to hear from you. You can also send special promos, thank you notes, or actively ask them for their feedback. Remember, this should be a pull-out-all-the-stops, best content, best offer kind of email because this may be the last chance you have to impress your subscribers.\n\nSt. Jude powers these emails with data that they collect at the time a donation is made. That data is then fed into their email marketing and automation provider, making it effortless to power the related customer journeys that follow. By proactively sending a reminder email, St. Jude increases the likelihood that a donor will make a repeat contribution and stays top of mind with their audience.\n\nAdvanced Sophistication Email Personalization Tactics\n\nMarketers with specific use cases who may be utilizing customer journeys and automation, as well as other, more advanced tactics, can employ personalization techniques using data from other sources to create a highly personalized experience. They may be capturing data about consumers via their email service provider, CRM, e-commerce platform, website behavior, and other third-party applications.\n\nMarketers with this rich data can employ behavioral segmentation creating dynamic segments based on a consumer’s engagement with their brand via multiple channels.\n\nThis a game changer for more advanced marketers because it takes the constant, manual data management aspect out of email segmentation and personalization. It’s the foundation for a highly personalized strategy.\n\nRead on to learn about some use cases and examples of more advanced personalization tactics you can use to deliver highly relevant messages and experiences to your subscribers and customers.\n\n1. Product recommendations\n\nBy integrating a customer’s recent purchases or browsing history into their email marketing, marketers can leverage customer behavior to create relevant, engaging email campaigns that boost purchases through cross-selling and up-selling product recommendations that are merchandised to each unique recipient in your email list.\n\nRetailers and e-commerce sites can now easily create real-time, one-to-one targeted content that speaks right to the individual to create a long-term relationship and increase the lifetime value of that customer.\n\nConsider the following example. This portion of an order confirmation email from Nordstrom contains a section at the bottom that displays product recommendations based on items the customer viewed but didn’t buy:\n\nBrooklinen sends an email composed of images of the products the consumer recently browsed but did not purchase, reminding them that the sheets they looked at are still available with an easy call-to-action button. They even include a free shipping offer.\n\n2. VIP loyalty\n\nSephora, a cosmetics company, uses marketing automation to automatically send a series of special offers to their best customers once they’ve reached VIP status, which is triggered by a spending threshold.\n\nUsing automation, they take their customers on a personalized journey, tailored to each subscriber’s behavior. For instance, if a customer reaches VIP status, they receive a different email than a customer who doesn’t reach the spend threshold.\n\nSephora then continues that journey based on how the customer engages with each message. This kind of segmentation allows marketers to deliver the most relevant message to each subscriber, driving stronger engagement and revenue.\n\nYou can use integrations with systems like Shopify to leverage the powerful customer data to create targeted, timely email marketing campaigns.\n\n3. Purchase abandonment\n\nEvery online retailer and e-commerce company knows that, just because someone puts an item in their shopping cart, doesn’t mean they’ll purchase it. The digital shopping cart abandonment rate is 74.3% worldwide. That roughly translates to only 1 in 4 carts getting “checked out.”\n\nWhether the consumer had second thoughts, got distracted, or simply ran out of time, it’s nice to know that you can still try to get the customer to come back using email marketing and automation.\n\nFor example, by tracking their customers’ website behavior and tying that data into their email marketing platform, Birchbox can know when someone begins the checkout process but doesn’t complete it and abandons their purchase. When this happens, Birchbox automatically sends an email reminding them that they still have items in their cart. It encourages the customer to go back to the site to complete their purchase and includes images of the products left behind.\n\n4. Behavioral segmentation\n\nTravel company Flight Centre compiles data from their email, social properties, and back-end systems. With that data, Flight Centre creates highly targeted segments based on customer interests, behavior, and engagement with their marketing properties. Then, using those segments, Flight Centre triggers automated customer journeys with personalized vacation offers to promote higher bookings.\n\nFor example, here’s an email that showcases dynamic imagery for a particular persona (someone interested in cruises) with a personalized offering. This email features:\n\nPersonalized imagery and lead-in content\n\nA sense of urgency through the use of a deadline\n\nPersonalization: first name, consultant worked with in the past\n\nAfter implementing behavioral segmentation, Flight Centre saw a huge impact to their metrics.\n\nSaveSave"
