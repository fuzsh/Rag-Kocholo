Follow these easy steps to get to your destination.\n\n1. Get Ready: Plan Your Trip\n\nRiding Muni is easy. Make your trip even easier by planning ahead.\n\n2. Pay Your Fare: Use Easy Payment Options\n\nThere are many simple ways to buy your Muni fare. Want a discount? Use MuniMobile and Clipper to save $.25 per ride. (Seniors, students and people with disabilities get a $.10 discount.) Remember that proof of payment is required for all riders so keep it on hand your entire trip to avoid citations and fines. Kids ages 4 & under always ride for free. Use our products map to search places to locate where to buy your fare.\n\n3. All Aboard: Riding Muni\n\nAll set? When Muni arrives, wait until the vehicle comes to a complete stop and let others off before you board.\n\n4. You’ve Arrived\n\nWhen nearing your stop, pull the cable cord or push the button to let the operator know you want to get off.\n\nNote: Customers do not need to \"tag\" out of Muni Metro to exit. Fare gates have motion sensors and will open automatically. Simply walk through. This may be different from other transit services like BART and Caltrain, which do require customers to \"tag\" out.\n\nNeed help?"
