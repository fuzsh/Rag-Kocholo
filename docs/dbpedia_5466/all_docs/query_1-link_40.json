        "text": "The NASCAR Cup Series will take to the streets of Chicago on Sunday, but its not the only series ready for a second go around in the Windy City.\n\nFirst up is the Xfinity Series, which is set for The Loop 110 on Saturday afternoon. The race is set to air on NBC.\n\nBut before that, Xfinity qualifying got underway Saturday morning. Shane van Gisbergen, winner of last year's inaugural Cup Series race at the track, took the pole with a lap time of 1:29.448. Kyle Larson was just 0.013 seconds behind and will start second with Connor Mosack, Sam Mayer and John Hunter Nemechek rounding out the top five times.\n\nA total of 43 cars attempted to qualify for the 38-car field with Ty Dillon, Thomas Annunziata, Brad Perez, Alon Day and Kenko Miura failing to earn entry into the race. Several series favorites will drop to the rear after engine changes and practice crashes including Parker Kligerman, Nemechek and Justin Allgaier.\n\nCole Custer is the reigning winner of the event. Per usual, a few Cup Series regulars will participate in Saturday's Xfinity race including Ty Gibbs, Larson, Joey Logano and Daniel Suarez.\n\nHere's the starting lineup for The Loop 110 after Saturday's qualifying:\n\nOWN THE BOOK ON DAYTONA!
