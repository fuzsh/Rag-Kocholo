        "text": "Annika Langvad has done — and won — hundreds of bike races. She is a five-time marathon mountain bike world champion. A five-time Cape Epic champion. She has been the Danish national champion of road cycling, cyclocross, and mountain biking numerous times.\n\nIn 2016, Langvad won the XCO world title, and in 2018, she nearly swept the UCI World Cup short track series. In 2019, she was second at Strade Bianche.\n\nYet there is another result on Langvad’s palmares that is not like the others.\n\nIn 2015, the then 30-year-old Dane raced the Leadville Trail 100 MTB race in Leadville, Colorado. She hadn’t trained specifically for it, as her sights were set on cross-country World Cups and marathon world champs. Yet Langvad made her first and only Leadville count: she set a course record of 6:59:24, which still stands today.\n\nI spoke with Langvad ahead of this year’s race, which takes place on Saturday, August 10, to ask her about her race ‘above the clouds’ nine years ago, her opinion about separate women’s starts, and if we’ll see her racing gravel any time soon.\n\nWhen I say ‘Leadville,’ what is the first thing that comes to your mind?\n\nThe first thing that comes to my mind when you say ‘Leadville’ is memories of one of the most crazy and unique racing experiences of my life.\n\nWhat are your best memories from that race? Your worst?\n\nThe best memory from the race is definitely entering the finish line stretch knowing that I was going to win the race.\n\nI had been on my own for most of the race, just pacing myself and trying to go as hard as I could without blowing up in the very thin air. I really had no idea if I could hold it together all the way. Finding the right pace was such a gamble. I went out quite hard to create separation from the rest of the ladies and had no idea how my body would react to that, as well as racing around seven hours in quite unfamiliar altitude.\n\nI feel like I’ve told this story many times but crossing the finish line I was exhausted. Exhausted like I’ve never been in my life before or since. It’s hard to explain, but I really was so worn out that I just put my life in the hands of my team manager Kandice. She was the one who took over as I completely shut down. I could barely talk to my husband Thomas on the phone. Kandice assured him that she had me covered. And she did until I went to sleep that night.\n\nFor people that don’t know the race it’s hard to explain. The course is nothing spectacular but the race is one of a kind due to the low oxygen levels.\n\nHow did you set such a fast time in 2015? Did you have teammates? Did you work with men?\n\nQuite simply, I was in a really good shape when I set such a fast time in 2015. That was confirmed the following week, when I won my very first XCO World Cup. I did not do specific altitude training or acclimation leading up to the race, since Leadville weekend was right in the middle of three XCO World Cup races (which were important for my Olympic qualification), and it was simply not possible to not do with the World Cups. Instead I tried to stay as low as possible and only went up to Leadville one or two days before the race. I rode my normal XCO full suspension MTB (S-works Era), and the bike was set up completely for XCO racing.\n\nI raced the bike to a third place finish the week before at the Windham World Cup. I did wear a skinsuit and Evade helmet, though and did my best to be low on the bike on the open stretches. I could have worked much more on a Leadville-specific setup, but I didn’t. Who knows, I might have been able to set a faster time on an Epic World Cup or even a Crux, wearing aero socks, things like that.\n\nAs I recall, I was riding on my own for most of the race. Of course I rode with the men at the very beginning since we all started together in one big bunch. But I was not consistently drafting off of men. Most of the pictures I have from the race I also seem to be pretty much on my own.\n\nIf you’ve been following the Life Time Grand Prix or gravel racing lately, you are probably aware of the push to have separate start times for elite men and women. Life Time has adopted this format for the Grand Prix races, and at Leadville this year elite women will start 12.5 minutes before the amateurs.\n\nWhat do you think about this trend? Do you think it’s important for the sport?\n\nI have been following development in the gravel sport a bit on the sideline. I love to see how everything is growing. I also think that it’s a bit naive to not implement more rules to make it fair. But it seems like there’s sometimes so much money at stake, that riders don’t dare to protest and simply unite and stay away. Which would send a strong signal. So, really, the sport is in a funny place at the moment.\n\nI think it is absolutely crucial, that more race organizers implement separate start times for men and women. The next logical step is to ban drafting between categories. I know that it will require more of the organizers. But then again, it is possible. I rode Cape Epic many times, and the race went through the exact same development — from men and women starting all together with drafting allowed to no-drafting and separate starting times. And it worked out. The same rule applies to the UCI MTB Marathon races. There’s also this rule of ‘self regulation’ of sorts where you can protest if several riders have witnessed a competitor breaking the rules. Top teams would also be equipped with on-board lightweight action cameras for review of such situations. In UCI racing it’s even forbidden to have men racing on your wheel.\n\nEven with these rules it’s not always ideal. I’ve had to shout at many men to get them to back off. At Cape Epic everyone has their name on the number plate. I learned that if I addressed the men interfering with our racing by their name, they would often back off. As I see it there’s an already existing model that would be easy to implement. I don’t know why it hasn’t been fully implemented, but that’s a question for Life Time.\n\nDo you think the new start format will result in slower times for women at Leadville this year? Will it make your record harder to break?\n\nOn paper yes, but records are set to be broken. I can see that I was fast even without the race set-up and preparation in 2015. However, the women’s field is getting bigger and stronger. Just look at Unbound this year. I don’t think my record will stand long and will be cheering them on to crack it!\n\nSeparate start batches will naturally create a different race dynamic, so my guess is that my record will be harder to break per se, but like I said, the field is getting more competitive and it’s only a matter of time before the racing is so fast that they’ll beat by a substantial margin. Until gravel teams with time grow bigger, so that riders start to work together just like on the road. For now, the dynamic is still very much like mountain bike racing, everyone racing for themselves. But how cool would it be to see this development happen, teams racing against each other?\n\nAre you surprised your record has not been broken? Why or why not?\n\nI think it’s also a question of priorities. Back in 2015 I had not yet established myself as a XCO World Cup-winning rider. That came the week after Leadville. I think I became somewhat succesful at that also. But in all honesty, even if I hated being labelled as a ‘marathoner,’ endurance racing has always been a stronghold of mine. And I always responded well to that type of physical stress. So back in 2015 I had a high level and was doing Cape Epic, Marathon Worlds and Leadville. I guess it was a pretty good shot at the record. But yeah, I’m little surprised it has stood so long.\n\nIs there any gravel racing in your future?\n\nWell, I turned 40 this year and after many years of trying to become parents, my due date is next week. I raced some UCI Gravel World Series last year in between fertility treatments. I got second after Marianne Vos in Sweden and a win in Italy. I love the dynamic of gravel racing. The mix of raw strength from XCO and tactical skills like a road race is pure fun. Had it not been so difficult to become pregnant I would probably be all in gravel racing right now. I would love to give it a shot but have not made any promises or plans yet. Depending on how I feel after the pregnancy I will not rule out that you’ll see me at a start line of a big gravel race somewhere in the future."
