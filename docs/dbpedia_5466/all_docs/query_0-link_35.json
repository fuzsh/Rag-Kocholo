        "text": "For as long as I have been going to the Rolex 24 at Daytona to shoot photos, I have lusted after having a photo vest. After having one this year and looking back at my photos, it didn’t really change much.\n\n[Acura: First GTP win, third consecutive win at Daytona]\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, it is amazing to have the access to go beyond the fences and close to the track and into the hot pits, but the access that fans get still allows tons of great photo opportunities.\n\nWant to know the cheat code for getting great shots without a photo vest? Buy a lightweight folding step stool so you can shoot above the fences. (Also, wait for the good light.)\n\nHere’s one of my favorite trackside shots from the Rolex, and I was doing exactly that. I will admit you still need the right equipment–like a DSLR or mirrorless camera and a long lens–but it’s possible for any fan to get great shots.\n\nAnother tip: Get the pass with garage access. Then you’ll be able to get up close to the cars when mechanics are working on them, allowing any camera–even a cell phone–to get shots that tell a story.\n\nNighttime is the best time from my experience to shoot in the garages. This is when teams are thrashing to repair a mechanical failure or replace body panels after a crash.\n\nHowever, this is where you need to constantly pay attention to your surroundings because teams do not care that you are there to get a photo and will push you out of the way to get a car back on track, and the guys in the pit carts will run you over to deliver tires and fuel. Just remember to always be aware of your surroundings.\n\nAlso, with garage access you can get close to the pit areas from behind a fence. You won’t get to see pit stops, but you can see how the teams set up their pit boxes and how they work throughout the race.\n\nThe coolest place to shoot photos, in my opinion, is the tire-changing station. It is insane to see how quickly and efficiently teams can bring in used tires to get swapped out for new ones.\n\nDon’t underestimate the view from the grandstands. From that perspective, you can see almost anywhere on the track, and at night you can capture some stunning views. If you, like me, are afraid of heights, then stick to the lower levels as the upper seats are terrifying.\n\nUltimately, remember that you are there to have fun and enjoy the race. Spend some time just watching–not from behind the lens–and soak in the event. And when you find a good spot or a cool view, snap some photos and share them with friends.\n\nAs for me, I’ll still get the photo vest every chance I get, but I still cherish the images that I got and what I learned from shooting over the fence standing on a step stool.\n\nJoin Free Join our community to easily find more IMSA, Photography, Rolex 24 at Daytona, rolex 24, Race Photography and Automotive Photography articles.\n\nComments\n\nDisplaying 1-10 of 45 commentsView all comments on the GRM forums"
