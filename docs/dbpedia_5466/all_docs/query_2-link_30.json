        "text": "As TSA continues to integrate new technologies for a faster, easier travel experience, we've collaborated on several innovative digital identity initiatives, which work in place of a physical ID* or boarding pass. Be sure to follow the steps to set up and activate your selected digital identity solution before your trip so it's ready to present at select TSA checkpoints. Look for your preferred airline or device maker below to find out more!\n\nPrivacy and Facial Recognition Technology\n\nParticipation in TSA facial recognition technology is optional. All images and personal data are deleted after each transaction.* Images are not used for law enforcement, surveillance and not shared with other entities. Advise the officer if you do not want your photo taken. You will not lose your place in line.\n\n*Retention: Photos and biometrics are deleted upon completion of the identity verification transaction. During periodic testing and development, TSA and DHS Office of Science and Technology (S&T) may retain passenger data for up to 24 months. When testing with S&T, signage at the checkpoint will notify passengers of the extended retention period and will allow passengers to opt-out of the live photo.\n\nParticipation is Optional\n\nIf you choose to participate in TSA's use of these technologies, your picture will be taken and compared with your physical ID or digital ID using facial recognition technology. Your photo and biographic information will be deleted from these devices after your transaction.\n\nTo use a digital ID, add your state-issued eligible driver's license or identification card to your phone using a TSA-approved digital ID app or to your digital wallet.\n\nUse Your Eligible Digital ID at TSA Checkpoint\n\nScan your Digital ID QR code or tap your mobile device on the digital ID reader .\n\nA message on your mobile device will ask you to consent to share your digital ID information with TSA.\n\nOnce you consent, the camera will take your picture.\n\nFollow the officer's instructions.\n\nIf you decide to opt out of facial matching, notify the officer.*"
