        "text": "Article by Colette Nichol, Story Strategist and Solo Filmmaker\n\nIn this post we‚Äôre going to cover three simple rules of filmmaking that absolutely everyone needs to know: the 180-degree rule, 30% rule, and 20-degree rule.\n\nLearning these three rules of filmmaking is a great place to start if you‚Äôre an aspiring filmmaker or early-stage filmmaker.\n\nSimple Rules, Powerful Results\n\nIt‚Äôs 6:24 in the morning on a very weird day.\n\nA hummingbird buzzes around my geraniums then pokes her nose into the begonias and flits away.\n\nIn less than 10 seconds, my mood has been transformed from worried to delighted.\n\nAll because of something SIMPLE.\n\nIt works the same way in filmmaking.\n\nIt‚Äôs the simplest things that‚Äôll transform the quality of your work from so-so to professional.\n\nSo let‚Äôs look at three rules of filmmaking that‚Äôll change the way you think about setting up a shot. These three rules are powerful, yet simple:\n\n30-degree rule\n\n20% rule\n\n180-degree rule\n\nAs you can see, in filmmaking, we like to keep the names of our rules simple too.\n\nTable of contents\n\n30 Degree Rule for Planning Your Shot List\n\n20% Rule for Video Footage That You Can Edit Seamlessly\n\n180 Degree Rule in Filmmaking\n\n180 Degree Rule Breakdown\n\n30-Degree Rule for Planning Your Shot List\n\nThe 30-degree rule relates to the position of the camera from shot-to-shot.\n\nThis rule states that to cut from one shot to the next, you need to make a 30-degree change in the position of the camera.\n\nIf everything else in the shot remains the same i.e. the focal length, f/stop (or t-stop), shot size, and shot angle stay the same, you have two options.\n\nYou change the position of the camera by 30 degrees to create two separate shots that can be cut together seamlessly.\n\nYou go with a jump cut, which is an abrupt cut where the edit is NOT seamless. Be warned: using a jump cut will work in a music video or some brand videos, but it‚Äôs not going to fly in a romantic drama.\n\nMove your camera 30 degrees to get shots that‚Äôll cut together in your film.\n\nThis 30-degree rule is why you sometimes see weird shots of the side of a subject‚Äôs head in the middle of a front-facing interview. The Director of Photography (DP) has set up a second camera to catch the subject from the side.\n\n(I don‚Äôt recommend this option, by the way. There are much better options than filming the side of someone‚Äôs head in an interview!)\n\nThe 30-degree rule should also be considered a minimum, not a maximum.\n\nAt a bare minimum, you‚Äôll need to move the camera 30 degrees if you want Shot A to cut together with Shot B.\n\nBut again, this only applies if you‚Äôre not changing anything else. If you‚Äôre not changing the shot size, shot angle, f-stop, or focal length, then you MUST change the camera position. Unless, of course, you‚Äôre making a stylistic choice to use jump cuts.\n\nThis rule is related to the overall look of the shot.\n\nThis rule states that to cut from one shot to the next, there needs to be a 20% difference between the two shots.\n\nThis difference in shots could come from the following:\n\ncamera angle\n\nshot size or proximity to the subject\n\nfocal length of the lens\n\nf-stop/t-stop\n\nlighting and time of day\n\nIt could be a mix of a few different things that make one shot different from the previous shot.\n\nJust like the previous rule, 20% is considered a bare minimum.\n\nIf you want to make sure your shots can be cut together, aiming for a much more significant change is better. If you‚Äôre focusing on visual storytelling, you‚Äôll naturally have a much more significant change anyway.\n\nBut this is a good rule to remember if you‚Äôre not sure your shot list is going to give you cuttable footage.\n\nüåüRelated Post: Story Circle: 8-Step Storytelling Guide Based on the Hero‚Äôs Journey\n\nThese Shots Are More than 30% Different\n\nSo even though they are all filmed from the same camera position and angle, they would cut together seamlessly as long as the action matched up.\n\n180-Degree Rule in Filmmaking\n\nThis final rule is one that trips up almost every single newbie filmmaker.\n\nI‚Äôm not going to pretend it didn‚Äôt confuse the heck out of me a few years ago. It did. But, like riding a bicycle, once you get it, you can‚Äôt un-get it.\n\nThis rule is about the continuity of action.\n\nThe 180-degree rule states that there is a plane of action that the camera must not cross if you want to maintain the visual continuity of the scene.\n\nLet‚Äôs break this down with an example I got from Blaine Brown‚Äôs book on cinematography. I‚Äôm using my own words, but this is his example.\n\n180-Degree Rule Example\n\nYou‚Äôre watching a movie, and you see a scene with two people on the street in a wide shot.\n\nA car is driving across the screen, heading from right to left. In screen language, this means the car is heading WEST.\n\nThe woman is on the left side of the screen, on the north side of the street.\n\nThe man is on the right side of the screen, on the south side of the street.\n\nThe camera is behind the man. Probably on somebody‚Äôs lawn.\n\nOne more time:\n\nThe woman is on the left on one side of the car.\n\nThe man is on the right on the other side of the car.\n\nThe car is heading WEST.\n\nThe plane of action is the car. It‚Äôs the object that‚Äôs in directional motion.\n\nIf you jump across the plane of action‚Äîto the other side of the street‚Äî what happens?\n\nYou set up the camera, and now you‚Äôre filming the car from behind the woman.\n\nThink about it for a second‚Ä¶imagine the shot.\n\nWhat direction does the car move if you‚Äôre looking through your camera‚Äôs viewfinder?\n\nEverything will be reversed.\n\nThe car will be heading EAST.\n\nThe woman will be on the right.\n\nThe man will be on the left.\n\n180-Degree Rule Breakdown\n\nLook at the first image and imagine yourself crossing the street and setting up your camera on the other side.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nThat‚Äôs right‚Äîthe screen direction of the car is reversed. And your subjects are on the wrong sides of the screen!\n\nCross the Plane of Action at Your Own Risk\n\nIf you cross the plane of action in the middle of a scene without the use of continuous camera movement, you‚Äôll create a jump in reality that‚Äôll confuse the audience.\n\nYou can create camera movement by using a gimbal, steady-cam or dolly move to chart the motion across the plane. This continuous action would create visual continuity and prevent confusion.\n\nVisual continuity is necessary if you want to keep your audience inside the story.\n\nTypically there are only two times crossing the ‚ÄúLINE‚Äù or Plane of Action will work.\n\n1) If you do so with continuous motion\n\n2) You do it to show a change in perspective or point of view.\n\nImagine you‚Äôre in a wide two-shot with two people running towards the camera.\n\nYou jump behind them (which reverses their position) to show what they‚Äôre running towards. This works because the shot is entirely different, and you‚Äôre showing their point of view.\n\nUsually, where filmmakers get messed up is when they‚Äôre shooting a scene of two people talking, and they go in for over-the-shoulders medium shots.\n\nThey move the camera across the line and later discover in the editing room that their shots won‚Äôt cut together logically.\n\nThis is what happens when you ‚Äúcross the line.‚Äù\n\nIn the first image, the blue dino is on the left and the weeds are in front of them.\n\nThen the camera crossed to the other side to film them. Now the blue dino is on the right. He‚Äôs jumped from one side of the screen to the other.\n\nNot good! That‚Äôs confusing for the audience.\n\nIn this case, the plane of action is where the two dinos are standing.\n\nThis is what happens when you cross the line when shooting dialogue‚Ä¶\n\nOkay, look‚Ä¶all I‚Äôve got to demo this is two dinosaurs.\n\nSo it might not be the clearest.\n\nWhen filmmakers go to shoot an over-the-shoulders medium shot of one actor, they sometimes cross the plane of action by mistake. When they get to the edit suite they find that their actors aren‚Äôt on the same side of the screen anymore.\n\nWhen shooting over-the-shoulder shots, make sure you don‚Äôt jump to the other side of the actors.\n\nBut wait! You can cross the line sometimes‚Ä¶\n\nWith these three shots, we start behind the two dinos, looking out at the patio.\n\nThen we cross the line. We see what‚Äôs behind them. A hand! Oh no! (Notice the Dutch Angle.)\n\nThen we jump behind them again to see them getting snatched up.\n\nThese shots indicate a change in perspective and are wildly different, which is why they aren‚Äôt confusing.\n\n3 Simple Rules of Filmmaking\n\nThese three super simple rules will transform your footage and prevent editing nightmares from ruining your films.\n\nChange your camera position by a minimum of 30 degrees if you want your shots to cut together. Ensure your shots are a minimum of 20% different from each other to guarantee cuttability in the edit suite. And watch out for the plane of action. If you‚Äôre going to cross the plane of action, then make sure you‚Äôre doing so with continuous motion or to completely change the perspective of the scene.\n\nLet‚Äôs Talk Movie Magic\n\nA hummingbird beats its wings 70 times per second.\n\nThat‚Äôs why their wings always look blurry. Of course, it‚Äôs an illusion. Their wings aren‚Äôt actually blurry. But your eyes perceive them that way.\n\nIn a movie that‚Äôs shot at 24 frames-per-second, you see the image as one long continuous flow of motion. You don‚Äôt see 24 crisp and separate photos. 24 frames per second is the minimum your eyes need to create the illusion of a moving picture.\n\nThe world of filmmaking is full of rules that allow you to cultivate what some like to call movie magic.\n\nBut never forget the real purpose of these rules. What‚Äôs that? Following these rules allows you to wrap your audience up in the warm embrace of a story.\n\nIt‚Äôs your job to stop your audience from getting pulled out of your film because they‚Äôre distracted by technical flaws.\n\nIf you can keep them IN the story, you have a better chance of taking them on an emotional journey that matters.\n\nSue Monk Kidd, once wrote, ‚ÄúStories have to be told, or they die, and when they die, we can‚Äôt remember who we are or why we‚Äôre here.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôd like to add that stories have to be heard and felt, otherwise, we can‚Äôt remember who we are or why we‚Äôre here.\n\nRelated Filmmaking Articles\n\n‚û© How I Got Paid to Learn Documentary Filmmaking\n\n‚û© How to Capture Attention in the First 2 Seconds of a Video\n\n‚û© How To Get (Beautiful!)
