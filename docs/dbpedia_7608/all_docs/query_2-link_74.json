        "text": "It sounds like an improbable movie script–the only known copy of a very old silent movie is discovered by a carpenter in a barn in New Hampshire. But it’s true. The 1911 film starred Mary Pickford and her first husband, Owen Moore, a handsome alcoholic who was soon to be eclipsed by his wife’s fame and divorced for Douglas Fairbanks.\n\nThe Library of Congress has restored “Their First Misunderstanding.” The film is 10 minutes long–typical in that era before feature-length films were made. The first minute was missing, but the rest was in good condition, considering its age and where it had been stored for the past few decades. One film historian said that 90 percent of all films made before 1930 are gone, so this addition is a treasure. It seems that the barn was once part of a summer camp for boys, and the theory is that the film was something shown to the campers for entertainment.\n\nSee a clip: http://vimeo.com/74730666\n\nThe great Charlie Chaplin, actor, comedian, director, producer, screenwriter, composer, and businessman, died on December 25, 1977 at the age of 88. Born in England, he died in Switzerland. He lived in America for several decades (from the 1910s to the 1940s), during which time he became one of the most successful and richest film stars in history.\n\nOne of Chaplin’s closest friends was Douglas Fairbanks, who figures prominently in my Roaring Twenties, so of course, Chaplin makes some brief appearances as well. When sound came to the motion picture world, Chaplin, like most, was reluctant to embrace the new technology, and he held out longer than anyone, producing silent films into the 1930s. “I was determined to continue making silent films … I was a pantomimist and in that medium I was unique and, without false modesty, a master.” And a very handsome lad, don’t you think?\n\n“For a while Hollywood production codes dictated that actual drinking could not be shown on screen,” writes Daniel Okrent in his excellent book, Last Call. “So there was a lot of bottle pouring, glass holding, and back-to-the-camera chugging.” I read this and decided to work it into my next Roaring Twenties mystery. A minor detail, I know, but pretty good, don’t you think? He goes on, “A scholarly survey of 115 films released in 1929 established that drinking–virtually all of it illegal, of course–was depicted in 66 percent of them, more often than not favorably.”\n\nOkrent also points out that at first, many in Hollywood supported the ban on alcohol and welcomed Prohibition, thinking that by closing down saloons, people would flock to movie theaters for entertainment. Didn’t work out like that. But it’s another tidbit that will make my historic fiction more realistic.\n\nThe greatest silent film star of all, Mary Pickford, died on this day, May 29, thirty-four years ago. It would be nice to say she lived a long and happy life, but it wouldn’t be true. She did live a long life–at a time when infant mortality rates for white women born in North America predicted a life span of 51, she passed away at 87. But happy? Almost certainly not.\n\nFrom her earliest years, Gladys Smith, as she was christened, supported her family. Her father, an alcoholic, deserted and died a few years later. Her mother struggled to put food on the table and little Gladys went to work on stage at age seven. From then on, she was the breadwinner, and she developed a fierce work ethic that never quit. Moving from the stage to silent pictures, she became the first true “film star” with fans all over the world. She revolutionized the moving picture world, from acting style to production and her business sense was legendary. She made buckets of money, built a gorgeous home with an inground swimming pool, something unheard of in that day. She married three times, divorced twice. When sound came to the movies, she made the transition fairly well–she had been trained, after all, for the stage and knew how to use her voice, something most silent film actors did not understand. With all this success, why wouldn’t she be happy?\n\nRoles for mature women, then as now, were few and she never maintained the wild popularity of her early decades. The family curse of alcoholism claimed her, as it did her brother and sister. She couldn’t seem to find anything to do that would occupy her–no charity work, no social life, no business management, no films. Her beloved mother had died of breast cancer; her sister Lottie and brother Jack soon followed, dying of an excess of alcohol and drugs that claims so many Hollywood personalities. Her second husband Douglas Fairbanks (some say, the love of her life) died of a heart attack at 56. She very nearly destroyed all her films. She retreated into her lovely home, Pickfair, and almost never came out. By the time she died, few remembered her name or her films.\n\nI’ve given her a supporting role in my second and third mysteries. She is mentioned in the first, The Impersonator, as inspiration for my main character who, like Mary Pickford, grew up on stage and played child roles even as an adult. I think “Little Mary” would have liked the way I’ve portrayed her.\n\nPart of the fun of research is getting to talk to interesting people.\n\nAn old college friend put me in contact with Mr. Brooks Wachtel of Hollywood, a writer/producer/director who has written or produced many documentaries for the History Channel and over 85 episodes of dramatic television, shows such as Fox’s live-action Young Hercules, the animated PBS hit “Liberty’s Kids,” and lots of Saturday morning action shows: Heavy Gear, Static, Spider-Man, X-Men, Iron Man, Robo-Cop, Silver Surfer, The Avengers, Mortal Kombat, The Mask, Beast Machines: Transformers, Godzilla, Gargoyles, Wing Commander Academy. For younger viewers, he has penned many episodes of the pre-school hit, Clifford the Big Red Dog.\n\nThe reason I wanted to talk with him was to take advantage of his vast knowledge of film history. He gave me lots of information, some of which I’ll be incorporating into book #3 of the Roaring Twenties series, Renting Silence. Things like the sort of film used in the Twenties as orthochromatic was being replaced by the better, more expensive panchromatic, which gave a truer gray range. With orthochromatic film, props and things that were actually red would film very dar while blues would go lighter, so much so that blue-eyed people seemed to have white eyes. Not a good feature. This influenced the choice of costumes, props, and even actors, of course.\n\nAnd while I already knew that silent movies were very noisy to make, with grinding cameras, shouts from the director, ongoing conversations, music from the studio musicians who were “playing the mood,” and hammering from the adjacent stage, I did not know that some studios set up bleachers and charged admission, and those audiences could be quite noisy too. All in all, an interesting conversation with Mr. Wachtel.\n\nI enjoyed Laura Moriarty’s book, The Chaperone, a fictionalized story about the silent film star Louise Brooks (see the September 8 post for more about that.) But I was curious, as I am whenever I read historical fiction–how much of it was true?\n\nSo I got a copy of the memoirs of Louise Brooks, Lulu in Hollywood, published in 1974. Mary Louise Brooks was born in 1906 and died in 1985. Her memoirs cover her early years only superficially and that’s the part that The Chaperone covers. She mentions going to New York in 1922 to study at a famous dance studio, Denishawn, and that she was accompanied by a chaperone.\n\n[Mother] finally overcame his [Father] strong objection to sending a little fifteen-year-old girl away from her home alone by finding me a chaperon, Alice Mills, a stocky, bespectacled housewife of thirty-six who, having fallen idiotically in love with the beautiful Ted Shawn [owner of the dance studio] at first sight, decided to study dance with him. She agreed to accompany me on the train and live with me in New York. . . . Most of the students [in New York] were females from the Middle West, to which, like my chaperon, Alice Mills, they would return to establish Denishawn schools. . . . I tolerated Mrs. Mills’ provincialism because she shared my love of the theatre. Together, we saw all the Broadway shows . . .”\n\nAnd that’s about all Louise Brooks says of her chaperone. Using that little bit, Moriarty crafted a person with a different name. Moriarty’s character was thirty-six but not stocky, and she was not the least interested in Ted Shawn, the dance instructor, or in dance. She did enjoy theater. She found love in New York and returned home to Kansas at the end of the summer, but never established a dance school.\n\nHaving satisfied myself that The Chaperone was almost entirely fiction, I finished Louise Brooks’ memoir which continued into the sixties. In it she gives some insight into several actors and actresses she knew well, including Humphrey Bogart, Marion Davies (mistress of publisher William Randolph Hearst), Lilian Gish, Greta Garbo, W.C.Fields, and others. I learned little that I didn’t already know about Hollywood in the Twenties, but I enjoyed Lulu in Hollywood.\n\nAnd check out this blog for more than a dozen gorgeous photos of Miss Brooks in all her glory.\n\nhttp://theselvedgeyard.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/the-original-it-girl-of-the-1920s-the-allure-of-louise-brooks/\n\nIt’s a little known fact that Willis Carrier invented air conditioning not to cool people but to cool factories, to reduce humidity in factories where it was preventing machines from working properly. Only later did the idea of cooling human beings catch on.\n\nThe first public place to install “refrigeration,” as it was known, was the Rivoli Theater in Times Square, a movie theater whose advertisements boasted that the new system allowed “the manufacturing of ideal weather.” Here is an eyewitness account of the summer day in 1925 when the new Rivoli Theatre showed its first movie to an audience cooled by Carrier’s invention.\n\n“. . . Typical of show business, the opening of the Rivoli was widely advertised and its air conditioning system heralded along Broadway. Long before the doors opened, people lined up at the box office – curious about ‘cool comfort’ as offered by the managers. It was like a World Series crowd waiting for bleacher seats. They were not only curious, but skeptical-all of the women and some of the men had fans-a standard accessory of that day.\n\nPatrons line up to enter the\n\nRivoli Theater\n\nAmong the spectators was Adolph Zukor. I recall how quiet and reserved he was when he walked in and took a seat in the balcony. Zukor may have come from California, but he was there to be shown!\n\nFinal adjustments delayed us in starting up the machine, so that the doors opened before the air conditioning system was turned on. The people poured in, filled all the seats, and stood seven deep in the back of the theater. We had more than we had bargained for and were plenty worried. From the wings we watched in dismay as two thousand fans fluttered. We felt that Mr. Zukor was watching the people instead of the picture-and saw all those waving fans!\n\nIt takes time to pull down the temperature in a quickly filled theater on a hot day, and a still longer time for a packed house. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, the fans dropped into laps as the effects of the air conditioning system became evident. Only a few chronic fanners persisted, but soon they, too, ceased fanning. We had stopped them ‘cold’ and breathed a great sigh of relief.\n\nWe then went into the lobby and waited for Mr. Zukor to come downstairs. When he saw us, he did not wait for us to ask his opinion. He said tersely, ‘Yes, the people are going to like it.'”\n\nAdolph Zukor makes an appearance in my second novel, Silver Screen Murders. Now that I know about his attendance at this event, I can work it into the story for my third, which I am currently writing. It takes place in the spring of 1925, and this air conditioning event took place in the summer, so the time frame is a little off. Maybe I’ll have him talking about it, planning to attend to see how the new invention works.\n\nOn this date, June 15, in 1925, the film Don Q: Son of Zorro was released tot he public. It became one of Douglas Fairbanks’s most successful films, a sequel to his fabulously popular Mark of Zorro that came out five years earlier. In the first film, Fairbanks played the part of Zorro, of course, pretty much inventing the action adventure hero that has been such a Hollywood staple ever since. His acrobatic feats–leaping off buildings, swinging from chandeliers, and dashing about with sword fights–astonished audiences who had never seen anything like it. Five years later, he was ready for Son of Zorro, where he plays the title role of the mysterious Don Q. To distinguish father from son, Fairbanks created the son as a master with the whip, rather than the sword. Learning this skill took him months of practice with an expert from Australia.\n\nThis film features prominently in the second book in my series, SILVER SCREEN MURDERS. Jessie has moved to Hollywood in this book and gotten a job as a lowly assistant script girl at Pickford-Fairbanks Studios where she works on the set of Son of Zorro. I wove some of the other characters into the story too, like Mary Astor who plays the love interest, and Lottie Pickford, Douglas’s sister-in-law, who has an important part as a servant girl. To get the details right, I ordered copies of both movies from Netflix and watched them several times, taking notes throughout. You can too.
