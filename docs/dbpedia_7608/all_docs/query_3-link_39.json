It is a somewhat violent drama but it is also an ironically comic work and there is a formal beauty in the destructiveness of the burning film. While the film (from section to section or from screen to screen, in the installation format) develops, becomes more visually complex, successively regenerates (as the figurative images degenerate), it nevertheless implies no finality, rather, even in its three-screen vicious circularity form, 3rd degree implies endurability , extension and on-goingness . – P.S.\n\nThis is a three-part single-screen version of the work, which can also be shown as a three-screen/sound installation piece (continuous loop projection for gallery space).\n\nThis website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.
