        "text": "There is a hierarchy of sound and image in films but that is not a natural one. There are moments in the history of cinema when a rupture occurs in the process and sound affects us more than visual. The lack of discussion on film sound is alarming with respect to that. This paper interrogates the conditions of such an absence and the complexities of such a denial, which in itself might be an unspeakable rule. In more ways than one, such denials create the absence of a theoretical framework and linguistic tools that would render the articulation of film sound possible. This paper argues that this is not merely a case of negligence or lack of research material, but there is a pattern to such denial.\n\nFor psychoanalytic theory, the object of the cinema has always been the gaze. The importance of the gaze as the impossible object around which films are constructed is impossible to question. However, this essay contends that we should consider the importance of the voice as a possible object of a particular type of cinema. We should think of these two objects, the voice and the gaze, as having a historical relationship with each other. The contention here is that while the gaze is the object of the sound film, the voice is the object of the silent film. The absence of voices in silent cinema provides the perfect form for depicting the voice as an absent object. Once characters actually begin to speak on the screen, however, their voices obscure the voice as an absent object, and the result is that the gaze becomes the central cinematic object and preoccupation.\n\nOver the last few years, sound and music practices during the silent film period have received an increasing attention from the academic community, both in film studies and musicology. The emergence of interdisciplinary networks, such as “The Sounds of Early Cinema in Britain” (Brown and Davison 2013) and the “Cabiria Research Project” in Italy (Colturato 2014), have contributed to widen the frame of this field, revealing the importance of national, regional and local specificities in the construction of early cinema as an auditory experience. In the context of the thematic issue on “Music, sound and cinema”, Aniki interviewed Claus Tieber and Anna K. Windish, researchers at the University of Salzburg and editors of The Sounds of Silent Films: New Perspectives on History, Theory and Practice, the proceedings of an international conference held in 2013 at Kiel University. Tieber and Windish are, respectively, principal investigator and research assistant of the project “The Sound of ...\n\nOver the last few years, sound and music practices during the silent film period have received an increasing attention from the academic community, both in film studies and musicology.

In the context of the thematic issue on “Music, sound and cinema”, Aniki interviewed Claus Tieber and Anna K. Windisch.\n\nWithin the strategies built upon the intentional weakening of the diegetic efficiency a group apart is formed by those films which try to reach this gesture of destruction by resorting to the diegetically weaker, in this sense pre-discursive way of expression of the silent cinema. In this paper the author analyze two films from this perspective: Guy Maddin’s Careful (1992) and Esteban Sapir’s La Antena (2007). The plot of these films coupled with the effect achieved by the mimicry of the silent film challenges interpretation. What are the discursive functions in the contemporary cinema of the silent film-like formal principles and techniques weakening the diegetic effect, such as the absence of the synchronized sound and the use of the intertitles in the film? The hypothesis is, that the turning to the visual style of the silent film is associated with the problematization of the medial relationship between image and text, image and voice respectively, and is manifested both at the level of the fable and in the use of the filmic techniques."
