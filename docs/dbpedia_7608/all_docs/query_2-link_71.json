        "text": "An Era of Change within American Cinema\n\nBy Fatimah Mesbahi, Second Year BA History (originally written for American Cinema History; taught by Professor Melvyn Stokes)\n\nSource: First nighters posing for the camera outside the Warners Theatre before the premier of “Don Juan” with John Barrymore, (National Archives Identifier 535750.)\n\nThe coming of sound and the transition from silent to talking films revolutionized the Hollywood film industry. This essay will examine the changes that took place within Hollywood film studios with the coming of sound and the adjustments that were made from silent films to talking pictures, commonly known as talkies. Donald Crafton argues that sound did not arrive in cinema like an “express train”, as it “came gradually, in little crates, over a period of more than ten years.” There were many experiments carried out by Thomas Edison during the 1890’s to synchronise sound and film, with a notable example being in 1894 when William Dickson collaborated with Edison to create the Dickson Experimental Sound Film, which was the first film to contain live recorded sound. In the initial stages of cinema, there were no synchronized recorded sounds but, rather, motion pictures and title cards indicating the dialogue associated with what may be the plot or story. One of the first public premieres of a sound feature film occurred in 1926, when Warner Brothers “retro-fitted” their silent version of the film Don Juan with synchronized music and sound effects. However, the dawn of the sound era is generally considered by film historians to coincide with the Warner Brothers release of The Jazz Singer in late 1927, as it was the first feature-length motion picture that contained a synchronized music score and lip-synchronous singing.\n\nAs identified by Donald Crafton, three stages took place for the Hollywood film industry to transition into making talking pictures, which are known as invention, innovation, and diffusion. The stage known as “Invention” covers the period up until 1925, when Warner Brothers decided to use the synch-sound device called the Vitaphone. Film studios consciously decided to move forward with sound technology during the late 1920’s, which can be recognised as the “Innovation” phase during which major film studios, such as MGM and Warner Bros. experimented with different ways of using sound in films. Lastly, the term “diffusion” is used to refer to the final stage of the arrival of talking pictures, signifying a time in which talkies were released nationally and internationally across the world, as theatres were being wired to accommodate the new sound technology.\n\nThe transition from silent films to talkies was a major transformation for Hollywood film studios and it drastically changed the lives of actors, leading some to fame and many others towards the end of their careers. It was challenging for many actors to adapt to their new speaking roles in films, as many had voices that did not resonate with their characters’ roles in films. Furthermore, many actors were not prepared for or suitable for acting in talking films, as silent film actors relied heavily on overused mannerisms to convey their emotions to the audience, whilst talking films required actors to have an appealing voice and be able to act naturally without using overly dramatic expressions. For instance, Vilma Bánky, a famous silent film star during the 1920s had a strong Hungarian accent that led to a decline in her popularity once her accent became apparent in talking pictures. The most well-known alleged victim of sound was John Gilbert, MGM’s most admired silent actor, who was believed to have a squeaky voice, which resulted in his first talkie in 1929 called His Glorious Night, being poorly received. This is further evidenced when Cinema managers were asked to list their “Top Ten Money-making Stars” in an annual exhibitor poll that ran from 1915 to 2013. Between 1920 and 1940, Seventy-two different actors made this ‘Top Ten list’, and a majority of them appeared more than once. However, whilst a number of actors appeared on it repeatedly in the 1920s and 1930s, none of the actors appeared on it simultaneously both in the silent and sound era. The exceptionally high rate of departure of actors from the listings could be correlated with the transition to talking pictures in the film industry. Thus, the advent of synchronized sound in cinema required actors to have good vocal capabilities, as appearances were no longer enough for people to be accepted into the film industry. Alternatively, Hollywood stars like Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo excelled in their acting careers with the production of talkies during the 1930s. Crawford became one of the biggest stars at MGM and was admired for her acting capability in films such as Letty Lynton. Greta Garbo was able to rise to even greater fame due to the emergence of talking pictures. She possessed a unique quality that was ideal for silent films, but her talking roles in films increased her popularity as her voice appealed to audiences and resulted in her being nominated for an Academy Award for her second talking film, Romance (1930). Nonetheless, the introduction of sound in movies benefitted many, who saw it as an opportunity to display their vocal prowess, while simultaneously ushering the end of the acting careers for many other silent actors.\n\nThe early years of the arrival of talking pictures were challenging because of the flaws in early recording equipment and the restrictions they placed on filmmaking techniques. However, even during the years of the Great Depression, cinemagoing still remained common in America, as 85 million people a week visited movie theatres across the United States, often, as a distraction from their discontented lives and difficult financial circumstances. By the early 1930s, however, technological advancements and the successful production of talkies had led to such a marked improvement in the quality of movies that many film historians regard that period as the start of Hollywood’s Golden Era.\n\nSelect Bibliography\n\nCrafton, Donald.
