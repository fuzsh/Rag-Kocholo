        "text": "Overview\n\nWhat is Film?\n\nWhy do films affect us the way they do? Why did the introduction of sound change film forever? What do we mean by ‘independent cinema’? What is a digital story world? These and many more are the questions that Film Studies asks students to consider in small-group lectures and seminars. In addition, over the course of your degree you’ll be encouraged to respond creatively to critical issues via projects, presentations, short films and video essays, as well as to develop your screenwriting skills to see if you have a fresh vision to share with the world around you.\n\nDo you enjoy:\n\nWatching and analysing a wide range of films from around the world?\n\nFormulating opinions and arguments about film and media culture?\n\nExpressing your ideas critically and creatively in words and images?\n\nFilm: The course for you?\n\nIf you dream of becoming the new darling of Hollywood, and of immersing yourself in the practicalities of film production, then this is not the course for you.

You will also be introduced to basic screenwriting and filmmaking, using the format of the writers’ room, and exploring the potential of the smartphone to create mini-dramas. You will study documentary theory and follow this up by making a short documentary film. In third and fourth year, you will build on the fundamentals you have learnt through more advanced options, while always maintaining a balance between critical learning and practical outputs.\n\nFilm at Trinity\n\nFilm students are encouraged to collaborate with other students in the School through shared learning modules and facilities.
