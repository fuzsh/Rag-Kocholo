Why is it that the movie industry has changed but the stories that they employ remain the same? What can these films tell us about the contexts in which they were made?

Television and Social Change. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course explores television's complex relationship to social change. While television's commercialism and focus on entertainment may seem antithetical to activist politics, activists used the medium to gain visibility for their causes, demand equitable representation and employment practices, and create programming that spoke back to mainstream TV's reductive and controlling representations. The course engages with scholarly and activist literature on theories of television, representation, and social change as well as case studies of public and commercial television in various national and historical contexts. It also considers the possibilities and limitations for activism via television brought about by transformations in media technology and culture, particularly those related to online distribution, digital media, and globalization.

Teen Television. (4 Credits)\n\nIn this course, we consider global television that represents teens and programs that hailed teen audiences. The concept of the teenager is a relatively recent development in U.S. culture, emerging in the 1920s. From that moment, media has played an important role in the creation, maintenance, and revision of discourses of the teenager. Thus, one goal will be to assess the ways that teenagers have been represented and targeted at different points in time and in different genres of television. Secondly, we will consider whether teen television has developed as its own genre in the last 30 years and how that corresponds to theories about global youth cultures and media. Lastly, we will discuss the ways in which these television representations correspond to teens’ lived experiences and become the vessel for adults’ hopes, anxieties, and nostalgia.

As a city that generates and is defined by formative industries, cultural institutions, and socio-political movements associated with fashion and media, London plays a crucial role in our explorations.

Queer Studies in Film and Television. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course examines “queer” independent and mainstream film and television. We will delve into classic Hollywood cinema, “New Queer Cinema,” European cinema, global and “transnational” cinema, as well as U.S. and Canadian TV series. We will apply queer, feminist, film, and television theories to the media in order to more profoundly understand our objects of study—the films and TV series themselves—while simultaneously using our objects to better understand the theories and histories. As we unpack assumptions about sexed bodies, sexual desires, gender identities, and sexual identities, we will examine the ways in which films and TV series uphold and subvert the status quo in regards to gender and sexual norms.

British Cinema and Television. (4 Credits)\n\nBritish Heritage Cinema, arguably the most identifiable and lucrative form of British national cinema, emerged in the 1980s and continues to define “Britishness” through its nostalgic and individualized view of the past. In looking at costume dramas, literary adaptations, and biographical films, this course explores Heritage Cinema through its key themes and aesthetics, the cultural context in which it gained and retains popularity, and its material and ideological consequences.

Quality Television/Cult TV. (4 Credits)\n\nThis class examines two key categories for grouping television shows—“quality television” and “cult TV”—and considers the history behind these terms, the technological changes in the industry that brought them about, and the ways in which the two terms have increasingly intersected. These two approaches to TV shows also map out an industrybased approach (the long-standing marketing strategy of “quality television”) and an audience-based approach (the intense fandom that generates a cult TV show), allowing the class to study texts by considering and combining both industrial histories of television and reception theories of television. Bringing the material into the present day, the class also ultimately brings the two terms together, “quality” and “cult,” as new technologies and their attendant media strategies and audience practices have increasingly blurred their distinction—and cult audiences become the arbiters, and marketers, of quality TV.

TV, Identity, and Representation.

To do so, the course focuses on theory and criticism about representations of femininity and masculinity, race and ethnicity, and economics and involves attendant issues of sexuality, embodiment, desire, and identification. This approach will be augmented by considerations of historical and cultural contexts for television texts, developments within television industries, key figures in television production, and audiences.

Television, Race, and Civil Rights. (4 Credits)\n\n“The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.” This was the rallying cry of Black radicals during times of national unrest, especially associated with the Black Power Movement. This course introduces students to the intersection of television, race, and civil rights broadly. How does U.S. TV engage with racial injustice and the fight for civil rights? How does the mass medium articulate pressing issues concerning the historical struggle for equality for African Americans? Students will engage with concepts in television studies as they connect to representations of racial Blackness on the small screen, paying special attention to TV texts, audiences, and industries. Topics discussed include mediations of protest, violence, and criminality in news media as well as social and political commentary in fictional programming.

Italian Americans on Screen. (4 Credits)\n\nWhat can explain the shocking popularity of Jersey Shore? Where did the controversial images of Italian Americans that the show displays originate? This course proposes an examination of Italian Americans as represented in mainstream and independent American cinema (and later television) from the silent era to the present. Particular attention will be paid to the traditional stereotypes associated with these representations (how they arose and why they continue to exist), two specific genres--the gangster film and the boxing film--and how Italian-American filmmakers respond to and re-vision them. The class will also include field trips to Arthur Avenue and Little Italy.

Writing Television Sitcoms. (4 Credits)\n\n(Formerly COMM 4708): Sitcoms are shot by multiple cameras which limit the action to one or two sets. This practically eliminates all action lines in a sitcom screenplay, leaving behind mostly dialogue. This class teaches that behind that wall of sitcom dialogue , sophisticated writers have meticulously developed an invisible scaffolding of comedic tension which requires as much or even more effort than coming up with clever one-liners. This course teaches students to integrate “comedic tension” into all levels of work- from episode premise, to sequence, to scene. TV sitcom writing is performed in teams. Therefore students will write episodes together, and learn skills required to be a comedy staff writer- including originality, creativity, humor and supporting classmates with their scripts.
