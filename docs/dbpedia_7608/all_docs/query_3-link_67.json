        "text": "Overview\n\nMason Core is Mason’s general education program that builds the foundation for the Mason Graduate – an engaged citizen and well-rounded scholar who is prepared to act. Mason Core is a set of required courses that create the foundation of a student’s undergraduate degree. It provides a breadth of liberal education courses, complementing the depth of knowledge and skills students build in their majors and minors. All undergraduates seeking a baccalaureate degree must complete Mason Core requirements.\n\nFoundation Requirements (12 credits)\n\nFoundation requirements help ensure that students master the tools and techniques necessary to succeed in college and throughout their lives and careers. These courses emphasize skills—in writing, speaking, and working with numbers and technology—that can be applied to any major field of study and career.\n\nWritten Communication (lower-level, 3 credits)\n\nThe Mason Core curriculum offers students a unique opportunity to develop writing competencies across their educational experience that prepares them to participate in academic, professional, and civic communities. It does so in part by providing students with a “vertical” writing curriculum: a carefully sequenced series of courses designed to facilitate the long-term growth of writers as they develop expertise in the production and circulation of knowledge across a range of contexts and Students begin this process at the Foundation level and build higher-level skills at the Integration level in upper-level written communication and in Writing Intensive courses in their majors.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\nAs the first course in Mason’s vertical writing curriculum, students learn to see writing as a social, rhetorical act and are taught to effectively analyze and respond to a variety of writing situations in academic and non-academic contexts through analyzing, researching, and producing texts of varying genres that engage a range of\n\nRequired:\n\nOne approved course.\n\nCourse List Code Title Credits ENGH 100Composition for Multilingual Writers (Mason Core)4 ENGH 101Composition (Mason Core)3 ENGH 123Language-Enhanced Composition for Multilingual Writers (Mason Core)4\n\nOral Communication (3 credits)\n\nOral Communication focuses on developing students’ ability to create and deliver a variety of message types. Students will learn to monitor and ethically practice their own verbal and nonverbal communication to become an effective communicator, demonstrating respect and consideration for a multitude of audiences with whom they will communicate in a range of intercultural, personal, and professional contexts. They will learn to use oral communication as a way of thinking and learning, as well as to share ideas.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\nUpon completing an Oral Communication course, students will be able to:\n\nDemonstrate understanding of and proficiency in constructing and delivering multiple message types.\n\nUnderstand and practice effective elements of ethical verbal and nonverbal communication.\n\nDevelop analytical skills and critical listening skills.\n\nUnderstand the influence of culture in communication and will know how to cope with cultural differences when presenting information to an audience.\n\nRequired:\n\nCOMM 101 should be taken by all students unless their degree program specifies a different requirement.
