        "text": "The USC Leventhal School of Accounting Bachelor of Science, Accounting (BS) degree is designed to provide students with a broad foundation in accounting and business to prepare them for entry into the professional program leading to a Master of Accounting or Master of Business Taxation degree. The undergraduate curriculum also provides the background necessary for direct entry into the accounting profession. The BS, Accounting degree is a 128-unit program.\n\nAdmission\n\nStudents may be admitted to the program as incoming freshmen, as USC undergraduates transferring from another major or as students transferring from another college or university. Admission to Leventhal is dependent on admission to the university and on academic performance, particularly in quantitative areas. USC students who have not been admitted to the major or the minor in the Marshall School of Business and/or the Leventhal School of Accounting may complete a maximum of 12 units from the Marshall School of Business and/or the Leventhal School of Accounting. No further course work may be taken unless a student is admitted.\n\nLeventhal/Marshall Honors\n\nLeventhal/Marshall Honors is available upon graduation to majors in accounting or business administration and results in a special designation of departmental honors on a student's transcript. Acceptance to the program requires completion of at least 64 units of course work (including transfer units), a GPA of 3.5 or higher in course work to be applied to the major, an application, and a successful interview with the director of the program. Achievement of Leventhal/Marshall Honors requires completion of ACCT 493 Honors Research Seminar prior to the senior year, a thesis (research project and paper) conducted under the guidance of a Leventhal or Marshall faculty member during the senior year, and minimum GPA of 3.5 in upper-division Leventhal School of Accounting and Marshall School of Business courses applied to the major. For additional information, contact the Leventhal School of Accounting Undergraduate Program Office in ACC 101, (213) 740-4838.\n\nAdvisement\n\nAcademic advisement is provided through the Leventhal School of Accounting Undergraduate Program Office in Accounting 101, (213) 740-4838. Students are required to meet with an academic adviser before registering and this requirement remains in effect until 24 USC units are completed. However, all students are encouraged to see an academic adviser on a regular basis. A record of each student is kept on file. Appointments for advisement may be scheduled at most times during the academic year. However, during busy times such as the preregistration, registration and drop/add periods, advisers may be available on a walk-in basis only.\n\nThe Leventhal Undergraduate Program Office and Marshall Undergraduate Student Services offer students assistance in networking, finding internships, resume writing, interviewing techniques and other career-related issues.\n\nTransferring College Credit\n\nCollege Courses\n\nUSC has established articulation agreements with most community colleges throughout California. Most academic courses are acceptable for transfer credit from a two-year school, but students may not receive credit for specialized, technical or remedial courses.\n\nCourses that do not appear on the articulation agreement are not transferable. A maximum of 64 semester units may be transferred. Check with the Degree Progress Department (JHH 010) for questions about transferable courses or see a counselor in Accounting 101.\n\nOfficial transcripts of college work taken elsewhere must be submitted, at the time of application, to the USC Office of Admission. A credit evaluation will be completed, which will list transfer courses accepted for credit. All business courses completed at a two-year college, if transferable, will be considered elective credit.\n\nThere is one exception to this policy. Students may transfer two semesters of introductory accounting and receive credit equivalent to one semester of introductory accounting at USC. Then students can register for BUAD 305 Abridged Core Concepts of Accounting Information and complete their accounting course requirement in one semester at USC. In this case, students would not be required to take BUAD 280 or BUAD 281.\n\nFour Year Colleges\n\nMost courses are acceptable for unit credit from all fully accredited four-year institutions. If the courses do not satisfy specific subject requirements at USC, they will be accepted for elective course credit.\n\nStudents are urged to complete all their required business administration courses at USC. All business courses from four-year institutions, if transferable, will be considered elective credit unless a challenge examination is passed. Only core classes, with the exception of BUAD 497, may be challenged. Students should consult with an academic adviser in Bridge Hall 104 to initiate the challenge examination process.\n\nUSC Core Requirements\n\nThe university's general education program provides a coherent, integrated introduction to the breadth of knowledge you will need to consider yourself (and to be considered by other people) a generally well-educated person. This program is effective for all students entering USC in fall 2015 or later, or transfer students beginning college elsewhere at that time and subsequently transferring to USC. It requires eight courses in six Core Literacies, plus two courses in Global Perspectives (which may double-count with courses in the Core Literacies) and two courses in writing. See General Education for more information.\n\nThe BFA degree is a four-year, 132-unit, professional training program offering a vital and contemporary approach to the study of acting. The program comprises an integrated sequence of training in acting, voice, movement, camera, the web, voice-over, games, and includes multiple opportunities for performance on stage, and screen. The curriculum is based on the belief that an actor's emotional, imaginative, vocal and physical resources must be developed and prepared with maximum experience and flexibility for a fast-changing and challenging modern workplace. This training is combined with course work in critical and historical studies and technical theatre. An audition is required for admission. The BFA in Acting for Stage and Screen program is unique and highly competitive.\n\nAll BFA Theatre majors are required to earn a grade point average of 2.75 (A = 4.0) in their theatre courses each semester. BFA students who fail to earn a GPA of 2.75 in their theatre courses will be placed on probation the following semester. Students who remain on probation for a consecutive second semester will be disqualified from the BFA program.\n\nA student disqualified from continued study in the BFA program for failing to meet the GPA standards outlined above will be given the option of transferring into the BA program.\n\nGeneral Education Requirements\n\nThe university's General Education program provides a coherent, integrated introduction to the breadth of knowledge you will need to consider yourself (and to be considered by other people) a generally well-educated person. This program is effective for all students entering USC in fall 2015 or later, or transfer students beginning college elsewhere at that time and subsequently transferring to USC. It requires eight courses in six Core Literacies, plus two courses in Global Perspectives (which may double-count with courses in the Core Literacies) and two courses in writing. In addition, all entering freshmen are expected to complete a General Education Seminar during their first year at USC. These seminars satisfy one of the Core Literacy requirements above.\n\nNote that courses within the major will also satisfy certain Core Literacy requirements. Please work with your major adviser to determine those courses."
