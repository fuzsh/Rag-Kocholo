Where were the movie equivalent of Lincoln Steffens, of the photographers and social critics Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine, of the social reformer Jane Addams? Perhaps it was true, as one historian declared, that social issue films did not make an appearance until the 30's?\n\nLewis Jacobs's remarkable panorama \"The Rise of the American Film,\" published in 1939, gave me hope, for it contained much information that disproved this theory. But still I had to see the films for myself. Then one day, during a visit to the film teacher David Bradley in California, I was shown an obscure film from the studio of Thomas Ince called \"The Italian,\" directed in 1915 by Reginald Barker. For the first two reels, it was just the kind of silent film that puts people off, filled with arch, self-conscious shots of over-made-up actors posing as peasants, toiling in the vineyards. The story followed one of these peasants, Beppo (George Beban), to the United States. The moment it reached the New World, the sentimentality and artifice fell away; and I realized I was watching Neo-Realism 30 years before the Italians invented it.\n\nHad the scenes all been staged in the studio, the drama might have been momentarily affecting, but the film would be just another movie. Because the cameras were taken into the streets, the film acquired a documentary value that gave it an importance far beyond mere film history. Beppo brings his wife from the old country and celebrates the birth of a son. The boiling heat causes the child to fall ill. \"Pasteurized milk,\" advises the doctor. Beppo sets out with the few cents he has earned from his bootblack stand. In an alley, he is mugged by a couple of thugs, who steal his money and spend it on drink. Beppo recognizes them and calls a cop -- but the cop arrests"
