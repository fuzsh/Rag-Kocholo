        "text": "Explore all things production as you make film and TV magic\n\nFrom epic Hollywood blockbusters to bite-sized mobile programming, film and television content requires timeless storytelling and a complex harmony of production and performance. With resources that rival the biggest studios, award-winning professors, stellar signature festivals, and a talent pool that includes actors, writers, and production staff, SCAD film and television students have the resources and the stage to lead their own career narratives. Students are immersed in all aspects of the production process as they develop artistic and technical mastery — and work on real sets long before graduation.\n\nPursue your passion with GRADpath@SCAD\n\nGRADpath@SCAD offers incoming first-year students the opportunity to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in an accelerated and continuous program of study.\n\nFilm and television students may complete a B.F.A. and M.A. in as few as four years or a B.F.A. and M.F.A. in as few as five years.\n\nLearn more\n\nAt SCAD, students enhance their filmmaking with cutting-edge equipment, benefit from the extensive connections of accomplished faculty, and find the right role for them in top productions. SCAD grad Greg Brunkalla (B.F.A, video/film, 2001) describes how his SCAD experience prepared him to helm commercials and music videos for clients like Crown Royal, Delta Air Lines, Vampire Weekend, and more.\n\nDiscover your dream job\n\nSCAD film and television students have opportunities to work on real sets or join student-produced shows and short films long before they graduate. These student-led productions compete for prestigious awards, like the Student Emmy Award won by SCAD sitcom The Buzz, and are screened at international film festivals each year.\n\nAt SCAD signature events like the SCAD Savannah Film Festival and SCAD TVfest, you'll have the opportunity to meet and mingle with industry VIPs, including top directors, cinematographers, writers, actors, and more.\n\nSee more of the film and television student experience\n\nRelated majors and minors\n\nSCAD prepares students for the same interdisciplinary collaboration they'll be a part of on set or stage as professionals. With programs like animation, television producing, sound design, acting, and more available, SCAD film and television students are empowered to explore multiple perspectives and expand their creative possibilities."
