Indecent Exposure: A True Story of Hollywood and Wall Street\n\nBy David McClintick\n\n1982 • HarperCollins • Business\n\n46 votes\n\nMcClintick, a Wall Street Journal reporter, broke the story of “the Begelman affair” — when Columbia Pictures production president David Begelman forged checks and embezzled money, but was protected by his superiors — and then expanded it into a book that was unlike any before it, and became the model for many that have subsequently tried to capture the corrupting influence of money and power in Hollywood. Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Outrageous Conduct: Art, Ego and the Twilight Zone Case, by Stephen Farber & Mark Green\n\n28. City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s\n\nBy Otto Friedrich\n\n1988 • Headline Book Publishing • History\n\n47 votes\n\nFriedrich, a film journalist and historian as well read as any, herein gathers the most amusing stories about a decade of cinema that was shaped by World War II and the Europeans who fled Hitler for America, the House Committee on Un-American Activities’ investigations into Hollywood, and more. The New York Times described it as “extraordinarily readable.” Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Reinventing Hollywood: How 1940s Filmmakers Changed Movie Storytelling, by David Bordwell\n\n27. Memo From David O. Selznick: The Creation of Gone With the Wind and Other Motion Picture Classics, as Revealed in the Producer’s Private Letters, Telegrams, Memorandums and Autobiographical Remarks\n\nBy Rudy Behlmer\n\n1972 • Viking Press • Business\n\n49 votes\n\nDaniel Selznick, one of the legendary producer’s sons, enlisted Behlmer, a film journalist, to review his late father’s papers, including memos dictated to secretaries throughout his half-century career, which Behlmer curated and contextualized in this book. In the age of email, barring another Sony hack, it’s hard to imagine we’ll ever again get such a window into how filmmaking decisions large and small are made. Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Memo from Darryl F. Zanuck: The Golden Years at Twentieth Century-Fox, by Rudy Behlmer\n\n26. In the Blink of an Eye\n\nBy Walter Murch\n\n1995 • Silman-James Press • How To\n\n51 votes\n\nMurch, one of the all-time great editors of film and sound — his credits include all three Godfather films, American Graffiti, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now — expanded a 1988 lecture that he gave in Australia into this book-length manifesto about editing “on the fly.” His thesis: that humans blink when they move from one thought to another, so cuts should do the same. Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: When the Shooting Stops… the Cutting Begins, by Robert Karen & Ralph Rosenblum\n\n25. The Devil’s Candy: The Anatomy of a Hollywood Fiasco\n\nBy Julie Salamon\n\n1991 • Houghton Mifflin • Making Of\n\n54 votes\n\nA Wall Street Journal film critic, Salamon wanted to write a modern version of Lillian Ross’ Picture (#30), a landmark 1950s chronicle of a film from conception through aftermath. Brian De Palma invited her to do that with The Bonfire of the Vanities, his big-screen adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s novel about Wall Street, which turned out to be an unmitigated disaster, but provided the author with a wealth of priceless material. Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside ‘The Room,’ the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made, by Greg Sestero\n\n22 (tie). The Last Tycoon\n\nBy F. Scott Fitzgerald, finished by Edmund Wilson\n\n1941 • Charles Scribner’s Sons • Novel\n\n55 votes\n\nMore than a decade after The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald was writing for the movies and widely regarded as washed-up. He began writing a book about Monroe Stahr, a Thalberg-like “boy wonder” who understood “the whole equation of pictures,” in which he famously noted, “There are no second acts in American life.” Had he not died of a heart attack in 1940, at just 44, and lived to see the reception of this book, he’d have been proved wrong.

Knopf • Interview/Oral History\n\n55 votes\n\nThe product of a friendship that emerged after Crowe tried to get Wilder to cameo in Jerry Maguire, this Hitchcock/Truffaut-inspired book features two journalists-turned-filmmakers — one in his 40s, the other in his 90s — dissecting the latter’s life (he almost directed Schindler’s List as a tribute to his mother, who died in the Holocaust) and films (e.g., Brief Encounter inspired The Apartment).

The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies\n\nBy Vito Russo\n\n1981 • Harper & Row • Gender/Race/Sexuality\n\n55 votes\n\nRusso, a film critic and gay activist, adapted his lecture about film depictions of gays and lesbians — as objects of ridicule or fear who almost always wound up dead — into a trailblazing book. Shortly before dying of AIDS he said, “I know that after I’m dead my book is going to be on a shelf someplace and that some sixteen-year-old kid who’s going to be a gay activist will read my work and carry the ball from there.” Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality and Insurrection in American Cinema, 1930-1934, by Thomas Doherty\n\n20 (tie). Goldwyn: A Biography\n\nBy A. Scott Berg\n\n1989 • Alfred A. Knopf • Biography\n\n56 votes\n\nOffered unprecedented archival access by Samuel Goldwyn Jr., Berg spent nine years reading everything and interviewing everyone (Wyler! Hepburn! Olivier!) associated with the man who was the top independent producer during Hollywood’s golden age. The story of his journey from Schmuel Gelbfisz in Poland to Oscar winner shows that those who underestimated him because of his famous ‘Goldwynisms’ were sorely mistaken.

Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven’s Gate\n\nBy Steven Bach\n\n1985 • William Morrow and Company • Business\n\n56 votes\n\nIndecent Exposure [#29] showed that the public had an appetite for stories about the business of film, so, at the urging of William Goldman, Bach, a United Artists exec, kept notes during the making of UA’s Heaven’s Gate, Michael Cimino’s first pic after The Deer Hunter, when he was at his most arrogant and indulged. The film became one of the biggest bombs in Hollywood history and resulted in the sale of the studio — and this book.

Leonard Maltin’s Movie Guide [annually updated]\n\nBy Leonard Maltin\n\n1969 • Signet Books • Criticism/Theory/Essay\n\n57 votes\n\nOn the basis of impressive fanzines he’d been writing, Maltin was contracted to write the first edition of this collection of short reviews — which included then hard-to-find information like runtimes — when he was just 17. It began with 8,000 entries and was initially updated every few years, then annually after its amiable author became the on-air critic for Entertainment Tonight in 1982, until the internet killed it off in 2014.

Pauvert • Potpourri\n\n58 votes\n\nBefore supermarket tabloids and TMZ, celebrity gossip was harder to come by, hence the popularity of this chronicle of celeb affairs, murders and suicides, which the New York Times said was “without one single redeeming merit.” Penned by an underground filmmaker, it became a bestseller, spawned a sequel and has been largely debunked (no, Clara Bow didn’t sleep with the entire USC football team and Jayne Mansfield wasn’t decapitated). Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars, by Scotty Bowers with Lionel Friedberg\n\n17. The Genius of the System: Hollywood Filmmaking in the Studio Era\n\nBy Thomas Schatz\n\n1988 • Pantheon • History\n\n59 votes\n\nA rebuttal of sorts to the auteur theory, this deeply researched book lays out the argument that, at least during Hollywood’s Golden Age, films were the product of no individual, but rather of studios with military-like hierarchies and units. He presents compelling case studies from the MGM, Selznick International, Universal and Warner Bros. studios.

The American Cinema: Directors and Directions, 1929-1968\n\nBy Andrew Sarris\n\n1968 • Dutton • Criticism/Theory/Essay\n\n60 votes\n\nVillage Voice critic Sarris had been exposed to the Cahiers du Cinéma crowd’s auteur theory — that the director is a film’s primary author — during a year in Paris and brought it to America with this slim volume. A prized possession of a generation of young stateside cineastes, it forced reevaluations of many filmmakers by separating them into categories like “Pantheon” and “Less Than Meets the Eye,” infuriating Pauline Kael in the process.

Mike Nichols: A Life\n\nBy Mark Harris\n\n2021 • Penguin Press • Biography\n\n61 votes\n\nHarris, who got to know Nichols late in the filmmaker’s life (he died in 2014), received the blessing of Nichols’ family to write about him, which led to people like Meryl Streep, Robert Redford and Elaine May going on the record about him. The book explores the man’s considerable character flaws, while marveling at the enormity of his journey from Germany (he left ahead of the Nazis’ rise) to the top of Broadway and Hollywood.

From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies\n\nBy Molly Haskell\n\n1974 • New English Library • Gender/Race/Sexuality\n\n67 votes\n\nHaskell, then a film critic at The Village Voice, argues in this book that depictions of female characters were far more complex during Hollywood’s Golden Age than in the years that followed: “Here we are today, with an unparalleled freedom of expression and a record number of women performing, achieving, choosing to fulfill themselves, and we are insulted with the worst — the most abused, neglected and dehumanized — screen heroines in history.” Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: The Casting Couch and Other Front Row Seats: Women in Films of the 1970s and 1980s, by Marsha McCreadie\n\n13. The Day of the Locust\n\nBy Nathanael West\n\n1939 • Random House • Novel\n\n68 votes\n\nThis Depression-set downer about people living on the margins of Hollywood — the town and the business — is regarded as the finest work by West, who began working in Hollywood as a screenwriter in 1933, and who died in a car crash in 1940, at just 37. The L.A. Times called it “the single best-achieved, and most oracular, piece of fiction the city has inspired.” Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Some Time in the Sun: The Hollywood Years of F.

Knopf • History\n\n74 votes\n\nFor this authoritative chronicle of silent cinema, Brownlow, while still in his 20s, tracked down and interviewed stars like Pickford, Keaton and Gish, and key behind-the-scenes contributors like D.W. Griffith’s film editor, to provide insights about that era’s films and filmmaking methods. In 2010, he became the first film preservationist ever awarded an honorary Oscar.

What Makes Sammy Run?\n\nBy Budd Schulberg\n\n1941 • Random House • Novel\n\n75 votes\n\nSchulberg was 27 when he wrote his debut novel, the story of a New York office boy who moves to Hollywood, changes his name to Sammy Glick and claws his way to the top. Industry leaders regarded it as an attack and ostracized its author, who’d later name names before HUAC and then write — and win an Oscar for — his self-defense, On the Waterfront. Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Moving Pictures: Memories of a Hollywood Prince, by Budd Schulberg\n\n10. Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood\n\nBy Mark Harris\n\n2008 • Penguin Press • History\n\n77 votes\n\nThis first book by Harris, who was an Entertainment Weekly columnist at the time, chronicles an inflection point in Hollywood history through the journeys to the screen and to the Oscars of the five 1967 movies that wound up nominated for best picture, some representing the old Hollywood fighting to hold on (Doctor Dolittle and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner) and others a new one bursting onto the scene (Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate). The New York Times hailed it as a “landmark” achievement. Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography, by Sidney Poitier\n\n8 (tie). Making Movies\n\nBy Sidney Lumet\n\n1995 • Alfred A. Knopf • Autobiography\n\n79 votes\n\n“I am sometimes asked if there is ‘one book’ a filmgoer could read to learn more about how movies are made and what to look for while watching them,” Roger Ebert once wrote. “This is that book.” Lumet, who started in live TV before helming films like 12 Angry Men, Dog Day Afternoon and Network, shares the techniques and philosophy that he adopted over the course of his career (“Good style, to me, is unseen style… style that is felt”) and explains why directing, in his view, is “the best job in the world.” Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Chasing the Light: Writing, Directing and Surviving Platoon, Midnight Express, Scarface, Salvador and the Movie Game, by Oliver Stone\n\n8 (tie). Elia Kazan: A Life\n\nBy Elia Kazan\n\n1988 • Alfred A. Knopf • Autobiography\n\n79 votes\n\nIn this giant tome, one of the great directors of stage (Death of a Salesman and A Streetcar Named Desire) and screen (A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront), a man equally revered and hated during his lifetime, reflects, in great depth, on the people he worked with, including Marlon Brando and James Dean, and slept with, such as Marilyn Monroe; the decisions that shaped his life and career, like naming names during the McCarthy era; and, as much as he was able, his complicated self. Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Additional Dialogue: Letters of Dalton Trumbo, 1942-1962, by Dalton Trumbo, edited by Helen Manfull\n\n7. You’ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again\n\nBy Julia Phillips\n\n1991 • Random House • Autobiography\n\n80 votes\n\nLook up “tell-all” in the dictionary and you’ll find this rollicking account from a producer of The Sting (for which she became the first woman ever to win the best picture Oscar), Taxi Driver and Close Encounters of the Third Kind who then became a cokehead and alcoholic, squandered her fortune and, facing financial ruin, decided to dish on the people at the center of the New Hollywood, including herself. She was drugged out of her mind during her Oscar acceptance speech, missed her mom’s funeral, and the list goes on. The book, which one producer described as “the longest suicide note in history,” spent 13 weeks atop the New York Times bestseller list.

An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood\n\nBy Neal Gabler\n\n1988 • Crown • History\n\n81 votes\n\nOne of showbiz’s greatest chroniclers, in his first book (he later wrote outstanding biographies of Disney, Winchell and Streisand), addresses the familiar claims that “the Jews run Hollywood” by explaining how Eastern European immigrants like Cohn, Fox, Laemmle, Mayer, Warner, Thalberg, Zukor and the Warner brothers came to the business at a time when it wasn’t fashionable, tried to assimilate and, “by creating their idealized America on the screen … reinvented the country in the image of their fiction.” Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Entertaining America: Jews, Movies, and Broadcasting, by J. Hoberman & Jeffrey Shandler\n\n5. I Lost It at the Movies\n\nBy Pauline Kael\n\n1965 • Little, Brown and Company • Criticism/Theory/Essay\n\n86 votes\n\nThe first of many volumes by arguably the most well-known film critic of all time, it’s comprised of reviews and essays that she wrote between 1954 (the year after she first reviewed a film) and 1965 (before she began writing for The New Yorker and became a household name). Her famous contrarian streak was already evident in her withering takedown of West Side Story. Richard Schickel, reviewing the book — which went on the become a bestseller — in The New York Times, wrote, “Miss Kael may have lost something at the movies, but in her book we have found something — the critic the movies have deserved and needed for so long.” Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Reeling: Film Writings, 1972-1975, by Pauline Kael\n\n4. The Kid Stays in the Picture\n\nBy Robert Evans\n\n1994 • Hyperion • Autobiography\n\n123 votes\n\nAgainst all odds, a 64-year-old who was widely regarded as a has-been became a folk hero after the publication of this endlessly quotable memoir of an only-in-Hollywood life (and the audio-cassette and documentary versions of it that followed). Evans dishes on his rise from women’s clothing salesman to bit actor defended by Darryl F. Zanuck against people who wanted him out of a movie (hence the title of his book and his fascination with moguldom) to a Hollywood producer and studio chief married to the biggest movie star of the day — followed by a fall and a rise again. Is it all true? You bet your ass it isn’t. But is it irresistible? You’re goddamn right it is.

Adventures in the Screen Trade: A Personal View of Hollywood and Screenwriting\n\nBy William Goldman\n\n1983 • Warner Books • How To\n\n139 votes\n\nOne of the most respected and highly paid screenwriters in Hollywood history, who was best known for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, Marathon Man and The Princess Bride, candidly explains how the business works, discusses obstacles that he encountered during his career and illustrates how a screenplay comes together. Even 40 years after its publication, the book remains famous for its admonishment about the industry’s ability to predict box office success, and most other things: “Nobody knows anything.” Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: Which Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures in the Screen Trade, by William Goldman\n\n2. Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock ’n’ Roll Generation Saved Hollywood\n\nBy Peter Biskind\n\n1998 • Simon & Schuster • History\n\n140 votes\n\nPremiere’s former editor spent six years examining under the microscope the “New Hollywood” — which he defined as spanning Bonnie and Clyde (1967) through Raging Bull (1980) — by speaking with most of the key figures who had been a part of it decades earlier and survived to tell the tale, or as much of it as they could remember after considerable consumption of drink and drugs. It’s packed with juicy stories but not with citations, so its veracity has been questioned. (Steven Spielberg told Roger Ebert, “Every single word in that book about me is either erroneous or a lie.”) But the book — which spawned a 2003 documentary — is impossible to put down. Read it here.\n\nRelated reading: The Movie Brats: How the Film Generation Took over Hollywood, by Lynda Myles & Michael Pye\n\n1. Hitchcock [aka Hitchcock/Truffaut]\n\nBy François Truffaut, translated by Helen G. Scott\n\n1967 • Simon & Schuster • Interview/Oral History\n\n143 votes\n\nOften emulated but never equaled, this volume is the product of 50 hours of interviews conducted over a week in August 1962, when a young French master picked the brain of an old British master who was undervalued in America, but who the Frenchman, like other Cahiers du Cinéma alums, regarded as “the greatest director of films in the world.” Truffaut, a former critic, came thoroughly prepared, and coaxed out of Hitch information about his life and films that few if any others could have. At a time when old movies were hard to revisit, the accompanying frame enlargements were particularly appreciated. Kent Jones made a 2015 doc about this book.
