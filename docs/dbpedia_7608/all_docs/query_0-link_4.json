Women They Talk About was led by the research team at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films, the world’s most authoritative, freely accessible database of every American film released in the first 100 years of the art form and funded by The David and Lura Lovell Foundatio",

In the decades that followed, that number dropped to 6.9%, even though the amount of writer, director, and producer credits increased 308%. There were more credited roles, but women were not employed in them.\n\nFeature film credits attributed to women writers and co-writers\n\nFrom 1910-1930, women were credited as writers or co-writers in 27.5% of feature film productions. This number dropped to 12.2% in the release years 1931-1993, even though the average number of writing credits per movie increased 13%. Gender parity was not achieved in the silent era, but there were over twice as many women writers at that time than in the following years."
