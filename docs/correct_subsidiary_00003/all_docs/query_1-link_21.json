        "text": "We provide control tools to help you manage your experience with us. If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have not yet agreed and consented to this Privacy Policy, the legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy or legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL) still apply to your account. For Verizon Media products or services that are accessed without signing in to an account, this Privacy Policy applies to those products and services as of 25 May 2018. If you are creating a new account, the terms below apply as of today.\n\nThis Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what information Verizon Media, its affiliates and its house of global brands collect, why we collect it and what we do with it. If you are located in Europe, the Middle East or Africa (‘EMEA’), this policy applies to you. It sets out how Verizon Media controls and treats your information in its brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (we’ll collectively refer to these as ‘Services’).\n\nExcept as set out below, when we refer to ‘Verizon Media’, it means Verizon Media EMEA Limited, the Irish-established company that supplies the Services to you (and acts as data controller of the personal data Verizon Media collects when you use those Services). If you are a user of HuffPost UK, Sky | Yahoo Mail or BT | Yahoo Mail, ‘Verizon Media’ may refer to different entities in relation to who controls your personal data. HuffPost UK, Sky | Yahoo Mail or BT | Yahoo Mail users can find more information by clicking here. Furthermore, additional privacy practices for certain Services can be found in Details for specific products and services.\n\nIn many cases where we process your information, you may also have a right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your information. In certain circumstances, where we rely on ‘legitimate interests’ to process your information as described in the ‘Legal bases’ section below, you also have the right to object to the processing of your information by us.\n\nFinally, you have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information and your use of our Services at any time. Please note that if you withdraw your consent to the use or sharing of your information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, you may not have access to all (or any) of our Services and we might not be able to provide you with all (or any) of the Services under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. In certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent if we have a legal basis to do so, or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities. For example, we may keep information if we need to do so to comply with a legal obligation, to resolve disputes and to enforce our agreements.\n\nDevice information. We collect information from your devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.) in order to provide you with our Services, including information about how you interact with our Services and those of our third-party partners and information that allows us to recognise and associate your activity across devices and Services. This information includes device-specific identifiers and information such as IP address, cookie information, mobile device and advertising identifiers, browser version, operating system type and version, mobile network information, device settings and software data.\n\nIn order to deliver, personalise and improve our Services, we combine and use the information that we have about you (including information we receive on and off our Services) to understand how you use and interact with our Services and the people or things that you’re connected to and interested in. We may also use the information we have about you in the following ways and for the following purposes:\n\nTo provide, maintain, improve and develop relevant features, content and Services.\n\nTo analyse your content and other information (including incoming and outgoing emails, instant messages, posts photos, attachments and other communications) in order to keep our Services safe and secure. This analysis also assists us in making the content, Services and ads we provide to you more personalised (except in BT | Yahoo Mail). You can review and control certain types of information associated with your Verizon Media account by using Privacy Controls.\n\nTo fulfil your requests and when authorised by you.\n\nTo help advertisers and publishers connect to offer relevant advertising in their apps and websites.\n\nTo match and serve targeted advertising (across devices and both on and off our Services) and provide targeted advertising based on your device activity, inferred interests and location information.\n\nTo contact you with information about your account or with marketing messages, which you can also control.\n\nTo associate your activity across our Services and your different devices as well as associate any accounts you may use across Verizon Media Services together. We may associate activity and accounts under a single user ID.\n\nTo carry out or support promotions.\n\nTo conduct research and support innovation.\n\nTo create analytics and reports for external parties, including partners, publishers, advertisers, apps, third parties and the public regarding the use of and trends within our Services and ads, including showing trends to partners regarding general preferences, the effectiveness of ads and information on user experiences. These analytics and reports may include aggregate or pseudonymised information.\n\nTo provide location-based Services, advertising, search results and other content consistent with your location settings.\n\nTo combine information that we have about you with information that we obtain from business partners or other companies, such as your activities on other sites and apps in order to ensure that the ads, Services and content we provide to you are more suited to your interests.\n\nTo detect and defend against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity and to keep our Services safe and secure.\n\nWe mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information. First, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide our Services to you, in accordance with our Terms of Service. This processing is necessary to perform the contract between you and us, and our Terms of Service make it clear that processing of your information for the purposes of personalised content and ads is a necessary part of the Services we provide. Second, where you have given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent. Third, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests. Occasionally, Verizon Media may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user’s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation. Please see our Legal bases page for more information.\n\nVerizon Media shares information within its affiliated brands and companies and with Verizon. We also share information that we have about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including to provide Services that you have requested (including when you connect to third-party apps and widgets). We do not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with companies, organisations or individuals outside of Verizon Media unless one of the following circumstances applies:\n\nWith your consent. We will share information with companies, organisations or individuals outside of Verizon Media when we have your consent.\n\nWith Verizon. As part of Verizon, Verizon Media may, to the extent permitted by law and in accordance with user controls, share information with Verizon and Verizon affiliates. This information will be used in accordance with Verizon’s privacy policy.\n\nWithin Verizon Media. Information may also be shared within Verizon Media, including with other Verizon Media Services and affiliates. Verizon Media affiliates may use the information in a manner consistent with their privacy policies.\n\nWith partners. We may share your information with non-affiliated companies who are:\n\nTrusted vendors. We provide user information to trusted vendors who work on behalf of Verizon Media based on our directions and in compliance with appropriate confidentiality measures. Learn more.\n\nAdvertising, analytics and business partners. We may share aggregated or pseudonymous information (including demographic information) with partners, such as publishers, advertisers, measurement analytics, apps or other companies. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed or report how many people installed an app after seeing a promotion. We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information includes your name or email address) with these partners, such as publishers, advertisers, measurement analytics, apps or other companies.\n\nWhen you use third-party apps, websites or other products integrated with our Services, they may collect information about your activities subject to their own terms and privacy policies.\n\nWe allow other companies that show advertisements on our web pages or apps to collect information from your browsers or devices. Other companies’ use of cookies and other data collection technologies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Like many companies, we may allow cookie matching with selected partners. However, these parties are not authorised to access Verizon Media cookies.\n\nFor legal purposes. We may access, preserve and disclose information to investigate, prevent or take action in connection with: (i) legal processes, and legal and governmental agency requests; (ii) enforcement of the Terms; (iii) claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) requests for customer service; (v) technical issues; (vi) protecting the rights, property or personal safety of Verizon Media, its users or the public; (vii) establishing or exercising our legal rights or defending against legal claims; or (viii) as otherwise required by law.\n\nThis may include responding to lawful governmental requests. Learn more about how we evaluate and respond to these requests.\n\nNew ownership. If the ownership or control of all or part of Verizon, Verizon Media or a specific Service changes as a result of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, we may transfer your information to the new owner.\n\nWhen you use or interact with any of our Services, you consent to the data processing, sharing, transferring and usage of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Regardless of the country where you reside, you authorise us to transfer, process, store and use your information in countries other than your own in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to provide you with Services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside.\n\nThe United States and other non-EEA countries have different laws on data protection and rules in relation to government access to information. If you are based in the EEA, when your data is moved from your home country to a third country outside the EEA, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies only to Verizon Media. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Verizon Media does not own or control, or to people that Verizon Media does not employ or manage. In addition, some affiliated products may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Privacy Policy.\n\nWithout prejudice to any other rights you may have, you also have the right to file a complaint against us with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which is Verizon Media's lead supervisory authority. You can also complain to the supervisory authority in the EU member state in which you are based. Click here to find your local supervisory authority."
