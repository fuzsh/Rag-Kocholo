        "text": "Introduction\n\nYahoo is an American web services provider. It is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and operated by the namesake company Yahoo! Inc., which is 90% owned by investment funds managed by Apollo Global Management and 10% by Verizon Communications.\n\nIt provides a web portal, search engine Yahoo Search, and related services, including My Yahoo!, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, and its advertising platform, Yahoo! Native.\n\nYahoo was established by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s. However, its use declined in the late 2000s as some of its services were discontinued, and it lost market share to Facebook and Google.\n\nHistory\n\nYahoo was launched by two Stanford PhD students, David Filo and Jerry Yang, in 1994. At the time, Yahoo’s feature was a database that could help users search for websites based on their interests. Yahoo grew rapidly since millions of Americans were starting to explore the boom of the internet and needed to find their queries to the destination websites immediately. Around one year after the launch, Filo and Yang started commercializing Yahoo by selling advertisements on the Yahoo website to generate revenue and fund the growth plan. In 1996, Yahoo went public with a valuation of $33.8 million for the first time.\n\nBy 1997, Yahoo had introduced some new features: chat areas, news, online shopping, Yellow Pages, My Yahoo, and Yahoo Mail. Yahoo was one of the most visited websites, with page views in 1997 were around 65 million daily, and the number of monthly users logging on to Yahoo website was 40 million in 1998. Yahoo experienced huge growth at the time through the acquisition of several companies, such as Yoyodyne Entertainment and Viaweb.In 2000, the ‘dot-com boom’ helped Yahoo reach its highest valuation at around $125 billion, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world\n\nIn 2002, Yahoo missed an opportunity to acquire a giant high-tech company, Google. At the time, Google’s co-founders asked for ‘only’ $3 billion, but Yahoo was reluctant to deal with the price, making Yahoo fail to own Google, which is now worth more than $500 million. However, Yahoo continued to grow in 2005 when it acquired many other companies and put its stake to 40% shares of Alibaba, the largest Chinese e — commerce. In 2006, Yahoo offered $1 billion to acquire Facebook, but Facebook’s CEO refused it, although many media stated that Yahoo could get acceptance from Facebook’s board if Yahoo raised its offer by $100 million. Yahoo once again missed a chance to own a potential company, which eventually became today’s biggest social media.\n\nThe condition was turned around in 2008 when Microsoft tried to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Although Yahoo shareholders agreed with the acquisition by Microsoft, Yahoo CEO and Yahoo’s board did not, so the acquisition eventually did not take place. After changing its CEO four times in the last five years, yahoo appointed a former Google executive, Marissa Mayer, for the position. She received a big hope from Yahoo to make a good turn for the company and has made many acquisitions such as Tumblr, as well as developing new products. Finally, Verizon acquired Yahoo, a US communication company, at ‘only’ $4.83 billion.\n\nThe timeline below shows some of Yahoo’s important events.\n\n· 1994: Yahoo was founded by David Filo and Jerry Yang\n\n· 1995: Yahoo started to put advertisements\n\n· 1996: Yahoo went public, valued at $848 million\n\n· 2000: Yahoo reached its highest valuation of $125 billion\n\n· 2002: Yahoo missed an opportunity to acquire Google\n\n· 2005: Yahoo invested $1 billion to 40% shares of Alibaba\n\n· 2006: Yahoo missed an opportunity to acquire Facebook\n\n· 2008: Yahoo declined a $44.6 billion acquisition offer from Microsoft\n\n· 2012: Yahoo appointed the latest CEO, Marissa Mayer, and sold half of its Alibaba shares\n\n· 2013: Yahoo acquired Tumblr for $1.1 billion\n\n· 2016: Yahoo was acquired by Verizon at $4.83 billion\n\nBusiness Model\n\nAs Yahoo’s traffic surged, businesses recognized the platform’s potential and began paying Yahoo for advertising space. However, amidst this growth, Yahoo made a significant realization.\n\nYahoo grasped the wealth of data it possessed, offering insights into users’ preferences — such as which sites they preferred, the frequency of visits, trading patterns, and even their willingness to stay on less appealing sites. Leveraging this knowledge, Yahoo strategically positioned itself by shifting from linking to external products to promoting its own.\n\nIn the 90s, as online chat rooms gained popularity, Yahoo capitalized on this trend by launching its own chat room and prominently featuring it on its website. This move marked the beginning of Yahoo’s expansion into various consumer-oriented services. Over time, Yahoo introduced a range of products tailored to consumer preferences, including Yahoo file sharing, Yahoo Shopping, Yahoo Games, Yahoo Finance, and numerous other services\n\nArea of operation\n\nYahoo offers a multi-lingual interface available in over 20 languages: Yahoo International. Yahoo! Japan is a separate entity controlled by SoftBank. Yahoo! Xtra, launched in 2007 in New Zealand, is owned by Yahoo! 7, a joint venture between Yahoo! and the Seven Network.\n\nProducts of Yahoo\n\nYahoo! home page\n\nMy Yahoo! — Enables users to combine their favorite Yahoo features, content feeds, and information onto a single page.\n\noneSearch\n\nRivals.com\n\nYahoo! Auctions — discontinued in 2007 except for Taiwan and Japan.[2]\n\nYahoo! Developer Network\n\nYahoo! Entertainment (also branded Y! Entertainment)\n\nYahoo! Finance\n\nYahoo! Life — formerly known as Yahoo! Lifestyle\n\nYahoo! Mail\n\nYahoo! Movies\n\nYahoo! Native — formerly known as Yahoo! Advertising, Yahoo! Search Marketing, and Yahoo! Gemini, it provides online advertising services.\n\nYahoo! News\n\nYahoo! Plus — a collection of individual subscriptions: Yahoo! Mail Plus, Yahoo! Finance Plus, Yahoo! Fantasy Plus, Yahoo! Plus Protect Home, Yahoo! Plus Protect Mobile, Yahoo! Plus Secure and Yahoo! Plus Support\n\nYahoo! Research\n\nYahoo! Search\n\nYahoo! Shopping — a price comparison service\n\nYahoo! Sports\n\nYahoo! Weather\n\nCompetitors\n\nYahoo offers a range of products, including its search engine, email service (Yahoo Mail), news platform, Tumblr, Flickr, and more. Despite this array, many of Yahoo’s services face tough competition from rivals providing similar offerings. For instance, Google poses a formidable challenge to Yahoo’s search engine, Gmail competes with Yahoo Mail, ESPN rivals Yahoo Sports News, Instagram contends with Flickr, and Facebook competes with Tumblr.\n\nIn terms of revenue, advertising stands out as the primary contributor for Yahoo. Google and Facebook emerged as Yahoo’s key competitors, sharing a similar advertising-centric revenue model and offering services comparable to those provided by Yahoo. Notably, Google and Facebook have outperformed Yahoo in both revenue generation and net profit. Over nine years, Google and Facebook experienced significant revenue and net profit increases, showcasing their financial strength. In contrast, Yahoo struggled to achieve comparable growth, facing challenges in expanding its revenue and net profit.\n\nA particularly concerning point is Yahoo’s financial performance in 2015, where it reported a substantial negative net profit of over $4 billion. This financial downturn suggests that Yahoo’s recent business endeavors have encountered significant difficulties and challenges. The landscape of competition with industry giants like Google and Facebook has proven demanding, impacting Yahoo’s ability to match the financial success of its counterparts.\n\nYahoo Failure Timeline\n\n· 2012 — Scott Thompson appointed as CEO following the dismissal of Carol Bartz\n\n· 2012 — Sells half of its Alibaba stake for $7.1Bn\n\n· 2012 — Levinsohn (interim CEO) leaves; Marissa Mayer appointed as CEO\n\n· 2013 — Acquires Tumblr for $1.1Bn, Summly, and others\n\n· 2014 — Acquired Wander (social diary website)\n\n· 2014 — Acquired Flurry (a mobile ad company) for $200MM\n\n· 2015 — Acquires Polyvore (online shopping site) for $230MM\n\n· 2016 — States that the current strategy is to focus on “Search, Mail, Tumbler\n\nReason for failure\n\n· No special and superior product\n\nIt is true that Yahoo is one of the pioneers of the Internet, but this means nothing to Internet users if Yahoo cannot create better products than its competitors. Its main competitors, Google and Facebook, although they were founded later than Yahoo, have special and superior products, their search engine, email, and social media. These special and superior products mean they have the best quality among the similar products in the market. In comparison, Yahoo products such as Yahoo search engine, email, Flickr, and Tumblr are not considered as the first choice for internet users.\n\n· Lack of focus\n\nHaving so many products is useless if the products are not good enough for the users. Instead of focusing on developing several specific products, Yahoo already had 400 different products and services by 2001. This made Yahoo fail to have specialized and superior products such as Google with its search engine and Facebook with its social media.\n\nMoreover, having too many products and services can damage its ‘abandoned’ core products such as Yahoo mail, which was successfully attacked by hackers several times. This can eventually cause Yahoo mail users to move to another provider.\n\n· Poor leadership\n\nPoor leadership normally will endanger companies. In Yahoo, poor leadership can be seen from the failure to direct the company to focus on creating the company’s competitive advantage. Also, many decisions by Yahoo’s board and CEO were considered terrible, particularly regarding acquisition. For example, Geocities, Tumblr, and Broadcast.com, with their price of billions of dollars, are widely regarded as the worst acquisitions of all time, which does not truly benefit Yahoo. Besides, Merissa Mayer, the latest CEO of Yahoo, has aggressively acquired 53 companies, with $2.8 billion spending in total, but most of the 53 companies were shut down not long after the acquisition. Furthermore, the most prominent errors are missing opportunities to buy Google and Facebook in early 2000 and selling half of the high-growth Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.\n\n· Leadership Change\n\nYahoo underwent a tumultuous period with five CEO changes in just six years. In 2007, Terry Semel held the position, but significant shortcomings marred his tenure.\n\nSemel’s leadership was primarily marked by missed opportunities, notably failing to secure deals with major players like Facebook and Google. The lapse extended to missing a crucial deal with DoubleClick, an internet advertising agency later acquired by Google. This missed opportunity proved impactful, as DoubleClick played a pivotal role in shaping Google’s advertising business.\n\nCEO change\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009, Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s original founder, assumed the role of CEO. Then, from 2009 to 2011, Carol Bartz took the helm, Then Scott Thompson from 2011 to 2012. Finally, in 2012, Marissa Mayer took charge of the company.\n\n· No clear vision\n\nHaving a vision is one of the most important keys for companies. “Without it, there is no driving force or sense of direction.” Yahoo does not have a clear vision since it has changed the company descriptions 24 times within 24 years, which varies from high-tech company to media one. This indicates Yahoo is inconsistent with its goals, which eventually leads Yahoo to the decline.\n\nOver the course of six years, Yahoo underwent five CEO changes, indicative of a lack of a clear and consistent vision for the company. The frequent shifts in leadership were mirrored by changes in mission statements, a factor identified as one of the primary reasons behind Yahoo’s challenges and ultimate failure.\n\n· Security Breach\n\nOn September 22, 2016, Yahoo publicly disclosed a data breach that transpired in late 2014, compromising information linked to a minimum of 500 million user accounts. This breach stood as one of the most significant security incidents reported up to that point. The United States indicted four individuals, including two operatives from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), for their roles in the cyberattack.\n\nLater, on December 14, 2016, Yahoo made another alarming revelation of a separate data breach occurring in 2014, exposing sensitive account details, including security questions, for a staggering one billion accounts. The company clarified that the hackers employed stolen internal software to fabricate HTTP cookies as part of their infiltration strategy.\n\nFurther adding to the security woes, on October 3, 2017, Yahoo announced that all of its 3 billion user accounts were impacted by a theft that took place in August 2013. This expansive security compromise marked a critical blow to the company’s efforts to safeguard user data\n\n· Lack of Innovation\n\nYahoo’s struggle with innovation, notably in adapting to mobile technology and social media, played a pivotal role in its decline. The company failed to introduce compelling mobile experiences and lagged behind in leveraging the rise of social media platforms. This resulted in a diminished user experience and declining user engagement as competitors embraced these trends more effectively. Yahoo's failure to innovate in a rapidly evolving digital landscape proved detrimental to its competitiveness and overall relevance.\n\nThe alternative that might have helped Yahoo avoid failure\n\n· Strategic Focus on Technology\n\nYahoo’s strategic focus should pivot towards technology to harness its historical strengths and expertise. By aligning with the ever-evolving tech landscape, Yahoo can position itself as an innovator, developing cutting-edge solutions and staying ahead of industry trends.\n\n· Play to Win with Clear Goals\n\nTo revive its competitive edge, Yahoo must set clear, ambitious goals. These objectives should inspire and motivate its workforce, fostering a culture of excellence. A “play to win” mentality encourages employees to strive for innovation and market leadership.\n\n· Venture into Venture Capital\n\nConsider venturing into the realm of Venture Capital (VC) to actively contribute to technological advancements. By investing in promising startups and emerging technologies, Yahoo can diversify its portfolio and play a role in shaping the tech industry's future.\n\n· Move into Adjacent Markets\n\nWhile focusing on technology, Yahoo should strategically explore adjacent markets. This expansion allows the company to capitalize on its technological strengths while tapping into related sectors, creating a broader impact and revenue streams.\n\n· Disciplined Acquisitions\n\nYahoo should adopt a disciplined approach to acquisitions, ensuring that each strategic move aligns with the overall vision. Acquiring companies that complement Yahoo’s strengths and contribute to its technological focus can enhance competitiveness. It’s crucial not to overpay for acquisitions, carefully integrate them, and ensure that synergies are achievable.\n\n· Enhanced Corporate Governance\n\nYahoo should implement measures that enhance accountability and transparency to strengthen corporate governance.\n\nü Board Accountability\n\nEnsure that the Board is fully accountable for CEO appointments. This involves a rigorous selection process, focusing on candidates with a strong technological background and strategic vision.\n\nü Shareholder Activism\n\nEncourage shareholder activism as a constructive check-and-balance against the Board. This serves as a mechanism for ensuring that decisions align with shareholder interests and long-term company success.\n\n· Selecting the Right CEO\n\nChoosing a CEO with the necessary skills and a deep understanding of technology is paramount. The selected CEO should have a proven track record in leading tech-centric organizations, driving innovation, and navigating the dynamic landscape of the digital industry.\n\nBy embracing these principles, Yahoo can redefine itself as a technology-centric powerhouse, setting the stage for renewed growth, innovation, and sustained relevance in the competitive tech ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nYahoo’s path from an Internet pioneer to its acquisition by Verizon at $4.83 billion reflects a mixed journey of success and failure. While early achievements, like the ‘dot-com boom,’ propelled Yahoo to substantial valuations, strategic missteps, leadership changes, and security breaches marred its later years.\n\nThe lack of a clear vision missed opportunities with Google and Facebook, and a failure to innovate hindered Yahoo’s ability to compete with evolving industry trends. Security breaches in 2014 and 2013 further tarnished its reputation.\n\nAlternative strategies, like a technology-centric focus, disciplined acquisitions, and improved corporate governance, might have offered a different path. The cautionary tale underscores the importance of adaptability and strategic decision-making in the dynamic tech landscape. Yahoo’s legacy, now part of Verizon, is a complex narrative of triumphs and missed chances."
