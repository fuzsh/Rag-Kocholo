        "text": "Kroger consumer data is now available to select users of the Yahoo demand side platform (DSP).\n\nKroger Precision Marketing (KPM), a division of The Kroger Co. focused on connecting brand partners with shoppers and supported by its 84.51Â° data analytics subsidiary, is making first-party purchase-based audience data available directly in the Yahoo DSP.\n\nAs a result, Yahoo DSP advertisers that are also KPM users can target Kroger customers with advertising and measure campaign results without using third-party tracking cookies, which are set to fully deprecate in leading browsers at the beginning of 2025.\n\nFacilitated by Yahoo ConnectID, Yahoo DSP advertisers can activate purchase-based audience data from KPM and then use the KPM platform to attribute store sales to media exposures from the Yahoo DSP.\n\nThis new partnership marks the second time Kroger has partnered with a DSP to to open its customers to targeted ads. In November 2023, the grocery giant teamed up with leading DSP The Trade Desk to let advertisers activate Kroger audiences directly in their existing Trade Desk seats, including display, online video and connected TV.\n\nAt the time, KPM said it was planning to expand to other demand-side and buying platforms in the future.\n\nKroger Co. created Kroger Precision Marketing in 2017, in an effort to apply data science to better connect CPG brands with relevant households. The retail media network sells self-service advertising on Kroger digital properties, managed-service advertising through publisher collaborations, and programmatic advertising through its private marketplace.\n\n[Read more: Kroger expands retail media network to connected TV, video]\n\n\"Advertisers on average see 6.5x higher return-on-ad-spend when using our precision audiences,\" said Cara Pratt, senior VP of Kroger Precision Marketing. \"By expanding our availability through the Yahoo DSP, weâre delivering even more meaningful messages and measurable brand impact.\"\n\n\"Using first-party data is crucial to future-proof against third-party cookie deprecation, and applying Krogerâs retail data will help to ensure addressability for our advertisers,\" said Elizabeth Herbst-Brady, chief revenue officer at Yahoo. \"This new offering not only reinforces our privacy-safe approach, but also demonstrates our commitment to interoperability and allows advertisers to activate high-quality data across campaigns through the Yahoo DSP.\"\n\nBased in Cincinnati, Kroger operates 2,800 stores, including more than 100 stores in Southeast Texas and Louisiana, under a variety of banners across the U.S., including Kroger, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, Dillons, Smith's, King Soopers, Fry's, QFC, City Market, Owen's, Jay C, Pay Less, Baker's, Gerbes, Harris Teeter, Pick 'n Save, Metro Market and Mariano's.\n\nYahoo ConnectID, part of Yahoo Identity Solutions, reaches 205 million authenticated users in the U.S. from consented consumer relationships and partners."
