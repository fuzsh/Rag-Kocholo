        "text": "Did you know that entrepreneur Mark Cuban made his first billion on Yahoo?\n\nYahoo bought his Internet television and radio company Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion in April 1999. Fortunately for Cuban -- but unfortunately for Yahoo -- Broadcast.com was purchased around its peak.\n\nThe service, which simulcast TV and radio programming on the Internet, was way ahead of its time. Dial-up connections were too slow to play live video, and Broadcast.com lacked compelling content.\n\nYahoo eventually broke up Broadcast.com into various streaming media businesses, none of which exist today."
