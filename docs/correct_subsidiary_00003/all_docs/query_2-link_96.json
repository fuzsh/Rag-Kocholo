That comes after the maker of Monopoly games, Peppa Pig, Play-Doh, and Dungeons & Dragons already cut 800 jobs earlier this year.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nCEO Chris Cocks said toy sales had been disappointing so far this year — and continued to disappoint into the holiday season, the Journal reported, citing the memo.\n\n\"The market headwinds we anticipated have proven to be stronger and more persistent than planned,\" Cocks wrote in the memo. \"While we're confident in the future of Hasbro, the current environment demands that we do more.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of other companies have made significant reductions to staff this year: Tech companies, including Meta and Google, and finance behemoths, like Goldman Sachs, announced big layoffs in the first weeks of 2023 amid worries about the economy.\n\nThe downsizing followed significant reductions that companies, including Meta and Twitter, made toward the end of last year.\n\nAccording to data from Layoffs.fyi, a site tracking layoffs since the start of the pandemic, tech companies slashed more than 257,000 jobs in 2023 alone — compared to during the pandemic, when they cut 80,000 in March to December 2020 and 15,000 in 2021.\n\nHere are notable job cuts so far in 2023:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHasbro is cutting about 20% of its workforce, its CEO said in a memo.\n\nHasbro CEO Chris Cocks blamed slow sales so far this year when announcing layoffs of about 1,100 staffers — or around 20% of the toymaker's workforce — The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing a memo to staff.\n\nHe noted that toy sales hit \"historic\" highs during the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpotify: about 1,500 more employees\n\nSpotify notified employees that it was conducting a third round of layoffs on Monday in an email sent by CEO Daniel Ek. He wrote that 17% of its staff would be let go — the largest cut Spotify has made so far in 2023.\n\n\"Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive,\" Ek said in his email to employees and blog post. \"Spotify is not an exception to these realities.\"\n\nAccording to documents viewed by BI, people were selected to be laid off based on: \"a combination of factors including but not limited to organizational design, such as duplication of roles, streamlining layers to ensure efficiency, and optimizing our organization for the next chapter of Spotify.\"\n\nIn June, Spotify announced that the music and podcast streaming app would lay off about 200 employees, or 2% of its workforce. The layoffs impacted employees across Spotify's podcasting business and its supporting functions, including talent acquisition and financial roles, a Spotify spokesperson told Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCitigroup: hundreds of jobs\n\nBanking giant Citigroup started planned layoffs in November after CEO Jane Fraser announced a corporate overhaul in September. A final number of how many will be affected by the cuts hasn't been disclosed yet, but sources told CNBC the bank could let go of \"at least 10% in several major businesses.\"\n\nAccording to its 2022 annual report, Citigroup has recently employed about 240,000 employees. The layoffs are a part of a larger corporate overhaul spear-headed by Fraser, and Citigroup stock rose 2% in September following the reorganization announcement.\n\n\"We've acknowledged the actions we're taking to reorganize the firm involve some difficult, consequential decisions, but they're the right steps to align our structure to our strategy and deliver the plan we shared at our 2022 Investor Day,\" a company spokesperson told BI.\n\nEarlier this year, Citi announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs, with many focused on the company's investment bank division.\n\nIn January, Citi's CFO told investors the company remained \"focused on simplifying the organization, and we expect to generate further opportunities for expense reduction in the future.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon: 180 in its gaming division\n\nAmazon Games is cutting just over 180 roles, according to a memo sent to employees on Monday.\n\nAs part of the changes, the gaming division is closing its Crown Channel and Game Growth initiatives and refocusing on Prime Gaming.\n\n\"After our initial restructuring in April, it became clear that we needed to focus our resources even more on the areas that are growing with the highest potential to drive our business forward,\" Amazon's VP of Games, Christoph Hartmann, wrote in the memo, which was shared with Insider.\n\nAmazon announced on March 20 that it would cut 9,000 jobs from its workforce over the coming weeks. The cuts came on the heels of the 18,000 roles the company announced it was cutting back in January.\n\nIn a message to employees shared on Amazon's site, CEO Andy Jassy noted that the impacted positions are largely in the Amazon Web Services, People Experience and Technology Solutions, Advertising, and Twitch departments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles Schwab: 5% to 6% of its staff\n\nCharles Schwab let go of 5% to 6% of its total number of employees last month.\n\nAlthough an exact number hasn't been disclosed as far as the company's staff cuts, Charles Schwab had about 35,900 employees as of September 30, according to a corporate fact sheet.\n\nThe reduction, which comes out to between 1,795 to 2,154 people, comes amid cost-cutting efforts as Charles Schwab's stock recovers from the depths of its losses so far this year.\n\nA spokesperson for the company confirmed to Insider that the layoffs were a part of its plan to \"remove cost and complexity from our organization.\"\n\n\"These were hard but necessary steps to ensure Schwab remains highly competitive, with industry-leading levels of efficiency, well into the future. They are decisions that impact very talented people personally, and we take that very seriously,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStack Overflow: 28% of its staff\n\nChandrasekar attributed the cuts to \"macroeconomic pressures impacting the entire tech industry\" as the company focuses on profitability amid a drop in online traffic.\n\n\"This year we took many steps to spend less.\"CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar wrote in his blog post. \"Changes have been pursued through the lens of minimizing impact to the lives of Stackers. Unfortunately, those changes were not enough and we have made the extremely difficult decision to reduce the company's headcount by approximately 28%.\"\n\nCompanies are looking to AI for coding help, but the Stack Overflow CEO has faith in the human element in his company, and it's also launched its own AI-based tool. Many AI companies used Stack Overflow's data to train AI in coding, something that the company is now looking to be compensated for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlexport: up to 30% of its workforce\n\nThe logistics company said it would be laying off up to 30% of its workforce toward the end of October. The pending layoffs follow a series of cost-cutting measures that Flexport has made since Ryan Petersen returned as CEO in September, following Dave Clark's departure.\n\n\"Ryan has been very transparent in the need to drive the growth and cost discipline required to return Flexport to profitability,\" a spokesperson for Flexport told Insider by email. \"We will do so in a way that doesn't impact customer service and our ability to help grow our customers' businesses. We won't be commenting on specific details with regard to employee reductions.\"\n\nThis is the second round of cuts for Flexport this year. The company laid off about 20% of its workforce in January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpic Games: about 830 employees\n\nEpic Games is laying off 16% of its workforce and selling its music platform, CEO Tim Sweeney announced on September 28.\n\nSweeney told employees that the company would be divesting from Bandcamp and spinning off most of its SuperAwesome digital media services.\n\n\"For a while now, we've been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators,\" Sweeney wrote. \"Success with the creator ecosystem is a great achievement, but it means a major structural change to our economics.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoku: 10% of workforce\n\nRoku said it will limit new hires and lay off 10% of its estimated 3,600 employees in company-wide restructuring.\n\nAlthough the company was riding high during the pandemic, it's experienced quarterly losses dating back to 2022. In July, Roku posted a $107.6 million loss, according to the AP.\n\nRoku cut 200 roles, or 6% of its workforce, Reuters reported on March 30. The cuts came after the streaming device manufacturer previously laid off 200 employees in November 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarmers Insurance: 2,400 roles\n\nFarmers Insurance said in late August that it was laying off 2,400 employees or about 11% of its workforce in a press release.\n\n\"Given the existing conditions of the insurance industry and the impact they are having on our business, we need to take decisive actions today to better position Farmers for future success,\" Raul Vargas, the CEO and president of the company, said in the release.\n\nThe company said that the cuts will affect all lines of business and are part of actions to improve its long-term profitability and efficiency.\n\nVargas said in the release, \"As our industry continues to face macroeconomic challenges, we must carefully manage risk and prudently align our costs with our strategic plans for sustainable profitability.\"\n\nHe added, \"Our leaner structure will make us more nimble and better able to pursue opportunities for growth and ultimately make Farmers more responsive to the needs of our insured customers and agents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nT-Mobile: 5,000 US jobs\n\nThe mobile carrier is laying off just under 7% of its total employees in wave of cuts that are expected to be made by September.\n\nIn his letter, Sievert cited T-Mobile's efforts to compete with rivals in attracting new customers. Its most recent quarterly earnings report revealed that sales were down 2.5% year-over-year and net customer additions fell.\n\n\"What it takes to attract and retain customers is materially more expensive than it was just a few quarters ago,\" Sievert said in the letter. \"This is a company and team that looks around corners, that anticipates change and stays ahead of it.\"\n\nSievert added that affected employees can expect to receive \"competitive severance packages,\" career transition services, and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCVS: 5,000 jobs\n\nThe pharmacy giant is axing 5,000 jobs in a cost-cutting push. The cuts will impact employees in corporate roles, while those in customer-facing roles in CVS pharmacies, stores, clinics, and customer service centers are not likely to be impacted, the company said in a statement to Insider.\n\nIn an internal memo that was sent to staff and viewed by the Wall Street Journal, the company's chief executive Karen Lynch said the cuts would help CVS \"be at the forefront of a once-in-a-generation transformation in health care.\"\n\nIn addition to the layoffs, CVS is also reducing travel budgets and its use of external consultants in an effort to cut costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBinance: More than 1,000 jobs\n\nBinance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, cut over 1,000 people from its workforce in July, the Wall Street Journal reports. The cuts come after the SEC filed a lawsuit against the company in June, alleging that it operated as an unlicensed crypto exchange.\n\nThe cuts, which are ongoing, could whittle down Binance's staff by at least a third, a person familiar with the cuts told the Journal.\n\nEven before the SEC's suit the exchange was considering staff cuts to prepare for the next bull cycle and evaluate its \"talent density,\" a Binance spokesperson told Insider.\n\n\"As we prepare for the next major bull cycle, it has become clear that we need to focus on talent density across the organization to ensure we remain nimble and dynamic,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe statement came after a series of tweets from independent journalist Colin Wu on May 31 that indicated forthcoming layoffs at the company.\n\n\"This is not a case of rightsizing, but rather, re-evaluating whether we have the right talent and expertise in critical roles,\" the Binance statement continued. \"This will include looking at certain products and business units to ensure our resources are allocated properly to reflect the evolving demands of users and regulators.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNiantic: About 230 jobs\n\nNiantic CEO John Hanke announced that the AR gaming company would be laying off about 230 employees in June.\n\nHanke informed employees that the company would sunset its basketball game, \"NBA All-World,\" and stop development of an unreleased superhero game \"Marvel: World of Heroes.\"\n\nThe company will also close a Los Angeles studio, he said.\n\n\"In the wake of the revenue surge we saw during Covid, we grew our headcount and related expenses in order to pursue growth more aggressively,\" Hanke wrote. \"Post Covid, our revenue returned to pre-Covid levels and new projects in games and platform have not delivered revenues commensurate with those investments.\"\n\nHe added that Niantic is still confident about the potential of the augmented and mixed reality space, and pointed to Meta and Apple's commitments to their respective headsets as a reason the industry should be optimistic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinhood: About 7% of the workforce\n\nRobinhood, a stock-trading app, is laying off around 150 of its full-time employees, The Wall Street Journal first reported. The job cuts will amount to about 7% of Robinhood's workforce — adding to the more than a thousand jobs the company has cut since last year.\n\nRobinhood's Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick, wrote that the layoffs were done to \"adjust to volumes and to better align team structures,\" according to an internal company message obtained by the Journal.\n\n\"We're ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload, org design, and more.\" a Robinhood spokesperson told Insider in an emailed statement.\n\nThe spokesperson did not respond to Insider's questions asking about how many employees would face layoffs, and what positions would be impacted.\n\nThis marks the third workforce reduction the company has undergone since last year. In 2022, Robinhood went through two rounds of layoffs in April and August which axed more than a thousand positions of its then 3,800 employees. The company cited these earlier layoffs as necessary to cut costs and eliminate duplicate roles that resulted from the company undergoing rapid hiring.\n\nThe layoffs at Robinhood followed a ballooning period of stock trading and hiring at the company during the Covid-19 pandemic, Insider previously reported. But trading has only declined since then, as stimulus checks have dried up and inflation rates climbed, granting people fewer disposable income for trading.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFord: anticipated layoffs\n\nFord said it would undergo layoffs that would mainly impact engineering positions based in the US and Canada.\n\nA spokesperson for Ford declined to say how many employees would be laid off this week, when Insider asked for comment. The layoffs would mostly impact engineering roles in the US and Canada, the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe recent round of layoffs at Ford are part of the company's Ford+ growth plan that was introduced in 2021, the spokesperson told Insider. Part of this plan focuses on expanding the company's electric vehicles sales, CNBC reported.\n\n\"Delivering on the plan includes adjusting staffing to match focused priorities and ambitions, while raising quality and lowering costs,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to Insider, when asked about the reasoning for the layoffs.\n\nThe layoffs will impact employees in each of Ford's business divisions, including its Ford Blue unit, its Model e electric vehicle division, and its Ford Pro services, CNBC reported.\n\nThis layoff follows reductions the company made last year. In August, Ford laid off around 3,000 employees — a part of the company's plans to restructure the company's attention on electric vehicles.\n\nBut the layoffs in the car industry are also distinct from those spreading across other industries, Insider previously reported. As more automakers shift to electric vehicles, more layoffs are anticipated across the industry. But while these changes signal some jobs will no longer exist in the industry, new positions will also be created as more automakers move in this direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSonos: About 7% of the workforce\n\nIn a June 14 filing, Sonos disclosed it would be laying off around 7% of its workforce, or 130 people.\n\n\"In the face of continued headwinds we have had to make some hard choices, including eliminating some positions and reevaluating program spend,\" the company's CEO Patrick Spence said in a statement.\n\nThe cuts come a month after the company announced a 24% drop in revenue for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the second quarter of 2022. At the time, company cited softening demand and reduced its earnings guidance for the rest of the year, causing its stock to take a hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrubhub: Around 400 jobs\n\nGrubhub CEO Howard Migdal told staff that the food-delivery company would be laying off about 400 jobs on June 12 — or about 15% of its workforce.\n\nThe cuts impacted Grubhub's corporate office, as the company's operating and staff costs have increased at a faster rate than its business over the past few years, the memo said.\n\n\"We operate in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry,\" Migdal wrote. \"There is no doubt whatsoever that we have a solid foundation in place and an immense opportunity ahead of us – but it is also clear that we need to make some tough decisions in order to maintain our competitiveness.\"\n\nGrubhub has struggled to keep up with the likes of DoorDash and Uber Eats, and it is now the third biggest delivery operator in the US, according to Bloomberg Second Measure. The company has had three CEOs over the last two years, and its owner, Dutch conglomerate Just Eat Takeaway.com, tried to sell the firm less than a year after purchasing it.\n\nMeanwhile, more customers are turning away from food delivery, overall, in an attempt to save money and avoid sky-high fees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJPMorgan: About 500 jobs\n\nJPMorgan announced on March 26 that it is slashing 500 roles, CNBC reported.\n\nThe cuts are expected to spread across JPMorgan's retail and commercial banking, asset and wealth management, and corporate and investment banking operations, according to CNBC.\n\nThe reported layoffs come just a day after reports that JPMorgan laid off 1,000 First Republic employees, or about 15% of its workforce. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the US, got even larger earlier this month when it acquired the assets of failing First Republic after it was seized by regulators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinkedIn: 716 roles\n\nLinkedIn announced earlier this month that it would be cutting 716 roles from its global workforce in a message from CEO Ryan Roslansky.\n\nRoslansky also noted that company will also be discontinuing InCareer, a local jobs app in China, as it refocuses on helping companies in China hire, market, and train abroad.\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of LinkedIn's 20th anniversary last week.\n\n\"While we're making meaningful progress creating economic opportunities for our members and customers and experiencing record engagement on the platform, we're also seeing shifts in customer behavior and slower revenue growth,\" Roslansky said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShopify: 20% of workforce\n\nShopify is slashing 20% of its workforce and selling off most of its logistics business to supply chain company Flexport, the company announced on May 4.\n\nThe cuts confirmed growing concern of layoffs among staffers in recent weeks, following the cancellation of several team-building offsite events and analyst speculation that Shopify would alter its logistics arm, Insider reported.\n\n\"I recognize the crushing impact this decision has on some of you, and did not make this decision lightly,\" Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke said in a note to employees and shareholders.\n\nHe continued: \"This is a consequential and hard week. It's the right thing for Shopify but it negatively affects many team members who we admire and love working with.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorgan Stanley: 3,000 jobs\n\nMorgan Stanley is cutting 3,000 jobs by the end of the quarter, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. One person told the outlet that the company's banking and trading teams will be most impacted.\n\nThe cuts will affect about 5% of the firm's workforce, excluding financial advisers and personnel in the wealth management division, Bloomberg noted.\n\nA spokesperson for the bank did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment and declined to comment to Bloomberg. However, CEO James Gorman noted last month that underwriting and mergers activity has been \"subdued\" and that he doesn't expect a rebound before the second half of 2023 or even 2024, Bloomberg noted.\n\nThe firm last cut 1,600, or around 2% of its staff in December, Bloomberg noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDropbox: 16% of staff\n\nCloud storage firm Dropbox said Thursday that it would be reducing its global workforce by 16%, or 500 jobs.\n\nIn a message to staff sent Thursday, CEO Drew Houston said the cuts are being made, in part, from slowing business growth and the expansion of AI products.\n\n\"Today's changes were the result of taking a hard look at our strategic priorities and organizational structure as a leadership team, and aligning to principles of sustainable financial growth, efficiency, and flexibility to invest in our future. We're also streamlining how the company is organized,\" Houston said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGap: more than 2,000 jobs since late last year\n\nClothing retailer Gap is cutting 1,800 positions in its headquarters and upper management as part of a restructuring plan meant to cut costs, the retailer said Thursday.\n\nGap said that the cuts are expected to help the company see $300 million in annualized savings.\n\n\"We are taking the necessary actions to reshape Gap Inc. for the future — simplifying and optimizing our operating model, elevating creativity, and driving better delivery in every dimension of the customer experience,\" the company's chairman and interim CEO Bob Martin said in a statement given to Insider.\n\nIn September, Gap slashed 500 jobs from its corporate ranks in a push to save $250 million annually, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny Craig: potential mass layoffs\n\nWeight loss company Jenny Craig notified staffers of potential mass layoffs on April 27, as a result of the company \"winding down physical operations,\" according to an internal email reviewed by NBC News.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the company has been in the process of selling and anticipates the pending sale \"will likely impact all employees in some manner,\" an FAQ document sent to employees read.\n\n\"We do not know the exact employees/groups whom will be impacted, and if any employees may be retained,\" the document said, per NBC News. \"As a result, we would suggest that you anticipate that your employment may be impacted and begin to seek other employment.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3M: 6,000 jobs\n\nOn Tuesday, the Scotch tape and Post-It Notes manufacturer said it will be cutting 6,000 positions across all parts of the company with the goal of streamlining operations, simplifying supply chain, and reducing layers of management, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe company's chief executive Mike Roman said Tuesday that the cuts would eliminate 10% of 3M's global workforce and ultimately save the company between $700 to $900 million in pretax costs, the Journal said.\n\n3M last announced cuts in January when it said it was removing 2,500 manufacturing positions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLyft: 1,072 roles\n\nIn an SEC filing on Thursday, Lyft said it was cutting roles for 1,072 employees, or about 26% of its corporate workforce.
