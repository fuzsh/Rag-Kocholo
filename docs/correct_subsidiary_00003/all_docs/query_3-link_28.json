        "text": "Yahoo Sports is increasing its soccer content ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\nYahoo Sports and —the Germany-based global soccer media platform backed by top soccer clubs including Real Madrid, Manchester City and FC Bayern Munich—have agreed to create a new hub for soccer content.\n\nThrough the partnership, OneFootball’s news and analysis from leagues and competitions worldwide will be delivered to Yahoo Sports’ approximately 90 million users. The co-branded Yahoo Sports-OneFootball hub will also provide soccer coverage from OneFootball’s library of original and partner content and its 24/7 newsroom, which operates in six languages.\n\n“OneFootball will become our soccer destination within the U.S. across the web, mobile web and our sports app,” Yahoo Sports’ president Ryan Spoon said in a video call. “We want all soccer and to build a robust experience there that is as good, if not better, than the other sports we service.”\n\nYahoo Sports views soccer as a place for strategic growth, especially with North America hosting several major soccer tournaments over the next four years: Copa América in 2024, the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 and the FIFA 2026 World Cup (together with Canada and Mexico).\n\n“We aspire to be the best place in the U.S. to deliver those relationships and traffic, and therefore, that’s a win for potential advertisers,” Spoon said. “Yahoo’s really good at monetization and platform historically and currently. We do that on-site, off-site, and with tons of partners.”\n\nFounded in 2008, OneFootball partners with more than 200 soccer clubs, leagues, federations, players and broadcasters to bring its content to hundreds of markets worldwide. Shareholders include top European soccer clubs, including Arsenal, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid.\n\nThe partnership enables the German company, which is advised by Moelis & Company LLC, to reach new audiences in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n“Our club advisory board [is] super excited because they all want organic reach in the space,” Patrick Fischer, CEO of OneFootball, said in a video call. “It is also interesting for the clubs and us as a commercial opportunity. Because football is the biggest sport on the planet and generates billions of revenues yearly, we will want to profit from it.”\n\nThis is not the first North American partnership for OneFootball. The company agreed to a content-sharing partnership with the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) in 2022, including content created during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The partnership delivers content from CONCACAF tournaments to OneFootball’s media platforms.\n\nBefore the CONCACAF deal, the company raised €300 million ($325 million) in a series D financing round led by Liberty City Ventures and included participation from Animoca Brands, Dapper Labs, DAH Beteiligungs GmbH, Quiet Capital, RIT Capital Partners, Senator Investment Group and Alsara Investment Group in May 2022.\n\nThe Yahoo Sports-OneFootball soccer hub will debut in the summer, and new content offerings will be announced later."
