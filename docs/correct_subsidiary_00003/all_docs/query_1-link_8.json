        "text": "About Yahoo News's Bias Rating\n\nYahoo News is featured on the AllSides Media Bias Chart™.\n\nYahoo News is a news media source with an AllSides Media Bias Rating™ of Lean Left.\n\nYahoo News is a news website that originated as an internet-based news aggregator by Yahoo, according to Wikipedia. By 2011, Yahoo expanded its focus to include original content.\n\nWhat a \"Lean Left\" Rating Means\n\nSources with an AllSides Media Bias Rating of Lean Left display media bias in ways that moderately align with liberal, progressive, or left-wing thought and/or policy agendas. A Lean Left bias is a moderately liberal rating on the political spectrum.\n\nLearn more about Lean Left ratings\n\nBias Reviews\n\nWe use multiple methods to analyze sources. Learn how we rate media bias.\n\nAllSides Media Bias Analysis: Yahoo! News Curation Favors Media Outlets on the Left\n\nYahoo News Rated Lean Left in July 2021 AllSides Blind Bias Survey\n\nYahoo Moved from Left to Lean Left Following September 2019 Editorial Review\n\nPolitical Bias of Yahoo's Audience\n\nYahoo Rated Left in August 2018 Editorial Review\n\nAllSides Media Bias Analysis: Yahoo! News Curation Favors Media Outlets on the Left\n\nIn April and May 2022, AllSides conducted a media bias analysis of Yahoo! News, finding that its content curation and homepage top stories greatly favored stories from media outlets on the left.\n\nAn analysis of 588 curated articles published by Yahoo! News over a 4-day period in April 2022 showed that 65% were from a media outlet that has a Left or Lean Left AllSides Media Bias Rating, and just 5% were from outlets AllSides rates as on the right. See how Yahoo! News compares to other aggregators.\n\nFurther, Yahoo! News’ homepage – when uncustomized by the reader – also favored the left. In a 10-day period in April 2022, 55% of the top 15 stories featured on Yahoo! News’ homepage were from outlets rated on the left, while just 1% were from outlets on the right.\n\nOut of the 150 stories AllSides analyzed from Yahoo! News’ homepage, only one story from an outlet rated on the right appeared – meaning that out of the 10 days analyzed, only once did an outlet on the right appear among the top 15 stories.\n\nThe top 10 most prominent outlets on Yahoo! News’ homepage encompassed 57% of the coverage on the days analyzed (85 of 150 stories).\n\nThe top 10 most prominent outlets published on Yahoo! News, in total, during the time frame analyzed, encompassed 64% of all coverage (379 out of 588 stories).\n\nRead the full report: AllSides Analysis: Yahoo! News Curation Favors Media Outlets on the Left.\n\nAllSides has found the majority of news aggregators analyzed Lean Left, including Google News, Apple News, and Bing News.\n\nYahoo News Rated Lean Left in July 2021 AllSides Blind Bias Survey\n\nIn the July 2021 AllSides Blind Bias Survey, in which people across the political spectrum rated original content from Yahoo News without knowing the source, the average rating was Lean Left.\n\nA total of 1,239 people rated the outlet’s bias. People in all bias categories were more likely to rate it as Lean Left than anything else. The second most common response among people who have a Right and Lean Right bias was Left. Among people who are Left, Lean Left, and Center, the second most common response was Center.\n\nYahoo Moved from Left to Lean Left Following September 2019 Editorial Review\n\nOn September 24, 2019, the multipartisan AllSides team conducted an Editorial Review of Yahoo News. We decided to shift Yahoo News' Media Bias Rating from Left to Lean Left.\n\nYahoo News content is personalized to the reader to some degree. One way we noticed this was through our CEO who loves Star Trek. Every time he opens Yahoo!, he sees headlines about the show! Each member of the AllSides team saw slightly different articles on the Yahoo homepage, though there was a lot of overlap in what was featured for all of us. We also used the Internet Archive Way Back Machine to see previous captures of the Yahoo News page, and those pages do not capture our individual preferences.\n\nYahoo News features both original reporting and content that is curated from partners. Media outlets including the New York Times, the Daily Beast, Reuters, National Review, Associated Press, and others were featured when we conducted our review. The AllSides team arrived at its media bias rating of Yahoo! by judging all of the news that Yahoo listed, regardless of whether it was Yahoo original content or if it came from another source. We made no distinction about the source of the news, but, like other news sites, considered what news was covered (or not covered), the headlines, the position of those articles on the page, and the content of the articles.\n\nAlthough a small majority of the AllSides community who voted (3,000 votes), agreed with our previous media bias rating of Left, our team had noticed anecdotally that Yahoo News had changed its news coverage and approach. We had personally become fans of The 360, one of their news services, so we decided to do a new, formal editorial review.\n\nWe were pleased to find that Yahoo News is less biased than it has been in the past. Yahoo News has shifted more towards the Center in recent years, though it is not balanced enough to warrant a Center rating. Some conservative media outlets and perspectives are represented on the site, though the site appears to favor news on topics commonly of interest to those on the left. The team agreed that Yahoo is not a far Left outlet, and that it does not employ sensationalism or extremism. We were happy to see that, in a media landscape where many outlets are becoming more extreme or biased, Yahoo is moving towards balance.\n\nThere was even some discussion about giving it a Center rating, but the consensus was that there is still some Left Leaning bias. The news industry in general is mostly comprised of Left media outlets, so it may be that Yahoo's curation reflects the majority of the landscape. Regardless of the reason, Yahoo's choice of article topics leans a little to the left. For the most part, right-leaning perspectives and issues of importance to people on the right are not represented as often.\n\nPolitical Bias of Yahoo's Audience\n\nA 2014 Pew Research Center study defining where news audiences fit on the political spectrum found 41% of Yahoo News! consumers are of mixed political persuasion, compared to 36% of web respondents; 24% of readers are mostly liberal, and 18% are mostly conservative.\n\nYahoo Rated Left in August 2018 Editorial Review\n\nAllSides previously rated Yahoo's media bias as Left. In August 2018, AllSides conducted an editorial review that included people from all over the political bias spectrum. We had a difficult time determining if Yahoo warranted a Lean Left or Left media bias rating. We decided on Left.\n\nAllSides noted that Yahoo's media bias was revealed not so much in how their original content is reported, but in what topics they report on and curate. At the time, we found that much of Yahoo!'s curated content came from the Huffington Post, ThinkProgress, and other Left-leaning outlets. We determined that Yahoo News is consistently Left, and they don't distinguish clearly between Opinion, hard news and aggregated content. Yahoo's media bias is largely revealed in the choices of what they choose to feature and aggregate.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCommunity Feedback\n\nFeedback does not determine ratings, but may trigger deeper review.\n\nAs of July 2024, people have voted on the AllSides Media Bias Rating for Yahoo News. On average, those who disagree with our rating think this source has a Lean Left bias.\n\nConfidence Level\n\nConfidence is determined by how many reviews have been applied and consistency of data.\n\nAs of July 2024, AllSides has high confidence in our Lean Left rating for Yahoo News. Two or more bias reviews have affirmed this rating or the source is transparent about bias.\n\nYahoo News Ownership and Funding\n\nFunding and ownership do not influence bias ratings. We rate the bias of content only.\n\nOwner: Verizon Communications\n\nYahoo News is owned by Yahoo, which is owned by Verizon Communications. Hans Vestberg is the chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications. Verizon has no majority stockholders.\n\nFinancing and ownership information last updated February 1, 2021"
