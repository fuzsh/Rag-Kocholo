        "text": "Let's be honest, there are so many social media platforms out there that it can be incredibly difficult for businesses to know where to spend their time and money. Heck, it's even hard to know which platforms to choose as a consumer.\n\nIn our Top 10 list below, we highlight the demographics and optimal uses for each social media platform, helping you choose the best sites for your business goals and target audience.\n\nBefore You Begin\n\nThe first step to choosing the right social platforms for your business is knowing your target audience. If it's been a while since you established or refreshed your target audience, utilize our Buyer Persona Worksheets to establish new ones. Next, you’ll need to determine your goals for social media. These goals could include increasing brand awareness, nurturing your customers, providing customer service, and generating sales or leads.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESS\n\nAs you browse our top social platforms list below, there are a few things to note:\n\nThese are not the top 10 best social media platforms overall. These are the social platforms businesses should use to best reach their target audience. There are many social media platforms that just aren't, and never will be, conducive to businesses, so we won't bother covering those.\n\nThe stats for each platform below are worldwide, not just in the United States. With the growth and expansion of technology and the international bridges formed as a result, it's important to know (especially if you sell services or products internationally) the whole picture.\n\nThe stats below are monthly active users on the platforms, not total users. We made this distinction because the total number of users per platform doesn't give you an idea of who’s actively using them. Most platforms have issues with single individuals creating multiple accounts, fake accounts, bots, etc. “Monthly active users\" tells us how many users are actively engaging on these platforms. We collected these monthly active user stats from Search Engine Journal, Statista, Pew Research Center, HubSpot, and Buffer.\n\nHERE ARE THE TOP SOCIAL PLATFORMS FOR BUSINESSES IN 2023\n\nThe top 10 social media platforms for businesses are:\n\nFacebook\n\nYouTube\n\nInstagram\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTikTok\n\nSnapchat\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLet's look at these 10 social platforms more in-depth.\n\n1.
