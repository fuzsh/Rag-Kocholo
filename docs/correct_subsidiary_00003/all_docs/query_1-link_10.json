Here is what it says on their grids page:\n\nDefault Media Queries\n\nWhen using Responsive Grids, you can control how the grid behaves at specific breakpoints by adding class names. Pure's default responsive grids comes with the following class names and media query breakpoints.\n\nSo I want to add some custom handling at the \"xl\" breakpoint. How do I do that? Also, how do I know which class to put my content into? I have used media queries before. I just can't quite wrap my head around how they did it here."
