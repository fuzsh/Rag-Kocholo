        "text": "G. E. M. Anscombe (1919–2001) is one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century. Known primarily for influencing research in action theory and moral philosophy, her work also has relevance in the study of metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, and politics.\n\nThe Anscombean Mind provides a comprehensive survey of Anscombe’s thought, not only placing it in its historical context but also exploring its enduring significance in contemporary debates. Divided into three clear parts, twenty-three chapters by an international array of contributors address the following themes:\n\nancient philosophy\n\nmetaphysics\n\nmind and language\n\nWittgenstein\n\naction and ethics\n\npolitics\n\nreligion and faith.\n\nThe Anscombean Mind is an indispensable resource for anyone studying and researching action theory, ethics, moral philosophy, Wittgenstein, twentieth-century philosophy, and Anscombe herself.\n\nIntroduction Adrian Haddock and Rachael Wiseman\n\n1.
