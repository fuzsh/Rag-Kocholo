The Anscombe Forum on Human Dignity\n\nJohn Mizzoni\n\nOn March 13-14, 2015, my Neumann University colleagues and I hosted a conference on Neumann’s campus that explored the work of G.E.M. Anscombe as it relates to the subject of human dignity. In the year prior, we initiated the Anscombe Forum with a conference on the topic of Anscombe’s contributions to the Catholic intellectual tradition. At the 2014 Anscombe Forum, the conference participants examined a wide range of themes from Anscombe’s work, including personhood, the soul, the will, and the doctrine of double effect, among other topics. Some papers explored how Anscombe’s Catholic faith influenced her approach to philosophy and how her Catholic faith influenced the types of philosophical issues with which she dealt. ¹\n\nThe papers in the present volume explore the concept of human dignity. Part II examines the nature of human dignity, with special focus on Anscombe’s perspective, while the papers in Part III proceed to explore the implications of human dignity for doing applied ethics, specifically regarding the issues of euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, abortion, and physical disability.\n\nI thank the presenters at the 2015 Anscombe Forum for contributing to the conference and contributing their finalized papers to this volume. I also thank the chairs of the conference sessions,² the staff of Neumann University,³ and Gerard O’Sullivan, formerly the Vice President for Academic Affairs at Neumann, who provided much support for both Anscombe Forums.\n\nThe plenary speaker at the 2015 Anscombe Forum was Duncan Richter, the author of Anscombe’s Moral Philosophy (2010).⁴ In Richter’s paper below, The Meaning of Human Dignity, which opens Part II on the nature of human dignity, Richter argues that Anscombe’s work can help shed light on the topic of human dignity. He first surveys the idea of human dignity as understood by John Stuart Mill, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Elizabeth Anscombe. He then discusses Anscombe’s understanding of connatural knowledge as it relates to human dignity.\n\nRichter continues by looking at some issues in applied ethics that Anscombe discusses in connection with the notion of human dignity—euthanasia, abortion, capital punishment, sex, and same-sex marriage. Following that, Richter discusses a contemporary account of dignity (Rosen 2012).⁵ Richter contends that to understand what human dignity means we need to think not only about words and concepts but about behavior—the application of these concepts in our lives. He reaches the conclusion that consideration of practical cases can shed light on the notion of human dignity, and that consideration of human dignity can shed light on practical cases, but that neither provides a key for knowing with certainty what we ought to do in every practical case.\n\nCandace Vogler, author of a forthcoming volume on the work of Anscombe, was the keynote speaker at the 2015 Anscombe Forum.⁶ In her keynote address, Vogler discusses Anscombe’s views about the value of human life. For Anscombe, human beings can be homely, disordered, and awful, says Vogler. Human beings have a fallen nature; and original sin is part of our physical inheritance. Anscombe believes that we can do something about our disorderly lives, however. We can change ourselves and decide how we should live. This shows something special about us. For Anscombe, human beings are created by God and seek a union with God. There is a sanctity to human life and we should revere human life as such.\n\nThrough God’s acts, we can know these truths about the value of human life, says Vogler. Yet formulating an account of the sanctity of human life that does not make reference to divinity is a more difficult task, she cautions. However, Vogler explains that by drawing from Aquinas on human nature, natural law, and pagan virtue we can begin to have some resources to say why it is that we should have reverence for our fellow human beings even without adverting to theological accounts of our place in creation.\n\nThe next paper, by Bryan Pilkington, explores the Christian account of dignity defended by Gilbert Meilaender. Anscombe’s insight about the respect we should have for noncombatants would seem to lead us in the direction of identifying the essential aspects of dignity, thinks Pilkington. As Pilkington argues however, dignity is a complex concept. There are meritorious elements of dignity, but also egalitarian elements of dignity. Pilkington argues that both aspects are needed. In addition, Pilkington observes a difference between human dignity and personal dignity. Because of the complexity of the concept of dignity, it is not surprising to Pilkington that there have been so many challenges to the concept of dignity, both its religious and non-religious versions.\n\nAfter a detailed investigation of Meilaender’s attempt to bring together the different aspects of dignity, Pilkington concludes that Meilaender’s account is not an ultimately coherent account of dignity.\n\nFrom Anscombe’s writings, it is clear that she upholds a religious interpretation of dignity, for she has written that we ought to have respect for that dignity of human nature so wonderfully created by God.⁷ Hershenov’s paper opens part III, on human dignity and applied ethics, and he examines two non-religious accounts of dignity: Velleman’s and Dworkin’s. With their theories of human dignity, Velleman and Dworkin propose to justify euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. Hershenov, though, determines that both accounts of dignity are unsatisfactory in identifying what dignity really is. Hershenov claims to argue instead for an account of dignity more in line with the tradition that Anscombe belonged to, where our value depends upon the kind of entity we are and thus what ends we ought to realize.\n\nIn the next essay, Cavanaugh also takes a position in line with Anscombe. In Anscombe’s view, voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) cannot be supported by an appeal to the dignity of human freedom, even though advocates of VAE commonly attempt to do so. Cavanaugh agrees with Anscombe that such actions are really inconsistent with the dignity of self-rule.\n\nCavanaugh further describes a common claim of advocates of VAE: they assert that we treat dogs and cats better than we treat humans, because we are more inclined to euthanize our pets than human beings. Do we treat our pets better than our fellow humans as they lay dying? Cavanaugh asks. No, he argues. He discusses at least four good reasons that undermine the analogy of pet-euthanasia with person-euthanasia. While pet-euthanasia can be ethically justified, person-euthanasia cannot, he argues. Human dignity makes an important difference. Cavanaugh supports the position—as he thinks Anscombe would also—that those who employ the experience of pet-euthanasia to make a case for the supposed humaneness of VAE, in fact trivialize the gravity of homicide.\n\nRyan Cobb next examines Anscombe’s argument against abortion, which uses the concept of human dignity. Cobb tries to make the reasoning in Anscombe’s argument more explicit. A premise in Anscombe’s argument is that violations of human dignity are morally wrong. Cobb tries to spell out why this is so; part of his strategy is to describe various examples of violations of human dignity. He presses the point that violations of human dignity are not necessarily violations of autonomy. Additionally, by focusing on the example of sex-selective abortions, Cobb seeks to rebut several possible objections to Anscombe’s argument against abortion.\n\nIn the last paper of the volume, David DiQuattro investigates several of Anscombe’s statements about human dignity. DiQuattro notes that Anscombe emphasizes the dignity of human beings, not only the dignity of persons. The view that only persons possess dignity DiQuattro calls the personhood account of dignity, and he argues that it is tied to a consequentialist ethical approach with which Anscombe disagrees. DiQuattro seeks to bring out the insights Anscombe’s work holds for thinking about physical handicap and genetic testing.\n\nOverall, the essays reflect the difficulty, complexity, yet importance of the concept of human dignity. The essays also attest to the significance of the concept of dignity for many different kinds of ethical issues. Finally, by describing and in some cases defending both Anscombe’s incisive perspective and her moral commitment, they convey Anscombe’s important contributions to our understanding of the value of a human life.\n\n…\n\nPart 2\n\nOn the Nature of Dignity\n\n2. The Meaning of Human Dignity\n\nDuncan Richter\n\nIt is very difficult to say much about human dignity, but it seems worthwhile to try. I think that Anscombe’s work can help to shed light on the topic, especially through her recognition that we are both rational and embodied beings, through what she says about connatural knowledge, and through her comments on several specific issues in practical ethics. What follows is divided into four main parts: an initial survey of the idea of human dignity, a briefly discussion of connatural knowledge, a look at some relevant issues in applied ethics, and a final investigation of what it means to respect human dignity. My conclusion will be that consideration of practical cases can shed light on the notion of human dignity, and that consideration of human dignity can shed light on practical cases, but neither provides a key for knowing with certainty what we ought to do in every practical case.\n\nI. Human Dignity\n\nA certain respect seems proper to human beings. It is often thought that this has to do with the intellectual and moral powers that typical members of our species possess. John Stuart Mill refers to:\n\na sense of dignity, which all human beings possess in one form or other, and in some, though by no means in exact, proportion to their higher faculties, and which is so essential a part of the happiness of those in whom it is strong, that nothing which conflicts with it could be, otherwise than momentarily, an object of desire to them. (1993, pp. 9-10)\n\nAs Mill sees it, in one sense we know the superiority of our own, higher mode of existence by acquaintance. We know both, he suggests, what it is like to be wise and what it is like to be a fool, and we know that it is better to be wise. If a fool thinks otherwise it is because he only knows what it is like to be a fool. So greater knowledge leads us to prefer the life of a human being to the life of a pig. But in another sense we just do happen to desire this mode of existence, so it is a matter of arbitrary preference, not something grounded in knowledge. We desire it because it is such an essential part of our happiness. And this does not mean that it causes happiness as an effect. It constitutes our happiness, or an important part of it at least. A sense of dignity makes us unwilling to exchange a ‘higher’ manner of existence for another that might make us more content.\n\nAs Thomas Nagel has pointed out, there is something wrong with the idea that a human being knows what it is like to be a bat or a pig. A Nietzschean might add that human beings are bound to regard themselves as better than other species, but that it does not follow that this belief is anything other than fiction.\n\nOn the other hand, it is hard to dismiss Mill’s view completely. There is something nightmarish about the idea of choosing to become a fool or a pig simply for an increase in contentment. And it does seem that having experienced the pleasures of listening to good music or doing good deeds not only inclines us to prefer a life in which we enjoy such pleasures but also educates us about their value. This is relevant for the idea of connatural knowledge, which I will come to soon.\n\nThere is more to being human, though, than exercising the higher faculties. Indeed, it can seem that much lower considerations are really what is relevant. In a passage that has become well known, George Orwell says that he could not shoot at a man holding up his trousers:\n\nI had come here [viz., to Spain] to shoot at ‘Fascists’; but a man who is holding up his trousers isn’t a ‘Fascist’, he is visibly a fellow-creature, similar to yourself, and you don’t feel like shooting at him. (Orwell, n.d.)\n\nBeing a fellow-creature in Orwell’s sense does not require having higher faculties. In this case the fellowship is made visible by the man’s holding up his trousers. One might try to argue that this is symptomatic of other capacities, but I think that would be a stretch. That is, it would be a stretch to take holding up one’s trousers as essentially connected to rationality or having free will. Trouser-wearing itself, though, is clearly not what is essential here either. What matters is that the man holding up his trousers is the same kind of being as we are, one who lives the same kind of life as we do. What this amounts to would be hard to say precisely, and so Orwell’s point might seem vague and unpersuasive. But if we do not accept that Orwell has made the point sufficiently, Wittgenstein (1993) gives additional reasons to connect human dignity with lower, more physical aspects of our being:\n\nMutilate a human being all the way, cut off his arms & legs nose & ears & then see what remains of his self-respect & of his dignity & to what extent his concepts of such things still remain the same. We have no idea how these concepts depend on the ordinary, normal, condition of our body. What becomes of them when we are led by a leash with a ring through our tongues & tied-up? How much of a human being then remains in him? Into what sort of state"
