        "text": "May 12, 2021\n\nI don't read as much philosophy as I ought. In my studies at the JPII Institute, I encounter Anscombe quite a bit during lectures, but I had never read anything by her. So when I came across this book, I decided to check it out.\n\nIn retrospect, I wish I had read more of her \"official\" or \"famous\" work before taking on these papers. I enjoyed each one - some more than others - but didn't have much context for them in terms of her body of work. It is clear that she is a traditional Catholic (as am I) and much of what she said resonated with me. But many of her arguments are directed toward perspectives on sin and morality that were likely more commonly encountered in the past and have either been further developed or have become less relevant. Some papers stand the test of time in terms of truth, but not in terms of relevance for the reader. (Of course, this is not the case with her paper on contraception - it has stood the test of time and continues to be relevant.)\n\nI believe it would have been better for me to actually read something of hers that was more universally acclaimed. I also think that her writing is less accessible to most people because of the terminology and the depth of the philosophical rabbit-holes into which she plunges. A good read, but if I read something from her again I will seek something more \"classic\"."
