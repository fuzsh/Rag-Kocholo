This gives a sense in which certain values and disvalues can be called 'objective'. I suggest that, with certain relatively minor adjustments, her argument can be made cogent but that it cannot be used to show that there are objective answers to questions about what one should do when values conflict. If Foot's own virtue ethics, utilitarianism, Kantian ethics or any other first-order moral system were to be established as objectively valid, this would require some completely different form of argumentation.\n\nAlmost sixty years ago Philippa Foot published an article that began: To many people it seems that the most notable advance in moral philosophy during the past fifty years or so has been the refutation of naturalism; and they are a little shocked that at this late date such an issue should be reopened. It is easy to understand their attitude: given certain apparently unquestionable assumptions, it would be about as sensible to try to reintroduce naturalism as to try to square the circle. Those who see it like this have satisfied themselves that they know in advance that any naturalistic theory must have a catch in it somewhere, and are put out at having to waste more time exposing an old fallacy. This paper is an attempt to persuade them to look critically at the premises on which their arguments are based. 1 The paper in question was one of a number written by Foot around the time that were highly successful in reopening the issue of naturalism in ethics. Nowadays no one can just take it for granted that naturalism has been refuted, that there is a sharp distinction (or indeed any clear distinction) between fact and value or that it is impossible to derive an 'ought' from an 'is'. This is not to say that the naturalists have been completely victorious, of course; only that naturalism is today a live option. I shall argue that Foot's paper contains an important insight and an equally important mistake; and that the insight and the mistake are linked. I believe that the thinking behind it has influenced the subsequent course of moral philosophy to a quite remarkable extent and that this has been in some ways beneficial and in some ways harmful – not surprisingly, if I am right in seeing it as containing both truth and error. I do not want to exaggerate the influence of this one paper 2 but I do not know of any other that so neatly encapsulates the coupled insight and mistake. The anti-naturalism that Foot is attacking she characterises as follows: It would not be an exaggeration to say that the whole of moral philosophy, as it is now widely taught, rests on a contrast between statements of fact and evaluations, which runs something like this: The truth or falsity of statements of fact is shewn by means of evidence; and what counts as evidence is laid down in the meaning of the expressions occurring in the statement of fact … It follows that no two people can make the same statement and count completely different things as evidence; in the end one at least of them could be convicted of linguistic ignorance. It also follows that if a man is given good evidence for a factual conclusion he cannot just refuse to accept the conclusion on the ground that in his scheme of things this evidence is not evidence at all. 3 But, on the view she is criticising, [w]ith evaluations, however, it is different. An evaluation is not connected logically with the factual statements on which it is based. One man may say that a thing is good because of some fact about it, and another may refuse to take that fact as any evidence, for nothing is laid down in the meaning of 'good' which connects it with one piece of 'evidence' rather than another. It follows that a moral eccentric could argue to moral conclusions from quite idiosyncratic premises; he could say, for instance, that a man was a good man because he clasped and unclasped his hands and never turned NNE after\n\nThere are passages in Wittgenstein where he compares his method to psychotherapy and one or two where he seems to suggest that the ‘patient’ has the last word on his ‘illness’ and ‘cure’.

This paper tries to take these seriously, especially in connexion with the idea that victims of philosophical confusion talk nonsense.\n\nPhilosophical accusations of talking nonsense made in a polemical spirit are bound to fail, since the only way one can effectively criticise another’s utterance is by attaching some meaning to it. But if the other acknowledges the possibility that his puzzlement arises from his having been taken in by nonsense, then perhaps a co-operative investigation of this suggestion might be fruitful. Indeed self-diagnosis ought in principle to be possible. Ought it not to have happened at least once in the history of philosophy if philosophical nonsense has ever been exposed?\n\nBut there are difficulties. For example:\n\na) We must ask whether or not philosophical nonsense, when exposed as such, is supposed to lose all appearance of meaningfulness. Either answer is problematic.\n\nb) The acknowledged similarity of the methodology under investigation to that of psychoanalysis exposes it to many of the familiar objections to the methodology of psychoanalysis, especially those that draw attention to the misleading influence of suggestion by an authority-figure.\n\nc) The proposal that relentless cross-questioning of a suspected nonsense-talker will eventually lead her to ‘dry up’ (if she really is talking nonsense) seems to involve a version of the so-called Socratic Fallacy.\n\nModern philosophical spectators have often found fault with the ways in which miracles were received by the pre-modern peoples of Europe and the Mediterranean.

Historians such as Gibbon and philosophers as various as Hume and Lessing criticized the pre-modern world, implicitly or explicitly, for the epistemic significance that it ascribed to miracles. In various ways, these and so many other modern thinkers have suggested that miracles cannot play the role that the pre-modern world gave to them. In this paper I reflect on this notable disparity in the reception of miracles in modern and pre-modern times. The possible terms of its explanation is suggested in the view of Elizabeth Anscombe, who argues that the evidentiary significance that pre-modern people gave to miracles necessarily involves certain theological presuppositions. Supernaturally aberrant phenomena--supposing, contra Hume, that such phenomena really occurs--only constitutes a \"sign,\" Anscombe argues, when one already espouses some theistic framework in light of which such a phenomenal event can be interpreted to be a supernatural sign of attestation or authorization.\n\nAnscombe's view is that of a Catholic philosopher in dialogue--and as I suggest, in some degree of tension--with the magisterial teaching of Vatican I, which describes miracles as \"external signs\" that independently (and non-circularly) attest the truth of the Gospel and authorize the Church.\n\nThe thesis of this paper is that, while there are certain presuppositions involved when miracles (or \"supernatural phenomena\") are regarded as signs, they are not such as to threaten the externality that Vat. I ascribes to them. Thus, with an eye to giving an explanation for the disparate modern and premodern receptions of miracles, I draw on the work of the 19th-century German theologian, Matthias Joseph Scheeben, to identify the presuppositions that are sufficient and necessary in order to regard miracles as signs. The crucial presupposition, I propose, that explains the modern/premodern reception disparity is the reality of extrinsic authority. The significance of supernatural events, I suggest, is likely to be ambiguous in the modern, democratic West, because in this cultural circumstance the correlation of power and authority is no longer taken for granted as in other times and places, and the notion of extrinsic authority--an authority not derived from the \"consent of the governed\"--is generally and presumptively rejected."
