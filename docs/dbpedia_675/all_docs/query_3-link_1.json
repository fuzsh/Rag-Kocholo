        "text": "G. E. M. Anscombe, “Modern Moral Philosophy,” Philosophy 33, no. 124 (1958): 1–19.\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/3749051\n\nBefore you start reading the summary…\n\nThe influence that this article — or more correctly, this unrelenting attack — had on moral philosophy, especially the impetus it gave to virtue ethics, is difficult to overstate. (However, it is a matter of dispute whether that is the lesson the article intended to teach.) A bit of trivia: the term “consequentialism”, which is described derisively as a shallow philosophy (shallowness is a necessary feature, Anscombe adds!), is introduced in this article.\n\nFor somebody new to moral philosophy, the article will be a difficult read. Not only because Anscombe is engaging with moral philosophy since Aristotle up to the mid-twentieth century but also because she does it with frustrating brevity. She disposes off a procession of some of the most prominent moral philosophers, Joseph Butler, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, with a few terse paragraphs in less than a page! As such, I have added more than a few hyperlinks. The interested (and intrepid) student may follow them for more.\n\n[Analytic writing presents a certain difficulty for readers, especially uninitiated ones. It never belabours the point. And while the concise, rigorous, matter-of-fact arguments present themselves with, to invoke Hume — Anscombe also invokes Hume but for more philosophically pertinent reasons — force, they are sorely lacking in the vivacity which would beckon and then hold the interested but uneducated reader’s mind. Without philosophical literacy, analytic writing is difficult to follow and its beauty easy to miss.\n\nTo get a glimpse of such (beautiful) writing, and these are only the few that I have encountered, see Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus [Anscombe, in addition to being greatly influenced by, was actually friends with, Wittgenstein], Willard Van Orman Quine’s On What There Is and Two Dogmas of Empiricism [Quine can be both fun and funny], as well as Anscombe’s own Intention. These works, I might add, have been unfathomably influential.]\n\nThe divisions are my own. Commentaries can be skipped. So can the relevant extracts from other books to which Anscombe (explicitly or implicitly refers).\n\nAlright, lets get on…\n\nThree theses will be presented in the article.\n\nThe first is that it is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy; that should be laid aside at any rate until we have an adequate philosophy of psychology, in which we are conspicuously lacking.\n\nThe second is that the concepts of obligation, and duty — moral obligation and moral duty, that is to say — and of what is morally right and wrong, and of the moral sense of “ought,” ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible; because they are survivals, or derivatives from survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it.\n\nMy third thesis is that the differences between the well-known English writers on moral philosophy from Sidgwick to the present day are of little importance.\n\nI\n\nThe contrast between Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics and any modern work on moral philosophy is striking. Aristotle talks about moral virtues. But what he means by “moral” is very far from our notion of moral. So that, “If someone professes to be expounding Aristotle and talks in a modern fashion about “moral” such-and-such, he must be very imperceptive if he does not constantly feel like someone whose jaws have somehow got out of alignment: the teeth don’t come together in a proper bite.”\n\n[COMMENTARY 1: Being moral, for the modern mind, has come to be associated with right and wrong. For instance, in Christian morality (or ethics, the terms are interchangeable in this essay), the morally upright person abstains from extramarital sex. Where as the immoral person is promiscuous. Whatever their authority or source (religious authority, contract, reason, etc.), these ideas of right and wrong are, as it were, pre-given or already there for us. You either act in accordance with them (in which case you act morally) or violate them (in which case you act immorally).\n\nBut when Aristotle talks of “moral” virtues, what he has in mind has nothing to do with what has just been outlined. For him, “..moral excellence [or virtue] comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name [ethike] is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word for ‘habit’ [ethos (we get the word ethics and its cognates from this term!)].” (Quotations are from Book II of the Nicomachean Ethics.] Moral excellence is about acting or doing things well: defined as that which “must have the quality of aiming at the intermediate” and where there is neither excess nor defect. A moral person, in other words, is someone who excels that what he/she does. And excellence is, in an important way, connected to moderation. Consider the moral virtue of courage, one of the cardinal virtues for the Greeks: “the man who flies from and fears everything and does not stand his ground against anything becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet every danger becomes rash … courage, then, [is] destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by the mean.” (This is Aristotle’s infamous doctrine of the Mean, described by Bernard Williams as the “most celebrated and least useful” of Aristotle’s ideas.)\n\nWhatever the attractions or weaknesses of this notion of moral virtue as doing things well which requires that we stay away from excess and defect, and which can be acquired only by habit, it must be clear that reading the Nicomachean Ethics with the modern meaning of “moral” would cause terrible misalignment: the teeth won’t come together, as Anscombe puts it, in a proper bite. END OF COMMENTARY 1]\n\nAristotle cannot, therefore, elucidate the modern way of talking about morality. And the best writers on ethics in modern times fail to provide any “direct light on [morality]”.\n\n“[Joseph] Butler exalts conscience, but appears ignorant that a man’s conscience may tell him to do the vilest things.”\n\n“[David] Hume defines ‘truth’ in such a way as to exclude ethical judgments from it, and professes that he has proved that they are so excluded.\n\n“[Immanuel] Kant introduces the idea of ‘legislating for oneself,’ which is as absurd as if in these days, when majority votes command great respect, one were to call each reflective decision a man made a vote resulting in a majority, which as a matter of proportion is overwhelming, for it is always 1-0.\n\n“Bentham and Mill do not notice the difficulty of the concept ‘pleasure.’ … The reason is simple: since Locke, pleasure was taken to be some sort of internal impression. But it was superficial, if that was the right account of it, to make it the point of actions.\n\n[I wish I could go in depth into these terse paragraphs, but that would turn this summary into a commentary. And so I will not.]\n\nII\n\n“Suppose that I say to my grocer “Truth consists in either relations of ideas, as that 20s.[shillings] = £1, or matters of fact, as that I ordered potatoes, you supplied them, and you sent me a bill. So it doesn’t apply to such a proposition as that I owe you such-and-such a sum.”\n\nAll the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, relations of ideas and matters of fact. Of the first kind are the sciences of geometry, algebra, and arithmetic; and in short, every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain.\n\nMatters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality.\n\nDavid Hume, An Enquiry into Human Understanding, Chapter 4:1–2.\n\nIn every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark’d, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz’d to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, ’tis necessary that it shou’d be observ’d and explain’d; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention wou’d subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is pereciv’d by reason.\n\nDavid Hume, A Treatise on Human Nature, Book III, Part I, Section I.\n\n[COMMENTARY 2: In the paragraph quoted above, Anscombe is bringing together two very influential — although to say that they are merely influential would be a great understatement — ideas of David Hume. The first is his division of all human knowledge or understanding, or “all the objects of human reason or enquiry” into relations of ideas and matters of fact. This is also known as Hume’s fork. See the extract from the Enquiry.\n\nThe second is the is-ought problem (see the extract from the Treatise which argues that it is logically invalid to go from is statements, i.e. positive statements like “Human females evolved to take care of children” to ought statements, i.e. normative/evaluative statements statements like “Women ought to stay in the house and take care of children” [example from this explainlikeimfive post].\n\nIf we put this two ideas together, we conclude that it is invalid, to use the example Anscombe uses, to go from: I ordered potatoes, you supplied them, and you sent me a bill; to I owe you money. END OF COMMENTARY 2]\n\nThat’s to say, truth cannot properly be the attribute of evaluative statements, e.g. of statements like: I owe you money, but only of relations of ideas, e.g. of statements like: 20 shillings = 1 pound, or matters of fact, e.g. statements like: I ordered a sack of potatoes.\n\n[What follows is three paragraphs summarising another very influential paper, “On Brute Facts”. (See Sections 5 and 6 of the IEP entry on Anscombe. Also this video explanation by Carneades.org.)]\n\nBrute facts are those facts “which held, and in virtue of which, in a proper context, such-and-such a description [of a state of affairs] is true or false”. For the description — for instance, that I owe someone a certain amount of money — to be true, both the facts of the description — the facts: that I ordered potatoes, that you supplied them, that you sent me a bill etc. — and the context — the existence of certain exchange and market institutions — must hold. In a situation where all of these hold, we may call the facts of the description as brute relative to the description and the context. Having said this, it is possible that special circumstances — perhaps the exercise was part of an act in a movie, or perhaps the grocer decided to let me have them for free after he had sent the bill, etc. — will intervene to upset the truth of the description. That’s to say, if the description that I owe the grocer a certain sum of money were, for example, made in the context of an act in a movie, it would not be actually true that I owe the grocer that sum of money.\n\nThere are a number of points to be observed. First, given certain facts and a certain context, an evaluative/normative statement can be true. That’s to say, it is perfectly alright, contra Hume, to go from: I ordered potatoes, you supplied them, and you sent me a bill; to I owe you money. “It would be ludicrous to pretend that there can be no such thing as a transition, e.g. “is” to “owes”.\n\nSecond, brute facts are brute relative to some description [of a state of affairs, or fact] and some context. In other words, brute facts are always relative, they are not absolute. And it is brute facts along with a certain context (which can always be altered or rendered inapplicable by extraordinary circumstances and which therefore cannot be theoretically anticipated) which makes a description true. But moral philosophy is populated with notions such as theft, adultery, slander, and punishment of the innocent, to use her examples, which are conceived as always (or absolutely) wrong. Anscombe’s argument is that the description, for instance, that I should never steal does not hold true absolutely but holds only in the context of certain background institutions — property relations and ideas of ownership in this case, which can, as we have seen, be upset by extraordinary circumstances — and certain facts which are brute relative to that description and context.\n\nThird, and this has to do with the first thesis. There seems to be no good way of characterising acts apart from considering them as brute facts relative to other brute facts. That’s to say, the description I owe you money could be a brute fact relative to a further description, say, I am a bilker. Given a certain set of facts, and a certain context, it would be perfectly correct to call me a bilker. However, in this case, the concern is only factual (or brute factual, to invent a term). But this does not say anything about how bilking is unjust, and certainly not how this bilker, this unjust man if we assume that he is indeed an unjust man, is a bad man. So that, “[i]n present-day philosophy an explanation is required how an unjust man is a bad man, or an unjust action a bad one; to give such an explanation belongs to ethics; but it cannot even be begun until we are equipped with a sound philosophy of psychology.” [Thesis I]\n\nIII\n\nThe words ‘should’, ‘ought’ or ‘needs’ relate to good and bad — “machinery needs oil, or should or ought to be oiled, in that running without oil is bad for it, or it runs badly without oil”. Here, these words don’t have a moral sense. In this conception, the sentence “I should not steal” would have no special moral sense. But to us, this sentence does have a special moral sense in that the word ‘should’ implies an absolute verdict on the action that is described, i.e. that it is morally wrong to steal.\n\nHow did this come about? Because of the dominance of Christianity, in the time between Aristotle and us, with its law conception of ethics. “To have a law conception of ethics is to hold that what is needed for conformity with the virtues, failure in which is the mark of being bad qua man (and not merely, say, qua craftsman or logician [as Aristotle would hold]), is required by divine law.” Even if this conception based on divine law has now been abandoned, the special moral sense and weight which it bequeathed to the concepts of ‘obligation’ and of being bound or required as by a law has remained.\n\nIt is as if the notion “criminal” were to remain when criminal law and criminal courts had been abolished and forgotten. A Hume discovering this situation might conclude that there was a special sentiment, expressed by “criminal,” which alone gave the word its sense.\n\n[The next few paragraphs expound, extend, as well as critique, Hume’s is-ought argument. (See above.)]\n\nIn the dicussion on brute facts (see above), it has been observed that given a certain context and a certain set of facts, it is perfectly alright to make the transition from “is” to “owes”. The example there was that given a certain context of market relations, it is perfectly alright to make the transition to from factual (or is) statements such as “I ordered potatoes”, “You supplied them”, “You sent me a bill” etc. to the evaluative statement that I owe you money.\n\nA second point may be observed by considering the transition from “is” to “needs” in the case of an organism which needs an environment. To say that an organism needs water to live is to simply say that it would not flourish without water. That’s to say, it is perfectly alright here as well, to go from “is” to “needs”. Whether or not you want it to flourish — which is the whole point, Hume might say — is relevant only when your wanting it to flourish has an influence on your actions. But in any case your wanting it to flourish and it needing the environment are quite independent. It will continue to need the environment whether or not you want it to flourish.\n\nHowever, what you want and what you need (or think you need) have a complicated relationship. “It is possible not to want something that you judge you need. But, e.g., it is not possible never to want anything that you judge you need.” Hume’s ideas about the is-ought problem would lead us to believe that there is some problem with the “need” to which we may not jump to. But the problem is not about it but rather about the nature or phenomenon of wanting.\n\nThirdly, and finally, when it comes to the derivation of the moral ought from is, somebody saying that it remains impossible to infer “morally ought” from “is” sentences would be in the right. This moral ought with its mere mesmeric force cannot be derived from anything!\n\nThe argument is that the word “ought” — so invested with a moral sense which is the legacy, a “survival”, of an ethical system we have since abandoned, more or less — now posseses merely a “mesmeric” force and that “no [ethical] content [can actually] be found in the notion ‘morally ought’”. Therefore, “[i]t would be most reasonable to drop it.” [Thesis II]\n\nThe notion of “morally ought” has no reasonable sense outside a law conception of ethics; they are not going to maintain such a conception; and you can do ethics without it, as is shown by the example of Aristotle. It would be a great improvment if, instead of “morally wrong,” one always named a genus such as “untruthful,” “unchaste,” “unjust.” We should no longer ask whether doing something was “wrong,” passing directly from some description of an action to this notion; we should ask whether, e.g., it was unjust; and the answer would sometimes be clear at once.\n\nIV\n\nIn all modern English moral philosophers starting from G.E. Moore, the overriding concern of ethics has become consequences. “The ‘right action’ is the action which produces the best possible consequences.” Of course, it is possible to generate diversity of views by probing various interpretations of “right” and “best” as well as the connections between them. But underlying this diversity, which is only apparent, lies a unity which is revealed by the fact that “every one of the best known English academic moral philosophers [since Henry Sidgwick] has put out a philosophy according to which, e.g., it is not possible to hold that it cannot be right to kill the innocent as a means to any end whatsoever and that someone who thinks otherwise is in error.” [Thesis III]\n\nThis is significant because this is quite incompatible with the Hebrew-Christian ethic which prohibits a lot of things “simply in virtue of their description as such-and-such identifiable kinds of action, regardless of any further consequences”.\n\nSidgwick’s defense of a notion of intention covering all (only) foreseen consequences is problematic.\n\nI think, however, that for purposes of exact moral or jural discussion, it is best to include under the term ‘intention’ all the consequences of an act that are foreseen as certain or probable; since it will be admitted that we cannot evade responsibility for any foreseen bad consequences of our acts by the plea that we felt no desire for them, either for their own sake or as means to ulterior ends: such undesired accompaniments of the desired results of our volitions are clearly chosen or willed by us.\n\nHenry Sidgwick, The Methods of Ethics, Book III, Chapter I.\n\nSay a man is (I) responsible for maintaining a child. Say, he wants to stop supporting the child either because (I.a) he no longer wishes to do so or (I.b) by doing so he would compel someone else to do something, say an admirable thing. Now, consider that that man has to also choose between (II) doing something disgraceful and (III) going to prison. Obviously, III entails that the man fail to do I. For Sidgwick, there is no difference between I.a I.b and III because in all cases case, the consequence is the same, i.e. the child loses its maintenance, even if the motivations are different: it is self-regarding in I.a, consequence regarding in I.b, and for III, the consequence is entailed.\n\nThe man then has only to choose between these and II. If he judges that doing II is less harmful than withdrawing maintenance of the child (I.a/I.b and III), he will do the former. Now, it may be that the man misjudged things and II is in fact more harmful than the rest. But for Sidgwick and given what his definition of intention allows, the man would get away with his action because its consequence was not what he had foreseen. For Sidgwick, the badness of an action is dependent on its expected, i.e. foreseen, consequences. This is troubling because we see that one can get away with the (terrible) actual consequences by making a case that they were unforeseen (or unexpected).\n\n“The denial of any distinction between foreseen and intended consequences ... explains the difference between old-fashioned Utilitarianism and ... consequentialism.”\n\nAlso, consequentialism cannot deal with borderline cases. And such cases are commonplace in ethics. The consequentialist can only say in such borderline cases that a person must not bring about this or that. What ‘this or that’, i.e. the consequence, is will of course be judged on the basis of standards invariably determined by current standards in society. What are the chances that the standards of a society will be decent?\n\nV\n\nThere are people who accept the notions of ‘obligation’ and of the ‘moral’ ought but reject the notion of a divine legislator. They look for non-divine sources of moral norms: society, reason or legislation by oneself, contract, human virtue.\n\nSociety, it will be obvious, is hardly a steady standard for decent norms. Legislating for oneself sounds good but it must be realised that left to his own reason, ahem, devices, a person will more often than not come up with rules he thinks are good on the basis of custom, determined by his society. With contract, it is difficult to determine who promulgated it to whom and whether, if, or how, we are party to it. Also, even if these are worked out, it is likely that the norms arising will be largely formal — along the lines of “what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander” — and not at all concerned with ethical particularities.\n\nMight we find ‘norms’ in human virtues? Perhaps, it is a norm that man qua social/moral/political being has such-and-such virtues in the same way that it is a norm that man qua biological being has so many teeth. However, in this sense, the notion of ‘norm’ no longer has the distinctly Christian meaning. Instead, it has become Aristotelian. If this direction is where we want to go, “the notions of ‘moral obligation,’ ‘the moral ought,’ and ‘duty’ are best put on the Index”.\n\nBut meanwhile — is it not clear that there are several concepts that need investigating simply as part of the philosophy of psychology and, — as I should recommend — banishing ethics totally from our minds? Namely — to begin with: ‘action,’ ‘intention,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘wanting.’ More will probably tum up if we start with these. Eventually it might be possible to advance to considering the concept ‘virtue’; with which, I suppose, we should be beginning some sort of a study of ethics.\n\n“I will end by describing the advantages of using the word ‘ought’ in a non-emphatic fashion, and not in a special ‘moral’ sense; of discarding the term ‘wrong’ in a ‘moral’ sense, and using such notions as ‘unjust.’”\n\nIt is quite possible to distinguish between what is intrinsically unjust and what is unjust given the circumstances. To arrange that a man be convicted for a crime he did not commit is intrinsically unjust. To deprive a man of his property without legal procedure, to not pay debts, to break contracts, etc. are unjust given the circumstances. Circumstances are crucial to determining questions of justice and injustice, and the circumstances may sometimes include expected consequences.\n\nA man’s claim to a property, i.e. a matter of justice, will be nullified if its seizure can avert some obvious disaster, i.e. an expected consequence. This is not to say that consequences always overrule considerations of intrinsic justice. The point is that the lines to be drawn between intrinsic and circumstantial (including consequential) factors in determining justice is complicated and that in particular cases, the line is drawn “according to what’s reasonable”. In other words, “there can in principle be no canon other than giving a few examples.”\n\nThat is to say, while it is because of a big gap in philosophy that we can give no general account of the concept of virtue and of the concept of justice, but have to proceed, using the concepts, only by giving examples; still there is an area where it is not because of any gap, but is in principle the case, that there is no account except by way of examples: and that is where the canon is ‘what's reasonable’: which of course is not a canon.\n\nIn the intrinscially unjust example, it is clear that no circumstances or consequences would modify the description of the action as unjust. However, in English moral philosophy since Sidgwick, it is possible to question the description. Might it (arranging for a man to be convicted for a crime he did not commit) be morally right in some circumstances? The point again is that we lack the philosophic equipment to answer this question with any certitude.\n\nThere is a dilemma here. If we are to use unjust as a factual description, without the moral connotation of wrongness, it is open to ask whether one ought to do injustice? [If unjust, understood to be determined by a consideration of whether it is right to do so-and-so in such-and-such circumstances, is used with the moral connotation of wrongness, the question (whether one ought to do injustice) simply does not arise!] One could reply to the question by determining moral rightness in terms of some other principles or make a principle out of injustice itself (that injustice is morally wrong). But however we reply, so long as the term unjust remains factual, the moral propriety is determined not by the term ‘unjust’ but instead by a decision that injustice is wrong. If one grants this, he cannot criticise someone who does not make that decision.\n\nWe find that in this discussion of the dilemma, the moral sense of the term wrong is retained while its substance is quaranteed quite null.\n\nAnd I should be inclined to congratulate the present-day moral philosophers on depriving “morally ought” of its now delusive appearance of content, if only they did not manifest a detestable desire to retain the atmosphere of the term.\n\nIf we discard the notion ‘morally ought’ and return to its ordinary notion, we might reasonably ask if commiting injustice would be the best thing to do. The answers will be various. A philosopher might, à la Plato and Aristotle, permit only just actions since just, i.e. virtuous, actions are necessary for a man to be good (to flourish) even if such actions might actually make him flourish less, or not at all.\n\n[P]hilosophically there is a huge gap, at present unfillable as far as we are concerned, which needs to be filled by an account of human nature, human action, the type of characteristic a virtue is, and above all of human “flourishing.” And it is the last concept that appears the most doubtful. For it is a bit much to swallow that a man in pain and hunger and poor and friendless is “flourishing,” as Aristotle himself admitted.\n\nA person unimpressed by this argument might, faced with a hard choice, answer that given such-and-such requirements, which we can’t fulfill without doing injustice, we ought to do it. And it has been the job of modern moral philosophers since Sidgwick to construct systems according to which this person may be virtuous!"
