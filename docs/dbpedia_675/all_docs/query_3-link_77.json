We strive to publish high-quality research representing the diverse and rich traditions in aesthetics. Our ambition is to build bridges not only between the Anglophone and continental traditions of aesthetics, but also between historical and contemporary views, between aesthetics and other fields of philosophy and academic research in general. Estetika is an open access, triple-anonymous peer-reviewed journal published twice a year.",

        "text": "‘Make and cultivate music, said the dream’ (Plato, Phaedo).\n\n‘I had a natural propensity to think about ideas which arise in music’ (Ludwig Wittgenstein).\n\nWhile a student in Cambridge, Wittgenstein engaged enthusiastically for a while, in 1912 and 1913, in the empirical study of rhythmic perception at the newly built, technologically cutting-edge laboratory for experimental psychology, headed by the eminent British psychologist Charles S. Myers. In a few of these experiments Wittgenstein collaborated with Bernard Muscio, a young Australian researcher at Myers’s laboratory, who studied philosophy with James Ward. David Pinsent, a fellow student with musical talent and a good friend of Wittgenstein, often served as a test subject. Pinsent recorded in his diary and letters many hours of experiments, and also mentioned conversations in which rhythm was discussed. Wittgenstein’s experiments resulted in two public presentations in Cambridge. The first was given in July 1912 before the British Psychological Society, and the second occurred in May 1913, on the occasion of the ceremonial opening of the new laboratory for experimental psychology, which also included Wittgenstein’s demonstration of an apparatus for the psychological investigation of rhythm.\n\nWittgenstein’s 1912–13 experiments on rhythm are his earliest recorded engagement in thinking about music, not just appreciating it, and philosophizing by means of musical thinking. In this essay, I set these experiments within their appropriate intellectual, scientific, and philosophical context in order to show that, its minor scientific importance notwithstanding, this onetime excursion into empirical research provided an early onset for Wittgenstein’s career-long exploration of the philosophically pervasive implications of aspects. The theme of aspects was not only a cornerstone of Wittgenstein’s conception of aesthetics, but also central to his overall philosophical development.\n\nIn Section I of this essay, I set Wittgenstein’s experiments in their scientific context, both in experimental psychology and in musicology. I argue that in the laboratory Wittgenstein followed Charles Myers’s scientific program. Myers focused mostly on the simplest musical elements in order to trace the origins of our musical appreciation and attitudes. Wittgenstein initially followed Myers’s conviction that aesthetic experience, which is evoked by complex artistic forms, is encapsulated in the experience of ‘simple material’.\n\nIn Section II I argue that Wittgenstein produced in these experiments the onset of what he would later call ‘noticing an aspect’. The experiments produced a sonic equivalent of an ambiguous figure and Wittgenstein was aware of this, by his own admission. I argue that the conceptual limitations and the technological rigidity of the scientific apparatus for these experiments inevitably placed Wittgenstein’s goal to investigate the nature of rhythm and its importance in music out of reach.\n\nIn Section III I offer a close reading of Wittgenstein’s own account in retrospect of his original impetus behind the experiments. I argue that as Wittgenstein was hoping, by his own admission, to engage his test subjects in making illuminating comparisons inside an aesthetic system, he was in fact making a pioneering philosophical leap not only beyond psychology’s mode of explaining things away, but also, and much more importantly, beyond Myers’s simplistic conception of the simple as a component of the complex, beyond the tendency of rendering the simple and the complex as patent opposites, as contrasting qualities along a line of hierarchical, ordered development.\n\nIn Section IV I use Juliet Floyd’s evolutionary account of the emergence of aspect-phrasing in early Wittgenstein to underscore the strikingly forward-looking philosophical impetus behind the experiments. I argue that the kind of attention to the activity of characterizing, and to the varieties of techniques for making illuminating comparisons, that Wittgenstein was seeking in his conversations with his test subjects, turns out to have been quite incongruous with the view of logic that was about to shape the Tractatus, anticipating, remarkably, the tenets of his much later philosophy, in particular what I propose to call the ‘master simile’ of language as music."
