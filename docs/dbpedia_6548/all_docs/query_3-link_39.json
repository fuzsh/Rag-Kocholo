        "text": "This photo of a housing estate in Sydney has been shared and discussed to no ends lately - it seems to be a graphic representation of everything wrong with modern Australian housing estates today. As built environment professionals there’s really no need to even comment on this type of outcome - we all hold the same opinion. But what’s interesting is the unshakeable and immovable emotional attachment of the general public to this outdated “Australian Dream”. The 4 bedroom, 2 car garage with a yard seems to be non-negotiable when considering the housing needs of a young family. Density has come to be such a dirty word, but that’s exactly what this is. Density done poorly. So then how to we rebrand density? We have some amazing examples of density done well across Australia now and we have a history of successfully marketing units as sophisticated alternatives to suburban blocks (Brisbane 1920’s-30’s?). We’re at a critical point in time in Brisbane with cost-of-living and housing pressures, as well as a growing population and the impending Olympics and all of its associated infrastructure/development. We hold a lot of knowledge, opinions and experience as experts in our fields and I often take for granted that friends and family naturally understand the benefits of different (and denser) housing typologies - but that’s simply not the case. They’re still standing in line to buy one of the houses in this photo. I’d love to see/hear how we could start working towards a fundamental behavioural shift in attitudes towards density. How do we relinquish the long held sense of ownership and as a state (or nation) move towards a shared economy? How do we reframe the Australian Dream? How do we convince our pregnant sister/cousin/friend that moving to a townhouse/unit/apartment is a great idea and to not fall into line for another housing estate? We’re at a point now where we need rapid progression."
