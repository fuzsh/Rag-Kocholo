We apologize for the inconvenience.**\n\nMuch of the information shown below was taken from the now-defunct Q106 tribute site, which may still be accessible through this archive.org link.\n\nIn the late 80’s and early 90’s, San Diego’s Q106 was one of the top stations in America, offering a Rhythmic-leaning Mainstream CHR format that fit the San Diego market perfectly. Q106 enjoyed a run of at least 12 straight Arbitron books (the site linked above claims 16) as the #1-rated station in America’s Finest City. It was owned by Edens Broadcasting, making it a sister to Y95 (KOY-FM) Phoenix, Q105 (WRBQ) Tampa Bay, and Q94 (WRVQ) Richmond, VA.\n\nHowever, by the early to mid 90’s, due to a combination of competition from newcomer Jammin’ Z90 (XHTZ), format changes, and ownership changes, the station went into decline. In the mid-90’s, Q106 was sold again to Jacor (now Clear Channel) and then to a company who flipped it to a Spanish-language format in August 1998.\n\nA few days before Q106 signed off, it aired the farewell programming highlighted on this aircheck. This is one of the best tributes I’ve ever heard, as it highlights some of the best air talent (including their top memories of the station), jingles, sweepers, promotions, and music from the station’s 11-year run.\n\nIncluded are promos redirecting listeners to Channel 933 (KHTS), which had become Q106’s sister station (and presumably one of the final reasons for its demise). As heard on the promos, Channel 933 had begun adding rock-oriented selections to its Rhythmic-heavy playlist; an aircheck from Channel 933’s Dance-leaning early days can be heard here.\n\nEDIT: THIS article from LA Times, dated 10/7/88, implies that it (meaning the Summer ’88 book) was the first time Q106 finished #1 in the ratings."
