Perfect to listen to on the computer while playing games like Farming Simulator when it's approaching midnight and you still gotta get 20 hectares of plowing done before bedtime.\n\nJames\n\nToo much old rock and way too much Guns and Roses and Beasty Boys !\n\nRichard Maher\n\nThank you , I can only listen to this one online . Great New Rock , which is hard to find in the New York metro area"
