        "text": "• Good news from ST Radio Indianapolis, where it was announced that Lenny Diana has signed a new long-term contract extension to continue as Program Director of Triple A 92-3 WTTS. He also remains PD of Alternative sister WGBJ (ALT 99.5/102.5)/Ft. Wayne.\n\nWhile waiting for the smudge-proof ink to completely dry, Brad Holtz, President of ST Radio, commented, “Since joining ST Radio, Lenny has established a remarkable record, driving WTTS to new rating highs while supporting and working in tandem with our sales team, helping the station achieve all-time revenue records. He’s a strong partner and collaborator, and we are excited to have him on the ST Radio team for years to come.”\n\nDiana joins WTTS in Sept. 2021, following a successful eight-year run as Operations Manager of Saga Classic Rock WAQY & Active Rock WLZX (Lazer 99.3)/Springfield, MA. Diana enjoyed an earlier run in Indianapolis, where he programmed iHeartMedia’s WRZX (now WOLT) from 2004 until 2012. Diana’s programming resume also includes WEDG (The Edge)/Buffalo, WXDX/Pittsburgh and WWSK (94-3 The Shark)/Nassau-Suffolk.\n\nDiana remarked, “I’m thrilled to continue my journey at 92-3 WTTS and ALT 99.5/102.3, working alongside exceptional teams and serving the incredible people of Indianapolis and Fort Wayne. These vibrant cities, each with their own unique charm and spirit, make our work incredibly rewarding. Being part of ST Radio and contributing to our communities brings happiness to my dojo every day.”"
