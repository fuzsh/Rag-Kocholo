As a society, we're witnessing the rise of screen addiction among our children, I know we are as a family. Recent studies have shown that prolonged exposure to screens can lead to issues like sleep disturbances, obesity, poor academic performance, and even developmental delays. üòî Here are a few steps I have started to try and implement in our house: üì∫ Set Screen Time Limits: Establish clear guidelines for screen time and stick to them. We encourage outdoor activities, reading, and imaginative play as alternatives. ü§≥ Lead by Example: My children often mimic my behaviour so I am conscious of my screen time and leave my phone in other rooms of the house to remove the temptation for me to scroll or respond to messages üíª Create Tech-Free Zones: Designated areas in our home where screens are not allowed, such as our dining table or the kids' bedrooms, to promote quality family time. üèïÔ∏è Enjoy a Feather Down weekend often #ScreenTime #ChildHealth #DigitalWellBeing #ParentingTips #Education #HealthyHabits\n\nGetting involved in the Erie, CO community is crucial, especially as a small business owner.
