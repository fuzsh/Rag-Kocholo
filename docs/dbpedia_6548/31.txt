History

103.1 FM first signed on the air in February 1993 as WBSI, broadcasting from studios located on Sunrise Highway in Bay Shore and playing oldies from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.[4] The WBSI call letters were dropped only a few months after the station signed on because 106.1 WBLI complained the WBSI call sign was too similar and would cause confusion in the Arbitron ratings.

WBZO â along with WHLI, WKJY, and WWSK â was sold by Barnstable Broadcasting to Connoisseur Media effective July 3, 2012 for $23 million.

On May 15, 2015, WBZO rebranded as "103.1 Max FM".[5]
