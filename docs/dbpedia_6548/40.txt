Release Summary

The WWSK v0.5.0 includes the following new features and bug fixes:

WWSK Explorer - an integrated WebWorldWind client

Optional Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) for Linux

Control Flow module included

Integration Tests

Headless options for setup scripts in Linux

User selectable memory configuration for Linux

WWSK 0.5.0 includes an early release of the the WWSK Explorer that was debuted at the EO OpenScience 2017 conference at ESA/ESRIN. The Explorer is an integrated virtual globe web client that is connected to your WWSK installation. It provides the ability to browse your server's layers on virtual globe. It supports persistent markers and the creation of sharable bookmarks. The integrated Layer Manager supports layer sorting, opacity settings, and zooming to a layer's extents. This release of the Explorer is not mature, e.g., the integrated Layer Manager UI has room for improvement, and there are known bugs.

WWSK 0.5.0 for Linux supports the inclusion of the native Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) libraries. The setup script will prompt the user if JAI should be installed. The setup script supports the removal of the JAI as well.

The Control Flow module has been included in all the WWSK distributions. A default controlflow.properties file has been included (will all rules disabled) in the data_dir folder to facilitate the easy inclusion of this feature in production systems. See the Control Flow documentation or look at the comments in data_dir/controlflow.properties file for more information.

JMeter integration tests have been included in this release. This includes a test runner and test data included in the repository. The integration tests run in Travis Continous Integration server and will fail the build upon error. The integration tests can be run on the local workstation as well. See the travis/run_integration_tests.sh script and the integration test profiles defined in the worldwind-geoserver/pom.xml file for more information. HTML test reports are written to the worldwind-geoserver/target/jmeter/reports folder.

The setup scripts (setup-gdal.sh, setup-jai.sh and setup-java.sh) have been refactored to support headless operations via command line arguments. These scripts are now multi-purpose as they are used by both the main setup.sh script and run_integration_test.sh script.

A user selectable memory configuration has been added to the main setup.sh script. The options include several predefined memory configurations and the ability to define a custom allocation.

Test Tools

The JMeter integration tests test the results of GetCapabilities requests, GetMap requests for core data stores, GetMap for GDAL data stores, and GetMap requests for both core and GDAL data stores with JAI installed.

To run the integration tests run ./travis/run_integration_tests -c from the WWSK root project folder.

The same integration tests are run by the Travis continuous integration service and they will fail the build upon error.

Two other JMeter test plans are included in the WWSK project's jmeter folder hierarchy:

GeoServer Functional Test.jmx : performs WMS and WPS requests for the supported data stores and image formats.

GeoServer Stress Test.jmx : performs load tests with performance metrics.

These test plans require data sets that not included in the repository so may require editing or customization before use.

Install/Update/Removal

Install

WWSK is installed by simply unzipping a platform specific distribution to a folder on a target computer.

Removal

WWSK is removed by simply deleting the folder in which it was installed. If a wwsk.service has been created (Linux), it should be stopped, disabled and removed.

Update

The recommended practice for updating WWSK is to:

Install a new version of WWSK alongside an older version,

(Optionally) copy/move data and workspaces from the old version to the new version,

Remove the old version.

Updating WWSK by unzipping a distribution into an existing WWSK instance has not been tested and is not recommended.

Release Summary

The WWSK v0.4.0 includes the following new features and bug fixes:

An About WWSK page that displays the WWSK version number

An Export GeoPackage page that displays a form to issue a WPS request to export a layer to a GeoPackage

A fix that allows GeoPackages with hyphens in the table names.

The new Export GeoPackage feature allows layers to be exported at full-fidelity, as compared to the Layer Preview, which will — in a future release — constrain the size of a GeoPackage, which may limit the number of levels of resolution. The Export GeoPackage also provides for more granular control of the GeoPackage contents. The Export GeoPackage is a secured page. You must be logged in for it to be available.

Time constraints for this release precluded a fully-featured Export GeoPackage. Functionality planned for a future release includes:

Using the bounds of another layer to set the bounds of the exported GeoPackage

Setting the background color

A style selection component

Input validations

An improved download link page

Exporting vector layers as vector GeoPackages

In previous versions of WWSK the Layer Preview | GeoPackage export imposed a constraint on the number of levels exported (4). This constraint prevented GeoPackage exports from taxing the server with lots of WMS requests needed the for higher zoom levels. With this constraint removed, higher resolution levels can be generated, but it introduces the liability of overloading the server with an enormous number of tile requests.

To mitigate against this risk, consider enabling MIME type checking in the WMS Service settings and do not include the application/x-gpkg in the list of allowed MIME types.

Note: The constraint on the number of levels generated in the Layer Preview / WMS export could be reimposed in a future release. The WPS export is not affected by this constraint

Associated GitHub Issues

No. Description Type #82 Export a layer as a GeoPackage enhancement #72 Cannot add a layer from a GeoPackage containing a hyphen in the table name bug #69 Add "About WWSK" to GeoServer new feature

Known issues

No. Description Type #89 Reestablish WMS constraint on GeoPackage size task

Impacts to other development teams/compatibility

A new module was added to the WWSK maven project:

End User impact/User facing changes

A new WWSK menu category was added to the GeoServer web administration interface. Under the WWSK menu category are the About WWSK and Export GeoPackage links. The Export GeoPackage link is not visible if you are not logged in.

The About WWSK shows the version number of the WorldWind Server Kit and manifests links to NASA WorldWind resources.

The Export GeoPackage link manifests a new form for issuing a request to export a layer to a GeoPackage via a WPS. The form will pre-fill many of the fields upon the selection of a layer. After completing the form, click the Execute button to issue the request. When the execute request is finished, a popup window displays a link to download the prepared GeoPackage. Note, there is a timeout on the link, you must download it before it expires. The form also allows you to generate the XML for a request so that can copy and paste it into a cURL request or other client.

Reminder: Exporting to a GeoPackage via the Layer Preview is a user facing feature that does not require a login. To mitigate the risk of an overburdened server, consider enabling MIME type checking in the WMS Service settings.

Release Summary

WWSK v0.3.1 is a hot fix that addresses the loss of fidelity in imagery exported to GeoPackages from the GeoServer Layer Preview .

The previous versions of WWSK the Layer Preview | GeoPackage export imposed a constraint on the number of levels exported (4). This constraint prevented GeoPackage exports from taxing the server with lots of WMS requests needed the for higher zoom levels. With this constraint removed, higher resolution levels can be generated, but it introduces the liability of overloading the server with an enormous number of tile requests.

To mitigate against this risk, consider enabling MIME type checking in the WMS Service settings and do not include the application/x-gpkg in the list of allowed MIME types.

Also, consider WPS as alternative to exporting to GeoPackages via the Layer Preview and WMS. WPS GeoPackage export offers greater control over the contents of the generated GeoPackage. Refer to GeoPackage As Output | GeoPackage WPS Process documentation for more information.

Note: The constraint on the number of levels generated in the Layer Preview / WMS export could be reimposed in a future release. The WPS export is not affected by this constraint

Release Summary

GDAL Support

The World Wind Server Kit (WWSK) v0.2.1 addresses GDAL ECW and MrSID licensing conflicts, in particular, the issue of preinstalling (distributing) the non-GPL ECW and MrSID components in the GPL-licensed GeoServer. In WWSK v0.2.1, the ECW and MrSID components are not preinstalled. Instead, the requisite platform specific distributions for these components accompany the WWSK GeoServer installation and the user must explicitly install these components, if this functionality desired. WWSK v0.2.1 handles GDAL for Windows and Linux differently.

Linux

To install GDAL in WWSK for Ubuntu and CentOS, the user must run the setup.sh script and then choose to install GDAL and optionally MrSID and/or ECW. If GDAL is selected, the setup.sh script installs the GDAL natives and data, and copies the GeoServer GDAL-plugin jars and ImageIO-Ext jars -- excluding the ECW and MrSID jars -- to the GeoServer's lib folder (webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib). To add the ECW or MrSID support, the user must choose to install ECW and/or MrSID and agree to the respective license(s), at which point the previously excluded jars are added to the GeoServer's lib folder.

Windows

In WWSK for Windows, the GDAL natives and data are already installed and the GDAL-plugin jars and ImageIO-Ext jars have been copied into the GeoServer's lib folder (webapps\geoserver\WEB-INF\lib). The ECW and MrSID natives are installed explicitly by the user using the appropriate .msi installers that can be found in the installation's gdal folder. These installers install the natives (.dlls) for the selected component.

Associated GitHub Issues

No. Description Type #32 Restore GDAL ECW & JP2ECW support enhancement #25 Restore GDAL MrSID support enhancement #31 GeoTIFF with JPEG compression store fails after GDAL ImageIO-Ext installed bug #26 WAR file deployment to Tomcat failed bug

Known Issues

No. Description Type #34 Unable to open JPEG2000.jp2 image with JP2K (MrSID) Coverage Format bug #21 WCS 2.0.1 GetCoverage requests are slow bug

Impacts to other development teams/compatibility

In v0.2.0, the inclusion of GDAL artifacts in the worldwind-geoserver was managed by Maven via the declaration of GDAL-related dependencies in the worldwind-geoserver POM file.

In v0.2.1 GDAL is not included in the worldwind-geoserver application build. The GDAL-related dependencies have been removed from the POM file. Instead, GDAL raster image support is added to worldwind-geoserver using the methods documented in the GeoServer Image Formats page. The worldwind-geoserver-dist project contains the scripts, resources and assemblies used to create distributions with the requisite resources to install GDAL support.

Versions

Component Version Previous GeoServer 2.10.0 GeoTools 16.0 GeoWebCache 1.10.0 ImageIO-Ext 1.1.16 1.1.13 JAI-Ext 1.0.11 Jetty 9.2.13.v20150730

GDAL

Linux:

For the Ubuntu and CentoOS distributions, the GDAL 1.9.2 related resources are found in the installation's gdal folder. The setup.sh script performs the task of extracting and copying the artifacts to their proper folders. The inclusion of these resources in a particular distribution is controlled by the assemblies and components defined in the worldwind-geoserver-dist project.

Windows:

For Windows distributions, the GDAL 1.9.2 artifacts and resources have been extracted and copied to their destinations via the maven-assembly-plugin. See the worldwind-geoserver-dist POM file for details.

End User impact/User facing changes

Setup

Linux

The setup.sh script has been embellished to prompt the user whether or not to install GDAL and optionally to install ECW and/or MrSID. The script is rerunnable.

The install.sh script has been renamed install-service.sh and embellished to update the service unit file (wwsk.service). The script is rerunnable.

Windows

The setup.bat script has been removed. Users wanting to install ECW or MrSID support should run the appropriate .msi installer found in the installation's gdal folder.

Data

The low-resolution world background layer has been moved from the data/nasa folder to data/nasa/base

Documentation

See the README, GeoServer, GeoPackage and GDAL Image Formats documentation.

Logs

Not applicable at this time.

Test Tools

Apache JMeter was used to perform functional tests targeting WWSK instances running on the Ubuntu, CentOS and Windows platforms. The "GeoServer Functional Tests.jmx" file found in the jmeter folder contains the tests. Test data must be installed on the geoserver instance being tested.

Install/Update/Removal

Install

WWSK is installed by simply unzipping a platform specific distribution to a folder on a target computer.

Linux Specific

The install-service.sh script is used to install and update the wwsk.service service. It will update the paths in the service unit file.

Run ./install-service.sh to install/update the wwsk.service after installing a new version of WWSK.

Run ./setup.sh to configure the runtime environment. This must be performed at least once; the run.sh script will invoke setup.sh if it has not been run before. Use the reinstall parameter to recofigure, e.g., ./setup.sh reinstall

Removal

WWSK is removed by simply deleting the folder in which it was installed. If a wwsk.service has been created (Linux), it should be stopped, disabled and removed.

Update

The recommended practice for updating WWSK is to:

Install a new version of WWSK alongside an older version,

(Optionally) copy/move data and workspaces from the old version to the new version,

Remove the old version.

Updating WWSK by unzipping a distribution into an existing WWSK instance has not been tested and is not recommended.
