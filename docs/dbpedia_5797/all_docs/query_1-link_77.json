A homoromantic person is not necessarily sexually attracted to the same sex.\n\nHomosexual\n\nThe clinical term, coined in the field of psychology, for people with a same-sex sexual attraction.

It was the first scale to account for bisexuality. According to a 1954 survey using the scale, 70% of people fell between 1 and 5. It’s been criticized for being too linear and only accounting for behavior and not sexual identity and is no longer widely used.\n\nLeather\n\nThe leather subculture denotes practices and styles of dress organized around sexual activities. Wearing leather garments is one way that participants in this culture self-consciously distinguish themselves from mainstream sexual cultures. Leather culture is most visible in gay communities and most often associated with gay men (\"leathermen\"), but it is also reflected in various ways in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual worlds. Many people associate leather culture with BDSM (Bondage/Discipline, Dominance/Submission, Sado/Masochism)\n\nLesbian\n\nA woman who is emotionally, romantically, sexually, affectionately, or relationally attracted to other women, or someone who identifies as a member of the lesbian community.

The acronym is used as an umbrella term when talking about non-heterosexual and non-cisgender identities, and does not always reflect members of the community.

Can be used in a positive or a derogatory way, depending on who is using it. Is sometimes also used to refer to a lesbian who is seen as automatically passing for heterosexual.\n\nMSM\n\nAn abbreviation for men who have sex with men.

People who exhibit self-described masculinity do not necessarily think of themselves as men: some women (including trans women) are masculine, some men are, some genderqueer or androgynous people are.\n\nMetrosexual\n\nA term popularized in the 1990s referring to a heterosexual male who assumes characteristics traditionally associated with gay male stereotypes. While the term seems to imply a shift in sexual orientation it more accurately reflects a loosening of restrictions around male gender role adherence and is not related to sexuality.\n\nNeutrois\n\nA person who is not regularly internally gendered.\n\nNo Homo\n\nAn offensive phrase often used after someone has inadvertently said something that others may consider gay.\n\nOmnisexual\n\nA person who is sexually attracted to all sexes/genders.

Use of the term usually signals a repudiation of the concept of binary (two) sexes (a concept sometimes implied by “bisexual”).\n\nPassing\n\nBeing taken for a member of the dominant group–white, straight, cisgender (non-transgender), for example, LGBTQI people who have the ability to pass can choose to conceal the stigma associated with being a member of a sexual minority.\n\nPer\n\nA gender-inclusive alternative pronoun to he or she.

Operates on personal, interpersonal, cultural, and institutional levels, gives advantages, favors, and benefits to members of dominant groups at the expense of members of target groups, and people in dominant groups are frequently unaware that they are members of the dominant group due to the privilege of being able to see themselves as persons rather than stereotypes.\n\nPronouns\n\nOne class of words that an individual would like others to use when talking to or about that individual (for example: he/him/his, she/her/hers, or ze/hir/hirs).\n\nPolyamorous\n\nA person who finds themselves romantically, physically, and/or sexually attracted to multiple individuals, and finds that pursuing multiple relationships is the most satisfying course of action in their lives.\n\nPolyromantic\n\nA person who is romantically attracted to all or many genders or gender expressions.\n\nQueen\n\nA slang term used to refer to flamboyant or effeminate gay men.

A-romantic people may or may not experience these types of relationships (among other kinds).\n\nQuestioning\n\nThe process of examining one’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Can be used as an adjective.\n\nRomantic Orientation\n\nA term used to refer to variations in object of emotional and sexual attraction. The term is also used by those who consider themselves asexual to describe the gender(s) to which they are romantically attracted. The term is preferred by some over “sexual orientation” because it indicates that the feelings and commitments involved are not solely (or even primarily, for some people) sexual. The term stresses the affective emotional component of attractions and relationships, regardless or orientation. Is also referred to as affectional orientation.\n\nSame-Gender Loving (SGL)\n\nA term used by some African-American individuals to describe their sexual orientation, as a result of the perception that “gay” and “lesbian” are primarily white terms. “Same-sex loving” is also in use.\n\nSapiosexual\n\nA person who is emotionally, romantically, sexually, affectionately, or relationally attracted to intelligence and its use.\n\nSensual Attraction\n\nDesire to have physical non-sexual contact with someone else, like affectionate touching.\n\nSex\n\n1.
