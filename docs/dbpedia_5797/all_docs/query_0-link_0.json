        "text": "Below are definitions of some types of sexuality.\n\nAlloromantic\n\nA person who identifies as alloromantic experiences romantic attraction toward others.\n\nAllosexual\n\nThis is an umbrella term.\n\nA person who identifies as allosexual typically feels sexual attraction toward other people. They may also want to have sex with a partner.\n\nPeople who identify with this orientation may also identify with another sexuality, such as being gay, lesbian, or bisexual.\n\nAndrosexual\n\nPeople who consider themselves androsexual feel attraction toward men, males, or perceived masculinity, irrespective of whether or not they were assigned male at birth.\n\nAromantic\n\nA person who identifies as aromantic may not feel any romantic attraction toward anyone. They may not want a relationship beyond friendship.\n\nThose who identify with this orientation may also identify with another orientation.\n\nA person’s romantic attraction can differ from their sexual attraction. For example, a person may not feel romantic attraction toward people but may still be sexually attracted to some individuals.\n\nAsexual\n\nAsexual is an umbrella term that encompasses a broad spectrum of sexual orientations.\n\nAccording to the LGBTQIA Resource Center, asexuality is a spectrum. Some people may experience no sexual or romantic attraction toward anyone, while others may experience varying degrees of sexual or romantic attraction toward people.\n\nThose who identify with this orientation do not have to abstain from sex to be asexual.\n\nSome orientations that exist within the asexuality spectrum include:\n\nSex-averse: This is when a person is averse to or entirely disinterested in sex and sexual behavior.\n\nSex-favorable: This is when a person has positive feelings toward sex in some situations.\n\nSex-indifferent: This refers to those who feel neutral about sex and sexual behavior.\n\nSex-repulsed: This refers to those who are repulsed by sex and sexual behavior.\n\nCupiosexual: If someone identifies as cupiosexual, they do not experience sexual attraction but still desire to engage in sexual behavior or have a sexual relationship.\n\nLibidoist asexual: This term refers to those who identify as asexual but experience sexual feelings that they can satisfy with masturbation or self-stimulation.\n\nGraysexual: Those who are graysexual experience sexual attraction either infrequently or not very intensely.\n\nGrayromantic: People who identify as grayromantic may experience romantic attraction either rarely or not very strongly.\n\nLearn more about asexuality.\n\nAutoromantic\n\nThose who are autoromantic experience a romantic attraction toward themselves.\n\nThis does not mean they do not also experience romantic attraction toward others.\n\nAutosexual\n\nThose who identify as autosexual experience a sexual attraction toward themselves.\n\nSimilar to those who are autoromantic, people who are autosexual may also experience sexual attraction toward other people.\n\nBicurious\n\nPeople who identify as bicurious are interested in having a sexual or romantic experience with someone of the same gender.\n\nThe term indicates that the person experiences some uncertainty as to how they identify romantically or sexually.\n\nBiromantic\n\nPeople who identify as biromantic feel romantic, but not necessarily sexual, attraction toward more than one gender.\n\nBisexual\n\nA person who identifies as bisexual can be of any gender.\n\nBisexuality means that a person feels attraction toward their own gender and other genders or toward anyone regardless of their gender.\n\nThe LGBTQIA Resource Center notes that some people may use the terms bisexual and pansexual interchangeably to describe their sexual orientation.\n\nDemiromantic\n\nPeople who identify as demiromantic usually do not feel romantic attraction toward people with whom they do not have a strong emotional bond.\n\nDemisexual\n\nA person who identifies as demisexual typically only feels sexual attraction toward a person with whom they have already established a strong emotional bond.\n\nSome people who are demisexual may have no interest or only a slight interest in sexual activity.\n\nLearn more about demisexuality.\n\nGay\n\nA person who identifies as gay typically only feels sexual attraction toward people of the same gender.\n\nSocially, people use this term to refer to men who are romantically and sexually attracted to men. However, those in the community use it as an umbrella term.\n\nGynesexual or gynosexual\n\nPeople who identify as gynesexual feel sexual attraction toward women, females, and perceived femininity, irrespective of whether they were assigned female at birth.\n\nHeteroromantic\n\nThose who are heteroromantic may experience romantic attraction, but not necessarily sexual attraction, toward those of a different gender.\n\nHeterosexuality\n\nPeople who are heterosexual, or “straight,” typically feel sexual and romantic attraction toward people who are of a gender different than their own.\n\nHomoromantic\n\nHomoromantic refers to people who are romantically attracted to those of a similar gender to their own. They may not feel sexual attraction toward these people, though.\n\nHomosexuality\n\nHomosexuality is a term describing those who are emotionally and physically attracted to people of the same gender.\n\nHowever, the LGBTQIA Resource Center states that this term is outdated and may have negative connotations due to the past.\n\nLesbian\n\nThose who identify as lesbian are usually women who feel sexual and romantic attraction toward other women.\n\nSome nonbinary people — those who do not identify with the traditional binary sexes of male and female — may also identify as lesbians. This may be because they feel a closer connection to womanhood and are mainly attracted to women.\n\nMonosexual\n\nMonosexual is an umbrella term encompassing all sexual orientations that feel a romantic or sexual attraction toward only one gender.\n\nThe sexual orientations that come under this term include heterosexuality, gay, and lesbian.\n\nMultisexual\n\nMultisexual is a broad term that encompasses all sexual orientations in which people are attracted to more than one gender.\n\nSome sexual orientations that come under this term are bisexual and omnisexual.\n\nPansexual and omnisexual\n\nThese sexual orientations refer to people who feel attraction toward people of all genders and sexes.\n\nA typical identifier for people with this orientation is that gender is not a factor in sexual or romantic attraction.\n\nWhile there is overlap between these two terms and bisexuality and polysexuality, some people may prefer to use one term over another.\n\nPanromantic\n\nThis term refers to those who experience romantic attraction, but not sexual attraction, toward people of any gender or sex.\n\nPolysexual\n\nPeople who identify as polysexual feel sexual or romantic attraction toward more than one gender.\n\nQueer\n\nPeople of all sexualities under the LGBTQIA+ umbrella may also identify as queer.\n\nHistorically, many people used the word queer as a slur. People belonging to LGBTQIA+ communities may now choose to use this term to reclaim it.\n\nIt is generally not a good idea for people outside of these communities to use this term.\n\nSexual fluidity\n\nPeople’s sexuality can be fluid. This means that their sexual orientation is not fixed, and they may not define themselves by any particular sexuality.\n\nSkoliosexual\n\nPeople who identify as skoliosexual typically only feel attraction toward people who are nonbinary.\n\nSpectrasexual\n\nSpectrasexual is a term that describes those who are romantically and sexually attracted to multiple sexes, genders, and gender identities but not all of them."
