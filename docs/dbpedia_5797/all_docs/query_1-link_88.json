        "text": "A binary is a system that only has two parts, two possibilities. Whatever the topic, humans have a tendency to categorize people, ideas, and almost anything else as belonging to either group A or group B, in order to make the world easier to understand.\n\nIn regards to bisexuality, it is important to understand that the prefix \"bi-\" in bisexuality refers to having both same-sex and different-sex attractions. It is not in any way a commentary on the number of genders available in a society. Meanwhile, people's tendency to think of sexuality itself in terms of binaries is a major source of biphobia.\n\nBiphobia is a dislike or prejudice against bi people and bisexuality. Its manifestations include the assumption that being exclusively attracted to members of a single sex is somehow more natural, real, or legitimate than being attracted to members of more than one sex. It can take the form of denial that bisexuality is a genuine sexual orientation, negative stereotypes about people who are bisexual, or bi erasure.\n\nAn acronym that can stand for both \"Differences of Sexual Development\" or \"Disorders of Sexual Differentiation;\" both more modern terms for intersex conditions. Many medical care professionals and activists prefer the term DSD because intersex conditions are frequently misunderstood in academic and online discourse and because intersex has come to be used as an identity label by people who do not have the chromosonal, hormonal, or developmental differences that term was originally intended to describe.\n\nAlso known as Differences of Sexual Development (DSD), \"intersex\" is an umbrella term for 40+ congenital (present at birth) conditions in which a baby is born with atypical sex chromosomes, atypical genitals, or, in the rarest cases, elements of both male and female reproductive tissue. By far, the most common DSDs are males with undescended testis and males with hypospadias, a condition where the two halves of the penis fuse during development so that the urethra is not located on the tip of the penis. Generations ago, untrained doctors confused hypospadias for a partially formed vulva, resulting in lingering myths about \"hermaphrodites\" - individuals with both male and female reproductive organs. More serious, but less common DSDs, involve disruptions to the typical genetic or hormonal processes by which males and females develop differently. These cases are ongoing medical conditions that are often accompanied by complications such as high rates of heart problems, cancer, osteoporosis, and infertility. People with these kinds of DSDs require therapeutic interventions and regular monitoring to maintain their quality of life. It's important to note that DSDs do not represent a distinct or separate sex. Nearly all people with intersex conditions are readily identified as male or female.\n\nQueer has become an umbrella term for the LGBT community and been further adopted by anyone who feels that they are in a sexual or gender minority. The word was historically used as pejorative and can be upsetting for some members of the LGBT community. Activists in the 1980s fought to reclaim the word as a deliberately provocative and politically radical alternative to the more assimilative and mainstream branches of the LGBT movement. Since then, the term queer has taken a less militant tone, particularly among younger generations.\n\nThe word sex has a wide variety of meanings, which can sometimes lead to confusion. It's often used to mean intercourse, which can cause some people discomfort with the term and lead them to use euphemisms or alternate words (such as gender) for its other connotations. Another meaning of sex is the biological capacity by which humans and most other species reproduce. All mammals reproduce via two sexes: male and female. Sex can also refer to the X and Y chromosomes or even the specific SRY gene (normally found on the Y chromosome) that under typical conditions direct a human embryo to develop as either male or female. Occasionally, this differentiation process follows an atypical route and results in individuals with Differences of Sexual Development (DSDs), otherwise known as intersex conditions. The genitals and other organs associated with reproduction are \"primary sexual characteristics.\" Sex can also refer to \"secondary sexual characteristics,\" meaning observable characteristics such as body type, height, shape, voice, bone structure, hair growth patterns, fat distribution, etc. that other people can observe to varying degrees in everyday life."
