        "text": "What is oral sex?\n\nImage courtesy, Pexels\n\nOral sex used to be a taboo subject, but these days it’s a common form of sexual activity. Oral sex means using your mouth, lips or tongue to stimulate your partner’s genitals or anus.\n\nAll genders can give their partner/s oral sex. You’ve probably heard oral sex called many names – ‘going down’, a ‘blow job’, ‘giving head’, a ‘69’ or ‘rimming’ (plus plenty more).\n\nOral sex also has medical names. Oral sex on the vagina, vulva and clitoris is called cunnilingus. Oral sex on the penis is called fellatio. If oral sex involves the anus, it’s called anilingus.\n\nOral sex can be a natural and enjoyable part of sexual contact between partners if you consent to it.\n\nYou can give or receive oral sex as part of other sexual activity (like vaginal or anal intercourse) or on its own.\n\nUnprotected oral sex comes with risks.\n\nConsenting to oral sex\n\nBefore introducing oral sex into your relationship, it is important to talk openly about how you feel. Oral sex can put strain on relationships, particularly if one of you doesn’t enjoy it or has concerns about it.\n\nCommon issues about oral sex include:\n\nanxiety around oral sexual performance\n\nfeeling judged by your partner and what they will think\n\nbeing or feeling controlled by your partner.\n\nOral sex, like all types of sex takes practice. If you don’t feel ready to have sex or someone is pressuring you, tell them.\n\nSex should be enjoyable. Being intimate in your sexual relationships may make you feel vulnerable and can take time. You need to be able to trust each other and discuss openly what your needs are.\n\nRemember, by law, sex must be consensual, which also means respecting others’ decisions when they say ‘no’ or if they are too out of it to consent. Any sex that occurs without your consent is sexual assault, and it is a crime. Call the Sexual Assault Crisis LineExternal Link on Tel:1800 806 292.\n\nWhat are the risks of oral sex?\n\nAlthough you can’t get pregnant by just having oral sex, it still carries the possibility of catching or passing on sexually transmissible infections (STIs) and some other infections.\n\nSucking and licking the genitals or anus, means you are more likely to have contact with genital fluids and faeces, which puts you at risk of infection.\n\nGenerally, you’re more at risk of catching an STI from oral sex if you:\n\ndon’t use barrier protection (such as external or internal condoms and dams)\n\nhave cuts, sores or ulcers in your mouth when you have oral sex\n\ngive rather than receive oral sex – because you’re more likely to be exposed to genital fluids.\n\nengage in sex that causes tiny abrasions on or in the genitals (such as rough sex or using sex toys).\n\nSTIs and oral sex\n\nSTIs can be passed from one person to another during oral sex. Vaginal fluids, blood or semen from one person can make contact with the mucous membranes (the skin inside the vagina, mouth or anus) of another person.\n\nCertain sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other viruses are linked with oral sex. Some of these include:\n\nhuman papilloma virus (HPV) and genital warts\n\ngenital herpes\n\ngonorrhoea\n\nchlamydia\n\nhepatitis A, B, C\n\nshigella gastroenteritis\n\nsyphilis\n\nmpox\n\npubic lice (crabs).\n\nHIV and hepatitis C would usually be considered an STI risk only in the presence of blood or open wounds. For example, if you have sex with someone who is menstruating or has an open, bloody sore.\n\nHepatitis B transmission via oral sex is also low risk.\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) and genital warts\n\nHPV (or human papillomavirus) is very common – the majority of sexually active people will be exposed to HPV in their lifetime. Most HPV infections are cleared by the immune system without treatment.\n\nHPV is passed on through either genital, anal or oral sex. In many cases, HPV shows no signs or symptoms so you can pass it on without knowing it.\n\nSometimes HPV is responsible for genital (and mouth) cancers. However, this is uncommon and not caused by the HPV types that cause genital warts.\n\nA vaccine for protection against HPV is available. It can prevent infection from 9 HPV types which cause most genital warts and genital cancers.\n\nGenital warts\n\nSome strains of HPV cause genital warts – soft growths that occur on the genitals. It is rare for genital warts to be passed to the mouth and lips through oral sex.\n\nMost genital warts clear without treatment.\n\nAlthough visible genital warts can be treated, they may reappear. For most people, the body’s natural immunity will get rid of the virus over time. That’s why it’s important to use condoms and dental dams during sex.\n\nIf you suspect you have HPV or genital warts, see your doctor or make an appointment with a sexual health clinic.\n\nHerpes\n\nHerpes is a common STI caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).\n\nThere are 2 types:\n\nHSV 1 usually causes oral cold sores, but can also cause genital herpes\n\nHSV 2 causes genital herpes only (pain, itching and small sores on the genitals that turn into ulcers and scabs).\n\nYou can catch either type of herpes from unprotected oral, vaginal and anal sex.\n\nHSV 1 is commonly passed on when someone with the cold sore virus (with or without symptoms) performs oral sex on someone who has not had previous exposure to the virus.\n\nHSV 2 infection can happen when someone with the virus (with or without symptoms) has oral, vaginal or anal sex with someone who has not previously been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe infections can develop into mouth, genital or anal blisters or sores.\n\nSometimes you can have herpes without any symptoms and still pass on them on through skin-to-skin contact (asymptomatic shedding).\n\nHSV is well managed with medication by diagnosis from a doctor.\n\nGonorrhoea and chlamydia\n\nGonorrhoea and chlamydia can be passed on during oral sex through infected body fluids – such as semen, pre-ejaculation (cum), blood, or vaginal discharge.\n\nThese STIs can enter any sores, cuts, or ulcers you may have. Infection can also occur when fluids get into inflamed cells and into the bloodstream via the:\n\nlips and mouth\n\ngenitals or anus\n\nmembrane of the eye\n\ncells of the throat.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nHepatitis A is a gut infection that affects the liver. It can be passed on through contact with infected faeces (poo).\n\nYou may be at risk of this disease during oral sex when licking or touching your partner’s anus, even if it looks clean. Infection can also occur by not washing hands after contact with the anus..\n\nImmunisation is the best protection against hepatitis A and is recommended for people in high-risk groups (including people who have anal sex).\n\nShigella gastroenteritis\n\nShigella gastroenteritis is a bowel infection caused by bacteria that is passed on through contact with infected faeces (poo).\n\nIt can also be spread through sexual contact (mouth to anus sex). Men who have sex with men can be at risk.\n\nSyphilis\n\nSyphilis can be cured but it is a very serious condition if it is not treated.\n\nIt is highly contagious when the sore or rash is present. Sores may be present on the genitals, anus or lips or in the rectum or mouth.\n\nYou can catch syphilis by having unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex and sharing sex toys with someone who is infected.\n\nThe following symptoms may occur in the early stages:\n\na single genital, anal or oral sore (often painless)\n\nrash on hands, feet and the upper body (can be mild, not usually itchy or painful).\n\nSyphilis then becomes asymptomatic (without symptoms). It needs to be diagnosed by a blood test.\n\nIf left untreated, syphilis can cause organ damage and be very serious.\n\nThe late stage of syphilis may not develop for 10 to 30 years from the time of infection.\n\nSyphilis is very treatable with antibiotics. See a doctor for diagnosis. Treatment may vary from person to person depending on the stage of infection.\n\nIt is important to treat your sexual partners. Reinfection can occur if you have sex with someone with a syphilis infection.\n\nPubic lice (‘crabs’)\n\nPubic lice or ‘crabs’ are tiny insects, found in the genital area. They feed on blood and can cause intense itching.\n\nPubic lice can spread during sex.\n\nThey can be treated with over-the-counter medications.\n\nMpox\n\nMpox is a viral infection. It is transmitted between people through close contact.\n\nMpox can spread through:\n\ndirect or intimate contact (such as during sex)\n\ninfected clothing or linen (such as bedding or towels)\n\nrespiratory droplets (such as coughs and sneezes).\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\nrash with small lumps that blister and crust over (with pustules or pus-filled pimples) – that may go through different stages like chickenpox that eventually scab and fall off\n\nfever and chills\n\nmuscle aches\n\nswollen lymph nodes\n\nfatigue.\n\nPeople with mpox develop a painful rash that may occur on the:\n\ngenitals and around the anus\n\ninside the mouth\n\nface\n\npalms of the hands\n\nsoles of the feet.\n\nIf you have symptoms avoid close contact with others (including sex and sharing beds).\n\nIf you develop a rash, isolate from others, and seek medical care. Call your clinic in advance to let them know you will be attending. The doctor will take a swab to confirm that it is mpox.\n\nWear a mask at your appointment and if you have a rash or blisters, make sure they are covered.\n\nMost people with mpox have a mild illness and recover within a few weeks.\n\nOccasionally, mpox may require medical or hospital care if:\n\nskin lesions are painful and cannot be relieved by over-the-counter pain relief\n\npain prevents you from going to the toilet to pass urine or open your bowels\n\nlesions are extensive or become infected with bacteria.\n\nPreventing mpox\n\nCondoms are not effective at preventing the transmission of mpox.\n\nPrevention includes:\n\npractise safe hygiene by washing hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitiser\n\navoid contact with someone who is infected\n\ndo not share bedding or towels with some who is infected\n\nbe aware of exposure cases when travelling overseas\n\nimmunisation for eligible people.\n\nReducing your infection risk during oral sex\n\nThere are some things you can do to reduce your risk of infections during oral sex. Like any type of sex, practise safe sex by using protection, having regular medical check-ups, watching for symptoms, and avoiding sex when you’re at risk.\n\nWays to make oral sex safer include:\n\nUse condoms (external or internal) – check their expiry date and use only water-based lubricants to avoid tears and breakage.\n\nWear dental dams – a small thin sheet of latex that acts as a barrier between the mouth and vagina or anus.\n\nAvoid getting semen or vaginal fluid in your eyes.\n\nTalk openly with your partner about your sexual desires and what you want to explore sexually.\n\nGet tested for STIs.\n\nIf you have an STI, get treated. Avoid sexual contact until you receive medical advice that you are no longer infectious.\n\nWhen to avoid oral sex\n\nRemember, it’s better not to have sex if you or your partner/s has:\n\nan STI\n\nsores, cuts, ulcers, blisters, warts or rashes around their genitals, anus or mouth\n\nunhealed or inflamed piercings in their mouth or genitals\n\na throat infection\n\ntheir period (is menstruating).\n\nGet tested for STIs\n\nAnyone who is sexually active can get tested for STIs and have a sexual health check. How often you need to get tested and what kinds of tests you require can be related to a few factors.\n\nSee your doctor or visit a sexual health clinic when you:\n\nbecome sexually active\n\nstart a new sexual relationship\n\nhave sex with someone new\n\nyour sex partner has sex with someone else\n\nhave sex without a barrier (condom or dam)\n\nthink you have any signs and symptoms of an STI\n\nhave been told by someone that you have had sex with that they have been diagnosed with an STI.\n\nAll sexual contacts should be tested.\n\nSTI signs and symptoms to watch for\n\nIf you’ve had unprotected oral sex (or vaginal or anal sex without a condom), seek medical advice if you experience:\n\nitches, rashes, lumps or blisters in or around the genitals, vagina, anus or mouth\n\nunusual vaginal discharge\n\ndischarge from the penis\n\nirritation, pain or burning when you urinate (wee)\n\npain or bleeding during or after sex\n\nbleeding between periods\n\npain in the testicles or lower abdomen\n\nsore throat.\n\nHepatitis A, B and C affect the liver, so watch for:\n\nflu-like illness (such as fever, pain and headaches)\n\ntiredness and feeling sick (sometimes with vomiting and diarrhoea)\n\ndark-coloured urine or pale faeces, or both\n\njaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).\n\nIt’s important to get treatment for an STI as soon as possible. Some STIs can’t be treated but medications may reduce symptoms.\n\nUntreated STIs may cause serious illness. They can also result in long term health impacts (such as infertility and pregnancy problems).\n\nSTIs can sometimes have effects on the health of unborn babies if an infection is present or transmitted during pregnancy or birth.\n\nWhere to get help"
