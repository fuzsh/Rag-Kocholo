        "text": "We all have the right to not want sex or any other kind of sexual activity – for example, kissing, sexual touching or performing a sexual act.\n\nWe also all have the right to change our minds at any time. Or to consent to doing one sexual thing with someone but not another.\n\nWithout consent, any kind of sexual activity is sexual violence.\n\nMany of the myths surrounding consent and sexual violence can make victims and survivors feel as though they are somehow to blame. It can also make them feel that what happened to them wasn’t ‘real’ sexual violence.\n\nBUT, it doesn’t matter if someone doesn't have visible injuries or if they didn't scream, try to run away or fight. It also doesn't matter what they were wearing or what interaction happened beforehand. Or if they experienced feelings of arousal. Or if they knew the perpetrator.\n\nIf a person doesn’t consent to sexual activity of any kind then it is always sexual violence. And 100% of the blame lies with the perpetrator or perpetrators.\n\nWith all the myths surrounding sexual violence, however, working out what consent looks like in real life can sometimes feel confusing.\n\nSo, let’s break it down a bit…\n\nThe Sexual Offences Act 2003 says that someone consents to sexual activity if they:\n\nAgree by choice and\n\nHave both the freedom and capacity to make that choice.\n\nIf someone says ‘no’ to any kind of sexual activity, they are not agreeing to it.\n\nBut, if someone doesn't say ‘no’ out loud, that doesn’t automatically mean that they have agreed to it either.\n\nSomeone doesn’t have the freedom and capacity to agree to sexual activity by choice if:\n\nThey are asleep or unconscious.\n\nThey are drunk or ‘on’ drugs.\n\nThey have been ‘spiked’.\n\nThey are too young.\n\nThey have a mental health disorder or illness that means they are unable to make a choice.\n\nThey are being pressured, bullied, manipulated, tricked or scared into saying 'yes’.\n\nThe other person is using physical force against them.\n\nIf someone's not sure whether you are giving your consent for something sexual, they should check with you. If they can see or suspect you're not 100% comfortable or happy with what's happening between you, they should stop.\n\nBeing forced, pressured, bullied, manipulated, tricked or scared takes away our freedom and capacity to make choices in lots of different situations.\n\nFor example, if someone is in an abusive relationship, they might say 'yes' to something out of fear for their own wellbeing or the wellbeing of other people – which is a long way away from saying 'yes' because they really wanted to. The fear took away their freedom and capacity to make a real choice.\n\nMost of us would recognise that, if someone stands behind you at a cash machine and asks for your PIN number while holding a knife to your back and you give it to them, you aren’t consenting to being robbed.\n\nWell, it's similar with sex. Although, in this case, the 'knife' could be something entirely different – such as the threat of someone sharing a sexually explicit photo of another person. Or spreading lies about them. Or making them feel worthless.\n\nConsent is not like a permit or voucher that we can use up until its expiry date or at any point in the future. The person who really wanted to have sex with us last night might not want to have sex with us this morning and that’s 100% their right.\n\nIt also makes no difference if you're married to someone or in a relationship with them. You still need to get their consent. Every. Single Time.\n\nConsent does not look like:\n\nFeeling like you have to agree to sex or other sexual activity because you’re worried about the other person’s reaction if you say ‘no’.\n\nSomeone having sex with you or touching you in a sexual manner when you’re asleep or unconscious.\n\nSomeone continuing with sexual activity despite your non-verbal cues that you don’t want it to continue or you’re not sure – for example, if you pull away, freeze or seem uncomfortable.\n\nSomeone assuming that you want to have sex or take part in other sexual activity because of your actions or what you’re wearing – for example, flirting, accepting a drink, wearing a short skirt.\n\nSomeone assuming that you want to have sex or take part in other sexual activity with them because you’ve had sex or taken part in other sexual activity with them before.\n\nSomeone assuming that you want to take part in one type of sexual activity because you wanted to take part in another.\n\nSomeone removing a condom during sex after you only agreed to have sex with one (what is known as 'stealthing').\n\nPlease know, however, that these are just a few examples of what consent doesn’t look like.\n\nIf you didn’t want something to happen then you didn’t give your consent. You also didn’t give your consent if you weren’t capable of deciding whether or not you wanted it – for example, if you were a child or if you were drunk.\n\nAnd if there was no consent then it was sexual violence.\n\nThis means that sexual activity between two or more people is always unlawful if at least one of the people is under the age of 16.\n\nIt doesn't matter if:\n\nAll those involved are the same age or very close in age.\n\nThose under the age of 16 have given their consent (in line with the definition above).\n\nHowever, not everyone who does something unlawful is charged with a crime and taken to court (prosecuted). It is up to prosecutors to decide whether it is in the 'public interest' for this to happen – and, when making this decision, they have to take certain factors into account."
