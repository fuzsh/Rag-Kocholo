        "text": "Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), some office in-person pick up is suspended until further notice.\n\nThe Lost & Found contacts are for items left at TSA security checkpoints or items missing from checked baggage. For items left in other areas of the airport, please check the airport's website for contact information.\n\nItems left behind at TSA security checkpoints are held by TSA for a minimum of 30 days or until the item is reunited with the original owner.\n\nElectronics\n\nPassengers are encouraged to place their contact information on the outside of their electronics, such as laptops, in case the item is left behind. TSA will make every effort to reunite passengers with their belongings.\n\nUnclaimed electronics will have its memory removed and destroyed (e.g. laptop hard drive) or be destroyed completely (e.g. items with non-removable memory) to protect personal data after the 30-day holding period.\n\nClaiming Items\n\nPassengers may return to the airport to pick up their item or may approve someone else, in writing, to do so. Items can be shipped back to the owner at the ownerâ€™s expense. TSA is not authorized to spend money to return items to passengers."
