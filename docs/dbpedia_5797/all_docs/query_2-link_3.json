        "text": "What actually is \"sex\" (in reference to the activity of sexual contact involving genitals)?\n\nIs there an objective definition? Are there subjective definitions? How does a person know or can understand what \"sex\" is and whether or not they've engaged in it?\n\nIs it physical contact with another person's genitals (**and does it matter or differ if done with, say, one's hand, mouth, or own genitals**)?\n\nIs it only when an orgasm occurs as a result of any of the previous methods, or is an orgasm not defining of having \"had sex\"?\n\nHow does it relate to the inquiry of whether or not someone has been \"sexually active\" (medically-speaking)?\n\nI think sex would be defined as the consensual action of attempting to reach orgasm with another individual(s). Whether using a hand mouth or other part to attempt to reach an orgasm, it should still be considered a form of sex but there are still subjective definitions regarding things like virginity. Typically the sex has to be penetrative in order to be considered \"sex\" in regards to virginity. Medically speaking I believe my first definition is more important, because all forms of sex can result in medically relevant issues. I should note that in my definition, the word attempt is important because I think that it would still be considered sex even if orgasm is not achieved. No matter what though it is not sex if it isn't consensual, meaning there was no coercion in any way.\n\nI hope this helped\n\n4 hours ago, Logandus said:\n\nTypically the sex has to be penetrative in order to be considered \"sex\" in regards to virginity.\n\nWhich is hypocritical. And reducing only penetrative stuff to \"sex\" leads to a flippant perception of lesbians: some people really believe that two women can't have \"proper sex\", \"real sex\", \"sex-sex\".\n\nI, anyway, don't really like saying that \"I'm a virgin\", I much prefer saying that \"I have never had sex\" - but at least I'm not hypocritical because I have indeed had no partnered sexual contact of any kind.\n\nI would attempt to define sex as physical contact (1) between two or, sometimes, more people (to distinguish it from autoeroticism, which is a \"sexual activity\", but not \"sex\"), (2) with the aim of achieving pleasure, and (3) including contact of one person's intimate parts, hands, mouth, other body parts or an object held by them with the other person's intimate parts. This would, I think, more or less capture all the variants.\n\nTMI Warning\n\nI normally define sex as “an activity between two or more people where physical contact is made with at least one person’s genitalia for pleasure and/or procreation”.\n\nI think each country has a legal definition of what constitutes sexual intercourse (for the sake of prosecuting when it’s not consensual or otherwise legal), but what individuals use to define whether they’ve had sex or not is highly subjective.\n\nMedically I believe it is only possible to determine whether a female-bodied person has had penetrative sex, but I understand that this is controversial.\n\n2 hours ago, Logandus said:\n\nMedically speaking I believe my first definition is more important, because all forms of sex can result in medically relevant issues.\n\nDoes it though? Your definition includes hand-with-genital contact which, as far as I'm aware, does not cause any medical issues. I do know about the medical issues that can arise from the mouth-to-genitalia type of contact.\n\nI don't have a good definition to offer, but roughly speaking I consider oral, vaginal and anal to be \"sex\", and my understanding is that virginity is determined by whether or not someone has had vaginal or anal sex. This is inclusive of sex between two women. Handjobs I would consider a sexual interaction, but not \"sex\", though I don't particularly care if other people define that as \"sex\" and count them towards \"losing virginity\", the concept of virginity is silly and arbitrary anyway.\n\nI think its very subjective. Different people consider different things to be \"sex\". In general that can be OK, but it can lead to all sorts of communication problems. For one person \"sex\" can be any action that results in a orgasm, for another its specifically PIV. If they are discussion how one wants more or less \"sex\" they may be talking about completely different things. They may also not recognize what is important to the other person.\n\nIts all about communication."
