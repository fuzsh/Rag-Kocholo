        "text": "Drinking alcohol can increase your:\n\nconfidence with sexual partners\n\nsexual desire\n\nBut it can have a bad effect on what happens in bed.\n\nAlcohol can also cause long-term problems with sex and fertility.\n\nHow alcohol can affect sex and fertility\n\nProblems with erections\n\nDrinking large amounts of alcohol can make it hard to get or keep an erection. This is called erectile dysfunction (ED).\n\nAlcohol interferes with the messengers in the brain that tell the penis to fill with blood.\n\nIt can also happen because alcohol can reduce the production of testosterone. Testosterone is the hormone that controls male sexual functions.\n\nED is normally a temporary problem.\n\nProblems with orgasms\n\nAlcohol interferes with your ability to feel sexual stimulation. It does this by interfering with the signals between the brain and the genitals.\n\nAfter heavy drinking you may:\n\nfind it hard to ejaculate (come) or may ejaculate too fast\n\nfind it harder to have an orgasm, or have less intense orgasms\n\nSex drive (libido)\n\nDrinking heavily over a long period of time can lead to a lower sex drive (libido). This is because it reduces your levels of testosterone.\n\nShrinking of sex organs\n\nHigh-risk drinking over a long time can cause the testes and penis to shrink.\n\nFertility\n\nLowered testosterone can affect sperm production. This can reduce fertility.\n\nWomen who drink heavily for a long time may find they stop ovulating.\n\nEven small amounts of alcohol can affect fertility.\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs)"
