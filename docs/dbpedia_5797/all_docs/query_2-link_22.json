        "text": "Sexual Activity\n\nSex is a completely natural and normal activity – meant to be an intimate act, whether it is self-pleasuring or masturbation, or shared with someone you trust.\n\nBecoming sexually active with a partner is a deeply personal decision that may be influenced by your family values or by what your friends are doing or what you see online or on TV. But only you know if and when you are ready for sex. When you are ready, sexual activity should be pleasurable for both you and your partner.\n\nIf you are sexually active or are considering having sex for the first time, be sure to read through this website, especially the sections on consent, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and birth control. It’s important to learn as much as you can and to protect yourself from unwanted surprises. And even if you’ve been sexually active for many years, there’s always more to learn."
