        "text": "When I checked off queer instead of straight, I expected the adjustment to make my chest swell with pride over my newfound conviction. But really, I didn't feel anything at all. So I clicked back and forth for five more minutes, considering my options until I became frustrated with my own indecision. I left the queer box checked and submitted the form — then I forgot about it.\n\nAs Insider's resident sex and relationships reporter, I've spent nearly five years writing about sexuality. But when it came to my own, I avoided labels as soon as I started to consider them in my mid-20s, worrying that picking one would cause others to expect more, or something different, of me. But whose expectations did I have to live up to, really, besides my own? And was the expectation I set for myself — to stay detached from my sexual identity until I felt certain of it — even fair?\n\nChallenging my assumed heterosexuality as a newly single 20-something woman\n\nOver the next year and a half, I used dating apps for the first time and went on dates with all kinds of men, seeing how each brought out different sides of my personality. Sometimes I'd wonder what a date with a woman might be like, but then I'd move on, already overwhelmed with the newness of dating as an adult.\n\nRelated stories\n\nJust when I felt like I started to get a handle on roster dating, I met my now-boyfriend and felt fulfilled deepening our connection and leaving the dating scene behind. For the most part, I stopped thinking about the work form until February, when I watched Cara Delevingne's new show, \"Planet Sex.\"\n\nThe six-episode BBC series is not something I would have picked to watch on my own, as I'm not a fan of Delevingne and find her persona a bit grating. But the show's concept — that Delevingne is not a sex expert but an eager-to-learn newbie who wants to understand her sexuality better — had me intrigued enough to watch a few episodes for work.\n\nWhen I watched Delevingne look visibly awkward during a women-only group-masturbation class and admit that for all of the press about her relationships, she still felt uncertain about her sexual trajectory, I found myself questioning the parameters I put on myself.\n\nThe truth is, sexual labels are meant for the person picking them, but they aren't required to feel secure or valid in one's sexuality, as the nonbinary and queer therapist and \"Gender Magic\" author Rae McDaniel previously told me.\n\nI used to feel like my inability to label my sexuality meant I didn't deserve to partake in, or even consider, my queerness. But after watching \"Planet Sex,\" I decided to try being curious instead of worried about the uncertain parts of myself. I asked my bisexual friend for advice, and she suggested I attend more queer events in my community. I made a point to listen to music from queer artists and saw one, the indie-pop trio Muna, live in concert with another bisexual friend. I felt the way I'd imagined I would when I checked off \"queer\" on that work form two years earlier.\n\nWhen I learned how to see and accept the nuances of my sexuality, I no longer feared the uncertainty I felt. Through my work, I often help people consider the gray areas of their lives and relationships, and now I was doing that for myself. It felt exciting to be open to new labels, knowing they are always in flux.\n\nAfter years of avoiding labels, I finally decided to come out as bisexual.\n\nLabeling my sexuality was a scary yet rewarding exercise in self-acceptance\n\nThree months after my \"Planet Sex'' epiphany, I grabbed drinks with college friends. We chatted about my newly single friend's dating adventures as a bisexual woman. Another friend, who once said she was bi-curious, said she couldn't imagine performing oral sex on another woman. There was a pause, which I'd normally use to silently overthink my own stance. This time, I decided to fill it.\n\n\"I guess I'm bisexual. I never have, but I would try it,\" I said, trying on the label. Before I could get another word in, they had moved on to discussing birthday plans. To me, the lack of gravity in that moment felt exhilarating. My sexuality informed part of our conversation, but it wasn't the topic of conversation.\n\nI'm still learning about my sexuality, but I no longer fixate on my pace or the choices I make along the way. Earlier this month, I made plans to attend my neighborhood's Pride Month block party, but ended up skipping it when my friend canceled at the last minute. I still haven't had sex with a woman. After 10 months of dating, I told my boyfriend that I'm bisexual then immediately worried about his reaction. He smiled, said he was glad I told him, and then continued driving through a sun shower toward the brightest rainbow we'd ever seen.\n\nI don't know if that label will fit my identity forever. And that's OK. But if I decide to change it, I'll no longer view it as a sign that I don't know myself. Instead, it's a sign that I accept myself wholly, even the parts I'm just starting to understand."
