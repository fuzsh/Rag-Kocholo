Then copy-paste the list of emails to create a filter for multiple emails in the format from:{email1, email2, ...}, as described here.\n\nHere's the step-by-step procedure:\n\nIn gmail Compose a new message\n\nIn the To: field type the name of the Group (aka the label)\n\nPress Tab - this will expand the list of recipients\n\nPress Ctrl-A to select all recipients (or click the first recipient to select it, then Shift-click the last recipient to select all recipients)\n\nCopy the recipients with Ctrl-C\n\nIn the Search mail field enter -from:{LIST}, where LIST is the list of emails you copied (you can paste it with Ctrl-V)\n\nThe - is because you asked for \"all messages not associated with those contacts in the label\".\n\nThe {...} is an \"OR\" operator.\n\nMy answer may be a little late but I just faced this problem. What I did is I created a folder labeled to automatically put every message that arrived from or sent to my contacts. For this, I need 2 filters for each contact. Then I create another filter to handle each post with the created label. If I have a new contact to add, I would simply redirect the message to this label."
