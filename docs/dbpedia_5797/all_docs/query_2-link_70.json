        "text": "Sexual Activity\n\nEarly sexual activity is associated with emotional94 and physical health risks. Youth who engage in sexual activity are at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and becoming pregnant. STIs, including HIV, can infect a person for a lifetime and have consequences, including disability and early death. Delaying sexual initiation is associated with a decrease in the number of lifetime sexual partners,95 and having fewer lifetime partners is associated with a decrease in the rate of STIs.96, 97 In addition, teen pregnancy is associated with a number of negative risk factors, for not only the mother but also for her child (see FAM6).\n\nIndicator BEH4.A: Percentage of high school students who reported ever having had sexual intercourse by grade, selected years 1991â€“2021\n\nThe percentage of students reporting ever having had sexual intercourse declined from 54% in 1991 to 46% in 2001 and was relatively stable through 2013 (47%) before decreasing to 38% in 2019, and 30% in 2021.98\n\nBetween 1991 and 2021, the percentage of students reporting ever having had sexual intercourse declined among all four grades: 9th grade (39% to 16%), 10th grade (48% to 23%), 11th grade (62% to 35%), and 12th grade (67% to 48%).\n\nIndicator BEH4.C: Among high school students who reported having had sexual intercourse during the past 3 months, the percentage who reported use of birth control pills to prevent pregnancy before last sexual intercourse with opposite-sex partner by grade, 2021\n\nAmong sexually active students, the percentage reporting they or their partner used a condom the last time they had intercourse increased between 1991 (46%) and 2005 (63%) and then decreased to 52% in 2021.\n\nThe percentage of students who used birth control pills before last sexual intercourse with opposite-sex partner (to prevent pregnancy, not counting emergency contraception such as Plan B or the \"morning after\" pill, among students who were currently sexually active) was 21% in 2021, ranging from 10% in 9th grade to 26% in 12th grade."
