        "text": "This page contains information on certain EPA-registered disinfectants, including links to lists of products registered against common pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 (CoVID-19) or Norovirus.\n\nOn this page:\n\nWhat is a Disinfectant Product?\n\nWhat is a Disinfectant Product Label?\n\nHow to Read Registration Numbers\n\nDirections for Use\n\nAntimicrobial Products Registered with EPA for Claims Against Common Pathogens\n\nAdditional information\n\nWhat is a Disinfectant Product?\n\nA disinfectant is a substance, or mixture of substances that destroys or irreversibly inactivates bacteria, fungi and viruses, but not necessarily bacterial spores in the inanimate environment, such as on hard surfaces. Disinfectant products are often used in hospitals, medical facilities and/or households. EPA regulates disinfectants to ensure the pesticide meets specific standards before they can be used by the public. Disinfectants are pesticides and can be harmful, please be sure to read and understand any precautionary language or any safety information before using the product. See more information under Additional Resources section.\n\nWhat is a Disinfectant Product Label?\n\nThe term label is defined as the written, printed words or graphics on or attached to the product or its container. EPA regulates and registers antimicrobial pesticides and approves the label language. EPA ensures that pesticides meet minimum standards for registration to certify that they are effective against certain types of microorganisms. EPA verifies disinfectants work according to their label directions. It is important to read and understand the product label before you use it. Each registered product lists the microorganisms that it is effective against. If a disinfectant product's label doesn't include disinfection directions for a certain pathogen, EPA has not reviewed any data on whether the product is safe and effective when used in this way. As a note, the lists are not inclusive of all products that may qualify. The lists are updated at regular intervals to include newer registrations; however, some older products may not have been included. If a product is missing from the lists that should be added, please contact disinfectantslist@epa.gov.\n\nHow to Read Registration Numbers\n\nEach label has a registration number. This number is a unique identifier of the product. The same product can have different names and be sold under a variety of company names. The only way to accurately identify a product is by the EPA registration number. See How to Read a Disinfectant Label (png) for more information.\n\nRegistration numbers can be found on the product label that is affixed to the product container.\n\nRegistration numbers will have two or three parts that are separated by dashes.\n\nThe first two parts of this registration number reflect the primary registration, while the third part of the registration number identifies the supplemental distributor’s EPA company number. Not all products are supplemental distributer products.\n\nIf your product's registration number has two parts (e.g., 1234-12), it is a primary registration number. For example, if you find this number on any of the disinfectant lists (e.g., List H), the product is qualified for use against that pathogen (e.g., MRSA and/or VRE).\n\nIf your product's registration number has three parts (e.g., 1234-12-123), you have a supplemental distributor product. These products have the same chemical composition and efficacy as primary products. These are sold under different names by different companies and with different logos. Supplemental distributer products are not included in the lists. For example, if EPA Reg. No. 12345-12 is identified on the lists, you can buy EPA Reg. No. 12345-12-2567 and know you’re getting an equivalent product.\n\nDisinfectant products may be marketed and sold under different brand and product names. It is important to read the registration number properly to make sure the correct product is on the desired list. Using the EPA registration number is the best way to accurately identify a product.\n\nMore information on how to tell if a product you are interested in is on the list.\n\nDirections for Use\n\nWhen reading the product label, one of the most important sections is the Directions for Use section (sometimes also called Use Directions). This section provides all the necessary information needed by consumers to properly and effectively use disinfectant products.\n\nFor example, the Directions for Use provide information on:\n\nWhere a product can be used. This includes use sites such as: counter tops, doors and doorknobs, hospital beds, chairs, etc.\n\nFor more information on use sites see the Additional Resources Section below.\n\nHow to properly use the product.\n\nProducts can be liquids, sprays, powders or wipes.\n\nThe product should be used or applied according to the Use Directions. This may include how far away from the surface to spray a product or how to properly dilute the product for example.\n\nHow takes for the product to work.\n\nThis is also called the contact time. The contact time is the time the product must remain on the surface for it to be effective. The surface should be visibly wet for the entire contact time. This may mean the product needs to be reapplied.\n\nFor example, if the product label has a contact time of 10 minutes for a particular pathogen, the surface should remain visibly wet for at least 10 minutes after application of the product. If after 5 minutes the surface is not visibly wet, more product should be applied to the surface.\n\nContact time conversion table:\n\nContact time in minutes Contact time in seconds 0.17 minutes 10 seconds 0.25 minutes 15 seconds 0.5 minutes 30 seconds 1 minute 60 seconds 1.5 minutes 90 seconds\n\nAntimicrobial Products Registered with EPA for Claims Against Common Pathogens\n\nThe following lists of antimicrobial products registered by EPA are effective against common pathogens, as indicated in the list titles (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 [List N]). EPA-registered antimicrobial products may not make efficacy claims against these pathogens unless the Agency has reviewed data to support the claim and approved the claim on the label.\n\nUse of the listed EPA-registered products consistent with the product labeling complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration‘s requirements for Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens (29 C.F.R. 1910) as well as proper management of any waste when disposed, which is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).\n\nEPA updates these registered disinfectant lists periodically to reflect new products, label changes to existing products, cancellations, and transfers of product registrations. Inclusion of products on these lists does not constitute an endorsement of one product over another, or endorsement by EPA. Before applying any EPA-registered disinfectant product, users must read and understand the label to determine if the product is approved for the intended-use site or pest. If you would like to review the product label information for any of these products, please visit our product label system.\n\nInformation about listed products is current as indicated by the dates on the lists.\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective as Sterilizers [List A]\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) [List B]\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Norovirus (Feline calicivirus) [List G]\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and/or Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus faecalis or faecium (VRE) [List H]\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products for Medical Waste Treatment [List J]\n\nEPA's Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Clostridium difficile Spores [List K]\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Ebola Virus [List L]\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Avian Influenza [List M]\n\nDisinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2 [List N]\n\nDisinfectants for Use Against Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV2) [List O]\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Candida auris [List P]\n\nDisinfectants for Emerging Viral Pathogens (EVPs) [List Q]\n\nEPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Bloodborne Pathogens (HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C) [List S]\n\nEPA’s List C: EPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Human HIV-1 Virus; List D: EPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Human HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus; List E: EPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Human HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus; and List F: EPA’s Registered Disinfectants for use Against Hepatitis C have been retired and will redirect to the new Bloodborne pathogens list [List S]. EPA List C, List D, List E and List F have been retired and were consolidated to the EPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Bloodborne Pathogens (HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C) [List S] for more accessibility and to make the disinfectant list more useable by the general public and healthcare providers.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nIf you hold the primary registration for a product you believe should be added to a list, please email the disinfectantslist@epa.gov. In the subject line of your email include: “Include Product(s) on List [Insert list Identifier]; [Registration #(s)].” In the body, identify the Company Name, Registration Number(s), and primary brand name(s) of the product(s). Your request will be reviewed, and the list will be corrected."
