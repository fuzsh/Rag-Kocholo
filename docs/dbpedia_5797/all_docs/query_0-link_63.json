        "text": "The Parental Advisory label is a notice to consumers that recordings identified by this mark may contain strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse. Parental discretion is advised.\n\nThe following guidelines and requirements (“Standards”) apply to all participants in the voluntary, RIAA-administered, parental advisory label (“PAL”) program. Any such entity is referred to herein as a “Participant.”\n\nThis version of the Standards in its entirety is effective as of October 23, 2006, and supersedes all prior versions. The RIAA reserves the right to modify these Standards at any time with or without notice, and encourages Participants to review the Standards frequently to ensure that Participants are aware of any modifications.\n\nThe Standards include the following guidelines and requirements:\n\nUniform Guidelines for Determining Whether a Sound Recording Should Use a PAL Mark\n\nGuidelines and Requirements Regarding Use of a Mark on Physical Products\n\nGuidelines and Requirements Regarding PAL Notices in Consumer Advertisements\n\nGuidelines and Requirements Regarding PAL Notices in Digital Distribution\n\nUniform Guidelines for Determining Whether a Sound Recording Should Use a PAL Notice\n\nParticipant record labels and/or artists should use the following guidelines to determine whether any particular sound recording contains strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse to such an extent as to merit parental notification, as described in more detail in these Standards. Strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse to such an extent is referred to herein as “PAL Content.” Only the record label or artist that owns and/or distributes the particular sound recording may determine whether the sound recording contains PAL Content and warrants the use of a PAL Notice.\n\nA determination that a sound recording contains PAL Content is not a statement as to whether the sound recording is or is not suitable for particular listeners. Nor is the absence of any notification that a sound recording contains PAL Content a statement that the sound recording is completely devoid of strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse. Rather, it is utilized to (i) provide parents, consumers, and companies within the sales or distribution chain notice that parental discretion is advised when purchasing the particular sound recording for children or when listening to the sound recording with children present and (ii) guide the labeling, marketing, and distribution of the sound recording. A record label or artist determination that a sound recording contains PAL Content shall result in the use of PAL Content indicators, as more fully described in these Standards, to provide notice of the PAL Content. Such indicators are referred to herein as “PAL Notices.” A record label or artist may also choose to make an Edited Version (defined below) of a sound recording and provide notice that an Edited Version is available.\n\nIt is obviously not possible to define each individual situation in which a record label or artist should determine that a sound recording contains PAL Content. In making such a determination, however, record labels and artists should consider:\n\nThat contemporary cultural morals and standards should be used in determining whether parents or guardians would find the sound recording suitable for children;\n\nThe context in which the material is used, as some words, phrases, sounds, or descriptions might be offensive to parents if spotlighted or emphasized, but might not offend if merely part of the background or a minimal part of the lyrics;\n\nThe context of the artist performing the material, as well as the expectations of the artist’s audience;\n\nThat lyrics are often susceptible to varying interpretations, and that words can have different meanings and should not be viewed in isolation from the music that accompanies them (i.e., lyrics when accompanied by loud and raucous music can be perceived differently than the same lyrics when accompanied by soft and soothing music);\n\n5. That such a determination requires sensitivity and common sense, and that context, frequency, and emphasis are obviously important; isolated or unintelligible references to certain material might be insufficient to warrant labeling a particular sound recording as containing PAL Content;\n\nThat these Standards apply to the case of a single track commercially released as well as to full albums (whether released in the form of a CD, cassette or any other configuration); and\n\nThat a sound recording may contain strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse, yet due to other factors involved, may not merit a designation as containing PAL Content.\n\nThat these Standards apply to the case of a single track commercially released as well as to full albums (whether released in the form of a CD, vinyl record, or any other physical or digital format); and\n\nThat a sound recording may contain strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse, yet due to other factors involved, may not merit a designation as containing PAL Content.\n\nThe record label or artist determination that a sound recording contains PAL Content shall affect the marketing, sale, and distribution of such sound recording, as described in greater detail throughout these Standards. For purposes of clarification, only the applicable record label or artist shall determine whether any particular sound recording contains PAL Content, and all other Participants shall abide by the applicable record label or artist’s determination.\n\nEdited Versions\n\nIt is recommended, although not required, that when practicable the applicable record label or artist create an edited version of a PAL Content sound recording that does not include all of the same content contained in the original, and that no longer merits a PAL Notice. Such version is referred to herein as the “Edited Version.” An Edited Version need not remove all potentially objectionable content from the sound recording. For example, some such content might be retained in order not to compromise artistic expression.\n\nAudio-Visual Products\n\nThe applicable record label or artist shall review all audio-visual products that incorporate a sound recording as a predominant feature (e.g., music videos, concert performances, etc.) separate and independent of any review solely related to the sound recording component. Such review shall utilize the standards listed herein and shall take into account the audio and visual components as a whole. In situations where a third-party Participant other than a record label or artist owns the audio-visual product containing the sound recording, such third party may utilize the guidelines listed herein to determine whether the audio-visual product contains PAL Content. For purposes of clarification, (i) any audio-visual product that contains a PAL Content sound recording shall also be deemed to contain PAL Content and (ii) the use of a sound recording that does not contain PAL Content shall not preclude a determination that the audio-visual product contains PAL Content.\n\nGuidelines and Requirements Regarding Use of a Mark on Physical Products\n\nParticipants shall apply the following guidelines and requirements to the labeling of physical products that contain PAL Content sound recordings.\n\nAny physical product that contains a PAL Content sound recording as a predominant feature of the product shall include the PAL Notice listed below (the “Mark”). All such physical products are referred to herein as “Covered Physical Products,” and shall include CDs, DVDs, vinyl records, and such other current or future physical media in which a sound recording may be embodied. The RIAA owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Mark, and a Participant shall not use, reproduce, display, or distribute the Mark in any manner absent the execution of a separate written agreement between the RIAA and a Participant authorizing such use, reproduction, display, or distribution.\n\nA Covered Physical Product shall not include any designation to indicate that a sound recording does or does not contain PAL Content other than as specifically described herein. For example, a Participant shall not label an Edited Version of a Covered Physical Product as “Clean” or “Non-explicit.”\n\nA Covered Physical Product shall not contain a PAL Notice that is inconsistent with a record label or artist’s original designation as to whether a sound recording contains PAL Content. For example, a Participant shall not label a sound recording as containing PAL Content if the applicable record label or artist determines that the sound recording does not contain PAL Content. Similarly, a Participant shall not fail to label a sound recording as containing PAL Content if the applicable record label or artist determines the sound recording contains PAL Content.\n\nCovered Physical Products that contain PAL Content sound recordings shall include the following Mark:\n\nThe use of the Mark on a Covered Physical Product is not a determination of whether the Covered Physical Product is or is not appropriate for particular listeners. Nor is the absence of a Mark a statement that the Covered Physical Product is completely devoid of all references to strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse. Rather, it is utilized to (i) provide parents, consumers, and companies within the sales or distribution chain notice that parental discretion is advised when purchasing the Covered Physical Product for children or when listening to the sound recording embodied in the Covered Physical Product with children present and (ii) guide the marketing and distribution of the Covered Physical Product.\n\nParticipants shall follow the following guidelines and requirements when using the Mark on a Covered Physical Product:\n\nParticipants shall clearly and conspicuously display the Mark in a legible, non-removable form on the Covered Physical Product cover artwork (as opposed to on any wrapper, jewel-case, removable sticker, or cellophane covering).\n\nIt is recommended, although not required, that Participants place the Mark on the bottom left or right corner of the Covered Physical Product front cover, although a Participant may determine the precise positioning on a case-by-case basis dependent upon such factors as the Covered Physical Product’s particular artwork design and color.\n\nParticipants shall display the Mark in black and white. It is recommended, although not required, that the Mark measure no less than 1” by 5/8”.\n\nIt is recommended, though not required, that any Edited Version Iinclude a label that indicates such edited designation by stating “Edited Version” (“Edited Version Label”). If the Edited Version Label is used, participants shall clearly and conspicuously display the Edited Version Label in a legible manner on the cover artwork itself, or on any wrapper, sticker, jewel-case, or cellophane covering, and shall locate the Edited Version Label either on the front cover or on the top spine of the cover. The Edited Version Label provides notice that the sound recording is a modified version of the PAL Content original, does not include all of the same content contained in the original, and no longer merits a PAL Notice. The use of the Edited Version Label does not necessarily mean, however, that the record label or artist removed all potentially objectionable content from the sound recording. For example, some such content might be retained in order not to compromise artistic expression. In no event should the Edited Version be marked as “Clean” or “Non-Explicit”.\n\nIt is recommended, although not required, that any Participant that distributes Covered Physical Products via an online or mobile distribution platform adopt a parental control mechanism designed to aid parents in controlling the distribution of PAL Content sound recordings via the distribution platform.\n\nGuidelines and Requirements Regarding PAL Notices in Consumer Advertisements\n\nParticipants shall follow the following guidelines and requirements in relation to any consumer advertising, marketing, and promotions (“Advertisement(s)”) for sound recordings that contain PAL Content. These Advertisement guidelines and requirements are designed to (i) provide parents, consumers, and companies within the sales or distribution chain notice that parental discretion is advised when purchasing the PAL Content sound recording for children or when listening to the sound recording with children present and (ii) guide the marketing and distribution of the sound recording.\n\nAdvertisements related to sound recordings that contain PAL Content shall clearly and conspicuously communicate the presence of PAL Content in the sound recording. Such advertisements may also, but are not required to, communicate the availability of a corresponding Edited Version, if such an Edited Version exists.\n\nFor any audio only Advertisement, the Advertisement may state during or immediately after the Advertisement that the advertised sound recording contains PAL Content and, if desired and applicable, whether an Edited Version exists. If such a statement is made, the audio only Advertisement shall only use the words “Explicit Content – Parental Advisory,” and, if applicable, “Edited Version Also Available” in providing such disclosures.\n\nFor any print, television, mobile, or online Advertisement, the Advertisement may include (i) the Mark for the sound recording or (ii) the words “Explicit Content – Parental Advisory,” “Explicit Content,” “Explicit,” or “Parental Advisory,” in legible form and in close proximity to the title or artwork for the applicable sound recording. If an Edited Version of the sound recording exists, the Advertisement may include the words “Edited Version Also Available” in legible form and in close proximity to the applicable sound recording.\n\nFor any print, television, mobile, or online Advertisement that contains a miniature depiction of a Covered Physical Product, or merely the title of the Covered Physical Product, the Advertisement may include the words “Explicit Content – Parental Advisory,” “Explicit Content,” “Explicit,” or “Parental Advisory,” in legible form and in close proximity to the title or artwork for the applicable sound recording. If an Edited Version of the Covered Physical Product exists, the Advertisement may include the words “Edited Version Also Available” in legible form and in close proximity to the applicable sound recording or title.\n\nAn Advertisement shall not include any designation to indicate that a sound recording does or does not contain PAL Content other than as specifically described herein. For example, a Participant shall not label an Edited Version of a Covered Physical Product as “Clean” or “Non-explicit” in an Advertisement.\n\nAn Advertisement shall not contain a PAL Notice that is inconsistent with a record label or artist’s original designation as to whether a sound recording contains PAL Content. For example, a Participant shall not label a sound recording as containing PAL Content if the applicable record label or artist determines that the sound recording does not contain PAL Content. Similarly, a Participant shall not fail to label a sound recording as containing PAL Content if the applicable record label or artist determines the sound recording contains PAL Content.\n\nDisplaying a Covered Physical Product in a manner that renders the Mark on such Covered Physical Product illegible shall not satisfy the requirement that an Advertisement clearly and conspicuously communicate the presence of PAL Content in the sound recording.\n\nIt is recommended, although not required, that an Advertisement that contains a miniature depiction of a Covered Physical Product contain a PAL Notice in addition to the Mark as embedded within the miniature Covered Physical Product cover artwork.\n\nGuidelines and Requirements Regarding PAL Notices in Digital Distribution\n\nParticipants shall follow the following guidelines and requirements in relation to the digital distribution of sound recordings.\n\nAny digital distribution platform for sound recordings (including as incorporated into an audio-visual product) shall incorporate the Mark (or such other PAL Notice) and, if desired and applicable, an Edited Version Label into such delivery platform, as more fully described below. All such digital distribution platforms are referred to herein as “Covered Digital Platforms,” and shall include online, wireless, cellular telecommunications, and mobile download, and streaming sites and services that distribute sound recordings, and such other current or future digital platforms through or on which a sound recording may be distributed to an end user.\n\nA Covered Digital Platform shall not include any designation to indicate that a sound recording does or does not contain PAL Content other than as specifically described herein. For example, Participants shall not label an Edited Version of a sound recording distributed through a Covered Digital Platform as “Clean” or “Non-explicit.”\n\nA Covered Digital Platform shall not contain a PAL Notice that is inconsistent with a record label or artist’s original designation as to whether a sound recording contains PAL Content. For example, a Participant shall not label a sound recording as containing PAL Content if the applicable record label or artist determines that the sound recording does not contain PAL Content. Similarly, a Participant shall not fail to label a sound recording as containing PAL Content if the applicable record label or artist determines the sound recording contains PAL Content.\n\nThe use of a PAL Notice for a sound recording made available via a Covered Digital Platform is not a determination of whether the sound recording is or is not appropriate for particular listeners. Nor is the absence of any PAL Notice a statement that the sound recording is completely devoid of all references to strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse. Rather, it is utilized to (i) provide parents, consumers, and companies within the sales or distribution chain notice that parental discretion is advised when purchasing the particular sound recording for children or when listening to the sound recording with children present and (ii) guide the labeling, marketing, and distribution of the sound recording.\n\nTo the extent technologically feasible, a Covered Digital Platform shall follow the following guidelines:"
