        "text": "Outercourse is an option for sexual activity without intercourse. It may have different meanings depending on who you ask. For some, it’s like abstinence, while for others, it’s not.\n\nFor some people, outercourse is everything except penis-in-vagina (PIV) penetration. For others, outercourse means no penetration of any kind, including fingers, sex toys, and anal sex.\n\nSome choose outercourse as a safe sex alternative. They put boundaries around any activity that can cause pregnancy or transmit sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nYour personal definition of outercourse may depend on your reasons for trying it.\n\nIntrigued? Read on to learn more about how it works and what this might mean for you.\n\nSince the definition of outercourse varies, the activities that count as outercourse all depend on who’s practicing it.\n\nOutercourse might include any of the following:\n\nKissing\n\nDon’t underestimate the power of a kiss. Making out can be a great way to build intimacy. Kissing different parts of the body can help you and your partner discover what turns you on.\n\nMassage\n\nGetting your massage on can be super sexy in the right circumstances. Set the scene with some candles or mood lighting, and use lubrication like hot or scented oils. Share intimate details with your partner about where you both like to get rubbed down.\n\nDry humping\n\nThat’s a term you might not have heard in a while. But dry humping isn’t just for teenagers. Grinding your body against your partner’s can be pleasurable at any age. You can even see how you like different positions, clothing materials, and role play for different types of pleasure.\n\nMutual masturbation (in some definitions)\n\nWho knows how you like to be touched better than yourself? Masturbation doesn’t have to be a solo activity. You and your partner can masturbate together while kissing, cuddling, and showing each other what feels good.\n\nSex toys (in some definitions)\n\nThere’s a whole world of sex toys out there just waiting to be explored, and there’s a good chance you can find one for the type of stimulation you’re looking for.\n\nFor example, if you want genital stimulation without penetration, vibrators can target the clitoris or the head of the penis for an arousing time.\n\nManual stimulation (in some definitions)\n\nYou and your partner can take turns pleasuring each other with hand jobs or fingering, or pleasure each other at the same time.\n\nHere’s one way to keep things exciting: Try various types of lubricants, like warming and cooling lubes, to see how you like different sensations along with your hand and finger play.\n\nOral sex (in some definitions)\n\nBlow jobs, cunnilingus, rimming: There are many options for using your mouth on your partner’s genitals and other pleasure zones. And when your partner’s mouth is giving you oral sex, let them know what you’d like more and less of.\n\nAnal sex (in some definitions)\n\nAnal sex can be enjoyable for people of all genders and can involve a penis or sex toys. Your ideal sex toys for anal penetration might be different from the ones you like for other body parts, so anal play can be a chance to try out new toys.\n\nNo intercourse, no pregnancy, right? At least, that’s usually the idea if intercourse would mean PIV penetration.\n\nIt’s true that the chances of pregnancy from outercourse are pretty slim, but it isn’t impossible.\n\nPregnancy can happen if fluids get in the vagina, like by accidentally dripping semen on the vulva or by fingering the vagina after touching semen.\n\nWashing hands after handling ejaculate or pre-ejaculate can help, as well as being careful about where semen ends up anytime it’s involved in your outercourse.\n\nAnother case that could result in pregnancy? Deciding in the moment that you want to have intercourse after all.\n\nIf you’re ready for it, and both you and your partner are in agreement, there’s no reason to beat yourself up about it.\n\nBut unprotected PIV sex can get you or your partner pregnant, even if it only happens once.\n\nJust in case this happens, it’s helpful to keep protection like condoms on hand or to be on birth control."
