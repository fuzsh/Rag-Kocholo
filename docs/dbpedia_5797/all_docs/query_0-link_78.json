Misbranded and falsely advertised textile fiber products\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be misbranded if it is falsely or deceptively stamped, tagged, labeled, invoiced, advertised, or otherwise identified as to the name or amount of constituent fibers contained therein.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be misbranded if a stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification, or substitute therefor authorized by section 70c of this title, is not on or affixed to the product showing in words and figures plainly legible, the following:\n\n(1) The constituent fiber or combination of fibers in the textile fiber product, designating with equal prominence each natural or manufactured fiber in the textile fiber product by its generic name in the order of predominance by the weight thereof if the weight of such fiber is 5 per centum or more of the total fiber weight of the product, but nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the use of a nondeceptive trademark in conjunction with a designated generic name: Provided, That exclusive of permissible ornamentation, any fiber or group of fibers present in an amount of 5 per centum or less by weight of the total fiber content shall not be designated by the generic name or the trademark of such fiber or fibers, but shall be designated only as \"other fiber\" or \"other fibers\" as the case may be, but nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the disclosure of any fiber present in a textile fiber product which has a clearly established and definite functional significance where present in the amount contained in such product.\n\n(2) The percentage of each fiber present, by weight, in the total fiber content of the textile fiber product, exclusive of ornamentation not exceeding 5 per centum by weight of the total fiber content: Provided, That, exclusive of permissible ornamentation, any fiber or group of fibers present in an amount of 5 per centum or less by weight of the total fiber content shall not be designated by the generic name or trademark of such fiber or fibers, but shall be designated only as \"other fiber\" or \"other fibers\" as the case may be but nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the disclosure of any fiber present in a textile fiber product which has a clearly established and definite functional significance where present in the amount stated: Provided further, That in the case of a textile fiber product which contains more than one kind of fiber, deviation in the fiber content of any fiber in such product, from the amount stated on the stamp, tag, label, or other identification shall not be a misbranding under this section unless such deviation is in excess of reasonable tolerances which shall be established by the Commission: And provided further, That any such deviation which exceeds said tolerances shall not be a misbranding if the person charged proves that the deviation resulted from unavoidable variations in manufacture and despite due care to make accurate the statements on the tag, stamp, label, or other identification.\n\n(3) The name, or other identification issued and registered by the Commission, of the manufacturer of the product or one or more persons subject to section 70a of this title with respect to such product.\n\n(4) If it is an imported textile fiber product the name of the country where processed or manufactured.\n\n(5) If it is a textile fiber product processed or manufactured in the United States, it be so identified.\n\n(c) For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised if any disclosure or implication of fiber content is made in any written advertisement which is used to aid, promote, or assist directly or indirectly in the sale or offering for sale of such textile fiber product, unless the same information as that required to be shown on the stamp, tag, label, or other identification under subsection (b)(1) and (2) of this section is contained in the heading, body, or other part of such written advertisement, except that the percentages of the fiber present in the textile fiber product need not be stated.\n\n(d) In addition to the information required in this section, the stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification, or advertisement may contain other information not violating the provisions of this subchapter.\n\n(e) For purposes of this subchapter, in addition to the textile fiber products contained therein, a package of textile fiber products intended for sale to the ultimate consumer shall be misbranded unless such package has affixed to it a stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification bearing the information required by subsection (b) of this section, with respect to such contained textile fiber products, or is transparent to the extent it allows for the clear reading of the stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification on the textile fiber product, or in the case of hosiery items, this section shall not be construed as requiring the affixing of a stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification to each hosiery product contained in a package if (1) such hosiery products are intended for sale to the ultimate consumer in such package, (2) such package has affixed to it a stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification bearing, with respect to the hosiery products contained therein, the information required by subsection (b) of this section, and (3) the information on the stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification affixed to such package is equally applicable with respect to each textile fiber product contained therein.\n\n(f) This section shall not be construed as requiring designation of the fiber content of any portion of fabric, when sold at retail, which is severed from bolts, pieces, or rolls of fabric labeled in accordance with the provisions of this section at the time of such sale: Provided, That if any portion of fabric severed from a bolt, piece, or roll of fabric is in any manner represented as containing percentages of natural or manufactured fibers, other than that which is set forth on the labeled bolt, piece, or roll, this section shall be applicable thereto, and the information required shall be separately set forth and segregated as required by this section.\n\n(g) For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be considered to be falsely

symbol of a fur-bearing animal is used, is a fur or fur product within the meaning of the Fur Products Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 69 et seq.): Provided, however, that where a textile fiber product contains the hair or fiber of a fur-bearing animal, the name of such animal, in conjunction with the word \"fiber\", \"hair\", or \"blend\", may be used.\n\n(h) For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be misbranded if it is used as stuffing in any upholstered product, mattress, or cushion after having been previously used as stuffing in any other upholstered product, mattress, or cushion, unless the upholstered product, mattress, or cushion containing such textile fiber product bears a stamp, tag, or label approved by the Commission indicating in words plainly legible that it contains reused stuffing.\n\n(i) For the purposes of this subchapter, a textile fiber product shall be considered to be falsely or deceptively advertised in any mail order catalog or mail order promotional material which is used in the direct sale or direct offering for sale of such textile fiber product, unless such textile fiber product description states in a clear and conspicuous manner that such textile fiber product is processed or manufactured in the United States of America, or imported, or both.\n\n(j) For purposes of this subchapter, any textile fiber product

seams or, if such product does not contain a neck, in the most conspicuous place on the inner side of such product, unless it is on or affixed on the outer side of such product, or in the case of hosiery items on the outer side of such product or package.\n\n(k)Marking of Certain Sock Products.—\n\n(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, socks provided for in subheading 6115.92.90,

Exclusion of misbra nded textile fiber products\n\nAll textile fiber products imported into the United States shall be stamped, tagged, labeled, or otherwise identified in accordance with the provisions of section 70b of this title, and all invoices of such products required pursuant to section 1484 of title 19, shall set forth, in addition to the matter therein specified, the information with respect to said products required under the provisions of section 70b(b) of this title, which information shall be in the invoices prior to their certification, if such certification is required pursuant to section 1484 of title 19. The falsification of, or failure to set forth the required information in such invoices, or the falsification or perjury of the consignee's declaration provided for in section 1485 of title 19, insofar as it relates to such information, is unlawful, and shall be an unfair method of competition, and an unfair and deceptive act or practice, in commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.); and any person who falsifies, or perjures the consignee's declaration insofar as it relates to such information, may thenceforth be prohibited by the Commission from importing, or participating in the importation of, any textile fiber product into the United States except upon filing bond with the Secretary of the Treasury in a sum double the value of said products and any duty thereon, conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of this subchapter. A verified statement from the manufacturer or producer of such products showing their fiber content as required under the provisions of this subchapter may be required under regulation prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n§ 70h. Guaranty\n\n(a) No person shall be guilty of an unlawful act under section 70a of this title if he establishes a guaranty received in good faith, signed by and containing the name and address of the person residing in the United States by whom the textile fiber product guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received, that said product is not misbranded or falsely invoiced under the provisions of this subchapter. Said guaranty shall be (1) a separate guaranty specifically designating the textile fiber product guaranteed, in which case it may be on the invoice or other paper relating to said product; or (2) a continuing guaranty given by seller to the buyer applicable to all textile fiber products sold to or to be sold to buyer by seller in a form as the Commission, by rules and regulations, may prescribe; or (3) a continuing guaranty filed with the Commission applicable to all textile fiber products handled by a guarantor in such form as the Commission by rules and regulations may prescribe.\n\n(b) The furnishing of a false guaranty, except where the person furnishing such false guaranty relies on a guaranty to the same effect received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person residing in the United States by whom the product guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received, is unlawful, and shall be an unfair method of competition, and an unfair and deceptive act or practice, in commerce, within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).\n\n§ 70i. Crim inal penalty\n\n(a) Any person who willfully does an act which by section 70a, 70c, 70d, 70g, or 70h(b) of this title is declared to be unlawful shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more than $5,000 or be imprisoned not more than one year, or both, in the discretion of the court: Provided, That nothing in this section shall limit any other provision of this subchapter.\n\n(b) Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any person is guilty of a misdemeanor under this section, it may certify all pertinent facts to the Attorney General. If, on the basis of the facts certified, the Attorney General concurs in such belief, it shall be his duty to cause appropriate proceedings to be brought for the enforcement of the provisions of this section against such person.\n\n§ 70j. Ex emptions\n\n(a) None of the provisions of this subchapter shall be construed to apply to -\n\n(1) upholstery stuffing, except as provided in section 70b(h) of this title;\n\n(2) outer coverings of furniture, mattresses, and box springs;\n\n(3) linings or interlinings incorporated primarily for structural purposes and not for warmth;\n\n(4) filling or padding incorporated primarily for structural purposes and not for warmth;\n\n(5) stiffenings, trimmings, facings, or interfacings;\n\n(6) backings of, and paddings or cushions to be used under, floor coverings;\n\n(7) sewing and handicraft threads;\n\n(8) bandages, surgical dressings, and other textile fiber products, the labeling of which is subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.);\n\n(9) waste materials not intended for use in a textile fiber product;\n\n(10) textile fiber products incorporated in shoes or overshoes or similar outer footwear;\n\n(11) textile fiber products incorporated in headwear, handbags, luggage, brushes, lampshades, or toys, catamenial devices, adhesive tapes and adhesive sheets, cleaning cloths impregnated with chemicals, or diapers. The exemption provided for any article by paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection shall not be applicable if any representation as to fiber content of such article is made in any advertisement, label, or other means of identification covered by section 70b of this title.\n\n(b) The Commission may exclude from the provisions of this subchapter other textile fiber products (1) which have an insignificant or inconsequential textile fiber content, or (2) with respect to which the disclosure of textile fiber content is not necessary for the protection of the ultimate consumer.\n\n§ 70k. Applicati on of other laws\n\nThe provisions of this subchapter shall be held to be in addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, the provisions of any other Act of the United States."
