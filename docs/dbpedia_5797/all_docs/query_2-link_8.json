        "text": "Solitary activity\n\nSelf-masturbation is self-stimulation with the intention of causing sexual arousal and, generally, orgasm (sexual climax). Most masturbation is done in private as an end in itself but is sometimes practiced to facilitate a sociosexual relationship.\n\nMasturbation, generally beginning at or before puberty, is very common, particularly among young males, but becomes less frequent or may even be abandoned when sociosexual activity is available. Research has shown, in fact, that the frequency of masturbation is lower among males in satisfying sexual relationships versus males who experience sexual dissatisfaction. This is in contrast to females, for whom masturbation tends to complement sociosexual relationships, remaining frequent among women who report highly satisfying sexual intercourse. In general, fewer females masturbate, compared with males; a study in Norway from 2022, for example, found that about 66 percent of women and 84 percent of men had masturbated in the past month. There is great individual variation in frequency, however, so that it is impractical to try to define what range could be considered “normal.”\n\nThe myth persists, despite scientific proof to the contrary, that masturbation is physically harmful. Neither is there evidence that masturbation is immature activity; it is common among adults deprived of sociosexual opportunities. While solitary masturbation does provide pleasure and relief from the tension of sexual excitement, it does not have the same psychological gratification that interaction with another person provides; thus, extremely few people prefer masturbation to sociosexual activity. The psychological significance of masturbation lies in how the individual regards it. For some, it is laden with guilt; for others, it is a release from tension with no emotional content; and for others it is simply another source of pleasure to be enjoyed for its own sake.\n\nThe majority of males and females have fantasies of some sociosexual activity while they masturbate. The fantasy not infrequently involves idealized sexual partners and activities that the individual has not experienced and even might avoid in real life.\n\nSince the masturbating person is in sole control of the areas that are stimulated, the degree of pressure, and the rapidity of movement, masturbation is often more effective in producing sexual arousal and orgasm than is sociosexual activity, during which the stimulation is determined to some degree by one’s partner.\n\nOrgasm in sleep evidently occurs only in humans. It is common especially among males, in whom it almost always begins and is most frequent in adolescence, tending to disappear later in life. Fewer females have orgasm in sleep, and, unlike males, they usually begin having such experience when fully adult. The causes of orgasm in sleep are not wholly known. The idea that it results from the pressure of accumulated semen is invalid because not only do nocturnal emissions sometimes occur in males on successive nights, but females experience orgasm in sleep as well. In some cases orgasm in sleep seems a compensatory phenomenon, occurring during times when the individual has been deprived of or abstains from other sexual activity. In other cases it may result from external stimuli, such as sleeping prone or having night clothing caught between one’s legs. Most orgasms during sleep are accompanied by erotic dreams."
