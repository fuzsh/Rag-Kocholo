        "text": "None of this stops pan dead-enders from pushing misconceptions about bisexuality being exclusionary and bigoted. In activist spaces, it’s depressingly common to see bi portrayed as “pan minus trans” or “pan but clueless about Systemic Oppression.” Of course, this is the same crowd who will say things like “I’m attracted to all genders except for cis men” — in other words, “bi plus misandry.” Pan folks, we are told, don't discriminate against genitals (neither do bi people). We are told that pan is inclusive of trans people (so is bi). And no matter how many times bi folks explain that bisexuality does not exclude trans people, this radical fringe just plugs their ears. Equally frustrating is that in non-LGBT-specific spaces, well-meaning normies have no earthly clue what these pansplainers are even saying, but will accept what they hear at face value and then go on to spread misinformation about bisexual folks supposedly being transphobic.\n\nSome people seem to need a refresher on the difference between sex and gender. Gender is a social construct. There’s no limit to how many genders there could potentially be. Sex, by contrast, is simple (and yes, sometimes complex) biology. There are only two sexes, and all humans fit into one or the other category. (And no, intersex is not a third sex. Differences in sexual development don’t result in entirely discrete sexes with new functions, let alone ones that continue from generation to generation.) So, bisexuality, far from denigrating or excluding gender or trans people, sidesteps the matter altogether by focusing on what we can most clearly measure — sex — which covers all people. If you are able to be attracted to both sexes, that includes whatever self-conception of gender the members of those two sexes might hold in their heads.\n\nBi was never trans-exclusive, which is why this perception of a Thunderdome-style deathmatch between bi and pan is a lot like a puppy barking at its own reflection. This illusion of a divide over labels within the bi community, and its underlying confusion, are symptoms of a larger phenomenon I lived through as a teenager: the Tumblrification of LGBT politics.\n\nMy public school education covered little in the way of sexual orientation, gender, and sex ed — a far too common experience in the US. So my sex ed and LGBT education came instead from Tumblr, where my emo friends and I spent enormous amounts of time. For us, and many other young people in alternative subcultures, Tumblr was our virtual playground — where self-exploration, sexuality, teenage humor, and adolescent angst converged in an endless scroll of simulated belonging. It was a place where kids got what they mistook for clarity, community, and acceptance, and we jumped headlong into whatever trend we were being fed without scrutiny or question.\n\nWe learned about LGBTQQPIAA2S+ and spent countless hours looking through the never-ending list of fabricated labels that blended Latin root words with “-sexual.” The Internet would hand us these terms that seemed to describe exactly how we felt and made us feel seen. We would cling to these labels like a kind of existential certificate to prove that we were real. What’s more, we quickly picked up on the sort of prestige these online spaces bestowed upon anyone attaching a sexual identity label to themselves. Nobody wanted to be perceived as normal, plain, or a member of the sheep-like majority group.\n\nIt started with labels like “sapiosexual” (attraction to intelligent people) and “demisexual” (attraction to people only after one has developed an emotional bond). Some others included “akoisexual” (sexual attraction to people but without the desire for those feelings to be reciprocated), “pomosexual” (a label for people who don’t like sexual labels), and “allosexual” (having any sexual attractions at all!). Like so many made-up Tumblr identities, these aren’t actual sexual orientations, but rather sexual preferences or attachment styles (and fairly common ones, at that) dressed up in the language of sexuality to make people look and feel unique and interesting. Amid this blizzard of labels, however, one was verboten. Breathe a word about bisexuality, and all hell broke loose.\n\nThe sin of bringing up bisexuality was met with swift and venomous retribution from the champions of Tolerance and Acceptance. If someone said they were bi, they could expect to be quickly dogpiled by Tumblrinas telling them how “problematic” and transphobic they were being. They were told they were “obsessed with genitals” and provided a list of superior identity labels to choose from that were “less oppressive” or “more correct.” Some came and went, such as “multisexual”, “omnisexual”, and “polysexual.” But “pansexual” emerged from the bunch and stuck around as the kid-tested Tumblr-approved replacement for bisexual, along with the confused mantra of “hearts, not parts.”\n\nWhen you take a bunch of young people with queer inclinations, left-wing values, and little to no sex education, and present them with a particular label, idea, or identity as being “affirming” and “inclusive”, getting them to jump on the bandwagon is child’s play. With that in mind, it’s not surprising that pansexual took off on Tumblr and among the too-online activist left. It never made the jump across the online-IRL barrier for the same reason “Latinx” faltered: it makes no sense, we already have perfectly good words, and everyday people find it weird. Out here in the land of grass, hardly anyone identifies as pansexual (0.1% of US adults). But in the realm of 1’s and 0’s, the Tumblrinas have fabricated the illusion of controversy. It only takes a relatively small number of people to make a mess of things, however, especially if they’re loud and coordinated.\n\nNeedlessly overcomplicating the concept of sexual orientation with far-left identity politics does not help the LGBT community. Not only does it inaccurately ascribe a uniformity of political views to LGBT people where a diversity of opinion exists, but it alienates the wider society by creating partisan associations that encourage everyone outside of the hard left to see us as adversaries. Nothing broadcasts “leftist infighting” like communities with so many screeching pedantic ideologues trying to one-up each other with ever-purer labels. What we end up with is alphabet soup and a meaningless litany of eye-roll-inducing fauxdentities.\n\nAs this recent Gallup poll shows us, however, the kids are alright. The online fringe remains online only. The LGBT community continues to grow, and bi folks are leading the way. Let’s leave Tumblr where it belongs, in 2014, and ignore this nontroversy over labels. Life is too short to waste time worrying about a small number of extremists too dogmatic to ever change their minds. Bi folks are taking over the world without them."
