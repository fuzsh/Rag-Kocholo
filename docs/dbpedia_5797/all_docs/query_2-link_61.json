        "text": "A CNN blog recently revisited the tantalizing myth that sex is a workout. It must be circulating pretty well right now on social media, as I have been asked by several people if this is true or not.\n\nThe article is referring to a 2013 publication from the New England Journal of Medicine entitled Myths, Presumptions, and Facts about Obesity, written by a prestigious group of experts.\n\nMyth #7 states \"A bout of sexual activity burns 100 to 300 kcal [calories] for each person involved.\"\n\nThe potential myth, which is highlighted by the CNN blog, is that \"having sex one time burns about as many calories as walking a mile.\"\n\nSo, let's get it on.\n\nCalories and 'METs'\n\nEnergy expenditure (calories \"burned\") during an activity is impacted by several factors, including:\n\nThe intensity (energy requirements) of the activity,\n\nThe time spent doing the activity, and\n\nThe body weight of the person doing the activity.\n\nThe metabolic equivalent or MET value of an activity allows us to figure out energy expended of any activity, for any person, for any length of time.\n\nA 1 MET activity requires the same amount of energy as sitting quietly. A 2 MET activity requires 2 times the energy of sitting quietly, 3 METs requires 3 times the energy, and so on.\n\nVery simply, you can take the body weight of a person (in kg) and multiply it by the MET value of the activity and get how many calories would be required and subsequently expended in doing that activity for one hour.\n\nMike weighs 200 lbs (91 kg), and wants to do a 3 MET activity (e.g. walking briskly at 2.5 mph).\n\n91 kg x 3 METs = 273 calories, if he did the activity for one hour (60 min).\n\nIf he only walked for 30 minutes, then he would expend half, 136.5 calories.\n\nWalking vs. Sex\n\nOkay, so let's see if it is possible to expend the same amount of energy walking for an hour as having sex. Let's use Mike again (200 lbs).\n\nThe Compendium of Physical Activities, has three different levels of sexual activity.\n\nSexual Activity\n\nMET\n\nCalories per Hour\n\nActive, Vigorous Effort 2.8 255 General, Moderate Effort 1.8 164 Passive, Light Effort, Kissing, Hugging 1.3 118\n\nWalking at 2.5 mph on a flat surface (3 METs) is the most commonly used walking estimation, as it meets minimum recommendations for moderate intensity activity (3-6 METs) = \"a workout\".\n\nSo, for Mike:\n\nWalking at 2.5 mph (3 METs) = 273 calories/hour\n\nActive, Vigorous Sex (2.8 METs) = 255 calories/hour\n\nClose, but walking wins out by 18 calories.\n\nHowever, if Mike could bump up the intensity during his sexual activity to get to 3 METs (from 2.8), then he would expend same 273 calories per hour.\n\nActually, a more recent study found that free-living sexual activity resulted in 6.0 METs for young adult men, and 5.6 METs for women.\n\nSo, what if Mike was young and vibrant like the participants in this study?\n\nWalking at 2.5 mph (3 METs) = 273 calories/hour\n\nSexual Activity (6 METs) = 546 calories/hour\n\nHe would expend DOUBLE the amount of calories expended in the hour! That would be equivalent to any other 6 MET activity, such as running at 4 mph. Sounds exhausting.\n\n\"What do you want to do, honey, go for an hour run or ...?\"\n\n6-Minute Sex\n\nSo, 60-minutes of sexual activity can be a workout, and can even expend as many calories or more than walking for an hour. In this case, the myth is BUSTED.\n\nHowever, the CNN article and associated NEJM publication claim it is myth, because of estimates that the average sexual encounter only lasts around 6 minutes.\n\nClearly, 6 minutes of an activity is not going to match up to 60 minutes of another at a similar intensity. But, the study that concluded that sex lasted only 6 minutes was from 1984, and it was one study.\n\nHowever, the more recent 2013 research study found the average sexual activity encounter between couples was 25 minutes.\n\nThe instructions, \"In the present study, sexual activity was defined as the onset of foreplay, intercourse and at least one orgasm by either the man or woman, and ended at the coupleâ€™s discretion. During a one month period, couples were instructed to perform one sexual activity per week in their homes.\"\n\nSo, what if Mike, like some of these participants, got 30 minutes of sexual activity instead of 6 minutes?\n\nWalking at 2.5 mph (3 METs) = 273 calories/hour\n\nSexual Activity (6 METs) = 546 calories/hour OR 273 calories/30-minutes\n\nIn this case, it is possible for Mike to have a sexual encounter that averages 6 METs and lasts for 30 minutes, which would be equivalent to him walking at 2.5 mph for one hour (273 calories).\n\nThe authors conclude, \"The present study indicates that energy expenditure during sexual activity appears to be approximately 85 kcal or 3.6 kcal/min, and seems to be performed at a moderate intensity in young healthy men and women. These results suggest that sexual activity may potentially be considered, at times, as a significant exercise.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nI said this one is CLARIFY, because you can 'foreplay' with the numbers to conclude that sex as a \"workout\" is either a MYTH or BUSTED. The key is determining the intensity of the sexual activity, how long it is performed, and how much the person weighs.\n\nI normally recommend couples to count sexual activity towards their weekly physical activity, to help reach the 150 minutes per week.\n\nI recommend that they enjoy both, walking and sex (not at the same time).\n\nCaution!"
