        "text": "Hello!\n\nI'm at a point in my life where I've stumbled across this forum and so many things I'm reading about resonate with me. I want to figure out my identity so I can explain it to future partners, and for more clarity for myself. Maybe you can help?\n\nI've had fulfilling sexual relationships of all genders in my life. However after my last relationship, it's like a switch has turned off. The whole time in that relationship I was grossed out by kissing, and I'm realizing I've never liked kissing on the lips (in my whole life). He would always french kiss me and it felt like a slug in my mouth. Sex was also boring in that relationship and I didn't feel much emotionally during sex, but I did get turned on at times. After some reflection, several relationships in my past ended because \"I wasn't sexual enough\" or they fell in love with someone else and wanted to have sex with someone else. I'm wondering if my life would be so much easier if I just took sex out of the equation when it comes to relationships.\n\nI love physical touch, cuddling, hugs, and things like that. I really hate oral sex, and am grossed out by all bodily fluids. So, what term would this be? Since I have enjoyed sex before I feel like I don't fit the asexual label. However now I just want to cuddle and be romantic and experience love...just no kissing or sex of any kind. I would like to be in a relationship where I am sensual, emotionally connected, even love them. Just don't have to do anything sexual.\n\nI'm scared it will be reaaaaaaally hard to date and find people that are OK with me not wanting traditional sex. I've tried online dating, and even people I meet through hobbies are mostly interested in sleeping together. I really don't want to be alone, but I don't know if there is someone who would want to live with me/share a life without sex.\n\nAnother thing is that I have been monogamous my whole life. Now, I think that if I am not sexual that I could have multiple partners that are emotionally and sensually intimate. Not sure if I would get jealous, or if I would be happy being in several fulfilling relationships. Something tells me I just to need to try it out and see how I feel. Deep down sometimes I wish I could connect with a single person that is asexual, though. It's very confusing.\n\nAlso I think, is this a phase? I've been sexual my whole life and maybe I'm just struggling with my breakup and hating cishet men...and when I meet the right person I'll feel like I want to connect sexually. So I am hesitant to identify as grey, or demi, or ace at this point.\n\nAny advice?\n\nI wish that I could say that it is going to be easy, I am the same in some aspects being that I find oral and anal to be completely disgusting and would never have anything to do with them and I don't like kissing with tongue. I don't mind like a quick peck though. I have not had good luck finding a partner either, I have been on dating sites and am always ghosted when I tell them no sex. I find that so many people just want a hook up more than anything else. I have not been on a date in about 15 years though which was long before I discovered my asexuality. I was never very interested in it to begin with and would never initiate. I do hope that you are able to find what you are looking for in a partner.\n\n@DuckDuckGrace It's a little hard to say if you think your feelings around sexuality could come up, but is it a kind of intimacy you feel is important to you in a relationship with someone you love?\n\nI think graysexual could probably make sense, since you might've felt some sexual feelings from what you said but not enough to really be a sexual person.\n\nI'm gray-ace myself and I feel either being with someone on the ace spectrum or who at the very least doesn't 'need' sex would be the easiest way to go.. though obviously it's a bit harder to find. I'm more monogamous too, I'm not sure if i really wanna try an open relationship, though I'm not opposed to trying if it would come to it I guess. .\n\nwonder if your username was intentional (gray-ace = grace).\n\nHa ha, yeah I chose my username since with what research I have done, grey-sexual seems like a good starting point as a label until I learn more. Hence, DuckDuckGoose was already taken so I chose DuckDuckGrace and I'm happy to see you picked up on it! 🥰 Can you explain what grey-sexual is compared to demi? I feel both may apply.\n\nAs to your question of whether sex is a form of intimacy that is important in someone I love, no I don't feel it is important. It's nice when it happens and I enjoy it. A major difficulty I have wrapping my head around all of this is that looking BACK on my relationships I see full sexual and fun relationships, and also relationships where I just refused to have sex and was happy not doing anything sexual. It's like, as I get older I'm more and more interested in just cuddly/hand-holding kinds of affection. 💘\n\nOne of the best ways I can describe how I feel is that I feel the total opposite of a swinger. I just don't understand how people can have fun sex with strangers. Grosses me out, seems selfish, and I don't want anything to do with it. Never wanted a FWB or one-night stand.\n\nI know what you mean about being monogamous, that's how I have always been. I think I'm just wondering if that is possible in a gray-sexual or asexual relationship. 🤷‍♀️ I'm so used to sex being something everyone wants, and society makes me feel I need to be all sexy all the time for my partner, or wear makeup to look attractive. It's just everywhere. So I feel that my other half just isn't out there so I should not take things so seriously and have multiple non-sexual \"relationships,\" for lack of a better word.\n\n26 minutes ago, DuckDuckGrace said:\n\nHa ha, yeah I chose my username since with what research I have done, grey-sexual seems like a good starting point as a label until I learn more.

It's like being/feeling asexual until a connection can change how someone feels, to be sexual. Graysexual is a broad label but it's usual definition has to do with feeling close to asexual but not quite, as in weak or rare sexual feelings/attraction/desire. (not counting libido which can cause arousal but not necessarily desire for partnered sex)\n\nYou're right though someone can be or feel like both in some ways, since people wont always fall neatly in one spot.\n\nI guess I had a similar experience in that I felt more sexual in the past when I was younger but then it just didn't pan out like I had in mind and over time I just realized sex wasn't important to me and just .. physical pleasure, and I can lose interest in it easily enough, especially now with my low libido. I'm all for cuddling though, touch is my main love language (but it doesn't translate to sex).\n\nI guess we are different though in one sense since I'd be fine having sex without emotional attachment, though I'd still need to feel safe with someone, but for me sex just doesn't connect to intimacy. But I guess I don't see how it would be selfish if me and someone else is doing it just for fun. But I'm not seeking out sex so it'd be really just if I felt like having the experience if the chance was there, I guess :P.\n\n33 minutes ago, DuckDuckGrace said:\n\nI know what you mean about being monogamous, that's how I have always been. I think I'm just wondering if that is possible in a gray-sexual or asexual relationship.\n\nWell of course. And I understand culture doesn't talk a lot about asexuality and sex is normal, but even there it would depend 'how' sexual the partner is or if sex is important to them. But being in a monogamous romantic (non-sexual) relationship is what would be normal for me, and I don't want to settle for someone sexual at this point, unless I know it'd work out. I've experienced enough to know more what I want, doesn't matter if it's harder to find someone. I've been in a long-distance asexual relationship and I can see it totally working out but it is harder to find someone nearby.\n\nYou're free to look for poly relationships if you think that would work better for you. I think it's not the most common either though, but find what makes sense to you. At this point I'm ok even if I'm single for long periods so even though i'd be open to try it, I prefer finding one person to share closeness with"
