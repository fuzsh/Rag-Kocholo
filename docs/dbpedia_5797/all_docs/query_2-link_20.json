        "text": "Being “sexually active” can include penetrative sex, as well as genital-to-genital contact, manual stimulation, and more.\n\nWhether it was your doctor, your parents, or your friends, you’ve likely heard someone talk about being “sexually active.”\n\nIf you’re confused by this term, don’t worry. You aren’t the only one!\n\nAlthough this term is often associated with penis-in-vagina (PIV) penetrative sex, it’s actually way broader than that.\n\nIt also includes different forms of manual stimulation, like fingering or handjobs, dry humping or other genital-to-genital contact, rimming or other types of oral sex, and anal penetration.\n\nIn other words, while you might not have had some form of penetrative sex, you could very well be sexually active in the eyes of your doctor.\n\nNot technically.\n\nAlthough masturbation can be considered a sexual act, it usually doesn’t involve skin-to-skin contact with another person.\n\nAnd if you aren’t getting physical with someone else, you don’t have to be concerned with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or other transmittable conditions.\n\nCertain sexual activities put you at risk for STIs — and pregnancy, in some cases — so there’s a lot to consider before becoming sexually active.\n\nThere are several questions you can ask yourself to help make this decision, such as:\n\nAm I doing this because I want to, or is it because I feel like I need to in order to fit in or make my partner happy?\n\nDo I want to be in a committed relationship first, or am I comfortable with having an uncommitted sexual partner?\n\nDo I have access to condoms and contraceptives?\n\nCould I have any regrets afterward?\n\nYou may find it helpful to talk it over with a close friend or mentor.\n\nIf they’re already sexually active, they may be able to share how they realized they were ready, questions they had for their partners, or other tips.\n\nRemember that the decision is ultimately up to you. It all comes down to how you feel and what you’re comfortable with.\n\nProbably not.\n\nIf you have a vagina, you may have heard about “breaking your hymen” and how this is a telltale sign of sexual activity. This is a myth.\n\nSome people are born with hymens (a loose piece of tissue around the vaginal opening), some are born with partial hymens, and some are born without hymens.\n\nAlthough the hymen can be torn during sexual activity (which is where the myth comes from), it can also tear as a result of exercise or other physical activities.\n\nThere’s no way to determine what exactly caused the hymen to tear.\n\nThe only way that a doctor could tell that you’re sexually active is if you have a pelvic or rectal exam scheduled and have recently had a partner ejaculate inside of you during vaginal or anal sex.\n\nSemen can live inside the body for up to 5 days, so your doctor may see this during your exam.\n\nSharing intimate details about your sex life can be difficult, especially if you’re worried about being judged or concerned about confidentiality.\n\nBut there are several reasons why it’s important to keep your healthcare provider in the loop.\n\nVaccinations\n\nIt’s important to make sure you’re up to date with any necessary vaccines.\n\nFor example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone get the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine before becoming sexually active.\n\nThis vaccine helps protect against some cancers and most genital warts.\n\nYou can still get the HPV vaccine if you’re already sexually active, but it’s more effective when done before potential exposure.\n\nYour doctor may also recommend hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations.\n\nSTIs\n\nYour doctor will be able to discuss your individual risk for different STIs.\n\nAlthough many people associate STI risk with penetrative sex, most can be transmitted through any type of contact with bodily fluids.\n\nOthers, like the herpes simplex virus, are transmitted through skin-to-skin contact.\n\nYour doctor can explain how you can reduce your risk with condoms and other barrier methods.\n\nIf you’re already sexually active, they may recommend testing for STIs while you’re there. This is usually done by taking a blood or urine sample.\n\nContraceptives\n\nIf you or your partner want to avoid pregnancy, talk to your doctor about your options for contraception.\n\nDepending on your needs, they may prescribe one of the following:\n\nan insertable diaphragm\n\na daily pill\n\na monthly skin patch\n\na monthly vaginal ring\n\na three-month injection\n\na long-term arm implant or intrauterine device\n\nThey can also tell you about your over-the-counter options, including:\n\ninside condoms (inserted into the vagina)\n\noutside condoms (worn on the penis)\n\na vaginal sponge\n\nspermicide\n\nPelvic exams and pap smears\n\nIf you aren’t already getting an annual pelvic exam, your doctor may recommend that you start.\n\nYou may find it helpful to think of a pelvic exam as a check-up for your reproductive organs and genitalia.\n\nDuring the exam, your doctor will visually and physically inspect different areas of your pelvic region to look for irritation, sores, or other symptoms that may indicate an underlying condition.\n\nIf you have a vagina, they’ll also use a speculum to get a closer look at your uterus, cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.\n\nYour doctor may also suggest getting routine pap smears to screen for cervical cancer. A pap smear is performed during the internal pelvic exam.\n\nAny sexual activity puts you at risk for STIs, even if it was a one-time thing.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that some infections, like HPV and chlamydia, don’t cause visible symptoms.\n\nThe only way to know whether you were exposed is to get tested.\n\nYou may not be “active” right now, but your past encounters still have an effect on your overall health.\n\nSome conditions, like genital herpes, can lay dormant for months or even years after you were initially exposed before making their presence known.\n\nOthers might not ever show symptoms and — if left untreated — may lead to infertility and other long-term complications.\n\nTelling your doctor the truth about your sexual history is crucial. This includes:\n\nthe number of partners you’ve had\n\nthe specific activities you’ve engaged in, such as oral sex\n\nhow consistently you’ve used condoms or other barrier methods\n\nwhether you’ve experienced pelvic pain, bleeding, or other unusual symptoms\n\nThis information allows your doctor to provide the most complete care possible.\n\nIf they don’t know that you’re sexually active — or what that entails for you — they won’t necessarily screen for the following underlying conditions or provide you with the resources you need to help reduce your risk.\n\nHPV\n\nAs many as 79 million Americans have at least one type of HPV.\n\nHPV refers to a group of viruses. More than 100 types of HPV exist, and at least 40 are spread through sexual contact.\n\nCertain types of HPV are asymptomatic and will eventually clear on their own. Others may lead to genital, anal, or oral warts, as well as certain cancers.\n\nRegular pap smears are the only way to screen for HPV and detect other abnormal cells.\n\nOther STIs\n\nThe CDC estimates that, in the United States alone, more than 20 million new infections occur every year.\n\nMany STIs are asymptomatic. This means they don’t present any symptoms, so you could have an infection without knowing it. That’s why STI screenings are so important.\n\nWhen symptoms are present, they may include:\n\nrash\n\nblisters\n\nitching\n\nunusual discharge\n\nburning during urination\n\npain during intercourse\n\nfever\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) occurs when sexually transmitted bacteria spreads from your vagina to your uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries.\n\nIt usually occurs a result of untreated chlamydia or gonorrhea.\n\nPID, like the infections that typically cause it, is often asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, they may include:\n\npain in your lower abdomen and pelvis\n\nunusual discharge\n\npainful or difficult urination\n\npain or bleeding during intercourse\n\nspotting between menstrual periods\n\nfever\n\nchills\n\nLeft untreated, PID can cause chronic pelvic pain and tubo-ovarian abscesses. It can also lead to infertility.\n\nHIV\n\nHIV is a virus that affects the immune system. It’s usually transmitted through genital or rectal fluids during sexual activity.\n\nSymptoms are more common within the first two to eight weeks of exposure. They may include:\n\nswollen glands\n\nfever\n\nheadaches\n\nmuscle soreness\n\nIf left untreated, HIV can increase your risk of certain cancers and other life-threatening complications.\n\nCertain cancers\n\nIf left untreated, hepatitis B and hepatitis C can result in liver cancer.\n\nHigh-risk strains of HPV can lead to the following cancers:\n\noral\n\ncervical\n\nvaginal\n\nvulvar\n\nanal\n\nHIV can also increase your risk of certain cancers, especially if it’s undetected or untreated. This includes:\n\nKaposi sarcoma\n\nlymphoma\n\ncervical\n\nanal\n\nIt depends. If you tell your doctor in private that you’re sexually active, they have a responsibility to protect your confidentiality.\n\nBut things can get a little more complicated when it comes to actually providing — rather than just discussing — different sexual health services.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Family Physicians, all jurisdictions in the United States allow doctors to diagnose and treat STIs in minors without parental consent.\n\nWhether minors require parental consent when requesting the following services varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction:\n\ncontraception\n\npregnancy tests\n\nabortion\n\nprenatal care\n\nchild delivery services\n\nIf you’re concerned about your confidentiality, ask your doctor about what they’re required to disclose before discussing your sexual health.\n\nIf your doctor isn’t able to provide the care you need without parental involvement, know that you do have other options for medical care.\n\nIf you’re uncomfortable going to your doctor — or if you don’t have access to a primary care doctor or gynecologist — you have a few alternatives.\n\nSome contraceptives are available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy. Your options here are all non-hormonal:\n\ncondoms (external and internal)\n\nspermicides (foams, suppositories, gels, creams, and films)\n\nsponges\n\nSeveral oral emergency contraceptives, such as Plan B, are also available without a prescription.\n\nThese can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to help reduce your risk of pregnancy.\n\nYou can also go to your local women’s health clinic or county health department to receive care at a reduced or no cost.\n\nThis includes:\n\nbirth control\n\nPap smears\n\nSTI testing\n\npregnancy testing\n\nDeciding when to become sexually active is up to you and only you.\n\nAnd although your sex life isn’t anyone else’s business, it’s important to be straight up with your doctor.\n\nThey can give you the information you need to make informed decisions about your sexual and reproductive health.\n\nWhether that means discussing what exactly is considered “sexual activity,” how to reduce your risk of STIs, or something else entirely depends on where you are in the moment.\n\nYour provider is there to support you in whatever way you need."
