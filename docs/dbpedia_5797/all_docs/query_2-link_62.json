        "text": "What is sexual dysfunction?\n\nSexual dysfunction is anything that prevents you from feeling pleasure from sexual activity. Being unable to enjoy or not wanting to engage in sexual activities may be a sign of sexual dysfunction. It’s very common and highly treatable. Things like stress, health conditions, medication or past sexual trauma can cause it.\n\nSexual dysfunction can happen at any point during the sexual response cycle. The sexual response cycle is a four-stage model of a person’s response to sexual stimulation. It includes:\n\nExcitement: This phase includes desiring sex and becoming aroused. It includes much of the sexual activity before intercourse such as foreplay, a penis becoming erect or a clitoris swelling.\n\nPlateau: This is the phase just before orgasm. Heart rate, muscle tension and breathing intensify. A penis may discharge pre-ejaculate (pre-cum).\n\nOrgasm: A sudden release of sexual tension and pleasure in your genitals. Ejaculation occurs during orgasm.\n\nResolution: The calming down period just after orgasm. Your body relaxes and your genitals return to their normal state.\n\nWhile research suggests that sexual dysfunction is common, many people don’t like talking about it. Because treatment options are available, though, you should share your concerns with your partner(s) and healthcare provider.\n\nWhat are examples of sexual dysfunction?\n\nHealthcare providers classify sexual dysfunction into four categories or types:\n\nDesire disorders: Lack of sexual desire or interest in sex. This may mean you have no interest in any type of sexual activity.\n\nArousal disorders: Inability to become physically aroused or excited during sexual activity. You may feel a desire for sex, but your body doesn’t respond. In people with a penis, this could mean you can’t get an erection.\n\nOrgasm disorders: Delay or absence of orgasm (climax). You may feel desire and arousal but be unable to orgasm.\n\nPain disorders: Pain during intercourse makes you not want to have sex.\n\nHow common is sexual dysfunction?\n\nSexual dysfunction can affect anyone at any age, although it’s more common in people over 40. Sexual dysfunction affects between 30% and 40% of people at some point in their lives.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of sexual dysfunction?\n\nSome types of sexual dysfunction affect men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB) more than women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). Conversely, some types of sexual dysfunction affect women and people AFAB more than men and people AMAB.\n\nIn people assigned male at birth:\n\nInability to achieve or maintain an erection (hard penis) for intercourse (erectile dysfunction).\n\nAbsent (anejaculation) or delayed ejaculation despite enough sexual stimulation.\n\nInability to control the timing of ejaculation (premature ejaculation).\n\nIn people assigned female at birth:\n\nInability to achieve orgasm (anorgasmia).\n\nVaginal dryness before and during intercourse. This could be due to vaginal atrophy.\n\nInability to relax your vaginal muscles enough to allow for intercourse (vaginismus).\n\nSexual dysfunction that affects anyone:\n\nLack of interest in or desire for sex (low libido).\n\nInability to become aroused.\n\nPain with intercourse (dyspareunia).\n\nCertain health conditions, treatments or medications.\n\nChanges in hormones such as low estrogen or low testosterone.\n\nWhat are the most common causes of sexual dysfunction?\n\nThere can be physical and psychological reasons for sexual dysfunction.\n\nPhysical causes of sexual dysfunction\n\nPhysical causes of sexual dysfunction could include:\n\nChronic conditions such as kidney or liver failure.\n\nDiabetes.\n\nHeart and vascular diseases.\n\nNeurological disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS) or nerve damage.\n\nHormonal imbalances.\n\nCancer.\n\nAlcohol use disorder and substance use disorder (SUD).\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding (chestfeeding).\n\nMenopause.\n\nAdditionally, the side effects of some medications, including antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual function.\n\nPsychological causes of sexual dysfunction\n\nYour emotions and feelings can also play a role in sexual dysfunction. These could include:\n\nStress or anxiety.\n\nMarital or relationship problems.\n\nDepression.\n\nPoor body image.\n\nHistory of sexual trauma or abuse.\n\nDepression or feelings of guilt.\n\nConcerns about your sexual performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat medications can cause sexual dysfunction?\n\nBoth over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications can have sexual side effects. Some medicines can affect your libido and others can affect your ability to become aroused or achieve orgasm.\n\nNonprescription medicines that cause sexual dysfunction\n\nSome over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants (common in treating colds or allergies) can cause erectile dysfunction or problems with ejaculation. These include medications like:\n\nCetirizine (Zyrtec®).\n\nLoratadine (Claritin®).\n\nDiphenhydramine (Benadryl®).\n\nAntidepressants that cause sexual dysfunction\n\nThe following medications may cause low libido, an inability to become aroused and difficulty reaching orgasm:\n\nTricyclic antidepressants, including amitriptyline (Elavil®, Vanatrip®), doxepin (Sinequan®), imipramine (Tofranil-PM®) and nortriptyline (Aventil®), Pamelor®).\n\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including phenelzine (Nardil®) and tranylcypromine (Parnate®).\n\nAntipsychotic medications, including thioridazine (Mellaril®), thiothixene (Navane®) and haloperidol (Haldol®).\n\nAnti-mania medications such as lithium carbonate (Eskalith®).\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac®), sertraline (Zoloft®), and paroxetine (Paxil®).\n\nAntihypertensive medications (medications that treat high blood pressure) that cause sexual dysfunction\n\nThe following medications for high blood pressure may cause erectile dysfunction:\n\nDiuretics.\n\nAlpha-blockers.\n\nBeta-blockers.\n\nWhat are the complications of sexual dysfunction?\n\nYour sexual health is an important part of your overall quality of life. Being dissatisfied with your sex life can leave you feeling lonely and frustrated. It can lead to intimacy problems with your sexual partner(s). It’s important to treat sexual dysfunction like you would any other health condition and seek treatment if it begins to bother you or cause problems in your daily life.\n\nHow is sexual dysfunction diagnosed?\n\nIn most cases, you recognize something’s interfering with your enjoyment (or a partner’s enjoyment) of a sexual relationship. Your provider usually begins with a complete history of symptoms and a physical. They may order diagnostic tests to rule out medical problems that can contribute to the dysfunction. Typically, lab testing plays a very limited role in the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction.\n\nAn evaluation of attitudes about sex, as well as other possible contributing factors — relationship concerns, anxiety, sexual history, medications, alcohol or drug abuse, and more — helps your provider understand the underlying cause of the problem and recommend the right treatment.\n\nCan I prevent sexual dysfunction?\n\nNo, you can’t prevent it. But you can take steps to reduce its impact on your life. The first step is to be aware of it and recognize when it’s time to seek help. It may feel frustrating and upsetting to accept help. But, in most cases, you did nothing to cause sexual dysfunction. Fortunately, most causes of sexual dysfunction are treatable.\n\nWhen should I see my healthcare provider?\n\nContact your healthcare provider if you experience sexual dysfunction for three months or longer. If it begins interfering with your relationships or causing you and/or your partner(s) distress, it’s time to seek help. Your provider will ask for your medical history and a complete list of any medications and supplements you’re taking to get to the root cause.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nSexual dysfunction is a challenging condition. Most causes of sexual dysfunction are treatable with counseling, education and improved communication between partners. Don’t be discouraged — talk to your healthcare provider about your sexual health and any problems you’re experiencing. They’re there to find the cause of the problem and help you enjoy a healthy and pleasurable sex life."
