        "text": "The question of when you can have sex after surgery is not straightforward. It depends on your overall health, your post-surgical healing progress, and the type of surgery.\n\nThe timeline for when you can have sex after surgery ranges from the same day to several months. A procedure under local anesthesia, for example, won't require a wait. Sex after open-heart surgery, on the other hand, won't be safe for several weeks or months.\n\nThis article discusses how long after surgery you should wait to have sex. It also provides questions to ask your healthcare provider to make sure you can safely have sex following a surgical procedure.\n\nOutpatient or Inpatient Surgery\n\nWhen you are scheduling your surgery, your healthcare provider will tell you whether your surgery can be done as an outpatient, like at a surgical center, or as an inpatient, in the operating room of a hospital.\n\nTypically speaking, outpatient (ambulatory) surgery tends to require less healing time. This means it may be safe to have sex within a couple of days or a week.\n\nOn the other hand, inpatient surgery tends to be more extensive than outpatient surgery. In this case, you may need to wait several weeks or months before returning to sexual activities, depending on the type of surgery.\n\nType of Surgery\n\nThe type of surgery will also affect when you can engage in sexual activities again.\n\nMinor Surgery\n\nMinor surgery that uses local anesthesia, like a small skin cancer removal, doesn't need to interfere with your sex life. As long as you are not in pain, you don't have to wait to have sex after minor surgery.\n\nEye Surgery\n\nSex can increase eye pressure, similar to strenuous exercise. Follow your ophthalmologist's guidance for when you can have sex after eye surgery.\n\nAfter cataract surgery, you should wait at least one week to have sex. For laser refractive surgery, like Lasik, you only need to wait two or three days.\n\nLaparoscopic Surgery\n\nLaparoscopic surgery involves smaller incisions compared to open surgery, so recovery and wound healing is usually faster, allowing you to get back to all activities, including sex, sooner.\n\nReproductive Surgeries\n\nSurgeries that affect the reproductive organs, such as a hysterectomy, prostate surgery, or any surgery directly involving the penis or vagina, may require four to six weeks of recovery before you are able to engage in sex.\n\nChildbirth can also delay the return to sexual intercourse, with or without a cesarean section.\n\nAfter a dilation and curettage (D&C) for a miscarriage, you need to wait at least two weeks to have sex.\n\nAbdominal Surgery\n\nSex after abdominal surgeries, such as gallbladder surgery, appendectomy (appendix removal), or tummy tuck, will depend on how long it takes for the incision to heal and the pain to subside.\n\nInitially, it will be important to avoid putting weight or pressure on the wound area.\n\nIn these cases, it is best to consult your surgeon or healthcare provider and ask specifically when it's safe to have sexual intercourse. Even if you feel embarrassed, it's better to ask than not know and be anxious about it.\n\nHeart Surgery\n\nAfter some major surgeries, such as open-heart surgery, you may feel fully recovered but are at risk when you exert yourself too much. If the sternum is well healed, guidelines recommend that sexual activity may be safely resumed six to eight weeks after surgery.\n\nHowever, sex and physical activity after heart surgery are not just dependent on the sternum healing but also on how the heart is recovering. Talk to your surgeon or healthcare provider to discuss any risk factors specific to you.\n\nQuestions to Ask Your Healthcare Provider\n\nBesides general questions about having sex, you may have more specific questions for your healthcare provider. Sample questions may include:\n\nDo I need to avoid putting pressure on a certain area, such as an incision wound?\n\nWill we need to take any special measures? Some surgeries, such as vaginal surgeries, may cause vaginal dryness and make a lubricant necessary. Other surgeries, such as prostate surgery, may make it difficult to get and keep an erection. It may require medication or an additional procedure.\n\nIs there any reason to avoid pregnancy? Does my surgery, medications I am currently taking, or my condition make contraception important?\n\nAre there other sexual activities we should try such as kissing, petting, or oral sex before progressing to intercourse?\n\nQuestions for You and Your Partner\n\nIn addition to resuming sex, you may have other questions regarding intimacy with your partner. For example, do you and your partner even feel like having sex? Do you and your partner have enough energy?\n\nIt's good to have an open, honest conversation with your partner about the importance of healing. This is best done before the surgery so they are prepared.\n\nUse Pain as Your Guide\n\nEven if you are approved for sex, be sure to use pain as your guide. In other words, if it's painful when you try to have intercourse, this is your body’s way of saying you are not ready and that you need to heal more first.\n\nBut in some cases, pain can be avoided with some minor adjustments. For example, a person who has had breast surgery may be particularly sensitive to bouncing movements. Thus, being in a position on top may cause too much movement and pain. But alternative positions may be pain-free.\n\nType of Sex Matters\n\nThe type of sex comes into play when your healthcare provider gives you the green light to have intercourse. Keep in mind vigorous, athletic sex is not the ideal way to ease back into your sex life after surgery, so start slowly.\n\nHere are some other options:\n\nIf you are a man who had abdominal surgery, you may want to try a position that keeps pressure off your stomach.\n\nIf you had colorectal surgery, you will want to wait before resuming anal sex until your surgeon says it is safe.\n\nIf you are a woman who just had a hip replacement, the pressure of being in a position on the bottom could be painful.\n\nThink ahead to try to minimize any pain or discomfort. Still, try to enjoy yourself. If you experience pain, stop and change positions or try something different.\n\nSummary\n\nIn general, it will take longer to return to an active sex life if your surgery was a major one. After a surgery such as open-heart surgery or a joint replacement, it will take longer before you're healed enough to have sex.\n\nMinor procedures typically allow you to return to normal activities much faster, sometimes within days or weeks. There are exceptions, so it's important to talk openly with your surgeon about when you can return to active sex life.\n\nOnce you do resume, let pain be your guide. If a particular activity or position hurts, stop or try something else."
