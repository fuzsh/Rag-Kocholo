        "text": "I've dated pretty much every configuration of gender imaginable. But when people ask, I wouldn't call myself bisexual (which is one of the only universally recognized defining boxes we currently have if you're not gay or straight). I wouldn't call myself anything because I don't think any of the boxes apply, not to mention they all come with baggage that isn't super appealing to me. Bisexuals are still largely seen — incorrectly — as people sitting in chairs in sexual identity waiting rooms until their names are called to go into the \"straight\" or \"gay\" offices; lesbians are seen as being attracted to women and women only, and never men, not even a little bit or else you don't count as a lesbian; and straight people are seen as people attracted to the opposite sex only, and if you're a girl and you so much as have a crush on a girl, you are gay, the end. Who the fuck is this system working for?\n\nThat said, as a non-straight person and LGBTQ advocate, I fully know the importance of LGBTQ visibility and the power of coming out. Every time I write something for this website that has anything to do with LGBTQ issues, it is almost impossible to find photos of publicly out lesbian celebrities (outside of the, like, five we have right now — Hi, Ellen and Portia and, like, two others!). There are slightly more out bisexual actresses, but if they're currently in relationships with men (like Anna Paquin or Angelina Jolie), most people see them as straight or \"not gay anymore,\" which is not a thing. (Former gayness is not a thing. I just wanted to say that one more time.)\n\nSo when Ellen Page said one of the reasons she wanted to come out was \"to help others have an easier and more hopeful time,\" I understood exactly what she meant. Coming out is so essential to LGBTQ people feeling better about themselves and knowing they're not alone, and it especially helps to have openly gay celebrities. For an LGBTQ kid to be able to say to a disapproving parent, \"But Ellen Page is gay and she's great!\" it could potentially mean the difference between them getting kicked out of their own home or not. I could not be prouder or happier for people who are out as one defining sexual orientation. But that also doesn't mean that everyone who falls outside the preset sexuality boxes should pick one anyway so they can feel like they're an official part of the LGBTQ community, or any community at all.\n\nBecause of all this, I've ended up thinking about my sexuality a lot. It seems so damn urgent, like if I don't pick a category today, gay or straight, right now, right this second, I guess I'm either straight by default or something is wrong with me because I can't decide. (The other option is identifying as queer, but many people still don't know what that means and assume it means \"bisexual,\" and some LGBT people think it sounds offensive since it's a reappropriated word, so that's a whole other issue.) If you're not 100 percent positive that you are 100 percent straight, some part of you is constantly wrestling with this pressing need to put yourself in a box. I've known self-identified lesbians who worry when they get crushes on guys sometimes and self-identified straight women who worry when they're attracted to women sometimes, and all of them feel like they need to know, once and for all, what they are. And that makes me deeply sad. Because I totally understand why they feel that way.\n\nThe world desperately wants us all to pick a side and tell them what it is. Personally, no one has ever told me to pick a label, but I can feel it in my gut that I need to, and oftentimes I see it reflected in other people. If I have a friend who only knows me to date one gender and I start dating someone of a different gender, I find myself playing the pronoun-dodging game. I start saying things like \"This person I have a crush on\" and how \"they are really great\" just so I can avoid people asking me to categorize it when all I want to do is be psyched because I like someone. Or there's the good friend of mine who identifies as straight, but will often say she's attracted to women but she's \"not gay\" and is \"definitely straight.\" I hear her say this and want to hug her and tell her it's OK to not pick a word and to be attracted to whoever she's attracted to, but I also know why she feels that's impossible.\n\nWhat if you fall outside all the boxes? What are you supposed to do then, other than wrestle with the feelings of otherness, the \"Oh shit, my sexual identity deadline is here and I don't have all my paperwork filled out yet?\" There really is something about being able to put yourself into one concise, well-marked, tidy section of society, hands dusted off on your pants. \"That's that, now I can move on with my day.\" But it's not that simple.\n\nCarrie Brownstein, who says she has dated men and women, but doesn't identify as bisexual, says she hates these categories and never thinks of her sexuality as an identifier. She identifies herself by the types of relationships she has (in her case, it's that she's \"pretty horrible at relationships and [hasn't] been in many long-term ones\") and I couldn't agree more. I have relationships with people. I know that may sound simplified, but I think a lot of people who don't fit into boxes feel that way. Gender is not a defining factor in the relationship. There is no \"guy\" and \"girl\" role. We are just two people who like each other.\n\nHere is what I know. It's possible to be a self-identified straight girl who also has feelings for her best female friend. It's possible to be a self-identified lesbian who thinks that guy over there is hot and one time she thought about him while she masturbated. It's possible to be a self-identified gay man who would totally, literally sleep with Jennifer Lawrence. You choose your labels. You choose who you show them to. You choose when they change, if they change. None of us are just one of anything. If I'm funny right now, I might be really sad in two hours. That doesn't change that I'm funny; it just means that at that moment, there's been a shift. I think many of us are much more sexually fluid than we think we are, we're just so scared of what that means and if we have to take action. And I'd just like to tell you that you don't.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWhy People Who Say \"Being a Lesbian Would Be So Much Easier\" Should Shut-Up Forever\n\n8 Signs Your Girl Crush Is More Than a Crush"
