        "text": "Abrosexuality is having different levels of sexual or romantic attractions throughout your life. A person who is abrosexual may also have changes in their sexual orientation over time. For example, a person who is abrosexual might be sexually attracted to men at one point, then not sexually attracted to anyone weeks later. Â Someone who is abrosexual may have periods of different intensities of attraction.\n\nThe Greek root abro means âdelicateâ or âgraceful,â and symbolizes the movement and changing nature of people who are abrosexual.\n\nAbrosexual is one of more than 100 terms used to label different sexualities. It falls under the multisexuality umbrella, which includes people of all identities who are romantically or sexually attracted to more than one gender.\n\nPeople who are abrosexual freely choose different romantic and sexual partners, or no partners at all. If you are abrosexual, you might choose to tell others close to you, someone you are interested in, or no one at all.\n\nThe word âabroromanticâ has the same Greek root as âabrosexual,â suggesting fluidity in attractions, but these terms are different in that one refers to romantic attraction and the other to sexual attraction.\n\nA person who is abroromantic may want to have a romantic relationship but not necessarily want to have sex. A person who is abrosexual may want to have sex but not necessarily want a romantic relationship. However, sometimes the two terms are used interchangeably.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Abrosexuality, Pansexuality, and Asexuality?\n\nPansexuality is the sexual and romantic attraction to all people regardless of gender identity and sexual orientation. Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction to any person.\n\nAbrosexuality vs. Pansexuality\n\nAbrosexuality is different from pansexuality because of its changing nature. A person who is abrosexual may, at times, be pansexual, but at other times they may be heterosexual or asexual. Their sexual orientation is in flux. People who are pansexual are attracted to all people no matter their gender or sexuality.\n\nAbrosexuality vs. Asexuality\n\nWhile abrosexuality is characterized by its fluidity, asexuality is unchanging. A person who identifies as asexual doesnât feel sexual attraction at any time. A person who is abrosexual may have asexuality from time to time.\n\nHelping Your Loved Ones Understand Abrosexuality\n\nIf you want to come out as abrosexual to your loved ones, it may be easier if you prepare. You could write a script. Think about what you want to say and how you may want to begin.\n\nKeep in mind, youâve probably thought about this longer than your loved ones. They may need time to understand. Give them that.\n\nYou can find support networks and resources through:\n\nHuman Rights Council\n\nGLAAD\n\nThe Trevor Project"
