        "text": "Sexual exercise, or sexercise, refers to exercises that aim to improve sexual performance and function. As such, sexercise may make sex more satisfying for a person and their partner or partners.\n\nCelebrity trainer Jason Rosell coined the term sexercise, using it for a specific set of practices to improve a person’s sexual experience.\n\nPhysical fitness can affect sexuality by making sex easier and more comfortable, reducing the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) and arousal issues, and helping people feel more confident in their bodies.\n\nExercise may also reduce the risk of chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, that can cause sexual issues.\n\nA person may use the term sexercise to refer to a wide range of activities, while any exercise specifically to improve sex counts as sexercise.\n\nHealthful, consensual sexual activity of all varieties can improve health.\n\nSome benefits of sex include:\n\nBetter heart health: Sex involves exercise, which can improve heart health by lowering blood pressure and decreasing the risk of heart disease. A 2020 study found that, following a heart attack, people who had sex more than once per week had a 27% reduction in their risk of dying.\n\nA healthier immune system: Regular sex may boost immunity, reducing a person’s risk of acquiring infections and certain illnesses.\n\nBetter emotional health: Sex – and the exercise that sex involves – may reduce the risk of depression and anxiety.\n\nBetter self-esteem: People who have satisfying sex may feel good about themselves.\n\nHealthy relationships: A strong, healthy sexual connection with a partner may improve the relationship.\n\nBetter sleep: Sex may help some people fall asleep faster.\n\nStress management: Sex can be a suitable self-care tool that helps relieve stress.\n\nIt is important to note that sex in itself does not necessarily improve health.\n\nNon-consensual, painful, or unpleasant sex may cause severe emotional distress, physical injuries, and other health issues.\n\nExercise can improve sexual performance in many ways:\n\nReducing ED: In people with penises, regular exercise – especially aerobic exercise such as running or walking – may reduce ED. A 2017 meta-analysis found moderate to high-intensity aerobic exercise provided optimal benefits.\n\nCounteracting side effects of certain antidepressants on the libido: A 2013 study of females taking antidepressants found that exercising right before sex improved both arousal and global sexual function.\n\nExercise may reduce the risk of chronic medical conditions: These conditions can interfere with sexual performance. For example, diabetes has links with ED, arousal disorders, and some other sexual issues.\n\nImproving sexual function: Certain exercises may strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which a person uses during sex. Kegel exercises can help a person orgasm more easily and help with urine leakage and incontinence.\n\nIncreasing endurance and strength: This may make certain positions and types of sex easier. More endurance may help a person be less tired during prolonged sex sessions.\n\nThree categories of exercise can help improve sexual performance:\n\nAerobic exercise\n\nAerobic exercise increases the heart rate. It can help a person maintain a moderate weight, improve blood pressure, boost overall physical fitness, and may help with ED and general sexual performance. Some exercises to try include:\n\nSwimming: Offers an intense but low-impact workout for people with joint or muscle pain.\n\nWalking: An ideal starting exercise for people who struggle with more intense workouts.\n\nIntense aerobic exercise: Includes running or jogging, jumping rope, skiing, and using a stair-climber machine.\n\nPelvic floor exercises\n\nPelvic floor exercises strengthen the pelvic floor – a group of muscles that support the bladder. These muscles also contract during an orgasm. Try the following to work them:\n\nPerforming Kegels:\n\nLocate the right muscles when urinating.\n\nStop passing urine mid-flow for a few seconds, then start again.\n\nRepeat a few times daily.\n\nNext, try tensing and releasing the same muscles used to stop urinating several times per day.\n\nWork up to tensing the muscles for longer: 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or longer.\n\nExercising the multifidus of the pelvic floor:\n\nLie on the stomach, face down, with the forehead in the hands.\n\nLift the pelvis slightly back to point the tailbone toward the ceiling.\n\nHold for 5–10 seconds, working up to three sets of 10 repetitions.\n\nPerforming squats: Squats help strengthen the body, and in high repetitions, they can provide an intense cardio workout. They also help strengthen the abs and pelvic floor. Not everyone can do a squat at first. Try squatting down as much as possible without bending the back or taking the heels off the floor, then build up to deeper squats.\n\nStrength and flexibility training\n\nImproving general strength and flexibility may make certain sexual positions easier and more comfortable. Some options include:\n\nYoga and pilates: Both focus activities on improving flexibility and functional movement. People can even adapt some yoga positions into sex positions.\n\nLifting weights: Try lifting weights to improve the strength of various muscles and muscle groups. For example, a person who wants to lift their partner might try bench presses and other exercises that strengthen the upper body.\n\nBodyweight exercises: A person does not need weights to strengthen their muscles. Bodyweight exercises, such as leg raises, knee tucks, and squats strengthen the core, lower body, and pelvic floor. Pushups, pullups, and dips target the upper body, potentially making certain positions easier.\n\nEvery sex position may present an opportunity for exercise if it meets one of two conditions:\n\nThe speed and intensity of the sexual activity are intense enough to elevate the heart rate.\n\nThe activity is physically challenging. For example, it requires stretching or involves a person lifting additional weight.\n\nSome examples of specific positions that might help sexual partners get a workout include:\n\nPositions that require a partner to fully or partially lift another: For example, a person who wraps their legs around a partner while the partner holds them in a standing position requires both partners to bear extra weight.\n\nPositions that increase physical intensity and encourage partners to move more: For example, if a person is up against the wall with their legs wrapped around their partner, and the other partner is holding them, the couple is both supporting weights. They may also have to move more to increase stimulation and adjust the position.\n\nPositions that encourage gentle stretching: It is important not to force the body into an uncomfortable position. However, extending the legs over a partner’s shoulders or getting into yoga-like positions may increase the challenge of sexual activity.\n\nExercise is great for overall health, including sexual health.\n\nFor most people, exercise is a safe way to improve well-being and sexual performance.\n\nHowever, those who do not exercise should talk with a doctor before beginning a new fitness routine."
