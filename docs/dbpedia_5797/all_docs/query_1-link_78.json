        "text": "Heteroflexibility describes the sexual behavior of someone who identifies as straight but sometimes has sex with people of the same sex. Some research indicates that as much as 15% of the U.S. population identifies as heteroflexible.\n\nHeteroflexibility emerged as a term to describe people who identify as predominantly straight (and do not identify as gay, bisexual, pansexual, or another queer label) but sometimes have sex with people of the same gender. The term can be controversial, as some suggest that it contributes to bi-erasure and bi-invisibility. Others suggest that such claims minimize the identities of those who use the heteroflexible label.\n\nLGBTQ+ Orientations\n\nFrom the late 19th century to recently, American culture recognized only two possible sexual orientations: straight and gay/lesbian. This also held true for the man/woman gender binary, aside from the idea of Two Spirits from Indigenous and other cultures where gender fluidity was more accepted.\n\nVisibility and representation of bisexuality, pansexuality, and other queer orientations have expanded the range of sexual orientation identities acknowledged in \"mainstream\" American culture.\n\nHowever, our society still expects people to be heterosexual as the defaultâ€”a phenomenon known as heteronormativity.\n\nThe term heteroflexible has recently emerged to describe people who have same-sex desires but still identify as primarily heterosexual.\n\nHeteroflexibility vs. Bisexuality\n\nHeteroflexibility is a subcategory of bisexuality. If you're heteroflexible, you're primarily straight but are open to sex with people of the same sex. If you're bisexual, you're attracted to both men and women.\n\nThe History of Heteroflexibility\n\nTo understand what this label means, it might be helpful to understand its history.Sexual orientation categories appeared in the late 19th century, with the invention of the words \"homosexuality\" and \"heterosexuality.\" Before the invention of these words, gay and lesbian \"acts\" were outlawed, but there was no one widely-accepted word for identifying as a person who had sex with people of the same gender.\n\nIn his famous book \"Gay New York,\" historian George Chauncey described how New York men in the early 20th century could have sexual relationships with other men without losing their identity as \"men\" (which at the time, was synonymous with heterosexual).\n\nAs long as a man dressed and acted in masculine ways and was the penetrating partner, it was acceptable to have intercourse with other men. Men who acted in feminine ways and were the receiving partner were called \"fairies\" rather than gay. It was all about gender performance, rather than attraction.\n\nAs the 20th century moved on, however, ideas of heterosexuality and homosexuality took hold as identities.\n\nThese categories have been more or less flexible throughout the last hundred years. The 1960s and 70s were looser in terms of sexual experimentation and identity, while the 80s and 90s saw a return of clear, rigid boundaries around the actions that were acceptable from heterosexuals and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nHeteroflexibility Today\n\nIn the past few years, social scientists have seen a return to flexible notions of what it means to be heterosexual. Research from 2018 by social scientists Carillo and Hoffman suggests that men who have an occasional attraction to and/or sex with other men are able to expand the category of \"heterosexuality\" to include their behavior.\n\nMostly, they do this in terms of denying their attraction to men and talking about sex with men as only for pleasure, when women are unavailable, or as a \"perversion.\"\n\nThis research concluded that instead of switching to a bisexual identity, these men change the definition of heterosexual to include occasional attraction or sexual acts with menâ€”something that sounds a lot like the early 20th century New Yorkers that Chauncey studied.\n\nHeteroflexibility as an Orientation\n\nHeteroflexibility as an orientation is akin to categories 1 and 2 on the Kinsey scale, with 0 being \"exclusively heterosexual\" and 6 being \"exclusively homosexual.\" However, because it involves attraction and/or acts with people of the same sex, some critics have argued that heteroflexible is just another word for bisexuality.\n\nThough research by Carillo and Hoffman highlights a key difference between bisexual and heteroflexibility for some people, which is that heteroflexible people sometimes claim that they are not usually attracted to people of the same gender. This raises interesting questions.\n\nHaving Sex Without Attraction\n\nMany people have sex with people they are not attracted to and have even enjoyed that sex. It could be for many reasons: They hired a sex worker, or they had sex with an available partner exclusively for their own pleasure, for example.\n\nThis means that heteroflexible men don't have to be attracted to men to be willing to have sex with them. But, in some cases, they could also be denying their attraction to avoid the label of gay, lesbian, or bisexual. It is difficult for scientists to separate the two, as that would require access to a person's most private thoughts.\n\nWhat Makes Someone Gay?\n\nSome people think that one instance of same-gender attraction or sex makes someone gay or a lesbian automatically. This is obviously not the case. Bisexual people have sex with people of the same gender without being gay. The boundaries between heterosexuality and LGBTQ+ are often subjective, leaving people lots of leeway in how they can identify.\n\nTherefore, one can choose to identify as predominantly heterosexual even after having sex with people of the same gender. This is why social scientists have created the following categories for talking about sexuality:\n\nSexual orientation identity (what you call yourself)\n\nSexual behavior (what you do)\n\nSexual attraction (who you are attracted to)\n\nThese three things can (and often do) show different patterns among individuals and throughout each person's life course.\n\nWhy Some Find the Term Controversial\n\nSome critics question whether people who have sex with others of the same sex can claim to be heterosexual.\n\nOne common criticism of the term heteroflexibility is that it perpetuates bi-erasure and bi-invisibility. Such criticism suggests that people are identifying as heteroflexible because they are uncomfortable being called bisexual or pansexual.\n\nSome suggest that the label of heteroflexibility can give people the comfort to explore same-sex attractions. This, however, can leave those who describe themselves as heteroflexible feeling that their identity is less valid and only a step in the journey toward embracing another queer label.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that a person may identify with any orientation they please; it's up to the individual to discern. In this light, heteroflexibility is just as genuine and significant as any other orientation.\n\nHow to Know If You Are Heteroflexible\n\nLike other terms that describe sexual identities, the meaning of heteroflexibility is subjective: It might mean something different to you than it does to another person. Generally, you might be heteroflexible if:\n\nYou're straight but have enjoyed being with someone of the same sex.\n\nYou prefer the opposite sex, but you've felt attracted to people of the same sex on a few occasions.\n\nYou know (or suspect) you're not 100% straight, but \"queer\" and \"bisexual\" don't seem to fit your orientation exactly.\n\nYou'd be with someone of the same sex only in certain situations.\n\nYou prefer the opposite sex, but you like to experiment with people of the same sex.\n\nYou're satisfied with your orientation but are curious.\n\nBeing with someone of the same sex is on your bucket list, but you're content with someone of the opposite sex.\n\nA Word From Verywell\n\nUltimately, \"heteroflexible\" is just one way to describe someone who does not identify as entirely heterosexual. Labels can be helpful in some ways. They may help people learn to embrace their own identity and find a community of support, for example.\n\nRecent polls suggest that the younger generation may be more comfortable not identifying by a rigid sexuality dichotomy; one recent survey found that among Americans between the ages of 13 and 20, only 48% identified themselves as exclusively heterosexual."
