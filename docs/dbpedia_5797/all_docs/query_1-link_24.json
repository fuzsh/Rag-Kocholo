        "text": "Agender\n\nA person who does not identify themselves as having a gender, or who may identify themselves as gender-neutral. Alternative terms include genderfree, ungendered, or genderblank.\n\nAndrogynosexual\n\nAndrogynosexual humans feel sexual, romantic and/or emotional attraction to humans with both masculine and feminine features.\n\nAndrogynous\n\nAndrogyny is a gender expression characterised by a combination of both masculine and feminine characteristics.\n\nAndrosexual\n\nAndrosexual humans are primarily sexually, romantically and/or aesthetically attracted to masculinity (though not necessarily to men). The term is usually used by genderqueer rather than by heterosexual or gay humans.\n\nAromantic\n\nAromantic humans do not experience traditional romantic attraction, although they may still experience sexual attraction.\n\nAsexual\n\nAsexual humans do not experience sexual attraction in a traditional sense. Unlike celibacy, which is a lifestyle choice, asexuality is an intrinsic part of a human's sexual identity. However there is much diversity among asexual humans in how they experience relationships, attraction and arousal; itâs common for asexual humans to still seek romantic and emotional connections.\n\nAutosexual\n\nAutosexual is a human who is sexually attracted to and aroused by their own body. But masturbation does not automatically make a human autosexual (just as having sex doesnât make a human sexual).\n\nBDSM\n\nA term that includes a wide range of erotic practices generally relating to control and/or pain. Activities can be broken down into categories of bondage and discipline, domination and submission, and sadism and masochism.\n\nBi-curious\n\nBicurious humans are interested in exploring whether or not they are attracted to humans of the same gender, as well as humans of another gender.\n\nBigender\n\nBigender humans have two distinct gender identities - for example they could identify as both male and female, or as two other gender identities. They may identify as both simultaneously, or move between the two.\n\nBisexual\n\nSometimes shortened to âbiâ, bisexual humans feel sexual, romantic and/or emotional attraction to humans of both the same gender, and of another gender. People may experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees over their lifetime.\n\nBondage\n\nThe practice of being physically and consensually restrained for sexual satisfaction; think being tied up, handcuffs, and more.\n\nCasual\n\nA physical (and/or emotional) relationship without the commitments and expectations of a more formal, traditionally monogamous relationship.\n\nCisgender\n\nSomeone whose gender identity aligns with the one they were assigned at birth.\n\nCouples\n\nTwo humans involved in a relationship that includes some form of commitment, and with the expectation of accommodating the boundaries of this commitment when playing with others.\n\nDates\n\nMeeting another human (or multiple humans) for an activity out of the bedroom, that may or may not lead to activity within the bedroom.\n\nDating\n\nSomeone who you spend time with romantically or prospectively. Often, this person is someone youâre just getting to know romantically, sexually, or both.\n\nDemiromantic\n\nDemiromantic humans need to establish a strong emotional or sexual connection with a partner before they feel a romantic connection to them.\n\nDemisexual\n\nSimilar to the concept of demiromantic, above, demisexuals are humans who do not experience sexual attraction to another person unless they have formed a strong emotional connection.\n\nDom\n\nAny person who takes the dominant role in a BDSM dynamic. The dom takes total (or partial) power over the person in the submissive role.\n\nDominant / dom\n\nA BDSM term for a human within a power dynamic who takes total, or partial, control over the human in the commands, while the submissive is the one who obeys. The dominant within the power dynamic takes total (or partial) power over the human in the submissive role.\n\nDomme\n\nA femme version of the person who takes the dominant role in a BDSM dynamic. The domme takes total (or partial) power over the person in the submissive role.\n\nEngaged\n\nA person who you have promised to wed, either culturally, legally or both.\n\nFFF\n\nA threesome where all humans involved identify as women.\n\nFFM\n\nA threesome between two humans who identify as female, and one who identifies as male.\n\nFWB\n\nFriends With Benefits. A casual relationship between two humans based on mutual respect, but without the expectation of commitment.\n\nForeplay\n\nA catch-all term for all the intimate and sexy activities that arenât the act of penetrative sex itself.\n\nFriend\n\nA person with whom you share mutual affection. This affection usually manifests itself outside sexual or romantic expression, but not always.\n\nFriend with Benefits\n\nA person with whom you share mutual affection and casual sexual interactions.\n\nFriendships\n\nAn emotional connection between two people that isnât defined by a sexual element.\n\nFun\n\nMutual enjoyment between two humans.\n\nGGG\n\nA term popularised by Dan Savage to define the qualities of an excellent sexual partner: good (in bed), giving (of time and pleasure), and game (for exploring and being open-minded).\n\nGay\n\nA colloquial term used to describe humans who feel sexual, romantic and/or emotional attraction to people of the same gender. For women, âlesbianâ would also apply and could be the preferred term.\n\nGender Nonconforming\n\nGender-nonconforming refers to humans whose gender expression does not match their socially prescribed gender identity. In other words, they are humans whose behavioural, cultural, or psychological presentation does not correspond with the traits typically associated with their gender.\n\nGender Questioning\n\nA human engaged in the process of figuring out how best to describe their gender identity.\n\nGenderfluid\n\nGenderfluid humans move between different gender identities at different times. They may move between one gender at a time, or identify as several different ones.\n\nGenderqueer\n\nA person who does not follow binary gender norms; a term similar to non-binary, but considered by some to be a more politically-charged identity, by âqueeringâ ideas of gender.\n\nGrayA\n\nGrayA (or Greysexual) refers to humans who very rarely experience sexual attraction.\n\nGroup\n\nSex between three or more consenting humans.\n\nGynesexual\n\nGynesexual humans are primarily sexually, romantically and/or aesthetically attracted to femininity (though not necessarily to women).\n\nHeteroflexible\n\nHeteroflexible humans are primarily sexually and/or romantically attracted to genders other than their own, but are also open to having sexual and/or romantic interactions with humans of the same gender. The term often refers to humans who are predominantly heterosexual, but are sometimes sexually attracted to (or curious about exploring with) members of the same sex.\n\nHeterosexual\n\nHeterosexual humans feel sexual, romantic and/or emotional attraction to a person of the opposite (binary) gender, i.e. women attracted to men, or men to women.\n\nHomoflexible\n\nAs with heteroflexible, homoflexible humans are primary attracted to humans of their own gender, but open to having sexual and/or romantic interactions with humans of a gender other than their own.\n\nIntersex\n\nIntersex people are born with any variation in sex characteristics including anatomy, reproductive organs and/or chromosomes patterns that do not fit the typical definition of male or female. An intersex person may have any gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nKink\n\nA wide-ranging term for any unconventional sexual preference or behaviour.\n\nLesbian\n\nLesbian refers to women who feel sexual, romantic and/or emotional attraction towards women. Some non-binary humans may also identify with this term.\n\nLover\n\nA person who you have or have had a sexual relationship with. Romance is not necessarily a factor.\n\nMMF\n\nA threesome where two participants identify as male, and one as female.\n\nMMM\n\nA threesome between three male-identifying participants.\n\nMarried\n\nA person you have wed, either culturally, legally, or both.\n\nMetamour\n\nYour partnerâs partner. You both have romantic or sexual relationships with the same person, though not with each other.\n\nNesting Partner\n\nTwo or more people who cohabit. You may share financial responsibilities, a bed, have sex, or raise children, though none of these are inherent to your nesting partnership.\n\nNon-binary\n\nA non-binary person has a gender identity which cannot be defined within the traditional binary of male or female. Itâs a broad term which encompasses many ways to identify.\n\nObjectumsexual\n\nObject sexuality or objectophilia is a form of sexual and/or romantic attraction focussing on specific inanimate objects.\n\nOmnisexual\n\nOmnisexuality is characterised by sexual desire and/or attraction that is not limited to people of a particular gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nPangender\n\nPangender or omnigender people identify with a multiplicity of genders, either at the same time or fluctuating between them, similarly to gender-fluid.\n\nPansexual\n\nA human who feels attraction to other humans regardless of gender identity.\n\nPartner\n\nAn individual with whom youâre in a relationship.\n\nPlay Partner\n\nIn the world of polyamory, a play partner is someone with whom you engage in non-monogamous, recreational, and often casual sexual and/or romantic activities.\n\nPoly\n\nA shortened term for Polyamory.\n\nPolyamorous/Polyamory\n\nPolyamory - sometimes known as Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM) or Consensual Non Monogamy (CSM) - constitutes having consensual relationships that involve multiple partners. Polyamorous humans communicate openly with their partners about having â or having the desire to have â relationships with others. Relationships often have an emotional element, as well as a sexual one. Do not confuse it withâ¦\n\nPolysexual\n\nPolysexuals are humans who are romantically or sexually attracted to some, but not all, genders.\n\nPrimary Partner\n\nWithin a non-monogamous framework, a partner who takes priority over your other relationships. This person may be someone youâre married to, live with, or have children with.\n\nQueer\n\nQueer is term used by humans who reject specific labels of sexual and romantic orientation, and/or gender identity. Originally a slur, it has been reclaimed as a term of expression which encompasses a wide range of identities and behaviours. Itâs a term which is often politically-charged and indicates a rejection of traditional norms (eg. as in âgenderqueerâ, above).\n\nQueerplatonic Partner\n\nSomeone with whom you are in a committed, intimate relationship that is not romantic in nature.\n\nSecondary Partner\n\nA secondary partner is someone with whom you have a sexual or romantic relationship with beyond your primary partner.\n\nSensual\n\nBeing particularly into receiving or giving pleasure that involves the senses, such as light touch and taste.\n\nSingles\n\nA human not committed to a specific partner.\n\nSkoliosexual\n\nSkoliosexual humans are primarily sexually, romantically and/or aesthetically attracted to genderqueer, transgender and/or non-binary humans. Note that this label is considered controversial: while some genderqueer and non-binary humans use it to find peers, some people see it as fetishising and othering. Because of this, we kindly ask our cisgender members to refrain from using this sexuality label.\n\nSub\n\nThe counterpoint to the dom/domme, submissives receive sexual pleasure and gratification from the relinquishing of power and control to another.\n\nSubmissive/sub\n\nThe counterpoint to dom / dominant, submissives receive sexual pleasure and gratification from the relinquishing of power and control to another in the bedroom.\n\nSwitch\n\nSomeone who is comfortable playing both the dom/domme and submissive roles in a BDSM dynamic. Two (or more) switches together may negotiate or exchange roles during a session.\n\nTexting\n\nMessaging another human in ways that can be both conversational and/or sensual.\n\nThreeway\n\nAn enthusiastically consensual sexual encounter between three humans.\n\nTrans Man\n\nTrans men (or FtM/MtM) are people assigned female at birth (or born with intersex characteristics) but who identify as male. Trans men can have any sexual orientation.\n\nTrans Woman\n\nTransgender women are people assigned male at birth (or born with certain intersex characteristics) but who identify as female. Trans women can have any sexual orientation.\n\nTransfeminine\n\nPeople who were assigned male at birth, but who identify more with femininity than masculinity. Transfeminine people often prefer to present femininely or to transition to feminine gender expression, but do not always identify as female.\n\nTransmasculine\n\nThe counterpoint to Transfeminine, this term refers to people who were assigned female at birth, but who identify with masculinity to a greater extent than with femininity. While transmasculine people usually prefer a more masculine gender expression, they do not necessarily always identify as male.\n\nTwo-Spirit\n\nTwo Spirit is a culturally distinct gender that encompasses possessing aspects of both a feminine and masculine spirit. It refers to the one of many mixed gender roles traditionally found among many Native Americans and Canadian First Nations indigenous groups. People who are not Native American should refrain from calling themselves Two-Spirit."
