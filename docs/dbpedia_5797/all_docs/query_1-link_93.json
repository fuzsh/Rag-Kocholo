        "text": "Biological Sex/Assigned Sex: The physiological and anatomical characteristics of maleness\n\nand femaleness with which a person is born or that develop with physical maturity. These\n\nmarkers including internal and external reproductive organs, chromosomes, hormones, and body\n\nshape. Infants are usually assigned to a sex category (usually male or female) at birth on the basis\n\nof such characteristics (primarily the appearance of the external genitals) (Bornstein, 1994, 1998).\n\nWe therefore use assigned sex to refer to the sex designation that appears on birth certificates\n\nand other legal documents. See also intersex.Cissexism: The assumption of legitimacy and preference for people whose gender identity and\n\nbiological sex align along the binary. In other words, cissexism assumes that all people identify\n\ntheir gender identity and expression with the sex that they were assigned at birth. See\n\nheterosexism.Endocrinology: The area of study in biology and medicine which directly relates to hormones\n\nand the glands which produce hormones.Genderism: A belief system in which the male/female; man/woman binaries are preferred and\n\nheld as the only legitimate identities. Moreover, assigned sex is determined to be inextricably\n\nlinked to gender. This serves as the basis to exclude all who do not fit into this spectrum.Harry Benjamin Standards of Care: In 1966, Harry Benjamin created the Standards of Care as\n\nethical guidelines for the care and treatment of transsexuals. Benjamin’s guiding principles\n\ndictated the requirements necessary for a person to be considered transsexual and to qualify for\n\nmedical transition, as well as the scope of therapies, treatments and surgeries that a transition\n\nwould include. Although many therapists and medical providers still rely on the Standards of\n\nCare, the guidelines are often adhered to less rigidly than in the past.Genderbashing: Physical and/or verbal violence directed towards an individual or group based\n\non the target’s gender identity, gender expression, or the perception of these identities.Gender Affirmation or Gender Confirmation Surgery: A social, medical, and/or surgical\n\nprocess that one undergoes for the purpose of having their body and expression be more\n\nconsistent with their gender identity. It may be quite costly, and not everyone who desires\n\nsurgery has equal access. Also known as Gender Reassignment Surgery (GRS) or Sexual\n\nReassignment Surgery (SRS), although these phrases are more outdated now. As with any\n\nidentity term, every individual will have a preference in word choice to describe this process for\n\nthemselves.Gender Conformity: An investment and participation in the social expectations of the\n\nconstructions of gender identity and gender expression, particularly in alignment with assigned\n\nsex. This often means identifying and communicating one’s own gender within a binary and\n\ncisgendered way.Gender Dysphoria: A psychiatric/medical diagnosis included in the Diagnostic and Statistical\n\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSMV) to describe when a person assigned one gender based on\n\ntheir birth sex identifies as a different gender, or does not conform with the gender roles\n\nassociated with their birth sex. This can manifest in many ways, including varying levels of body\n\ndysphoria, and general discomfort living as the assigned sex and/or gender.Gender Recognition Act (GRA): An act of parliament in the United Kingdom passed in 2004\n\nthat gives trans identified individuals the right to legally change their gender on a birth certificate.\n\nThis is done by presenting evidence of their identities to a Gender Recognition Panel, which\n\nmay then issue a Gender Recognition Certificate. There is no requirement to have undergone\n\ngender confirmation surgery prior to this application.Hijra: Culturally connected to South Asia and India in particular, Hijras are biological males\n\nwho have woman-identified gender identity and expression. Historically, for more than 4,000\n\nyears, Hijras have lived in well-structured communities together and been led by a guru. Since\n\nthe 1900’s, Hijras have created a social justice movement in an effort to be seen in a third gender\n\ncategory, as opposed to either male or female.Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): The process of taking hormones to achieve the\n\nsecondary sex characteristics of a particular sex. For example, taking testosterone in order to\n\nachieve more male-identified features is a type of HRT.Hyperfemininity / Hypermasculinity: Refers to an exaggerated performance, behavior, or\n\ninvestment in gender expression in an extreme binary way. This can often be seen in gender\n\nexclusive spaces, in which masculinity or femininity are exclusive from one another (ex. sports\n\nclubs). Often these spaces can be exclusive, and emotionally or even physically dangerous for\n\ngender non-conforming and trans identified individuals.Masculinization / Feminization: The development of primary and secondary sex\n\ncharacteristics in prepubescent adolescents. Also referred to as an aspect of some gender\n\nconfirmation processes in which hormones and surgical procedures are used to reflect the\n\naesthetics of an individual’s desired gender identity or expression.Medical Model: A clinical view of gender variance, rooted in biological and psychological\n\norientations, with an understanding that transsexuality and transgender identity are medical and\n\nmental health conditions, in need of diagnosis, treatment, and cure.People of Transgender Experience: Used in some parts of the country for people who have\n\ntransitioned and now identify as man or woman rather than transgender. Can also be used as an\n\noverarching term for anyone in the trans community.Queer: An umbrella identity term taken by people who do not conform to heterosexual and/or\n\ngender binary norms; a reclaimed derogatory slur taken as a political term to unite people who\n\nare marginalized because of their non-conformity to dominant gender identities and/or\n\nheterosexuality.Sex: It is the designation of the biological differences between females and males. This is the\n\nscientific term for what makes males and females different; remember, though, that not\n\neveryone fits into the two categories of male and female. There are a number of other different\n\nfactors that determine sex, not just chromosomes.Sexual Orientation: Determines the focus of our sexual/erotic drives, desires, and fantasies,\n\nand the inclination or capacity to develop intimate, emotional and sexual relationships with other\n\npeople. Sexual orientation is usually quantified in terms of gender — both an individual’s own\n\ngender and the gender(s) of the people to whom that person is attracted and/or with whom they\n\nengage in intimate relationships and/or sexual behavior.Trans: This is a gender identity term that was coined by trans activists in an effort to create\n\nlanguage that the trans community could feel connected to and really own. Transgender was a\n\nterm that many believe is related to the history of the word transgenderist. The activist who\n\ncoined transgenderist was adamantly and controversially opposed to gender affirmation surgery\n\nand worked very hard to distinguish transgenderists from transsexuals. Within the last 10 years,\n\ntrans or trans has begun to appear in literature as an umbrella term for the gender non-\n\nconforming community. Trans is so new as a term that its definition is still developing, but can\n\nbe seen as a within-community umbrella term.Transfeminine: A self-identification term for gender identity or gender expression in which a\n\nperson who is born male does not feel connected to a sense of being a man. Rather, someone\n\nidentifying as transfeminine would likely feel much closer to the culturally identified woman,\n\nfemale and feminine identified expressions, and yet, not identify as “woman”.Transgenderist: A person who lives full time in the gender of his or her choice (different from\n\nthe body type) without desiring gender reassignment surgery. Some transgenderists consider\n\nthemselves to be “non-operative” transsexuals. Transgenderists may or may not choose to take\n\nhormones to permanently alter their appearance.Transition: The process of moving from one gender to another. For example, “I transitioned\n\nfrom male to female in 1996”.Trans Jurisprudence: The theory and method behind the legal reasoning of litigation regarding\n\ntrans and gender non-conforming issues that are brought within this system. Historically, this\n\nmeant a preoccupation with the biological and aesthetic functionality of trans folks, particularly\n\nin regard to (hetero)sexual functionality.Trans man: A trans man is a person who identifies as a man and has been through a gender\n\naffirmation process of some type.Transmasculine: A self-identification term for gender identity or gender expression in which a\n\nperson who is born female does not feel connected to a sense of being a woman. Rather,\n\nsomeone identifying as transmasculine would likely feel much closer to the culturally identified\n\nman, male and masculine identified expressions and yet, not identify as “man”.Transmisogyny: The confluence of the definitions of transphobia, and misogyny. It is the\n\nnegative attitudes, expressed through cultural hate, individual and state violence, and\n\ndiscrimination directed toward trans women and trans and gender non-conforming people on\n\nthe feminine end of the gender spectrum. Transmisogyny targets trans women, trans and gender\n\nnon-conforming people who may not identify as women, but who present feminine\n\ncharacteristics and/or identify along the feminine end of the gender expression spectrum.Transphobia: The irrational fear of people who identify, or are perceived to be, trans and/or\n\ngender non-conforming."
