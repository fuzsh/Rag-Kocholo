No glossary will encompass the complete range of identities and terms that are used within LGBTQ communities. Over time, language and terminology may shift.

(Cisgender has its origin in the Latin-derived prefix cis-, meaning “to/this the near side,” which is antonymous with the Latin-derived prefix trans).\n\nCissexism: Norms and behaviors that result from the assumption that all people are or should be cisgender. This system of oppression assumes that being cisgender is inherently normal and superior and negates transgender individuals’ lives and relationships.\n\nCloset: Used as slang for the state of not publicizing one’s sexual orientation or gender identity, keeping it private, living an outwardly heterosexual life while identifying as LGBTQ, or not being forthcoming about one’s identity.

This term is also used to describe a specific lesbian identity (ie. butch/femme). Use the term with caution since in some contexts it can be perceived as offensive.\n\nFluid: A sexual or gender identity that exists beyond a binary system of either gay or straight, man or woman. People with a fluid identity may resist using labels or choosing boxes to define themselves. Also used by people whose sexual or gender identity is not fixed on one point of a continuum.\n\nFTM: An abbreviation for a female-to-male transgender individual. This person most likely uses masculine pronouns.\n\nGay: At times, “gay” is used to refer to all people, regardless of sex, who have their primary sexual and or romantic attractions to people of the same sex. The term can also exclusively refer to men who are emotionally, romantically, sexually, affectionately, or relationally attracted to other men, or who identify as members of the gay community.

Transgender, transexual, intersex, genderqueer, cross-dresser, etc.)\n\nGender Neutral: noting or pertaining to a word that does not refer to one sex only. Typically used in an effort be inclusive of gender nonconformity, however, a better phrase to use would be “Gender Inclusive.” “Gender Neutral” is often insulting to many trans people and can be compared to the phrase “color blind” often heard in reference to “not seeing” race.\n\nGender Presentation: An individual’s physical characteristics, such as physical appearance or dress, that outwardly shows their own gender identity.\n\nGender Role: Norms of expected behavior for men and women assigned primarily on the basis of biological sex; a sociological construct which varies from culture to culture.\n\nGender Transition:The social, psychological, legal, or medical process of transitioning from one gender or gender expression to another. Gender transition is an individualized process and does not involve the same steps for everyone. Transition may include telling one’s social support network; legally changing one’s name or sex/gender marker; therapeutic treatment with hormones; and possibly, though in not all instances, surgery. Often referred to as just “transition”.\n\nGender Variant: 1: A term that describes those who dress, behave or express themselves in a way that does not conform to dominant gender norms. 2: Thought to be similar to gender non-conforming, gender variance can describe behavior or gender expression by an individual that does not match masculine and feminine gender norms. Some people do not use this term because they feel it suggests these identities are abnormal, preferring terms such as “gender creative” and “gender expansive.”\n\nGenderqueer: A gender variant person whose gender identity is neither male nor female, is between or beyond genders, or is some combination of genders. Individuals that identify as genderqueer often challenge gender stereotypes and the gender binary system.\n\nGoldilocks: A straight woman who associates mostly or exclusively with bears.\n\nGrey-A: The gray area between asexuality and sexuality.

Homophobic reactions often lead to intolerance, bigotry and violence against anyone not acting within socio-cultural norms of heterosexuality. Because most LGBTQ people are raised in the same society as heterosexuals, they learn the same beliefs and stereotypes prevalent in the dominant society, leading to a phenomenon known as internalized homophobia, whereas LGBTQ-identified individuals feel shame, guilt or hatred towards the part of themselves identified as LGBTQ.\n\nHomoromantic: A person who is romantically attracted to a member of the same sex or gender. A homoromantic person is not necessarily sexually attracted to the same sex or gender.\n\nHomosexual: The clinical term, coined in the field of psychology, for people with a same-sex sexual attraction. The word is often associated with the idea that same-sex attractions are a mental disorder, and is therefore potentially offensive to some people.\n\nInternalized Homophobia: The fear and self-hate of one’s own homosexuality or bisexuality in individuals who have learned negative ideas about homosexuality throughout childhood. One form of internalized oppression is the acceptance of the myths and stereotypes applied to the oppressed group.

Intersex individuals are not always aware that they have this condition. Replaces the inaccurate term “hermaphrodite.”\n\nKinsey Scale: The continuum model devised by Alfred Kinsey in 1948 that plotted sexuality from 0 to 6; 0 being exclusively heterosexual and 6 being exclusively homosexual. It was the first scale to account for bisexuality. According to a 1954 survey using the scale, 70% of people fell between 1 and 5. It’s been criticized for being too linear and only accounting for behavior and not sexual identity and is no longer widely used.\n\nLeather: The leather subculture denotes practices and styles of dress organized around sexual activities. Wearing leather garments is one way that participants in this culture self-consciously distinguish themselves from mainstream sexual cultures. Leather culture is most visible in gay communities and most often associated with gay men (“leathermen”), but it is also reflected in various ways in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual worlds. Many people associate leather culture with BDSM (Bondage/Discipline, Dominance/Submission, Sado/Masochism)\n\nLesbian: A woman who is emotionally, romantically, sexually, affectionately, or relationally attracted to other women, or someone who identifies as a member of the lesbian community. Bisexual women may or may not feel included by this term.\n\nLGBTQ – 1. A common abbreviation for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning community. The acronym is used as an umbrella term when talking about non-heterosexual and non-cisgender identities and does not always reflect members of the community. The acronym may be expanded to LGBTQIA to include intersex individuals, and allies/asexual, or shortened to LGBQ when only discussing sexual orientation. 2.A descriptive adjective (ex. “I am an LGBTQ individual”).\n\nLifestyle: A word often used outside the LGBTQ community to describe life as an LGBTQ person, e.g. “the homosexual lifestyle.” Many people find this word inappropriate because it trivializes identity, implies that sexual orientation is a choice, and ignores the variety of lifestyles that LGBTQ people live.\n\nLipstick Lesbian: Usually refers to a lesbian with a feminine gender expression. Can be used in a positive or a derogatory way, depending on who is using it.

This person most likely uses feminine pronouns.\n\nMale: a person with a specific set of sexual anatomy (e.g., 46, XY phenotype, penis, testis, higher levels of testosterone, coarse body hair, facial hair) pursuant to this label.\n\nMasculinity: refers to qualities that are thought of as being manly, that are typically ascribed to men, and that are considered to be socially appropriate for a man’s behavior. People who exhibit self-described masculinity do not necessarily think of themselves as men: some women (including trans women) are masculine, some men are, some genderqueer or androgynous people are.\n\nMetrosexual: A term popularized in the 1990s referring to a heterosexual male who assumes characteristics traditionally associated with gay male stereotypes. While the term seems to imply a shift in sexual orientation it more accurately reflects a loosening of restrictions around male gender role adherence and is not related to sexuality.\n\nNeutrois: A person who is not regularly internally gendered.\n\nNon-binary: An identity commonly used by people who do not identify or express their gender within the gender binary.\n\nNo Homo: An offensive phrase often used after someone has inadvertently said something that others may consider gay.\n\nOmnisexual: A person who is sexually attracted to all sexes or gender identities.\n\nOthering: The process of perceiving or portraying someone or something as fundamentally different or alien.\n\nOtter: A slender, hairy member of the bear community with a passive personality.\n\nOuting: When someone discloses information about another’s sexual orientation or gender identity without their knowledge and/or consent.\n\nPanromantic: A person whose romantic attractions are not influenced by sex or gender identity.\n\nPansexual: A person who is emotionally, romantically, sexually, affectionately, or relationally attracted to people regardless of their gender identity or biological sex.\n\nPassing: Being taken or assumed for a member of the dominant group–white, straight, cisgender (non-transgender), for example, LGBTQI people who have the ability to pass can choose to conceal the stigma associated with being a member of a sexual minority.\n\nPer: A gender-inclusive alternative pronoun to he or she. Derives from “person.”\n\nPride: A healthy self-respect, which, in the context of the gay community, promotes empowerment, education, safe living, and the sense that it is “okay to be LGBT+.” Also used to refer to Pride month season and events in June.\n\nPrivilege: A special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to one person or group of people. Operates on personal, interpersonal, cultural and institutional levels, gives advantages, favors and benefits to members of dominant groups at the expense of members of marginalized groups, and people in dominant groups are frequently unaware that they are members of the dominant group due to the privilege of being able to see themselves as persons rather than stereotypes.\n\nPronouns: One class of words that an individual would like others to use when talking to or about that individual (for example, he/him/his, she/her/hers, or they/them/theirs).\n\nPolyamorous: Describes the practice or desire of engaging in multiple romantic and/or sexual relationships, with the consent of all the people involved.\n\nPolyromantic: A person who is romantically attracted to all or many genders or gender expressions.\n\nQueen: A slang term used to refer to flamboyant or effeminate gay men. The term can either be pejorative or celebrated as a type of self-identification.\n\nQueer: Term describing people who have a non-normative gender identity, sexual orientation or sexual anatomy—includes lesbians, gay men, bisexual people, and transgender people and allies.

The term is also used by those who consider themselves asexual to describe the gender(s) to which they are romantically attracted. The term is preferred by some over “sexual orientation” because it indicates that the feelings and commitments involved are not solely (or even primarily, for some people) sexual. The term stresses the affective emotional component of attractions and relationships, regardless or orientation. Is also referred to as affectional orientation.\n\nSame-Gender Loving (SGL): A term used by some African-American individuals to describe their sexual orientation, as a result of the perception that “gay” and “lesbian” are primarily white terms. “Same-sex loving” is also in use.\n\nSapiosexual: A person who is emotionally, romantically, sexually, affectionately, or relationally attracted to intelligence and its use.\n\nSensual Attraction: Attraction to another person involving the senses, usually the sense of touch. This is not an explicitly sexual form of physical touch, for example, sensual attraction could involve an interest in nonsexual forms of touch such as cuddling, kissing, or massage. Sensual attraction can also be applied in non-tactile ways, such as attraction to voices.\n\nSex: 1. A biological term dividing a species into male or female, usually on the basis of sex chromosomes (XX = female, XY = male); hormone levels, secondary sex characteristics, and internal and external genitalia may also be considered criteria. 2. Another term for sexual behavior or gratification. Sex is a biological fact or a physical act.\n\nSex Change/Sex Reassignment Surgery: Outdated, often times found to be offensive.

This does not generally describe an attraction to specific genitalia or birth assignments but rather is an inclusive term. It is a slightly controversial label, and for that reason, some people usually choose to use the word “ceterosexual” instead, even though it’s meant for non-binary people only.\n\nSquish: a term used to describe an interest in somebody that goes beyond traditional friendship roles and experiences. An aromantic “crush,” a desire for a platonic relationship with someone.\n\nStealth: This term refers to when a person chooses to be secretive in the public sphere about their gender history, either after transitioning or while successfully passing. (Also referred to as: going stealth)\n\nStereotype: An oversimplified generalization about a group of people without regard to their individual differences. Some stereotypes can be positive, however, they can have a negative impact, simply because they involve broad generalizations that ignore individual realities.\n\nStraight-Acting: A term, usually applied to gay men, who readily pass as heterosexual. The term implies that there is a stereotypical way gay men act that is significantly different from heterosexual men.\n\nStud: Refers to an African-American and/or Latina masculine queer woman. Also known as ‘ag.’\n\nThat’s So Gay: A phrase commonly used to describe something as foolish, stupid or negative.\n\nThird Gender: A term for those who belong to a category other than masculine or feminine.
