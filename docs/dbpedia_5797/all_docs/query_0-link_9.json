They may use different terms to describe themselves over time.\n\nAce\n\nAn umbrella term used specifically to describe a lack of, varying, or occasional experiences of sexual attraction. This encompasses asexual people as well as those who identify as demisexual and grey-sexual. Ace people who experience romantic attraction or occasional sexual attraction might also use terms such as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and queer in conjunction with asexual to describe the direction of their romantic or sexual attraction.\n\nFind out more about ace identities on our Ace Hub.\n\nAce and aro/ace and aro spectrum\n\nUmbrella terms used to describe the wide group of people who experience a lack of, varying, or occasional experiences of romantic and/or sexual attraction, including a lack of attraction. People who identify under these umbrella terms may describe themselves using one or more of a wide variety of terms, including, but not limited to, asexual, ace, aromantic, aro, demi, grey, and abro. People may also use terms such as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and queer in conjunction with ace and aro to explain the direction of romantic or sexual attraction if and when they experience it.\n\nHere are five things you should know about aro people.\n\nAllo (sexual and romantic)\n\nAllo people experience sexual and romantic attraction, and do not identify as on the ace or aro spectrum. Allo is to ace and aro spectrum identities, as straight is to LGB+ spectrum identities. It is important to use words that equalise experience, otherwise the opposite to ace and aro becomes ‘normal’ which is stigmatising.\n\nAro\n\nAn umbrella term used specifically to describe a lack of, varying, or occasional experiences of romantic attraction. This encompasses aromantic people as well as those who identify as demiromantic and grey-romantic. Aro people who experience sexual attraction or occasional romantic attraction might also use terms such as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and queer in conjunction with asexual to describe the direction of their attraction.\n\nAromantic\n\nA person who does not experience romantic attraction. Some aromantic people experience sexual attraction, while others do not. Aromantic people who experience sexual attraction or occasional romantic attraction might also use terms such as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and queer in conjunction with asexual to describe the direction of their attraction.\n\nAsexual\n\nA person who does not experience sexual attraction. Some asexual people experience romantic attraction, while others do not. Asexual people who experience romantic attraction might also use terms such as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and queer in conjunction with asexual to describe the direction of their romantic attraction.\n\nAlly\n\nA (typically) straight and/or cis person who supports members of the LGBT community.\n\nB\n\nBi\n\nBi is an umbrella term used to describe a romantic and/or sexual orientation towards more than one gender.\n\nBi people may describe themselves using one or more of a wide variety of terms, including, but not limited to, bisexual, pan, queer, and some other non-monosexual and non-monoromantic identities.\n\nLearn more about bi experiences on our Bi Hub.\n\n​Biphobia\n\nThe fear or dislike of someone who identifies as bi based on prejudice or negative attitudes, beliefs or views about bi people. Biphobic bullying may be targeted at people who are, or who are perceived to be, bi.\n\n​Butch\n\nButch is a term used in LBT culture to describe someone who expresses themselves in a typically masculine way.\n\nThere are other identities within the scope of butch, such as ‘soft butch’ and ‘stone butch’. You shouldn’t use these terms about someone unless you know they identify with them.\n\n​C\n\nCisgender or Cis\n\nSomeone whose gender identity is the same as the sex they were assigned at birth. Non-trans is also used by some people.\n\n​Coming out\n\nWhen a person first tells someone/others about their orientation and/or gender identity.\n\nFind out more about coming out and supporting others with their journey.\n\n​D\n\nDeadnaming\n\nCalling someone by their birth name after they have changed their name. This term is often associated with trans people who have changed their name as part of their transition.\n\nDemi (sexual and romantic)\n\nAn umbrella term used to describe people who may only feel sexually or romantically attracted to people with whom they have formed an emotional bond.

You shouldn’t use these terms about someone unless you know they identify with them.\n\n​G\n\nGay\n\nRefers to a man who has a romantic and/or sexual orientation towards men. Also a generic term for lesbian and gay sexuality - some women define themselves as gay rather than lesbian. Some non-binary people may also identify with this term.\n\n​Gender\n\nOften expressed in terms of masculinity and femininity, gender is largely culturally determined and is assumed from the sex assigned at birth.\n\n​Gender dysphoria\n\nUsed to describe when a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their sex assigned at birth and their gender identity.\n\nThis is also the clinical diagnosis for someone who doesn’t feel comfortable with the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\n​Gender expression\n\nHow a person chooses to outwardly express their gender, within the context of societal expectations of gender. A person who does not conform to societal expectations of gender may not, however, identify as trans.\n\n​Gender identity\n\nA person’s innate sense of their own gender, whether male, female or something else (see non-binary below), which may or may not correspond to the sex assigned at birth.\n\n​Gender reassignment\n\nAnother way of describing a person’s transition. To undergo gender reassignment usually means to undergo some sort of medical intervention, but it can also mean changing names, pronouns, dressing differently and living in their self-identified gender.\n\nGender reassignment is a characteristic that is protected by the Equality Act 2010, and it is further interpreted in the Equality Act 2010 approved code of practice. It is a term of much contention and is one that Stonewall's Trans Advisory Group feels should be reviewed.​\n\nGender Recognition Certificate (GRC)\n\nThis enables trans people to be legally recognised in their affirmed gender and to be issued with a new birth certificate. Not all trans people will apply for a GRC and you currently have to be over 18 to apply.\n\nYou do not need a GRC to change your gender markers at work or to legally change your gender on other documents such as your passport.\n\n​Gillick competence\n\nA term used in medical law to decide whether a child (under 16 years of age) is able to consent to their own medical treatment, without the need for parental permission or knowledge.\n\nGrey (sexual and romantic)\n\nAlso known as grey-A, this is an umbrella term which describes people who experience attraction occasionally, rarely, or only under certain conditions. People may also use terms such as gay, bi, lesbian, straight and queer in conjunction with grey to explain the direction of romantic or sexual attraction as they experience it.\n\n​H\n\nHeterosexual/straight\n\nRefers to a man who has a romantic and/or sexual orientation towards women or to a woman who has a romantic and/or sexual orientation towards men.\n\n​Homosexual\n\nThis might be considered a more medical term used to describe someone who has a romantic and/or sexual orientation towards someone of the same gender. The term ‘gay’ is now more generally used.\n\n​Homophobia\n\nThe fear or dislike of someone, based on prejudice or negative attitudes, beliefs or views about lesbian, gay or bi people. Homophobic bullying may be targeted at people who are, or who are perceived to be, lesbian, gay or bi.\n\n​I\n\nIntersex\n\nA term used to describe a person who may have the biological attributes of both sexes or whose biological attributes do not fit with societal assumptions about what constitutes male or female.\n\nIntersex people may identify as male, female or non-binary.\n\nStonewall works with intersex groups to provide its partners and stakeholders information and evidence about areas of disadvantage experienced by intersex people but does not, after discussions with members of the intersex community, include intersex issues as part of its current remit at this stage.\n\n​L\n\nLesbian\n\nRefers to a woman who has a romantic and/or sexual orientation towards women. Some non-binary people may also identify with this term.\n\nLearn more about lesbian experiences on our Lesbian Hub.\n\n​Lesbophobia\n\nThe fear or dislike of someone because they are or are perceived to be a lesbian.​\n\nLGBTQ+\n\nThe acronym for lesbian, gay, bi, trans, queer, questioning and ace.\n\n​N\n\n​Non-binary\n\nAn umbrella term for people whose gender identity doesn’t sit comfortably with ‘man’ or ‘woman’. Non-binary identities are varied and can include people who identify with some aspects of binary identities, while others reject them entirely.\n\nRead about what it's like to be non-binary in the UK today.\n\n​O\n\nOrientation\n\nOrientation is an umbrella term describing a person's attraction to other people. This attraction may be sexual (sexual orientation) and/or romantic (romantic orientation). These terms refers to a person's sense of identity based on their attractions, or lack thereof.\n\nOrientations include, but are not limited to, lesbian, gay, bi, ace and straight.\n\n​Outed\n\nWhen a lesbian, gay, bi or trans person’s sexual orientation or gender identity is disclosed to someone else without their consent.\n\n​P\n\nPerson with a trans history\n\nSomeone who identifies as male or female or a man or woman, but was assigned the opposite sex at birth. This is increasingly used by people to acknowledge a trans past.\n\n​Pan\n\nRefers to a person whose romantic and/or sexual attraction towards others is not limited by sex or gender.\n\nDebunk 5 common misconceptions about pansexuality.\n\n​Passing\n\nIf someone is regarded, at a glance, to be a cisgender man or cisgender woman.\n\nCisgender refers to someone whose gender identity matches the sex they were ‘assigned’ at birth. This might include physical gender cues (hair or clothing) and/or behaviour which is historically or culturally associated with a particular gender.\n\nPlatonic partnerships\n\nPeople who are on the ace and/or aro spectrum may have platonic partnerships. These are relationships where there is a high level of mutual commitment which can include shared life decisions, shared living arrangements, and co-parenting of children. These partnerships can include more than two people. Like allosexual and alloromantic people, ace and aro spectrum people may be monogamous or polyamorous.\n\n​Pronoun\n\nWords we use to refer to people’s gender in conversation - for example, ‘he’ or ‘she’. Some people may prefer others to refer to them in gender neutral language and use pronouns such as they/their and ze/zir.\n\nQ\n\nQueer\n\nQueer is a term used by those wanting to reject specific labels of romantic orientation, sexual orientation and/or gender identity. It can also be a way of rejecting the perceived norms of the LGBT community (racism, sizeism, ableism etc). Although some LGBT people view the word as a slur, it was reclaimed in the late 80s by the queer community who have embraced it.\n\n​Questioning\n\nThe process of exploring your own sexual orientation and/or gender identity.\n\n​R\n\nRomantic orientation\n\nA person’s romantic attraction to other people, or lack thereof. Along with sexual orientation, this forms a person’s orientation identity.\n\nStonewall uses the term ‘orientation’ as an umbrella term covering sexual and romantic orientations.\n\nS\n\nSex\n\nAssigned to a person on the basis of primary sex characteristics (genitalia) and reproductive functions. Sometimes the terms ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ are interchanged to mean ‘male’ or ‘female’.\n\n​Sexual orientation\n\nA person’s sexual attraction to other people, or lack thereof. Along with romantic orientation, this forms a person’s orientation identity.\n\nStonewall uses the term ‘orientation’ as an umbrella term covering sexual and romantic orientations.\n\nSpectrum\n\nA term used to cover a variety of identities that have a root commonality or shared experience.\n\nT\n\nTrans\n\nAn umbrella term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nTrans people may describe themselves using one or more of a wide variety of terms, including (but not limited to) transgender, transsexual, genderqueer (GQ), genderfluid, non-binary, gender-variant, genderless, agender, nongender, third gender, bigender, trans man, trans woman, trans masculine, trans feminine and neutrois.\n\nFind out more about trans experiences on our Trans Hub.\n\n​Transgender man\n\nA term used to describe someone who is assigned female at birth but identifies and lives as a man. This may be shortened to trans man, or FTM, an abbreviation for female-to-male.\n\nTransgender woman\n\nA term used to describe someone who is assigned male at birth but identifies and lives as a woman. This may be shortened to trans woman, or MTF, an abbreviation for male-to-female.\n\n​​Transitioning\n\nThe steps a trans person may take to live in the gender with which they identify. Each person’s transition will involve different things. For some this involves medical intervention, such as hormone therapy and surgeries, but not all trans people want or are able to have this.\n\nTransitioning also might involve things such as telling friends and family, dressing differently and changing official documents.\n\n​Transphobia\n\nThe fear or dislike of someone based on the fact they are trans, including denying their gender identity or refusing to accept it. Transphobia may be targeted at people who are, or who are perceived to be, trans.\n\n​Transsexual\n\nThis was used in the past as a more medical term (similarly to homosexual) to refer to someone whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nThis term is still used by some although many people prefer the term trans or transgender.​\n\nU\n\nUndetectable\n\nHIV medication (antiretroviral treatment, or ART) works by reducing the amount of the virus in the blood to undetectable levels. This means the levels of HIV are so low that the virus cannot be passed on. This is called having an undetectable viral load or being undetectable."
