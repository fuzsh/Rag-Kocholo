        "text": "As of June 15, 2023, the data field previously labeled “Gender” is now labeled “Birth sex” In WaitlistSM and TIEDI®. This update aligns to the current data definition for the field, which is intended to collect biologic and physiologic traits (sex) at birth.\n\nIn September 2023, the remaining UNetSM applications will be similarly updated so that the label “Birth sex” replaces all labels that are currently “Gender.”\n\nAdditionally, liver transplant programs now have a new data field labeled, “Sex for the purposes of adult MELD classification.” This is a required data field for all new adult (18 years of age and older) liver transplant candidates listed on or after June 15, 2023. The field also may be edited for adult candidates already on the OPTN Waiting List. This data is being collected as part of the improvements to MELD, PELD and Status 1A/1B classification to be implemented July 13, 2023.\n\nNo action is required from any member institution regarding the labeling change. Members should continue to report the sex associated with a candidate’s or donor’s biologic and physiologic traits (sex) at birth, in alignment with the current data definition.\n\nPrior to July 13, 2023, liver transplant programs are encouraged to report information on “Sex for the purposes of adult MELD calculation” for all current adult liver transplant candidates.\n\nAdditional information\n\nWhile the previous “Gender” field label is being changed to “Birth sex,” the data definition itself is not changing. A chronological summary of data definition updates is available here."
