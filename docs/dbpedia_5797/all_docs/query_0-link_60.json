        "text": "The female sexual organs include the vagina, vulva, clitoris, cervix, womb, ovaries, urethra and back passage (anal area). Female sex hormones are also an important part of a woman’s sexuality and sex life.\n\nThe vagina, vulva and clitoris\n\nThe vagina is the passage that leads from the cervix to the vulva. The cervix is at the bottom of the womb (uterus). The vulva is visible from outside the body. It forms the skin flaps around the entrance to the vagina.\n\nThe outer flaps are called the labia majora and the inner flaps are called the labia minora. The clitoris sits at the top of the labia minora and is very sensitive to touch. This gives women a lot of their sexual pleasure. During sexual arousal there is an increased blood flow to this area, which leads to swelling and extra sensitivity in the vulva and clitoris.\n\nWe have more information about the vulva, and how it is different from the vagina, on our vuvlval cancer pages.\n\nThe cervix, womb and ovaries\n\nThese organs are found inside the female body and make up a woman’s reproductive system. The cervix is another name for the neck of the womb. It is the opening from the vagina to the womb. There are two ovaries, one on each side of the womb. The womb (uterus) is the pear shaped, muscular bag that protects a growing baby during pregnancy.\n\nIn fertile women the ovaries produce an egg each month. If the woman’s egg is not fertilised by a sperm, the thickened lining of the womb is shed through the vagina as a monthly period. Women are fertile between puberty (when periods start) and menopause (when periods stop).\n\nEach ovary is connected to the womb by a tube called the fallopian tube. The ovaries produce the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, and a small amount of male sex hormones (androgens).\n\nThe urethra and anal area\n\nJust below the clitoris, near the opening to your vagina, is the urethra. This is where urine comes out from your bladder.\n\nBetween the vaginal opening and the opening to your back passage (anus) is an area of skin called the perineum. During an orgasm the muscles in this area tighten.\n\nOther important structures and organs\n\nYour breasts and nipples might enlarge and harden during sexual activity. The dark area around the nipples (areola) might also become larger.\n\nA woman’s buttocks, neck, inner thighs and abdominal area are also very sensitive to touch during sexual activity. These are often called erogenous zones.\n\nEveryone is different. There may be other areas of your body that are more sensitive to touch when you are sexually aroused.\n\nFemale sex hormones\n\nOestrogen\n\nOestrogen is made in the ovaries. It keeps your vagina moist and able to stretch. This natural lubricating and cleaning system is important to help keep your vagina healthy and protect it from infections. When you get sexually aroused the cells lining the vagina release drops of fluid that make the vagina wet.\n\nIf you have low oestrogen levels your vagina may feel dry and be less able to stretch. This can happen in women who have had their menopause. Vaginal dryness is very uncomfortable and can make having sex painful and less pleasurable. There are gels and other treatments that can help.\n\nProgesterone\n\nProgesterone is made in the ovaries and affects the female body in many ways. Its most important function is to prepare the womb (uterus) for receiving and developing a fertilised egg. It also maintains the womb throughout pregnancy.\n\nAndrogens\n\nAndrogens are male sex hormones produced in the testicles. But women have small amounts of these hormones too. These are the hormones that help a woman want to have sex. In other words, they contribute to her level of sexual desire (libido).\n\nIn women, androgens are made in the adrenal glands (found at the top of each kidney) and the ovaries. Even though the ovaries may stop making androgens after menopause, the adrenal glands continue to make enough to support a woman’s sexual desire.\n\nResearch suggests that the factors affecting a woman’s desire for sex are quite complex. Both emotional factors and hormone levels play a part."
