        "meta_description": "Sexual intercourse is the insertion and thrusting of a male's penis into a female's vagina. People and animals that sexually reproduce use sexual intercourse to create offspring. Sometimes sexual intercourse is called coitus, copulation, mating, or fornication, and is more casually known as having sex or sleeping together. The two animals may be of opposite sexes or they may be hermaphroditic, as is the case with snails. Sexual intercourse may also be between individuals of the same sex.",

        "text": "Sexual intercourse (or simply called sex) is the insertion and thrusting of a male's penis into a female's vagina.[1][2] People and animals that sexually reproduce use sexual intercourse to create offspring. Sometimes sexual intercourse is called coitus, copulation, mating, or fornication, and is more casually known as having sex or sleeping together. The two animals may be of opposite sexes or they may be hermaphroditic, as is the case with snails.[3] Sexual intercourse may also be between individuals of the same sex.\n\nHumans sometimes engage in behaviors that do not include the penetration of sexual organs, such as oral intercourse or anal intercourse or by non-sexual organs (fingering, fisting). These behaviors are sometimes included in the definition of sexual intercourse.[2] Sex is usually teleiophilic (between adults).[4]"
