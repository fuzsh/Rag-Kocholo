        "text": "It’s normal for your sex drive to vary when you are pregnant, both increasing and decreasing through the pregnancy.\n\nSex is safe at any point during a low-risk pregnancy. The amazing benefits of sex during pregnancy include:\n\nEasier orgasms\n\nImproved body image\n\nFeeling closer to the partner\n\nBoosting immunity\n\nImproved mood during pregnancy\n\nSex during pregnancy is something that feels a bit taboo to discuss, but it shouldn't be. Doctors worldwide advise pregnant women to continue with their normal sexual activity until there is any underlying risk or underlying medical condition.\n\n19 benefits of sex during pregnancy\n\nCan try new positions\n\nPregnancy can be a fantastic opportunity to try out some new sexual positions. Try some new positions that can accommodate your growing belly. Examples include:\n\nSpooning: Lay on your side with your partner behind you, leaving room for your belly to stick out front. This position prevents pressure on other parts of your body.\n\nHands and knees: In this position, your partner can penetrate you from behind, and your abdomen has room to hang down toward the bed.\n\nWoman on top: This position will give you the most control over your movements as you navigate the changes that come with your growing belly.\n\nIncreases intimacy with your partner without harming the baby\n\nSex is a way to enjoy physical pleasure and intimacy with your partner without harming your baby.\n\nWhen you have gentle sex, the amniotic sac protects your baby. The sac surrounds the baby and holds in the amniotic fluid.\n\nStrong muscles of your uterus and a thick mucus plug near your cervix also provide protection.\n\nDon’t have to worry about birth control\n\nFor obvious reasons, you no longer need to worry about birth control when you’re pregnant. However, you still need to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).\n\nEasier to get an orgasm\n\nWomen gain an average of three pounds of blood throughout their pregnancy. Almost all of this tends to circulate below your waist, making it much easier to have an orgasm.\n\nMight have multiple orgasms\n\nThe increased blood flow near your genital region can make it so easy for you to orgasm that you end up having multiple orgasms or many in a row during a single sexual encounter.\n\nMultiple orgasms are more likely later in your pregnancy when extra blood is present. Also, it helps if you’ve overcome some of the more off-putting symptoms of your first trimester , like nausea.\n\nChance for more oral sex in your life\n\nSome women might find penetrative sex unappealing during their pregnancy. But this doesn’t mean that you’ll dislike all forms of sexual pleasure.\n\nYou can use your pregnancy to incorporate more oral sex into your life. You might find it more comfortable because it doesn’t add pressure to your growing abdomen\n\nBreasts can become more sensitive\n\nYour breasts will become fuller and more sensitive during your pregnancy, which can be arousing for both you and your partner.\n\nSome women find that pregnancy is the first time they enjoy having their breasts fondled as part of their sexual play.\n\nOther women find that their breasts are more tender and uncomfortable when they’re pregnant. Both reactions are normal.\n\nYou need to trust what your body is telling you and only do the actions that feel most comfortable and satisfying for you.\n\nBut don’t hesitate to experiment. You could easily find new things enjoyable when you’re pregnant.\n\nSex can help with your body image\n\nMany women can struggle with their body image as their pregnancy progresses.\n\nAs your waistline diminishes, you may think that the changes your body is going through make you unattractive.\n\nSex is one way to feel good about your body again. It can help you realize that you’re capable of experiencing physical pleasure, no matter how your body changes.\n\nSex can help you feel close to your partner emotionally and physically\n\nPregnancy comes with a slew of physical and emotional changes that can complicate your relationship with your partner. Sex is a great way to feel close again.\n\nBut there’s no need to limit yourself to sex when your goal is intimacy. You and your partner are likely to go through periods when you don’t feel like having sex.\n\nInstead, you can try cuddling and massages as ways to feel physically connected.\n\nSex conversations can pave the way to discussing other worries\n\nIt can be hard to talk about your feelings and the worries you may have about how a baby will change your life. Your partner may be experiencing the same feelings.\n\nTalking about sex can open communication about other important issues, such as concerns about your health and the wellbeing of your baby.\n\nHonest communication is critical for navigating not only your sex life but other aspects of your relationship both during and after your pregnancy.\n\nSex during pregnancy prepares you for childbirth\n\nSexual activity during pregnancy aids in vaginal lubrication. Moreover, vaginal intercourse is quite advantageous.\n\nIt prepares the pelvic muscles and cervix for birth.\n\nSex during pregnancy helps increase oxytocin levels, and it is often suggested to pregnant women, particularly those who have already reached the ninth-month mark.\n\nSexuality during pregnancy ensures the well-being of the baby and the couple\n\nWhen the mother receives pleasure during sexual intercourse and achieves orgasm, the baby benefits.\n\nThese feel-good hormones keep pregnancy-induced hypertension and diabetes at bay ensuring a healthy pregnancy.\n\nSex helps the mother feel desired and cherished by her spouse. It makes her feel safe, which permits the baby to arrive in excellent health.\n\nAdditionally, it ensures the couple's togetherness, love, and understanding while benefiting each person.\n\nStress reduction\n\nSex during pregnancy increases the production of oxytocin (the \"love\" hormone), which reduces pregnant stress, improves sleep, and temporarily masks aches and pains.\n\nSex, bonding, and an increase in endorphins help a pregnant woman sleep better to combat exhaustion and other annoying pregnancy symptoms.\n\nSex is healthy during pregnancy\n\nSex during pregnancy is considered healthy because it strengthens the mother’s immune system to fight infections and protect against seasonal colds and flu.\n\nStudies have reported that sex during pregnancy helps mothers reach normal blood pressure post-sexual activity.\n\nStudies have reported that those who were exposed to more seminal fluid had a decreased risk of preeclampsia. One probable explanation is that the sperm carries a protein called HLA-G, which helps the immune system. More exposure to the paternal cells in this protein may aid in the development of \"immunity\" against preeclampsia.\n\nConsider it as exercise\n\nOne of the most important things during pregnancy is to stay active with recommended exercises.\n\nHaving sex is a type of exercise that lowers your calories by 50 to 150 calories (varies according to how long you've been having sex).\n\nImproves pelvic floor strength\n\nA strong pelvic floor will make childbirth and postpartum recovery much easier for you. Strong pelvic muscles can assist you in easing your baby out, reducing incontinence , and increasing sexual satisfaction.\n\nEnhances blood circulation in the body\n\nImproved blood circulation is one of the numerous advantages of having sex during pregnancy.\n\nThe mother's blood supply increases throughout pregnancy to meet her and the baby's demands.\n\nHowever, inadequate circulation may impede the pregnancy. Sex can help the fetus receive more oxygen and nourishment by producing hormones, which aid in development and growth.\n\nInduces labor and easy delivery\n\nRegular intercourse during pregnancy aids in the contraction of pelvic muscles and opening of the cervix.\n\nThis aids in a vaginal birth, making the labor process smoother. Some physicians recommend having frequent intercourse near your due date to assist in inducing labor.\n\nAccelerates postpartum recovery\n\nOrgasms during pregnancy develop your pelvic floor muscles for childbirth, which speeds up your postpartum recovery by constricting the pelvic muscles.\n\nQUESTION\n\nSee Answer\n\nWhat are the possible disadvantages of sex during pregnancy?\n\nIf you're in good health and experience a normal pregnancy, having sex while pregnant is normally safe and can even be fun. If you have pregnancy difficulties or have had complications in a previous pregnancy, sex may not be safe.\n\nFive possible disadvantages of having sex during pregnancy include:\n\nMay sometimes need to avoid sex in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy\n\nIt is advisable to avoid sexual activity during the first 10 weeks following conception , sometimes known as the first trimester of pregnancy, especially if you have had episodes of bleeding or spotting or a history of previous abortions.\n\nAvoid having sex for too long\n\nAvoid having sex over an extended period because a woman who is fatigued in the early stages of pregnancy owing to nausea and vomiting is more prone to become exhausted.\n\nExcessive pressure, particularly on the abdomen during sex, might result in a miscarriage.\n\nAccording to the medical community, women who have numerous miscarriages, abortions, or weak bodies should avoid physical contact during pregnancy.\n\nPossible chance of infections\n\nDoctors advise that certain women with compromised immune systems require sex protection, especially during pregnancy, because they are more prone to contract infections during intercourse.\n\nDoctors recommend that both men and women clean their sexual organs before and after sexual activity.\n\nSexually transmitted infections can potentially hurt a child's health. Furthermore, people with the human immunodeficiency virus should avoid sexual contact during pregnancy.\n\nInfections are more prone to pass through the cervix even after the eighth month of the intercourse period.\n\nLow libido\n\nWhen intercourse is completely permissible during pregnancy, don't be shocked if you're not experiencing it.\n\nPeople have the least amount of sex throughout the third trimester . This is most likely due to their physical appearance and exhaustion at that time.\n\nProlactin production that occurs throughout pregnancy may lower libido.\n\nCommunicate the same to your partner and participate in healthy sexual talks with them.\n\nAir embolism\n\nIf you're having oral sex while pregnant, make sure your partner doesn't blow air into your vagina. It is highly unlikely, but an air bubble can obstruct one of your blood vessels. This is referred to as an air embolism, and it has the potential to be fatal for both you and your kid.\n\nAgain, this is unusual. If you are concerned, you might ask your spouse to refrain from having oral sex.\n\nMany expecting mothers (and fathers) are concerned about getting busy with a baby on board. Unless your doctor or midwife advises you differently, sex during pregnancy is not only safe for most couples but also beneficial. However, always talk to your doctor about benefits and possible complications because pregnancy is a very sensitive phase for every couple.\n\nWhen to stop and avoid sex during pregnancy\n\nIt is entirely natural and healthy to continue having sex throughout pregnancy if everything is going well with no difficulties as recommended by your doctor. As long as you have a low-risk pregnancy, you should be able to continue with your normal sex life. That is, assuming your sex urge hasn't been down.\n\nHere are a few reasons you may want to stay away from sex:\n\nSpotting throughout pregnancy\n\nHistory of previous abortions\n\nHyperemesis gravidarum\n\nA premature baby in an earlier pregnancy\n\nSigns of preterm labor in this pregnancy\n\nIncompetent cervix (the cervix opens too early during pregnancy, increasing the risk of preterm labor)\n\nPlacenta previa (placenta covers all or part of the cervix)\n\nIf your partner has or had a sexually transmitted infection\n\nMultiple pregnancies\n\nIntrauterine growth restriction\n\nRecurrent herpes outbreaks\n\nExperiencing symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, cramping, and pelvic pain\n\nExpecting twins, triplets, or other \"multiples\"\n\nJust because it's safe to have sex doesn't imply you'll want it. During the first trimester, you may feel too sick to even kiss your spouse, much alone indulge in any type of sexual activity.\n\nSome physicians advise avoiding sex during the final weeks as a precautionary measure because the prostaglandins in the sperm may promote contractions. Other experts say there is no link between the sperm and labor and having intercourse does not cause labor. Orgasm contractions are not the same as labor contractions. Thus, they are not a cause for alarm.\n\nIf you have significant bleeding after sex while pregnant or if you notice a leak in amniotic fluid, discomfort, or terrible cramping, call your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately.\n\nSummary\n\nSex is safe at any point during a low-risk pregnancy. Talk to your doctor before engaging in sexual activities to make sure that your pregnancy is not in a high-risk category. It’s normal for your sex drive to vary when you are pregnant, both increasing and decreasing through the pregnancy.\n\nMost women find their interest in sex is highest during the second trimester . Symptoms like nausea and exhaustion can make sex difficult in the first trimester. Increasing anxieties about the realities of having a baby can decrease your desire in the third trimester. You should always trust your body and only have sex when you feel like it. But keep in mind that there are many benefits to having sex during pregnancy.\n\nReferences\n\nSOURCES:\n\nMarch of Dimes: \"Sex During Pregnancy.\"\n\nNemours Children's Health System: \"Sex During Pregnancy.\"\n\nUniversity of California San Francisco: \"Sex During Pregnancy.\"\n\nSex during Pregnancy: Your Questions Answered https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sex-during-pregnancy-your-questions-answered/\n\nPregnancy, Relationships and sex https://healthtalk.org/pregnancy/relationships-and-sex\n\nSexual Intercourse and Orgasm during Late Pregnancy May Have a Protective Effect against Preterm Delivery https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2001/07/sexual-intercourse-and-orgasm-during-late-pregnancy-may-have-protective-effect\n\nSex during Pregnancy: What Works, What Doesn't https://www.healthywomen.org/your-health/pregnancy--postpartum/sex-during-pregnancy-what-works-what-doesnt\n\nSex during pregnancy https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/sex-during-pregnancy\n\nSex in pregnancy https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080531/\n\nTop 10 Amazing Benefits of Sex During Pregnancy Related Articles\n\n48 Reasons Why People Have Sex\n\nSince ancient times, the reasons people have sex have been assumed to be few and simple.
