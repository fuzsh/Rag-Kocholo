        "text": "BIPOC is an acronym that stands for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.\n\nBlack can refer to dark-skinned peoples of Africa, Oceania, and Australia or their descendants without regard for the lightness or darkness of skin tone and who were enslaved by white people. Indigenous, here, refers to ethnic groups native to the Americas, and who were killed en masse by white people. People of color is an umbrella term for non-white people, especially as they face racism and discrimination in a white dominant culture.\n\nA mental or physical condition that restricts an individual’s ability to engage in one or more major life activities (e.g. seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, communicating, sensing, breathing, performing manual tasks, learning, working, or caring for oneself). When discussing people with disabilities, it is important to use “person first” language that avoids defining an individual by their disability by placing the reference to a disability after the reference to a person (e.g. “a person with a disability,” rather than “a disabled person”).\n\nEquity is when everyone gets what they need in order to have access, opportunities, and a fair chance to succeed. Equity recognizes that the idea of equality (“the same for everyone”) may not address widespread disparities and individual circumstances where individualized solutions are necessary.\n\nA broad term referring to people who do not behave in a way that conforms to the traditional expectations of their gender or whose gender expression does not fit neatly into a category. Some gender-nonconforming individuals identify as a man or a woman, some identify as neither, and others identify as a mix of both.\n\nThe assumptions, stereotypes, and unintentional actions (positive or negative) we make towards others based on identity labels like race, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, or ability. Because our implicit associations are stored in our subconscious, we may act on our biases without even realizing it. Often, our implicit biases contradict our values.\n\nSupporting and embracing diversity in a way that clearly shows all individuals are valued, recognized, and accepted for who they truly are. This involves demonstrating respect for the abilities, beliefs, backgrounds, and cultures of those around you and engaging those with diverse perspectives, so that others feel an unconditional sense of belonging for who they are.\n\n\"Latine\" or \"Latinx\" refers to a person of Latin American origin or descent. It is used as a gender-neutral or non-binary alternative to Latino or Latina. The emergence of Latine or Latinx coincides with a global movement to introduce gender-neutral nouns and pronouns into many languages whose grammar has traditionally used male or female constructions. It is important to note that a recent Gallup poll found only 4% of Hispanic and Latino adults in the United States prefer the term Latinx to identify themselves primarily because Latinx does not fit into the conventional dynamic of the Spanish language. Identity and what people choose to be called is personal and can differ case by case – Latinx, Latine, Hispanic etc.\" The best term to use is best answered by the person or group of people you are referring to.\n\nThe process of putting or keeping someone (or a group of people) in a powerless position within a society by not giving them an active voice, identity, or place within it. Marginalization can show up in subtle or overt actions, such as using derogatory language, assuming someone’s accomplishments are not based on merit, and expecting individuals to act a certain way based on stereotypes.\n\nThe everyday slights, put-downs, and insults that marginalized people experience in their daily interactions. Microaggressions are often linked to our implicit biases, occur outside of our consciousness, and may be unintentional. Microaggressions may occur verbally (“you speak good English”) or nonverbally (clutching one’s purse more tightly when passing someone on the street) and can make people feel ashamed and dehumanized.\n\nDescribes a person who does not identify exclusively as a man or a woman. Non-binary people may identify as being both a man and a woman, somewhere in between, or as falling completely outside these categories. Also referred to as gender queer and gender variant.\n\nPronouns are how we refer to each other in everyday conversation when not using names, for example: \"This is Laura. She went to school with me.\" Preferred gender pronouns (or PGPs) are the pronouns that people ask others to use in reference to themselves. Because pronouns often express gender (his, hers), it is important to use the correct pronouns for people that align with their gender identity. Gendered pronouns include she and he, her and him, hers and his, and herself and himself. Gender neutral pronouns include they, them, their(s). Some people state their pronoun preferences as a form of allyship.\n\n\"People of color\" broadly identifies individuals who belong to a racial or ethnic minority group. When referring to a specific minority group, it is best to use more specific terms, such as Black or African American. The best term to use is best answered by the person or group of people you are referring to.\n\nA term people use to express fluid gender identities and sexual orientations. It is often used interchangeably with LGBTQIA+. The term has and can still be used in a derogatory context, but many LGBTQIA+ individuals have worked to positively reclaim the term.\n\nRefers to how an individual defines their emotional, physical, and/or romantic attractions. Categories of sexual orientation include, but are not limited to, gay and lesbian (attracted to some members of the same gender), bisexual (attracted to some members of more than one gender), and heterosexual (attracted to some members of another gender).\n\nAn oversimplified generalization about a group of people without regard for individual differences. Stereotypes often cause us to make assumptions (both negative and positive) about people based upon superficial characteristics. An example of a stereotype is any time you group individuals together based on an identity label and make a judgment about them without knowing them.\n\nOften abbreviated as \"trans.\" An umbrella term used to describe people whose true gender identity does not “match” the sex or gender they were assigned at birth. People who are transgender express themselves in many ways and do not necessarily need to alter their appearance in any way. When talking to or about someone who identifies as transgender, it is important to be respectful of how they identify and use their self-ascribed identity, name, and pronouns."
