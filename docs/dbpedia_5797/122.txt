When an individual is convicted of a sex crime, that person may be required to register with the state’s sex offender registry. Being labeled as a convicted sex offender carries with it numerous restrictions and requirements that can affect that person’s life for years to come (and perhaps permanently). Because of the high-stakes nature of sex crime cases, it’s essential for defendants to hire an experienced criminal defense attorney.

Rape

Rape is defined as unlawful intercourse perpetrated by one individual against another who has not given consent for the act. Rape includes sexual penetration that occurs by duress, force, or threats. For rape to have legally occurred, some form of penetration must have taken place. This includes penetration by foreign objects. The relationship between the perpetrator and the victim is not legally relevant. A spouse may commit rape against the other spouse, for example.

Statutory Rape

In some cases, a rape victim is considered to have been unable to give consent to the sexual act. One instance occurs when the rape victim is too young to legally give consent. The age of consent can vary from state to state. In Arizona, it’s 18 years of age. This means that a 19-year-old can be prosecuted for statutory rape after having intercourse with a 16-year-old. There are some exceptions to this rule. A criminal defense lawyer will thoroughly review the case to identify all possible defenses.

Indecent Exposure

It’s possible to be labeled as a sex offender without having committed rape or sexual assault. Indecent exposure is one such example. It is unlawful for a person to intentionally expose one’s genitals in public for the purpose of the sexual gratification of the offender or to entice a sexual response in others.
