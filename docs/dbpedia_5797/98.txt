For many people, sexual intercourse is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Cardiac patients often worry about their sexual health and their ability to engage in sexual activity. Concerns about sexual health can affect cardiac patients as well as their partners. These concerns can lead to anxiety, depression, and emotional distress.

Other factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction include:

Lack of physical activity

Smoking

Alcohol consumption

Lack of sleep

Poor diet

Stress

One of the most common concerns that those with heart disease and their partners have about sex is whether or not it is safe to engage in sexual activity.

As far as your heart is concerned, sex is equivalent to moderate exercise. If you are able to carry out physical activities, such as walking at a quick pace or walking up a few flights of stairs, it is safe to have sex. However, you should always consult with your doctor before engaging in any physical activities.

Despite their concerns, many patients do not feel comfortable speaking to their doctors about sexual activity. Your doctor can play an important role in determining when it is safe to resume sexual activity and to what extent. Your doctor understands that intimacy and sex are important aspects of your life and are accustomed to discussing these issues.

In addition to speaking to your doctor, communicating your concerns to your partner is just as important. Like other problems that may occur in a relationship, dealing with this issue together will help make the process easier.
