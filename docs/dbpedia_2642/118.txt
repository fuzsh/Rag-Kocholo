A "derivative work" is any song that is composed from another pre-existing song and uses the original lyrics or melody to create a new composition.

A derivative work is different from a cover.

A cover involves a new recording without modifications to the lyrics and melody of a pre-existing song, while a derivative work makes modifications to the lyrics and/or the melody or structure of the original song.

Examples of derivative works

You may not distribute a derivative work without the permission of the copyright holder of the pre-existing work. Unlike cover songs, the copyright holder can refuse permission to create a derivative work for any reason.

If a derivative work has been properly licensed with the permission of the publisher(s) or songwriter(s), you may distribute the song through Random Sounds as an original work with songwriter credits for the new song. This should reflect the license you have negotiated with the publisher(s) or composer(s) of the original work from which you created a derivative work.

A derivative work cannot be licensed through the covers licensing process.

The licensing providers we work with, Easy Song and Affordable Song Licensing, can license Derivative Works through their custom services. This is not the same licensing process as for a cover.
