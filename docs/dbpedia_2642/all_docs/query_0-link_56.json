        "text": "This Bear’s For You! (Or, Is It?)\n\nCan Companies Use Copyright and Trademark To Claim Rights to Public Domain Works?\n\nBy Jennifer Jenkins, Director of Duke’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain\n\nWhat Happens When the Same Characters Appear in Both Public Domain and Copyrighted Stories?\n\nCopyright and Derivative Works: We begin with the question of copyright and derivative works. While the original 1926 Winnie-the-Pooh book is open to all, Disney still has a copyright over the later Pooh books, movies, and other creative works. When the same characters appear in a series, some of which is public domain and some of which is still copyrighted, what exactly is still owned? Under copyright law, Disney only owns the newly added material in those works, not the underlying material from the 1926 book—that content remains freely available. To quote the Copyright Office primer on derivative works:\n\n“[I]t is not possible to extend the length of protection for a copyrighted work by creating a derivative work . . . the copyright in the derivative work will not extend to the public domain material, and the use of the public domain material in a derivative work will not prevent anyone else from using the same public domain work for another derivative work.”\n\nIn addition, Disney’s newer copyrights only extend to “original, creative expression.” Adding a “merely trivial” variation to an earlier work does not qualify. Quoting from the Copyright Office Compendium:\n\n“Miniscule [sic] variations do not satisfy this requirement, such as merely changing the size of the preexisting work. Merely recasting a work from one medium to another alone does not support a claim in derivative authorship. . . . Nor can the requirement of originality be satisfied simply by the demonstration of ‘physical skill’ or ‘special training.’”\n\n“It is a bedrock principle of copyright that once work enters the public domain it cannot be appropriated as private (intellectual) property, and even the most creative of legal theories cannot trump this tenet.” –Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate (N.D. Ill. 2013) aff’d (7th Cir. 2014)\n\nThese two points were illustrated by the Conan Doyle Estate Ltd.’s unsuccessful attempts to artificially extend the expired copyright over the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. First, the estate attempted to create a special “character copyright” end-run around the public domain. Leslie Klinger, a lawyer and Sherlock Holmes scholar, wanted to publish a collection of stories inspired by the public domain Holmes stories. The estate presented a bizarre legal theory that a “character is a work of authorship separate from the stories” so that the copyright term for characters does not commence until “the creation of the characters [is] complete.” This would have created a special copyright term for characters, which would remain copyrighted so long as their owners keep tweaking them in subsequent books, potentially forever. Because Sherlock Holmes’ character development continued in stories that are still under copyright, his entire character—including all of the core aspects fully developed in earlier public domain stories—would therefore remain copyrighted. In December 2013, a court firmly rejected this theory and confirmed that all of the story elements in the public domain Sherlock Holmes stories, including the Holmes and Watson characters, are “free for public use.” It explained: “Where an author has used the same character in a series of works, some of which are in the public domain, the public is free to copy story elements from the public domain works.” (This decision was later affirmed by the appeals court.)\n\nThis loss did not stop the Conan Doyle estate from bringing another lawsuit in 2020, this time against Netflix for its Enola Holmes movie. The estate presented yet another strange legal theory: it argued that Sherlocks Holmes only \"became capable of friendship\" and began to “express emotion” and “respect women” in the later, still-copyrighted stories, and objected to Netflix’s unlicensed use of those character traits. (Apparently, wokeness conveys extended copyright. Who knew?) Netflix explained in its legal filings that personality traits such as warmth, empathy, kindness, and respect are unprotectable ideas under copyright law. The parties agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and settled in December 2020.\n\nHow does all of this apply to Winnie-the-Pooh? First, anyone can use the characters in that 1926 book—Winnie-the-Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and others from the Hundred Acre Wood—in their own art, even though those characters also appear in later, still-copyrighted works. Your Pooh can be thoughtful and loyal to his friends and charmingly self-deprecating, constantly referring to himself as the “Bear of Very Little Brain” even when he is “Brave and Clever.” He can wander around composing and humming songs and have a major penchant for honey.\n\nSecond, Disney can only stop you from using new material from the later stories that is copyright-eligible. Sticking with the “Best Bear in All the World,” take a look at the old and new Pooh. Beyond the character traits summarized above, you can also copy the bear’s appearance in the original sketches by E. H. Shepard. Disney would likely claim that the bear on the right is a copyrightable “derivative work” because it is sufficiently distinct from the original. Let us concede that point for the sake of argument. That means Disney gets a copyright in the derivative character, precisely because it is different from the original. It is stouter, less worried, and it wears a red sweater. In other words, to get its own copyright, Disney has to agree that it is different from the one that goes into the public domain and is free for reuse. What’s more, just as the Conan Doyle estate cannot own mere ideas such as “respect for women,” Disney does not own the underlying idea and stock features of a cuddly anthropomorphic teddy bear who loves to eat. If any drawing of such a bear would necessarily have certain anatomical features and, applying standard techniques, simple black dots or arcs for the eyebrows, eye, nose, and mouth, then that material is uncopyrightable. Nor can Disney prevent you from putting a shirt on the E.H. Shepard bear—in fact, Shepard’s Pooh sometimes wears a shirt of sorts in the 1926 book. Its claim would be over the aggregate appearance of the bear on the right above together with story elements that only appeared in the later Pooh works.\n\nWhen Trademarks and Copyrights Overlap\n\nThe plot thickens when you add Disney’s trademark rights to the picture.\n\nFirst, some background. Copyrights and trademarks are different. Copyrights cover creative works and prevent people from copying and adapting them without permission, with the goal of providing economic incentives to create and distribute cultural products. The rights expire after a “limited time” so that the public and future creators can have unfettered access to those creative works.\n\nTrademarks cover words, logos, images, and other signifiers that serve as brands identifying the source of a product. The goal is to minimize consumer confusion in the marketplace—Nike can prevent other producers of athletic apparel from putting “Nike” or a swoosh on their merchandise so that when purchasers see those indicators they know they are getting a Nike product. Unlike copyrights, trademarks do not automatically expire. They can last as long as a mark is still being “used in commerce.” If Amazon goes on using the “Amazon” brand for 500 years, the trademark stays alive. If it goes out of business or stops using the “Amazon” name, however, that trademark lapses and others can use it. While trademarks can outlast copyrights, the rights themselves are more circumscribed. For most marks, trademark law only prevents the use of a mark on similar products when it is likely to create consumer confusion about the product’s origin or sponsorship. 3 Non-confusing uses are not prohibited, and there are a variety of legal safeguards for uses of trademarks in connection with expressive works.\n\n“We have been careful to caution against misuse or overextension of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by . . . copyright.” Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox (Supreme Court 2003)\n\nSometimes copyrights and trademarks overlap. 4 A character such as Mickey Mouse might be covered both by copyright law (as a creative work) and trademark law (as a logo if, when people see Mickey on a backpack or pajamas, they think it must be official Disney merchandise). While the copyright is active, Disney can keep people from making unauthorized uses of Mickey in new works (unless those uses qualify for “fair use” protection, as with a parody). While the trademark is in effect, Disney can keep people from slapping Mickey on luggage or apparel. But what happens when the copyright expires and the trademark is ongoing? In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court made clear that trademarks cannot be used to make an end run around copyright law because this would “create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public’s federal right to copy and to use expired copyrights.” 5 In other words, trademark rights cannot be used to block what the expiration of copyright allows, such as using a public domain character in a new creative work. Along the same lines, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explained that when a work enters the public domain “[w]e all own it now” and trademark law “cannot be used to circumvent copyright law. If material covered by copyright law has passed into the public domain, it cannot then be protected by the Lanham Act [the federal trademark statute] without rendering the Copyright Act a nullity.” 6\n\nNevertheless, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. and Zorro Productions, Inc. have tried to use trademark laws to try to control new works using public domain material from the Tarzan and John Carter works and the Zorro works. Burroughs was able to extract a joint licensing deal from the publisher of new “Lord of the Jungle” and “Warlord of Mars” comic books, while Zorro lost in court—because the Zorro story was in the public domain, a new “Queen of Swords” TV series about Zorro’s sword-wielding daughter could proceed. 7\n\nThis brings us to Winnie-the-Pooh. The copyright over the original book has expired. But Disney still retains trademark rights to use the words “Winnie the Pooh” on all sorts of products including books, movies, TV shows, video games, and a wide range of merchandise. And until recently they also had Federal trademark registrations over images of the Pooh characters. If you make your Winnie the Pooh sequel, can Disney use trademark law to interfere?\n\nLet’s begin with Disney’s trademark over the words “Winnie the Pooh.” As mentioned earlier, trademark law is all about preventing consumer confusion, so Disney might claim that consumers will think your new book or movie is a Disney-sponsored product. On the one hand, there are non-Disney versions of Snow White and Cinderella that people do not think emanate from Disney. Is “Winnie the Pooh” so closely associated with Disney that people would assume Disney is behind new productions? Either way, one way to dispel any claim of confusion is to add a disclaimer making it clear that your creation is not produced or sponsored by Disney. One court noted: “When a public domain work is copied, along with its title, there is little likelihood of confusion when even the most minimal steps are taken to distinguish the publisher of the original from that of the copy. The public is receiving just what it believes it is receiving—the work with which the title has become associated. The public is not only unharmed, it is unconfused.” 8\n\nEven without the disclaimer, putting “Winnie the Pooh” on toys or onesies is different from using “Winnie the Pooh” to describe the content of a new creative work. With the latter, First Amendment protection for freedom of expression comes into play and there are trademark defenses that allow you to use “Winnie the Pooh” in a title. A case called Rogers v. Grimaldi explains specifically that people are allowed to use trademarks in the title of an expressive work as long as the term has some artistic relevance to the new work and does not explicitly mislead as to the source of the work. (This is why when Mattel sues people for using “Barbie” in the titles of songs and photographs, they lose in court.) The policy underlying this rule is that trademark law should only apply to artistic works when the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression. Thus, the disclaimer should be unnecessary. But if you wish to put the matter beyond doubt, a disclaimer would do so.\n\nWhat about possible claims by Disney that your use of the images of the Pooh characters causes consumer confusion? Here it is important to distinguish between using the Pooh images as a brand identifier on the kind of merchandise Disney’s trademarks cover and using the images of Pooh in a reprinted book or a new movie or cartoon. In theory, even on a shirt or a lunchbox, if that image of a bear or donkey is merely decorative, as opposed to being a brand-indicator, then there is no trademark problem. But that inquiry is fact-specific. Easier simply to avoid something that could be seen as competing and branded merchandise. Using those original Shepard drawings in a comic book or animation is different—this is not the kind of use that misleads as to the source of a product. It is something that copyright expiration plainly allows. 9\n\nIntriguingly, Disney used to have Federal trademark registrations for the following images, but then it let them lapse by not filing the required paperwork indicating they were still being used. If they are no longer in use, then you can use them on merchandise, but it is not clear whether this is the case, and even without a Federal registration Disney could still bring a trademark claim based on an unregistered mark if it is still in use.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe original Winnie-the-Pooh book from 1926 is in the public domain. However, Disney still owns copyrights over later works, and trademark rights for “Winnie the Pooh” on a variety of products. Hopefully they will not follow the example of the Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan, or Zorro rights holders and try to use residual rights to prevent what copyright expiation allows. This could lead to unnecessary litigation, and even the threat of lawsuits could chill the creative reuse the public domain is designed to promote.\n\nIn fact, Disney’s own beloved works show just how valuable the public domain is. Many of its animated classics were remakes of public domain books and folk tales. Works from Alexandre Dumas, Charles Dickens, Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve, Jules Verne, Lewis Carroll, The Brothers Grimm, Victor Hugo, Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Anderson, Carlo Collodi, Mark Twain, English folklore, and The Book of One Thousand and One Nights fed Disney’s The Three Muskateers, A Christmas Carol, Beauty and the Beast, Around the World in 80 Days, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, Frozen and The Little Mermaid, Pinocchio, Huck Finn, Robin Hood, and Aladdin, to name a few. When it got into a dispute with the rightsholders of Bambi, Disney even filed an unsuccessful lawsuit claiming that the book had gone into the public domain much earlier. Let us hope that Disney remembers its own debt to the public domain when Pooh, and later the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse, enter the realm from which it has drawn so heavily!\n\nWritten by Jennifer Jenkins."
