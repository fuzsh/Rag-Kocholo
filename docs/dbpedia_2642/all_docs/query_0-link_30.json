        "text": "As the old saying goes: “There’s nothing new under the sun.” The natural evolution of society has shown that ideas get recycled and reused on a continuous basis. In fact, innovation, in part, is the practice of taking a current process, model, or product and adapting it to better meet the needs of consumers. Everyone is looking to craft the next best thing, whether they create it from scratch or create a new and improved version of something that already exists.\n\nAs detailed in my earlier article “Copyright, Trademark, Patent: Basics of Intellectual Property”, all of these ideas that are generated constitute intellectual property, which can and does receive certain levels of legal protection. When you have an original idea that is improved upon to make a “new version” it is called a derivative work (a work based upon one or more preexisting works). This new work, viewed as a new idea, receives its own level of intellectual property protection.\n\nSo, as the creator of intellectual property how do you ensure that someone, especially a third party that you hire, doesn’t use your idea as a springboard to create that next best thing while retaining all of the intellectual property rights associated with that derivative work?\n\nContracts, Contracts, Contracts.\n\nAs a very basic example, let’s say that you were the original creator of the wheel and you hired someone to create a mechanism that could utilize that wheel… Let’s call that new creation a bike. Once the bike is created there are intellectual property rights that attach to the wheel and intellectual property rights that attach to the bike. While you own the intellectual property rights that attach to the wheel, without having the appropriate language put in place, you do not solely own the intellectual property rights that have attached to the bike. At most, you could argue that you and the person you hired jointly own the intellectual property that is the bike. In either case, the person hired retains either a license to use and/or ownership in the derivative work that was created.\n\n1) Express Language Regarding Ownership of Derivative Works\n\nNow let’s say that you drafted a contract and included language that expressly stated that you solely retain any and all intellectual property rights to any derivative works created under that relationship. This completely changes the dynamics of the situation and creates a condition where the person hired automatically assigns to you all ownership rights in any derivative works. This ensures that you not only retain rights in the wheel, but that you also retain sole rights in the bike as well.\n\n2) No License for Continued Use by Third Party\n\nAnother issue that companies come across is that they don’t restrict further use by the hired person beyond the termination of the relationship. When you approach someone to create a mechanism that can use your wheel, you have granted that person a license to use that item in the creation of a derivative work. Once the relationship is terminated that person is no longer able to use the “wheel” but they are still able to use the bike (for commercial purposes or creation of derivative works based on the bike). So let’s also say that in your contract you included language that expressly stated that once the relationship is terminated the license to use the original work as well as any right to continue to use the derivative work is also terminated. This gives you greater protection and greater control over the market for not only the wheel, but also the bike.\n\n3) Restrict the Market for Derivative Works\n\nThe problem with derivative works is that they sometimes reduce the market for the original work. It stands to reason that your intent with creating the new mechanism (the bike) was not to reduce the market for selling your wheel. However, there are many instances in which businesses unintentionally create new competition as a result of relationships that develop derivative works. One of the ways to combat this is to have enough foresight to predict ways in which the derivative work could actually turn into a competing work and draft language in your contract to restrict the derivative work to markets that do not compete with the original work.\n\nThese are a few of the basic considerations for derivative works. When enlisting the services of a third party, agent, or employee to help create derivative works, make sure that you are keeping yourself and your intellectual property protected. As always, your safest bet is to seek the guidance of a qualified attorney."
