If the original book or picture, VCR is free, OR IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. anyone can do a scan;\n\nhowever, the scanned book has its own copyright. So, if I go to a public library and scan a rare book, I maintain the copyright of my scan, but of course anyone can go and make their own scan from the original as well.\n\nCopyright in the derivative workProvided it is significantly different to the original work the derivative work will be subject to copyright in its own right, and you will own copyright to the new content you have created as a result of your actions. Bear in mind that to be subject to copyright the creation of the derivative work must itself be an original work of skill, labour and judgement; minor alterations that do not substantially alter the original would not qualify.\n\nAny copyright in the original work remains unchanged; the creation of the derivative work gives no right to the original work being adapted. You cannot extend the duration of copyright in a work by creating a derivative work. If the original work is in the public domain, it will remain in the public domain; you cannot prevent anyone else using the same public domain work for their own purpos\n\nCopyright notices are generally helpful by stating to others the copyright status of the work and attributing ownership. In the case of derivative works it is often suitable (and can also be helpful) for the derivative work to show a copyright notice for the original material as well as for the new work."
