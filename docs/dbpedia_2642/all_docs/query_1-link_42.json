Online digital parody also creates some questions about copyright protection and the status of unauthorised online digital derivative works. In order to explore copyright protection given to unauthorised online digital derivative works, this chapter begins with a comparison of US and UK law. Then it will explore the interpretations of the Thai Supreme Court regarding originality and creativity and copyright protection granted to original and derivative works. This includes an analysis of the meaning of ‘author’ under the Thai Copyright Act. An appendix to the chapter concludes with an overview of the meaning of ‘author’ and the protection granted to unauthorised derivative works in the laws of some other Asian countries.",
