        "text": "The answer mostly depends on what kind of attribution you want. All popular licenses require copyright notices to be preserved, which means in practice that the author is acknowledged in the source code. If you want something like old BSD advertisement clause but with share-alike, I am not familiar with a license like that. Share-alike (also called copyleft) guarantees access to the source code, so attributions made there are more effective than in BSD-style licenses, where binary-only derivatives are permitted.\n\nModifying the GPL should follow the recommendation of the FSF, otherwise several distributors, including Debian, would consider your work undistributable. Supplementing the GPL with additional permissions is not subject to this rule.\n\nThe Apache license allows you to include a NOTICE file that all derivative works must include (but it's not copyleft, like the cc-by-sa). That could serve as your attribution.\n\nIf you want the derivative works to be distributed under the same license as the original, you can always modify your favorite copyleft license (GPL for most people) to require attribution, or just write your own license from scratch (look at the MIT or BSD licenses--they're both only a few paragraphs, and they get the job done)."
