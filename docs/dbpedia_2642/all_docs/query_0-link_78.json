        "text": "In the case of Oracle America v. Google, 872 F. Supp.2d 974 (N.D. Cal. 2012), the Northern District of California District Court examined the question of whether the application program interfaces (APIs) associated with the Java programming language are entitled to copyright protection. While the court expressly declined to rule whether all APIs are free to use without license (872 F. Supp.2d 974 at 1002), the court held that the command structure and taxonomy of the APIs were not protectable under copyright law."
