        "text": "What once started with a few hundred producers on sites like Soundclick and MySpace has now evolved into a massive music-licensing industry led by platforms such as BeatStars, Airbit, and Soundee.\n\nMusic production has never been easier and today‚Äôs resources make it possible for almost anyone to launch a website to sell beats from. Still, beat licensing is serious business.\n\nIn this guide, we will explain the concept of beat licensing and particularly focus on the differences between Exclusive and Non-Exclusive Licenses. The information provided in this guide will apply to both artists that are buying beat licenses, and producers selling beat licenses.\n\nSit back and relax! ‚òïÔ∏è By the end of this guide, you will know everything there is to know about online beat licensing.\n\nPart 1: Beat Licensing Explained\n\nThe concept of beat licensing is not hard to understand. A producer makes a beat and uploads it to their beat store. Any artist can buy these beats directly from the store and use them for their songs.\n\nIn exchange for their purchase, the producer will provide the artist with a license agreement. A document that grants the artist certain user rights to create and distribute a song.\n\nThis license agreement is legal proof that the producer has permitted them to use the beat.\n\nA common misconception is when artists ask producers for free beats. Even when a producer agrees and sends the artist a free beat. The truth is, that free beat is useless as there is no legal proof and permission to use it. This is where the license agreement comes in.\n\nBefore we go any further, we have to let go of the common phrases of ‚Äúbuying beats‚Äù and ‚Äúselling beats‚Äù. The product that we‚Äôre dealing with here is simply not the beat itself. It is the license agreement.\n\nNon-Exclusive Beat Licensing\n\nNon-exclusive licensing, also known as ‚Äòleasing‚Äô, is the most common form of beat licensing. For anywhere between $20-300, you can buy a non-exclusive license agreement and release a song on iTunes, Spotify, or Apple Music, create a music video for YouTube, and make money from it! üí∞\n\nThese are also the types of licenses that are directly available from the producer‚Äôs beat store. In other words, you don‚Äôt have to inquire for them and you can instantly buy a license from the online store.\n\nIn most cases, a license agreement is auto-generated, including the buyer‚Äôs name, address, a timestamp (Effective Date), user rights, and the information of the producer.\n\nWith a non-exclusive license, the producer grants the artist permission to use the beat to create a song of their own and distribute it online. The producer will still retain copyright ownership (more about this later) and the artist has to adhere to the rights granted in the agreement.\n\nThe Limitations of Non-Exclusive Licenses\n\nMost non-exclusive licenses have a limitation on sales, plays, streams or views. For example, the license might only allow a maximum number of 50,000 streams on Spotify and/or 100,000 views on YouTube.\n\nA non-exclusive license also has an expiration date. Meaning that it‚Äôs only going to be valid for a set period of time. This could be anywhere between 1-10 years. After the contract period is due, the buyer has to renew the license. In other words, buy a new one.\n\nThe license will also need to be renewed as soon as the buyer reached the maximum amount of streams and/or plays. Even if that‚Äôs before the contract‚Äôs expiration date (!)\n\nSince these licenses are non-exclusive, a single beat can be licensed to an unlimited number of different artists. This means that several artists could be using the same beat for a different song under similar license terms.\n\nWhether this is a problem depends entirely on what stage the artist is in. A beginner artist would be best off with a non-exclusive license, while a signed artist or an artist that is on the verge of blowing up might be better off with an exclusive license.\n\nThe different types of Non-Exclusive Licenses\n\nMost producers offer different non-exclusive licensing options. In my case, I offer an MP3, WAV, Premium, and Unlimited License.\n\nEvery option comes with its unique user rights. These user rights are often displayed in licensing tables, similar to this.\n\nThe more expensive the license, the more user rights you‚Äôre getting. These more expensive licenses also come with better quality audio files.\n\nIn my case, the second-highest tier, the Premium license, is the most popular. That‚Äôs simply because you get the best audio quality, tracked-out files of the beat, and good user rights.\n\nArtists who believe these rights still aren‚Äôt sufficient for their song, usually go for the highest tier. The Unlimited license. Or even better, an Exclusive license.\n\nExclusive Beat Licensing\n\nWhen you own the Exclusive Rights to a beat, there are no limitations on user rights. Meaning that an artist can exploit the song to the fullest.\n\nThere is no maximum number of streams, plays, sales, or downloads nor is there an expiration date on the contract.\n\nThe song may also be used in numerous different projects. Singles, albums, music videos, etc. In comparison to non-exclusive licenses, which are usually limited for use in a single project only.\n\nIn the case of buying the exclusive rights to a beat that was previously (non-exclusively) licensed to other artists, the artist that purchased the exclusive rights is typically the last person to purchase it. After a beat is sold exclusively, the producer is no longer allowed to sell or license the beat to others.\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean the previous non-exclusive licensees will be affected by this. Every exclusive contract should have a section with a ‚Äúnotice of outstanding clients‚Äù included.\n\nThis section protects these previous licensees from getting a strike by the exclusive buyer.\n\nThese are the main differences between non-exclusive licenses and exclusive licenses. But it goes further than that and there‚Äôs often confusion around the topics of rights and royalties.\n\nGoing forward in this guide, we will go more in-depth about Royalties, Publishing, and Copyright.\n\nTwo very different ways of selling Exclusive Rights\n\nFor many years, producers had different ways of selling exclusive rights. Luckily, in more recent years, contracts are becoming more streamlined and matching the industry standard.\n\nStill, I want to address two very different ways of selling exclusive rights.\n\nSelling exclusive rights\n\nSelling exclusive ownership\n\nBy selling exclusive rights, the producer remains the original author of the music. And is still able to collect writers' share and publishing rights. (again, more about this later)\n\nBy selling exclusive ownership, the producer sells the beat including all interest, authorship, copyright, etc. These deals are also known as ‚Äòwork-for-hire‚Äô. The artist retains actual ownership over the beat and will‚Äìfrom that point on‚Äìbe considered as the legal author of the beat.\n\nWithin the beat licensing industry, selling exclusive ownership is wrong, unethical, and‚Äìin most cases‚Äìnot compliant with Copyright Law.\n\nIt‚Äôs only right to come to an agreement where both the artist and producer are credited for their work; Legally, financially and commercially.\n\nPart 2: Everything you need to know about Royalties, Writers Share, and Publishing Rights\n\nThis is the part that most people struggle to understand. Mainly, because there are lots of different deal structures in the music industry. No worries! üòâ By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll know everything you need to know.\n\nLet‚Äôs break things down step-by-step and solely in regards to online beat licensing.\n\nBefore we jump into this next section, we need to get a better understanding of two types of royalties first.\n\nMechanical Royalties\n\nPerformance Royalties\n\nMechanical Royalties\n\nMechanical royalties are generated when music is physically or digitally reproduced or distributed. This applies to hard copy sales, digital sales (e.g. iTunes), and streams (e.g. Spotify).\n\nPerformance Royalties\n\nPerformance royalties are generated when a song is performed publicly. This applies to when music is played on the radio, performed live or streamed for example.\n\nWho gets the Mechanical Royalties?\n\nIn most cases, the artist is allowed to keep 100% of the mechanical royalties in exchange for the price they pay for the license. Regardless of whether the license is non-exclusive or exclusive.\n\nThese days, distribution services like TuneCore, CDBaby, or DistroKid pay these mechanical royalties directly to the artist. That is if the artist works independently.\n\nWhen an artist is signed to a label, the label usually collects the mechanical royalties and might choose to pay (a percentage of) it to the artist.\n\nAdvances against Mechanical Royalties in Exclusive Agreements\n\nI intentionally said that ‚Äúin most cases‚Äù the artist gets to collect 100% of the mechanical rights because this does not always apply. There‚Äôs an exception to this, which only applies to exclusive rights.\n\nSome producers (including myself) ask for a tiny percentage of the Mechanical Royalties in their exclusive agreements. This could be anywhere between 1-10%.\n\nThis is also known as ‚Äòpoints‚Äô or ‚Äòproducer royalties‚Äô.\n\nIn this scenario, the price an artist pays for the exclusive rights is considered an ‚Äúadvance against mechanical royalties‚Äù that might become due in the future. It will be calculated over the Net Profit of a song. Meaning that all costs to create the song, including the exclusive price may be deducted first before the producer gets his cut.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example to show you how this could potentially play out in a real-life situation.\n\nLet‚Äôs say a producer sells the exclusive rights to a beat for $1,000 as an advance against royalties. His mechanical royalty rate is set to 3%.\n\nThe artist paid:\n\n$1,000 for exclusive rights\n\n$500 for studio time\n\n$500 for getting the song mixed and mastered\n\nTotal expenses = $2,000\n\nAfter 1 year, the song generated $10,000 in Mechanical Royalties!\n\nThe Net Profit: $10,000 - $2,000 expenses = $8,000 üí∞\n\nThe Producer‚Äôs Cut: 3% of $8,000 = $240\n\nAs an independent artist, $8,000 is a lot of money to generate on Mechanical Royalties. Still, only $240 has to be paid to the producer.\n\nWhy an Advance against Royalties?\n\nIt seems pointless, however, there‚Äôs a reason why some producers (including me) prefer selling exclusive rights with an advance against royalties.\n\nA few years back, I could easily sell exclusive rights for anywhere between $2,000 - $10,000. (The Good Ol‚Äô Days! ü§†)\n\nThese days, it‚Äôs considered ‚Äònormal‚Äô to sell exclusive rights for less than $1,000. With all the competition and the beat market becoming more saturated, the prices have dropped and it has become harder to close 4 or 5-figure exclusive deals.\n\nBut what if the song blows up!?\n\nWhat if a song starts generating millions of dollars and you sold the exclusive rights to that beat for less than $1,000?\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt sound like a fair deal, does it?\n\nAn advance against royalties can offer the solution. It‚Äôs insurance for the producer just in case the song blows up. It‚Äôs also something the artist only has to worry about as soon as the song starts generating serious revenue. And even still, it‚Äôs only 3%. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nWho collects the Performance Royalties?\n\nPerformance royalties are collected and paid out by Performing Rights Organisations (PROs), such as ASCAP or BMI in the US or PRS in the UK.\n\n(Every country has its organization, check which one is yours)\n\nThese royalties are divided into two parts:\n\nSongwriter Royalties (A.k.a. Writer‚Äôs Share)\n\nPublishing Royalties\n\nThe PROs collect both of these royalties and divide them into two groups.\n\nFor every $1 earned on Performance Royalties:\n\n$0.50 goes to Songwriter Royalties\n\n$0.50 goes to Publishing Royalties.\n\nThe $0.50 Songwriter Royalties will be paid out to the songwriters directly by the PRO.\n\nThe other $0.50 publishing royalties will be paid out to a publishing company or publishing administrator. (more about this later).\n\nWhat are songwriter royalties?\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs break down the Songwriter Royalties.\n\nThe songwriter royalties, also known as the ‚ÄòWriter‚Äôs share‚Äô will always be paid out to the credited songwriters. This is the part that can not be sold through an exclusive license, other than a work-for-hire agreement.\n\nAs I said before, this is wrong in the industry of licensing beats online.\n\nIn case you‚Äôre getting confused; In copyright law, a producer is considered a ‚Äòsongwriter‚Äô too. ü§ì\n\nSongwriter royalties apply to anyone who has creative input in a song. Producers, songwriters (lyricists), and sometimes even engineers.\n\nGenerally, non-exclusive beat licenses are sold with 50% publishing and writers share. This is usually not negotiable since the music part is the producers‚Äô contribution to your song and is considered half of the song. The lyrics are considered the other half.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter if there happen to be multiple songwriters that contributed to the lyrics. In that case, this 50% should be divided between them.\n\nExample Non-Exclusive beat licenses:\n\n50% Producer\n\n25% Writer 1\n\n25% Writer 2\n\nAs part of an exclusive rights deal, a different split between all creators could be negotiated. It all depends on the price and flexibility of the producer.\n\nWhile I generally stick to my 50%, some producers sometimes agree to the following example split.\n\nExample Exclusive Licenses:\n\n30% Producer\n\n35% Writer 1\n\n35% Writer 2\n\nWhat are Publishing Royalties?\n\nUnlike Songwriter royalties, Publishing can be assigned to outside entities called publishing companies. Most independent artist and producers will most likely not have a publishing deal, which means they‚Äôll have to collect the publishing royalties themselves.\n\nSurprisingly, a lot of money is left on the table here. If you‚Äôre an independent artist or producer who is only signed up with a PRO and not with a Publishing Administrator, half of what you‚Äôve earned is still waiting for you to collect.\n\nIn terms of licensing beats online‚Äìregardless of an exclusive or non-exclusive license‚Äìthe percentage of publishing rights is generally the equivalent of the writer's share.\n\n50% of writers' share equals 50% publishing share.\n\nPart 3: The Copyright Situation...Who owns what?\n\nThis is a tricky topic and it goes way further than I can explain here. If you want to know the ins and outs concerning copyright, I suggest you dive deeper into Copyright Law using our good friend Google or consulting an actual attorney.\n\nAgain, going forward, I‚Äôll explain about copyright solely in regards to licensing beats online. We‚Äôre going to dismantle a song to its creators and copyright holders, hopefully making it clear to you who owns what.\n\nPerforming Arts Copyright (PA-Copyright)\n\nLet‚Äôs say you‚Äôre an artist and you went to search for beats on YouTube. You find one that you like and you head over to the producer's website. You buy a license for that beat, write lyrics, create a song and distribute it through CDBaby, TuneCore or DistroKid.\n\nThat song contains two copyrighted elements:\n\nThe Music\n\nThe Lyrics\n\nThe producer owns the copyright to the music and you own the copyright to the lyrics.\n\nRegardless of whether you‚Äôve bought an Exclusive License or Non-Exclusive license. The producer will always own the copyright to the music and the artist will always own the copyright to the lyrics (unless it‚Äôs written by someone else other than the artist).\n\nThis is what we call Performing Arts Copyright (PA-Copyright).\n\nOn a side note: Many believe that you have to register the music or the lyrics with the U.S. Copyright Office yet, in fact, the instant you write something on paper, make a beat in your DAW, or save a demo song to your hard drive, it‚Äôs copyrighted!\n\nSure, there are benefits to properly registering with the U.S. Copyright Office but, failure to do so doesn‚Äôt mean you will lose ownership over your creation.\n\nSound Recording Copyright (SR-Copyright)\n\nBack to that song you made. Together with the producer, you‚Äôve created a new song. In legal terms, this is often referred to as the ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù or ‚ÄúSound Recording‚Äù.\n\nNow, this is where things can confuse because the difference between an Exclusive or Non-Exclusive license plays a huge role here.\n\nAs an artist, buying beats from a producer:\n\nIf you have exclusively licensed a beat, you do own the master and sound recording rights.\n\nIf you have non-exclusively licensed a beat, you do not own the master and sound recording rights.\n\nIn an exclusive license, the Master rights will be transferred to the client (artist) and it will become their sole property, free from any claims from the Producer.\n\nThe only exception here is the producer‚Äôs right to jointly claim the copyright of the so-called ‚Äòunderlying musical composition‚Äô. This is what we referred to earlier as the PA-Copyright. The producer is and always will be the original creator of the music.\n\nWith a non-exclusive license, the client does not own the master or sound recording rights in the song. They‚Äôve been licensed the right to use the beat and to commercially exploit the song based on the terms and conditions of the non-exclusive agreement. Yet again, they do own the PA Copyright of the lyrics.\n\nInstead, what they‚Äôve created is called a Derivative Work.\n\nWhat‚Äôs a Derivative Work?\n\nIn regards to beat licensing, a derivative work is a combination of an original copyrighted work (the beat) in combination with someone else's original work (the lyrics).\n\nDerivative works are very common in the music industry and you probably come across them on a daily basis.\n\nExamples are:\n\nRemixes\n\nTranslations (A Spanish version of an English song)\n\nParodies\n\nMovies based on books (Harry Potter)\n\nThese are all so-called ‚Äònew versions‚Äô, created using preexisting copyrighted material.\n\nIn terms of beat licensing, a non-exclusive agreement authorizes an artist to create such a ‚Äònew version‚Äô, using the producer's copyrighted material.\n\nThe only person that is able to authorize a derivative work is the owner of the underlying composition itself. In this case, the producer.\n\nWhen someone licenses a beat on a non-exclusive basis, they‚Äôre specifically given the right to create a Derivative Work.\n\nBeats that contain third-party samples\n\nPretty straightforward up till now, right? Well, I need you to pay close attention now because this is where things often go wrong‚Ä¶\n\nA common misconception when producers are selling beats with samples is thinking they can turn the responsibility of ‚Äòclearing the sample‚Äô over to the artists that license the beat.\n\nI guess somewhere, sometime, someone made a statement about this which is‚Ä¶ Entirely FALSE!\n\nThis is make-believe and it couldn‚Äôt be more wrong! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nPlease view the image below for context‚Ä¶\n\nIn the image above, there are two different versions derived from the original sample. (Version AB and Version ABC)\n\nSince both these versions are considered New Work and both contain that original sample‚ÄìClearance for Version AB does not account for Version ABC.\n\nBoth the Producer and the Artist are required to clear the first sample! Because in this scenario, there are 3 different copyright owners to a song.\n\nEverything falls and stands with clearing the original sample.\n\nThis is going to get hard as soon as multiple artists license the same beat and create their songs with it. After a while, there could be a whole lot of Versions ABC deriving from it.\n\nExactly why I stay away from using samples‚Ä¶ üòä\n\nExclusive or Non-Exclusive, what is best for you?\n\nBy now, we‚Äôve covered all the differences between non-exclusive and exclusive licenses. But, if you‚Äôre an artist, you might still wonder which option is the best for you.\n\nBesides the difference in price‚Äìin every way‚Äìan exclusive license is the better option. No doubt! üíØ\n\nHowever, this is not a necessity for everyone. Most artists are better off with a non-exclusive license.\n\nLet‚Äôs have an honest view of your current situation‚Ä¶\n\nHow many followers and fans do you have?\n\nHow many songs have you released to date?\n\nWhat is the number of plays/streams you get on average? (all platforms combined)\n\nHow big is your marketing budget?\n\nAre you getting financial support from a label or publisher?\n\nAsk yourself; What would be the best option for the artist you are TODAY?\n\nYou see, most artists are simply not ready to buy exclusive rights yet. And there‚Äôs no shame in that at all.\n\nif you‚Äôre a young artist working on a mixtape or first album to get your name out there. Why would you spend that much money on exclusive rights if you‚Äôre not even sure if the record is going to get big?\n\nThe wise(r) investment would be to get one of the higher-tier non-exclusive licenses. Preferably, the Unlimited Licenses.\n\nThis allows you to spend less, buy more licenses, release more music, and gradually build your fanbase until you‚Äôre ready to take that next step.\n\nA summary of the differences between Exclusive and Non-Exclusive Licenses\n\nIn the image below you‚Äôll find a summary and comparison between Non-Exclusive and Exclusive Beat Licensing. Please note that the Non-Exclusive ‚ÄòSales‚Äô and ‚ÄòStreams‚Äô limit does not apply to the ‚ÄúUnlimited‚Äù licenses.\n\nBefore we go into Part 4‚Ä¶.\n\nI know the world of buying and selling beats online can be confusing at times as I‚Äôve noticed this firsthand from working with artists and producers daily.\n\nHeck, I‚Äôve read dozens of books myself to understand things fully! üòÖ\n\nStill, I appreciate you for making it this far in the guide and I sincerely hope you‚Äôve learned a thing or two‚Ä¶ Feel free to refer back to this whenever you find yourself struggling with anything related to the topic.\n\nI want to give a special thanks to the producers in our Facebook Group ‚ÄúThe Art of Selling Beats‚Äù as well as the students of our Constant Conversion Strategy Masterclass.\n\nThey‚Äôve helped shape this guide to what it is now by providing feedback and letting us know where they‚Äôre struggling with the most.\n\nIf you have a second, drop a comment below and share your thoughts. Good or bad, it‚Äôs all appreciated! üôèüèΩ\n\nPart 4: FAQ About Beat Licensing\n\nWe continue to update this guide to provide the answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning beat licensing.\n\nI want to license a beat that is already sold by the producer. Can I reach out to the exclusive purchaser so they can sell me a license?\n\nNo, that‚Äôs not an option. A common mistake made by artists that are (desperately) trying to license an already sold beat is, thinking they can locate the buyer and buy it from them.\n\nEvery exclusive contract states that the beat cannot be resold or licensed to a third party in its original form if it‚Äôs not overlayed with lyrics. If they would, that would be a breach of the exclusive agreement.\n\nSomeone wants to buy a beat I already sold and asks if I can create a similar one. Can I?\n\nIn this case, we‚Äôll have to define the word ‚Äòsimilar‚Äô. If that means re-using parts of the sold beat or replicating melodies you used in that beat, then NO. You‚Äôre basically ‚Äòsampling‚Äô a beat that you‚Äôve already sold. In a way, you‚Äôre creating a derivative work that you‚Äôre no longer allowed to do.\n\nBut if that means using a similar song structure. Or similar instruments, yet different chords and melodies, then YES. It‚Äôs possible to do that.\n\nI recently bought a non-exclusive license for a beat. Now someone else bought it exclusively. What happens to my song?\n\nNothing! :) Your license will be in effect for the length of the agreement or until you‚Äôve reached the maximum number of streams and/or plays. (Check your license agreement)\n\nYour non-exclusive license agreement should include an ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù (the day you bought the license) and an ‚ÄúExpiration Date‚Äù (This could also be a period after which your license will expire. E.g. 5 years).\n\nWithin the Exclusive contract with the buyer, a so-called ‚Äúnotice of outstanding clients‚Äù will protect you from the exclusive buyer to strike you.\n\nMy non-exclusive license is reaching its streaming limit but I can‚Äôt buy a new license because the beat is already sold exclusively. Do I have to take the song down now?\n\nIf your non-exclusive license is reaching its streaming limits and extending the license is not an option, then yes‚Äì‚Äìlegally, you will have to take the song down. How unfortunate that might be.\n\nThis is the exact reason why the Unlimited Licenses are such a great option, considering they have no streaming cap. All though it‚Äôs more expensive, it does avoid (awkward) situations like these.\n\nSomeone released a song with one of my beats but didn‚Äôt get a license? What‚Äôs the best course of action?\n\nUnfortunately, this happens a lot if you‚Äôre a producer promoting beats online. Luckily, there are different ways to go about this. The first step is to reach out to the artist(s) and notify them about the unauthorized use of the beat.\n\nThen, offer them 2 options.\n\nEither buy a license so they can keep the song online\n\nOr remove the song entirely from all platforms it‚Äôs published on\n\nIn the best-case scenario, they adhere to your request. But what if they don‚Äôt?\n\nIn that case, you have two options.\n\nLeave it be\n\nFile for a DMCA takedown (click the link for more info)\n\nIf the song isn‚Äôt gaining numbers and is of very poor quality (which is usually the case when beats are used unauthorized), it might be best to leave it be. It‚Äôs not worth your time and money.\n\nThe alternative, filing for a DMCA takedown will cost you some money. I would only consider this if the song is gaining serious numbers (1000s of views or streams on any platform).\n\nI created a beat with another producer. How do we split the publishing and songwriters share?\n\nCollaboration splits are very common these days, yet there‚Äôs no quick answer to this question. It all depends on what terms you‚Äôre collaborating on.\n\nIf you‚Äôre collaborating with a producer and you upload that beat to your beat store, the most common split would be 50/50. That goes for sales, publishing, and songwriter share.\n\nWhen the beat is sold or licensed to an artist, they‚Äôre usually granted 50% of the publishing and writers share the song they make. The exact numbers might be different as it depends on the contract terms the producer offers."
