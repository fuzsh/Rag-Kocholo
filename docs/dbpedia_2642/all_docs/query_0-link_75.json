In addition, you can find the specific license or terms of permitted use for each resource.\n\nWatch for the license symbols listed below.\n\nNo Strings Attached\n\nNo restrictions on your remixing, redistributing or making derivative works. Give credit to the author, as required. Includes Public Domain, Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY), Creative Commons Public Domain, and any item that explicitly says no restrictions.\n\nPublic Domain\n\nWorks in the public domain are those whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable. This license allows you to distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon public work, as long as you credit the original creator.\n\nAttribution\n\nCC BY\n\nThis license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.\n\nView License Deed | View Legal Code\n\nRemix and Share\n\nYour remixing, redistributing, or making derivatives works comes with some restrictions, including how it is shared. Includes Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike (CC BY-SA), Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial Share Alike (CC BY-NC-SA), Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial (CC BY-NC), GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), WGBH Teachers' Domain remix.\n\nAttribution-ShareAlike\n\nCC BY-SA\n\nThis license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.\n\nView License Deed | View Legal Code\n\nAttribution-NonCommercial\n\nCC BY-NC\n\nThis license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.\n\nView License Deed | View Legal Code\n\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n\nCC BY-NC-SA\n\nThis license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.\n\nView License Deed | View Legal Code\n\nShare Only\n\nYour redistributing comes with some restrictions. Do not remix or make derivative works. Includes Creative Commons No Derivatives (CC ND), WGBH Teachers' Domain share.\n\nAttribution-NoDerivs\n\nCC BY-ND\n\nThis license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.\n\nView License Deed | View Legal Code\n\nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs\n\nCC BY-NC-ND\n\nThis license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.\n\nView License Deed | View Legal Code\n\nRead the Fine Print\n\nIf a lesson plan or activity is not clearly tagged or marked as being in the public domain or having an open license, it is not an open educational resource. In some instances a resource specifies:\n\nConditions of Use: Read the Fine Print\n\nClick the View Resource button and look for any disclaimer and policies on the copyright and usage of those materials.
