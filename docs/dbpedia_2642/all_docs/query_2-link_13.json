        "text": "What is derivative work?\n\nDerivative works are the new works âderivedâ or inspired by existing copyrighted work. Such works involve making subtle changes and additions to the pre-existing original content.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nAn author creates original material, which often serves as a creative inspiration for many people to develop their own creations.\n\nSometimes, you will find your creative motivation from other authorâs work.\n\nAnd sometimes, you can be an inspiration for someone elseâs story.\n\nOr you would want to augment an existing story or finish an unfinished storyline, or even expand a characterâs storyline to another nuance and explore a new shade.\n\nSometimes, your creation itself will inspire you to come up with a sequel! The cessations are endless!\n\nAll these creations will heavily depend on who owns the copyright.\n\nAdapting a new work from an already existing copyrighted work might trigger an infringement or violation of exclusive rights granted by copyright. According to copyright law, this type of work is called derivative works.\n\nDerivative works definition\n\nA derivative work is a work based on or âderivedâ from one or more already existing work.\n\nFamiliar derivative works include adaptations, translations (one language to another), musical arrangements, movies/tv-shows made from written work, reproducing art or plays, and condensations of pre-existing works.\n\nTo be copyrightable and qualified as a derivative work, it should include some original material of authorship. This means works with minor edits or changes, or copying the entire original material as a whole wonât qualify as a derivative work.\n\nAlso, the derivative work should contain a significant amount of original material. This amount depends on the average person being able to identify that the derivative work has been an adaptation of another original creation.\n\nWhat are the different types of derivative work?\n\nHere are different types of derivative work:\n\nA novel converted into a screenplay or adaptation\n\nA lithograph based on a painting\n\nA novel translated from one language to another\n\nA drawing or sculpture based on a photograph\n\nA traditional folk song converted with a new music arrangement.\n\nA public domain novel transformed into an illustrated version.\n\nDerivative work example: Art Rogers and Roger Koons\n\nHereâs a complete derivative-work example to understand derivative works better.\n\nArt Rogers once clicked a photo of two owners holding their puppies. The image was sold as merchandise such as greeting cards and postcards.\n\nThe photograph inspired the artist Roger Koons. He removed the copyright notice from the card and instructed Italian artisans to recreate Art Rogersâs photo as sculptures.\n\nRogers sued Koonsâs work. The court decided that the sculpture was an infringing derivative work. The image and the sculpture was too similar: the court decided to go Rogersâ way.\n\nKoons did minor changes, like adding flowers and coloring the puppies coat blue. It was not enough to save him from infringement.\n\nAnother simple example is â you canât just convert text from public domain to digital format to create a derivative work.\n\nHowever, add your work to it â like links, images, videos, etc. â to the public domain work will help create a derivative work.\n\nTo put in simple words, you just canât make minor changes to original work and pass it off as a derivative work. There needs to be some originality â some form of your own work â with substantial amounts of actual work for the material to pass as a derivative work.\n\nDo you require permission to create a derivative work?\n\nAccording to copyright law, the original author of the work has the power to reproduce and distribute his copyrighted work.\n\nHe also has the power to authorize someone else to create a derivative work based on his original work.\n\nHowever, if you are making use of copyrighted work without proper permission, then your work will constitute copyright infringement. Working with copyrighted work requires appropriate permissions.\n\nWhereas there are instances that do not require any permissions.\n\nThese are:\n\nYour own copyrighted work: Here, you are the author of your original work. As stated above, the copyright law grants you the power to recreate, reproduce, and distribute your original work. However, if you give permission to someone else to create a derivative work, you are prevented from making a derivative work of your own material.\n\nThe public domain: If you are making use of work from the public domain, then you do not need any permission to create a derivative work.\n\nFair use: If your work falls under the fair use category, then you do not need any permission. Fair use allows the use of copyrighted work for purposes like criticism, parody or satire, research or study, and news reporting.\n\nWho owns a derivative work?\n\nAccording to copyright law, the original workâs author has the sole right to create a derivative work.\n\nHowever, if the author grants the necessary permission to create a derivative work, the original workâs owner will not have any rights on the derivative works copyright.\n\nAfter the copyright owner grants permission to create a derivative work, the grant cannot be changed or ceased by the original workâs owner.\n\nThe derivative work owner will hold all the copyright rights to his derivative work. It include the rights to recreate, transfer, and grant permission to use his derivative work.\n\nNote that the derivative-work owner will not hold any rights on the original work.\n\nWhat gets copyrighted in a derivative work?\n\nThe copyright in the derivative work only covers the new additions, changes to the original work, or anything that is appearing for the first time in the work.\n\nIf a derivative work is created using public domain material, then only the derived work is copyright protected. The protection does not extend to the already existing work.\n\nTherefore, when a derivative work is copyrighted is derived from public domain material, that does not mean other people cannot use that public domain work. So, the public domain work will remain in the same medium and will not prevent anyone else from making use of the work to create another derivative work. Copyright in a compilation and collective works extends only to the selection, coordination, and arrangement of the material.\n\nAlso, copyrighting your derivative work will not extend the duration of the copyright on the pre-existing material.\n\nHow to register a derivative work?\n\nRegistering a derivative work involves providing information about the copyrighted material used, the necessary permissions, the year in which the new work was created, and a description of the derivative work.\n\nThe bottom line about derivative work\n\nYou are ready to prepare your derivative work, provided that you are up-to-speed with how things operate.\n\nUsing copyrighted material will require you to get the necessary permissions, unless the material comes from the public domain works.\n\nAnd once created, you can copyright your derivative work!"
