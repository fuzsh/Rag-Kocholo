        "text": "C\n\nCreative Commons\n\nA type of copyright license a copyright holder uses to defines the limits and terms of acceptable uses of their content, which would otherwise be an infringement of their copyrights. (See the Creative Commons page for more information.)\n\nCopyright status\n\nCopyright status refers to defining the status of a given work, for example, the work could be in the Public Domain, it could be licensed as All Rights Reserved, it could be licensed with a Creative Commons license, or it could be under the status of an orphan work. This list is not exhaustive; it only provides examples of different types of copyright status.\n\nCopyright term limits\n\nCopyright term limits are complicated, see Peter B. Hirtle’s chart for the latest information on copyright term limits as defined by the specific characteristics of a work, such as first publication date, place of publication, copyright renewals, etc.\n\nCopyright notice\n\nThe copyright notice, “©,” is a requirement of a work to be officially copyrighted in the U.S. before March 1, 1989. When the U.S joined the Berne Convention this practice was no longer a requirement of U.S law. However, it is still a highly suggested and recommended practice.\n\nCopyright holder, copyright owner\n\n“Copyright owner,” with respect to any one of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, refers to the owner of that particular right. This could be the original author/creator or in some cases, such as a work for hire, the person who by reason of contract has attained the copyright to the work.\n\nCreated\n\nA work is “created” when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time; where a work is prepared over a period of time, the portion of it that has been fixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time, and where the work has been prepared in different versions, each version constitutes a separate work.\n\nFair Use\n\nFair use is a limitation on the exclusive rights of a copyright holder. These limitations are defined in U.S law, see 17 U.S. C § 107-122. The Fair Use Checklist provides guidance on making an informed analysis of a proposed use of a copyrighted work to help determine if the use would weigh in favor of fair use or be an infringement. (See Fair Use & TEACH Act page for more information.)\n\nFixed\n\n“Fixed” – a work is “fixed” in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration. A work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being transmitted, is “fixed” for purposes of this title if a fixation of the work is being made simultaneously with its transmission."
