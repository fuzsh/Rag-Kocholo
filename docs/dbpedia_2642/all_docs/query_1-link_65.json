DMCCA 2024, s 251 (which is not yet in force) will revoke the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPUTR 2008), SI 2008/1277, which affects this Checklist. Once revoked, the provisions presently contained in the CPUTR 2008 will be replaced by Part 4 of DMCCA 2024 (which largely replicates the requirements of the CPUTR 2008). This Checklist will be updated for this change in due course. For a detailed comparison of the CPUTR 2008 and Part 4 of DMCCA 2024, see Practice Note: The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024—key provisions from a consumer protection perspective.

In broad terms, ‘open data’ is data that is made publicly available in open, machine-readable format on licence terms that allow users to use and exploit the data on a royalty-free basis. There is no single, universally accepted definition of open data. One example is the Open Definition 2.1 published by Open Knowledge Foundation. This definition of open data is detailed, specific and intended to encourage the widest possible use. Key aspects of the Open Definition are: • the data should be provided at no more than a reasonable one-time reproduction cost • the data should be provided without any restrictions on its use and it must be possible to process the data using at least one open source, free or ‘libre’ software tool • the licence accompanying the data must satisfy certain conditions. Broadly, the licence must allow use of the data for any purpose and the field of use should not be restricted. The licence must allow distribution and modification of the...\n\nFree and open source software\n\nFree and open source software This Practice Note considers the following commercial and legal issues arising from the use of free and open source software: • What is free and open source software? • History • Upstreaming and forking • Free and open source licences • Distribution of modified works (and the reciprocal effect) • Linking and incorporation • Software as a service (SaaS) • Compliance requirements • Licence incompatibility • Bare licence or contractual licence • Patents • Trade marks • Corporate transactions • Software bill of materials • Software licensing to the end user • Enforcement Free and open source software is the collective name for software which is available under a licence that grants the recipient the right to use it, modify it, and distribute it (either the original or the modified version) free of charge or royalty, and to which the source code of the software is available. This is in contrast to the software licences which lawyers are typically more familiar with which may...\n\nDiscover our 24 Practice Notes on Derivative works\n\nView the related precedents about Derivative works\n\nPersonal data sharing agreement—independent controllers—one-way\n\nPersonal data sharing agreement—independent controllers—one-way This Agreement is made on [date] Parties 1 [insert name of disclosing party] [of OR a company incorporated in [England and Wales] under number [insert registered number] whose registered office is at] [insert address] (Disclosing Party), and 2 [insert name of receiving party] [of OR a company incorporated in [England and Wales] under number [insert registered number] whose registered office is at] [insert address] (Receiving Party), (each of the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party being a party and together the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party are the parties).
