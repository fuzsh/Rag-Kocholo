        "text": "One half is designated for the songwriter(s) or composer(s), and the other half is designated for the publisher(s) or copyright holder(s). Learn more about how BMI pays royalties. If you do not have a publisher, you will also receive the publisher’s share as a writer.\n\nIf you do not own a publishing company and there are no publisher shares on the work you will see Manuscript as a publishing placeholder. This means the writer and publisher shares are flowing directly to the writers.\n\nBMI conducts music showcases nationwide and offers a variety of professional development seminars, but we cannot get your songs placed on the radio. Publishers, labels, managers and other outside executives may help you find new outlets for your work, but as a performing right organization, BMI’s focus is fair payment and copyright protection for our songwriters, composers and music publishers.\n\nFor career advice on how you can be heard, attend a BMI-sponsored workshop or contact your local songwriters association, like the Nashville Songwriters Association (NSAI) in Nashville.\n\nFirst, congratulations! Now, you need to make sure your work is registered. As soon as a song is published and/or recorded, it should be registered with and reported to BMI. BMI’s ability to license and monitor the performances of a composition is dependent upon the accuracy and timeliness of this reported information. Without it, you may miss out on royalties.\n\nTypically, a publisher will register songs for songwriters and composers. Early registration of works will help prevent lost royalties, so make sure your songs are registered.\n\nPlease refer to Instructions for Updating Registered Works for complete instructions to update registered works.\n\nIn short, you can email update requests to reviseworks@bmi.com. In your email, be sure to include the title and work number, as well as a clear description of the revision that is being requested. Your request will be reviewed and, if supporting documentation is required before the update can be completed, we’ll email you back with further instructions.\n\nPlease note, this is the only way to update an existing work. If you try to register a new version of the same work it will be rejected automatically.\n\nIPI stands for: Interested Parties Information\n\nCAE stands for: Composer, Author and Publisher\n\nThe IPI/CAE number is a publicly accessible international identification number used to identify participants on a work. Writers and publishers will be assigned a unique number for each name/AKA on file with BMI. Therefore, writers with multiple names/AKAs will have multiple numbers.\n\nRegister your works using the IPI Number associated with the name/AKA you would like to appear on the new work. Regardless of the IPI Number you decide to use, the royalties will all be directed to your BMI account. Please note your BMI account # is not your IPI#. Please do not use a BMI account number as an IPI# when registering a work.\n\nLocate your IPI numbers via Online Services or via Songview.\n\nOnline Services\n\nIPI Numbers are available in Online Services. Once you log in to your account, click IPI Number.\n\nIf you only have one BMI account, you will be taken directly to your IPI information.\n\nIf you have multiple BMI accounts, under My Accounts, click the name of an account.\n\nIn the example below, this person has access to their BMI writer and publisher accounts.\n\nYour Legal Name and any AKAs registered with BMI will be listed on this screen, each with its own unique IPI Number.\n\nSongview\n\nGo to Songview\n\nFrom the drop-down menu, select Writer/Composer or Publisher.\n\nEnter the name in the search bar.\n\nClick Search.\n\nThe IPI number appears under the column IPI#.\n\nPublic Performing Right\n\nGranted by U.S. Copyright Law, the public performing right is the exclusive right of the copyright owner to authorize the performance or transmission of a copyrighted work in public.\n\nPublic Performance License\n\nBMI issues licenses on behalf of the copyright owner or the copyright owner’s agent granting the right to perform the work in or transmit the work to the public.\n\nReproduction Right\n\nGranted by U.S. Copyright Law, the reproduction right is the exclusive right of the copyright owner to authorize the reproduction of a copyrighted musical work, as in CDs, records, tapes, ringtones, permanent digital downloads, and interactive streams.\n\nMechanical Licenses\n\nThe Mechanical Licensing Collective administers blanket licenses on behalf of copyright owners to eligible streaming and download services (digital service providers or DSP’s) in the United States.\n\nSynchronization License\n\nCopyright owners, usually a music publisher, issues a synchronization license, usually to a producer or other visual media creator, granting the right to synchronize (“sync”) a musical composition to visual images on film or video (on film, tv shows, advertisements, online videos, etc.).\n\nPublisher information, including contact information for BMI affiliated publishers, is available through our online repertoire search.\n\nRegistering your copyrights is not required but it is highly recommended since doing so will give you certain protection under copyright law in case you need to sue someone for using your song without your permission.\n\nRegistering songs with the Library of Congress puts your claim of authorship on the public record and may help if ever there is a dispute over credit or timing.\n\nOf course, the Library of Congress does not provide legal defense in the face of stolen or infringed material, but can provide written or recorded documentation of your copyright should the need arise.\n\nOn “official” remixes, meaning the new work has been commissioned by, or otherwise approved by, the creators/rights owners of the original work, yes, BMI does pay performance royalties. An “official” remix usually involves a DJ/producer, and, to the extent that there is a sufficient amount of new creative elements in the remix, it will typically be considered a derivative work. The label, artist, publishers, writers, and individual(s) involved in creating the remix will agree on what the royalty splits will be for the remix, which requires a new BMI registration to reflect the agreed royalty splits.\n\nOn an “unofficial” remix, meaning the remix was done without the consent of the creators/rights owners of the original work and the creator of the remix, no, BMI does not pay performance royalties to the individual(s) involved in creating the remix, because it is an unauthorized derivative work. “Unofficial” remixes should not be registered with BMI as a new work.\n\nBMI accepts registrations for works-for-hire. The company that hired you will normally own the copyright and be entitled to claim your publishing share. However, per BMI policy the writer, and not the company, must be listed as a composer/author on the registration. The only way for the company that commissioned you to receive your writer performance royalties would be through a royalty assignment. However, it is between you and the company to determine whether that is necessary.\n\nRoyalty Assignment Form"
