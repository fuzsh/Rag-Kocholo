        "text": "Copyright law automatically protects your original materials and helps prevent theft and other unauthorized uses. But posting a copyright disclaimer on your website or app informs users that you know the law and retain certain rights over your content.\n\nContinue reading to learn more about copyright notices and why you might need to post one on your website or app. Then, we’ll look at real-life copyright examples and teach you how to write your own copyright notice.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Is a Copyright?\n\nCopyright Examples & Types\n\nDo You Need a Copyright Notice?\n\nBenefits of a Copyright\n\nCan You Copyright AI-Generated Content?\n\nHow To Write a Copyright Notice\n\nHow and Where To Display a Copyright Notice\n\nCopyright Notice Examples\n\nCopyright FAQ\n\nSummary\n\nWhat Is a Copyright?\n\nA copyright is the exclusive legal right over how original content or materials you’ve made get copied, shared, reproduced, printed, performed, or published by others.\n\nIn other words, copyright provides you with exclusive rights to:\n\nReproduce your work\n\nDistribute or sell your work\n\nDisplay or perform your work publicly\n\nCreate derivative works based on the original work\n\nIt also allows you to authorize or restrict others in exercising these rights, further protecting your original works if they’re ever stolen or plagiarized.\n\nA copyright usually consists of the following four components, which we’ll discuss in more detail later in the article:\n\nCopyright symbol © or the word “copyright”\n\nYear the material was published\n\nName of the copyright owner\n\nWhat rights are retained by the copyright\n\nSome examples of copyrighted works include:\n\nArt\n\nLiterature\n\nVideos\n\nImages\n\nPhotography\n\nChoreography\n\nMusic\n\nSound clips\n\nCopyright Laws Around the World\n\nCopyright laws vary around the world, and there is no global version of copyright, but many countries are part of the Berne Convention, which deals with protecting original works and the authors’ rights over them.\n\nEstablished in 1886, countries under this convention agree to recognize a set of legal principles for protecting original content across country borders.\n\nHowever, there are subtle differences in how copyright law works in each location, so we’ll briefly touch upon the relevant laws in the following countries, all of which are part of the Berne Convention:\n\nThe United States\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe European Union (EU)\n\nAustralia\n\nCanada\n\nCopyright in the US\n\nIn the US, your original materials are protected by copyright law as soon as you create something and release it publicly, even if you don’t post a copyright notice.\n\nBut if you want to ensure further protection of your works and potentially limit paying costly legal fees down the road, adding a copyright notice to your content may help deter:\n\nCopyright infringement\n\nUnauthorized reproduction, distribution, or displaying of copyrighted materials\n\nYou may also choose to register your copyright with the US Copyright Office.\n\nCopyright in the UK\n\nCopyright laws in the UK protect your original materials automatically. You do not have to apply for protection, register your work, or pay any fees for the law to protect your original creations, including:\n\nLiterary works\n\nDramatic works\n\nMusic\n\nWorks of art\n\nCopyright in the EU\n\nIn the EU, copyright applies to your intellectual property until 70 years after your death or 70 years after the death of the last surviving author in cases of joint authorship.\n\nBut in the EU, there is no equivalent “fair use” doctrine, like in the US. Instead, there is a list of explicit exceptions that cover specific scopes.\n\nCopyright in Australia\n\nLike in the US, UK, and EU, Australia’s copyright law protects your creative works the moment you put your creative idea on paper, online, or any other form of documentation.\n\nYou do not need to register your work, as the protection is free and automatic under Australia’s Copyright Act 1968.\n\nCopyright in Canada\n\nAs of 2022, copyright in Canada applies to your work automatically and lasts the author’s lifetime plus 70 years past their death.\n\nPreviously, the protection only lasted for 50 years past the author’s death.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between a Copyright and a Trademark?\n\nThe difference between a copyright and a trademark is the type of content each notice protects — trademarks apply to logos, slogans, and brand identity. In contrast, copyright applies to original tangible materials and creative works.\n\nYou technically own a trademark as soon as you start using a name or brand identity along with your goods or service, making it similar to how copyright law works.\n\nWhile you’re not legally required to register your trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), doing so gives you broader rights and protections than when left unregistered.\n\nFor example, registering your trademark in the US grants you national recognition and creates nationwide rights.\n\nOnce registered, you can use the trademark symbol, which looks like an R with a circle around it: ®\n\nBut if your trademark is unregistered, you must use the abbreviation ‘TM’. However, if you’re trademarking a service, you may also use the initials’ SM’, meaning service mark, but both are still referred to as trademarks.\n\nYou can use the logo or abbreviations whenever you use your trademarked identity, as shown in the example screenshot below from the official International Olympics website.\n\nHowever, if you prefer, you may also format it as superscript or subscript text.\n\nCopyright Examples & Types\n\nThere are technically two types of copyright examples, one allows you to reuse copyrighted materials in specific ways for “fair use” purposes without the owners’ permission, and the other protects your content from reuse or reproduction as the owner of the work.\n\nLet’s go over each type of copyright example in a little more detail in the following sections.\n\nCopyrighting Works of Creative Expression\n\nAccording to the US Copyright Office, copyright applies to all original works of creative expression captured in a tangible form and goes to the work’s original creator, who can choose to sell their rights to other parties.\n\nSome examples of works that can be copyrighted include:\n\nArchitectural works\n\nSound recordings\n\nAudiovisual works — including motion pictures\n\nArtworks\n\nDramatic works — including any accompanying music\n\nMusical works — including any accompanying words\n\nLiterary works\n\nChoreographic works\n\nThat said, there are limitations to the types of work this protection applies to.\n\nThe following examples of content aren’t protected by copyright:\n\nIdeas, methods, systems, concepts, or discoveries\n\nWorks that don’t have a tangible form (i.e., not captured in a physical medium)\n\nTitles, names, slogans\n\nFamiliar symbols or designs\n\nVariations of typefaces or lettering\n\nIngredient lists\n\n“Fair Use” and Section 107 of the Copyright Act\n\nYou are allowed to legally reproduce or reuse certain aspects of a copyrighted work without the owners’ explicit permission for the following reasons, which qualify as “fair use” under section 107 of the Copyright Act:\n\nCommentary — i.e., copying paragraphs from a news article, scientific paper, or medical journal for educational purposes\n\nCriticism — i.e., quoting song lyrics or summarizing movie scenes for a critical review\n\nParody — i.e., mimicking, making light of, or satirizing something in a comedic way\n\nIf you’re using someone else’s content for “fair use” purposes, it’s in your best interest to post a copyright disclaimer or a fair use disclaimer stating as much to help prevent an unfair or unnecessary copyright strike.\n\nHowever, a disclaimer cannot guarantee that you won’t receive an unfair strike.\n\nFor this reason, we recommend getting explicit permission from the copyright owner to use their materials whenever possible.\n\nWhile “fair use” copyrights are essential in many cases, the focus of this guide is primarily on the copyright that applies to protecting your usage rights over original content.\n\nDo You Need a Copyright Notice?\n\nWhile you don’t legally need a copyright notice for the law to cover your original works, it’s a best practice to put a disclaimer on all your published materials for the following reasons:\n\nIt’s also in your best interest to post a fair use copyright notice if you’re reusing someone else’s copyrighted materials for commentary, criticism, or parody purposes.\n\nWhile it can’t prevent someone from submitting an unfair copyright strike against you, it may help reduce the chances.\n\nBenefits of a Copyright\n\nThere are several benefits to including a copyright on your website or app:\n\nThey’re quick and easy to make and publish\n\nThey provide an extra layer of protection over your intellectual property\n\nAdding one now may help save you thousands of dollars in legal fees down the road\n\nLet’s go over these benefits together in a little more detail.\n\nCopyrights Are Quick and Easy To Make\n\nMaking a copyright for your website or app is very quick and easy, so there’s little to no reason not to include one to remind users that you own the rights over your content.\n\nThere are only four simple components you need to include:\n\nThe copyright symbol © or the word “copyright”\n\nThe name of the copyright owner or author of the work\n\nThe year the content was published, which can be different from the year of creation\n\nYour statement of the rights you’re reserving over the materials\n\nThis screenshot labels all four copyright components from the United Parcel Service’s (UPS) website.\n\nAs you can see, they used both the copyright symbol and the word “copyright”, included a range of years, named themselves as the copyright owner, and reserved all rights.\n\nWe recommend you post a copyright notice in the footer of your website, like how UPS did it above. It’s fast, easy, and helps protect your materials better.\n\nCopyrights Provide Extra Protection\n\nIncluding a copyright notice protects your creations because it gives you something to point to as proof of ownership. It also helps you prove that any offenders should’ve seen the statement and been aware of the rights you retained over the materials.\n\nPlus, not all users know about copyright laws. If they don’t see a notice, they might wrongfully believe they can freely use your materials when that is not legally the case.\n\nCopyrights May Help Save You Money in Legal Fees\n\nA copyright notice is usually free to post on your website or app and may reduce the number of copyright infringement cases you experience — that’s much cheaper than waiting until you have to rely on a lawyer.\n\nIn 2022, the average cost of a lawyer specializing in intellectual property cases averaged $342 an hour. (Statista)\n\nCan You Copyright AI-Generated Content?\n\nYou may be wondering if you need to copyright AI-generated content — or if it’s even possible to copyright it in the first place.\n\nSince this technology is advancing rapidly, many businesses are turning to artificial intelligence to help jump-start tasks to save time, like writing emails with AI or generating customized business logos created by AI for their brand.\n\nCurrently, government entities are still debating if such content falls under copyright laws or not. Some suggest that because a machine and not a human created it, it cannot fall under these copyright laws.\n\nOthers suggest that because AI models are created and influenced by humans, the content may fall under derivative work. Derivative works are creations based on an original piece of copyrightable content.\n\nIn Spring 2023, the U.S. Copyright Office held multiple listening sessions discussing this topic and released guidance on the matter. According to their AI Policy Guidance, when submitting a copyright application, you must disclose what portions of the content come from an AI and which portions were created by a human. The AI contributions cannot be copyrighted unless they’re de minimis — a fancy way of saying trivial or minor.\n\nSo, for now, play it safe and add a copyright disclaimer that clearly explains what portions of your materials were created by humans versus what was generated by an AI or machine learning model.\n\nHow To Write a Copyright Notice\n\nTo write your own copyright notice, you must include some or all four of the following components in this order:\n\nThe copyright symbol © or the word “copyright”\n\nThe year the material was published — you may include a range of years if your content is regularly updated, and this can be different from the creation date\n\nThe name of the copyright owner — this can be an individual, multiple people, an organization, or a business\n\nYour statement of rights you wish to retain over your materials — some, all, or none\n\nWhat do the different statements of rights mean?\n\nPutting the statement of your rights in your copyright is optional. If you don’t add it, then it’s legally assumed you retain all rights.\n\nHow and Where To Display a Copyright Notice\n\nYour copyright notice should be displayed conspicuously so that anyone who views your work knows that it’s copyrighted.\n\nThe placement of your copyright notice depends on the type of work or content you’re putting your notice on, but we suggest the following locations:\n\nIn the footer of your website\n\nMobile app description pages, purchase pages, or within the app itself\n\nIn your email footer\n\nOn any downloadable materials\n\nLet’s discuss why these are good places to include your copyright in more detail in the next sections.\n\nCopyright in Your Website Footer\n\nThe most common place to put a copyright notice is the footer of your website, so we recommend including it there, as this is where users expect to find it.\n\nWe recommend using a visible, readable font and including as many of the components you feel are necessary to establish ownership of your content.\n\nIn the screenshot below, see a copyright example from the footer of the Starbucks website.\n\nCopyright in Your Mobile Apps\n\nFor app developers, you should include a copyright on the description or purchase pages of any app store that hosts your product so users see it before downloading and accessing your services.\n\nBelow, see a copyright example from Ulysses, a one-stop writing app hosted in the Apple App Store.\n\nCopyright in Your Email Footers\n\nIf you send marketing emails to your consumers that contain product updates, videos, imagery, or written materials you don’t want to be copied and reproduced, include a copyright in the footer of all of your emails.\n\nTake, for example, the copyright from Apple’s iCloud marketing emails, pictured for you below.\n\nCopyright on Downloadable Materials\n\nIf you want to protect content you allow users to download, include a copyright notice on the document or product.\n\nBy doing so, you ensure that anyone who accesses the downloaded versions of your materials knows it’s protected by copyright law.\n\nAdditional Copyright Locations\n\nThere are some other examples of standard copyright notice placements for various works, like:\n\nBooks or ebooks often have a copyright page at the beginning or end of the book\n\nPhotos and other forms of digital art often have a copyright near the bottom of the work or a watermarked label\n\nYouTube videos often have a copyright notice in the video description or video credits\n\nBut it’s important to note that you can’t just slap a copyright on whatever you want and expect it to legally protect you — there are exceptions, like fashion or personal styles, commonly known information, or anything considered an idea, method, or system.\n\nCopyright Notice Examples\n\nNow let’s look at some real examples of copyright notices, which we’ll break down into the four relevant components mentioned above.\n\nPixar’s Copyright Example\n\nIn the screenshot below, see the components included in Pixar’s copyright, which is in their website footer and follows the standard copyright format.\n\nAs you can see, they include the following copyright components in their notice:\n\nThey use the © symbol\n\n1986-2023 is the range of dates covered by their copyright\n\nDisney/Pixar is the name of the copyright owner\n\nThere is no statement of rights, which means they reserve all rights over their property\n\nLike the Pixar copyright example, your statement can include a range of years if you’ve expanded or updated your content since the original publication date.\n\nIn the following screenshot, you can view the clause Pixar includes in their terms of use agreement that expands upon their copyright and lists all intellectual property it covers.\n\nWe also recommend including a similar clause in your terms of use agreement.\n\nIt helps answer any questions users might have about what your copyright covers and explains the legality of reusing, redistributing, or copying your content.\n\nThe Yale University Art Gallery Copyright Example\n\nNext, let’s look at a copyright example from the website footer of the Yale University Art Gallery, screenshotted below and labeled based on the four components.\n\nYale clearly includes all four components in their copyright notice:\n\nThey use the word “copyright” and the © symbol\n\nThe copyrighted year is 2023\n\nThe name of the copyright owner is the Yale University Art Gallery\n\nThey have reserved all rights\n\nYale also links their terms and conditions directly under their copyright. When clicked on, you can navigate to a copyright page that informs users that they trademarked their branding, as shown below.\n\nAs the highlighted text above explains, the Yale-specific trademarked branding and materials cannot be reproduced except to provide attribution.\n\nThe notice then goes on to explain that they participate in an open access policy regarding photos in their art collection that are now part of the public domain, also shown for you below.\n\nThe copyright statement specifies that some of the images from the site are part of the public domain, meaning they’re free for anyone to use.\n\nLike this example copyright notice, you can add an “All rights reserved” statement to your copyright footer to declare full ownership over your content, then link to a copyright notice page or your terms and conditions agreement to provide more information about the specific or nuanced details.\n\nCostco’s Copyright Example\n\nAnother great example of a copyright page comes from Costco, who posts the following copyright notice in their website’s footer.\n\nTo translate this into the four primary components of a copyright, Costco:\n\nUses the © symbol\n\nPuts the date range 1998-2023\n\nNames themselves, Costco Wholesale Corporation, as the owner\n\nRetain all rights over their property\n\nWithin their terms and conditions, they include a copyright page that expands upon their notice even further, providing users with a way to report potential copyright claims and explaining what they’ve also trademarked.\n\nYou should also consider providing a way for your users to notify you about suspected copyright infringement, similar to how Costco does it.\n\nYour consumers might spot breaches you miss, which helps you take care of unwanted reproduction of your materials more efficiently.\n\nCopyright FAQ\n\nIf you still have questions, we’ve got more answers. In the next section, check out some of the most frequently asked questions we get about copyrights.\n\nSummary\n\nIn countries part of the Berne Convention, copyright laws ensure that your creative works are covered the moment they’re created, keeping your content safe from theft and copyright infringement.\n\nBut even though copyright laws protect original materials typically without requiring you to also post a disclaimer, it’s in your best interest to put a copyright notice somewhere on your website or app to:\n\nInform others that you intend to retain all rights over your content\n\nClearly show that your work requires authorization for use\n\nThis strengthens your protection over your original materials and might help you avoid potential legal fees by discouraging copyright infringement before it starts."
