Derivative works are the result of taking a pre-existing work and creating a new composition from that material. It is different than a cover song, which is a more straightforward recreation of an existing composition, but without significant alterations to the melody or lyrics.

Examples of derivative works include:

Language translations

Sampling (recording a specific segment of an original song)

Medleys

Any song arrangements that change lyrics, abridge the music, or make other significant modifications to the original composition.

Can I register a Derivative Work with The MLC?

If a derivative work has been properly licensed with permission from the original publisher or copyright holder, you can distribute that song through digital service providers as an original work with the proper songwriting ownership of the new song registered. That ownership should reflect the license you have negotiated with the creator of the work you created a derivative work from.

What form of permission do I need from the copyright holder to register my derivative work?

You need an agreement that grants/assigns you the right to use the copyrighted material in a new work.

If the derivative work is a sample or interpolation, the agreement usually takes the form of a sample agreement. However, The MLC cannot give information or advice on how to secure permission. Please reach out to your legal representative for further questions.
