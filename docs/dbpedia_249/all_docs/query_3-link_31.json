        "text": "July 26, 2017\n\nSAN DIEGO - San Diego State women's soccer head coach Mike Friesen has added a pair of coaches to his coaching staff in Cole Schmit and Cameron Roget. Schmit joins the program as an assistant coach, while Roget will perform volunteer assistant coach duties.\n\nSchmit arrives at SDSU from up the coast in Santa Barbara where he was a women's soccer assistant coach at Westmont College, which is an NAIA institution that competes in the Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC). In two seasons, he helped the Warriors to a 32-8-4 record, a pair of league titles and two trips to the NAIA tournament.\n\nIn his first season on campus, Schmit and the Warriors won the 2015 GSAC regular season and tournament championships en route to an NAIA quarterfinal appearance. One season later, Westmont advanced to the Round of 16. In addition to the team success, Schmit helped the Warriors collect two GSAC Player-of-the-Year awards, three All-America accolades and eight all-conference honors.\n\nPrior to his time at Westmont, Schmit, who owns a USSF E License and an NSCAA Goalkeeping 1 Diploma, was a men's soccer volunteer assistant coach at Pacific in 2014. In his one season in Stockton, he helped the first-year program become what is now considered a contender in the West Coast Conference.\n\nSchmit played collegiately at California Baptist where he helped the Lancers to a 58-21-4 record after scoring 10 goals and logging nine assists in 83 games (59 starts). In his time at CBU, the Lancers won the NCCAA Division I national championship in 2011 and 2012, and won the 2011 Pacific West Conference title. Individually, Schmit was an NSCAA/NCCAA Division I first-team All-American and an all-PacWest first-team midfielder in 2012. His success on the field translated in the classroom as he earned a spot on the all-PacWest academic team three times and was recognized as an NCCAA Scholar-Athlete.\n\nRoget, meanwhile, brings nearly a decade's worth of high-level soccer experience that has taken him from the United States to Trinidad and Tobago to Finland and to the Netherlands. Before heading off to Cal State Dominguez Hills to play collegiately, Roget spent time with the Trinidad and Tobago U17 team. Following his national team exposure, which would lead to his U23 appointment in 2011-12, Roget helped the Toros to the 2008 Division II national championship and finished the 2009 campaign with CSUDH before transferring to San Diego City College where he was a Pacific Coast Athletic Conference all-conference selection and scholar-athlete.\n\nWhen his collegiate career was completed, Roget embarked a professional career that spanned six years and three countries. First up was a three-year stint with the St. Ann's Rangers in Trinidad and Tobago from 2011-13 and then a two-team tour in Finland (Sporting Kristina – 2014-15, Vasa IFK – 2015). Roget put the finishing touches on his playing career in the Netherlands where he saw action with FC Lienden in 2016.\n\nRoget experienced his first taste of coaching in 2012-13 when he was in Trinidad and Tobago and playing with the Rangers. It was there he assisted training sessions with the youth professional team. That experience led to a similar position when he was playing with Sporting Kristina in 2015. Upon returning to the United States, Roget began coaching with the Rebels Soccer Club in Chula Vista and at Bonita Vista High School, which came after a three-year stint at Otay Ranch High School."
