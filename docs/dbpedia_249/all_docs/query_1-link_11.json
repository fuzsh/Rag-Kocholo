        "text": "“Mathias has an astonishing calm. No matter what the situation, he is able to sift the relevant information from the noise and prioritize the issues that need to be handled immediately by him or the people working with him. He uses his attention to detail and eye for the big picture to create processes and routines that are effective and easy to follow also for others. Thanks to his sense of responsibility coupled with his active communication with internal and external counterparties, one can be confident that the processes he develops will interface seamlessly with other departments and firms, which improves the quality of output also outside his direct area of responsibility. Mathias is very sociable and find a natural spot in any gathering of people, whether it is a board meeting or a dinner with acquaintances. His opinions are well thought through, and he doesn’t hesitate to discuss even uncomfortable subjects when it is needed. Because of that, one can always count on Mathias mentioning the issues that are beginning to move in the wrong direction and take corrective action while the issues are small. He is one of the most well-organized persons I know. I can’t say whether it comes naturally to him, or whether it is a necessity due to his schedule being crammed with commitments to public sector and football club boards besides the work-related commitments, but the outcome is that he knows when and where he needs to be, and he is there on time. Mathias is a good judge of peoples’ skills, allowing him to delegate an appropriate amount of responsibility to junior staff. At the same time he is helpful and attentive, taking the extra effort to help out whenever needed, which ensures a desired end result.”"
