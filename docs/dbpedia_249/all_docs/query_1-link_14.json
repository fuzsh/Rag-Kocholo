Initially the goal was to sign at a first division club, however at this point in my career I wanted to play the most games possible. My first full season in the 2nd division. 10 months away from family and friends is never easy; sacrifices were made, goals were achieved, and growth was gained. Step outside your comfort zone and you’ll be surprised on what you can accomplish. Become comfortable being uncomfortable. Let’s see where this beautiful sport takes me now. ⏳ Thank you football ⚽️\n\n2022 Highlights ▶️ https://lnkd.in/ge8Qp22E [Free Agent - Open to opportunities] Another season comes to an end.
