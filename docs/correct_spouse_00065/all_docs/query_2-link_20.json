        "text": "26th November 2018: Chris Brown Keeps Commenting On Rihanna’s Social Media And The Internet Isn’t Having It\n\nMonths since Chris Brown publicly wished his ex Rihanna a happy birthday, the singer has ruffled more feathers by commenting not once, but twice on the actress, designer, singer and beauty mogul's Instagram posts.\n\nTo promote her lingerie line Savage x Fenty, the bajan posted some snaps of herself in stockings, long gloves and red knickers on a bed.\n\nAlmost ten years since Brown plead guilty to assaulting her, he commented with two wide-eyed, flush-faced emojis under one of the pictures.\n\nWhilst many people supported Brown's flirty comments, others were outraged, taking to Twitter and Instagram to voice their anger.\n\nAfter Brown plead guilty to a felony assault in 2009, and received community service, domestic violence counselling and five years of probation, the couple got back together in 2012 only to end their relationship finally in 2013.\n\nIn 2015 Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Fenty, gave an intimate interview about their relationship, detailing that she had asked the court to lift her restraining order against him to Vanity Fair.\n\n'I was very protective of him,' the 30-year-old Ocean's 8 star explained, 'I felt that people didn’t understand him. Even after... But you know, you realise after a while that in that situation you're the enemy.\n\n'You want the best for them, but if you remind them of their failures, or if you remind them of bad moments in their life, or even if you say I'm willing to put up with something, they think less of you-because they know you don't deserve what they're going to give.'\n\nFenty added, 'I don't hate him. I will care about him until the day I die. We're not friends, but it's not like we're enemies. We don't have much of a relationship now.'\n\n21st March 2018: Chris Brown Wished Rihanna A Happy Birthday Yesterday And The Internet Doesn't Know What To Think\n\nYesterday the internet was alight with the glory of Rihanna since it was the singer, actress, beauty mogul, designer and philanthropist's 30th birthday.\n\nOur Instagram feeds were awash with inspirational images of the Bardadian babe clutching her oversized wine glasses and pinching those elegant blunts, and it was a better place for it.\n\nMany of us took to our feeds to wish the Harvard University 2017 'Humanitarian of the Year' a happy 3-0, including singer Ciara and, notably, her ex-boyfriend Chris Brown.\n\nBrown was found guilty of assault after he physically attacked his then-girlfriend Rihanna in a Lamborghini the night before the Grammys in 2009.\n\nAt the time, TMZ released the shocking image of the pop princess battered and bruised with a split lip and a black eye. Rihanna went on to describe the attack in a harrowing police report which you can read online, as well as an emotional interview with Diane Sawyer.\n\nSince then there has been much debate about whether the now 28 year-old Brown should be publicly 'forgiven' for his act of domestic abuse.\n\nMany have cited that Rihanna went back out with her abusive ex, suggesting that if she has 'gotten over it' so should the rest of us.\n\nOthers, however, point out that Brown has had a string of allegations against him. He's been accused of stealing a woman's phone, shoving a woman to the floor, forcibly ejecting a woman from his bus, punching a woman in the face in a Las Vegas night club and threatening a woman with a gun.\n\nYesterday the singer posted a snap of a young Robyn Fenty wishing her a happy birthday, but swiftly switched off the comments.\n\nPeople instead took to Twitter to air their grievances with the 'Loyal' singer:\n\nOthers thought that the reaction against the artist was too extreme, and he should be able to give his ex-partner well wishes:\n\nWith TV shows such as Big Little Lies highlighting the insidious and damaging nature of domestic abuse, we wonder whether Brown would have had the same professional success if his attack had been in 2018, not 2009.\n\nHowever, it wasn't and hopefully he has learnt something in the last ten years."
