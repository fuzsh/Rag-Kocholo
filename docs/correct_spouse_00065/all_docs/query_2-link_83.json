        "text": "Is it me or has everyone just about gone nuts over this story? Whilst I don’t seek to belittle what seems to have happened, I think we need to put it into context here.\n\nWe need to remember the ages of the people involved. Chris Brown is just 19 years old and Rihanna is just 21 years old. Please people, These young singers may be thrust into the limelight too early. Now their personal relationship is under scrutiny, the same sort of scrutiny that Posh and Becks received from the media. I think it’s important to remember these people are just kids.\n\nI don’t say that with any disrespect to young people. I know that relationships can be very intense at any age, especially that age. However, Chris and Rihanna have the added distraction of pots of money and notoriety to deal with. Can you imagine the stress this must be putting their relationship under?\n\nThat said, personally I don’t think it’s ever right to hit a woman, or indeed anyone except in self defense. If she is p***ing you off that badly. Ditch her…don’t smack her.\n\nAs for Rihanna, well,if he’s hitting you now girl when your young and at the top of your game, what will it be like in 10/20 years when the star has faded? Get out of there, and don’t look back!\n\nLet me kow what you think about this whole Sorry story."
