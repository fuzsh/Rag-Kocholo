        "text": "After maintaining secrecy for almost a year, Rihanna has finally unveiled the name of her baby son. The moniker is just disclosed on the baby’s official certificate of live birth, and it happens to be a tribute to a renowned artist.\n\nA moniker that introduces the baby to the music industry from now.\n\nThe certificate displayed the place of birth of the baby which is Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and most importantly revealed that the child has been named ’RZA Athelston’.\n\nRihanna, the renowned 35-year-old pop sensation, shares her son with A$AP Rocky, her partner. The name appears to be a tribute to RZA, the esteemed producer and rapper who serves as the leader of the renowned Wu-Tang Clan. Interestingly, the certificate of live birth reveals that RZA shares his father’s middle name, Athelston. However, multiple sources previously reported Rocky’s middle name as ’Athelaston,’ too.\n\nRihanna has made many subtle statements prior to the recent name reveal.\n\nAfter the birth of her son on May 13 last year, Rihanna dropped subtle hints about his name by frequently donning Wu-Tang Clan apparel. Speculations among fans suggested the name Noah, but there were limited clues regarding the actual name.\n\nOn April 5, Rihanna provided another hint as she was spotted leaving Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, cradling her joyful son while wearing a loose black Wu-Tang Clan top. Moreover, nearly three months after giving birth, on August 12 of last year, the Umbrella singer made a less subtle statement in New York City, sporting an oversized white RZA T-shirt.\n\nA$AP Rocky might actually be the one who chose the baby’s name.\n\nAlthough the extent of Rihanna’s fandom for RZA and the Wu-Tang Clan remains uncertain, her partner Rocky is an avid fan. He previously collaborated with Raekwon from the group on the 2015 track “Fly International Luxurious Art.”\n\nA$AP Mob, the collective Rocky is associated with, has also drawn comparisons to the iconic hip-hop group in its early days. Like Wu-Tang, it consists of prominent core members and occasional peripheral contributors.\n\nInterestingly, there was a missed opportunity for a collaboration between Rihanna and RZA, albeit on screen rather than in the studio.\n\nIn 2008, during an interview with MTV News -which is now being shut down by Paramount Global after a 36-year run,- the rapper expressed his desire to create a remake of the 1985 kung-fu comedy film The Last Dragon with Rihanna playing the role of a video show host and singer, similar to the original film. He enthusiastically supported the idea, stating, “That’s the one I’m rooting for... We’re keeping that same concept of the girl being in the music business.”\n\nHowever, in a regrettable turn of events, RZA made a tasteless suggestion to XXL in 2009, proposing that Rihanna’s ex-partner, Chris Brown, should star alongside her in the film. Despite the involvement of actors like Samuel L. Jackson, the film never materialized.\n\nRihanna is maintaining secrecy regarding the second baby, too.\n\nAs for Rihanna’s second child, it remains uncertain if she intends to keep the name a secret. She publicly announced her pregnancy during her show-stopping Super Bowl halftime performance on February 12 in Glendale, Arizona, showcasing her new baby bump.\n\nRecently, during her remarkable appearance at the Met Gala alongside her boyfriend, Rihanna shared that her current pregnancy experience is distinct from her previous one. She mentioned experiencing no cravings but plenty of nausea. Despite the differences, she expressed her enjoyment of the journey. Furthermore, the singer revealed her deep affection for her youngest child, stating, “I’m obsessed, and I don’t even feel guilty about it.”\n\nThe Barbados-born songstress is maintaining her usual secrecy regarding her second baby and has not disclosed the baby’s gender yet. In fact, there was speculation among fans when she was seen browsing pink baby clothes last month, leading some to believe she might be expecting a girl. However, it’s worth noting that she had previously been spotted looking at girl clothes before welcoming RZA, so she could have been shopping for someone else’s baby.\n\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky have been friends and collaborators for over a decade, often attending red-carpet events together in recent years. However, their official relationship as a couple only began in late 2020.\n\nRihanna’s softer side as a doting mother has been captured in a series of intimate photos shared by her boyfriend, A$AP Rocky. The images reveal the singer’s nurturing qualities as she showers love on her son RZA. The post also includes a photo that documents Rihanna’s second pregnancy, sparking fan speculation about the gender of the upcoming baby. Rihanna’s comment on the post, mentioning A$AP Rocky’s real name, Rakim Mayers, adds a personal touch to the family portrait.\n\nCelebrations are in order as Rihanna and A$AP Rocky mark their son RZA’s first birthday. A carousel of photos shared by the rapper captures heartwarming moments of the family trio. A$AP Rocky’s post includes pictures of him holding RZA while shaving and dancing, showcasing his pride as a father. The name RZA pays tribute to the leader of the Wu-Tang Clan, and a close source reveals that Rihanna is thoroughly enjoying motherhood, stating she is the “happiest she has ever been.”\n\nFashion icon and singer Rihanna has once again captivated the world, this time with her journey into motherhood. A series of stunning maternity photos shared on Instagram showcase her radiant beauty and blossoming baby bump. The images were taken during her first pregnancy, and Rihanna is currently in her third trimester with her second child. The announcement of her second pregnancy was made during her halftime performance at the 2023 Super Bowl, adding an electrifying twist to the event."
