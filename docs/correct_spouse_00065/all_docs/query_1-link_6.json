        "text": "Not sure if you’ve been keeping up with this It Couple (of course you have), but in the event you somehow haven't, just know that a lot has gone down with A$AP Rocky and Rihanna lately. Like, first of all, they're thriving with their baby boys and even recently teamed up to make a unisex lip balm that your situationship (or you!) will no doubt be wearing all winter long.\n\nAside from all these ^^^iconic updates, Rih and A$AP went through a bit of a tumultuous time leading up to their first son’s birth. For instance, there was the truly wild rumor that A$AP Rocky cheated on Rihanna (spoiler alert: he didn’t) on top of the news that he was arrested in Los Angeles after landing from vacation in Barbados with Rihanna, who was reportedly with him during the arrest. Then the two celebrated their son’s birth by throwing a rave-themed shower and were also seen getting “married” in a super-sweet scene for A$AP’s latest music vid.\n\nAll of this only means that you need to spend today working at the job you get paid to do deep-diving into their relationship. Warning: It is filled with MOMENTS, so please prepare yourself for a complete and total lack of chill.\n\nLet’s get started with the most recent updates first, shall we?\n\nJune 16, 2024\n\nRihanna and Rocky's sons star in a Bottega Veneta Father's Day campaign along with their dad and the pics are simply too cute.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nRihanna talks to Entertainment Tonight at the Rihanna x Fenty Hair launch party and when asked if she'll have more kids says \"You know what, I hope so. I do.\"\n\nBTW, can we talk about how STUNNING she looks?\n\nMay 12, 2024\n\nThe musicians have a date night out in NYC in honor of Mother's Day and get in a custom cab to transport them in style. I mean...obsessed is a literal understatement:\n\nMay 11, 2024\n\nThe couple has a sweet family day together and celebrates their oldest son RZA's second birthday in New York City. Rihanna and A$AP take turns carrying their two kids and stop by The Color Factory children’s art museum in SoHo for a private party for the big day. S'cute! 🥺❤️\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\nRih celebrates the launch of Fenty Beauty's Soft’Lit Naturally Luminous Hydrating Longwear Foundation in LA, and, of course, she looks radiant:\n\nAt the event, the multi-hyphenate opens up about raising her kids with A$AP Rocky, telling E! News, “They bring purpose to every aspect of my life. Everything has to be intentional, and everything has to be worth it—especially when it takes me away from them.”\n\nShe also dishes about motherhood, adding, “It makes me feel really cool to be a boy mom. I get to be as casual and busted as I want to, but it also forces me to embrace the epic things about being a woman and female and all my femininity—I embrace it so much more now.”\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nRihanna is asked about ~new music~ by Entertainment Tonight and implies that she and Rocky's sons might be featured on their respective upcoming albums. Watch/spiral:\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nDuring a convo with Interview Magazine, Rihanna is asked by stylist Mel Ottenberg how many more kids she wants to have, to which the singer responds, “As many as god wants me to have.”\n\nThen, when questioned whether it's more than two, she dishes, “I don't know what god wants, but I would go for more than two. I would try for my girl. But of course if it's another boy, it's another boy.” Brb, manifesting a bunch more bb's for Rihanna and A$AP!!!\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\nIn honor of their first Fenty collab together, the celebs co-star in a *chef's kiss* short film called Born to Steal: Yours, Mine, Ours. In the vid, Rihanna plays a woman who steals from her lover, aka Rocky, who is then determined to find the thief.\n\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nThe couple is snapped under an umbrella (heh) leaving Venice after celebrating Rihanna's 36th birthday. Earlier in their trip, the celebs were *also* spotted enjoying a romantic boat ride on the Grand Canal, where they were seen kissing and laughing. 🥺❤️\n\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nThese two are spotted celebrating Valentine's Day in Paris looking absolutely gorgeous and totally in love:\n\nJanuary 5, 2024\n\nRihanna and A$AP announce the release of their Fenty unisex lip balm with a truly *chef's kiss* description that makes us add to cart immediately. Ahem: “This juicy, Barbados Cherry-powered lip balm packed with vitamin E + shea butter brings dry lips back to life with instant hydration 👄 It’s slim, slick n easily slips into your pocket, so you can keep it on you wherever you go ☝🏼.”\n\nAnd because they're social media/marketing GENIUSES as well, the promo vid is set over one of A$AP's songs, “RIOT (Rowdy Pipe’n),” in which he raps, “Flossy, glossy/ Nah b–ch this ain’t lip gloss/ Lux balm up in my palm/ New collab wit my baby mom.”\n\nDecember 19, 2023\n\nAccording to Rihanna, Riot and RZA are quite literally “obsessed” with their dad—and she seems to be as well!

I think that’s our best creation so far. Nothing’s better than that...that’s the best collaboration.”\n\nConsider our ice-cold hearts melted!\n\nNovember 4, 2023\n\nThe couple is photographed getting dinner together in Beverly Hills (pics right over this way!), and, per usual, the two look incredible, with Rihanna wearing a stunning animal print coat and minidress and A$AP sporting a suit. Take! Notes! People!!!\n\nOctober 3, 2023\n\nWe already know Rihanna is the reigning Queen of Fashion (see: her iconic “She can beat me, but she cannot beat my outfit” speech at the 2014 CFDA Awards) and that A$AP Rocky is a certified “Fashion Killa,” but the couple just proved that their outfit game is unmatched. Rih and Rocky stepped out in style to celebrate the rapper’s 34th birthday at Carbone in New York City:\n\nRocky opted for baggy jeans, a tan plaid blazer, a gray sweatshirt, and a white dress shirt while the “Lift Me Up” singer rocked a chic all-black look complete with giant sunnies and a tulle tube top.

I still have it too. It works like nobody’s business. I love the simple things but also the grand adventures. There’s no pretentious my-brand-your-brand bullshit, it’s just us living.

She’s The One.”\n\nDecember 28, 2020\n\nRihanna and Rocky spend the holidays together, and a source tells Entertainment Tonight, “Spending Christmas together was an obvious step for Rihanna and A$AP.
