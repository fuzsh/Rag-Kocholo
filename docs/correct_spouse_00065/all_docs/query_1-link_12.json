        "text": "In a new interview, Rihanna went deep about her life with two sons, why moms are \"lazy dressers\" — and whether a third baby is on the horizon.\n\nThe \"Umbrella\" singer, who shares sons RZA, 1, and Riot Rose, 8 months, with rapper ASAP Rocky, didn't hold back during her April conversation with Interview Magazine.\n\n\"I spend my time getting the kids dressed to death, and then I’m like, 'What’s the most comfortable outfit to wear around them? What’s not going to feel uncomfortable on their face or on their body or make me feel like I can’t hold them properly?'\" Rihanna told the outlet, when asked whether she and Rocky compete in the fashion department. \"Moms are lazy dressers in real life.\"\n\nShe added, \"Everybody thinks Rocky dresses them because I dress them in Rocky outfits.\"\n\nRihanna made her second pregnancy announcement during her halftime show at Super Bowl 2023, spurred by a wardrobe malfunction that forced her baby bump on display.\n\n“I did what I had to do, right? My jumper couldn’t zip up,\" she told \"Access Hollywood\" in December 2023.\n\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky became first-time parents in May 2022 with the birth of their son RZA. They welcomed Riot Rose in August 2023.\n\nThe singer praised A$AP Rocky as a partner and a father. \"When someone sees you completely, and believes in you, and thinks you’re worthy of being the mother of their kids, it’s a great feeling,\" she told Interview, adding, \"I felt the same about him. I knew he would be a great dad.\"\n\nIs a third baby on the horizon?\n\n\"I don’t know what God wants, but I would go for more than two,\" Rihanna told the outlet. \"I would try for my girl. But of course if it’s another boy, it’s another boy.\"\n\nFor now, she is enjoying her sons. She even shared a sweet story about her nearly 2-year-old and his first word.\n\n“I used to try to get his attention all the time, and I would say, ‘Hey, hey, hey,’” she told the magazine. “And one day he said it back to me in the same melody and I kept singing it and he kept following it over and over again.”\n\nAnd when it comes to singing to her kids, she relies more on the classics than her own hits.\n\n“Oh my gosh. There’s ‘Penguins Salute.’ There’s ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.’ Oh my gosh. RZA gets really emotional about that,” Rihanna told the outlet.\n\n“Yeah, and now he’s really into ‘Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes,’ she added. “‘The Wheels on the Bus’ is a favorite from the beginning till now. That’s just a classic. It’s never going out of style. And oh, the new ‘Incy-Wincy Spider,’ because he gets like, ‘Ahh,’ like he thinks I’m going to tickle him when I sing that one. And he has a book about that, so he can put two and two together.”\n\nHere’s a deeper look at the couple and their family.\n\nRZA Mayers\n\nRZA arrived in May 2022 and fans waited an entire year for the couple to reveal the little boy's name.\n\nRocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, shared an Instagram post in May 2023 honoring his little boy's first birthday. “WU TANG IZ 4 DA CHUREN. HAPPY 1st BIRTHDAY TO MY 1st BORN. RZA,\" he wrote alongside several family pics and a video of him holding his son.\n\nRZA's name was inspired by Wu-Tang Clan rapper RZA, whose real name is Robert Fitzgerald Diggs.\n\nTwo months later, Diggs told CNN that he was flattered that the couple was inspired by his name. “(It’s) a great honor to know that there’s another generation that’s not even of my own household that feels the strength and the inspiration of that name,” he said.\n\nHe added, “I salute (Rihanna) and A$AP and their family. All the blessings in the world from me.”\n\nBaby RZA made his debut on Rihanna's social media when she shared a TikTok video of him riding in a carseat in December 2022.\n\nIn March, she proudly shared her baby boy in pictures and a video showing him reacting to the music video of her song “Lift Me Up.”\n\nRZA appeared alongside his parents when the whole family posed for the cover of British Vogue.\n\nThe trio appeared together in a gorgeous beachside image for the March 2023 edition of the magazine. Rihanna, wearing a slinky black dress with a high slit, was seen walking in the sand ahead of Rocky, who cradled their baby boy in his arms while kissing the top of his head.\n\nWhile speaking to British Vogue in the accompanying interview, the self-made billionaire said she understood why people are fascinated by her relationship and their first child, but insisted she won't let RZA be exploited.\n\n“Throw me to the wolves. Do what you want with me. But he doesn’t have a say in any of this,” said Rihanna. “We’ve been protecting him thus far and you don’t have any consent to be posting photos or selling photos of my child, a minor. Get the hell out of here with that.\"\n\n“As parents it just feels so icky, like a violation,” she added.\n\nIn the same interview, Rihanna gushed about the \"connection\" she saw between Rocky and their son.\n\n“I’m just sitting on the sidelines when they’re together,” she said. “I’m literally the girl trying to get into the boys club, waiting for my turn. He is obsessed with his father. And I’m like: ‘Didn’t I give birth to you? What is going on?’\"\n\n“Their connection is undeniable,” she added. “The second Rocky makes eye contact with him he is on fire. The whole thing they say about sons and moms, it’s a myth. Sons and fathers is crazy. I realized that the validation that you really need as a boy is from your father.”\n\nRocky is clearly just as enamored. The rapper talked excitedly about being a first-time dad when he spoke to Complex in December 2022.\n\n“It’s beautiful. Honestly, I think fatherhood gives me more time to do exactly what I want. I don’t have time for anything that isn’t priorities,” he said. “I love it. Everything is just based around my newfound love for being a dad and a family man. It’s lit right now. I can’t even describe it.”\n\nRiot Rose Mayers\n\nThe Grammy winner announced she was expecting again during her Super Bowl halftime show performance on Feb. 12, 2023.\n\nThe singer gently placed her hands on her baby bump while performing a medley of her hits. After the show, Rihanna’s reps confirmed to NBC News that she and Rocky were expecting another baby.\n\nThe couple welcomed their second child, Riot Rose, in August 2023, a source close to the couple confirmed to NBC News at the time.\n\n“They are enjoying this special time and overwhelmed with happiness,” the source said.\n\nAccording to a birth certificate obtained by Access Hollywood in September 2023 and viewed by TODAY.com, the baby boy was born at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Aug. 1, 2023.\n\nHis name follows the tradition of “R” names in the family.\n\nRihanna told British Vogue she didn't have any preference when it comes to baby No. 2's gender.\n\n“Listen, I’m down for whatever. My wish would be I would like to have more kids but whatever God wants for me, I’m here,” she said. “Girl, boy. Whatever.”"
