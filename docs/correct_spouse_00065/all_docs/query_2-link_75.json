        "text": "They were teenage sweethearts before Chris Brown viciously attacked Rihanna, leaving her face beaten and bruised.\n\nThe world might not be ready to forgive Chris for his actions - but Rihanna has openly sent him messages of support and shown public displays of affection fuelling rumours they are back together.\n\nAnd following the picture of the dysfunctional couple cuddling up together on a night out, here's a complete timeline of their relationship from the first time they met in 2005 to rekindling their relationship in 2012.\n\nRihanna and Chris Brown: The complete timeline\n\n2005: Ladies and gentleman, pay attention because this is where it all began. It’s the first time Rihanna and Chris Brown were seen together under the bright lights of paparazzi camera bulbs and it happened at the Vibe Awards. Rihanna, then 17, introduced Chris, then 16, to the stage for him to perform his song Run It. It was pretty awkward to watch and everyone looked really young.\n\n2006: There wasn’t a great amount of picture evidence of them together this year but it was reported that during the Nickleodeon Kids Choice Awards they were hanging out and flirting like crazy. What else are teenagers supposed to do, huh?\n\nMay 2007: They were eventually pictured together later in the year celebrating Chris’ 18 birthday at the 40/40 Club – which is a properly swanky party place in Manhattan.\n\nSummer 2007: Chris and Rihanna haven’t been seen snogging or holding hands in public but they did the musical equivalent when they collaborated on a remix of Ri-Ri’s single Umbrella.\n\nSeptember 2007: Chris announced that his relationship status was “single and ready to mingle” – which we thought was a phrase only printed on tacky t-shirts or what Imogen Thomas would tweet before she settled down.\n\nHe did tell Us Magazine that his just mates with Rihanna and sure, they’ve flirted together but haven’t taken things to the next level. So, at this point there still hasn’t been any hanky panky or over/under top action.\n\nOctober 2007: Rihanna is linked to Josh Hartnett by a few US gossip websites. STOP, it’s too late to talk about what could have been…\n\nMarch 2008: Chris and Rihanna went out of their way to deny that they aren’t dating and using every interview to boast about how single they are – and probably how much mingling they’ve been doing. At the Kids Choice Awards, Rihanna stresses that they’re more like brother and sister than boyfriend and girlfriend. WHAT A CLASSIC.\n\nShe told MTV News: “We are best friends, honestly, like brother and sister.”\n\nMay 2008: The ‘siblings’ are spotted doing various couply-things such as canoodling, swimming and holidays together. Eventually Chris admits they’re taking their relationship to the next level. “Our relationship is growing. We started off as friends and we’re getting a little bit closer now,” he said.\n\nJune 2008: Not so fast, Chris! Rihanna has completely embarrassed you and denied the pair were dating during an appearance on The View. She claimed: “He’s an amazing person, but we are not dating. We’re very close friends though. Very, very close.” Sometime during 2008, the couple gave up pretending and revealed they were together to the shock of absolutely no-one.\n\nJuly 2008: Chris Brown reportedly told Rihanna to stop wearing revealing outfits because he’s worried it will attract too many male admirers. We’re pretty sure that’s what happens if you date one of the hottest women in the world.\n\nFebruary 2009: Rihanna and Chris Brown cancel their Grammy performances after reportedly being in a car accident. Following the incident, Chris turned himself in to the LAPD for questioning regarding charges of a felony (that’s criminal offence to us British types). At the time, the woman was unnamed but it was later revealed by TMZ to be Rihanna.\n\nChris was released on $50k bail and skipped a prison sentence by accepting 180 hours of community service. Oh, and Chris was given a restraining order from the court which means he isn’t allowed to contact Rihanna under any circumstances.\n\nJuly 2009: After five months of silence, Chris speaks out and finally says sorry. It’s through a YouTube video which you can watch below.\n\nLate 2009: Rihanna doesn’t like to talk about her post-attack recovery which is believed to have included a brief romance with rapper Drake. It was so brief in fact, that nobody really knows when it started and when it fizzled out.\n\n2010: Rihanna spoke about her time with Drake to MTV, she admits: “It was at a really fragile time in my life, so I just didn’t want to get too serious with anything or anyone at that time.” Probably the best thing to come out of their romance was the absolute tune they made together, What’s My Name, and the corresponding music video. The worst bit? Well, that’s still to come…\n\nLate 2010: Rihanna moves on to a new flame, this time it’s NBA star Matt Kemp. In Elle magazine she refers to him as a breath of fresh air. She says: “I have a boyfriend. I’m so happy. I feel really comfortable and it’s so easy. I have such a chaotic life but at the end of the day, that is just my peace. It keeps me sane, really, talking to him and talking to my family. Sadly, they began to lose interest in each other and blamed their ridiculously busy schedules on the split.\n\nJanuary 2011: Us Weekly runs a report claiming that Rihanna and Chris are secretly dating but a rep for ‘Breezy’ denied the pair were romantically involved, again.\n\nFeb 2011: During a court hearing in LA, a judge replaced Rihanna’s previous restraining order with a level one order. Which basically means that the ex-couple can talk to each other providing that this doesn’t “harass, annoy or molest” her. Rihanna didn’t attend the verdict but her attorney went on her behalf.\n\nMarch 2011: It probably isn’t the best way to show the world you’re rehabilitated from attacking your girlfriend, but nonetheless Chris full on kicked off on Good Morning America when asked about Rihanna. According to a number of US magazine, his explosive tantrum involved swearing, breaking things and storming off despite pre-agreeing to questions. After the incident, he tweeted: ‘I don't say s**t to anybody and everyone feels its cool to attack me. GROWN ADULTS!!!! that s**t happened three years ago! I know alot of you wack @ss(OLD) celebrities probably wanna f**k my ex but talking s**t on me wont get u far. MY MUSIC DOESNT PROMOTE VIOLENCE nor will it ever! only thing it will increase is the pregnacy rate!’ Um… yeah. Moving on, shall we?\n\nMay 2011: This is pretty massive if you think about it – even though it might not have been such a big deal a year ago. Chris and Rihanna begin following each other on Twitter. GASP. Users on the social networking site started to notice and fans of Ri-Ri began sending her messages or caution and concern – Rihanna replied: ‘It’s f****n’ Twitter… calm down.’\n\nFebruary 2012: Exactly three years after the assault, Chris is invited back to the Grammys and won Best R&B Album before performing some new music. Quite a lot of people argued that the awards show’s embrace of the controversial singer was tasteless and disgraceful. Buzzfeed posted a reaction from fans which included: ‘Chris Brown could beat me anytime he wanted to,’ which raised concern about Chris’ involvement. In reaction to the criticism, Chris tweeted (and sorry about the caps lock): ‘HATE ALL U WANT BECUZ I GOT A GRAMMY Now! That’s the ultimate F**K OFF.’ Charming, eh?\n\nFebruary 2012: Rihanna was fairly cryptic in her response to the drama and posted lyrics from her own song ‘Hard’. It read: \"They can say whatever, Ima do whatever... No pain is forever. Yup! YOU KNOW THIS.\"\n\nFebruary 2012: It was certainly a busy month for the pair and Chris reportedly attended Rihanna’s 24 birthday party. But what surprised us most was when they released remixes lending their voices to each other’s songs Rihanna sings on Chris’ ‘Turn Up The Music’ while he gives vocals on Rihanna’s track ‘Birthday Cake’.\n\nJune 10: The New York Post reported that Rihanna and Chris “sat together” at their celeb mate Jay-Z’s 40/40 party. A few eyebrows were raised and not least because Chris’ alleged girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, was not at the party. According to number of witnesses Chris and Rihanna also visited a nightclub together the same weekend.\n\nJune 14: Can you stretch your mind back to 2010 when we told you the worst bit with Drake was still to come for Chris? Well, this is it. The pair were allegedly involved in an altercation at the WIP nightclub in New York. Chris posted a picture of his gashed chin on Twitter and his attorney claims that Drake “threw glassware”.\n\nThere’s not been an official comment surrounding the details of the brawl but it’s rumoured that Chris sent his rival a bottle of champagne as a peace deal – which Drake returned with a note referencing his sexual history with Rihanna. Ouch. A source close to Rihanna told HollywoodLife that she was “distraught” over the altercation. The insider added: \"She clearly doesn't want anyone fighting and especially not over her.”\n\nJuly: Rihanna spoke about how hard she finds it to let people in after having her heart stomped on before. Talking to US Harper’s Bazaar magazine, the 24-year-old said, \"I'm rebellious through my music, my fashion, tattoos and my hair. I have been conservative in my love life...it's pretty much nonexistent. If I come across someone who I find really cool, I'll hang out. But the minute I find that we're getting too close I just...I don't let people in.\"\n\nJuly 24: Chris and Rihanna are both seen in St.Tropez at the same time. While some gossip sites claimed that Chris was spotted on Rihanna’s yacht, a rep denied the allegations and said it was a coincidence they were in the same place at the same time. “CB is in France to shoot a music video for Swizz Beatz album and Ludacris is in it. It's Swizz's song,” a person paid to speak on his behalf told X17Online.\n\nAnd despite rumours that Chris and his girlfriend Karrueche who looks ridiculously like Rihanna have split up, the inside says otherwise. \"Karrueche is there with him...They never broke up. He is not on her (Rihanna's) yacht. There is no Rihanna connection.”\n\nAnd Rihanna’s Tweets over the last couple of days haven’t exactly helped. Just as Chris landed: “Touch down baby, help me pick out my fit / Don't let company choose you... CHOOSE YOUR COMPANY! / Love is the easy part... Respect? Now that's some impressive s**t!!! #1Love / I wanna dance with somebody who loves me.” But the post that makes us shudder most is this: “#3words lastnight was beautiful.”\n\nAugust 11: \"It was embarrassing. It was humiliating. I lost my best friend,\" Rihanna tells Oprah on the show. And she also says that things got pretty 'dark' following the assault, which happened on the eve of the Grammy Awards in 2009. \"I was resentful. I held a grudge. I was dark,\" she confesses.\n\nAugust 16: Rihanna admits she was \"more concerned\" about Chris Brown after he attacked her. She tells Oprah: “I felt like the only person they hate right now is him. It was a weird, confusing space to be in. Because as angry as I was - as angry and hurt and betrayed - I just felt like he made that mistake because he needed help. And who's going to help him? Nobody's going to say he needs help, everybody's going to say he's a monster, without looking at the source. And I was more concerned about him.”\n\nAugust 18: Rihanna’s emotional interview with Oprah continues and the host admits she’s surprised that Rihanna “talks a lot, a lot, a lot about you know who, Mr. Chris Brown.” The popstar also admits to missing the man who has previously attacked her. “I am reminded by a lot of things. A lot of good memories we had. By the slightest things; hotel rooms, tour venues, any little thing, music, songs, and I do miss him at times.”\n\nAugust 20: In the biggest sign of forgiveness, Rihanna tells Oprah she still loves Chris and he’s the love of her life. “We built a trust again and that's it. We love each other and we probably always will.” She told continued and struggled to get her words out while crying, “We've been working on our friendship again and now we're very close friends,” she said.\n\n“And that's not anything we're going to try to change. It's awkward because I still love him. My stomach drops and I have to maintain this poker face and not let it get to the outer part of me. I have to maintain it and suppress it. When you don't understand those feelings you can make a lot of mistakes.”\n\nChris is now with model Karrueche Tran and Rihanna acknowledged their relationship but still said: “I think he is the love of my life. He was my first love.” We have a bad feeling about the way this could end up.\n\nSeptember 7: When Rihanna left the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards - after scooping a gong for video of the year - she spotted Chris from across the room. She walked over and hugged him before patting Chris on his bleach-blonde head before strolling off in complete calmness. In one picture, it appears to show Rihanna kissing Chris on the lips. She might have thought that the cameras had cut away from her as the broadcast began to show the next segment of the two-hour ceremony, but the embrace was caught by ‘all access’ filming.\n\nSeptember 11: Woah, what’s going on here? Chris Brown’s got a new tattoo that appears to resemble a sick tribute to Rihanna’s bruises after he attacked her. It left everyone speechless as to why on earth he would ever get this image permanently inked on his neck, but Chris has since denied the tattoo is a recreation of Rihanna’s injuries. His rep said the ink was inspired by a MAC cosmetics design of a skull associated with the Mexican celebration of the Day of the Dead.\n\nSeptember 12: You would have thought Rihanna would distance herself somewhat from her ex after the tattoo scandal but instead she made another sign of unity. This time she copied Chris’ style by wearing a gold mouth guard over her teeth.\n\nSeptember 15: They continue to communicate with ink. This time Chris decides to get an almost identical looking tattoo to Rihanna. See for yourself...\n\nSeptember 25: Ahead of a progress report hearing which was to determine whether Chris had violated the terms of his probation for the 2009 beating of Rihanna, she tweeted him messages of support. Weird. Yet not only did Rihanna get in touch with Chris before the court appearance, she did it for everyone to see over Twitter.\n\nShe wrote: 'I'm praying for you and wishing u the best today!' And Chris responded: 'Thank u so much.' Not content with that, Rihanna then tapped out another tweet, which read: 'Praying for you baby, my best wishes are with you today! Remember that whatever God does in our lives, it is WELL DONE!!! #1Love'\n\nSeptember 27: We're going to launch right into this one: Nicole Scherzinger was spotted putting her lips on what looks a lot like Chris Brown's lips and then doing some kind of standing-up-spooning and we don't know what's going on but we're 97% certain that we don't like it. The pair were helping to host the Supperclub's Black Diamond Pyramid party in LA, when an insider claims she saw them making out in front of the whole room.\n\nThe gossip equivalent of Sherlock Holmes said: “She put her head on his shoulder and they started kissing! I couldn't believe Chris was being so obvious about it!\" Chris Brown's rep denied it, of course, saying: “They were not kissing. They are friends, have been for years and were talking at a club that had loud music playing.”\n\nOctober 4: TMZ are reporting that both Rihanna and Chris were seen leaving the same hotel before they spent the night together at a Jay-Z concert. They were pictured next to each other in the VIP section watching their celeb mate doing a bit of rapping. It doesn’t show anything saucy or really intimate that would all but confirm they are back together but Chris DOES have his arm around Rihanna. Or her chair at least. We all know that this is the first phase of making a move, right? In the middle of all this drama, Chris’ ‘current’ girlfriend Karrueche tweeted: ‘Bye baby’.\n\nOctober 4: Chris Brown has officially broken up with his girlfriend Karrueche Tran after she grew tired of his cavorting with his ex Rihanna. He released a statement saying: \"I have decided to be single to focus on my career. I love Karrueche very much but I don't want to see her hurt over my friendship with Rihanna. I'd rather be single allowing us to both be happy in our lives.\"\n\nOctober 5: And it still develops...Chris has released an emotional video where he talks about their relationship. He says: \"When you share history with somebody, then you tend to fall in love with somebody else, it’s kind of difficult. That's right, it's difficult - and poor Chris, because he's \"just being real\" and he \"don't want to hurt either or.\"Oh yes, it carries on...\"I'm not trying to be a player, I just care too much sometimes.\" click here for Chris's video on their relationship.\n\nOctober 9: Rihanna's dad has given Chris his blessing. \"I think everyone makes mistakes and they shouldn’t be held to them forever. Everyone should be forgiven once. There’s a lot more to Chris than the whole world knows,\" he told InTouch magazine. \"I love Chris, man. He’s got so much charisma. And he’s always had so much respect for me. That’s what I love about him. He’s always shown me respect.”\n\nOctober 14: Rihanna and Chris are ready to make their relationship public, according to HollywoodLife, but Ri-Ri's got to finish her album Unapologetic first. A source told US gossip site HollywoodLife: \"She is hitting the studio real hard these days, but talks to Chris every step of the way. As soon as she finishes up with this album, they will be out. She gotta focus and get that album together and stay paid.\"\n\nOctober 22: A video taken from a mole inside a Beverly Hills party shows Rihanna looking comfortable with Chris while an onlooker told HollywoodLife: “They kissed a few times and were holding hands for a minute. He made sure he claimed her and made her feel comfortable. “He was a gentleman — don’t worry. He made sure he was by her side the whole night just like when they first met back in the day.”\n\nOctober 23: Chris Brown's life is becoming more complicated than Lindsay Lohan's at the moment - we're struggling to keep up. Just as we thought that ex-girlfriend Karrueche was out of the picture - he's been spotted hanging out with her again. She was snapped leaving Chris' mansion and getting a few quid (bucks) off his bodyguard for petrol (gas).\n\nNovember 2: After a court hearing, it was decided that Chris Brown remains under supervision for the 2009 assault on Rihanna and was given permission to go on a world tour by the judge. He was told he must return to court for a progress report when he finishes the tour.\n\nNovember 7: A sneak peak of Rihanna's new album was posted online and it features a collaboration with Chris Brown - the album is called Unapologetic and you can listen to that over here.\n\nNovember 9: Rihanna denies being back together with Chris Brown but admits he's \"kinda alright\". When asked if they were back together during a Facebook Live interview, she revealed: \"We're not together. If I had it my way, it would be really nobody's business.”\n\nNovember 23: She hinted at plans to hook up with Chris Brown when she posted a picture of herself on-board a private jet with the caption ‘see you soon, lover’. And Rihanna made the not-so-subtle hint and made the decision to spend Thanksgiving partying with Chris.\n\nNovember 26:Chris Brown has deleted his Twitter account following a disgusting attack on a woman who hit out at the star over his violent past. He had been having a pretty good day, with Rihanna tweeting a snap of him in bed - essentially confirming their romance. But when someone responded to another of his tweets in a negative manner, it's safe to say the singer lost it. Like, really lost it. See what he said here.\n\nNovember 30: She posted this picture (below) on her Instagram page with the caption: “[Chris] i dont wanna leave!!! Killed it tonight baby!!!” After just two hours of being online, the photo received more than 200k 'likes'. And if this cuddly snapshot wasn’t enough to spark controversy, she posted another photo with the phrase: “Home is where the c*ck is.”"
