        "text": "A clip of Sean “Diddy” Combs reacting to the abusive incident involving Chris Brown and Rihanna in 2009 has resurfaced amid leaked hotel footage of his 2016 assault of Cassie Ventura making headlines.\n\nIn the wake of the altercation, the rap mogul appeared on Ellen DeGeneres’ daytime talk show. During the interview, Combs addressed the situation between Rihanna and Brown, the latter of whom was arrested and faced public backlash for assaulting the pop star.\n\nAt the time, the impresario refused to cast aspersions or blame on either party, instead sharing his belief that neither gender should be physically abusive towards their romantic partners. “I don’t think that it’s right for anybody to hit anybody at the end of the day, you know,” the Bad Boy Records founder said. “I don’t think it’s right.\n\nCombs then cryptically warned that romantic pairings can become tense at times, and that the public is often unaware of what transpires between couples behind closed doors. “You know, I think that we all have to be honest with ourselves as adults and people that have been in relationships,” he continued.\n\n“We know sometimes those relationships get ugly, you know. Sometimes, it doesn’t come out into the forefront the way this one has come out. There’s a lot of stones being thrown, and we don’t know exactly what’s going on. These are two young individuals. We need to pray for them, and we need to give certain support.”\n\nThe Mt. Vernon native continued to imply that, at times, both parties can spur an altercation to become physical, seemingly speculating that Rihanna may have played a role in provoking Brown’s assault. “But you don’t need to start just saying that you know something that you don’t know,” Combs added.\n\n“You wasn’t in that car, I wasn’t in that car, and it isn’t right for him to put his hands on her or her to put [her] hands on him. We don’t know what the problem is, but we need to pray for them, and we need to do things to support them. And that’s all I wanna say about it.”\n\nCombs has come under fire after video of him chasing down Ventura and viscously striking and kicking her was released by CNN, resulting in the once esteemed mogul becoming a social pariah, with a number of his celebrity friends having since distanced themselves from him. In addition to allegations of physical abuse, Combs is accused of sexually assaulting multiple victims, many of whom have filed lawsuits against the hitmaker.\n\nSee Sean “Diddy” Combs’ appearance on The Ellen Show below."
