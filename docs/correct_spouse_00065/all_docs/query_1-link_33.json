        "text": "In her most on-record conversation in quite a while, Rihanna opened up to Interview magazine about the start of her relationship with A$AP Rocky, their life now as parents of two, and their future.\n\nSpeaking with editor in chief Mel Ottenberg, the “Diamonds” singer said getting together with Rocky is “the best thing that ever happened to us.” The two have been friends since 2012, but did not become romantic until 2019. Their love blossomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in May 2022, they welcomed their first child, baby boy RZA. Then, just over a year later, on August 2023, the pop singer gave birth to their second son, Riot Rose.\n\nSpeaking of her soulmate relationship with Rocky, Rihanna said: “I let God lead and just let go. Because in previous relationships, I tried and tried and tried my best, and you still feel like it’s not enough.” She continued, “So when someone sees you completely, and believes in you, and thinks you’re worthy of being the mother of their kids, it’s a great feeling. I felt the same about him. I knew he would be a great dad.”\n\nWhen Ottenberg asked how many more kids she may want with her partner, Rihanna said simply: “As many as God wants me to have.”\n\nShe added, “I don’t know what God wants, but I would go for more than two. I would try for my girl. But of course if it’s another boy, it’s another boy.”\n\nYou Might Also Like"
