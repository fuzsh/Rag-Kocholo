        "text": "While they’ve been friends for nearly a decade, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky began sparking relationship rumors in late 2020. Rocky pretty much declared his love for Rih in a 2021 interview with GQ, and to be honest, this is the power couple of all power couples. Then, at the beginning of 2022, the couple shared that they are expecting their first child together (!!) and later that spring, they officially welcomed their baby boy. Following Rih's iconic Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2023, she announced that they're welcoming baby no. 2.\n\nIf you’re wondering how these two met and how their friendship turned into something more, read our comprehensive timeline of Rihanna and A$AP Rocky’s relationship. Below, we unpack everything we know so far.\n\nJune 22, 2023: A$AP Rocky Called Rihanna His “Wife”\n\nAfter attending the Louis Vuitton Spring 2024 Menswear Fashion Show in Paris, A$AP and Rihanna jet-setted to the French Riviera for A$AP’s Spotify Beach concert in Cannes. Rihanna made a surprise appearance at the show, where A$AP reportedly called her his “wife” (!!) in a sweet shout-out.\n\n“I’d like to dedicate this song to my beautiful wife in the motherf–king building!,” the rapper announced to the crowd during his second set, according to Page Six. What does this mean?!\n\nRihanna, who is pregnant with the couple’s second baby, watched the show with friends from a balcony, dressed in a sheer bump-baring dress.\n\nMay 1, 2023: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky Close Out the 2023 Met Gala Red Carpet\n\nOn the First Monday in May, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky arrived to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s famed carpeted steps fashionably late. Although fans worried that the couple were skipping fashion’s biggest night, the couple closed out the red carpet just after 10:00pm EST, dressed in stunning interpretations of this year’s theme, “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.”\n\nEn route to the event, RiRi donned a fur coat from Fendi’s Fall 1997 collection. The superstar evidently changed in the car, as she then arrived on the red carpet in a gorgeous white Maison Valentino gown, complete with a floral appliqué cape, dramatic train, and bodice that showed off her growing baby bump. She accessorized with cat-eye sunglasses (yes, with fake eyelashes attached) and Bulgari diamonds. Meanwhile, Rocky paid homage to Lagerfeld’s signature look with a black tuxedo jacket, white shirt, and tie, and a tartan skirt over bedazzled jeans. Absolutely worth the wait. 😍\n\nMarch 12, 2023: A$AP Rocky and Rihanna Pull Up in Style at the Oscars\n\nRihanna is booked 👏 and 👏 busy 👏 after her historic Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. The hitmaker performed her Black Panther: Wakanda Forever power ballad, \"Lift Me Up\" at the 95th Academy Awards and arrived at the coveted event solo. She wore a brown Alaïa gown with a sheer top over her pregnant belly.\n\nDuring her powerful performance, Rocky cheered Rih on from the crowd. The couple then reunited backstage, where she wore a stunning mint green outfit that showed off her glowing baby bump.\n\nFebruary 25, 2023: Rihanna Steps Out in Melon-Colored Satin Dress With A$AP Rocky in Milan\n\nIt's round two of Rihanna's maternity style diaries, and we are 100% here for it. Rih and Rocky hit up Milan Fashion Week then headed out on the town for dinner at Langosteria Bistrot. Per images obtained by W Magazine, Rih rocked a melon-colored satin halter dress and paired it with a rusted orange bomber jacket. She accessorized with a mini white fur handbag and strappy heels while Rocky wore light-wash blue jeans, square-toed boots, and a leather jacket. If this couple's going to do anything, it's stepping out in style.\n\nFebruary 15, 2023: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky Cover British Vogue With Their Firstborn Son\n\nFresh off the announcement of her second pregnancy, Rihanna hit the cover of British Vogue with A$AP Rocky and their firstborn son. In the cover story, Rih opened up about how being a parent is \"legendary\" and how her life has changed since welcoming her 9-month-old son into the world.\n\n\"It's everything. You really don't remember life before, that's the craziest thing ever,” she told the publication. \"You literally try to remember it – and there are photos of my life before – but the feeling, the desires, the things that you enjoy, everything, you just don't identify with it because you don't even allow yourself mentally to get that far, because…Because it doesn't matter.\"\n\nAs far as her relationship dynamic with Rocky goes, RiRi says parenthood has brought them closer together. \"We have to be on the same page, but we've always kind of had that in our relationship,\" the Grammy-winner said. \"Everything changes when you have a baby but I wouldn't say it's done anything but made us closer.\"\n\nFebruary 12, 2023: Rihanna Announces She’s Pregnant With Her Second Child During Super Bowl Halftime Show\n\nIt’s official: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are expecting their second child together! The Grammy Award-winning artist announced the news during her 2023 Super Bowl Halftime Show, as she performed a 12-song set that included hits from her decades-long career, including “Only Girl in the World,” “Rude Boy,” and “Diamonds.” She’s the first pregnant woman to headline the halftime stage ever.\n\nRihanna revealed her baby bump in a red bodysuit and latex bandeau, layered under a red jumpsuit. According to People, A$AP supported the star from the sidelines, recording her performance and singing and dancing along to the epic show. ❤️\n\nJanuary 18, 2023: A$AP Says Rihanna's \"Back Making Music Again\"\n\nNot only is Rihanna preparing for her first public performance since the 2018 Grammy at this year's Super Bowl Halftime Show, but the Anti singer is also gearing up to release new music, too. Rihanna's boyfriend, A$AP Rocky, opened up on about his excitement over her return to music. \"I'm so glad that my lady's back making music again and whatnot and getting back out there,\" he said. \"It's just incredible.\"\n\nThe \"D.M.B.\" rapper gushed about Rihanna's upcoming performance. \"The Super Bowl is huge, and her being the creative she is, she going to bring it, man. I'm excited. I'm more excited than everybody else, honestly.\"\n\nAlong with talking about their careers, A$AP explained how \"unexplainable\" fatherhood is. \"It's just one of those things,\" he began. \"I'm a member of our club now, like the dad club. You see a dad, you see me... I'm a full dad now.\"\n\nFor A$AP, fatherhood brings unspeakable joy that inspires him. \"You come home to heaven every day. I'm so thankful. God is good, man.\"\n\nJanuary 10, 2023: Rihanna and A$AP Make Attend the Golden Globe Awards\n\nSure, everyone is talking about the most buzzed-about films and TV shows after Tuesday night’s Golden Globe Awards — but we’re booked and busy thinking about the *incredible* Schiaparelli Couture gown that Rihanna wore to the ceremony.\n\nThe artist was nominated for Best Original Song for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’s “Lift Me Up.” This was Rihanna’s first nom, and she made her Golden Globes debut in a black, strapless velvet dress from the fashion house that featured dramatic sleeves, bustier detailing, and a short train. She complemented the glam look with black opera gloves, a statement drop-diamond necklace, and chic stilettos.\n\nA$AP attended the ceremony alongside his GF, dressed in a classic Bottega Veneta suit and accessorized with diamond earrings. The couple skipped the red carpet for Hollywood’s big event, opting instead to head straight into The Beverly Hilton hotel.\n\nDecember 17, 2022: Rihanna Shares First Look of Her Son\n\nOn Saturday, Rihanna shared an adorable first look at her baby boy, who she welcomed with A$AP Rocky this past May. The seven-month-old was introduced to the world on TikTok, in Rihanna’s very first video on the social media platform. “Hacked,” she captioned the post. The happy baby is seen in a car seat, as Rihanna laughs and talks to him in the background.\n\nNovember 11, 2022: Rihanna Reportedly Wants to Have More Children With A$AP Rocky\n\nRihanna seems to have caught \"baby fever\" and reportedly wants to have more children with A$AP Rocky with whom she already has one son.\n\nAn insider told Entertainment Tonight that the Super Bowl LVII headliner has “dreamed of being a mom,” and would “love nothing more” than to expand her family with the rapper in the coming years.\n\n“Rihanna and A$AP are so in love and have the best time together,” the source added. “They are also a great team when it comes to being parents to their baby boy. Rihanna always dreamed of being a mom and she takes a lot of pride in it. She would love to have more children with A$AP in the future.”\n\nAugust 3, 2022: A Source Reveals How Rihanna and A$AP Rocky's Perception of Fame Has Changed Since Becoming Parents\n\nAn anonymous source told Entertainment Tonight how Rihanna and A$AP Rocky's perception of fame has changed since they welcomed their baby boy in May. In an attempt to protect the baby and their privacy, the new parents haven't shared any details or posted any pics online.\n\n\"They're keeping things low-key so they can enjoy their little family,\" the source said. \"Privacy has become increasingly important to the couple. When it was just the two of them, they'd go out all hours of the day and night and interact with fans. Now, with the baby, they're a little more protective.\"\n\nPer ET, Rih is currently on maternity leave and won't be back to work for a little while — at this point, we've held on to hope for #R9 for long enough, so what's a little longer? \"She's one of the hardest working people out there, and she can definitely have it all,\" the source told ET. \"[She'll] be a hands-on mom and have an impressive career.\"\n\nMay 23, 2022: A Source Shares Which Parent Rihanna and A$AP Rocky's Son Looks Like\n\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky haven't shared any photos of their newborn son online just yet.\n\nAccording to In Touch, \"not many people\" have met the couple's baby, but Rihanna and A$AP have \"excitedly FaceTimed friends with him.\" A source close to the duo revealed which features the newborn got from each of his parents. \"He’s a cross between the two of them and is absolutely tiny,\" the source said. \"In some lights, he looks like A$AP and in others, Rihanna. He has got Rihanna’s eyes!\"\n\nMay 19, 2022: Rihanna Spotted for the First Time Since Welcoming Her Baby Boy\n\nRihanna is officially in her hot mom era. The singer and beauty mogul was spotted out in public for the first time since giving birth to her son on May 13. TMZ obtained pics of Rihanna rocking an oversized gray sweatshirt and baggy pants as she left her West Hollywood home and entered an SUV.\n\nMay 13, 2022: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky Welcome Their Baby Boy\n\nCongrats are in order for the new parents! TMZ reported on May 19 that Rih and A$AP welcomed a baby boy on May 13 in Los Angeles, but no name has been revealed.\n\nAccording to an ET source, “Before Rihanna gave birth, A$AP was super involved and was asking his friends for parenting advice. He wants to be the best dad possible and continue to take care of Rihanna. He's really looking forward to raising their baby boy together.”\n\nThe couple reportedly has not left each other’s side since the birth of their first child, with the source explaining that \"they are over the moon. [Rihanna’s] been looking forward to motherhood for a long time. This little boy is going to have the best baby fashion.”\n\nThe source tells ET that Rihanna and A$AP are hoping to travel to New York so that their newborn son can meet both artists’ families.\n\nMay 05, 2022: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky Get Married in \"D.M.B\" Video\n\nEver wonder what Rihanna would look like as a bride? Well, the Anti songstress put those questions to rest when she starred in her boyfriend, A$AP Rocky's new \"D.M.B,\" music video. Shot in New York City last summer, \"Das Ma Bish\" follows the couple as they navigate through ride-or-die scenarios. Despite hiccups, like Rocky going to jail, the couple's love ultimately conquers all with them tying the knot while rocking \"Will You Marry Me\" and \"I Do\" grillz.\n\nRocky, who directed the video, took to Instagram, thanking his \"lady\" Rihanna for her assistance in the video. \"$PECIAL THANK$ 2 MY LADY FOR THE MOTIVATION & ROLE,\" he wrote.\n\nApril 23, 2022: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky Step Out in LA After Rocky's Arrest\n\nRihanna and Rocky stepped out for dinner with friends on Saturday in Santa Monica, California. According to People, a source disclosed that \"it was a happy and relaxed group.\"\n\n\"Rihanna looked great. She sat next to A$AP and they were affectionate,\" they continued. \"They dined for a couple of hours. The focus was very much on Rihanna and the baby.\"\n\nRihanna, once again, rocked a stunning look. She wore a black bra underneath an open white button down shirt and black jacket that bared her bump. She paired the sequined bra with matching shorts, and open-toe stiletto pumps. Meanwhile, Rocky wore a gray T-shirt underneath a floral-detailed hoodie and jeans.\n\nThis was the first time the couple was spotted in public together following A$AP Rocky's arrest at Los Angeles International Airport on Wednesday, April 20. After having just landed on a private plane from Barbados, the rapper was detained in connection to a November 2021 shooting. He was soon released on a $550,000 bail.\n\nMarch 20, 2022: Rihanna and Rocky Spark Engagement Rumors\n\nCould Rihanna and A$AP Rocky be headed down the aisle?
