Riot was born on 3rd August 2023.\n\nShe showcased her second pregnancy for the first time in February 2023 at the Super Bowl, where she was assumed to be past the three-month mark.\n\nRiri went on to display her growing baby bump on red carpets and multiple outings, reviving her title as a maternity style icon for a second time."
