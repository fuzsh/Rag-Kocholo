This stuff makes me mad. It is a cycle of abuse. He will hit her again, then they will have this big make up and life will be great and \"perfect\" for awhile, then he will abuse her again and it will keep going like that until she gets a backbone!\n\nI knew this would happen though. Not the married part, but the getting back together. Abusers use manipulation and control to make it seem like their victim can't/won't be able to live without them. He probably swept her off her feet, bought her a ton of crap and swore it wouldn't happen again. He probably isolates her from friends and family as well. I doubt her family was at the wedding. How sad.\n\nalatham:\n\nsome people just become idiots when they fall in love.\n\nIf he is truly an abuser, than it is not love and cannot just be swept away by claiming she is an idiot in love. She is most likely being manipulated and controlled by him. He probably makes her feel very insecure and like she can't live without him. That IS NOT LOVE."
