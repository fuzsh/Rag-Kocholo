        "text": "Diamond Brown\n\nInstagram model and influencer Diamond Brown welcomed Chris Brown's third child in January 2022.\n\nDiamond revealed the first photo of the baby, who weighed in 6 pounds, 9 ounces, on Instagram, the captioning the post:\n\n\"The princess is here! Lovely Symphani Brown ðŸ¤Ž My sweet babygirl, itâ€™s been a whole day youâ€™ve been in the world and have already shown me the true meaning of life. I promise to love and protect you always. Forever yours, mommy\".\n\nRumours surfaced in late 2021 that Chris was expecting his third child with Diamond.\n\nDiamond announced her pregnancy in the September of that year, documenting her pregnancy journey on Instagram without revealing the father of her child.\n\nChris and Diamond were previously romantically linked after being photographed together by paparazzi, and Chris was spotted liking some of Diamond's pictures in Instagram.\n\nAmmika Harris\n\nChris Brown was first linked to model Ammika Harris back in 2015, with the pair later rekindling their romance in 2019 after being spotted in Paris together.\n\nThe pair kept their romance relatively under wraps before rumours circulated that Ammika was expecting Breezy's baby.\n\nTheir son, Aeko Catori, was born in November 2019. Chris and Ammika aren't thought to be in a romantic relationship anymore, but appear to be great friends as they co-parent Aeko together.\n\nGina V. Huynh\n\nChris was rumoured to be dating model Gina V. Huynh, who is rumoured to have dated Diddy in the past, around October 2020.\n\nThe pair were spotted in London together during Breezy's first trip to the UK since his 2009 ban, but it appears they called things off soon after.\n\nIndyamarie\n\nChris and model Indyamarie are thought to have started dating after meeting on the set of the singer's music video for 'Type A Way' in 2019.\n\nLittle is know about their alleged romance, but it's thought the pair called things off after news surfaced that Chris was expecting a child with Ammika Harris.\n\nAgnez Mo\n\nChris Brown was linked to Indonesian singer Agnez Mo after photos surfaced of the pair looking very cosy in the studio together.\n\nRumours of romance quickly began flying, but after they released their collaboration 'Overdose' in July 2018, they slowly fizzled out.\n\nVanessa Vargas\n\nChris Brown dated model Vanessa Vargas in early 2017. Letting the world know about his beau, Breezy even posted a photo of the model in lingerie on his Instagram page.\n\nThe pair were spotted in public on multiple dates, but things appeared to cool off after Chris commented on one of ex-girlfriend Rihanna's posts, wishing her mother a happy birthday.\n\nNia Guzman\n\nChris Brown was dating then-girlfriend Karrueche Tran when it emerged that the singer was expecting a child with model Nia Guzman.\n\nBrown and Tran swiftly split following Brown's infidelity, and Nia gave birth to their daughter Royalty in May 2014.\n\nThe pair were never officially together but appear to successfully coparent their daughter.\n\nDraya Michele\n\nBack in 2011, Chris Brown reportedly dated model Draya Michele for around nine months, before Breezy moved onto Karrueche Tran.\n\nDraya and Karrueche were friends at the time, causing confusion amongst fans. However, Draya confirmed that she and Brown were just friends and that she had total respect for Karrueche.\n\nKarrueche Tran\n\nChris started dating model and actress Karrueche Tran in 2011, and the pair shared an on-off relationship over the next few years.\n\nThey briefly broke up when Brown reconciled with his ex-girlfriend, Rihanna, but they got back together when that relationship ended.\n\nIn March 2015, Karrueche tweeted that she was leaving Brown for good after it emerged that he was expecting a child with Nia Guzman.\n\nTran was granted a temporary restraining order against Brown in 2017 after she accused him of being physically and emotionally abusive. She was granted a 5-year restraining order against Brown later that year.\n\nRihanna\n\nArguably his most well-known relationship, Chris started dating Rihanna in 2007 until their highly-publicised domestic violence case in 2009.\n\nIn his 2017 documentary Welcome to My Life, Breezy claimed he intended to marry Rihanna prior to the incident.\n\nThe couple rekindled their romance in 2012 - even collaborating on music together - but later split."
