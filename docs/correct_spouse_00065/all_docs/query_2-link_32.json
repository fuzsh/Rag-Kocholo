        "text": "Chris Brown’s new documentary Chris Brown: Welcome to My Life was released on Aug. 8, and on Monday (Aug. 14), a clip of the documentary was shared online of the R&B artist giving his perspective of the night he was arrested for physically assaulting Rihanna back in 2009.\n\nIn the new video, Brown details his romance with Rihanna from the time they met — when they were just teenagers — to the time their relationship became destructive. Brown said after he told the “Work” singer that he slept with another woman early in their relationship, things took a turn for the worse.\n\n“After that, my trust was lost with her. She hated me after that,” he admitted. “I tried everything, she didn’t care. She just didn’t trust me after that. From there, it just went downhill because there were too many verbal fights, physical fights as well. Mutual sides. We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was okay.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nPointing out that they both realized how dysfunctional their relationship had become, Brown continued, “There was always a point where we’d talk about it like, ‘What the f–k are we doing? Like, ‘I don’t like you slapping me.’ If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, ‘Oh, no I fell.’ If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on. I’m not ever trying to put my hands on any female.”\n\nMost of their issues weren’t public until things came to a head before the Clive Davis Grammy party in 2009. Brown gives his side in the documentary, explaining that the woman he slept with early in their relationship approached the couple at the event — which was very upsetting for Rihanna. Later in the night, Brown said he told Rihanna to look at his phone to deny that he had a relationship with the woman in question and the singer actually happened to see a message from her.\n\n“She starts going off, she throws the phone,” he said. “I hate you.’ Starts hitting me. We’re in a little Lamborghini. She’s fighting me. I’m like, ‘Look, I’m telling you the truth, I swear’… She hits me a couple of more times and it doesn’t go from translation to, ‘Let’s sit down, I’m telling you the truth.’ It goes to, ‘Now, I’m going to be mean, be evil.’ I remember she tried to kick me, but then I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her. I busted her lip. When I saw it, I was in shock. I was like, ‘F–k, why the hell did I hit her?’”\n\nBrown said that after Rihanna spit blood into his face, he became “enraged even more” and when he two pulled over, Rihanna pretended to throw his car keys, and once Brown went looking for them was when she yelled, “Help, he’s trying to kill me.”\n\nThough Brown insists that the two were both fighting and he loved her at the time, he now says, “I look back at that picture and I’m like that’s not me, bro, that’s not me. I hate it to this day. That’s going to haunt me forever.”"
