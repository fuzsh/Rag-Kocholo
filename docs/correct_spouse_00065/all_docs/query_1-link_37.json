        "text": "Rakim Mayers, better known as A$AP Rocky, was arrested Wednesday at Los Angeles International Airport in connection with a shooting in November, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nMayers was arriving on a private plane from Barbados, where he had been on vacation with his girlfriend, the singer Rihanna.\n\nAccording to multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the matter, Rihanna was with Mayers when he was arrested, and a search warrant has been executed at Mayers’ residence in Los Angeles.\n\nMayers' attorney, Alan Jackson, confirmed that his client had been arrested.\n\nMayers was booked into jail at 12:42 p.m. and bail was set at $550,000, according to the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department booking report.\n\nHe was released less than three hours later after posting bond, the records show, and has a court date set for Aug. 17.\n\nMayers is the suspect in a Nov. 6 shooting near Vista Del Mar and Selma Avenue around 10:20 p.m., according to the LAPD.\n\nThe shooting victim later told police that Mayers, who was walking with two others, approached him with a handgun on the street. The victim claimed Mayers shot at him three to four times and that he believed one of the bullets grazed his left hand, according to police reports.\n\nThe shooting had not yet been reported in the media. In a statement on Twitter after publication of this article, police gave details of the November incident and said: \"Early this morning, LAPD officers arrested Mayers for assault with a deadly weapon (firearm) at the Los Angeles International Airport. The case will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for filing consideration.\"\n\nPolice said the shooting occurred after an argument between two acquaintances escalated.\n\nPolice made the arrest with assistance from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations team.In January, Rihanna, announced that she was pregnant with her first child. In March, she told the magazine Elle she was in her third trimester. She turned 34 in February.\n\nIn 2019, Mayers, now 33, was arrested in Sweden after a fight on the street between his entourage and two men. Then-President Donald Trump fought for his release, warning Sweden it would face negative consequences if he was not freed.\n\nHe was convicted of assault, given a suspended prison sentence and had to pay more than $1,000 in damages. He served a month in jail before the sentence was handed down, so he did not have to serve any additional time.\n\nRepresentatives for A$AP Rocky and Rihanna did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
