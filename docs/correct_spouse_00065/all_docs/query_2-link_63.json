        "text": "Chris Brown transformed from a wholesome R&B teen superstar with Michael Jackson potential to a more wicked pop culture villain when he received his first criminal offense: a battery charge for assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna. Since then, assault and battery charges have peppered the last several years of his public image, particularly accusations from women who have filed police reports against the singer and dancer. This week, he was arrested on suspicion for assault with a deadly weapon, reminding us that Brown’s dangerous history against women is never too far behind him – and it constantly threatens to stall his music career he has continued to pursue. Here, we look back at a timeline of accusations and run-ins with the law."
