        "text": "Chris Brown is the hunky vet who’s taken Australia by storm since first hitting screens on Harry’s Practice nearly two decades ago.\n\nAnd with a charming personality, movie-star good looks and an enviable career, it’s no surprise the TV personality has a slew of female admirers chasing after him.\n\nWhile the vet has remained notoriously private about his personal life over the years, he hasn’t been able to avoid eagle-eyed photographers spotting him on rumoured dates around Sydney.\n\n“I’ve never been that guy going around boasting, especially about who I’m dating,” he told TV WEEK in 2018. At the time, he said those closest to him “know everything going on”, while everyone else can “speculate”.\n\nChris told Stellar in 2019 that turning 40 and realising he hadn’t found ‘the one’ was a huge wake-up call for him.\n\n“If you’d told me at 20 I’d be unmarried and without kids, I probably would’ve been horrified. But it’s my doing. I’ve probably prioritised work more than I potentially should have over the past 10 years — to the detriment of my personal life. I love my life, but it’s not without sacrifice,” he told the publication.\n\n“It’s a lot to ask of a girlfriend, to put up with all the travel and the lack of face time. There’s often interest in who I’m dating. I don’t want to put someone through that if it’s not going to be a thing.”\n\n“I’m certainly looking for the one. I don’t want to be this person with a history of short to medium-term relationships.”\n\nBeing in the public eye has added another layer of complication, admitting he could never go public with a love interest until he is confident his relationship could withstand online comments.\n\n“The challenge, really, is that it’s hard enough to meet the right person, anyway,” he told Stellar.”That extra layer of speculation and interest… once you’re actually in a relationship it’s easy, but it’s meeting that person at the start that’s really hard. You could potentially be on your first date and you get photographed.\n\n“And then there’s a search for who this person is, what her backstory is, and then all of a sudden, it becomes something that it may not be that stage.”\n\nSadly, fans may never see Dr Chris on a reality TV show after admitting on Stellar’s Something to Talk About podcast that it would be too intimidating.\n\nGoing as far to say that ‘just the thought’ of kissing someone on camera repeatedly, “makes my skin crawl.”\n\nTake a look at Chris’ dating history, from past flings, exes to his rumoured current girlfriend."
