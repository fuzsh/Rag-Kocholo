        "text": "Rihanna and her longtime friend A$AP Rocky became much more than friends about four years ago; they welcomed their first child together in 2022 and second in 2023.\n\nA decade before that, they first became close after Rocky joined Rihanna’s Diamond Tour in 2013. The singer also starred in Rocky’s music video “Fashion Killa” later that year.\n\nRumors of Rocky and Rihanna’s romance first started shortly after Rihanna split from billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel in January 2020, after three years together. A source told People then that “their lives were too different, and it was hard to maintain a relationship.” Shortly after their breakup, Rihanna was seen hanging out with A$AP Rocky more often. Rocky previously dated Kendall Jenner in 2016; their relationship ended in 2017\n\nHere’s everything we know about the power couple, from when they were first speculated to be in a relationship to how they’re doing as parents of two.\n\nDecember 2019\n\nOn December 2, the pair walked the British Fashion Awards red carpet in London. Rihanna wore a Fenty mint green satin dress with matching gloves and wrap, paired with a diamond-studded choker necklace. Rocky wore an all-black tux with sneakers. Janet Jackson presented Rihanna’s first fashion award for her Urban Luxe nomination.\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nRihanna and Rocky sparked tabloid dating rumors days after her split from Hassan Jameel was reported. According to Entertainment Tonight, Rihanna and Rocky attended the Yams Day Benefit Concert in Brooklyn together.\n\nA source suggested the two stars were dating to The Sun, telling the British outlet, “they’re really enjoying each other’s company and taking things easy as it’s still early days.”\n\nShortly after The Sun’s report came out, E! shut down the romance speculation. A source told E!, “Rihanna is single. She just got out of a long intense relationship with Hassan. She wants to be single and isn’t going to jump into something. She’s hanging out with A$AP Rocky, but she is not dating him. They have a long history, and she’s just having fun.”\n\nJuly 2020\n\nMonths after dating rumors were initially denied, Rocky appeared alongside Rihanna in Fenty Skin’s ad cameo. The ad also featured Lil Nas X, Tommy Genesis, and Halima Aden.\n\nRihanna interviewed the “Everyday” rapper in a YouTube video. Rocky answered questions about his skincare routine, throwback outfits, and Fenty Skin. When asked about the most challenging part of working with Rihanna, the rapper said, “I think the hardest part about working with you is not goofin’ off and laughing the whole time. Like, this shit is comedy.” Rocky continued, “The hardest part is not having too much fun. You just forget that it’s still work at the end of the day.”\n\nNovember 2020\n\nOn November 28, the rumored couple was spotted out with a group of friends at the Beatrice Inn in New York. According to Page Six, the two were “seated discreetly behind a curtain.”\n\nA couple days later, People confirmed that Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were officially dating. The source did not provide details about the couple’s timeline or how serious their relationship is.\n\nDecember 2020\n\nOn December 1, a source gave Entertainment Tonight details about Rihanna and Rocky’s relationship.\n\n“They have always had amazing chemistry, and Rihanna relates to A$AP, and it [their relationship] feels natural, easy and fun,” the source said. “She feels very comfortable around him since they’ve known each other for such a long time and also feels a connection to him because his dad is from Barbados.”\n\nAccording to People, the couple had been inseparable for weeks. A source told the outlet that “it’s a new relationship, but they both seem very into it.” Rocky’s lifestyle as a famous musician worked with Rihanna’s. “They’ve always seemed to have a great time together,” the source said. “They have a lot in common.”\n\nUs Weekly reported that the “Goldie” rapper “has been very into Rihanna for years and was always the instigator in their flirtatious connection,” according to a source. The source also mentioned that Rihanna “would brush off his advances and kept him in the friend zone” until now.\n\n“Things changed over the summer, and they finally hooked up. They’ve been together ever since,” Us’s source said.\n\nThe couple became more serious as the Grammy-nominated rapper flew to Barbados to join Rihanna and her family for the holidays. According to People, the pair spent Christmas together.\n\nEntertainment Tonight was told by a source that “spending Christmas together was an obvious step” for their relationship. The source said being longtime friends makes it easier to “get along, travel together, and be involved in each other’s lives to the full extent. They always have such a good time together and definitely seem in love.”\n\nOn December 24, the low-key couple was photographed by paparazzi in Barbados. TMZ shared a photo of the pair hand-in-hand as they walked to the pier, seemingly confirming their relationship.\n\nLater that month, paparazzi caught more affectionate moments between the new couple. Rihanna and Rocky were spotted sharing a kiss while enjoying their Catamaran cruise, according to TMZ. The outlet shared a video of the pair jet skiing and tubing alongside Rihanna’s friends.\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nOn January 18, the couple and friends celebrated Yams Day, an annual celebration of Rocky’s late friend and business partner A$AP Yam, who died in 2015. E! reported details of the night as the couple arrived separately.\n\n“Rihanna arrived with a group of friends and met A$AP Rocky there,” a source told the outlet. “They entered the restaurant through different doors and tried to be discreet. A$AP Rocky entered behind a bodyguard and ducked inside quickly. Once everyone arrived, they sat together with a group of friends.”\n\nThe source said that the group had dinner and shared stories throughout the evening: “There was lots of food passed around the table and laughter coming from inside. They stayed for over two hours before leaving separately.” Rihanna and Rocky left separately.\n\nApril 2021\n\nThe couple made a rare sighting in Los Angeles on April 12. The paparazzi photographed the pair leaving dinner at Delilah in matching leather outfits. Rihanna wore a brown leather coat, and Rocky wore a black leather jacket paired with leather pants. It was confirmation that their romance remained very much on a year into the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMay 2021\n\nIn a interview, Rocky opened up about his relationship with the Barbadian singer for the first time. In the interview, he referred to Rihanna as “the love of my life” and “my lady.”\n\nThe rapper did not share when the two began their relationship, but he did discuss what dating Rihanna is like versus playing the field. It’s “so much better when you got the One. She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones,” Rocky said. “I think when you know, you know. She’s the One.”\n\nHe also spoke about their trip together to Barbados during the holidays. “It was crazy. I always imagined what it would be like for my dad before he came to America. And I got to visit those places, and believe it or not, and there was something nostalgic about it. It was foreign but familiar,” he said.\n\nJune 2021\n\nOn June 23, the couple was photographed sharing a kiss at Barcade in New York City, a rare PDA moment for them. Rihanna wore a sheer pink dress with a furry hot pink hat. Rocky wore a leather jacket, maroon tank, and leather pants. Later that night, the paparazzi captured the couple leaving the venue as Rihanna wore Rocky’s leather coat with his arms around her.\n\nA few days later, TMZ posted a video of the couple that depicted one of Rocky’s grand gestures for his lady. TMZ posted Rocky sweeping Rihanna off her feet as he carried her through New York City’s Lower East Side. According to the outlet, the couple spent the night and early morning partying together.\n\nJuly 2021\n\nRihanna and Rocky went for a date night in Miami at the World Famous House of Mac, where they took photos with the restaurant’s owner, Derrick Turton, who is also Pitbull’s former manager.\n\nThey cuddled up for photos, obtained by The Daily Mail, in which Rocky wrapped his arm around Rihanna’s shoulder. She put both arms in a hug around his waist.\n\nAugust 2021\n\nIn August, the couple enjoyed a date night in NYC, which eventually led to the night club Pergola, where they were photographed leaving at 5 A.M. Rihanna wore a Harley Davidson handkerchief top with very ripped jeans and sandal heels.\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nRihanna and Rocky walked the red carpet of the Met Gala together, an event the singer usually attends on her own. The theme for the 2021 Met Gala was American Fashion. Rihanna wore a dramatic black ruffle dress from Balenciaga with a beanie and over 267 carats worth of Bulgari diamonds. Rocky arrived wearing a patchwork, blanket-like ensemble that looked very cozy.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nRihanna and Rocky revealed they’re expecting their first child together. The two appeared out in New York City, Rihanna showing off her pregnant stomach to paparazzi at the end of the month.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nRihanna showed off some of her famously sexy and flattering maternity wear at the photocall for her Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin party held at Goya Studios in Los Angeles.

It’s final. I can’t believe... what did I just get myself into?’ Because the Super Bowl is one of the biggest stages in the world. It’s an entertainer’s dream to be on the stage like that, but it’s nerve-racking. You wanna get it right. You know everybody’s watching. And they’re rooting for you, and I wanna get it right. It’s a challenge I was willing to accept. Being a new mom, nothing would have gotten me out of the house if it wasn’t a challenge like that.”\n\nShe added, “It was now or never. Yeah, for sure. For sure. You can get real comfortable at home as a mom.”\n\nShe then shared a little about what her daily mom experience has been like and her favorite part.\n\n“Oh my god, the mornings, like, seeing his morning face!” Rihanna declared. “Seeing a baby with, like, little bags and waking up, and they’re just, like, startled.

Rihanna always dreamed of being a mom and she takes a lot of pride in it. She would love to have more children with A$AP in the future.”\n\nDecember 2022\n\nRihanna shared her baby’s face for the first time with a debut TikTok video.\n\nIn the adorable video, the baby is strapped in his car seat and smiling and gurgling as Rihanna speaks to him off-camera.

Yeah, I’m super excited. This is as huge. This is incredible. I’m so glad that my lady’s back making music again and whatnot, and getting back out there. It’s just incredible. Especially for both of us, it is a good year for both of us to be more active and be out there. But the Super Bowl is huge, and her being the creative she is she going to bring it, man. I’m excited. I’m more excited than everybody else, honestly.”\n\nHe went onto say about fatherhood, “It’s so unexplainable. It’s just one of those things. I’m a member of our club now, like the dad club. You see a dad, you see me. I’m playing on, I’m a full dad now. Being outside and working and being creative, it drives more energy for you…to think and soak things up like a sponge now that I’m a dad, because I have a whole ’nother perspective. But it honestly helps you get home to your family and get home to your baby. And I can’t even explain it, man. You come home to heaven every day. I’m so thankful. God is good, man.”\n\nThat same month, the couple made a glamorous appearance at the Golden Globe awards, where Rihanna was nominated for Best Original Song, Motion Picture.

At rehearsal, so it was, like, manager to manager, client to client. So when he grabbed my ass that night, everybody thought I was about to—my team was worried that I wanted to have his head on a fucking mantle.” She laughed. “But I was like, ‘Ah, nah.’ That’s why everybody was like, ‘Oh my god. She likes him.’”\n\nRihanna clarified that when she appeared in his “Fashion Killa” music video, “hell no [we weren’t together]. He asked me to be in a video. Virgil [Abloh] shot that.”\n\n“We saw fashion the same,” she said. “We saw creative the same. We ended up in the same circles a lot. And past that, when we grew up, we ended up supporting each other’s brands and products and creative all the time. I would wear his shit, he would show up to my launches. But it wasn’t until the end of 2019 [that things changed].”\n\n“We’ve known each other for a long time,” she continued. “I’ve seen him in relationships. He’s seen me in relationships. We’ve seen each other outside of relationships. We knew what we’re capable of, and the trouble that we could bring to each other’s lives. We can make or break each other’s hearts. And so, we started dating with a lot of caution.”\n\n“I just let whatever was supposed to happen, happen,” she added. “It was just, ‘This is a flower. It’s either going to die or blossom. But I’m going to let it decide itself.’”\n\nThe pandemic accelerated things between them. “COVID sped up our relationship, which I felt like God knew we needed because we were going to start a family,” she said. “And had it not been for COVID, we would’ve taken a lot more time to get comfortable with each other, to even know that we were ready.”\n\nWhen it came to having kids, “I mean, we didn’t even really talk about it,” she said. “There was no denying it. It was the best thing that ever happened to us. It just happened. I let God lead and just let go. Because in previous relationships, I tried and tried and tried my best, and you still feel like it’s not enough. So when someone sees you completely, and believes in you, and thinks you’re worthy of being the mother of their kids, it’s a great feeling. I felt the same about him. I knew he would be a great dad.”\n\nMay 2024\n\nRocky shared photos of their family to celebrate their oldest son, RZA’s, second birthday. “HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY 2 MY 1st BORN BABY BOY RZA ❤️” he wrote.\n\nJuly 2024"
