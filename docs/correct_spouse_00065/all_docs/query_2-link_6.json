        "text": "Chris Brown wants people to kiss his “f–king ass” if they “still hate” him for his “mistake” of assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009.\n\n“Im [sic] f–king 33! Im [sic] tired of yall [sic] running wit [sic] this narrative,” he began a lengthy rant on Friday, adding that people watch the tumultuous relationship between rapper Blueface and his girlfriend Chrisean Rock, who “beat the f–k out of each other in front of the world.”\n\n“But thats [sic] OK? It’s entertainment? ALL yall [sic] can suck my d–k disrespectfully.”\n\nThe “She Ain’t You” crooner then wondered where “cancel culture” was when it came to “white artists” who “date underage women” or “beat the f–k out of their wives.”\n\n“Oh. That’s right.. they are your buddies,” he continued. “No more fake love from me.. Stay out my way or get ran over simple as that!”\n\nBrown then posted a series of photos of white male and female actors and performers who have been accused or charged with abuse, including Sean Penn, Mel Gibson, Nicolas Cage, Ozzy Osbourne, Tommy Lee, Emma Roberts, Carmen Electra, Josh Brolin and more.\n\n“I got time today,” Brown added at the end.\n\nThe “Run It!” singer’s tirade comes after a week of controversy for him, which first began when he seemingly weighed in on the “Umbrella” songstress’ Super Bowl performance.\n\n“GO GIRL,” Brown wrote alongside a red heart and praying-hands emojis after 34-year-old Rihanna’s halftime show, during which she announced her second pregnancy.\n\nDays later, singer Chloë Bailey came under fire after she announced a new single titled “How Does It Feel” featuring Brown, who has been accused of abuse on multiple occasions over the years."
