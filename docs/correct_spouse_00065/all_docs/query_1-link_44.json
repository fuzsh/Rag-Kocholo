However, she has started to step into the spotlight more in recent years.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll discuss who Kandy Fenty is and her relationship with Rihanna.

Her mother had a brief relationship with Ronald Fenty, who later became Rihanna’s father. After Kandy was born, her mother left Barbados and moved to the United Kingdom.\n\nKandy was raised by her maternal grandparents in Barbados. She grew up believing her father would come for her one day, not realizing he was living in the same town! Kandy didn’t meet her mother again until she was in her 20s. That’s when she first learned the identity of her biological father.\n\nKandy’s Initial Meeting with Her Father and Rihanna\n\nOnce Kandy discovered who her father was, she decided to seek him out. She went to his home in Saint Michael, Barbados, and introduced herself to him, his wife Monica, and their three young children – including a 15-year-old Rihanna.\n\nRonald Fenty was shocked but welcomed Kandy into the family. Rihanna and her brothers also embraced their new big sister.
