        "text": "Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are in the club of power couples who will inevitably go down in history. The longtime friends made their romance official in 2020, after months of dating rumors and years of being at each other’s side.\n\nBelow, we track how their relationship blossomed from friendship to romance—and now, to parenthood. Here’s everything to know so far.\n\nApril 17, 2024: Rihanna says she dresses their sons “like Rocky.”\n\nIn a red-carpet interview with Entertainment Online at a Fenty x Puma event, the singer reveals how Rocky’s style influences how she dresses their two sons.\n\n“When I dress them, I always try to dress them like Rocky,” she says. “Because I always envision dressing a girl, right? We all do as women—like, ‘Oh, I’m going to dress her in these cute little things.’ But then you get sons and you}re like, ‘What do I do?’ and I was like, ‘You know what, I have the biggest hack—their dad.’ ”\n\nApril 9, 2024: Rihanna confirms their relationship started in late 2019.\n\nWhile sitting for a cover story with Interview magazine, Rihanna opens about the start of her relationship with Rocky, revealing that while the two met in 2012, their romantic connection started in late 2019.\n\n“We saw fashion the same. We saw creative the same. We ended up in the same circles a lot. And past that, when we grew up, we ended up supporting each other’s brands and products and creative all the time,” she tells editor-in-chief Mel Ottenberg. “I would wear his shit, he would show up to my launches. But it wasn’t until the end of 2019 [that we got together] …”\n\nShe adds: “We’ve known each other for a long time. I’ve seen him in relationships. He’s seen me in relationships. We’ve seen each other outside of relationships. We knew what we’re capable of, and the trouble that we could bring to each other’s lives. We can make or break each other’s hearts. And so, we started dating with a lot of caution … I just let whatever was supposed to happen, happen. It was just, ‘This is a flower. It’s either going to die or blossom. But I’m going to let it decide itself.’ ”\n\nFebruary 20, 2024: The couple “love[s] being parents.”\n\nA source for Entertainment Tonight offers some insight into the duo’s new life as parents of not one but two little boys.\n\n“Rihanna and A$AP are doing so well,” the insider says. “They both love being parents and balance each other out. A$AP is very outgoing and playful, and Rihanna is chill and fun.”\n\nThe source adds, “They make each other laugh and are also interested in the same things, like music, fashion, business ideas, art, and more, so they have fun together no matter what they’re doing.”\n\nDecember 19, 2023: Rihanna is happy to be a “boy mom.”\n\nDuring an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the superstar opens up about raising sons RZA and Riot with Rocky.\n\n“They’re the best, though. Having a house full of boys—I thought I was a girl mom, but I’m a boy mom. I love this. I love it,” she says.\n\nAs for how RZA is adjusting to life as a big brother, she says, “He struggled in the beginning, but he loves his little brother. Every time he thinks we’re not looking at him, he’ll come over and touch him. If the baby’s crying, he’ll just hold his hands. It hurts him if the baby’s crying. He’ll wake up in the morning just saying, ‘Baby, baby, baby.’ He loves him. It took a while, but he got there, and I’m proud of him.”\n\nAugust 2023: Rihanna gives birth to baby number two.\n\nTMZ reports the couple welcomed their second child together sometime in August, with Rihanna giving birth in a Los Angeles hospital. While the baby’s name and gender have yet to be revealed, the outlet notes that the new addition’s name begins with the letter R.\n\n“Rihanna feels her family is now complete,” a source tells People. “It’s something she’s always wanted.”\n\nJune 21, 2023: Rocky fuels marriage rumors with Rihanna.\n\nWhile performing for Spotify Beach at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in France, the rapper seems to drop a major hint about his and Rihanna’s relationship status.\n\nRihanna supports her man during the show, dancing along and watching his performance from a balcony. She wears a black see-through Jean Paul Gaultier bodysuit with diamond paneling and a halter neckline, plus a sparkling sequined bikini from Oséree underneath.\n\nA witness at the set tells Entertainment Tonight that before Rocky performed “D.M.B.”—the title of the ode to Rihanna stands for “dat’s my bitch”—he dedicated the song to “my beautiful wife in the motherfucking building! I love her.”\n\nThe two previously sparked marriage speculation in the music video for “D.M.B.” There, Rihanna makes multiple PDA-filled appearances and shows up at the end as a bride dressed in red. During the wedding in the video, Rocky wears gold grills that spell out MARRY ME? while Rihanna wears her own bedazzled grills that read I DO.\n\nFebruary 15, 2023: Rihanna gushes about raising a family with Rocky.\n\nIn an interview with British Vogue, Rihanna discusses her relationship with her life partner and shares insight into how they’ve adapted to parenthood.\n\n\"We're best friends with a baby,\" she said. \"We have to be on the same page, but we've always kind of had that in our relationship.
