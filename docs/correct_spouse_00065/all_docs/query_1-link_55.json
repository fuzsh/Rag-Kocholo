        "text": "It’s been more than five years since A$AP Rocky’s polarizing third LP Testing, and expectations for the New York rapper’s next body of work continue to ratchet ever higher as he teases new details in between raising his first child with Rihanna, expecting another baby, and dabbling in commercial direction. In a new interview with Complex, Rocky gave perhaps the clearest picture of what Don’t Be Dumb will sound like.\n\nAs part of the new Beats commercial he directed—which sees Rocky lace up his Timberlands and head to an AWGE-branded bodega to pick up diapers for baby RZA—the 34-year-old MC gave audiences a taste of Don’t Be Dumb’s first single: “Riot (Rowdy Pipe’n),” a reference to the late wrestler Roddy Piper, and features help from Pharrell and Tyler, the Creator.\n\n“I just call designers up, I free ninety-nine it,” Rocky brags. “My wife is erotic, I'm smokin' exotic / My whip is exotic, my crib is a cottage.”\n\nA version of “Riot” leaked under the name “Piper” several years ago, as Rocky’s recent output has been consistently undermined by people selling and distributing his unreleased work online. In his Complex interview, Rocky emphasized that leaks are one of the reasons Don’t Be Dumb has been delayed: “These dummies got to stop leaking shit. Every time, we have to go back to the drawing board.”\n\nRocky’s music has always been targeted by leakers, which has potentially contributed to his slower output of late. In the last year, Rocky has released just a handful of singles, including “Same Problems,” a poignant ode to late members of the hip-hop community, and “D.M.B.,” which sparked rumors of marriage between Rocky and Rihanna through its video.\n\nRocky also shared the A-list names providing production for Don’t Be Dumb, including longtime collaborators Metro Boomin, Hit-Boy, and Tyler, as well as some intriguing first-time pairings with Madlib, The Alchemist, and rising Memphis producer Hitkidd, known for his work with GloRilla. (Guest vocalists are less clear, though Rocky has worked on material for the LP with rising Mexican musician Peso Pluma.)\n\nAs for Rihanna, Rocky was asked about the possibility of his superstar spouse appearing on Don’t Be Dumb. He gave an answer that, while encouraging, proves that not even Rihanna’s life partner can say with absolute certainty when we’ll be hearing a track with her on it again.\n\n“I'm always down to collab with my partner,” Rocky said. “She's a phenomenal creative. Yeah, there’s a lot of things we’re going to collaborate on, from products for children.”"
