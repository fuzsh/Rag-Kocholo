        "text": "It’s official, Rihanna has been swept off her feet by ASAP Rocky who has confirmed their relationship, declaring her the ‘love of [his] life’.\n\nIn a new interview with GQ magazine, ASAP revealed he was serious about the Wild Thoughts singer and described her as ‘the one’.\n\nIt’s been a longtime coming for Rihanna, 33, and A$AP, 32, who have known each other since at least 2012 but were first romantically linked in January 2020 following her split from Hassan Jameel.\n\nNo matter who steals away RiRi’s heart, there’s no denying that we’re always glued to their love life, making sure that they treat our girl right.\n\nSorry A$AP, you’re no different buddy.\n\nSo as the hot new couple go public, let’s take a look back at RiRi’s journey to finding ‘the one’…\n\nRihanna and Chris Brown\n\nIt initially seemed like the hottest match in music – Rihanna and Chris Brown were simultaneously running the charts when they began hooking up in 2008.\n\nHowever, there were rumours later that year that their relationship was tumultuous and it culminated in Chris physically assaulting the singer during an argument in their car after leaving a Grammys party the night before the awards.\n\nChris later pleaded guilty to felony assault and agreed to a plea deal of community labour, five years of probation and domestic violence counselling. They briefly reconciled in 2012 before calling it quits for good, but they have remained friendly over the years.\n\nOpening up about their ill-fated relationship, Rihanna told Vanity Fair at the time: ‘Sometimes you just have to walk away.’\n\nMatt Kemp\n\nMatt Kemp was Rihanna’s first high-profile relationship since splitting from Chris, with their romance gathering momentum in 2010. However, it didn’t last long and sources said Rihanna’s relationship with the then-Miami Marlins player was ‘never as serious as it looked’.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nIn 2015, Rihanna and Leo set tongues wagging when they were spotted locked in deep conversation during a party at the Playboy mansion.\n\nThey were also pictured together at Rihanna’s birthday party, sending the rumour mill into overdrive.\n\nHowever, a rep for the Titanic actor splashed cold water over any hopes of a super A-list romance, stating Leo was single at the time.\n\nDrake\n\nAh, Drizzy Drake. Where do we begin? Perhaps to when their friendship began way back in 2009 as Drake rose to prominence as the most promising rapper on the horizon.\n\nRumours that they were more than friends mounted over the years and were only fuelled when they started collaborating together on songs like What’s My Name?, Take Care, Work and Too Good.\n\nThings seemed to be seriously hotting up for a moment but it came to an abrupt and awkward end in 2016, when Drake delivered an overly complimentary speech for the singer while presenting her with the Vanguard Award at the MTV VMAs.\n\n‘She’s someone I’ve been in love with since I was 22 years old. She’s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life, I’ve looked up to her, even though she’s younger than me,’ Drake said.\n\nHe added: ‘She’s a living, breathing legend in our industry.’\n\nHowever, Rihanna had a different view of the sweet sentiment and admitted she friend-zoned him after the grand show of affection.\n\nShe told Vogue: ‘We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is. Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments. I don’t like to be put on blast.’\n\nThey’ve since reconciled and Rihanna even brought A$AP to a party Drake was hosting at a Los Angeles restaurant in April.\n\nHassan Jameel\n\nRihanna found happiness again with billionaire businessman Hassan later in 2016.\n\nTheir relationship was first revealed when they were pictured sharing an affectionate moment in a swimming pool while on holiday together.\n\nFrom there, RiRi and Hassan seemed to be virtually inseparable with the pair attending basketball games together and often enjoying nights out in London where the singer moved to in 2019.\n\nRihanna was even seen on holiday with Hassan and his family on Italy’s Amalfi coast, showing that she had been accepted into the clan.\n\nConfirming their relationship to Vogue, Rihanna said: ‘Yeah, I’m dating.\n\n‘I’m actually in an exclusive relationship for quite some time, and it’s going really well, so I’m happy.’\n\nHowever, it was reported in January 2020 that the pop star had split from the Saudi businessman after three years of dating.\n\nA$AP Rocky\n\nWhich brings us to Rihanna’s new love A$AP – although given the amount of years they’ve known each other, it might be more appropriate to use ‘old’.\n\nThe pair had been friends since at least 2012 when they worked on the remix of her song Cockiness, but it wasn’t until January 2020 that sources revealed their friendship had turned romantic.\n\nFrom there, A$AP and Rihanna were spotted together on various occasions throughout the year, with the singer even enlisting the Goldie rapper for promo shots for her Fenty Skin range last August.\n\nThings appeared to get more serious at the end of 2020, as the rumoured couple were snapped together on Christmas Eve in Barbados, with insiders claiming that A$AP spent the holiday with Rihanna and her family in her hometown.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Rihanna and ASAP Rocky dating: Rapper calls singer ‘love of my life’ as he finally confirms romance"
