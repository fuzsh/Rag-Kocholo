        "text": "Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are sparking marriage rumors after he referred to the pregnant singer as his “wife.”\n\nPage Six exclusively reported that the rapper gave the public shoutout to the Fenty Beauty founder during his Spotify concert at the 2023 Cannes Lions Festival Wednesday night.\n\n“I’d like to dedicate this song to my beautiful wife in the motherf–king building!” Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, told the crowd.\n\nRihanna, who showed off her baby bump in a sheer black dress, then smiled at him from the VIP section.\n\nThe “1 Train” artist’s declaration caught the attention of fans who began speculating whether the couple had secretly gotten married.\n\n“So ASAP and Rihanna are married?” one fan tweeted Thursday in response to our report.\n\n“Wait, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky Might Be Married? And Didn’t Tell Us?” a second person wrote.\n\n“i feel like rihanna and asap got married in private,” a third suggested.\n\n“Are you married or not ???? @rihanna,” a Twitter user asked, while another commented, “They most likely married already.”\n\nNo public records show that the duo are hitched and reps for Rocky and Rihanna did not immediately respond to Page Six’s multiple requests for comment.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Rocky, 34, and Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Fenty, have fueled marriage speculation.\n\nIn May, the “Rude Boy” songstress, 35, shared photos from the pair’s Met Gala 2023 appearance. She famously wore an elaborate Valentino gown, while he rocked a Gucci suit jacket and a kilt layered over jeans.\n\n“shout outz 2 the bridal party….here come de bride #idoKARL#METgala2023,” she captioned the post, leading fans to believe that the lovebirds tied the knot.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nRihanna and Rocky started dating in 2020 and announced they were expecting their first child in January 2022.\n\nThe couple welcomed their son, whose name is RZA Athelston Mayers, on May 13, 2022, in Los Angeles.\n\nIn February, Rihanna revealed she was pregnant again when she debuted her growing baby bump during her Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nRihanna has since continued to celebrate her second pregnancy with a series of stylish and daring maternity outfits."
