        "text": "Rihanna and Chris Brown's relationship is not only hard to keep up with (are they on? Are they off?), it's also a contentious one ever since that fateful night at the Grammys four years ago. One man in particular who is not a fan of the two singers' union is Chris Brown's dad, Clinton.\n\n\"I personally really didn't want him and Rihanna back together,\" Clinton, 48, said in an exclusive interview with New York Daily News. In his opinion, they're not balanced, and relationships like these often end badly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I hate to use examples, but Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Amy Winehouse -- I mean I could go on and on!,\" continued the man who split from Brown's mother when Chris was six years old, but is reportedly still very much present in his life. \"Is that a given -- that you can't have fortune and fame without [death] being the end result?\"\n\nAnd who would Clinton like to see his son with, if not with the \"We Found Love\" beauty? \"American Idol\" winner Jordin Sparks, who collaborated with Chris on the 2008 hit \"No Air.\"\n\n\"She's a wholesome young lady, very pretty,\" Clinton told Daily News of Sparks.\n\nBrown and Rihanna have both publicly dealt with the scrutiny over their tumultuous relationship. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine back in January, the 25-year-old Bajan pop star said \"it's different now. We don't have those types of arguments anymore. We talk about shit. We value each other. We know exactly what we have now, and we don't want to lose that... He doesn't have the luxury of fucking up again.\"\n\nA couple of months later, Brown, 23, tried to explain how the two of them got back together. \"I just tried my best to be the best man I could be over the years and just show her how remorseful and sorry I was for the incident,\" he said in a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest in March, \"She's a wonderful person I'm eternally grateful and thankful [for her forgiveness].\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnsurprisingly, Clinton isn't alone in his thoughts the two singers should be kept apart. Another man adding fuel to the fire is rapper Drake, who reportedly romanced Rihanna while she and Brown were broken up.\n\nEarlier this month, the 26-year-old Canadian rapper did an interview with East Village Radio and addressed his ongoing feud with Brown: \"His insecurities are the fact that I make better music than him, that I'm more popping than him and that at one point in life the woman that he loves fell into my lap,\" he said, adding: \"I did what a real n***a would do and treated her with respect.\""
