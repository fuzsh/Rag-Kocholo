She looks at the phone and there’s a message that says ‘kill the Grammys, do your thing’ and I didn’t read the rest of the message. I didn’t open it.

From there she just spit in my face, spit blood in my face and it enraged me even more,” Brown says of the 2009 incident.\n\n“I bite her arm as I’m still trying to drive, it was like a petty, stupid fight,” Brown says.\n\nREAD MORE: After 2 years of domestic violence, woman sits down with her abuser and asks ‘Why?’\n\nHe recalls that he pulled over at Hancock Park because he was trying to resolve the situation.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAt that point, Brown says, Rihanna took the keys and yelled, “Help, he’s trying to kill me.”\n\n“I look back at that picture, and I’m like, ‘That’s not me, bro, that’s not me,'” Brown says of the photo of Rihanna’s injuries. “I hate it to this day.
