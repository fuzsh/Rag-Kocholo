        "text": "Since 2009, the singer has had a troubling string of meltdowns, arrests and headline-grabbing fights.\n\nAlmost ten years ago, on Feb. 9, 2009, Chris Brown assaulted his then-girlfriend Rihanna in a bloody attack on Grammys night, an event that would change the course of both artists’ careers, and changed how the world saw Brown.\n\nUntil that point, Brown’s career had been near-blemish-free, as he built on the success of early tracks like “Run It!” and “Yo (Excuse Me Miss)” with his blazing 2007-2008 run of singles, including “Kiss Kiss,” “With You” and “Forever.” Brown seemed unstoppable, until his beating of Rihanna revealed a darker side of the star, with violent impulses -- which often included female victims -- landing him in the headlines, in courtrooms and occasionally behind bars over the next decade.\n\nRead on for a timeline of Chris Brown's confirmed and alleged incidents of violence over the course of his troubled past decade, from Grammys night 2009 through January's recent rape accusation in Paris.\n\nMarch 2009: Brown is charged with felony assault after an altercation with then-girlfriend Rihanna. The incident leaves her bloody and bruised, and photos of her battered face are leaked to the public. Brown pleads guilty, is sentenced to serve five years probation and 1,400 hours of community service. In Aug. 2013, he is assigned an additional 1,000 hours, to be completed before the end of his probation on Aug. 25, 2014.\n\nMarch 2011: He makes headlines for smashing a window and storming out shirtless of the Good Morning America studios, upset that host Robin Roberts asked about Rihanna during his interview.\n\nJune 2012: Brown and rapper Drake are accused of prompting a bottle-smashing brawl.\n\nNovember 2012: Brown goes back to court for a progress report on his 2009 domestic violence caseand is cleared of a probation violation. In addition, he shocks fans after getting into an extremely vulgar, expletive-laden Twitter exchange with comedian Jenny Johnson. He deletes his Twitter account after their fight, sending out one final tweet calling Johnson a word that rhymes with \"witch.\"\n\nJanuary 2013: He gets into a fight with singer Frank Ocean in a parking lot at Hollywood's Westlake Recording Studios, according to police who were called to the scene. The fight allegedly is sparked because Brown parked his car in Ocean's spot, with rumors circulating that Ocean dissed Rihanna and that Brown called Ocean gay slurs and threatened to shoot his entourage. In August, a member of Ocean's entourage filed a lawsuit against Brown, saying he suffered a concussion and was seeking damages. The suit was later dropped.\n\nMay 2013: Brown is charged with a hit-and-run, after allegedly crashing into a car, driving away and refusing to provide his name, driver's license and insurance info. He later turns himself in, spending about an hour in jail. He pleads not guilty and the charges are dropped in August, after Brown reaches a civil compromise with the other driver.\n\nJune 2013: A 24-year-old woman accuses Brown of assaulting her after his show at a California nightclub. She alleges that he shoved her to the ground, badly injuring her knee. Brown later tweeted \"I didn't do anything,\" but then deleted the tweet. The accusation was dropped when the nightclub's reps stood by Brown, saying that they never saw him \"push or touch anybody.\"\n\nOct. 27, 2013: Brown is arrested and charged with felony assault after he and his bodyguard allegedly attacked a fan outside of the W Hotel in Washington, D.C. In the police report of the incident, the victim, a 20-year-old male named Isaac Parker, says he tried to get in a photo that Brown was taking with a female fan and that Brown punched him in the face in response.\n\n/September 2014: Brown pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for his alleged 2013 attack of Isaac Parker in D.C., and was sentenced to time served for spending two days in jail as part of the case.\n\nJan. 2016: Las Vegas police investigate Brown for possible misdemeanor battery and theft charges after a woman claimed Brown attacked her at a party inside a hotel room when she tried to take a picture of him on her phone. Brown's representatives denied he was responsible for the incident, and Brown was never charged.\n\nJune 2016: Brown's ex-manager Michael Guirguis sued him for alleged assault, false imprisonment, infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, claiming the singer brutally attacked him and sent him to the hospital. Guirguis would also eventually lose a bid to seize $1.5 million in assets from the singer for allegedly failing to pay commission, with a judge rejecting the motion.\n\nAugust 2016: Brown was arrested on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, with a woman claiming that Brown had pointed a gun at her face in an incident at Brown's Los Angeles home when Brown allegedly became upset when the woman admired another man's diamond necklace. The case was later dropped.\n\nJune 2017: Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran won a 5-year restraining order against him, following a hearing where she shared threatening text and voicemail messages from Brown and testified that he threatened to \"beat the (expletive)\" out of her. Tran had previously been granted a temporary restraining order earlier that year, after she accused the singer of punching her in the stomach and pushing her down a set of stairs several years earlier.\n\nMay 2018: A woman sues Brown and claims she was raped at his home. She says Brown confiscated her phone, and when she went to his home to retrieve it, she claims she was forced to perform sex acts on his male and female friends and was raped multiple by Brown's friend. No formal charges resulted from the lawsuit.\n\nJune 2018: Brown was ordered to stay 100 yards away from a woman who won a temporary restraining order against him, who said in court documents that Brown was harassing and stalking her.\n\nJuly 2018: Brown was arrested by Florida police outside his concert in West Palm Beach and was later released on a $2,000 cash bond. Brown had an arrest warrant issued for a felony battery case from April 2017, stemming from an incident in which the singer allegedly struck a photographer in Tampa."
