        "text": "Could congratulations be in order for A$AP Rocky and Rihanna?\n\nThe pair — who are currently expecting their second child together — sparked marriage rumors after showing up to the 2023 Met Gala in bridal-esque attire.\n\nThe “Love on the Brain” songstress stunned in a breathtaking white Valentino ensemble featuring a flower-adorned cape and dramatic train. She accessorized the look with $25 million worth of Cartier jewels — though a wedding ring was certainly missing from her hand.\n\nMeanwhile, A$AP Rocky wore a Gucci suit jacket and a kilt over a pair of shimmering jeans held up by numerous belts.\n\nRihanna’s decision to wear white led many fans to believe the couple secretly said “I do.”\n\n“I’m going to go out on a limb here and say I think this is a nod to Rihanna and ASAP getting married,” one fan tweeted. “She’s late and she’s the last to arrive and she’s in a wedding dress.”\n\nFollow Met Gala 2023 with the latest top stories from Page Six:\n\nThe best-dressed celebs at 2023 Met Gala: Rihanna, Gisele Bündchen and more\n\nKim Kardashian and Pete Davidson reunite at Met Gala 9 months after breakup\n\nInside the Met Gala: See celebs let loose at extravagant dinner\n\nKendall Jenner rocks thong over sheer sequined bodysuit at Met Gala afterparty\n\n“I have a feeling Rihanna is married #MetGala,” another wrote.\n\n“Is this Rihanna’s wedding and we’re all just finding out about it…like go awf sisssss,” a third person proposed. “Like surprise Met Gala this is actually my wedding… K thanks.”\n\nHowever, others speculated that if they aren’t married yet, it could happen any time soon.\n\n“Rihanna gave ‘wedding bouquet,’ she’s signaling that they’re about to get married,” a fourth person said.\n\n“this photoshoot has a wedding energy. I’m feeling it Rihanna,” someone else tweeted.\n\nEven if Riri and Rocky aren’t already husband and wife, it appears they still perfectly executed this year’s theme honoring the legacy of Karl Lagerfeld.\n\n“Fun fact. Karl would usually close his Chanel shows with a wedding dress! THIS is ON THEME!” one fan pointed out. “The timing of Rihanna in the carpet! The styling! Everything!”\n\nPrior to fashion’s biggest night, the songstress stepped out on the streets of New York City in a cropped Chanel jacket, which was part of the designer house’s fall 1994 ready-to-wear collection.\n\nRihanna and the rapper started dating in early 2020 and revealed they were expecting their first child two years later.\n\nAround the same time, Rihanna sparked engagement rumors after being spotted with a massive diamond sparkler — yet the pair never confirmed the rumblings."
