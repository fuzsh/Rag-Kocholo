A$AP confirmed in a May 2021 interview with GQ that he was dating Rihanna and called her \"The One.\" One month earlier, a source told Us Weekly that the pair were spotted \"holding hands and laughing\" during a night out in Los Angeles. “It’s obvious they’re a couple and also are each other’s best friend,” the insider added. “They kid around a lot [and] laugh a lot. They have private date nights together a lot and have a blast hanging out together.” Since turning from friends to lovers, the couple have faced their fair share of highs and lows, from expanding their family to A$AP's 2022 arrest in Los Angeles.

That was not part of the rehearsal! I was like, 'What are you doing!?' ... [After it happened], my manager was like, 'Oh, God, she must like this guy a little bit. She never lets this s--t slide.'\"\n\nThings quickly became serious between the couple during the coronavirus pandemic as they embarked on a cross-country road trip. \"He became my family in that time,\" she told the outlet, also describing the pair's visit to her family in Barbados. \"My mother has a really good read on people. She observes first and then she'll move slowly. I guess I'm like that too. There are some guys that I've dated that she won't even look at to this day. But she was charmed by him from the jump.\"\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nApril 2022\n\nFenty designer Amina Muaddi shut down rumors that she had an affair with A$AP Rocky during Rihanna’s pregnancy. “I’ve always believed that an unfounded lie spread on social media doesn’t deserve any response or clarification, especially one that is so vile,” she wrote via her Instagram Story on April 15. “I initially assumed that this fake gossip — fabricated with such malicious intent — would not be taken seriously. However, in the last 24 [hours] I’ve been reminded that we live in a society that is so quick to speak on topics regardless of factual basis and that nothing is off limits. Not even during what should be one of the most beautiful and celebrated times in one’s life.”\n\nMuaddi noted she chose to speak out because the accusations were “not only directed towards me but it is related to people I have a great amount of respect and affection for,” including Rihanna, her boss at Fenty.\n\nCredit: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nRocky gushed over being a new father, telling Apple Music's Zane Lowe that parenthood is \"unexplainable\" to him. \"It's just one of those things,\" he said. \"I'm a member of our club now, like, the dad club. You see a dad, you see me. ... I'm a full dad now.\"\n\nThe musician described the joy of seeing his family flourish. \"Being outside and working and being creative, it drives more energy for you ... to think and soak things up like a sponge now that I'm a dad, because I have a whole [other] perspective,\" he continued. \"But it honestly helps you get home to your family and get home to your baby. And I can't even explain it, man.\n\nYou come home to heaven every day. I'm so thankful. God is good, man.\" He went on to tease Rihanna's 2023 Super Bowl halftime performance. \"I'm super excited,\" he raved. \"This is as huge. This is incredible. I'm so glad that my lady's back making music again and whatnot, and getting back out there. It's just incredible. ... I'm more excited than everybody else, honestly.\""
