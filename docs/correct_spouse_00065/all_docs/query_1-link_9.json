        "text": "Rihanna’s Dating History: From Her Ex-Boyfriends To A$AP Rocky\n\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky are one of the music industry's hottest couples! Let's take a look at her dating history and ex-boyfriends over the years.\n\nRihanna has been dating boyfriend A$AP Rocky for quite some time, keeping things low-key before eventually confirming that they were officially a couple back in May 2021!\n\nSpeaking to GQ, the 34-year-old rapper called his girlfriend \"the one\" and also dubbed her \"the love of my life\". Now the couple are inseparable after welcoming their first baby boy together in May 2022.\n\nRihanna New Album 2023: Release Date, Songs And Everything We Know About New Music\n\nRihanna Super Bowl Halftime Show 2023: When Is It & What Will She Perform?\n\nRiri has definitely had a very notable dating history, with high-profile partners such as Drake and Chris Brown.\n\nBut who has she previously been linked to? Here's what we know...\n\nRihanna and Chris Brown\n\nProbably her most public relationship to this day, Rihanna dated 'Freaky Friday' hitmaker Chris Brown from 2007-2009.\n\nThey broke up following an incident in which Rihanna was physically assaulted by the father-of-two.\n\nThey parted ways until they reconciled in 2013 for a few months, but were quick to call it quits again.\n\nChris has shared his love and support for his ex over the years, leaving the occasional heart emoji under her Instagram photos.\n\nRihanna and Drake\n\nRiri and Drake reportedly had an on/off relationship between 2009-2016 and have released some absolute bangers together including 'Work', 'What's My Name' and 'Take Care'.\n\nHowever, things turned sour between the pair and Rihanna famously told Vogue in 2018 the pair were no longer friends.\n\nShe said: “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is.”\n\nHowever, it looks like they've managed to patch things up as she attended his 33rd birthday party in October 2019.\n\nRihanna and Matt Kemp\n\nShe dated the professional baseball player for just under a year, from January-December 2010, following her split from Chris.\n\nMatt, who plays for the Miami Marlins, ended things with the Savage X Fenty star because her schedule apparently became 'too much' for him.\n\nA source told US Weekly: \"He just can't keep up with her crazy travel schedule. Matt's sick of always following after her like a puppy dog all over the world. He wants something more normal.\"\n\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky\n\nRiri has been close friends with A$AP since they collaborated together on their track 'Fashion Killa' in 2013 - the same year he remixed her track 'Cockiness (I Love It)' and joined her on her Diamonds World Tour.\n\nOver the years, they have been romantically linked numerous times and it wasn't until May 2021 he confirmed their romance.\n\nThey attended the British Fashion Awards together in December 2019, shortly after she was seen supporting him at his concert in Sweden.\n\nA$AP has since called his girlfriend \"the one\" and we're honestly so here for the power couple!\n\nSince Riri and the rapper made their relationship public, they've been spotted at several lavish industry events together – most notably they walked the red carpet hand in hand at the MET Gala as well as the 2023 Golden Globes.\n\nThe Fenty business mogul was even spotted supporting her beau in the crowd in September as he delivered an electric concert.\n\nRihanna and Travis Scott\n\nTravis Scott and Rihanna had a short-lived romance in 2015, which came to an end as it reportedly became 'too much' for the 'Four Five Seconds' hitmaker.\n\nThey were first seen hanging out together at New York Fashion Week in 2015, with a source telling E! Online: \"Travis and Rihanna are dating, officially. It's already very serious. He's very into her.\"\n\nHowever, it was shortly over after it was reported that the relationship between Riri and the rapper, who has a baby with Kylie Jenner, fizzled out.\n\nRihanna and Hassan Jameel\n\nThe makeup mogul dated Hassan for three years before calling it quits in January 2020.\n\nThe pair had a private relationship, making very few public appearances together over the years.\n\nHowever, the split came as a surprise to fans as she confirmed in October 2019 that she was 'of course' in love with her man.\n\nIn an interview with Vogue, she said: \"Yeah, I’m dating. I’m actually in an exclusive relationship for quite some time, and it’s going really well, so I’m happy.\""
