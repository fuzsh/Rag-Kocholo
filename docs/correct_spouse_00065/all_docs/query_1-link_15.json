And had it not been for COVID, we would’ve taken a lot more time to get comfortable with each other, to even know that we were ready.\"\n\nRIhanna believes her current romance is different to anything she's previously experienced, and she was always convinced that Rocky would become a \"great dad\".\n\nThe award-winning star - who has previously dated the likes of Chris Brown and businessman Hassan Jameel - explained: \"I let god lead and just let go. Because in previous relationships, I tried and tried and tried my best, and you still feel like it’s not enough. So when someone sees you completely, and believes in you, and thinks you’re worthy of being the mother of their kids, it’s a great feeling. I felt the same about him. I knew he would be a great dad.\"\n\nRihanna has relished the challenge of motherhood.\n\nAsked if she's amazed by what she's achieved in her life, Rihanna shared: \"I wouldn’t have had any idea. The only thing that I knew I wanted, or that I could imagine, was motherhood. I didn’t know how it would come, but it is the best part of my journey so far. Everything else was a surprise.\""
