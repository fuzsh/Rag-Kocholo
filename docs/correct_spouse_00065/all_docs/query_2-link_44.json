Finally, they confirmed their relationship status and became the new royal couple of pop music. But unfortunately, things weren’t as magical as they may have seemed.\n\nOn Feb. 8, 2009, on the way home from a Grammy event, Rihanna expressed frustration over something that had occurred there (Brown says it was a former lover walking up to him). In response, Brown attempted to push her out of the car, slammed her head against the window, punched her in the face, and then repeated to do so as he drove. After she attempted to call her personal assistant and failed to get an answer, she faked leaving a voicemail in hopes that it would dissuade Brown from further action. In response, he threatened her with murder. He would go on to strike her several more times, as well as bite her ear and choke her to the point of near-unconsciousness.\n\nBrown would eventually be charged with assault and receive five years of probation and six months of community service.\n\n\"Paris Hilton got more jail time than Chris Brown did for beating a woman to a pulp,\" said Kim Gandy, then-president of the National Organization for Women, to the Washington Post. \"How could he not spend one day in jail? I find it shocking. There are things that celebrity should not protect you against.\"\n\nOne of Brown’s most noteworthy beefs was his clash with Drake. In June of 2012, the vibe between the two had increasingly become hostile, and finally came to a head in New York City.\n\nAt a now-closed nightclub called Work in Progress, the respective crews of Brown and Drizzy overlapped when Brown decided to send a bottle of champagne over to the Champagne Papi. Drake responded by sending the bottle back, along with a note that reportedly said, “I’m fucking the love of your life.” A full-on brawl erupted; Brown was hit, as was Tony Parker, who was with Brown’s crew and received a scratched cornea as a result.\n\nThe beef has since simmered on and off, but one can assume it’s over, with the two hopping in the studio together in 2014 and Drake recently hyping up Brown’s basketball skills on Instagram.\n\nStemming from the original Twitter spat between Brown and Tyler, the former engaged in a war of words with Frank Ocean after a complimentary tweet from Brown was interpreted as insincere. Tyler jumped in this time as well, joking that Amber Rose had stolen Brown’s style. Eventually, though, Tyler declared an end to the beef after a group of Brown’s associates started stalking Ocean in Los Angeles.\n\nSpoiler alert: the beef was not over, and three years later, Twitter fingers turned to trigger fingers. Upset that Brown had taken his parking spot at a recording studio in Los Angeles, Ocean confronted his entourage, which lead to a brawl, during which Ocean says he was called homophobic slurs by Brown. Ocean declined to press charges for the incident.\n\nTwo weeks later, Ocean beat Brown out for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the Grammys, and received a standing ovation, during which Brown remained seated.\n\nIn perhaps the strangest chapter in the saga of Chris Brown’s legal struggles, in 2016 he found himself in a standoff with Los Angeles police.\n\nBaylee Curran, a former Miss California winner, was over at Brown’s house when she and a friend began, according to her, admiring the singer’s jewelry. This lead to an alleged brandishing of a firearm by Brown and a call to the police, who arrived at Brown’s house and waited until they received a warrant to enter.\n\nThe entire time, Brown was posting Instagram videos, angrily reacting to the police’s presence. He would eventually be arrested, though charges were dismissed due to a lack of evidence.\n\nEven with Rihanna out of the mix and Tran and Brown together, the cycle continued, and things reached a breaking point after Brown fathered a child with another woman. A few months later, Tran posted on Instagram following an interview between Brown and Ryan Seacrest, saying, “Don't be mad at me because our relationship is over due to your lack of loyalty. You know what's weak?? You forcing yourself into my car.. my broken window.. blowing up my phone.. trying to shower me w gifts.. Man the fuck up and change the bs in your life like I've told you several times.”\n\nIn 2017, after alleging Brown “threatened to kill me to others, threatened me via text messages and threatened to harass my friends\" and that he had struck her several times, Tran was granted a five-year restraining order, something she felt was necessary for her safety."
