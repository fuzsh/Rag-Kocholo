        "text": "On October 12, 2012 Chris Brown posted a video declaring he’s in love with two people – presumably both Karreuche and Rihanna. “It’s just … when you share history with somebody, then you tend to fall in love with somebody else, it’s kind of difficult,” said Brown. “Is [there] such a thing as loving two people? I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s possible. But for me, I just … I feel like that.”\n\nBrown released a statement on October 4, 2012 confirming he and Karreuche were no longer dating and that he wanted to focus on his career and more. “I love Karreuche very much but I don’t want to see hurt over my friendship with Rihanna,” he said.\n\nRihanna tweeted her support for Brown on September 24, 2012, the day he would return to court after failing a drug test. She said, “I’m praying for you and wishing u the best today!” Brown replied with “Thank u so much.” The judge let Brown off with a warning.\n\nAt the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards in early September, Rihanna was seen greeting Chris Brown along with a number of other guests. The two were spotted having a private moment and even shared a short cordial kiss.\n\nIn February 2012, Rihanna shocked the world and asked Chris Brown to appear on the remix of her song “Birthday Cake.” The Bajan singer soon returned the favor and guest appeared on “Turn Up the Music,” from his Fortune album.\n\nAt the start of 2012, Chris Brown made a public announcement that would not be conducting interviews anymore. Perhaps it was an attempt to dodge further questions about his rocky past with Ri-Ri.\n\nIn March 2011, Chris Brown lost his cool on Good Morning America. Brown launched into an angry tirade after Robin Roberts asked about the 2009 assault against Rihanna. Brown apparently stomped off to his dressing room screaming and allegedly smashed a window with a chair. While no one in the studio saw him break the glass, sources say he was in the dressing room when it occured. Brown left the building with his shirt off. He later tweeted, “I’m so over people bringing this past sh*t up! Yet we praise Charlie Sheen and other celebs for their bullsh*t.” He later deleted the tweet.\n\nOn February 10, 2011 Rihanna’s restraining order against Chris Brown was eased as a judge allowed the two to have contact with each other. The judge imposed the condition that Brown must not “annoy, molest or harass” Rihanna.\n\nChris Brown appears for an arraignment at the Superior Court of Los Angeles County on March 5, 2009 in Los Angeles. Brown was charged with two felonies for assault. He was sentenced to five years probation and 1,400 of community service.\n\nThe twosome appeared to be comfy and in good spirits at a Clive Davis’ pre-Grammys party in Los Angeles on February 8, 2009. The fight between Chris Brown and Rihanna was prompted when she read a three-page text message from another woman on Brown’s phone. Authorities said Brown reacted by hitting her head against the passenger window. He then continued to drive while punching her with his right hand, according to reports.\n\nAs stated previously, Rihanna and Brown were seldom seen without the other in tow. Here the “Run It” singer gets silly with cameras as he shops with Rihanna in Paris in December 2008.\n\nThe lovely couple were seen getting close the night before 2008 Grammy Awards at Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy party and concert. Although the two denied dating, they would make a number of public appearances together in the coming months."
