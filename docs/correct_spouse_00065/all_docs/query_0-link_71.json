        "text": "A$AP Rocky appears to have taken a shot at Chris Brown in his new single D.M.B.\n\nThe 33-year-old rapper has been dating Rihanna – who is pregnant with his child – since 2019, and she features heavily in the video for his latest track, which seems to make reference to her ex.\n\nAt one point in the song, he raps: ‘I don’t beat my b***h, I need my b***h.’\n\nPlenty of fans have suggested the lyric refers to Brown attacking Rihanna in February 2009, when he was arrested and pleaded guilty to felony assault.\n\n‘Not Rocky taking shots at Chris Brown on a song that released on his bday,’ tweeted one fan, while another said: ‘Asap Rocky really came at Chris brown damn (sic)’\n\nAfter pleading guilty in 2009, Brown was sentenced to community service and mandatory anger management classes, as well as probation and a restraining order against Rihanna.\n\nAlthough they resumed their relationship several years on, Brown and Rihanna split for good in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Chris spent more than 100 days in prison after violating the terms of his parole which stemmed from the 2009 incident.\n\nMeanwhile, the music video for D.M.B. also sees the couple become husband and wife – for the video, at least.\n\nThe loved up couple pack on the PDA as they smoke, drink and get in trouble with the law together.\n\nAt one point, Rocky proposes by wearing teeth grills which spell out ‘Marry me’, while Rih’s spells out ‘I do’.\n\nThe video then shows them getting married, with the singer lifting a red veil as they are pronounced husband and wife, and friends throw rose petals over them after the ceremony.\n\nDespite the video causing plenty of speculation and excitement among fans, a source told TMZ the engagement and wedding were just for the promo.\n\nThe video comes after Rihanna and Rocky faced a difficult few weeks, with the rapper arrested at LAX airport in April in relation to a shooting that took place in November 2021.\n\nHe was released on bail pending investigation.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted A$AP Rocky’s representative for comment.\n\nGot a story?"
