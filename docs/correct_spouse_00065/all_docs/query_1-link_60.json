        "text": "HAILEY Bieber has admitted to dressing like her husband Justin's crush Rihanna after he fueled rumors of marital trouble on social media.\n\nEarlier this month, Justin, 30, was caught liking an Instagram video of Rihanna in lingerie by fans.\n\nOn Thursday, Hailey, 27, posted a candid photo of Rihanna, 36, on her Instagram Story with the caption, \"4eva the inspo.\"\n\nIn the photo, the We Found Love singer showed her unique style as she donned a white crop top under a dark wash denim jacket and matching jeans.\n\nThe Grammy-winning artist donned a hooded green puffer coat over the jean jacket that she paired with a matching Supreme baseball cap.\n\nRihanna wore a colorful scarf wrapped over her hat and under her chin and completed the outfit with subtle jewelry.\n\nJustin previously admitted to having a \"crush\" on the Barbadian singer.\n\nHe recently shared his appreciation when the star showed off her fit figure while modeling her new Savage X Fenty designs.\n\nIn an Instagram video, Rihanna wore pale green underwear as she rolled around in bed.\n\nThe Rude Boy singer smiled at the camera and adjusted her lingerie while posing in purple sheets monogrammed with \"Savage X Fenty.\"\n\nFans noticed that Justin liked the video before later un-liking it.\n\nHaile also liked the clip.\n\n\"Justin liked Riri's latest video about her lingerie brand Savage,\" one wrote on Reddit, accompanied by a screenshot of the like.\n\n\"He literally likes and comments on everyone's posts except [Hailey].. He didn't even like the birthday post she made for him lol\n\n\"The way he ignores her as if she doesn't exist is wild... I'm waiting for the damage control that Hailey will do now.\"\n\n\"He did used to always say he has a crush on Rihanna. But it’s funny how he isn’t giving Hailey any attention,\" another pointed out.\n\nCRUSHED\n\nIn 2011, Justin - then 15 - admitted to Ellen DeGeneres that he had a \"crush\" on the Stay singer.\n\nHe later told Chelsea Handler that he asked Rihanna out at a Los Angeles NBA All-Star game.\n\n\"Yeah, I asked her out. It didn't go so well since I'm not with her,\" he confessed on Chelsea Lately.\n\n\"I asked her out and she was basically like, 'You're too young.'\"\n\nRihanna was 23 at the time.\n\nAnother fan shared concern for Justin's relationship with Hailey - whom he married in 2018.\n\n\"Even if they aren’t separated, they definitely don’t have a healthy relationship,\" they commented on Reddit.\n\n\"It’s getting ridiculous,\" someone else posted.\n\nThis isn't the first time Justin has interacted with female singers on Instagram in recent weeks.\n\nLast month, he followed Sabrina Carpenter and left a \"flirty\" comment on a birthday video of Madison Beer.\n\nMARRIAGE TROUBLE?\n\nJustin's lingerie video \"like\" came amid rumors that his and Hailey's romance was on the rocks.\n\nThere have been multiple sightings of Justin without his wife in recent months.\n\nHailey's Stephen Baldwin, sparked concern for her marriage last month when he pleaded with fans to pray for the couple.\n\nHe urged fans to \"take a moment to offer a little prayer\" for Justin and Hailey in a video on Instagram.\n\nSoon after, Hailey insisted there was no truth to speculation that the pair were headed for divorce.\n\nThe model said the rumors are \"made out of thin air.\"\n\n\"I know it may be fun feeding into these stories but just know they're always false...\" she wrote on her Story.\n\nHailey added, \"Sorry to spoil it.\"\n\nSPOTTED TOGETHER\n\nOn Tuesday, Justin was spotted walking away from his wife after a Los Angeles date night.\n\nIn a video of the two stars, the pop music icon and the Victoria's Secret model were spotted leaving the Italian restaurant Madeo.\n\nThe couple left yards apart, with Justin walking at a brisk pace out of the restaurant.\n\nHailey stopped to join their friends outside but Justin headed in the opposite direction - rushing away seemingly without saying goodbye to his spouse.\n\nOther photos from the night paint a similar picture, capturing the duo socializing with their large friend group.\n\nJustin, in a white baseball cap, stood on one side of the group and appeared to be chatting to a couple of women with a dog.\n\nHailey, meanwhile, went lowkey with a red cap covering her hair and stood on the fringes of the group as she looked in the opposite direction to her husband."
