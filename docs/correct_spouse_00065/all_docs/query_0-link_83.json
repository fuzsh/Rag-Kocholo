They announced they had reunited late last year shortly after Chris, 23, had split from his girlfriend of a year, Karrueche.\n\n'I keep my thing in my pants. I'm a respectable dude'\n\nBut after the brief overlap, Chris insists he is now a one-woman man, saying “I keep my thing in my pants, I'm a respectable dude.\"\n\n[ASSETHERE=image]\n\n\"I think the risk of losing whatever it is [relationship with Rihanna] is worse.”\n\nDuring their split, Rihanna, 25, also dated other men including rapper Drake and baseball star Matt Kemp. And Chris said it hurt seeing his ex with other men, telling the hosts that the pair got any hurt out on the table beforer they rekindled their romance.\n\nHe said “Of course it bothered me.
