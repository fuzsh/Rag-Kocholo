        "text": "ASAP Rocky and Rihanna were allegedly linking up in 2013. Then again in 2020.\n\nRumors kicked off in January 2020 that Rihanna had moved on from longtime boyfriend Hassan Jameel to A$AP Rocky. They had been spotted laughing together backstage at the 2020 Yams Day Benefit Concert in New York City.\n\nA source told E! News at the time that Rihanna is single, and the pair are just friends. \"She's hanging out with A$AP Rocky, but she is not dating him,\" the source said.\n\nHowever, in November 2020, a source reportedly confirmed to People that the longtime friends were officially dating. Page Six reported that they were seen having dinner with friends at the Beatrice Inn in New York that same month. In July of 2020, Rihanna featured A$AP Rocky in her Fenty Skin campaign, and the pair did multiple interviews together to promote the line.\n\nThe weekend of January 28, 2022, Rihanna revealed she and A$AP Rocky were expecting their first child together as they walked around his hometown of Harlem with the singer showing off her baby bump.\n\nThe couple welcomed their baby boy on May 13, 2022, per a report from TMZ.\n\nRihanna, born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, has captivated audiences worldwide since her explosive debut in 2005 with \"Pon de Replay.\" The Barbadian singer, actress, and businesswoman has continually reinvented herself and her sound, earning her multiple awards and the title of one of the world's best-selling music artists. In addition to her chart-topping hits, she ventured into the realms of fashion and beauty, launching Fenty Beauty and Savage X Fenty lingerie line, which have been praised for promoting inclusivity and diversity. Prior to her relationship with ASAP Rocky, Rihanna drew significant attention for her on-again-off-again romance with fellow musician Chris Brown.\n\nThe rumor mill went into overdrive in mid-2016 when reports emerged that ASAP Rocky and supermodel Kendall Jenner were dating after being spotted together on multiple outings and events. Their whirlwind romance began after meeting through mutual friends, with the couple sharing a penchant for high-fashion and chic vibes. They graced red carpets together, attended luxurious parties, and even made a notorious appearance at the 2017 Met Gala. Their relationship, however, seemed to fizzle out by the end of 2017, with both parties moving on to other relationships and commitments.\n\nKendall Jenner rose to fame as part of the Kardashian-Jenner family that dominated pop culture thanks to their reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Unlike her sisters, who ventured into business and social media, Kendall pursued a highly successful career in modeling, strutting down the runways for prestigious designers and becoming a Victoria's Secret Angel. The elder Jenner sister has graced numerous magazine covers, and her chic sense of style has gained her significant recognition in the fashion world. Apart from her relationship with ASAP Rocky, Kendall has previously been linked to other high-profile celebrities, including NBA stars Blake Griffin and Ben Simmons.\n\nASAP Rocky's dalliance with Sophie Brussaux, a former French adult film star, was short-lived and sparked much debate among fans in 2015. The pair's low-key relationship began after meeting at a party in Paris, leading to romantic rendezvous in various locations and hints of their partnership on social media. While their time together seemed fleeting, it garnered attention as one of the rapper's lesser-known relationships. By early 2016, the couple drifted apart, and Sophie went on to make headlines with another rapper, Drake.\n\nSophie Brussaux, who once performed under the pseudonym Rosee Divine, has since retired from the adult film industry and pursued her passion for the arts. She now works as a painter and a sculptor, showcasing her artwork in galleries around the world. Her relationship with Drake catapulted her into the limelight, even more, when she revealed he was the father of her son, Adonis. Despite the initial controversy surrounding their relationship and Adonis's paternity, Sophie and Drake appear to maintain a cordial co-parenting situation.\n\nBetween late 2014 and early 2015, ASAP Rocky and reality TV star Tahiry Jose had a brief but steamy relationship. They were spotted together at various events, engaging in PDA, and frequently exchanging flirtatious comments on social media. First introduced by mutual friends, the couple had an intense connection that generated much interest from fans and onlookers. However, their short-lived romance quickly burned out, and both parties moved on to focus on their careers and other relationships.\n\nTahiry Jose gained notoriety for her appearances on the reality television show Love & Hip Hop: New York. She became known for her no-nonsense attitude, captivating beauty, and tumultuous relationship with rapper Joe Budden. Apart from her stint on reality television, Tahiry has pursued modeling and acting, appearing in various music videos and independent films. The fiery New York native continues to captivate audiences with her strong personality and endeavors in the world of fashion and entertainment.\n\nASAP Rocky and Kylie Jenner set the rumor mill in motion when they were spotted together in the summer of 2015, igniting whispers of a potential romance. The two seemed to have an instant connection after meeting through mutual friends and subsequently attending events together, including the singer's concert at Hollywood Bowl. Although the relationship was never confirmed, they continued to fuel speculation by posting photos together on social media. Ultimately, their alleged fling seemed to fizzle out towards the end of 2015, as each moved on to different relationships.\n\nKylie Jenner rose to prominence as part of the ubiquitous Kardashian-Jenner family, which continues to dominate popular culture thanks to Keeping Up with the Kardashians. As the youngest sibling, Kylie capitalized on her fame through her eponymous beauty brand, Kylie Cosmetics, which transformed her into the world's youngest self-made billionaire. Not just content with a booming beauty empire, Kylie has also dabbled in fashion, launching clothing lines with her sister, Kendall Jenner. In addition to ASAP Rocky, Kylie has been linked to other high-profile relationships, most notably with rapper Travis Scott, with whom she shares a daughter, Stormi.\n\nASAP Rocky's relationship with model Chanel Iman began in early 2013 and quickly became serious, with reports suggesting the couple might be engaged at one point. The rapper and the Victoria's Secret Angel were inseparable during their relationship, attending public events together, engaging in romantic getaways, and sharing their love for each other on social media. Despite their undeniable chemistry and affection, the couple decided to part ways after nearly two years of dating, citing busy schedules and the difficulties of maintaining a long-distance relationship.\n\nChanel Iman, born in Atlanta, Georgia, stormed onto the modeling scene as a teenager, signing with prestigious agency Ford Models and becoming a fixture on international runways. She has modeled for high-fashion designers and graced the covers of notable magazines, solidifying her status as a top model. Her foray into acting includes appearances in films like Dope and Mad Families. Following her relationship with ASAP Rocky, Chanel found love with NFL player Sterling Shepard, marrying him in 2018 and starting a family with two daughters."
