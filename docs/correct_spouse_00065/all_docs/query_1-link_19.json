        "text": "A$AP Rocky and Rihanna‘s reported marriage plans are as laidback as you’d expect from the ultra-cool couple. On June 21, the couple sparked marriage rumors when 34-year-old rapper took to the stage for a Spotify concert at the Cannes Lions Festival on Wednesday night and called the “Umbrella” singer his “wife” in front of a crowd of fans.\n\nRocky dedicated his 2022 song “D.M.B.” to the 35-year-old singer who is expecting their second child. Rocky told fans his “beautiful wife [was] in the f—ing building. I love her.” However, a source has revealed the truth about the duo’s plans to tie the knot in a new Us Weekly report.\n\nAre Rihanna and A$AP Rocky married?\n\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky have been dating since the end of 2020 but are not believed to be engaged or married. Rocky calling the Barbados native his wife is likely just a term of adoration and not an announcement about their nuptials.\n\nA source claims Rihanna and A$AP Rocky plan to get married but no time soon.\n\nUs Weekly’s source said the couple talked about marriage before Rihanna became pregnant for a second time. So, needless to say, this new baby on the way likely shifted their plans. The source stated: “They’ve talked about getting married down the line. [They] both think of each other as the one they’re going to spend the rest of their life with.”\n\nRocky and Rihanna are also unlikely to follow a traditional route, according to a second source. In fact, their marriage plans could change at the drop of a hat and even their inner circle may be kept on their toes. “[They] are actually enjoying this guessing game that’s going on amongst fans and even their close friends,” the second source added.\n\nThe longtime friends and occasional collaborators first sparked romance rumors as far back as 2013, according to Us Weekly, when Rocky served as the opening act during Rihanna’s Diamonds World Tour. After they arrived together and posed on the red carpet at the British Fashion Awards in London in December 2019, more rumors soon followed until they were officially linked the following year.\n\nThey announced they were expecting their first child together, a boy, in January 2022 with a photoshoot in New York City showing Rihanna proudly displaying her pregnancy bump.\n\nRocky and Rihanna also sparked marriage rumors last year after the New York rapper dropped the music video for “D.M.B.” in which he can be seen asking Rihanna to marry him before the couple walked down the aisle together after a fictional wedding.\n\nIn a March 2023 interview with British Vogue, Rihanna gushed about being closer than ever to Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, since welcoming their baby boy in May 2022. She told the outlet: “We’re best friends with a baby,” and talked about Rocky’s adorable relationship with their son.\n\n“Their connection is undeniable. The second Rocky makes eye contact with him he is on fire. The whole thing they say about sons and moms, it’s a myth. Sons and fathers is crazy. I realized that the validation that you really need as a boy is from your father.”\n\nTheir son, RZA Athelston Mayers, is about to become a big brother after the Fenty Beauty founder debuted her baby bump during her Super Bowl Halftime show in February. Last night, as Rocky dedicated his track to the mother of his son, Rihanna was seen in the crowd in a form-fitting sheer dress that showed off her growing baby bump.\n\nThese two may not have tied the knot, but they certainly seem happier and closer than ever as they continue to expand their family."
