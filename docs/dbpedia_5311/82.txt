[New York, NY, April 10 2024] The White House proclaimed April 15th through April 19th a “FAFSA Week of Action” in an effort to jumpstart a low FAFSA application rate due to the changes in the online form. Goddard Riverside Options Institute supports school and community based organization counselors who assist students that are most impacted by the rollout of the Better FAFSA— first generation college goers. The Institute has committed to offer their new online course “WTF-What the FAFSA?” for a $20 discount to advisors who register for it during the five-day initiative.

“WTF-What The FAFSA? Changes for the 2024-2025 Aid Year” explains the latest changes to the new FAFSA form. Based on a recent in-person workshop, Options Institute training team expedited the creation of this much needed online course to bring college access counselors up to speed on the important changes in the FAFSA so that they can best assist students applying for aid in the years to come. The asynchronous course explains how to support students who are most impacted by the updates, allows learners to access it anytime for up to 30 days, and should take about 30 minutes to complete.

When is it discounted?: College access practitioners can register for this course between April 15th and Friday April 19th and receive a $20 discount off the $100 price.

What the course covers:

· Identifying a student’s “contributors” to the FAFSA and how they can create an FSA ID, even without a Social Security number.

· Explaining the importance and convenience of having a student’s contributors consent to the new IRS Data Direct Exchange (DDX).

· Helping students understand their Student Aid Index and the new FAFSA Submission Summary that describes their financial aid situation.

· Mentoring and advocating for students claiming independence on the FAFSA.
