        "text": "A diagnosis of cancer is always stressful and potentially tragic. Except for genetic cases, cancer is often random and difficult to predict.\n\nThatâs not the case when you develop cancer due to toxic dust exposure from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nWhether you worked as a unit of first responders, as part of a debris removal crew, or simply lived or worked in the area, you could be eligible for compensation from the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act.\n\nThe VCF provides financial support to eligible members of the 9/11 community that have been diagnosed with one of more than 75 types of cancer.\n\nAccording to academics and air pollution experts, the dust from the collapsed World Trade Center buildings contained over 2,500 contaminants.\n\nSadly, office workers, residents, students, construction workersÂ even people just raveling through the area to work and the brave heroes and survivors exposed to toxic dust from 9/11 continue to be at high cancer risk with new diagnoses emerging on a regular basis.\n\nUnderstanding the road to free lifetime medical care and monetary compensation required you to know the relationship between the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF).\n\nWhat is a WTC-certified illness?\n\nOn September 11, 2001, the entire country watched in shock as the terrorist attacks and the horrifying aftermath unfolded.\n\nMany of the people initially on the scene at the Twin Towers, including survivors, first responders, rescue workers, NYPD, and FDNY were subjected to the heartbreak that took place that day and were also exposed to numerous types of hazards.\n\nWell into 2002, as the cleanup commenced on lower Manhattan, recovery workers and many others in the general population were routinely exposed to conditions that would ultimately lead to serious illnesses, including several types of cancers and lung disease. While some peopleâs illness emerged immediately, many WTC victims wouldnât learn of their illnesses until years later.\n\nOver time, it became apparent that people who were exposed to carcinogens on or after 9/11 had an increased risk of dozens of types of different cancers, including thyroid cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, and myeloma, to name a few.\n\nThe types of illnesses suffered by 9/11 victims as outlined and approved by the World Trade Center Victim Fund include a variety of cancers, respiratory illnesses, and musculoskeletal disorders, and death as a result of any of these illnesses. 9/11 Cancer Types\n\nMany years after the WTC fund was established, numerous types of cancers were added, and the list of cancer cases continues to grow.\n\nYou did not have to be present on 9/11 to receive free lifetime medical care or VCF compensation.\n\nThe differences between both 9/11 programs: WTCHP vs VCF\n\nAs separate entities, you can receive treatment for your illnesses from the World Trade Center Health Program, without cost if you have no other medical coverage. Monetary compensation can be awarded to you by the Victim Compensation Fund.\n\nGenerally, certification of your illness by the Health Program as related to your exposure to the toxins is part of the process to receive compensation from the Fund.Â\n\nInitially, a fund was opened to support victims suffering WTC illnesses and their families around 2003, but it eventually ran out of money. In 2010, Congress authorized approximately $3 billion to continue support with the signing of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act).\n\nThe Zadroga Act was extended in 2015 with another $4 billion. Once again, the fund was coming close to exhaustion, and in July 2019 was extended again through the Never Forget the Heroes Act. With this passage, the World Trade Center Victim Fund will be funded until 2090 with essentially unlimited funding since Congress will continue to authorize additional funds for 9/11 victims who suffer health issues stemming from the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe two 9/11 programs, the WTC Health Program and the VCF go hand-in-hand, but it's essential to understand they are two distinct programs.\n\nItâs important for victims, or their families, who seek assistance from these programs to know how they differ.Â\n\nThe Gregory Cannata & Associates law firm is dedicated to ensuring that 9/11 victims receive the medical treatment and compensation they deserve.\n\nOur lawyers are ready to assist you in applying to both 9/11 programs, the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF).\n\nIf eligible, youâll receive free lifetime access to the specially designed health program and a potential tax-free cash award.\n\nIf you or a loved one were diagnosed with a 9/11-related cancer, our 9/11 attorneys can help.\n\nCall 1-888-982-8428 today or contact us online for a free lawyer consultation.\n\nWorld Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP)\n\nThe WTC Health Program provides free medical monitoring and lifetime healthcare benefits for 9/11-related cancers and other illnesses if you donât have other medical coverage.\n\n9/11 victims do not receive any financial compensation from this program.\n\nVictim Compensation Fund (VCF)\n\nThe VCF is a financial compensation program, and victims can receive monetary benefits for many of the designated illnesses as outlined, including more than 75 different cancers.\n\nItâs important for 9/11 victims to understand to qualify for the VCF, they must be âcertifiedâ by the WTC Health Program as treatment-eligible and that the illness or cancer diagnosis was directly linked to 9/11 exposures to toxins and carcinogens.\n\nOnce certified, it does not guarantee approval to receive funds from the VCF. The application process is complicated. An experienced 9/11 attorney can ensure all the necessary details are documented and submitted.\n\nMissing one step or a piece of supporting documentation can lead to a WTC fund claim being denied and delays of being accepted into the World Trade Center Health Program.\n\nTypes of cancer linked to 9/11\n\nAt this time, more than 75 different cancers are potentially WTCHP and VCF eligible. Malignant neoplasms are a primary cancer type; these are cancerous tumors or abnormal growths that spread to different parts of the body.\n\nGenerally the cancers covered include both solid tumor cancers such as breast, thyroid, lung, prostate, brain cancers,Â as well as blood cell and lymphoid cancers, such as leukemia or lymphoma.Â\n\nEven if you donât see your specific cancer listed, you should reach out to our firm as other cancers may be considered including a number of rare cancers.Â\n\nOur attorneys will help you enroll in the World Trade Center Health Program and supply them with the appropriate records they need.\n\nAfter a review of those records and in some circumstances a visit to the Health Program, if appropriate a Certification of causation will be issued for your specific illnesses.\n\nIf you are without resources to pay for medical care, generally the WTCHP will provide treatment without cost to you.\n\nOur 9/11 cancer attorneys monitor the progress of the process and certification is a key element of your approval within the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.\n\nChildhood cancers\n\nCancers diagnosed in a person under the age of 20 may be eligible to participate in one or both 9/11 programs.\n\nBlood & Lymphoid tissue cancers\n\nNumerous 9/11 victims are being diagnosed with blood and lymphoid tissue cancer, including but not limited to; leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma.\n\nTypes of specific cancers include;\n\nDiffuse Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n\nFollicular (Nodular)\n\nNon-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n\nHodgkin's Disease\n\nLymphoid Leukemia\n\nLeukemia of Unspecified Cell Type\n\nMalignant Immunoproliferative Diseases\n\nMonocytic Leukemia\n\nMyeloma\n\nMalignant Plasma Cell Neoplasms\n\nMyeloid Leukemia, and any sub-categories related to these cancers.\n\nDigestive system cancer\n\nMany 9/11 survivors are being diagnosed with cancers connected to the digestive system.\n\nTypes of cancers include;\n\nColon\n\nEsophagus\n\nLiver and Intrahepatic Bile Ducts\n\nDigestive Organs\n\nIntestinal Tract\n\nRectum and Stomach Cancer\n\nThere are also several subsets of cancers that are often diagnosed also related to the digestive system.\n\nEye &Â orbit cancer\n\nCancer impacting the eye or orbital areas are also common 9/11-related cancers diagnosed. Specific cancers can affect the cornea, orbit, retina, glands, and ducts.\n\nFemale breast & reproductive organ cancer\n\nCancers, specifically affecting females, are often diagnosed as a result of 9/11 exposures. Types of cancer often found include breast cancer, affecting the general breast, nipple, areola, overlapping lesions, and all of the breast's quadrants. Ovarian cancer has also been directly linked to carcinogen exposure.\n\nHead and neck cancer\n\nHead and neck cancers can manifest in many ways, including but not limited to the following:\n\nAccessory sinuses\n\nTongue\n\nMouth\n\nLarynx\n\nGums\n\nHypopharynx\n\nLips\n\nNasopharynx\n\nSalivary Glands\n\nOropharynx\n\nCheeks\n\nPalate\n\nGlands\n\nTonsils\n\nPiriform sinus\n\nRespiratory system\n\nCancer patients who experience malignant cells within the bodyâs respiratory system have also been heavily linked to 9/11 exposures.\n\nCancers include lung cancer, but those affecting the bronchial tubes, heart, pleura, respiratory tracts, and trachea have often been diagnosed.\n\nSkin cancers\n\nSkin cancer is often connected to toxic exposure stemming from 9/11 include malignant melanomas and malignant neoplasms of the skin.\n\nThe range of skin cancers diagnosed in patients includes general areas of the body, but not excluding sensitive areas, such as the eyelid, scalp, or lips.\n\nSoft tissue cancer\n\nCancer often attacks the soft tissues of the body, and, as a result, many WTC victims have been afflicted with related illnesses. Soft tissue cancers include, but are not limited to, connective tissues, peripheral nerves, and the nervous system.\n\nThis is just a general categorization of the cancer types associated with carcinogen exposure. Other cancer types typically connected to 9/11 toxins include mesothelioma, thyroid cancer, and the urinary system cancers. Urinary cancers can affect the bladder, kidney, urinary organs, prostate, and urethra.\n\nRare types of cancers linked to 9/11\n\nCancers that occur in fewer than 15 cases per 100,000 persons per year that meet certain criteria are considered to be rare cancer types. These cancers are eligible for certification by the WTC Health Program, but they must meet a specific threshold to be categorized as rare cancers. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the list of rare cancers includes, but are not limited to the following different types of cancer.\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the:\n\nAdrenal gland and other endocrine glands\n\nAnus and anal canal\n\nBone and articular cartilage\n\nBreast cancer (men)\n\nCentral nervous system cancers in the brain, cranial nerves, meninges, and spinal cord\n\nGallbladder and biliary tract\n\nPancreas\n\nPenis and testes\n\nPlacenta\n\nSmall intestine\n\nThymus\n\nVagina, vulva, and cervix uteri (invasive only)\n\nOther rare cancers include malignant neuroendocrine neoplasm, which includes carcinoid tumors, along with Myeloid neoplasms. The latter includes;\n\nMyeloproliferative Neoplasms\n\nMyelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\n\nMyelodysplastic Syndromes\n\nMyeloid malignancies stemming from eosinophilia and abnormalities of growth factor receptors.\n\nIf a rare cancer is diagnosed that is not on this list, it may still be eligible. This list is not exhaustive by any means. Cancers meeting the definition of rate cancer can be considered by the WTC Health Program for certification. If you're suffering from a type of rare cancer you believe is connected to toxic exposure you experienced on or after September 11, 2001, we encourage you to schedule a free consultation with one of our WTC 9/11 attorneys.\n\n9/11 cancer statistics\n\nSadly, more than 100,000 responders and survivors have been identified as eligible for the WTC Health Program, and many more emerge every day.\n\nOf the people enrolled in the program, more than 15,000 are cancer patients.\n\nFurthermore, a study that came out earlier in 2020 found police and recovery workers who spent time-saving lives, recovering bodies, and cleaning up the collapse of the Twin Towers are learning they have a variety of different types of cancers.\n\nThese cancers include thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, and increased risks of other cancers.\n\nIn fact, thyroid risk is more than double that of the general population, and leukemia risk is 41% higher. FDNY workers are also being studied separately and at least 200 firefighters have died from 9/11-related illnesses.\n\nIt is anticipated that cancer rates for many first responders, recovery workers, fire department members, along with people in the general population, will, unfortunately, continue to rise over time.\n\nâ\n\nVCF cancer payouts\n\nThe VCF considers eligibility for cancer payouts in two general categories, economic and non-economic losses.\n\nA non-economic loss which is meant to provide compensation for the pain and suffering of your illness. This includes the physical suffering you have endured and will endure as a result of living with cancer or other World Trade Center-related illnesses.\n\nThe Fund also considers economic loss, generally meant to compensate you for lost earnings as a result of your illness. If you suffering completely debilitating, awards can generally compensate your lost earning through age 65.\n\nIt is critical to work with an experienced personal injury lawyer with extensive knowledge of the Zadroga Act and the Victim Compensation Fund who can aggressively argue and submit proof why you should receive the maximum allowable amounts for both non-economic and economic losses.\n\nIf your loved one has passed away from his/her 9/11 illness, an additional claim is made on behalf of the estate allowing for additional compensation.\n\nâ\n\nAre you eligible for a VCF cancer payout?\n\nBased in New York City, Gregory J. Cannata & Associates has the expertise to assist you with determining your eligibility for compensation from the VCF, applying to the World Trade Center Health Program, and filing your cancer claim with the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.\n\nEven if you have applied in the past and received a denial or arenât sure if you meet current eligibility guidelines, we encourage you to reserve your free consultation by calling 1-888-982-8428.

Numerous people have received substantial awards from the VCF to be eligible for the program; Victims do not have to have been present on September 11th.Â\n\nAn experienced VCF attorney can evaluate your situation, determine your eligibility, and help you to file applications to register for the WTC Health Program and the World Trade Center Fund.
