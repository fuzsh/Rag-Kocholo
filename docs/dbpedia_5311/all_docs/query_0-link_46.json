        "text": "Gibbs Farm, a large sculpture park in North Auckland, New Zealand, is home to a collection of incredible, large scale artworks by some of the world’s most significant artists. Because most all the works are commissioned, artists are able to cater to the lay of the land. Neil Dawon’s Horizons is probably one of my favorites – not only is it one of the earliest sculptures to be commissioned for the Gibbs Farm, it also sits on one of the highest points of the property. I love the tromp l’oeil effect as what seems like a floating, drawn piece of paper is actually a massive sculpture made of welded steel. This place is definitely going on the bucket list.\n\n(top to bottom: Horizons by Neil Dawson; Dismemberment by Anish Kapoor; Red Cloud Confrontation in Landscape by Leon van den Ejikel)"
