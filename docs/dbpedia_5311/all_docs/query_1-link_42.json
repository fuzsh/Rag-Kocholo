I am talking to my son with one window down and the engine still running. After about 7 minutes parked the hazards suddenly come on. I didn't hit anything on the dash or the key fob. No matter how many times I hit the hazards button they will not go off so I turn off the engine and wait a few seconds and hit the hazards button again and they go off. Restart the truck and start driving away when I notice that the instrument cluster has changed. I keep it on the MPH setting but now it's showing me the tire pressure. I change it back to MPH and drive home with no more issues. Just very odd to me.\n\nThoughts?\n\nNot sure, but last week when we got that weather mess here in TX, my tire pressure dropped. I took it to Discount Tire to have them aired up and while I was sitting there my flashers started with no intervention from me. As soon as he was done filling the tires, they stopped flashing. Not sure it's the same issue, but may be worth a call to the service department to see if tire pressure has anything to do with hazard lights going off.\n\nNot sure, but last week when we got that weather mess here in TX, my tire pressure dropped.

Our trucks have a Tire Fill Assist where the hazards will flash when the pressure gets close to correct, and then the horn will chirp once it's hit. The hazards will go off once the tire is filled.\n\nHere is another thread about this. Seems the fix would be to turn off the tire fill alert in uconnect settings.\n\nHazards flashing/Horn honking while in park?\n\nHad stopped to take a call putting my '19 in park when my instrument cluster switched to the tire pressure screen, hazards turned on automatically and the horn began honking.... WTF? turned truck off and restarted - hasnt happened since. 10k miles on it....\n\nThis only happened once in the 2 weeks I have owned this so don't think it's a major deal but still confusing.
