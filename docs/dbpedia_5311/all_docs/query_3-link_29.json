        "text": "After 32 months, the final phase of the WTC Steel memorial was completed on June 16, 2012. The dedication was absolutely wonderful. The weather was great, the site was prepared and was in immaculate condition, the speakers were eloquent, the flag folding was precise, the unveiling of the plaque and the laying of the wreath was done with dignity and the food was great. The performance of the bag piper, drummer and the singing from the musical group “Plainfolk” tugged at everyone’s heart. The attendance was over whelming the final count of people that had preregistered and the invited guest came to a total of 343. That is the same number of Firefighters and Paramedics that were killed at the WTC on September 11, 2001. What a coincidence!\n\nPhase III: To design, build and dedicate. We plan to hold an unveiling and formal dedication in the spring of 2012 at the Memorial site in Boylston. We will keep you informed so you can plan on attending this Historic Event. This has been a lot of work and more to come. But, I must say a special Thank You to Bill Snodgrass (International Secretary) for handling the lion’s share of this process. Also a heartfelt Thank You to all of you that have worked so hard to make this come true. I am sure that this will be a great addition to our memorial site.\n\nAs you can see, we have met our goals in the desired time. This was a major accomplishment for not only those involved, but for the Red Knights as a whole. Once again, congratulations and thank you to the entire committee and all who worked so hard to make this come true.\n\nDavid J. Emery"
