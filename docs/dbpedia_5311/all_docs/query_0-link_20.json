        "text": "The waive is not dead. But there’s no question it’s not what it used to be in the MINI community. MINI USA wants to change that and is doing something rather bold about it. The brand has created a “WTF” (Wave to Friends) Day with effort to bring back the friendly wave tradition among MINI owners on the birthday of the brand. National MINI Wave to Friends (WTF) Day, which will join an already significant date in MINI’s history – August 26 – the birthday of MINI back in 1959.\n\nOFFICIAL RELEASE: MINI USA Announces WTF Day\n\nOver the past few years, the MINI Wave has fallen out of common use, prompting many owners and even MINI headquarters to proclaim: “WTF!”\n\nThe new national holiday with its attention-grabbing acronym – which actually doesn’t mean what some may initially think – encourages MINI owners of any tenure to “be the waver” by gesturing to fellow MINI drivers on the road – not only on National MINI WTF Day but every day of the year going forward. An age-old tradition in the MINI community, the friendly and welcoming “MINI Wave” has been a signature gesture among MINI owners that reinforced a sense of camaraderie that came with buying a MINI.\n\n“We believe that MINI is the only car that comes standard with friends,” said Mike Peyton, Chief Motorer & Vice President, MINI of the Americas. “This initiative is designed to renew that friendly and welcoming spirit and show our MINI owners how many other MINI friends they have out on the road.”\n\nThe social and digital media campaign supporting National MINI WFT Day starts today, with the messaging to remain an important brand theme moving forward. The campaign was teased earlier this month on MINI USA’s social media handles by featuring actual social posts from owners showing their frustration with other owners not reciprocating the wave when waved upon."
