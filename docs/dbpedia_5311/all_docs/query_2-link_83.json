        "text": "Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives on September 11, 2001. Immediately after the attack, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christie Whitman announced that New Yorkers need not worry about breathing in the dust-filled air. People were told that the air was safe and free of toxic chemicals. This was not true. People began to come down with illnesses soon thereafter and untold numbers have died as a result. It was not until 2011 that the Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act began, which gives support to 21,000 victims of the toxic, dangerous air caused by the 9/11 attack. It took an additional two years (until 2013) for the list of 50 different types cancer to be added to the diseases that were eligible for compensation. If you or a loved one has become ill from dangerous air exposure to the 9/11 attacks, you may be able to receive compensation under the Zadroga Act. Contact an experienced New York World Trade Center attorney to learn more.\n\nTypes of Toxic Chemicals and Air Pollutants\n\nThe range of diseases and conditions caused by air pollution that victims of the 9/11 attacks suffer from are vast. Below is a list of toxic chemicals and pollutants and the resulting conditions they are linked to:\n\nAsbestos\n\nAsbestos is one of the most well-known and deadly substances that was released into the air on 9/11. Approximately 300 to 400 tons of asbestos went into Manhattanâ€™s air for firefighters, police, paramedics, and thousands of civilians to breathe. Asbestos causes mesothelioma, which is a cancer that affects the lungs, abdomen, and chest cavity. It can cause scarring of the lungs, thickening of the membrane surrounding the lungs, and pooling fluid between the lungs and chest cavity. Asbestos is linked to the following types of cancer, but more study is needed for confirmation:\n\nGastrointestinal tract cancer\n\nThroat cancer\n\nKidney cancer\n\nBrain cancer\n\nBladder cancer and\n\nLarynx (voice box) cancer\n\nBenzene\n\nHeavy or long term benzene exposure can lead to leukemia, a decrease in red blood cells, which leads to anemia, damages to bone marrow, excessive bleeding, and damage to the immune system, which causes increased risk of infection.\n\nLead\n\nLead exposure has a long list of complications, the most concerning being learning difficulties in children, damage to the kidneys and nervous system, seizures, unconsciousness, and death."
