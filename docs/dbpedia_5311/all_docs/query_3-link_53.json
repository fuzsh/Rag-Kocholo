        "text": "Media Contact: Trish Anderton tanderton@goddard.org | 929-249-1449\n\n[New York, NY, April 10 2024] The White House proclaimed April 15th through April 19th a “FAFSA Week of Action” in an effort to jumpstart a low FAFSA application rate due to the changes in the online form. Goddard Riverside Options Institute supports school and community based organization counselors who assist students that are most impacted by the rollout of the Better FAFSA— first generation college goers. The Institute has committed to offer their new online course “WTF-What the FAFSA?” for a $20 discount to advisors who register for it during the five-day initiative.\n\n“WTF-What The FAFSA? Changes for the 2024-2025 Aid Year” explains the latest changes to the new FAFSA form. Based on a recent in-person workshop, Options Institute training team expedited the creation of this much needed online course to bring college access counselors up to speed on the important changes in the FAFSA so that they can best assist students applying for aid in the years to come. The asynchronous course explains how to support students who are most impacted by the updates, allows learners to access it anytime for up to 30 days, and should take about 30 minutes to complete.\n\nWhen is it discounted?: College access practitioners can register for this course between April 15th and Friday April 19th and receive a $20 discount off the $100 price.\n\nWhat the course covers:\n\n· Identifying a student’s “contributors” to the FAFSA and how they can create an FSA ID, even without a Social Security number.\n\n· Explaining the importance and convenience of having a student’s contributors consent to the new IRS Data Direct Exchange (DDX).\n\n· Helping students understand their Student Aid Index and the new FAFSA Submission Summary that describes their financial aid situation.\n\n· Mentoring and advocating for students claiming independence on the FAFSA.\n\nThe Options Institute is New York City’s leading provider of professional development for practitioners working with underrepresented students on their postsecondary pathways. In 2005, the Goddard Riverside Options Center launched the Options Institute, a professional development center, to train school and CBO counselors with the skills and knowledge needed to provide college access services. In 2012-2015 Options Institute contracted with the New York City Department of Education to train school counselors from nearly all city high schools. Other Options Institute clients include Chicago Public Schools, iMentor, New York Cares, CUNY College Advising Corp., Destination: College and Brooklyn Library.\n\nFor more information and to register: www.collegeaccesstraining.org For further information contact: optionsCAT@goddard.org\n\n***\n\nABOUT GODDARD RIVERSIDE: Goddard Riverside strives toward a fair and just society where all people can make choices that lead to better lives for themselves and their families.
