        "text": "Two races down, three to go! Plus… a small race in Paris in between.\n\nAbu Dhabi was set to kick the season off on 8-9 March 2024, but unfortunately the event had to be cancelled.\n\nYokohama instead started the racing in May, and saw first-time wins in both events – Morgan Pearson for the men and Léonie Periault for the women.\n\nNext up was Cagliari at the end of June, where several federations made their final team selections for the Paris Olympic Games. Alex Yee set his stall out with a convincing win over Hayden Wilde, while home favourite Cassandre Beaugrand took her first Olympic-distance win when it mattered.\n\nKeep on reading to find out what happened in the series in 2023, who’s racing in the next event in Hamburg over the weekend of 13-14 July, and what the rest of the short-course season looks like…\n\nWhat happened in the 2023 WTCS?\n\nThe first round in Abu Dhabi on 3 March saw double GB gold, as Beth Potter notched up her first-ever WTCS win and Alex Yee put in a masterclass performance to take his fifth WTCS victory.\n\nThe second-round spoils in Yokohama went to Potter’s teammate Sophie Coldwell – her first WTCS victory – and NZ’s Hayden Wilde.\n\nThe third round in Cagliari, Sardinia, was yet another Brit double as Georgia Taylor Brown rediscovered that world-beating form to take her first win of the season and Yee once again got the better of the field to make it two wins from two race starts.\n\nMontreal hosted the fourth round where Potter reigned supreme yet again. In a slightly depleted men’s field, Aussie Matt Hauser took his first-ever WTCS win.\n\nRound five took place in a familiar venue but with an entirely new format for the German city of Hamburg – the eliminator, which has so far only been contested in Montreal. The race also acted as the first-ever World Super Sprint Champs.\n\nTaking the top honours were Hayden Wilde and Cassandre Beaugrand, for their second and first wins of the season, respectively.\n\nThe penultimate race took place in Sunderland, UK, for what could be the last WTCS outing for some time on UK shores.\n\nBut back on the race course it was a French sweep as Pierre Le Corre beat teammate Leo Bergere in a sprint to take his first WTCS win; Cassandre Beaugrand made it two in a row; and Team France outshone the field to win the Mixed Team Relay.\n\nPontevedra, Spain, hosted the Grand Final, with Alex Yee leading the rankings and poised to become the first British world champion since Jonny Brownlee back in 2012. However, a terrible swim for the Brit saw him eventually finish in 29th place and fifth in the overall standings.\n\nTaking the spoils was Dorian Coninx, a surprise victory for the Frenchmen who had been in fifth place heading into the Final.\n\nFor the women, Beth Potter started as No.1 and finished No.1, leading from almost start to finish to take her first world title.\n\nWhen and where is WTCS Hamburg taking place?\n\nThe third round of the 2024 WTCS takes place in Hamburg, Germany, over the weekend of 13-14 July.\n\nWhich events are taking place in Hamburg?\n\nHamburg will be hosting elite men’s and women’s sprint-distance WTCS races, plus the Mixed Team Relay Championships on Sunday 14 July.\n\nWhich athletes are racing in Hamburg?\n\nWith Hamburg taking place just over two weeks before the Paris Olympic triathlon events (30 and 31 July for the individual races, 5 August for the mixed relay), athletes racing will be either those who haven’t qualified or will be Games hopefuls using it as a leg-stretcher.\n\nIn the latter camp is reigning world champ Beth Potter, plus medal hopeful Cassandre Beaugrand and her teammate Emma Lombardi. Potter’s Paris teammate Kate Waugh is also on the women’s start list for Hamburg.\n\nThere’s no Wilde or Yee on the men’s start list for Hamburg, nor are there two of the French qualified athletes, Dorian Coninx and Leo Bergere, however Pierre Le Corre’s name is down.\n\nOther notable Paris contenders on the list include Vasco Vilaça, Matt Hauser, Jelle Geens and Morgan Pearson.\n\nThe 2024 WTCS Hamburg course\n\nThe elite races are sprint distance, and start with a one-lap 750m swim that includes a 40m swim through a dark tunnel. The average water temperature in the Alster in mid-July varies between 15°C and 22°C.\n\nThe 20km bike is made up of six x 3.3km laps around the city’s streets. It’s mostly flat without any noteworthy climbs, but it’s technically demanding due to several changes of direction and tight turns.\n\nFrom T2 they start the 5km (2 x 2.5km laps) run course over a completely flat route.\n\nFor course maps of each discipline, head here.\n\nThe 2024 Hamburg Mixed Relay Champs course\n\nThe Mixed Relay Champs will run over the following format:\n\nSwim: 1 x 300m lap\n\nBike: 2 x 3.5km laps = 7km\n\nRun: 2 x 875m = 1.75km\n\nFor full details and course maps for each discipline head here.\n\nHow can I watch the 2024 WTCS Hamburg race?\n\nYou can watch all races live on TriathlonLive.tv, while UK audiences can also stream live coverage via BBC Sport, the BBC Sport app and the BBC Red Button.\n\nWhen do the 2024 WTCS Hamburg events start*?\n\n*All times are local, which is 1hr ahead of the UK.\n\nSaturday 13 July\n\n1:50pm – Elite men’s sprint-distance race (12:50pm British time)\n\n3:55pm – Elite women’s sprint-distance race (2:55pm British time)\n\nSaturday 14 July\n\n3pm – Elite Mixed Relay Champs race (2pm British time)\n\n2024 World Triathlon Championship Series\n\nThe 2024 series will have visited five different locations during the season, culminating at the Grand Final in Torremolinos-Andalucia, Spain, in October.\n\nWTCS 2024 overview\n\n8-9 March: WTCS Abu Dhabi, UAE (sprint and mixed relay) – CANCELLED\n\n11 May: WTCS Yokohama Japan (Olympic)\n\n25-26 May: WTCS Cagliari, Italy (Olympic)\n\n13-14 July: WTCS Hamburg, Germany (sprint and mixed relay)\n\n27 September: WTCS Weihei, China (TBC)\n\n17-20 October: World Triathlon Grand Final Torremolinos-Andalucia, Spain (standard)\n\nParis 2024 Olympic Games\n\n30, 31 July & 5 August: Paris, France (standard & mixed relay)\n\nHow to watch triathlon at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games\n\nParatriathlon\n\n8 March: Para Cup Abu Dhabi, UAE\n\n16-17 March: WTPS Devonport, Australia\n\n13 May: WTPS Yokohama, Japan\n\n18-19 May: Para Cup Samarkand, Uzbekistan\n\n15-16 June: Para Cup Besançon, France\n\n22-23 June: WTPS Swansea, Wales\n\n29-30 June: WTPS Montreal, Canada\n\n20-21 July: Para Cup Long Beach, USA\n\n1-2 September: Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, France\n\n17-20 October: World Triathlon Para Championships Malaga, Spain"
