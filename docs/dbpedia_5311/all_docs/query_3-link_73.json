Weissberger Foundation. Championed for the Festival in 1998 by Fredda’s late husband and former WTF Trustee Jay Harris, the award honors noted theatrical attorney and avid theatre supporter L. Arnold Weissberger, this $10,000 award recognizes excellence in playwriting. Additionally, the award carries a $10,000 commission, named for long-time Festival trustee, the late Jay Harris. The award also provides the playwright with the option for publication of the winning play by Concord Theatricals.\n\nNomination is by invitation only, and the winner is selected by a panel of theatre professionals. Eligible scripts must be full-length, unpublished, unproduced, and not optioned for production during the season in which it is being considered. Musicals, screenplays, or children’s plays are not considered. For more information, contact weissberger@wtfestival.org.\n\nWe recently announced Beth Hyland as the recipient of the 2024 L. Arnold Weissberger New Play Award & Jay Harris Commission for her play SYLVIA SYLVIA SYLVIA. We are grateful to our judges for the 2024 Award: WTF artists Jennifer Chang and Lee Sunday Evans and Williams College faculty Karen Shepard, and look forward to presenting a reading of the play as part of our 2024 season this summer! Other recent recipients of the award include Clarence Coo for his play Chapters of a Floating Life, Mike Lew for his play tiny father (2022), John J. Caswell, Jr. for Wet Brain (2021), and Sanaz Toossi for English (2020).\n\nRead more about the 2024 Weissberger Award here.\n\nTo book your tickets to this summer’s reading of SYLVIA SYLVIA SYLVIA click here.\n\nWILLIAMSTOWN THEATRE FESTIVAL L.
