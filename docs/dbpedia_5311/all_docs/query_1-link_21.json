        "text": "Plan ahead to make the most of one of the busiest nights of the year\n\nThose without a ticket should avoid the event area\n\n(Source: London & Partners)\n\nThe Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has today welcomed the news that the BBC will be giving viewers at home and around the world a 360o panoramic view of the spectacular London New Year’s Eve fireworks display for the first time ever.\n\nAll 110,000 tickets for the event have sold out and thanks to the BBC, viewers will have the chance to see the internationally-renowned display live, in awe-inspiring 360o online.\n\nMillions around the UK tune in to watch the display live on BBC One every year. This year the viewer experience will be enhanced with a full panorama of the hugely popular pyrotechnic and lighting display via the BBC, in the most extensive live 360o coverage the BBC has ever given such an event, offering people at home the opportunity to feel like they are at the display.\n\nBBC Taster, the BBC’s home for innovation and new ideas along with its world-class events team, will let viewers get closer to the action, by taking control of the camera angle of the event by tilting and panning on their tablet or mobile device, or using arrow keys on a laptop or PC, giving a full vista of the fireworks and surrounding sites.\n\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “London is the best place in the world to see in the New Year and every year thousands of people watch the spectacular fireworks display on the banks of the Thames. I know this year’s show will be the most exciting yet, bringing a fantastic end to the year, and showing the world that London is open. I want everyone to be able to have a great view of the London fireworks and I’m delighted to team up with the BBC to bring this exciting new element to the event for the first time ever.”\n\nMatthew Postgate, BBC Chief Technology and Product Officer, said: “The BBC brings the nation together – and New Year’s Eve is one of the most special times of the year for many in the UK and across the world. This year we’ve been bringing audiences new innovations for the Olympics to Euro 2016. We’re thrilled to end the year with a special 360o experience of London’s spectacular fireworks online – as well as full coverage on BBC One. So from Belfast to Birmingham, from Swansea to Stirling – viewers can experience the magic of London’s fireworks closer than ever before.”\n\nNew Year's Eve is one of the busiest nights of the year, particularly in central London, but revellers, wherever they are, are advised to plan ahead to get the most out of the huge range of other celebratory activities taking place in bars, restaurants, pubs and clubs across the capital. Many venues will be ticketed and need to be booked in advance. To find out more about what is going on visit www.visitlondon.com/newyearseve.\n\nPublic transport will be the best way to get about on New Year's Eve. Revellers are advised to plan ahead and check www.tfl.gov.uk/nye for travel information.\n\nFor updates about the London New Year's Eve Fireworks go to www.london.gov.uk/nye.\n\nFor live updates on the night follow #LondonNYE."
