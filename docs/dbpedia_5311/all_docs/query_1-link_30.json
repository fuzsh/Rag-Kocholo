        "text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) - Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye is very excited about the 408-foot-tall (that's over 40 stories) broadcast tower planned for the 104th floor of the new One World Trade Center.\n\nWCBS 880's Rich Lamb On The Story\n\n\"The antenna on One World Trade Center is going to be both aesthetic and utilitarian. It is going to be part of the iconic nature of One World Trade Center, but frankly it's also going to be a revenue producer for us,\" he said Thursday. \"Based on our conversations, we expect significant interest and we expect to make money.\"\n\nFoye was asked if they'd be charging less than the Empire State Building.\n\n\"Look, we think One World Trade Center is not only going to be the highest building in New York City. It is going to be the state of the art, class A, modern office building in New York City, For that, frankly, we should get a premium,\" he told WCBS 880 reporter Rich Lamb.\n\nThey are anticipating $10 million a year in rent.\n\nHe says it will be win for the public.\n\n\"The higher you are, the better reception. We're going to have the highest building in New York City, the highest building on the East Coast, and we think that'll be a real attraction to both TV broadcasters and radio broadcasters,\" said Foye.\n\nPrior to the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the old One World Trade Center at the Twin Towers was the source of much of the New York City area's major network television broadcasts, and the signal was brilliant. When the towers came down and broadcasting was relocated to other locations, including the Empire State Building and along the Palisades in New Jersey, the signal quality dropped dramatically."
