We are currently recruiting patients aged 45-65 for the following PET/MRI projects with recruitment for the Beta-Amyloid & TAU study set to start by the end of 2021:\n\nBeta-Amyloid study\n\nTAU study\n\nBeta-Amyloid & TAU study\n\nIf you would like more information regarding this study, please contact Project Coordinator Alissa Barber Alissa.Barber@stonybrookmedicine.edu, 631-216-8842\n\nFDNY Study\n\nStony Brook University Human Subjects Committee (IRB) Approved: 9/20/2022\n\nThe Stony Brook World Trade Center Health and Wellness Program is partnering with the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) to understand the similarities and differences between various 9/11 responders. Specifically, we want to find out if changes in the brain are occurring in FDNY responders. Responders participating in this study may also be contacted to participate in one of our imaging studies. We are now actively recruiting for this study.\n\nIf you would like more information regarding this study, please contact Project\n\nCoordinator Alicia Fels at alicia.fels@stonybrookmedicine.edu or (631) 268-0581.\n\nA Glance of Our Publications:\n\nReduced cerebellar cortical thickness in WTC responders with cognitive impairment, 2022\n\nCorticol Complexity in WTC Responders with Chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, 2021\n\nWTC responders in their own words-predicting PTSD symptom trajectories with AI-based language analyses of interviews, 2021\n\nCOVID-19 cumulative incidence, asymptomatic infections, and fatality in LI, NY Jan-Aug 2020- A Cohort of WTC Responders, 2021\n\nRisk factors for incident prostate cancer in a cohort of WTC responders, 2019\n\nRole of modifiable health-related behaviors in the association between PTSD and Respiratory Illness, 2019\n\nHurricane Sandy Exposure and the Mental Health of WTC Responders, 2017\n\nCohort Profile: WTCHP General Responder Cohort, 2015\n\nWTC disaster and sensitization to subsequent life stress_a longitudinal study of disaster responders, 2015\n\nExposure, probable PTSD and lower respiratory illness among WTC rescue, recovery, and cleanup workers,, 2012\n\nPersistence of multiple illnesses in WTC rescue recovery efforts, 2011"
