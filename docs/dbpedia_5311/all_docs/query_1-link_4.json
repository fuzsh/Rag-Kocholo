        "text": "While watching Neal Brennan’s new Netflix special, Crazy Good, Marc learned new things about Neal despite knowing each other for 30 years. They sit down to figure out how things have changed for them, whether they are truly feeling better in their lives, and why they are still pursuing some version of success they can’t quite pinpoint. Neal also shares some insight he received directly from Bono that might answer some of their questions.\n\nNearly seven years after doing an episode of WTF that never aired, Neal Brennan sits down with Marc for a conversation that is probably the one they should have had all those years ago. Neal and Marc talk about how the two of them have changed since then, especially in light of Neal’s recent comedy special 3 Mics, which mixed heavy personal stories with jokes. Now that they feel better about themselves and each other, Marc and Neal try to figure out what they really want next and whether they should be doing more with their lives. This episode is sponsored by Spotify, Squarespace, and Casper.\n\nNeal Brennan and Marc stage the comic equivalent of the Camp David Peace Accords. Josie Long explains why social justice and stand-up comedy don’t mix well, especially at ski resorts. John Ennis reunites with David Cross and Bob Odenkirk for a mini-Mr. Show reunion. It’s live WTF from the Vancouver Comedy Festival. This episode is sponsored by Stamps.com. Enter WTF to start a no-risk trial with a $110 bonus offer."
