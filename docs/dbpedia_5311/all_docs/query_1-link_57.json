        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber were on Jimmy Kimmel Live yesterday to promote the return of Punk’d and I never realized until then that they could totally be brothers. In fact the two of them even acted like they were brothers while they talked to Kimmel. At one point they were talking about the pranking show and the ABC late night host asked the Baby, Baby if he was even alive when the show aired and he said he was 3 or 4 when it came out. That totally hurt the newest member of Two and a Half Men’s feelings and made him feel old. What will make him feel really old is to know he is only a few years younger than Bieber’s mom.\n\nAnd talking about half men, the Beebs told Kimmel now that he is 18 he no longer has to tell his mom where he is. Yeah like his mom is going to take that lying down. He better listen to his mom while he can because when he is 21, Ashton said he would take the singer under his wing. When he does that, all hell will break loose in the sweet Canadians innocent life."
