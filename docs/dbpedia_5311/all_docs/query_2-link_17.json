        "text": "Highlights\n\nAccording to scientific studies, nearly all WTC responders face a persistent drop in lung function caused by the air on 9/11.\n\nThere are 69 specific cancers and a host of respiratory and other illnesses and injuries that qualify responders for the Victim Compensation Fund.\n\nResponders have been awarded over $4.2 billion in compensation from the VCF so far.\n\nBarasch & McGarry has helped more 9/11 Responders receive compensation from the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund than any other law firm.\n\nFirst Responders & Rescue and Recovery Workers at Greatest Risk\n\nAs the events of September 11th, 2001 unfolded, first responders- firefighters, police, EMS personnel, and rescue and recovery workers, poured into Lower Manhattan to bravely save lives and help people trapped in the WTC disaster zone. As they worked, dust and acrid smoke containing jet fuel and pulverized glass, concrete, and fibers hung in the air creating an at times invisible fog of carcinogens. In the months that followed 9/11, responders and clean up workers in the NYC area continued to help while breathing in this toxic dust, unknowingly being exposed to many debilitating health effects that are now presenting themselves years later.\n\nLikelihood of Respiratory Disease for WTC Responders\n\nScientific studies now show that nearly all of the workers exposed to the thick clouds of dust after the World Trade Center buildings collapsed have suffered a persistent drop in lung function. For many workers, the decline in lung function has limited their ability to work, exercise, and perform their usual daily activities.\n\nIn ordinary cases of smoke and particulate inhalation, lung function declines, but then slowly rebounds over a period of months and years as the lungs heal and recover. In the case of the World Trade Center dust cloud, emergency, rescue and recovery workers suffered a decline in lung function that has persisted for much longer. Now, doctors at the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) have linked over 13 aerodigestive disorders to the 9/11 toxic dust including: asthma, chronic cough, rhinosinusitis, GERD, and COPD among others.\n\nI want to personally thank the firm for their hard work at both the forefront, and in the offices of the VCF in Washington. Without the firm’s non-stop commitment to the VCF, I wonder where many of us first responders would be today.\n\nE.S.\n\n9/11 Responder\n\n9/11 Responders At Risk For 69 Cancers\n\nThe mix of toxins present in the smoke and dust at the World Trade Center has long been cause for concern among epidemiologists tracking post-WTC health effects. Because cancer takes longer to develop than many other WTC-related illnesses, studies were slow to link certain types of cancer conclusively with exposure to dust and smoke at Ground Zero. But eventually, studies of firefighters exposed to toxic dust and smoke at the WTC site indicated about a 20 percent higher rate of cancer than firefighters without such exposure.\n\nThe FealGood Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group whose mission is to aid all emergency personnel who may have suffered any form of injury as a result of the attacks, had long advocated for the inclusion of cancer among those injuries and illnesses eligible for government 9/11 compensation and medical care. The Foundation keeps an unfortunately growing list of WTC responders who have contracted cancer since the attacks.\n\nAfter significant pressure from advocacy groups and the media, including our firm, the federal government included various types of cancer on the list of illnesses qualifying for Zadroga Act medical care and Victim Compensation Fund benefits. The list now contains 69 different cancers including: lung, skin, breast, blood, colon, and prostate cancer.\n\nActual Client VCF Awards\n\nView More Results\n\n$3,700,651for a disabled NYC police officer due to leukemia\n\n$3,254,242for wrongful death of a firefighter due to 9/11-related asthma/RADS\n\n$2,811,150for a disabled stock broker due to multiple myeloma\n\n$1,934,316for a disabled teacher due to esophageal cancer\n\n$1,422,694for wrongful death of a downtown office worker due to pulmonary fibrosis\n\n$1,251,411for wrongful death of a paralegal working in a downtown law firm due to breast cancer\n\n$1,345,427for a NYC Police Officer with breast cancer\n\n$1,188,741for a disabled EMT with colon cancer\n\n$1,011,957for the wrongful death of a sound engineer due to bladder cancer\n\nFighting For 9/11 Rescue, Recovery, and Clean-up Workers\n\nAs a 9/11 first responder, you answered the call to help our country and our city at its darkest hour.

If you worked on the WTC site or with WTC debris, we want to help you take advantage of every health benefit available to you and we will help you and your family obtain as much compensation as possible from the Victim Compensation Fund.\n\nContact Us\n\nIt’s important to act quickly.
