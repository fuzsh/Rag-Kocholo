        "text": "The information on this page is applicable to the 2012 round of the New gTLD Program only. Please go to newgtldprogram.icann.org for information on the New gTLD Program: Next Round.\n\nOverview\n\nThe expansion of generic Top-Level Domains (e.g. .COM, .ORG, .NET) in the Domain Name System is underway. Over 1,300 new names or \"strings\" could become available in the next few years.\n\nAfter completing the New gTLD Program, a new gTLD becomes part of the Internet when it is delegated. This means it is introduced into the Internet's authoritative database, known as the Root Zone.\n\nDelegation is occurring on a rolling basis, and as information becomes available, we are publishing here. Please note, however, that this page is not being updated in real-time. To view the IANA Root Zone Database, click here.\n\nGet information about New gTLD applications Â»\n\nDelegated Strings"
