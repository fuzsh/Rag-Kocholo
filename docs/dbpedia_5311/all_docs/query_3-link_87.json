        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - September 10, 2012\n\nDemocratic New York Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (KEHR'-sten JIHL'-uh-brand) and Charles Schumer and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health announced the change Monday. The institute said last June it favored expanding the $4.3 billion health program to include cancer.\n\nScientists say there's little research to prove exposure to toxic dust from the destroyed twin towers caused even one kind of cancer. Questions about whether dust caused cancer were a reason Congress didn't include it in the initial list of covered illnesses.\n\nBut an advisory panel said it was plausible first responders and others who were exposed to the toxic dust might get cancer.\n\nThe full list of cancers included:\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the lip, tongue, salivary gland, floor of mouth, gum and other mouth, tonsil, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and other oral cavity and pharynx\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the nasopharynx\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the nose, nasal cavity, middle ear, and accessory sinuses\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the larynx\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the esophagus\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the stomach\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the colon and rectum\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the liver and intrahepatic bile duct\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the retroperitoneum and peritoneum, omentum, and mesentery 6\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the trachea; bronchus and lung; heart, mediastinum and pleura; and other ill-defined sites in the respiratory system and intrathoracic organs\n\nMesothelioma\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the soft tissues (sarcomas)\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the skin (melanoma and nonmelanoma), including scrotal cancer\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the breast\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the ovary\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the urinary bladder\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the kidney\n\nMalignant neoplasms of renal pelvis, ureter and other urinary organs\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the eye and orbit\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the thyroid\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the blood and lymphoid tissues (including, but not limited to, lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma)\n\nChildhood cancers\n\nRare cancers"
