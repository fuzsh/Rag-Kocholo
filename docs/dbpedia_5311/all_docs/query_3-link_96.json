        "text": "Williamsburg Technical College opened its doors to students in late 1969, representing a new concept in comprehensive education coupled with various supportive services. For the first time in South Carolina, and most particularly in Williamsburg County, all the following capabilities and services were available in one concentrated area: technical education, adult education, vocational education for high school students, continuing education for personal enrichment, and the offices of the state Job Service and Vocational Rehabilitation.\n\nOn January 31, 1975, by Act of the S.C. Legislature, the institution changed its name from the “Williamsburg Regional Manpower Training Center” to the “Williamsburg Technical, Vocational and Adult Education Center,” a title which at that time more accurately reflected its purpose.\n\nThe College became accredited in December 1977 by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Following accreditation, and with approval of the S.C. State Board for Technical and Comprehensive Education, in February 1979 the institution officially became known as Williamsburg Technical College. The College’s accreditation was reaffirmed in December 1982, 1992, 2002, and 2012.\n\nRecent changes include the reactivation of certificate programs in Industrial Electricity, Criminal Justice, and Nail Technology in 2013; SACSCOC approval of the Hemingway Career and Technology Center as an off-campus site in 2013; and SACSCOC approval of the Criminal Justice Certificate program in 2015. The College continues to expand its course technology base and now offers both hybrid and online courses. Williamsburg Technical College currently offers five Associate Degree programs, three Diploma programs, and 21 Certificate programs. Popular majors include Practical Nursing, Criminal Justice, Cosmetology, Early Childhood Development, and Welding.\n\nIn addition, to address service area economic and employment needs, the College continues to focus on workforce development. Current program offerings include the South Carolina Manufacturing Certification (SCMC).\n\nWilliamsburg Technical College continues to revise and update existing curricula to ensure that course and program offerings remain abreast of current teaching techniques and industrial trends. Williamsburg Technical College is committed to helping students discover their abilities and interests while developing them to the fullest extent, consistent with their own goals and capabilities and the needs of society."
