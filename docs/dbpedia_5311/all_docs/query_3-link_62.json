        "text": "NEW YORK - One World Trade Center, the monolith being built to replace the twin towers destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks, claimed the title of New York City's tallest skyscraper on Monday, as workers erected steel columns that made its unfinished skeleton a little over 1,250 feet high, just enough to peek over the roof of the observation deck on the Empire State Building.\n\nCity officials and iron workers applauded as the first 12-ton column was hoisted onto the tower's top deck.\n\n\"This project is much more than steel and concrete. It is a symbol of success for the nation,\" said David Samson, chairman of the Port Authority, the agency that owns the World Trade Center.\n\nClear skies afforded an immaculate 360-degree view from the top, although it wasn't easy getting up there. After riding an elevator to the 90th floor, a small group of officials and journalists had to climb three steep ladders to reach the top platform, which was encircled by blue netting along the perimeter.\n\nThe milestone is a preliminary one. Workers are still adding floors to the building once called the Freedom Tower. It isn't expected to reach its full height for at least another year, at which point it is likely to be declared the tallest building in the U.S., and third tallest in the world.\n\nThose bragging rights, though, will carry an asterisk.\n\nCrowning the world's tallest buildings is a little like picking the heavyweight champion in boxing. There is often disagreement about who deserves the belt.\n\nIn this case, the issue involves the 408-foot-tall needle that will sit on the tower's roof.\n\nCount it, and the World Trade Center is back on top. Otherwise, it will have to settle for No. 2, after the Willis Tower in Chicago.\n\n\"Height is complicated,\" said Nathaniel Hollister, a spokesman for The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats, a Chicago-based organization considered an authority on such records.\n\nExperts and architects have long disagreed about where to stop measuring super-tall buildings outfitted with masts, spires and antennas that extend far above the roof.\n\nConsider the case of the Empire State Building: Measured from the sidewalk to the tip of its needle-like antenna, the granddaddy of all skyscrapers actually stands 1,454 feet high, well above the mark reached by One World Trade Center on Monday.\n\nPurists, though, say antennas shouldn't count when determining building height.\n\nAn antenna, they say, is more like furniture than a piece of architecture. Like a chair sitting on a rooftop, an antenna can be attached or removed. The Empire State Building didn't even get its distinctive antenna until 1952. The record books, as the argument goes, shouldn't change every time someone installs a new satellite dish.\n\nExcluding the antenna brings the Empire State Building's total height to 1,250 feet. That was still high enough to make the skyscraper the world's tallest from 1931 until 1972.\n\nFrom that height, the Empire State seems to tower over the second tallest completed building in New York, the Bank of America Tower.\n\nYet, in many record books, the two skyscrapers are separated by just 50 feet.\n\nThat's because the tall, thin mast on top of the Bank of America building isn't an antenna but a decorative spire.\n\nUnlike antennas, record-keepers like spires. It's a tradition that harkens back to a time when the tallest buildings in many European cities were cathedrals. Groups like the Council on Tall Buildings, and Emporis, a building data provider in Germany, both count spires when measuring the total height of a building, even if that spire happens to look exactly like an antenna.\n\nThis quirk in the record books has benefited buildings like Chicago's recently opened Trump International Hotel and Tower. It is routinely listed as being between 119 to 139 feet taller than the Empire State Building, thanks to the antenna-like mast that sits on its roof, even though the average person, looking at the two buildings side by side, would probably judge the New York skyscraper to be taller.\n\nThe same factors apply to measuring the height of One World Trade Center.\n\nDesigns call for the tower's roof to stand at 1,368 feet -- the same height as the north tower of the original World Trade Center. The building's roof will be topped with a 408-foot, cable-stayed mast, making the total height of the structure a symbolic 1,776 feet.\n\nSo is that needle an antenna or a spire?\n\n\"Not sure,\" wrote Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the building.\n\nThe needle will, indeed, function as a broadcast antenna. It is described on the Port Authority's website as an antenna. On the other hand, the structure will have more meat to it than your average antenna, with external cladding encasing the broadcast mast.\n\nWithout that spire, One World Trade Center would still be smaller than the Willis Tower in Chicago, formerly known as the Sears Tower, which tops out at 1,451 feet (not including its own antennas).\n\nDebate over which of those buildings can truly claim to be the tallest in the U.S. has been raging for years on Internet message boards frequented by skyscraper enthusiasts.\n\nAs for the Council on Tall Buildings, it is leaning toward giving One World Trade the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\"This is something we have discussed with the architect,\" Hollister said. \"As we understand it, the needle is an architectural spire which happens to enclose an antenna. We would thus count it as part of the architectural height.\"\n\nBut, he noted, the organization has also chosen to sidestep these types of disputes, somewhat, by recognizing three types of height records: tallest occupied floor, architectural top and height to the tip.\n\nHollister also pointed out that, technically speaking, One World Trade Center isn't a record-holder in any category yet, as it is still unfinished.\n\n\"A project is not considered a building until it is topped out, fully clad, and open for business or at least occupiable,\" he said.\n\nThe debate doesn't quite end there.\n\nNeither the Willis Tower nor One World Trade are as high as the CN Tower, in Toronto, which stands at 1,815 feet. That structure, however, isn't considered a building at all by most record-keepers, because it is predominantly a television broadcast antenna and observation platform with very little interior space. The tallest manmade structure in the Western Hemisphere will continue to be the 2,063-foot-tall KVLY-TV antenna in Blanchard, N.D.\n\nAs for the world's tallest building, the undisputed champion is the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, which opened in 2010 and reaches 2,717 feet.\n\nNot counting about 5 feet of aircraft lights and other equipment perched on top, of course."
