        "text": "Earlier this year, The Retrologist shared with you a discovery that was made amid the ruins at Ground Zero: An intact copy of the June 23, 1969 edition of The New York Times, which reported on the death of Judy Garland on the front page.\n\nI learned of this discovery, among many other fascinating ones that few people know about, during a tour back in 2006 of Hangar 17 at Kennedy Airport, where the Port Authority was storing much of what remained of the World Trade Center. I photographed many of these items with my trusty Treo 650, and have sifted through my shoot to share with you these selections. Some of these items are iconic symbols of the day, but others, like an old can of beer and a Bugs Bunny statue, draw their power from how unremarkable they once were. Now, they’re all museum pieces that survived New York’s darkest day:\n\nCan of Rheingold beer\n\nA vintage, crushed can of Rheingold Beer “Extra Dry” was found amid the debris at Ground Zero, the relic perhaps of a construction worker’s long-ago lunch break. Rheingold is an iconic New York brand of beer, famed for its commercials that celebrated New York landmarks, and now enjoying something of a hipster renaissance.\n\n***\n\nThe can of Pepsi Cola\n\nA vintage can of Pepsi Cola was found embedded in concrete, but in otherwise good shape.\n\n***\n\nThe 1973 plaque honoring WTC workers\n\nThis plaque commemorates the April 1973 dedication of the World Trade Center, and managed to survive the complex’s destruction 28 years later.\n\n***\n\nThe plaza sign for 5 WTC\n\nHere’s an intact plaza sign for 5 World Trade Center, one of the three considerably smaller dark-glass buildings that ringed the World Trade Center plaza. 5 WTC was on the northeast corner of the site, and many remember it as the home of the Borders bookstore. Much of the building survived the destruction, but it was eventually razed. Click HERE to see what it looked like before 9/11.\n\n***\n\nSubway sign/WTC mall\n\nA perfectly intact subway sign, featuring the Twin Towers logo, directs commuters toward the Nos. 1 and now defunct 9 line. The No. 9 line was shuttered for a year because of damage to the Cortlandt Station, the one mentioned here. The line eventually went out of service in 2005. I wrote about it in this Retrologist post.\n\n***\n\n1 WTC’s antenna\n\nHere’s a massive chunk of the antenna that sat atop Tower One, or the original One World Trade Center. The television and radio memories of New Yorkers for a generation were made possible in part by the sounds and images transmitted by this antenna.\n\n***\n\nAustin J. Tobin plaza marker\n\nThis commemorative slab tells us that the “Great Plaza of the World Trade Center shall hereafter be officially” named after Austin J. Tobin, the president of the Port Authority on whose watch the World Trade Center was constructed. Tobin died in 1978.\n\n***\n\nSign for The Mall at the World Trade Center\n\nA shopping concourse sign for The Mall at the World Trade Center. Look at the Twin Towers logo on the shopping bag. Truly amazing!\n\n***\n\n“Death of a Salesman” concourse advertisement\n\nA shopping concourse ad for “Death of Salesman,” which was back on Broadway in the days before 9/11. Haunting. Below, a portion of the ad reads “Never Settle.”\n\n***\n\nMall/subway signs for N/R trains\n\nAnother subway sign, this one directing commuters to the N and R trains. And there’s the cool logo again for the World Trade Center mall.\n\n***\n\nPATH turnstiles\n\nTurnstiles, complete with tickets, for the PATH train station at the World Trade Center.\n\n***\n\nVerizon (Bell Atlantic) utility cart\n\nA telephone utility cart, still bearing the blue and green stripes of Verizon’s predecessor in New York, Bell Atlantic.\n\n****\n\nStandpipe and sprinkler cases\n\nStunning and haunting: Casings for sprinklers and standpipes at the World Trade Center, firefighting tools that were powerless against the horror dozens of stories above ground.\n\n***\n\nThe June 23, 1969 edition of The New York Times\n\nThe July 23, 1969 edition of the New York Times, tucked inside of the buildings and forgotten until it was discovered during the recovery at Ground Zero. Click HERE for my earlier post on this find.\n\n***\n\nThe aluminum cladding of the Twin Towers\n\nThe World Trade Center shimmered in the skyline for three decades. This aluminum column cladding is among the few hundred feet that survive of the architectural element — 2 million square feet sheathed the towers — that helped make the twins such an icon.\n\n***\n\nThe tridents of the tower bases\n\nOne of the few remaining Gothic columns — or tridents — that for decades brought whimsy to the tower bases, and later served as symbols of destruction. They were a hallmark of the quirky modernist style of architect Minoru Yamasaki.\n\n***\n\nVehicles that testify to the day’s destruction\n\nA smashed yellow taxi, a medical examiner’s truck and mangled fire trucks speak to the devastation.\n\n***\n\nThe international flags that once graced the World Trade Center lobbies\n\nFlags from the trade center lobbies, each neatly rolled in a tube, were found intact inside a box. Symbols of international cooperation that the trade center represented, they had hung in the lobbies until July 2001, familiar to tourists and office workers alike. In a twist that would save them, new leaseholder Larry Silverstein ordered them taken down as part of initial modifications to the complex. They were stored well underground — clearly in one of the safest places at the trade center on 9/11.\n\n***\n\nAlexander Calder’s World Trade Center Stabile (Bent Propeller)\n\nSculptor Alexander Calder’s World Trade Center Stabile survived, but in pieces, recognized because of its chipped red paint, but not before some workers took a saw to parts of it, thinking it was mere twisted metal. Click HERE to see how the sculpture looked before 9/11.\n\n***\n\nThe lottery machine\n\nA lottery machine from a store in the trade center’s shopping concourse. To the right is an intact display of reading glasses.\n\n***\n\nThe tourist magnets\n\nWhat’s with Judy Garland and the World Trade Center? Maybe the WTC’s connection as the Emerald City in the 1978 movie “The Wiz”? Anway, these magnets from a WTC store feature scenes from “The Wizard of Oz,” and include Dorothy’s ruby slippers. There’s also a nice magnet showing the pre-9/11 skyline. It mentions the Brooklyn Bridge, not the gleaming trade towers in the background.\n\n***\n\nClothing from WTC shop\n\nClothing displays survive intact from a World Trade Center shop.\n\nBikes complete with rack seemingly await the return of their owners, who chained them here presumably on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nBugs Bunny and Foghorn Leghorn still covered with dust but surprisingly little worse for the wear. Port Authority officials invited Warner Brothers workers to examine the relics. They were inspected and notes were taken. But ultimately, the studio decided that they should stay in New York, where it seemed they belonged.\n\nFrom the World Trade Center Warners Brothers’ store. What else is there to say?\n\nText and photos: Rolando Pujol\n\nMORE: Click HERE to read my complete article on these artifacts."
