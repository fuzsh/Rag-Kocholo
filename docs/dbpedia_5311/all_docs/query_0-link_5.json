Together, they get their Hurt on.\n\niTunes users - You can subscribe to and review the podcast here:\n\niTunes Store\n\nZune users - You can subscribe here:\n\nzune://subscribe/?WTF@TFW=http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/external.php?type=rss2&forumids=404\n\nThe RSS feed which includes a media link for the m4a file is:\n\nWTF @ TFW Transformers Podcast - TFW2005.com\n\nAnd if you want an MP3 version, it's linked below:\n\nhttp://www.tfw2005.net/podcast/WTF_Primetime_-_36_-_Hurt_-_August_30_2012.mp3\n\nNever thought I'd see Omegus on a PrimeTime again\n\nEDIT: And after listening to this, I feel the need to say here that I'm most certainly wrong about the new Autobot, even if it does leave some things to be explained\n\nDid Gog say he was gonna say something about the fandom in this episode? Can't wait to listen to that.\n\nEDIT: Never mind he's not in this ep\n\nSeriously. You guys noticed \"The one they call\" before Megatron's favorite: \"*Insert name*, you would be wise to remember, ...!\"\n\nAlso, Hey Vangelus, you skipped my listener question!\n\nI'd just like to note that the OPENING LINE of \"Out of the Past\" is Starscream sneering \"They said... the one called Arcee is too quick!\"\n\nAnd I had to pause Darkprime's encode while I was laughing my head off.\n\nI have to say it was nice to hear a female on the show, You guys should do that more.\n\nYou know, up until this episode of Primetime, I'd forgotten how much I hated the name Hardshell, but now its gonna take me like another month to get over it again haha.\n\nAlso, I too liked hearing Crin.\n\nWhile I approve of the episode in general, I'm so over Miko's character from the first season and a half, that I just didn't care.\n\nDoes that make me a bad person? : /"
