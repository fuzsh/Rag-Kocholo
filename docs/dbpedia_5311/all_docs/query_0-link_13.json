        "text": "March 17, 1960 – NAGC passes resolution regarding AAU leadership\n\nDiscussion about the challenges with the Amateur Athletic Association and the Olympic Gymnastics Committee is included on the agenda of the National Association of Gymnastics Coaches (eventually known as the National Association of College Gymnastics Coaches). The coaches in attendance pass a resolution expressing dissatisfaction with the gymnastics leadership of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and recommending the resignation or removal of George Gulack. NAGC President Harold Frey sends a letter with this resolution to the AAU, but nothing changes. The meeting was held at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nDecember 15, 1960 – NAGC reaches out to NCAA\n\nNational Association of Gymnastics Coaches President Harold Frey sends a letter to Wilbur Johns, who is chairman of a National Collegiate Athletic Association sub-committee designated to work with the Amateur Athletic Union regarding new federations for track and field and basketball. Johns responds with suggestions for gymnastics to follow a similar path.\n\nApril 6, 1961 – NAGC passes another resolution\n\nAt its Spring meeting, the members of the National Association of Gymnastics Coaches (NAGC) pass another resolution, this time addressing the gymnastics leadership of both the Amateur Athletic Union and the U.S. Olympic Committee and asking for the removal of George Gulack as chairperson of the Gymnastics Committee. The vote is 38-2. Eugene Wettstone is elected president and sends letters to both organizations. The response is to support the current leadership.\n\nOctober 1, 1961 – NCAA hosts meeting with AAU and collegiate coaches\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association hosts a meeting in Chicago with representatives from the Amateur Athletic Union, basketball, gymnastics, and others to discuss a compromise in administering amateur sports. The NCAA listened to the perspective of the gymnastics coaches, who held parallel meetings to discuss the situation and explore the possibility of forming a new gymnastics organization. Gene Wettstone, president of the National Association of Gymnastics Coaches, and Harold Frey are the official reps for the joint meeting, and Glenn Wilson, Dick Holzaepfel, Bob Kreidler, Newt Loken, Bill Meade, George Szypula, Bill Roetzheim, Jan Roberts and Paul Fina are also on hand. Basketball had started a similar effort and was willing to assist gymnastics. Wettstone asks Frey to chair a committee to work on a resolution to form a new federation.\n\nDecember 1, 1961 – NCAA coaches meet with AAU to select Olympic Committee for Gymnastics chair\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association selected six coaches (Jake Geier, Chet Phillips, Charles Pond, Lyle Welser, Gene Wettstone, and Harold Frey) to serve on the Olympic Committee for Gymnastics. The six meet with the six members from the Amateur Athletic Union and the Armed Forces representative to select the committee’s chairman for the next four years. Despite the college coaches’ request for a change in leadership, the AAU and Armed Forces voted as a block and selected the incumbent, George Gulack. The NCAA coaches asked for a recess and met with NCAA Executive Director Walter Byers. After explaining existing problems, Byers supported their decision to boycott the remainder of the U.S. Olympic Committee for Gymnastics meetings. The coaches did not attend any future committee meetings.\n\nJanuary 11, 1962 – NCAA Committee calls for independent federation\n\nAt the NCAA Committee on Olympic-AAU Relations, UCLA Athletic Director Wilbur Johns called for independent federations for gymnastics, baseball, and track and field. Two months later, at the AAU Convention in Chicago, a gymnastics federation was proposed as part of the larger federation movement, but no action was taken.\n\nJanuary 18, 1962 – NCAA general council votes to support separation from AAU\n\nNational Association of Gymnastics Coaches President Gene Wettstone was invited to speak to the delegates at the NCAA’s general council annual meeting. Following his presentation regarding the challenges in dealing with the AAU and USOC, the general assembly voted to support gymnastics, track and field, and basketball in its efforts to separate from the AAU and form a new organization.\n\nMarch 4, 1962 – NCAA meets with AAU/USOC leaders\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association calls a meeting with all collegiate gymnastics coaches in Chicago to discuss forming a new organization should the NCAA/U.S. Olympic Committee/Amateur Athletic Union meetings about amateur sports not succeed. Representatives from the NCAA, the AAU, and the USOC have met several times previously to discuss administering amateur athletics. At the March meeting, it becomes apparent that the AAU-USOC leaders are unwilling to compromise. The NCAA asks the National Association of Gymnastics Coaches to move ahead in forming a new federation, and work on a constitution begins.\n\nSeptember 29, 1962 – Dissatisfaction with the AAU results in a meeting\n\nDue to inaction by the AAU, a U.S. Gymnastics Federation (USGF) Development Meeting was held in Chicago. Forty representatives from all aspects of gymnastics attend the meeting. Eugene Wettstone, the National Association of Gymnastics Coaches president, ran the two-day meeting.

J. Roberts (S.C. Gymnastics Association), Glenn Sundby (“Modern Gymnast”) and Katherine Ley (American Alliance for Health, Physical Education and Recreation).\n\nDecember 8, 1962 – Meeting establishes USGF, elects Boydston as president\n\nOn December 8-9, the group that met in March at the first U.S. Gymnastics Federation (USGF) Development Meeting reconvenes. The United States Gymnastics Federation (USGF) was established, and the USGF Constitution was adopted. The officers elected are Donald L. Boydston, athletic director for Southern Illinois University, president; Glenn Sundby, editor of “Modern Gymnast,” vice president (m); Clayton “Bud” Marquette, director of gymnastics at Lakewood Recreation Department, vice president (w); and Dick Clausen, athletic director of the University of Arizona, secretary-treasurer.

The NCAA provides funding to help get the organization started (which lasts for 10-12 years). Also, Gene Wettstone, the chairman of the USGF’s Committee on Committees, begins forming committees to work on the more technical aspects of the federation and procedures.\n\nFebruary 1, 1963 – USGF publishes first newsletter\n\nThe first USGF Newsletter was published in February. Sent via the mail, it contained current information on the business of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation, along with other information of interest to the gymnastics community. “Modern Gymnast,” the magazine published by Glenn Sundby, also helped provide USGF information in the organization’s early years.\n\nJune 14, 1963 – USGF holds first nationals\n\nThe U.S. Gymnastics Federation runs its own national championships in addition to those held by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). The event was held in Park Ridge, Ill., at Maine East High School, and Donna Schaenzer and Arthur Shurlock became the first USGF all-around champions. Nearly 100 gymnasts participated in the two-day event, which was the first national meet in the U.S. that specified compulsory routines for each division and included trampoline and tumbling.\n\nOctober 1, 1963 – Millman wins gold in Germany\n\nDan Millman won the U.S. Gymnastics Federation’s first international gold medal at the Fahrbach-Schuster Cup in Salzgitter, Germany.\n\nMarch 21, 1964 – First World Trampoline and Tumbling Championships is held\n\nThe first World Trampoline and Tumbling Championships are staged in London, England.

Beverly Averyt and Nancy Smith are the silver and bronze medalists for the women.\n\nJune 1, 1965 – USGF loses bid for membership in FIT\n\nThe U.S. Gymnastics Federation makes an effort to gain recognition from the International Trampoline Federation. Frank Bare travels to the FIT Congress in Basel, Switzerland, where he and Jeff Hennessy of the Amateur Athletic Union meet with FIT leaders. The FIT opts to go with the AAU. After this, the USGF begins disbanding its trampoline program.\n\nNovember 1, 1965 – First Coaches Congress is staged\n\nThe First Congress of American Gymnastics Coaches is held in Denver, with approximately 50 people in attendance. During the Congress, the group establishes a national competition program, clinics, and an age-group training program. The decision is made to make it an annual event. The event’s name was changed to the USGF Coaches Congress, then the USGF Congress, and eventually the USA Gymnastics National Congress and Trade Show.\n\nJanuary 1, 1966 – USGF meets with FIG in Poland\n\nGene Wettstone and Ernie McCoy of Pennsylvania State University travel to Warsaw, Poland, for informal meetings with International Gymnastics Federation President Arthur Gander.\n\n1966 (exact date unknown) – USGF offices move\n\nThe U.S. Gymnastics Federation offices moved from Frank Bare’s home into space made available at the Flamingo Hotel in Tucson, which allowed for administrative space.\n\nJanuary 1, 1967 – Bare forms “National Committee on International Franchise”\n\nFrank Bare creates a “National Committee on International Franchise” to study the control of athletics in the USA, focusing on the structure of government relations and amateur sports bodies. The committee sent a report to Arthur Gander, president of the International Gymnastics Federation, on Feb. 21, 1968, that clarifies the sports structure in the USA, outlines the differences between the Amateur Athletic Union and U.S. Gymnastics Federation; and explains that there is no national governing sports body in the U.S. and the government is not involved. The USGF first applied to the FIG for recognition in 1963.\n\nSeptember 1, 1967 – Women’s Committee is formed\n\nAt the 1967 Congress held in Kansas City, the U.S. Gymnastics Federation’s Women’s Committee was formed in response to the growth of women’s competitors and private gym clubs, along with the need for a network of competitions. The National Compulsory Routines for Girls became a joint project of the USGF and the Division of Girls and Women’s Sports of the American Association of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation. The goal was to create a national system of compulsory routines for girls, along with judges’ training and certification.\n\nOctober 1, 1967 – Modern Gymnast becomes the official USGF magazine\n\n“Modern Gymnast,” published by Glenn Sundby, became the official magazine of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation. “Modern Gymnast” was instrumental in getting the word out about the creation, development, and beginning of the USGF and promoted the organization and its activities from the beginning of the 1960s and, of course, the start in 1963.\n\n1967 (exact date unknown) – FIG president visits third Coaches Congress\n\nHeld in Kansas City, Mo., International Gymnastics Federation President Arthur Gander visits and lectures at the third Congress of American Gymnastics Coaches.
