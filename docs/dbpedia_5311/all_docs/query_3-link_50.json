        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -- A government panel favors expanding an aid program for people sickened by World Trade Center dust to include people who have at least some types of cancer.\n\nCongress has set aside billions of dollars to compensate and treat people suffering from illnesses potentially caused by the clouds of soot and smoke released on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nBut the program doesn't cover cancer, which scientists have yet to conclusively link to trade center toxins.\n\nMembers of an advisory panel meeting in New York agreed Thursday some cancer patients should be covered by the program, but they were uncertain whether to extend it to all types of the disease or just some.\n\nThe committee's recommendation is due by April 2. Its advice can then either be accepted or rejected by the program's administrator.\n\nPlease leave a comment below...\n\n(Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
