        "text": "Statement from WTC Program Administrator John Howard, M.D. on WTC Final Rule\n\nAs Administrator of the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program, I would like to thank the WTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), the researchers and practitioners who have contributed greatly to the knowledge base on this issue, and the members of the 9/11 community who provided their input on this final rule, which adds certain types of cancers to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions.\n\nThe publication of this final rule marks an important step in the effort to provide needed treatment and care to 9/11 responders and survivors through the WTC Health Program. The original List of WTC-Related Health Conditions that was established by the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 did not include cancers, but allowed for the opportunity to add other health conditions over time. We received a petition to consider adding cancer from the New York Congressional Delegation. This petition was shared with the STAC to provide their expertise and recommendation on the question of adding types of cancer to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions. The WTC STAC's final recommendation became the basis for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that was published in June 2012.\n\nWhat the final rule does\n\nThe final rule adds to the list of WTC-related health conditions each of the types of cancer proposed in the June 2012 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This addition becomes effective 30-days after it is published in the Federal Register. At that time, WTC Health Program members may begin the process of certifying their cancers as WTC-related health conditions. Non-members who may be eligible can find information about applying to the WTC Health Program through its web page.\n\nCurrent members of the WTC Health Program should contact their current Clinical Center of Excellence (CCE) to begin the certification process. If you do not know which CCE you attend, please contact our call center at 1-888-982-4748.\n\nIf you are not currently enrolled in the WTC Health Program and believe you may be eligible for the Program, please visit our website for information about the application process, www.cdc.gov/wtc. You can also contact our call center at 1-888-982-4748 for information on how to apply.\n\nFederal Register display of the final rule: Federal Register Notice\n\nTypes of cancers added to WTC-related list\n\nThe Administrator adds the following types of cancers:\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the lip, tongue, salivary gland, floor of mouth, gum and other mouth, tonsil, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and other oral cavity and pharynx.\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the nasopharynx\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the nose, nasal cavity, middle ear and accessory sinuses\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the larynx\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the esophagus\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the stomach\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the colon and rectum\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the liver and intrahepatic bile duct\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the retroperitoneum, peritoneum, omentum and mesentery\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the trachea; bronchus and lung; heart, mediastinum and pleura; and other ill-defined sites in the respiratory system and intrathoracic organs\n\nMesothelioma\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the soft tissues (sarcomas)\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the skin (melanoma and non-melanoma), including scrotal cancer\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the breast\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the ovary\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the kidney\n\nMalignant neoplasms of renal pelvis, ureter and other urinary organs\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the eye and orbit\n\nMalignant neoplasms of the thyroid\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the blood and lymphoid tissues (including, but not limited to, lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma)\n\nChildhood cancers\n\nRare cancers\n\nAt present, there are no other health conditions being considered for addition to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions. The WTC Program Administrator has the authority to propose adding new conditions in the future.\n\nThe final rule will become effective on October 12, 2012."
