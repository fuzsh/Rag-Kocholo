        "text": "b. Timeframe\n\nTo be eligible, individuals must have been present at one of the eligible locations at the time or in the “immediate aftermath” of the September 11th aircraft crashes. The VCF Act defines “immediate aftermath” as “any period beginning with the terrorist-related aircraft crashes of September 11, 2001, and ending on May 30, 2002.” There are no requirements for the minimum amount of time an individual needed to be at a site for purposes of confirming presence.[5] The VCF must apply the time period that Congress established in the VCF Act.\n\n1.9 Presence Information for Specific Employers or Entities\n\nPlease view our definitive presence guide for a quick reference on some of the following entities.\n\nInformation specific to FDNY firefighters and fire officers\n\nThe VCF has an arrangement with the FDNY in which the FDNY will provide documents directly to the VCF regarding proof of a FDNY firefighter’s or fire officer’s presence at the site. As a result, FDNY firefighters and fire officers do not need to submit any documents as proof of presence at the site unless the VCF specifically requests such documents. Contacting the FDNY directly will not expedite the processing of your claim and, in fact, may delay claims processing by tying up limited resources at the FDNY. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and documentation, the VCF will contact you.\n\nInformation specific to FDNY EMS members\n\nIn limited cases, the FDNY may be able to provide documents and/or information directly to the VCF regarding proof of an EMS member’s presence at the site. Therefore, you should still submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous documents, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that you were physically present in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002. If you have your WTC Notice of Participation which was filed with the NYCERS Pension Fund to preserve your right to file for a WTC disability retirement or reclassification in the future, you should submit it with your claim as it may support presence for purposes of your VCF claim. It is also helpful if you specify your job title within EMS during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002.\n\nInformation specific to victims who worked for NYPD\n\nFor civilian NYPD members, please refer to Section 1.7 regarding documents needed to demonstrate proof of presence.\n\nFor uniformed NYPD members, the VCF will consider the documents listed below helpful in establishing presence. Each document submitted must clearly pertain to the named victim and identify the date(s) and location(s) of the victim’s WTC-related service. A complete copy of each document must be submitted, unless otherwise specified below. The VCF will review these submissions on a case-by-case basis and will notify you of any additional information required. All documents submitted for a claim are subject to verification and authentication procedures undertaken independently by the VCF. Please note that the NYPD will not be able to provide the VCF direct access to the below listed documents. You must submit at least two of the following documents if you intend to rely on them to establish presence:\n\nMemo Book/Activity Log (must include cover page and excerpts of relevant portions with consecutive pages)\n\nLine of Duty Injury Report (must include an injury date within the relevant time period and signature of supervising officer)\n\nLine of Duty Control Log\n\nFirearms Discharge/Assault Report\n\nAided Report Worksheet\n\nOvertime Report\n\nUnscheduled Overtime Report\n\nRoll Call\n\nDetail Roster Assignment Sheet\n\nNYPD Consultation Referral – Medical Division/NYPD Surgeon Form\n\nStatement of Illness/Injury\n\nDaily Activity Report\n\nCommand Log entry\n\nExposure Report (49)\n\nMedical Board Report\n\nWTC Notice of Participation\n\nNYPD Rescue Detail badge (must include victim’s name and photo)\n\nIf you need help obtaining documents to demonstrate that you were present at the site, please contact the Police Benevolent Association at 212-298-9144.\n\nNew York City Department of Sanitation\n\nThe VCF works directly with the Department of Sanitation to verify the presence of employees who participated in the rescue, recovery, and clean-up efforts. If you were a Sanitation employee during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, the VCF will contact the Sanitation Department to confirm your presence in the NYC Exposure Zone. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and documentation, the VCF will contact you.\n\nNew York State National Guard\n\nThe VCF works with the National Guard to directly obtain information for individuals who assert that they participated in the World Trade Center response while on State Active Duty. While the National Guard may be able to confirm whether an individual was on Active Duty, it does not have records that would confirm the actual location of the work. Therefore, Claimants who allege presence based on work with the National Guard will still need to submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous documents, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that they were physically present in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002.\n\nTWU Local 100: New York Public Transit Union\n\nIf you were a member of TWU Local 100 and worked at the New York City Transit Authority (“NYCTA”) in the NYC Exposure Zone, please provide your NYCTA employee identification number to the VCF. We will compare this number to records we received to confirm that you were present during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002. Note that these records provided to the VCF do not include all NYCTA employees who were involved in the emergency response effort. Therefore, you should still submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous documents, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that you were physically present in the New York City Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002.\n\nNew York State Police (“NYSP”)\n\nIf you were employed by the New York State Police (“NYSP”) and worked in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, you can contact the NYSP Medical Monitoring Unit via phone at 518-485-5044, or via email at hresource@troopers.ny.gov, to request a letter documenting the dates and locations of your deployment to the NYC Exposure Zone during that time period. Once you receive the letter, you should upload it to your claim or mail it to the VCF. You do not need to submit any additional information to demonstrate your presence at the site. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter, the VCF will contact you.\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\n\nIf you were employed by the FBI and worked at a 9/11 crash site or in the VCF’s NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, the FBI can provide you with a letter verifying your presence at the site. You should contact the FBI Call Center at 202-324-3333 to request the FBI “proof of presence” letter and once received, upload it to your claim or mail it to the VCF. You do not need to submit any additional information to demonstrate your presence at the site. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter, the VCF will contact you.\n\nDistrict Council 37 (DC-37)\n\nIf you were a DC-37 union member, your union may be able to provide information and/or documentation to support presence for purposes of your VCF claim. Please contact the union’s Safety & Health Department at 212-815-1685 and explain that you are interested in obtaining this information, if available.\n\nCommunications Workers of America’s (CWA )\n\nCertain CWA members completed a CWA WTC Recovery/Cleanup Effort Exposure Information form, which was distributed by some CWA local unions and then provided to the CWA District 1 office upon completion. These forms may support presence where they:\n\nclearly identify a VCF-qualifying date and location of service; and\n\nwere created contemporaneously with your alleged exposures.\n\nIf you were a CWA member and completed this form, please first contact the local union you were a member of at the time of 9/11 to see if they have a CWA form for you in their files. If you do not have a form on file at your local union, please leave a message for Micki Siegel de Hernandez, CWA’s National Deputy Director of Occupational Safety and Health at 202-434-1100 to see if your form is on file at the District 1 office.\n\nNote for CWA Local 1101 Members: The VCF has an arrangement with CWA Local 1101 to get information directly from them for members who participated in the World Trade Center response. You do not need to submit any proof of presence with your claim. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and documentation, the VCF will contact you.\n\nLucent Technologies\n\nIf you were a CWA member who worked for Lucent Technologies in 2001, the VCF may be able to obtain records confirming presence. The CWA District 1 union maintained lists of:\n\nIndividuals who were working as “Installers” at the Verizon building at 140 West Street in the week after 9/11; and\n\nIndividuals who received respirator training and were “certified” or approved to use those devices at Ground Zero on or before October 3, 2001.\n\nNote that these lists do not include all Lucent employees who were involved in the emergency response effort. Therefore, you should still submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous documents, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that you were physically present in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002.\n\nVerizon\n\nIf you were employed by Verizon and worked at a Verizon office located in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, Verizon may be able to provide you with a letter verifying your presence. You should contact human resources by email at hr-verify@verizon.com and request that they directly send the VCF an employer verification letter. In the body of the email, please include your first name, last name, last four digits of your social security number or your standard work or enterprise ID number, and the VCF official email address, VCF.Thirdpartyverification@usdoj.gov, which is where human resources can directly send their response. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter, the VCF will contact you.\n\nNote for Local 1101 CWA Verizon employees, including Empire City Subway: we have an arrangement with CWA Local 1101 to get information directly from them for members who participated in the World Trade Center response. You do not need to submit any proof of presence with your claim. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and documentation, the VCF will contact you.\n\nConsolidated Edison (“ConEd”)\n\nThe VCF works directly with ConEd to obtain information for ConEd employees who assert that they participated in the World Trade Center response while working for ConEd. As a result, ConEd employees do not need to submit any documents as proof of presence at the site unless the VCF specifically requests such documents. In some cases, ConEd may be able to verify that an individual worked for ConEd during the relevant timeframe but may not be able to confirm the actual location of where the individual’s work was performed. If the VCF needs additional information from you after requesting documentation from ConEd, the VCF will contact you.\n\nIf you were a contractor for ConEd, ConEd is unable to provide information regarding your presence at the site within the relevant timeframe. In that case, you should submit presence documentation (such as contemporaneous documents, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that you were physically present in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002.\n\nNew York State Workers’ Compensation Board (“WCB”)\n\nThe VCF may be able to obtain records confirming presence from the New York State Workers’ Compensation Board for individuals who have made a Workers’ Compensation claim based on their 9/11-related work. To do so, the VCF needs the WCB number associated with the individual’s Workers’ Compensation claim. You should submit documents reflecting your WCB number. You should also submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous documents, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that you were physically present in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, when you submit your claim.\n\nWTC Volunteer Fund administered by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board \"WCB\"\n\nThe VCF may be able to obtain records confirming presence from the New York State Workers’ Compensation Board for individuals who have made a claim to the WTC Volunteer Fund based on their 9/11-related work. To do so, the VCF needs the Workers’ Compensation Board number associated with the individual’s Workers’ Compensation claim. You should submit documents reflecting your WCB number. You should also submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous documents, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that you were physically present in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, when you submit your claim.\n\nAmerican Red Cross\n\nIf you were a Red Cross volunteer in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, the Red Cross may be able to provide documents and/or information directly to the VCF regarding your presence at the site. You should still submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous documents, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that you were physically present in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, when you submit your claim.\n\nWTC Health Registry\n\nFor individuals enrolled in the WTC Health Registry, the VCF has an arrangement with the WTC Health Registry to obtain direct access to individual survey responses. Claimants must first give their permission to release these responses to the VCF. The WTC Health Registry will provide you with an authorization form that authorizes the WTC Health Registry to release this information to the VCF. You can contact the WTC Health Registry by calling 866-692-9827. You will still need to submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous records, Witness Presence Statements, or affidavits) demonstrating that you were physically present in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\n\nIf you were employed by ICE (Legacy U.S. Customs Service, Legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (Investigations, Deportation and Removal Operations, or Office of the Principal Legal Advisor)) and worked in your official capacity at a 9/11 crash site, or you were assigned to a post of duty in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, ICE may be able to provide you with a letter verifying your presence. You should contact the ICE 9/11 Benefits Program by email at ICE.9-11@ice.dhs.gov to request the ICE “proof of presence” letter. Once you have qualified and received a completed proof of presence letter, you can upload it to your online claim or mail it to the VCF. You do not need to submit any additional information to demonstrate your presence at the site. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter, the VCF will contact you.\n\nFederal Employees\n\nIf you were a civil officer or employee in any branch of the Government of the United States and worked at a 9/11 crash site or in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, your employer may be able to provide you with documentation to verify your presence. If contemporaneous documents from that time are not available, you should ask your employer to complete the VCF Third Party Verification form.\n\nIf you filed a FECA claim with the U.S. Department of Labor based on your 9/11-related work, the VCF may be able to obtain documentation directly from the U.S. Department of Labor to help verify your presence. If you would like the VCF to contact the U.S. Department of Labor, you must contact the VCF Helpline to request a FECA Authorization Form, and then submit the completed form to the VCF. Note: The FECA claim might not contain information to help verify your presence. You should therefore also submit other evidence (such as contemporaneous documents or Witness Presence Statements) demonstrating that you were physically present at a 9/11 crash site or in the NYC Exposure Zone.\n\nNew York City Department of Buildings\n\nIf you were employed by the NYC Department of Buildings and worked at an office located in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, they may be able to provide you with a letter verifying your presence. You should contact human resources by email at PayrollTimekeeping@buildings.nyc.gov and request that they directly send the VCF a WTC verification letter. In the body of the email, please include your first name, last name (maiden name, if applicable), your date of birth, and the VCF official email address, VCF.Thirdpartyverification@usdoj.gov, which is where human resources can directly send their response. If you do not have access to email, you may call human resources at 212-393-2222 and request a WTC verification letter to be sent directly to the VCF.\n\nYou should also notify us once you have requested the letter from the Department of Buildings, so we know to expect it in support of your claim. You can notify us by uploading a note to your claim, or by calling our Helpline. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter, we will contact you.\n\nJP Morgan Chase & Co.\n\nIf you were employed by JP Morgan Chase and worked at a JP Morgan Chase office located in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, JP Morgan Chase may be able to provide you with a letter verifying your presence.\n\nYou should contact the employee verifications team by email at hrsd.employee.verifications@jpmchase.com and request that they directly send the VCF a work location history letter. In the body of the email please include your first name, last name, last four digits of your social security number or your standard ID number, and the VCF official email address, VCF.Thirdpartyverification@usdoj.gov, where the employee verification team can directly send their response including the work history location letter. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter, the VCF will contact you.\n\nBank of America\n\nIf you were employed by Bank of America (or one of its predecessor companies, including Merrill Lynch), and worked at an office located in the NYC Exposure Zone at any point during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, Bank of America may be able to provide you with a letter verifying your presence.\n\nYou should call the Bank of America Service Center at 1-800-556-6044 and request that they send the VCF a “9/11 work location history” letter detailing your specific office address(es) during that time. It will speed the processing of your claim if Bank of America sends the letter directly to the VCF on your behalf.\n\nWhen you call, you will be asked to provide your full name so the Service Center can look up your work history. It is very important that you ask the Service Center to email the letter to the VCF official email address: VCF.Thirdpartyverification@usdoj.gov. You must provide this email address when you call and specifically request they email the letter to the VCF.\n\nYou should also notify us once you have requested the letter from Bank of America so we know to expect it in support of your claim. You can notify us by uploading a note to your claim, or by calling our Helpline.\n\nWe will contact you if we need additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nIf you were employed by Goldman Sachs and worked at a Goldman Sachs office located in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, Goldman Sachs may be able to provide you with a letter verifying your presence. You should contact the employee verifications team by email at GS-HCM-Help-Americas@ny.email.gs.com and request an employment verification letter.\n\nIn the body of the email, please include the following: your first name, last name, last four digits of your social security number, employee ID number, work location between September 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002, the VCF mailing address: September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, P.O. Box 34500, Washington, D.C. 20043; and request the employer verification letter to confirm your work location between September 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002, for your 9/11 Victim Compensation claim to be sent directly to the VCF at our official email address, VCF.Thirdpartyverification@usdoj.gov.\n\nYou should also notify us once you have requested the letter from Goldman Sachs, so we know to expect it in support of your claim. You can notify us by uploading a note to your claim, or by calling our Helpline. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter, we will contact you.\n\nStudents and those in Day Care\n\nIf you were a student or attended day care in the NYC Exposure Zone between September 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002, you should provide a copy of your transcript, or official school or day care records from that time. College, school, or day care records and transcripts confirming enrollment or attendance during the relevant time period must be accompanied by one of the following two certifications: (1) Accuracy: A certification in the form of an accompanying letter, or a certification within the document (common on transcripts) from an employee of the college, school, or day care facility certifying the accuracy of the records; OR (2) True Copy: A certification in the form of an accompanying letter from from your legal counsel (if an attorney is assisting you with your claim) certifying that the document is a true and accurate copy of what they received directly from the school/daycare facility. You cannot certify records or transcripts yourself. The certification must come from a college, school or day care facility employee or your legal counsel (if applicable).\n\nAlumni of Stuyvesant or any area school in the NYC Exposure Zone may email info@stuyhealth.org for assistance acquiring proof of attendance for their VCF claim.\n\nVolunteers Who Signed in at Trinity Church\n\nThe VCF has records of volunteers who signed in at Trinity Church, located at Broadway & Wall Street, in the aftermath of the attacks. If you remember signing in as a volunteer at Trinity Church, you should submit a written statement with your claim with the following information: (1) note specifically that you signed in at Trinity Church while volunteering; (2) list the specific date(s) you recall signing in; and (3) provide the name of the group you volunteered with (if applicable) or a description of the type of work you were doing as a volunteer. If you submit a statement that includes this information, you do not need to submit additional presence documentation with your claim. The VCF will review your claim and our Trinity Church records and will contact you if additional proof of presence is required.\n\nSalvation Army\n\nThe VCF has an arrangement with the Salvation Army in which the Salvation Army will provide documents directly to the VCF regarding proof of a Salvation Army employee’s or volunteer’s presence at the site. As a result, Salvation Army employees or volunteers do not need to submit any documents as proof of presence at the site unless the VCF specifically request such documents. Contacting the Salvation Army directly will not expedite the processing of your claim and, in fact, may delay processing of the claim by tying up limited resources at the Salvation Army. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and documentation, the VCF will contact you.\n\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation\n\nIf you were employed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and worked in the NYC Exposure Zone during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, through May 30, 2002, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation may be able to provide you with a letter verifying your presence.\n\nYou should contact human resources by email at personnel@dec.ny.gov or call 518-402-9273 and request that they directly send the VCF an employer verification letter. In the body of the email, please include the following: your first name, last name, last four digits of your social security number, your location between September 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002, permission to disclose the information to the VCF, and the VCF’s official email address, VCF.Thirdpartyverification@usdoj.gov, which is where human resources can directly send their response. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and the letter, the VCF will contact you.\n\nPort Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority)\n\nThe VCF has an arrangement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority) in which the Port Authority will provide documents directly to the VCF regarding proof of an employee’s presence at the site. As a result, Port Authority employees do not need to submit any documents as proof of presence at the site unless the VCF specifically request such documents. Contacting the Port Authority directly will not expedite the processing of your claim and, in fact, may delay processing of the claim by tying up limited resources at the Port Authority. If the VCF needs additional information from you after reviewing your claim form and documentation, the VCF will contact you.\n\n1.10 Insufficient Evidence of Presence\n\nThe VCF verifies and authenticates all documents you submit with your claim. When you submit your complete claim form and we begin reviewing your claim, we will review each presence document. We will send you a “Missing Information” letter if the documents you submitted do not have the detailed information we need in order to prove you were there. The letter will explain why the document(s) was not sufficient, and will include information about what you can do to correct the document, or suggest additional ways you may prove your presence.\n\nIf your claim is denied for lack of proof of presence, it does not mean the VCF does not believe that you were present during the relevant timeframe. A denial means the documentation you submitted in support of your presence was not sufficient to meet the VCF’s needs. If your claim is denied, we encourage you to request an appeal following the directions in the letter so that you can provide testimony in support of your claim.\n\nFor some claimants, telling their story about their time at a 9/11 crash site or in the NYC Exposure Zone is the only way to prove their presence. By doing so at an appeal hearing, the VCF can ask clarifying questions to help evaluate the claim.\n\nIf you have exhausted every option available to you to try and find documentation to support your presence at a 9/11 crash site or in the NYC Exposure Zone during the relevant timeframe, and you cannot find any documents to submit with your claim, you may request that the VCF deny your claim and provide you the opportunity to provide testimony about your presence at an appeal hearing. Additional information about the VCF appeals and hearings process can be found in Section 4.\n\nIf you want to request that your claim be denied because you are not able to locate documents that show your presence, you should submit a letter to the VCF with a detailed explanation of the documents you have attempted to locate and the reason they were not available, and request a denial for purposes of holding an eligibility hearing. The VCF will deny your claim and will send you a letter with instructions on how to appeal.\n\n1.11 VCF 1 Claims\n\nIf you were found eligible for compensation in VCF1, you are eligible to amend your claim and seek additional compensation. You may be eligible for additional compensation if:\n\nYou suffered a new physical injury or condition that you had not suffered at the time of the VCF1 claim filing or that was not compensable at the time of VCF1.\n\nYou suffered a new loss that you had not suffered at the time of the VCF1 claim filing – for example, if you were previously compensated for non-economic loss only and have since been determined to be totally disabled due to an eligible condition, you can amend the claim to seek economic loss.\n\nYour prior eligible condition has substantially worsened, resulting in damages or loss that was not previously compensated.\n\nNote: There are two objectives when evaluating whether a claimant who already received an award in VCF1 should be awarded additional compensation in VCF2 for exacerbated or new injuries: (1) avoiding the reassessment or recalculation of any component of the VCF1 award or changing any assumption applied in making that calculation, and (2) avoiding duplication of any component of the award that was already made in VCF1. Thus, the amount of compensation you received in VCF1 will be considered when determining whether additional compensation should be awarded. As a general rule, the compensation you receive in this iteration of the VCF (“VCF2”) will be calculated based on the amount of compensation any similarly situated person who filed a claim only in VCF2 would receive; any compensation you received in VCF1 will then be applied as an adjustment to the award.\n\nIn most cases, you do not need to submit proof of presence as otherwise required if you were deemed eligible for VCF1 (see Section 1.6 for more information on proof of presence). The VCF will contact you if any additional information is needed.\n\n1.12 Eligibility Review and Determination\n\na. Preliminary Review\n\nOnce you submit your claim, it proceeds through an Automated Document Check process as a first step before it moves to Preliminary Review. This process, which is entirely automated, checks to confirm the receipt of two specific documents the VCF must have before we can begin processing a claim:\n\nComplete Signature Page\n\nExhibit A – “Authorization for Release of Medical Records” (Personal Injury Exhibit A or Deceased Victim Exhibit A)\n\nAfter allowing time for these documents to be received by the VCF, the automated process will confirm that both documents are present in the online system according to the document type associated with each document. Be careful to select the correct document type when uploading documents to claims in the online system. If one or both of these documents are missing, the system will automatically move the claim to “Denied” status and an automated letter will be generated to explain what you need to do to reactivate the claim. Note: The automated process will not confirm sufficiency or completeness of these documents – this will be done by a VCF team member during preliminary review. If the claim is denied as a result of the automated process, once the required documents are received, the claim will be reactivated for preliminary review.\n\nDuring Preliminary Review, the VCF will confirm that all of the “minimally required” documents have been submitted. In addition to a complete Claim Form, we require the documents listed below before your claim can move forward for a more substantive review. Note: the VCF does not accept electronic signatures on any of its forms and documents. Many of the third-party entities with whom we exchange information on your behalf also do not accept electronic signatures. To ensure there is no delay in the processing of your claim, please submit your document(s) with the appropriate signature where required.\n\nComplete Signature Page\n\nOriginal and signed Exhibit A – “Authorization for Release of Medical Records” (Personal Injury Exhibit A or Deceased Victim Exhibit A)\n\nConfirmation from the WTC Health Program that you have at least one physical condition certified for treatment. The VCF will contact the WTC Health Program directly to confirm you have an eligible certified condition.\n\nProof of Presence documents as specified in Section 1.6\n\nExhibit 1 – “Social Security Administration Consent Form” (required only if you are claiming economic loss)\n\nVCF Client Authorization Form (on a form to be provided by your attorney, if applicable) to deposit the payment on your claim to your attorney’s bank account or an ACH payment form if payment on your claim will be deposited to your bank account\n\nOnce we confirm we have a complete Signature Page and Exhibit A, we contact the WTC Health Program for information about your certified condition(s).\n\nIf any of the above documents are missing or insufficient, or if the WTC Health Program notifies us that you do not have a certified physical condition, the VCF will place the claim in “Denied” status. We will send you a letter explaining what you need to do to reactivate the claim. Once you submit the required documents, we will verify all the information is sufficient, and reactivate the claim for review. If applicable, the VCF will also request information from certain government entities, employers, and other third parties that may support presence for VCF purposes.\n\nb. Substantive Eligibility Review\n\nOnce we have all documents required for processing, we begin substantive review of the claim to determine if you meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the statute and implementing regulations based on the information and/or documentation in your claim file (see Section 1.1). This includes confirming that (a) the claim was registered by the applicable deadline, (b) you have an eligible 9/11-related physical condition, (c) there is sufficient documentation to demonstrate that you were present at the site, and (d) any 9/11-related lawsuits have been timely resolved.\n\nIf we need something further in order to determine your eligibility, you will receive a missing information letter. It is important that you respond to all missing information letters within the timeframe specified in the letter. If you do not respond to our missing information request after 14 days, we will render a decision based on the information contained in your file at that time.\n\nYou will receive a letter from the VCF explaining the eligibility decision on your claim. If you are found to be eligible for compensation, the letter will list the physical injury or conditions for which you have been found eligible. These are the conditions that the VCF will consider when calculating the amount of your award. If eligibility is denied, the letter will explain how to appeal the decision or how to amend your claim in the future when you are able to provide the additional information for consideration.\n\n1.13 Claims Filed on a Victim's Behalf\n\nIf you are filing a claim on the victim’s behalf, you must show that you have the legal authority to do so. This includes Personal Representatives filing a claim for a deceased victim, and court appointed guardians filing a claim for an incapacitated adult.\n\nOnly those authorized by law or court order may pursue a claim on behalf of another individual. In order to process a claim filed by someone other than the victim, the Special Master must first validate the individual’s authority to represent the victim for the VCF claim. Different types of documentation are required depending on the representative’s relationship to the victim.\n\nIf you are filing a claim on the victim’s behalf, you must submit the documents that are required for the VCF to validate your authority as an authorized representative. The list of required documents is explained in the subsections below according to the type of claim you are filing. The VCF does not require you to submit original documents.\n\nIf you are the parent of a young adult child and are helping your child with his or her VCF claim, the claim form must be completed by the adult child as a “self” claim in the victim’s name, with all applicable exhibits and supporting documents signed by the victim. The adult child can then authorize the VCF to share information about the claim with a parent by adding the parent as an “Alternative Contact” on the claim form. The adult child may also grant the parent online access to the claim in the VCF claims system. NOTE: The parent should not be listed on the claim form as an “Authorized Representative” as this designation is only applicable to Personal Representatives of deceased individuals, and court-appointed guardians of incapacitated adults.\n\nNOTE regarding Deceased Victim Claims: If you are filing a deceased victim claim (i.e., a claim filed on behalf of an individual who is believed to have died as a result of an eligible 9/11-related condition), all claims for lost earnings or benefits must be made, and all supporting documents must be submitted, before the VCF finalizes substantive review of the compensation claim. A claim has reached the final stages of substantive review when the status in the online system moves to “Determination Made: Processing.” The VCF will not allow any amendment in a deceased victim claim after a substantive determination on the compensation claim has been made, except in limited circumstances. It is therefore very important that you claim all losses and submit the required supporting documentation when you file your claim.\n\na. Personal Representative of a Deceased Victim\n\nVictim’s Death Certificate: If possible, please submit the “long form” version of the death certificate, which lists the cause of death.\n\nLetters of Administration, Letters Testamentary, or other Court Order showing the appointment as the Personal Representative, Executor of Will, or Administrator of the Estate.\n\nYour court order may include limitations. Some limitations do not interfere with the VCF’s ability to validate the Personal Representative, while other limitations may impact the VCF’s ability to process the claim. See the Instructions for Letters of Administration with Limitations for more detailed information.\n\nIf you submit Letters of Administration, Letters Testamentary, or other Court Order that includes limitations that interfere with the VCF’s ability to process or pay your claim, you will be advised in writing and given time to obtain the appropriate documentation.\n\nIn very limited circumstances where the Personal Representative is unable to obtain Letters of Administration, Letters Testamentary, or other Court Order, the Special Master may appoint a Personal Representative for purposes of the VCF claim. You must first attempt to obtain an appointment from the state probate or surrogate court where the victim lived. Please note that this option is generally available only when legal or geographical obstacles mean that the representative is unable to open an estate to obtain an appointment. For more information, please see the information on Appointment of a Personal Representative.\n\nProof of Victim’s Cause of Death: This may be included on the victim’s death certificate. If it is not included on the death certificate, other documents sufficient to show proof of cause of death may include a hospital discharge summary, or the victim’s final medical records.\n\nA complete Claim Form Signature Page: This must be signed by the Personal Representative.\n\nIf the Personal Representative has filed an amendment to a personal injury claim that was originally filed by the victim, a complete Claim Form Appendix A is required.\n\nClaims with Co-Personal Representatives: If the court has appointed multiple individuals as co-Personal Representatives for the victim’s estate, the co-Personal Representatives must designate among themselves who will serve as the Lead Personal Representative (“Lead PR”). The Lead PR is the individual who the VCF will primarily communicate with regarding the claim, and the individual to whom the VCF will issue any payment on the claim. The “VCF Lead Personal Representative Designation Form” includes information about the role of the Lead PR, and a summary of the rights and responsibilities of the other co-Personal Representatives. The form includes instructions for completing and submitting the form. See Section 6.5 for additional details and important information regarding the documentation that must be submitted, specific instructions for signing and submitting each of the required authorizations and forms, and an explanation of how any payment will be made on the claim.\n\nb.
