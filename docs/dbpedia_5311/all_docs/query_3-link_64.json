        "text": "General 8/7/2024 1:50:00 PM\n\nTelek and Fitzer Named Big West Scholar-Athletes of the Year\n\nNORTHRIDGE, Calif.---CSUN's Dorottya Telek and Kevin Fitzer were two of the 22 individuals named as 2023-24 Big West Scholar-Athletes of the Year.\n\nTwo student-athletes from each institution – one male and one female – were honored by their institutions and the conference for their accomplishments on the field, in the classroom and in their communities. The stories and accomplishments of the scholar-athletes will be featured on ESPN+ beginning on Wednesday, Aug. 14 as The Big West Academic Honors returns for a fourth year on ESPN+. The show premieres at noon PT on ESPN+ and will be available on demand for 30 days following.\n\nTelek, a senior center from the women's water polo team, earned her second consecutive Big West Scholar-Athlete of the Year award. A native of Budapest, Hungary, Telek collected her third-straight ACWPC All-America Honorable Mention award along with an All-Big West First Team selection in 2024. Telek led The Big West with 94 goals to go with a career-best 124 points. She broke CSUN's all-time career goals record this past season and finished the year at 272 goals in just three seasons with the Matadors. Telek also holds CSUN's single-season goal record of 101 set in 2023 and the single-game goal record of nine achieved twice in 2024.\n\nTelek is majoring in Business Administration - Financial Analysis at CSUN. Over her time with the Matadors, Telek has earned three Big West All-Academic Team selections and two College Sports Communicators Academic All-District Team honors. Outside of the pool, she has regularly volunteered both in Northridge and her native country of Hungary. After CSUN, she is contemplating a professional water plolo career while she has a possible long term goal to put skills in financial analysis, marketing and economics to use in the United States.\n\nOriginally from Aliso Viejo, Fitzer completed his CSUN Baseball career with back-to-back All-Big West honors. He earned an Honorable Mention this past season after leading CSUN in batting average (.321) and doubles (13) while he ranked fourth in The Big West in slugging percentage (.631), tied for fifth in home runs (11) and fifth in OPS (1.060). Fitzer previously was an All-Big West Second Team selection in 2023 when he topped CSUN with 50 RBI. Earlier in the summer, Fitzer was drafted in the 16th round of 2024 MLB First-Year Player Draft by the Colorado Rockies.\n\nFitzer earned a degree in Business Administration - Real Estate this past spring. He earned a pair of Big West All-Academic Team and CSC Academic All-District Team selections with the Matadors while he was a fixture on the CSUN Dean's List.\n\nThe Big West Scholar-Athletes of the Year represent nearly 2,400 Big West student-athletes made the Commissioners Honor Roll, which requires a 3.0 GPA or better.
