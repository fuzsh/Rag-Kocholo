        "text": "Chapter 1âOverview of the WTC Health Program\n\n1. Purpose and Scope\n\nThe purpose of the World Trade Center Health Program (WTC Health Program or the Program) Administrative Manual is to document the policies and procedures that provide the comprehensive framework for administering the Program. The audience for the PPM is internal staff, WTC Health Program support groups, and the public. The PPM will be updated regularly.\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide a general overview of the WTC Health Program, including a brief description of the history and origins of the Program, a summary of the guiding legislation, and a description of the organization that has been developed to carry out the provisions of the legislation.\n\n2. Statutory and Regulatory References\n\nThe Program is established by Public Law 111-347, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (the Zadroga Act). Title I of the Zadroga Act amended the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to add Title XXXIII, establishing the WTC Health Program within the Department of Health and Human Services. Title XXXIII of the PHS Act is codified at 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 300mm â 300mm-61. Program regulations were promulgated in Title 42, Part 88 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). Descriptions of the major provisions of the Zadroga Act and the Part 88 regulations are set forth in Section 4 below.\n\n3. History of the WTC Health Program\n\nSince the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have facilitated health evaluations and screenings for individuals who responded to those attacks in order to identify any health issues resulting from their exposures in the aftermath of the attacks.\n\nThe first such program began in 2002 with grants funded via discretionary appropriations and awarded to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (Mount Sinai) and the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) to provide health screening. Mount Sinai subcontracted with specialized occupational health clinics in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area, developing a standardized health screening protocol.\n\nIn 2003, the program was expanded to provide periodic monitoring examinations in addition to the initial health screenings. The individual clinics providing the screening and monitoring examinations were funded through cooperative agreements between NIOSH and Mt. Sinai and FDNY.\n\nIn 2006, diagnostic and treatment services were added to provide medical care for WTC-related occupational health conditions. The program was called the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP). The program medical providers were individually funded as Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCEs) and included Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York University School of Medicine-Bellevue Hospital Center, Queens College, Richmond University Medical Center, State University of New York (SUNY)-Stony Brook, and University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Services were made available outside the NYC metropolitan area through a network of providers via a contract with Logistics Health, Incorporated (LHI).\n\nIn 2008, additional funds were appropriated to provide screening, diagnostic, and treatment services to residents, students, and others who were affected by the September 11, 2001 attacks in NYC, under the WTC Environmental Health Center (EHC) Community Program, operated under a CDC-sponsored grant to the NYC Health + Hospitals Corporation.\n\nOn January 2, 2011, the President signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act into law, establishing the WTC Health Program within the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n4. Summary of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111-347\n\nThe WTC Health Program was mandated to begin on July 1, 2011. Only services provided on and after that date are covered by the WTC Health Program [PHS Act, Â§ 3301(a); 42 C.F.R. Part 88]. The Program is required to provide:\n\nMedical monitoring and treatment benefits to eligible emergency responders and recovery and cleanup workers who responded to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in NYC, Shanksville, PA, and the Pentagon [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3301(a)(1), 3301(b)(1), and 3301(b)(3)]; and\n\nInitial health evaluation, monitoring and treatment benefits to eligible residents and other building occupants and area workers in NYC who were directly impacted by the attacks [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3301(a)(2), 3301(b)(2) and 3301(b)(3)].\n\nThese services are provided at no cost to the enrolled members; there is no cost-sharing [PHS Act, Â§ 3301(c)].\n\nWTC Program Administrator. The Administrator of the WTC Health Program administers the WTC Health Program. The PHS Act directs the Secretary of HHS to designate a Department official to be the WTC Program Administrator [PHS Act, Â§ 3306(14)]. Certain specific activities of the Administrator are reserved to the Secretary to delegate at her discretion; other duties of the Administrator not explicitly reserved to the Secretary are specifically assigned to the Director of NIOSH or his or her designee. The Secretary has designated the Director of NIOSH to also serve as the WTC Program Administrator for the discretionary activities; the Secretary delegated responsibilities for disbursing payments to providers under the WTC Health Program to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (see Delegation of Authority, 76 Fed. Reg. 31337, May 31, 2011). Specific duties of the Administrator include:\n\nEstablish an enrollment process for eligible responders and screening-eligible survivors [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3311(a)(3) and 3321(a)(1)(C); 42 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 88.4 and 88.8];\n\nEstablish end-dates for Pentagon and Shanksville responder eligibility [PHS Act, Â§ 3311(a)(2)(C)(i) and (ii); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.4(b) and (c)];\n\nEstablish a process for the certification of health conditions [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3312(b)(1)(B) and 3321(a)(2)(B); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.13];\n\nAdd new health conditions to the List of WTC-Related Health conditions via rulemaking [PHS Act, Â§ 3312(a)(5) and (6); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.17];\n\nEstablish a medical necessity standard [PHS Act, Â§ 3312(b)(3); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.14];\n\nEstablish a quality assurance program to ensure adherence to monitoring and treatment protocols, appropriate diagnostic and treatment referrals, prompt communication of test results to participants, and other programmatic elements the Administrator finds necessary [PHS Act, Â§ 3301(e)];\n\nSubmit annual report to Congress, including statistics on eligible individuals; costs of monitoring, screening, and treatment; administrative costs; administrative experience; summary of new scientific reports or studies that address WTC-related exposures; and WTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee recommendations and Administratorâs actions on those recommendations [PHS Act, Â§ 3301(f)].\n\nWTC Responder Enrollment and Eligibility. The PHS Act establishes eligibility criteria for New York City responders [PHS Act, Â§ 3311(a)(1) and (2); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.4(a)], Pentagon responders [PHS Act, Â§ 3311(a)(2)(C); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.4(b)], and Shanksville responders [PHS Act, Â§ 3311(a)(2)(C); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.4(c)]. Eligibility is limited by the number of responders already enrolled in the Program [PHS Act, Â§ 3311(a)(4); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.6(c)(2)(i)] and by membership on the terrorist watch list [PHS Act, Â§ 3311(a)(5); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.6(c)(3)].\n\nWTC Survivor Enrollment and Eligibility. The PHS Act establishes eligibility criteria for New York City screening-eligible survivors [PHS Act, Â§ 3321(a)(1)(C); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.8(a)] and certified-eligible survivors [PHS Act, Â§ 3321(a)(2); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.8(b)]. The PHS Act requires that initial health evaluations are provided at no charge by a Clinical Center of Excellence to determine if the screening-eligible survivor has a WTC-related health condition [PHS Act, Â§ 3321(b)]. Eligibility is limited by the number of certified-eligible survivors already enrolled in the Program [PHS Act, Â§ 3321(a)(3); 42 C.F.R. Â§88.10(f)(2)(i)] and by membership on the terrorist watch list [PHS Act, Â§ 3321(a)(4); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.10(f)(3)].\n\nWTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (STAC). The STAC is established by the Administrator of the WTC Health Program, with a specified, diverse membership. The meeting frequency of the STAC is discretionary. Reports of the STAC are to be published on the WTC Health Program website [PHS Act, Â§ 3302(a)].\n\nWTC Health Program Steering Committees. The PHS Act establishes two steering committees -- one for WTC responders, and another for WTC survivors [PHS Act, Â§ 3302(b)]. Each of these committees establishes a forum for providing input from affected stakeholders and for facilitating the coordination of services for eligible individuals. Each has specific requirements for membership, and was initially composed of members of steering committees that were in existence as of the date the Zadroga Act was signed into law. The steering committees appoint their own members, and the WTC Program Administrator is to consult with the two committees.\n\nCertification of Health Conditions. An initial list of WTC-related health conditions is established by the PHS Act [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3312(a)(3) and 3322(b); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.1]. The WTC Health Program is required to certify WTC-related health conditions for treatment and monitoring [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3312(b)(1)(B)(ii) and 3321(a)(2)(B); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.13] after a Program physician determines that exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition [PHS Act, Â§ 3312(a)(1)(A)(i); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.12] or is a mental health condition for which a Program physician finds that the terrorist attacks are substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing [PHS Act, Â§3312(a)(1)(A)(ii)]. The health condition must be included on the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions [PHS Act, Â§ 3312(a)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. Â§88.1] or must be identified as a health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition [PHS Act, Â§ 3312(a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii); 42 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 88.1 and 88.12(b)]. Denials of certification may be appealed [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3312(b)(1)(B)(iii), 3312(b)(2)(B)(iv), and 3312(b)(3)(B); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.15].\n\nMedical Benefits. The PHS Act establishes that the scope of treatment covered by the Program includes services of physicians and other healthcare providers, diagnostic and laboratory tests, prescription drugs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, and other medically necessary treatment [PHS Act, Â§ 3312(b)(4)(A)]. The Program may approve the provision of medical treatment until a determination is made to certify the health condition [PHS Act, Â§ 3312(b)(5)].\n\nClaims Processing and Billing. Benefits under the WTC Health Program for work-related health conditions are to be offset by workersâ compensation benefits, except for those plans to which NYC is obligated to make payments. WTC Health Program benefits do not absolve other workersâ compensation, injury or illness, or health insurance plans of their obligations regarding payment of claims for medical treatment of Program members [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3331 and 3351]. Payments for initial health evaluation, monitoring, and treatment are to be made using the rates applicable under the Federal Employeesâ Compensation Act (FECA) regulations in 20 C.F.R. Part 20. If no FECA rate is available, the WTC Health Program may establish a payment rate by regulation. Payment rates may not exceed the rate the Office of Workerâs Compensation Programs in the Department of Labor would pay for such products or services at the time they were provided [PHS Act, Â§ 3312(c)(1)(A); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.16].\n\nData Centers. The PHS Act requires the Administrator to enter into contracts with the Data Centers to: receive, analyze, and report data from the CCEs to the WTC Health Program Administrator; develop Program monitoring, treatment, and initial health evaluation protocols; coordinate outreach activities with the CCEs; establish criteria to credential medical providers participating in the Program; coordinate and administer the activities of the WTC Health Program Steering Committees; and meet with the CCEs for input on data collection and analysis and medical protocols [PHS Act, Â§ 3305(a)(2)].\n\nClinical Centers of Excellence (CCEs). The PHS Act requires the Administrator to enter into contracts with the CCEs to: provide monitoring, treatment, and initial health evaluation benefits; conduct outreach to eligible and enrolled individuals; provide counseling regarding benefits available under the WTC Health Program and other programs; provide translational and interpretive services for non-English-proficient participants; and collect and report data [PHS Act, Â§ 3305(a)(1)]. The definition of and contract requirements for CCEs, as well as transition requirements for continuity of care are also provided [PHS Act, Â§ 3305(b)].\n\nNationwide Provider Network. The PHS Act requires the Administrator to establish a nationwide network of healthcare providers to provide monitoring and treatment benefits and initial health evaluation near such individualsâ areas of residence in such states [PHS Act, Â§ 3313(a)]. Any healthcare provider participating in the network is required to meet criteria for credentialing established by the Data Centers; following Program treatment protocols; collect and report data; and meet fraud, quality assurance, and other Program requirements [PHS Act, Â§ 3313(b)].\n\nMember Services. The PHS Act requires the development of an outreach program to provide information to potentially eligible individuals regarding benefits, clinical data collection and analysis, and research on health conditions resulting from the terrorist attacks [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3301(b)(4) and 3303]. Outreach must include a public Website, meetings with potentially eligible persons, development and distribution of outreach materials, and telephone information services. The services must be carried out in such a way as to reach all affected populations, and include materials for culturally and linguistically diverse populations [PHS Act, Â§ 3303].\n\nGovernmental Affairs. The HHS Inspector General is required to conduct reviews of the healthcare and administrative expenditures under the Program to detect potential fraudulent or duplicate billing, payment for inappropriate services, or unreasonable administrative costs [PHS Act, Â§ 3301(d)].\n\nPharmacy Benefits. Pharmacy prescription benefits are to be paid through contracts with outside vendors, using a competitive bidding process. A separate contract may be used for FDNY participants [PHS Act, Â§Â§ 3312(b)(4)(B) and 3312(c)(1)(B)].\n\n5. Organization\n\nThe WTC Health Program is administered by NIOSH, which is part of CDC within HHS. NIOSH offices in Washington, DC, Atlanta, GA, Cincinnati, OH, and Pittsburgh, PA are involved in the program. NIOSH is responsible for overall program policy, management, and oversight, and carries out certain functions, such as certification of enrollments, certification of health conditions, and appeals. The work of the WTC Health Program is carried out through teams comprised of NIOSH and contractor employees. Contractors currently include the Program Management and Administration (PM&A) contractor, CSC; CCEs; DCs; and the National Provider Network (NPN) contractor, LHI. In addition, NIOSH and the PM&A contractor interface with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and its payment contractor in the hand-off of a payment file for payment of authorized claims.\n\nMajor teams supporting the Programâs administration functions are:\n\nHealth Plan Operations\n\nMember Services\n\nMedical Benefits\n\nContracts and Claims\n\nThe PM&A contractor (CSC) is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the WTC Health Program, including developing and executing Program infrastructure and technical support. The contractor maintains a mailroom for the receipt and distribution of paper-based communications in Rensselaer, NY; member services (enrollment, certification, and communications) and other administrative functions are located in metropolitan Washington, DC; claims processing takes place in Atlanta, GA; and a call center is located in Fort Worth, TX. Contacts to any of these services may be made through the call center at 1-888-WTC-HP4U (1-888-982-4748).\n\nThe CCEs and the NPN contractor (LHI) provide face-to-face assistance and services to enrolled members and potential members. They assist with completing enrollment forms, provide medical monitoring, screening, and treatment services, and make referrals to enrolled medical providers for some medical services. They also take part in establishing program guidelines, oversee medical treatment, and submit claims for medical reimbursement. There are six (6) CCEs in NYC, as well as the NPN contractor for services outside the NYC Metropolitan Area. A list of the CCEs, as well as contact information for them and the NPN contractor, may be found at https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/clinics.html.\n\nThere are three DCs providing the services described in section 4.M above, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, Health + Hospitals Corporation (Bellevue Hospital), and FDNY.\n\nMedical providers other than the CCEs may take part in the WTC Health Program only if they have been enrolled in the program as an eligible provider through a CCE or the NPN.\n\nChapter 2âEligibility and Enrollment\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nLast Revised â August, 2019\n\nPurpose and Scope\n\nStatutory and Regulatory References\n\nResponsibilities\n\nOverview â Eligibility and Enrollment\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nEnrollment\n\nDisenrollment\n\nAppeal of Enrollment Denial\n\nAppendices\n\nAppendix 2-A FDNY Responder Eligibility Application\n\nAppendix 2-B Responder Eligibility Application (Other Than FDNY)\n\nAppendix 2-C Survivor Eligibility Application\n\nAppendix 2-D Pentagon/Shanksville Eligibility Application\n\n1. Purpose and Scope\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide a description of the eligibility requirements for enrollment in the WTC Health Program, of the processes for determining eligibility under the WTC Health Program, and the processes for enrolling members. Eligibility requirements, instructions and applications can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/apply.html.\n\n2. Statutory and Regulatory References\n\nProcedures for the determination of eligibility and enrollment of WTC Health Program members are guided by the following sections of Title XXXIII of the Public Health Service Act (Act):\n\nSection 3311, Identification of WTC Responders and Provision of WTC-Related Monitoring Services;\n\nand\n\nSection 3321, Identification and Initial Health Evaluation of Screening-Eligible and Certified-Eligible WTC Survivors.\n\nProgram eligibility criteria are established in the following sections of 42 C.F.R. Part 88:\n\nSection 88.3, Eligibility--currently identified responders;\n\nSection 88.4, Eligibility criteria--WTC responders;\n\nSection 88.5, Application process--WTC responders;\n\nSection 88.6, Enrollment decision--WTC responders;\n\nSection 88.7, Eligibility--currently identified survivors;\n\nSection 88.8, Eligibility criteria--WTC survivors;\n\nSection 88.9, Application process--WTC survivors;\n\nSection 88.10, Enrollment decision--screening-eligible survivors;\n\nSection 88.11, Initial health evaluation for screening-eligible survivors;\n\nSection 88.12, Enrollment decision--certified-eligible survivors; and\n\nSection 88.13, Disenrollment.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\nMany parts of the WTC Health Program have responsibilities related to eligibility and enrollment in the Program.\n\nClinical Centers of Excellence (CCEs) are responsible for providing information on responders and survivors enrolled in the WTC predecessor programs [WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) and the WTC Environmental Health Center (EHC) Community Program] so that the members may be enrolled in the WTC Health Program and continuity of care ensured. The CCEs also provide support for enrollment of new members in the WTC Health Program through outreach programs, education, and assistance to potential applicants completing the enrollment forms.\n\nData Centers (DCs) are responsible for processing all new members into the appropriate cohort (responder or survivor). Once an applicant is determined to be eligible, his/her name is added to the list of new enrollees that the Health Program Support (HPS) contractor sends to the DC each week. The DC inputs new enrollees into its database. The Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) DC which services the responder program [except for Fire Department of New York City (FDNY) responders who receive services through the FDNY CCE and DC] will also include the CCE selection made by the member and will notify the CCE of the new member that has been assigned to its clinic.\n\nThe Nationwide Provider Network (NPN), administered by Logistics Health Incorporated (LHI), is the WTC Health Programâs provider network for members living outside of the New York (NY) metropolitan area, including those from Shanksville, PA and Arlington, VA (the site of the Pentagon). The NPN received from the Program a list of responders living outside of the NY metropolitan area who were in the predecessor WTC MMTP, and receives weekly updates on NPN enrollees from the HPS contractor. After receiving the list of new NPN enrollees, the NPN enters the members into its system and reaches out to the new members to educate them regarding NPN processes for obtaining covered benefits.\n\nThe Business Services Outsourcing Center (BSOC), part of the HPS contractorâs organization, scans the enrollment forms and any attachments sent with the application, and assigns a Document Control Number (DCN) to each.\n\nThe WTC Health Program HPS contractor receives new enrollment applications, captures information in the claims processing system, examines the enrollment packages for completeness, requests additional information as needed, and makes referrals to the Programâs Member Services Team for the final enrollment certification decisions. After the Member Services Team has made a final decision to approve, the HPS contractor sends notification of approval to the applicant and to the correlating DC or, when the enrollee lives outside the NY metropolitan area, the NPN. When a member is determined to be eligible, the HPS contractor sends out welcome packages and follows up with the new enrollees to select a CCE. If an applicant is determined not to be eligible for the Program, the applicant receives a letter explaining why enrollment was denied and is provided an opportunity to appeal. In addition, during the initial implementation of the WTC Health Program, the HPS contractor worked with the DCs and CCEs to enroll the previously enrolled (grandfathered) members in the Program.\n\nThe Programâs Member Services Team reviews the finalized enrollment packages and, after the clearance of the applicant again the Terrorist Watch List (TWL), makes the final eligibility decision. For all eligibility denials, the Member Services lead will review the denial package and letter to approve the reason(s) for denial before replying to the applicant. The Program also processes any appeals of enrollment decisions.\n\n4. OverviewâEligibility and Enrollment\n\nEligibility\n\nThe PHS Act identifies multiple member groups eligible to participate in the WTC Health Program. Membership groups include: responders from the Fire Department of New York City (FDNY); other specified New York responders; New York survivors; surviving immediate family members of the 343 FDNY responders who perished on September 11, 2001; Pentagon responders; and Shanksville, PA responders.\n\nSome responders and survivors were enrolled in predecessor programs prior to the start date of the WTC Health Program (July 1, 2011). Responders who were enrolled with FDNY or the MMTP prior to July 1, 2011 and survivors who were enrolled in the EHC Community Program prior to January 2, 2011, were automatically enrolled (following Terrorist Watch List screening) in the WTC Health Program. These members were enrolled in batches.\n\nResponders and survivors who newly enroll in the WTC Health Program on or after July 1, 2011, and survivors who enrolled in the predecessor program between January 2, 2011 and June 30, 2011, are required to use the WTC Health Program Office of Management and Budget (OMB)-approved application forms to enroll in the Program. The application forms are specific to each member group, and describe the criteria necessary to qualify for the Program. FDNY responders, general New York responders, Pentagon and Shanksville responders, and survivors each have a distinct application form that is unique to the eligibility requirements for each group. These forms may be found in Appendices 2-A through 2-D.\n\nThe âresponderâ member group of surviving immediate family members of the 343 FDNY responders who perished on September 11, 2001 is generally considered to be a closed group; however, if someone believes s/he is eligible for this cohort, that person may use the FDNY responder application and complete the appropriate sections (Appendix 2-A). Because of the Supreme Court decision in U.S. v. Windsor, 133 S.Ct. 2675 (2013), striking down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, there may be individuals who were in same-sex marriages as of September 11, 2001, who are newly eligible for certain benefits within the WTC Health Program. The WTC Health Program is also extending this eligibility to certain persons who were in same-sex or opposite-sex domestic partnerships as of September 11, 2001. Specifically, an applicant may be eligible if s/he (a) were in a same-sex marriage (see the following paragraph), civil union, or domestic partnership, with a member of the FDNY who was killed at the WTC site on September 11, 2001; and (b) received any treatment for a WTC-related mental health condition on or before September 1, 2008.\n\nFor purposes of eligibility, the WTC Health Program recognizes a same-sex marriage or civil union if it was legally valid under the laws of the state or other jurisdiction, whether foreign or domestic, when and where the marriage or civil union was performed. The WTC Health Program follows this approach regardless of where the couple lived on September 11, 2001. In addition, the WTC Health Program recognizes as a surviving immediate family member an individual who will attest via affidavit that, on September 11, 2001, s/he was in a same-sex or opposite-sex domestic partnership with a member of the FDNY who was killed at the WTC site on that date, regardless of where the domestic partners lived on September 11, 2001, or where the surviving domestic partner lives now. This policy is consistent with a post-Windsor policy of treating same-sex marriages on the same terms as opposite-sex marriages to the greatest extent reasonably possible.\n\nApplication Forms: Completion, Submission, and Records Creation\n\nInformation for WTC Health Program applicants, including application forms, can be found on the How to Apply page. Individuals can also call the WTC Health Program Call Center and request that an application be mailed to them.\n\nIf applicants have questions about how to complete their enrollment application, they can contact the WTC Health Program Call Center. Trained Customer Service Representatives at the WTC Health Program Call Center are able to answer questions regarding the enrollment process. Assistance in languages other than English is available. The CCE outreach teams and the outreach and education contractors (see Chapter 9) also provide enrollment assistance to individuals as part of outreach activities.\n\nResponder and survivor application forms are sent to the WTC Health Program mailroom (BSOC) at the following address:\n\nWTC Enrollment\n\nPO Box 7000\n\nRensselaer, NY 12144-7000\n\nAlternatively, applications may be faxed to 1-877-646-5308. BSOC scans the enrollment form and any attachments, and assigns a Document Control Number (DCN), a 12-character length field, in the following format: W (for World Trade Center); 2-digit year; 3-digit Julian date; 4-digit batch number; 3-digit sequential number. The scanned enrollments are delivered to the Enrollment Operations Team via a secure File Transport Protocol (SFTP) server.\n\nThe Enrollment Operations Team, which is part of the HPS Member Services Team (MST), receives the application forms and attachments, assigns them to enrollment processors, and tracks the inventory. The enrollment processor creates the Member Record and the Enrollment Record in the claims processing system.\n\nEnrollment Determination\n\nApplications go through multiple assessment stages. The applications are accepted, entered in the claims processing system, and reviewed by the Enrollment Operations Team. By applying the processes outlined in 42 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 88.5 and 88.9, the team determines if more documentation is required to adequately support an application. If more documentation is needed, an enrollment processor reaches out to the applicant immediately to offer guidance. Once adequate documentation is attached to the application, and the application has been entered into the system, the application is sent to the Programâs Member Services Team to make a formal enrollment decision.\n\nInformation on all applicants who are deemed eligible for membership in the Program is then sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to confirm, per the requirements of the Act, Â§Â§ 3311(a)(5) and 3321(a)(4), that they are not on the TWL. Once the applicant is cleared against the TWL, the Enrollment Operations Team is given the direction to officially enroll new members into the Program and the system is updated. The DCs are sent a list of all new enrollees and the NPN is notified of any new NPN enrollees on a weekly basis.\n\nNotification to Members\n\nNotification of membership status is provided to all new members; however, the method by which the members are notified is dependent upon their membership group. Methods have been developed between each member cohort and the Program, as described below.\n\nResponders receive a letter from the WTC Health Program, signed by the Administrator of the WTC Health Program, informing them of their acceptance into the WTC Health Program. They also receive a phone call from an Enrollment Processor to help them understand the network of CCEs that is available to them, and to help them select the CCE that is right for them.\n\nSurvivors receive a letter from the WTC Health Program, signed by the Administrator, informing them of their acceptance into the WTC Health Program. This letter details the three hospital locations that treat WTC Health Program survivors in the NY metropolitan area, and provides a centralized booking phone number the members may call to set up their screening appointment.\n\nResponders and survivors who live outside the NY metropolitan area receive a letter signed by the Administrator of the WTC Health Program, informing them of their acceptance into the Program and notifying them that the NPN will be in touch to discuss next steps.\n\nThe WTC Health Program may deny Program enrollment if the enrollment criteria are not met; the Program may disenroll a member if the member was mistakenly enrolled or the enrollment was based on incorrect or fraudulent information. Sections 6 and 7 below provides more detail on enrollment and disenrollment, respectively. Denials and disenrollments may be appealed to the Administrator. The Administrator will ensure an appeal review is conducted in a timely manner and notify the applicant of the decision made. Section 8 below provides more detail on the appeal process.\n\n5.

Â§ 88.7). Survivors, including WTC responders, who were identified as eligible for medical treatment and monitoring within the WTC EHC Community Program as of January 2, 2011, are considered certified-eligible in the WTC Health Program and are not required to submit a new application.\n\nEligibility criteria for WTC survivors (PHS Act, Â§ 3321(a)(1)(B); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.8)\n\nCriteria for status as a screening-eligible survivor. An individual who is not a WTC responder, claims symptoms of a WTC-related health condition, and who has not been previously identified as eligible may apply for a determination of eligibility for an initial health evaluation.\n\nThe applicant's eligibility for an initial health evaluation is determined based on one of the following criteria:\n\nThe screening applicant was present in the dust or dust cloud in the NYC disaster area on September 11, 2001;\n\nThe screening applicant worked, resided, or attended school, childcare, or adult daycare in the NYC disaster area, for at least:\n\n4 days during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on January 10, 2002; or\n\n30 days during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on July 31, 2002.\n\nThe screening applicant worked as a cleanup worker or performed maintenance work in the NYC disaster area during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on January 10, 2002, and had extensive exposure to WTC dust as a result of such work;\n\nThe screening applicant:\n\nWas deemed eligible to receive a grant from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation Residential Grant Program;\n\nPossessed a lease for a residence or purchased a residence in the NYC disaster area; and\n\nResided in such residence during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on May 31, 2003;\n\nThe screening applicant is an individual whose place of employmentâ\n\nAt any time during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on May 31, 2003, was in the NYC disaster area; and\n\nWas deemed eligible to receive a grant from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation WTC Small Firms Attraction and Retention Act program or other government incentive program designed to revitalize the lower Manhattan economy after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nCriteria for status as a certified-eligible survivor. Survivors who have been determined to have screening-eligible status may seek status as a certified-eligible survivor. Status as a certified-eligible survivor is based on a certification by the WTC Health Program that, pursuant to an initial health evaluation, the screening-eligible survivor has a WTC-related health condition and is eligible for follow-up monitoring and treatment.\n\n6. Enrollment\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nEach application will be acknowledged with an appropriate letter, as follows. Letter templates may be found in the âEligibility Determinations, Health Condition Certifications, & Treatment Determinations Subject to Member Appealsâ policy and procedure document, found in the Programâs file of record.\n\nAcknowledgment of Receipt of Application\n\nAcknowledgement of Receipt + Information Needed\n\nReminder Letters\n\nIf additional information is needed to complete an application, the Enrollment Operations Center will make repeated attempts to obtain the information. Letters are sent at 30 and 90 day intervals, as follows. Templates may be found in the âEligibility Determinations, Health Condition Certifications, & Treatment Determinations Subject to Member Appealsâ document:\n\n30-Day Information Needed Reminder\n\n90-Day Reminder/Warning Letter\n\nScreening\n\nUpon receipt of a completed application, the Enrollment Operations Team prepares summary information for the HPS Member Services Team to review in considering the application. Each eligibility determination gives consideration to:\n\nAll information provided by the applicant in the enrollment application;\n\nAll other materials that are in the application record held by the Enrollment Operations Team that are related to the requirements for the particular eligibility category or categories for which the applicant may be eligible (for example, supporting documentation which provides proof of presence at the site);\n\nThe âWTC Health Program Policy and Procedures for Eligibility Determinations, Health Condition Certifications & Treatment Determinations Subject to Member Appealsâ document, as well as any other guidance, protocols, or procedures promulgated by the WTC Health Program; and\n\nPrior enrollment decisions impacting survivors who re-enroll in the WTC Health Program\n\nAs the Enrollment Operations Team processes applications for final decisions, the Enrollment Operations Team Manager will perform quality assurance by reviewing for accuracy all aspects of the application, including data entry and the decision logic for each recommendation sent to the Programâs Member Services lead. After review of the final application, the Enrollment Operations Team makes one of the following recommendations for dispensation of the application:\n\nRecommend Enroll — Eligible and qualified for enrollment;\n\nRecommend Deny — Not eligible and/or qualified for enrollment;\n\nStatus Defer — Survivor otherwise eligible, but applicant does not claim symptoms in application;\n\nStatus Inactive — 180 days after application receipt and request for needed information, information to complete application has not been provided;\n\nStatus Closure — Applicant withdrew application or another reason exists to administratively close file; or\n\nStatus Incomplete — Enrollment Operations Team has requested needed information and is awaiting more information.\n\nWTC Program Administratorâs Determination of Enrollment Eligibility. One of three enrollment determinations will be made for each application:\n\nEnroll;\n\nDeny; or\n\nSuspend determination until more information is available (used in the case of Enrollment Operations Team applicant status of \"defer,\" \"inactive,\" \"closure,\" or incomplete\").\n\nEnrollment Approval\n\nPrior to final approval of an applicantâs enrollment, the Program transmits the applicantâs information to the FBI to ensure that the applicant is not on the TWL, in compliance with the requirements of the PHS Act and 42 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 88.6(c)(3) and 88.10(b)(3).\n\nPotential Enrollment Denial Any enrollment denial recommendation shall be based on a thorough evaluation of the application record by the Enrollment Operations Team before presentation to the WTC Health Program Member Services staff for an enrollment eligibility determination. Applicant enrollment is favored unless clear evidence exists that the applicant does not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria established in the PHS Act and described in 42 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 88.4 and 88.8.\n\nNotification to Applicant of Enrollment Determination The Program notifies the applicant of the status of his/her application with the appropriate letter, as follows. Templates may be found in the âEligibility Determinations, Health Condition Certifications, & Treatment Determinations Subject to Member Appealsâ document. The following statuses are possible:\n\nEnroll\n\nResponder Enrollment\n\nScreening — Eligible Survivor Enrollment\n\nDeny The notification of a denial of enrollment will be sent whenever contact information is available and will contain the following information:\n\nThe reason(s) for denial of enrollment\n\nDetail regarding any insufficient documentation to determine the applicantâs eligibility for enrollment:\n\nInsufficient documentation about time, location, activity or exposure elements;\n\nInsufficient explanation of how the applicant attempted but was unable to obtain the documentation to support time, location, activity or exposure elements; or\n\nFailure to sign the application attesting that all of the information provided is truthful.\n\nInformation about the right to appeal a denial of enrollment and how to file an appeal.\n\nDefer\n\n180-Day/Inactive\n\nClosure\n\n7. Disenrollment\n\nWTC Health Program Disenrollment Decision.\n\nThe WTC Health Program may disenroll a WTC Health Program member, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.13, in the following circumstances:\n\nThe WTC Health Program mistakenly enrolled an individual who did not provide sufficient proof of eligibility consistent with the required eligibility criteria; or\n\nThe WTC Health Program memberâs enrollment was based on incorrect or fraudulent information.\n\nNotification to Disenrolled Member.\n\nA disenrolled WTC Health Program member will be notified in writing by the WTC Health Program of a disenrollment decision, provided an explanation, as appropriate, for the decision, any administrative actions resulting from the decision, and provided information on how to appeal the decision. A disenrolled WTC Health Program member may appeal the disenrollment decision in accordance with Section 8 below.\n\n8. Appeal of Enrollment Denial\n\nAll applicants have the right to appeal an enrollment denial or disenrollment decision, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.14.\n\nRequests to appeal a denial of enrollment or a disenrollment decision must be postmarked within 120 calendar days of the date of the letter from the Administrator notifying the denied applicant or disenrolled member of the adverse decision. A valid request for an appeal must (1) be made in writing and signed; (2) identify the denied applicant or disenrolled WTC Health Program member and designated representative (if applicable); (3) describe the decision being appealed and state the reasons why the denied applicant, disenrolled WTC Health Program member, or designated representative believes the enrollment denial or disenrollment was incorrect and should be reversed; and (4) be sent to the WTC Health Program at the address specified in the notice of denial or disenrollment. The appeal request may include relevant new information not previously considered by the WTC Health Program. 1\n\nAn appeal request that meets the above requirements, however, will still be considered invalid and outside the scope of the WTC Health Programâs administrative appeal process if its sole argument is a challenge to existing law, regulations, or Program policies. In other words, if the issues raised in the appeal have already been determined by law, regulation, or Program policy, then the appeal may not move forward because there are no outstanding issues for the Program to resolve with respect to the individual appellant. For example, an appeal request may not challenge the enrollment criteria established in the Zadroga Act or the Programâs regulation because those criteria are established by law and may only be changed by an act of Congress amending the law or the Program promulgating an amendment to the regulation, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, an appeal request may not challenge a Program policy that has been established by the Administrator and is applicable to all Program applicants and/or members. Any challenge to criteria established by law, regulation, or Program policy through the appeal process would be ineffectual because revisions to such criteria require a broader legal, regulatory, or policy action that would be applicable to all Program members; therefore, the challenge cannot be addressed in the appeal of an individual applicant or member. An appeal request may, however, challenge the Programâs application of the enrollment criteria (e.g., the individual could argue that the Program incorrectly determined the number of hours he/she worked or volunteered during a covered time period).\n\nAn individual wishing to voice concerns or request that the Administrator change a Program regulation or Program policy may write to the Administrator (separate and distinct from any individual appeal process). Changes to the Zadroga Act require an act of Congress.\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, the Administrator will appoint a Federal Official to review the appeal request. The Federal Official is independent of the WTC Health Program and not engaged in any enrollment and eligibility or disenrollment decisions other than appeals, allowing for an objective third-party review of the facts.\n\nThe appeal request can be mailed or submitted electronically to the appeal coordinator at:\n\nAppeal Coordinator\n\nWTC Health Program\n\nP.O. Box 7000\n\nRensselaer, NY 12144\n\nFax: 1.404.471.8338\n\nThe appeal procedure is as follows:\n\nThe WTC Health Program Appeal Coordinator reviews the appeal of enrollment denial or disenrollment and, in a timely manner, determines if the appeal is valid. Valid appeals are referred to the appointed Federal Official for review and recommendation.\n\nThe Federal Official will review all available records and assess whether the appeal should be granted. The Federal Official may consider additional relevant new information submitted and will provide a recommendation regarding the disposition of the appeal to the Administrator.\n\nAfter receipt of the Federal Officialâs recommendation, the Administrator will make a final decision on the appeal.\n\nThe applicant is notified of the appeal outcome, as well as any actions taken by the WTC Health Program resulting from the decision, with the appropriate letter from the Administrator of the WTC Health Program.\n\nPursuant to 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.25, the Administrator is permitted to reopen a final determination at any time and to affirm, vacate, or modify that determination in any manner he or she deems appropriate.\n\nTemplates of these letters may be found in the âEligibility Determinations, Health Condition Certifications, & Treatment Determinations Subject to Member Appealsâ document:\n\nAppeal of Enrollment Denial Granted — Notice that appeal of enrollment eligibility denial was granted\n\nAppeal of Enrollment Denial Denied — Notice that appeal of enrollment denial was denied\n\nAppeal Received — Appeal is referred to the appropriate Federal agency\n\n142 C.F.R.

Purpose and Scope\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to describe the circumstances in which a health condition may be certified under Title XXXIII of the PHS Act, the certification process, responsibilities in the certification process, conditions that may be certified, communications regarding certifications, and appeals of certification decisions. Further detail on the certification process is provided in the WTC Health Program Member Services Operations Manual, found in the Programâs file of record.\n\n2. Statutory and Regulatory References\n\nThe following sections of Title XXXIII of the PHS Act are applicable to this Chapter:\n\nSection 3312(a)(1)(A) defines a WTC-related health condition as:\n\nâ[A]n illness or health condition for which exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, based on an examination by a medical professional with experience in treating or diagnosing the health conditions included in the applicable list of WTC-related health conditions, is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health conditionâ¦;â or\n\nâ[A] mental health condition for which such attacks, based on an examination by a medical professional with experience in treating or diagnosing the health conditions included in the applicable list of WTC-related health conditions, is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the conditionâ¦.â\n\nSection 3312(b)(1) states that if a physician at a Clinical Center of Excellence (CCE) makes a determination that a WTC responder has a WTC-related health condition included in the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions (List) and that exposure to airborne toxins, other hazards, or adverse conditions resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the condition, then the physician is to transmit that determination and the medical facts supporting the determination to the WTC Health Program. After review of the CCE physicianâs determination, the WTC Health Program will certify the health condition if he finds that it is on the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions and that exposure to airborne toxins, other hazards, or adverse conditions resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the health condition. The WTC Health Program will pay for medically necessary treatment of certified WTC-related health conditions (see Â§ 3312(c)(1)). In addition, the Administrator must establish a process to appeal certification decisions.\n\nSection 3312(b)(5) authorizes treatment pending certification for responders, and section 3322(a) extends the same benefits to survivors.\n\nSection 3321(a)(2)(B) requires the Administrator of the WTC Health Program to establish a certification process for screening-eligible WTC survivors who are eligible for further monitoring and treatment after their initial screening exam.\n\nThe following provisions in the WTC Health Program regulations in 42 C.F.R. Part 88 are also applicable to this Chapter:\n\nSection 88.1 includes definitions of the following relevant terms: Aggravating, Certification; Health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition; List of WTC-Related Health Conditions; Medically necessary treatment; WTC-related acute traumatic injury; WTC-related health condition; and WTC-related musculoskeletal disorder.\n\nSection 88.15, List of WTC-Related Health Conditions.\n\nSection 88.16, Addition of health conditions to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions.\n\nSection 88.17, Physicianâs determination of WTC-related health conditions.\n\nSection 88.18, Certification.\n\nSection 88.19, Decertification.\n\nSection 88.20, Authorization of treatment.\n\nSection 88.21, Appeal of certification, decertification, or treatment authorization decision.\n\nSection 88.25, Reopening of WTC Health Program final decisions.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\nThe parties involved in certifying health conditions and their responsibilities are detailed below.\n\nThe Clinical Centers of Excellence/Nationwide Provider Network (CCEs)/(NPN) provide monitoring and screening examinations for eligible responders and survivors. The CCE/NPN ensures that requests for certification of a memberâs health condition are completed using the appropriate forms and procedures. The CCE/NPN transmits the completed health condition certification request in a secure manner to the Programâs Health Program Support (HPS) contractor for processing (see Section 6, below for more information regarding secure data transfer). The WTC Health Programâs certification decision is sent to the member and CCE/NPN via letter. Upon receipt of a decision by the Program to certify a health condition, the CCE/NPN is authorized to provide medically necessary treatment to the member for that condition and shall be responsible for providing adequate treatment services or referrals, which will be scheduled by the CCE/NPN.\n\nThe Programâs Medical Benefit Manager (MBM) has been designated by the Administrator to determine whether a health condition meets the requirements for certification. The MBM reviews an official request by the CCE/NPN to certify a memberâs health condition for treatment to be covered by the Program and leads the Certification Team that conducts this function. The MBM consults with the Administrator regarding certifications as necessary.\n\nThe Programâs HPS contractor is responsible for receiving and processing certification requests from the CCE/NPN for the Programâs Certification Team to evaluate. The HPS contractor also receives the Programâs decisions, updates the system of records, and supports the communication process with the CCE/NPN and member.\n\n4. Covered Conditions\n\nThe following WTC-related health conditions covered by the WTC Health Program are established in 42 C.F.R.

Non-invasive neoplasms, including carcinomas in situ, will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The review will include consideration of the treatment recommendations made by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Such reviews will be documented and included in the member file where relevant to a specific cancer certification evaluation.\n\nNon-invasive neoplasms ineligible for certification:\n\nA non-invasive neoplasm that is completely removed surgically during an excisional biopsy or resection of an organ or body part containing the lesion may be curative (i.e., NCCN Guidelines recommend no further treatment). The following carcinomas in situ have been determined to be examples of such types of non-invasive neoplasms and are, therefore, ineligible for certification:\n\nBreast: Lobular carcinoma in situ (CIS) [except pleomorphic lobular CIS]\n\nColon and rectum: CIS [including high grade intraepithelial and intramucosal neoplasia]\n\nGallbladder: CIS\n\nNon-invasive neoplasms of the cervix uteri are ineligible for certification but may be eligible for medical benefits related to surveillance, management, and/or treatment. The following lesions have been determined to be examples of such types of non-invasive neoplasms and are, therefore, ineligible for certification:\n\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN): CIN grade I, CIN grade II, and CIN grade III\n\nCarcinoma in situ of the cervix uteri\n\nHistologically benign neoplasms are ineligible for certification.\n\nLiquid neoplasms\n\nTo qualify as a malignant neoplasm, a liquid neoplasm must:\n\nHave been diagnosed after September 11, 2001 and meet the WTC Health Programâs minimum latency criteria for the specific cancer see Minimum Latency & Types or Categories of Cancer); [12 pages, 517 KB] and\n\nExhibit uncontrolled clonal growth of a specific type of hematopoietic cell.\n\nCancers of Unknown Primary Origin (CUPs)\n\nThese are histologically-proven, metastatic, malignant neoplasms the primary origin of which cannot be identified during pre-treatment evaluation. The date of diagnosis of the metastatic disease will be used to evaluate eligibility for certification of CUPs.\n\nMetastasis or recurrence of a pre-existing malignant neoplasm\n\nFor malignant neoplasms diagnosed before September 11, 2001, and those diagnosed after September 11, 2001 but with insufficient latency, any recurrence or metastasis from such malignant neoplasms will not be considered for certification regardless of the amount of time that passes between remission of the pre-existing neoplasm and its recurrence or metastatic spread. An exhaustive search of the scientific literature has failed to identify evidence that toxic exposures aggravate, cause, or contribute to a pre-existing cancer resulting in a recurrence or metastasis that requires a change in treatment.\n\nSecond primary cancers\n\nA second primary cancer is a histologically-proven, new primary malignant neoplasm developing in a person with a history of cancer. The term applies to malignant neoplasms that have arisen independently and not as a result of recurrence or metastasis of the original primary malignant neoplasm. A second primary cancer is considered eligible for certification if it was diagnosed after September 11, 2001 and meets the WTC Health Programâs minimum latency criteria for the specific cancer. Alleged cases of second primary cancers originating from the same tissue and/or of the same histological type as a malignant neoplasm that is certified, certifiable, or ineligible for certification will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The review will include consideration of the peer-reviewed scientific literature and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules. Such reviews will be documented and included in the member file where relevant to a specific cancer certification evaluation.\n\nSpecial Note on Acute Traumatic Injuries and Musculoskeletal Disorders\n\nAcute Traumatic Injuries\n\nA WTC-related acute traumatic injury (ATI) is physical damage to the body caused by and occurring immediately after a one-time exposure to energy, such as heat, electricity, or impact from a crash or fall, resulting from a specific event or incident. Such health conditions include eye injuries, burns, head trauma, fractures, tendon tears, complex sprains, and other similar acute traumatic injuries.\n\nIn order for an ATI to be certified by the Program, the injury must be directly related to a memberâs 9/11 exposures and activitiesâ¯and must have occurred during one of the following time periods: September 11, 2001 â July 31, 2002 for acute traumatic injuries occurring at one of the New York City Area Sites; September 11, 2001 â November 19, 2001 for acute traumatic injuries occurring at the Pentagon Site; or September 11, 2001 â October 3, 2001 for acute traumatic injuries occurring at the Shanksville, Pennsylvania Site. In addition, the WTC responder or screening-eligible or certified-eligible survivor must have received medical treatment for the acute traumatic injury on or before September 11, 2003.\n\nMusculoskeletal Disorders\n\nA WTC-related musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) is a chronic or recurrent disorder of the musculoskeletal system caused by heavy lifting or repetitive strain on the joints or musculoskeletal system occurring during rescue or recovery efforts in the New York City disaster area in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Such health conditions include low back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), and other musculoskeletal disorders.â¯\n\nIn order for an MSD to be certified by the Program, the injury must be directly related to a memberâs 9/11 exposures and activitiesâ¯and must have occurred during the following time period: September 11, 2001 â July 31, 2002.â¯â¯Theâ¯Zadrogaâ¯Act only allows coverage of MSDs for WTC Responders; therefore, Survivors and Pentagon and Shanksville, PA Responders cannot be certified for an MSD. In addition, the WTC responder must have received medical treatment for a WTC-related musculoskeletal disorder on or before September 11, 2003.\n\nHealth Conditions Medically Associated with WTC-Related Health Conditions\n\nA condition that is medically associated with a WTC-related health condition is also eligible for certification and treatment within the WTC Health Program. In order for a medically associated health condition to be certified, the condition must result from the treatment or progression of a WTC-related health condition. The underlying WTC-related health condition must first be certified by the WTC Health Program before any conditions may be certified as medically associated with the underlying condition. Medically associated conditions are evaluated and certified on a case-by-case basis\n\nThe WTC Health Program requires that the CCE or NPN physician provide a detailed explanation in the WTC-3 Certification Request form (Appendix 3-A), and medical records as appropriate, that the health condition under consideration as medically associated resulted from either treatment or progression of the underlying certified WTC-related health condition. See Health Conditions Medically Associated with World Trade Center-Related Health Conditions. [5 pages, 484 KB]\n\nEstablishing that the Medically Associated Health Condition âResults fromâ Treatment of a Certified WTC-Related Health Condition.\n\nThe WTC Health Program will review the CCE or NPNâs explanation to determine if: (i) the relationship linking the medically associated health condition the WTC-related health condition occurs without the influence of an intermediary health condition or event; and (ii) the linkage between the certified WTC-related health condition and the medically associated health condition resulting from treatment of the certified WTC-related health condition has been well-established by published peer-reviewed scientific literature.\n\nâResults fromâ Treatment. The CCE or NPN physician must demonstrate by means of a detailed narrative (including medical records when appropriate) that the health condition âresults fromâ medical treatment of the underlying certified WTC-related health condition without the influence of an intermediary health condition or event. The WTC Health Program will certify as medically associated only those conditions which directly result from treatment of a WTC-related health condition, i.e., that the medically associated condition occurred in absence of intervening medical events.\n\nNote: CCE and NPN physicians are encouraged to consult with the Director, WTC Health Program Medical Benefits, about medically associated health conditions that result from treatment of a certified WTC-related health condition as certification will depend on the particular medical facts of each case.\n\nPreviously Published in Peer-Reviewed Literature. The CCE or NPN physician must demonstrate that the medical association between the underlying [certified WTC-related] health condition and the medically associated health condition resulting from treatment of the underlying [certified WTC-related] health condition has been established in previously published peer-reviewed medical literature. The establishment of this medical association in the literature must be documented in the member file, whether included as part of the physicianâs narrative or otherwise captured by Program staff.\n\nEstablishing that the Medically Associated Health Condition âResults fromâ Progression of a Certified WTC-Related Health Condition.\n\nThe WTC Health Program will review the CCE or NPN physicianâs explanation to determine if: (i) the relationship linking the medically associated condition with the WTC-related health condition occurs without the influence of an intermediary health condition or event; and (ii) the linkage between the certified WTC-related health condition and the medically associated condition resulting from progression of the certified WTC-related health condition has been well-established in published, peer-reviewed scientific literature.\n\nâResult fromâ Progression. The CCE or NPN physician must demonstrate by means of a detailed narrative (including medical records when appropriate) that the health condition âresults fromâ progression of the underlying certified WTC-related health condition without the influence of an intermediary health condition or event.\n\nNote: CCE and NPN physicians are encouraged to consult with the Director, WTC Health Program Medical Benefits, about medically associated health conditions that are the result of progression of a certified WTC-related health condition as certification will depend on the particular medical facts of each case.\n\nPreviously Published in Peer-Reviewed Literature. The CCE or NPN physician must demonstrate that the medical association between the underlying [certified WTC-related] health condition and the medically associated health condition resulting from progression of the underlying [certified WTC-related] health condition has been established in previously published peer-reviewed medical literature. The establishment of this medical association in the literature must be documented in the member file, whether included as part of the physicianâs narrative or otherwise captured by Program staff.\n\n5. CCE/NPN Physician Determination and Request for Certification of Health Conditions\n\nWhen a member is diagnosed with a health condition that the provider believes is related to a 9/11 exposure, the member may be eligible for medical treatment for that condition under the Program.\n\nCCE/NPN Physician Determination\n\nIf, following an initial health evaluation or monitoring or treatment exam, the treating CCE or NPN physician determines that the member has a health condition which is a qualifying condition covered by the Program, as described in Section 4, and that memberâs exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition or mental health condition, then the physician must submit this determination to the Program and request certification of the health condition in order to provide treatment under the Program.\n\nSecondary Review of Negative Physician Determination\n\nWhere a memberâs CCE/NPN makes a negative determination (a finding that exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, is not substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the health condition or mental health condition) and declines to request certification of the health condition by the WTC Health Program, the member may request a secondary review of this decision by writing the Clinical Director of the CCE or NPN. However, a request for a secondary medical review for a health condition that does not meet WTC Health Program policy is not permitted. Disagreement with Program policy is not a valid reason for secondary review. The procedure for a secondary review is as follows:\n\nThe member is informed by the CCE/NPN of the decision to not request certification in a timely manner and is informed of his/her right to obtain secondary review; this should occur ideally through a Clinic visit.\n\nIf the member disagrees with the decision to not request certification, s/he shall be given counsel regarding the secondary review process and provided a brochure detailing his/her rights in terms of obtaining a secondary review. To initiate the secondary review process, the member must send a letter to the CCE/NPN Clinical Director, or designee, which clearly indicates his/her request to obtain secondary medical review.\n\nThe CCE/NPN Clinical Director or designee then performs a review of the case. This designee can be a CCE physician at another CCE.\n\nIf the secondary review upholds the original decision to not request certification, then the CCE /NPN Clinical Director must send a written letter to the member (within 4 weeks) which summarizes the decision and provides an explanation of how this decision was made. A copy of this letter should be sent to the Administrator of the WTC Health Program.\n\nIf the secondary review finds that WTC-relatedness is supported, the CCE/NPN Clinical Director must send a written letter to the member informing him/her of this decision. This letter should state that a WTC-3 request for certification will now be sent to the WTC Health Program, with an attestation coming from the physician who performed the secondary review.\n\nThe CCE/NPN shall track all secondary review decisions and may make recommendations to the Administrator of the WTC Health Program, as appropriate, when such decisions point to a need for an evaluation or change to Program policies and procedures.\n\nCCE/NPN Requests Certification from the Program Using the WTC-3 Form\n\nThe WTC-3 Certification Package is the standard documentation completed by a CCE/NPN physician to request certification for a memberâs health condition; it provides the medical rationale linking the exposure to the stated health condition. A sample of the form is provided in Appendix 3-A. This form must be used for any condition which a physician has determined to be WTC-related since the Program CCE contracts were implemented [i.e., as of July 1, 2011 for enrolled responders; as of September 29, 2011 for enrolled survivors; and as of October, 2013 for enrolled members assigned to the Nationwide Provider Network (NPN)]. The Clinical Director of the CCE or the NPN reviews, approves and securely submits the completed WTC-3 Certification Package signed by the examining or responsible physician to the Program. Such forms are also used to request certification of health conditions as medically associated with a WTC-related health condition.\n\nThe WTC-3 Certification Package contains identifying information for the member and examiner, diagnostic codes for the condition(s) for which the member is requesting certification, and either a medical rationale linking 9/11 exposure to the health condition or the medical rationale linking the medically associated health condition to an existing WTC-related health condition. For a health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition, the physicianâs determination shall contain information on how the health condition has resulted from treatment of a previously certified WTC-related health condition, or how it has resulted from progression of the certified WTC-related health condition. All cancer certification requests require a pathology report to be submitted with the WTC-3 Certification Package. Specific guidance regarding how to complete the WTC-3 Certification Package, including reasonable practice examples using Program-approved templates, is provided below.\n\nWhen providing a rationale for the certification, requesters use an explanatory narrative that may be combined with Program-approved template within the WTC-3 form. The rationale should contain pertinent information about 9/11 exposure and time-linked emergence of symptoms. Facts available from the standardized monitoring or screening examination, including exposure assessment, presenting symptoms and temporal relationship of these symptoms relative to 9/11 exposure, should be included. Medical findings should be documented in the institutional medical record, which include the screening or monitoring exams and any additional medical testing or imaging studies required to establish the diagnosis. By procedure, the memberâs institutional medical record is incorporated by reference when the CCE provider or NPN Clinical Director requests certification using the WTC-3 Certification Package. This process provides the Program with all relevant information required to make an informed decision regarding the memberâs certification. See Appendix 3-B for instructions specific to completing the WTC-3 form for cancer.\n\nThe WTC-3 submission must include a signed affirmative statement by the physician that the memberâs exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition or mental health condition. If the physician is unable to make such and affirmative finding, then the WTC-3 cannot be submitted or considered.\n\nPrevious Program Members Certified Using WTC-2 Batch Process\n\nThe WTC-2 batch certification process was used for a subset of program members who had treatment initiated for qualifying conditions as part of the previous federally-sponsored programs (the Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) for responders and/or the Environmental Health Clinic (EHC) for community members). This process was implemented to ensure treatment continuity for members already receiving care under predecessor programs and is no longer being used.\n\nIf the certifications for qualified conditions were supported by documentation in the membersâ medical records, the Clinical Director of the CCE or the NPN submitted an attestation for all members and their associated conditions via electronic spreadsheet. The spreadsheet contained identifying member information and diagnostic codes for each qualifying WTC-related or medically associated condition that required certification. The CCE/NPN then transmitted the WTC-2 batch certification request to the Program in a secure manner (as described in Section 6, below). The Program verified the requested conditions against the Codebook (described further in Section 9, below) and returned any discrepant data to the submitter for rectification. Periodic summary reports of certified conditions by member were then sent to the CCE/NPN by the HPS contractor.\n\nThe CCE/NPN is responsible for maintaining a record of a memberâs certifications to enable appropriate service authorization decisions. As part of their Quality Assurance Program the CCE/NPN conducts internal audits of their contracted part of the WTC Health Program at a minimum of every quarter. These data are made available to the Administrator of the WTC Health Program or designee. Where data is obtained, through a quality assurance audit or otherwise, that indicates that the certification issued through the WTC-2 process was incorrect, the Administrator of the WTC Health Program may de-certify a condition as appropriate.\n\n6. Overview of the Certification Process\n\nCertification is the lynchpin by which the Program ensures members receive appropriate services and that all services are provided in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements. A CCE/NPN is responsible for submitting requests for health condition certification using the WTC-3 form. The WTC Health Program then reviews and evaluates the request (WTC-3) and makes one of three possible decisions for each health condition contained within the request:\n\nThe health condition is certified, enabling the member to receive treatment for the certified health condition;\n\nThe health condition is denied certification, which gives the member the right to request an appeal of the denial decision; or\n\nThe request is suspended and categorized by the WTC Health Program as a âre-doâ pending receipt of additional information about the request from the CCE or NPN physician submitting the request.\n\nThe certification process begins when the CCE/NPN examines the member and makes a determination regarding whether the member has an illness which is covered in the WTC Health Program and that the memberâs 9/11 exposure is related to his or her illness.\n\nThe CCE/NPN completes and submits the WTC-3 package (including supporting documents) to the Program in one of three ways:\n\nBy mail to the WTC Health Program mailroom;\n\nBy fax to the secure WTC Health Program fax number; or\n\nBy placing a PDF version of the WTC-3 package on the Programâs secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) server.\n\nFor paper and fax submissions, the mailroom scans the package, assigns a document control number (DCN), uploads the scanned document to the SFTP server for the HPS Member Services Team (MST) to access, and notifies the MST that certification requests are available for review. In this way, the MST accesses all submitted packages from one consolidated location â the SFTP server.\n\nThe MST reviews the submitted WTC-3 package to determine whether it is complete and can be processed. A WTC-3 package is considered to be complete if:\n\nThe WTC-3 form is legible and fully filled out;\n\nA supporting narrative/assessment is provided;\n\nThe WTC-3 form is signed and dated by the memberâs health provider and includes the required physician determination and attestation that the memberâs exposure to airborne toxins, any other hazard, or any other adverse condition resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition or mental health condition; and\n\nThe member for whom certification is being requested is enrolled as a member in the Program.\n\nIf the CCE/NPN request for certification is found to be incomplete, the request will be categorized as a âre-doâ (neither certified nor denied), and held in a suspended status until specific facts are either supplied (when missing) or clarified (when too vague or misleading) by the CCE or NPN submitting the request for certification. As a result of the request for certification being suspended, the member is not eligible to receive medical or pharmacy benefits for the health condition subject to request for certification (see section below regarding the request for a time-limited authorization of treatment pending certification). If a certification is made via a follow up submission, the effective date of the certification will always be assigned as the signature date of the original submission.\n\nIf the MST determines that the WTC-3 package is complete and the member is properly enrolled, the package is forwarded to the NIOSH MBM for review and approval. Certifications are forwarded to the MBM on a weekly basis.\n\nThe NIOSH MBM reviews the certification requests and makes determinations to approve or deny the certification or to request a âredo,â when necessary (e.g., due to missing information). The MBM also determines the effective date for medical benefits, and notifies the MST of the decisions.\n\nUpon approval by the MBM, the MST updates the claims processing system, assigns benefit plans as appropriate, and notifies the CCE/NPN of the decisions.\n\n7. Authorization of Treatment Pending Certification\n\nAuthorization of Treatment Pending Certification is permitted pursuant to Sections 3312(b)(5) (responders) and 3322(a) (survivors) of the PHS Act and 42 C.F.R. Â§ 88.20(c). Treatment pending certification is offered, where specifically requested by a CCE/NPN physician, in order to provide timely institution of therapy or continuity of care while a certification request is being reviewed.\n\nIn the past, the WTC-1 Form was used to request this authorization as a means of providing âcontinuity of careâ for the subgroup of members receiving treatment in the previous federally sponsored programs (MMTP and EHC) until the new certification process was implemented. This process expired in November 2011, and the form was retired.\n\nUnder the current WTC-3 certification process, while certification is pending, authorization for time-limited treatment of a WTC-related health condition or a health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition may be requested at the CCE/NPN physicianâs discretion through the WTC-3 Form. Such authorization must be obtained from the WTC Health Program before treatment is provided, except for the provision of treatment for a medical emergency.\n\nTreatment rendered after WTC-3 submission but prior to certification will only be covered if the request for treatment pending certification was included in the WTC-3 submittal, the care delivered does not require a Level 3 Prior Authorization, the request for certification is ultimately granted, the treatment provided is medically necessary and follows Program guidelines, and the care is rendered by a CCE/NPN-affiliated provider. In the event that the condition is denied certification, any care provided for the condition that is outside the parameters of the Diagnostic Plan will not be covered and the CCE or NPN providing the care will be responsible for the costs of such care.\n\nIf the certification request is determined to be unsatisfactory, then the authorization for treatment pending certification is discontinued immediately and related claims are pended for up to three weeks, during which time the CCE or NPN will work with the MST to rectify any deficiencies in the request, if possible. After 3 weeks, unsatisfactory certification requests will convert to a denial of certification and appropriate Program actions (see Sections 8 and 10, below).\n\n8. Certification Decisions\n\nPotential Outcomes Following a Request for Certification\n\nA CCE or NPN physician is responsible for submitting requests for certification of a health condition using the WTC-3 form. The WTC Health Program then reviews and evaluates the request (WTC-3) and makes one of the three following decisions for each health condition contained within the request:\n\nThe memberâs health condition is certified, enabling the member to receive treatment for the certified health condition;\n\nThe memberâs health condition is denied certification, which gives the member the right to request an appeal of the denial decision; or\n\nThe request for certification is âsuspendedâ pending receipt of additional or clarifying information regarding the certification request submitted by the CCE or NPN.\n\nCommunicating Certification Request Outcomes to Members\n\nThe Program makes every effort to make informed decisions regarding WTC-related health condition certifications in a timely manner and to communicate those decisions to the member efficiently. For certification requests of health conditions medically associated with a WTC-related health condition, the Program will render a decision and notify the member in writing of the decision and the reason for the decision within 60 calendar days after the date the physicianâs determination was received. To that end, the Program has developed decision letters addressing the range of decisions that could be made in the certification process (e.g., approval or denial of certification request, the need for additional information to inform the certification decision, etc.). When a memberâs health condition is approved for certification as either a WTC-related health condition or a medically associated health condition, the Program sends the member a letter informing him/her of the certification and provides electronic notification to the CCE/NPN that requested the certification. When a memberâs requested health condition is denied certification, the Program sends the member letter informing him/her of the denial and provides an electronic copy of the letter to the requesting CCE/NPN. The denial letter discusses the condition requested, the reason for the denial, and the information submitted to the Program for review from the CCE or NPN. The letter also answers frequently asked questions and provides instructions about how appeal the denial decision.\n\nSuspended Requests for Certification\n\nA suspended request for certification is neither certified nor denied, but has been placed in an administratively pended status until specific facts are either supplied (when missing) or clarified (when too vague or misleading) by the CCE or NPN submitting the request for certification.\n\nTime to Provide Information to Resolve a Suspended Request for Certification\n\nThe WTC Health Program will notify the CCE or NPN that submitted the request for certification when more information is required to complete processing of the request for certification. This notification will be made in writing by electronic message (via secure portal). The CCE or NPN has 60 days from the date of the written notification from the WTC Health Program to provide the Program with the requested additional information. The WTC Health Program will provide weekly updates to each CCE or NPN regarding any outstanding requests for certification that have been suspended pending additional information and the number of days that have elapsed since the notification and request for additional information for each case was sent to the CCE or NPN.\n\nEffect of Suspended Request for Certification on Authorization of Treatment Pending Certification\n\nAs a result of the request for certification being suspended, the WTC Health Program member is generally not eligible to receive medical or pharmacy benefits for the health condition subject to request for certification. However, if the original submission requesting certification of a given condition included a time-limited authorization of treatment pending certification, the requesting CCE or NPN may choose to continue providing benefits to the member at their own expense. In the event that the suspended request for certification is subsequently approved through timely rectification of the record, reimbursement of treatment services will be permitted with an effective date of the signature date of the original WTC-3 submission. In the event that the condition is denied certification, any care provided outside the parameters of the Diagnostic Plan will not be covered and the CCE or NPN providing the care will be responsible for the costs of such care. If the concerns resulting in the suspended request are not resolved after 60 days as outlined above, then any authorization for treatment pending certification is terminated and the member is notified as per protocol.\n\nResolution of a Suspended Request for Certification\n\nThere are five potential outcomes for a request for certification that has been placed in a suspended status; those outcomes are as follows:\n\nCertification After Receipt of Additional Information from the CCE or NPN\n\nThe CCE or NPN responds to the notification of a suspended request for certification with additional or clarifying information. Based on this information, the Program is able to certify the health condition.\n\nDenial of Certification After Receipt of Additional Information from the CCE or NPN\n\nThe CCE or NPN responds to the notification of a suspended request for certification with additional or clarifying information. This additional information does not satisfy the requirements for certification, however, and results in a denial of certification for the health condition. The member has the right to appeal the denial decision.\n\nAdministrative Closure Following a Request by the CCE or NPN to Withdraw the Certification Request\n\nThe CCE or NPN responds to the notification of a suspended request for certification by indicating in writing that they would like to withdraw the original request for certification. If a withdrawal is requested, the WTC Health Program will no longer evaluate the request for certification and will administratively close the request file. Reasons for withdrawal may include the CCE/NPN determining that the requested information cannot be supplied in a timely manner or newly recognizing that the request for certification cannot be supported based on established WTC Health Program criteria. The CCE/NPN will inform the member of the withdrawal of the request for certification, and advise the member of their right to a secondary review.\n\nDenial of Certification Following an Insufficient Response from the CCE or NPN After Request for Additional Information\n\nIf the CCE or NPN responds to the WTC Health Programâs notification of suspended request for certification but is unable to provide the requested information necessary to resolve the suspended certification request within the 60 day time limit allowed for final resolution of the request, then the WTC Health Program will take the following actions. The WTC Health Program will send a written communication to the CCE/NPN (via electronic message) asking for confirmation that they cannot provide additional information but that they still wish to request certification for the health condition. If the CCE/NPN responds in writing (via electronic message) that this is the case, then the WTC Health Program will deny the request for certification of the health condition due to lack of sufficient information to make a definitive evaluation of the link between 9/11 exposure and the requested health condition or between the WTC-related health condition and the requested medically associated health condition. The WTC Health Program will inform the member of the denial and his or her right to request an appeal of the denial decision.\n\nAdministrative Closure Following No Response from the CCE or NPN After Request for Additional Information\n\nIf the CCE or NPN does not respond at all to the notification of a suspended request for certification within the 60 day time limit allowed for final resolution of the request, then the WTC Health Program will administratively close the request for certification of the health condition due to lack of sufficient information to support a physicianâs determination (upon which a certification decision could be based). Similarly, if the WTC Health Program asks the CCE/NPN for a confirmation that they cannot provide additional information but that they still wish to request certification for the health condition (as outlined above) and the response from the CCE/NPN is unclear or equivocal as to the intent to request certification, then the WTC Health Program will administratively close the request for certification of the health condition due to lack of sufficient information to support the physicianâs determination. In either case, the WTC Health Program will notify the CCE or NPN in writing via electronic message that the request for certification has been administratively closed. The CCE/NPN will inform the member of the administrative closure of the request for certification, and advise the member of his or her right to a secondary review. The CCE/NPN may submit a new WTC-3 at a later date should additional or clarifying information becomes available.\n\nCertification of Deceased Members\n\nThe WTC Health Program does not certify health conditions for deceased members. The WTC Health Program may cover medically necessary treatment for certified health conditions from the effective date of the certification (or from the effective date of the certification request in cases of appropriately requested treatment pending certification). The WTC Health Program will not review certification requests dated after a "
