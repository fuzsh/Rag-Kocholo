        "text": "It may be hard to believe, but FÃºchila Fresheners was a hustle of the heart born out of pain and burnout. I was on the verge of quitting my 6-figure job at Apple and needed a creative outlet to feel inspired again. To feel alive again! At the time, I knew that if this side-hustle-to-be was to become anything worth putting out into the world, it had to be an extension of me: built for and by the community, grounded in cultura, and dripping nostalgia.\n\nThen it came to me. Sitting on the toilet, \"my office,\" of all places. Actually quite appropriate for me as I have a thing for bathrooms. Or maybe it was ironic considering the idea: an air freshener company called âFÃºchila Freshenersâ (\"FÃºchila\" is Mexican slang for âsmellyâ)? Whatever the case, the name was too perfect â nostalgic, culturally nuance and an alliteration! I knew I could bring a different sort of swag to the air freshener game. As far as I was concerned, it was my responsibility to see this through.\n\nBut, I still had to quit my job at Apple. It as a tough decision to leave because, as a child-of-immigrants, it was my dream to work at a place like like this. \"What do you mean you quit!?\" my parents asked, not understanding how I wasn't head-down counting the days to retirement as an Apple employee. I knew they had worked too hard to have me not love my job. Now I see, it shouldn't have been my dream to work at a place like Apple, but to have the choice and opportunity to quit from a place like Apple.\n\nThe journey isn't over by any means. Iâm now an Art Director and Visual Designer at Google and run FÃºchila Fresheners as my side hustle. So, this is not quite a retrospective, but it does deserve a trip down memory lane. From raising over $3,500 on Kickstarter before a single product even existed to driving across the country with a trunk full of air fresheners selling FÃºchila state to state. From seeing pictures of folks repping FÃºchila in Puerto Rico, Australia, and even Japan to making it onto Netflix and being sued by one of your childhood idolâs father during a global pandemic.\n\nI invite you to peruse the stories, notes to self, pictures and videos of my journey to date. Gracias to my parents. Gracias a Dios.\n\nS E P T E M B E R â¢ 2 0 1 4\n\n\"Yes! An air freshener company called 'fÃºchila'!\" I laughed to myself sitting on the toilet during a carne asada at my Tia's house. I had just quit my job at Apple and was looking for a creative outlet to call my own. A way to feel inspired again.\n\nIts use and context is varied, but \"fÃºchila\" or \"fuchi\" is Mexican slang for \"smelly\" or \"gross\" and is a nostalgic word associated with family life.\n\nI ran out to announce to everyone, \"I've got it! What if I started an air freshener company called 'FÃºchila Fresheners'!?\" Immediately their heads turned and laughter ensued (the good kind ð)! I shared my vision of a clever, culturally nuanced brand rooted in nostalgia and to my surprise, they were actually about it! We brainstormed for a while and had some good laughs. It was hella life giving.\n\nI left that carne asada with some left overs and the creative energy I needed to pursue my crazy, new dream.\n\nO C T O B E R â¢ 2 0 1 4\n\nI led with my gut. I had to build a community around the brand before launching any products. At the time, crowd-funding was on the rise and thought that I could kill hella birds with one Kickstarter stone. It would serve two major purposes (1) Build the community around the brand that it needed to launch successfully, and (2) raise the funds I needed to produce the first round of products.\n\n1. Build Community\n\nI knew any brand that I launched had to be based in community. It had to be rooted in an understanding that we must think and serve outside of ourselves. Interdependence, not independence. This introspection helped me define FÃºchila's core pillars: Craft. Cultura. Comunidad. (More on those later). Little did I know I was planting the seed for what has become an international #fuchilafamilia.\n\n2. Raise Funds\n\nOn the tactical side, if I had any chance of raising $2,500 to launch my business, I had to make people believe. I knew the designs, mocks, and pitch video were going to do the heavy lifting. I got to work. I designed my logo, the original six freshener designs, and the merch for the different levels of funders. I also shot a short video introducing the brand and campaign. I followed up with consistent updates via Kickstarter and our newly launched Facebook and Instagram channels.\n\nFinally, I was ready to launch my campaign.\n\nD E C E M B E R 2 5, 2 0 1 4\n\nI'll never forget Christmas Day, 2014.\n\nWe had committed to our 60+ backers and supporters that we'd have their product in hand by Christmas Day. And we weren't playin' about that promise. The shipping team, aka my wife and I, prepped all the boxes in advance, which we sourced for free from USPS, spreading the production line across the entire living room and kitchen. We added the t-shirts, stickers, and hand-written thank you notes for all the backers according to their donation level.\n\nDue to the typical production delays, we received our first run, 10 boxes worth of product, on the morning of December 25th (about 2 weeks later than expected) at our 1 bedroom apartment and newly minted \"FÃºchila Headquarters\" in San JosÃ©, CA. With the product now in hand, we stuffed the boxes full of fresheners and set off on a Christmas Day mission to hand-deliver fresheners to all our backers from Mountain View to San JosÃ©.\n\nOf course we couldnât provide this white glove service to all our backers. We ended the evening stopping by USPS before closing time to ship out the orders from across the rest of the state and country.\n\nLittle did we know, this was the beginning of a journey that would take us across the country and back building an international community, a #fuchilafamilia, of over 50k.\n\nAs for the launch party, my vision was to bring friends and family together, meet local backers, introduce FÃºchila to my home town, push product, raise money for a youth scholarship, and celebrate the journey we were about to embark on â to bring the virtual community to life IRL.\n\nI tapped into my network of Chicano compadres to make this dream come true. From Damian Trujillo, my fraternity brother and reporter/anchor at NBC Bay Area, Jorge Sanchez, owner of Chachoâs Restaurant, a bright, Chicano eatery and staple of Down Town San JosÃ©, Chuy Gomez, a local legend, radio host and Bay Area DJ, Fransisco Franco, a homie and classically trained painter, and finally, DJ Too Tall (he's almost 7ft) a friend and DJ at every one of my functions since college.\n\nDamian brought me onto his morning show on NBC Bay Area, Comunidad del Valle to allow me to share FÃºchila's story with the community.\n\nJorge allowed me to use as much of his restaurant for my launch party as I needed and didn't charge me a penny. In fact, he paid for the production of the red FÃºchila shirts for his entire staff to wear that night.\n\nChuy shouted FÃºchila out on his radio station and IG, came through to celebrate and showed me some love on mic that night.\n\nFranco came to the party to do some live painting, refused to charge me, and donated a few of his prints so that we could raise more money for our aspiring youth creative scholarship.\n\nToo Tall kept his jockey of discs service charge at an all-time low and brought the heat all night.\n\nWe made almost $1000 in sales and raised close to $500 for our first youth scholarship that night.\n\n\"built for and by the community, grounded in cultura, and dripping in nostalgia\""
