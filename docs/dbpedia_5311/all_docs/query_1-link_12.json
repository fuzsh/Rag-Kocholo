        "text": "Section 2.1 prohibits the\n\ndiscrimination or vilification\n\nof any individual or group\n\nof people on the basis of\n\ncertain defined attributes.\n\n‘Discrimination’ and ‘Vilification’ are defined as:\n\nDiscrimination\n\nunfair or less favourable treatment\n\nVilification\n\nHumiliates, intimidates, incites hatred, contempt or ridicule\n\nThe defined attributes are:\n\nRACE – viewed broadly this term includes colour, descent or ancestry, ethnicity, nationality, and includes, for example, ideas of ethnicity covering people of Jewish or Muslim origin\n\nETHNICITY – those with a common social identity as a result of\n\ncustoms, traditions or belief about historical origins\n\nNATIONALITY – people belonging to a particular nation either by\n\nbirth, origin or naturalisation. This can change over time so, for example, a person born in the United States who becomes a citizen of Australia by marriage may describe their nationality\n\nas either/both Australian or/and American\n\nGENDER – refer to the attributes, roles, behaviours, activities,\n\nopportunities or restrictions that society considers appropriate for girls or boys, women or men. Gender is distinct from ‘sex’, which refers to biological differences\n\nAGE – based on a person’s actual age (i.e. from the date they were\n\nborn) and not a person’s biological age (i.e. how old they may appear)\n\nSEXUAL ORIENTATION – means a person’s sexual orientation towards:\n\npersons of the same sex;\n\npersons of a different sex; or\n\npersons of the same sex and persons of a different sex\n\nRELIGION – a belief or non-belief in a faith or system of worship\n\nDISABILITY – a current, past or potential physical, intellectual,\n\npsychiatric, or sensory illness, disease, disorder, malfunction, malformation, disfigurement or impairment, including mental illness\n\nPOLITICAL BELIEF – support for or opposition to a particular political party or ideology\n\nAdvertising which shows members of a certain group as ridiculous, unintelligible or unable to recognise a dangerous situation incites ridicule towards their behaviour.\n\nAdvertising which compares members of a specific group to animals or objects will be seen as degrading and vilifying.\n\nHUMOUR\n\nA negative depiction of a group of people in society may be found to breach Section 2.1, even if humour\n\nis used. The depiction will be regarded as a breach if a negative impression is created by the imagery\n\nand language used in the advertisement of a person or group of people on the basis of a defined\n\nattribute listed above. Advertisements can humorously or satirically suggest stereotypical aspects of\n\na group of people in society provided the overall impression of the advertisement does not convey a\n\nnegative impression of people of that group on the basis of one or more of the attributes listed above.\n\nDISABILITY\n\nA realistic depiction of people with a disability can be acceptable, even if the advertisement may be\n\nupsetting to some members of the community, where there is an important message being delivered.\n\nGENDER STEREOTYPES\n\nHarmful gender stereotypes are unacceptable because they perpetuate unconscious bias and rigid norms of femininity and masculinity that shape what it means to be a girl, woman, boy or man.\n\nAdvertisements should take care to avoid suggesting that skills, interests, roles or characteristics are:\n\nalways uniquely associated with one gender (eg. family members creating a mess while a woman has sole responsibility for cleaning it up);\n\nthe only options available to one gender;\n\nor\n\nnever carried out or displayed by another gender,\n\nas this may amount to discrimination on the basis of gender.This includes, but is not limited to advertisements that:\n\nmock people for not conforming to gender stereotypes;\n\nportray an activity or product as being inappropriate for a girl or boy because it is stereotypically associated with another gender; or\n\nportray one sex failing at a task that is stereotypically associated another gender (eg. a man trying and failing to undertake simple parental or household tasks).\n\nPortraying a person as attractive does not, in and of itself, constitute discrimination or vilification. However, ads should be sensitive to the emotional and physical well-being of vulnerable groups of people who may be under pressure to conform to particular gender stereotypes. For example, an ad aimed at new mums which suggests that looking attractive or keeping a home pristine is a priority over other factors such as their emotional wellbeing.\n\nIn relation to ads featuring or aimed at children, ads can be targeted at and feature a specific gender but should take care not to explicitly convey that a particular children’s product, pursuit, activity, including choice of play or\n\ncareer, is uniquely suited to one gender or inappropriate for one or another gender. Explicit labelling of children that contrasts stereotypical characteristics in a way that reinforces perceptions of what children can or cannot\n\nbe, because of their gender, is more likely to be problematic.\n\nAdvertising which highlights the causes of violence against women, does not suggest that all men are violent towards women or that men cannot be victims of domestic violence.\n\nAdvertisements for services or activities only available to one gender are legally able to be advertised and highlighting this key feature in advertising does not amount to discrimination or vilification.\n\nNothing in this rule is intended to prevent ads from featuring:\n\none gender only;\n\nproducts designed or made for one gender featuring only that gender (eg tampons, breastfeeding products);\n\ngender stereotypes as a means to challenge their negative effects.\n\nSection 2.2 prohibits the use of sexual appeal in advertising which is exploitative of or degrading to any individual or group of people. ‘Exploitive’ and ‘degrading’ are defined as:\n\nExploitative\n\n(a) taking advantage of the sexual appeal of a person, or group of people, by depicting them as objects or commodities;\n\nor\n\n(b) focusing on their body parts where this bears no direct relevance to the product or service being\n\nadvertised.\n\nDegrading\n\nLowering in character or quality a person or group of persons\n\nTreating humans as sexual objects or commodities for sale perpetuates the harmful view that people, particularly women and girls, are evaluated based on their appearance and risks the premature sexualization of children.\n\nSection 2.2 applies to all genders, with distinct criteria when it comes to the portrayal of minors.\n\nIn advertisements where minors, or people who appear to be minors, are used, sexual appeal is harmful, not acceptable and will always be regarded as exploitative or degrading. Advertisements must not include sexual imagery, state or imply that minors, or people who appear to be minors, are sexual beings or that ownership or\n\nenjoyment of the advertised product will enhance their sexuality. Minors, or people who appear to be minors, must not be portrayed in a manner which treats them as objects of sexual appeal. Advertising featuring someone who appears to be a minor in a pose which indicates they are trying to appear alluring has been\n\nfound to breach this section of the Code.\n\nFor material to breach this section of the Code, it must contain sexual appeal.\n\nModels in underwear or lingerie surrounded by or next to fully clothed models may suggest a power imbalance and be found to be exploitative or degrading.\n\nMaterial can be found to be exploitative or degrading even where the model is looking confident where the model is being depicted as a product or commodity or the focus on body parts is not relevant to the product or service being advertised. Advertising which used sexual appeal and suggests that a person is a product, or that they\n\nexist only for the enjoyment of others has been found to breach this section of the Code. Likewise, advertising which uses attractive models in revealing clothing, where the use of the model is not relevant to the product, has been found to be exploitative.\n\n‘Focusing on body parts’ can include a close-up, multiple close-ups or long-still on breasts or buttocks or cropping in such a way as to emphasise these body parts. Such focus on body parts is not acceptable unless used to advertise relevant products and services.\n\nThe Community Panel may have regard to the context or medium in which the material appears.\n\nSection 2.3 prohibits the use of violent content unless it is justifiable in the context of the product or service advertised.\n\nAlthough the depiction of violence in an advertisement may be relevant to the story being told in the advertisement, any violence must also be justifiable in the context of the product being advertised, or else will be in breach of this section of the Code.\n\nAny advertising message that can be interpreted as condoning or encouraging suicide is not justifiable in the context of any product advertised. Likewise, sexual violence is not acceptable under any circumstances.\n\nThe results or consequences of violence (e.g. a black eye) and audio representations of violence may also be prohibited. However, graphic depictions of violence or the consequences of violence may be justified by the community safety message involved.\n\nViolence against animals is caught by this section. However graphic depictions of violence against animals or the effects of such violence may be justified by the community message involved.\n\nIn considering whether the violence or menace depicted in an advertisement is justifiable, the Community Panel may have regard to the audience of the advertisement. Graphic depictions of violence or a strong suggestion of menace have been found to present violence in an unacceptable manner especially when visible to a broad audience which includes children. For example, advertising for violent or horror movies, tv shows or video games should take care not to include images that give the impression that a character has just committed violence against someone (for example, a weapon with dripping blood), was the victim of violence (for example, freshly severed limbs) or is about to commit violence against someone (for example, gun aimed directly at a person or\n\nthe viewer) where there is a broad audience which includes children.\n\nMore leeway is permitted where the depiction is stylised rather than realistic. However, advertisers should exercise caution when using cartoon violence as a cartoon style may be attractive to children.\n\nSection 2.4 prohibits the harmful use of sex, sexuality or nudity in advertising and requires that such content must be appropriate for the relevant audience. Images that are considered harmful and which are not permitted are those which are overtly sexual and inappropriate having regard to the relevant audience.\n\nThis section applies equally to images of men as well as images of women and children.\n\nSex\n\nSexual intercourse; person or persons engaged in sexually stimulating behaviour.\n\nSexuality\n\nthe capacity to experience and express sexual desire; the recognition or emphasis of sexual matters.\n\nNudity\n\nThe depiction of a person without clothing or covering; partial or suggested nudity may also be considered nudity.\n\nSensitivity\n\nUnderstanding and awareness to the needs and emotions of others.\n\nOvertly sexual depictions where the depiction is not relevant to the product or service being advertised are likely to offend Prevailing Community Standards and be unacceptable.\n\nFull frontal nudity and explicit pornographic language are not permitted. Images of genitalia are not acceptable. Images of nipples may be acceptable in advertisements for plastic surgery or art exhibits for example.\n\nOvertly sexual images are not appropriate in outdoor advertising or shop front windows.\n\nAlthough not exhaustive, the following may be considered to be overtly sexual:\n\nPoses suggestive of sexual position: parting of legs, hand placed on or near genitals in a manner which draws attention to the region;\n\nPeople depicted in sheer lingerie or clothing where a large amount of buttocks, female breasts, pubic mound or genital regions can be seen; The use of paraphernalia such as whips and handcuffs, particularly in combination with images of people in lingerie, undressed or in poses suggestive of sexual position;\n\nSuggestive undressing, such as pulling down a bra strap or underpants; or\n\nInteraction between two or more people which is highly suggestive of sexualised activity.\n\nDiscreet portrayal of nudity and sexuality in an appropriate context (eg advertisements for toiletries and underwear) is generally permitted but note the application of the relevant audience. More care should be taken in outdoor media than magazines, for example.\n\nImages of models in bikinis or underwear are permitted, however, unacceptable images could include those where a model is in a suggestively sexual pose, where underwear is being pulled up or down\n\n(by the model or another person), or where there is clear sexual innuendo from the ad (e.g. depicting women as sexual objects).\n\nModels who appear to be minors should not be used in sexual poses.\n\nThe use of the word “sex” does not, of itself, make an advertisement unacceptable. However, such advertisements must not contain images that are overtly sexual and inappropriate having regard to the relevant audience.\n\nImages of naked couples embracing when viewed in a public space, has been found to be inappropriate and to not treat the issue of sex, sexuality and nudity with sensitivity to the relevant broad audience.\n\nSexualised images which include elements which would be attractive to children, such as cartoons or depictions of Santa, when in a medium which can be seen by children have been found to not treat the issue of sex, sexuality and nudity with sensitivity to the relevant broad audience.\n\nImages of naked people when viewed in a public space, where the nudity is evident and the focus of the advertisement, have been found not to treat the issue of nudity with sensitivity to the relevant audience, even when the image is not sexual in nature.\n\nSection 2.5 prohibits the use of strong or obscene language and requires that the language used in advertising must be\n\nappropriate for the circumstances.\n\nWords and phrases which are innocuous and in widespread and common use in the Australian vernacular are permitted provided they are used in a manner consistent with their colloquial usage, for example with gentle humour, and not used in a demeaning or aggressive manner.\n\nThe “f” and “c” words are generally viewed as harmful, unacceptable and not permitted. Nonverbal representations of\n\nthe “f” word are also generally not permitted. Words and acronyms that play on the ‘f’ word, e.g. WTF and LMFAO, but do not use the actual word are normally considered acceptable if used in a light hearted and humorous way, are in subtitle rather than spoken word and are appropriate to the situation. Advertisements which use the ‘f’ word in full will be seen to constitute strong and offensive language, even when the audience is restricted. Advertising which\n\nuses the ‘f’ word where it has been insufficiently censored so that it can be easily understood by audiences, will be seen to constitute strong language, especially when seen by a broad audience.\n\nAdvertising which sufficiently beeps or censors language so that it cannot be understood will not be seen to be strong or obscene language.\n\nAdvertising which uses rhyming words, or similar words to strong language, will not be seen to be strong or obscene when used in a light-hearted and humorous manner.\n\nThere is a higher sensitivity in the community relating to the use of inappropriate language by children, even when it is not used in a demeaning or aggressive manner.\n\nWhen considering the application of this section to user generated content (UGC) within the control of the advertiser,\n\nthe Community Panel will have regard to the contextual and conversational nature of social media. In some cases, the use of the vernacular in UGC may not offend Prevailing Community Standards of the relevant audience.\n\nAdvertising that uses sexualised double entendre will often be seen to not breach the Code when there is a non-sexualised interpretation which would be understood by children viewing the advertisement.\n\nSection 2.6 requires that advertising must not depict content that would encourage or condone unhealthy or unsafe\n\nbehaviour having regard to Prevailing Community Standards.\n\nUNSAFE PRACTICES\n\nImages of unsafe driving, bike riding without helmets or not wearing a seatbelt while driving a motor vehicle are likely to be contrary to prevailing community standards relating to health and safety irrespective of whether such depictions are for the product/service being advertised or are incidental to the product.\n\nIn relation to the portrayal of farming, the dangerous use of quad bikes, children riding on tractors or other unsafe practices involving farming machinery will be contrary to prevailing community standards relating to health and safety. Similarly, advertisements depicting unsafe practices or images, such as riding down a hill in a wheelie bin,\n\nusing a mobile phone while driving or apparently hiding in a chest freezer etc are unacceptable.\n\nAdvertising which demonstrates the unsafe use of machinery, even when not the focus of the advertisement, is likely to be seen as unsafe and against prevailing community standards on health and safety.\n\nAdvertisers should take care not to depict behaviour that children may imitate. For example, advertisements which are likely to attract the attention of children or could indicate to children that appliances or other domestic/commercial equipment are a safe place to hide, are seen to encourage unsafe behaviour.\n\nAdvertisements which feature exaggerated or fantastical elements, which are unlikely to be seen as realistic by the relevant audience, are unlikely to be found to be encouraging or condoning unsafe behaviour.\n\nThis rule is not intended to prevent advertisers from depicting unsafe behaviour as a means to demonstrate potential negative effects, such as an advertisement for road safety depicting someone driving in a car after drinking alcohol.\n\nBULLYING\n\nThe age of the people depicted in an advertisement, their relationship to each other and the nature of the communication are relevant in determining whether an advertisement constitutes bullying and is contrary to Prevailing Community Standards. More care must be taken when the people depicted in an advertisement are\n\nMinors or if there is an unequal relationship between the people in the advertisement, e.g. student and teacher, manager and worker.\n\nBODY IMAGE\n\nAdvertising must not portray an unrealistic ideal body image by portraying body shapes or features that are unrealistic or unattainable through healthy practices. Exposure to unrealistic body ideals can lead to harmful body\n\ndissatisfaction and disordered eating and for this reason it is not acceptable in advertising.\n\nUNREALISTIC IDEAL BODY IMAGE: Advertising that provides an unrealistic ideal body image by portraying body shapes or features that are unrealistic or unattainable through healthy practices, which is not justifiable in the context of the product or service being advertised, will be contrary to prevailing community standards relating to health and safety.\n\nAn unrealistic ideal body image may occur where the overall theme, visuals or language used in the advertisement imply that:\n\n• a body shape, or feature, of the kind depicted (e.g. very thin or very muscular) is required to use the product or service or to participate in an activity associated with the product or service;\n\n• those people who do not have a body shape, or feature, of the kind depicted cannot use the product or service, or\n\nparticipate in a particular activity; or\n\n• those people who do not have a body shape, or feature, of the kind depicted should alter their body shape, or features, before they can use the product or service, or participate in a particular activity.\n\nAn unrealistic ideal body image may also occur where models are depicted in a way that:\n\n• promotes unhealthy practices\n\n• presents an unrealistic body image as aspirational; or\n\n• is reasonably likely to cause pressure to conform to a body shape that is unrealistic or unattainable through healthy practices (such as diet or physical activities); unless such depictions are justifiable in the context of the product or service advertised.\n\nBODY SIZE: The Code does not require the use of ‘healthy weight’ models as this term could exclude people in smaller or larger bodies from advertising and unnecessarily limit the portrayal of diversity in society. As such, advertisements may include a diversity of images, including people who have a variety of sizes and shapes, but advertisers should take care to avoid images of people with extreme body weights or shapes that are unrealistic or\n\nunattainable through healthy practices which are not justifiable in the context of the product or service advertised, and which are contrary to prevailing community standards relating to health and safety.\n\nWhile the use of people in smaller or larger bodies is itself not necessarily problematic, advertisers must ensure that models do not adopt a pose or are not depicted in a way which produces an unrealistic sense of body image, for example through the style of the advertising, the clothing, lighting, or make-up used.\n\nALTERATION OF IMAGES: The use of digitally enhanced images is a normal part of the production process used in many aspects of the media and advertising industries, and is a vehicle for visual expression. The Code does not prevent the use of post-production, altering or digitally enhancing an image. Similarly, the Code does not require a\n\ndisclosure that images have been digitally altered. However, where technology is used to digitally alter images of people to such an extent that their body shape, or features, are no longer realistic or attainable through healthy practices, or where the changes are not justifiable in the context of the product or service advertised, the advertisement may breach the Code if it is contrary to prevailing community standards relating to health and safety.\n\nAdvertisers should refrain from altering images in a way that changes the body shape or proportions portrayed, for example by lengthening a person’s legs to the extent they are not in proportion with the rest of their body or tightening their waist disproportionately to the rest of their body, so that the resulting image portrays a body shape\n\nor features that are unrealistic or unattainable through healthy practices.\n\nSection 2.7 requires that advertising must be clearly distinguishable as such.\n\nAdvertisers should be cognisant that, in seeking to make their advertising and marketing communication more engaging, they do not camouflage the fact that it is advertising. Advertising or marketing communication should\n\nnot be disguised as, for example, news, current affairs, independent market research, user-generated content, private blogs or independent reviews.\n\nThere is no absolute requirement that advertising or marketing communication must have a label however it must be clear to the audience. If it is clear to the audience that the content is commercial in nature (for example by the nature\n\nof the content, where the content is placed, how consumers are directed to the content, the theme, visuals and language used, or the use of brand names or logos), then no further disclosure or distinguishing element is needed.\n\nFor example, where a brand is advertising their own product on their own channel (e.g. the brand’s Facebook or Instagram account), no specific labels are required where it is clear to the audience that the brand is advertising their\n\nown product or service.\n\nInfluencer and affiliate marketing often appears alongside organic/genuine user generated content and is often less obvious to the audience. Where an influencer or affiliate accepts payment of money or free products or services from a brand in exchange for them to promote that brand’s products or services, the relationship must be clear, obvious and upfront to the audience and expressed in a way that is easily understood (e.g. #ad, Advert, Advertising,\n\nBranded Content, Paid Partnership, Paid Promotion). Less clear labels such as #sp, Spon, gifted, Affiliate, Collab, thanks to… or merely mentioning the brand name may not be sufficient to clearly distinguish the post as advertising.\n\nWhere advertisers have made commercial arrangements for the branded products to feature as a product placement, and no other claim is made about the products, no label or disclosure may be required. Even though\n\nconsumers may not realise the advertisers have made a commercial arrangement for their products to appear, the use of the branded products may be sufficient to distinguish the material as an advertisement or marketing\n\ncommunication. Further disclosure of product placement may not be necessary because there is a prevailing community view that audiences do not need to be notified of this sort of product placement.\n\nAdvertisers have flexibility as to how to ensure that material is distinguishable as advertising or marketing communication. Advertisers may use logos or brand names combined with other visual or audio cues where appropriate, such as background shading, outlines, borders, graphics, video or audio messages depending on the\n\nmedium. When advertisements are targeted to a specific audience, the relevant perspective is that of a typical member of the targeted group.\n\nResponsibility for developing content that is aligned to the AANA Codes falls to the advertiser – the brand owner who has control over the relevant material and whose products or services are being promoted. The AANA Codes do not apply to the broadcaster or publisher unless they are acting as advertiser for their own products or services.\n\nBe aware that other industry codes, such as the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice; Commercial Radio Code of Practice; ASTRA Codes of Practice; ADMA Code of Practice may also apply."
