        "text": "The World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) was established by the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. The program provides medical treatment, care and monitoring services (at no out-of-pocket cost) for specific symptoms and illnesses related to exposure at the disaster sites. The services are provided by clinics and hospitals that have expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of 9/11-related conditions. The WTCHP treats both Responders and Survivors â€“ they each have their own program.\n\nThe Responder Program monitors and treats those who did rescue, recovery and clean-up work at the World Trade Center and related sites. Police, firefighters, sanitation workers and the volunteers from NYC and beyond who came to the cityâ€™s aid after the attacks of September 11th, are all examples of enrollees in the Responder Program. Because it is a monitoring and treatment program, you do not have to be sick or have a symptom in order to enroll.\n\nThe Survivor Program is for those who lived, worked, went to school or daycare in Manhattan south of Houston Street and in any area of Brooklyn that is 1.5 miles from the World Trade Center site. This includes areas of Brooklyn such as parts of Brooklyn Heights and Dumbo. The Survivor Program is a treatment program â€“ you must have a 9/11-related symptom or disease to enroll.\n\nThe most common problems are coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, sinus congestion, laryngitis, asthma, heartburn, GERD, stomach problems, anxiety, nervousness, depression, and PTSD. As of October 2012, certain cancers are covered as well. While it is hard to know if your health issues are 9/11 related, your evaluating physician at the WTC Health Program will determine if there is a connection.\n\nNote to parents of teenagers: Bellevue Hospital has a separate program to serve the needs of teens who were physically or emotionally impacted by the attacks of 9/11. The enrollment procedure is the same as the adult program. For more information:"
