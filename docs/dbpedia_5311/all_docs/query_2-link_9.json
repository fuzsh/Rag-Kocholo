        "text": "The World Trade Center Health Registry researchers track and investigate possible trends in illness and recovery.\n\nOur reports are used to help create guidelines that can save lives and reduce injuries in future disaster settings. Through our Treatment Referral Program, we help enrollees get the 9/11-related medical monitoring and treatment they need.\n\nThe Registry continues its mission to better understand the long-term physical and mental health effects of 9/11, and to identify gaps in health care for all those affected.\n\nHistory\n\nAfter 9/11, there were concerns about potentially long-term health effects from the disaster, especially from the toxins people inhaled from the dust cloud and the psychological impact of the events.\n\nIn November 2001, the NYC Health Department helped create a registry devoted to handling 9/11-related health effects. Their main goals were to:\n\nTrack the health of people affected by 9/11\n\nDocument the physical and mental health impact of 9/11\n\nInvestigate rare cancers among those who were near the World Trade Center\n\nProvide information for health screening programs\n\nHelp registry enrollees find services for their 9/11 health-related conditions\n\nAn estimated 400,000 were initially eligible for the registry. In July 2002, the World Trade Center Health Registry received federal funding to begin operations.\n\nHealth Surveys\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, the Registry began a voluntary enrollment for people who lived, worked or went to school near the World Trade Center, as well as for those who were involved in rescue and recovery efforts. To enroll, people completed a health survey — called Wave 1 — about their experiences on 9/11 and their health.\n\nWe used this data to compare the health of those directly exposed to 9/11 to the general population.\n\nPeople Estimated Eligible for the Registry\n\n360,000 building occupants and others in the area\n\n91,000 rescue/recovery workers and volunteers\n\n57,00 residents south of Canal street\n\n15,000 children and staff in schools south of Canal street\n\nAmong eligible enrollees:\n\n83% were building occupants who evacuated their workplaces\n\n70% reported witnessing traumatizing events, such as seeing collapsing people or people injured or killed\n\n61% were adult residents who evacuated their homes\n\n51% reported being caught in the dust cloud\n\n13% reported a 9/11-related injury\n\nFollow-up Surveys\n\nDue to an overwhelming response to the Wave 1 survey (PDF), the Registry conducted follow-up surveys:\n\nWave 2 Survey for Adults (PDF)\n\nWave 2 Survey for Children (PDF)\n\nWave 3 Survey for Adults (PDF)\n\nWave 3 Survey for Adolescentes (PDF)\n\nWave 3 Survey for Parents of Adolescent Enrollees (PDF)\n\nWave 4 Survey for All Age Groups (PDF)\n\nAsthma Survey (PDF)\n\nWave 5 Survey for Adults (PDF)\n\n2021 COVID-19 Survey (PDF)\n\n2022 Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Survey (PDF)\n\nCOVID-19 Follow-Up Survey (PDF)\n\nOther Languages: Español | 繁體中文\n\nIn 2020, the Wave 5 survey was sent out with a focused effort to reach millennials who were registered as enrollees by their parents or guardians in 2003.\n\nBy looking at responses to health questions over time and matching the information to other health registries, we can learn about the long-term health effects of 9/11. Based on information gathered in these surveys, the Registry has published over 150 research papers."
