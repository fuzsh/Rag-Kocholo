        "text": "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has issued the First Periodic Review of Scientific and Medical Evidence Related to Cancer for the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program.\n\nThis first review provides a summary of the current scientific and medical findings in the peer-reviewed literature about exposures resulting from the Sept.11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City and cancer studies. The review discusses criteria that have been used previously to assist in weighing the scientific evidence to determine if a causal association exists between exposure and cancer. It also summarizes input from the public and provides updates from researchers about ongoing or planned cancer studies.\n\nAlthough a determination cannot be made to propose a rule to add cancer, or a type of cancer, to the List of WTC-Related Health Conditions at this time, it is important to point out that the current absence of published scientific and medical findings demonstrating a causal association between the WTC exposures and the occurrence of cancer in responders and survivors does not indicate evidence of the absence of a causal association, says NIOSH. As new research and findings are released, we will continue to review the evidence and update our assessment.\n\nThe reviews are required under the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. A second periodic review is expected to be conducted in early to mid-2012."
