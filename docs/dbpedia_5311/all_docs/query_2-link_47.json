        "text": "WTF Moments was a YouTube show broadcast by WCPW as extra content to support their weekly output of wrestling shows. Presented by King Ross, the show was a humerous rundown of the stand out moments of previous Specials or WCPW Loaded shows.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWTF Moments debuted on the WCPW Youtube channel on 21 July 2016 and covered the events of WCPW Loaded Episode 4. Hosted by King Ross the show was an adaption of his popular WTF Moments series that ran on the main Whatculture Wrestling channel, where he covered events in the WWE.\n\nThe show initially ran concurrently with the WCPW Loaded episodes and Specials, with one episode covering each show, usually posted a couple of days after the main show aired. From March 2017, Loaded became more irregular due to ongoing issues with YouTube's advertising policy and WTF episodes were produced soley for the ongoing WCPW specials.\n\nIn August 2017 WTF resumed covering the weekly Loaded shows but was discontinued after only a further two episodes when Ross left Whatculture.\n\nEpisodes[]"
