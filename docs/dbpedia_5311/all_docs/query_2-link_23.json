        "text": "The first member of the United States military to know that something was wrong on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 was a member of the New York Air National Guard on duty at an air defense headquarters. By the end of the day more than 8,000 members of the Army National Guard had been mobilized by the governor, New York Air National Guard jets were conducting combat air patrols over American cities, and Army Guard Soldiers were assisting first responders in Manhattan.\n\nOver the following weeks the New York National Guard continued to assist in emergency and recovery operations at Ground Zero that transitioned into security augmentation duties that continue to this day. On 9/11 the New York National Guard met the challenge it was handed. These photographs, videos, and documents help tell that story."
