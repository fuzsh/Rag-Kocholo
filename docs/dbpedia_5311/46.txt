7. 7 HYPOTHESIS 1. Marketing is broken 2. The Web offers the promise to fix it 3. Social Media enables Web’s real potential (Yay!) 4. Marketers freak out (OMG! People are talking back!) 5. Marketing shoehorns the same old crud into the shiny new channels 6. Social Media is broken

9. 9 THREE FALLACIES What we bullshit about when we bullshit about bullshit…

18. 18 IT’S A LIE  You get dummy, shell accounts  Most <100 days old, very low follower/friend counts, average of 9 tweets per account  Most accounts are filled with bot-generated spam content  You’re not buying an audience, you’re buying crap

19. 19 IT DOESN’T WORK  Metcalfe’s Law: “The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system”  Michael’s Law: “The value of a social network is proportional to the square of the number of engaged contributors to the system”  Followers and fans are only of any real “value” if they: 1. Have a pulse; 2. Have consciously chosen to follow or Like you, and; 3. Are actually engaged in spreading the word about you among their own circles of influence

20. 20 BIG FAN COUNT != BIG ENGAGEMENT Nearly 70 per cent of people who Like a brand page rarely or never return to the page (Source: Penn State U Study) Source: Pagelever - reported on AllFacebook.com

21. 21 BIG FAN COUNT != BIG ENGAGEMENT

22. 22 BIG FAN COUNT != BIG ENGAGEMENT

23. 23 MORE CONNECTIONS DOES NOT MEAN MORE CONNECTEDNESS

24. 24 2 FAKE IT …till you make it

26. 26 FRIENDS DON’T LET FRIENDS TWEET LIKE THIS @TechnoBlort TechnoBlort Industries

27. 27 7 DEADLY SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING SINS 1. Sock puppets! 2. “Conversation Calendars” written by copywriters 3. Automated tweeting + zero-response monitoring 4. Transmedia promotion (same batcrap, different batchannel) 5. Pushing news releases as status updates or blog posts 6. Ignoring feedback, deleting comments or, even worse, not allowing them 7. Thinking you can control the message

30. 30 3 FISH WHERE THE FISH ARE

32. 32 “At the heart of the Internet business is one of the great business fallacies of our time: that the Web, with all its targeting abilities, can be a more efficient, and hence more profitable, advertising medium than traditional media.” “The nature of people’s behavior on the Web and of how they interact with advertising… has meant a marked decline in advertising’s impact.”

35. 35 THE #1 SOCIAL MEDIA MISTAKE

36. Social Media is like Soylent Green… It’s PEOPLE! urce: http://newsevents.arts.ac.uk

38. PREREQUISITES  A desire to be closer to your customer  A belief that conversation can build a bond of understanding  A willingness to act on what you hear and learn  A tolerance for dissent – not everyone will agree with you  And one other thing…

40. 40 BUILD YOUR OWN HUB  Why are you investing so much in building a community someone else controls?  Where’s the “Tweet this” button on Facebook; the “Like” button for Twitter?  When people find you out there, where do you want them to end up?  Create and curate!  But… what do I write about?

43. 43 WHAT I’VE LEARNED  If you’re genuinely interested in what your customers want, they’ll tell you  Talk to people; try not to be a dick  Don’t self promote. Remember “The Because Effect.”  Tell great stories  If someone starts telling you how to do it right, chances are they’re doing it wrong  Er…

44. JUST DO IT  If you’re a small company  Change now. You’ll win.  If you’re an agency  Push back. Tell clients they’re wrong. Refuse to execute crap ideas.  If you’re a consumer  Talk loud. Be heard. Out the bad and the good.  If you’re a big company drone  Get porous with customers. Be human. If you can’t fix it: leave.

45. When you think of the Internet, don't think of Mack trucks full of widgets destined for distributorships, whizzing by countless billboards. Think of a table for two. @Man, 1997
