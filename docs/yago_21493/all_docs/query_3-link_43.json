        "text": "THERE is something eerily disconnected about \"Heaven Can Wait.\" It may be because in a time of comparative peace, immortality — at least in its life-after-death form — doesn't hold the fascination for us that it does when there's a war going on, as there was in 1941 when \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" was released and became such a hit. Or perhaps we are somewhat more sophisticated today (though I doubt it) and comedies about heavenly messengers and what is, in effect, a very casual kind of transubstantiation seem essentially silly.Whatever the reason, \"Heaven Can Wait,\" Warren Beatty's remake of \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan,\" gives the impression of being a swinging 1978 romantic comedy struggling to free itself from the body of the 1941 film. Most of the time it remains locked in, embraced by the unyielding requirements of its elaborate, facetious plot gimmick.This, as in \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan,\" which also was based on a play titled \"Heaven Can Wait,\" is about a professional athlete, a star quarter-back with the Los Angles Rams, who is accidentally gathered by a heavenly messenger before his time has come. When the mistake is realized, the athlete, named Joe Pendleton (Mr. Beatty), is escorted back to earth to find a suitable body to inherit so that Joe can go on to play in the Super Bowl. That, unfortunately, is just the beginning, though it takes so much screen time to tell that the audience is always ahead of it.The surprise is that \"Heaven Can Wait\" is as much fun as it is when it has to waste so much energy in the service of a gimmick that we would now endure only in a pilot film for a projected television series titled \"I Dream of Joey.\"The movie, which opens today at Loews State 2 and other theaters, is a hybrid of no great style but of a good deal of charm and with a marvelous cast headed by Julie Christie, Jack Warden, Dyan Cannon, Buck Henry, James Mason and Mr. Beatty, who stars in the film, produced it, co-directed it (with Mr. Henry) and co-wrote the screenplay (with Elaine May).Only time and innate modesty, I assume, prevented him from acting as his own assistant producer.Though updated from the 40's, the May-Beatty screenplay seems to follow closely the earlier film, written by Sidney Buchman and Seton I. Miller, yet only Harry Segall, the author of the play, is given screen credit. Some of the film's best moments, however, are random inspirations of dialogue and bits of business that recall the tone of Miss May at the peak of her comic form.The film's funniest characters are not played by Mr. Beatty or Julie Christie (as the spunky English girl Joe Pendleton falls in love with). They are Joe's wife (when he is in the body of a wealthy nut named Farnsworth) and her lover, a pair of scheming, would-be murderers of the sort Miss May showed such fondness for in \"A New Leaf.\" The characters are well written and beautifully played by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin.I suspect that no one but Miss May (and possibly Buck Henry) would envision a scene in which one of the murderers, expecting at any minute to be discovered, says to his accomplice when the police are about to enter the drawing room, \"Pick up 'The Fountainhead' and pretend to be reading.\"The film's associations to time are nothing if not eclectic. Memories of \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" evoke the 1930's and early 40's. \"The Fountainhead\" suggests the late 40's and early 50's. The Rams and pro football are very much of today, while the very funny populist speech that Joe Pendleton delivers (in the body of Mr. Farnsworth to a board of directors' meeting) recalls Frank Capra's comedies of the mid-30's. All of which may lead you to believe — correctly — that \"Heaven Can Wait\" hasn't much personality of its own.Instead it has a kind of earnest cheerfulness that is sometimes most winning. Mr. Beatty and Miss Christie are performers who bring to their roles the easy sort of gravity that establishes characters of import, no matter how simply they are drawn in the script. Neither James Mason as Mr. Jordan, the fellow in charge of recently gathered souls, nor Mr. Henry, as the messenger who botched his first job, have much to do, but they are presences we recognize. In a much more colorful part, that of Joe Pendleton's trainer, Jack Warden must bridge the gap between the film's sentimental impulses and its lunatic comedy, and he succeeds with ease.All of these people, though, are upstaged by a plot that keeps butting into the movie just as it's building some comic momentum. There's nothing worse than a pushy narrative.\"Heaven Can Wait,\" which has been rated PC (\"Parental Guidance Suggested\"), contains some language that, I suppose, could be called grown-up if not adult, but there is nothing else in the movie to disturb the smallest mind.\n\nA Remake of 1941\n\nHEAVEN CAN WAIT, directed by Warren Beatty and Buck Henry; screenplay by Elaine May and Mr. Beatty, based on a play by Harry Segall; produced by Mr. Beatty; executive producers, Howard W.
