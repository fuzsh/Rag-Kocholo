        "text": "Lubitschland finally gets an address. And is there any surprise that it’s on 5th Avenue?\n\nFor Ernst Lubitsch, a director who built his distinct style around the conjuring of lush worlds in kingdoms (and one queendom) out of time and place, “Heaven Can Wait” is a story distinct to its fixed point in both. New York City. Turn of the century.\n\nAnd the stakes of the plot? Determine whether its playboy protagonist will spend eternity in either heaven or hell.\n\nDevilish flirt that his works portend him to be, it’s a distinctly Lubitsch choice to eschew dabbling in sentimental angel business with regards to the afterlife, as did his colleagues; Capra and the Archers. No, Lubitsch opens his romance on…\n\nLubitsch is underrated at melodrama. Much like his rapid-fire comedies, his forays into drama likewise work on such a profound level because of his one quality they all draw from: his understanding of human relationships. Be it about the process of falling in love (The Shop Around the Corner) or about the everyday tussles of sharing a home with someone (Design for Living), Lubitsch understands the dynamics between the two sides. He knows his characters and thus is able to breathe life into them in a way that they will know each other.\n\nIn Heaven Can Wait, Lubitsch pays homage to enduring love. He introduces a couple who's been married for decades, and chronicles the arc of their love and…\n\nI wonder how the Catholic church felt about this one. It essentially asserts that serial adultery is not a mortal sin--a nicer way to say it is that it says that love trumps infidelity in the eyes of the Devil, perhaps--which is somehow not listed as a source of controversy on the Wikipedia page for this (I really thought it would be scandalous, so I looked it up). Instead, this got nominated for Academy Awards. Not that I entirely mind. The film was well crafted, funny, and had some romance to it.\n\nMy real problem, of course, is that it seems to absolve Van Cleve of his infidelities while leaving Martha as a doting wife. After her initial attempt to…\n\nIt was an act of profound humanism for Ernst Lubitsch to make a film--in 1943, at the height of production code enforced morality and WWII \"do your part\" rhetoric, mind you--suggesting that being a bit of a cad and a layabout with no ambition or concern for the world beyond your front door shouldn't necessarily condemn you to eternal damnation. Maybe the way he went about it was problematic in some areas (the film's tacit acceptance of gender double standards can and will be debated forever) but the general thrust is one of understanding and empathy.\n\nNobody is arguing that Don Ameche's character is a moral man, just that his immorality does not equate to evil. Basically it's Lubitsch saying…\n\nI don't find infidelity particularly charming, no matter how discreetly it is done. Since I didn't like Don Ameche's cad of a character, I soured on the film early on. It doesn't matter how appealing Lubitsch tried to dress up this movie, it ultimately was about Ameche cheating.\n\nCharles Coburn was a hoot as the grandpa so those moments were fun. Gene Tierney was so beautiful in color. However, what the heck was up with her hairstyle when she became old? That was hideous!\n\n1st Ernst Lubitsch (before Trouble in Paradise, One Hour with You, I Don't Want to Be a Man, The Merry Widow, The Doll, The Oyster Princess, Design for Living, Mayer from Berlin and The Smiling Princess)\n\nThe ultimate irony of Heaven Can Wait is that all those around Ameche’s Hell-sent playboy were better people than he ever could be. His priggish cousin is sincere and clear-eyed, the parents-in-law deeply devoted to their daughter even when they can’t stand each other. His grandfather a tender-hearted cad. And his wife, a beautiful moonbeam in the shape of Gene Tierney, loves him despite herself. Henry? He’s weak, vain and too self-serious for his own good, an ageing Casanova who refuses to accept he’s over…"
