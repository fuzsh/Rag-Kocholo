        "text": "Wonder Reels: a night for music and film lovers.\n\nWonder Reels return to the Cinema Museum with their unique events featuring live performances from outstanding London musicians followed by a 35mm screening of a full feature film chosen with the artist in mind.\n\nThe evening will start with a concert by British songwriter James Howard whose first solo record Peek-a-Boo came out in 2023 and was praised by the music press for its “lyrical shrewdness” and the unsettling beauty of its “lilting lunar lullabies.” His songs are full of places, objects and people—including actor Jackie Coogan, who played alongside Chaplin in The Kid and was an inspiration for album opener Child Starz. For Wonder Reels Howard plans to write a special number in response to our chosen film—and play it just the once!\n\nThe performance will be followed by a 35mm film screening of Warren Beatty’s 1978 Oscar-winning movie Heaven Can Wait, which he produced, co-wrote, co-directed and starred in. This delightful romantic comedy tells the story of a Californian quarterback sent to heaven before his time, only to be given a second chance at life in the body of a recently murdered millionaire, which leads to many ludicrous and eerie situations. Please note this original 35mm print has some colour fade.\n\nCome and have a heavenly evening with us.\n\nDoors open at 18.30, live performance from 19.30, film from 20.30.\n\nRefreshments will be available in our licensed cafe/bar.\n\nTICKETS & PRICING\n\nTickets £10."
