        "text": "There are quite few movies from my early childhood that I remember fondly. Not all of them are classics. In fact, some of them seem down right cheesy when I watch them now, but Heaven Can Wait (a movie I watched over and over again on HBO), I not only remember fondly, but it stands up remarkably well today.\n\nWarren Beatty co-wrote the script, co-directed the movie, produced it and also starred in it as Joe Pendleton, a back-up quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams. When Joe goes bike riding and seems destined to die in a horrific accident, an Escort Angel (Buck Henry) whisks his soul out of his body before the accident and takes him to a way station half-way between heaven and hell. It turns out however, that Joe wouldn't have died, but since his body has been cremated, the Escort and his boss (God?), played by James Mason, have to find Joe a replacement body. He winds up in the body of Leo Farnsworth, the CEO of an international conglomerate whose wife and Personal Private Executive Secretary have just murdered him. While in Leo's body, he buy the Rams so he can become their quarterback again and falls in love with Betty Logan, a environmentalist from England who has come to Leo to protest the construction of a factory near her home village.\n\nSome of the movie's best comedy is provided by Dyan Cannon as Mrs. Farnsworth and Charles Grodin as Farnsworth's Secretary. The two of whom are having an affair. Cannon is drunkenly hysterical, while Grodin is very dry and sarcastic. One of my favorite scenes in the movie involves the two of them when they realize that Farnsworth isn't dead and Cannon screams. Grodin explains her screaming by stating, \"She saw a mouse.\" \"She just saw a mouse?\" \"No. Before. Outside. But she relives it.\" It might not sound hilarious just reading, but Grodin's delivery is priceless.\n\nOf course Beatty is the heart and soul of the movie and he does a great job. His Joe isn't the brightest person in the world, but he's likable and well intentioned and he never stops running. I always feel that at the end of the movie although it's kind of a happy ending, that he gets screwed. It makes the ending both happy and sad, like all the best movies are. As a director Beatty has a light touch. He keeps the story moving briskly along. The movie never gets very serious and yet you care about the characters.\n\nThere are also some very funny lines in the movie. I love the following exchange as an example.\n\nFormer owner: He got my team. The son of a bitch got my team.\n\nAdvisor to former owner: What kind of pressure did he use, Milt?\n\nFormer owner: All I asked was sixty-seven million, and he said \"okay.\"\n\nAdvisor to former owner: Ruthless bastard.\n\nApparently this is a remake of an earlier film from the 1940s, but I never saw the original so I certainly can't compare them. All I can say is that it would have to be very good indeed to be better than this version, which was nominated for 9 Oscars. It's good to know that some things from my childhood do live up to the memories and Heaven Can Wait is one of those things."
