        "text": "Heaven Can Wait holds up as one of the best films of 1978 and remains a timeless classic.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Feb 2, 2024\n\nThe film has no desire but to please, and that’s its only compulsiveness; it’s so timed and pleated and smoothed that it’s sliding right off the screen.\n\nFull Review | Sep 18, 2023\n\nWarren Beatty starred in, co-directed and co-wrote this fluffy, light-as-air romantic comedy about a football player who comes back from the dead as a sort of a proto-Forrest Gump.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jun 27, 2022\n\nBeatty's determined yet charming Joe is formidable, naïve, and optimistic all at the same time\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Dec 29, 2021\n\nA wonderful piece of entertainment that's as funny as it is fanciful.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Dec 4, 2021\n\nNot much meat here, but there are generous helpings of what we say we want: laughs, lovely ladies and cute men and a trouble or two made all better by any number of decent folks before the final frame.\n\nFull Review | Nov 5, 2021\n\nBeatty reached his commercial and creative zenith with this movie. Having May, Henry and Towne picking up some of the slack behind the camera certainly helped but it's clear he had the final word on every creative aspect of this unforgettable classic.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Oct 24, 2021\n\nBeatty can carry off this sort of whimsy by playing it straight and keeping the ludicrous premise credible. But the film is dogged by the nagging vision of what might have been.\n\nFull Review | Jul 13, 2020\n\nA pleasant little puff piece that is sure to be just loved by most of those who see it.\n\nFull Review | Jun 16, 2020\n\n[The film] has everything going for it: big laughs, populist politics, billowy sequences set in heaven, a murder plot, a climactic Super Bowl game, a supporting cast of choice comic actors, and best of all, a touching (but PG) romance.\n\nFull Review | Jan 24, 2014\n\nThis updated version of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr Jordan is one of the few remakes that is almost as good as the original.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jan 24, 2014"
