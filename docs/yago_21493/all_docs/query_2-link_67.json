        "text": "AKA Henry Warren Beaty\n\nBorn: 30-Mar-1937\n\nBirthplace: Richmond, VA\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Baptist\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nParty Affiliation: Democratic\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Dick Tracy\n\n\"I've always been antagonized by the Freudian Victorian assumption that a hyperactive life with women was necessarily a manifestation of misogynistic feelings or latent homosexuality.\"\n\nIn one of his first prominent roles, Beatty played Dobie's rival for the affections of Thalia on TV's Dobie Gillis. Beatty, though, thought the role was ludicrous, and left the series after its first season. He was nominated for a Tony starring on Broadway in a 1959 production of William Inge's A Loss of Roses, and he became a prominent actor with his first film role, opposite Natalie Wood in the teen melodrama Splendor in the Grass.\n\nA notorious womanizer, Beatty dated Natalie Wood while making Splendor, but once abandoned her in a restaurant when he made a successful pass at a pretty waitress. Over the next thirty years of his life, Beatty was often paparazzi fodder for his many affairs with many co-stars, princesses, and ordinary, un-famous beauties. Woody Allen once joked that if he believed in reincarnation, he would like to come back as Beatty's fingertips. In 2009, a Beatty biographer concluded that Beatty bedded \"12,775 women, give or take, a figure that does not include daytime quickies, drive-bys, casual gropings, stolen kisses and so on.\" Beatty's people promptly and publicly disputed that math.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Beatty briefly dated singer-songwriter Carly Simon, who subsequently had a hit singing, \"You're so vain / I'll bet you think this song is about you\". For decades, rumors have swirled that Simon wrote the song about Beatty, but the closest she has ever come to confirming it was in a 1983 interview, when she said of Beatty, \"He certainly thought it was about him. He called me and said thanks for the song.\" After decades of plowing all the fertile ground in Hollywood, Beatty, then 54, married his Bugsy co-star Bening in 1992. Despite predictions of philandering, Beatty seems to have mellowed into a traditional family man, and the couple now has four children.\n\nOnly six years after his first film, Beatty produced and starred in Bonnie & Clyde with Faye Dunaway. A huge box office and critical success, the film was nominated for ten Oscars and won two. Beatty is the only person to twice earn Oscar nominations in all four major categories -- acting, writing, directing, and producing. He won the award for directing Reds, a huge, sweeping drama based on the life of American communist John Reed. Beatty also co-wrote, produced, and played the lead. Beatty's other films include Robert Altman's western McCabe & Mrs. Miller, the paranoid thriller The Parallax View, the romantic comedy Heaven Can Wait, and the gangster drama Bugsy. He also produced and starred with Dustin Hoffman in one of Hollywood's legendary box office bombs, the desert musical-comedy Ishtar. His long career as a movie star seems to have stalled, with most of his recent films flopping at the box office. His last moderately successful film was the odd but amusing Bulworth in 1998, in which Beatty played an aging white politician using rap to run for re-election.\n\nAn outspoken liberal, he has campaigned for every Democratic presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy. Beatty was rumored for many years to have political aspirations, but his lecherous past would probably present problems in any run for office.\n\nThe highest-grossing film of Beatty's career was 1990's Dick Tracy, with Madonna and Glenne Headly. Beatty had purchased the film rights to the comic strip character, and directed and produced the film. In 2002, Beatty sued Tribune Media Services, part of the corporation that owns the Chicago Tribune, when TMS claimed that film rights to the character had reverted to its control, blocking Beatty from making a sequel. As of 2006, the lawsuit has not yet been concluded.\n\nFather: Ira O.
