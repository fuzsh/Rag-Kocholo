        "text": "The occupation authorities of The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and The Territory of the German Military Commander in Serbia had difficulties in gaining the support for the implementation of the cultural policy of the Nazi Germany beyond the narrow circle of conservative and far-right wing intellectuals. A particularly insightful strategy of legitimizing the occupational cultural policy and overcoming the lack of mass support conducted by the collaboration authorities was the organization and promotion of literary competitions with the aim of inclusion of the wider population in the process of ‘normalization’ of the occupation. By analyzing texts written mostly by hitherto unknown authors, the paper aims to reconstruct the ways in which the occupation was experienced by ‘ordinary people’ willing to cooperate with the occupiers. The various themes, from pastoral depictions of village life to the experience from the front, all served as a link between the national-socialist ideology and everyday existence. The set of commonplaces that characterize the awarded literary texts demonstrate the limits of allowed imagination in the everyday life of occupied societies. Despite the differences between the two occupied territories in their relation to local literary traditions, national mythology and the intensity of repression, in both cases published fictional accounts tended to reconcile the occupation with the patriotic sentiment, presenting this peculiar position as the will of the majority.\n\nThe dual aim of this article is, on the one hand, to identify Bessarabian writers’ individual and group rationale to stay in the territory occupied by the Soviet authorities after 28 June 1940 and, on the other hand, to analyse the institutional mechanisms set up by the Soviet authorities (namely the Moldovan Writers Union (MWU) and AgitProp) to integrate these writers into the Soviet cultural system. The three groups of Bessarabian writers remaining in the annexed territory (the ‘regionalists’ from Viaţa Basarabiei journal, the writers of Jewish origin and the formerly ‘underground’ (proCommunist) activists) intersected and overlapped, since the writers’ interests were often multiple. At the same time, the strategies implemented by the Soviet authorities to enroll Bessarabian writers into the Soviet institutional structures followed a binary and apparently contradictory rationale, of inclusion (of candidates deemed suitable for the aspiring status) and exclusion (of those who did not correspond to the criteria of political probity). Moldovan writers coming from the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) (the ‘Transnistrians’) had a crucial role in the integration and enrolment of Bessarabian writers into the MWU as mediators with the Soviet authorities (having had a longer ‘length of service’ in Soviet political and cultural affairs), as well as in the role of cultural and ideological ‘tutors’. In response to these enrolment strategies operated by the MWU, Bessarabian writers adopted a zealous and emulative behaviour in order to ensure their successful integration. This behaviour laid the basis for duplicitous and somewhat dysfunctional interactions between writers, which would reach a paroxysm in the post-war ‘Zhdanovist’ campaign.\n\nThe fall of Communism gave way to a frantic search for the “truth” wherein competing narratives aimed at expunging collective memory and reconstruct national identity. In post-socialist Romania memory, history and justice have become embedded in an ongoing struggle for political power between the surviving forces of the old regime and those who believe in a complete break with the pre-1989 nationalist-communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. Twenty five years after the Revolution, Romania’s cultural milieu has not yet escaped the boundaries of the aforementioned paradigm. This paper will not dwell on the critical anthologies cited above. Instead, it will focus on the debates surrounding the critical role of the writer-intellectual and the production of literarure inside an authoritarian regime. The main questions this paper seeks to answer is how should we approach literature produced during the Communist period? Were literary productions entirely the product of ideology? How did the literary canon evolve and how was it influenced by the historical and political context of the time? In an effort to break away from the socialist regime should all literary creations produced during he Communist era be discarded? In retrospect how should one asses the role of the writer/intellectual?\n\nBecause there was no samizdat literature in Romania, historians, men of letters, the public in general were eagerly awaiting the ’90s desk drawer writings of the communist period. The first surprise was that the number was smaller than imagined and then came the revelation that the much-awaited great literature did not bring too much, either as a mirror of the time, or aesthetically. The posthumous novels of Ion D. Sîrbu (1919–1989)—an undeniable victim of the regime—are representative of the censored literature, and their lack of success is a social-literary phenomenon that, once investigated, may explain the singular manner of resistance through culture.\n\nLooking at Bulgarian society and cultural life of the first half of the 1900s, this study scrutinizes a common belief in the high public esteem reserved for poets and writers in eastern Europe. It demonstrates that the creators of literature (and the national arts in general) occupied a precarious position in a society without a sustainable cultural market. The predicament of Bulgarian writers, however, was that of many European literati in early 1900s competing for readers’ attention with a rising mass culture. Placing Bulgarian writers in a broader interwar framework, this article explores the various non-literary strategies they pursued in affirming the public value of national literature. In the process, it suggests that the lore of “the writer as a national hero” was the deliberate work of social actors seeking to correct an unsatisfying reality and not an expression of an organic relationship between nation and writers (and intellectuals more broadly)."
