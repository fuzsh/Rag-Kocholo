        "text": "1. Preliminaries\n\nAs Partington notes (1993: 178), \"the importance of intensification in the communicative process is that it is a vehicle for impressing, praising, persuading, insulting, and generally influencing the listener's reception of the language\". The linguistic elements that most clearly signal intensification both in English and Romanian, as well as in other languages, fall into a syntactically defined class whose members primarily modify adjectives and adverbs. Upgrading and downgrading modifiers, such as very, too, so, extremely, awfully, absolutely, terribly, slightly, a bit, not at all are generally referred to under different umbrella terms: intensifiers (Bolinger 1972; Allerton 1987; Athanasiadou 2007; Cacchiani 2009), degree modifiers (Paradis 1997; Kennedy, McNally 2005), intensives (Stoffel 1901), intensive qualifiers/intensifying elements (Bezinger 1971), adverbs of degree (BÃ¤cklund 1973), intensifying adverbs (Vermeire 1979; Anderson 2006), intensifier adverbs (Alexiadou 1994), adverbial intensifiers (Protopopescu 2012).\n\nIn this paper, we have adopted the term intensifying adverb for the following reasons: first, from a morpho-syntactic point of view, we find it important to discriminate -ly derivational adverbs which form an open class, from \"lite elements\" (Protopopescu 2012: 24-25) such as very, too, so, that, which belong to \"a limited set of adverbs, namely, the set of degree words\" (Cornilescu 1995: 237-239); secondly, we oppose intensifying (upgrading) modifiers to downtoning (downgrading) ones; thirdly, given that both adverbs and adjectives may fulfil an intensifying function1, cover terms like intensifiers, intensifying elements, intensives etc., which do not indicate the morphological class, may be misleading, too.\n\nIn order to figure out a number of semantic and syntactic traits that govern the use and interpretation of intensifying adverbs a syntactic restriction has been placed on our study: since gradability is mainly associated with adjectives and with adverbs derived from adjectives, intensifying adverbs are examined as modifiers of gradable adjectives only, in both their attributive and predicative use.\n\n2. Maximizers vs. boosters\n\nAs Paradis (1997: 41) observes, \"it is possible to say 'absolutely amazing', while 'absolutely nice' is strange\". In an attempt to answer the question whether such a constraint is predictable or not, Paradis (1997:50) suggests a set of four criteria according to which gradable adjectives should be examined:\n\n1. The possibility to occur in the comparative and the superlative;\n\n2. The possibility to fill the x slot in How x is it?;\n\n3. The possibility to fill the x slot in How x!;\n\n4. The type of oppositeness involved (antonymy).\n\nBy applying these four criteria, Paradis (1997: 50-59) distinguishes three types of gradable adjectives - scalar, extreme and limit adjectives - which are opposed to the class of \"nongradables\"; we have summarized these aspects in the table below:\n\nOn the basis of the above systematization, intensifying adverbs may be classified into maximizers and boosters (Paradis 1997: 77-78). Maximizers are associated with totality and combine with adjectives which involve a boundary (an either-or conception), more precisely, with extreme and limit adjectives: \"absolutely brilliant\", \"completely full\", \"totally unsuited\", \"entirely blameless\", \"utterly disgraceful\", \"fully deductible\"; the members of the maximizer paradigm cannot, therefore, specify scalar adjectives (e.g. *\"entirely good\", *\"completely fast\"). Boosters, on the other hand, are associated with scalarity (they are conceptualized against a mode of more-or-less) and they modify an unbounded gradable property of the adjective they apply to: \"terribly sad\", \"extremely rare\", \"incredibly thin\", \"deeply indebted\", \"highly flammable\", \"enormously proud\".\n\nWhile maximizers form a relatively restricted set (absolutely, completely, entirely, fully, perfectly, totally, utterly and wholly), the ability of rapid change and recycling of different forms is a typical feature of boosters. Actually, as Bolinger (1972: 23) remarks, any inventory of intensifying adverbs should be viewed as \"a sampling rather than a catalog, not because the set of intensifiers is too big to do more than a sample, but because it is too open-ended\"2.\n\n3. From expressivity to delexicalization and grammaticalization\n\nIntensification is a lexical-grammatical category that is mainly used to achieve expressivity. Thus, \"it thrives on novelty, i.e. on innovation and semantic change\" (Lorenz 2002: 143). The linguistic mechanism through which intensifying adverbs undergo constant change is the general process of grammaticalization, namely delexicalization. The stages which adverbs go through during the process of delexicalization are visually represented by Tagliamonte and Roberts (2005: 285) as follows (Figure 1):\n\nA correlation can, therefore, be established between delexicalization and collocational behaviour: \"Once a submodifier begins to collocate more and more widely, it automatically loses the independent lexical content it once had\" (Partington 1993: 183). Lorenz (2002: 144), for example, illustrates the link between the degree of delexicalization of boosters and their frequency by opposing terribly to horrifically: both adverbs are potential boosters of adjectives; both of them have associations of \"shock, fright, disgust\"; however, horrifically is, by far, less frequent than terribly (10 vs. 1253 hits in the British National Corpus), which shows that a lower frequency of an intensifying adverb involves a higher level of emphasis and expressivity. With respect to the parallel between terribly and horrifically, we would add that, in terms of implicit grading, horrifically is inherently stronger, i.e. \"more intense\", than terribly.\n\nAccording to Bolinger (1972), -ly intensifying adverbs are \"relatively ungrammaticized\" elements, while degree words are \"relatively grammaticized\". Bolinger does not explicitly mention the criteria used for establishing this distinction; yet, two criteria seem to have been taken into account: (i) frequency and (ii) semantic content. Cacchiani (2009: 234) refines Bolinger's (1972) classification and identifies four levels of grammaticalization/delexicalization of intensifying adverbs depending on width of collocation, as well as on style and register restrictions: (i) highly grammaticalized intensifiers like highly (synonym of very - the intensifier par excellence), which collocates widely but is still subject to register restrictions; (ii) relatively less grammaticalized intensifiers (e.g. \"fabulously wealthy\"); (iii) colexicalized intensifiers, which typically occur in strong collocations (semantic-featurecopying intensifiers like \"doggedly determined\"); (iv) lexicalized intensifiers, which still retain their original meaning (e.g. \"shockingly underpaid\").\n\nIn our opinion, the main criteria which may be considered when evaluating the degree of grammaticalization of the intensifying adverbs are: semantic modification, syntactic specialization and frequency. Thus, we may say that the more established the intensifier is, the lower the semantic content of the intensifier is, and the more restricted the syntactic environment in which it might occur3. This means that the less meaning the intensifier carries on its own, the more it will require from its surrounding context (Greenbaum 1974: 80-82).\n\n4. From predicational to intensifying adverbs: a semantic and syntactic shift\n\nVirtually, any adverb modifying an adjective tends to have or to develop an intensifying meaning:\n\nIt is a simple matter to invent. For instance, if the word \"burgeoningly\" has ever been used as an intensifier I am unaware of it, but if one were to hear \"She's a burgeoningly healthy girl\", it would be taken as a normal hyperbolic intensifier (Bolinger 1972: 23).\n\nHowever, as shown below, only certain types of adverbs can change their syntactic status and acquire an intensifying role. Our attempt of describing such a semantic and syntactic shift is based on Ernst's (2000: 80, 2002: 96) classification of adverbs into functional (quantitative) vs. predicational (lexical/qualitative) adverbs.\n\nAccording to Ernst (2000: 84-96), most English predicational adverbs have the following properties:\n\na. they come from open classes4;\n\nb. they are composed of an adjective stem and -ly;\n\nc. they take a proposition, fact, or event as one of their arguments;\n\nd. they show the clausal/manner pattern of homonymous readings (1a/b, 2a/b)5:\n\n(1) a. Frankly, they won't speak to her.\n\nb. They won't speak to her frankly.\n\n(2) a. Strangely, Nikki was holding it.\n\nb. Nikki was holding it strangely.\n\n(examples from Ernst 2000: 84);\n\ne. they are lexical (i.e. not functional);\n\ni. they are subjective6.\n\nAs regards the interrelation predicational adverbs - intensifying adverbs, we would underline the following aspects: (i) boosters form an open class as they \"rely\" on the open class of predicational adverbs; (ii) the expressivity of boosters depends on the lexical content of the predicational adverbs which they have been derived from; (iii) the clausal/manner pattern of homonymous readings (1a/b, 2a/b) can be easily extended to an intensifying meaning, as in \"frankly hostile\", \"strangely clamorous\". Of great importance for the analysis of intensifying adverbs is, in our opinion, Ernst's (2000: 96) conclusion on the distribution of adverbs:\n\nThus, to conclude, I have proposed that we can correlate one aspect of the distribution of adverbs with a particular semantic property. The property is that of being a \"subjective\" adverb, one which maps an event or proposition onto a scale with a degree of indeterminacy and context-dependence.\n\n5. Romanian contra English intensifying adverbs\n\nAll English maximizers have formal equivalents (i.e. one-to-one/word-forword corresponding forms)7 in Romanian: adverbs obtained through conversion from adjectives indicating the idea of completeness/totality: absolutely quiet/ \"absolut linistit\", completely independent/ \"complet independent\", perfectly clear/ \"perfect clar\", wholly irresponsible/ \"total iresponsabil\".\n\nOn the other hand, only few Romanian adverbs may function as boosters of adjectives (adverbs) in an identical syntactic structure to the English one. It is the case of some semantically related gradual-quantitative adverbs like \"grav\" (severely), \"serios\" (seriously), \"rau/greu\" (badly), \"intens\" (intensely), \"profund\" (profoundly), \"adÃ¢nc\" (deeply), \"accentuat\" (emphatically), etc.:\n\n(1) \"un fragment de viata intens semnificativ\"/an intensely significant life fragment\n\n(2) \"este profund autohtona\"/it is profoundly aboriginal\n\n(3) \"versuri accentuat parodistice\"/emphatically parodistic verse\n\n(examples from Pana Dindelegan 1992: 93)\n\nSome Romanian adverbs in -mente8, such as \"realmente\" (really), \"literalmente\" (literally), \"eminamente\" (eminently) may function in a similar way, too: really dangerous/ \"realmente periculos\"; literally crazy/ \"literalmente nebun\"; eminently preferable/ \"eminamente preferabil\". We would also note that the adverbs \"completamente\" and \"totalmente\" are used as variants of maximizers \"complet\" and \"total\", respectively.\n\nThe Romanian adverbial counterparts of the English boosters are normally linked to the adjective (or to another adverb) by means of the preposition \"de\" (Fr. de; En. of), in a syntactic structure of the type: \"adverb + preposition de + adjective/adverb\".\n\nFrom a morphological point of view, most adverbial determiners which appear in the structure \"adverb + de + adjective\" are conversions of adjectives. Actually, as Mihai (1963) notes9, such words function primarily as adjectives but may occur as adverbs as well: \"adÃ¢nc\" (deep/deeply), \"cumplit/teribil\" (terrible/terribly), \"dureros\" (painful/painfully), \"groaznic\" (horrible/horribly), \"brutal\" (brutal/brutally), \"extraordinar\" (extraordinary/extraordinarily), \"minunat\" (wonderful/wonderfully), \"surprinzator\" (surprising/surprisingly), etc. Some other adverbial determiners are supine forms containing the negative prefix ne-: \"neasteptat\" (unexpectedly), \"neÃ®nchipuit\" (unimaginably), \"nesperat\" (unhopefully), \"nesuferit\" (insufferably).\n\nThese adverbs are semantically heterogeneous. According to Pana Dindelegan (1992: 91-111), they can be grouped into four classes: (i) gradualquantitative/qualitative adverbs, (ii) non-gradual adverbs, (iii) evaluative adverbs derived from subjective verbs, and (iv) adverbs acquiring doxastic epistemic meanings. We would remark that the constructions (ii)-(iv) convey a gradual reading indirectly: semantically, the adverbial determiner becomes a consequence/result of the degree to which an object possesses a certain quality/characteristic (Pana Dindelegan 1992: 94-100)10. The intensive sense may, consequently, be decomposed by means of the adverbial correlative \"atÃ¢t de\" (so):\n\n(1) \"ochi fascinant de adÃ¢nci\" (fascinatingly deep eyes)\n\n\"Ochii ei sunt atÃ¢t de adÃ¢nci, Ã®ncÃ¢t ma fascineaza\".\n\nHer eyes are so deep, that they fascinate me.\n\n(example from Pana Dindelegan 1992: 96)\n\n(i) Gradual-quantitative adverbs usually indicate: the maximum degree of a quantity (e.g. colossally unwise/ \"colosal de neÃ®ntelept\"; infinitely irritating/ \"infinit de iritant\"; immensely successful/ \"imens de prosper\"), exceeding a certain limit (e.g. excessively polite/ \"excesiv de politicos\"; exaggeratedly timid/ \"exagerat de timid\") or the maximum distance towards a reference point (e.g. extremely powerful/ \"extrem de puternic\").\n\nSome adverbs suggest a gradual-qualitative assessment - either positive: \"desavÃ¢rsit de\" (utterly), \"extraordinar de\" (extraordinarily), \"reamarcabil de\" (remarkably), \"fantastic de\" (fantastically), \"formidabil de\" (formidably), \"uimitor de\" (astonishingly), \"minunat de\" (wondefully), \"considerabil de\" (considerably) - or negative: \"cumplit de\" (awfully), \"groaznic/grozav de\" (terribly), \"tulburator de\" (disturbingly), \"socant de\" (shockingly), \"infernal de\" (infernally), \"oribil de\" (horribly), \"brutal de\" (brutally), \"terific de\" (terrifically), \"ciudat de\" (oddly):\n\n(1) astonishingly simple way (\"cale uimitor de simpla\")\n\n(2) disturbingly accurate (\"tulburator de precis\")\n\n(examples from CCELD)\n\nGradual-qualitative determiners introduce the idea of an implicit comparison \"anormal de\" (abnormally), \"nefiresc de (unnaturally)\", \"neobisnuit de\" (unusually), \"nemaipomenit de\" (uncommonly), \"deosebit de\" (particularly):\n\n(3) unusually harsh winter (\"iarna neobisnuit de grea\")\n\n(example from CCELD)\n\nThis type of construction is highly productive in both literary and colloquial registers, being more often used in spoken language. However, there is a number of gradual adverbs which cannot enter it \"out of reasons that the internal history of language would not reveal\" (Pana Dindelegan 1992: 93). For instance, some gradual quantitative determiners indicating the maximum degree of a quantity (e.g. \"urias\"/hugely,\"titanic\"/titanically, \"masiv\"/massively, \"gigantic\"/gigantically, \"vast\"/vastly, etc.), do not admit an adjectival or adverbial head:\n\n(4) * \"urias de mare\" (hugely large)\n\n(example from Pana Dindelegan 1992: 93)\n\nIn order to render such English adverbial modifiers into Romanian, any synonymic adverb which is able to appear in the structure \"adverb + preposition de + adjective/adverb\" can be used. The degree word \"foarte\" (very), as well as its expressive synonyms - \"tare\" and \"foarte\" - may represent alternative solutions. In the following examples we shall indicate the equivalents proposed in Levitchi (2005):\n\n(5) hugely vulnerable\n\n\" enorm de/extraordinar de/foarte vulnerabil\" (* urias de vulnerabil)\n\n(6) vastly different\n\n\" considerabil de/enorm de/grozav de/foarte diferit\" (* vast de diferit)\n\n(examples from CCELD)\n\nWe would also remark that most English-Romanian dictionaries do not contain entries such as gigantically (\"gigantic\"), titanically (\"titanic\"), or massively (\"masiv\"), which may demonstrate the low incidence of the Romanian corresponding forms:\n\n(7) gigantically violent\n\nextrem de violent (* gigantic de violent)\n\n(8) massively popular\n\nextrem de popular (*masiv de popular)\n\n(examples from CCELD)\n\n(ii) Non-gradual adverbs are purely qualitative adverbs, such as \"bolnavicios\" (sickly), \"idiot\" (idiotically), \"incomod\" (uncomfortably), \"inuman\" (inhumanely), \"morbid\" (morbidly), \"stÃ¢njenitor\" (embarrassingly), \"periculos\" (dangerously), \"ridicol\" (ridiculously), \"suspect\" (suspectedly).\n\n(9) embarrassingly easy questions/ \"Ã®ntrebari stÃ¢njenitor de simple\"\n\n(10) dangerously low water level/ \"nivel al apei periculos de scazut\"\n\n(examples from CCELD)\n\n(iii) Evaluative adverbs derived from subjective verbs: semantically, the stem verbs express a subjective evaluation; syntactically, the selectional restriction [+Human] is placed on their objects.Two suffixes are generally used: -tor and -ant: \"dezgustator\" (disgustingly), \"Ã®ngrozitor\" (terrifyingly), \"surprinzator\" (surprisingly), \"uluitor\" (amazingly), \"exasperant\" (exasperatingly), \"alarmant\" (alarmingly), \"dezarmant\" (disarmingly), etc.\n\n(11) \"dezgustator de abstract\"/disgustingly abstract\n\n\"atÃ¢t de abstract a, Ã®ncÃ¢t ma dezgust a \"/so abstract, that it disgusts me\n\n(12) \"enervant de delicat\"/annoyingly delicate\n\n\"atÃ¢t de delicat, Ã®ncÃ¢t ma enerveaza \"/so delicate, that it annoys me\n\n(examples from Pana Dindelegan 1992: 98)\n\n(iv) Adverbs acquiring doxastic epistemic meanings are described by two types of modal operators: (1) epistemic operators (\"possibility\" and \"negated possibility\" within a doxastic modal attitude) and (2) evaluative operators (involving the subject's appraisal).This category comprises the situations below, the constructions in (b) and (c) being semantically equivalent (examples 17-22, from CCELD):\n\na. determiners derived from verbs, with the suffix -bil:\n\n(13) an admirably clear discourse/ \"un discurs admirabil de clar\"\n\n(14) regrettably disgusting symptoms/ \"simptome regretabil de neplacute\"\n\nb. determiners derived from verbs, with the suffix -bil and the negative prefix in:\n\n(15) incalculably large impact/ \"impact incalculabil de mare\"\n\n(16) incredibly hard work/ \"munca incredibil de grea\"\n\n(17) unbearably hot weather/ \"vreme insuportabil de calda\"\n\nc. supines with the negative prefix ne-:\n\n(18) unimaginably outrageous behaviour/ \"comportament neÃ®nchipuit de brutal\"\n\n(19) unutterably beautiful image/ \"imagine nespus de frumoasa\"\n\n(20) unexpectedly shrewd look/ \"privire neasteptat de patrunzatoare\"\n\n(21) insufferably well-pleased person/ \"om insuportabil de plin de sine\"\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nThe findings of this paper can be summarized as follows.\n\nThe class of maximizers includes a limited number of items, which form a morphologically and syntactically homogenous group: they are obtained from adjectives which denote the idea of 'totality', either by means of derivational suffixes (En. completely, totally) or through conversion (Ro. \"complet\", \"total\" etc). Maximizers have a relatively narrow lexical- semantic scope, modifying only 'limit' (\"either-or\") and 'extreme' (implicit superlatives) adjectives: En. perfectly true, absolutely huge; Ro. \"perfect adevarat\", \"absolute urias\". Besides the literal rendition of English maximizers, a number of synonymic adverbial phrases can be used in Romanian: \"Ã®n Ã®ntregime\", \"cu totul\", \"Ã®ntrutotul\", \"pe deplin\", \"cum nu se poate mai\". Such transpositions are generally used as alternatives to functional equivalents in order to highlight the expressive function of maximizers.\n\nBoosters belong to a semantically heterogeneous, very productive class. From a morphological point of view, Romanian adverbial boosters are derived directly from adjectives having the same form (masculine singular) as the qualifying adjectives. Since English is an adverbial language while Romanian is a partly adverbial language11, only few Romanian adverbs - like \"grav\" (severely), \"serios\" (seriously), \"rau/greu\" (badly), \"intens\" (intensely), \"profund\" (profoundly), \"adÃ¢nc\" (deeply), \"accentuat\" (emphatically) - can be used as \"complete\" word-for-word renditions of the English intensifying adverbs in a syntactically identical structure: [intensifying adverb + adjective] (e.g., seriously damaged - \"serios afectat\"); such Romanian intensifiers belong, to a large extent, to the class of words which qualify as both adjectives and adverbs. Some other Romanian intensifying adverbs in - mente like \"realmente\" (really), \"literalmente\" (literally), \"eminamente\" (eminently) can function in a similar syntactic way, too (e.g., En. literally crazy - Ro. \"literalmente nebun\").On the other hand, a considerable number of Romanian adjectives which may also occur as adverbs are converted in intensifying adverbs in a structure of the type [adverb + linker de + adjective/adverb]. This latter structure is very productive and it represents the largest booster-equivalent class in Romanian (e.g., extremely happy - \"extrem de fericit\", unimaginably beautiful view - \"vedere neÃ®nchipuit de frumoasa\")."
