Tudor Arghezi was a Romanian writer known for his poetry and children's literature. He was born in 1880 in Bucharest under the name Ion N. Theodorescu and adopted the pen name Tudor Arghezi. He had a prolific writing career spanning different genres and published in many literary magazines. Arghezi was part of the Bohemian intellectual circles in early 20th century Bucharest and collaborated with other prominent writers and artists. During World War I, he briefly collaborated with German occupying forces, for which he was imprisoned after Romania joined the Allies. After his release, Arghezi published several influential poetry and prose collections and became known as one of Romania's greatest modern poets.",
