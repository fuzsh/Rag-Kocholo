Most existing citation matching work is done on scientific literature. The goal of this paper is to present methods for performing citation matching on Sanskrit texts. Exact matching and approximate matching are the two methods for performing citation matching. The exact matching method checks for exact occurrence of the citation with respect to the textual corpus. Approximate matching is a fuzzy string-matching method which computes a similarity score between an individual line of the textual corpus and the citation. The Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm for local alignment, which is generally used in bioinformatics, is used here for calculating the similarity score. This similarity score is a measure of the closeness between the text and the citation. The exact- and approximate-matching methods are evaluated and compared. The methods presented can be easily applied to corpora in other Indic languages like Kannada, Tamil, etc. The approximate-matching method can in particular be used in the compilation of critical editions and plagiarism detection in a literary work.\n\nGuidelines for normalising Early Modern English corpora: Decisions and justifications\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArcher Dawn\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Corpora of Early Modern English have been collected and released for research for a number of years. With large scale digitisation activities gathering pace in the last decade, much more historical textual data is now available for research on numerous topics including historical linguistics and conceptual history. We summarise previous research which has shown that it is necessary to map historical spelling variants to modern equivalents in order to successfully apply natural language processing and corpus linguistics methods. Manual and semiautomatic methods have been devised to support this normalisation and standardisation process. We argue that it is important to develop a linguistically meaningful rationale to achieve good results from this process. In order to do so, we propose a number of guidelines for normalising corpora and show how these guidelines have been applied in the Corpus of English Dialogues.\n\nRelational Data Modelling of Textual Corpora: The Skaldic Project and its Extensions\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nWills, Tarrin Jon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSkaldic poetry is a highly complex textual phenomenon both in terms of the intricacy of the poetry and its contextual environment.

A text fragment entails another text fragment if, from the meaning of the former, one can infer the meaning of the latter. If such relation is bidirectional, then we are in the presence of a paraphrase. Automatically recognizing textual entailment relations captures major semantic inference needs in several natural language processing (NLP applications. As in many NLP tasks, textual entailment corpora for English abound, while the same is not true for more resource-scarce languages such as Portuguese. Exploiting what seems to be the only Portuguese corpus for textual entailment and paraphrases (the ASSIN corpus, in this paper, we address the task of automatically recognizing textual entailment (RTE and paraphrases from text written in the Portuguese language, by employing supervised machine learning techniques. We employ lexical, syntactic and semantic features, and analyze the impact of using semantic-based approaches in the performance of the system. We then try to take advantage of the bi-dialect nature of ASSIN to compensate its limited size. With the same aim, we explore modeling the task of recognizing textual entailment and paraphrases as a binary classification problem by considering the bidirectional nature of paraphrases as entailment relationships. Addressing the task as a multi-class classification problem, we achieve results in line with the winner of the ASSIN Challenge. In addition, we conclude that semantic-based approaches are promising in this task, and that combining data from European and Brazilian Portuguese is less straightforward than it may initially seem. The binary classification modeling of the problem does not seem to bring advantages to the original multi-class model, despite the outstanding results obtained by the binary classifier for recognizing textual entailments.\n\nCorpora from a sociolinguistic perspective Corpora sob uma perspectiva sociolinguÃ­stica\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTyler Kendall\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper, I consider the use of corpora in sociolinguistic research and, more broadly, the relationships between corpus linguistics and sociolinguistics. I consider the distinction between \"conventional\" and \"unconventional\" corpora (Beal et al. 2007a, b and assess why conventional corpora have not had more traction in sociolinguistics. I then discuss the potential utility of corpora for sociolinguistic study in terms of the recent trajectory of sociolinguistic research interests (Eckert under review, acknowledging that, while many sociolinguists are increasingly using more advanced corpus-based techniques, many are, at the same time, moving away from corpus-like studies. I suggest two primary areas where corpus developers, both sociolinguistic and non-, could focus to develop more useful corpora: Corpora containing a wider range of non-standard (spoken varieties and more flexible annotation and treatment of spoken language data.Neste artigo considero o uso de corpora na pesquisa sociolingÃ¼Ã­stica e, de modo mais geral, a relaÃ§Ã£o entre a linguÃ­stica de corpus e a sociolinguÃ­stica.

It provides a critical overview of key multimodal corpora that have been constructed over the past decade and presents a wish-list of future technological and methodological advancements that may help to increase the availability, utility and functionality of such corpora for linguistic research.Este artigo apresenta um balanÃ§o do estado da arte da linguÃ­stica de corpus multimodal e propÃµe a projeÃ§Ã£o de desenvolvimentos futuros nessa Ã¡rea.

We will present the reasons which support the very basic prosodic annotation of speech (prosodic boundaries as a means to obtain relevant data from the speech flow. Starting from our present knowledge about the distribution of speech acts types in spoken corpora, we will present the reasons why building corpora in accordance to a context variation strategy should expand our knowledge of pragmatics. Additionally, we will claim that prosody is the necessary interface between locutive and illocutive acts and we will show that a deeper prosodic analysis is necessary to grasp unknown speech act types from language usage. Finally, we will briefly sketch the main assumptions of the Language into Act Theory (CRESTI, 2000 which is dedicated to the link between prosody and pragmatics and helps make explicit core aspects of pragmatic knowledge.O objetivo deste artigo Ã© apresentar argumentos favorÃ¡veis a dois pontos relacionados ao estudo de corpora orais e pragmÃ¡tica: a no nÃ­vel da anotaÃ§Ã£o, os corpora devem garantir o processamento do fluxo discursivo em enunciados, baseando-se em chaves prosÃ³dicas, e oferecer fÃ¡cil acesso aos arquivos de som; b no nÃ­vel da amostragem, os corpora devem garantir a representatividade mÃ¡xima de variaÃ§Ã£o contextual, ao invÃ©s de variaÃ§Ã£o de falantes.

In practice, the use of thesauri is not sufficient to reduce variability in coding and thesauri are not suitable for computer processing. We think the automation of the coding task requires a conceptual modeling of medical items: an ontology. Our task is to help lung specialists code acts and diagnoses with software that represents medical knowledge of this concerned specialty by an ontology. The objective of the reported work was to build an ontology of pulmonary diseases dedicated to the coding process. To carry out this objective, we develop a precise methodological process for the knowledge engineer in order to build various types of medical ontologies. This process is based on the need to express precisely in natural language the meaning of each concept using differential semantics principles. A differential ontology is a hierarchy of concepts and relationships organized according to their similarities and differences. Our main research hypothesis is to apply natural language processing tools to corpora to develop the resources needed to build the ontology. We consider two corpora, one composed of patient discharge summaries and the other being a teaching book. We propose to combine two approaches to enrich the ontology building: (i) a method which consists of building terminological resources through distributional analysis and (ii) a method based on the observation of corpus sequences in order to reveal semantic relationships. Our ontology currently includes 1550 concepts and the software implementing the coding process is still under development. Results show that the proposed approach is operational and indicates that the combination of these methods and the comparison of the resulting terminological structures give interesting clues to a knowledge engineer for the building of an ontology.\n\nProposed Framework for the Evaluation of Standalone Corpora Processing Systems: An Application to Arabic Corpora\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAbdulmohsen Al-Thubaity\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Despite the accessibility of numerous online corpora, students and researchers engaged in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP, corpus linguistics, and language learning and teaching may encounter situations in which they need to develop their own corpora. Several commercial and free standalone corpora processing systems are available to process such corpora. In this study, we first propose a framework for the evaluation of standalone corpora processing systems and then use it to evaluate seven freely available systems. The proposed framework considers the usability, functionality, and performance of the evaluated systems while taking into consideration their suitability for Arabic corpora. While the results show that most of the evaluated systems exhibited comparable usability scores, the scores for functionality and performance were substantially different with respect to support for the Arabic language and N-grams profile generation. The results of our evaluation will help potential users of the evaluated systems to choose the system that best meets their needs. More importantly, the results will help the developers of the evaluated systems to enhance their systems and developers of new corpora processing systems by providing them with a reference framework.\n\nProposed framework for the evaluation of standalone corpora processing systems: an application to Arabic corpora.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAl-Thubaity, Abdulmohsen; Al-Khalifa, Hend; Alqifari, Reem; Almazrua, Manal\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDespite the accessibility of numerous online corpora, students and researchers engaged in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), corpus linguistics, and language learning and teaching may encounter situations in which they need to develop their own corpora.

It highlights the fact that within the wide spectrum of corpus linguistic methodology, historical corpus linguistics has emerged as a vibrant field that has significantly added to the appeal felt for the study of language history and change. In fact, according to a historical linguist with more than fifty years of experience, \"[w]e could even go as far as to say that without the support and new impetus provided by corpora, evidence-based historical linguistics would have been close to the end of its life-span in these days of rapid-changing life and research, increasing competition on the academic career track and the methodological attractions offered to young scholars\" (RISSANEN, forthcoming. Historical corpora and other electronic resources have also made the study of language history attractive: working on them engages students in an individual and interactive way that they find appealing (CURZAN 2000, p. 81.Este artigo objetiva fazer um levantamento e avaliar o estado da arte dos corpora histÃ³ricos eletrÃ´nicos e da metodologia de estudos de corpora, assim como sugerir possÃ­veis desenvolvimentos futuros na Ã¡rea.

O trabalho apresenta uma discussÃ£o sobre o papel de corpora na traduÃ§Ã£o, sua aplicabilidade na formaÃ§Ã£o profissional, e sua importÃ¢ncia para o melhor conhecimento da constituiÃ§Ã£o da linguagem. SÃ£o oferecidos dois exemplos de anÃ¡lises, detalhadas a fim de serem aplicÃ¡veis em contextos em que haja poucos recursos de infraestrutura.

The paper presents a discussion on the role of corpora in translation, their applicability in professional development, and their importance in leading to a better understanding of how language is constituted. Two example analyses are offered and detailed, so that they are applicable to contexts in which computational resources are scarce. The analyses center around the linguistic choices in a translated newspaper text and in the Brazilian version of a slogan from an American advertising campaign. It is suggested that these activities may be carried out with translation students, in such a way that they enable students, while they explore electronic corpora, to become aware of both the complexity and the specificity of the linguistic choices involved in the process of translation.\n\nLDC Arabic Treebanks and Associated Corpora: Data Divisions Manual\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nDiab, Mona; Habash, Nizar; Rambow, Owen; Roth, Ryan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) has developed hundreds of data corpora for natural language processing (NLP) research. Among these are a number of annotated treebank corpora for Arabic. Typically, these corpora consist of a single collection of annotated documents. NLP research, however, usually requires multiple data sets for the purposes of training models, developing techniques, and final evaluation. Therefore it becomes necessary to divide the corpora used into the required data sets...\n\nAutomatic Dictionary Expansion Using Non-parallel Corpora\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRapp, Reinhard; Zock, Michael\n\nAutomatically generating bilingual dictionaries from parallel, manually translated texts is a well established technique that works well in practice. However, parallel texts are a scarce resource. Therefore, it is desirable also to be able to generate dictionaries from pairs of comparable monolingual corpora. For most languages, such corpora are much easier to acquire, and often in considerably larger quantities. In this paper we present the implementation of an algorithm which exploits such corpora with good success. Based on the assumption that the co-occurrence patterns between different languages are related, it expands a small base lexicon. For improved performance, it also realizes a novel interlingua approach. That is, if corpora of more than two languages are available, the translations from one language to another can be determined not only directly, but also indirectly via a pivot language.\n\nOvercoming Legal Limitations in Disseminating Slovene Web Corpora\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTomaÅ¾ Erjavec\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Web texts are becoming increasingly relevant sources of information, with web corpora useful for corpus linguistic studies and development of language technologies. Even though web texts are directly accessable, which substantially simplifies the collection procedure compilation of web corpora is still complex, time consuming and expensive. It is crucial that similar endeavours are not repeated, which is why it is necessary to make the created corpora easily and widely accessible both to researchers and a wider audience. While this is logistically and technically a straightforward procedure, legal constraints, such as copyright, privacy and terms of use severely hinder the dissemination of web corpora. This paper discusses legal conditions and actual practice in this area, gives an overview of current practices and proposes a range of mitigation measures on the example of the Janes corpus of Slovene user-generated content in order to ensure free and open dissemination of Slovene web corpora.\n\nFrom Annotated Multimodal Corpora to Simulated Human-Like Behaviors\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nRehm, Matthias; AndrÃ©, Elisabeth\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMultimodal corpora prove useful at different stages of the development process of embodied conversational agents. Insights into human-human communicative behaviors can be drawn from such corpora. Rules for planning and generating such behavior in agents can be derived from this information....... And even the evaluation of human-agent interactions can rely on corpus data from human-human communication. In this paper, we exemplify how corpora can be exploited at the different development steps, starting with the question of how corpora are annotated and on what level of granularity.

Starting with a survey of corpus use within corpus-based translation studies, the didactic value of corpora in the translation classroom and their epistemic value in translation teaching and practice will be elaborated. A typology of translation practice-oriented corpora will be presented, and the use of corpora in translation will be positioned within two general models of translation competence. Special consideration will then be given to the design and application of so-called Do-it-yourself (DIY corpora, which are compiled ad hoc with the aim of completing a specific translation task. In this context, possible sources for retrieving corpus texts will be presented and evaluated and it will be argued that, owing to time and availability constraints in real-life translation, the Internet should be used as a major source of corpus data. After a brief discussion of possible Internet research techniques for targeted and quality-focused corpus compilation, the possible use of the Internet itself as a macro-corpus will be elaborated. The article concludes with a brief presentation of corpus use in translation teaching in the MA in Specialised Translation Programme offered at Cologne University of Applied Sciences, Germany.\n\nUse of monolingual and comparable corpora in the classroom to translate adverbial connectors\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBeatriz SÃ¡nchez CÃ¡rdenas\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Research in terminology has traditionally focused on nouns. Considerably less attention has been paid to other grammatical categories such as adverbs. However, these words can also be problematic for the novice translator, who tends to use the translation correspondences in bilingual dictionaries without realizing that formal equivalence is not necessarily the same as textual equivalence. However, semantic values, acquired in context, go far beyond dictionary meaning and are related to phenomena such as semantic prosody and preferences of lexical selection that can vary, depending on text type and specialized domain. This research explored the reasons why certain adverbial discourse connectors, apparently easy to translate, are a source of translation problems that cannot be easily resolved with a bilingual dictionary. Moreover, this study analyzed the use of parallel corpora in the translation classroom and how it can increase the quality of text production. For this purpose, we compared student translations before and after receiving training on the use of corpus analysis tools\n\nUsing Monolingual and Bilingual Corpora in Lexicography\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMiangah, Tayebeh Mosavi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nConstructing and exploiting different types of corpora are among computer applications exposed to the researchers in different branches of science including lexicography.

In the field of multilingual NLP (such as machine translation and terminology mining) this implied the use of parallel corpora. However, parallel resources are relatively scarce: many more texts are produced daily by native speakers of any given language than translated. This situation resulted in a natural drive towards the use of comparable corpora, i.e. non-parallel texts in the same domain or genre. Nevertheless, this research direction has not produced a single authoritative source suitable for researchers and stu\n\nCorpora and Language Assessment: The State of the Art\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPark, Kwanghyun\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis article outlines the current state of and recent developments in the use of corpora for language assessment and considers future directions with a special focus on computational methodology.

This corpus stylistics approach makes it possible to map texts according to their word usage and to identify quantitative keywords which provide vocabulary profiles through comparison and contrast with contemporary male and female canonical texts. Items identified include pronouns, markers of dialogue and of intensity; others can be grouped into specific lexical fields such as feelings. One text from the collection then forms the object of a case-study to explore a paradox: although Jane Taylorâs use of vocabulary in her 1817 Rachel appears the most representative of the corpus made up of 42 novels by women, this Chawton text has been called âa highly original tale.â Methodology and findings are both presented to address the challenge of identifying features which constitute typicality.\n\nLinguistic Corpora and Lexicography.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeijs, Willem\n\n1996-01-01\n\nOverviews the development of corpus linguistics, reviews the use of corpora in modern lexicography, and presents central issues in ongoing work aimed at broadening the scope of lexicographical use of corpus data.

The glands were manipulated in vivo and removed to determine the effect by in vitro radiochemical assay for juvenile hormone synthesis. Corpora allata were also treated with putative regulatory factors in vitro. During the final stadium the corpora allata were inhibited both by nerves and by humoral factors. Neural inhibition was shown by an increase in juvenile hormone synthesis following denervation of the corpora allata. This operation elicited an extra larval instar. Humoral inhibition was shown by the decline in juvenile hormone synthesis of adult female corpora allata following transplantation into final instar larval hosts, and conversely the increase in juvenile hormone synthesis by larval corpora allata following implantation into adult females. Humoral inhibition was prevented by decapitation of larvae prior to the head critical period for molting and restored by implantation of a larval brain, showing that the brain is the source of this inhibition\n\nPictorial, Textual, and Picto-Textual Glosses in E-Reading: A Comparative Study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShalmani, Hamed Babaie; Sabet, Masoud Khalili\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis research explored the effects of three types of multimedia glosses on the reading comprehension of learners in an EFL context.

Faced with a large amount of textual data collected in marketing surveys, literary investigations, historical archives and documentary data bases, these researchers require assistance with organizing, describing and comparing texts. Exploring Textual Data demonstrates how exploratory multivariate statistical methods such as correspondence analysis and cluster analysis can be used to help investigate, assimilate and evaluate textual data.

A collocation list contains the collocations for selected words in corpora together with concordances for those words. As corpora become more available to metaphor researchers, there is a growing need for developing ways to gain access to as much data as the corpus can offer. The research described here has hopefully come some way toward meeting the challenges of developing tools for metaphor corpus research. Results suggest that the collocation lists seem to be a good pre-processing instrument for corpus research of metaphor, despite accuracy problems.Este trabalho apresenta uma pesquisa sobre o uso de listas de colocaÃ§Ãµes como instrumentos para detecÃ§Ã£o de metÃ¡foras em corpora.

For the purposes of this investigation, a segment is defined as a contiguous portion of written text consisting of at least two sentences. The segmentation procedure developed for the study is called LSM (link set median, which is based on the identification of lexical repetition in text. The data analysed in this investigation were three corpora of 100 texts each. Each corpus was composed of texts of one particular genre: research articles, annual business reports, and encyclopaedia entries. The total number of words in the three corpora was 1,262,710 words. The segments inserted in the texts by the LSM procedure were compared to the internal section divisions in the texts. Afterwards, the results obtained through the LSM procedure were then compared to segmentation carried out at random. The results indicated that the LSM procedure worked better than random, suggesting that lexical repetition accounts in part for the way texts are segmented into sections.O objetivo da pesquisa apresentada Ã© relatar um mÃ©todo baseado em corpus para anÃ¡lise de discurso que se baseia na noÃ§Ã£o de segmentaÃ§Ã£o, isto Ã©, a divisÃ£o de textos em porÃ§Ãµes coesas.

She examines semantics differently in connection with contrastive studies where the description must necessary go from the meaning towards the linguistic form, whereas in traditional contrastive studies the description proceeded from the form towards the meaning. This requirement regarding theoretical contrastive studies necessitates construction of a semantic interlanguage, rather than only singling out universal semantic categories expressed with various language means. Such studies can be strongly supported by parallel corpora. However, in order to make them useful for linguists in manual and computer translations, as well as in the development of dictionaries, including online ones, we need not only formal, often automatic, annotation of texts, but also semantic annotation - which is unfortunately manual. In the article we focus on semantic annotation concerning time, aspect and quantification of names and predicates in the whole semantic structure of the sentence on the example of the âPolish-Bulgarian-Russian parallel corpusâ.\n\nLa busqueda textual por computadora (Textual Search by Computer)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDavison, Ned J.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nDescribes the use of the computer program EDIT for textual searches to locate a certain programmed word or word root.

The binding sites for /sup 125/I-labeled human follicle-stimulating hormone (/sup 125/I-hFSH) were identified in the granulosa cells and in the newly formed corpora lutea. The /sup 125/I-labeled human luteinizing hormone (/sup 125/I-hLH) binding to the thecal cells increased during follicular maturation, and a dramatic increase was preferentially observed in the granulosa cells of the large preovulatory follicle. In the corpora lutea, the binding of /sup 125/I-hLH increased from the early luteal phase and decreased toward the late luteal phase. The changes in 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in the corpora lutea corresponded to the /sup 125/I-hLH binding. Thus, the changes in gonadotropin binding sites in the follicles and corpora lutea during the menstrual cycle may help in some important way to regulate human ovarian function.\n\nUsing corpora in scientific and technical translation training: resources to identify conventionality and promote creativity\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nClara InÃ©s LÃ³pez-RodrÃ­guez\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Since the first Corpus Use and Learning to Translate (CULT Conference in Bertinoro (Italy in 1997, the usefulness of corpora for translators and trainee translators has been highlighted.

Although LH and HCG were parallel in inhibiting 125 I-LH binding, HCG was found to be more effective. FSH did not inhibit binding. 2) Binding of 125 I-LH was dependent on time, temperature, 125 I-LH concentration, amount of the cell membrane fraction protein and pH. The highest binding was seen at pH 6.0 while incubating for 60 min at 37 0 C. 3) The number of LH receptors in human corpora lutea of the menstrual cycle increased towards midluteal phase, especiallt on 5th day from ovulation, and decreased towards late luteal phase. LH receptor was not found in corpus albicans. The apparent dissociation constant of each corpus luteum did not change throughout the menstrual cycle. 4) Corpora lutea of pregnancy contained a few or no receptors which bound 125 I-LH specifically. These data suggest that LH receptor is an important factor regulating the lifespan of corpus luteum and exogenous HCG has effect on luteal insufficiency, but the effect of HCG on threatened abortion is uncertain.

System logs collected on these systems are a valuable resource of information about their operational status and health. However, their massive size, complexity, and lack of standard format makes it difficult to automatically extract information that can be used to improve system management. In this work we propose a novel method to succinctly represent the contents of supercomputing logs, by using textual clustering to automatically find the syntactic structures of log messages. This information is used to automatically classify messages into semantic groups via an online clustering algorithm. Further, we describe a methodology for using the temporal proximity between groups of log messages to identify correlated events in the system. We apply our proposed methods to two large, publicly available supercomputing logs and show that our technique features nearly perfect accuracy for online log-classification and extracts meaningful structural and temporal message patterns that can be used to improve the accuracy of other log analysis techniques.\n\nCorrelation among foetal number, corpora lutea and plasma progesterone in rockland-swiss mice.

However, SVM is not suitable for classification of large datasets or text corpora, because the training complexity of SVMs is highly dependent on the input size. Recent developments in the literature on the SVM and other kernel methods emphasize the need to consider multiple kernels or parameterizations of kernels because they provide greater flexibility. This paper shows a multikernel SVM to manage highly dimensional data, providing an automatic parameterization with low computational cost and improving results against SVMs parameterized under a brute-force search. The model consists in spreading the dataset into cohesive term slices (clusters) to construct a defined structure (multikernel). The new approach is tested on different text corpora. Experimental results show that the new classifier has good accuracy compared with the classic SVM, while the training is significantly faster than several other SVM classifiers.\n\nPrimary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the corpora cavernosa presented as a perineal mass\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-SatuÃ© Carlos\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Primary male genital lymphomas may appear rarely in testis, and exceptionally in the penis and prostate, but there is not previous evidence of a lymphoma arising from the corpora cavernosa. We report the first case in the literature of a primary diffuse cell B lymphoma of the corpora cavernosa presented with low urinary tract symptoms, perineal pain and palpable mass. Diagnosis was based on trucut biopsy, histopathological studies and computed tomographic images.\n\nFrom the Problems of Dictionaries and Multi-lingual Corpora\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVioletta Koseska-Toszewa\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available From the Problems of Dictionaries and Multi-lingual Corpora The article describes the work on a number of dictionaries being developed by the Corpus Linguistics and Semantics Group of the Institute of Slavic PAS. They include âContemporary Bulgarian-Polish Dictionaryâ, âBulgarian-Polish Online Dictionaryâ and âRussian-Bulgarian-Polish Dictionaryâ. The dictionaries differ in the numbers of entries, as well as in the different degrees of their connection with parallel corpora being elaborated under the âClarinâ project. All the discussed dictionaries are similar with respect to their use of traditional, syntactic classifiers and of semantic classifiers, introduced for the first time in the existing lexicographical practice. Thanks to the âPolish-Bulgarian-Russian Corpusâ, the Group has managed to verify the results of contrasting Polish and Bulgarian in the light of scope-based logical quantification. Thanks to the Russian material added to the trilingual corpus, the researchers have managed to confirm the fact that from the viewpoint of âincomplete quantificationâ Russian and Polish (synthetic languages behave similarly, and are opposed to the analytic Bulgarian.\n\nStudies on luteinizing hormone receptors of human corpora lutea during menstrual cycle and pregnancy\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nIzumi, Yasushi (Keio Univ., Tokyo (Japan). School of Medicine)\n\n1982-10-01\n\nWith the purpose of explicating the lifespan of human corpora lutea, using human corpora lutea of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, binding of /sup 125/I-LH to the 20,000g cell membrane fraction was examined. 1) Specific bindings of /sup 125/I-LH, /sup 125/I-HCG were demonstrated in the 20,000g cell membrane fraction. Although LH and HCG were parallel in inhibiting /sup 125/I-LH binding, HCG was found to be more effective. FSH did not inhibit binding. 2) Binding of /sup 125/I-LH was dependent on time, temperature, /sup 125/I-LH concentration, amount of the cell membrane fraction protein and pH. The highest binding was seen at pH 6.0 while incubating for 60 min at 37/sup 0/C. 3) The number of LH receptors in human corpora lutea of the menstrual cycle increased towards midluteal phase, especially on 5th day from ovulation, and decreased towards late luteal phase. LH receptor was not found in corpus albicans. The apparent dissociation constant of each corpus luteum did not change throughout the menstrual cycle. 4) Corpora lutea of pregnancy contained a few or no receptors which bound /sup 125/I-LH specifically. These data suggest that LH receptor is an important factor regulating the lifespan of corpus luteum and exogenous HCG has effect on luteal insufficiency, but the effect of HCG on threatened abortion is uncertain.\n\nSelf-plagiarism and textual recycling: legitimate forms of research misconduct.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBruton, Samuel V\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe concept of self-plagiarism frequently elicits skepticism and generates confusion in the research ethics literature, and the ethical status of what is often called \"textual recycling\" is particularly controversial. I argue that, in general, self-plagiarism is unethical because it is deceptive and dishonest. I then distinguish several forms of it and argue against various common rationalizations for textual recycling. I conclude with a discussion of two instances of textual recycling, distinguishing them in terms of their ethical seriousness but concluding that both are ethically problematic.\n\nEffects of prostaglandin F2 alpha and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist on inositol phospholipid metabolism in isolated rat corpora lutea of various ages\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLahav, M.; West, L.A.; Davis, J.S.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe sensitivity of rat corpora lutea to luteolytic agents increases with luteal age. We examined the effect of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and [D-Ala6,Des-Gly10]GnRH ethylamide (GnRHa) on inositol phospholipid metabolism in day 2 and day 7 corpora lutea from PMSG-treated rats. Isolated corpora lutea were incubated with 32PO4 or [3H]inositol and were treated with LH, PGF2 alpha, or GnRHa. Phospholipids were purified by TLC, and the water-soluble products of phospholipase-C activity (inositol phosphates) were isolated by ion exchange chromatography. In day 2 corpora lutea, PGF2 alpha, (10 microM) and GnRHa (100 ng/ml) significantly increased 32PO4 incorporation into phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), but not into other fractions. LH provoked slight increases in PA. Results were similar with 30 min of prelabeling or simultaneous addition of 32PO4 and stimulants. In other experiments, PGF2 alpha and GnRHa provoked rapid increases (1-5 min) in the accumulation of inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates. LH did not significantly increase inositol phosphate accumulation, but stimulated cAMP accumulation in 2-day-old corpora lutea. Inositol phospholipid metabolism was increased in day 7 corpora lutea compared to that in day 2 corpora lutea. This increase was associated with increased incorporation of 32PO4 into PA and PI and increased accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates. In day 7 corpora lutea, which are very sensitive to the luteolytic effect of PGF2 alpha, the PG-induced increase in PA labeling was small and inconsistent, whereas PI labeling was unaffected in 30-min incubations. GnRHa was without effect in such corpora lutea. LH, PGF2 alpha, or GnRHa did not increase inositol phosphate accumulation in 7-day-old corpora lutea. These studies demonstrate that the transformation of young (day 2) to mature (day 7) corpora lutea is associated with an increase in luteal inositol phospholipid metabolism\n\nUsing corpora in scientific and technical translation training: resources to identify conventionality and promote creativity\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nClara InÃ©s LÃ³pez-RodrÃ­guez\n\n2016-01-01\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5007/2175-7968.2016v36nesp1p88 Since the first Corpus Use and Learning to Translate (CULT) Conference in Bertinoro (Italy) in 1997, the usefulness of corpora for translators and trainee translators has been highlighted.

Emotion classification is used in user experience, product evaluation, national security, and tutoring applications. It attempts to detect the emotional content in the input text and based on different approaches establish what kind of emotional content is present, if any. Textual emotion classification is the most difficult to handle, since it relies mainly on linguistic resources and it introduces many challenges to assignment of text to emotion represented by a proper model. A crucial part of each emotion detector is emotion model. Focus of this paper is to introduce emotion models used for classification. Categorical and dimensional models of emotion are explained and some more advanced approaches are mentioned.\n\nTÃ©cnicas aplicadas al reconocimiento de implicaciÃ³n textual.\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHerrera, JesÃºs; PeÃ±as, Anselmo; Verdejo, Felisa\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTras establecer quÃ© se entiende por implicaciÃ³n textual, se expone la situaciÃ³n actual y el futuro deseable de los sistemas dirigidos a reconocerla.

It also explains some decisions taken regarding the compilation of the University of Valladolid Corpus of Written Scientific and Technical English and illustrates some uses of the corpus. In particular, it presents some tasks with concordances and defends that ESP students should be taught the niceties of lexical gender as it is a grammatical category with social and/or ideological implications.\n\nLaughter annotations in conversational speech corpora - possibilities and limitations for phonetic analysis\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nTruong, Khiet Phuong; Trouvain, JÃ¼rgen\n\nExisting laughter annotations provided with several publicly available conversational speech corpora (both multiparty and dyadic conversations) were investigated and compared.

Many existing corpora including literary texts were compiled for linguistic research interests and are often unsuitable for corpus stylistic purposes. The paper addresses three of the main problems: the absence of labelling of the texts for literary genre, the use of extracts, and the prevalence of linguistic periodisation schemes. C18P is a corpus of prose fiction designed specifically to address these issues. It traces the early development of the novel from 1700 up until the Victorian era. It can, for instance, be used for an analysis of the characteristic linguistic features of individual literary genres and forms. The following paper introduces the design of the corpus as well as some of its potential uses.\n\nTextual analysis and machine leaning: Crack unstructured data in finance and accounting\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLi Guo\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available In finance and accounting, relative to quantitative methods traditionally used, textual analysis becomes popular recently despite of its substantially less precise manner. In an overview of the literature, we describe various methods used in textual analysis, especially machine learning. By comparing their classification performance, we find that neural network outperforms many other machine learning techniques in classifying news category. Moreover, we highlight that there are many challenges left for future development of textual analysis, such as identifying multiple objects within one single document.\n\nRedundancy in electronic health record corpora: analysis, impact on text mining performance and mitigation strategies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCohen, Raphael; Elhadad, Michael; Elhadad, NoÃ©mie\n\n2013-01-16\n\nThe increasing availability of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and specifically free-text patient notes presents opportunities for phenotype extraction. Text-mining methods in particular can help disease modeling by mapping named-entities mentions to terminologies and clustering semantically related terms. EHR corpora, however, exhibit specific statistical and linguistic characteristics when compared with corpora in the biomedical literature domain. We focus on copy-and-paste redundancy: clinicians typically copy and paste information from previous notes when documenting a current patient encounter. Thus, within a longitudinal patient record, one expects to observe heavy redundancy. In this paper, we ask three research questions: (i) How can redundancy be quantified in large-scale text corpora? (ii) Conventional wisdom is that larger corpora yield better results in text mining. But how does the observed EHR redundancy affect text mining? Does such redundancy introduce a bias that distorts learned models? Or does the redundancy introduce benefits by highlighting stable and important subsets of the corpus? (iii) How can one mitigate the impact of redundancy on text mining? We analyze a large-scale EHR corpus and quantify redundancy both in terms of word and semantic concept repetition. We observe redundancy levels of about 30% and non-standard distribution of both words and concepts. We measure the impact of redundancy on two standard text-mining applications: collocation identification and topic modeling. We compare the results of these methods on synthetic data with controlled levels of redundancy and observe significant performance variation. Finally, we compare two mitigation strategies to avoid redundancy-induced bias: (i) a baseline strategy, keeping only the last note for each patient in the corpus; (ii) removing redundant notes with an efficient fingerprinting-based algorithm. (a)For text mining, preprocessing the EHR corpus with fingerprinting yields\n\nTextual appropriation in engineering master's theses: a preliminary study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEckel, Edward J\n\n2011-09-01\n\nIn the thesis literature review, an engineering graduate student is expected to place original research in the context of previous work by other researchers. However, for some students, particularly those for whom English is a second language, the literature review may be a mixture of original writing and verbatim source text appropriated without quotations. Such problematic use of source material leaves students vulnerable to an accusation of plagiarism, which carries severe consequences. Is such textual appropriation common in engineering master's writing? Furthermore, what, if anything, can be concluded when two texts have been found to have textual material in common? Do existing definitions of plagiarism provide a sufficient framework for determining if an instance of copying is transgressive or not? In a preliminary attempt to answer these questions, text strings from a random sample of 100 engineering master's theses from the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database were searched for appropriated verbatim source text using the Google search engine. The results suggest that textual borrowing may indeed be a common feature of the master's engineering literature review, raising questions about the ability of graduate students to synthesize the literature. The study also illustrates the difficulties of making a determination of plagiarism based on simple textual similarity. A context-specific approach is recommended when dealing with any instance of apparent copying.\n\nInduction of canine deciduoma in some reproductive stages with the different condition of corpora lutea.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNomura, K\n\n1997-03-01\n\nBitches were examined to see whether canine deciduoma could be induced at some reproductive stages with the different conditions of corpora lutea by inserting a silk suture into the uterine lumen. The bitches stimulated in the early and middle stages of diestrus or in unilateral pregnancy corresponding to these diestrous stages formed deciduoma at a high induction rate, however, no difference in the strength of decidual reaction between the pregnant and diestrous stages was recognized. On the other hand, no reaction could be seen in bitches in late diestrus, the late stage of unilateral pregnancy or the post partum repair phase in which stromal decidual cells similar to those of the rodentia can be seen. In already implanted uteri, however, no deciduoma was formed in the interplacental areas. Even though the corpora lutea were functional, new additional stimulations were not accepted at the interplacental area in which the uterine horn had already been influenced by fertilized ova. From these results, it was suggested that in the dog as well as the rodentia, the endometrium has to be under the influence of functional corpora lutea in order to form deciduoma.\n\nCombining Language Corpora with Experimental and Computational Approaches for Language Acquisition Research\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMonaghan, Padraic; Rowland, Caroline F.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHistorically, first language acquisition research was a painstaking process of observation, requiring the laborious hand coding of children's linguistic productions, followed by the generation of abstract theoretical proposals for how the developmental process unfolds.

At days 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 21 of pregnancy, the ovaries from 30 progestagen treated and 30 ewes cycling after cloprostenol injection were evaluated by ultrasonography and, thereafter, collected and processed for immunohistochemical evaluation of VEGF; blood samples were drawn for evaluating plasma progesterone. The progestagen-treated group showed smaller corpora lutea than cloprostenol-treated and lower progesterone secretion. The expression of VEGF in the luteal cells increased with time in the cloprostenol group, but not in the progestagen-treated group, which even showed a decrease between days 11 and 13. In progestagen-treated sheep, VEGF expression in granulosa-derived parenchymal lobule capillaries was correlated with the size of the luteal tissue, larger corpora lutea had higher expression, and tended to have a higher progesterone secretion. In conclusion, the current study indicates the existence of deleterious effects from exogenous progestagen treatments on progesterone secretion from induced corpora lutea, which correlate with alterations in the expression of VEGF in the luteal tissue and, this, presumably in the processes of neoangiogenesis and luteogenesis.

The use of both pictures and textual arguments in sun protection public service announcements were evaluated for their potentially beneficial effects on judgment, cognitive processing and persuasiveness. In a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design individuals were shown public service announcements that advocated the advantages of sun protection measures in different versions in which a picture was present or not present and a textual argument was present or not present. The 159 participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. In each condition, participants were shown 12 different public service announcements designed according to the condition. Participants judged each public service announcement on attractiveness, credibility, clarity of communication and the required amount of reflection. After the judgment task, they completed a questionnaire to assess knowledge, perceived advantages and disadvantages of sun protection and intended use of sun protection measures. Pictures enhanced attractiveness, but diminished comprehension. Textual arguments enhanced attractiveness, credibility and comprehension. Pictures as well as textual arguments increased knowledge of sun protection measures. Pictures and textual arguments in public service announcements positively influence the individual's perception of the advantages of sun protection methods and the advantages of their adoption.\n\nOntology-based retrieval of bio-medical information based on microarray text corpora\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHansen, Kim Allan; Zambach, Sine; Have, Christian Theil\n\nare exponentially growing, the text corpora are sparse and inconsistent in spite of attempts to standardize the format.
