        "text": "3 WHAT IS ENGAGEMENT?\n\nThe need to understand users and their interaction with technology motivated a turn towards user experience within HCI (McCarthy and Wright 2004). This was followed by a turn towards engagement (Bardzell et al. 2008). McCarthy and Wright write that understanding user experience is a task complicated by our own immersion in experience and an assumption of consistent interpretation (McCarthy and Wright 2004). Engagement is also a feature of our day-to-day language.\n\n3.1 Definitions of Engagement\n\nIn approaching a definition of engagement, the papers of this corpus draw on a diverse literature, including the origins of the concept in social and cognitive psychology, while also offering new conceptions. One hundred and two definitions of engagement were encountered across the 351 papers of this corpus. By explicit definitions, we refer to statements of the form “Engagement is…,” or similar. Several conceptions were cited on multiple occasions, the single most-cited being that of Sidner et al., encountered on six occasions:\n\nBy engagement, we mean the process by which two (or more) participants establish, maintain and end their perceived connection. This process includes: initial contact, negotiating a collaboration, checking that other is still taking part in the interaction, evaluating whether to stay involved, and deciding when to end the connection. (Sidner et al. 2004) (emphasis added)\n\nThis definition positions engagement as a component of social connection. Any explicit definition constitutes certain assumptions on the part of the author. Sidner et al., in this instance, explicitly cast engagement as a process composed of three distinct phases, a beginning, a period of sustention, and an end. These phases are then further divided into a series of user actions. This framing implicitly places the definition within the context of a conversation between at least two agents, where the user is cast as an active and receptive participant and engagement as a continuous, synchronous process with a clearly defined beginning and end. Established from the user's perspective and distinguishing discrete components of interaction, this definition lends itself to the development of autonomous and task-focused systems rather than to a single user's engagement with a screen-based interface for example.\n\nQuesenbury links engagement to the qualities of an interface:\n\nthe degree to which the tone and style of the interface makes the product pleasant or satisfying to use. (Quesenbury 2002) (emphasis added)\n\nO'Brien and Toms describe engagement as a quality of user experience with multiple component features:\n\nEngagement is a quality of user experiences with technology that is characterized by challenge, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, novelty, interactivity, perceived control and time, awareness, motivation, interest, and affect. (O'Brien and Toms 2008) (emphasis added)\n\nZyngier divides student engagement into behavioural, emotional, and cognitive components:\n\nStudent engagement is a mix of several components 1) Behavioural: persistence and participation, 2) Emotional: interest, value and valence, and 3) Cognitive: motivation, effort and strategy. (Zyngier 2008) (emphasis added)\n\nDouglas and Hargadon supply a definition of engagement with a distinct hedonic inclination, tied to the concepts of immersion, narrative flow and schema theory:\n\nThe pleasures of immersion stem from our being completely absorbed within the ebb and flow of a familiar narrative schema. The pleasures of engagement tend to come from our ability to recognize a work's overturning or conjoining conflicting schemas from a perspective outside the text, our perspective removed from any single schema. (Douglas and Hargadon 2000) (emphasis added)\n\nDobrian et al. describe engagement as a proxy for involvement and interaction:\n\nQualitatively, engagement is a reflection of user involvement and interaction. (Dobrian et al. 2013) (emphasis added)\n\nJaimes et al. define engagement in the context of social media, employing the language of captivation and motivation:\n\nEngagement defines the phenomena of being captivated and motivated: engagement can be measured in terms of a single interactive session or of a more long-term relationship with the social platform across multiple interactions. Thus, social media engagement is not just about how a single interaction unfolds, but about how and why people develop a relationship with a platform or service and integrate it into their lives. (Jaimes et al. 2011a) (emphasis added)\n\nLaurel ties engagement directly to an emotional state:\n\nEngagement refers to the (emotional) state of mind the user must attain to enjoy the representation, that is, a willing suspension of disbelief. (Laurel 1991) (emphasis added)\n\nContext Specific Definitions. This brief synopsis highlights the diverse language brought to bear on the topic of engagement and the importance of context in evaluating any definition. Technology itself is an important element of context, and engagement has been examined with respect to a diverse range of technologies (see Table 1). As motivations for, and the value of, particular definitions can vary by context, one approach to defining this highly versatile concept is to reduce its scope. A number of authors have chosen to do so by applying an appropriate prefix. Chilukuri and Indurkhya describe narrative engagement, a concept comprising narrative understanding, attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence (Chilukuri and Indurkhya 2011). Churchill writes “how about ‘vongagement’—for voluntary engagement? Or ‘invitagement’ for invited engagement? Or ‘partagement’ for participatory engagement?” (Churchill 2010). These distinctions are often key to the value of engagement as a concept.\n\nTechnology Mentions Online 76 Personal Computers 74 Mobile Devices 30 Robotics 22 Public Displays 17 Intelligent Virtual Agents 15 Sensors 14 Gaming Systems 8 Virtual Reality 8 Kiosks 6 Other 38 NA 59\n\nHowever, 65% of publications that address engagement do not provide a definition. This likely contributes to the persistent ambiguity surrounding the term. To more fully understand this diversity of interpretation, we turn to the theoretical foundations of engagement.\n\n3.2 Engagement Theory\n\nIn striving to understand engagement, researchers have looked to, and developed, a broad range of theory. This sample of the literature contained 372 theoretical frameworks (see Table 2), nets cast to ‘rationalize’ and ‘explain’ human–computer interaction (Popper 1959). Some frameworks focus primarily on engagement (O'Brien and Toms 2010b). Others on related concepts such as immersion (Carrigy et al. 2010) and involvement (Webster and Ahuja 2006).\n\nTheory Mentions Flow Theory 50 Motivation Theory 16 O'Brien and Tom's Model of Engagement 13 Sidner et al.’s Model of Engagement 9 Presence Theory 9 Play Theory 7 Self Determination Theory 6 Independent Television Commission Sense of Presence Inventory 6 ITiCSE Engagement Taxonomy 6 Technology Acceptance Model 5 Social Presence Theory 5 Immersion Theory 5 Activity Theory 4 Involvement Theory 4 Cognitive Load Theory 4 User Engagement Scale 3 Brown and Cairn's Model of Engagement 3 Media Equation Theory 3 Peter et al's Model of Engagement 3 Game Engagement Questionnaire 3 Active Learning Theory 3 Social Capital Theory 3 Richness Theory 2 Engagement Sampling Questionnaire 2 Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire 2 Michalowski et al.’s Model of Engagement 2 Kendon's F-Formation Theory 2 Ermi and Mayra's Model of Immersion 2 etc. .\n\nLevels of Theory. Discerning categories of engagement theory allows us to identify approaches to, and motivations, for the interpretation of the concept. Theories are often described as focused on micro (actor-focused) or macro (structure-focused) processes. Flow theory (Cowley et al. 2008), social presence theory (Choi et al. 2014), and cognitive load theory (Oviatt et al. 2008), among others, primarily possess a micro focus. These theories tend to construe engagement in terms of the nature and distribution of conscious focus. This facilitates the analysis of individual episodes of interaction and the inference of engagement as a state of experience.\n\nFlow theory is a prominent example of this perspective (Seah and Cairns 2008; Webster and Ahuja 2006). This theory posits the existence of a state of optimal and enjoyable experience characterised by a tractable challenge, immersion, control, freedom, clarity, immediate feedback, temporal insensitivity, and changes in one's sense of identity (Cowley et al. 2008). This framework provides a means of measuring flow, often employed as a synonym for engagement, through its component parts, as well as a target for would-be interaction designers, the flow state. One model of game experience adopted this state as the utility for the player (Cowley et al. 2008). This factored model presents engagement (flow) as demarcated and attainable through a balance of factors including challenge and skill.\n\nIn contrast, theories of motivation (Seddon et al. 2008), self-determination theory (Wiebe et al. 2014), and narrative theories (Douglas and Hargadon 2000) can be described as macro in nature. These frameworks tend to support higher-level analysis, reflecting aggregate, socio-structural, and temporal factors. Schema theory has been employed in the analysis of flow, engagement, and immersion in traditional and interactive narratives, for example (Douglas and Hargadon 2000). Macro perspectives feature in reflection on the use of mobile media technologies (Lai 2014), ethnographic analysis of users’ environmental engagement through in-car GPS systems (Leshed et al. 2008), and in Borgmann's critique of the pattern of modern life as “one of disengagement, in which technological devices might relieve us of tedious effort but do so at the expense of our engagement with the world” (Dindler et al. 2011; Leshed et al. 2008).\n\nCognitive, Emotional, and Behavioural Engagement. Is engagement cognitive, emotional, or behavioural? Several authors make these distinctions (Zyngier 2008; Bouta and Retalis 2013; Islas Sedano et al. 2013).\n\nInterpretations of engagement as cognitive in nature often focus on conscious components such as effort (Islas Sedano et al. 2013; Sun 2014), energy (Birnholtz et al. 2013), awareness, and attention (Islas Sedano et al. 2013). This interpretation renders engagement more easily quantified and is often accompanied by a focus on process and strategy (Bouta and Retalis 2013; Islas Sedano et al. 2013), as is the case with Fredricks et al.’s cognitive engagement scale that denotes “an individual's voluntary efforts to understand and master challenging tasks” (see Sun (2014)).\n\nEngagement has also been described as “primarily understood as an emotion” (Laurel 1991). Definitions of emotional or affective engagement tend to emphasise the subjective nature of experience, encompassing identification, belonging, values, attitudes, and emotions (Islas Sedano et al. 2013), reflected through expressions of interest, boredom, achievement orientation, values, and feelings (Bouta and Retalis 2013). Interpreting engagement in these terms supports the adoption of theories of emotion, of which there are many. One such interpretation describes engagement as a state of high valence and arousal on the circumplex model of emotion (Latulipe et al. 2011). Another locates engagement between boredom and stress “within a framework of arousal states” (Churchill 2010).\n\nA behavioural construal of engagement emphasises action and participation, promising more objective measurement (Asteriadis et al. 2009; Bouta and Retalis 2013; Islas Sedano et al. 2013). Bianchi-Berthouze et al. express the belief that the cognitive focus of many theories of engagement neglects the physical component (Bianchi-Berthouze et al. 2007). Studies of gameplay using the GuitarHero controller revealed a correlation between player engagement and physical movement. Movement appeared “not only to increase the players’ level of engagement but also to modify the way they get engaged” (Bianchi-Berthouze et al. 2007).\n\nConceptions of engagement can be divided along many lines, “academic, cognitive, intellectual, institutional, emotional, behavioural, social, and psychological” (Ting et al. 2013). These distinctions are not based on objective knowledge of engagement as a universal neurophysiological or social phenomenon but are made to facilitate a particular form of context-dependent analysis and design. These motivations reveal the ontological perspectives brought to bear on engagement.\n\nTrait, State, or Process. A key distinction among definitions of engagement is its interpretation as a trait, state, or process. These characterisations are almost always made implicitly and so merit closer examination.\n\nEngagement can be interpreted as trait based; a stable characteristic of persons or systems, a propensity to engage or be engaged. Cognitive absorption is one example of this interpretation, described as a user's “propensity to become absorbed in the activities around using a computer” in contrast to immersion, construed as a comparatively dynamic state (Seah and Cairns 2008). Within-person process and individual-difference structural theories of cognition have long been the subject of debate in personality psychology (Fleeson 2007). However, the role of personality with respect to engagement featured only rarely within this corpus (Bixler and D'Mello 2013; Cowley et al. 2008; Goldberg et al. 2011). Improved knowledge of individual patterns of engagement might support personalised, engaging experiences (Barco et al. 2014).\n\nEngagement is most frequently characterised as a variable state, ascribed to the user (O'Brien and Toms 2008), a system (Bohus and Horvitz 2009c), or to interaction itself (Deray and Simoff 2012). These conceptions tend to emphasise perception, reflection, and a responsive, dyadic form of interaction. One of the features of a discrete variable is the number of states it can adopt. The design of Pêle-Mêle, a multi-party video communications system, explored this choice with respect to engagement (Gueddana and Roussel 2006). The system's state of engagement is determined by the user's presence, motion, and distance. The view that systems should be designed to support variable degrees of engagement, and smooth transitions between these, merits wider adoption. Casting engagement as a dynamic state, whether discrete or continuous, is a reductive stance. This perspective facilitates measurement and modelling and also presents engagement as a finite resource, a form of conscious currency to be managed by human and machine in interaction.\n\nWhile characterising engagement as a dynamic state suggests a process of change, explicit consideration is given in the literature concerning its function as a process (O'Brien and Toms 2008). However, the processual nature of engagement is often lost in its operationalisation as a more easily measured discrete state. Very often, related concepts such as motivation are instead used in discussion of issues relating to the process of user engagement and disengagement (see Section 5.3). Description of engagement as a process enables the analysis of change over time and between interactions. One hybrid view of engagement describes a process of transition between different modes from physical to contemplative engagement (Dindler et al. 2011).\n\n5 MEASURING ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe variety of methods applied to the measurement of engagement speaks to the versatility of the concept (see Table 3). Subjectivity-oriented measures tend to target the perceptual and experiential nature of the concept. Objectivity-oriented measures entail a reductive interpretation, often in the search for actionable data. The literature features many examples of both approaches to measurement including questionnaires, interviews, measures of outcomes, and digital behaviour logging.\n\nMeasure Applications Questionnaire 124 Behaviour Logging 69 Observation 44 Task Outcomes 26 Interview 23 Eye Tracking 19 Discussion 10 Electroencephalogram (EEG) 10 Audio Signal Analysis 8 Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) 8 Facial Analysis 7 Review 6 Head Pose 5 Physical Motion Tracking 5 Body Pose 4 Presence Detection 3 Electrocardiogram (ECG) 2 Heart Rate 2 fEMG 1 Gesture Tracking 1 Heat Flux 1 Pen Pressure 1 Pupil Diameter 1 Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) 1 Supraorbital Thermal Imaging 1 Temperature Monitoring 1 No Engagement Measure 106\n\n5.1 Subjectivity-Oriented Approaches\n\nSubjectivity-oriented measures include observation, questionnaires, interviews, and other forms of self-report. As with any methodology, the choice of these methods entails compromise. These approaches support rich description coloured by subjectivity, cognition, emotion, and memory.\n\nQuestionnaire Methods. Questionnaires are the most frequently applied measure of engagement (see Table 3). They are easily applied and can support detailed analysis (Brockmyer et al. 2009; O'Brien and Toms 2010b; Rozendaal et al. 2008; Seok and DaCosta 2012; Webster and Ahuja 2006). However, they are often retrospective in nature and yield a personally motivated and reconstructed perspective (Latulipe et al. 2011).\n\nThe development of the User Engagement Scale (UES) is one of the most thorough attempts to develop an understanding of user engagement within the literature (O'Brien and Toms 2010b). This questionnaire was informed by an initial conceptual framework for user engagement based on analysis of interviews held with 17 participants concerning their experiences with online shopping, searching, video games, and distance learning (O'Brien and Toms 2008). This framework describes engagement as a process comprised of four stages; a point of engagement, a period of sustained engagement, disengagement and re-engagement, with respect to a system that is “effective, efficient and satisfying.” The UES was further informed by a literature review, engagement described thereafter as:\n\nboth a process and product (Kappelman, 1995) of interaction; its intensity may change over the course of an interaction (Said, 2004) depending on the combination of users’ needs, goals, emotions, actions, and thoughts, or the format (Chapman, 1997; Jacques, 1996), visual presentation, and organization of the computer interface (Quesenbury 2003). (O'Brien and Toms 2010b)\n\nAn initial evaluation study, comprising the responses of 440 participants regarding an online shopping experience, led to the reduction of the scale to 33 items distributed across six principal factors: Focused Attention, Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, Endurability, Novelty, and Felt Involvement (O'Brien and Toms 2010b). A second study, in which 802 participants completed the revised scale with respect to an online book purchase, identified relationships among these factors. It was found that aesthetics predicted perceived usability, focused attention predicted felt involvement and felt involvement predicted endurability. Subsequent analyses led to further refinements of this model (O'Brien and Toms 2010a, 2013; Wiebe et al. 2014).\n\nExperience Sampling Methods. Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) can capture changes in engagement through the repeated report of experience in the moment. These methods are particularly relevant to interpretations of engagement based around flow. The Engagement Sampling Questionnaire (ESQ) (Schoenau-Fog 2011) contains demographic, pre-experience and in-experience components, focused on user objectives, activities, accomplishment, and affect. Questions posed in-experience include a Likert-scale measure of continuation desire and a number of open questions. The ESQ has been applied as part of an iterative game design process (Schoenau-Fog et al. 2012) and in the development of the experiential game Aporia (Bevensee et al. 2012). An ESM approach was also employed to understand users’ engagement with an SMS-based pervasive mobile game (Fischer and Benford 2009). These measures construe engagement as a momentary concept, a feature of immediate experience, in contrast to retrospective questionnaires, for example, which often imply a reflective, multifaceted interpretation (Doherty and Doherty 2018).\n\nObservational Methods. A variety of methods have been employed to capture and describe the subjective experience of engagement. An ethnographic approach informed the development of a five-phase model of user engagement with public displays, comprising receptiveness, interest, evaluation, engagement, and disengagement (Glasnapp and Brdiczka 2009). Qualitative analysis identified immediate conversation, creative production, and reflective observation as dimensions of engagement with research videos (Caglio and Buur 2012).\n\nInferring Engagement from ‘Subjective’ Data. An important distinction among subjective measures is the degree to which prior assumptions bias the inference of engagement. Questionnaires, for example, often invite closed-ended responses and are therefore deductive rather than inductive. These choices are highlighted in the creation of engagement scales (Brockmyer et al. 2009; O'Brien and Toms 2010b; Rozendaal et al. 2008; Seok and DaCosta 2012; Webster and Ahuja 2006). The Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ), for example, interprets engagement as a “generic indicator of game involvement” incorporating immersion, presence, flow, psychological absorption, and dissociation (Brockmyer et al. 2009). While the User Engagement Scale (UES) measures focused attention, perceived usability, aesthetics, endurability, novelty, and felt involvement (O'Brien and Toms 2010b).\n\nMeasures of engagement are context-dependent. O'Brien and Toms, for example, state that the User Engagement Scale (UES) “incorporated effectiveness and satisfaction, but not efficiency. This makes sense since an engaged user may not be concerned about how much time they are spending” but it means that “some usability metrics, including time spent performing a task or examining a screen, may not be applicable” (O'Brien and Toms 2010b). Face validity can also indicate whether the questions posed by a particular scale relate coherently to the context of measurement. A scale developed by Konijn and Hoorn to measure involvement, for example, asks whether a figure “is appealing” and “makes me happy,” a highly context-dependent interpretation (van Vugt et al. 2007).\n\nOpen-ended methods can support an exploratory approach although lack the reliability and ease of application provided by questionnaires. Interviews can reveal “indications of engagement” for example, “reported as ‘awareness,’ ‘involvement,’ ‘immersion’ and so forth.” Instead of asking “were you engaged?,” participants can be asked to describe their experience (Swift et al. 2010).\n\n5.2 Objectivity-Oriented Approaches\n\nObjectivity-oriented measures attempt to infer engagement without recourse to direct questioning or human involvement. This includes such techniques as logging behaviour and interaction, psychophysiological measures, and audio and visual analysis. The advantage of these approaches lies in their ease of application, limited disruption of experience, and reduced user burden. We describe these measures as oriented towards objectivity, given their approximation of engagement through its observable features. However, all such measures are themselves imbued with a certain subjectivity, introduced through users’ awareness of observation and researchers’ experimental and interpretive choices.\n\nBehavioural Trace Measures. The choice of engagement measure has been described as a tradeoff between the scale of data capture and the depth of understanding (Baeza-Yates and Lalmas 2012). The simplest of measures adopt single variables as proxies of engagement, such as the number of mouse clicks on a web-page. These measures are often employed when access to users is limited, as in the case of e-publications (Lee et al. 2009), email spam exposure (Dasgupta et al. 2012), blog visitor engagement (Hennig et al. 2013), online networked user engagement (Lehmann et al. 2013a), online multitasking (Lehmann et al. 2013b), search engine engagement (Song et al. 2013) and analysis of the effects of links on networked user engagement (Yom-Tov et al. 2012), the impact of video quality (Dobrian et al. 2013), and online engagement as absence time (Dupret and Lalmas 2013).\n\nBehaviour logging approaches support the assessment of engagement at significant scales. Lehmann et al. collected data from two million users across 80 websites, according to three categories of engagement metrics: popularity, activity, and loyalty (Lehmann et al. 2012). These data allowed the authors to define five user types based on the number of days that included a visit to a site, to calculate the proportion of each user group per site and to cluster sites with similar user groups, extricating patterns of engagement (Lehmann et al. 2012).\n\nPsychophysiological Measures. Another broad category of measures which has been used to infer engagement are psychophysiological. Electrocardiography (ECG), heat flux (HF), and electroencephalography (EEG) measures have all been employed as proxies for engagement (Belle et al. 2011). Features of the signals produced by these methods enabled a binary classification of engagement trained on data captured while eight subjects viewed two 20-minute sets of 3- to 5-minute-long video clips, one set deemed engaging, the other not (Belle et al. 2011). This model achieved greater than 90% accuracy, precision, and recall. EEG measures have also been used to infer music engagement without interrupting the listening experience (Blankertz et al. 2010). Predictive models, based on EEG and motion-tracking data, achieved 67% engagement classification accuracy across-subjects and 85% accuracy within-subjects.\n\nAttempts have also been made to infer engagement from audio and video data. Ishii and Nakano measured conversational engagement between a user and a Wizard-of-Oz–controlled virtual agent in the role of a mobile phone salesperson by examining eye-tracking data, speech transcriptions, the virtual agent's gaze, and gestures as well as observed and user-reported judgements of user-attitude (Ishii and Nakano 2008). Analysis of these data revealed that engaged users behaved more cooperatively, redirecting their attention to a focused object when referred to by the agent (Ishii and Nakano 2010). Further research, incorporating head pose and topic change information, led to the development of a binary classification of engagement with an accuracy rate of 77.8% (using 10-fold cross validation) and a three-class model with an accuracy rate of 88.75% (Ooko et al. 2011). Proponents of these approaches have reported promising results. However, many studies have taken place in laboratory environs, narrow contexts of use and with small numbers of users (Bixler and D'Mello 2013; Cai and Lin 2012; Foster et al. 2013; Sanghvi et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2013), and so it is difficult to generalise initial findings.\n\nInferring Engagement from ‘Objective’ Data. Data from ‘objective’ sources offers several advantages. It can be captured at large scales without human involvement, has the potential to be gathered in an ambulatory fashion, and supports the action of autonomous systems. Reductive data can also lead to shallow interpretation, however, such as false attribution of causality, misleading timescale responsivity, and invalid generalisation. If a user spends a long time on a web-page, are they engaged or simply confused? (Birkett et al. 2011) Time spent searching for information can be “involving, but not in a pleasant way …just inefficient and frustrating” (Colbert and Boodoo 2011).\n\nMeasures are not always as ‘objective’ as we may assume. The ground truth against which these methods are evaluated is often derived by self-report, annotation, or expert ratings (Bonin et al. 2012; Sanghvi et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2013). Annotated gameplay video was employed as the ground truth for computer-vision-based models of affective posture and body motion in a study of engagement during chess games between children and the iCat robot (Sanghvi et al. 2011). When asked, annotators revealed, perhaps counter-intuitively, that they had associated less movement and an upright or backward leaning posture with higher levels of engagement and patterns of continuous movement and a forward leaning posture with lower levels of engagement. Another group of researchers, organising the annotation of individual and group engagement within a video corpus, imposed no constraints on observers, no timescales for annotation, and no definition of engagement (Bonin et al. 2012). When annotators were asked to describe their process, they stated that they concentrated mainly on “whether the subjects were speaking or not and on the body pose” to determine an individual's level of engagement (Bonin et al. 2012).\n\nThe perceptual and experiential nature of engagement is an important consideration in its measurement, regardless of method. We possess agency with respect to affective display, or perhaps more appropriately in this case engagement display. Although “an entity may have an interest in something, this is to be differentiated from the action of showing interest in it” (Peters et al. 2009). This is of particular importance when it is likely for participants to control their display of engagement, due to social facilitation, inhibition, or loafing effects, for example (Liu et al. 2011).\n\nWhile the act of observation alone can influence the display of engagement, many methods also interrupt experience (LeeTiernan and Grudin 2003). A distinction between implicit, “non-intrusive, pervasive and embedded,” and explicit measures is valuable in this respect (Corrigan et al. 2014). One study of human–robot interaction employed a questionnaire every minute in addition to measuring the repetition of errors and the speed at which users diverted their gaze to the robot and interface (Corrigan et al. 2014).\n\n5.3 Motivations for Adoption\n\nThe conception and measurement of engagement is interlinked and contingent on the motives of designers and researchers. From this corpus, we discern three key motivations for the adoption of engagement as follows:\n\nBasic Research Understanding Engagement\n\nDesign Practice Designing Engagement\n\nSystems Development Implementing Engagement\n\nThe first category comprises research focused on the development of generalised theories and models of engagement, often embodying psychological and social factors. This work goes beyond engagement with a particular designed object or process, studying its universal relevance. Examples include extensive models of user engagement (O'Brien and Toms 2008), socio-technological critique (McCarthy and Wright 2004; Leshed et al. 2008), and sociological analysis (Goffman et al. 1978).\n\nThe adoption of engagement has also been motivated by design practice. Engagement has been employed as a lens through which to analyse user experience with technology probes and as a concept in the design of user experiences. Patterns of engagement have been used to provide actionable insight into the design of technologies such as mobile games (Fischer and Benford 2009), learning systems (LeeTiernan and Grudin 2003), and websites (Colbert and Boodoo 2011).\n\nA third motivation rests on the capacity of engagement to mediate human behaviour and communication. Developers of autonomous systems have leveraged the role of engagement in interaction, approaching the concept with an eye to synthesis, not just analysis. This approach entails operationalising (translation from conception to signal), modelling (representation within a logical framework), and connecting measures of engagement to appropriate autonomous actions, as in research concerning cognitive assistance during driving (Cai and Lin 2012), the behaviour of a robot bartender (Foster et al. 2013), keystroke analysis during essay writing (Bixler and D'Mello 2013), attention to on-screen information (Asteriadis et al. 2009), and conversational agents (Nakano and Yamaoka 2009; Xu et al. 2013).\n\n5.4 Conclusion\n\nIn most cases, an understanding of engagement is best approached through the combination of subjective and objective measures (LeeTiernan and Grudin 2003; Stiubiener et al. 2012). The choice of methodology will depend on the research and design questions being asked (based on the motivation as discussed above), the context and ultimate goals of the system, the interpretation of engagement we choose in service of these, and the need for methodological validity and reliability.\n\n6 DESIGN STRATEGIES FOR ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe context of engagement research is broad (see Table 4). In this section, we outline strategies for the engagement of users identified through this corpus. These strategies draw together and build on related conceptions and motivations for the adoption of engagement and have often emerged within the context of a particular discipline. These strategies provide examples of how particular conceptions of engagement can be employed within a range of design contexts and may be useful to consider in new design projects.\n\nApplication Mentions Gaming 56 General Learning 32 Online Learning 27 Social Media 15 Classroom Learning 14 Distance Learning 8 Virtual Learning Environments 8 Gamification 7 Virtual Agents 6 Algorithm Visualisation 6 Online Networks 6 Online Search 5 Online Services 5 General Education 5 Website Use 5 Museum Exhibits 5 Website Design 5 Social Networks 4 Robotic Agents 4 eGovernment 4 IVA Salesperson 3 Presentations 3 Reading 3 Robotic Tutors 3 Programming 3 Online Shopping 2 Storytelling 2 Exercise Support 2 General Computer Use 2 Robotic Companions 2\n\n6.1 Ensuring Usability\n\nEngaging experiences are built on usable interaction. These systems satisfy the basic needs of use, are easy to use, are reliable, are learnable, and result in the effective use of users’ time and resources (O'Brien and Toms 2008).\n\nUsability. Although usability was studied infrequently within this sample, one study of an e-learning system for hospital patients ($n=281$) found that “the user's intention to continue usage was predominantly determined by satisfaction with the system and perceived performance” (Chou et al. 2012). A study of playability, usability and ‘long-term’ engagement in games found that engaging experiences can arise despite usability defects if those problems are limited in frequency and the Density of Usability Defects (DUD) is low (Febretti and Garzotto 2009).\n\nFeedback. Prompt and accurate feedback supports engagement. One study examined the impact of performance-related feedback and found that positive feedback motivated users to higher task performance (Fairclough et al. 2013). Negative feedback did not lead to disengagement, which the authors propose could be due to the abstract nature of the task and a lack of negative consequences for failure. As a study of user attitudes towards online social experiences found, “pressure to perform” can be “both a good thing and a bad thing” (Social Computing Research Group 2005). Another study manipulated the immediacy cues displayed by a humanlike robot as it told stories (Szafir and Mutlu 2012). Immediacy cues were defined as “actions taken by speakers to decrease the psychological distance between themselves and their listeners.” More adaptive, humanlike immediacy behaviours led to improved recall, as well as greater rapport and motivation among female participants (Szafir and Mutlu 2012).\n\nAesthetics. Given the ubiquity of high-quality games and other commercial systems, many users today also hold aesthetic expectations that may need to be met for engagement to ensue (van Vugt et al. 2007).\n\n6.2 Managing User Resources\n\nEngagement, as a measure of interaction, reflects both user and system performance. This has led to its adoption as a means of ‘managing’ interaction, through real-time adaptation to the user. This strategy is most relevant to well-defined tasks with measurable outcomes. The measurable proxies for engagement in these contexts are often cognitive in nature, examples being difficulty (Castellano et al. 2009), cognitive load (Oviatt et al. 2008), and workload (Galán and Beal 2012).\n\nChallenge, Cognitive Load, and Workload. One study tested the implicit use of speech amplitude and pen pressure to engage a computer assistant while reducing cognitive load (Oviatt et al. 2008). During a series of maths questions, 86% of intended interactions were correctly identified through speech and 75.2% by pen pressure, compared to human judgement. The reliability of the speech system also improved during the session. Users adapted their speech to the system, often unconsciously according to post-session interviews.\n\nAnother system used EEG measures of users’ engagement and workload to predict whether maths problems would be answered correctly (Galán and Beal 2012). Sixteen college students solved 8 maths problems (4 easy and 4 hard). A prediction accuracy of 87% was achieved using the ‘most informative’ signals from both data streams. Workload scores were significantly higher for more difficult problems, while engagement scores showed no change, suggesting that engagement and workload could be treated as independent variables.\n\nAnother study found that playing games via a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) introduced a higher workload than Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) control, although both systems rated below the median on the Game Engagement Questionnaire (Gürkök et al. 2011). Other work has adopted workload as a direct proxy for engagement, including a computational model to balance users’ task engagement (workload level) and automation (awareness level) (Klein and Van Lambalgen 2011), and a five-stage framework for the measurement of users’ cognitive engagement online, based on the concept of human mental workload (Longo 2011).\n\nMonitoring Engagement. When we talk about the measurement of engagement, often we are not talking solely of assessment for research but of processes that could come to form a part of users’ daily lives. It is therefore essential to consider the acceptability of user monitoring and to respect users’ privacy and autonomy. Systems designed to maintain user engagement often do so to optimise a particular outcome, “social interaction or efficiency of task completion,” for example (Akker et al. 2009). However, increased engagement does not necessarily “imply improved efficiency in terms of task performance and vice versa” (Akker et al. 2009). Specific outcomes require appropriate forms of engagement. A system for public feedback concerning public spaces was designed to engage users as “creative observers rather than mere information seekers,” for example (Whittle et al. 2010).\n\nAdaptive systems might not focus solely on the maintenance of engagement but also on signs of disengagement, discontinuities in interaction. Interruptibility has been examined with respect to task-focused systems, as in the development of an algorithm to interrupt programmers at the optimal moment (Fogarty et al. 2005). Adaptation to user performance must be informed by sufficient context. For example, if a user's engagement with a game drops “because the player is bored, then the appropriate response from the system is to challenge the player.” If the decline in engagement is due to “excessive game difficulty,” then this “requires a different adaptive response, e.g. to assist the player” (Fairclough et al. 2013).\n\n6.3 Immersing Users\n\nOne strategy for engaging users focuses on their immersion (deep psychological absorption) in experience through interaction.\n\nImmersion. Immersion is often adopted as a metonym of engagement, particularly in the contexts of gaming (Brown and Cairns 2004; Carrigy et al. 2010) and virtual environments (Dow 2007). As is the case with engagement, multiple theories and interpretations of immersion exist.\n\nImmersion has been described as characterised by a sense of ease and familiarity, a more passive experience than engagement—a comparatively conscious and effortful process (Douglas and Hargadon 2000). The same authors state that while flow hovers on a “continuum between immersion and engagement,” “immersion and engagement are neither mutually exclusive properties nor polar opposites.” The developers of a location-based mobile game also describe engagement as more active than immersion but ‘total immersion’ as an experience similar to flow (Carrigy et al. 2010).\n\nIn contrast, Swift et al. state that “a participant can be engaged in an activity without being immersed but cannot be immersed without being engaged” (Swift et al. 2010). This kind of hierarchical comparison features elsewhere, as in the statement that “it is not so much that involvement is necessary for learning, but that a certain amount of learning is required before being able to experience deeper levels of involvement” (Iacovides 2009).\n\nOne interpretation of immersion links the term to the “the sensation of being surrounded by a completely other reality … the experience of being transported to an elaborate simulated place” rather than to absorption in the present reality or task (see Murray as cited by Carrigy et al. (2010)). This distinction between immersion as “deep absorption” and “traversable space habitation” is respected by the Digital Game Experience Model (DGEM), which describes six frames, or modalities of meaning, that are gradually internalised by the player during the process of play (Calleja 2007).\n\nOther perspectives focus on immersion as a psychological state, including Witmer's view of immersion as “influenced by the immersive tendencies of the individual,” Salen and Zimmerman's description of engagement as a process of double consciousness, and Ermi and Mayra's sensory, challenge-based, and imaginative (SCI) immersion model (see Carrigy et al. (2010)). Another possible distinction is between immersion, characterised by “loss of self-awareness, loss of social awareness, and loss of game awareness,” and what is termed neo-immersion, involving “awareness of self, awareness of others, and awareness of the game” (Whitson et al. 2008).\n\nBrown and Cairns define three levels of immersion, denoted engagement, engrossment and total immersion, drawing on a grounded theory analysis of the interviews of seven gamers following time spent playing their favourite game (Brown and Cairns 2004). The authors describe the fleeting nature of total immersion as the distinguishing feature between it and the flow state. Brown and Cairn's conception of immersion is linked closely to the idea that controls should be as close to invisible as possible (Jacucci et al. 2010; Turner 2010).\n\nBrown and Cairn's model provides a strategy for user engagement by outlining the barriers between each ‘depth of interaction.’ Barriers of access (related to the game controls and feedback), time, effort (investment, expectation of rewards) and attention (a willingness to concentrate) pertain to the first state, game construction (visuals, interesting tasks, plot) to the second, and empathy and atmosphere (barriers to presence) to the third (Brown and Cairns 2004).\n\nPresence. Presence is closely linked to immersion and also to the hypothesis that greater invisibility of controls leads to increased immersion (Brown and Cairns 2004). This concept is often encountered in the context of augmented or virtual reality. Biocca's three forms of presence, physical, social, and self, suggest, however, that this term cannot be tied to a single conception (see Dow et al. (2007)). Presence has also been described as perceptual immersion but not psychological immersion (Seah and Cairns 2008).\n\nDow also views presence as ‘perceptual immersion’ distinct from engagement; “a user's involvement or interest in the content independent of the medium” (Dow 2007) and further states that while the aim of virtual and augmented reality systems is to make users feel “as if they are ‘there”’ or to “create the ‘illusion of nonmediation,”’ this can fail “to recognize the notion of actually engaging the user” (Dow 2007). This claim is supported by a study of three different implementations of an interactive drama using text-input, speech, and augmented reality (AR) (Dow et al. 2007). Only half of players (6 of 12) preferred the AR version of the system, citing a desire for more distance from the game to engage more comfortably with it. This suggests that “more ‘natural’ or ‘transparent’ interfaces, where the medium fades to the background, will not necessarily lead to a compelling game or entertainment experience” (Dow 2007).\n\nInvolvement. Involvement, a similar concept to immersion, has also been compared to engagement (Kappelman 1995). Contrasting the two terms, it has been claimed that engagement implies a degree of intrinsic interest, whereas involvement may occur even when the user experiences no enjoyment (Webster and Ahuja 2006).\n\n6.4 Engaging Users Emotionally\n\nAffective computing research has strong parallels to work on engagement, given the motivation to produce interactive systems with representations of fuzzy states (Beale and Creed 2009). However, engagement has itself also been described as an affective state or emotion. The measurement of engagement as an emotional response has been used to support the design of engaging experiences.\n\nDefining Affect. Affect is most commonly described as the the experience of emotion, composed of the dimensions of valence and arousal (D'Mello et al. 2010). The $9\\times 9$ affect and arousal grid, for example, has been directly applied to the measurement of engagement in the context of collaborative lecturing by human and computer tutors (D'Mello et al. 2010). However, affect has also been annotated as composed of three dimensions, valence, arousal, and power of control (Bianchi-Berthouze et al. 2007), defined as a combination of short-term emotion and longer-term mood (Hart et al. 2012) and examined using appraisal theory (Turner 2010). An alternative view positions engagement (as attention) as a moderator of affect, filtering information as it is perceived. One study, in the context of art viewing, found that “momentary engagement overrides the effect of mood on ambient/focal attention” (Biele et al. 2013).\n\nMeasuring Affect and Engagement. The measurement of affect and engagement share many of the same challenges and techniques. In the realm of affective cinema, for example, engagement has been assessed as ‘positive excitation’ using galvanic skin response, electroencephalogram, and automatic facial tracking measures (Abadi et al. 2013). Each modality was found to significantly encode viewer-engagement. GSR and EEG measures contributed comparably, and all three data sources combined resulted in the best performance.\n\nIn the context of two insightful studies of audience engagement, engagement was described as “related to attention and interest” but operationalised as valence and arousal (Latulipe et al. 2011). In the first study, three choreographers and four theatre directors were shown video of a performance (dance or theatre) alongside a timeline of previous viewers’ GSR (indicating arousal) (Latulipe et al. 2011). The software allowed users to vary the time period across which an average GSR response was calculated. This practice highlighted the need to differentiate between semantic-chunking and stimulus-response interpretations of data. The narrative structure of a live performance means that interpreting momentary data as though at “each second, audience members are responding to the thing they just saw happen in the previous second” is often erroneous, as stated expressly by participants.\n\nA second study examined audience reports of engagement. Nine participants watched a video of an 11-minute dance performance in an immersive environment while wearing a GSR sensor and manipulating a slider to indicate their level of engagement. Multiple ‘vocabularies of engagement’ were tested. With respect to a scale comprising ‘No Engagement to High Engagement,’ it was found that users “could not detach valence from the word, and tended to only rate themselves as being engaged when they liked what they saw. Others just didn't really seem to know what we meant by engagement, and still others didn't seem to know how engaged they were” (Latulipe et al. 2011). Other vocabularies included ‘Love it! to Hate it!’ and ‘No Emotional Reaction to Strong Emotional Reaction.’\n\nWhen later presented with a graph of their responses and asked to explain their ratings, those in the emotional reaction group did not provide as many details about the performance, and several reported difficulty using the scale. Those in the Love-Hate group could “lower their love-hate rating if something confused them” but “the mapping to the ER scale” was “less clear.” This was the only work within this corpus that examined users’ interpretation of engagement despite the potential significance of these differences, particularly in the case of self-report.\n\n6.5 Inspiring Fun\n\nEngagement has been conceived not only as utilitarian but also as driven by enjoyment, gamification, escapism, and fun; “the state of mind that we must attain in order to enjoy a representation of an action,” entailing “a kind of playfulness—that ability to fool around, to spin out ‘what if’ scenarios” (Laurel 1991; Webster and Ho 1997). Ludic engagement has been defined as “a precondition to play” (Brooks 2013). Enjoyment has been described as a component of engagement (Rozendaal et al. 2008) and characterised as composed of multiple constructs, including engagement, positive affect, and fulfilment (see Warner's model, as cited by Lin et al. (2012)).\n\nHumour. Humour has been shown to support engagement. The addition of a sidekick robot to a child–robot interaction increased the attention users paid to spoken dialogue (Vázquez et al. 2014). Twice as many participants laughed at least once. Analysis within the context of video games concluded that “humour itself stimulates engagement and provides a pleasurable experience” (Dormann et al. 2006).\n\nGamification. As an approach to designing enjoyable experiences, gamification is particularly popular. Primary categories of motivational incentives are social psychological, including social facilitation and loafing effects, and economic (Liu et al. 2011). Although economic motives may increase the quantity of “work” completed, they cannot be guaranteed to increase quality (Liu et al. 2011). The effects can be transitory, “participants can feel manipulated,” “little or no transfer can occur if behavior is only driven by rewards,” and “if the reward vanishes so does the behavior” (Domínguez et al. 2013). In one attempt to ‘gamify’ an e-learning experience, the authors’ use of competition as a motivator was not well received by all students, one participant stating that “it would be more interesting to improve the traditional version, instead of making competitions” (Domínguez et al. 2013).\n\nA study of children's engagement with LIEKSAMYST, a hypercontextualised game (HCG) in a museum environment revealed four motivational factors; curiosity, challenge, fantasy, and personal control (Islas Sedano et al. 2013). The authors stress the importance of user freedom and voluntary participation to engagement: “If a game has to be played as part of a prescribed school assignment, then the pupils (or players) do not access that game voluntarily. Instead the game is viewed as a task that the pupils have to complete within the school milieu.”\n\nUsers’ time spent playing games can also be strongly influenced by negative reasons for playing, however, suggesting that negative experiences can also act as catalysts for enjoyment and engagement (Boyle et al. 2012).\n\n6.6 Enabling Exploration\n\nThe use of a product entails more than accomplishing a single goal, extending to the engagement of additional senses, actions, and feelings (Chou and Conley 2011). Engaged reading, for example, has been described as “not a mere information-extracting process rather an experience encompassing a wider range of activities,” including “book selection, reading, imagination, learning, multisensory exploration, confrontation with the peers, etc” (Colombo and Landoni 2011). Tasks have been classified as experiential or goal-directed (Rozendaal et al. 2007, 2008) and ill or well defined (Brooks 2013; Goldberg et al. 2011). Experiential, or ill-defined tasks can result in richer experiences, allow exploration, and are more likely to prove engaging (Brooks 2013; Kucirkova et al. 2014).\n\nRichness. The richness of an interactive experience can be defined in terms of the diversity and evolution of its affordances and content and the control provided to the user. The RC&E framework models engagement according to the experience of richness and control. Within this framework, richness is defined as the “complexity of thoughts, actions and perceptions as evoked during the activity” and control as the “effort that is experienced in the selection and attainment of goals” (Rozendaal et al. 2008). Engagement is defined as the square root of the product of richness and control.\n\nIn a study of user engagement with a digital table-top game, richness was controlled by modifying the variety of ball and user behaviours, level of colour, detail, and asymmetry of the visual design, and control by manipulating the hand-eye coordination required and by the addition of redundant visual information (Rozendaal et al. 2007). It was found that richness commanded more of an impact on engagement during experiential tasks while control had a greater impact during goal-oriented tasks. When a user is presented with a well-defined task, the ease with which this can be accomplished is prioritised. A lack of richness can lead to boredom and a lack of control to anxiety (Rozendaal et al. 2009).\n\nThe study of narrative is related to the richness of experience. Spatial containment, causality, skill-based interaction, causality of dialogue, illusion of intelligence, and invisibility of the medium are considered to promote engagement in narrative multimedia (Mallon and Webb 2000). However, a potential conflict exists between the provision of control to the user and disruption to the narrative flow. Adams writes that although “interactivity and storytelling” are not necessarily mutually exclusive “the more you have of one, the less you're going to have of the other” (Adams 1999).\n\nNovelty. Exploration requires novelty. Flow theory views novelty not only as related to first use but as a characteristic of interaction which can be continually reproduced (Cowley et al. 2008). Engagement and novelty may together inform a user's decision to participate in an experience (Cowley et al. 2008). However, novelty has only rarely been examined with respect to engagement (Bianchi-Berthouze et al. 2007; O'Brien and Toms 2010b; Webster and Ho 1997).\n\n6.7 Supporting Social Connectedness\n\nSome of the strongest motivations to engage with technology are social in nature. Social engagement has been described as “the first stage of social intercourse” (Singletary and Starner 2001) and also as “not just about how a single interaction unfolds, but about how and why people develop a relationship with a platform or service and integrate it into their lives” (Jaimes et al. 2011a, 2011b). The link between social interaction and engagement has been studied within sociology (Goffman et al. 1978) but also with respect to technologies for gaming (Abreu et al. 2013; Lindley et al. 2008; Oksanen 2013; Rozendaal et al. 2009), learning (McClure 2013), social networks (Freyne et al. 2009; Kirman et al. 2010), and joint media engagement (Ballagas et al. 2013).\n\nSocial Strategies. It has been found that the strongest motivations for participation in social networks are associated with a sense of belonging and influence, specifically efficacy, anticipated reciprocity, and increased reputation and recognition online (Freyne et al. 2009). One study found that users of a social network who received people recommendations were more likely to return to the site. Those who received recommendations to active people were most likely to return (Freyne et al. 2009).\n\nMutual engagement has also been studied with respect to Daisyfield, a collaborative music making program that allows users to create music loops in a shared visual space (Bryan-Kinns 2013). Participants were most mutually engaged when granted either the provision of identity cues or indications of each other's focus but not both. The author suggests that “maybe there was an expectation that others would take more notice of their work when they could see each others’ loci of attention,” leading to “increased expectations on others—a form of social contract.”\n\nAnother study of collaborative music making identified three ‘qualitatively different engagement relationships’—individual, unilateral, and bilateral (Swift et al. 2010). Participants in this study commented that they viewed individual engagement as a potential barrier to group enjoyment. The use of network theory and real-time visualisation of these relationships was proposed as a means to support engagement.\n\nSocial Presence. The link between social presence and engagement has also been studied, including with respect to education (Wise et al. 2004) and human–robot interaction (Choi et al. 2014). Users have been said to feel socially present when “interdependent on other people inhabiting the same environment” or when they “intensely feel the engagement with the other agents” (Martino et al. 2009). Biocca et al. describe three dimensions of social presence: co-presence, psychological involvement, and behavioural engagement (see Martino et al. (2009)). Social presence emphasises the embodied nature of engagement.\n\n6.8 Enabling Optimal Experience\n\nEngagement has also been examined as a means of assessing progress towards a state of ‘optimal experience,’ a target for designers. The prominent adoption of flow theory often reflects this perspective (Cowley et al. 2008).\n\nThe Flow State. Flow and engagement states are often viewed as synonymous. Engagement has also been described as a subset of flow and a more passive state that is therefore more appropriate than flow when the user experiences less control (Webster and Ahuja 2006). It has also been proposed that games that do not set clear goals, as required for flow, can still be immersive and that negative and even frustrating experiences do not necessarily lead to decreased immersion (Seah and Cairns 2008).\n\nSystems that adapt to the user have been explored as a means of facilitating the flow state. This includes adaptive algorithms that determine when a player should be allowed to progress in a learning game (Lomas et al. 2012) and a model that adapts to the gameplayer, not by adapting the level of challenge but by changing the way the player perceives the results of his or her actions, with the aim of improving player confidence (Van Der Spek 2012).\n\nFlow theory is typically applied with respect to short timescales and has likely contributed to the prominence of situated experimentation within the engagement literature. However, it has also been suggested that flow theory could be applied to interaction “over a much longer time scale” (Seddon et al. 2008).\n\n6.9 Promoting Repeated Use\n\nUsers come to interact with products and services through a combination of personal volition and environmental factors. However, many technologies are designed to support active rather than passive users (Fischer and Benford 2009; Karavirta and Korhonen 2006; Webster and Ho 1997) and engagement “both in the moment and over time” (Lamberty 2004). For certain combinations of systems and users, long-term engagement can develop of its own accord, where the psychological needs of users are met, meaning and value are provided, and the burden on users is low. However, the less intrinsically engaging a technology proves, the more likely proactive strategies may be required to enable a habit of use. These strategies can include mobile phone notifications, email reminders, scheduled incentives, and reward tiers (Gençer et al. 2013).\n\nAddiction. While negative patterns of engagement can take many forms, it is game addiction that has received the most significant focus. Addiction and engagement have been described as “attitudes to the general experience of playing” and immersion as closer to “the actual experience of specific instances of play” (Seah and Cairns 2008). Several scales have been developed to assess addiction and its relationship to engagement, including Brown's Addiction Checklist, Charlton's Computer Apathy and Anxiety Scale (CAAS), Tellegen's Absorption Scale (Seah and Cairns 2008), and the Addiction-Engagement Questionnaire (Metcalf and Pammer 2011). An attentional bias for gaming-related words has also been identified among addicted online game players (Metcalf and Pammer 2011).\n\nOne study examined gaming addiction among 1,332 South Korean middle and high-school students using a custom 65-item questionnaire (Seok and DaCosta 2012). Between 1.7% and 25.5% of the sample group were classified as addicted depending on the criteria and cut-off threshold employed. However, the authors stress that further work is needed to reach a consensus on criteria for distinguishing between non-pathological and pathological gameplay if reliable prevalence rates are to be obtained.\n\nMany popular technologies are now designed to attract and maintain user engagement, including mobile games, social networks, and news applications. These systems provide content that is personally tailored, packaged into small chunks, updates frequently and unpredictably and whose delivery is activated at the press of a button. There are clear parallels between these strategies for engagement and those employed in the design of the slot machines of Las Vegas (Schüll 2012).\n\n7 DISCUSSION\n\nThe findings of this review support further reflection on the past, present, and future adoption of engagement.\n\n7.1 Domains of Knowledge\n\nInterpretations of engagement extend beyond what we might think of primarily as ‘user engagement.’ Returning to the issue of context-specific definitions raised in Section 3, considering different domains of knowledge can provide new insights.\n\nConversational Engagement. Forward-looking work on engagement is to be found in the study of human–computer conversation, including the development of robots and virtual agents (Baecker et al. 2006; Fagen and Kamin 2013; Oertel 2013; Oertel and Salvi 2013; Rich et al. 2010; Sidner and Dzikovska 2002; Sidner et al. 2004, 2005; Xu et al. 2013). In this domain, interaction is often interpreted though conversational analysis. This perspective features a useful distinction between backward and forward-looking forms of engagement, the first referring to grounding behaviours, “what is understood up to the present utterance,” and the latter to users’ need to “be connected and aware in the interaction” (Sidner et al. 2005).\n\nInformation Visualization Engagement. With respect to information visualisation, user engagement has been explored as a means of balancing the design goals of cognitive efficiency and learning, “a trade-off between efficiency and beneficial obstructions” that promote active processing (Hullman et al. 2011). The ITiCSE Engagement Taxonomy characterizes engagement as a ‘type’ or ‘depth’ of interaction, defining six forms; No Viewing, Viewing, Responding, Changing, Constructing, and Presenting (Naps et al. 2002). This taxonomy has been applied in a number of design scenarios (Karavirta and Korhonen 2006; Urquiza-Fuentes and Velázquez-Iturbide 2012) and attempts made to extend it (Myller et al. 2009).\n\nLearning Engagement. Definitions of learning engagement are often brief (Barkatsas et al. 2009; Blasco-Arcas et al. 2013; Cocea and Weibelzahl 2007; Grimes et al. 2005; Hu and Hui 2012; McCay-Peet et al. 2012). It has also been argued in this context that research often “essentializes engagement,” ignoring the effects of gender, socio-cultural, ethnic, and economic status (Zyngier 2007, 2008). School engagement has been described as malleable, responsive to contextual features, amenable to environmental change and as a ‘meta’ construct (Fredricks et al. 2004). Engagement has been construed by practising educators as a property of materials, as learner attentiveness, as interaction, and as increasingly legitimate participation within a community of practice (Notess 2008). With respect to this last conception, engagement is “the result of learning as much as the means of learning.”\n\nGamification is often employed as a strategy for student engagement. Although there have been attempts to guide designers (Schuurink et al. 2008), this approach has not always met with success. A systematic review of computer game and serious game use found no strong evidence to suggest that games lead to more effective learning (Connolly et al. 2012). A weakness of games designed for learning may be that they do not sufficiently inspire reflection. Avoiding “opportunities that users might take to reflect on their actions” has even been described as a trick used by designers to maintain player engagement (Whitson et al. 2008). It could be that slower forms of interaction are required to promote complex cognitive processes such as understanding (Kuznetsov et al. 2013).\n\nCivic Engagement. Civic engagement is a broad field of research, encompassing e-government, citizen sensing projects, gendered engagement in STEM subjects, community-based activism, and the generation of social capital (Kim and Kleinschmit 2012). Definitions of civic engagement have been proposed by a number of authors (Farnham et al. 2012; Nepal et al. 2012; Park 2006; Taylor et al. 2012). However, it is often in a transitory fashion that references to user engagement with technology are currently encountered within this domain.\n\nWellbeing Engagement. Engagement has also been studied with respect to wellbeing. This includes the design of an intervention to boost social engagement between residents of retirement homes (Linnemeier et al. 2012) and a serious game to tackle work-related stress while increasing work-related engagement (Wiezer et al. 2013). One interpretation of engagement in this context is “a kind of mindfulness requiring cognitive effort and deep processing of new information” (Xie et al. 2008). However, it has been suggested that although “characteristics such as feedback, control and interactivity may be associated with systems that are likely to promote engagement, they may not necessarily promote the mindful kind” (Pearce and Pardo 2008). Studying engagement can provide insight into the optimal role of technologies within our lives, possibly supporting a shift from “proactive computing to proactive people; where UbiComp technologies are designed not to do things for people but to engage them more actively in what they currently do” (Rogers 2006).\n\n7.2 What's Missing?\n\nA number of gaps exist within the engagement literature.\n\nEngagement in the Real World. Most studies of engagement take place in constrained laboratory environments, establishing internal validity but often neglecting ecological validity. We echo a call for research in real-world contexts; “open, relatively unconstrained environments, where multiple people with different needs, goals and long-term plans may enter, interact and leave the observable world” (Bohus and Horvitz 2009a, 2009b, 2009c).\n\nVoluntary Engagement.\n\nProviding participants with instructions, such as ‘Go interact with this system’, or ‘Go join the existing interaction’ can significantly prime and alter the engagement behaviors they would otherwise display. (Bohus and Horvitz 2009c)\n\nA significant gap in the literature concerns voluntary engagement. Supporting voluntary participation in user studies is challenging but an essential component of engagement research (Bohus and Horvitz 2009c; Islas Sedano et al. 2013). A focus on voluntary use is needed to shift design towards more ‘realistic’ forms of engagement, as expressed in the focused-casual continuum (Pohl and Murray-Smith 2013). Rather than focusing primarily on achieving high levels of engagement, design should support users’ choice of “the level of interaction depending on the situation, so that they can also choose to casually interact” (Pohl and Murray-Smith 2013). Novel methods of recruitment, such as Google Adwords (Colbert and Boodoo 2011), or mobile applications for public use (Killingsworth and Gilbert 2010) require further exploration. The study of engagement should allow for realistic means of engagement, yet this is rare.\n\nEngagement over Time. Longitudinal research is currently overshadowed by a multitude of brief and situated experiments. Definitions of long-term engagement include the “maintenance of user adherence to a desired interaction usage pattern” (Bickmore et al. 2009) and “the degree of voluntary use of a system along a wide period of time (i.e., weeks, months, or years), involving dozens, if not thousands, of interactions, each one spanning for significantly longer than few seconds or minutes” (Febretti and Garzotto 2009). Longitudinal engagement effectively has a vocabulary all of its own; patterns, trajectories, sporadic, immediate, periodic, shaped, sustainable. These terms are empowering in that they tie often verbose conceptions of engagement to a real-world context. Experience is cumulative (Carrigy et al. 2010) motivations for use evolve over time (Naps et al. 2002; Snow et al. 2013; van Vugt et al. 2006), and so engagement cannot be fully understood without longitudinal analysis (Chen et al. 2011).\n\nLong-term research has produced insightful results. A meta-study found that “students’ utilization patterns of visualizations had a much greater impact on their learning success—and therefore on the tool's educational effectiveness—than the quality of the visualizations” (Hundhausen et al. (2002) as cited by Isohanni and Knobelsdorf (2011)). Another study found that increased engagement with virtual agents designed to support behaviour change over time in fact led to decreased exercise behaviour (Bickmore et al. 2010).\n\nHowever, a call for increased analysis of longitudinal engagement does not imply that continuous or consistent engagement is always the appropriate design goal. Also lacking within the literature is discussion of the processes of disengagement, stepped models of engagement and non-use.\n\nEngagement with Design. Another gap within the literature is attention to the fit between engagement and the design process.\n\nThe design of engaging experiences rests on the assessment of user engagement. In Section 5 we described the variety of approaches to measurement. However, the integration of these methods within a process of design has received little attention. While several user engagement questionnaires have been rigorously developed, it is not clear how useful these measures have been to practising designers. Of particular interest would be an exploration of how the UES (O'Brien and Toms 2010b) might fit within an iterative design process, in comparison to the ESQ (Schoenau-Fog 2011) for example. Depth of analysis, efficiency of application and ease of interpretation are all desirable qualities for such measures. Would a One Minute Questionnaire (King and Robinson 2009) provide actionable insight for engagement? Is asking users ‘Was this an engaging experience? If not/so, why?’ as useful a means of assessment as validated questionnaires, interviews, behaviour logging or observation with respect to particular design goals? It is clear that there is room for further study of the value of different methods of evaluation.\n\nMany of the barriers to the adoption of engagement are familiar to designers, including the challenge of highlighting “relevant factors of engagement while still allowing designers to use their intuition and creativity” (Rozendaal et al. 2008) and the lack of optimal solutions to design decisions (Harteveld et al. 2011). The field of design thinking has long considered such challenges (Rittel and Webber 1973; Simon 1969) and additional consideration of this perspective, while beyond the scope of this article, may support design for engagement.\n\n7.3 Understanding Engagement\n\nUnderstanding engagement requires embracing a diverse methodological toolkit with an awareness of the contribution and limitations of each perspective. These challenges have been encountered elsewhere within HCI, with respect to user satisfaction (Lindgaard and Dudek 2003), usability (Hornbæk 2006), and emotion (Hudlicka 2008), for example. In this section of our discussion, we propose several means of negotiating the complexity of these concepts.\n\nStrive for Clarity of Expression. Engagement is a term we use to share meaning with respect to certain qualities of experience. However, language is flexible and interpretation reliant on cultural and professional bias. It is unhelpful to find ourselves caught up in questions such as whether the statement that “a student is engaged by a programming project, but is interested in computer science” (Hansen and Eddy 2007) is ‘true,’ whether a related concept such as ‘interest’ is a feature of engagement, an outcome, or a contributing factor, or between antonymic (engagement 1003 v. disengagement) and valenced (positive v. negative).\n\nClearly articulating what we mean by engagement requires us to consider the concept's theoretical foundations (Section 3), the ontological and epistemological framing of our interpretation within an HCI ecology (Section 4) and our motivations for the use of the concept (Section 5.3).\n\nLearn from Parallel Trends. There has been a call for a ‘turn to practice’ in the study of user experience, away from the dominant perspective of rationalism which can present “an obstacle to thinking about technology by reifying technological artefacts as objects of study apart from their making and use” (McCarthy and Wright 2004). The rationalist perspective is also prominent within affective computing, where researchers model emotions as discretised states, a “transformation from signal to symbol,” tackling emotion as a “problem of representation” that can be addressed by state-based models (Picard 2000). Similarly, there has been a call to look to the ‘social-interactionist’ alternative, acknowledging the social and cultural origins of emotion and its interpretation as experience, not just as an objective, measurable unit (Boehner et al. 2005).\n\nUser engagement research has also been predominately rationalist to date within Computer Science, as evidenced by both theory (see Table 2) and methodology (see Table 3). This is not necessarily an ‘unfavourable’ finding. However, we would echo, with respect to engagement, the call for “an appreciation not only of how emotion as a phenomenon is measured but also how measures make the phenomenon of emotion” (Boehner et al. 2005).\n\nEmbrace Methodological Diversity. Certain technologies realise a greater range of experience (emotional, cognitive, behavioural, and social) than others. Multiple approaches to assessment are often essential to understanding engagement in terms of such complex characteristics. The link among conceptions of engagement, experience, and their component parts can prove confusing given the breadth and diversity of the engagement literature. However, with clarity of expression, this need not be the case. We measure resting heart-rate as indicative of overall health without any confusion concerning its limitations. The implications of engagement as an indicator of user experience can be interpreted in similar terms.\n\nDon't Confuse Models with Reality. We must also take care when creating models of engagement to acknowledge their limitations. Many approaches we deem rational and objective rely on human judgement for establishing a ground truth, often through self-report or annotation. Even as humans we can only make inferences about another's state of engagement. It is important to avoid committing a ‘fallacy of reification,’ mistaking a model of engagement for ‘the concept itself.’ A map is not the territory it represents (Korzybski 1933). Recognising how our perspective on engagement fits within an HCI ecology can clarify our framing and draw attention to our assumptions (see Section 4).\n\nFocus on Fit for Purpose. Acknowledging the conceptual nature of engagement does not mean that invalid approaches to its assessment do not exist. The established metrics of validity, reliability, and generalisability maintain their relevance. It is also important to note that once a user becomes aware of the use of engagement as an outcome measure, it can cease to represent an accurate metric (Goodhart 1975).\n\nA focus on engagement can obscure design for other objectives. Certain definitions of engagement infer a direct link between conception and measurement. For example, it has been argued that “[i]f engagement to you is repeat visitors by visitors then call it Visit Frequency, don't call it engagement” (Kaushik 2007). More complex conceptions may require significant inference. However, any one interpretation of engagement is unlikely fit for all purposes and greater engagement does not always imply improved learning, wellbeing, or experience (Bickmore et al. 2010; Connolly et al. 2012).\n\nAcknowledge Complexity. Engagement is a ‘device’ we adopt to facilitate a particular perspective on interaction and experience. It does not exist predefined in nature, nor is there one universally ‘optimal’ approach to its understanding. The question we ask should not be ‘what is engagement?’ but ‘what interpretation of engagement is best suited to this context and purpose?’ while justifying this choice, as discussed in Section 3.1. We should move away from unhelpful and unfounded discussion of what engagement ‘is’ towards how engagement is ‘interpreted’ and ‘measured.’\n\n7.4 The Value of Engagement\n\nEngagement is a popular concept. However, there has been very little discussion of the value it provides. We explore the implicit value of the concept below, returning to the motivations listed in Section 5.3.\n\nValue to Research. Engagement is frequently adopted not just as an outcome in itself but as conducive to other aims. It is both an end and a means to an end. Engagement is popular in educational research, for example, due to the assumption that greater engagement with a system for e-learning is likely to support improved learning outcomes and, in wellbeing research, behavioural outcomes. Engagement is seen as contributing to a larger goal, such as wellbeing, happiness, learning, or task efficacy. This mediating relationship is one of the advantages of engagement over the concept of experience. It supports a reasoned connection to other valued concepts.\n\nEngagement is viewed as a flexible concept. This can contribute to ambiguity but makes engagement relevant to a variety of contexts and purposes. It also supports multiple levels of analysis. Engagement can be viewed as ephemeral and visceral in nature but can also be linked to, and have important consequences for, more abstract cognitive processes, including not just learning but reflection (Whitson et al. 2008), empathy (Hall et al. 2005), and understanding (Davies 2002). This means that engagement can provide insight into user experience at multiple depths, spanning the gap between theory and practice. This turns our attention to a spectrum of use, degrees of engagement and disengagement, as well as change over time.\n\nValue to Design and Development. One perspective on engagement might view it as the process by which we frame experience. This provides a grammar for discussing patterns of engagement and differences between users—a grammar that can help inform design.\n\nEvidence of voluntary engagement with a system indicates that the system is not just usable but useful. It provides value, in some form, to its user. User engagement can therefore be viewed as a measure of the ‘health’ of an iteractive system, of its value, as inferred by proxy of its measurable components, not blood pressure and heart-rate, but interaction and subjective experience. Engagement is seen to imbue many of the positive features of experience and as presenting easily measurable forms. However, there are limits to such analysis. Engagement is most insightful when use of a system is voluntary and takes place over time. It is not always positive in its outcomes, motivations, or design, as evidenced by technologically driven distraction, social withdrawal, and addiction.\n\nKnowledge of user engagement allows designers to grasp the value of their products to the user, and sufficient detail can provide actionable insights to support the iteration of design. Whether engagement, and of what kind, is the appropriate design goal is a determination that needs to be made. However, the concept offers a pathway for action, a target, in a way that the amorphous concept of experience may not.\n\nValue to the User. Engagement represents the focus of one's conscious experience. The redistribution of this capital is one of the key roles technology plays in our lives. Engagement can also be viewed as empowering, emphasising users’ autonomy and control. A subtle difference between ‘use’ and ‘engagement’ can be discerned. Engagement tends to emphasise a user's autonomy, needs, motivations, and the promise of a positive experience. Use can appear disembodied in comparison. A focus on engagement presents technology as ‘used’ by humans to varying degrees of intensity, pushing us to examine the role we want technologies to play in our lives.\n\n7.5 Recent Trends in the Engagement Literature\n\nTurning to the comparison corpus examined in 2018, authors continue to refer to the persistent challenge of understanding and measuring engagement (Arapakis et al. 2014; de Oliveira et al. 2016; Drutsa et al. 2015; Hamari et al. 2016). Ray et al. write that “[a]lthough researchers implicitly concur on the significance of engagement in the context of online communities, the notion of engagement itself remains relatively little understood in the information systems literature” (Ray et al. 2014).\n\nAs prior to 2014, the largest category of research pertains to online technologies (44.4%), although less now examines personal computers (16.7%). Much research in the 2018 sample concerns learning applications (22.2%), social media or online communities (16.7%), and health (11.1%). This most likely reflects increased use of wearable trackers, and a shift to online platforms, including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), enabled by HTML5. Reza Habibi et al. describe engagement as “the Holy Grail of social media” (Habibi et al. 2014), and the literature features increased reference to ‘community,’ ‘customer,’ and ‘brand’ engagement (de Oliveira et al. 2016; Habibi et al. 2014; Lim et al. 2015). In line with this trend, Preist et al., for example, propose ‘normification’ as an alternative to gamification, focusing on “ideas of collective engagement,” encouraging “normalising behaviour where community members aim to emulate others in the community and behave similarly to them” (Preist et al. 2014).\n\nOf those publications examined in the period 2014 to 2018, 61.2% provided no definition of engagement (compared to 65% prior to 2014), and 63.8% of papers also make no reference to theory. The most cited theory remained flow theory (13.8%) at a very similar rate to that prior to 2014 (14.2%). Behaviour logging (55.6%) overtook questionnaires (38.9%) as the most frequently employed measure of engagement. This trend likely coincides with the increase in online applications, facilitating access to users at a distance and at large scales. Interestingly, authors within this updated sample spoke more often of clusters of ‘user types’ (Eveleigh et al. 2014; Ferguson and Clow 2015), patterns of engagement over time (Coffrin et al. 2014; Drutsa et al. 2015; Epstein et al. 2016; Lim et al. 2015), and of multiple levels of engagement (Mark et al. 2014; McGill et al. 2015).\n\nThe literature in the period 2014 to 2018 demonstrates many of the same patterns as prior to 2014, with an apparent increase in the percentage of research concerning online applications, community engagement and clustering of users and patterns of engagement in particular (keeping in mind the smaller sample size of this latter sample). Increased adoption of behaviour logging metrics underlines the importance of achieving and maintaining a broader conceptual grasp on engagement. Engagement research continues apace."
