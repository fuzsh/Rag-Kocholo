Also, angry 9th grade Emily on the injustices of the foster care system.\n\nWhat do OF and MLMs have in common? More than you think! This time we get to read one of Sophie's papers, and learn all about the deep shit your mom's friend has found herself in.\n\nWhat is deal with maternity leave? Also, first episode with Sophie! Definitely way more fun than usual.\n\nEver wondered how our biggest enemy became an enemy? Listen to this ridiculously shortened story of how betrayal, lies, and unrequited love produced the rivalry of the century. I used a love of different sources but honestly just read Pomfret's \"The Beautiful Country and The Middle Kingdom,\" everyone else is just trying to imitate his genius on the topic."
