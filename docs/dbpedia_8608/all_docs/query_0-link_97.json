Since 2015, when Cosma co-opted Freiburg-based Romanian researcher Manuela Boatcă—then a Professor at Freie in Berlin—the conferences in Telciu have been amongst the highest-ranking events in the contemporary Romanian academic landscape, and an important center of the Eastern European decolonial studies, reuniting figures such as Madina Tlostanova, Julie Klingerm, Daniela Gabor, Don Kalb, Julia Roth, and Vintilă Mihăilescu. After 2017, when scholars such as Cornel Ban joined the organizing committee, the series of events gained momentum. The conference had already begun to earn notoriety, as Cornel Ban himself heard about it from an American scholar who was talking about this small Romanian village at a book launch in New York. In other words, things turned global. This was unexpected, if we consider the relatively small interest Romanian literary studies take nowadays in the rural itself, despite the major role it played in nineteenth and twentiethcentury literature and social praxis. Academics from prestigious universities in the United States, Europe, and all over the world were discussing decolonial theory, postcolonial frames of thought, and Marxist theory in a small Romanian village. The rural met contemporary theory, and theory now needs the rural more than ever, since postcolonial theory and decolonial theory felt obliged to include the rural as well in its sphere of interest.1 This is, in a way, the goal of the present volume: to propose a series of world liter­ ature and transnational frames for the debate of what seems to be the most autoch­ thonous topic, namely rural life and ruralism within a national literature. And there were quite a few obstacles we had to overcome. In the nineteenth century, the rural was a fundamental topic for Romanian literary critics and intellectual dis­ course in general. In 1868 Titu Maiorescu, the foremost Romanian literary critic of the nineteenth century, published one of the most influential manifestos in Roma­ nian culture, în contra direcţiei de azi în cultura română [Against the Contemporary Direction in Romanian Culture]. Through the theory of “forms without substance” (a top-bottom model of analyzing local cultural production and politics), he criti­ cized the predisposition of Romanian culture to imitate Western models without proper assimilation. To this imitation tendency, Maiorescu opposes an organicist evolutionary schema, built on the urgency with which ruling elites had to assist and guide the rural demographic majority to emancipation, which modernizing theories of his time completely overlooked. The same literary critic published, in 1882, the article “Literatura română şi străinătatea” [“Romanian Literature and\n\n14\n\nBaghiu and Pojoga\n\nthe Foreign Countries”], in which he argues that Romanian literature had sparked interest abroad through its “national originality” and by representing “the finest part of its ethnic nature.” He praises the prose of loan Slavici, Gane, and Negruzzi for how they portray “the typical figures of the people” and identifies their works as “peasant novels.” He justifies his enthusiasm by referring to similar works of George Sand, Flaubert, Turgenev, Bret-Harte, Charles Dickens, and Fritz Reuter. Inspired by the Aristotelian thought, Maiorescu then goes on to argue that the main difference between tragedy and the novel lies in the social origins of the main character, as the novel favors the representation of the lower classes, especially the peasants. He calls the main genre on the rise “romanul poporan” [the peoples’ novel] and analyzes the way in which the protagonist is passive, does not control the social environment, and is merely a victim of external decisions. Romanian literature, especially in its early days, is generally perceived to have a rural topography. Most of the major literary critics, including E. Lovinescu, G. Călinescu, and Nicolae Manolescu, believe, at least in a way, that the litera­ ture written in the Romanian cultural space is either rural or in obvious need of urbanization. One of the pillars of Romanian modernism, for instance, as defined by E. Lovinescu, is the general effort to urbanize literature, to generate a mutation in the manner in which Romanian writers see and use space in their works. There are at least two main causes for this perception—that we will later prove a mis­ conception: the general distribution of population in Romania, and the Romanian literary canon. Firstly, if we look in-depth at how population is distributed between rural and urban in Romania over the past century and a half, we see a complete disbalance until the 1970s and 1980s. In the almost a hundred years spanning the 1859 Union of Wallachia and Moldova and 1950, the percentage of urban population grew by a mere 10 %, reaching the 25 % threshold that year. Ever since, it has grown steadily, with the rural areas currently undergoing fundamental changes due to massive emigration and witnessing an all-time low share of the general population at about 46 %. However, these population shifts were slower than the European average, which amounted to 48 % urban and 52 % rural in 1950, that is almost half more people living in urban areas than in Romania (25 % urban and 75 % rural). There­ fore, Romania has constantly been one of the least urbanized countries in Europe, and the conclusion that this led to (in a rather superficial manner) was that litera­ ture must also be a faithful representation of the statistical reality.2 Secondly, the official Romanian high school literary canon—i.e., the list of authors included in the Baccalaureate syllabus—features 17 authors, whose works were published from mid-ninteenth-century to the 1980s. Of these, 7 wrote prose fiction (ranging from novels to short stories and folk tales), whose plot can be clearly located—as opposed to poetry where space does not play such an impor­ tant role, or criticism, where it does not play any role whatsoever: Ion Creangă, loan Slavici, Mihail Sadoveanu, Liviu Rebreanu, Camil Petrescu, G. Călinescu, Marin Preda. Only two of them (Petrescu and Călinescu) set their novels in an urban landscape, with a third of the novels studied in high school unfolding\n\nRuralism and Literature in Romania: An Introduction\n\n15\n\nin urban environments, and more than two thirds in rural settings. Therefore, the spatial focus of literature is, according to the canon, overwhelmingly rural. On the other hand, as a recent study on the nineteenth-century novel shows,3 the actual proportion between rural and urban (based on the analysis of a corpus of 157 novels published in Romania between 1844 and 1900) is considerably dif­ ferent, with less than 25 % of the corpus having events placed in rural areas. More­ over, Cosmin Borza’s analysis in this volume suggests an even bigger discrepancy between rural and the other spaces, with only around 7 % of the novels being rural according to his criteria. The chapters in the first section, “The Novel,” focus on the development of fic­ tion in relation to peasants and the rural world. As Cosmin Borza shows, there was substantial debate during the interwar period, which prominent Romanian literary critic Eugen Lovinescu heavily promoted, on “the urgency of fighting against the cultural ‘monopoly’ established by ‘peasant mysticism’.” Such a monopoly was, however, never real, Borza suggests based on quantitative data in his “How to Populate a Country. A Quantitative Analysis of the Rural Novel from Romania (1900-2000).” The rural is more of an exception, Borza claims, while providing the reader with an insightful perspective on Maria Sass’s subsequent inquiry into Liviu Rebreanu and Paul Schuster’s rural writings. Moreover, as Daiana Gârdan shows in her chapter on “interstitial spatiality,” the interwar period witnessed some sort of a “muted rurality and subverted urbanity,” while a more important place of the plot may actually be the space between the rural and the urban. In respect to commu­ nist and post-communist Romanian fiction, the chapters signed by Anca-Simina Martin, Ştefan Baghiu, and Alex Goldiş portray the difficult task of translating rural fiction into English, the strange case of “muffled brutality” in the socialist realist rural novel, and the ideological criteria that the novelists had to conquer in order to integrate in the grand socialist narrative, while avoiding to compromise on their writing. As Alex Goldiş shows in the chapter titled “The Ideology of Ruralism in the Thaw Prose: The Case of Marin Preda’s Moromeţii,” although “Moromeţii does not conform to socialist realist rules of composition, (...) the novel was not met by Stalinist critics with hesitation or objections.” Furthermore, Ramona Hărşan and Snejana Ung’s chapters discuss the late communist postmodern experience of the rural and the post-communist understanding of border villages as paths to trans­ nationalism in post-2000 fiction. Two other articles offer an unusual perspective of rural literature: Andrei Terian’s \"Liviu Rebreanu: Zoopoetics in a Rural Environ­ ment,” in which the author analyzes “the representation of animals” in one of the best-known rural novels in Romanian literature, and Mihai Iovănel’s “Peasants and Intelligent Machines,” in which the author stresses the connection between “robots and the rural world” in twentieth-century literature. Over the past centuries, the rural has taken centre stage in social theories as well. Some articles in the present volume emphasize cultural constructs, putting forward imagined communities of the rural in Romanian literary criticism and culture. In his article, “Inventing the Romanian Peasant in Transylvania during the Nineteenth Century,” Vaier Simion Cosma points out that peasants themselves\n\n16\n\nBaghiu andPojoga\n\nwere subjected to different portrayals at the dawn of the nation-states, and that “the images of the Romanian peasant are constructed and conveyed by the intel­ lectual, administrative and political elite,” in a veritable quest toward “conquering the peasantness.” In her article on Romanian literary critic and culture theorist Eugen Lovinescu, entitled “Social Class Difference and the Evolution of Roma­ nizai Literature from Lovinescu’s Perspective (1924-1929),” Teodora Dumitru shows, in the same manner, that the main theories of modernism in interwar Ro­ mania were actually classist theories, discriminating against the peasants in order to achieve the much longed-for modernization. But not all articles ground their understanding on such phenomena, on condescending elites ‘inventing1 peasantry or classist theories claiming a ‘modernizing’ agenda. As Dragoş Sdrobiş argues in his chapter “From Science to Action. Professionalizing Social Work in Greater Ro­ mania,” although the rural space was an undesirable place for lawyers or physicians to work in during the interwar period, for sociologists such as Dimitrie Gusti, it was a shared space for research and theory, to study the balance between demog­ raphy, means of production and capital. Sdrobiş uses examples from China and Russia to show some international connections between approaches to the rural space in social action. Similarly, Cosmin Koszor Codrea writes about the efforts of Romanian anarchists in teaching Darwinism to the peasants in order to counteract the influence of the Church in the region. What Ovio Olaru shows in “Diasporic Nationalism. German Regional Literature from Romania” is the way in which the rural becomes a very important element in defining interactions between different populations in the mutual space. The three chapters dedicated to Romanian poetry and the rural stress out— we believe—three key elements in describing rural poetry’s relation to a transna­ tional context. First, the historical Avant-garde. Nothing is more urban than the Avant-garde, one might assume. Yet, as Emanuel Modoc shows in “Negotiating the Rural and the Rustic in the Romanian Avant-Garde,” poets of Romanian origins and Romanian poets of the radical modernist trends had always integrated the rural in their literary consciousness, which points to the existence of a rural setting in this eccentric literature. Secondly, a profile of the “national” rural poet George Coşbuc. Although Andrei Terian has shown that there could be nothing more remote from world literature than “national poets,”4 a profile of the “the poet of the peasantry” felt important in balancing canonical figures of prose writing through an analysis of his work by Radu Drăgulescu, since the poet was connected to the most impor­ tant populist movements of the early twentieth century.5 The last article in this col­ lection, Mihnea Bâlici’s “New Ruralism. From Village to Globe,” brings attention to the latest poetry trends in Romania. Curiously, although part of a very globalized and urbanized medium, Romanian poets of the last decade have been attracted to the rural setting and the discrepancies between the civilized urban and the belated rural, sometimes just to work on “depicting a current social crisis, which is more acutely felt in the rural world.” What starts as a “periphery complex” in recent poetry ends as a way “to adopt a critical position towards an economically unequal and hypercapitalist Romanian society.”\n\nRuralism and Literature in Romania: An Introduction\n\n17\n\nNotes 1.

A Quantitative Analysis of the Rural Novel from Romania (1900-2000) Abstract: This study, developing a quantitative analysis of the Romania rural novels of the twentieth century, tries to dismantle two enduring cliches about this type of lit­ erature: a. its excessive impact on the configuration of the Romanian cultural identity, generating extremely pervasive inferiority complexes, respectively b. its reactionary, inherently anti-modernist and conceptually unsophisticated character. By comparing the number of rural novels against the backdrop of the total novelistic production, and also by examining the yearly, decennial, and periodical distribution of this subgenre, the chapter focuses on the various literary strategies, formulas, scenarios, etc. Romanian writers used to imagine in order to mirror both the diversity of the peasant typologies, and the challenges/inequalities inherent to modernization that peasantry often disclose. Keywords: rural novel, quantitative analysis, the peasant revolt, modernization, arche­ typical village, rural mysticism, rusticity, de-ruralization. Closely bound to the fact that, during their entire history, the historical Romanian provinces, united since 1918 under the name of Romania, have been predominately rural, the national cultural discourse repeatedly took up the idea that rurality con­ stituted the most prominent component or even feature of national literary pro­ duction. On the one hand, this supposition is evidently connoted positively and enjoys numerous idealizing and mythicizing variations. From the most prestigious nineteenth-century Romanian critic, Titu Maiorescu, and the most renowned Romanian literary historian of all time, George Călinescu, through the ample populist, nationalist, conservative, and traditionalist trends emerging in the early twentieth century (‘sămănătorism’, eponymous with the Semănătorul [The Sower] magazine, ‘poporanism’—originating from ‘popor,’ i.e., ‘the people’—and ‘gândirism’—derived from the name of Gândirea [The Thought] review), and the extremely influential ‘protochronism,’which culminated during the nationalist phase of the communist regime, imposed by Nicolae Ceauşescu and unfolding during the 1970s and 1980s, to the post-1989 stances in favor of rurality, regarded as a victim of the totalitarian regime, rural literature was instrumented as artistic backdrop for the discovery, the expression, and the conservation of presumably authentic national identity. On the other hand, the ‘excessively’ rural character of Romanian literature has brought a series of equally consistent allegations to the forefront, expressed by\n\n22\n\nCosmin Borza\n\nvarious agents of socio-cultural modernization who, in the post-illuminist cultural disparity between the East and the West and between the Western and the Ori­ ental World, respectively, transform “le paysan du Danube from the original ‘noble savage’ of La Fontaine’s fable into the untrustworthy primitive of the European East.”1 During the entire twentieth century, nearly every intellectual group in the Romanian cultural sphere that came to regard itself as an agent of ‘modernization’ (be they proponents of the prewar Symbolist movement, interwar Modernists, representatives of socialist realism from the first two postwar decades or the Postmodernists of the 1980s and 1990s) found legitimacy either through an attack on the ‘abusive’ rurality of national literature (on the grounds that it contributed to the country’s backwardness) or by regarding literary works on the peasant class as being artistically obsolete, aesthetically minor, anti-intellectualist, and permeated by idealizing sentimentalism or descriptions of sterile picturesque life. The main yardstick for this very lengthy polemical debate is undoubtedly Eugen Lovinescu, the so-called ideological mind behind Romanian modernism, who, all throughout the six volumes of his Istoria literaturii române contemporane [History of Contem­ porary Romanian Literature, (1926-1929)], builds his argument by emphasizing the urgency of fighting against the cultural “monopoly” established by “peasant mysticism,” which would presumably help spread a “primitive” and “rudimentary” literature, blocking, in turn, Romania’s path toward modernity: “While our society has developed in the sense of differentiation and, thus, of evo­ lution, through the creation of an urban stratum and of a national bourgeoisie with traits of ethnical homogeneity, our ideology and, implicitly, literature itself took the reverse approach by negating the obvious, hence the peasant mysticism of all the cultural movements of the last half century: the peasant has been seen as the only economic, social reality of the Romanian people.”2 Lauded unanimously or, conversely, largely condemned, the rurality of Romanian literature becomes an apparently uncontested reality. Romanian literature seems entirely populated by rural characters, places, themes, and artistic formulae. This belief is also invoked in respect to contemporary times, when attempting to explain the poor reception of Romanian literature on the international book market or the dim interest shown by the newer generation of readers toward local literature. Peripheric nation, excessively rural literature, i.e., marginal status, backwardness, illusions of local exceptionality—these are the converging factors that confirm the extremely pervasive inferiority complex of Romanian culture. A persistent counterbalance to the aforementioned interpretative pattern is put together by Dicţionarul cronologic al romanului românesc (Chronological Dictio­ nary of the Romanian Novel, published in two volumes, with the first indexing the feuilletons and all the successive editions of Romanian novels published “from its origins until 1989” and the second accounting for the first post-communist decade, 1990-2000).3 Apart from offering a realistic insight into the real statistical distribu­ tion of the rural novel in regard to the total Romanian novelistic production, these\n\nHow to Populate a Country\n\n23\n\ntwo large-scale editorial projects also give way to an analytical scrutiny of the con­ cept of ‘rural novel’ itself; even more so, of its historical evolution.\n\nDetermining the Corpus Therefore, before attempting to demonstrate how a quantitative analysis founded on the Chronological Dictionary of the Romanian Novel can lead to a refutal of prejudices related to Romanian literature’s rurality, several observations are due in regard to the surveyed corpus. First of a11, though it ignited consistent and often heated debates, rural literature (and, implicitly, the rural novel) did not enjoy proper conceptualizations in Romania.4 Moreover, even the international theoret­ ical discussions of the topic are poorly represented. For example, in his Working the Garden. American Writers and the Industrialization ofAgriculture, William Conlogue lamented that “few scholars have bothered to define the farm novel,”5 which is explainable not only through the fact that major literary critics and historians have systematically minimized this type of literature,6 but also because major studies on the subject matter label the (sub)genre according to whichever cultural context it happens to emerge: Te roman rustique,” “roman de la terroir,” “roman de la terre,” or “roman champetre” in Francophone cultures, “Bauernroman” in Germanophile countries, “rural novel,” and “regional novel” in the British or Anglophone cultures, “farm novel” in North America, etc.7 Thus, it was necessary to bring together several theoretical concepts in order to offer a most functional definition of the Romanian rural novel: sufficiently well delimited from other subgenres, but also sufficiently inclusive as to account for the variety of local formulae. I have adhered to the prevailing theory according to which the rural novel is a subgenre of social realism, first and foremost a product of literary modernity and having emerged as a backlash to the bourgeois novel of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (the novel, par excellence, of massive urbanization and industrialization). On the one hand, this classification mainly corresponds to narratives where the archetypical, archaic/mythical connotation of the village is substituted by the social; there, the economic and political contexts become crucial existential factors and the peasant protagonists are freed from both traditional psychological and behavioral idiosyncrasies as well as from urban cliches. This is precisely the realist formula put forward by Michael H. Parkinson and endorsed by William Conlogue in their attempt of separating the “farm novel” from the myths the North American urban intelligentsia construed on their basis: “Nostalgia and pastoral assumptions find less room in writers’ depictions of farm real­ ities than they do in critics’ comments about those depictions. Because the dominant urban society tends to view rural areas as pastoral retreats or as country backwaters, literary scholars assume that writers explore fanning by imagining or reworking the agrarian myth.\"8 Conlogue deconstructs this cliche of the American pastoral, yet he does so not by rejecting it, but by demonstrating that the pastoral model is not to be found\n\n24\n\nCosmin Borza\n\nin Virgil’s Bucolics, but in his Georgies, i.e., not in the idyllic projection of Edenic, isolated, both atemporal and asocial existence unfolding in deep harmony with nature, but in the portrayal of hard, physical work, against the complexity and tensions of finding one’s place in the community, the unpredictable confrontation with nature, and the refusal of nostalgia. On the other hand, I have also taken into consideration the inclusive approaches formulated by Florian Freitag and Glen Cavallero, who have argued for the legit­ imacy of a broader variety of rural representations, from the \"idealizing” and “romanticized” to the “naturalist” or in their words, “from pastoral, fulfilling and idealistic to dreary, disenchanting, and iconoclastic.”9 Consequently, the multi­ faceted rural novel finds representations in the works of writers as diverse as Honore de Balzac, the author of the famous novelistic cycle unfolding between 1830 and 1840, Scenes from Country Life, Emile Zola, with The Earth (1887), or John Steinbeck, with The Grapes of Wrath (1939) as well as the highly prolific promoters of rustic-idealizing portrayals such as George Sand and C. F. Ramuz. The only prerequisites the genre has to fulfil—there is a broad consensus on this matter, shared by all the aforementioned critics—can be summarized in the following manner: a. the protagonists belong to the peasant social class; b. the narrative’s setting is the rural space; c. the literary conflict/themes are tightly bound to or typical of rural existence. Surely, each of these features require further clarifications, on which I will elab­ orate in what follows, while also mentioning several categories in and from which I have chosen to include or exclude some novels. For example, in regard to the first condition, the one defining the narratives’ protagonists, I have chosen to include the novels that—alongside the peasants per se (serfs, collectivist peasants, farmers, etc.)—feature other types of rural “dwellers,” who are equally representative of peasant life: village teachers and priests, country doctors, fishermen, and shepherds. This explains why the list expands to include novels such as Mihail Sadoveanu’s Baltagul [The Hatchet] or Vladimir Colin’s Soarele răsare în Deltă [The Sun Rises over the Delta]. Conversely, I have ultimately excluded several works whose title would have otherwise led one to believe he/ she is dealing with perfect examples of “rural novels”: Alecu Cantacuzino’s Serile de toamnă la ţară [Autumn Evenings in the Countryside] (1855), G. Beronzi’s Muncitorii satului [Village Workers] (1880), Nicolae D. Xenopol’s Brazi şi putregai [Fir Trees and Decay] (1881) and Duiliu Zamfirescu’s Viaţa la ţară [Life in the Countryside] (1898). All of these novels and a few more revolve around small landowners, civil servants, politicians, and exponents of the bourgeoisie, for whom the rural life is strictly limited to what Raymond Williams refers to as “landscape,” “place for a walk,” or “weather.”10 The conflicts in which they engage hover over the “waste land” of the village, taking place in country estates or public institutions, as if the surrounding landscape featured agricultural land, orchards, forests, but no peasants, let alone a peasant community. It is because of this that said type of novel failed to fulfill the second criterion as well—the plot’s setting is rural only superficially, in fact, when the action is\n\nHow to Populate a Country\n\n25\n\nnot altogether displaced and set in urban environments or provincial fairs, the narratives in question are placed in spatial enclaves that cease to touch on the rural in any way. Dwelling on this second criterion, it is noteworthy that it also demands the exclusion of novels whose protagonists are, indeed, of rural origins, but whose activities take place in an urban setting. One of the most prominent examples in this respect is Marin Preda’s Marele Singuratic [The Great Loner], a novel whose opening line has meanwhile become notorious: “A peasant coming to Bucharest will still seek the kinship of other peasants.”11 As for the third criterion—the one regarding the thematic link to rural exis­ tence—the most common theme, also noted by the majority of critics and theoreticians discussing the rural novel, is that of the ruminating battle of man against nature, environment, and society at large: against this understanding of the novelistic subject’s position, humanity is regarded rather as community, as gener­ ality instead of individuality. Departures from this type of climaxes are significant in the greater scheme of the Romanian rural novel and, as shown further on, can help chart its historical evolution. In addition to the three aforementioned criteria, I would also like to make two observations with respect to the surveyed corpus. First of all, an account of the temporal reference points: 1896 and 2000. The first year was selected on histor­ ical and literary ground, as 1896 may be considered the year when the first two Romanian rural novels were published, Foamete [Famine] and Fuga [The Escape], both authored by N. Rădulescu-Niger. The second chronological yardstick, how­ ever, was singled out based on the fact that the Chronological Dictionary of the Romanian Novel indexed all the novels published until the year 2000. Further­ more, while compiling the corpus, I took into consideration exclusively what is widely regarded as ‘finished novels’, regardless of whether they were published as instalments—this is the case of the first two novels from the Dictionary’s index, The Famine and The Escape (1896)—or as novels—from 1900, the year in which the same minor novelist, N. Rădulescu Niger, published Strein în ţeara lui... [Foreigner in One’s Own Country...] onwards. I have thus not included fragments or ‘unfinished novels’ such as that authored by one T.N., Moravuri şi năravuri [Mores and Vices] (1884) or by George Stama, Mărunţelu [The Little Man] (1894), otherwise the only prose works of considerable length published before 1896.\n\nThe Distribution of the Rural Novel Compared to the Total Romanian Novel By comparing the number of rural novels against the backdrop of the total Roma­ nian novelistic production publishing over the aforementioned timespan, whose aim has been that of expanding rather than of reducing the size of the corpus, the following graph was obtained (Fig. 1): A statistical interpretation of the metadata employed in obtaining the graph points to the following distribution:\n\nCosmin Borza\n\n26\n\n250 200\n\n100\n\n« OMN moo - ■ NO\n\nr-s LO\n\n(N\n\nLI\n\n18961910\n\n00\n\n1 19111920\n\n1\n\n19211930\n\n19311940\n\n19411950\n\n19511960\n\n19611970\n\n19711980\n\n19811990\n\n19912000\n\nFig. 4: Rural Novels—Decades\n\nby William Faulkner, whose reverberations were felt not only in regard to style, but also with respect to mentality; he “helped a primitive and rural world that until then had seemed to demand a codified and descriptive realism to achieve novelistic modernity: in his hands, a violent, tribal civilization, impressed with the mark of biblical mythologies, opposed in every respect to urban modernity [...] became the privileged object of one of the most daring exercises in style of the century,”19 and (2). the fascination exerted by South American magical realism and especially by Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s Macondo. An entire series of imitators of Faulkner and Marquez rehabilitate and fictionally re-populate the presumably traditional village, constructing authentic epics that depict ordinary village life or propose ample narratives with the help of local or regional rural mythologies. The period’s 169 novels demonstrate the genre’s massive diversification and formal, thematical, and perspectival enrichment by their quantity alone: D. R. Popescu—through the F. series (started in 1969), alongside other, lesser known novelists such as Ştefan Pârvu, Pan Solcan, Ion Butnaru, and Ion Anghel Mănăstire, cultivated the style of magical realism, Augustin Buzura and Dinu Săraru are representatives par excellence of the political novel of the so-called “obsessive decade” (literature dealing particularly with the Stalinist abuses of the 1950s), reassessing the trauma of collectivization (Feţele tăcerii [The Faces of Silence] and Nişte ţărani [Some Peasants], published in 1974); “classical” socialist realism returns full force (in 1975 Liviu Bratoloveanu’s Pelagră [Pellagra], Rodica Braga’s 1985 Singurătatea pământului [The Earth’s Loneliness]), while sensation­ alist intrigues are revigorated (Tudor Ştefănescu’s 1975 Oameni care ucideau vise (People Who Killed Dreams] and Eugen Mihăescu’s 1985 Ţăranii de platină [The\n\n34\n\nCosmin Borza\n\nPlatinum Peasants]) alongside the humoristic-ethnographical novel (Păcală şi Tăndală [Păcală and Tândală]—1973). The long-forgotten idyllical, ‘sămănătorist’ perspective is also rehabilitated (in Ion Brad’s 1975 Ultimul drum [Last Road], and Petre Anghel’s 1976 Fratele nostru Emanuel [Our Brother Emanuel], for example), mostly against the backdrop of Nicolae Ceauşescu’s aggressive nation­ alism (Petre Anghel’s 1982 întoarcerea fiilor risipitori [The Return of the Prodigal Sons], Vasile Băran’s 1982 Cavalerii de pe coastă [The Knights from the Coast], Ştefan Pârvu’s 1985 Casa dintre spini [The House Between the Thorns]). It is also during the 1980s that the emergence of novels addressing contemporary issues within rural life, the so-called novel of actuality is also witnessed. Such prose texts attempt to ostentatiously show the positive aspects of the village’s modernization—industrialization, systematization, mechanization, urbanization and so on: Oana Cătina’s 1984 O mână de cireşe [A Handful of Cherries], Ion Florian Anduru’s 1988 Sub merii sălbatici [Under the Wild Apple Trees], Ştefan Dorgoşan’s 1989 Ascensiunea [The Ascent], etc. Even more diverse is the first post-communist decade. The 66 novels of the period can be grouped into four major categories, but also in other minor classes. The most prominent of the categories is the anti-communist rural novel, which features 21 titles whose styles go from traditional realist formulae to parabolic, Aesopical, and absurdly Kafkian narratives. The post-apocalyptic historical per­ spective becomes an underlying trope of these texts, who thus falls victim to new ideological manipulations of the rural imaginary, this time in accordance to the post-communist political environment: as the degradation of the rural commu­ nities is regarded as tantamount to the abuses of the collectivization, the pre­ communist village becomes—despite the wealth of historical, economic and social evidence—a projection of the best of the possible rural worlds, in the words of Candide. Also worthy of note is the presence of the model of the “obsessive decade,” through novels written before 1989, that were censored or unpublished because of the political context: Ion Lăncrănjan’s 1991 Cum mor ţăranii [How Peasants Die], from 1991, Paul Miclău’s 1994 Dislocaţii [The Displaced], and Cornel Brahaş’ 1994 Mocăneştii, oamenii dracului [The Mocans, Devil’s People]. There is even a novel treating the rural post-communist transition—Dinu Săraru’s 1994 Crimă pentru pământ [Murder for Land]. Fourteen of the period’s novels employ the classical realism made famous by Liviu Rebreanu (this time, however, with more numerous introspective episodes), with 13 of them reviving the ‘sămănătorist,’ patriarchal, idyllic and idealized village. The series of novels prolonging the Romanian tradition of magical realism, which had had a fruitful career until the end of the 1960s, is also significant; this decade also witnessed the emergence of erotic and detective fiction as well as his­ toriographical metafictions that address the transformation of the rural world into a cultural myth. As an anticipation of further research into this topic, the avail­ able data I have gathered thus far supports the opinion that the anti-communist narratives and the historiographical metafiction represent the major tendencies of the rural novel after 2000.\n\nHow to Populate a Country\n\n35\n\nConclusions Summarizing, the quantitative analysis of the Romanian rural novel is useful inas­ much as it deconstructs two very pervasive cultural myths, namely: a. That of Romanian literature’s rurality—since the rural setting is employed in a mere 7 % of the most social realist literary genre, I dare say that the contrary rather holds true: during its history, Romanian literature has discriminated against its most numerous social class. In paraphrasing the present chapter’s title, I could justly say that the Romanian novel “de-populates” the country, preferring to portray, time and time again, all sorts of other realities (not only once in the Bovaric spirit); b. That the rural is fully equivalent to the picturesque, with the rustic and with the traditionalist ‘sămănătorist’ tendencies—as I have demonstrated, with the exception of the first two decades of communism (when it falls victim to cen­ sorship), ‘Sămănătorism’ is highly influential and constitutes a creative model valid during all the periods, but whose action never claims monopoly over the worldview presented in the novels. In numerical majority only up until the First World War (in a technical “majority,” since there barely 20 rural novels had by then been published), in minority even during the interwar period, the archaic and idealized village remains barely one of the possible facets of the rural imag­ ination, but not the main one. Moreover, the quantitative analysis also bears a clarifying and constructive role, not only the de-mythologizing function. It accounts for the very definition of “pop­ ulating” a country, which implies not only the quantity (the number of published novels), but also the quality of the novelistic output (in terms of “diversity”). Despite the fact that the most prominent and critically acknowledged authors addressing the rural setting are active during the interwar period and during socialist realism (the genre’s “classics” as Liviu Rebreanu, Ion Agârbiceanu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu), it is during the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s that the rural genre is truly revived as a result of the renewal of novelistic typologies. The archaic nature of rurality betrays not only ossified, museal preconceptions, but rather a mythology centered around the peasantry’s vital energy; the peasants cease to passively embody populist ideological positions, but become political actors themselves, the village stops being portrayed either as an ideal or as a dystopic setting, but starts being nuanced in its description (as only the city once was). Characters taken out of ballads, out of Balzac and out of Zola, end up fraternizing with Kafkian, Faulk­ nerian, Marquezian, or metafictional companions. Sometimes, the peasants taken on the role of detectives, generate ample erotic scenarios, or construct identitarian, explicitly psychologizing sagas. It is precisely as it undergoes a steep decline (during the 1980s and 1990s, Ro­ mania becomes, during the first time in its history, preponderantly urban in its demographical distribution) and as its fictionalization is thoroughly compromised in the eyes of literary criticism (as no writer with peasant sympathies is validated\n\n36\n\nCosmin Borza\n\nby literary criticism during this time), the rural setting is more alive and prolific as never in the Romanian novel. Propagandistically “overpopulated” forcefully by various cultural and political orientations, but in fact totally de-populated by Romanian novelists during several literary periods, life in the literary coun­ tryside livens up only when ideologues and writers seem least interested in its evolution.\n\nNotes 1.

The starting point of my approach is that Rebreanu’s fiction signals a deci­ sive departure from the traditional anthropomorphic representation of animals and, although it does not identify animals as an instance of radical alterity, it succeeds in instrumentalizing this category in an original manner. Specifically, in Rebreanu’s first novel, the writer puts forward a genuine tropological network (metaphors, similes, epithets, etc.), which, in turn, translate into a biopolitical vision wherein the animal element not only illuminates, but also gives structure to the human. Far from quali­ fying as a mere bestiary, the novel features numerous analogies between humans and animals, which provide the former with ontological depth and a clearer position within the social scale. Keywords: zoopoetics, interwar Romanian novel, tropology, scales, bestiary. The present article represents a case study of zoopoetics applied to one of the most renowned novels in Romanian literature, Ion, published by Liviu Rebreanu (1885-1944) in 1920.' Since the name of this new discipline might be misleading, I start by formulating several methodological remarks. ‘Zoopoetics’ was coined by Jacques Derrida in a conference held in 1997 at Cerisy-la-Salle while referring to “Kafka’s vast zoopoetics, something that nevertheless merits concern and attention here, endlessly and from a novel perspective.”2 The first attempt at theoretically enclosing this new field belongs to Aaron M. Moe, who defined it as “the process of discovering innovative breakthroughs in form through attentiveness to another species’ bodily poiesisP The definition itself features both a breakthrough and con­ siderable limitation. The breakthrough element consists of the fact that, as Moe emphasizes, the subjects of the “innovative breakthrough” deliberately remain undefined, as, in the author’s opinion, “animals are makers.”4 As for the definition’s limitation, it is a direct consequence of the embodiment thesis, which makes the resulting interpretation fairly opaque to other forms of expression, including those generated by the environment as third interacting agent or the prejudices, superstitions, and anthropomorphic analogies that people have projected upon the animal world throughout centuries of coexistence. In this article, I deploy ‘zoopoetics’ in the sense contrived by Kâri Driscoll and Eva Hoffmann. The two researchers suggest three possible revisions to Moe’s def­ inition. Firstly, they raise awareness of the fact that in “literary animal studies,”\n\n42\n\nAndrei Terian\n\ndespite their inherent focus, “there are, strictly speaking, no ‘actual’ animals in literary texts that ‘we’ allow to ‘be themselves’: there are only words, or rather, [using a Derridean term] animots,”s In general, we must not forget that a literary work is ultimately a type of discourse, and that the issue of human-animal interac­ tion found in certain verbal artefacts had been a question of representation before it became a question of biopolitics. Secondly, even if zoopoetics regards literary works as a “multispecies event,» « we must also keep in mind that the agency of nonhumans in these processes has been and continues to be quite limited.”6 More accurately, despite its noblest intentions, it seems hard to believe that zoopoetics could refrain from anthropomorphizing its subjects, since regardless of the new “codes” or “poetics” it could potentially discover in literary texts, these would have to be “translated” or recoded back to human language. This is why it seems more plausible to argue that, instead of proclaiming the discovery of altogether “new” or “different” approaches, zoopoetics explores a “certain affinity between ‘poetic thinking’ and ‘animal thinking’,”7 which “is a characteristic not merely of poetry, but also of a certain mode of reading and criticism.”8 Ultimately, when correlated with the observation that in literary texts “animals function both as a symbolic and as a material resource,”9 the affinity mentioned above shows that, far from being separated by a rigid frontier, humans and (other) animals share a certain “fluidity” that can contribute to a better understanding of each other’s roles within the plan­ etary ecosystem.\n\nThe Road and the Dogs The main road from Cârlibaba winds along by the Someş river as far as the city of Cluj, then branches off just above Armadia; there a narrower white road crosses the river by an old wooden bridge under a worn single roof; it cuts through Jidoviţa village and runs down towards the Bistriţa river where it joins the main road that descends from Bucovina through the Bârgău Pass.10 Liviu Rebreanu’s 1920 novel Ion, one of the most preeminent novels of Romanian literature, begins with this image of the road. The book pursues the destiny of a poor, but hardworking peasant, who initially follows the “voice of the earth” in seducing the daughter of a wealthy neighbor to get his hands on her dowry, but then succumbs to “the voice of love” and eventually dies at the hands of his lover’s husband. For the reader to arrive at this conclusion, he must first be initiated into the narrative world that is opened up by the aforementioned road and to which Romanian criticism has designated successive literary functions: “accessway” to the novel, juxtaposing “two similar and neighbouring, yet different and irrevo­ cably separated worlds,” “the novel’s first” and, by the same token, its “last pro­ tagonist,” “a border, a frame and a constituent of the imaginary”—and last, but not least: “a metaphor symbolizing the entire novelistic genre.” Moreover, according to the same literary critic (Nicolae Manolescu), the road demonstrates that “the novel delivers an upturned model of the world”: “instead of objects and beings\n\nLiviu Rebreanu: Zoopoetics in a Rural Environment\n\n43\n\nsimply suffused with existence, we encounter characters and actions suffused with meaning; they are not distinct individualities, but general types; before embodying their particular existences, they embody generic meanings.”11 What is to be found beyond the road? The Village, of course, which—as the narrator informs with dry frankness—seems “dead.”12 This is evidently a metaphor, and a cunning one for that matter. Not only because, as is evident from the fol­ lowing paragraphs, the village dwellers are fully alive and succumb to their natural instincts either in the village tavern or by the hora round dance, but also because the village is also fully animated in all other respects. We should not be distracted by the heat or by the silence dominating the dwelling, as there are still many things taking place. A “milk-white cat” prudently attempts to cross the road, but then, having seen the teacher’s dog, “hesitates for a moment, then slips through the hedge into an orchard”13; “hens wallow in the hot sand, under the alert eye of a little cock with a red-blood crest”H; “a shaggy-sheep dog,” that \"lollops aimlessly up the road,” growls at “a dirty little mongrel, carrying his tail high.”15 Therefore, it cannot be said that the village lies dormant even in the absence of people. What is the purpose of mentioning ail these creatures? And furthermore: what do they signify? For Manolescu, absolutely nothing except the “model” he invokes when discussing the road: “All this is to be found there since forever.”16 They— both the objects and the animals—are assimilated to an “inventory” of elements, together with the old lady sitting on the porch “as motionless as if she were carved in wood.”17 This should not come as a surprise (surprising is only that Manolescu contradicts himself from one page to the next): in a rural novel, the presence of animals such as poultry, dogs, and cats is perfectly understandable. Equally under­ standable is that they appear to signify nothing, serving as mere decorum only. Is this also the case in Rebreanu’s novel? Before we answer this question, a particularity of the novel’s representation of animals that seems to substantiate Manolescu’s claim has to be more minutely discussed: not only are the animals not anthropomorphized here, but they are not even individualized through the use of names. We can support this claim by going through successive representations of “man’s best friend” in Romanian rural prose. In loan Slavici’s (1848-1925) novellas, for example, dogs are near-human beings, so much so that one of his works is eponymous with the dog therein featured (Scormon, 1875). The dog subsequently makes it possible for the main protagonists’ romantic relationship to come to fruition and ultimately ends up watching over their newborn child. In Moara cu noroc [The Mill of Luck and Plenty, 1881], the tavernkeeper Ghiţă spends more time with his newly acquired dogs than with his wife Ana, who is of the impres­ sion that “since he’d had the dogs he cared less for his wife and children.”18 Their old hound Cula, thanks to its gentle nature, is ridden like a pony by their child. Even the intimidating brigand Lică confesses a mystical respect toward dogs, as he says: “dogs have their own way of barking at people and you’ve got to understand their tongue if they are to be of any use; for, when they should actually spring at a fellow’s throat, they’ll hardly bark, but yap once or twice.”19 He involuntarily utters the truth, because the dogs themselves are the ones “betraying” Ghiţă, failing\n\n44\n\nAndrei Terian\n\nto stop the tragedy at its outset. In Marin Preda’s (1922-1980) novel Moromeţii [The Morometes, 1955], the anthropomorphizing tendency has nearly vanished— though not entirely: when Hie Moromete is sought after by the gendarmes, “the dogs barked, not as they would have done at a bear, but in a peculiar way, meant for human beings: gendarmes”20—but the dog’s nature is maintained: Duţulache is depicted as an ever-present ninth member of the Moromete family. The dog is nearly deprived of his symbolic significance—once again, not entirely: when Ilie’s acacia comes tumbling down, announcing the symbolic downfall of the head of the family, “the valleys astir, and the dogs all around started to bark like mad”21—but even in this context, it manages to fulfil a clearly defined narrative function, acting as a reactant for the interhuman relationships unfolding within its proximity. Duţulache illustrates not only the presumed “stupidity” of Catrina (the tensions building up between Ilie and his wife, to be specific), but also Moromete’s inner conflicts. And it seems that Duţulache is not the only one to act this way, since “I shall set the dogs on you” is a usual utterance in the Romanian village situated in the Wallachian Plain, casually expressing a form of (un)sociability, the same expression used by Tudor Bălosu to threaten Ion Birică, by Tita to threaten Guica, and by Bălosu again to threaten Birică and Polina.\n\nThe Chain of Evolution Nothing like this occurs in Rebreanu’s Ion: not only are none of the dogs anthro­ pomorphized, they are not even called by their proper names. This does not signal that the novel lacks a canine presence.22 Quite the contrary, the novel features the word “dog” and neighboring words from its semantic field no less than 50 times: “the schoolteacher’s dog,”23 “a shaggy sheep-dog,”24 “a dirty little mongrel,”25 “dogs... their muzzles on the ground, their tails in the air” (lingering behind “tired peasants”26), “two sheep-dogs—as strong and big as two calves”27 (in the yard of Maxim Oprea’s widow), “two hounds . . . their ears hanging limply”28 (accompa­ nying a group of hunters), “the dog across the road,”29 and so on. There are few novels in Romanian literature where one can encounter such a diversity of canine representations. However, the narrator never particularizes the dogs by employing their proper names, not even the teacher’s dog, which is mentioned a number of five times at five different points in the novel. The narrator invokes it by employing the affected phrase “the household dog (câinele casei)”30; Titu Herdelea refers to him in an internal monologue as “our dog”31; it is only Laura that mentions his real name, Hector, as she leaves the village and the parental home (in an unsubtle manner, which the novelist uses to ridicule the mannerisms to which the Herdelea family is prone). It is as if the narrator deliberately avoids granting the dogs too much agency or distinctiveness. And it is not only the narrator who does so: the novel’s characters themselves seldom interact with the animals, although the novel takes place in a rural setting. The animals are not reduced to mere instances of decorum: they continue to bark, to whimper, to croak, and so on. In a word, they do what they\n\nLiviu Rebreanu: Zoopoetics in a Rural Environment\n\n45\n\nnormally do, but are simultaneously undisturbed by human presence, and their interactions as impersonal as possible. As an example, during the tragic night of Ion’s murder, George and Florica “suddenly heard the gate creak very faintly, then, light and cautious footsteps moved up to the house. Then the dog across the road gave two short barks again [the author uses here ‘again’ because the first bark was given earlier, when George returned home unexpectedly—my emphasis].”32 Why was it the dog only “across the road”? What was the “household dog” doing? Was it sleeping soundly? Or was it accustomed to Ion’s previous visits? Rebreanu, typ­ ically showing great attention to detail, does not disclose this information. But ultimately, it is not even of such great importance, since George had heard the stranger’s steps before the dog barked at him. As previously mentioned, the dog is his neighbors’; we know nothing about the newlyweds’ dog. It is in no way a “traitor” dog such as Ghiţă’s dogs from Moara cu noroc nor is it a watchful pro­ tector like Duţulache. Even in this instance, Rebreanu takes all the precautions in his power to prevent the dog from acquiring a specific narrative or symbolic function. Why this precaution? My answer is fairly simple: in the symbolic unfolding of Rebreanu’s novel, a dog (or any other animal, for that matter) cannot become an explanandum, as it already represents an explanans. Let us return to the description of the seemingly “dead” village from the opening chapter, whereby every species— and every representative of every species—occupies its corresponding place: the rooster dominates over the hens, the cat is scared of the dog, the hound growls at the pup. Only a few pages later, the collective round dance depicts a similar scene, unfolding this time in the human world: there, we witness similarly violent acts rooted in hierarchical power struggles and the oppression of weak by the strong, both within the same species and by human characters. In a Darwinian fashion, Rebreanu’s human fauna is composed of distinct (and fairly rigid) species. Above everyone else sit the city-dwelling gentry folk (domnii), such as doctors: they do not appear in villages, except in extreme cases such as death or birth. They form an authentic breed of supra-men living in a mysterious transcen­ dent world, whose echoes village dwellers can only faintly perceive. The contact with a gentleman {domn)—with, say, a doctor—is a cherished encounter, the recol­ lection of which has to reach as many fellow villagers as possible. George does not hold back from boasting about such an encounter, during the same dance scene, in front of Briceag, to whom he attempted to teach “a new song he had heard the fiddlers playing in Bistriţa, one gay evening with Doctor Filipoiu, at the grand beerhouse in Armadia.”33 And since Armadia is not even a city, the doctors from Armadia are themselves as insignificant as their place of origins. More fascinating is Belciug’s story of “how the great doctors in the Cluj Hospital had cut out one of his kidneys.”34 “Great” doctors—i.e., authentic “gentlemen”—are found only in the cities. As for the rural intelligentsia (comprised of the priest and the teacher’s family—the superior men, so to speak), it is made up of “young ladies” such as Laura and the now obsolete “younkers,” denominating young gentlemen such as Titu, and only by chance some others, a touch older than them. They are not younger ladies\n\n46\n\nAndrei Terian\n\nand gentlemen, but smaller, less significant ones, in short, the village 'gentry'— yet the entire village addresses the priest and teacher with “sir,” with the narrator him­ self perpetuating this illusion. Notwithstanding these appearances, a huge distance separates the “gentlemen” from the “younkers”—or, in any case, a distance quan­ tifiable only in terms of the difference between doctors and priests, excellently explained by Laura Herdelea: “The girl had often said to herself, privately, that between a doctor and a priest there was a difference as great as between heaven and earth, the doctor being heaven, and the priest the earth.”35 Equally signifi­ cant is the difference between the “younkers,” the village gentry, and the peasants representing the third human species, the ordinary men—the most numerically substantial and the most complex, of course (at least in Ion). The fourth human cat­ egory comprises, following Rebreanu’s understanding of the rural environment, the inferior men—either the “kikes” or the “gypsies,” such as Avrum and Belciug, or the physically deformed, like Savista, regardless whether they are occasionally wealthier than the peasants. According to the rural worldview, they will never succeed in transcending their condition, just as a species cannot turn itself into another. Also, it is technically possible, yet highly unlikely, that members of one category can migrate toward the next; this is how Maria Herdelea, “the daughter of a peasant from Monor” who “had always worn only town clothes,” eventually “married a schoolteacher”; however, such transgressions paradoxically do nothing but confirm the rigid nature of the species, as Ms. Herdelea “regarded herself as superior to the common people and harboured a disdainful compassion for every­ thing that was rustic.”36 This very “disdainful compassion” is inherited by her off­ spring, since both Laura and Titu outragedly refuse the peasants’ invitations to join the dance. Finally, a fifth category—vague and ambiguous—takes shape in the form of infra-men: a category situated in the vicinity of and sometimes over­ lapping animality. By this, we reference not the village brutes, but the peasants who are so extremely poor that their existence is rendered unnecessary for the preservation of village life. Essentially, parasites compared to domestic animals, such as Alexandru Glanetaşu, who witnesses the discussions taking place around the dance “close by, like a dog at a kitchen’s door.”37 Their social condition must not be confused with that of the Roma or the Jews, since, notwithstanding their ethnic background, the village could never function without its tavernkeepers and fiddlers, in much the same way it could not without teachers and priests. However, the village could easily dispose of paupers the likes of Alexandru Glanetaşu. This is why the “infra-humanity” is more similar to “supra-humanity” than to “inferior humanity”: both categories are outside the village, albeit for different reasons—the first category consisting of city dwellers, whereas the second, despite living in the village, do not belong to it.\n\nRebreanu’s Bestiary Therefore, Rebreanu’s novel proposes a genuine “chain of evolution,” wherein the species not only occupy well-defined positions, but also form a hierarchy whose\n\nLiviu Rebreanu: Zoopoetics in a Rural Environment\n\n47\n\nself-preservation instincts prompt them to aggressively sanction all those posing a threat. It is perhaps redundant to invoke Ion in order to back up this claim, since, during the same hora scene, both George Bulbuc and Vasile Baciu, two of the village’s wealthiest peasants, despite their haughty composure, are put back in their proper place by the village’s true aristocracy. And this happens because the animal kingdom doubles as and simultaneously explains the biological functioning of the human race, both through analogy (in the sense that human power hierar­ chies mirror existing in the animal world) and through contiguity (in the sense that humans from the lowest possible social strata start to resemble animals). In Ion, animals are simultaneously a reflection and a catalyst for humans’ most basic compulsions: they reflect human behaviors, while revealing instincts they attempt to conceal. Let us ponder on these two processes: analogy and contiguity. Comparing Glanetaşu with a dog would prove insufficient in illustrating similarity between the two species. But this comparison is not singular. A more careful reading of the novel reveals a genuine bestiary taking shape between its covers: George Bulbuc, for example, represents the Bull. As he makes his first appearance in the novel, the narrator presents him in the following terms: “He was rather hefty and broad-shouldered as a bull; with a lumbering gait and bent knees.”38 His subse­ quent invocations do not refute this resemblance. Quite the contrary, as he and Ion brawl in the tavern during the same chapter, “George snorted like a bull and caught at the collar-band of Ion’s shirt, pulling and twisting it till Ion’s veins swelled and his face grew redder and redder.”39 How about Ion? Well, here things start to become interesting. The novel’s first scene describes Glanetaşu’s house as follows: “His door is locked and bolted; the thatched roof looks like a dragon’s head, the recently white-washed walls can only just be seen through the chinks in the fence.”90 Undoubtedly, the household “dragon” is not the gentle “dog” Alexandru, but rather the young and vigorous Ion, as the tavern brawl wholly confirms. When Titu insidiously turns Ion against George, Ion blurts out: “ T won’t let him get away with it. I’ll break his skull first, even though I may have to spend ten years of my life in jail,’ growled Ion breathing heavily [, like a dragon/aprins ca un balaur], his fists clenched and his whole body shaking with fury.”91 Here, two alpha males—the Bull and the Dragon—dispute their territory in front of the tavern: it is not hard to predict the winner, at least not for now. Yet the situation becomes progressively more complicated. Ion’s totemic animal was evidently not chosen arbitrarily: the dragon is renowned not only for its unrivalled strength, but also because it is an imaginary animal—one that does not feature anywhere in the chain of evolution. It will never find its place among “crows” (Briceag), “dogs” (Glanetaşu), “pigs” (Belciug), or “bulls” (George), because it occupies no such posi­ tion whatsoever: for Ion, the dragon does not solely represent his counterpart in the animal kingdom; it is rather a corrosive force pushing him to contest the status he had originally been designated in the community’s social hierarchy (the status of—as is shown later in the novel—“dog”), and which is therefore consuming him from within. This is why, for Ion to be reintegrated into the “natural” order of\n\n48\n\nAndrei Teri an\n\nthe village, the dragon must not be “fastened” to a place (since there is no place that could accept him), but defeated, eliminated. This is what seems to happen when Ion falls to his knees and ecstatically kisses the earth, having apparently triumphed over his fate: “He felt in him the pride and might of the giant in fairy­ tales, who after a grim, deadly battle has slain a host offearful dragons!’*2 This is unfortunately an illusion, as the dragon was merely briefly benumbed and in no way “defeated.” On the contrary, the consequences of this apparent triumph only fuel his frustration of having lost Florica, voiced full force in one of the novel’s key scenes, when Ana threatens her husband with suicide. Ion’s reply basically seals her fate: “ ‘All right, go and kill yourself; maybe that way I’ll manage to get rid of you!’ he growled indifferently, blowing white jets of steam [, like a furious dragon/ca un balaur întărâtat]!’** Rebreanu’s method is not unfamiliar. It evokes the literary technique of the bestiary, widely used in Antiquity. In Romanian literature, this method is most commonly associated with Dimitrie Cantemir’s (1673-1723) prominent Istoria ieroglifică [The Hieroglyphic History, 1705], which substituted the names of real people with their animal counterparts.'14 Rebreanu’s use of this technique is far from basic, as the correlations he presents do not take an allegorical form, but are construed as comparisons. In this sense, Ion sits more closely to Mihail Sadoveanu’s 1933 Creanga de aur [The Golden Bough], wherein the women com­ pare Kesarion Breb’s composure with the “haughtiness ... of a light-coloured Lybian lion,”45 the servant Constantin “recalled a sheep dog”46 and the min­ ister Stavrikie wears “the imprint of the fox”47; likewise, the empress Irina is evocative of “a fattened, well-kept she-wolf,”48 Platon the bishop has “a long nose like an ibis from the Nile marshes,”49 and so on. However, a crucial dif­ ference sets the two novels apart: if Sadoveanu’s use of animal tokens is rem­ iniscent of allegories deeply rooted in medieval tradition,50 Rebreanu’s cannot be reduced to simple allegory. For example, the two aforementioned analogies (with the bull and the dragon), albeit attributable to George and Ion, are not exclusively reserved for them. On the contrary, both are indicative of Vasile Baciu’s impulsiveness, as he simply cannot accept Ion’s relationship with his daughter Ana: “Baciu stared at her for an instant, his eyes bulging, and then like a bull before a red flag, he flung himself upon her and silenced her with a shower of blows.”51 We catch a glimpse of his temperament even before this notorious scene: “[i]t was then that he would writhe in his bed, snort like a dragon, curse between his teeth, ready to catch Ana by the throat and squeeze out a denial from her lips.”52 This exception, however, does not imply that the associations discussed hitherto are purely arbitrary, but that they are not presented as alle­ gorical tokens, but rather as symbolic affinities, thus emphasizing the author’s subtleness. Anybody can symbolically embody a bull or a dragon or possess a “bull’s temper” or a “dragon’s temper”: these two do not represent the particular natures of George and Ion. No less true is that the “bull’s temper” is predomi­ nantly used to describe George, whereas the “dragon’s temper” is mainly used in regard to Ion.\n\nLiviu Rebreanu: Zoopoetics in a Rural Environment\n\n49\n\nAn Imperfect mise en abyme Let us now proceed to the next mechanism we have signaled in relation to Rebreanu’s bestiary: the “explanation” occasioned by contiguity. Here, the number of relevant examples is vaster, but I will focus on a single animal: the dog. In Ions narrative universe, the dog represents a negative yardstick for humanity as well as a measure by which human inferiority can be assessed. Rebreanu offers numerous examples, but I will focus on two (a third will be Ion himself). The first case is that of Belciug, the priest, as the teacher’s family perceives him. In this particular situ­ ation, his scolding of Ion during a sermon is only the catalyst of a conflict that had long been building between the two families. The first one to react is Zaharia, the head of the Herdelea family: “Call that a priest? ... He’s a swine, not a priest! And a dirty swine [in original: porc de câine = a doggish swine] at that!”53 (It is note­ worthy that, in the last expression, the dog and not the swine is the one amplifying the priest’s physical foulness and, implicitly, his moral degradation.) And, since the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, Titu, his son, compares the poor priest not only with a dog, but also with the devil himself: “there’s no sourer-tempered man under the sun that Belciug! He has a cruel heart [in original: a dog’s soul/heart = câinos la suflet] and is as crafty as the devil.”54 Similarly, Maria Herdelea’s womanly instincts come to life as she voices her opinion about Belciug: “When I get that feeling about somebody, you may be certain he’s a real brute! [in original: he has a dog’s soul = suflet de câine]”55 However, following this reply, the relationship between the two families becomes more amicable and the defamation attempts decrease (“We Romanians must stick together and love each other”56), as every such instance of name-calling is acted out by the other characters, a process the narrator pas­ sively witnesses without intervening. This is, however, not the case with Ana, whose moral depravity is laconically noted by the narrative voice, signaling its irreversibility. First, her father’s fury robs her of any remaining humanity: “The girl sank down in front of the fireplace, crouching like a guilty dog, her eyes to the ground, expecting him to kill her.”57 This is followed by her banishment from the parental home: “Her mind was a blank, drained of all thoughts like a dry sponge. There was neither hope, nor hopelessness in her. Her footsteps carried her along, like a dog who had been driven away from the doorstep. She hurried in fear of the old man’s weird looks in which she seemed to see her own death flicker.”58 As she sets foot into her new home, the Glanetaşu house­ hold, she is first insulted by Zenobia and despite Ion’s false attempt at defending her in front of his mother, the threshold to the animal state is irrevocably crossed. “Ana turned her gaze upon her husband with the tender devotion of a scolded dog and, conscious of having been unfair toward him, tears welled her eyes; she had suspected him to be carrying on with Florica, while he was so kind and loved her so dearly that he even quarrelled with his own mother for her sake.”59 Ion’s undying passion for Florica nonetheless hurries her demise: “Ana was as humble and meek as a dog. She dared not say a word before the old man, but only at times her eyes, sunk deep in their sockets and constantly red with tears, would be raised to her father\n\n50\n\nAndrei Terian\n\nbeseechingly. The days seemed endless as she waited for the man for whom she still longed, all the more deeply as she had suffered so bitterly for his sake.”60 Under these circumstances, the teacher’s outraged question for the people blankly staring at Avrum, who hanged himself (‘“Why hasn’t anyone cut the rope? He’s not a dog, what the devil!’ shouted Herdelea, white-faced as he forced his way through the crowd.”61), expresses a cynical turn of events, as Ana would share his fate, choosing to end her life in the same way. As a matter of fact, crediting the novel’s symbolic logic, Ana was already a dog, and had become one long before her death. We are slowly approaching the novel’s most interesting case: Ion. Interesting not only because he is the novel’s main hero, but also because, in the canine anal­ ogies that define his character and evolution, we encounter not only the aforemen­ tioned converging views (that of the other characters and of the narrator), but also a third, which we do not find elsewhere: that of the hero himself. Before we go any further in elaborating on them, let us return to the crucial scene of the hora, whereby Alexandru Glanetaşu waits around “like a dog at a kitchen door”62 More­ over, his infamous laziness—as we shall discover further on—indicated that his closest link to humanity is his wife Zenobia: “The dogs would have simply eaten him up if it hadn’t been for her.”63 What does this have to do with Ion, one might ask? The son is not the father. While it is true that heredity is a powerful factor in nat­ ural selection, its laws do not seem to apply here: Ion is stubbornly hardworking, “the handsomest girl in Pripas”64 likes him and he himself is “the brightest of all the young men in Pripas”65 and could easily beat all his fellow villagers to a pulp. Within the biological hierarchy of the village, Ion occupies a privileged position. What seems to be the problem, then? Precisely this is the problem, the codified representation of human relationships through an animalistic taxonomy in the chapter’s opening scene represents a mise en abyme—yet an imperfect one because, while natural selection is based purely on the biological factor, social selection is not exclusively confined to it. The bio­ logical factor evidently plays its part, and the best proof is the sexual selection (Ion and Florica). However, the economic factor plays a crucial role in the human universe, allowing for the intergenerational transmission not only of genes, but also of wealth—or its lack thereof. Because of this, despite his qualities, Ion is (or is about to become) a “dog,” a transformation that triggers his inner conflict and the novel’s entire movement: essentially, the Dragon awakens in Ion in order for him to avoid becoming a Dog. For how does one “become” a dog? Within the social sphere, that happens in the absence of a fundamental function that would make him indis­ pensable for the workings of the rural world—or at least the lack of wealth that could warrant his integration. The judge would have undoubtedly employed a dif­ ferent tone of voice if Ion had had a higher social status or at least some land, but the violence of his utterance confirms Ion’s deepest, darkest fears: “[s]o, you are the terror of the village, you wretched dog\\ . . . All right. We’ll teach you, we’ll cure you of your madness, you can be quite sure! . . . You’ll come and stay two nights in jail, to cool your temper, take away your taste for fighting! You villain, you good-for-nothing!”66 If that had been the case, Vasile Baciu would not have\n\nLiviu Rebreanu: Zoopoetics in a Rural Environment\n\n51\n\npondered: “[i]t might be safer after all, he thought, to let the cur take half the plots and the old cottage, and have one worry less.5’67 All of this is known—or at least deduced—from as early as the novel’s opening scene. More interesting is the reason why Ion does not succeed in overcoming his status as “dog,” since, despite what others are telling him, the hero has the strong impression of having the upper hand after seducing Ana. This is something he tells her himself, as he sends her back to her father: “[t]here, Ana! Just tell him that! I have nothing to settle with you, but with him we can talk things over and come to some arrangement, I should think, as between decent people . . . How can we come to any settlement without bargaining? Who has ever seen a contract without a price? We can’t be treated like dogs, indeed we can’t. Just tell Bade Vasile what I said, so that he knows .. .’,68 Nonetheless, the novel’s ending marks the acknowl­ edgment of this tragic fact: Some time after he woke up from a heavy sleep. He had no idea how long he had been unconscious, or what had actually happened. Only when he heard his own groans did he remember... He was drenched to the skin. He felt las if he was lying in a pool of dirty water. ‘It may be my blood!’ he reflected. He wanted to stretch out his hand to feel around, but he was unable to move his right arm. He could hardly open his weary eyes. A thin drizzling rain was falling ... The drops that fell upon his cheeks pricked his burning flesh. The air around was grey, the break of dawn seemed to be near, but the sky was smothered with the clouds and the rain sifted its cold, slimy, fine-grained drops. Excruciating pain surged from all over his body, seething in his whirling brain. Even his groan pierced his chest with daggers. He could only think of the filthy pool in which he was wallowing; it sickened him. He had to get out of all costs. ‘I'm dying like a dog!’ he thought, his mind feverish with despair.69 “I’m dying like a dog!” and not “I’m a dog, because I’m dying!”—these are the pro­ phetic last words of the hero and the ones consecrating his failure. It is not death that brings failure, but failure that leads Ion toward his death. What kind of a failure are we referring to? As previously stated, social selection does not imply biological selection only, but also economic selection. Put differently: social selection is based on the repression of the biological factor by the economic (and perhaps also the moral) factor. This is precisely the principle that governs village life in Pripas and the prerequisite Ion so stubbornly refuses to comply with. On the contrary, all his efforts go toward the attempt of employing his biological upper hand in overcoming his economic (and implicitly social) limitations. He seduces Ana in order to gain land (and his peers’ esteem) and seems to have succeeded for a while. Except that, in Ion’s existential plain, a fatal error resides (fatal, i.e., both inevitable and lethal): the biology card can only be played once. Upon acquiring land, Ion is deprived of Florica. As he attempts to regain her, he is deprived of his social status as well. It is because of this that “the filthy pool in which he was wallowing. . . sickened him”: only in this “filthy pool” does Ion truly become like his father Alexandru, deprived both of the object of his biological desires and of his newly acquired social status. Only dogs end up dying in pools, forgotten by their fellow men.\n\n52\n\nAndrei Terian\n\nThis is why Ion ultimately fails, at least from his own point of view; because, according to the narrator’s perspective, his failure took place notably earlier. For instance, when Ion decided not to save Ana’s honor by asking her hand in marriage, “Laura several times attempted to explain to Ion that his behaviour was unworthy of him, but Ion, who seemed to have gone right out of his mind, would say no word in reply and merely grin like a rabid dog”70 Similarly, when Ion asks u i Belciug for counsel, and the priest asks him how he is doing, he replies: not too good, Father’, answered Ion, attempting to smile but only managing to bare his yellow teeth like a helpless dog snarling”71 It is only at this point that the pur­ pose of Rebreanu’s zoopoetics is revealed: for the novel’s narrator, the protagonist acquired dog-like features much earlier, as he lost his moral compass. But which compass? Ion never had such a thing: for him, seduction and the acquirement of land was never a question of “if,” but of “how.” Conversely, the narrator makes use of these analogies to insert his own moralizing views into the novel: indeed, better disguised than the ones shared by Rebreanu’s literary predecessors, but still far from the unprejudiced stances attributed to him by almost all of his commenters.\n\nConclusions Three more relevant conclusions can be drawn from the present analysis. First of all, it is not difficult to note that animals—animalistic comparisons and analogies, more exactly—are used with the purpose of nuancing some of the moral features of several key characters in Rebreanu’s novel. As shown throughout the study, these comparisons and analogies are not exclusively used as indices, as the author avoids the trap of regressing to the allegorical stereotypes of medieval poetics. Secondly, the similarities are nonetheless build in a systematic manner reminis­ cent of a nearly Darwinian organization of social life, in which every character calmly accepts their predestined place in the chain of evolution. Even in regard to this aspect, Rebreanu manages to eschew reductionism, because the society he describes is not only biologically determined but also shaped by economic capital. Thirdly—and we are now reaching the core of the novel’s zoopoetics—it is crucial to know who is behind the assignment of animalistic features. “Becoming animal” (e.g., a dog) is, as shown previously, a process many of Rebreanu’s characters fear, and simultaneously something many of them and the narrator himself experience. Because the factor emphasizing the absence of morals is precisely the narrator’s animalistic perspective on the world; through this, Rebreanu’s zoopoetics reminds us that, regardless of the differences setting humans, dogs, and other species apart, all are still united by a common animalistic heritage.\n\nNotes 1.
