        "text": "Movie geeks alert! Here’s our pick on the best Mexican movies, from comedy flicks to action blockbusters that will inspire a trip to Mexico.\n\nMexico has a long history of cinematography. It had its golden age during the 1930s, and then it had a resurgence in the past 20 years with a wave of moviemakers introducing a new style of storytelling.\n\nIn this post, we’ve curated a list of the 30 best movies about Mexico that have left a clear mark on the global film landscape. From iconic classics to contemporary gems, these Mexican films will prepare you for your next trip to Mexico.\n\nSo, grab your popcorn (or perhaps some Mexican antojitos) and prepare to embark on a cinematic journey that will entertain and educate you on Mexican history, culture and landscapes.\n\nBest Mexican Movies\n\nMexico has entered 54 films for Oscar consideration throughout its history, with the Academy recognizing nine Mexican films for the prestigious Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nIn this post, we’ve tried to feature only films shot in Mexico, with Mexican involvement in production, direction, and casting. Several of these films have successfully transcended barriers, achieving international fame. Here’s our list of the 30 best movies about Mexico, divided into different categories.\n\nBest Mexican Movies of All Time\n\n1. The Forgotten Ones\n\nThis movie, also known as The Young and the Damned, is a Mexican film made in 1950, capturing the raw life of marginalized youth in Mexico City. Directed by Luis Buñuel, it won the Best Director award at Cannes and was named a UNESCO Memory of the World.\n\nThe story follows Jaibo, a troubled teen, and Pedro, a boy struggling in poverty. Buñuel blends surrealism with the Italian neorealism style, infusing dream sequences and symbolic elements. The plot delves into their struggles, including crime, poverty, and broken families.\n\nTragedy strikes as the characters face betrayal, violence, and, ultimately, their fates. Amidst the chaos, the film captures the grit and hardship of the city’s forgotten ones.\n\nFilmed in: 1950\n\nDirected by: Luis Buñuel\n\nCast: Alfonso Mejía, Stella Inda, Miguel Inclán, Roberto Cobo\n\nClick to watch.\n\n2. Amores Perros\n\nAmores Perros marked Alejandro González Iñárritu’s directorial debut and shot Gael García Bernal to stardom.\n\nThe film weaves multiple storylines around a single incident, earning critical praise and bagging an astonishing 95 million MXN (USD $5,383,503) at the box office, making it Mexico’s fifth highest-grossing film. With eleven Ariel Awards and an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film, it revitalized Mexican cinema after a long hiatus.\n\nThe movie shows three different stories connected by a car crash in Mexico City and the involvement of dogs in the lives of the main characters. The title makes a pun with the word “perros” which means “dogs”, but it is also an expression for something terrible or complicated.\n\nFilmed in: 2000\n\nDirected by: Alejandro González Iñárritu\n\nCast: Emilio Echevarría, Gael García Bernal, Goya Toledo, Álvaro Guerrero\n\nClick to watch.\n\n3. Macario\n\nMacario is a trippy Mexican flick from 1960, mixing horror, drama, and mystery. It follows a poor woodcutter, Macario, obsessed with his poverty and the fear of death. Hungry for a feast all to himself, he encounters the Devil, God, and Death in a forest.\n\nDeath grants him miraculous water but demands his service.
