        "text": "Day 21 – Scared Stiff (1953)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 21: Scared Stiff (1953)\n\nCast: Dean Martin as Larry Todd\n\nJerry Lewis as Myron Mertz\n\nLizabeth Scott as Mary Carroll\n\nCarmen Miranda as Carmelita\n\nBased on The Ghost Breaker play by Charles W. Goddard & Paul Dickey\n\nScreenplay by Herbert Baker & Walter DeLeon\n\nAdditional Dialogue by Ed Simmons & Norman Lear\n\nDirected by George Marshall\n\nPlot: When Larry Todd believes he’s killed a gangster, he and his friend Myron flee the country and become involved with Mary Carroll as she inherits a haunted island near Cuba.\n\nRichard’s Review: Fourteen years after Bob Hope starred in The Ghost Breakers, Paramount Pictures did this remake with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. By this point, Martin and Lewis were firmly established as a top comedic film duo and were still a few years away from the partnership ending. So, being in their prime, Scared Stiff stands out as one of their best. But, how does it compare to Bob Hope’s version?\n\nWhile I really enjoyed Scared Stiff, I prefer the 1940 version. I love the music of Dean Martin but I could have done without some of the other musical numbers, especially those from Carmen Miranda. They didn’t add anything to the movie except to pad out the running time, which turns out to be a little long at 108 minutes. Lewis is funny in playing the role originally filled by Willie Best but that left Martin to be paired up with Lizabeth Scott. Unfortunately, they had virtually no on-screen chemistry as Scott was better suited to film noir roles. All that said, I did enjoy Scared Stiff when I put the original out of my mind. I’d definitely watch it again.\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: This version of the play certainly had more slapstick comedy and musical numbers. I’m not sure they were needed as I really enjoyed the Bob Hope movie. He was better in the lead role and had way more chemistry with Paulette Goddard than Martin had with Lizabeth Scott here. This version also didn’t have as much atmosphere but the sets seemed very similar. I enjoyed Scared Stiff and would watch it again but I prefer The Ghost Breakers.\n\nTrivia:\n\nBob Hope and Bing Crosby have a cameo as two skeletons at the end of the movie. Martin and Lewis appeared in Road to Bali the previous year while Martin had a cameo with Frank Sinatra in Road to Hong Kong (1962).\n\nGeorge Marshall had also directed The Ghost Breakers (1940).\n\nThis was the debut of writer Norman Lear, who went on to become a television legend creating such classics as All in the Family, Good Times and The Jeffersons.\n\nThis was the final film of Carmen Miranda, who also starred with Groucho Marx in Copacabana (1947). She died of a heart attack two years later, in 1955, at the age of 46.\n\nAvailability: Scared Stiff is available as part of the Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis Collection Volume One, which was re-released as part of the Warner Archive Collection. Unfortunately, it has gone out-of-print like the first release, so shop around for a reasonable price.\n\nDay 20 – Invasion of the Vampires (1963)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 20: Invasion of the Vampires (1963)\n\nCast: Erna Bauman as Brunhilda Frankenhausen\n\nRafael del Rio as Dr. Ulises Albarran\n\nTito Junco as Guzman de la Serna\n\nFernando Soto as Crescencio\n\nBertha Moss as Frau Hildegarda\n\nCarlos Agosti as Count Frankenhausen\n\nWritten and Directed by Miguel Morayta\n\nPlot: Dr. Ulises Albarran arrives in a village being plagued by mysterious deaths. Young men are being lured to a lake by a ghostly woman in the night. Is it the work of the devil or could it be a vampire?\n\nRichard’s Review: Despite featuring the returning Count Frankenhausen and Frau Hildegarda, there is really nothing connecting this flick to its predecessor, The Bloody Vampire (1962). It is the superior of the two films, full of atmosphere and creepy dark house sequences. The Count is actually quite good and the story is entertaining. Unfortunately, it’s greatly weakened by the ridiculous vampire bat, not to mention the horrible English dubbing. If you can see the original, that would be the preferred option. That said, I did enjoy this one and would recommend it.\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: This movie was too long for the story it told. I enjoyed the doctor character as he seemed a bit like Van Helsing. The sets were beautiful and very atmospheric. I also loved the story and mood of the film overall. However, the vampire bat was absolutely ludicrous as it looked like a hairy baby with rabbit ears and bad teeth. Yet, it didn’t ruin the film for me and I would definitely watch it again.\n\nTrivia:\n\nDubbed into English by K. Gordon Murray and was a regular feature on late night horror shows.\n\nAvailability: Invasion of the Vampires is relatively easy to find on various DVDs in the English version.\n\nDay 19 – The Bloody Vampire (1962)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 19: The Bloody Vampire (1962)\n\nCast: Begona Palacios as Ignes Cagliostro\n\nRaul Farell as Dr. Ricardo Peisser\n\nErna Bauman as Countess Frankenhausen\n\nCarlos Agosti as Count Frankenhausen\n\nAntonio Raxel as Count Valsamo de Cagliostro\n\nStory and Screenplay by Miguel Morayta\n\nDirected by Miguel Morayta\n\nPlot: Count Cagliostro and his family continue their centuries old pursuit of ridding the world of all vampires. They’ve discovered the Mandragora plant, which can cure a vampire of the disease. However, Count Frankenhausen has other plans as the battle of good vs. evil rages on.\n\nRichard’s Review: The Bloody Vampire started off with a great atmospheric opening segment. We see a mysterious carriage moving silently on a road with no sound of the horse hoofs. The grim reaper appears to be driving with a mysterious figure it’s only passenger. A man is hanging from a tree in the crossroads, wolves howling in the distance and fog creeping along the countryside.\n\nSounds fantastic doesn’t it? Unfortunately, the movie has a hard time living up to that opening as the tale of Count Cagliostro and Count Frankenhausen unravels. I liked all of the actors but, admittedly, the film suffers quite a bit from horrible dubbing. We watched the K. Gordon Murray version and it’s rough. The plot is a little convoluted and it drags on far longer than it should have. There were also some very odd musical choices that almost sounded like church hymns at times. It’s hard to tell if that was from the original or the dubbed version. There might be something more here in its’ original Spanish language version. As it is, I’m not sure I’d watch this version again.\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: I enjoyed the story and wonderful atmosphere present throughout the film. However, the dubbing is horrible and really made it a struggle for me to watch. I could see some good acting but it’s buried under some very unrealistic voices. The music was also quite odd at times. I might watch this one again but there are other Mexican horror classics I’d prefer to rewatch first.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe Frankenhausen saga continued in Invasion of the Vampires (1963).\n\nAvailability: The Bloody Vampire is available on DVD and is worth checking out while you wait for the original to finally be released with subtitles.\n\nDay 18 – El Ataud del Vampiro (1958)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 18: El Ataud del Vampiro (1958)\n\nCast: Abel Salazar as Dr. Enrique Saldivar\n\nAriadna Welter as Marta Gonzalez\n\nGerman Robles as Count Karol de Lavud\n\nStory by Raul Zentano\n\nAdapted by Ramon Obon\n\nDirected by Fernando Mendez\n\nPlot: When the tomb of Count Lavud is broken into and his body stolen, it’s only a matter of time before he is brought back to life to resume his plan of stalking Marta Gonzalez. Will Dr. Saldivar be able to stop once again?\n\nRichard’s Review: While I really enjoyed the first film, El Vampiro (1957), this second adventure with Count Lavud was a bit of a letdown. It started off quite promising with the opening sequence in the graveyard. However, once the story shifted to the hospital, the tone seemed to change. Robles is great once again as the vampire and I enjoyed Abel Salazar but there almost seemed to be too much comedy at certain times. However, some of the moments in the wax museum torture chamber made up for the lesser elements of the film. Nonetheless, I definitely enjoyed it and would watch it again.\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: I really enjoyed El Vampiro (1957), so I was really looking forward to this one. While I was glad to see German Robles back as the Count, this sequel wasn’t quite as good as the first. There were some disjointed elements and I still find his disappearing act odd. Still, the story was fairly interesting and there were some great atmospheric moments, just not as much as the original.\n\nTrivia:\n\nDubbed into English by K. Gordon Murray, The Vampire’s Coffin was featured on Commander USA back in the late 80s.\n\nAvailability: This was originally released by Casanegra as part of The Vampire Collection but it is now out-of-print. You might be able to find the English dub easier but do yourself a favor and search for the original.\n\nDay 17 – Santo contra Las Lobas (1972)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 17: Santo contra Las Lobas (1972)\n\nCast: El Santo as El Santo\n\nRodolfo de Anda as Cesar Harker/Eric Harker\n\nGloria Mayo as Adriana\n\nWritten by Jaime Jimenez Pons & Ramon Obon\n\nDirected by Ruben Galindo & Jaime Jimenez Pons\n\nPlot: A she-wolf leads a pack of werewolves as part of a destined takeover of Earth. Cesar Hacker asks El Santo for help in stopping the wolves as he is a silver symbol of good and the only one who can destroy them.\n\nRichard’s Review: Maybe it was the more modern setting or maybe it was the poor script, but this is my least favorite Santo film to date. The wrestling action seems more of an afterthought and the plot seems to be all over the place. I definitely prefer the Santo films of the 60s over the 70s. That said, I didn’t hate this one but I don’t think I’ll be rewatching it again any time soon.\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: This one was really hard to follow and seemed a lot longer than it really was. It felt like there were too many characters and the fight sequences didn’t seem nearly as good as in previous films. The slightly more modern setting and more violent undertones were oft putting. I don’t think I’ll be watching this one again.\n\nTrivia:\n\nSanto is starting to age a little here as he is not quite as barrel chested or defined as in previous films.\n\nSanto would make 11 more films after Las Lobas, one of which was only a cameo appearance and two that featured Blue Demon.\n\nSanto retired from wrestling and films in 1982 with his last film being The Fury of the Karate Experts. His last wrestling match occurred on September 12 with his son Jorge at ringside, signaling the passing of the torch to El Hijo del Santo.\n\nSanto unmasked briefly on television in late January 1984. One week later, on February 5, he suffered a fatal heart attack and died at the age of 66.\n\nAvailability: You’ll need to do some searching for this Santo film as it’s a harder one to find on DVD with subtitles.\n\nSpecial Thanks: Do yourself a favor and purchase a copy of The Mexican Masked Wrestler and Monster Filmography by Robert Michael “Bobb” Cotter. It has a ton of fantastic information and helped this writer flesh out the reviews for the Santo films.\n\nDay 16 – Santo y Blue Demon contra Los Monstruos (1969)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 16: Santo y Blue Demon contra Los Monstruos (1969)\n\nCast: El Santo as El Santo\n\nBlue Demon as Blue Demon\n\nIvan J. Rado as Otto Halder\n\nCarlos Ancira as Bruno Halder\n\nStory by Jesus Sotomayer Martinez & Rafael Garcia Travesi\n\nScreenplay by Rafael Garvia Travesi\n\nDirected by Gilberto Martinez Solares\n\nPlot: Mad scientist Dr. Halder is resurrected from the dead with plans to rule the world. His army includes some legendary monsters, including Frankenstein and the mummy. It’s up to Santo and Blue Demon to save the day but which side is Blue Demon on?\n\nRichard’s Review: So, you’ve got two wrestling superstars (Santo and Blue Demon), five monsters (Frankenstein/Frankquestain, the mummy, the cyclops, the wolf man, the vampire and the vampire woman), a mad scientist brought back to life, a hunchback sidekick and zombies. You’d think with all that, a plot would just flow naturally but, alas, the result is a bit of a mess.\n\nThe makeup work is a major letdown and the monsters are very lackluster. The plot seems all over the place and we even get recycled scenes. Not to mention the disappointment of seeing an evil Blue Demon, which should have been better than it was. The flick doesn’t deserve all the good vibes it gets. Not sure I’d watch this one again.\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: I thought this was going to be much better than it was. I didn’t care for the monsters being under the control of a mad scientist as their parts could have been played by any ordinary bad guy. And what was up with the vampire’s ears? And how did nobody see them trudge back to the castle? Wrestling was a bigger part of the story, which is a plus, but it was an overall disappointment.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe cyclops is indeed the same creature seen in the cult classic A Ship of Monsters (1960).\n\nThe small creature with the exposed brain is also the same as seen in A Ship of Monsters but without the lights in its eyes.\n\nAvailability: You’ll need to do some searching for this Santo film as it’s a harder one to find on DVD with subtitles.\n\nSpecial Thanks: Do yourself a favor and purchase a copy of The Mexican Masked Wrestler and Monster Filmography by Robert Michael “Bobb” Cotter. It has a ton of fantastic information and helped this writer flesh out the reviews for the Santo films.\n\nDay 15 – The Vampire Doll (1970)\n\nOn the 15th day in the 2018 Countdown to Halloween, we shift gears and head back to the Dread Media podcast for the first entry in the Bloodthirsty Trilogy, The Vampire Doll (1970)!\n\nTake a listen to episode 581 to hear my thoughts on this once-rare Japanese classic. And as always, tell ’em Monster Movie Kid sent ya!\n\nAvailability: The Bloodthirsty Trilogy is available on Blu-ray from Arrow Video.\n\nDay 14 – The Ghost Breakers (1940)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 14: The Ghost Breakers (1940)\n\nCast: Bob Hope as Larry Lawrence\n\nPaulette Goddard as Mary Carter\n\nRichard Carlson as Geoff Montgomery\n\nWillie Best as Alex\n\nBased on The Ghost Breaker play by Paul Dickey & Charles W. Goddard\n\nScreenplay by Walter DeLeon\n\nDirected by George Marshall\n\nPlot: After a radio show host becomes inadvertently involved in the murder of a gangster, he flees to Cuba and helps a young woman who is inheriting a supposedly haunted castle.\n\nRichard’s Review: Bob Hope may be an acquired taste but I really enjoy many of his comedies and The Ghost Breakers is one of my favorites. There is just the right amount of balance between humor and creepy scenery on the island. In fact, there are some great visuals in the mansion on the island, worthy of any traditional horror classic. I also enjoy the Willie Best segments but they can be hard to watch at times. However, it’s not nearly as bad as other films, so it shouldn’t deter you from diving into this one. Highly recommended for a few laughs during the Halloween season.\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: I really loved The Ghost Breakers as it was a fun and entertaining story. I loved that it actually featured a ghost but the zombie part seemed a little out of place, but still funny. I enjoyed the humor and chemistry between Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard. The Willie Best segments were a little hard to watch but not as bad as I expected. I would definitely watch this one again.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe Ghost Breaker play was filmed twice before, in 1914 and 1922, but both silent versions are lost. It was filmed one more time as Scared Stiffin 1953 with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, which featured cameos by Bob Hope and Bing Crosby as skeletons.\n\nThis movie was released less than eight months after The Cat and the Canary after that film was such a success.\n\nBob Hope appeared in two radio adaptations in 1949 and 1951 on Screen Director’s Playhouse.\n\nRichard Carlson would go on to star in several 1950s sci-fi and horror classics, such as Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and It Came from Outer Space (1953).\n\nLloyd Carrigan’s character of Martin has three prominent scenes but is never seen again, leaving viewers to wonder if there were additional scenes that were deleted.\n\nAvailability: The best to add this to your video library is the Bob Hope Classic Comedy Collection. For less than $20, you get The Ghost Breakers and nine other films, including The Cat and the Canary (1939).\n\nDay 13 – Santo en el Museo de Cera (1963)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 13: Santo en el Museo de Cera (1963)\n\nCast: El Santo as El Santo/The Saint\n\nClaudio Brook as Dr. Karol\n\nNorma Mora as Gloria\n\nRuben Rojo as Ricardo Carbajal\n\nStory by Julio Porter & Fernando Galiana\n\nScreenplay by Alfonso Corona Blake\n\nDirected by Alfonso Corona Blake & Manuel San Fernando\n\nPlot: Dr. Karol is up to no good as he is kidnapping people and turning them into real-life exhibits in his wax museum. However, they are still alive and part of his army, with which he plans to conquer the world.\n\nRichard’s Review: This one is a homage to House of Wax and the Dr. Moreau movies. The evil Dr. Karol is turning people into mad wax creations but they are still alive to cause havoc. Then, as should be predicted by now, the creations turn on their mad creator. There is plenty of atmosphere here and a great follow-up to Santo contra Los Mujeres Vampiro. While we don’t see any real classic monsters here, there’s enough other adventure to keep you busy. Definitely recommended viewing!\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: I really loved this one as it feels like a classic horror flick. That was due mostly to the evil scientist turning people into wax and it seemed more credible. Well, it didn’t make my scientific brain hurt as much. I also thought there was a better balance of wrestling in relation to the rest of the story. I’d definitely watch this one again.\n\nTrivia:\n\nOne of the four Santo films dubbed into English and one of the three done by K. Gordon Murray.\n\nAvailability: You’ll need to do some searching for this Santo film as it’s a harder one to find on DVD with subtitles.\n\nSpecial Thanks: Do yourself a favor and purchase a copy of The Mexican Masked Wrestler and Monster Filmography by Robert Michael “Bobb” Cotter. It has a ton of fantastic information and helped this writer flesh out the reviews for the Santo films.\n\nDay 12 – Santo contra Los Mujeres Vampiro (1962)\n\n2018 Countdown to Halloween – Day 12: Santo Contra Las Mujeres Vampiro (1962)\n\nCast: El Santo as El Santo/The Saint\n\nLorena Velazquez as Zorina\n\nMaria Duval as Diana Orlof\n\nJaime Fernandez as Inspector Carolos\n\nAugusto Benedico as Professor Orlof\n\nOfelia Montesco as Tundra\n\nStory by Antonio Orellana, Fernando Oses & Rafael Garcia Travesi\n\nAdapted by Rafael Garcia Travesi\n\nDirected by Alfonso Corona Blake\n\nPlot: Tundra is a vampire priestess must fulfill a prophecy to save Zorina, queen of the vampires. She must turn Diana Orlof into a vampire but Diana’s father seeks the help of Santo to stop the evil vampires before it’s too late.\n\nRichard’s Review: This flick is so much fun and was my introduction to the films of Santo. I’ve seen both the dubbed version and the original Spanish version. Needless to say, if you can watch these films in their original language, that’s always the way to go. There is so much atmosphere in the opening sequence, you know you you’re in for a great time. Sure, there are some crazy plot points and maybe a little too much wrestling at times but Santo is definitely feeling comfortable in his role as our superhero to call on in our hour of need. The wrestling action plays into the story this time and the craziness is simply too fun to pass up. And the ending with Santo lighting the coffins and vampires on fire is fantastic (too bad it is seen in the trailer). Highly recommended!\n\nKarla’s Thoughts: I really liked this one a lot and I can say this is my favorite Santo film so far. There was a little too much wrestling for me and it would cause me to lose track of the story. However, the rest was incredibly atmospheric . I found the way the vampires gathered blood to be unique but a little more convoluted than simply biting someone. Minor flaws aside, I would definitely watch this one again.\n\nTrivia:\n\nLorena Velazquez also starred in another popular cult classic, Las Luchadoras vs. La Momia (1964) aka The Wrestling Women vs. The Aztec Mummy.\n\nOfelia Montesco also starred in Santo vs El Estrangulador (1963).\n\nOne of four Santo films dubbed in English and one of three released in the United States by K. Gordon Murray.\n\nAvailability: You’ll need to do some searching for most of the Santo films. This one is most easily found under the title Samson vs. the Vampire Women but the original with subtitles is, of course, preferred if you can find it.\n\nSpecial Thanks: Do yourself a favor and purchase a copy of The Mexican Masked Wrestler and Monster Filmography by Robert Michael “Bobb” Cotter. It has a ton of fantastic information and helped this writer flesh out the reviews for the Santo films."
