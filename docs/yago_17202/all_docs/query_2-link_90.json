With less than a month to go for the opening of the SITGES - International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia, we know that you're anxious to know all the films and the lineup so you can start getting your schedules in order to get them ready. Well, wait no longer! We bring you a long list of films that will make any genre fan's mouth water, with some of this year's most eagerly awaited and promising horror, sci-fi and fantasy films.  Barcelona, September 12th, 2023. Ángel Sala and Mònica Garcia i Massagué are the key players in the most eagerly awaited press conference (open to the public) for Festival fans, as they present all those productions that we had been preparing since the first announcements we made during July. Big names, debut features, classic gems to be rediscovered... Grab your lists and start taking notes.  Revealing Five Award Winners   We can finally announce five award winners at this year's Festival, five absolute benchmarks in diverse genres and fields of film production. Hideo Nakata, the Japanese director who made everyone's blood run cold with ‘THE RING’ the Japanese director who made everyone's blood run cold with 'THE RING' and who picked up the award for Best Feature Film at the Festival's 1999 edition, will be receiving the Time Machine Award. Nakata is one of the most influential horror directors of the last two decades, being one of the first to export J-horror to the West. In addition, his latest film, ‘THE FORBIDDEN PLAY’ will be screened as part of the Panorama section. Meanwhile, Phil Tippet, creator of the colossal ‘MAD GOD’ and winner of two Academy Awards for his work as visual effects supervisor on 'STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI' and 'JURASSIC PARK', will receive the Honorary Grand Prize. The third award winner is Jan Harlan, producer known for being the man behind Stanley Kubrick's work from 'A CLOCKWORK ORANGE' to 'EYES WIDE SHUT'. In addition, 'THE SHINING', one of his most famous productions, will be screened during the Festival. It has also been confirmed that J. A. Bayona, one of the Festival's favorite sons, on the occasion of the presentation in Sitges of 'SOCIETY OF THE SNOW', his latest work, will receive the Time Machine Award, thus solidifying our relationship (the which broke out with his unforgettable debut, 'THE ORPHANAGE') with one of the most international filmmakers in our cinematography. Finally, the fifth award winner will be Lee Unkrich, director and animator responsible for some of Pixar's greatest hits such as 'TOY STORY 3' or 'COCO', who will receive the Time Machine Award. In addition, Unkrich will be giving a masterclass in which he will talk about his career.  And We Already Have Our Jury for SITGES2023  One of the most fundamental aspects of a good Festival is the presence of a good jury and this year we are extremely proud of the chosen representatives. The members of the Official Selection jury will be French musician, art director and producer Jérome Paillard, Spanish actress Ana Torrent, American director and producer David C. Fein, British film critic and writer Kim Newman and Australian critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas. As for the Noves Visions / Anima’t jury, the three people selected are: actress and art director Katharina Kubrick, multidisciplinary artist and Catalan film director Sergio Caballero and the founder of the film consultancy Moebius Entertainment and member of the Hong Kong Film Critics Society Fred Tsui. Swiss producer Max Karli, the cultural manager Agnela Domínguez and film critic Júlia Olmo will be in charge of allocating the Órbita section's awards. With regard to the critics' jury, the Spanish critics Francesc Miró, Antoni Peris and Ylenia Cañadas will be in charge of presenting the Golden Méliès Award. Another critic and journalist, in his case British, Matthew Turner, Canadian critic and writer Alexandra West and Irish writer Maura McHugh will be the three members of the Méliès d'Argent jury. Jaume Balagueró, director and screenwriter; Marta Grau, screenwriter, writer and script editor, and Alfonso de Vilallonga, cinema composer, vocalist and songwriter, will be part of the Jury of the SGAE Nova Autoria Awards. Some Very Special Screenings   Let's begin our review of the new titles announced with the films that will be part of the Official Fantàstic Selection but not competing for awards. Some of them are among this year's most eagerly awaited, as is the case of ‘POOR THINGS’, the latest film from Yorgos Lanthimos, brand new winner of the Golden Lion at Venice.  A fabulous Emma Stone stars in a story about female empowerment with fantastic touches and the humor that characterizes Lanthimos' work. Another big name, this time national, is J. A. Bayona who will be presenting, ‘SOCIETY OF THE SNOW’ which closed the Venice Film Festival a few days ago. We will also be screening ‘THE BOY AND THE HERON’, the latest film by animation legend Hayao Miyazaki; a movie that has been a smash hit in Japan despite having been released without any kind of promotion: no trailers, no images, not even a synopsis.  Other names featured in these special screenings include one of Spain's most international directors, Daniel Benmayor, who will be presenting, for the first time, the sci-fi thriller ‘AWARENESS’; Portuguese director Gabriel Abrantes will also be arriving with a thriller, ‘AMELIA’S CHILDREN’; if we return to classic science fiction, ‘UFO SWEDEN’ from the Swedish filmmakers' collective Crazy Pictures, is a prime example, as is ‘ALIENS ABDUCTED MY PARENTS AND NOW I FEEL KINDA LEFT OUT’, although in this case American director Jake Van Wagoner plays more in the realm of comedy. The case of 'THE TOXIC AVENGER', the highly anticipated remake of the 1984 cult classic by American director Macon Blair is similar.  And finally, a more classic film that will delight all horror fans: 'BLOOD' by Brad Anderson, a shocking film that, despite its supernatural elements, stands out for the realism that envelops the story.  And for the most extreme fans, we have the two films that will be part of Official Selection’s Midnight Special: ‘GOD IS A BULLET’, action thriller by American director Nick Cassavetes, which features an amazing cast lead by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and ‘THE DEEP DARK’, a chilling example of a monster film directed by Mathie Turi, who was in the Festival 3 years ago with the surprise hit ‘THE TUBE’.  New Contenders in the Official Selection  In our first announcement in July, we gave you a preview of a large part of the lineup in the Official Selection (SO). However, if you thought we were almost finished with the section, you were wrong, because we still have 13 of the very best fantastic genre films to announce.   So let's begin with Japan, a country with two representatives and one of them already knows what it's like to win in Sitges. He did it 20 years ago, with a samurai film entitled ‘THE BLIND SWORDSMAN: ZATOICHi’. That's right, Takeshi Kitano returns to the official selection and to the jidaigeki genre with ‘KUBI’, one of the big sensations at Cannes. Meanwhile, Yûta Shimotsu, the other Japanese director participating in the Official Selection, presents ‘BEST WISHES TO ALL’, a debut feature that explores the limits of what we would do to find happiness. Continuing our journey through Asia, we find a film that is destined to become a cult classic: ‘KILLING ROMANCE’, a blend of love story, suspense and comedy directed by Lee Won-suk.  Added to the previously announced Spanish national representatives is Aritz Moreno, returning to Sitges with the world premiere of ‘MOSCAS’, a thriller that begins with the discovery of a disfigured corpse tied to the trunk of the protagonist's car. Meanwhile, France presents a total of three more films in the Official Selection: ‘LA MORSURE’ directed by Romain de Saint-Blanquat, a supernatural drama about a girl convinced that she's living the last day of her life, ‘SALEM’ directed by Jean-Bernard Marlin, a thriller set in the slums of Marseille that uses the fantastic genre as a vehicle for social criticism, and ‘WAKE UP’, a French production by the Quebec trio known as RKSS, a sample of teenage horror seasoned with the most twisted sense of humor. Another Québécois director present in the Official Selection (SO) is Pascal Plante, who will be bringing an unsettling thriller about the hidden dangers of the internet entitled ‘RED ROOMS’.  One of the debuts of the year, 'THE SEEDING' by American director Barnaby Clay will also be in the Official Selection (SO), a work that is an allegory about the human condition with a horror tone and a strong auteur flavor. Norwegian director Magnus Martens, meanwhile, will transport an American family to a remote cabin in the mountains of Norway, a recipe for terror entitled ‘THERE’S SOMETHING IN THE BARN’. German filmmaker Timm Kröger takes us back to the 1960s with ‘THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING’, an elegant black-and-white thriller set against the backdrop of the fierce nuclear arms race.   The rotoscoped animation of 'WHITE PLASTIC SKY' will also be featured, a film directed by Tibor Bánóczki and Sarolta Szabó set in a post-apocalyptic Budapest. Finally, a sample of folk horror couldn't possibly be absent: ‘SORCERY’ directed by Christopher Murray, a co-production between Chile, Mexico and Germany that takes us to the Chiloé Island for a story about sorcery and revenge. Órbita: the Ultimate Asian Section   The Sitges Film Festival has always been a meeting point for fans of Asian filmmaking and this year the lineup in the Órbita section, reserved for those genres bordering on the fantastic such as thrillers, suspense or action, is proof that SITGES2023 remains faithful to its global spirit. Taking into account the importance of thrillers in this section, it is not at all surprising that South Korea emerges as the queen of the film selection, as four new titles have been added to the previously announced ‘THE ROUNDUP: NO WAY OUT: Um Tae-hwa’s ‘CONCRETE UTOPIA’, a disaster film that was as big a hit at Cannes as it was in Korean box offices this summer, Ahn Tae-jin’s ‘THE NIGHT OWL’, a thriller about a blind acupuncturist who turns out to be the only witness to a murder, Ryoo Seung-wan’s ‘SMUGGLERS’, a crime thriller set in the 1970s in a small coastal town, and ‘THE CHILDE’, a drama with thriller nuances directed by Park Hoon-jung, one of the most acclaimed Korean genre directors (along with Ryoo Seung-wan) of the last decade.  Continuing with Asian films, we find a name that is synonymous with Sitges (he even shot a film here) and that could not be missing: Takashi Miike who brings us ‘LUMBERJACK THE MONSTER’, his latest madness. A thriller from Hong Kong couldn't be absent here either, and Soi Cheang's 'MAD FATE' is joined by 'WHERE THE WIND BLOWS', a film directed by Philip Yung and featuring a stellar cast headed by Tony Leung. Also hailing from the periphery (but on the other side) are 'PROPRIEDADE' by Brazilian director Daniel Bandeira, a claustrophobic story about a traumatized woman forced into an extreme situation and 'THE EXTORTION' by Argentine filmmaker Martino Zaidelis, an ingenious thriller about a pilot forced to collaborate with the national intelligence services.  This section will also include two American films: 'BLACK FLIES', a thriller directed by Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire and starring Tye Sheridan and Sean Penn, and Francis Galluppi's 'THE LAST STOP IN YUMA COUNTY', another thriller where a knife salesman is taken hostage by a group of bank robbers.  And we conclude our tour of Órbita around Europe with four more films: the British action thrillers ‘JACKDAW’ directed by Jamie Childs (making his feature film debut) and 'JERICHO RIDGE' from Will Gilbey, by now a Festival regular; ‘NIGHT OF THE HUNTED’ by French director Franck Khalfoun and 'DIABOLIK: GINKO ATTACKS', the sequel from brothers Antonio and Marco Manetti, who also presented the first installment in Sitges.  Panorama: the Best Contemporary Horror   The Panorama section offers us Spain's premieres of some of this year's most interesting horror movies. This time we'll begin with the USA, the country with the most representatives in this section: Anna Zlokovic presents 'APPENDAGE', a horror film with touches of humor but that is still genuinely terrifying, Larry Fessenden presents a new display of lycanthropic horror with ‘BLACKOUT’, the horror story 'LAST STRAW' narrated from two different angles and directed by Alan Scott Neal and ‘THE SACRIFICE GAME’, the survival story of two young students directed by Jenn Wexler. Also from North America, in this case Mexico, comes 'RABIA', another werewolf film with Jorge Michel Grau behind the cameras. From the other Australian side we find two canonical horror productions: 'GODLESS: THE EASTFIELD EXORCISM', a story based on true events directed by Nick Kozakis and ‘YOU’LL NEVER FIND ME’ directed by Josiah Allen and Indianna Bell.   This section's Asian selection, while not as extensive as in Òrbita, is also very significant with the presence of two Japanese films, ‘#MANHOLE’ from Kazuyoshi Kumakiri and the aforementioned 'THE FORBIDDEN PLAY', the latest film from Hideo Nakata, the Korean 'PROJECT SILENCE' directed by Kim Tae-gon, which premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and the Hong Kong horror-comedy ‘LET IT GHOST’ by Hoi Wong. And finally, regarding our European representatives, a total of four films will compete for this section's award: ‘NINA DEI LUPI’ by Italian director Antonio Pisu, ‘RESTORE POINT’ from Czech director Robert Hloz, ‘SUPERPOSITION’ by Danish filmmaker Karoline Lyngbye and ‘HOOD WITH’ by French director Saïd Belktibia.  Added to all these titles are five films that will be screened out of competition: the Japanese ‘IMMERSION’ by Takashi Shimizu (another big name in J-horror) and both parts of the live-action movie 'TOKYO REVENGERS 2’ directed by Tsutomu Hanabusa; the horror comedy ‘CUANDO LOS AMOS DUERMEN’ by Spanish director Santiago Alvarado Ilarri and the stop motion film 'THE PRIMEVALS', passion project of legendary animator and visual effects supervisor David Allen, which has been completed more than 20 years after his death.  20 Years of Noves Visions  The Noves Visions section, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is ideal for discovering small gems that may not be as commercial or as well-known as the rest. On the occasion of its anniversary, there will be a special screening of 'LE MÉPRIS' by Jean-Luc Godard in 4K, a film that perfectly represents the spirit of the section. For this year's edition, the array of countries represented is so varied that no country has more than two representatives. Among them are Belgium with Jessica Woodworth's 'LUKA' and Luxembourg (with Belgian participation) with Loïc Tanson's 'THE LAST ASHES', Japan with Ryo Takebayashi's 'MONDAYS: SEE YOU \"THIS\" WEEK! ' and 'RIVER' directed by Junta Yamaguchi (auteur of the huge sensation 'BEYOND THE INFINITE TWO MINUTES'), France with Adrien Beau's 'VOURDALAK' and Céline Rouzet's ‘FOR NIGHT WILL COME' and Canada with Jacqueline Castel's 'MY ANIMAL' and Ariane Louis-Seize's 'HUMANIST VAMPIRE SEEKING CONSENTING SUICIDAL PERSON'.  The section's lineup is completed by Greek director Kyros Papavassiliou's 'EMBRYO LARVA BUTTERFLY', Hungarian director Isti Madarász's 'HALFWAY HOME', American director Mike Cheslik's 'HUNDREDS OF BEAVERS', Spanish director Borja de la Vega's ‘LA ÚLTIMA NOCHE DE SANDRA M.’, 'MIMÌ - PRINCE OF DARKNESS' by Italian director Brando de Sica (grandson of the legendary Vittorio De Sica), the Indonesian-Singaporean co-production 'MOTEL MELATI', directed by Mike Wiluan and Billy Christian, 'RAGING GRACE' by British director Paris Zarcilla, 'THE FUNERAL' by Turkish director Orçun Behram, 'THE INVISIBLE FIGHT' by Estonian director Rainer Sarnet and ‘COBWEB' by Korean director Kim Jee-woon, which will close the section.  You’ll Find The Very Best Animation in Anima't   Anima't is undoubtedly one of the Festival's most charming sections. As is usual every year, Japan demonstrates its status as an animation powerhouse, with a total of three in-competition films: ‘KOMADA – A WHISKY FAMILY’, an original story by Masayuki Yoshihara revolving around a family and their workplace; ‘LONELY CASTLE IN THE MIRROR’ from Keiichi Hara, film where mirrors become gateways to other realities and 'SAND LAND', a feature film based on a work by Akira Toriyama (creator of Dragon Ball and the film's writer) directed by Toshihisa Yokoshima.   From Spain we find ‘HEAVIES TENDRES’, the story of two young people who find refuge in heavy metal music and which is directed by Joan Tomàs, Carlos Pérez-Reche and Juanjo Sáez. Czech director Filip Posivac presents 'TONY, SHELLY AND THE MAGIC LIGHT' after winning the special jury award in the Contrechamp section of the Annecy Festival; a touching story of friendship and diversity made using stop motion. Finally, a French production couldn't be missing here: 'MARS EXPRESS' from Jéremie Périn is a film that navigates between science fiction and detective story.   In addition to the films that will be competing, four other features will be screened as part of the Anima’t section: the Japanese films ‘FEAST OF AMRITA’ by Saku Sakamoto and Shojiro Nishimi’s ‘PHOENIX: REMINISCENCE OF FLOWER’; the 1982 classic ‘THE MASTERS OF TIME’ by French filmmaker René Laloux (with character design by Moebius), a screening that, additionally, will be in 4K, and another classic from 1984, namely American filmmaker R. O. Blechman’s ‘THE SOLDIER’S TALE’. These last two screenings will also be part of Sitges Clàssics.  Also in the Anima't section but within the framework of Sitges Clàssics we will have a very special short film session: '100 YEARS OF WALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS: A TRIBUTE TO THEIR SHORT SHORTS'. The screening will include a total of 11 short films, that spans from the 20s and 30s to others from the last decade. Rediscovering Familiar Classics (and Others Not as Familiar)   This year's Sitges Clàssics section presents an excellent combination of classics that need no introduction whatsoever among horror movie fans and other, lesser-known films that deserve recognition. In this first group we would find the 4K versions of William Friedkin's 'THE EXORCIST', Stanley Kubrick's 'THE SHINING' and Robin Hardy's 'THE WICKER MAN'. Other films that we would include in this first group are 'KING KONG', the original version directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, which celebrates its 90th anniversary this year, celebrates its 90th anniversary this year, ‘STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE - THE DIRECTOR'S EDITION', the most recent version of the first Star Trek feature film, or 'THE RAID' by Gareth Evans, which despite not being a classic in terms of its age, is still a classic due to the impact it caused in 2011 when it was screened for the first time in Sitges.  As for the second group, although they aren't as well known, these films are just as interesting: 'SIESTA', Mary Lambert's feature film debut, the fairly recent 'LAKE MICHIGAN MONTSER' by American director Ryland Brickson Cole Tews, 'PSYCHIC VISION: JAGANREI' by Japanese director Teruyoshi Ishii, 'DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING', one of the best films by one of the great masters of giallo, Lucio Fulci, 'THE MASK OF SATAN' by Italian director Lamberto Bava (Honorary Prize winner at this 56th edition), and 'JUNGLE HOLOCAUST' also by and Italian filmmaker, Ruggero Deodato, and the 4K screening of 'Extra Terrestrial Visitors' directed by Juan Piquer Simón. And to round off this year's selection, a double Bruceploitation bill with 'ENTER THE GAME OF DEATH' by Joseph Velasco and 'THE DRAGON LIVES AGAIN' by Chi Chih Lo.  And don’t forget that the retrospective titled 'Ciudad Pánico', which pays tribute to those cities of cinema that become catalysts of terror, will also be held. A total of seven films will be screened within the retrospective: 'DON'T LOOK NOW' by Nicolas Roeg, 'NAKED LUNCH' (4K) by David Cronenberg, 'GOD TOLD ME TO' (4K) by Larry Cohen, 'HOLLYWOOD 90028' ' (4K) by Christina Hornisher, 'THE HOUSE WITHOUT BORDERS' by Pedro Olea, 'LOS ÚLTIMOS DÍAS' by Àlex and David Pastor and 'PÁJAROS DE CIUDAD' by Jose María Sánchez Álvaro.  Non-Fiction at the Sitges Film Festival   The Sitges Festival has also always been committed to non-fiction that reflects on genre and on relevant themes because of the context of the works that have been seen over the course of its history. In the Sitges Documenta section, we can see some of last year's most interesting documentaries on horror and genre films in a more general sense, a large number of which will be arriving from the USA. A few examples are Mark Schniff's 'THE HISTORY OF METAL AND HORROR', which explores the relationship between heavy metal music and horror movies; Kyra Elise Gardner's 'LIVING WITH CHUCKY', a documentary about the franchise featuring the world famous diabolical doll; Alexandre O. Philippe's 'YOU CAN CALL ME BILL' about William Shatner, an actor best known for his role as Captain Kirk in the Star Trek series, or 'KIM'S VIDEO', where viewers will embark on an adventure to recover a legendary collection of movies from a New York video store that have been lost halfway around the world.  And from Great Britain arrive two documentaries that will be participating in this section: Simone Scafidi's 'DARIO ARGENTO PANICO', a closer look at the work of a highly celebrated filmmaker for Festival regulars, and John MacLaverty's 'LOCH NESS: THEY CREATED A MONSTER', which explores the legend of the Loch Ness Monster based on the stories of the local inhabitants and the monster's \"hunters\".   In addition, ‘DREAM TIME’ by Italian director Claudio Lattanzi will also be part of the section, along with five more screening held in the Brigadoon space: ‘UN MILLÓN DE ZOMBIES: LA HISTORIA DE PLAGA ZOMBIE’ by Nicanor Loreti y Camilo de Cabo, ‘THE DARKSIDE OF SOCIETY’ by Larry Wade Carrell, ‘SHARKSPLOITATION’ by Stephen Scarlata, ‘OTRA PELÍCULA MALDITA’ by Alberto Fasce & Mario Varela and ‘MUJERES SIN CENSURA’ by Eva Vizcarra.  Midnight X-Treme: The Section for Night Owls    The Sitges Film Festival has fans of all kinds, and the Midnight X-Treme section is for those who always want more blood, more guts and more dismemberments. This year the lineup will consist of nine films: 'ALL YOU NEED IS BLOOD', by American director Cooper Roberts, 'KILL' by Indian filmmaker Nikhil Nagesh Bhat, 'MAD CATS' by Japanese director Reiki Tsuno; 'OS REVIENTO’ by Spanish director Kike Narcea; 'THE WELL' by Italian director Federico Zampaglione; 'THE WRATH OF BECKY' by American directors Matt Angel and Suzanne Coote, 'TRIGGERED' by Philippine director Richard V. Somas; 'WE ARE ZOMBIES' by the trio of Canadian directors RKS (who will have a double participation at SITGES2023) and 'WINNIE THE POOH: BLOOD AND HONEY', by British director Rhys Frake-Waterfield. Sitges Strengthens its Love Affair with Series  In July, we announced almost all the series that you will be able to enjoy at SITGES2023. As a reminder they were the following: the first two chapters of the 2nd season of '30 COINS', the new work by Álex de la Iglesia; the first three episodes of 'EL OTRO LADO', an original Movistar+ series created by Berto Romero and directed by Javier Ruiz Caldera and Alberto de Toro and the first three chapters of 'ROMANCERO', an original Prime Video series directed by Tomás Peña. To them is added a stellar addition: the first two chapters of Carles Porta's new true crime, 'LIGHT IN THE DARK', an original Movistar+ series, will be screened.  Brigadoon, our other Safe Haven  One more year, the Brigadoon section, the space for projections and free sessions of the Festival, stands as the meeting point for the cinephilia most in love with the titles and the most uninhibited voices of genre cinema. With a complete selection of shorts, features, videoclips and meetings/tributes with artists always to be claimed, Brigadoon will delight the most restless palates with proposals such as 'THORNS', by Douglas Schulze; 'ALLA RICERCA DEL PIACERE', by Silvio Amadio; ‘SHARKSPLOITATION’, by Stephen Scarlata or ‘SAMURAI NINJA ONIMANJI’, by Yoshihiro Nishimura.  Support for the 56th edition   Once again this year, the Festival is grateful for the commitment of all the cooperating institutions and companies: Moritz (main sponsor), Cupra (automotive partner), CaixaBank (strategic partner), TV3 (official TV network), La Vanguardia (official newspaper), Catalunya Ràdio (official radio station) and Meliá Sitges (sponsor and official headquarters).  The Festival confirms its agreements with Aullidos, Cafès Novell, China Madrid, CineAsia, Cineinforme, Cinemania, Cinemascomics, Cinemes Verdi Movie Theaters, Cobega-Coca Cola European Partners,  D.O.

        "text": "The latest creations from Hayao Miyazaki, Yorgos Lanthimos, Takeshi Kitano, Hideo Nakata, and many, many more, will be with us. With less than a month to go for the opening of the SITGES - International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia, we know that you're anxious to know all the films and the lineup so you can start getting your schedules in order to get them ready. Well, wait no longer! We bring you a long list of films that will make any genre fan's mouth water, with some of this year's most eagerly awaited and promising horror, sci-fi and fantasy films.\n\nBarcelona, September 12th, 2023. Ángel Sala and Mònica Garcia i Massagué are the key players in the most eagerly awaited press conference (open to the public) for Festival fans, as they present all those productions that we had been preparing since the first announcements we made during July. Big names, debut features, classic gems to be rediscovered... Grab your lists and start taking notes.\n\nRevealing Five Award Winners\n\nWe can finally announce five award winners at this year's Festival, five absolute benchmarks in diverse genres and fields of film production. Hideo Nakata, the Japanese director who made everyone's blood run cold with ‘THE RING’ the Japanese director who made everyone's blood run cold with 'THE RING' and who picked up the award for Best Feature Film at the Festival's 1999 edition, will be receiving the Time Machine Award. Nakata is one of the most influential horror directors of the last two decades, being one of the first to export J-horror to the West. In addition, his latest film, ‘THE FORBIDDEN PLAY’ will be screened as part of the Panorama section. Meanwhile, Phil Tippet, creator of the colossal ‘MAD GOD’ and winner of two Academy Awards for his work as visual effects supervisor on 'STAR WARS: EPISODE VI - RETURN OF THE JEDI' and 'JURASSIC PARK', will receive the Honorary Grand Prize. The third award winner is Jan Harlan, producer known for being the man behind Stanley Kubrick's work from 'A CLOCKWORK ORANGE' to 'EYES WIDE SHUT'. In addition, 'THE SHINING', one of his most famous productions, will be screened during the Festival. It has also been confirmed that J. A. Bayona, one of the Festival's favorite sons, on the occasion of the presentation in Sitges of 'SOCIETY OF THE SNOW', his latest work, will receive the Time Machine Award, thus solidifying our relationship (the which broke out with his unforgettable debut, 'THE ORPHANAGE') with one of the most international filmmakers in our cinematography. Finally, the fifth award winner will be Lee Unkrich, director and animator responsible for some of Pixar's greatest hits such as 'TOY STORY 3' or 'COCO', who will receive the Time Machine Award. In addition, Unkrich will be giving a masterclass in which he will talk about his career.\n\nAnd We Already Have Our Jury for SITGES2023\n\nOne of the most fundamental aspects of a good Festival is the presence of a good jury and this year we are extremely proud of the chosen representatives. The members of the Official Selection jury will be French musician, art director and producer Jérome Paillard, Spanish actress Ana Torrent, American director and producer David C. Fein, British film critic and writer Kim Newman and Australian critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas. As for the Noves Visions / Anima’t jury, the three people selected are: actress and art director Katharina Kubrick, multidisciplinary artist and Catalan film director Sergio Caballero and the founder of the film consultancy Moebius Entertainment and member of the Hong Kong Film Critics Society Fred Tsui. Swiss producer Max Karli, the cultural manager Agnela Domínguez and film critic Júlia Olmo will be in charge of allocating the Órbita section's awards. With regard to the critics' jury, the Spanish critics Francesc Miró, Antoni Peris and Ylenia Cañadas will be in charge of presenting the Golden Méliès Award. Another critic and journalist, in his case British, Matthew Turner, Canadian critic and writer Alexandra West and Irish writer Maura McHugh will be the three members of the Méliès d'Argent jury. Jaume Balagueró, director and screenwriter; Marta Grau, screenwriter, writer and script editor, and Alfonso de Vilallonga, cinema composer, vocalist and songwriter, will be part of the Jury of the SGAE Nova Autoria Awards.\n\nSome Very Special Screenings\n\nLet's begin our review of the new titles announced with the films that will be part of the Official Fantàstic Selection but not competing for awards. Some of them are among this year's most eagerly awaited, as is the case of ‘POOR THINGS’, the latest film from Yorgos Lanthimos, brand new winner of the Golden Lion at Venice. A fabulous Emma Stone stars in a story about female empowerment with fantastic touches and the humor that characterizes Lanthimos' work. Another big name, this time national, is J. A. Bayona who will be presenting, ‘SOCIETY OF THE SNOW’ which closed the Venice Film Festival a few days ago. We will also be screening ‘THE BOY AND THE HERON’, the latest film by animation legend Hayao Miyazaki; a movie that has been a smash hit in Japan despite having been released without any kind of promotion: no trailers, no images, not even a synopsis.\n\nOther names featured in these special screenings include one of Spain's most international directors, Daniel Benmayor, who will be presenting, for the first time, the sci-fi thriller ‘AWARENESS’; Portuguese director Gabriel Abrantes will also be arriving with a thriller, ‘AMELIA’S CHILDREN’; if we return to classic science fiction, ‘UFO SWEDEN’ from the Swedish filmmakers' collective Crazy Pictures, is a prime example, as is ‘ALIENS ABDUCTED MY PARENTS AND NOW I FEEL KINDA LEFT OUT’, although in this case American director Jake Van Wagoner plays more in the realm of comedy. The case of 'THE TOXIC AVENGER', the highly anticipated remake of the 1984 cult classic by American director Macon Blair is similar.\n\nAnd finally, a more classic film that will delight all horror fans: 'BLOOD' by Brad Anderson, a shocking film that, despite its supernatural elements, stands out for the realism that envelops the story.\n\nAnd for the most extreme fans, we have the two films that will be part of Official Selection’s Midnight Special: ‘GOD IS A BULLET’, action thriller by American director Nick Cassavetes, which features an amazing cast lead by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and ‘THE DEEP DARK’, a chilling example of a monster film directed by Mathie Turi, who was in the Festival 3 years ago with the surprise hit ‘THE TUBE’.\n\nNew Contenders in the Official Selection\n\nIn our first announcement in July, we gave you a preview of a large part of the lineup in the Official Selection (SO). However, if you thought we were almost finished with the section, you were wrong, because we still have 13 of the very best fantastic genre films to announce.\n\nSo let's begin with Japan, a country with two representatives and one of them already knows what it's like to win in Sitges. He did it 20 years ago, with a samurai film entitled ‘THE BLIND SWORDSMAN: ZATOICHi’. That's right, Takeshi Kitano returns to the official selection and to the jidaigeki genre with ‘KUBI’, one of the big sensations at Cannes. Meanwhile, Yûta Shimotsu, the other Japanese director participating in the Official Selection, presents ‘BEST WISHES TO ALL’, a debut feature that explores the limits of what we would do to find happiness. Continuing our journey through Asia, we find a film that is destined to become a cult classic: ‘KILLING ROMANCE’, a blend of love story, suspense and comedy directed by Lee Won-suk.\n\nAdded to the previously announced Spanish national representatives is Aritz Moreno, returning to Sitges with the world premiere of ‘MOSCAS’, a thriller that begins with the discovery of a disfigured corpse tied to the trunk of the protagonist's car. Meanwhile, France presents a total of three more films in the Official Selection: ‘LA MORSURE’ directed by Romain de Saint-Blanquat, a supernatural drama about a girl convinced that she's living the last day of her life, ‘SALEM’ directed by Jean-Bernard Marlin, a thriller set in the slums of Marseille that uses the fantastic genre as a vehicle for social criticism, and ‘WAKE UP’, a French production by the Quebec trio known as RKSS, a sample of teenage horror seasoned with the most twisted sense of humor. Another Québécois director present in the Official Selection (SO) is Pascal Plante, who will be bringing an unsettling thriller about the hidden dangers of the internet entitled ‘RED ROOMS’.\n\nOne of the debuts of the year, 'THE SEEDING' by American director Barnaby Clay will also be in the Official Selection (SO), a work that is an allegory about the human condition with a horror tone and a strong auteur flavor. Norwegian director Magnus Martens, meanwhile, will transport an American family to a remote cabin in the mountains of Norway, a recipe for terror entitled ‘THERE’S SOMETHING IN THE BARN’. German filmmaker Timm Kröger takes us back to the 1960s with ‘THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING’, an elegant black-and-white thriller set against the backdrop of the fierce nuclear arms race.\n\nThe rotoscoped animation of 'WHITE PLASTIC SKY' will also be featured, a film directed by Tibor Bánóczki and Sarolta Szabó set in a post-apocalyptic Budapest. Finally, a sample of folk horror couldn't possibly be absent: ‘SORCERY’ directed by Christopher Murray, a co-production between Chile, Mexico and Germany that takes us to the Chiloé Island for a story about sorcery and revenge.\n\nÓrbita: the Ultimate Asian Section\n\nThe Sitges Film Festival has always been a meeting point for fans of Asian filmmaking and this year the lineup in the Órbita section, reserved for those genres bordering on the fantastic such as thrillers, suspense or action, is proof that SITGES2023 remains faithful to its global spirit. Taking into account the importance of thrillers in this section, it is not at all surprising that South Korea emerges as the queen of the film selection, as four new titles have been added to the previously announced ‘THE ROUNDUP: NO WAY OUT: Um Tae-hwa’s ‘CONCRETE UTOPIA’, a disaster film that was as big a hit at Cannes as it was in Korean box offices this summer, Ahn Tae-jin’s ‘THE NIGHT OWL’, a thriller about a blind acupuncturist who turns out to be the only witness to a murder, Ryoo Seung-wan’s ‘SMUGGLERS’, a crime thriller set in the 1970s in a small coastal town, and ‘THE CHILDE’, a drama with thriller nuances directed by Park Hoon-jung, one of the most acclaimed Korean genre directors (along with Ryoo Seung-wan) of the last decade.\n\nContinuing with Asian films, we find a name that is synonymous with Sitges (he even shot a film here) and that could not be missing: Takashi Miike who brings us ‘LUMBERJACK THE MONSTER’, his latest madness. A thriller from Hong Kong couldn't be absent here either, and Soi Cheang's 'MAD FATE' is joined by 'WHERE THE WIND BLOWS', a film directed by Philip Yung and featuring a stellar cast headed by Tony Leung. Also hailing from the periphery (but on the other side) are 'PROPRIEDADE' by Brazilian director Daniel Bandeira, a claustrophobic story about a traumatized woman forced into an extreme situation and 'THE EXTORTION' by Argentine filmmaker Martino Zaidelis, an ingenious thriller about a pilot forced to collaborate with the national intelligence services.\n\nThis section will also include two American films: 'BLACK FLIES', a thriller directed by Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire and starring Tye Sheridan and Sean Penn, and Francis Galluppi's 'THE LAST STOP IN YUMA COUNTY', another thriller where a knife salesman is taken hostage by a group of bank robbers.\n\nAnd we conclude our tour of Órbita around Europe with four more films: the British action thrillers ‘JACKDAW’ directed by Jamie Childs (making his feature film debut) and 'JERICHO RIDGE' from Will Gilbey, by now a Festival regular; ‘NIGHT OF THE HUNTED’ by French director Franck Khalfoun and 'DIABOLIK: GINKO ATTACKS', the sequel from brothers Antonio and Marco Manetti, who also presented the first installment in Sitges.\n\nPanorama: the Best Contemporary Horror\n\nThe Panorama section offers us Spain's premieres of some of this year's most interesting horror movies. This time we'll begin with the USA, the country with the most representatives in this section: Anna Zlokovic presents 'APPENDAGE', a horror film with touches of humor but that is still genuinely terrifying, Larry Fessenden presents a new display of lycanthropic horror with ‘BLACKOUT’, the horror story 'LAST STRAW' narrated from two different angles and directed by Alan Scott Neal and ‘THE SACRIFICE GAME’, the survival story of two young students directed by Jenn Wexler. Also from North America, in this case Mexico, comes 'RABIA', another werewolf film with Jorge Michel Grau behind the cameras. From the other Australian side we find two canonical horror productions: 'GODLESS: THE EASTFIELD EXORCISM', a story based on true events directed by Nick Kozakis and ‘YOU’LL NEVER FIND ME’ directed by Josiah Allen and Indianna Bell.\n\nThis section's Asian selection, while not as extensive as in Òrbita, is also very significant with the presence of two Japanese films, ‘#MANHOLE’ from Kazuyoshi Kumakiri and the aforementioned 'THE FORBIDDEN PLAY', the latest film from Hideo Nakata, the Korean 'PROJECT SILENCE' directed by Kim Tae-gon, which premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and the Hong Kong horror-comedy ‘LET IT GHOST’ by Hoi Wong. And finally, regarding our European representatives, a total of four films will compete for this section's award: ‘NINA DEI LUPI’ by Italian director Antonio Pisu, ‘RESTORE POINT’ from Czech director Robert Hloz, ‘SUPERPOSITION’ by Danish filmmaker Karoline Lyngbye and ‘HOOD WITH’ by French director Saïd Belktibia.\n\nAdded to all these titles are five films that will be screened out of competition: the Japanese ‘IMMERSION’ by Takashi Shimizu (another big name in J-horror) and both parts of the live-action movie 'TOKYO REVENGERS 2’ directed by Tsutomu Hanabusa; the horror comedy ‘CUANDO LOS AMOS DUERMEN’ by Spanish director Santiago Alvarado Ilarri and the stop motion film 'THE PRIMEVALS', passion project of legendary animator and visual effects supervisor David Allen, which has been completed more than 20 years after his death.\n\n20 Years of Noves Visions\n\nThe Noves Visions section, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is ideal for discovering small gems that may not be as commercial or as well-known as the rest. On the occasion of its anniversary, there will be a special screening of 'LE MÉPRIS' by Jean-Luc Godard in 4K, a film that perfectly represents the spirit of the section. For this year's edition, the array of countries represented is so varied that no country has more than two representatives. Among them are Belgium with Jessica Woodworth's 'LUKA' and Luxembourg (with Belgian participation) with Loïc Tanson's 'THE LAST ASHES', Japan with Ryo Takebayashi's 'MONDAYS: SEE YOU \"THIS\" WEEK! ' and 'RIVER' directed by Junta Yamaguchi (auteur of the huge sensation 'BEYOND THE INFINITE TWO MINUTES'), France with Adrien Beau's 'VOURDALAK' and Céline Rouzet's ‘FOR NIGHT WILL COME' and Canada with Jacqueline Castel's 'MY ANIMAL' and Ariane Louis-Seize's 'HUMANIST VAMPIRE SEEKING CONSENTING SUICIDAL PERSON'.\n\nThe section's lineup is completed by Greek director Kyros Papavassiliou's 'EMBRYO LARVA BUTTERFLY', Hungarian director Isti Madarász's 'HALFWAY HOME', American director Mike Cheslik's 'HUNDREDS OF BEAVERS', Spanish director Borja de la Vega's ‘LA ÚLTIMA NOCHE DE SANDRA M.’, 'MIMÌ - PRINCE OF DARKNESS' by Italian director Brando de Sica (grandson of the legendary Vittorio De Sica), the Indonesian-Singaporean co-production 'MOTEL MELATI', directed by Mike Wiluan and Billy Christian, 'RAGING GRACE' by British director Paris Zarcilla, 'THE FUNERAL' by Turkish director Orçun Behram, 'THE INVISIBLE FIGHT' by Estonian director Rainer Sarnet and ‘COBWEB' by Korean director Kim Jee-woon, which will close the section.\n\nYou’ll Find The Very Best Animation in Anima't\n\nAnima't is undoubtedly one of the Festival's most charming sections. As is usual every year, Japan demonstrates its status as an animation powerhouse, with a total of three in-competition films: ‘KOMADA – A WHISKY FAMILY’, an original story by Masayuki Yoshihara revolving around a family and their workplace; ‘LONELY CASTLE IN THE MIRROR’ from Keiichi Hara, film where mirrors become gateways to other realities and 'SAND LAND', a feature film based on a work by Akira Toriyama (creator of Dragon Ball and the film's writer) directed by Toshihisa Yokoshima.\n\nFrom Spain we find ‘HEAVIES TENDRES’, the story of two young people who find refuge in heavy metal music and which is directed by Joan Tomàs, Carlos Pérez-Reche and Juanjo Sáez. Czech director Filip Posivac presents 'TONY, SHELLY AND THE MAGIC LIGHT' after winning the special jury award in the Contrechamp section of the Annecy Festival; a touching story of friendship and diversity made using stop motion. Finally, a French production couldn't be missing here: 'MARS EXPRESS' from Jéremie Périn is a film that navigates between science fiction and detective story.\n\nIn addition to the films that will be competing, four other features will be screened as part of the Anima’t section: the Japanese films ‘FEAST OF AMRITA’ by Saku Sakamoto and Shojiro Nishimi’s ‘PHOENIX: REMINISCENCE OF FLOWER’; the 1982 classic ‘THE MASTERS OF TIME’ by French filmmaker René Laloux (with character design by Moebius), a screening that, additionally, will be in 4K, and another classic from 1984, namely American filmmaker R. O. Blechman’s ‘THE SOLDIER’S TALE’. These last two screenings will also be part of Sitges Clàssics.\n\nAlso in the Anima't section but within the framework of Sitges Clàssics we will have a very special short film session: '100 YEARS OF WALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS: A TRIBUTE TO THEIR SHORT SHORTS'. The screening will include a total of 11 short films, that spans from the 20s and 30s to others from the last decade.\n\nRediscovering Familiar Classics (and Others Not as Familiar)\n\nThis year's Sitges Clàssics section presents an excellent combination of classics that need no introduction whatsoever among horror movie fans and other, lesser-known films that deserve recognition. In this first group we would find the 4K versions of William Friedkin's 'THE EXORCIST', Stanley Kubrick's 'THE SHINING' and Robin Hardy's 'THE WICKER MAN'. Other films that we would include in this first group are 'KING KONG', the original version directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, which celebrates its 90th anniversary this year, celebrates its 90th anniversary this year, ‘STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE - THE DIRECTOR'S EDITION', the most recent version of the first Star Trek feature film, or 'THE RAID' by Gareth Evans, which despite not being a classic in terms of its age, is still a classic due to the impact it caused in 2011 when it was screened for the first time in Sitges.\n\nAs for the second group, although they aren't as well known, these films are just as interesting: 'SIESTA', Mary Lambert's feature film debut, the fairly recent 'LAKE MICHIGAN MONTSER' by American director Ryland Brickson Cole Tews, 'PSYCHIC VISION: JAGANREI' by Japanese director Teruyoshi Ishii, 'DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING', one of the best films by one of the great masters of giallo, Lucio Fulci, 'THE MASK OF SATAN' by Italian director Lamberto Bava (Honorary Prize winner at this 56th edition), and 'JUNGLE HOLOCAUST' also by and Italian filmmaker, Ruggero Deodato, and the 4K screening of 'Extra Terrestrial Visitors' directed by Juan Piquer Simón. And to round off this year's selection, a double Bruceploitation bill with 'ENTER THE GAME OF DEATH' by Joseph Velasco and 'THE DRAGON LIVES AGAIN' by Chi Chih Lo.\n\nAnd don’t forget that the retrospective titled 'Ciudad Pánico', which pays tribute to those cities of cinema that become catalysts of terror, will also be held. A total of seven films will be screened within the retrospective: 'DON'T LOOK NOW' by Nicolas Roeg, 'NAKED LUNCH' (4K) by David Cronenberg, 'GOD TOLD ME TO' (4K) by Larry Cohen, 'HOLLYWOOD 90028' ' (4K) by Christina Hornisher, 'THE HOUSE WITHOUT BORDERS' by Pedro Olea, 'LOS ÚLTIMOS DÍAS' by Àlex and David Pastor and 'PÁJAROS DE CIUDAD' by Jose María Sánchez Álvaro.\n\nNon-Fiction at the Sitges Film Festival\n\nThe Sitges Festival has also always been committed to non-fiction that reflects on genre and on relevant themes because of the context of the works that have been seen over the course of its history. In the Sitges Documenta section, we can see some of last year's most interesting documentaries on horror and genre films in a more general sense, a large number of which will be arriving from the USA. A few examples are Mark Schniff's 'THE HISTORY OF METAL AND HORROR', which explores the relationship between heavy metal music and horror movies; Kyra Elise Gardner's 'LIVING WITH CHUCKY', a documentary about the franchise featuring the world famous diabolical doll; Alexandre O. Philippe's 'YOU CAN CALL ME BILL' about William Shatner, an actor best known for his role as Captain Kirk in the Star Trek series, or 'KIM'S VIDEO', where viewers will embark on an adventure to recover a legendary collection of movies from a New York video store that have been lost halfway around the world.\n\nAnd from Great Britain arrive two documentaries that will be participating in this section: Simone Scafidi's 'DARIO ARGENTO PANICO', a closer look at the work of a highly celebrated filmmaker for Festival regulars, and John MacLaverty's 'LOCH NESS: THEY CREATED A MONSTER', which explores the legend of the Loch Ness Monster based on the stories of the local inhabitants and the monster's \"hunters\".\n\nIn addition, ‘DREAM TIME’ by Italian director Claudio Lattanzi will also be part of the section, along with five more screening held in the Brigadoon space: ‘UN MILLÓN DE ZOMBIES: LA HISTORIA DE PLAGA ZOMBIE’ by Nicanor Loreti y Camilo de Cabo, ‘THE DARKSIDE OF SOCIETY’ by Larry Wade Carrell, ‘SHARKSPLOITATION’ by Stephen Scarlata, ‘OTRA PELÍCULA MALDITA’ by Alberto Fasce & Mario Varela and ‘MUJERES SIN CENSURA’ by Eva Vizcarra.\n\nMidnight X-Treme: The Section for Night Owls\n\nThe Sitges Film Festival has fans of all kinds, and the Midnight X-Treme section is for those who always want more blood, more guts and more dismemberments. This year the lineup will consist of nine films: 'ALL YOU NEED IS BLOOD', by American director Cooper Roberts, 'KILL' by Indian filmmaker Nikhil Nagesh Bhat, 'MAD CATS' by Japanese director Reiki Tsuno; 'OS REVIENTO’ by Spanish director Kike Narcea; 'THE WELL' by Italian director Federico Zampaglione; 'THE WRATH OF BECKY' by American directors Matt Angel and Suzanne Coote, 'TRIGGERED' by Philippine director Richard V. Somas; 'WE ARE ZOMBIES' by the trio of Canadian directors RKS (who will have a double participation at SITGES2023) and 'WINNIE THE POOH: BLOOD AND HONEY', by British director Rhys Frake-Waterfield.\n\nSitges Strengthens its Love Affair with Series\n\nIn July, we announced almost all the series that you will be able to enjoy at SITGES2023. As a reminder they were the following: the first two chapters of the 2nd season of '30 COINS', the new work by Álex de la Iglesia; the first three episodes of 'EL OTRO LADO', an original Movistar+ series created by Berto Romero and directed by Javier Ruiz Caldera and Alberto de Toro and the first three chapters of 'ROMANCERO', an original Prime Video series directed by Tomás Peña. To them is added a stellar addition: the first two chapters of Carles Porta's new true crime, 'LIGHT IN THE DARK', an original Movistar+ series, will be screened.\n\nBrigadoon, our other Safe Haven\n\nOne more year, the Brigadoon section, the space for projections and free sessions of the Festival, stands as the meeting point for the cinephilia most in love with the titles and the most uninhibited voices of genre cinema. With a complete selection of shorts, features, videoclips and meetings/tributes with artists always to be claimed, Brigadoon will delight the most restless palates with proposals such as 'THORNS', by Douglas Schulze; 'ALLA RICERCA DEL PIACERE', by Silvio Amadio; ‘SHARKSPLOITATION’, by Stephen Scarlata or ‘SAMURAI NINJA ONIMANJI’, by Yoshihiro Nishimura.\n\nSupport for the 56th edition\n\nOnce again this year, the Festival is grateful for the commitment of all the cooperating institutions and companies: Moritz (main sponsor), Cupra (automotive partner), CaixaBank (strategic partner), TV3 (official TV network), La Vanguardia (official newspaper), Catalunya Ràdio (official radio station) and Meliá Sitges (sponsor and official headquarters).\n\nThe Festival confirms its agreements with Aullidos, Cafès Novell, China Madrid, CineAsia, Cineinforme, Cinemania, Cinemascomics, Cinemes Verdi Movie Theaters, Cobega-Coca Cola European Partners, D.O.
