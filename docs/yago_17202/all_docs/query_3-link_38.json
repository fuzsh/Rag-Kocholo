        "text": "The following is a running list of Lucha Libre related milestones and Lucha Libre movies from Mexico up to 1969. There's plenty of stuff between 1970 and the 90's as well, but I felt like I had to cap this list because it was a lot. Most movies are listed by the exact release date, but some are listed with a year because their release date is unknown. I only looked at movies from Mexico. Other Latin American countries might have their own Lucha Libre movies as well, but I'm not knowledgeable in them.\n\nI want to give a huge credit to the Grandes Figuras De La Lucha Libre magazine. Most of this information comes from them.\n\nAlso, people might be interested to know that many of these movies are on Youtube.\n\n01-15-1918 - Maciste Turista (Maciste The Tourist) - An Italian production about a Hercules-like Italian hero named Maciste.
