        "text": "In this course, students will have contact with a general history of Latin American Cinema. Based on guided weekly discussions about a film and an academic article, students will engage with different concepts that are core in the field of FILM STUDIES and LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES. /// The course will approach these fields from a multi and interdisciplinary perspective to examine the educational, cultural, social, political, geographic, economic, and artistic contributions scholars and workers from the film industries of Latin America have brought to our society. /// This course holds to the field of CULTURAL STUDIES to investigate memory, archive, feelings, and affects, aiming to offer a new perspective about Latin America to the students.\n\nThis is the concluding chapter of the book 'The New Latin American Cinema: Readings from Within' (eds. Chakravarty et al, Celluloid Chapter, Calcutta, 1998) http://www.amazon.com/Latin-American-Cinema-Readings-Within/dp/B003DRQUWE Written in 1998, this essay outlines the achievements of the 'New' Cinema in Latin America, raising questions about some of its cultural assumptions while drawing attention to an emerging new 'New' cinema as the cultural paradigm undergoes a major shift in the 1990s."
