        "text": "A list of zombie movies. This zombie movies list features any film that deals with the undead walking around looking for brains. Over the past few years, zombie movies have become some of the most popular films that have been released by Hollywood. The big movie studios know what sells, and people can't get enough of zombie movies. Smaller independent filmmakers also love featuring the undead, so the best indie examples of the genre are also on this list of zombie movies. From Night of the Living Dead to 28 Days Later, all of the classic zombie movies are here.\n\nOriginally meant to scare the life out of people, zombie movies have taken on a new life. There are different genres within the scope of zombie movies, including comedies, thrillers, and dramas. There are even zombie movies based on books. Zombieland and World War Z are two examples of zombie movies that were critical and commercial hits at the box office. There's a reason why big stars like Brad Pitt are willing to participate in a movie about something that didn't sell as recently as 20 years ago. These movies are huge hits, and there's a good reason why: people can't get enough of zombies.\n\nSee which zombie movies and other horror films are currently streaming on Netflix Instant and Amazon Prime.\n\nWhen you see the names on this list, you should be too surprised that there are some zombie comedies on this list. Edgar Wright's and Simon Pegg's Shaun of the Dead had a lot to do with the growing popularity of the zombie comedy. So if there's ever been a movie about zombies ever made, it's likely on this list."
