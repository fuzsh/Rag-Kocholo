        "text": "The last time that I really paid any attention to professional wrestling, Hulk Hogan was body slamming The Iron Shiek back in the eighties. However I did see Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in “G.I. Joe: Retaliation”, and recently watched John Carpenter’s cult classic “They Live” starring “Rowdy” Roddy Piper. Heck, even Santo was fighting zombies onscreen back in 1961… a full seven years before Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead” ! So I suppose that professional wrestlers actually have a pretty long and notable history in film.\n\n“Pro Wrestlers Vs. Zombies” is an upcoming movie that intends to continue that grand tradition! Despite being your average low-budget zombie film, it has managed to gain a huge amount press and support by featuring an epic cast of popular professional wrestlers such as “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan, Matt Hardy, Shane Douglas and Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle.\n\nWith a promise to focus on traditional wrestling moves and “Good Old American Violence,” the filmmakers ran a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign last month and recently released their first trailer online, which you can watch above! But to learn even more about the film including the complete cast of professional wrestlers, behind-the-scenes photos and additional details, simply stop by the “Pro Wrestlers Vs. Zombies” website or visit the official Facebook page online!"
