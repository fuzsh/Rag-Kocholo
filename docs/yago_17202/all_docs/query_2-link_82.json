        "text": "CURSE OF THE DOLL PEOPLE (1961)\n\nDirector: Benito Alazraki\n\nBeverly Wilshire Filmworks/Telefilms International\n\nFor obvious reasons, this K. Gordon Murray presentation of a Mexican-made film stands out in the minds of fans who caught it on television in the 60s and 70s. I saw it in the mid-70s on New York's Channel 9 on a Saturday afternoon double-billing with Bert I. Gordon's VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS (a clever pairing) and I never forgot it.\n\nThe plot has a group of archeologists defiling a voodoo temple by stealing a sacred idol. They are cursed by a voodoo priest, who forewarns that they and their families will die horrible deaths. Each of the men killed are turned into small, three feet dolls (played by either midgets are children in disturbing masks) which are then animated as killer zombies. The dolls go around pricking their victims with large needles, and the real eerie part about it is that they assume the likeness of the men that they just killed!\n\nAside from the bad dubbing--including a half a dozen people screaming as if they were a theater audience, and a wolf from one of those \"Sounds of Horror\" Halloween records howling every time something scary happens--it's quite atmospheric and chilling. The masks on the tiny actors are stationary (they are supposed to be dolls), but are quite unsettling, and they actually pull their roles off convincingly. One of them even wears glasses, and he's the one that prevents the others from stabbing a little girl getting a glass of water in the middle of the night.\n\nThe voodoo priest (Quint√≠n Bulnes with long hair, mustache, and a snake drawn on his robe) also has a full-sized zombie that resembles the title creature in Edward L. Cahn's VOODOO WOMAN (1957). A truly odd scene has the rotting corpse summon one of the little dolls like a pied piper, then walking off with him, patting him on the head for doing a deed for his master! The climatic good vs. evil confrontation, adorned with the high priest's impressive black magic paraphernalia, is very reminiscent of the finale of HORROR HOTEL, made around the same time.\n\nBeverly Wilshire's transfer source utilizes an American International 16mm TV print. Aside from some lines, messy reel change marks, and some scratchiness in the overall good soundtrack, the disc looks good for what it is. This is probably the best that we'll ever see this moody, black and white import, and it truly recaptures the feeling of watching it on television in better days. As usual with these Beverly Wilshire releases, the presentation is inferior in every way (just look at that cover art, and no credits or stills from the film on the packaging). But even with five lame chapters with epithets like \"The First One\" and \"Special,\" you won't want to let this disc get away! (George R. Reis)\n\nBACK TO REVIEWS"
