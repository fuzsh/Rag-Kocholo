So let me first thank all those people who put that original project into motion and who believed in it enough to support it even when it didn’t seem to fit in the fields it was supposed to: José David Saldívar, Norma Alarcón, Waldo Martin, and Mike Rogin, my committee members at UC Berkeley who first green-lighted these ideas and gave me the tools to make sense of them. But please don’t hold them responsible: none of my missteps are theirs. José, in particular, was an unbelievable ally and a nurturing guide, sharing his archive, helping me to build my own, and teaching me about the profession. Norma recognized early on that no matter how much theory she shined her light on, I was “meat and potatoes” from the jump, and Waldo made it safe for me to talk music, write about Jews, and not take it all so seriously. Other vital Berkeley guides were David Lloyd, Julio Ramos, June Jordan, Alfred Arteaga, Genaro Padilla, Kathy Moran, and Catherine Gallagher. My partners in grad school crime, Catherine Ramírez and Glenda Carpio, were indispensable to my sanity during those years, and I greatly benefited from workshop conversations with Viet Nguyen and Rhacel Parrenas. I also learned tremendous amounts from my conversations with Eric Porter. I would never have even made it that far without the undergraduate guidance of Duke University’s Satti Khana, Susan Willis, Walter Mignolo, Frank Lentricchia, and most of all, xi\n\nthe miraculous Eve Sedgwick, who was probably the first person who showed me that what you write can change the world around you. “What is it, this genealogy that isn’t genetic?” Nathan Zuckerman asks in Philip Roth’s I Married A Communist. I started asking myself the same question when I met Michael Rogin. I would never have survived graduate school without him, the first “chosen parent” of my adulthood, a mentor that I grew lucky enough to call a friend. What can I say—he taught me how to think, showed me new ways to inhabit Jewishness, reminded me what politics were for, asked brow-wrinkling questions, held my hand, inspired madness, never made me feel alone. The world isn’t right without him ranting through it, and I miss him every single day that I put pen to paper. This book is not worthy of being a tribute to him, and I can only hope that one day I’ll write something that will be. David Meltzer was another Bay Area mentor who fell from the sky to show me that public intellectuals actually do roam the earth. He proved to me that it’s possible to live inside your ideas, to think hard, to believe in writing and words and poems, impossible music and impossible alliances. Our coffee klatches saved this book from itself each time. I was also blessed to find Tom Tompkins, who became my editor at the San Francisco Bay Guardian and one of my dearest friends. He pushed me to finish this thing, kept my convictions in check, and always knew when my words weren’t telling the truth. Many of these ideas got rehearsed, often unwittingly, on his pages, and I thank him for his generosity and support. From my year teaching at the Five Colleges, I deeply thank my colleagues Emily Bernard, Amy Kaplan, Robert Schwartzwald, Barry O’Connell, Andy Parker, Donald Weber, Lisa Henderson, Mary Russo, Michelle Stephens, and Christoph Cox for their kindness, warmth, and support for an L.A. boy suffering through his first teaching year and his first winter. Most of all, I thank Elisabeth Subrin, who I treasure as a beloved friend, intellectual sparring partner, fashion guru, and long-distance therapist. Finding a home in the English department at UC Riverside was a blessing, and I’ve been lucky enough to be surrounded by tremendous colleagues who have given me creative space and intellectual community— two of the rarest things in this profession. George Haggerty, Emory Elliott, John Ganim, Carol Anne Tyler, Parama Roy, Jennifer Doyle, Joe Childers, John Briggs, Margie Waller, Tiffany Ana Lopez, Steve Axelrod, Katherine Kinney—I hope this book does all your own work and teaching justice. A special thanks is due to Traise Yamamoto, who always tells me what books I should be reading and who is always a writer before anything else. It xii\n\nacknowledgments\n\nwould have taken me far longer to finish this if it weren’t for her insistence on keeping me focused. Having her three doors down has been a lifeline. Other UCR folks are on these pages too: Alicia Arrizon, Anna Scott, Hershini Bhana, Karen Rapp, as well as Dean Pat O’Brien, who I am incredibly grateful to for her continued support of my work. But especially Philip Brett—the most sensitive and generous scholar I’ve ever been fortunate enough to look up to. He remains an unending inspiration, and he’s on my shoulder every time I carry a boom box across campus. Funding from the UCR Academic Senate, the Regents Faculty Fellowship, the Center for Ideas and Society, the UC Humanities Research Institute, and most of all the UC President’s Research Fellowship in the Humanities awarded me the time and space necessary to complete this book. I deeply thank David Theo Goldberg at UCHRI for his support and my UCHRI resident working group on “Placing Popular Music” (Gayle Wald, Anthony Macias, Herman Gray, Gayatri Gopinath, Jocelyne Guilbaut, Raul Fernandez, Michelle Habel-Pallan, and our guests Daphne Brooks, Sherri Tucker, and Jim Fricke) for reminding me what this book was about and giving me a new set of tools to finish it off. Thanks are also due to New York University’s Hemispheric Institute for Performance and Politics, especially Diana Taylor, Jill Lane, and Ayanna Lee, who have been thoughtful supporters of my work. I’d like to think that the Institute’s yearly “encuentros” kept the ideas in this book charted on the right American map. There is simply no way this book would exist without George Lipsitz, who long ago convinced me not to quit academia. He has opened so many doors for so many young scholars—and showed us what to do once we got there—and I’m seriously lucky if any of this honors him the way it ought to. His lengthy comments on the original version of the manuscript guided its facelift every step of the way, and I’m humbled if any of my changes reflect his passions, his unceasing commitments, his humor, and his courage. This book began in Northern California, but ended up back home in L.A. I thank Ruben “Funkahuatl” Guevara, Jesus “Xiuy” Velo, and Marisela Norte for sharing their knowledge and for so generously opening their lives to a pushy white kid from the Westside. Lunches with Lewis Macadams kept my mind revved up, and the Sundance Institute’s Ken Brecher, Louise Steinman, and Jason Shinder all made me believe in writing again. Ever since I was an undergraduate, José Muñoz has showed me the twists and turns of academia. I cherish him in so many ways, and this book wouldn’t have gotten off the ground without his reading lists and explanations, his smarts, his unconditional tutelage, and his unconditional support acknowledgments\n\nxiii\n\nof my bad television habits. David Roman has been both unswerving advocate and frank critic and is easily the best company over a bowl of mishmosh in a booth at Canter’s anyone could ask for. And Gayle Wald has been a cross-coastal co-conspirator from the very start of this book, and though she’s heard pretty much of all this stuff before, any sense it all makes is in large part due to her friendship, wisdom, and critical readings. Popular music should be thankful she’s out there thinking about it. Ron Katz, Grace Katz, and Joel Grey kindly supported my work on Mickey Katz and opened their family to me. I hope my work honors his memory and respects his legacy as it should. Laffite “Blood In, Blood Out” Benitez, Marusa Reyes, Julieta Venegas, Alex Zuniga, Luis Guerena, Lynn “Portnoy” Faintchein, Cecilia Bastida, Camilo Lara, and Pacho are all the secret string-pullers for Chapter 6. They gave me the keys to the rock en español world and have never stopped keeping me in line and up-to-date. The Conclusion was helped along by super-manager/super-friend Amy Blackman (thank you for everything) and the Ozomatli crew, especially Wil-Dog and Uli, who have always been gracious about sharing their ideas and answering my questions. It took shape as a lecture I delivered in 2000 at L.A.’s Mexican Cultural Institute and I thank Ruben Guevara and Bill Estrada for the invitation. Portions of Chapter 2 have appeared as “The Yiddish Are Coming!: Antic-Semitism and the Aurality of Jewish Difference” (American Jewish History, December 1999) and as “Ladies and Gentleman, Mickey Katz . . . : An Introduction” (Papa, Play For Me: The Autobiography of Mickey Katz, 2002). Chapter 3 was published in James Baldwin Now (1999). Portions of Chapter 6 have appeared as “Rock’s Reconquista” (Rock Over The Edge: Transformations in Popular Music Culture, 2002) and as “Against Easy Listening: Transnational Soundings and Audiotopic Listenings” (Everynight Life: Culture and Dance in Latin/o America, 1997). I deeply thank Joyce Antler, Suzanna Tamminen, Dwight McBride, Roger Beebe, José Muñoz, and Celeste Fraser Delgado for making these publications possible.

At the University of California Press, Monica McCormick was a model of patience and editorial diligence. She took an early interest in this project and stuck with me longer than I would have, putting up with missed deadlines, vanishing acts, and writing blocks. I also greatly thank the American Crossroads Series editors—especially George Sanchez and George Lipsitz—for their comments and suggestions. Special thanks are due to George Sanchez for his continual support of my work and his generosity in opening the Boyle Heights family up to a Westsider. UCR’s Jasmine Payne came through just in time as the book’s clearance angel, dealing with all the pleasantries of final manuscript preparation and putting up with a scatterbrain on summer break, and I thank her enormously. The truest blessings of all, of course, are friends. David Measer, Julie Frankel, Michele Asselin, Randy Wright, Trisha Donnelly, Chelina Vargas, Jennifer Kuroki, Alex Vazquez, Ben Brand, Jay Mandel, Gregor Schurmann, Chris Barone. You all kept believing in me enough to get this thing finished, even when I didn’t deserve it. I seriously don’t know what I would be without you all (besides crazier). Danielle Renfrew was inside this book from its very beginnings, and her partnership in its formative years always kept it planted firmly in the ground of everyday life. Cecilia Bastida has believed in me and in these pages like no one else I’ve ever known, and I thank her for all of her kindness and unconditional love from deep in my heart. There is no way I would have finished it without her, and there is no one I am more excited to share it with. The family comes last because they’re first. My grandparents, parents, and sister—all of them incredible, all of them friends, all of them inspirations in their own way. They are the ones who gave me the music to begin with, so it’s only fair that I try to give it back to them with as much love and respect as I can. Lastly, to Twentynine Palms, for rescuing me, for finishing it. acknowledgments\n\nxv\n\ni n t ro d u c t i o n\n\nStrangers among Sounds\n\nit all started with a record store and the Rock Island Line. When I was growing up in West Los Angeles, my parents gave me a weekly allowance for doing things I should have been doing anyway: cleaning my room, washing the dishes, taking out the garbage. I was supposed to spend the money on weekend food, movies, and arcade games, but I never did. Instead, I would get on my silver BMX street bike, ride down streets that I knew I would see later that night in episodes of CHiPs, Starsky and Hutch, and Charlie’s Angels (we lived blocks from the original 20th Century Fox studios backlot), and raid the bins at a used record store that kept its vinyl in musty standing crates too close to the street windows, its cassettes stacked in locked Plexiglas display cases. The store was my refuge, and I knew its stock from front to back. I knew when a promotional copy of a new album dropped off by a local record exec or music journalist had come in, and I knew when someone had finally bought one of the three weathered copies of Nugent Live or the still-sealed pressing of Al Green’s Greatest Hits. It’s where I heard Tracy Chapman a month before her first record came out, where I could find the new Love and Rockets 12-inch, where I bought my J. Geils Band, Musical Youth, and Kool and the Gang tapes, and because you could listen to anything on the in-store turntable and cassette deck and because I was the store owner’s most regular prepubescent customer, it was where I could listen to anything 1\n\nI wanted for as long as I wanted. It was where musical knowledge was just waiting to reveal itself, a living archive of sound, a four-hundred-squarefoot library that was made entirely, infinitely, of music. It was the first place I heard jazz and blues, the first place I heard punk and salsa, the first place I heard Jimmie Rodgers and Laurie Anderson and The Clash. There was no artist I couldn’t try out, no genre I couldn’t sample, no era that was offlimits. As early as fifth grade, music had become my entryway into a boundless social world of difference and possibility, and the best part was that there was no end to it. There was always more to hear, more to dislike, more to admire and covet. It’s what, to this day, makes me anxious if I go for too long without a visit to the record store—only two ears, only so many hours in the day, so much more that I could be listening to. My attachments to the music were so strong precisely because I felt—unquestionably, unflinchingly—that the music was mine, “loud yet so confidential,” as the poet Billy Collins has written1. Building my record collection was my way of building my own world, creating an alternate set of cultural spaces that, through the private act of listening, could deliver me to different places and different times and allow me to try out different versions of my self. My parents soon caught on, and they began restricting the amount of money I could spend on albums and tapes. I still kept up my habit, but now instead of throwing my purchases into a conspicuous backpack, I transported them as illicit contraband. Albums were slid down the back of my pants, cassettes stuffed into my pockets or wrapped into a folded-up sweatshirt. Once safely in my room, I couldn’t put them on fast enough—my fix doing its job, feeding me, taking me away, taking me closer and closer to who I wanted to be in the privacy of a child’s bedroom with a red rug, a ceiling light masquerading as a glass basketball swished through a metal rim, and a cabinet full of stereo components. Later in this introduction, I’ll try to convince you that songs can be understood as audiotopias. It’s a fancy word that I didn’t have access to as a kid, but the concept—that music functions like a possible utopia for the listener, that music is experienced not only as sound that goes into our ears and vibrates through our bones but as a space that we can enter into, encounter, move around in, inhabit, be safe in, learn from—was one I knew intimately. I lived inside the music I bought and to which I listened. The Oxford English Dictionary says that what defines a utopia is that it has “no known location,” that it exists nowhere.2 Which is precisely why music and songs are different. They are almost-places of cultural encounter that may not be physical places but nevertheless exist in their own auditory some2\n\nintroduction\n\nwhere. The places music offers may not be material or tangible, but I know where I want to go when I want to get there. I can put on a song and live it, hear it, get inside its notes and chords, get inside its narratives and follow its journeys and paths. Dropping the needle or pressing the play button was the equivalent of walking into a building, entering into an architecture of sound, a space that can be seen and experienced only if it is heard. When I listened I could see and hear what parts went into the building of that space—a melody from an African American spiritual, a guitar solo cribbed from Zeppelin, a rhythm from the Caribbean. Listening to a song’s whole was always listening to its parts, to the crossings and exchanges and collaborations that went into its making. Music can offer maps in this way, and when I was younger the maps I heard were not just the maps of the song’s cultural and historical genesis, but the map of my own life, a musical “You Are Here” that positioned me within the larger social world. “Add music, and you can instantly transport yourself, through inner-experience, into a different world,” the African American poet Jean Toomer wrote back in 1937. “Music, however, though able to transport you into a different world, cannot keep you in that different world. . . . Once it is over for the time being, you slide back into this world.”3 Toomer was right, up until that last part. We always slide back into this world, but, each time, we slide back in forever changed. The folksinger Pete Seeger probably would have said that my run-in with music’s social mapping skills was just another example of what he once dubbed “the world that music lives in.”4 That was, indeed, what music gave me, access to the worlds it lived in. A song is never just a song, but a connection, a ticket, a pass, an invitation, a node in a complex network. But I was also aware of the other side of it, the worlds that live in music, the worlds that music—or, fast-forwarding again, the audiotopias of music— contains. Beginning in 1948, Seeger played with The Weavers, a button-down folk quartet with radical race and labor politics who first made it big singing the songs of black folk-blues singer Leadbelly, translating their accounts of black life into musical languages accessible to socially conscious, protestoriented whites. My father was one of them (he owned all The Weavers albums, none of Leadbelly’s), and I was taught that The Weavers were as good as it gets, four lefty white folksingers belting Israeli folk songs, picket-line odes, and prison blues in harmonies that inspired people my parents’ age to sing along in unison. Once I got over the sing-along tendency (sure, it happened at Thompson Twins concerts, but it’s different when you’re wearstrangers among sounds\n\n3\n\ning fluorescent socks and acid-washed Guess jeans), I heard the true importance of the group: their People’s Movement approach to music was not only a way of understanding how culture can work, but a way of resisting the way culture can work. With The Weavers, it was impossible not to hear music as a tool of social change and a vehicle for community-building across proscribed social lines. So there I was, the son of a Bronx-born, Jewish, L.A. doctor being raised on a steady diet of protest songs and sea shanties performed by the gospelloving union activist son of a Southern Methodist preacher (Lee Hayes), the Paul Robeson–idolizing daughter of a Brooklyn Jewish mother active in the Ladies Garment Workers Union (Ronnie Gilbert), a guitar-plucking Coast Guard vet whose father was a ragman (Fred Hellerman), and Seeger, the Manhattan-born son of a violin-teaching mother and a radical folk-songcollecting musicologist father who got at least some of his inspiration from the family’s black housekeeper, folksinger Elizabeth “Libba” Cotton. I’d listen to Duran Duran with my friends, but at home I’d sing along to the tongue-twisting rhymes of “The Rock Island Line” (especially because its rollercoaster lyrics were more challenging to get right than Duran Duran’s “Rio”).5 Before I began my private elementary school that would get me into my private high school (with the sons of Hollywood elite and home-in-Aspen, home-in-Maui venture capitalists), this was the music I was exposed to. It came from singers who took their name from a German play about rebellious medieval weavers, who mediated between African American life and white folk fans, who, while selling over four million records between 1950 and 1951 on Decca, were advocating antiwar politics and racial justice. Unbeknownst to me then, I was fed the post–World War II era’s most popular recorded voices of dissent. The Weavers were a fourpart harmonic response to the social anxieties, race tensions, and frenetic leftist political suppressions that followed the end of the war, as black servicemen returned to a racially segregated domestic life with a new sense of entitlement and justice, and as paranoiac anti-communist patriotism fueled Red Scare witch hunts. The suspect politics of The Weavers’ music attracted the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and they were soon dropped from Decca and made taboo to booking agents and record store shelf-stockers. When I was a teenager, my father took me to see Pete Seeger play at a local high school auditorium. It was a benefit for the legendary Sunset Hall, a feisty retirement home for aging leftist activists. It was one of my first concerts, and I watched a skinny white man with a gray beard sing the civil 4\n\nintroduction\n\nrights anthem he helped popularize, “We Shall Overcome.” Seeger was a late addition to the song’s evolution from its beginnings as “I’ll Overcome Some Day,” a black spiritual written by a black reverend, Charles Tindley, and first published in 1901. In the early 1940s, Tindley’s version was reinvented by the black Tobacco Workers Union—who sang it as part of their Southern labor struggles—as “We Will Overcome.” Seeger was active at a labor and civil rights movement headquarters, the Highlander Folk Center, when in 1947 the “will” became “shall” and the song became synonymous with social transformation and political struggle.6 I wish I could make it easy and say that all this was actually my parents’ scene, that they were hard-core activists, that they actually hung out with black people, that they were ex-union leaders from the Lower East Side who became socialists and who cast write-in votes for Jesse Jackson each election until they went Green Party. But they weren’t. In fact, save for my father’s brief high school stint as a member of a communist youth league, I’ve never seen either of them be overtly political or socially dissenting (my mother is too generous and sensitive not to be a Democrat and my father can’t help being defensive when he admits to becoming a “social liberal, but a fiscal conservative”). But they did play me The Weavers, folk music that by then everyone knew was dangerous, and gave me the gift of understanding that, indeed, worlds do live in music and music does live in the world, even when those worlds aren’t necessarily yours. Having The Weavers as a musical blueprint meant that from the beginning I got the message—however subconsciously—that music was about cultural exchange, internationalist interpretation, and radical politics. The Weavers were white, English-speaking, highly educated Americans, and yet some of their songs were in Spanish and Hebrew, some of their songs were written by Latin American revolutionaries, South African poets, and African American laborers. They identified as “American folksingers” and yet their America was different from McCarthy’s, different from Jim Crow’s, and different from suburbia’s. Their America was a provisional, ideal America where racial difference did not mean racial persecution, where rights and social welfare were not selective, where, as their partnerin-folk-crime Woody Guthrie would sing, the land belonged to everyone, from the Native Americans it was taken from to the poor black, white, and Mexican farmers who now worked its fields. But their America was also not exceptionalist or isolationist. Their America was part of a series of international flows, where melodies from one country woke up as different melodies in another. Even when The Weavers recorded an album to sing the strangers among sounds\n\n5\n\npraises of the American folk song, their nationalism couldn’t help but be internationalist: they named it Folk Songs of America and Other Lands. One of the results of this commitment to coupling “America” with “Other Lands” was that years before I would read the revolutionary Cuban poetics of Jose Marti’s Versos sencillos on my own, I would know how they went because of Seeger’s version of “Guantanamera,” a song originally composed by Cuban pianist and composer Julian Orbosón and based on a popular 1920 Cuban melody. Orbosón’s choice of melody makes the transnational America–Latin America connection even more dense: a song that originally poked fun at Cuban women who fraternized with American soldiers stationed at Guantanamo. Seeger would urge that people sing “Guantanamera”—an exile’s ode to an island homeland littered with lynched black Cubans and palm trees—in its original Spanish to “hasten the day [that] the USA . . . is some sort of bilingual country.”7 As a child, I remember hearing Seeger’s 1965 ode to heterogeneity, “All Mixed Up”—where he sings “No race of man is completely pure . . . The winds mix the dust of every land and so will man”—and realizing that it was the first time I had ever heard a musician talk explicitly about the politics of American race and, more to the point, about the impossibilities of racial purity. Seeger’s America was a “mixed up” country, a land where hybridity is the cultural norm (and multilingualism ought to be), no matter what illusions racial purists attempt to pass off as fact. “One of America’s claims to fame has been the ability to form hybrids,” he wrote, “the ability to exploit the ideas given us by others.” Seeger should know. His career was fueled by his knack for hybridizing traditions not his own, for “exploiting” ideas that belonged to others in order to create something of his own. “Wimoweh.” “Guantanamera.” “We Shall Overcome.” “Roll Down the Wind.” Hybrids and exploitations all. Even though I never heard him say so, I can’t help but think that my father started taking banjo lessons because of how much he liked what Seeger could pull off on his long-necked five-string. Though it has long been associated with white American folk and bluegrass music, Seeger never hid the banjo’s roots in Africa. It is an instrument that has become synonymous with American vernacular music precisely because it was unwittingly imported here along with boats full of displaced Africans who woke up as enslaved property for sale on the auction blocks of New Canaan. And, for Seeger, there was nothing indigenous about the banjo’s music, either. A search for American roots only led him outside of America, outside of the West. “The American folk style of playing seems to me to be basically non6\n\nintroduction\n\nEuropean,” he wrote in the early 1950s. “As more Americans take hold again of their traditions of folk music, many also become acquainted with different kinds of songs from various corners of the world.”8 This is the America I grew up hearing about, Seeger’s America, a land of the free founded on slavery and disenfranchisement and inequality, a country of slaves, exiles, refugees, and immigrants, a motley conglomerate he described on the pages of the Daily World in 1968 as “uprooted people.”9 My father’s parents—modern Orthodox Jews—came to the South Bronx in the early 1940s from Paris. They had been running a small Hungarian restaurant in Montmarte ever since they left Hungary, on the run from Hitler’s march across Europe. Maybe my father heard some of that in Seeger, too—music of his uprooted parents, melodies of the legacy he had been handed, songs that were his own private worlds, his own spaces, his own sing-along audiotopias, where he could figure out, just like I would decades later, how to be himself. “Congratulations, you are all now American citizens,” the U.S. judge performing the naturalization ceremony proclaims. At the close of the service, that most fundamental public ritual of obligatory American civic and political belonging that converts the illegal into the legal, the undocumented into the documented, the national stranger into the national citizen, something unexpected happens, something that Seeger probably could have predicted would have happened. A song begins. The song, “Mis dos patrias,” comes from Los Tigres del Norte, the living legends of modern-day norteño music who themselves came to California as “uprooted people,” undocumented immigrants, back in 1968, from the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Their song asks us to imagine that on that day, Los Tigres themselves are in that courtroom, just another group of mexicanos being inducted into the legal rituals of American nationalism. The song begins when their citizenship begins; the music is their first act of public expression as new U.S. citizens. That Los Tigres would make such public spectacle of their new citizenship might at first seem surprising. For the past three decades, the band members have proudly asserted themselves as unassimilated Spanishspeaking indocumentados, living a Mexican reality that is in, but not of, America. On their album covers, the self-proclaimed “autenticos idolos del pueblo,” have mostly presented themselves in two different guises: downhome, cowboy-hat and leather-vest-wearing immigrant farm workers reststrangers among sounds\n\n7\n\ning on top of horses, combines, and broken-down wagons, or slick urban vaqueros stepping out in matching tiger-striped and tasseled suits. Without any help from any of the “big five” U.S.-based multinational record companies, Los Tigres have averaged at least an album a year (half of which have gone gold in the United States) on Fonovisa (the profitable recording arm of Mexican television conglomerate Televisa); starred in twenty films produced and distributed in Mexico, most of them based on the plots of their most successful songs; and won a 1988 Grammy for their Gracias America . . . sin fronteras, a norteño first.10 That album’s lead song, “America,” is a direct attack on assertions of U.S. chauvinism and imperialist national identity claims that conflate, and subsequently erase, the entire American continent in the name of the “America” that is the United States. “I am from America,” Los Tigres state with pride, but their America is the America of the Americas. “In the North they call me Latino,” they continue, “they don’t want to call me American.” Los Tigres call themselves American—American in the spirit not of Jefferson or Washington, but of the Puerto Rican jibaro, the Cuban guajiro, and the Mexican charro. The song begins by quoting the bass line from Richie Valens’s “La Bamba,” a song raised in a Pacoima garage in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley, but originally born decades before across the border in Veracruz as a traditional son jarocho.11 For Latino audiences within the United States, the songs of Los Tigres are perhaps best known for their commitment to giving voice to the struggles of undocumented Mexican immigrants. When the band performs live, fans pile scraps of paper bearing song requests and dedications to family and loved ones back in Mexico on the edge of the stage. During their intermissions, band members take time to pose for family pictures and sign autographs. The identification between Los Tigres’ fans in the United States and the stories of hard-working, Mexico-proud immigrants that their songs tell runs deep. Partly, it’s because the protagonists of Los Tigres’ songs are not agringado. They come to “los United” to work, to earn a living, to forge what they imagine will be a better life. As they put it in one song, California is not the golden land of guaranteed opportunity—the California that, for all of my Weavers and Pete Seeger listenings, I never questioned between trips to the beach and house parties in Bel Air mansions. It is rather a jaula de oro, a cage of gold—a dangerous, often vicious trap that disguises crippling lies as bountiful promises.12 To borrow a formulation from George Lipsitz, the California of Los Tigres del Norte is more “historical California”—the lived experience of California as a mediation zone between con8\n\nintroduction\n\nflict and coalition—than “rhetorical California,” the California of media boosterism and Hollywood fantasy that promotes fictions of plenitude by ignoring realities of destruction and struggle.13 Los Tigres, who have repeatedly supported the idea of an America “without borders,” recorded “Jaula de oro” just one year before the 1986 approval of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, a “take back the border” initiative that increased U.S.–Mexico border policing, doubling the number of active Border Patrol agents and dedicating new funds to promote border clampdowns. It should come as no surprise, then, that there was more to the presence of Los Tigres in a U.S. naturalization ceremony than newfound patriotism. Los Tigres recorded their citizenship song “Mis dos patrias” as a response to the 1994 passage of Proposition 187, the California measure that denied basic health and education benefits to undocumented immigrants.14 The protagonist in the song becomes a citizen not to publicly pledge allegiance to the dream of American possibility but to protect his undocumented children from a law that directly puts their lives at risk and renders their humanity insignificant and inconsequential (“187,” as Snoop Dogg and countless other L.A. hip-hop MCs like to remind us, is also police code for murder). Thus, unlike past Yankee Doodle, My-Country-’Tis-of-Thee popular music tributes to the glories of American citizenship I grew up hearing (think Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America” or Neil Diamond’s “America”), “Mis dos patrias” engages citizenship as a survival tactic against xenophobic terror, in which Mexicans pledge allegiance to their adopted country for fear of being killed by it. The singer insists that his new status as a U.S. citizen does not signal his assimilation into American culture or a betrayal of his Mexican identity. He reminds us that he “arrived crying in the land of the Anglo-Saxon” and has since worked hard to take care of his family in a state that has now begun to strip away his rights. Even with his new citizenship, he is still as Mexican as “el pulque y el nopal.” “Don’t call me a traitor,” he urges. “I love both my countries. In mine, I left my dead. Here, my children were born. Defending their rights, I can’t be a traitor.” In “Mis dos patrias” Los Tigres refuse the assumed singularities and national unities of normative U.S. citizenship, insisting that Mexico and the United States might be “two countries,” but now they live “in the same heart.”15 By staging “Mis dos patrias” as the conclusion to a naturalization ceremony, Los Tigres refuse to accept the scripts of U.S. citizenship being handed them, scripts that urge singular national allegiance, singular national pride, and singular public participation in American national culstrangers among sounds\n\n9\n\nture. Instead, Los Tigres approach their new citizenship as an open space of negotiation and they write their own musical script—one that flies two flags, with pulque and nopal for all—in which they imagine themselves as actors and agents who, as far from the reality of California political life as it might be, might actually have control of the future their new citizenship sets up. This approach to citizenship, particularly one rooted in migratory communities directly involved with the transnational movements of capital and labor, has in recent years received many different names that add levels of complexity to Seeger’s “uprooted people” model. Among them are Aiwha Ong’s “flexible citizenship” and May Joseph’s “nomadic citizenship,” both of which leave room for voicings of patriotisms not grounded in any one specific, bounded geopolitical territory but instead dispersed across unpredictable cartographies. Both of these emergent models of citizenship get performed across and within national boundaries, rather than obeying the rules and demands of strictly mapped national formations.16 In Joseph’s formulation, the alternative or counter-citizenship that Los Tigres suggest is one that is both a condition imposed by the institutions and ideologies of the state and a strategy of negotiation with these very forces. Los Tigres treat citizenship as something they can use and shape, rather than a preordained set of demands that are put upon them. “Citizenship is a status whose definitions are always in process,” Lauren Berlant has written. “It is continually being produced out of a political, rhetorical, and economic struggle over who will count as ‘the people’ and how social membership will be measured and valued.”17 On that day in that California courtroom, Los Tigres told us exactly who counts as “the people,” and why and on what terms, and they did it in a way that, as we will see in the pages of this book, has been one of the primary means for articulating a public response to the racial and ethnic designations of nationalist U.S. political culture throughout the twentieth century: they did it with a song. Put simply, Los Tigres know how nations work. Like Seeger, they know that it is the job of the nation to actively assimilate “foreign” elements into the cultural order of a juridically bounded state territory. It’s an argument Zygmunt Bauman has made well: citizenship, both legal and cultural, is the key point of conversion to the national religion, when outsiders become insiders, others become natives, all through the promotion and enforcement of a common culture. Citizenship and cultural conformity start to sound more and more like synonyms, two concepts which, in the context of the\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\nnation, exist in a codependent relationship which no intellectual therapy can undo. Cultural conformity in the public sphere is both the condition of citizenship and the means of preserving it; in the eyes of the state, our cultural lives can be seen as our political lives. The means for the achievement of this conformity, this conversion, in Bauman’s terms, into the church of the national state which requires submission of the flock, is assimilation—the process of making the unlike “like,” of dissolving difference into a constructed commonality of experience, history, and beliefs, of making family out of strangers, giving the uprooted the same set of new roots.18 So with “Mis dos patrias,” not unlike the black spiritual that begot the union song that begot “We Shall Overcome,” Los Tigres embrace political citizenship while trying to avert cultural conformity. They submit to political citizenship to a U.S. nation imagined in relation to a bounded territory and yet continue to identify as free national agents whose identities and lives move in and out of this territory, but whose cultural production works necessarily sin fronteras, without borders, and is dedicated to Latino audiences like themselves who approach their citizenship with caution and ambivalence. And as Bauman reminds us, ambivalence is powerful because it is an “undecideable,” both inside and outside, both yes and no, the threatening, evasive monkey wrench in the grinding gears of assimilation.19 I didn’t hear Los Tigres’ “Mis dos patrias” until I had finished writing the bulk of this book, but in many ways it encapsulates the reasons why I wanted to write it in the first place. And those reasons are rather simple. First, though you would hardly know it by the way it gets covered in the press and in the mainstream media, popular music is one of our most valuable tools for understanding the impact of nationalism and citizenship on the formation of our individual identities. And second, it is also one of our most valuable sites for witnessing the performance of racial and ethnic difference against the grain of national citizenships that work to silence and erase those differences. As I heard in the music of The Weavers—a group, we should remember, that was branded as “un-American” in the blacklist 1950s—the histories of popular music in the United States cut straight to the heart of how “American” identities get made, making audible the extent to which the negotiation with citizenship always involves, at some level, a negotiation with strangeness from a pre-fab national norm. “Mis dos patrias” is a way for Los Tigres to articulate both their dual citizenship and their dual strangeness:\n\nstrangers among sounds\n\n11\n\nstrangers to a U.S. nationalism threatened by their presence and strangers to a Mexican cultural nationalism threatened by their departure (a departure all too often figured as betrayal). Strangeness is identity’s uncomfortable, but required, double. To be a stranger to others or to oneself is to unsettle identities already in use, to force identity to look itself in the mirror, take stock, and really understand what it sees in the new light cast from the shadow of the stranger at the door. In his 1975 memoir The Devil Finds Work, James Baldwin wrote about the experience of watching movies as an experience of identity formation and identity confrontation, an experience in which the movie watcher watches the stranger and is forced to watch him or herself. The question of identity is a question involving the most profound panic—a terror as primary as the nightmare of the mortal fall. This question can scarcely be said to exist among the wretched, who know, merely, that they are wretched and who bear it day by day—it is a mistake to suppose that the wretched do not know that they are wretched; nor does this question exist among the splendid, who know, merely, that they are splendid, and who flaunt it, day by day: it is a mistake to suppose that the splendid have any intention of surrendering their splendor. An identity is questioned only when it is menaced, as when the mighty begin to fall, or when the wretched begin to rise, or when the stranger enters the gates, never, thereafter, to be a stranger: the stranger’s presence making you the stranger, less the stranger than to yourself.20\n\nBaldwin watched movies in the dark of a theater. I listened to records in my bedroom, each tape and album I smuggled home its own world full of strangers. My obsessive, private listenings were, and continue to be, ways of approaching a self through the lives of strangers who I meet through sound. After all, every time we listen to a song, a stranger enters the gates, an identity is menaced, an identity is questioned. Even if we have heard the song before, even if the song is our favorite song, one to which we sing along, lip-sync, or air-guitar, each listening contains the newness of a new context—a different room, a different mood, a different volume, a different time of day. The world we encounter at the level of sound and acoustic experience is a new world of social experience and emotional possibility, but it is also, necessarily, a strange world that we negotiate through listening. I have always been drawn to popular music for precisely this power: its innate ability to refuse to stand still, to frustrate fixity, to confuse authority and baffle totality, to never be the same thing. 12\n\nintroduction\n\nHow could you not talk of identity when talking abut music? When you hear it, music makes you immediately conscious of your identity precisely because something outside of you is entering your body—alien sounds emitted from strangers you sometimes cannot see that enter, via vibration and frequency, the very bones and tissues of your being. All musical listening is a form of confrontation, of encounter, of the meeting of worlds and meanings, when identity is made self-aware and is, therefore, menaced through its own interrogation. In a synagogue in San Francisco, I felt like Kaf ka’s dog. Often a stranger to my own Jewishness, and usually a stranger to the tenets and practice of Judaism, I was, nonetheless, a graduate student sitting in synagogue during the High Holy Days with a yarmulke on my head and an open prayer book in my hands. I tell people that I mainly go to these services because I love their music, because nothing turns me inward like the deep, melancholic moan of the cantor, his voice flooding through a language I do not understand to conjure faraway faces and emotions: refrigerated leftover milk and hot cabbage on chipped dime-store porcelain plates, my grandfather’s crisp, double-breasted wool suits and Orbach’s ascots, my grandmother’s baroque costume jewelry that overflowed out of vanity drawers in a bedroom that she rarely left. My favorite has always been “Hine ma tov,” an overwhelming ache of a song based on Psalm 133:1 and composed around a traditional Sufi motif. I only recently learned what its words meant: “How good it is / and how pleasant / when brothers and sisters dwell together / in harmony.” Such a hopeful sentiment housed in such dark, crying beauty; such a blissful utopia clothed in such a mournful Old Testament blues. It is the only religious song for which I close my eyes. It is instinctual and automatic: my lids shut, my head tilts down toward my feet, and my body rocks back and forth, back and forth, in an uncontrollable daven from an unreliable worshiper, a stranger outside the Torah’s gates. That night the shofar was blown and, as usual, I marveled at the triumph and violence of its sound—a blast of human air sprayed through the horn of a dead ram. When you hear the blowing of the shofar, there is no way to feel at ease with it. It is always an affront, always uncomfortable, always aggressive in its volume and its frequency, in the sheer force of its howling, breathy noise. I had felt that way about it since I was a child, but that night the rabbi gave it a name. Quoting Torah, he called it “a stranger among sounds.” The shofar is certainly a stranger among sounds, but it also makes strangers among sounds\n\n13\n\nstrangers out of all who hear it. We are strangers among its sounds, its blasts of bleating air confronting all of us in that room equally, forcing all of us to confront our identities as listeners. But while I was supposed to be taking in the rabbi’s words and applying them to my own stake in that Jewish New Year, my mind was elsewhere. I was thinking of The Weavers, of Seeger, of Los Tigres del Norte, of California and America, of citizens and aliens. This idea of being a stranger among sounds immediately seemed a fitting way to understand how identity and listening work and, especially in the context of “American” music and “American” culture, a fitting way to approach the study of music’s relationship to the production of listening subjects, citizens of pop music’s myriad republics of sound. Popular music has always been my refuge because it is the refuge of strangers; because in the world of popular music, we are all strangers among sounds made by others. The job of the listener, or at least one of them, is to register our experience of ourselves by confronting ourselves as strangers in the sounds that we make our own. In the United States, popular music has always offered accessible, everyday cultural spaces where strangeness and familiarity are actively negotiated, where difference and community are actively experienced and imagined, and where opposition and consensus actively butt heads. It hit me hard that night: music is a mode of relation, a point of contact. All of the people who I discuss in this book—all of the people who make and listen to this music of contact—are all strangers who listen and listeners who are strange. They are national strangers because they use music to make strangers of themselves, to hear themselves as different from the music all around them, and to audibly figure out their relationship to a national order they have little control over. They all embody the conflict that was apparent that very night in the San Francisco synagogue: the song’s call for harmony, the shofar’s call for dissonance; the song’s call for unity, the shofar’s insistence on difference. I was reminded of something I read in high school that I barely understood: Franz Kaf ka’s parable, “Investigations of a Dog.” It’s about a dog who has left “the canine community” but is still a dog, and who comes upon a group of other dogs. He visually recognizes them as dogs, but when they make music, the sounds they utter—which sound familiar, which he should recognize—are instead so inscrutably strange that he is sent into a dog identity crisis. “From the empty air they conjured music,” the dog reports, and “everything was music. . . . I was profoundly confused by the sounds that accompanied them, yet they were dogs nevertheless, dogs like 14\n\nintroduction\n\nyou and me.” His confusion leads to a rejection of the dogs, his refusal and inability join in with their concert, “this blast of music which seemed to come from all sides, from the heights, from the deeps, from everywhere, surrounding the listener, overwhelming him, crushing him.”21 In his introduction to one of the first books I ever read in order to get acquainted with the field of American Studies, The Rites of Assent: Transformations in the Symbolic Constructions of America, Sacvan Bercovitch calls “Investigations of a Dog” a “model of cross-cultural criticism.” When the dog’s recognition of strange sounds turns him back inward to examine his own strangeness in a larger world of sound, he does not call for an erasure of that strangeness or the silencing of the differences he hears. Instead, the dog understands his listening as a way of confronting and living with difference and strangeness, his aim “not to harmonize ‘apparent’ differences (in the manner of pluralist consensus), but on the contrary to highlight conflicting appearances, so as to explore the substantive differences they imply.” Positioning himself as a Canadian scholar who is himself a stranger confronting the alien sounds of American nationalism, Bercovitch hears the rhetoric of American consensus and cultural univocality, rhetoric that for so long characterized the trajectory of American Studies in the U.S. academy as “the music of America.” Yet, Kaf ka’s dog offers a way out. Kaf ka’s dog hears “the music of America,” the music that is supposed to collect him into its concert of dog oneness, and cannot recognize it. He understands his difference from it, his strangeness in its acoustic midst, and instead of discarding or ignoring that difference, he lives with it and uses it as the lens through which he interprets and describes the larger social world.22 The “music of America” that Bercovitch hears—the ideology of American nationalism and consensus that The Weavers and Los Tigres del Norte had acknowledged and disputed for so long—and the way Kaf ka’s dog refuses to recognize it and attempts to find new ways of listening to a different music of America where strangers make sounds that are not incorporated into harmonious concert, is precisely the terrain in which this book is interested. Kaf ka’s dog never appears again in this book, but he shadows every chapter. He is one of my models of investigative, critical listening, a dog who is suspicious of harmony and concert precisely because of how threatening harmony and concert can be to the sustenance of difference. He is suspicious that the harmonies of dog music will define him, a dog who has left the dog fold, merely as a dog. He is suspicious that dog harmony will “overwhelm” his difference as a dog. strangers among sounds\n\n15\n\nThe dog even wonders aloud why he is so compelled to not be satisfied with the harmony and sameness he is supposed to sing along with. “Why do I not do as others,” he asks himself, “live in harmony with my people and accept in silence whatever disturbs the harmony, ignoring it as a small error in the great account, always keeping in mind the things that bind us happily together, not those that drive us again and again, as though by sheer force, out of our social circle?”23 Kafka’s dog performs the same kind of critical listening that Los Tigres do, the same kind of critical listening that all of the subjects of this book do—a critical listening that does not necessarily reject consensus or harmony, but questions its default functionality as an apparatus of obligatory group belonging and nationalist solidarity. All of them hear “the music of America” and, instead of joining in, launch an investigation of just who and what is allowed into its chorus. I’m showing my cards early. As you’ll soon see, one of the goals of this book is to include popular music in recent debates around the futures of American Studies, multiculturalism, and diversity that have been so extensively carried out by scholars and critics as ideologically varied as Cornel West, David Noble, George Sanchez, Arthur Schlesinger, David PalumboLiu, Lisa Lowe, and David Hollinger, among many others.24 In a 1991 essay in College English, for example, Gregory Jay went so far as to call for an end to “American Literature,” because of the erasures that the use of “American” demands and repeatedly performs. “As long as we use ‘American’ as an adjective,” he wrote, “we reinforce the illusion that there is a transcendental core of values and experiences that are essentially ‘American’ and that literary or cultural studies may be properly shaped by selecting objects and authors according to how well they express this essence.” The multicultural reality of the United States must instead replace the fantasy of a universalist America where all differences are subsumed under the cloak of an imagined common cultural core. For Jay, “a multicultural pedagogy initiates a cultural re-vision . . . the de-centering of cultural chauvinism.”25 Popular music participates in this, but not as a supplementary accomplice or a sideline example. My contention is that popular music in “America” is an archive of sound, performance, and culture that has cultural revisioning and de-centering as its organizing principles. As with literature, the point is not that new musical forms are being created by new musical communities and therefore must be “added” or “included” into the definition of “American,” but that music has always been re-visioning America according to a multicultural pedagogy no matter how hard advocates of American consensus have worked to keep it quiet. The music has always 16\n\nintroduction\n\nbeen there and it has always been all mixed up. Its clashes and exchanges and convergences and contests, its never-ending play of differences and particularities, have always been there. The problem is that not enough people have been listening. By trying to come to terms with Kaf ka’s dog as a minoritized listener defined by his difference, whose “investigations” de-center the chauvinism of the dogs he encounters, I am, in a sense, attempting to foreground popular music’s role in the development of what Chela Sandoval has called “differential consciousness,” an oppositional consciousness of self, citizenship, and nation that actively refutes and re-orders oppressive hierarchies of power and control.26 The performers and listeners I deal with in this book work through music’s differential power, making and listening to popular music in the face of oppressive state systems and ethno-racial hierarchies that seek to erase difference, in order to find new, more sustaining ways of living anew in a world hostile to your survival. Which loops me right back to audiotopias, to music’s utopian potential, its ability to show us how to move toward something better and transform the world we find ourselves in. Drawing on the ideas of Richard Dyer, Jill Dolan has written that if cultural performances like music are not “expressly political,” they are “usefully emotional.” The emotion and the sensibility that music offers is what leads to a change in who we are, who we want to be, and how we want the world to be. For Dyer and Dolan, music does not offer a model of a utopian world. “Rather the utopianism is contained in the feelings it embodies,” Dyer writes. “It presents what utopia would feel like rather than how it would be organized.”27 Music gives us the feelings we need to get where we want to go. I love popular music for its ambivalences and contradictions, how it can be the stuff of injury, but also the stuff of sustenance, joy, strength, identification, pleasure, defense, and liberation. My aim is not to romanticize popular music as a safe-house for revolution and resistance. Music can’t topple regimes, break chains, or stop bullets. But it can keep us alive. Music can always surprise us, be unpredictable, refuse to submit to what is put upon it. Music can always sound different from one listening moment to another, and mean radically different things to all who hear it. There is no one, single, all-encompassing way of listening, and that flexibility (and the infinite possibilities it opens up) is much of what drives this book.28 In this regard, I’m inspired by something the musicologist Philip Brett wrote in 1997 as part of a debate about the role of sexuality in classical music scholarship. Brett angrily refused to allow anyone—scholars, critics, other strangers among sounds\n\n17\n\nfans—to tell him how to listen, how to identify, how to make meaning that in many ways nourished him, kept him alive as a gay man. “My own tactics for dealing with any music with which I identify,” he wrote, “is to insist on the possibility of difference, to hear its separateness rather than its indebtedness to models, to emphasize the value of distinct critical hearings of it, and to try gently to disrupt any totalizing vision as being characteristic of a dominant ideology that has for much of my life contested my right to a valid sentient experience.”29 My hope is that this book investigates popular music for what it does best: its validation of our own sentient experience—the important, vital, and sustaining difference of it—against the grain of the models put upon us by forces beyond our control. Pete Seeger. Los Tigres del Norte. Kaf ka’s dog. The sound of the shofar. Music insists on the possibility of difference, even when that difference is a difference from ourselves, even when that difference is something we have not yet learned how to listen to. Chapter 1 begins with what is surely the single most influential and, at least in the popular imagination, enduring and familiar attempt to approach America as a nation of music, a nation that could be listened to, a nation defined by its songs, its singers, and the people who hear them: Walt Whitman’s 1860 poem “I Hear America Singing.” But when I started working on this book as a dissertation, Whitman was about the last person on my mind. I had been spending most of my free time writing about hip-hop, rock en español, jazz, and other forms of popular music that seemed not only to have little to do with Whitman’s grand ideas of democracy and poetic nationhood, but seemed to work in loud, noisy, pissed-off opposition to it. (What did Whitman have to do with L.A.’s NWA or Mexico City’s Maldita Vecindad?) I associated Whitman, and in many ways, as you’ll see, still do, with the kind of nativist and conservative nationalist rhetoric that has, throughout the past century, galvanized right-wing, Republican politics by giving them a safe, bearded, sun-tanned—kinder, gentler—face to hide behind. For me, regardless of what the truth of Whitman’s poems ever revealed, Whitman was always a characteristic signifier of beaming, confident American nationalism who fell into the wrong hands, the poetic poster boy of a soul-stirring patriotic democracy that had for decades left little or no room for the communities and cultures to whose music I had dedicated my life. But the more I began exploring the relationship of popular music to formations of American national identity and to the performance of racial and 18\n\nintroduction\n\nethnic difference against the grain of imposed and policed monoculturalism, the more Whitman trailed me. He is the quintessential American listener, the American listener whose listenings helped shape the sound of what he heard. “I think I will do nothing for a long time but listen,” Whitman once wrote, “and accrue what I hear into myself . . . and let sounds contribute toward me.”30 Any notion of a nation rendered and revealed through its sounds—nation-formation as an acoustic act, a series of aural events—had some connection back to 1860, when Whitman wrote “I Hear America Singing.” Of course, other American writers before Whitman— in their search to establish a native, exceptionalist, New World American culture distinctly and proudly independent from the Old World of European tradition—had turned to listening, music, and song as ways of expressing national character. Most notably Emerson, who cast American cultural independence as a revolution of listening, writing in 1837, “We have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe.” But Whitman’s poem went the farthest. “I hear America singing,” he proclaimed, “the varied carols I hear.” Whitman turned the nation—the idea of it, the fantasy of it— into a collection of sounds and songs. America was songs, and to be an American was to hear those songs and to live within the ideological swirl of America’s proud music. The premise of this book revolves around the idea that “hearing America sing” should not mean hearing many voices folded into one across a national terrain with closed borders. That is, hearing America sing should not mean selectively listening for sounds and songs that replicate and reaffirm conservative ideologies of cultural consensus and racial univocality. Music in American life is the story of racial and ethnic difference; it is the story of both nation formation and de-formation, the audible soundtrack to a nation as it continually packs and unpacks itself. The song of America is not singular or pretty or triumphant, but endlessly hybrid, multiple, heterogeneous, and enriching—an always available site of psychological reward, nourishment, and survival for populations who have been taught over and over again that their lives do not matter. In a sense, this book grew out of my desire to take music back from the ideologues who misuse it and to listen to America sing against the Whitmanian grain in order to hopefully hear what has been for so long kept silent—the myriad differences that nationalist American listeners are willfully deaf to, the minoritized voices left out of the national chorus. An assumption that undergirds almost everything on these pages goes like this: there is no history of racial formation in the Americas that is not strangers among sounds\n\n19\n\na history of popular music, and there is no history of inter-American popular music without a history of racial formation.31 This book is a reminder of something that Stuart Hall has already set out, that we must never forget that popular music, like all forms of popular culture, is hybrid, synchronized, and the result of multiple convergences, compromises, overlaps, recodings, and appropriations. As such, popular music does not simply produce difference; difference is not merely an effect of the popular. It is difference. The task of the listening critic, then, is to track what Hall describes as “the mark of difference inside forms of popular culture.”32 In proposing an American listening that listens for the differences that constitute the musical landscape of America, I’m suggesting a listening that follows a post-nationalist model rather than a nationalist one. In using the term post-nationalist, I’m referring to recent work by a group of scholars concerned with finding ways of doing American Studies that do not replicate the mistakes of previous generations of scholars: reinstituting fictitious cultural unities; practicing an intellectual colonialism that claims the Americas as the United States; ignoring racial, ethnic, and sexual difference because it disrupts the national fantasy; enforcing whiteness as Americaness, obligatory monculturalism as political and cultural citizenship. Popular music is, by its nature, a post-nationalist formation. While it may take root in national formations, impact national audiences, and impact the creation of national ideas and politics, music is always from somewhere else and is always en route to somewhere else. It is always post- whatever context or circumstance defines it. It has always the potential to defy you, move beyond you, be something you never thought it could be. It is made of difference and speaks to difference. Music can be of a nation, but it is never exclusively national; it always overflows, spills out, sneaks through, reaches an ear on the other side of the border line, on the other side of the sea.33 In that sense, then, I’d like to think that moments of this book are in dialogue with one of the books that inspired it, Greil Marcus’s Mystery Train, a landmark study of popular music as a formative part of the American national landscape. Yet because Marcus’s approach to music criticism comes more out of the Perry Miller and “myth and symbol” schools of American Studies—both of which have ties to American exceptionalism—Mystery Train still hears through Whitman’s ears. The book ends with a nod to Whitman, with Marcus characterizing the musicians he’s discussed—from Robert Johnson to Elvis to The Beach Boys—as “good democrats.” For Marcus, Whitman is a suitable forefather for American music criticism because, as he puts it, “He was interested in an artist’s ability to determine the 20\n\nintroduction\n\nfeel of American experience; to become a part of the instinctive response of the people to events; to affect the quality and costs of daily life.”34 Marcus writes passionately about how his musicians make music within this classic American orbit of romantic democracy, but “America” is never questioned. Whose America? The fact that there are different Americas, that there are Americans who inhabit American-ness from different positions and with different relations (some more hostile, some more welcomed than others) undoubtedly disrupts the democratic rush of this new vision of a musical America. Amy Kaplan warns against the recycling of previous American Studies models that leave the fantasy of American consensus and univocality intact, as well as against models that reaffirm the national borders of the American idea. She writes, “American nationality can still be taken for granted as a monolithic and self-contained whole, no matter how diverse and conflicted, if it remains implicitly defined by its internal social relations, and not in political struggles for power with other cultures and nations, struggles which make America’s conceptual and geographic borders fluid, contested, and historically changing.”35 My answer to all this is to propose that when we talk about music in America, and music’s role in shaping American identities and American meanings, we should be thinking of music in terms of the differences it contains, the differences it makes audible, not the unities or harmonies it can be used to fabricate. We should be thinking of pieces of music—be they songs, samples, lyrics, chords, harmonies, rhythms—as “audiotopias,” small, momentary, lived utopias built, imagined, and sustained through sound, noise, and music. This, of course, requires another adjustment, to think of music in terms of space and in terms of its spaces—the spaces that the music itself contains, the spaces that music fills up, the spaces that music helps us to imagine as listeners occupying our own real and imaginary spaces. Music is, after all, a spatial practice, evoking, transcending, and organizing places along spatial trajectories.36 Because of music’s ability—both before and especially after the age of mechanical reproduction and the rise of economic globalization—to move between places and locations, understanding it according to the rules of space isn’t much of a novel proposal— after all, that was precisely what Whitman was doing with “I Hear America Singing,” using music to map a particular space based on the spaces it is thought to represent. But the key difference here is that thinking about music in terms of its potential for audiotopias does not involve space as a fixed, static, unchanged landscape. The spaces of music may produce strangers among sounds\n\n21\n\nmaps, but they are maps that move. “Space is composed of intersections of mobile elements,” Michel de Certeau has written. “It is in a sense actuated by the ensemble of movements deployed within it.”37 Understanding music spatially is one way of tracking music’s movements, witnessing and listening for its migrations and travels. It follows, then, that the traveling stories of music can also be considered, as de Certeau suggests, “delinquent,” in that they exhibit a “challenging mobility that does not respect places.”38 But music does not respect places precisely because it is capable of inhabiting them while moving across them— of arriving while leaving. Through music, space is constructed and de-constructed, shaped and shattered, filled up and hollowed out. Music creates spaces in which cultures get both contested and consolidated and both sounded and silenced—double acts of delinquency that question both the geopolitical boundaries of the modern nation-state and the disciplinary boundaries that govern its study in the academy. Such an emphasis on space disrupts the more exclusively temporal and historical epistemological biases that, as the urban theorist and geographer Edward Soja has gone to great lengths to demonstrate, have tended to characterize modern social theory. By embracing the idea of music as an audiotopia, we are embracing music’s role in what Soja calls “the lifeworld of being creatively located not only in the making of history but also in the construction of human geographies, the social production of space and the restless formation and reformation of geographical landscapes.”39 Yet, by calling for a renewed attention to music’s spatialization, to its cartographies and mappings, I not only want to draw direct links between music and the formulation and policing of national spaces—through audible borders and boundaries—but also to suggest that audiospatiality also involves the production of identities in sound.40 My teenage record store runs and bedroom listening sessions were themselves acts of musical identity-making, moments when my identity became a geography of crossed and crossing sounds, a mobile space of musical interaction. Lawrence Grossberg has argued that “a logic of spatiality” is one of the key factors in the articulation of identities, that “subjectivity describes the points of attachment from which one experiences the world”—leaving the very process of subjectformation and “individuation” as processes of spatialized belonging and identification.41 Throughout Audiotopia I suggest that this convergence of sound, space, and identity occurs through audiotopias, a concept that deserves further explanation. I began thinking about the possibility of an audiotopia—the 22\n\nintroduction\n\nspace within and produced by a musical element that offers the listener and/or the musician new maps for re-imagining the present social world— after reading about Michel Foucault’s notion of “heterotopias” in contrast to utopias, inherently unreal spaces that are “sites with no real place.” For Foucault, the heterotopia was the opposite of a utopia precisely because it was the possible utopia, “a kind of effectively enacted utopia” characterized by the juxtaposition “in a single real place of several spaces, several sites that are themselves incompatible.”42 His heterotopia prophesied Ruth Levitas’s revision of utopian thinking, wherein instead of looking for “maps of the future,” we look for “adequate maps of the present” that can lead to a more just world. To echo a similar revision by Rustom Bharucha, these maps point us to the possible, not the impossible; they lead us not to another world, but back to coping with this one.43 Because of music’s ability to do just this—to point us to the possible, to help us remap the world we live in now—and because of its uncanny ability to absorb and meld heterogeneous national, cultural, and historical styles and traditions across space and within place, the possibility of the audiotopia makes sense: sonic spaces of effective utopian longings where several sites normally deemed incompatible are brought together, not only in the space of a particular piece of music itself, but in the production of social space and the mapping of geographical space that music makes possible as well. Thus, reading and listening for audiotopias (through an analysis of both lyrics and music) has a dual function: to focus on the space of music itself and the different spaces and identities it juxtaposes within itself, and to focus on the social spaces, geographies, and identities that music can enable, reflect, and prophecy. In both cases, the audiotopia is a musical space of difference, where contradictions and conflicts do not cancel each other out but coexist and live through each other. Thus, in a sense, audiotopias can also be understood as identificatory “contact zones,” in that they are both sonic and social spaces where disparate identity-formations, cultures, and geographies historically kept and mapped separately are allowed to interact with each other as well as enter into relationships whose consequences for cultural identification are never predetermined.44 Thinking of music as an enacted, lived utopia that struggles against the constraints of racialization and nation-building in order to configure an alternate world of survival is not, of course, a new proposition. Most saliently, it has been a central feature of African American music and writing devoted to African American music, where everything from field hollers to the beats and breaks of hip-hop has historically functioned as a tool of survival and strangers among sounds\n\n23\n\nsustenance and a site of emancipatory hope. As Paul Allen Anderson has recently reminded us, as early as the turn of the twentieth century W. E. B. DuBois, in The Souls of Black Folk, wrote of the “sorrow songs” of slaves as holding a utopian possibility that could transfer into the realm of social change. “Through all the sorrow songs there breathes a hope—a faith in the ultimate justice of things,” he wrote. “The minor cadences of despair change often to triumph and calm confidence.”45 Building from Du Bois’s legacy, Ray Pratt has similarly emphasized music’s ability to create alternative realities and prophecy what he calls “wider utopian social transformations” in his study of African American spirituals and blues. “Through affectively empowering emotional changes,” Pratt writes, “music promotes the establishment of sustaining relations of community and subculture that are fundamental to the creation of an alternative public realm, a kind of cultural free space made of materials taken from thousands of composers and musicians who contribute the essential elements of what is propagated by the culture industries.”46 In The Black Atlantic, Paul Gilroy explores a related idea in the context of the African diaspora and its “counterculture of modernity,” by emphasizing black music’s role in generating a “politics of transfiguration.”47 For Gilroy, black music gives voice to an extended racial community across the disparate spaces of diaspora, “a community of needs and solidarity.” What is so crucial about Gilroy’s writings on black music here is that he stresses the extent to which a liberatory, transformative politics is not simply reflected in music or represented by music, but actually “made audible” in the music itself. Music is not a stagnant receptacle waiting to be filled with a political urgency toward change and social restructuring. Music is an agent of that urgency, that change, and that restructuring, a politics that Gilroy notes “exists on a lower frequency where it is played, danced, and acted, as well as sung, and sung about.”48 Graham Locke names that frequency— taking a cue from a Duke Ellington composition and the “Astro Black Mythology” of Sun Ra that charged music with the task of transcending the impossible to imagine a better future world—“blutopia,” a musical utopia that is “tinged with the blues, an African-American visionary future stained with memories,” a musical utopia that envisions an alternate future without relinquishing the black past.49 Audiotopia is informed and indebted to this work and this tradition but also asks that we cast a wider net. In the pages that follow, I return to the blutopias of the black diaspora—Bessie Smith’s blues, Afro-Cuban jazz— but also consider how audiotopias function in other contexts and other di24\n\nintroduction\n\nasporas, in the klezmer-pop of Jewish musician Mickey Katz and in the rock hyrbids of rock en español bands on both sides of the U.S.–Mexico border. And while scholars like Locke and Gilroy have geared their utopianist listenings to music more toward the intentions and actions of the musicians making the music, Audiotopia also focuses on how listeners approach the music that they hear. What this book is concerned with—and why it begins with Whitman, a listener and a writer, not a musician—is the critical process of listening to music, of how we—fans and critics alike—might listen differently to the music we hear. In this way, I am inspired by Christoper Small’s suggestion that instead of thinking about music as a single, isolated performance, we think of “musicking” (the present participle of the verb to music)—the entire process and context of a performance that involves everyone and everything that a performance touches, from the roadies to the record execs to the musicians to the audience, “the totality of a musical performance.”50 I look at the musicians who make the music (Paul Whiteman, George Gershwin, Mickey Katz, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Bessie Smith, Charlie Parker, Jaguares, Tijuana NO, Café Tacuba), but I also look at listeners who receive the music and make their own music out of it, painters like Jean-Michel Basquiat, writers like James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, and Guillermo Gómez-Peña. They are all, in their own ways, engaged with music’s audiotopias and the differences they make. As such, this book is an attempt to re-think the relationship between American identity, American race, and American music—an intersection we might summarily think of as the American audio-racial imagination— by focusing on the spaces of music, the spaces of songs, and the spaces of sounds. When Whitman heard America sing, he heard America in the space of songs. But Whitman was not an audiotopic listener. He did not hear America as a space of difference, a space of crossing. Whitman imagined his democratic utopia based on a harmony—on a convergence of songs—that he was already hearing, a harmony that sweetened the sound of difference in the name of establishing the native music of the American new world. The musicians and writers in Audiotopia listen and think audiotopically, in that they listen for music that is already made but not yet heard, music that makes audible racialized communities who have been silenced by the nationalist ear. Whereas the “I Hear America Singing” school of nationalist listening hears an America where racial difference has been indexed and silenced, this book proposes a listening that hears an America whose music is the space of strangers among sounds\n\n25\n\nracial difference, where racial difference is performed against the grain of a suffocating nationalism. If we think of music as an audiotopia—a force of difference—to use it as a tool of nationalism and nation-building eager to eradicate that difference is always already a failed project. This is the reality of the American audio-racial imagination, where race is heard, where the sounds of racial formation and racial identity are made audible in the audiotopias of American popular music. When I use the phrase “the American audio-racial imagination,” I mean the extent to which meanings and ideas about race, racial identity, and racialization within the United States have been generated, developed, and experienced at the level of sound and music. My interest in the American audio-racial imagination was born from a simple proposition: there is no way of separating the histories of U.S. popular music from the history of ethnic and racial formation in the United States, and vice-versa. The audioracial imagination is my way of acknowledging a fact all too commonly overlooked in the “culture wars” and debates about diversity and multiculturalism, that race and popular music have always been experienced not alongside each other, not as complements, supplements, or corollaries of each other, but through each other. As Ronald Radano and Philip Bohlman put it in the introduction to their edited collection of essays, Music and the Racial Imagination, which treats race as a ghost that haunts contemporary musicology scholarship, “music participates in many of the aesthetic and discursive constructions of race, and race provides one of the necessary elements in the construction of music.”51 Yet, in the case of the United States and the national fantasy of “America,” music does not just “participate” in American racial constructions, it has been central to their history since the eighteenth century. And while race is surely one of the elements involved in the construction of music generally, it is arguably the central one in the construction of “American” music as a cultural expression and ideological force used both at home and abroad to promote wider understandings of the racial make-up of American culture. What Jocelyne Guillbaut argues about the music of the West Indies in her contribution to Music and the Racial Imagination is equally true for the United States: “Musical discourses are therefore conceived not as the mere reflection of racial projects, but rather as being actively engaged in their very production.”52 Chapter 1 begins exploring this relationship between musical discourses and the production of racial projects by taking up Whitman’s 1860 call to “hear America sing” in greater detail. Specifically, I examine the racial proj26\n\nintroduction\n\nect this particular musical discourse created and track its legacy as a mode of monocultural nationalist listening within the rise of the “melting pot” school of American ethnic and racial theory—in pop music, and in attempts by political theorists to further use music to metaphorically conjure a racially homogenous American republic. One musician born into this period of American singing, musical melting pots, and symphonic nations who went on to make music that disrupted choruses of cultural consensus was the Jewish American musical comedian Mickey Katz. Chapter 2 surveys Katz’s career, and the opposition to it by assimilationist Jewish Americans, while offering his songs as parodic audiotopias where Hit Parade suburbia and Yiddish-speaking immigrant Jewish America negotiate an in-between place of dual cultural belonging. Chapter 3 moves to the audiotopias heard in the music of blues singer Bessie Smith by African American writer James Baldwin. Baldwin was, indeed, a writer, but I also take him seriously as a listener. I show how music informed and continually transformed the way he wrote, the way he lived, and the way he thought—about race and sexuality, about himself, his country, and the egalitarian swell of humanity he always fought to be unconditionally included in. In Chapter 4, the audiotopias are paintings and songs—the audible canvases of Jean-Michel Basquiat and the blind but all-seeing compositions, saxophone dreams, and breath meditations of Rahsaan Roland Kirk. In both cases, America is still singing, but what we hear is the continual song of blackness and black liberation—race and racial formation revealed, performed, and experienced at the level of sound. The African American poet Langston Hughes wrote that he, too, sang America, and in chapter 5 I suggest that he, too, heard America singing, but with different notes and different chords. Hughes’s singing America was not simply a black racial rejoinder to Whitman. It wasn’t just the America of “the darker brother,” as he put it, but the America of the Americas: of Mexico south of the two-thousand-mile-long borderline he so often traveled across by train, and of Cuba, east across the seas he sailed across on steamers to collaborate with Afro-Cuban poets and hear the maps of blackness redefined in rumba clubs. The transnational musical map Hughes composes in his Latin Jazz poem Ask Your Mama fades into the audiotopias of rock en español in chapter 6. The America that Whitman heard singing and the melting-pot music of a geographically bounded and racially singular America is a distant memory here, as U.S. rock wakes up singing in Spanish, living in the borstrangers among sounds\n\n27\n\nderlands between nations, and giving voice to Latino/a migrant communities who move between nations, languages, and cultural traditions. In the music of Café Tacuba and Tijuana NO—music heard and identified with by Latino/a listeners from Los Angeles to Mexico City—Whitman’s “teeming nation of nations” is replaced by “teeming nations of nations,” the United States as one point of contact, one point of entry for continental flows of ideas, people, and sound.53 The last sound of America singing that we hear, then, is the sound of national identities restructuring themselves as they move back and forth across borders meant to stop them, redrawing the maps of the worlds they want to live in through the music they defiantly make.\n\n28\n\nintroduction\n\none\n\nAgainst Easy Listening Or, How to Hear America Sing The white cracker who wrote the national anthem knew what he was doing.

Yet it was not the first time he put his ear to the people and places of the United States and heard songs. In “Song of Myself,” the landmark poem that opened the first edition of Leaves of Grass five years earlier in 1855, Whitman had already positioned himself as a kind of human audio receiver who channeled the voices of common people and the voices of the earth and the cosmos, receiving their signals and broadcasting them outward as his own. “Through me many long dumb voices,” he proclaimed, “voices of the interminable generations of slaves, voices of prostitutes and of deformed persons . . . and of the threads that connect the stars . . . of fog in the air and beetles rolling balls of dung.”1 And the sounds weren’t just metaphoric or symbolic. They were, he promised, actual music, the music of America: “I hear the chorus . . . it is a grand-opera . . . this indeed is music!”2 These ideas were crystallized in “I Hear America Singing.” Whitman now heard neither voices nor operas, but songs sung by working men and women, the songs of mechanics, carpenters, masons, shoemakers, mothers, wives. “I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,” he wrote. “Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else.”3 The trajectory of Whitman’s poem—in which songs belong only to those who sing them where they sing them, “to him or her and to none else”—sets up a series of basic points that constitute his model of American listening. First, the nation is a sounded terrain and a musical construction. Second, the formation of America depends upon the performance of songs by people whose singing of those songs defines their Americanness. Third, political and cultural citizenship is configured through the performance of popular music and its reception, via acts of listening, by the people. That is, when Whitman hears America singing, we are to believe he is hearing American songs, the sounds that Americans make. The poem posits a direct relationship between musical performance and the formation of national identity. If nations have songs, and if nations involve the generation of what Immanuel Wallerstein has called “peoplehood constructs,” then these people are themselves sonorous—their national and cultural citizenship understood to have an acoustic, aural dimension that sonically interpolates them into the body of the nation.4 “I Hear America Singing” didn’t just create a trope that would come to dominate popular discourse about the national arts for the next century, it created a school of thought. To “hear America sing” has come to imply a specific kind of listening, a listening that is nationalist and tuned into the frequencies of cultural consensus and univocality, keeping minoritized voices 30\n\nchapter 1\n\nquiet, or audible only by proxy (blackface minstrel troupes being the extreme example). Whitman historian David S. Reynolds has pointed out that Whitman “regarded music as a prime agent for unity and uplift in a nation whose tendencies to fragmentation and political corruption he saw clearly.”5 He believed that it was music that was loved and shared by all Americans; it was music that could bring the nation together. Predictably, then, Whitman’s American listening was likewise geographically bounded, a listening that—in the face of forces of perceived fragmentation and corruption—experienced its formation in tandem with the wider political rise of imperialist expansion policies that, through appeals to Manifest Destiny, attempted to secure the borders and boundaries of the United States as America. The school of listening that Whitman unwittingly created has endured as one of this country’s most well-known and marketable ways of understanding itself. Poems, anthologies, murals, CDs, record albums, and musicals have all borrowed Whitman’s idea and used “I Hear America Singing” in their titles and as their conceptual anchor, so much so that it has become perhaps one of the more dominant and familiar slogans of U.S. artistic culture. As recently as 1999, there was Sing America, a CD compilation that benefited the Save America’s Treasures foundation, an organization “devoted to preserving the symbols of American heritage and culture.” Officially endorsed by then First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, the album began with Leonard Bernstein conducting “Fanfare for the Common Man” and ended with Cher singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Super Bowl XXXIII. Perhaps more true to Whitman’s original intent was the 1975 release of I Hear America Singing by the California company GRT Music Productions. A decorously boxed album set that conflated listening to the music of America with waving the flag and fighting wars, I Hear America Singing was accompanied by a fifty-page booklet that set out to show “how the richness of America—its history and its people can be found in its music—the ballads, the folk songs, marches and hymns, blues and jazz, opera and country music.”6 The collection mixed military songs with “Home on the Range,” “The Star-Spangled Banner” with “Dixie,” and early jazz staples like “When the Saints Go Marching In” with “God Bless America.” Whitman’s presence was everywhere. The booklet’s introduction began with a photographic portrait of Whitman himself and a reproduction of his handwritten opening lines to “I Hear America Singing.” “Through music,” the authors wrote, “[eighteenth-century Americans] achieved unity in the presence of diversity.”7 against easy listening\n\n31\n\ns e l e c t i ve h e a r i n g\n\nWhen “I Hear America Singing” first appeared as a poem in 1860, it was sandwiched between two other poems, “Me Imperturbe” and “Poets to Come.” The former is a poem of position, with Whitman declaring his coordinates as a lone democratic bard facing the geography of his Americanness. “Me toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee, or far north or inland,” he described himself. “Me wherever my life is lived.”8 His life was lived within the borders of the United States: the Northeast, the South, far enough inside the United States to be looking out toward the Mexican sea. Whitman was announcing his location as an American, his wandering feet only wandering so far. The latter poem dealt with Whitman’s own limits as a poet and American singer, a candid message to the next generation of “orators, singers, musicians to come!” to carry on a legacy he can’t complete himself. “I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping, turns a casual look upon you and then averts his face,” he confessed, “leaving it to you to prove and define it, expecting the main things from you.”9 Whitman hears America singing, then, after he tells us where his America is and before he tells us that his hearing, his singing, is only the beginning. Such a self-fashioning speaks directly to both the poem’s home in the political and social order of the mid-nineteenth century and to its acknowledged limits as a model of listening. Whitman carried out his nationally tuned American listening at a crucial moment in the history of U.S. nation-formation, during the years between the end of the U.S.–Mexican War in 1848 and the end of the Civil War in 1865. That neither of these events or what they signified—the conquest and subjugation of Mexican citizens and the emancipation of enslaved African Americans—left a sonic mark on what Whitman heard or how he chose to listen to America only serves to emphasize that Whitman’s “hearing” of America was a selective hearing.10 I stress this precisely because Whitman’s listening was not simply a poetic device.11 Whitman was a music critic. During the 1840s, he wrote about Stephen Foster, opera, white “singing family” groups, and white and black minstrel troupes (who sang what Whitman once dubbed “nigger songs”) for publications such as the Brooklyn Eagle, the Democratic Review, and Life Illustrated.12 One of his favorite groups was The Hutchinsons, a white New Hampshire family troupe of singing abolitionists who toured with Frederick Douglass and played women’s rights conventions, and who Whitman held up as the great hope of native American music. “We hope no spirit of 32\n\nchapter 1\n\nimitation"
