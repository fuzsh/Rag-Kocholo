D A LT O N Few stars of Mexican cinema have left a more lasting mark on the national film industry than Lorena Velázquez. The actress leveraged her success in the controversial Miss Mexico 1956 pageant—in which she took first runnerup —for a long career on the silver screen.1 Her forays in the national film industry began in 1956 with the production of ¡Viva la juventud! (Fernando Cortés), but she consolidated her star power during the Mexploitation epoch, which lasted from the early 1960s through the late 1980s. Her first role in this new era came in La nave de los monstruos (Rogelio A. González, 1960), where she played one of two Venusian sisters who employ their irresistible sexuality in an attempt to conquer Earth. Her first lucha libre film was Santo vs. los zombies (Benito Alazraki, 1962), where she played a damsel-in-distress. Over the next year she would appear in two very different, yet equally iconic, lucha libre roles: Zorina, Queen of the Vampire Women in Santo contra las mujeres vampiro (Alfonso Corona Blake, 1962) and Gloria Venus, a fictional luchadora, in Las luchadoras contra el médico asesino (René Cardona, 1963). This chapter analyzes how Velázquez’s performances interfaced with evolving attitudes surrounding the role of women in 1960s Mexican society. Her parts tended to engage the traditional duality between the Virgin of Guadalupe 63 The Star Power of Lorena Velázquez in Lucha Libre Cinema and La Malinche, and she performed both ends of the spectrum with confidence . The fact that she could play such distinctive roles so well suggests that we view her performances through the lens of the chica moderna. Indeed, throughout her performances and her own private life, Velázquez took advantage of changing attitudes surrounding gender to harness a degree of star power that few people, regardless of gender, could rival. Velázquez’s success was especially remarkable given that the early part of her career coincided with the emergence of the so-called Mexploitation era, when the national film industry had to negotiate new funding and distribution realities that led to inexpensive, often lower-quality productions.2 Studies published within Mexico have yet to adopt the word Mexploitation.3 Nevertheless, Seraina Rohrer notes that this term serves as a useful umbrella for a wide array of films ranging from lucha libre cinema to the sexy fichera and violent border films—or any combination of these—that found great commercial success from the 1960s through the 1980s.4 The perceived lack of prestige in the Mexploitation era has certainly contributed to the fact that, despite numerous studies on the Golden Age star system, very little has been written about the following generation.5 Rohrer conjectures that this may reflect the fact that Mexploitation stars earned less than their Hollywood and (presumably) Golden Age counterparts, but she also belongs to a current of criticism that proclaims that Mexploitation “produce[d] its own stars.”6 Of course, most scholarship continues to prioritize the movement ’s male actors like El Santo, los Hermanos Almada, and others.7 That said, we should recognize that Velázquez launched an eight-decade career by performing gender in a way that attracted moviegoers as she navigated the Mexploitation landscape. She accepted the roles available to her, and her films tended to dialogue with—and frequently, to uncritically reproduce—both the Virgin trope, which emphasized adherence to strict sexual norms and motherhood, and the la Malinche trope, which embodied treason and sexual promiscuity.8 Though la Malinche was originally a figure that intersected female and indigenous subjectivity, Sandra M. Cypess notes that, by midcentury, authors and cultural producers began to employ “La Malinche as a subtext to comment on male-female relations [regardless of race] in Mexico.”9 As with any binary, this one attracted criticism both for its simplicity and its serious implications for Mexican women at large. This held especially true regarding the national cin- [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-21 03:13 GMT) 64 David S. Dalton ema, where, according to Jean Franco, directors “often seem[ed] to position the woman spectator as accessory to her own subordination.”10 Little, if any, empirical data exists to provide clues as to how Mexican women internalized the discourses of midcentury cinema, but even a cursory viewing..."
