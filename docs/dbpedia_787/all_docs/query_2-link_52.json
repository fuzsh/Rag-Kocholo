        "text": "Leila Ledbetter, Research & Education\n\nGraduation is an important and exciting time of change for many students. Sadly, one of these changes may involve losing access to many Duke resources such as library subscriptions to journals and databases.\n\nBefore You Lose Access\n\nGo through your saved citations and PDFs and decide which ones you want to keep. If there are any articles that you would like to get PDFs for, do this before you leave while you still have access to free full text.\n\nEvaluate your citation manager needs before you leave. If you are using Endnote, double-check that you have the most current version on a personal device. This access will last you for a couple years, but you will have to repurchase it at some point for approximately $250. Free citation management options, like Zotero, are excellent alternatives!\n\nSuggestions for Free Resources You Can Use\n\nDuke OneLink\n\nDuke graduates can use their NetID and email account for one year after graduation; however, your NetID will no longer allow you to access the same software, journal articles or databases that you can while you are a student. The alumni office is offering a very limited set of resources that require you to set up a Duke OneLink Account. These resources are not medically focused, but they are worth checking out since they are free.\n\nResources through the Library\n\nThough you may be leaving Duke, you will still have access to the Llibrary's Website! Under the Guides section of our site, there are resources for helping you conduct research, using databases, writing and citing, and finding and accessing things like images. These curated guides frequently point to free resources found around the Internet. The tools for staying current can be super useful for keeping up with new research in your field. Our Duke Alumni Services page may also be useful.\n\nFree Clinical Tools for Health Professionals\n\nThough this Libguide provides a full list of free resources, the following are worth special mention.\n\nPubMed Central, a sub-section of PubMed, is guaranteed to have full text articles. Since critical appraisal is important, keep in mind that not all of the articles will be from peer-reviewed journals. The PubMed database will always be freely available to you, but full text access provided via Duke subscriptions will not be available once you leave Duke.\n\nEndnote Click can be aded to your browser to automatically check if there is an open access version of the article you want. The open access version may be the author's manuscript or a preprint instead of the final published version.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) has free full text for a variety of vetted open access journals covering many subjects and languages.\n\nAdditional Resources to Consider\n\nJoin your NC Area Health Education Center (AHEC): If you will remain in North Carolina, you should consider joining the AHEC and the AHEC Digital Library. For a yearly fee, AHEC members have access to a suite of databases, journals, and other digital resources.\n\nContact the Regional Medical Library (RML) in your area: To find out what resources and services are available to you, contact the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NNLM) at 1-800-338-RMLS (7657), Mon-Fri from 8:30a-5p.\n\nExplore your local university library: Some college and university libraries allow the public to use their resources if you are physically in the library. It's worth a call or email to find out what the library's access rules are.\n\nInvestigate your public library: Public libraries often subscribe to a few health databases like CINAHL, and they may also have a means to obtain full text articles.\n\nReview organizational membership perks: Some professional organizations, like the American Physical Therapy Association, offer access to databases or certain journals as a part of their annual memberships.\n\nKayla Cavenaugh, Medical Center Archives Intern\n\nThe North Carolina Licensed Practical Nurses Association (NCLPNA) Records have been processed and are now open for research. The collection contains administrative records related to the day-to-day operations of the NCLPNA, including meeting minutes, reports, correspondence, education and conference materials, publications, financial and membership records, photographs, publications, and ephemera. Major topics cover licensed practical nursing, nursing education standards in North Carolina, African American women in medicine, North Carolina hospital systems, and healthcare advocacy.\n\nThe NCLPNA Records were donated in March 2022 by Jessie Parker Smith, LPN, who served as former Executive Treasurer of the NCLPNA and was a recipient of the Lillian Kuster Award, presented by the National Federation of Licensed Practical Nurses. Smith was also a member of one of the first graduating classes of LPNs from the Durham School of Practical Nursing, with a career at Duke Hospital spanning over 40 years. In 2006, she was celebrated by Duke University Medical Center as a member of the \"Trailblazers,\" the name given to a cohort of the first African American nurses hired by Duke. Read more about her experiences as a Black women in healthcare in her 2022 interview conducted by the Medical Center Archives.\n\nThe NCLPNA was founded in Raleigh, NC, in 1947 with 22 charter members. Their mission was to provide professional development, continuing education opportunities, and political advocacy for Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) and practical nursing students in the state of North Carolina. The NCLPNA stands out as a nursing group established by African American women and LPNs of color who shared knowledge and education, improved patient care, and advocated for their profession.\n\nIn the late 1940s, when North Carolina hospitals still widely segregated hospital services based on a patient’s race, the role of LPN was a vital entry point for women of color into the healthcare profession. In Durham, for example, women of color, including Jessie Parker Smith and fellow Trailblazer Clydie Pugh-Myers, earned LPN certifications through the Durham School of Practical Nursing and received clinical training at Duke Hospital. While the NCLPNA began as a nursing group composed of predominantly Black women and nurses of color, by the 1960s, representation had expanded to reflect a diverse array of backgrounds and identity groups, including men, among LPNs throughout North Carolina.\n\nWhile processing this collection, I realized that beyond documenting the administrative history of the NCLPNA, this collection is also a glimpse into the vibrant inner worlds of North Carolina hospitals during the latter half of the twentieth century. Growing up in the 1990s, I always overheard my mother and aunt talking about their own lives as registered nurses when they worked at New Hanover Regional Medical Center -- known to me simply as “The Hospital.” Before landing my own job in a hospital decades later, I was always curious to know: Who else worked at The Hospital? What took place in there?\n\nAs I worked through this collection, I came across traces of the nurses in their correspondence and bits of ephemera, all mailed directly to the NCLPNA headquarters in Durham from nurses across the state. This included doodles carefully traced in pencil of Lucy playing nurse with Snoopy as her patient, used for designing educational workshop and conference flyers; greeting cards and stationery home to a menagerie of creatures, including a raccoon, a snail, and Garfield; lengthy letters jotted down in looping cursive during nights spent at the ward desk; and an abundance of gossip and hand-snipped newspaper clippings.\n\n“Some nurse.” Ephemera includes undated pencil doodles of Lucy playing nurse, much to Snoopy’s consternation as her patient. Drawings like this might have been run through a photocopier, with the resulting paper copies cut up and pasted onto flyers to promote upcoming events and membership. The empty speech bubbles provided space to write in a call to action.\n\nIn a standout letter signed by Sybil Lucas, LPN, dated December 8, 1964, she imagines a future where her letters remain undisturbed in an archive for centuries.\n\nA section from Sybil Lucas’ (germ-free) typed letter. While Duke University Medical Center Archives reading room does not have a glass top table, Sybil Lucas’ letters will nevertheless be available for research.\n\nWhile the NCLPNA no longer exists as a professional network for LPNs today, licensed practical nursing continues to be an area of specialization for many nurses in North Carolina. The correspondence in the collection, especially the letters written by Sybil Lucas, opens many avenues of study about the history of licensed practical nursing in North Carolina. This includes discussions about race in healthcare settings and interpersonal relationships among nursing professionals. This collection will appeal to anyone curious about nursing legislation, education, and advocacy, as well as the experiences of Black and African American healthcare professionals in North Carolina hospitals and healthcare systems during the mid- to late-twentieth century.\n\nPictured on right: Hand-drawn flyers promoting a 1969 continuing educational workshop about cancer, held at Duke University Medical Center, and a 1974 membership drive for the Oxford Area Chapter of the NCLPNA.\n\nArchival collections like the North Carolina Licensed Practical Nurses Association (NCLPNA) Records provide context, evidence, and testimony of the day-to-day experiences of LPNs. We welcome all researchers who are interested in accessing the collection. To view all of our Collections, search the Archives’ holdings\n\nPlease contact the Medical Center Archives with questions or for access to these materials.\n\nThis Duke 100 Centennial series highlights some of the pioneers, trailblazers, and events at Duke in the last 100 years.
