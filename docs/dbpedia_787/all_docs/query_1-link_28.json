The ring has a setting for a large stone, but it was already missing when Bronia received the ring. She believed the stone had been removed by the Germans. She met and married Morris Kirsch, also a displaced person from Poland, in 1945 in Feldafing, Germany. The family emigrated to the United States in 1950.\n\nSewing case with six ornate gold mending tools\n\nObject\n\nSewing case, with a Parisian jeweler's plate, with a needle case, sewing needle, thimble, scissors, seam ripper, and darning needle received by Morris Kirsch while he was living in the displaced persons camp in Ansbach, Germany, after World War II. The kit was originally from France. In 1939, when the Germans occupied Łódź, Poland, Morris was assigned as forced labor in the ghetto making uniforms for the German army. In 1943, the Germans transferred him through a series of forced labor and concentration camps. He was liberated by American troops in April 1945. He was sent to the Feldafing displaced persons camp, where he met and married Bronia Bergman. The couple was then housed in Ansbach. They had a daughter, Sarah, in 1946. The family emigrated to the United States in 1950."
