        "text": "Born in Welland, Ontario, Ruth lived a full and rewarding life, maintaining an active engagement with her Toronto and Vancouver extended families. She passed away suddenly at home in Richmond, B.C., leaving behind heartbroken family and friends.\n\nRuth was polite, proper, gentle, sweet and kind, and always carried herself with class and a big smile. Ruth truly enjoyed family gatherings, the occasional happy hour and always maintained that family was the most important part of her life.\n\nIn addition to being a devoted mother and community member, Ruth excelled in her vocational activities, first as a Travel Agent and later as an Insurance Broker. She was a leader in both industries, earning many awards of merit for top sales achievements. Ruth was very loyal and loving to her family and to anyone fortunate enough to make her acquaintance.\n\nHer passion for travel took her to many interesting destinations in the world, first with husband Morris and later with her 2nd husband of almost 20 years, Leo.\n\nRuth is survived by her husband Leo Guskin, son Kenneth Kirsch, grandchildren Lia, Morgan, Jared, great-grandson Neven, her brother Gordon (Sally- RIP) Smith, and stepdaughters Linda (Phil) Carriere, Michelle (Joe) Maga, and step-grandchildren Larissa, Brenden, Ryan, Joshua and Benjamin, as well as other extended family members in Ontario.\n\nRuth was predeceased by her parents Benjamin and Minnie Smith, daughter Karen Kirsch (Corey) Swan, first husband Morris Kirsch, and brothers Morry (Miriam) Smith and Harry (Gwen) Smith."
