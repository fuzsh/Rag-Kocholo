She married Carlton Johnson, the son of Madeline “Dutchie” and Charles Johnson, at the First Baptist Church of Glens Falls on September 4th, 1960. Judy and Carlton went on to have 5 children.\n\nShe started her work career at Glens Falls Insurance, then C.R. Bard serving her community as a literacy volunteer while there. Judy was brave, brave enough to start not one but two successful businesses. Even braver to instill a sense of confident adventure in her children and grandchildren. In 1989, she started a daycare service at home. Then in 1995, Judy and Carl opened Landon Hill Bed & Breakfast, in Chestertown, until 2015, in which time she made many friends through the Chamber and B.P.W. Foundation.

Alongside her husband, Judy enjoyed making new friends in South Carolina and Florida, visiting her extended family and friends, as well as traveling as far as Alaska, Hawaii, Scotland and everywhere in between.\n\nThe oldest of five girls she was a big sister, a role she cherished for her siblings and cousins.\n\nStalwart and courageous in her love for family, Judy instilled these same values on to her children and grandchildren. Judy will be remembered as gregarious, for sure! Injecting laughter and true friendship that made lifelong bonds, kindness that stood out, embodied by so many that think of Judy as a second mom, and that say so.\n\nUnflinching, Judy stood tall (at five foot four), recognizing unfairness to others in the workplace, calling it out, and insistent on resolution. Nothing asked for in return.\n\nHumming was second nature for Judy, most prominent when cooking, especially baking. Summer was special when you spent time with Judy. Clothes drying in the breeze, berry picking (humming of course), picnics, swimming (floating), and holding hands with Carl down at the shoreline throughout their life together.\n\nTime spent with her family was her most cherished of gifts. Big moments (births, vacations, holidays, and birthdays), and endless simple moments with everyone gathered together for a Johnson feast, and laughter that spilled into the living room. Mom was fun!\n\nJudy was strong in her faith, passing those values to her family. She was an active member of the First Baptist Church of Glens Falls and for a time was a Sunday School teacher.\n\nJust one woman, raised on a family farm in Fenimore, whose legacy of love and kindness thrives in all those she shared with.\n\nJudy had a passion for many things including, family, kids, grandkids, Labradors, flowers, cardinals, ladybugs, reading, dancing, buying gifts, floating on the water, baking, a good romance novel, sunsets over Long Pond, afternoons on the porch at the B&B, Monday Margarita “Straight up!” (Maybe two), A secret “language” with her sisters, and a game of Hearts (her favorite) but Pinochle too.\n\nShe was an avid animal lover to her dogs, Tasha, Blue, Toby, Gus, Brenna, Ptarmigan, Cranberry and all of her “grandpets”.\n\nBesides her parents, Judy was predeceased by her sisters, Edna Sexton and Joyce Monahan.\n\nSurvivors include her husband of 62 years, Carlton “Butch” Johnson; son Brian Johnson, his wife Amy and son Adam; son Scott Johnson, his wife Lynn, son, Connor; son Matthew Johnson, his wife Jessica and two daughters, Adeline and Evelyn; son Paul Johnson and his wife Marieke Gartner; daughter Jennifer Johnson and her partner Todd Parke; sisters Helen Edwards and her husband, John; Eugenia Dragon and her husband, John, as well as several nieces, nephews, cousins and extended family.\n\nFriends may call Sunday, March 12, 2023, from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. at the Carleton Funeral Home, Inc., 68 Main St., in Hudson Falls.
