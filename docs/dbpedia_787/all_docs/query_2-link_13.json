An entrepreneur's journey can be isolating even when surrounded by people, inequitable access to information, resources and networks, only exacerbates that. At MicroMentor, we see psychological well-being as a critical part of the support system we offer. And mentoring makes a difference. Our recent impact study found (with statistical significance) that mentored entrepreneurs, as compared to those not mentored, experience increased sense of purpose (9% increase), increase in supportive social relationships (11%), increased optimism about the future (9%), feeling positive (12.2%) to name a few metrics. As mentors, mentees, and contributors, we recognize that the support we offer each other isn't just professional‚Äîit's a vital pillar for emotional resilience. Through our Ethos Petal, \"We Build Powerful Human Connections.\", we strive to cultivate a global ecosystem where entrepreneurs and mentors unite to not only drive business success but also to nurture their emotional wellness. And, inner work for outer impact is key as practitioners in this space. Having just attended the gathering of impact leaders at GlobalPDX this morning, I am once again reminded that a culture of acceptance forms our baseline, providing the safe space needed for individualism and authenticity to thrive. My team reminds me daily how important it is to celebrate our diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and perspectives, knowing they contribute not only to our collective strength but also to our emotional well-being. How has mentorship impacted not only your business journey, but also your emotional well-being? Thank you for working tirelessly to make this happen: Tatiana P√©rez Petrone, Justine Blackmore (Raschio), Guillermo Castells, Sara Fustolo, Renee Reichart, Sarah McRae and the whole team! And to my circle of peers who remind me how important it is to amplify this message Jailan Adly John T. Stephens Ursula M.

So what matters? I was thinking about this for a long time after connecting with close to 100 women in the last 3 months who are seemingly successful and yet stressed in life Beyond dreams, goals and aspirations Beyond responsibilities, balance and hustle Beyond money, travel and fineries Beyond past, present and future ü™∑Be in the moment and give your self permission to happy, healthy, rest and relax without guiltü™∑ As a Doctor and Mindset Coach for women, after going through ups and downs all in my life, the only message I have for women is be kind to your self. Delegate, have boundaries, take rest. Happy women's day üíï The video is sourced from Facebook.

They remind me of age, past mistakes, and missed opportunities. But in celebration of embracing discomfort, I'll share 8 insights I've gained in the last 365 days. üèÉ Insight 1: We may start at the same time, but we run different races. I got my first grant half a decade later than my peers. Raising young children during residency slowed down my productivity. But looking back, those early years were like running with weights. Now the weights are off and I'm ready to sprint. üìö Insight 2: Nothing is as EASY as it seems. I thought writing 20 patient charts a day would mean I could easily write a research paper. That was until I got REAL feedback. I‚Äôve never see so much red in my life. Everything new is a skill that needs to be learned. üåÑ Insight 3: Nothing is as HARD as it seems - once you COMMIT. I struggled with academic writing until I committed to improve. I had to relearn basic English writing and academic writing. üí™ Insight 4: Be brave in taking your own stance. I've often felt out of place with my intense personality and love for hustling. I often hear: ‚Äúit‚Äôs not healthy to work daily‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get burnout‚Äù. When I finally embraced my own stance, I found others who shared my intensity. üìè Insight 5: Measure life by DISTANCE, not TIME. I learned this from @BenjaminPHardy 's \"Slipstream Time Hacking\" To get more time - shorten the timeline to achieve the target. To move fast means that you have all the time in the world. üéØ Insight 6: Align personal, professional, and financial goals. I've spent the last year bringing my family in line with my goal of helping 10 million patients. Many family meetings on: goals, strategies and money. This has allowed me to be the same person at home and at work üåç Insight 7: Learn from industries outside your field. My growth accelerated when I embraced entrepreneurship. The business world now fuels my research strategies. üöÄ Insight 8: Do uncomfortable things to build self-confidence. From the quiet girl in school, I've stepped onto TEDx stages and started a YouTube channel. I still cringe as I edit my videos and listen to myself talk. It still hurts when I'm called an \"academic sellout\" for starting a business. But doing these uncomfortable things DESPITE the negative feelings is what built the confidence that I could handle bigger problems.\n\nMAKE SURE TO SAVE THIS POST! Being consistent even when things are hard means you‚Äôre moving like the experts.üî•üî• Experts struggle. Experts have mentors. Experts are just like us. So the experts that keep going when things get tough and still reach their goals, what do they have in common? ‚¨áÔ∏è 1.) They have a strong sense of purpose and clear, well-defined goals that guide their actions.üî• 2.) They view failures and setbacks as opportunities for learning and growth. No more ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible - I tried‚Äù This means they navigate hard times on their terms while achieving the life of their dreams. 3.)They understand the importance of balancing work with rest and recovery. They prioritize self-care practices to maintain their physical and mental well-being. 4.) They seek out mentors and coaches who provide guidance and support.

You can have the most amazing role or business, but if you‚Äôre not energetically there, you‚Äôre not feeling feeling capable, worthy or aligned you‚Äôre going to struggle‚Ä¶ When we start to shift into self belief, love ourselves more deeply, master our energy and trust the process, we move faster and collapse time. We create more impact and our ripple effect is felt much further out. We‚Äôre all here to create change in the world in our own way, not all of us answer the call to claiming our power..

While my imposter syndrome shows up in many other ways professionally, one place it doesn't is when I mentor. I've learned that I have so much to share and much of it is advice I WISH someone had shared with me. Volunteer mentorship is my favourite way to give back to my community... üíº I run a mentorship community for HR folks looking scale their skill-set üíÖ I run a female solopreneurship incubator (aptly named IncubateHER) AND... I'm so proud to be an official mentor with The Forum presented by the #ScotiabankWomenInitiative. Have you had the thought: \"I couldn't possibly be a mentor!\"? If so, here is some tough-love (üíú ) and advice (‚ú® ) that might just be the boost you need to go and share your gold with someone else: üíú When you don't trust yourself and your experiences so don't share, you risk keeping others from growing. ‚ú® Try taking it slowly, the next time someone asks a question in a group chat or slack community, share 1 thing that is relevant to the conversation. It doesn't have to blow minds, but you never know who needs to hear what! üíú Your knowledge is quite unique to you thanks to your personal life, when you doubt your value you're telling other women they should doubt theirs too. ‚ú® Make a list of topics you love to talk about or have learned about and for each one, write 3 things you learned anecdotally or through reading/podcasts etc. The magic is that these three things will be knowledge no one else has because how we interpret information is also unique to us! üíú Books, university and business magazines aren't the only way to learn. Your immigration experience, bad break-up, childhood trauma and shitty first part-time job have likely taught you SIGNIFICANTLY more. ‚ú® Unless you're a brain surgeon or a lawyer...stop judging the 'type' of education you have and instead focus on the lessons you learned in life...because I promise you they are fully transferable and incredibly valuable. Consider this the chat your high-school career councillor never gave you. Keep shining your lights and watch yourself and others grow because of it!!

These experiences have shaped me in profound ways and I want to share these heartfelt thoughts with the younger women - 1. Prioritize Your Health üí™üå± Your well-being is your most valuable asset. Take care of your physical and mental health. Remember, true wealth means little if you're not healthy. 2. Choose Your Inner Circle Thoughtfully üë•‚ù§Ô∏è As the renowned author Jim Rohn wisely said, \"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.\" Surround yourself with those who inspire and uplift you, and don't hesitate to distance yourself from toxic influences. 3. Cherish Experiences Over Possessions ‚úàÔ∏èüåç Material things can't match the memories and adventures that life offers. Travel, explore, and embrace new experiences. The stories you collect will be more valuable than any possession. 4. Love the Process, Not Just the Result üöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è Success is a journey, not a destination. Fall in love with the daily grind, the learning, and the small victories. Enjoy the process, and success will follow. 5. Discover Your Passion and Stay Curious üîçüöÄ Avoid comparing your path to others'. Find what truly fulfills you and follow your passion. 6. Commit to Continuous Learning üìöüß† Knowledge is a powerful resource that can unlock countless opportunities. Read, learn, and grow. 7. Take Ownership of Your Future üöÄüîë Your success and happiness are your responsibility. No one will hand them to you. Take consistent, conscious action towards your goals and shape the life you desire. #womeninbusiness #womenentrepreneurs #mothers #womenatwork #womenwhohustle Which of these lessons resonates with you the most?
