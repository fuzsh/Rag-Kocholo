        "text": "Super excited to be launching LIFE LAUNCH, a group creative coaching programme for women! https://lnkd.in/e9U6TqmW Start the new year in a way you have never started it before! LIFE LAUNCH is a programme for women who want to do things differently this year. Maybe you have a business idea or a project you would like to run, maybe you want to pursue a particular career path, or maybe the project is YOU and prioritising your own future and realising your dreams. Are you sick of New Year resolutions? Let’s face it, they never work, and January is dark enough without trying to start new habits, give up alcohol or steak. Besides, you always start off with the best intentions but two weeks in and you’ve given up, you feel disappointed in yourself and you resign yourself to the fact, that you are never really going to make significant changes in your life so what bother trying. Well, 2024 can be different! This year you can join a group of other women, all of whom have dreams and plans that this wish to realise, all of whom may have struggled to get any traction on these in the past, and all of whom have decided that they are not settling anymore and that they are committed to making their dreams happen and taking back control of their futures.

An entrepreneur's journey can be isolating even when surrounded by people, inequitable access to information, resources and networks, only exacerbates that. At MicroMentor, we see psychological well-being as a critical part of the support system we offer. And mentoring makes a difference. Our recent impact study found (with statistical significance) that mentored entrepreneurs, as compared to those not mentored, experience increased sense of purpose (9% increase), increase in supportive social relationships (11%), increased optimism about the future (9%), feeling positive (12.2%) to name a few metrics. As mentors, mentees, and contributors, we recognize that the support we offer each other isn't just professional—it's a vital pillar for emotional resilience. Through our Ethos Petal, \"We Build Powerful Human Connections.\", we strive to cultivate a global ecosystem where entrepreneurs and mentors unite to not only drive business success but also to nurture their emotional wellness. And, inner work for outer impact is key as practitioners in this space. Having just attended the gathering of impact leaders at GlobalPDX this morning, I am once again reminded that a culture of acceptance forms our baseline, providing the safe space needed for individualism and authenticity to thrive. My team reminds me daily how important it is to celebrate our diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and perspectives, knowing they contribute not only to our collective strength but also to our emotional well-being. How has mentorship impacted not only your business journey, but also your emotional well-being? Thank you for working tirelessly to make this happen: Tatiana Pérez Petrone, Justine Blackmore (Raschio), Guillermo Castells, Sara Fustolo, Renee Reichart, Sarah McRae and the whole team! And to my circle of peers who remind me how important it is to amplify this message Jailan Adly John T. Stephens Ursula M.

So what matters? I was thinking about this for a long time after connecting with close to 100 women in the last 3 months who are seemingly successful and yet stressed in life Beyond dreams, goals and aspirations Beyond responsibilities, balance and hustle Beyond money, travel and fineries Beyond past, present and future 🪷Be in the moment and give your self permission to happy, healthy, rest and relax without guilt🪷 As a Doctor and Mindset Coach for women, after going through ups and downs all in my life, the only message I have for women is be kind to your self. Delegate, have boundaries, take rest. Happy women's day 💕 The video is sourced from Facebook.

They remind me of age, past mistakes, and missed opportunities. But in celebration of embracing discomfort, I'll share 8 insights I've gained in the last 365 days. 🏃 Insight 1: We may start at the same time, but we run different races. I got my first grant half a decade later than my peers. Raising young children during residency slowed down my productivity. But looking back, those early years were like running with weights. Now the weights are off and I'm ready to sprint. 📚 Insight 2: Nothing is as EASY as it seems. I thought writing 20 patient charts a day would mean I could easily write a research paper. That was until I got REAL feedback. I’ve never see so much red in my life. Everything new is a skill that needs to be learned. 🌄 Insight 3: Nothing is as HARD as it seems - once you COMMIT. I struggled with academic writing until I committed to improve. I had to relearn basic English writing and academic writing. 💪 Insight 4: Be brave in taking your own stance. I've often felt out of place with my intense personality and love for hustling. I often hear: “it’s not healthy to work daily”, “you’ll get burnout”. When I finally embraced my own stance, I found others who shared my intensity. 📏 Insight 5: Measure life by DISTANCE, not TIME. I learned this from @BenjaminPHardy 's \"Slipstream Time Hacking\" To get more time - shorten the timeline to achieve the target. To move fast means that you have all the time in the world. 🎯 Insight 6: Align personal, professional, and financial goals. I've spent the last year bringing my family in line with my goal of helping 10 million patients. Many family meetings on: goals, strategies and money. This has allowed me to be the same person at home and at work 🌍 Insight 7: Learn from industries outside your field. My growth accelerated when I embraced entrepreneurship. The business world now fuels my research strategies. 🚀 Insight 8: Do uncomfortable things to build self-confidence. From the quiet girl in school, I've stepped onto TEDx stages and started a YouTube channel. I still cringe as I edit my videos and listen to myself talk. It still hurts when I'm called an \"academic sellout\" for starting a business. But doing these uncomfortable things DESPITE the negative feelings is what built the confidence that I could handle bigger problems.\n\nMAKE SURE TO SAVE THIS POST!

It feels potent. This year I’ve been helping women on the rise embody their inner warrior so they can show up from a place of truth, confidence and empowerment. This is the missing piece. You can have the most amazing role or business, but if you’re not energetically there, you’re not feeling feeling capable, worthy or aligned you’re going to struggle… When we start to shift into self belief, love ourselves more deeply, master our energy and trust the process, we move faster and collapse time. We create more impact and our ripple effect is felt much further out. We’re all here to create change in the world in our own way, not all of us answer the call to claiming our power.. As a twice certified Positive Psychology Coach, a certified mindset coach, trainer Muay Thai fighter and health / bio hacking enthusiast, this feels like the perfect fit for me and my clients are flying. Right now I have 3 core offerings if you’d like to know more. 1. 1:1 Battle Training Coaching. Personalised coaching to help you find your fight at work, embody your inner warrior and level up your well-being for brave women who are ready to walk the path. The investment is just £444 per month and includes 4 x 60 minute calls + support inbetween. 2. The Warrior Tribe Mastermind. A high touch, group coaching container for women who are made for more. Featuring a monthly 1:1 Battle Plan call to get you laser focussed. A weekly “CONQUER + CLAIM” call. Monthly Intention setting calls and a private community. Introductory price of just £222 per month (price increases in Jan and 1:1 won’t be offered after that). 3. WARRIOR WOMEN WEEKEND RETREATS. 3 transformational days for women on the rise. Held at a fairytale mansion in the Welsh borders, this 3 day experience is perfect for those women who are ready to surpass their limits and step into their next level of embodiment. Full list of dates in the comments. I’m also going to be offering bespoke well-being programmes into the workplace to help empower your workforce. DM me if you’d like details first. I’d love to hear from you if you’d like to find out how i can help you fast track your impact and results. ⚔️🛡️⚔️\n\nThe biggest misconception we have as women, is that we are never quite successful/qualified enough to give other people advice... While my imposter syndrome shows up in many other ways professionally, one place it doesn't is when I mentor. I've learned that I have so much to share and much of it is advice I WISH someone had shared with me. Volunteer mentorship is my favourite way to give back to my community... 💼 I run a mentorship community for HR folks looking scale their skill-set 💅 I run a female solopreneurship incubator (aptly named IncubateHER) AND... I'm so proud to be an official mentor with The Forum presented by the #ScotiabankWomenInitiative. Have you had the thought: \"I couldn't possibly be a mentor!\"? If so, here is some tough-love (💜 ) and advice (✨ ) that might just be the boost you need to go and share your gold with someone else: 💜 When you don't trust yourself and your experiences so don't share, you risk keeping others from growing. ✨ Try taking it slowly, the next time someone asks a question in a group chat or slack community, share 1 thing that is relevant to the conversation. It doesn't have to blow minds, but you never know who needs to hear what! 💜 Your knowledge is quite unique to you thanks to your personal life, when you doubt your value you're telling other women they should doubt theirs too. ✨ Make a list of topics you love to talk about or have learned about and for each one, write 3 things you learned anecdotally or through reading/podcasts etc. The magic is that these three things will be knowledge no one else has because how we interpret information is also unique to us! 💜 Books, university and business magazines aren't the only way to learn. Your immigration experience, bad break-up, childhood trauma and shitty first part-time job have likely taught you SIGNIFICANTLY more. ✨ Unless you're a brain surgeon or a lawyer...stop judging the 'type' of education you have and instead focus on the lessons you learned in life...because I promise you they are fully transferable and incredibly valuable. Consider this the chat your high-school career councillor never gave you. Keep shining your lights and watch yourself and others grow because of it!! Yours Truly, The Start-Up Anthropologist Teaching you how to absolutely ace this journey called life and business. #selfempowerment #mentorship #theforum\n\n7 Nuggets of Wisdom from a 37 year old :) Starting an entrepreneurial venture The Big Barn Farm and Nature Camp, raising two kids in my 20s, and finding my way in a different city, all while being married—my journey through this vibrant decade has been nothing short of an exhilarating roller-coaster ride. These experiences have shaped me in profound ways and I want to share these heartfelt thoughts with the younger women - 1. Prioritize Your Health 💪🌱 Your well-being is your most valuable asset. Take care of your physical and mental health. Remember, true wealth means little if you're not healthy. 2. Choose Your Inner Circle Thoughtfully 👥❤️ As the renowned author Jim Rohn wisely said, \"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.\" Surround yourself with those who inspire and uplift you, and don't hesitate to distance yourself from toxic influences. 3. Cherish Experiences Over Possessions ✈️🌍 Material things can't match the memories and adventures that life offers. Travel, explore, and embrace new experiences. The stories you collect will be more valuable than any possession. 4. Love the Process, Not Just the Result 🚀❤️ Success is a journey, not a destination. Fall in love with the daily grind, the learning, and the small victories. Enjoy the process, and success will follow. 5. Discover Your Passion and Stay Curious 🔍🚀 Avoid comparing your path to others'. Find what truly fulfills you and follow your passion. 6. Commit to Continuous Learning 📚🧠 Knowledge is a powerful resource that can unlock countless opportunities. Read, learn, and grow. 7. Take Ownership of Your Future 🚀🔑 Your success and happiness are your responsibility. No one will hand them to you. Take consistent, conscious action towards your goals and shape the life you desire. #womeninbusiness #womenentrepreneurs #mothers #womenatwork #womenwhohustle Which of these lessons resonates with you the most?
