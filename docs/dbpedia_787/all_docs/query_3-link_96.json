        "text": "I was dreading the European election results. A centre seems to holding, for now. And with the French Republicans ousting their leader, perhaps there is some hope.\n\nSo I was looking for something… bigger, more uplifting, less political, but more…. What ? Hopeful ?\n\nI chose this –\n\nHow deep is the weather front of time\n\nthat advances, roaring and calm\n\nunendingly between was and will be ?\n\nA millisecond? A few hours ? All secular life\n\nworldwide, all consequences of past life\n\ntravel in it.\n\nfrom The Welter, by Les Murray.\n\nThe Biplane Houses, Poems. Published by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, New York, 2006.\n\nThat being able to capture so much in a few words… it’s not planned, worked-out… can be exciting, thrilling.\n\nAnd, funnily enough, get this: I have long been taught that you must begin with specifics, details, then work towards the bigger picture.\n\nWell, here he does exactly the opposite.\n\nAnd it works !\n\nI am so happy to say, it works !\n\nI always pull against the ‘method’, the preferred style. And so did he.\n\nHere’s to you, Les Murray !\n\nA collection of hand-made pamphlets/chapbooks have come into my hands recently, dating from the mid 1960s to 1970.\n\nSome of these are remarkable.\n\nI have here tantric poems perhaps… by Dom Sylvester Houédard, a Dominican priest and pioneer of typewriter art.\n\nThis collection dates from May 1967, and a second edition from August 1969. It is part of the Writers Forum Folder series, and is volume 2 of that series.\n\nThe contact and production address was given as 262 Randolph Avenue, London, W9.\n\nDom Sylvester was in contact with the Lissom Gallery from its early days, and it remains a main curator of his art.\n\nhttps://www.lissongallery.com\n\ntantric poems perhaps consists of a hard-backed envelope containing pieces of work on different sized cards, and an introductory typed note by Dom Sylvester (spelt Silvester). It is as unique as hand-made art can be.\n\nHaving written that my partner passed to me a site celebrating typewriter art from that period up until now:\n\nhttps://text-mode.org/?tag=typewriter&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email\n\nand it is really quite remarkable what was achieved on, say, an Olivetti (Dom Silvester’s chosen machine) etc.\n\nDom Silvester is acknowledged as a leading theorist of the form. He explored Catholic prayer and contemplation, but also Buddhist meditation and Zen practices. He sought a language for conveying states of being of these practices.\n\nHe was wide ranging, and, as the Lisson Gallery introduction to his work notes, he also was exploring its links to cybernetics and Wittgenstein’s linguistic theory. https://www.lissongallery.com/artists/dom-sylvester-houedard\n\nFor Dom Sylvester, this was not decorative art, or just exploring the possibilities of the medium of the typewriter, but essentially an exploration of communication of experiences, states of being.\n\nHere is a very interesting post and film biopic on Ulrike Meinhof, of the German Baader-Meinhoff Red Army Faction (RAF).\n\nThe film attempts a fuller examination of her life, journalism, and later active involvement, interviewing many who knew her personally in private life, work, and through commitment and action.\n\nhttp://notesfromaroom.com/2024/05/22/to-talk-elsewhere/\n\nAs always with political, social, events there is a lot more unknown than we imagined. In this case it is not just the personal, family details, but also the complex, shifting, and developing situation in the divided Germany of the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThe main catalyst to action was what they (RAF) sarcastically called The Grand Coalition, an unholy government pact between known Nazi and then chancellor, Kiesenger, and avowed anti-Nazi Willy Brandt, Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was as though saying, If this is possible, then there can be no credibility to the government.\n\nWe are shown nothing of the victims or their families, of the RAF attacks.\n\n*\n\nThere is a mystery to her death. Wiki tells us that, contrary to what the film says, a suicide pact was made between Red Army Faction members held in detention.\n\nThey were held in extreme isolation, though, at that time, that is isolated from outside contact, and from contact with each other.\n\nThere is also a suggestion of character-alteration due to physiological causes:\n\nFollowing their apparent suicides, the German government had the brains of Baader, Meinhof, Ensslin and Raspe illegally removed for study at the Neurological Research Institute at the University of Tübingen.[40][41] Meinhof’s brain contained scar tissue, the result of surgery to remove a benign tumor in 1962, that could have affected her behavior.[42]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Baader\n\nThis examining of brains to find reasons for behaviour, attitudes, seems to us now as little more than a modern version of phrenology.\n\nAll this attempting to rationalise her life-trajectory seems to miss the point, somehow. It is as though ‘normal’ people’s life experience does not include crises of conscience, or temperaments that run adversely to a status quo. After all as a woman her default setting would be nurturing, passive. Right ?\n\nThis is probably why there will always be, and always has been, political extremists of all ‘wings’. Is it a temperament one is born with ?\n\nIt’s not a form of determinism, factors can alter one’s directions all the time. There are some periods in a regime’s existence when options are curtailed, however, when ameliorating factors and influences become, perhaps unintentionally, smothered.\n\nThe Notes from a Room blog site is well worth reading, with high quality content and presentation.\n\nhttps://notesfromaroom.com\n\n*\n\nIn the 1980s the painter Gerhard Richter revisited the legacy of Ulrike Meinhof, establishing and situating her images permanently within mainstream German culture\n\nhttps://gerhard-richter.com/en/art/paintings/photo-paintings/baader-meinhof-56\n\nChina’s history, like nearly every history, is littered with ages of chaos interspersed with ‘quieter’ ages. The old ‘Chinese curse’ May you live in ‘interesting times‘ says enough in its condensed few words, to capture an attitude of wry… fortitude ?\n\nBut to be caught up in one of these times, one that dashes, and continues to dash, all hopes for a better future, now that is the hardest.\n\nIn Liu Cixin’s sci-fi novel The Three Body Problem explores the devastating consequences.\n\nHow many died needlessly in the Cultural Revolution?\n\nHow many died on Tiananman Square that night\n\nas we slept safely in our beds ?\n\nThat last detail is one I still find difficult to cope with, we are so used to our rights being observed, here, in the West.\n\nOn the whole we live in caring times, we have rights, and mostly they are not violated, en masse.\n\nThe Palestinian protests have not been smashed by tanks and armoured vehicles.\n\nThere are degrees of violation, of course; most often they have a narrow, domestic, focus.\n\nPersistant, yes, and not (never?) corrected, but our repression has not been on the scale we see elsewhere in the world.\n\nWhat am I getting at ?\n\nTiananmen Square remains\n\na political stain.\n\nUnaddressed. Unredressed.\n\nHttps://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hong-kong-businesses-mark-tiananmen-anniversary-in-face-of-pressures\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-china-57314397\n\nSo, we were watching a film the other niiiight…\n\nand it became so preposterous that we had to leave it.\n\nBUT there were two big ticks in its favour –\n\nthe first was the main character was played by Jessie Buckley, who is always good (what was she doing in this ?)\n\nthe second, the piece of piano music she purportedly played : Chopin, Nocturne Op 9, 2.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Buckley\n\nThe film played with two images, of The Green Man\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man\n\ncombined with a Sheela-na-Gig figure.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheela_na_gig\n\nNeither had been thought through, and used solely for surface effect.\n\nThe Green Man copies the Roman figure of Sylvanus too closely to not be a related memory.\n\nSheela-na-Gig, mostly found on ecclesiastical sites, is surely a warning for celibate priests, of what would await them should they stray.\n\nA Whore of Babylon figure ? Maybe.\n\nBe that as it may, the music in the film’s close domestic setting, was perfect.\n\nI will leave you with that\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg"
