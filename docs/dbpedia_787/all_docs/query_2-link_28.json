        "text": "INSTITUTE OF MODERN LANGUAGES RESEARCH\n\nSchool of Advanced Study | University of London\n\nThe latest in the Institute's series of conversations between authors writing in German and their translators will feature Annett Gröschner and Katy Derbyshire on 30 April, and Dörte Hansen and Anne Stokes on 11 May 2021. Both will take place online.\n\nAnnett Gröschner and Katy Derbyshire\n\nFriday, 30 April 2021, 17:00-18:30 (London time, BST)\n\nThe prolific and wide-ranging output of writer, journalist, academic and performer Annett Gröschner includes two novels, Moskauer Eis [Moscow Ice] (2000) and Walpurgistag [St Walpurga's Day] (2011), as well as volumes of poetry, plays, radio features and documentary literature. Her most recent books are Berolinas zornige Töchter [Berolina's Angry Daughters] (2018), tracing the Berlin women's movement, and Berliner Bürger*stuben (2020), a collection of snapshots and observations of life in Berlin. She has been awarded several prizes, among them - very soon! - the prestigious Fontanepreis (March 2020); she has been part of the performance collective SheShe Pop since 2012, and has held a visiting professorship at the Berlin Universität der Künste since 2015. Annett will be reading from and discussing her most recent work in the context of the changed social landscape under the restrictions imposed by Covid-19.\n\nShe will be joined by translator Katy Derbyshire. Katy translates contemporary German writers, including Annett Gröschner, Olga Grjasnowa, Heike Geissler and Clemens Meyer. She lives in Berlin, where she co-hosts a monthly translation lab and the bimonthly ‘Dead Ladies Show’, presenting women who were wonderful while they were alive. Katy is now also publisher at the V&Q Books imprint, which exports ‘remarkable writing from Germany’ to the UK and Ireland.\n\nParticipation free, but advance registration required at https://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk/events/event/23819\n\nDörte Hansen and Anne Stokes\n\nTuesday, 11 May 2021, 18:00-19:00 (London time, BST)\n\nDörte Hansen, whose novel Altes Land (2015) was voted 'Favourite Book of the Year' by German independent booksellers in the year of its publication, meets Anne Stokes, whose translation of the novel was published by St Martin’s Press under the title This House is Mine (2016) and was long-listed for the 2018 International DUBLIN Literary Award. The novel tackles issues of refuge, home-making and belonging across the past century, focusing on women of several generations, who find refuge in an old farm building in Northern Germany and against the odds make it their home. The event offers an opportunity to listen to author and translator discussing text, context, and translation process ― and to join in their conversation.\n\nDörte Hansen was born in 1964 in Husum and studied linguistics at the Universities of Kiel and Galway. She wrote her dissertation on multilingualism and language contacts at the University of Hamburg and then worked as a writer and editor for radio and the press. Her first novel, Altes Land, published in 2015, has been translated into more than ten languages. Her second book, Mittagsstunde, was published in 2018, to similar acclaim.\n\nAnne Stokes holds a PhD degree in German literature from Ohio State University and a PhD in English literature (creative writing and literary translation) from the University of Glasgow. She co-directs the Translation Studies programmes at the University of Stirling, and translates literary and academic texts from the German, including work by Sarah Kirsch (Ice Roses: Selected Poems [Carcanet, 2014]) and Christian Adam (Lesen Unter Hitler, which will appear later this year as Bestsellers of the Third Reich: Readers, Writers and the Politics of Literature [Berghahn, 2021]).\n\nParticipation free, but advance registration required at https://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk/events/event/23911​\n\nThese conversations are sponsored by the Keith Spalding Trust (University of London, IMLR)\n\nThe series ‘Encounters: Writers and Translators in Conversation’ are organised by the Institute of Modern Languages Research, University of London, in conjunction with the University of Nottingham.
