        "text": "May 2024, Wall Street Journal, Lettie Teague, “Is Vermentino the New Chardonnay?”\n\nMay 2024, Wine Enthusiast, Matt Kettmann, “Golden State Gamay Is Here to Stay”\n\nJanuary 2024, 2022 Sonoma Preview: A First Look\n\nThese are some of the very finest wines I have tasted from Sarah and Chris Pittenger. The 2021 Pinots are brilliant for their aromatic intensity, depth and overall character. One of the distinguishing stylistic choices here is a preference for longer aging in wood for the Pinots, which spend about 17 months in barrel. It’s an approach that seems to work quite well. More than anything else, I was blown away by the balance in the top wines, the Pinots in particular. These wines are richly deserving of broader attention\n\n2021 First Born Pinot Noir, 97 pts\n\nThe 2021 Pinot Noir First Born is a selection of the best barrels in the cellar. Dense, layered, and resonant in th glass, the 2021 impresses with its sublime balance. Vineyard sites are Baranoff, Campbell Ranch, and Marine Layer. In some vintages, the new oak has been a bit much, but backing off to all once-used barrels and no new wood turned out to be a great choice. In a word: fabulous.\n\n2021 Campbell Ranch Pinot Noir, 96 pts\n\nThe 2021 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is another stellar wine in this range. It emerges from a site in Annapolis, in the northern section of the West Sonoma Coast. Red-toned fruit, mint, white flowers and chalk are all finely delineated. This deceptively mid-weight Pinot is bursting with flavor. Drink it over the next decade or so.\n\n2021 Baranoff Pinot Noir, 95+ pts\n\nThe 2021 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is fabulous. In fact, it is one of the most compelling wines I have tasted from Chris and Sarah Pittenger. A rush of blue/purplish fruit, lavender, mocha, spice and gravel soar out of the glass. The mix of Calera, Swan and Dijon clones works so well here. Because of the tiny production, there’s a bit more new oak here than in the other wines, but the balance works. Give the tannis time to soften.\n\neDecember 2023\n\nJames Suckling\n\n2021 First Born Pinot Noir, 95 points\n\nRed plums, orange peel and potpourri followed by kola nuts, sweet squash and cinnamon with hints of mushrooms and wet leaves. Medium-bodied, refreshing acidity with silky tannins. Complex wine layered with spieces and minerality. Wonderful drinkability. Very zesty and piquant, too. Aged for 17 months in once-used barrels. Drink or hold.\n\n2022 Sonoma Coast Fiano, 92 points\n\nMandarin orange, golden apple, saline and seashell. Medium-bodied, crisp acidity. Wonderful drainkability with delightful minerality to it. Very fresh. Drink or hold.\n\nJuly 2023\n\nLisa Perrotti-Brown, The Wine Independent\n\n2021 First Born Pinot Noir, 95 points\n\nPale to medium ruby-purple in color, the 2021 First Born Pinot Noir spills from the glass with fragrant notes of rose oil, fertile loam, and redcurrant preserves giving way to cinnamon toast, star anise, and fallen leaves. The medium-bodied palate is so graceful and soft spoken with loads of fragrant earth and red fruit nuances, supported by plush tannins and lovely tension, leading to a finish of quiet intensity on this beautiful wine.\n\n2021 Campbell Ranch Pinot Noir, 95 points\n\nThe 2021 Campbell Ranch Pinot Noir is pale to medium ruby-purple in color. It needs a little swirling to bring out notes of iron ore, crushed rocks, and fertile loam leading to a core of pomegranate, black raspberries, and kirsch. The light to medium-bodied palate offers wonderful purity with expressive red berry and savory layers and a fine-grained texture, finishing long with a real skip in its step.\n\n2021 Baranoff Pinot Noir, 94 points\n\nPale to medium ruby-purple in color, the 2021 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir charges out with vibrant notes of kirsch, raspberry coulis, and pomegranate with hints of red roses, forest floor, and Sichuan pepper. The medium-bodied palate vibrates with energetic red fruit and earthy accents, with fine-grained tannins and plenty of freshness to support, finishing long and lifted.\n\n2021 Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, 92 points\n\nPale ruby-purple in color, the 2021 Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir leaps from the glass with bold, energetic notes of fresh raspberries, Morello cherries, and mulberries plus hint of lilacs and tilled soil with a touch of moss. The medium-bodied palate is graceful and silky with vivacious red berry layers and a perfumed finish.\n\nSonoma 2021 Preview, January 2023\n\nAntonio Galloni, Vinous\n\nThis is a stellar set of wines from Chris and Sarah Pittenger. I was so impressed with every wine I tasted. The 2021s have that combination of vibrancy and richness that is such a signature of the year. I also found much to admire in the 2020 Pinots, wines from a much more challenging vintage. Chris Pittenger typically employs some whole cluster (10-15%) on the Pinots, but in 2020 he opted to destem all the fruit out of an abundance of caution. Aging is on the longer side; the Pinots spent 16 months in French oak on gross lees. At Gros Ventre, the house style emphasizes freshness but never to the point of being austere or excessively lean, as is sometimes seen on the West Sonoma Coast.\n\n2020 Campbell Ranch Pinot Noir, 94 points\n\nThe 2020 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is a very classy, polished wine. Crushed red berry, mint, chalk, white pepper and crushed rocks give the 2020 notable brilliance and focus. This translucent, nuanced Pinot is an absolute delight. All the elements are so well balanced. The Gros Ventre Campbell Ranch is one of the best wines of this very tricky vintage.\n\n2020 Baranoff Pinot Noir, 93 points\n\nThe 2020 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is a dense, powerful wine that is going to need a number of years to come together. Dark, virile, and imposing, the 202 is a serious, almost somber, wine. Black cherry, leather, licorice, tobacco and cedar add to an impression of muscle and gravitas. The drought and heat of the year are evident. The oak imprint is also stronger than most years, the result of a greater percentage of oak relative to a vintage with low fruit and juice yields.\n\n2020 Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, 93 points\n\nThe 2020 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is a gorgeous appellation-level wine that shows just how compelling this vintage can be. Crushed red berry fruit, spice, mint and blood orange all race across the palate as this nervy, layered Pinot shows off its inimitable class. Vineyard sites are Baranoff and Campbell Ranch. Superb.\n\n2021 High Country Red, 94 points\n\nThe 2021 High Country Red is a blend of Gamay from Rancho Coda and Pinot Noir from Dufranc, a sort of Sonoma Coast version of Passetoutgrains, on a very serious level. Dark, supple, and wonderfully inviting, the High Country Red is an absolutely delight. The purity and depth of the flavors is compelling. Juicy dark cherry, plum, spice, and new leather are all dialed up, with a touch of whole cluster savoriness to balance things out.\n\n2021 Rancho Coda Fiano, 93 points\n\nThe 2021 Fiano Rancho Coda is another gorgeous, classy white from Gros Ventre. Creamy and layered in the glass, the 2021 is laced with orchard fruit, tangerine oil and light tropical notes. The combination of viscous texture and bright acids makes for a compelling wine that is quite frankly irresistible. I loved it.\n\n2021 High Country White, 93 points\n\nThe 2021 High Country White is a blend of 50% Chenin Blanc, plus dollops of Grenache Blanc, Riesling, Fiano and Viognier, all from Sonoma County in this vintage. Rich and textured, the High Country is absolutely gorgeous. Orchard fruit, mint, white flowers and spice all build in a creamy, beautifully layered white that is absolutely irresistible.\n\n2021 Chenin Blanc, 92 points\n\nThe 2021 Chenin Blanc is bright and focused, with a compelling mix of varietal orchard fruit and brighter, more citrusy accents that add brightness. All the elements are so well balanced. The 2021 Chenin is a wine of total class and distinction.Terrific.\n\nClick Here to read whole article and other reviews\n\nClick here to browse available wines from this review\n\nOctober 2022\n\nJames Suckling\n\n2019 Pinot Noir First Born, 95 points\n\nA layered nose with an array of red berries, moss, bark, wet stone, chicory root and a hint of blueberry. Medium-bodied with silky, structured tannins. Vibrant and expressive, with berry fruit and mineral notes blending together beautifully. Complex, but remains approachable and will age wonderfully. Delicious wine. Drink or hold.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 94 points\n\nA rather svelte pinot with black-cherry, leather, bark and sauteed-mushroom character. It’s medium-bodied with ﬁne and polished tannins and a long, ﬂavorful ﬁnish. Some redwood and dried sea wood. Salted caramel, too. Drink now or hold.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 93 points\n\nA rather expressive nose with notes of hibiscus, blueberry, strawberry and wet stone. Medium-bodied with soft, ﬁne tannins. Wet-mineral notes mix with the slightly blue-tinged fruit notes. Moss, too. Lovely mouth-feel. Drink or hold.\n\n2021 Fiano Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nAromatic aromas of chamomile, lily, beeswax and a hint of jasmine. Medium-bodied with a silky-smooth texture. Focused and succinct, while remaining expressive. Refreshing tannins in the ﬁnish. Lovely. Drink now.\n\n2021 Gamay Noir, 92 points\n\nA rather expressive nose with notes of hibiscus, blueberry, strawberry and wet stone. Medium-bodied with soft, ﬁne tannins. Wet-mineral notes mix with the slightly blue-tinged fruit notes. Moss, too. Lovely mouth-feel. Drink or hold.\n\nSpring 2022\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 95 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is fabulous. Complex and multi-dimensional, the 2019 is dynamic and super-expressive. Rose petal, lavender, spice, sage and mint play off a core of dark red/purplish berry fruit. This is a terrific Pinot from the northern part of the West Sonoma Coast.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir First Born is a blend mostly from Campbell and Robbins – Calera, 667 and 777 clones. Racy and exuberant, the First Born is impeccable. There is a bit more ripeness here (but still within the house style) and also a touch more new oak, a combination that works so well. Rose petal, orange peel, spice and a touch of whole cluster savoriness inform this wonderfully expressive Pinot Noir from Gros Ventre.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is a gorgeous appellation-level wine. Effusive and generous, the 2019 is so expressive today. Crushed rose petal, mint, sweet red berry and chalk all meld together. There’s a touch of whole cluster influence, but it is minimal. Give this a year or so to soften.\n\n2019 High Country Red, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 High Country Red is fabulous. Rich and ample yet also light on its feet, the 2019 has so much to offer. In this vintage, a good deal of the Pinot Noir comes from top Sonoma sites (as opposed to El Dorado in the past), and that really seems to have made a big difference. The 2019 is such a gorgeous wine. Bright red berry fruit, orange peel, mint, white pepper and chalk all race out of the glass. The 2019 was done almost entirely with destemmed fruit, but it is quite savory.\n\n2019 Gamay Noir, 91 points\n\nThe 2019 Gamay Noir is bright, effusive and so expressive. Crushed red berry, cinnamon, orange peel, mint, cedar and new leather are all beautifully lifted in the glass. Medium in body, silky and light on its feet, the Gamay Noir a is stellar wine in this range. The 25% whole clusters are very nicely integrated.\n\n2020 Chenin Blanc, 92 points\n\nThe 2020 Chenin Blanc opens with a burst of floral and citrus notes. Readers will find a vibrant, energetic white loaded with personality. All the elements come together nicely. This is an especially floral, savory Chenin.\n\n2020 High Country White, 91 points\n\nThe 2020 White High Country is an intriguing blend of mostly Fiano and Arneis, with complementary dollops of several other white varieties. Orchard fruit, almonds and wild flowers all take shape in the glass. Drink this joyous, delicious white over the next few years.\n\n2020 Vermentino, 90 points\n\nThe 2020 Vermentino is bright, focused and nervy, all qualities that will serve it well over the next few years. This crisp, refreshing Vermentino offers tons of varietal character. Green pear, lime, almond, sage, mint and white pepper linger. There is plenty to like.\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n“I was once again quite impressed with this range from Chris and Sarah Pittenger. The wines are compelling, from the entry-level offerings, all the way up to the top Pinots that comprise the heart of the range. The wines are done in a style that emphasizes vibrancy and transparency. Aging for the Pinots is about 17 months or so, on the longer side for California, mostly neutral oak. Whole cluster influence is light.” – Antonio Galloni\n\n2018 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir First Born, a selection of the best barrels in the cellar, is mostly Campbell and a bit of Baranoff, done with all destemmed fruit. It marries power with translucence beautifully. Darker shades of fruit and a touch of new oak are front and center. This is another fabulous wine in the range.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 93+ points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch has a lot of potential, but readers will have to be patient. A rich, deep wine, the Campbell Ranch is pretty packed in at this stage. Bright red/purplish fruit, orange peel, spice, mint, cedar and sweet pipe tobacco all run through the 2018.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Baranoff, 93 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is fabulous. It captures all the intensity of the Russian River in a mid-weight, translucent style that is quite appealing. Crushed flowers, kirsch, hard candy, raspberry, cinnamon, mint and cedar give the 2018 striking aromatic brilliance. Understated and classy to the core, the 2018 is so inviting today. The 2018 was done with fully destemmed fruit. I would give it a few years to soften. There is a lot of wine here.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is another superb wine in this range. It captures all the exuberance of the year in its forward, boisterous personality. Juicy dark cherry, plum, new leather, licorice and spice are amplified in this creamy, sensual Pinot from Gros Ventre. Vineyard sites are Campbell and Baranoff.\n\n2019 High Country Red El Dorado, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 High Country Red is fabulous. Rich and ample yet also light on its feet, the 2019 has so much to offer. In this vintage, a good deal of the Pinot Noir comes from top Sonoma sites (as opposed to El Dorado in the past), and that really seems to have made a big difference. The 2019 is such a gorgeous wine. Bright red berry fruit, orange peel, mint, white pepper and chalk all race out of the glass. The 2019 was done almost entirely with destemmed fruit, but it is quite savory.\n\nAugust 2020\n\nJeb Dunnuck\n\n2018 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir First Born showed beautifully, with a complex yet elegant style that’s already approachable. Coming from a selection of the best lots and 90% destemmed and aged in 40% new barrels, it offers a great perfume of raspberries, orange blossom, violets, and dried flowers. With medium to full body, beautiful purity of fruit, and integrated acidity, it’s another classy wine from this estate that will impress over the coming 7-8 years or more.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 94 points\n\nFrom a site on the Sonoma Coast, the 2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch was all destemmed and brought up 18 months in 20% new French oak. More strawberries, white flowers, orange blossom, and honeysuckle emerge from this beauty, which is medium to full-bodied and has a rounded, elegant texture, beautiful fruit, good acidity, and a clean, lengthy finish. It’s beautifully done and already drinking great. It should evolve for 5-7 years.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 93 points\n\nFermented with 10% stems and aged 18 months in 15% new French oak, the 2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast has a pretty bouquet of tart cherry and strawberry fruits as well as a distinctly floral character, notes of underbrush and orange blossom, medium to full body, a beautifully pure texture, and a great finish. It’s a richer, powerful Pinot Noir that still stays remarkably elegant and pure, with good acidity, polished tannins, and again, a great finish that keeps you coming back to the glass. It needs air to show at its best and is a beautiful, outstanding 2018 Pinot Noir that will drink well for a solid 8-10 years.\n\nApril 2020\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n“This is a gorgeous set of wines from Chris and Sarah Pittenger. There are a number of fabulous wines in this lineup, but one of the things I find most admirable is how reasonable prices are for what is in the glass. Readers who have not tasted these wines yet owe it themselves to do so.”\n\n2017 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard, 94 points\n\nThe 2017 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard is a fabulous wine. Rich, creamy and expansive, the 2017 possesses tremendous resonance and fruit intensity. Bright red and purplish fruit, lavender, spice, mint and rose petals infuse a racy and exuberant Cerise with real presence and tons of personality. This is a wine of real distinction.\n\n2017 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard, 93 points\n\nThe 2017 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is gorgeous. Bright, tense and beautifully delineated, the 2017 is all about energy. Sweet red and purplish berry fruit, mint, spice, wild flowers and rose petals are all finely sculpted in this very pretty, nuanced Pinot. I would give the 2017 a few years to come together.\n\nThe 2017 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is powerful and dense, with quite a bit of fruit richness. At the same time, the 2018 feels a bit rustic and not particularly well put together, with notes of black cherry, plum, chocolate, licorice and spice. The Campbell Ranch offers quite a bit of weight, but also feels rustic, especially in its tannins.\n\n2018 Gamay Noir, El Dorado, 92 points\n\nThe 2018 Gamay Noir is marked by terrific purity of fruit and striking depth. Sweet red cherry, red plum, tobacco, cedar and anise are nicely pushed forward. The 25% whole clusters and partial carbonic maceration are not especially evident. Instead, it is the wine’s varietal character that is front and center.\n\nClick here to read all the Vinous reviews from this release.\n\nDecember 2019\n\nWine Spectator\n\nSommelier Roundtable: Favorite Pairings for Holiday Roasts and Ham\n\nRyan Bailey, wine director at Best of Award of Excellence winner NoMad Los Angeles\n\nGros Ventre High Country Red 2018 from El Dorado would be ideal for ham. Winemaker Chris Pittenger took inspiration from the classic Burgundy style of Passe-Tout-Grains, blending 55 percent Pinot Noir and 45 percent Gamay to create a wine that is incredibly food-friendly. Ham is savory but kind of sweet at the same time, so a wine that is very versatile is key.\n\nClick Here to read article.\n\nJune 2019\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 95 points\n\nThe 2016 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is a dark, brooding wine. Blue/purplish fruit, lavender and spice notes are pushed forward. There is a good bit of up-front fruit and overall intensity, but the 2016 could use another year or two in bottle to allow the tannins to soften. Even so, this Campbell Ranch is quite attractive. It is also one of the most compelling wines in a superb lineup from Chris Pittenger.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nOne of the stars in this range, the 2016 Pinot Noir First Born is fabulous. Rich, textured and super-expressive, it offers serious depth and yet also stays light on its feet. Black cherry, plum, licorice, lavender, mint and a touch of French oak spiciness all flesh out in this mid-weight, super-expressive Pinot. The new oak (two-thirds) needs time to integrate, but this is a very pretty wine.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Cerise, 93 points\n\nThe 2016 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard is a gorgeous, translucent wine. Deceptively medium-bodied, it is wonderfully nuanced and complex. Rose petal, mint, crushed flowers and earth add shades of nuance to the bright red/purplish berry fruit.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Baranoff, 92 points\n\nThe 2016 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is bright and lifted and features a distinctive red-fruit character. Sweet cherry, pomegranate, mint and blood orange all develop in this pretty, gracious Pinot Noir, which is one of the more easygoing wines in the range.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nThe 2016 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is a gorgeous, super-expressive appellation-level wine. Succulent dark cherry, lavender, rose petal, mint and spice all run through this medium-bodied and supremely gracious Pinot. A subtle touch (10%) of whole clusters adds aromatic nuance to an inviting, beautifully layered wine.\n\n2016 El Dorado Gamay Noir, 91 points\n\nDespite its mid-weight structure, the 2016 Gamay Noir is bright, punchy and bursting at the seams with flavor intensity. Silky on the palate, with expressive, perfumed aromatics, the Gamay Noir is a winner from Gros Ventre.\n\n2017 High Country White, 91 points\n\nThe 2017 High Country White, Gros Ventre’s white blend, is gorgeous. Almond, dried pear, mint, sage and dried flowers are all nicely layered throughout. The blend is 38% Sauvignon Blanc, 28% Chenin, 12% Vermentino, 11% Fiano, 11% Picpoul, with the Chenin especially notable.\n\nApril 2019\n\nApril 2019\n\nWine & Spirits, Year’s Best Pinot Noirs\n\nOctober 2018\n\nWine & Spirits, 2018 Winery to Watch\n\nHere are some of the new producers we discovered in our tastings in 2018, as well as a few established growers who surprised us with their latest releases. Watch for these 14 names in the year ahead.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nGros Ventre\n\nChris Pittenger recently left Skinner, where his Sierra Foothills Mourvedres earned him a place on our cover last February. He’s now devoted himself fulltime to the winery he founded in 2009. Look for his 2016 El Dorado County High Country Red, a blend of cherry blossom–scented pinot and the pomegranate flavors of El Dorado gamay, aged in neutral French oak, powerful and impressively structured. —J.G.\n\nNovember 2018\n\nJames Suckling\n\n2016 Pinot Noir First Born, 95 points\n\nDark color and dark fruit with assertive, toasty-oak influence, all making for a heroic impression on the nose with roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The palate has immense power and depth with dark chocolate-coated kirsch flavor, raspberry coulis and very plush, powerful, long tannins. Bold style. Give this some time. Try from 2022.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 93 points\n\nWild raspberries and red cherries, delivered amid woody, savory aromas in\n\nfresh mode. The palate has a neat, plush array of fine tannins that carry lithe and juicy, darker-cherry flavor in velvety, plush style to close. Drink or hold.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 93 points\n\nThis has a vibrant array of ripe dark berries and cherries with ample structure and depth on the palate, delivering ripe, velvety-fruit presence with strong yet elegant, darker cherry flavors. Drink or hold.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard, 92 points\n\nWild herbs, violets and sous-bois notes with small red fruit and a spicy,\n\nsaffron-scented edge to the nose. The palate has a fresh and quite crunchy\n\ntexture with crisp, bright, red-fruit flavors. Drink or hold.\n\nJuly 2018\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n2015 Pinot Noir First Born, 95 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir First Born, a blend of six barrels from two coastal sites, is a total knock-out. Dense, powerful and super-concentrated, the 2015 possesses remarkable purity from start to finish. A rush of sweet red cherry, plum, rose petal, spice and licorice notes build in the glass, but it is the wine’s overall balance that really stands out. The First Born is unquestionably a big wine, but all of the elements are in the right place.\n\n2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast), 94 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is flat-out gorgeous. Bright red cherry and raspberry fruit pulse with energy from beams of supporting acids that give the wine its shape. Readers should do whatever they can to taste the Sonoma Coast Pinot in 2015, as it is exuberant and also a huge overachiever. Vineyards are Campbell Ranch, Baranoff and a third parcel that can’t be disclosed. The combination of sites works beautifully, that much is obvious.\n\n2015 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard, 93 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is a very pretty, gracious wine. Sweet red cherry, star anise, orange peel and cinnamon give the Baranoff Vineyard much of its distinctive, exotic flavor profile. Pliant, resonant and expressive, the 2015 has quite a bit to offer. The new oak is a bit prominent, but that is a rather small critique for a wine that delivers so much pure pleasure.\n\n2015 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch Vineyard, 93 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch Vineyard is a powerful, super-concentrated wine with an unusual level of density for Gros Ventre. Then again, that is one of the signatures in so many 2015 Pinots. Black cherry, leather, menthol and spice flavors are all given an extra kick of intensity in a Pinot that is powerful, unctuous and brooding. I would give it a few years to fully come together.\n\n2015 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard, 93 points\n\nGros Ventre’s 2015 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard is bright, floral and very nicely lifted. Sweet red cherry, raspberries, rose petal, cinnamon and mint infuse the Cerise with real character. There is a sense of energy to the 2015 that is compelling. The Cerise is not an especially obvious wine, but it is very pretty and full of allure. The 15% whole clusters are very nicely integrated. Sadly, yields are down a punishing 40%.\n\n2016 Gamay Noir, 91 points\n\nDespite its mid-weight structure, the 2016 Gamay Noir is bright, punchy and bursting at the seams with flavor intensity. Silky on the palate, with expressive, perfumed aromatics, the Gamay Noir is a winner from Gros Ventre.\n\n2016 High Country White, 90 points\n\nGros Ventre’s 2016 High Country White is a blend of Chenin Blanc, Vementino, Sémillon, Muscat and Picpoul. On the palate, the Country White is surprisingly pliant and deep, with real persistence that gives the wine its shape. Melon and white flower overtones add shades of complexity. This is a very pretty wine.\n\nJune 2018\n\nSunset Magazine\n\n“Western Unions”, Recommended Pairings, Gros Ventre High Country Red\n\n“Enter Passetoutgrains, a Burgundian style of red that’s a blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay. While the former lends structure, acidity, and a savory side, the latter is fruit-forward and earthy. One of the only domestic wineries to make a Passetoutgrain is the husband-and-wife team behind Gros Ventre cellars, which bottles it in a way-too-easy-to-drink Gros Ventre High Country Red 2016.”\n\nApril 2018\n\nThe Wine Advocate, Lisa Perrotti-Brown\n\n2015 First Born Pinot noir 95+ points\n\nPale to medium ruby-purple in color, the 2015 Pinot Noir First Born has pronounced notes of crushed black cherries, fresh raspberries and pomegranate with touches of roses, menthol, black soil and fungi. Medium-bodied and delicately crafted with a firm frame of very ripe, very fine-grained tannins and seamless freshness, the red fruit and earthy layers give way to a good, long, perfumed finish. 118 cases produced.\n\n2015 Baranoff Pinot noir 95+ points\n\nThe pale ruby-purple colored 2015 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard has a delicate nose of red currant jelly, rhubarb pie and wild strawberries with touches of potpourri, baking spices and forest floor. Medium-bodied with a firm frame of grainy tannins and just enough freshness, the tightly wound red fruit gives up loads of earth, floral and spicy layers with a very long finish.\n\n2015 Campbell Ranch Pinot noir 94 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch Vineyard is pale to medium ruby-purple in color with fragrant notes of pomegranate, kirsch and violets with suggestions of cinnamon stick, milk chocolate and garrigue. Medium-bodied, plush and lively in the mouth, it features beautifully perfumed red fruit and a wonderfully spicy finish. 121 cases produced.\n\n2015 Sonoma Coast Pinot noir 91 points\n\nPale to medium ruby-purple colored, the 2015 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast is intensely scented of crushed wild strawberries, Bing cherries and rose petals with touches of wild thyme and black tea. Light to medium-bodied, very elegant and yet with great intensity and expression, it has soft, silken tannins and plenty of freshness, finishing long and perfumed. 179 cases produced.\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nWine & Spirits\n\nThe Future Is Mourvedre in the Sierra Foothills Cover article by Luke Sykora\n\nCheck out Chris on the cover of Wine & Spirits for the work he does for Skinner Vineyards, in this in-depth article on Mourvedre in the Sierra Foothills featuring Chris, Hardy Wallace, and several other local visionaries.

When I met him, he glossed over the details on his conversion to winemaking, but I can totally understand the desire to see how wine is made once you’ve been working on the other side. He’s done harvests with winemakers from all over—New Zealand, Australia, California… This was the wine that stole the show for me at the West of West tasting a couple of years ago. It was as if all of the Pinots in the room had put their best qualities into this one bottle. It screams for duck. Pinot and duck: That’s classic for a reason. It’s also great with beluga lentils, which are these kind of rich, brown lentils that absorb so much flavor.”\n\nRead the Article\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nLoam Baby, Sonoma Coast Issue\n\n“8 Days a Week,” by RH Drexel (Vinous)\n\n“If you have all but given up on American pinot noir, well then, you haven’t been looking hard enough.

Gros Ventre taste plates present a foraged collection of literal descriptors – raspberries, mushrooms, and dried herbs, for example – meant to capture the aroma and flavor profile of a particular Pinot Noir via a photograph. The effect is a photographic expression of a tasting note for their wine. The advantage of the Pittengers’ taste plates rests in their immediacy.”\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nThe Flavor of Cool: Tasting the Wines of the Western Sonoma Coast\n\nBy Alder Yarrow, Vinography\n\n“If you haven’t had many of these wines, I highly encourage you to seek them out”\n\n2013 Gros Ventre Cellars “First Born” Pinot Noir, Sonoma Coast $60 (9 – 9.5)\n\nLight to medium garnet in the glass, this wine smells of smoky, even meaty raspberry and cherry fruit.

The wine is moderate to heavy with rich texture and tannins, which makes the wine drinkable now with aeration, but undoubtedly will improve after a few more years in the bottle.

I was so impressed with every wine I tasted. The 2021s have that combination of vibrancy and richness that is such a signature of the year. I also found much to admire in the 2020 Pinots, wines from a much more challenging vintage. Chris Pittenger typically employs some whole cluster (10-15%) on the Pinots, but in 2020 he opted to destem all the fruit out of an abundance of caution. Aging is on the longer side; the Pinots spent 16 months in French oak on gross lees. At Gros Ventre, the house style emphasizes freshness but never to the point of being austere or excessively lean, as is sometimes seen on the West Sonoma Coast.\n\n2020 Campbell Ranch Pinot Noir, 94 points\n\nThe 2020 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is a very classy, polished wine. Crushed red berry, mint, chalk, white pepper and crushed rocks give the 2020 notable brilliance and focus. This translucent, nuanced Pinot is an absolute delight. All the elements are so well balanced. The Gros Ventre Campbell Ranch is one of the best wines of this very tricky vintage.\n\n2020 Baranoff Pinot Noir, 93 points\n\nThe 2020 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is a dense, powerful wine that is going to need a number of years to come together. Dark, virile, and imposing, the 2021 is a serious, almost somber, wine. Black cherry, leather, licorice, tobacco and cedar add to an impression of muscle and gravitas. The drought and heat of the year are evident. The oak imprint is also stronger than most years, the result of a greater percentage of oak relative to a vintage with low fruit and juice yields.\n\n2020 Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, 93 points\n\nThe 2020 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is a gorgeous appellation-level wine that shows just how compelling this vintage can be. Crushed red berry fruit, spice, mint and blood orange all race across the palate as this nervy, layered Pinot shows off its inimitable class. Vineyard sites are Baranoff and Campbell Ranch. Superb.\n\n2021 High Country Red, 94 points\n\nThe 2021 High Country Red is a blend of Gamay from Rancho Coda and Pinot Noir from Dufranc, a sort of Sonoma Coast version of Passetoutgrains, on a very serious level. Dark, supple, and wonderfully inviting, the High Country Red is an absolutely delight. The purity and depth of the flavors is compelling. Juicy dark cherry, plum, spice, and new leather are all dialed up, with a touch of whole cluster savoriness to balance things out.\n\n2021 Rancho Coda Fiano, 93 points\n\nThe 2021 Fiano Rancho Coda is another gorgeous, classy white from Gros Ventre. Creamy and layered in the glass, the 2021 is laced with orchard fruit, tangerine oil and light tropical notes. The combination of viscous texture and bright acids makes for a compelling wine that is quite frankly irresistible. I loved it.\n\nThe 2021 Chenin Blanc is bright and focused, with a compelling mix of varietal orchard fruit and brighter, more citrusy accents that add brightness. All the elements are so well balanced. The 2021 Chenin is a wine of total class and distinction.Terrific.\n\nClick Here to read whole article and other reviews\n\nClick here to browse available wines from this review\n\nOctober 2022\n\nJames Suckling\n\n2019 Pinot Noir First Born, 95 points\n\nA layered nose with an array of red berries, moss, bark, wet stone, chicory root and a hint of blueberry. Medium-bodied with silky, structured tannins. Vibrant and expressive, with berry fruit and mineral notes blending together beautifully. Complex, but remains approachable and will age wonderfully. Delicious wine. Drink or hold.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 94 points\n\nA rather svelte pinot with black-cherry, leather, bark and sauteed-mushroom character. It’s medium-bodied with ﬁne and polished tannins and a long, ﬂavorful ﬁnish. Some redwood and dried sea wood. Salted caramel, too. Drink now or hold.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 93 points\n\nA rather expressive nose with notes of hibiscus, blueberry, strawberry and wet stone. Medium-bodied with soft, ﬁne tannins. Wet-mineral notes mix with the slightly blue-tinged fruit notes. Moss, too. Lovely mouth-feel. Drink or hold.\n\n2021 Fiano Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nAromatic aromas of chamomile, lily, beeswax and a hint of jasmine. Medium-bodied with a silky-smooth texture. Focused and succinct, while remaining expressive. Refreshing tannins in the ﬁnish. Lovely. Drink now.\n\n2021 Gamay Noir, 92 points\n\nA rather expressive nose with notes of hibiscus, blueberry, strawberry and wet stone. Medium-bodied with soft, ﬁne tannins. Wet-mineral notes mix with the slightly blue-tinged fruit notes. Moss, too. Lovely mouth-feel. Drink or hold.\n\nSpring 2022\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 95 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is fabulous. Complex and multi-dimensional, the 2019 is dynamic and super-expressive. Rose petal, lavender, spice, sage and mint play off a core of dark red/purplish berry fruit. This is a terrific Pinot from the northern part of the West Sonoma Coast.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir First Born is a blend mostly from Campbell and Robbins – Calera, 667 and 777 clones. Racy and exuberant, the First Born is impeccable. There is a bit more ripeness here (but still within the house style) and also a touch more new oak, a combination that works so well. Rose petal, orange peel, spice and a touch of whole cluster savoriness inform this wonderfully expressive Pinot Noir from Gros Ventre.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is a gorgeous appellation-level wine. Effusive and generous, the 2019 is so expressive today. Crushed rose petal, mint, sweet red berry and chalk all meld together. There’s a touch of whole cluster influence, but it is minimal. Give this a year or so to soften.\n\n2019 High Country Red, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 High Country Red is fabulous. Rich and ample yet also light on its feet, the 2019 has so much to offer. In this vintage, a good deal of the Pinot Noir comes from top Sonoma sites (as opposed to El Dorado in the past), and that really seems to have made a big difference. The 2019 is such a gorgeous wine. Bright red berry fruit, orange peel, mint, white pepper and chalk all race out of the glass. The 2019 was done almost entirely with destemmed fruit, but it is quite savory.\n\n2019 Gamay Noir, 91 points\n\nThe 2019 Gamay Noir is bright, effusive and so expressive. Crushed red berry, cinnamon, orange peel, mint, cedar and new leather are all beautifully lifted in the glass. Medium in body, silky and light on its feet, the Gamay Noir a is stellar wine in this range. The 25% whole clusters are very nicely integrated.\n\n2020 Chenin Blanc, 92 points\n\nThe 2020 Chenin Blanc opens with a burst of floral and citrus notes. Readers will find a vibrant, energetic white loaded with personality. All the elements come together nicely. This is an especially floral, savory Chenin.\n\n2020 High Country White, 91 points\n\nThe 2020 White High Country is an intriguing blend of mostly Fiano and Arneis, with complementary dollops of several other white varieties. Orchard fruit, almonds and wild flowers all take shape in the glass. Drink this joyous, delicious white over the next few years.\n\n2020 Vermentino, 90 points\n\nThe 2020 Vermentino is bright, focused and nervy, all qualities that will serve it well over the next few years. This crisp, refreshing Vermentino offers tons of varietal character. Green pear, lime, almond, sage, mint and white pepper linger. There is plenty to like.\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n“I was once again quite impressed with this range from Chris and Sarah Pittenger. The wines are compelling, from the entry-level offerings, all the way up to the top Pinots that comprise the heart of the range. The wines are done in a style that emphasizes vibrancy and transparency. Aging for the Pinots is about 17 months or so, on the longer side for California, mostly neutral oak. Whole cluster influence is light.” – Antonio Galloni\n\n2018 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir First Born, a selection of the best barrels in the cellar, is mostly Campbell and a bit of Baranoff, done with all destemmed fruit. It marries power with translucence beautifully. Darker shades of fruit and a touch of new oak are front and center. This is another fabulous wine in the range.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 93+ points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch has a lot of potential, but readers will have to be patient. A rich, deep wine, the Campbell Ranch is pretty packed in at this stage. Bright red/purplish fruit, orange peel, spice, mint, cedar and sweet pipe tobacco all run through the 2018.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Baranoff, 93 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is fabulous. It captures all the intensity of the Russian River in a mid-weight, translucent style that is quite appealing. Crushed flowers, kirsch, hard candy, raspberry, cinnamon, mint and cedar give the 2018 striking aromatic brilliance. Understated and classy to the core, the 2018 is so inviting today. The 2018 was done with fully destemmed fruit. I would give it a few years to soften. There is a lot of wine here.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is another superb wine in this range. It captures all the exuberance of the year in its forward, boisterous personality. Juicy dark cherry, plum, new leather, licorice and spice are amplified in this creamy, sensual Pinot from Gros Ventre. Vineyard sites are Campbell and Baranoff.\n\n2019 High Country Red El Dorado, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 High Country Red is fabulous. Rich and ample yet also light on its feet, the 2019 has so much to offer. In this vintage, a good deal of the Pinot Noir comes from top Sonoma sites (as opposed to El Dorado in the past), and that really seems to have made a big difference. The 2019 is such a gorgeous wine. Bright red berry fruit, orange peel, mint, white pepper and chalk all race out of the glass. The 2019 was done almost entirely with destemmed fruit, but it is quite savory.\n\nAugust 2020\n\nJeb Dunnuck\n\n2018 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir First Born showed beautifully, with a complex yet elegant style that’s already approachable. Coming from a selection of the best lots and 90% destemmed and aged in 40% new barrels, it offers a great perfume of raspberries, orange blossom, violets, and dried flowers. With medium to full body, beautiful purity of fruit, and integrated acidity, it’s another classy wine from this estate that will impress over the coming 7-8 years or more.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 94 points\n\nFrom a site on the Sonoma Coast, the 2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch was all destemmed and brought up 18 months in 20% new French oak. More strawberries, white flowers, orange blossom, and honeysuckle emerge from this beauty, which is medium to full-bodied and has a rounded, elegant texture, beautiful fruit, good acidity, and a clean, lengthy finish. It’s beautifully done and already drinking great. It should evolve for 5-7 years.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 93 points\n\nFermented with 10% stems and aged 18 months in 15% new French oak, the 2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast has a pretty bouquet of tart cherry and strawberry fruits as well as a distinctly floral character, notes of underbrush and orange blossom, medium to full body, a beautifully pure texture, and a great finish. It’s a richer, powerful Pinot Noir that still stays remarkably elegant and pure, with good acidity, polished tannins, and again, a great finish that keeps you coming back to the glass. It needs air to show at its best and is a beautiful, outstanding 2018 Pinot Noir that will drink well for a solid 8-10 years.\n\nApril 2020\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n“This is a gorgeous set of wines from Chris and Sarah Pittenger. There are a number of fabulous wines in this lineup, but one of the things I find most admirable is how reasonable prices are for what is in the glass. Readers who have not tasted these wines yet owe it themselves to do so.”\n\n2017 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard, 94 points\n\nThe 2017 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard is a fabulous wine. Rich, creamy and expansive, the 2017 possesses tremendous resonance and fruit intensity. Bright red and purplish fruit, lavender, spice, mint and rose petals infuse a racy and exuberant Cerise with real presence and tons of personality. This is a wine of real distinction.\n\n2017 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard, 93 points\n\nThe 2017 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is gorgeous. Bright, tense and beautifully delineated, the 2017 is all about energy. Sweet red and purplish berry fruit, mint, spice, wild flowers and rose petals are all finely sculpted in this very pretty, nuanced Pinot. I would give the 2017 a few years to come together.\n\nThe 2017 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is powerful and dense, with quite a bit of fruit richness. At the same time, the 2018 feels a bit rustic and not particularly well put together, with notes of black cherry, plum, chocolate, licorice and spice. The Campbell Ranch offers quite a bit of weight, but also feels rustic, especially in its tannins.\n\n2018 Gamay Noir, El Dorado, 92 points\n\nThe 2018 Gamay Noir is marked by terrific purity of fruit and striking depth. Sweet red cherry, red plum, tobacco, cedar and anise are nicely pushed forward. The 25% whole clusters and partial carbonic maceration are not especially evident. Instead, it is the wine’s varietal character that is front and center.\n\nClick here to read all the Vinous reviews from this release.\n\nDecember 2019\n\nWine Spectator\n\nSommelier Roundtable: Favorite Pairings for Holiday Roasts and Ham\n\nRyan Bailey, wine director at Best of Award of Excellence winner NoMad Los Angeles\n\nGros Ventre High Country Red 2018 from El Dorado would be ideal for ham. Winemaker Chris Pittenger took inspiration from the classic Burgundy style of Passe-Tout-Grains, blending 55 percent Pinot Noir and 45 percent Gamay to create a wine that is incredibly food-friendly. Ham is savory but kind of sweet at the same time, so a wine that is very versatile is key.\n\nClick Here to read article.\n\nJune 2019\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 95 points\n\nThe 2016 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is a dark, brooding wine. Blue/purplish fruit, lavender and spice notes are pushed forward. There is a good bit of up-front fruit and overall intensity, but the 2016 could use another year or two in bottle to allow the tannins to soften. Even so, this Campbell Ranch is quite attractive. It is also one of the most compelling wines in a superb lineup from Chris Pittenger.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nOne of the stars in this range, the 2016 Pinot Noir First Born is fabulous. Rich, textured and super-expressive, it offers serious depth and yet also stays light on its feet. Black cherry, plum, licorice, lavender, mint and a touch of French oak spiciness all flesh out in this mid-weight, super-expressive Pinot. The new oak (two-thirds) needs time to integrate, but this is a very pretty wine.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Cerise, 93 points\n\nThe 2016 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard is a gorgeous, translucent wine. Deceptively medium-bodied, it is wonderfully nuanced and complex. Rose petal, mint, crushed flowers and earth add shades of nuance to the bright red/purplish berry fruit.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Baranoff, 92 points\n\nThe 2016 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is bright and lifted and features a distinctive red-fruit character. Sweet cherry, pomegranate, mint and blood orange all develop in this pretty, gracious Pinot Noir, which is one of the more easygoing wines in the range.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nThe 2016 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is a gorgeous, super-expressive appellation-level wine. Succulent dark cherry, lavender, rose petal, mint and spice all run through this medium-bodied and supremely gracious Pinot. A subtle touch (10%) of whole clusters adds aromatic nuance to an inviting, beautifully layered wine.\n\n2016 El Dorado Gamay Noir, 91 points\n\nDespite its mid-weight structure, the 2016 Gamay Noir is bright, punchy and bursting at the seams with flavor intensity. Silky on the palate, with expressive, perfumed aromatics, the Gamay Noir is a winner from Gros Ventre.\n\n2017 High Country White, 91 points\n\nThe 2017 High Country White, Gros Ventre’s white blend, is gorgeous. Almond, dried pear, mint, sage and dried flowers are all nicely layered throughout. The blend is 38% Sauvignon Blanc, 28% Chenin, 12% Vermentino, 11% Fiano, 11% Picpoul, with the Chenin especially notable.\n\nApril 2019\n\nApril 2019\n\nWine & Spirits, Year’s Best Pinot Noirs\n\nOctober 2018\n\nWine & Spirits, 2018 Winery to Watch\n\nHere are some of the new producers we discovered in our tastings in 2018, as well as a few established growers who surprised us with their latest releases. Watch for these 14 names in the year ahead.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nGros Ventre\n\nChris Pittenger recently left Skinner, where his Sierra Foothills Mourvedres earned him a place on our cover last February. He’s now devoted himself fulltime to the winery he founded in 2009. Look for his 2016 El Dorado County High Country Red, a blend of cherry blossom–scented pinot and the pomegranate flavors of El Dorado gamay, aged in neutral French oak, powerful and impressively structured. —J.G.\n\nNovember 2018\n\nJames Suckling\n\n2016 Pinot Noir First Born, 95 points\n\nDark color and dark fruit with assertive, toasty-oak influence, all making for a heroic impression on the nose with roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The palate has immense power and depth with dark chocolate-coated kirsch flavor, raspberry coulis and very plush, powerful, long tannins. Bold style. Give this some time. Try from 2022.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 93 points\n\nWild raspberries and red cherries, delivered amid woody, savory aromas in\n\nfresh mode. The palate has a neat, plush array of fine tannins that carry lithe and juicy, darker-cherry flavor in velvety, plush style to close. Drink or hold.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 93 points\n\nThis has a vibrant array of ripe dark berries and cherries with ample structure and depth on the palate, delivering ripe, velvety-fruit presence with strong yet elegant, darker cherry flavors. Drink or hold.\n\n2016 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard, 92 points\n\nWild herbs, violets and sous-bois notes with small red fruit and a spicy,\n\nsaffron-scented edge to the nose. The palate has a fresh and quite crunchy\n\ntexture with crisp, bright, red-fruit flavors. Drink or hold.\n\nJuly 2018\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n2015 Pinot Noir First Born, 95 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir First Born, a blend of six barrels from two coastal sites, is a total knock-out. Dense, powerful and super-concentrated, the 2015 possesses remarkable purity from start to finish. A rush of sweet red cherry, plum, rose petal, spice and licorice notes build in the glass, but it is the wine’s overall balance that really stands out. The First Born is unquestionably a big wine, but all of the elements are in the right place.\n\n2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast), 94 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is flat-out gorgeous. Bright red cherry and raspberry fruit pulse with energy from beams of supporting acids that give the wine its shape. Readers should do whatever they can to taste the Sonoma Coast Pinot in 2015, as it is exuberant and also a huge overachiever. Vineyards are Campbell Ranch, Baranoff and a third parcel that can’t be disclosed. The combination of sites works beautifully, that much is obvious.\n\n2015 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard, 93 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is a very pretty, gracious wine. Sweet red cherry, star anise, orange peel and cinnamon give the Baranoff Vineyard much of its distinctive, exotic flavor profile. Pliant, resonant and expressive, the 2015 has quite a bit to offer. The new oak is a bit prominent, but that is a rather small critique for a wine that delivers so much pure pleasure.\n\n2015 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch Vineyard, 93 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch Vineyard is a powerful, super-concentrated wine with an unusual level of density for Gros Ventre. Then again, that is one of the signatures in so many 2015 Pinots. Black cherry, leather, menthol and spice flavors are all given an extra kick of intensity in a Pinot that is powerful, unctuous and brooding. I would give it a few years to fully come together.\n\n2015 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard, 93 points\n\nGros Ventre’s 2015 Pinot Noir Cerise Vineyard is bright, floral and very nicely lifted. Sweet red cherry, raspberries, rose petal, cinnamon and mint infuse the Cerise with real character. There is a sense of energy to the 2015 that is compelling. The Cerise is not an especially obvious wine, but it is very pretty and full of allure. The 15% whole clusters are very nicely integrated. Sadly, yields are down a punishing 40%.\n\n2016 Gamay Noir, 91 points\n\nDespite its mid-weight structure, the 2016 Gamay Noir is bright, punchy and bursting at the seams with flavor intensity. Silky on the palate, with expressive, perfumed aromatics, the Gamay Noir is a winner from Gros Ventre.\n\n2016 High Country White, 90 points\n\nGros Ventre’s 2016 High Country White is a blend of Chenin Blanc, Vementino, Sémillon, Muscat and Picpoul. On the palate, the Country White is surprisingly pliant and deep, with real persistence that gives the wine its shape. Melon and white flower overtones add shades of complexity. This is a very pretty wine.\n\nJune 2018\n\nSunset Magazine\n\n“Western Unions”, Recommended Pairings, Gros Ventre High Country Red\n\n“Enter Passetoutgrains, a Burgundian style of red that’s a blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay. While the former lends structure, acidity, and a savory side, the latter is fruit-forward and earthy. One of the only domestic wineries to make a Passetoutgrain is the husband-and-wife team behind Gros Ventre cellars, which bottles it in a way-too-easy-to-drink Gros Ventre High Country Red 2016.”\n\nApril 2018\n\nThe Wine Advocate, Lisa Perrotti-Brown\n\n2015 First Born Pinot noir 95+ points\n\nPale to medium ruby-purple in color, the 2015 Pinot Noir First Born has pronounced notes of crushed black cherries, fresh raspberries and pomegranate with touches of roses, menthol, black soil and fungi. Medium-bodied and delicately crafted with a firm frame of very ripe, very fine-grained tannins and seamless freshness, the red fruit and earthy layers give way to a good, long, perfumed finish. 118 cases produced.\n\n2015 Baranoff Pinot noir 95+ points\n\nThe pale ruby-purple colored 2015 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard has a delicate nose of red currant jelly, rhubarb pie and wild strawberries with touches of potpourri, baking spices and forest floor. Medium-bodied with a firm frame of grainy tannins and just enough freshness, the tightly wound red fruit gives up loads of earth, floral and spicy layers with a very long finish.\n\n2015 Campbell Ranch Pinot noir 94 points\n\nThe 2015 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch Vineyard is pale to medium ruby-purple in color with fragrant notes of pomegranate, kirsch and violets with suggestions of cinnamon stick, milk chocolate and garrigue. Medium-bodied, plush and lively in the mouth, it features beautifully perfumed red fruit and a wonderfully spicy finish. 121 cases produced.\n\n2015 Sonoma Coast Pinot noir 91 points\n\nPale to medium ruby-purple colored, the 2015 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast is intensely scented of crushed wild strawberries, Bing cherries and rose petals with touches of wild thyme and black tea. Light to medium-bodied, very elegant and yet with great intensity and expression, it has soft, silken tannins and plenty of freshness, finishing long and perfumed. 179 cases produced.\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nWine & Spirits\n\nThe Future Is Mourvedre in the Sierra Foothills Cover article by Luke Sykora\n\nCheck out Chris on the cover of Wine & Spirits for the work he does for Skinner Vineyards, in this in-depth article on Mourvedre in the Sierra Foothills featuring Chris, Hardy Wallace, and several other local visionaries.

When I met him, he glossed over the details on his conversion to winemaking, but I can totally understand the desire to see how wine is made once you’ve been working on the other side. He’s done harvests with winemakers from all over—New Zealand, Australia, California… This was the wine that stole the show for me at the West of West tasting a couple of years ago. It was as if all of the Pinots in the room had put their best qualities into this one bottle. It screams for duck. Pinot and duck: That’s classic for a reason. It’s also great with beluga lentils, which are these kind of rich, brown lentils that absorb so much flavor.”\n\nRead the Article\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nLoam Baby, Sonoma Coast Issue\n\n“8 Days a Week,” by RH Drexel (Vinous)\n\n“If you have all but given up on American pinot noir, well then, you haven’t been looking hard enough.

Gros Ventre taste plates present a foraged collection of literal descriptors – raspberries, mushrooms, and dried herbs, for example – meant to capture the aroma and flavor profile of a particular Pinot Noir via a photograph. The effect is a photographic expression of a tasting note for their wine. The advantage of the Pittengers’ taste plates rests in their immediacy.”\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nThe Flavor of Cool: Tasting the Wines of the Western Sonoma Coast\n\nBy Alder Yarrow, Vinography\n\n“If you haven’t had many of these wines, I highly encourage you to seek them out”\n\n2013 Gros Ventre Cellars “First Born” Pinot Noir, Sonoma Coast $60 (9 – 9.5)\n\nLight to medium garnet in the glass, this wine smells of smoky, even meaty raspberry and cherry fruit. In the mouth cherry and orange peel flavors take on a tangy sour cherry note as they head towards the finish. Muscular tannins have a very fine grain, so the palate doesn’t object to their firm grip.

The winery is off to a smart beginning.”\n\n2009 Gros Ventre Baranoff Vineyard Russian River Valley Pinot Noir\n\n14.4% alc., 50 cases, $44. From a 3-acre vineyard in the heart of Sebastopol. This wine is a blend of the 7 Pinot Noir clones on the site: Calera, Swan, 113, 115, 459, 667 and 777. The clones were co-fermented and aged together on their lees. Unfined and unfiltered. • Moderately dark reddish-purple color in the glass. Aromas of dark red berries and black cherries with a hint of baking spices, oak and lavender. Even with decanting the wine is a bit closed, but opens some in the glass over time. Crisp and vivid core of Bing cherry and strawberry fruit with a swirl of cola and oak. Medium weighted with nice balance and finesse, and offering a lengthy finish. Drank beautifully two days later from a previously opened and re-corked bottle. No hurry on this one. Very good. Reviewed July 1, 2011 ARTICLE »\n\n2009 Gros Ventre Cerise Vineyard Anderson Valley Pinot Noir\n\n14.0% alc., 151 cases, $44. A combination of Pommard 5 (one-third) and 2A (two-thirds) clones from this steeply sloped vineyard overlooking the Anderson Valley. Unfined and unfiltered. • Moderately dark garnet color in the glass. Brooding black fruits with a hint of sweet oak on the nose which opens slowly in the glass. Delicious core of perfectly ripe and well-bred black and purple Pinot fruits. A little savory, spicy and earthy. Ideal weight, balance and flavor intensity with a generous finish marked by brisk acidity. A complete wine that shows breeding. Decant if you open a bottle now, but patience will bring further rewards. Reviewed July 1, 2011\n\n2009 Gros Ventre Cerise Vineyard Anderson Valley Pinot Noir\n\n14.0% alc., 151 cases, $44. Pommard 5 and Wädenswil. 100% de-stemmed, native fermentations. Aged 10 months in 50% new French oak barrels. Unfined and unfiltered. • Well oaked with noticeable spice and savory accents. Generous purple fruit flavors with bright acidity on the elegant finish. Needs more time to integrate the oak. Very good (-). Reviewed June 24, 2012\n\n2009 Gros Ventre First Born Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir\n\n14.4% alc., 101 cases, $50. A flagship cuveé representing the best lots of a vintage. This bottling is dominated by fruit sourced from an unnamed vineyard along the true Sonoma Coast. • Dark and densely colored in the glass. The nose leaps out from the glass with of scents of spiced black cherries, raspberries, plums and faint herbal oak. Rich and intense, saturating the palate with plush sweet fruits that find every nook and cranny in the mouth. Lively natural acidity maintains the wine’s vitality and supple tannins make for smooth, seductive drinking. This wine is a little too busty for me but it will find many fans. Decanting is obligatory. Very good. Reviewed July 1, 2011\n\nJuly 1, 2013\n\nDrink Cool Climate Wines\n\n“The 2011 Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir is from three vineyards located in the cool-climate West Sonoma Coast. The wine has a deep ruby color with aromas of black cherry, ripe strawberry, and black raspberry, with some herbal aromas combined with some floral hints. The wine is moderate to heavy with rich texture and tannins, which makes the wine drinkable now with aeration, but undoubtedly will improve after a few more years in the bottle. This is a great pinot noir wine, and with its complex aromas and flavors it is perfect for sipping, eating with cheese, as well as pairing with poultry, lighter red meats, and even steaks.\n\nAvailable at top West Coast restaurants (such as: The French Laundry – Napa Valley, Michael Mina and RN74 – San Francisco, Chinois On Main – Santa Monica, Spago – Beverly Hills, etc.) or by ordering from Gros Ventre Cellars.”\n\nRead More\n\nThe 2021 Chenin Blanc is bright and focused, with a compelling mix of varietal orchard fruit and brighter, more citrusy accents that add brightness.

Medium-bodied with silky, structured tannins. Vibrant and expressive, with berry fruit and mineral notes blending together beautifully. Complex, but remains approachable and will age wonderfully. Delicious wine. Drink or hold.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 94 points\n\nA rather svelte pinot with black-cherry, leather, bark and sauteed-mushroom character. It’s medium-bodied with ﬁne and polished tannins and a long, ﬂavorful ﬁnish. Some redwood and dried sea wood. Salted caramel, too. Drink now or hold.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 93 points\n\nA rather expressive nose with notes of hibiscus, blueberry, strawberry and wet stone. Medium-bodied with soft, ﬁne tannins. Wet-mineral notes mix with the slightly blue-tinged fruit notes. Moss, too. Lovely mouth-feel. Drink or hold.\n\n2021 Fiano Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nAromatic aromas of chamomile, lily, beeswax and a hint of jasmine. Medium-bodied with a silky-smooth texture.

Drink or hold.\n\nSpring 2022\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 95 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch is fabulous. Complex and multi-dimensional, the 2019 is dynamic and super-expressive. Rose petal, lavender, spice, sage and mint play off a core of dark red/purplish berry fruit. This is a terrific Pinot from the northern part of the West Sonoma Coast.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir First Born is a blend mostly from Campbell and Robbins – Calera, 667 and 777 clones. Racy and exuberant, the First Born is impeccable. There is a bit more ripeness here (but still within the house style) and also a touch more new oak, a combination that works so well. Rose petal, orange peel, spice and a touch of whole cluster savoriness inform this wonderfully expressive Pinot Noir from Gros Ventre.\n\n2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is a gorgeous appellation-level wine. Effusive and generous, the 2019 is so expressive today. Crushed rose petal, mint, sweet red berry and chalk all meld together. There’s a touch of whole cluster influence, but it is minimal. Give this a year or so to soften.\n\n2019 High Country Red, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 High Country Red is fabulous. Rich and ample yet also light on its feet, the 2019 has so much to offer. In this vintage, a good deal of the Pinot Noir comes from top Sonoma sites (as opposed to El Dorado in the past), and that really seems to have made a big difference. The 2019 is such a gorgeous wine. Bright red berry fruit, orange peel, mint, white pepper and chalk all race out of the glass. The 2019 was done almost entirely with destemmed fruit, but it is quite savory.\n\n2019 Gamay Noir, 91 points\n\nThe 2019 Gamay Noir is bright, effusive and so expressive. Crushed red berry, cinnamon, orange peel, mint, cedar and new leather are all beautifully lifted in the glass. Medium in body, silky and light on its feet, the Gamay Noir a is stellar wine in this range. The 25% whole clusters are very nicely integrated.\n\n2020 Chenin Blanc, 92 points\n\nThe 2020 Chenin Blanc opens with a burst of floral and citrus notes. Readers will find a vibrant, energetic white loaded with personality. All the elements come together nicely. This is an especially floral, savory Chenin.\n\n2020 High Country White, 91 points\n\nThe 2020 White High Country is an intriguing blend of mostly Fiano and Arneis, with complementary dollops of several other white varieties. Orchard fruit, almonds and wild flowers all take shape in the glass. Drink this joyous, delicious white over the next few years.\n\n2020 Vermentino, 90 points\n\nThe 2020 Vermentino is bright, focused and nervy, all qualities that will serve it well over the next few years. This crisp, refreshing Vermentino offers tons of varietal character. Green pear, lime, almond, sage, mint and white pepper linger. There is plenty to like.\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nVinous, Antonio Galloni\n\n“I was once again quite impressed with this range from Chris and Sarah Pittenger. The wines are compelling, from the entry-level offerings, all the way up to the top Pinots that comprise the heart of the range. The wines are done in a style that emphasizes vibrancy and transparency. Aging for the Pinots is about 17 months or so, on the longer side for California, mostly neutral oak. Whole cluster influence is light.” – Antonio Galloni\n\n2018 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir First Born, a selection of the best barrels in the cellar, is mostly Campbell and a bit of Baranoff, done with all destemmed fruit. It marries power with translucence beautifully. Darker shades of fruit and a touch of new oak are front and center. This is another fabulous wine in the range.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 93+ points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch has a lot of potential, but readers will have to be patient. A rich, deep wine, the Campbell Ranch is pretty packed in at this stage. Bright red/purplish fruit, orange peel, spice, mint, cedar and sweet pipe tobacco all run through the 2018.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Baranoff, 93 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir Baranoff Vineyard is fabulous. It captures all the intensity of the Russian River in a mid-weight, translucent style that is quite appealing. Crushed flowers, kirsch, hard candy, raspberry, cinnamon, mint and cedar give the 2018 striking aromatic brilliance. Understated and classy to the core, the 2018 is so inviting today. The 2018 was done with fully destemmed fruit. I would give it a few years to soften. There is a lot of wine here.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 92 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast) is another superb wine in this range. It captures all the exuberance of the year in its forward, boisterous personality. Juicy dark cherry, plum, new leather, licorice and spice are amplified in this creamy, sensual Pinot from Gros Ventre. Vineyard sites are Campbell and Baranoff.\n\n2019 High Country Red El Dorado, 92 points\n\nThe 2019 High Country Red is fabulous. Rich and ample yet also light on its feet, the 2019 has so much to offer. In this vintage, a good deal of the Pinot Noir comes from top Sonoma sites (as opposed to El Dorado in the past), and that really seems to have made a big difference. The 2019 is such a gorgeous wine. Bright red berry fruit, orange peel, mint, white pepper and chalk all race out of the glass. The 2019 was done almost entirely with destemmed fruit, but it is quite savory.\n\nAugust 2020\n\nJeb Dunnuck\n\n2018 Pinot Noir First Born, 94 points\n\nThe 2018 Pinot Noir First Born showed beautifully, with a complex yet elegant style that’s already approachable. Coming from a selection of the best lots and 90% destemmed and aged in 40% new barrels, it offers a great perfume of raspberries, orange blossom, violets, and dried flowers. With medium to full body, beautiful purity of fruit, and integrated acidity, it’s another classy wine from this estate that will impress over the coming 7-8 years or more.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch, 94 points\n\nFrom a site on the Sonoma Coast, the 2018 Pinot Noir Campbell Ranch was all destemmed and brought up 18 months in 20% new French oak. More strawberries, white flowers, orange blossom, and honeysuckle emerge from this beauty, which is medium to full-bodied and has a rounded, elegant texture, beautiful fruit, good acidity, and a clean, lengthy finish. It’s beautifully done and already drinking great. It should evolve for 5-7 years.\n\n2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, 93 points\n\nFermented with 10% stems and aged 18 months in 15% new French oak, the 2018 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast has a pretty bouquet of tart cherry and strawberry fruits as well as a distinctly floral character, notes of underbrush and orange blossom, medium to full body, a beautifully pure texture, and a great finish. It’s a richer, powerful Pinot Noir that still stays remarkably elegant and pure, with good acidity, polished tannins, and again, a great finish that keeps you coming back to the glass. It needs air"
