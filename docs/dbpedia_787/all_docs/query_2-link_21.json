The area is southeast of Haifa, in modern-day Israel. Its Greek name is Armageddon\n\nTel Megiddo, Israel – a Biblical World Heritage Site\n\n73 or 74 CE – The walls of Masada, a Jewish fortress held by the Sicarii (the most implacable of the Zealots who were in rebellion) are finally breached by the Roman legion led by Roman governor of Judaea, Lucius Flavius Silva, after months of siege. They find hundreds of men, women and children killed in a mass suicide amid fires set to destroy the buildings. Only two women and five children are found still alive\n\n1516 – Tabinshwehti, King of Burma, is born, founder of the Toungoo Dynasty; his military campaigns expanded the kingdom\n\n1646 – Jules Hardouin-Mansart, French architect, designed the Grand Trianon\n\n1660 – Hans Sloane born in Ireland, British naturalist who bequeathed his collection to the nation, the foundation of the British Museum\n\n1693 – Mary Alexander born, American colonial merchant, successful and influential; she married twice and had ten children; her fortune was estimated at 100,000 pounds in 1743\n\nMary Spratt Provoost Alexander\n\n1746 – The Battle of Culloden is fought between the French-supported Jacobites of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and the British Hanoverian forces commanded by William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, in Scotland, the last pitched battle fought on British soil. Between 1,500 and 2,000 Jacobites died, and roughly 200-300 English. Two days after the battle, English troops kill any wounded they find. Prisoners are tried for high treason, but nearly 1,000 sentences are commuted to penal transportation to the British colonies for life, and some are exchanged for prisoners of war held by France. Of the 3,471 recorded prisoners, the fate of 648 is unknown. Lords and Clans chiefs who supported the rebellion are stripped of their estates.
