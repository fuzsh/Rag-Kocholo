        "text": "Karen Ruth Kirsch, 79 of Merrillan, WI passed away peacefully at her home after a long and courageous battle with cancer. Karen was born December 10, 1941 in Milwaukee, WI, daughter of Ralph and Ardith(Ploeger) Hafemeister.\n\nKaren loved working in her gardens. She raised fruits and vegetables for her large family, along with always surrounding her home with wonderful flowers. She enjoyed cooking and baking. She spent many evenings pouring over cookbooks and writing recipes on her index cards. Her top priority was her children. Everything she did, either directly or indirectly, was always with them in mind. She was a true matriarch and kept her family connected with holidays spent together around her large dining room table. She was hard working and never complained. Her calm, quiet, selfless, and compassionate nature will be fondly remembered and missed dearly by her family.\n\nKaren and Joseph raised eight children together. Survivors include Joseph Kirsch of Viola WI, and their eight children: Ruth (Joseph) Kies of Necedah, Roland Kirsch of Stewart, MN, Corinne Kirsch of Sheboygan Falls, Stephen Kirsch of Merillan, Joseph Kirsch of Milwaukee, Erik Kirsch of Monroe, Phillip (Joanna) Kirsch of Burlington, Christopher (Angela) Kirsch of Middleton; thirteen grandchildren: Sylvia and Bryce Kies, Timothy (Tereasa) Kirsch, Kathy (Sara) Hang, Carter and Gabrielle Ziemann, Bradley, Jeffrey, Katie and Sarah Kirsch, Maximilian and Sophia Kirsch, Julia Kirsch and five great-grandchildren: Nicholas, Theo and Natalie Kirsch, Levi Hang, and Malaya Ziemann; two sisters, Shirley(Gary) Kuntzsch of Winneconne and Nancy(Charles) James of Rio along with many nieces and nephews.\n\nKaren was preceded in death by her parents Ralph and Ardith, her brother Robert, and daughter-in-law Kathy.\n\nKaren was a private person and as such never liked being the center of attention so per her wishes there will be no public service. Her immediate family will gather to celebrate her life at a future date."
