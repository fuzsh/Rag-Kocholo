Cornelius Okey, one of the earliest settlers in this country, died at his residence one half mile north east of this place, on Friday morning, Sept. 23, 1859. He was the eldest son of Judge Levin Okey, and was born in Lewistown, Sussex County, Delaware, on the 3rd of January 1783. In the spring of 1800, he removed with his fatherÂ’s family to the mouth of Captina, in Belmont County, in this State, where, on the 5th of February, 1805, he was married to Hannah Wier, whom he survived seven years. The issue of the marriage was thirteen children, seven sons and six daughters, all of whom are still living.\n\nIn the Spring of 1815, he removed to the farm on which he resided at the time of his decease. We do not use the word farm as now understood, for then it was an unbroken forest. Here he settled down, cleared out his farm, reared his family, and grew up with the country. At that day the facilities for acquiring an education were extremely limited, but being possessed of a strong native intellect, he to a very considerable extent overcame the disadvantage of the lack of early education; and shortly after the organization of the county, we find him filling important political stations. In 1825, he represented the county in the State legislature, and afterwards was re-elected to the same office several times.--He also filled the office of Auditor and Recorder and that of Sheriff from 1835 to 1839, and was a Justice of the Peace for many years.Â—All these stations he filled with satisfaction to his constituents, and credit to himself.\n\nThe virtues of bravery and hospitality he possessed in common with nearly all the pioneers of the Western country. And although as we have just stated, he was frequently elevated by the free choice of his fellow citizens to posts of honor and importance, yet he was remarkably plain and unassuming in his manners; and however dark the future appeared to others, he was ever hopeful, ever cheerful.\n\nHe was buried by the Masons of Monroe Lodge, with all the ceremonies of that ancient order, with which he had been connected nearly forty years. The interment was in a private family burying ground in the orchard planted with his own hands. He was followed to his last resting place by an unusual number of actual descendants. Twelve out of the thirteen were there, the sons with their wives and the daughters with their husbands, and besides he was mourned by a large number of grand children and great grand children.\n\nCol. Okey had the most unyielding faith in the final happiness of all mankind, and no one ever entered more cheerfully on his journey to that Â“undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns.Â” We had the pleasure of seeing and conversing with him the day previous to his death, and we found him gently sinking to rest, as a tired child sinks into sleep on its motherÂ’s lap. Thus full of years and of honors, was he gathered to his fathers. Â“May our last end be like his.Â” Woodsfield September 28th 1859. W. P. R.\n\nJohnson A.

Carrick, Monroe County, Ohio, Jeremiah Tracy, Elder of the Christian Church, aged 65 years and 7 months.\n\nElder Tracy professed the Christian religion in his youth, and by his industry and zeal attained a degree of usefulness. The death of Elder Tracy is a bereavement deeply felt by the congregation over which he presided about 28 years. Notwithstanding the maturity of his days. his vacant place in society will be long and often mourned; but this loss is undoubtedly his gain for \"blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. Yea, says the Spirit, from henceforth they shall rest from their labors and their works do follow them.\" The church has met a loss not soon to be repaired. Faithful, affectionate and frank in the discharge of his duty, brother Tracy was benevolent and hospitable, and a friend of the preachers who always received a cordial welcome to his home and family. He was a faithful, cheerful, loving husband and father. He was devotedly attached to the cause of Christ, the interest of which he felt he could not serve too faithfully, however much of sacrifice such service might involve. It must suffice to say he finished his course in holy triumph and doubtless now rests in the Paradise of God.\n\nWhile yet the harvest fields are white,\n\nAnd few the toiling reapers stand,\n\nCalled from his labor just at night,\n\nWe miss the mightiest of the land.\n\nOh, thou of strong and gentle mind,\n\nThy trembling voice is heard no more;\n\nFor truth, for freedom, for mankind,\n\nThe lesson of thy life is o'er.\n\nBut thou in brightness far above\n\nThe fairest dream of human thought,\n\nBefore the seat of power and love,\n\nArt with the truth thou hast sought.\n\nUnveil thy bosom faithful tomb,\n\nTake this new tenement to thy trust,\n\nAnd give these sacred relics room\n\nTo slumber in the silent dust.\n\nNo pain nor grief, no anxious fear\n\nInvades thy bounds--no mortal woes\n\nCan reach the peaceful sleeper here,\n\nWhile angels watch his soft repose.\n\nSo Jesus slept--God's dying Son\n\nPassed through the grave and blessed the bed;\n\nThen rest, aged man, till from His throne\n\nThe morning breaks and pierce the shade.\n\nE.

Her parents moved to the state of Ohio in 1793, and settled just below the mouth of Sunfish Creek. At this time there was but one house- - a log cabin, on the present site of the pleasant little village of Clarington. She labored as a servant girl in the city of Wheeling sixty-five years ago. This prosperous and thriving city was a very small village, containing only four dry goods stores within its limits. When she was young the county of Monroe, which has now so many pleasant little towns within its borders, was an almost unbroken wilderness infested with bears, wolves, and other wild animals. She remembers very distinctly the old block house of Wheeling that was built as a defense against the Indians. The early pioneers had may trials and difficulties to encounter which we, who are young, know nothing about. When we look around us it seems hard for us to realize that there are those among us who can recollect the time when this part of the pleasant State of Ohio was practically speaking, in a state of nature. Mother Smith was married to Basil Smith in 1820. They located themselves near the mouth of the Capatina about six miles above the village of Clarington, where they resided for several years. They came to this Richfork in Wayne township, Monroe County. Ohio almost a half century ago, when this part of the country was comparatively new. Here her husband died about twenty-eight years ago. She is the mother of thirteen children. Ten of whom are yet living. One hundred thirteen children have been born to call her grandmother, and 115 great grandchildren have beheld the light of day. Her descendants are as numerous, perhaps, as those of any other woman within the county. But the early pioneers of our land, those who cleared up this country and rendered it fit for the reception of a large population are fast passing away, and the day is not far distant when all those who endured the hardships and privations incident to a frontier life will have passed away and the story of their conflicts will have only in the molds and hearts of their descendants.

While on the train, she became very sick, and upon arriving in Woodsfield, she was laid upon her fatal bed of illness and for four weeks she suffered until released by death. Her death occurred on Sunday morning, May 4, 1890, thus reaching the age of 67 years, 2 months, and 10 days. She suffered from a contracted cold, which finally resulted in typhoid fever. On Sunday morning, she had a stroke of paralysis from the effects of which she passed from time to eternity. She has been a consistent member of the German M. E.

While there she made the acquaintance of a baker named William Maier, who pretended, after a short acquaintance to be very much in love with her. She did not fancy Maier, however, and avoided his company as much as possible. He finally threatened to take her life if she did not become his wife. After these threats and Maier's ardent pretensions of love, Miss Yoho finally consented to become his wife, and they were married on the 20th day of October, 1891.\n\nAfter they were married it is said they often quarreled, and were apparently very disagreeable in the company of each other. Last Sunday morning, after a serious quarrel, Mrs. Maier left her home and went to her sister in another part of the city. The two made up, however, and Mrs. Maier returned home last Monday, taking with her a little sister.\n\nAbout 2 o'clock Tuesday morning the heartless husband arrayed himself in the best clothes, procured a revolver and fired four balls at his wife, all of them taking effect. He then fled and has not been captured.\n\nNo one was present to tell the story save the twelve-year-old sister of Mrs. Maier. She was wounded in the hand by one of the balls, and was so badly scared she could tell but very little of what occurred.\n\nMaier had a very bad reputation before the crime was committed; and had been convicted of several smaller crimes. Those who knew Mrs. Maier before she went to Wheeling say she was a kind-hearted, inoffensive girl.\n\nHer parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Yoho, have been residing at Triadelphia for a short time, having removed from Woodsfield to that point.\n\nFor the conclusion of this case, click here.\n\nWilliam Maier\n\nSource:Monroe County Gazette, Woodsfield Ohio; 24 November 1892\n\nWilliam Maier, who murdered his young wife last April, was hung in the Wheeling jail yard last Friday at 11:10 a.m. The platform of the scaffold was seven feet square and 6 1/2 feet from the ground, the approach to the same being gained by a stairway of ten steps. The overhead beam, upon which one end of the rope was fastened was 8 1/2 feet above the platform. The trap-door in the center of the platform was three feet square being composed of two doors divided in halves, which fell downward upon pulling of the spring. The doors were held in place by the slightest catch, and but a slight pull of the string was necessary to open the hole. The fall was about 3 1/ feet.\n\nMaier died bravely. He spent the most of his last night conversing with Rev. Father McElligott, his spiritual adviser, and to him told the details of his escape and return after the murder, which he had before kept to himself. Maier said he had returned in order to kill himself on his wife's grave. He received extreme unction and at 10:30 the death warrant was read to him. He showed great emotion on hearing it, but quickly recovered himself. Shortly after 11 o'clock the march to the scaffold began, Maier being accompanied by this trusted spiritual adviser. He ascended the scaffold unassisted, but was accompanied by the priest and Sheriff. His last words were an expression of hope to meet his dead wife in Heaven. Then came the tragic end of all.\n\nThe body hung for half an hour and was taken down and was examined by Drs. Wilson and Hupp, Jr., who pronounced him dead. A Mr. Robinson of Pittsburgh, adjusted the noose. The crowd was limited. The dead man left a letter that was not to be opened until after his execution and in it he admits the crime of which he suffered the death penalty.\n\nThe Crime\n\nThe crime of Wm. Maier was very brutal. Early in the morning of April 5th, 1892, Maier, who was a German baker, shot his young wife to death in their home at Wheeling and then fled. Mrs. Maier's maiden name was Miss Hannah Yoho and she was formerly resident of near Woodsfield. They had been married only six months. Maier was captured near his wife's grave several days after the crime had been committed, and was put on trial a week afterward. At the trial the defense set up to make a plea of insanity, but failed to make any sort of case for the prisoner. The only witness to the awful deed was a little girl about 12 years old, a sister of the murdered woman, who lived with the Maiers.\n\nHer story was that Maier had asked his wife to kiss him before going to work and on her refusal, he pulled his pistol and shot her four times. Maier claimed he knew nothing of the deed, and did not remember any of the circumstances. He gave no clear idea of his whereabouts after the murder. The only reason he gave for murder was that his wife had threatened to leave him. After a trial of three days he was found guilty of murder in the first degree. A motion for a new trial was made, but overruled, and he was sentenced to be hanged Aug. 5. A stay of proceedings was granted, and the case appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeals. A new trial was refused and he was sentenced to die Nov. 18. A final effort to secure a commutation of sentence from the Governor was made without success.\n\n1893Return to Top of Page and Index of Years\n\nLucinda Rosan Christman[The Monroe Gazette Woodsfield, Ohio, Thurs., Feb. 23, 1893]\n\nIn Memory of the death of Miss Lucinda Rosan Christman.\n\nJesus said unto them: Â“Give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth.Â” Matthew II, 24.

Nore than a passing notice is due the name and memory of a man so useful to his fellowmen, and so devoted to his God. At an early age he yielded his heart and life to his Savior. Nearly thirty years of his life were passed in the proclamation of the gospel. He added to his faith the courage that enabled him to declare the whole counsel of God to sinful men, in meekness and love. Faithfully he sowed the seed of the kingdom in the minds and hearts of his friends, cheerfully sharing in the support of fellow-helpers to gather in the fruits of his labor. Hence his death came to his many friends as a personal bereavement. He leaves a wife and three children, two sisters and five brothers, besides a host of relatives and friends to mourn his departure. How sad to part with such a loved one, but we sorrow not as those who have no hope. His remains were laid to rest in West Union cemetery.\n\nA precious one from us has gone,\n\nA voice we loved is stilled;\n\nA place is vacant in our home,\n\nWhich never can be filled.\n\nViola Barker\n\n1898Return to Top of Page and Index of Years\n\nJennie Christman[Source: The Spirit of Democracy Issue: Woodsfield, Ohio, Thurs., April 7, 1898 Collection of Gertrude Christman Kahrig]\n\nDied, near Calais, Ohio, March 26, 1898, Jennie Christman, age 27 years, wife of George Christman.
