        "text": "Synopsis\n\nSarah Kirsch was a leading East German poet before leaving in 1977 for West Germany, where her work was already highly regarded. While she had supported many of the political and social aims of the Communist government in the GDR, she had been active during the 1960s in opposing the restrictions of the official creed of social realism, by writing poetry concerned with private emotion and individual perception. She has been the recipient of many literary awards, including the Austrian State Prize for Literature and the Friedrich Holderlin Prize, and is today considered one of the most eminent German poets. In her close, stylish versions of Sarah Kirsch's poems, which combine fluid movement with abrupt dislocations of syntax, and in her choice of poems from all phases of her work, Margitt Lehbert demonstrates the qualities which make Sarah Kirsch's poetry so original and compelling.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSarah Kirsch was born in 1935 in Limlingerode and studied biology at the University of Halle. Her poems first appeared in East German magazines in the early 1960s. In 1976 she joined eleven other writers in protests against the expulsion from East Germany of the singer-poet Wolf Biermann. This led to her own expulsion from the Communist Party, and to her permanent move to West Germany. Sarah Kirsch passed away in 2013. Margitt Lehbert was born in Geneva, Switzerland, to German parents in 1957. She grew up in the United States and Germany, studied in Konstanz and Iowa City, and translates into German as well as English. In 2006 she founded Edition Rugerup, which publishes mostly poetry in translation. She lives in south Sweden."
