        "text": "The Fatio Protocol permits agents to make, question, challenge and justify assertions, using an explicit argumentation theory. The locutions are based on a classification of utterances extending the classifications of John Austin, John Searle, and Jurgen Habermas. The protocol syntax has been given an axiomatic and operational semantics, in such a way as to make these locutions compatible with FIPA's agent communication language, FIPA ACL. In other words, agents engaged in communicative acts using FIPA ACL may simply add the Fatio locutions to the 22 FIPA locutions in order to support inter-agent argument.\n\nThe Fatio protocol was first presented at Agent Communications 2004, a refereed international workshop held in New York City in association with AAMAS 2004. The work was later published in revised form in the Springer volume of proceeedings of that workshop.\n\nP. McBurney and S.

Berlin, Germany: Springer.\n\nThe Fatio Protocol has since been applied to the problem of identifying and resolving conflicting routing policies of separate autonomous domains each using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the standard Internet stack.

It improves on similar efforts in the computer science literature in three ways: (a) by only allowing proposed deals to become binding upon acceptance of the proposal by all parties affected; (b) by permitting more than two parties to a deal; and (c) by drawing together three strands of prior work: Hamblin's dialogue game theory from the philosophy of argumentation, Gelernter's tuple-spaces theory from distributed computing, and Singh's theory of commitments from multi-agent communications. The protocol uses a stratified tuple-spaces architecture, and we articulate both a complete syntax and a private axiomatic semantics for the protocol.\n\nP. McBurney and S.

Wooldridge and M. Yokoo (Editors): Proceedings of the Second International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS-2003), pp. 624-631. New York, NY, USA: ACM Press.\n\nThis protocol permits agents to engage in a dialogue over what actions to take in some circumstance, drawing on a theory of retroflexive argument due to Harald Wohlrapp. We present both the complete syntax and a public axiomatic semantics for the protocol. The protocol was presented initially at the Fourth Biennial Conference of the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation (OSSA 2001), and then a revised version published in Journal of Intelligent Systems in 2007.\n\nD.
