        "text": "The primary objective is a normative investigation of concepts and methods to measure the quality of arguments in public policies. Public arguments, as they are understood in WG2, are arguments that concern items of national or international policy or law making, and agents communicate such arguments in the public sphere. This WG involves philosophers, legal and political theorists, as well as linguists and other scholars who investigate public arguments from a variety of theoretical viewpoints.\n\nWG2 specifically engages with the kinds of normativity that characterize public arguments. The groupâ€™s task is to develop a catalogue of concepts of public argument, of the kinds of normativity pertinent to the evaluation of public arguments, and of the methods for studying them. We do this in close collaboration with colleagues in WG1, who develop tools for the empirical study of public argument, and in WG3, who develop tools for the application of argumentation theories in argument design."
