        "text": "Hans V. Hansen\n\nThis bibliography gathers the most important research of the last twenty-five years on individual fallacies and fallacy theory, but also includes some entries from earlier in the century. Hamblin's bibliography, in Fallacies (1970, 304-16) is an excellent guide to the historical sources.\n\nFor those entries below whose titles do not make clear what the subject of the entry is, we have added a short note. The criteria of inclusion are as follows: (1) articles on individual fallacies or fallacy theory that have appeared in refereed journals; (2) textbooks that have made a significant practical or theoretical contribution to the study of fallacies, or whose treatment of fallacies has been widely discussed, or that take a fallacies approach to informal logic or critical thinking; and (3) conference proceedings and other collections that contain a significant number of papers of interest. Additional references to published work on the fallacies, as well as informal logic and argumentation theory in general, may be found in H. V. Hansen, \"An informal logic bibliography,\" Informal Logic 12 (1990): 155-84.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance of Peter Houtlosser (University of Amsterdam) and Mark Letteri (University of Windsor) in preparing this bibliography."
