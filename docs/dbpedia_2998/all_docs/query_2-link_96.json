        "text": "The notion of subjecting spiritual claims to standard procedures of public discussion, and treating spiritual claims with the usual level of doubt applied to any other claims, counts as an affront for many esoterically inclined people. According to Steiner, reverence was the proper attitude, not doubt, and not a few anthroposophists seek \"the opposite of discussion\" rather than public discussion of their beliefs. This is a big part of the reason why treating Steiner as a human being and a historical figure seems like a devious materialist trick to many anthroposophists. Some of the more interesting recent research on modern European occultism has tried to assess the ways in which a desire to break free of perceived constraints in mainstream science and intellectual culture led to the kind of credulousness that frequently arises in such contexts.\n\nFor those who are not committed to \"the opposite of discussion\" but are instead willing to explore public discussion of esoteric spirituality, for those who do not mistake critique for antipathy, and for those who do not confuse \"authenticity\" with validity, there are many sources on the general contours of public discourse. The basic standards involved have been remarkably consistent across a wide variety of historical periods and cultural contexts, from Aristotle to Hannah Arendt to Amartya Sen to Kwame Anthony Appiah.\n\nA good introduction can be found in the book I recommended to Ted a couple weeks ago, Maurice Finocchiaro, Arguments about Arguments: Systematic, Critical and Historical Essays in Logical Theory (Cambridge University Press, 2005). Other works provide background on what philosophers call “argumentation theory,” according to which debate, dialogue, and conversation are built on understanding and identifying conflicting claims, discerning both the premises and the conclusions derived from them, assembling evidence, examining reasoning, offering rejoinders and rebuttals, and through this ongoing process constructing sound arguments about all sorts of topics, including esoteric topics and spiritual topics. A classic analysis is available in Stephen Toulmin’s 1959 book The Uses of Argument, but there are lots of more recent and more accessible treatments. I'd recommend in particular the work of Nancy Fraser, Cornelius Castoriadis, Annette Baier, Edward Said, and Iris Marion Young. Those interested in the practical applications of these procedures might take a look at Sandra Lee Bartky's book Sympathy and Solidarity, John Gastil's study Democracy in Small Groups: Participation, Decision Making, and Communication, and Susan Bickford's particularly perceptive book The Dissonance of Democracy: Listening, Conflict, and Citizenship. For the German readers I also recommend Harald Wohlrapp's 2008 book Der Begriff des Arguments: Über die Beziehungen zwischen Wissen, Forschen, Glaube, Subjektivität und Vernunft. Last, on the topic of spiritual views more specifically, there is a very worthwhile book by Russell McCutcheon, Critics not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion (State University of New York Press, 2001).
