The first section of this contribution briefly starts from the concepts of argument scheme, typology of arguments schemes, and the foundational catalogue of 28 topoi from Aristotle's Rhetoric. The application of the \"topical method\" is first based on the knowledge of typologies of arguments, and then on the precise features defining an argument type. The practical question that re...\n\nTypes of arguments in parents-children discussions:: an argumentative analysis\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBova, Antonio; Arcidiacono, Francesco\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study aims to single out the argumentative strategies most frequently used by parents to convince their children to accept their rules and prescriptions at mealtimes. The results of thestudy show that parents mostly put forward arguments based on the quality and quantity of food to persuade their childern to eat. Less frequently, the parents put forward other types of arguments such as the appeal to consistency, the arguments from expert opinion, and the argument from analogy. Whi...\n\nUnderstanding and Detecting Supporting Arguments of Diverse Types\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHua, Xinyu; Wang, Lu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe investigate the problem of sentence-level supporting argument detection from relevant documents for user-specified claims. A dataset containing claims and associated citation articles is collected from online debate website idebate.org. We then manually label sentence-level supporting arguments from the documents along with their types as study, factual, opinion, or reasoning. We further characterize arguments of different types, and explore whether leveraging type information can facilita...\n\nFunctional Parallel Factor Analysis for Functions of One- and Two-dimensional Arguments.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChoi, Ji Yeh; Hwang, Heungsun; Timmerman, Marieke E\n\n2018-03-01\n\nParallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) is a useful multivariate method for decomposing three-way data that consist of three different types of entities simultaneously. This method estimates trilinear components, each of which is a low-dimensional representation of a set of entities, often called a mode, to explain the maximum variance of the data. Functional PARAFAC permits the entities in different modes to be smooth functions or curves, varying over a continuum, rather than a collection of unconnected responses. The existing functional PARAFAC methods handle functions of a one-dimensional argument (e.g., time) only. In this paper, we propose a new extension of functional PARAFAC for handling three-way data whose responses are sequenced along both a two-dimensional domain (e.g., a plane with x- and y-axis coordinates) and a one-dimensional argument. Technically, the proposed method combines PARAFAC with basis function expansion approximations, using a set of piecewise quadratic finite element basis functions for estimating two-dimensional smooth functions and a set of one-dimensional basis functions for estimating one-dimensional smooth functions. In a simulation study, the proposed method appeared to outperform the conventional PARAFAC. We apply the method to EEG data to demonstrate its empirical usefulness.\n\nFunction and Argument in Begriffsschrift\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nBadesa, C.; Bertran-San MillÃ¡n, Joan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 38, Ä. 4 (2017), s. 316-341 ISSN 0144-5340 Institutional support: RVO:67985955 Keywords : identity * Frege * logic * function * argument Subject RIV: AA - Philosophy ; Religion OBOR OECD: Philosophy, History and Philosophy of science and technology Impact factor: 0.286, year: 2016\n\nSemantic types of some generic relation arguments: Detection and evaluation\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nKatrenko, S.; Adriaans, P.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis paper presents an approach to detection of the semantic types of relation arguments employing the WordNet hierarchy.

Among the issues that developmental psychologists study, discovering the ontogenetic trajectory of mechanisms or capacities underpinning our cognitive functions ranks highly. The order in which functions are developed or capacities are acquired is a matter of debate between competing psychological theories, and also philosophical conceptions of the mind - getting the role and the significance of the different steps in this order right could be seen as an important virtue of such theories. Thus, a special kind of strategy in arguments between competing philosophical or psychological theories is using developmental order in arguing for or against a given psychological claim. In this article, I will introduce an analysis of arguments from developmental order, which come in two general types: arguments emphasizing the importance of the early cognitive processes and arguments emphasizing the late cognitive processes. I will discuss their role in one of the central tools for evaluating scientific theories, namely in making inferences to the best explanation. I will argue that appeal to developmental order is, by itself, an insufficient criterion for theory choice and has to be part of an argument based on other core explanatory or empirical virtues. I will end by proposing a more concerted study of philosophical issues concerning (cognitive) development, and I will present some topics that also pertain to a full-fledged 'philosophy of development.'\n\nThe Types of Argument Structure Used by Hillary Clinton in the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnggie Angeline\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This qualitative research was conducted to examine the types of argument structure by Hillary Clinton in part one of the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate since Hillary, who had a great deal of experiences in political parties, was supposed to be able to construct convincing arguments that had good argument structures. The theories used to analyze were Bierman and Assaliâs (1996, Kingâs (n.d. and Stanlickâs (2003. The findings showed that there were five types of argument structure used: serial, linked, convergent, divergent, and hybrid argument structures. The linked argument structure was the argument structure used the most frequently in Hillaryâs utterances in the debate, while the divergent was the least one. Thus, it could be concluded that Hillaryâs speech in the Presidential Debate was quite interesting since she could combine all the five types of argument structure, though the frequency of using them was not the same and it seems that linked argument structure was the most effective strategy for her in arguing about the politic, economy, and social issues.\n\nArguments from Developmental Order\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRichard eStÃ¶ckle-Schobel\n\n2016-05-01\n\nFull Text Available In this article, I investigate a special type of argument regarding the role of development in theorising about psychological processes and cognitive capacities.

Davis in 1935 extended Gauss's result to the polygamma functions Ï (n) (z) (n element of N) by using a known series representation of Ï (n) (z) in an elementary yet technical way. Koelbig in 1996, in his CERN technical report, also gave two extensions to Ï (n) (z) by using the series definition of polylogarithm function and the above-known series representation. Here we aim at deriving general formulae expressing Ï (n) (z) (n element of N 0 ) as rational arguments in terms of other functions, which will be obtained in two ways. In addition, several special cases are also considered and, as a by-product of our main results, we derive, in a simple and unified manner, all formulae given by Gauss, Davis and Koelbig. Finally, it should be noted that all our results, in view of the relationship between Ï (n) (z) and the Hurwitz zeta function, Î¶(s, a), could be rewritten in the representation of Î¶(s, a)\n\nOn argumentation schemes and the natural classification of arguments\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKatzav, K.; Reed, C.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nWe develop conceptions of arguments and of argument types that will, by serving as the basis for developing a natural classification of arguments, benefit work in artificial intelligence.

We add argument parsing, making it possible to freely pass variables and parameters into pre-deï¬ned and user-deï¬ned functions. We also introduce a syntax to use certain compositions of functions, namely normalized sums and convolutions, directly in TF1. Finally, we introduce some simple vectorization functionality to TF1 and demonstrate the potential to speed up parallelizable computations.\n\nFallacies in ethical argumentation on abortion\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSimona Mazilu\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper represents a case study of the types of fallacies that may occur in the argumentation stage of an ethical dispute over abortion. The theoretical framework I use is the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992, 2004 which conceives of fallacies as violations of the rules for critical discussion. I will focus on the fallacies resulting from the violation of the relevance rule in two fragments of argumentative texts illustrating opposing positions on abortion. I claim that these fallacies function as winning strategies in the ethical dispute in case.\n\nArgument estimates of certain multivalent functions involving a linear operator\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNak Eun Cho\n\n2002-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose of this paper is to derive some argument properties of certain multivalent functions in the open unit disk involving a linear operator.

J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe definition of the binomial coefficient in terms of gamma functions also allows non-integer arguments. For nonnegative integer arguments the gamma functions reduce to factorials, leading to the well-known Pascal triangle. Using a symmetry formula for the gamma function, this definition is extended to negative integer arguments, making the symmetry identity for binomial coefficients valid for all integer arguments. The agreement of this definition with some other identities and with the bin...\n\nThree Arguments for Lotteries\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSTONE, PETER\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPUBLISHED Philosophers and social scientists have offered a variety of arguments for making certain types of decisions by lot. This paper examines three such arguments. These arguments identify indeterminacy, fairness and incentive effects as the major reasons for using lotteries to make decisions. These arguments are central to Jon Elster?s study of lottery use, Solomonic judgments (1989), and so the paper focuses upon their treatment in this work. Upon closer examination, all three argum...\n\nA Case Study of Different Types of Arguments Emerging from Explorations in an Interactive Computerized Environment\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLavy, Ilana\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a description of the different types of arguments that emerged as two students, working in a computerized environment, engaged in an investigation of several number theory concepts.

It gives a good approximation in terms of the Dunkl-type Bessel function of type A_{Nâ1} with multiplicity k_2. For certain values of k_2 an improved estimate is obtained from a corresponding limit relation for Bessel functions on matrix cones.\n\nThe argumentative impact of causal relations\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNielsen, Anne Ellerup\n\n1996-01-01\n\nsuch as causality, explanation and justification.

According to my account, a counterconsideration is part of a critical reaction from a real or imagined opponent, and an arguer may take it into account in his argument in at least six fully responsive ways. Conductive arguments (or: pro and con arguments, balance of con-siderations arguments will be characterized as one of these types. In this manner, the paper aims to show how conducive, and related kinds of argument can be understood dialogically.\n\nOn the use of functional calculus for phase-type and related distributions\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBladt, Mogens; Campillo Navarro, Azucena; Nielsen, Bo Friis\n\nof matrices.

Over the years, many studies have been conducted on constructing arguments in science teaching, but only few of them have dealt with studying argumentation in the laboratory. Our research focuses on the process in which students construct arguments in the chemistry laboratory while conducting various types of experiments. It was found that inquiry experiments have the potential to serve as an effective platform for formulating arguments, owing to the features of this learning environment. The discourse during inquiry-type experiments was found to be rich in arguments, whereas that during confirmatory-type experiments was found to be sparse in arguments. The arguments, which were developed during the discourse of an open inquiry experiment, focus on the hypothesis-building stage, analysis of the results, and drawing appropriate conclusions.\n\nThe argument from moral psychology\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMilevski, Voin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe argument from moral psychology is one of the strongest arguments that non-cognitivists use against cognitivism-the metaethical position according to which our moral judgements express beliefs. According to this argument, once we put together the Humean theory of motivation and motivational internalism, we yield the conclusion that cognitivism cannot represent the correct view about the semantic function of moral discourse.

The data corpus is composed of 132 argumentative discussions selected from 30 video-recorded meals of 10 middle to upper-middle-class Swiss and Italian families. Data are presented through discursive excerpts of argumentative discussions and analysed by the pragma-dialectical ideal model of critical discussion. The findings show that when parents advance context-bound arguments such as the arguments of quality (e.g., very good, salty, or not good and quantity (e.g., too little, quite enough, or too much of food, the arguments advanced by children mirror the same types of arguments previously used by parents. On the other hand, when parents advance more complex, elaborated, and context-unbound arguments such as the appeal to consistency's argument, the argument from authority and the argument from analogy, the children typically did not advance any argument, but their response is an expression of further doubt or a mere opposition without providing any argument. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the types of children's responses are strictly connected to the type of argument previously advanced by their parents. This aspect is particularly relevant in terms of children's capacities to engage in argumentative exchanges and to react in rational ways during the confrontation with the parents. Further research in this direction is needed in order to better understand specific potentialities of language in the everyday process of socialization within the family context.\n\nArgumentative Bluff in Eristic Discussion : An Analysis and Evaluation\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nvan Laar, Jan Albert\n\nHow does the analysis and evaluation of argumentation depend on the dialogue type in which the argumentation has been put forward?

This basic neuroscience question remains unsettled despite many decades of research. Classification schemes have been proposed based on anatomical, electrophysiological, or molecular properties. However, different schemes do not always agree with each other. This raises the question of whether one can classify neurons based on their function directly. For example, among sensory neurons, can a classification scheme be devised that is based on their role in encoding sensory stimuli? Here, theoretical arguments are outlined for how this can be achieved using information theory by looking at optimal numbers of cell types and paying attention to two key properties: correlations between inputs and noise in neural responses. This theoretical framework could help to map the hierarchical tree relating different neuronal classes within and across species. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, in a previous study, we found that discourse goals (persuasion vs. consensus) while arguing can affect student outcomes in both content learning and reasoning. In this study, we look at argumentative discourse data from a previous study to ask how differences in discourse might account for the differences we observed in learning and reasoning outcomes. One hundred and five dialogues (57 disputative, 48 consensus) between 7th grade science students attending a public high school near Tarragona, Spain. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions and paired with peers who disagreed with them on three topics related to renewable energy sources. After instruction on each topic, they were asked to either 'argue to convince' (persuasion condition) or 'argue to reach consensus' (consensus condition) on that topic. Conversations were audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis. Students in the persuasion condition engaged in shorter conversational exchanges around argumentative claims and were more likely to use moves that foreclosed discussion, whereas students in the consensus condition were more likely to use moves that elicited, elaborated on, and integrated their partners' ideas. When arguing to reach - rather than defend - a conclusion, students are more likely to coconstruct knowledge by exchanging and integrating arguments. These findings are consistent with predictions about the potential of argumentation for knowledge building and suggest that teachers must attend to discourse goals when using argumentation to support learning and reasoning.

It is important for medical students to engage in the HDR process through argumentation during their small group discussions in PBL. This study aimed to analyze the quality of preclinical medical students' argumentation according to each phase of HDR in PBL. Participants were 15 first-year preclinical students divided into two small groups. A set of three 2-hour discussion sessions from each of the two groups during a 1-week-long PBL unit on the cardiovascular system was audio-recorded. The arguments constructed by the students were analyzed using a coding scheme, which included four types of argumentation (Type 0: incomplete, Type 1: claim only, Type 2: claim with data, and Type 3: claim with data and warrant). The mean frequency of each type of argumentation according to each HDR phase across the two small groups was calculated. During small group discussions, Type 1 arguments were generated most often (frequency=120.5, 43%), whereas the least common were Type 3 arguments (frequency=24.5, 8.7%) among the four types of arguments. The results of this study revealed that the students predominantly made claims without proper justifications; they often omitted data for supporting their claims or did not provide warrants to connect the claims and data. The findings suggest instructional interventions to enhance the quality of medical students' arguments in PBL, including promoting students' comprehension of the structure of argumentation for HDR processes and questioning.\n\nLexical categories and argument structure : a study with reference to Sakha\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nVinokurova, N.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis dissertation presents a model of lexical category determination based on properties of argument structure.

Inoculation theory and the model of belief processing provide insights into cognition that stand to increase our understanding of how patients process the information presented in these advertisements and form beliefs about medications. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sidedness of appeals and argument types in understanding beliefs that are formed after exposure to advertisements. DTCA and negative experiences were used to study these constructs. A 2 (1-sided vs 2-sided appeals) x 2 (causal vs authoritative arguments) factorial study design was used. A total of 263 undergraduate students were assigned to view 1 of the 4 mock flu-medication advertisements and complete a questionnaire. Subjects were then presented with a negative scenario and were asked to fill out a questionnaire based on the information in the ad and in the negative scenario. The dependent measures included belief change, change in intent to inquire, and standardized price change. Data were analyzed using 2-way analysis of variance. Subjects exposed to 2-sided appeals showed lower belief change, standardized price change, and change in intent to inquire following a negative experience than subjects exposed to 1-sided appeals (Pappeal and argument type on initial belief and initial intent to inquire. Some support for aspects of inoculation theory and theory of belief formation was found. The findings suggest that complying with the \"fair-balance\" requirement may be beneficial to pharmaceutical marketers as 2-sided appeals increase the tenacity of consumers' beliefs. Higher initial belief and intent to inquire when causal arguments are used in 2-sided promotional messages suggest that use of data to substantiate claims in advertisements may result in enhanced beliefs about the merits of advertised medication.\n\nThe Impact of Argumentativeness on Resistance to Persuasion.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKazoleas, Dean\n\n1993-01-01\n\nExamines the impact of argumentativeness on cognitive responses and attitude change of undergraduate college students.

The theory of rhetoric, the main object of which is discourse not only in narrow meaning (as verbal expression of ideas (i.e. to say text, but also in broad meaning â as a communicative act between the addresser and the addressee since its interdisciplinary nature provides the right tools to explore the advertising discourse. The theory of rhetoric is successfully applied in development of advertising discourse, because it helps to foresee the communicative act between the addresser and the addressee. Advertising and rhetoric are combined by many common elements, but the same goal is the most important: both, rhetoric and advertising seek for persuasion through verbal and non-verbal measures. The paper deals with the analysis of the inventive level of advertising discourse, i.e., eristic arguments, spread of ways of proofing / persuasion. Eristic argumentation is a dominant argumentation type in advertising. This method of persuasion is a way to create truth visibility although it is just superficial. The most typical schemes of eristic argumentation used in advertising are as follows: argumentum ad vanitatem (appeal to the vanity of the addressee, argumentum ad verecundiam (appeal to the authority, argumentum baculinum (method of âwhipâ argument, argumentum ad novitatem (appeal to novelty.

Morozova\n\n2013-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper describes the results of a study of functions of argumentation in solving conflicting situations of social interaction, with the participation of younger students (III and IV grade, middle school students (V and VII grade and high school students (X classes, 211 students overall. The starting point of the research was the idea that distress occurring in a contradictory situation, does not relieve externally, but requires a structural analysis of the situation and a decision from the subject. The hypothesis of the study was the assumption that the argument used by the subject in a situation, can have opposite functions: a real change in the situation or a formal removal of contradictions in order to reduce stress. The author notes that overcoming the contradictions is linked inevitably to the need to clarify the rules of interaction between the parties, and this in turn puts the subject under certain psychological risk (the risk of criticism, disapproval or punishment, the risk of loss of secondary benefits of ambiguous situation, etc. that impede productive action in a contradictory situation.\n\nRevisiting the argument from fetal potential\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nManninen Bertha\n\n2007-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract One of the most famous, and most derided, arguments against the morality of abortion is the argument from potential, which maintains that the fetus' potential to become a person and enjoy the valuable life common to persons, entails that its destruction is prima facie morally impermissible. In this paper, I will revisit and offer a defense of the argument from potential. First, I will criticize the classical arguments proffered against the importance of fetal potential, specifically the arguments put forth by philosophers Peter Singer and David Boonin, by carefully unpacking the claims made in these arguments and illustrating why they are flawed. Secondly, I will maintain that fetal potential is morally relevant when it comes to the morality of abortion, but that it must be accorded a proper place in the argument. This proper place, however, cannot be found until we first answer a very important and complex question: we must first address the issue of personal identity, and when the fetus becomes the type of being who is relevantly identical to a future person. I will illustrate why the question of fetal potential can only be meaningfully addressed after we have first answered the question of personal identity and how it relates to the human fetus.\n\nArgumentative Bluff in Eristic Discussion: An Analysis and Evaluation\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nvan Laar, Jan Albert\n\n2010-01-01\n\nHow does the analysis and evaluation of argumentation depend on the dialogue type in which the argumentation has been put forward? This paper focuses on argumentative bluff in eristic discussion. Argumentation cannot be presented without conveying the pretence that it is dialectically reasonable, as well as, at least to some degree, rhetorically effective. Within eristic discussion it can be profitable to engage in bluff with respect to such claims. However, it will be argued that such bluffi...\n\n(Non-)Arguments in Long-Distance Extractions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNyvad, Anne Mette; Kizach, Johannes; Christensen, Ken RamshÃ¸j\n\n2015-10-01\n\nPrevious research has shown that in fully grammatical sentences, response time increases and acceptability decreases when the filler in a long-distance extraction is incompatible with the matrix verb. This effect could potentially be due to a difference between argument and adjunct extraction. In this paper we investigate the effect of long extraction of arguments and adjuncts where incompatibility is kept constant. Based on the results from two offline surveys and an online experiment, we argue that the argument/adjunct asymmetry in terms of acceptability is due to differences in processing difficulty, but that both types of extraction involve the same intermediate attachment sites in the online processing.\n\nDen argumentative teksttype i reklamer\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNielsen, Anne Ellerup\n\n1998-01-01\n\n- and macropropositions, it is a multicriterial model which takes into account both the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features of texts. However, the model seems to offer some problems in establishing the limits between the argumentative and the descriptive text type. This imprecision is apparently due to the lack...... of distinction between the discourse potential of evaluative and referential propositions. This problem will be demonstrated on examples from the genre of advertising material which, because of its persuasive purpose, is particularly rich in argumentative features....\n\nHardy's argument and successive spin-s measurements\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAhanj, Ali\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe consider a hidden-variable theoretic description of successive measurements of noncommuting spin observables on an input spin-s state.

However, few studies have specifically investigated the influences of motivational factors on argument evaluation. This study examined theÂ effects of defence and accuracy motivations on argument evaluation. According to the compatibility between the advocated positions of arguments and participants' prior beliefs and the objective strength of arguments, participants evaluated four types of arguments: compatible-strong, compatible-weak, incompatible-strong, and incompatible-weak arguments. Experiment 1 revealed that participants possessing a high defence motivation rated compatible-weak arguments as stronger and incompatible-strong ones as weaker than participants possessing a low defence motivation. However, the strength ratings between the high and low defence groups regarding both compatible-strong and incompatible-weak arguments were similar. Experiment 2 revealed that when participants possessed a high accuracy motivation, they rated compatible-weak arguments as weaker and incompatible-strong ones as stronger than when they possessed a low accuracy motivation. However, participants' ratings on both compatible-strong and incompatible-weak arguments were similar when comparing high and low accuracy conditions. The results suggest that defence and accuracy motivations are two major motives influencing argument evaluation. However, they primarily influence the evaluation results for compatible-weak and incompatible-strong arguments, but not for compatible-strong and incompatible-weak arguments.

The second objective concerns the functioning of the selected genre of discourse: the paper examines how, through procedures of framing, obliteration of the enunciative modality, ellipses, etc., media discourse sets up an âargumentative dimensionâ (Amossy 2000. Although not overtly intended for persuasion, media discourse nevertheless sets out to act upon the readerâs beliefs and representations.

Even within a public health context, much is now known about how these arguments work to gain the publicâs compliance with health recommendations. Notwithstanding this level of interest in, and examination of, these arguments, there is one aspect of these arguments that still remains unexplored. That aspect concerns the heuristic function of these arguments within our thinking about public health problems. Specifically, it is argued that threat and fear appeal arguments serve as valuable shortcuts in our reasoning, particularly when that reasoning is subject to biases that are likely to diminish the effectiveness of public health messages. To this extent, they are rationally warranted argument forms rather than fallacies, as has been their dominant characterization in logic.\n\nTraveling waves in a diffusive predator-prey model with holling type-III functional response\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLi Wantong; Wu Shiliang\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe establish the existence of traveling wave solutions and small amplitude traveling wave train solutions for a reaction-diffusion system based on a predator-prey model with Holling type-III functional response.

This article presents an alternative approach, as it empirically evaluates the quality of petitionersâ legal argumentation within the context of abstract constitutional review proceedings. The quality of legal argumentation is herein defined as the ability of the petitioner to (i identify the challenged norm and the potentially infringed constitutional norm, (ii present clear and coherent arguments, and (iii justify its arguments upon legal sources, such as jurisprudential precedents or legal doctrine. Original data on forty lawsuits presented before the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court between 2008 and 2016 is used to test whether legal argumentation determines the outcome of a decision. A novel measure of the overall quality of argumentation and strength of cases brought before the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court by both public and private parties is also developed in the form of an expert survey. The main findings suggest that plaintiffsâ legal argumentation quality does not determine the outcome of the final decision of the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court, but rather the type of plaintiff (public or private does.\n\nExamining Elementary Students' Development of Oral and Written Argumentation Practices Through Argument-Based Inquiry\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Ying-Chih; Hand, Brian; Park, Soonhye\n\n2016-05-01\n\nArgumentation, and the production of scientific arguments are critical elements of inquiry that are necessary for helping students become scientifically literate through engaging them in constructing and critiquing ideas. This case study employed a mixed methods research design to examine the development in 5th grade students' practices of oral and written argumentation from one unit to another over 16 weeks utilizing the science writing heuristic approach. Data sources included five rounds of whole-class discussion focused on group presentations of arguments that occurred over eleven class periods; students' group writings; interviews with six target students and the teacher; and the researcher's field notes. The results revealed five salient trends in students' development of oral and written argumentative practices over time: (1) Students came to use more critique components as they participated in more rounds of whole-class discussion focused on group presentations of arguments; (2) by challenging each other's arguments, students came to focus on the coherence of the argument and the quality of evidence; (3) students came to use evidence to defend, support, and reject arguments; (4) the quality of students' writing continuously improved over time; and (5) students connected oral argument skills to written argument skills as they had opportunities to revise their writing after debating and developed awareness of the usefulness of critique from peers. Given the development in oral argumentative practices and the quality of written arguments over time, this study indicates that students' development of oral and written argumentative practices is positively related to each other. This study suggests that argumentative practices should be framed through both a social and epistemic understanding of argument-utilizing talk and writing as vehicles to create norms of these complex practices.\n\nHypothetical identities : Explanatory problems for the explanatory argument\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nEronen, Markus I.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRecently, several philosophers have defended an explanatory argument that supposedly provides novel empirical grounds for accepting the type identity theory of phenomenal consciousness.

Croft 2001; Langacker 1987; Aarts 2007. It argues that argumenthood is not wholly a property of a lexical head predicate and that a purely lexically based projectionist approach to syntactic argument structures cannot be maintained. It also explores the effect that the interplay between relevant properties of locatives has on their recruitability as arguments, and a novel argument-index analysis is proposed as a means to distinguish adjuncts from arguments. The analysis makes use of both general and language-specific morphosyntactic and morphosemantic tests. Investigation of locative-related roles reveals that certain properties determine their status in the argument-adjunct continuum: thematic, individuated and animate locatives are more argument-like than non-thematic, inanimate and general deictic locatives (in line with Kittila 2007, 2008; Peterson 2007. Interplay between these properties is shown to affect argument recruitment in Balinese, based on the value of the argument index for a given locative-related role. More generally, there also is evidence that languages vary in whether they allow true adjuncts to be recruited as arguments at all.\n\nTwo-sided messages for health risk prevention: the role of argument type, refutation, and issue ambivalence.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCornelis, Erlinde; Cauberghe, Veroline; De Pelsmacker, Patrick\n\n2013-06-01\n\nTwo experiments were conducted among adolescents in 2011 in urban parts of Belgium, Europe.

Yet, in everyday debates people use arguments that seem valid in light of such rules but nonetheless biased and tendentious. This article seeks to show that the rationality of argumentation can only be fully promoted if we take into account its ethical dimension. To substantiate this claim, I review some of the empirical evidence indicating that peopleâs inferential reasoning is systematically affected by a variety of biases and heuristics. Insofar as these cognitive illusions are typically unintentional, it appears that arguers may be biased despite their well-intended efforts to follow the rules of critical argumentation. Nevertheless, I argue that people remain responsible for the rationality of their arguments, given that there are a number of measures that they can (and ought to take to avoid such distortions. I highlight the importance of argumentational virtues and critical thinking to rational debates, and describe a set of indirect strategies of âargumentative self-controlâ.\n\nExplanation can cause Forgetting: Memory Dynamics in the Generation of New Arguments.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSoares, Julia S; Storm, Benjamin C\n\n2017-10-01\n\nRetrieval-induced forgetting is observed when the retrieval of target information causes the forgetting of nontarget information. The present study investigated whether similar dynamics occur in the context of generating arguments in the process of explanation. Participants studied arguments associated with several issues before attempting to think of new arguments pertaining to a subset of those issues. When given a later memory test, participants were less likely to recall the studied arguments if they had attempted to think of new arguments than if they had not. This argument-induced forgetting effect was observed regardless of whether participants attempted to generate arguments that either agreed or disagreed with the position of the arguments they studied. The effect was significantly reduced, however, and even numerically reversed, when participants generated arguments that were highly related to the studied arguments. This finding fits well with previous research on retrieval-induced forgetting, which has shown that the retrieval or generation of new information fails to cause the forgetting of old information when the two types of information are well integrated or semantically associated.\n\nCommunication of geo-scientific safety arguments\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFlavelle, P.; Goodwin, B.; Jensen, M.; Linden, R.; Mazurek, M.; Srivastave, M.; Strom, A.; Sudicky, E.; Voinis, S.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWorking Group B addressed the communication of geo-scientific safety arguments through a discussion of practical experience as it related to the methods, types of information and specific arguments found to best communicate geo-scientific concepts and notions of safety with broad audiences including, colleagues, authorities and regulators, political decision makers, academics, and the general public. The following questions were suggested by the programme committee of the AMIGO-2 workshop for discussion by Working Group B with respect to the communication of geo-scientific information and safety arguments: - What is the place of geo-scientific arguments in relation to quantitative and qualitative topics like scenario and FEPs (features, events, processes) assessment, simulated repository evolution, calculated dose or risk impacts, engineering tests of materials, etc., when presenting a safety case to different audiences and with respect to the various stages of the repository programme? (see section 3). - Would we be better off focusing messages to the public on time scales of a few hundred years or a few generations? (see section 4). - How do you handle the fact that geoscience interpretations seldom are unique and data often are open to various interpretations? (see section 5). - How do you handle expert controversy on a specific topic? (see section 6).

Functionalist accounts (such as those by Groefsema and NÃ©meth T. which are couched in a relevance-theoretic framework have repeatedly claimed that this phenomenon is fundamentally dependent on dis-course-interpretational factors. In particular, it has been stated that implicit arguments can be used in Hungarian in a rather unrestricted way, and their occurrence is only limited by considerations of interpretability. We argue against both of these positions and try to show that cross-linguistic data can assist in revealing the circular nature and ultimate inadequacy of existing functional accounts of implicit argument licensing.\n\nFunctional unparsing\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nDanvy, Olivier\n\n2000-01-01\n\nA string-formatting function such as printf in C seemingly requires dependent types, because its control string determines the rest of its arguments.

Â Â When we put together different expositions of the argument from primordial nature and the argument from general consensus we reach to a general principle which constitutes the foundation of both arguments; i.e. the existence of a common sense in all human individuals in all times and places. To put it differently, both argument are founded on the idea that there is an inborn disposition in man which pushes him/her toward the Supreme and this disposition has existed in all times and places. But when we analyze the theories one by one we become aware of the slightest differences and similarities. Â Â It seems that the second type biological expositions are nearer to the exposition of argument from primordial nature based on correlation. We mean those expositions which regard the generality of belief in God an indication of a primordial disposition toward God. The first type of expositions which interpret the enthusiasm for God in terms of instinctual needs cannot be an indication of primordial nature; since primordial nature is an exclusive faculty of humanity. Of course it is also noteworthy that the primordial nature to which the argument from the general consensus refers is a potentiality which needs to be actualized while Islamic thought suggests that primordial nature exists in all human individuals in a fulfilled form even if it is neglected now and then. Â Â As to anti-skepticistic expositions we have to say that this exposition has one premise to the effect that all human beings who believe in God have accepted his existence in a rational way; particularly James Joyce who is the main proponent of this exposition believes that all human beings are open to their creator due to the decisive and clear call of reason. Thus it seems that this exposition of the argument from general consensus is similar to the third form of the argument from primordial nature; since in both the infallibility of\n\nArgument Construction in Understanding Noncovalent Interactions: A Comparison of Two Argumentation Frameworks\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCooper, A.

In other words, the subject that the speaker is going to debate, a subject which falls within the whole set of ideas and opinions shared by his/her possible or real interlocutors at the moment Ti will take the form of an argumentation. A special relationship is established between the speaker and the message recipient, as well as between the former â also called argument providing subject (âsujet argumentantâ by certain researchers â and his/her words, of whose validity he/she must convince the latter, the target audience. In order for the argumentation to succeed, the speaker must carefully mark his/her position regarding the words he/she employs, as well as regarding the value of the arguments mobilized. It is precisely on these levels that the importance of modality becomes manifest, thus contributing to the success of argument phrasing (âmise en argumentationâ. How can modality prove useful for argument phrasing? On what levels is it involved in the process of argumentation and how is it achieved? Such is the subject we attempt to develop starting from a message of a particular type: a revealing fragment, in our opinion, taken from a literary text.\n\nA Reinforcement Learning Approach to Improve the Argument Selection Effectiveness in Argumentation-based Negotiation\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAmandi, Analia Adriana; Monteserin, Ariel JosÃ©\n\n2016-01-01\n\nArgument selection is considered the essence of the strategy in argumentation-based negotiation. An agent, which is arguing during a negotiation, must decide what arguments are the best to persuade the opponent. In fact, in each negotiation step, the agent must select an argument from a set of candidate arguments by applying some selection policy. Following this policy, the agent observes some factors of the negotiation context, for instance: trust in the opponent and expected utility of the...\n\nThe Ethics of Argumentation\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nVasco Correia\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNormative theories of argumentation tend to assume that logical and dialectical rules suffice to ensure the rationality of argumentative discourse. Yet, in everyday debates people use arguments that seem valid in light of such rules but nonetheless biased and tendentious. This article seeks to show that the rationality of argumentation can only be fully promoted if we take into account its ethical dimension. To substantiate this claim, I review some of the empirical evidence indicating that p...\n\nArgumentation in undergraduate chemistry laboratories\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWalker, Joi Phelps\n\nTo address the need for reform in undergraduate science education a new instructional model called Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) was developed and then implemented in a undergraduate chemistry course at a community college in the southeastern United States (Sampson, Walker, & Grooms, 2009; Walker, Sampson, & Zimmerman, in press). The ADI instructional model is designed to give a more central place to argumentation and the role of argument in the social construction of scientific knowledge. This research investigated the growth in the quality of the student generated arguments and the scientific argumentation that took place over the course of a semester. Students enrolled in two sections of General Chemistry I laboratory at the community college participated in this study. The students worked in collaborative groups of three or four. The students were given a variation of the same performance task three times during the semester in order to measure individual ability to use evidence and justify their choice of evidence with appropriate rationale. Five ADI investigations took place during the semester and the laboratory reports for each were collected from each student and the argument section of each report was scored. All the student groups were video recorded five times during the semester as they generated and evaluated arguments and the quality of the group argumentation was assessed using an instrument called the Assessment of Scientific Argumentation in the Classroom (ASAC) observation protocol. As time was the independent variable in this study a repeated measure ANOVA was used to evaluate the significance of student improvement in each area (argumentation, written argument and performance task) over the course of the semester (Trochim, 1999). In addition, a multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate how well the ASAC scores predicted individual scores on both the performance task and the written arguments (Green & Salkind, 2005).

Engaging science in such problems often entails evaluating available evidence for given arguments. This study explores how students use inscriptions as evidence to argue about socioscientific issues. Fifth- and sixth-grade students (N = 102) in two intact classrooms completed written argument tasks in which they were asked to cite given inscriptions to support their decisions about energy use or genetically modified organisms. Qualitative content analyses of these written arguments, which focused on the coordination between inscriptions and claims, show three patterns of rhetorical use of inscriptions: seeing is believing, believing is seeing, and asserting is inferring. What counts as evidence was not the inscriptions per se, but the rhetorical functions they performed in particular arguments. These findings suggest that justifying socioscientific decisions is functionally different from explaining scientific phenomena. Linking these two activities in school may help students more productively engage with science in their everyday lives.\n\nArgumentation Theory.

When such agents engage in argument, they would be expected to argue strategically in such a way that makes it more likely for their argumentative goals to be achieved. What we mean by arguing strategically is that instead of making arbitrary arguments, an agent would carefully choose its argumentative moves in order to further its own objectives.\n\nDen gode argumentations anatomi\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nKock, Christian Erik J\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGod argumentation har tre dimensioner: Den er faktuelt retvisende, den er relevant, og den er vÃ¦gtig.

A quasi-experimental design with sixth and seventh grade students taught by two teachers was used. A total of 170 students participated in the study, with 87 in the control group (four classes) and 83 in the treatment group (four classes). All students used the SWH templates as an argumentative writing to guide their written work and completed these templates during the SWH investigations of each unit. After completing the SWH investigations, both groups of students were asked to complete the summary writing task as an explanatory writing at the end of each unit. All students' writing samples were scored using analytical frameworks developed for the study. The results indicated that the treatment group performed significantly better on the explanatory writing task than the control group. In addition, the results of the partial correlation suggested that there is a very strong significantly positive relationship between the argumentative writing and the explanatory writing.\n\nUsing Computer-Assisted Argumentation Mapping to develop effective argumentation skills in high school advanced placement physics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHeglund, Brian\n\nEducators recognize the importance of reasoning ability for development of critical thinking skills, conceptual change, metacognition, and participation in 21st century society. There is a recognized need for students to improve their skills of argumentation, however, argumentation is not explicitly taught outside logic and philosophy---subjects that are not part of the K-12 curriculum. One potential way of supporting the development of argumentation skills in the K-12 context is through incorporating Computer-Assisted Argument Mapping to evaluate arguments. This quasi-experimental study tested the effects of such argument mapping software and was informed by the following two research questions: 1. To what extent does the collaborative use of Computer-Assisted Argumentation Mapping to evaluate competing theories influence the critical thinking skill of argument evaluation, metacognitive awareness, and conceptual knowledge acquisition in high school Advanced Placement physics, compared to the more traditional method of text tables that does not employ Computer-Assisted Argumentation Mapping? 2. What are the student perceptions of the pros and cons of argument evaluation in the high school Advanced Placement physics environment? This study examined changes in critical thinking skills, including argumentation evaluation skills, as well as metacognitive awareness and conceptual knowledge, in two groups: a treatment group using Computer-Assisted Argumentation Mapping to evaluate physics arguments, and a comparison group using text tables to evaluate physics arguments. Quantitative and qualitative methods for collecting and analyzing data were used to answer the research questions. Quantitative data indicated no significant difference between the experimental groups, and qualitative data suggested students perceived pros and cons of argument evaluation in the high school Advanced Placement physics environment, such as self-reported sense of improvement in argument\n\nDefining Rhetorical Argumentation\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nKock, Christian Erik J\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis article argues for a definition of rhetorical argumentation based on the theme of the argumentation, i.e., the issue in dispute - rather than its aim (e.g., to âwinâ) or its means (e.g., emotional appeals). The principal thinkers in the rhetorical tradition, from Aristotle onwards, saw...... rhetoric as practical reasoning, i.e., reasoning on proposals for action or choice, not on propositions that may be either true or false.

Roughly, the Continuity Argument seeks to show that if we are not disposed to reject the established technology, then features that this technology share with synthetic biology cannot provide reasons to find it ethically problematic.

Although in the absence of rational debate our legal, political, and scientific systems would not be possible, there is still no integrated area of research on the psychology of argumentation. Furthermore, classical theories of argumentation are normative (i.e. the acceptability of an argument is determined by a set of norms or logical rules, which sometimes creates a dissociation between the theories and peopleâs behavior. We think the current challenge for psychology is to bring together the cognitive and normative accounts of argumentation. In this Perspective, we exemplify this point by analyzing two cases of argumentative structures experimentally studied in the context of cognitive psychology. Specifically, we focus on the slippery slope argument and the ad hominem argument under the frameworks of Bayesian and pragma-dialectics approaches, respectively. We think employing more descriptive and experimental accounts of argumentation would help Psychology to bring closer the cognitive and normative accounts of argumentation with the final goal of establishing an integrated area of research on the psychology of argumentation.\n\nToward an experimental account of argumentation: the case of the slippery slope and the ad hominem arguments.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLillo-Unglaube, Marco; Canales-Johnson, AndrÃ©s; Navarrete, Gorka; Bravo, Claudio Fuentes\n\n2014-01-01\n\nArgumentation is a crucial component of our lives.

In this essay, I argue that the appeal of Big Data is not a function of computational power, but of a synergistic relationship between aesthetic order and a politics evacuated of a meaningful public deliberation. Understanding, and challenging, Big Data requires an attention to the aesthetics of data visualization and the ways in which those aesthetics would seem to depoliticize information. The conclusion proposes an alternative argumentative aesthetic as the appropriate response to the depoliticization posed by the popular imaginary of Big Data.\n\nThe great slippery-slope argument.\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBurgess, J A\n\n1993-01-01\n\nWhenever some form of beneficent killing--for example, voluntary euthanasia--is advocated, the proposal is greeted with a flood of slippery-slope arguments warning of the dangers of a Nazi-style slide into genocide.

Therefore, many computer-based tools or argumentation systems have been developed to assist students in their acquisition of argumentation skills. While the argumentation systems incorporating online debating tools present a good resource in formal settings, there is limited research revealing what argumentative skills students are portraying in informal online settings without the presence of a moderator.
