It also attracts tourists for the first sunrise of the year. Besides the spectacular view, many visitors believe that witnessing the sunrise from the sacred mountain will bring prosperity – for at least one lifetime.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nNew Year countdown in Pattani marred by insurgency attacks\n\nPhetchabun hilltop temple heaves with devotees on New Year's Eve\n\nChiang Mai welcomes 2023 with prayers, lanterns and dazzling pyrotechnics"
