At the back, 30 metres from the broken staircase at the steep cliff. The area is a\n\ntrapezium with an area of approximately 150 rais. The officials would be led by General Praphas\n\nCharusathien, Minister of Interior, in their travel to mark the limit, build up a fence and lower the\n\nth\n\nnational flag from the flag pole and out of the Temple area on 15 of this month.\n\nWhen asked how Cambodia would access the Temple, General Thanom said there is only one\n\nway which is the broken staircase on the cliff which can be repaired or done otherwise by\n\nCambodia. Concerning the news that Cambodia would let France to be caretaker of the Temple,\n\nit is up to Cambodia.

They are in the state\n\nof being “marooned”, cut off from their main forces, as Viet-Cong has cut their supply route.\n\nThe Khmer soldiers have to help themselves mostly. The conditions are poor. Foods are\n\noccasionally given by the Thai authorities. Once in a while, plane from Phnom Penh would fly\n\nover to drop supplies. But they do not meet the demands of the soldiers who have moved their\n\nfamilies up with them. Khmer currency that they have, are not accepted at the market and needs\n\nto be exchanged into US dollar at the US Consulate in Ubonratchatani. The worst of all is the\n\nsoldiers’ children, who are suffering from smallpox.\n\nA reporter reported on 22 March that at around 10.30 am of 20 March, Special Pol. Col.\n\nChaiyasit Seksit, Commander of 3rd Area Provincial Police, Nakorn Ratchasima Province\n\ntogether with Pol. Lt. Col. Sompas Kumprapan, Superintendent of Si Sa Ket Provincial Police, ,\n\nCapt. Manit Nitsayan, Inspector of Provincial Police, Kantharalak district, travelled by car to\n\ninspect the defence line at Kantharalak district to find ways to strengthen the preventive strategy\n\nagainst infiltration of the opposition. Commander of 3rd Area Provincial Police visited Phum\n\nSrol camp, which is the location of Border Patrol Police Division 2, Sub-Division of 3rd Area\n\nProvincial Police, and had a confidential meeting with Pol. Lt. Poon Pochan, Border Patrol\n\nPolice Captain, in order to deploy reinforcement in the ten areas prone to infiltration. The\n\nmeeting lasted about 1 hour. Commander of 3rd Area Provincial Police then travelled to the\n\nlocation of special force unit and border patrol police at the Thai-Khmer coordination point,\n\nKhao Phra Viharn, and went up Khao Phra Viharn to meet Maj. Kim SaKol, chief of the Khao\n\nPhra Viharn Khmer guards, then returned on the same day.\n\n“Dailynews” met up with Maj. Kim Sakol, who revealed to our reporter that, at present,\n\nhis unit is in a very bad situation since they are completely cut off from the main forces after\n\nViet-Cong had attacked Chom Ksan district. Maj. Duangsak, district sheriff and commander of\n\nbattalion 35 died in last July. This had led to the forces on Khao Phra Viharn being cut off from\n\nthis battalion. Later, the last stronghold at Pa Pai district, 4 km. from Khao Phra Viharn, was lost\n\nto Viet-Cong. Every route of connecting with Phnom Penh was cut off. Being completely cut off\n\nlike this has caused the Khmer soliders on Khao Phra Viharn to be marooned since then. Every\n\nsoldier has to rely on himself.\n\nOn the issue of supplies, sometimes help is brought up by the Thai authorities or plane\n\nfrom Phnom Penh dropped food supplies, however it was infrequent and with no set schedule.\n\nSoldiers on Khao Phra Viharn have brought up their families. So when faced with scarcity, it\n\naffects women and children too. And there is another problem looming, as the soldiers’ children\n\nare suffering from smallpox and it is spreading fast.\n\n493Annex 83\n\nMaj. Kim Sakol said that the soldiers on Khao Phra Viharn have some coins in Khmer\n\ncurrency with them, but cannot be used to buy goods from the Thai market to relieve scarcity.\n\nMerchants did not accept their money claiming that they do not a place to exchange it and do not\n\nknow of the rate. The situation is grave as if their money is worthless. Some were sent to Ubon\n\nRatchatani to negotiate with American consul to exchange money, with unsatisfactory result.\n\n494Annex 83\n\n495496 Annex 84\n\nChao Thai Newspaper, 27 October 1971,\n\n“Thai and Khmer joined forces”\n\n497Annex 84\n\n498 Annex 84\n\n(Translation)\n\nChao Thai 27 October 1971\n\nThai and Khmer joined forces\n\nViet Cong sent troops to the border to seize Khao Phra Viharn and clashed heavily with\n\nThai forces.

The location of this group of Viet-Cong had 30 bags\n\nof rice and civilians in the area of Chom Ksan district were ordered to stock up food, in order to\n\nattack and capture Khao Phra Viharn area.\n\nAt present, Khmer Rouge at Chom Ksan district comprises women and men, well trained\n\nin arms combat. These men and women had been home guards during day time in the past.

IBRU’s work is interdisciplinary in approach and global in\n\nscope, integrating theory and practice in order to provide: (i) practical expertise\n\nin boundary-making, border management and territorial dispute resolution; and\n\n(ii) academic leadership in the study of boundaries and their impact on\n\ninternational relations and borderland development. It was the world’s first\n\nboundary research centre and it remains a unique resource for scholars and\n\npractitioners.\n\nAlastair Macdonald spent his whole career as a professional surveyor in the\n\nservice of the UK g overnment.
