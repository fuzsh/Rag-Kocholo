Phou Xieng Thong National Protected Area in Laos is on the opposite side of the river.For the nature lovers, this area is truly incredible nature. The park also has several examples of mushroom rocks as well as one of the largest flower field in Thailand. Sao Chiang is one sculpture of the nature. it has been produced by erosion process that taking place on the sandstone beds. the rocks were deposited by fluvial process in early cretaceous (110-125 Ma).Relatively easy bike touring to reach the park it's about 100km from the bus terminal or train station in Ubon Rachathani, the Thailand's easternmost province. It borders both Cambodia and Laos, and features virgin rainforest, stunning waterfalls, misty mountains, and wildflower blooms.From Thailand's capital city, Bangkok (Krung Thep Maha Nakorn) to Ubon Rachathani (or just call it 'ubon') it takes 9-12 hours by public bus and train."
