        "text": "This cave is the Lascaux of Ubon. This is an opportunity for a nice walk that can easily be done with the family. Once you reach the top of the cliff, you are rewarded by the magnificent scenery you discover, including the Mekong River below and a few buffaloes that have come to refresh themselves. Here is a cliff with rock paintings dating back more than 3,000 years. Turtles, elephants and some more enigmatic frescoes! Inside the caves there is also a Buddhist temple with a statue of the reclining Buddha."
