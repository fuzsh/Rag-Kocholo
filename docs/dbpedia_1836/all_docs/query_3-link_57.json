Little visited by foreign tourists, the province bordering Cambodia and Laos is dotted with mountain ranges and several national parks.\n\nUbon’s history goes back thousands of years; traces of ancient man can be found at Pha Taem National Park where rock paintings on cliffs show scenes of prehistoric life. The province’s capital city Ubon Ratchathani town is located on the banks of the Mun river, which flows into the Mekong river at the Thai - Laos border.\n\nTo do & see in Ubon Ratchathani\n\nUbon Ratchathani features a large number of Buddhist temples, several archaeological sites and historical museums, as well as natural attractions.\n\nWat Thung Si Muang\n\nThe Wat Thung Si Muang dates from the first half of the 19th century.
