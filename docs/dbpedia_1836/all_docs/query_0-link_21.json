        "text": "Title 7 Natural Resources and Environmental Control\n\n1200 Emergency Preparation and Response\n\n1200 Emergency Prevention and Response\n\n1201 Accidental Release Prevention Regulation\n\n1.0 Statement of Authority\n\n1.1 Pursuant to 7 Delaware Code, Chapter 77, the General Assembly of the State of Delaware has directed that regulations be prepared and adopted by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to require owners or operators of stationary sources having regulated substances to take actions, subject to review by the Department, to control and minimize the chances of sudden, accidental releases and catastrophic releases of such substances. The Department adopted the “Regulation for the Management of Extremely Hazardous Substances” on September 25, 1989 and modified this regulation on December 18, 1995. The “Accidental Release Prevention Regulation” replaces the “Regulation for the Management of Extremely Hazardous Substances” in its entirety.\n\n1.2 The General Assembly of the State of Delaware has also directed the Department to seek full delegation from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to administer the sections of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, “Chemical Accident Provisions” revised as of July 1, 1997 which can be delegated to the State.\n\n2.0 Purpose\n\n2.1 The purpose of this regulation is to protect lives and the health of citizens of the state living and working in the vicinity of stationary sources having regulated substances on site. This regulation is concerned with the prevention of sudden releases of regulated substances and the generation of pressure waves and thermal exposure beyond the property boundaries of the stationary source where they occur and the catastrophic health consequences caused by short-term exposures to such accidental releases. This regulation has the goal of prevention of such catastrophic events by requiring owner or operator having regulated substances on-site to take all feasible actions needed to minimize the probability of catastrophic events. It is the intent of this regulation to complement and be enforced in conjunction with other laws.\n\n2.2 It is also the secondary purpose of this regulation to adopt the necessary language to allow the Department to seek delegation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency authority for 40 CFR Part 68, “Chemical Accident Provisions” revised as of April 9, 2004 for the administration of the sections of this rule which can be delegated to the State.\n\n2.3 This regulation has two parts. The first part (consisting of Section 5) deals with adopting the federal language to allow delegation of the federal program. The second part (consisting of Section 6) uses state authority to extend beyond 40 CFR Part 68 to continue to regulate substances that were previously regulated by the Delaware “Regulation for the Management of Extremely Hazardous Substances”, as revised on December 18, 1995. The accidental release prevention activities (the prevention program or the risk management program) are the same for processes subject to either Section 5.0 or Section 6.0. Section 6.0 also contains reporting requirements for a process having regulated substances that are subject to the State criteria but not the federal criteria.\n\n3.0 Policy and General Duty\n\n3.1 It is the obligation of the owner or operator of stationary sources having regulated substances on-site to operate in a manner consistent with this regulation by developing and implementing a risk management program that anticipates and minimizes the chances of catastrophic events. The stationary source risk management program implementation shall be subject to review by the Department. It is the objective of this regulation and the programs established by this regulation to prevent accidental releases and to minimize the consequences of any such release of any substance listed in Section 5.130 or Sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 or any other extremely hazardous substance.\n\n3.2 Every person in control of or associated with any such substances (regulated or not regulated) that is produced, handled, or stored has a general duty to identify hazards which may result from such releases using appropriate hazard assessment techniques, to design and maintain a safe facility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases, and to minimize the consequences of accidental releases which do occur.\n\n4.0 Definitions\n\nAccidental release means an unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\n\nActual Distance to Stationary Source Boundary means the distance from the nearest potential release point capable of generating a sufficient quantity to the nearest public receptor.\n\nActual Quantity (AQ) means the sum of all the physical quantities of a regulated substance listed in either Section 6.2, 6.3 or 6.4 in whatever form at the maximum design capacity of the process considering administrative controls.\n\nAdministrative controls mean written procedural mechanisms used for hazard control.\n\nAdministrator means the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nAIChE/CCPS means the American Institute of Chemical Engineers/Center for Chemical Process Safety.\n\nAPI means the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nArticle means a manufactured item, as defined under 29 CFR 1910.1200(b) dated July 1, 1997, that is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture, that has end use functions dependent in whole or in part upon the shape or design during end use, and that does not release or otherwise result in exposure to a regulated substance under normal conditions of processing and use.\n\nArtificial Barricade means an artificial mound or riveted wall of earth of a minimum thickness of three feet (NFPA-495, 1996 Edition, Explanatory Notes for Table 6-4.1 “American Table of Distances”).\n\nASME means the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nBoard means the Environmental Appeals Board.\n\nCAS means the Chemical Abstracts Service.\n\nCatastrophic Event means a sudden release of a sufficient quantity of a regulated substance, a pressure wave or a thermal exposure beyond the property boundaries of a stationary source which will cause death or permanent disability to a person because of a single, short term exposure.\n\nCatastrophic release means a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion, involving one or more regulated substances that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\n\nClassified information means “classified information” as defined in the Classified Information Procedures Act, 18 U.S.C.
