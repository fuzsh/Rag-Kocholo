        "meta_description": "Abstract. Wildfires in Siberia generate large amounts of aerosols, which may be transported over long distances and pose a threat to the sensitive ecosystem of the Arctic. Particulate matter (PM) of aged wildfire plumes originating from Yakutia in August 2021 was collected in Nadym and on Bely Island (both in northwestern Siberia). An advanced analysis of the chemical composition of aerosol particles was conducted through a multi-wavelength thermalâoptical carbon analyzer (TOCA) coupled to resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (REMPI-TOFMS) as well as through ultra-high-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). In Nadym, concentrations of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) peaked at 100 and 40âÂµgâmâ3, respectively, associated with AngstrÃ¶m absorption exponents for 405 and 808ânm (AAE405/808) between 1.5 and 3.3. The weekly average on Bely Island peaked at 8.9âÂµgâmâ3 of OC and 0.3âÂµgâmâ3 of EC and AAE405/808 close to unity. In particular, ambient aerosol in Nadym had a distinct biomass burning profile with pyrolysis products from carbohydrates, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, as well as lignin and resinoic acids. However, temporarily higher concentrations of five- and six-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), different from the PAH signature of biomass burning, suggest a contribution of regional gas flaring. FT-ICR MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) revealed a complex mixture of highly functionalized compounds, containing up to 20 oxygen atoms, as well as nitrogen- and sulfur-containing moieties. Concentrations of biomass burning markers on Bely Island were substantially lower than in Nadym, flanked by the appearance of unique compounds with higher oxygen content, higher molecular weight, and lower aromaticity. Back-trajectory analysis and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth suggested long-range transport of aerosol from the center of a Yakutian wildfire plume to Nadym and from the plume periphery to Bely Island. Owing to lower aerosol concentrations in the plume periphery than in its center, it is demonstrated how dilution affects the chemical plume composition during atmospheric aging.",

The cut-off was influenced by both impactor design and aerosol mixture. Two key factors caused variations in mass concentrations: evaporation of semi-volatile compounds and bounce of larger particles and fragments. Our findings highlight the complexities of accurately separating and analyzing organic marker mass concentrations in airborne UFP.\n\nNewly identified climatically and environmentally significant high-latitude dust sources\n\nOuti Meinander, Pavla Dagsson-Waldhauserova, Pavel Amosov, Elena Aseyeva, Cliff Atkins, Alexander Baklanov, Clarissa Baldo, Sarah L.

Our results suggest a northern HLD belt at 50–58Â° N in Eurasia and 50–55Â° N in Canada and at >60Â° N in Eurasia and >58Â° N in Canada. Our addition to the previously identified global dust belt (GDB) provides crucially needed information on the extent of active HLD sources with both direct and indirect impacts on climate and environment in remote regions, which are often poorly understood and predicted.\n\nColumnar and surface urban aerosol in the Moscow megacity according to measurements and simulations with the COSMO-ART model\n\nNatalia E. Chubarova, Heike Vogel, Elizaveta E. Androsova, Alexander A. Kirsanov, Olga B. Popovicheva, Bernhard Vogel, and Gdaliy S. Rivin\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We show that urban aerosol comprises about 15–20% of columnar aerosol content, consisting mainly of fine aerosol mode. The black carbon (BC) fraction is about 5 %, depending on particle dispersion intensity (IPD). The BC fraction low value explains weak absorbing properties of the Moscow atmosphere. IPD also defines the daily cycle of urban aerosol species.\n\nSiberian Arctic black carbon: gas flaring and wildfire impact\n\nOlga B. Popovicheva, Nikolaos Evangeliou, Vasilii O. Kobelev, Marina A. Chichaeva, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Asta GregoriÄ, and Nikolay S. Kasimov\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Atmospheric models are often used to provide information to policy makers about current and future conditions under different emissions scenarios. In order to have confidence in those simulations, in this study we compare simulated air pollution from 18 state-of-the-art atmospheric models to measured air pollution in order to assess how well the models perform.\n\nOverview: Recent advances in the understanding of the northern Eurasian environments and of the urban air quality in China â a Pan-Eurasian Experiment (PEEX) programme perspective\n\nHanna K.

Although the scientific knowledge in these regions has increased, there are still gaps in our understanding of large-scale climate–Earth surface interactions and feedbacks. This arises from limitations in research infrastructures and integrative data analyses, hindering a comprehensive system analysis.\n\nAre reactive oxygen species (ROS) a suitable metric to predict toxicity of carbonaceous aerosol particles?\n\nZhi-Hui Zhang, Elena Hartner, Battist Utinger, Benjamin Gfeller, Andreas Paul, Martin Sklorz, Hendryk Czech, Bin Xia Yang, Xin Yi Su, Gert Jakobi, JÃ¼rgen Orasche, JÃ¼rgen Schnelle-Kreis, Seongho Jeong, Thomas GrÃ¶ger, Michal Pardo, Thorsten Hohaus, Thomas Adam, Astrid Kiendler-Scharr, Yinon Rudich, Ralf Zimmermann, and Markus Kalberer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1793–1809, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1793-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1793-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a novel setup, we comprehensively characterized the formation of particle-bound reactive oxygen species (ROS) in anthropogenic and biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). We found that more than 90 % of all ROS components in both SOA types have a short lifetime. Our results also show that photochemical aging promotes particle-bound ROS production and enhances the oxidative potential of the aerosols. We found consistent results between chemical-based and biological-based ROS analyses.\n\nSingle-particle characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in background air in northern Europe\n\nJohannes Passig, Julian Schade, Robert Irsig, Thomas KrÃ¶ger-Badge, Hendryk Czech, Thomas Adam, Henrik Fallgren, Jana Moldanova, Martin Sklorz, Thorsten Streibel, and Ralf Zimmermann\n\nAtmos.

We found PAHs bound to long-range transported particles from eastern and central Europe and also from ship emissions and local sources. This is the first field study using a new technology revealing single-particle data from both inorganic components and PAHs. We discuss PAH profiles that are indicative of several sources and atmospheric aging processes.\n\nCarbonaceous aerosol composition in air masses influenced by large-scale biomass burning: a case study in northwestern Vietnam\n\nDac-Loc Nguyen, Hendryk Czech, Simone M.

We describe a biomass burning (BB) plume arriving at remote Pha Din meteorological station, outline its carbonaceous particulate matter (PM) constituents based on more than 50 target compounds and discuss possible BB sources. This study adds valuable information on chemical PM composition for a region with scarce data availability.\n\nData on the elemental composition (mobile fractions and total content) of soils in catena at the SE Valdai Hills, Russia\n\nPolina Enchilik, Ivan Semenkov, and Nikolay Kasimov\n\nEarth Syst.

Here we summarize initial results from our integrative project exploring the Arctic environment and pollution to deliver data products, metrics, and indicators for stakeholders.\n\nResonance-enhanced detection of metals in aerosols using single-particle mass spectrometry\n\nJohannes Passig, Julian Schade, Ellen Iva Rosewig, Robert Irsig, Thomas KrÃ¶ger-Badge, Hendryk Czech, Martin Sklorz, Thorsten Streibel, Lei Li, Xue Li, Zhen Zhou, Henrik Fallgren, Jana Moldanova, and Ralf Zimmermann\n\nAtmos. Chem.

They are also transported by the wind into the oceans; provide micronutrients; and thus modulate biodiversity, fisheries, and climate. We show a way to more efficiently detect metals in individual particles while preserving source information. Our detection scheme is less dependent on the particle type and atmospheric changes and is thus valuable to the study of biogechemical cycles and air pollution.\n\nPhotochemical transformation of residential wood combustion emissions: dependence of organic aerosol composition on OH exposure\n\nAnni Hartikainen, Petri Tiitta, Mika Ihalainen, Pasi Yli-PirilÃ¤, JÃ¼rgen Orasche, Hendryk Czech, Miika Kortelainen, Heikki Lamberg, Heikki Suhonen, Hanna Koponen, Liqing Hao, Ralf Zimmermann, Jorma Jokiniemi, Jarkko Tissari, and Olli Sippula\n\nAtmos.

We assessed this organic emission at various stages of exposure with an oxidation flow reactor. Ageing led to major changes in both gaseous and particulate phases including increased acidic compounds and transformation of the polycyclic aromatic compounds. Such changes have serious implications for the health- and climate-related effects of combustion.\n\nAtmospheric aging of small-scale wood combustion emissions (model MECHA 1.0) – is it possible to distinguish causal effects from non-causal associations?\n\nVille Leinonen, Petri Tiitta, Olli Sippula, Hendryk Czech, Ari Leskinen, Juha Karvanen, Sini IsokÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤, and Santtu Mikkonen\n\nGeosci.

Its origin is quantified with a Lagrangian model that uses a recently developed feature that allows backward estimation of the specific source locations that contribute to the deposited mass. In NW European Russia transportation and domestic combustion from Finland was important. A systematic underestimation was found in W Siberia at places where gas flaring was important, implying miscalculation or sources.\n\nBenzo[a]pyrene in urban environments of eastern Moscow: pollution levels and critical loads\n\nNikolay S.

This study is the first attempt to evaluate all major input and output components of BaP balance in the land-use zones of the eastern district of Moscow. Based on measurements of BaP atmospheric fallout and reserves in the soils, the critical loads of BaP were calculated for different values of degradation intensity. Ecologically safe BaP levels in the soils will only be reached after many decades or centuries.\n\nPan-Eurasian Experiment (PEEX): towards a holistic understanding of the feedbacks and interactions in the landâatmosphereâoceanâsociety continuum in the northern Eurasian region\n\nHanna K.

Substantial SOA formation was observed in all experiments, leading to twice the initial OA mass emphasizing the importance of the burning conditions for the aging processes. The results prove that emissions are subject to intensive chemical processing in the atmosphere; e.g. the most of the POA was found to become oxidized after the ozone addition, forming aged POA.\n\nHyphenation of a EC / OC thermalâoptical carbon analyzer to photo-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry: an off-line aerosol mass spectrometric approach for characterization of primary and secondary particulate matter\n\nJ.

Phys., 24, 8737–8750, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8737-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8737-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnvironmental persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and reactive oxygen species (ROSs) play an active role in the atmosphere. Despite control measures having effectively reduced their emissions, reductions were less than in PM2.5. Emission control measures performed well in achieving Parade Blue, but reducing the impact of the atmosphere on human health remains challenging. Thus, there is a need to reassess emission control measures to better address the challenges posed by EPFRs and ROSs.\n\nCharacterizing water solubility of fresh and aged secondary organic aerosol in PM2.5 with the stable carbon isotope technique\n\nFenghua Wei, Xing Peng, Liming Cao, Mengxue Tang, Ning Feng, Xiaofeng Huang, and Lingyan He\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8507–8518, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8507-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8507-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe water solubility of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) is a crucial factor in determining their hygroscopicity and climatic impact. Stable carbon isotope and mass spectrometry techniques were combined to assess the water solubility of SOAs with different aging degrees in a coastal megacity in China. This work revealed a much higher water-soluble fraction of aged SOA compared to fresh SOA, indicating that the aging degree of SOA has considerable impacts on its water solubility.\n\nMeasurement report: Impact of cloud processes on secondary organic aerosols at a forested mountain site in southeastern China\n\nZijun Zhang, Weiqi Xu, Yi Zhang, Wei Zhou, Xiangyu Xu, Aodong Du, Yinzhou Zhang, Hongqin Qiao, Ye Kuang, Xiaole Pan, Zifa Wang, Xueling Cheng, Lanzhong Liu, Qingyan Fu, Douglas R. Worsnop, Jie Li, and Yele Sun\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8473–8488, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8473-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8473-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated aerosol composition and sources and the interaction between secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and clouds at a regional mountain site in southeastern China. Clouds efficiently scavenge more oxidized SOA; however, cloud evaporation leads to the production of less oxidized SOA. The unexpectedly high presence of nitrate in aerosol particles indicates that nitrate formed in polluted areas has undergone interactions with clouds, significantly influencing the regional background site.\n\nCritical contribution of chemically diverse carbonyl molecules to the oxidative potential of atmospheric aerosols\n\nFeifei Li, Shanshan Tang, Jitao Lv, Shiyang Yu, Xu Sun, Dong Cao, Yawei Wang, and Guibin Jiang\n\nAtmos.

Murphy, Gregory P. Schill, Michael J. Lawler, and Karl D. Froyd\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8263–8275, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8263-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8263-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing particle analysis by laser mass spectrometry, we examine vanadium-containing ship exhaust particles measured on NASA's DC-8 during the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom). Our results reveal ship exhaust particles are sufficiently widespread in the marine atmosphere and experience atmospheric aging. Finally, we use laboratory calibrations to determine the vanadium, sulfate, and organic single-particle mass fractions of vanadium-containing ship exhaust particles.\n\nDiverging trends in aerosol sulfate and nitrate measured in the remote North Atlantic in Barbados are attributed to clean air policies, African smoke, and anthropogenic emissions\n\nCassandra J. Gaston, Joseph M. Prospero, Kristen Foley, Havala O. T. Pye, Lillian Custals, Edmund Blades, Peter Sealy, and James A. Christie\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 8049–8066, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8049-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-8049-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo understand how changing emissions have impacted aerosols in remote regions, we measured nitrate and sulfate in Barbados and compared them to model predictions from EPA’s Air QUAlity TimE Series (EQUATES). Nitrate was stable, except for spikes in 2008 and 2010 due to transported smoke. Sulfate decreased in the 1990s due to reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the US and Europe; then it increased in the 2000s, likely due to anthropogenic emissions from Africa.\n\nDiverse sources and aging change the mixing state and ice nucleation properties of aerosol particles over the western Pacific and Southern Ocean\n\nJiao Xue, Tian Zhang, Keyhong Park, Jinpei Yan, Young Jun Yoon, Jiyeon Park, and Bingbing Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We found that particles collected in the marine atmosphere exhibit diverse ice nucleation abilities and mixing states. Sea salt mixed-sulfate particles were enriched in ice-nucleating particles. Selective aging on sea salt particles made particle populations more externally mixed. Characterizations of particles and their mixing state are needed for a better understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions.\n\nThe water-insoluble organic carbon in PM2.5 of typical Chinese urban areas: light-absorbing properties, potential sources, radiative forcing effects, and a possible light-absorbing continuum\n\nYangzhi Mo, Jun Li, Guangcai Zhong, Sanyuan Zhu, Shizhen Zhao, Jiao Tang, Hongxing Jiang, Zhineng Cheng, Chongguo Tian, Yingjun Chen, and Gan Zhang\n\nAtmos.

Additionally, we propose a light-absorbing carbonaceous continuum, revealing that components enriched with fossil sources tend to have stronger light-absorbing capacity, higher aromaticity, higher molecular weights, and greater recalcitrance in the atmosphere.\n\nMeasurement report: Size-resolved secondary organic aerosol formation modulated by aerosol water uptake in wintertime haze\n\nJing Duan, Ru-Jin Huang, Ying Wang, Wei Xu, Haobin Zhong, Chunshui Lin, Wei Huang, Yifang Gu, Jurgita Ovadnevaite, Darius Ceburnis, and Colin O'Dowd\n\nAtmos.

We investigated the potential effects of changes in inorganics on aerosol water uptake and, thus, secondary organic aerosol formation in wintertime haze based on the size-resolved measurements of non-refractory fine particulate matter (NR-PM2.5) in Xi’an, northwestern China. We highlight the key role of aerosol water as a medium to link inorganics and organics in their multiphase processes.\n\nIn situ measurement of organic aerosol molecular markers in urban Hong Kong during a summer period: temporal variations and source apportionment\n\nHongyong Li, Xiaopu Lyu, Likun Xue, Yunxi Huo, Dawen Yao, Haoxian Lu, and Hai Guo\n\nAtmos.

We have developed a standard-free mass calibration algorithm applicable to more than 98 % of ambient particles. With our algorithm, ions with ~ 0.05 Th mass difference could be determined. Therefore, many more atmospheric species could be determined and involved in the source apportionment of aerosols, the study of chemical reaction mechanisms, and the analysis of single-particle mixing states.\n\nDifferent formation pathways of nitrogen-containing organic compounds in aerosols and fog water in northern China\n\nWei Sun, Xiaodong Hu, Yuzhen Fu, Guohua Zhang, Yujiao Zhu, Xinfeng Wang, Caiqing Yan, Likun Xue, He Meng, Bin Jiang, Yuhong Liao, Xinming Wang, Ping'an Peng, and Xinhui Bi\n\nAtmos.

We investigated the composition of aerosols and fog water by state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and compared the formation pathways of NOCs. We found that NOCs in aerosols were mainly formed through nitration reaction, while ammonia addition played a more important role in fog water. The results deepen our understanding of the processes of organic particulate pollution.\n\nAutomated compound speciation, cluster analysis, and quantification of organic vapours and aerosols using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and mass spectrometry\n\nXiao He, Xuan Zheng, Shuwen Guo, Lewei Zeng, Ting Chen, Bohan Yang, Shupei Xiao, Qiongqiong Wang, Zhiyuan Li, Yan You, Shaojun Zhang, and Ye Wu\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1671,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1671, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study introduces an innovative method for identifying and quantifying complex organic vapors and aerosols. By combining advanced analytical techniques and new algorithms, we categorized thousands of compounds from heavy-duty diesel vehicles and ambient air and highlighted specific tracers for emission sources. The innovative approach enhances peak identification, reduces quantification uncertainties, and offers new insights for air quality management and atmospheric chemistry.\n\nImpact of weather patterns and meteorological factors on PM2.5 and O3 responses to the COVID-19 lockdown in China\n\nFuzhen Shen, Michaela I.

Thus, we studied the dissolution process of aerosol Fe and found that photochemistry played a key role in promoting Fe dissolution in clean conditions. RH-dependent reactions were more influential in slightly polluted conditions. These results highlight the distinct roles of two weather-related parameters (radiation and RH) in influencing geochemical cycles related to Fe.\n\nNon-negligible secondary contribution to brown carbon in autumn and winter: inspiration from particulate nitrated and oxygenated aromatic compounds in urban Beijing\n\nYanqin Ren, Zhenhai Wu, Yuanyuan Ji, Fang Bi, Junling Li, Haijie Zhang, Hao Zhang, Hong Li, and Gehui Wang\n\nAtmos.

The OPAH and NAC concentrations were much higher during heating than before heating. They majorly originated from the combustion of biomass and automobile emissions, and the secondary generation was the major contributor throughout the whole sampling period.\n\nSimultaneous organic aerosol source apportionment at two Antarctic sites reveals large-scale and ecoregion-specific components\n\nMarco Paglione, David C.

Our results show remarkable differences between pelagic (open-ocean) and sympagic (sea-ice-influenced) air masses and indicate that various sources and processes are controlling Antarctic aerosols.\n\nMeasurement report: Optical characterization, seasonality, and sources of brown carbon in fine aerosols from Tianjin, North China: year-round observations\n\nZhichao Dong, Chandra Mouli Pavuluri, Peisen Li, Zhanjie Xu, Junjun Deng, Xueyan Zhao, Xiaomai Zhao, Pingqing Fu, and Cong-Qiang Liu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5887–5905, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5887-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5887-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComprehensive study of optical properties of brown carbon (BrC) in fine aerosols from Tianjin, China, implied that biological emissions are major sources of BrC in summer, whereas fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning emissions are in cold periods. The direct radiation absorption caused by BrC in short wavelengths contributed about 40 % to that caused by BrC in 300–700 nm. Water-insoluble but methanol-soluble BrC contains more protein-like chromophores (PLOM) than that of water-soluble BrC.\n\nBayesian inference-based estimation of hourly primary and secondary organic carbon in suburban Hong Kong: multi-temporal-scale variations and evolution characteristics during PM2.5 episodes\n\nShan Wang, Kezheng Liao, Zijing Zhang, Yuk Ying Cheng, Qiongqiong Wang, Hanzhe Chen, and Jian Zhen Yu\n\nAtmos.

Their multi-temporal-scale variations and evolution characteristics during PM2.5 episodes were examined. The methodology could serve as a guide for other locations with similar monitoring capabilities. The observation-based results are helpful for understanding the evolving nature of secondary organic aerosols and refining the accuracy of model simulations.\n\nExploring the sources of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols by integrating observational and modeling results: insights from Northeast China\n\nYuan Cheng, Xu-bing Cao, Sheng-qiang Zhu, Zhi-qing Zhang, Jiu-meng Liu, Hong-liang Zhang, Qiang Zhang, and Ke-bin He\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1260,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1260, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn agreement between observational and modeling results is essential for the development of efficient air pollution control strategies. Here we constrained the modeling results of carbonaceous aerosols by field observation in Northeast China, a historically overlooked but recently targeted region of national clean air actions. Our results suggested that the estimation of agricultural fire emission and prediction of secondary organic aerosol remain challenging.\n\nVertical variability of aerosol properties and trace gases over a remote marine region: A case study over Bermuda\n\nTaiwo Adedayo Ajayi, Yonghoon Choi, Ewan C.

This work highlights the sensitivity of remote marine areas to long-range transport and the importance of considering vertical dependence of trace gas and aerosol properties.\n\nMeasurement report: Characteristics of aminiums in PM2.5 during winter clean and polluted episodes in China: aminium outbreak and its constraint\n\nYu Xu, Tang Liu, Yi-Jia Ma, Qi-Bin Sun, Hong-Wei Xiao, Hao Xiao, and Hua-Yun Xiao\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-975,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-975, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study has explored the characteristics of aminiums, ammonium, and PM2.5 from the clean days to the polluted days according to the observational data from 11 different Chinese cities, highlighting the possibility of the competitive uptake of ammonia versus amines on acidic aerosols, or the displacement of aminiums by ammonia under a high ammonia condition. The overall results deepen the understanding of the spatiotemporal differences in aminium characteristic and formation in China.\n\nHygroscopic Growth and Activation Changed Submicron Aerosol Composition and Properties in North China Plain\n\nWeiqi Xu, Ye Kuang, Wanyun Xu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Biao Luo, Xiaoyi Zhang, Jiangchuang Tao, Hongqin Qiao, Li Liu, and Yele Sun\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-998,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-998, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe deployed an advanced aerosol-fog sampling system at a rural site in the North China Plain to investigate the impact of aerosol hygroscopic growth and activation on the physicochemical properties of submicron aerosols. Observed results highlighted remarkably different aqueous processing of primary and secondary submicron aerosol components under distinct ambient RH conditions, and RH levels would impact significantly on aerosol sampling through aerosol swelling effect.\n\nAssessing the influence of long-range transport of aerosols on the PM2.5 chemical composition and concentration in the Aburrá Valley\n\nMaria P.

However, this can be exacerbated by the influx of external emissions from sources such as regional fires, Saharan dust, and volcanic degassing. While substantially increasing city-wide aerosols, these external sources can also degrade the aerosol chemical composition (i.e. their toxicity) and impact AQ, which we investigate in this study.\n\nBridging Gas and Aerosol Properties between Northeast U.S. and Bermuda: Analysis of Eight Transit Flights\n\nCassidy Soloff, Taiwo Ajayi, Yonghoon Choi, Ewan C.

A large number of aerosol particles are formed from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs and secondary organic aerosols – SOA). An important field campaign was organized on Réunion in March–April 2019 to understand the formation of SOA in a tropical atmosphere mostly influenced by VOCs emitted by forest and in the presence of clouds. This work synthesizes the results of this campaign.\n\nImpacts of elevated anthropogenic emissions on physicochemical characteristics of BC-containing particles over the Tibetan Plateau\n\nJinbo Wang, Jiaping Wang, Yuxuan Zhang, Tengyu Liu, Xuguang Chi, Xin Huang, Dafeng Ge, Shiyi Lai, Caijun Zhu, Lei Wang, Qiaozhi Zha, Ximeng Qi, Wei Nie, Congbin Fu, and Aijun Ding\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-879,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-879, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we found large spatial discrepancies in the physical and chemical properties of black carbon over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Elevated anthropogenic emissions from low-altitude regions can significantly change the mass concentration, mixing state and chemical composition of black carbon -containing aerosol in TP region, further altering its light absorption ability.

Single-particle measurements revealed the major role of atmospheric processing in modulating the black carbon mixing state. A significant fraction of soot particles were internally mixed with oxidized organic aerosol and sulfate, with implications for activation as cloud nuclei.\n\nHigh Altitude Aerosol Chemical Characterization and Source Identification: Insights from the CALISHTO Campaign\n\nOlga Zografou, Maria Gini, Prodromos Fetfatzis, Konstantinos Granakis, Romanos Foskinis, Manousos Ioannis Manousakas, Fotios Tsopelas, Evangelia Diapouli, Eleni Dovrou, Christina N. Vasilakopoulou, Alexandros Papayannis, Spyros N.

Cloud presence was found to reduce PM1 concentrations, affecting sulphate more than organics. Interstitial aerosol was richer in low hygroscopic organics and acidic inorganics, compared to activated. Higher relative abundance of eBC compared to the other components was revealed for FT conditions compared to PBL.\n\nThe behaviour of charged particles (ions) during new particle formation events in urban Leipzig (Germany)\n\nAlex Rowell, James Brean, David C. S. Beddows, Zongbo Shi, Avinash Kumar, Matti Rissanen, Miikka Dal Maso, Peter Mettke, Kay Weinhold, Maik Merkel, and Roy M. Harrison\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-742,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-742, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIons enhance the formation and growth rates of new particles, affecting the earths radiation budget. Despite these effects, there is little published data exploring the sources of ions in the urban environment and their role in new particle formation (NPF). Here we show that natural ion sources dominate in urban environments, while traffic is a secondary source. Ions contribute up to 12.7 % of the formation rate of particles, indicating that they are important for forming urban PM.\n\nMeasurement report: Evaluation of the TOF-ACSM-CV for PM1.0 and PM2.5 measurements during the RITA-2021 field campaign\n\nXinya Liu, Bas Henzing, Arjan Hensen, Jan Mulder, Peng Yao, Danielle van Dinther, Jerry van Bronckhorst, Rujin Huang, and Ulrike Dusek\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3405–3420, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3405-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3405-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated the time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (TOF-ACSM) following the implementation of the PM2.5 aerodynamic lens and a capture vaporizer (CV). The results showed that it significantly improved the accuracy and precision of ACSM in the field observations. The paper elucidates the measurement outcomes of various instruments and provides an analysis of their biases. This comprehensive evaluation is expected to benefit the ACSM community and other aerosol field measurements.\n\nSea salt reactivity over the northwest Atlantic: an in-depth look using the airborne ACTIVATE dataset\n\nEva-Lou Edwards, Yonghoon Choi, Ewan C. Crosbie, Joshua P. DiGangi, Glenn S. Diskin, Claire E. Robinson, Michael A. Shook, Edward L. Winstead, Luke D. Ziemba, and Armin Sorooshian\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3349–3378, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3349-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3349-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate Cl− depletion in sea salt particles over the northwest Atlantic from December 2021 to June 2022 using an airborne dataset. Losses of Cl− are greatest in May and least in December–February and March. Inorganic acidic species can account for all depletion observed for December–February, March, and June near Bermuda but none in May. Quantifying Cl− depletion as a percentage captures seasonal trends in depletion but fails to convey the effects it may have on atmospheric oxidation.\n\nMeasurement report: Atmospheric ice nuclei in the Changbai Mountains (2623 m a.s.l.) in northeastern Asia\n\nYue Sun, Yujiao Zhu, Yanbin Qi, Lanxiadi Chen, Jiangshan Mu, Ye Shan, Yu Yang, Yanqiu Nie, Ping Liu, Can Cui, Ji Zhang, Mingxuan Liu, Lingli Zhang, Yufei Wang, Xinfeng Wang, Mingjin Tang, Wenxing Wang, and Likun Xue\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3241–3256, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3241-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3241-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nField observations were conducted at the summit of Changbai Mountain in northeast Asia. The cumulative number concentration of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) varied from 1.6 × 10−3 to 78.3 L−1 over the temperature range of −5.5 to −29.0 â. Biological INPs (bio-INPs) accounted for the majority of INPs, and the proportion exceeded 90% above −13.0 â. Planetary boundary layer height, valley breezes, and long-distance transport of air mass influence the abundance of bio-INPs.\n\nMorphological and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosol particles from ship emissions and biomass burning during a summer cruise measurement in the South China Sea\n\nCuizhi Sun, Yongyun Zhang, Baoling Liang, Min Gao, Xi Sun, Fei Li, Xue Ni, Qibin Sun, Hengjia Ou, Dexian Chen, Shengzhen Zhou, and Jun Zhao\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Using advanced in situ and microscope techniques, we observed particle size, structure, and tar balls mixed with various elements. Results showed biomass burning and fossil fuels majorly influence light absorption, especially during significant burning events. This research aids the understanding of carbonaceous aerosols' role in marine climate.\n\nTropical tropospheric aerosol sources and chemical composition observed at high altitude in the Bolivian Andes\n\nC.

Andrade, Valeria MardÃ³Ã±ez, Alkuin Maximilian Koenig, Diego Aliaga, Claudia Mohr, Laura Ticona, Fernando Velarde, Luis Blacutt, Ricardo Forno, David N. Whiteman, Alfred Wiedensohler, Patrick Ginot, and Paolo Laj\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2837–2860, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2837-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2837-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol chemical composition (ions, sugars, carbonaceous matter) from 2011 to 2020 was studied at Mt. Chacaltaya (5380 m a.s.l., Bolivian Andes). Minimum concentrations occur in the rainy season with maxima in the dry and transition seasons. The origins of the aerosol are located in a radius of hundreds of kilometers: nearby urban and rural areas, natural biogenic emissions, vegetation burning from Amazonia and Chaco, Pacific Ocean emissions, soil dust, and Peruvian volcanism.\n\nChemical composition, sources and formation mechanism of urban PM2.5 in Southwest China: a case study at the beginning of 2023\n\nJunke Zhang, Yunfei Su, Chunying Chen, Wenkai Guo, Qinwen Tan, Miao Feng, Danlin Song, Tao Jiang, Qiang Chen, Yuan Li, Wei Li, Yizhi Wang, Xiaojuan Huang, Lin Han, Wanqing Wu, and Gehui Wang\n\nAtmos.

By integrating the obtained chemical composition, source, mixing state and numerical simulation results, we infer that Haze-1 was mainly caused by pollutants related to fossil fuel combustion, especially local mobile sources, while Haze-2 was triggered by the secondary pollutants, which mainly came from regional transmission.\n\nChemical characterization of atmospheric aerosols at a high-altitude mountain site: a study of source apportionment\n\nElena Barbaro, Matteo Feltracco, Fabrizio De Blasi, Clara Turetta, Marta Radaelli, Warren Cairns, Giulio Cozzi, Giovanna Mazzi, Marco Casula, Jacopo Gabrieli, Carlo Barbante, and Andrea Gambaro\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Over 100 chemical markers were identified, including major ions, organic compounds, and trace elements. It revealed sources of aerosol, highlighted impacts of Saharan dust events, and showed anthropogenic pollution's influence despite the site's remoteness. Enrichment factors emphasized non-natural sources of trace elements. Source apportionment identified four key factors affecting the area.\n\nComposition and sources of carbonaceous aerosol in the European Arctic at Zeppelin Observatory, Svalbard (2017 to 2020)\n\nKarl Espen Yttri, Are BÃ¤cklund, Franz Conen, Sabine Eckhardt, Nikolaos Evangeliou, Markus Fiebig, Anne Kasper-Giebl, Avram Gold, Hans Gundersen, Cathrine Lund Myhre, Stephen Matthew Platt, David Simpson, Jason D.

We find that organic aerosol is a significant fraction of the Arctic aerosol, though less than sea salt aerosol and mineral dust, as well as non-sea-salt sulfate, originating mainly from anthropogenic sources in winter and from natural sources in summer, emphasizing the importance of wildfires for biogenic secondary organic aerosol and primary biological aerosol particles observed in the Arctic.\n\nVariation in chemical composition and volatility of oxygenated organic aerosol in different rural, urban, and mountain environments\n\nWei Huang, Cheng Wu, Linyu Gao, Yvette Gramlich, Sophie L. Haslett, Joel Thornton, Felipe D. Lopez-Hilfiker, Ben H. Lee, Junwei Song, Harald Saathoff, Xiaoli Shen, Ramakrishna Ramisetty, Sachchida N. Tripathi, Dilip Ganguly, Feng Jiang, Magdalena Vallon, Siegfried Schobesberger, Taina Yli-Juuti, and Claudia Mohr\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We do a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between the chemical composition and volatility of oxygenated organic aerosol particles across different systems and environments. This study provides implications for volatility descriptions of oxygenated organic aerosol particles in different model frameworks.\n\nElucidating the mechanisms of atmospheric new particle formation in the highly polluted Po Valley, Italy\n\nJing Cai, Juha Sulo, Yifang Gu, Sebastian Holm, Runlong Cai, Steven Thomas, Almuth Neuberger, Fredrik Mattsson, Marco Paglione, Stefano Decesari, Matteo Rinaldi, Rujing Yin, Diego Aliaga, Wei Huang, Yuanyuan Li, Yvette Gramlich, Giancarlo Ciarelli, Lauriane QuÃ©lÃ©ver, Nina Sarnela, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Nora Zannoni, Cheng Wu, Wei Nie, Juha Kangasluoma, Claudia Mohr, Markku Kulmala, Qiaozhi Zha, Dominik Stolzenburg, and Federico Bianchi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2423–2441, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2423-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2423-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy combining field measurements, simulations and recent chamber experiments, we investigate new particle formation (NPF) and growth in the Po Valley, where both haze and frequent NPF occur. Our results show that sulfuric acid, ammonia and amines are the dominant NPF precursors there. A high NPF rate and a lower condensation sink lead to a greater survival probability for newly formed particles, highlighting the importance of gas-to-particle conversion for aerosol concentrations.\n\nDifferences in aerosol and cloud properties along the central California coast when winds change from northerly to southerly\n\nKira Zeider, Grace Betito, Anthony Bucholtz, Peng Xian, Annette Walker, and Armin Sorooshian\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-392,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-392, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe predominant wind direction along the California coast (northerly) reverses several times during the summer (to southerly). The effects of these wind reversals on aerosol and cloud characteristics are not well understood. Using data from multiple datasets we found that southerly flow periods had enhanced signatures of anthropogenic emissions due to shipping/continental sources, and clouds had more but smaller droplets.\n\nLocal ship speed reduction effect on black carbon emissions measured at remote marine station\n\nMikko HeikkilÃ¤, Krista Luoma, Timo MÃ¤kelÃ¤, and Tiia GrÃ¶nholm\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2823,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2823, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBlack carbon (BC) concentration was measured from 211 ship exhaust gas plumes at a remote marine station. Emission factors of BC were calculated in grams/kilograms fuel. Ships using exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) were found to emit 80 % less BC than ships without EGCS. Emission factors were used to model BC emissions as a function of speed to define the effect of speed reduction. BC emissions increased with a decrease in speed from the ship’s service speed.\n\nRoles of marine biota in the formation of atmospheric bioaerosols, cloud condensation nuclei, and ice-nucleating particles over the North Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean\n\nKaori Kawana, Fumikazu Taketani, Kazuhiko Matsumoto, Yutaka Tobo, Yoko Iwamoto, Takuma Miyakawa, Akinori Ito, and Yugo Kanaya\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1777–1799, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1777-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1777-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on comprehensive shipborne observations, we found strong links between sea-surface biological materials and the formation of atmospheric fluorescent bioaerosols, cloud condensation nuclei, and ice-nucleating particles over the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea during autumn 2019. Taking the wind-speed effect into account, we propose equations to approximate the links for this cruise, which can be used as a guide for modeling as well as for systematic comparisons with other observations.\n\nEvolution of nucleophilic high molecular-weight organic compounds in ambient aerosols: a case study\n\nChen He, Hanxiong Che, Zier Bao, Yiliang Liu, Qing Li, Miao Hu, Jiawei Zhou, Shumin Zhang, Xiaojiang Yao, Quan Shi, Chunmao Chen, Yan Han, Lingshuo Meng, Xin Long, Fumo Yang, and Yang Chen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1627–1639, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1627-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1627-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe examined the daily evolution of high molecular-weight organic compounds with a molecular weight of up to 1000 Da in order to comprehend their behaviors in the atmosphere under actual conditions. These compounds were proven to undergo multi-generation oxidation, carboxylation, and nitrification via both day- and nighttime chemistry.\n\nFractional solubility of iron in mineral dust aerosols over coastal Namibia: a link to marine biogenic emissions?\n\nKarine Desboeufs, Paola Formenti, Raquel Torres-SÃ¡nchez, Kerstin Schepanski, Jean-Pierre Chaboureau, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Stefanie Feuerstein, Benoit Laurent, Danitza Klopper, Andreas Namwoonde, Mathieu Cazaunau, Servanne Chevaillier, AnaÃ¯s Feron, CÃ©cile Mirande-Bret, Sylvain Triquet, and Stuart J. Piketh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1525–1541, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1525-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1525-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the fractional solubility of iron (Fe) in dust particles along the coast of Namibia, a critical region for the atmospheric Fe supply of the South Atlantic Ocean. Our results suggest a possible two-way interplay whereby marine biogenic emissions from the coastal marine ecosystems into the atmosphere would increase the solubility of Fe-bearing dust by photo-reduction processes. The subsequent deposition of soluble Fe could act to further enhance marine biogenic emissions.\n\nReal-world observations of reduced nitrogen and ultrafine particles in commercial cooking organic aerosol emissions\n\nSunhye Kim, Jo Machesky, Drew R. Gentner, and Albert A. Presto\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1281–1298, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1281-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1281-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCooking emissions are often an overlooked source of air pollution. We used a mobile lab to measure the characteristics of particles emitted from cooking sites in two cities. Our findings showed that cooking releases a substantial number of fine particles. While most emissions were similar, a bakery site showed distinctive chemical compositions with higher nitrogen compound levels. Thus, understanding the particle emissions from different cooking activities is crucial.\n\nSource apportionment of PM2.5 in MontrÃ©al, Canada, and health risk assessment for potentially toxic elements\n\nNansi Fakhri, Robin Stevens, Arnold Downey, Konstantina Oikonomou, Jean Sciare, Charbel Afif, and Patrick L.

This study represents the first time that such extensive composition measurements were included in an urban source apportionment study in Canada, and it provides greater resolution of fine-particle sources than has been previously achieved in Canada.\n\nPhysicochemical and temporal characteristics of individual atmospheric aerosol particles in urban Seoul during KORUS-AQ campaign: insights from single-particle analysis\n\nHanjin Yoo, Li Wu, Hong Geng, and Chul-Un Ro\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 853–867, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-853-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-853-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted an investigation of atmospheric aerosols collected in Seoul, South Korea, during the KORUS-AQ campaign on a single-particle basis. We were able to identify their sources, the atmospheric fate, and the impacts of local emissions and long-range transport on aerosol composition. Additionally, we traced potential sources of non-exhaust heavy-metal particles. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of urban aerosols.\n\nCited articles"
