Petrographically and\n\ngeochemically, the volcanic rocks selected for this study are made up of rhyolite, rhyodacite, andesite porphyry, and\n\nbasalt. Based on ﬁeld investigations, these rocks are also associated with other igneous rocks including granite,\n\ngranodiorite, tuff, gabbro, and cumulus gabbro. The chemical data acquired from X-ray ﬂuorescence, inductively\n\ncoupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry methods suggest\n\nthat the studied rocks from the eruption can be separated into eight magmatic groups and four tectonic settings.\n\nThe tectonic setting of the southern location of Chiang Khong-Lampang-Tak volcanic rocks consists of (1) an active\n\ncontinental margin (Groups V and VII), (2) a back-arc basin (Group VI), (3) post-collision (Groups II and III), and\n\n(4) continental rifting (Groups I, IV, and VIII).\n\nKEYWORDS: volcanic rocks, tectonic setting, petrochemistry, Tak volcanic rocks\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe geology of northern Thailand is very irregular, Fig. 1 Distribution of pre-Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the\n\ndiverse, and obscure.

There is also an old quarry, which\n\ncould be suitably developed to geosites as well as geopark. This area can be divided into seven main geosites based\n\non their location, identity, rock type, morphology, and geologic phenomena, including Doi Suthep Mountain, Ob\n\nKhan Gorge, Muang On Cave, San Kamphaeng Hot Springs, Mae Kampong Waterfall, Grand Canyon Chiang Mai,\n\nand Mae Ping River. There is significant geodiversity in the region, which has evolved since the Pre-Cambrian (>\n\n550 million years ago) to Quaternary (recent) periods. The national park always protects and preserves the biodi-\n\nversity in the area, which includes many species of both flora and fauna, especially in the Mae Sa-Kog Ma Huai\n\nKhok Ma Biosphere Reserve. Prepared by scientists as well as the local guides, there are many basic geology and\n\nbotany training courses for both students and general people. Furthermore, Thai Lanna and the hill tribe people in\n\nChiang Mai have a culture and historical identity that is exhibited by temples and archaeological sites such as Doi\n\nSuthep Temple, Wiang Kum Kam Historic Site, and the Great Wall of Chiang Mai. The main goal of geotourism\n\nresearch is to evaluate the potential of geotourism and georesources in the context of geopark establishment.\n\nUnderstanding by the local people concerning the value and origin of their geologic monuments as well as the\n\ngeopark concept is also significant. In addition, there are local as well as national advantages, especially for\n\nsustainable development.\n\nKeywords Evaluation . Geopark . Geoheritage . Geodiversity . Chiang Mai .
