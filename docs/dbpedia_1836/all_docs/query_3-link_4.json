On its base, a long series of paintings hint at what life was like here some 3,000 years ago. Also containing strange rock formations, fantastic waterfalls and fields of wildflowers, Pha Taem National Park packs a lot into its 340 square kilometres.\n\nTravelfish says:\n\nThe park covers a rocky plateau gently rising from the west covered in dry dipterocarp forest, which culminates in sheer cliffs dropping down into the narrow Mekong valley. Displaying a fair amount of information on the park’s natural and historical background, the visitor centre sits near the cliff’s edge in front of a bumpy car park paved by mother nature.\n\nFrom here visitors can walk right up to the cliffside to enjoy the view. Keep small children close at hand here; no guardrails stand between you and the edge of a 160-metre drop. A nearby trailhead gives way to a few concrete steps leading to the base of the park’s namesake cliff: Pha Taem, which translates as “cliff painting”.\n\nThe scenic and relatively easy trail runs along the foot of the overhanging cliff, passing five painting sites spread along 1.5 kilometres before climbing back to the cliff top. From here another 1.5 kilometres of easy track takes you across the plateau and back to the car park. Wooden viewing platforms are set up in front of the paintings, which are guarded by an outcrop of barbed wire to stop anyone from adding more modern graffiti.\n\nWhile the paintings are thought to be around 3,000 years old, no one is exactly sure. Anywhere between 1,000 and 4,000 years is plausible, and the art was probably added gradually over a lengthy period of time. The artists are thought to have used palm leaves to apply the natural paints, mostly red but also with some black and white. Much of the cliff face overhangs, sometimes dramatically, as softer shales compose the lower strata that are capped by less easily eroded ...

Public transport does not run to the park, so you’ll need to hire your own wheels or go as part of a tour.\n\nIn Khong Chiam, a car can be arranged through Ban Mongkhon and the driver charges a very reasonable 500 baht fee to take up to four people to the Pha Taem cliff paintings and Sao Chaliang, with the price going up from there for each waterfall. If going with this option you must also pay for gas and the national park fees yourself. A tuk tuk in Khong Chiam quoted us 1,200 baht for a round trip to Pha Taem cliff and Soie Sawan waterfall.\n\nBack in Ubon Ratchathani, a taxi driver quoted us 2,500 baht for a full-day round trip to the national park, including waterfalls. You may score a cheaper rate through a hotel.\n\nIf going on your own steam, take Highway 2134 north out of Khong Chiam (you’ll have to pass through the town even if coming from Ubon city) and then follow signs for the park onto Highway 2112. The park’s main section with the visitor centre and cliff paintings is clearly marked by signs and reached after a few km on the access road.\n\nTo reach the waterfalls, head back to Highway 2112, continue north and be on the lookout for signs. The sign for Soie Sawan is obvious after around 15 km on the right, and then it’s another five or so km to the car park. Back on 2112, keep north for another 12 or so km and you’ll see brown signs pointing right to Saeng Chan and Thung Na Muang waterfalls. Not long after that right, another sign points right again to put you on a bumpy side road that continues south for 10 km until one sign points straight to Thung Na Muang and another points right to Saeng Chan. Another sign points west to Pha Chanadai.\n\nThe entry fee for foreign adults is 400 baht. Tickets are generally required to see Soie Sawan and Saeng Chan waterfalls along with Pha Taem cliff and Sao Chaliang. If there’s enough time after hitting those, you might continue north up 2112 to Sam Phan Bok.\n\nContact details for Pha Taem National Park"
