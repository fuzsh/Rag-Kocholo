ACTION: Proposed rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in response to Executive Order 13650, is proposing to amend its Risk Management Program regulations. The proposed revisions include several changes to the accident prevention program requirements including an additional analysis of safer technology and alternatives for the process hazard analysis for some Program 3 processes, third-party audits and incident investigation root cause analysis for Program 2 and Program 3 processes, enhancements to the emergency preparedness requirements, increased public availability of chemical hazard information, and several other changes to certain regulatory definitions and data elements submitted in risk management plans. These proposed amendments seek to improve chemical process safety, assist local emergency authorities in planning for and responding to accidents, and improve public awareness of chemical hazards at regulated sources. DATES: Comments. Comments and additional material must be received on or before May 13, 2016. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), comments on the information collection provisions are best assured of consideration if the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) receives a copy of your comments on or before April 13, 2016. Public Hearing. The EPA will hold a public hearing on this proposed rule on March 29, 2016 in Washington, DC. ADDRESSES: Comments.

Purpose of the Regulatory Action The purpose of this action is to improve safety at facilities that use and distribute hazardous chemicals. In response to catastrophic chemical facility incidents in the United States, including the explosion that occurred at the West Fertilizer facility in West, Texas, on April 17, 2013 that killed 15 people, President Obama issued Executive Order 13650, ``Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security,'' on August 1, 2013.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ For more information on the Executive Order see https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/01/executive-order-improving-chemical-facility-safety-and-security. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 6(a)(i) of Executive Order 13650 requires that various Federal agencies develop options for improved chemical facility safety and security that identify ``improvements to existing risk management practices through agency programs, private sector initiatives, Government guidance, outreach, standards, and regulations.'' One agency program presently in existence is the Risk Management Program implemented by EPA under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(r)). Section 6(c) of Executive Order 13650 requires the Administrator of EPA to review the chemical hazards covered by the Risk Management Program and expand, implement and enforce the Risk Management Program to address any additional hazards. As part of this effort to solicit comments and information from the public regarding potential changes to EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR part 68), on July 31, 2014, EPA published a ``Request for Information'' notice or ``RFI'' (79 FR 44604). EPA believes that the Risk Management Program regulations have been effective in preventing and mitigating chemical accidents in the United States. However, EPA believes that revisions could further protect human health and the environment from chemical hazards through advancement of process safety management based on lessons learned. These revisions are a result of a review of the existing Risk Management Program and information gathered from the RFI and Executive Order listening sessions. 2. Summary of the Major Provisions of the Regulatory Action This action proposes to amend EPA's Risk Management Program regulations at 40 CFR part 68. These regulations apply to stationary sources (also referred to as ``facilities'') that hold specific ``regulated substances'' in excess of threshold quantities. These facilities are required to assess their potential release impacts, undertake steps to prevent releases, plan for emergency response to releases, and summarize this information in a risk management plan (RMP) submitted to EPA. The release prevention steps vary depending on the type of process, but progressively gain specificity and rigor over three program levels (i.e., Program 1, Program 2, and Program 3). The major provisions of this proposed rule include several changes to the accident prevention program requirements, as well as enhancements to the emergency response requirements, and improvements to the public availability of chemical hazard information. Each of these proposed revisions is introduced in the following paragraphs of this section and described in greater detail in sections IV through VI, later in this document. Certain proposed provisions would apply to a subset of the processes based on program levels described in 40 CFR part 68 (or in one case, to a subset of processes within a program level). A full description of these program levels is provided in section II of this document. a. Accident Prevention Program Revisions This action proposes three changes to the accident prevention program requirements. First, the proposed rule would require all facilities with Program 2 or 3 processes to conduct a root cause analysis as part of an incident investigation of a catastrophic release or an incident that could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release (i.e., a near-miss). This provision is intended to reduce the number of chemical accidents by requiring facilities to identify the underlying causes of an incident so that they may be addressed. Identifying the root causes, rather than isolating and correcting solely the immediate cause of the incident, will help prevent similar incidents at other locations, and will yield the maximum benefit or lessons learned from the incident investigation. Second, the proposed rule would require regulated facilities with Program 2 or 3 processes to contract with an independent third-party to perform a compliance audit after the facility has a reportable release. Compliance audits are required under the existing rule, but are allowed to be self-audits (i.e., performed by the owner or operator of the regulated facility). This provision is intended to reduce the risk of future accidents by requiring an objective auditing process to determine whether the owner or operator of the facility is effectively complying with the accident prevention procedures and practices required under 40 CFR part 68. The third proposed revision to the prevention program would add an element to the process hazard analysis (PHA), which is updated every five years. Specifically, owners or operators of facilities with Program 3 regulated processes in North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes 322 (paper manufacturing), 324 (petroleum and coal products manufacturing), and 325 (chemical manufacturing) would be required to conduct a safer technology and alternatives analysis (STAA) as part of their PHA, and to evaluate the feasibility of any inherently safer technology (IST) identified. The current PHA requirements include consideration of active, passive, and procedural measures to control hazards. The proposed modernization effort continues to support the analysis of those measures and adds consideration of IST alternatives. The proposed provision is intended to reduce the risk of serious accidental releases by requiring facilities in these sectors to conduct a careful examination of potentially safer technology and designs that they could implement in lieu of, or in addition to, their current technologies. Data compiled from RMPs suggest processes in these NAICS codes have a disproportionate share of reportable releases. At this time, EPA is not proposing any additional requirements either for location of stationary sources (related to their proximity to public receptors) or emergency shutdown systems. However, EPA seeks comment on whether such requirements should be considered for future rulemakings, including the scope of such requirements, or whether the Agency should publish guidance. b. Emergency Response Enhancements This action also proposes to enhance the rule's emergency response requirements. Owners or operators of all facilities with Program 2 or 3 processes would be required to coordinate with the local emergency response agencies at least once a year to ensure that resources and capabilities are in place to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance. As a result of improved coordination between facility owners and operators and local emergency response officials, EPA believes that some facilities that are currently designated as non- responding facilities may become responding [[Page 13641]] facilities (i.e., develop an emergency response program in accordance with Sec. 68.95). Additionally, all facilities with Program 2 or 3 processes would be required to conduct notification exercises annually to ensure that their emergency contact information is accurate and complete. This provision is intended to reduce the impact of accidents by ensuring that appropriate mechanisms and processes are in place to notify local responders when an accident occurs. One of the factors that can contribute to the severity of chemical accidents is a lack of effective coordination between a facility and local emergency responders. Increasing such coordination and establishing appropriate emergency response procedures can help reduce the effects of accidents. This action also proposes to require that all facilities subject to the emergency response program requirements of subpart E of the rule (or ``responding facilities'') conduct a full field exercise at least once every five years and one tabletop exercise annually in the other years. Responding facilities that have an RMP reportable accident would also have to conduct a full field exercise within a year of the accident. The purpose of this provision is to reduce the impact of accidents by ensuring that emergency response personnel understand their roles in the event of an incident, that local responders are familiar with the hazards at a facility, and that the emergency response plan is up-to-date. Improved coordination with emergency response personnel will better prepare responders to respond effectively to an incident and take steps to notify the community of appropriate actions, such as shelter-in-place or evacuation. c. Enhanced Availability of Information This action proposes various enhancements to the public availability of chemical hazard information. The proposed rule would require all facilities to provide certain basic information to the public through easily accessible means such as a facility Web site. If no Web site exists, the owner or operator may provide the information at public libraries or government offices, or use other means appropriate for particular locations and facilities. In addition, a subset of facilities would be required, upon request, to provide the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Tribal Emergency Planning Committee (TEPC) \\2\\ or other local emergency response agencies with summaries related to: Their activities on compliance audits (facilities with Program 2 and Program 3 processes); emergency response exercises (facilities with Program 2 and Program 3 processes); accident history and investigation reports (all facilities that have had RMP reportable accidents); and any ISTs implemented at the facility (a subset of Program 3 processes). The proposed rule would also require all facilities to hold a public meeting for the local community within a specified timeframe after an RMP reportable accident. This provision will ensure that first responders and members of the community have easier access to appropriate facility chemical hazard information, which can significantly improve emergency preparedness and their understanding of how the facility is addressing potential risks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Note for the purposes of this document the term TEPC can be substituted for LEPC, as appropriate. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to the major provisions described previously in this section, this action proposes revisions to clarify or simplify the RMP submission. These changes are intended to reduce the compliance burden on facilities and increase their understanding of the RMP requirements. We are also proposing technical corrections to various provisions of the rule. 3. Costs and Benefits a. Summary of Potential Costs Approximately 12,500 facilities have filed current RMPs with EPA and are potentially affected by the proposed rule changes. These facilities range from petroleum refineries and large chemical manufacturers to water and wastewater treatment systems; chemical and petroleum wholesalers and terminals; food manufacturers, packing plants, and other cold storage facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems; agricultural chemical distributors; midstream gas plants; and a limited number of other sources, including Federal installations, that use RMP-regulated substances. Table 1 presents the number of facilities according to the latest RMP reporting as of February 2015 by industrial sector and chemical use.

The largest average annual cost of the proposed rule is the exercise costs for current responders ($60.7 million), followed by new responders (facilities that will comply with the emergency response program requirements of Sec. 68.95 as a result of local coordination activities or receiving a written request from the facility's LEPC) ($35.6 million), STAA ($34.8 million), and information sharing (LEPC) ($11.7 million). The remaining provisions impose average annual costs under $10 million each, including coordination ($6.3 million), third- party audits ($5.0 million), information sharing (public) ($4.0 million), notification exercises ($1.4 million), incident investigation/root cause analysis ($0.8 million), public meetings ($0.4 million), and rule familiarization ($0.3 million). b. Summary of Potential Benefits EPA anticipates that promulgation and implementation of this rule would result in a reduction of the frequency and magnitude of damages from releases. Accidents and releases from RMP facilities occur every year, causing fires and explosions; damage to property; acute and chronic exposures of workers and nearby residents to hazardous materials, and resulting in serious injuries and death. Although we are unable to quantify what specific reductions may occur as a result of these proposed revisions, we are able to present data on the total damages that currently occur at RMP facilities each year. The data presented is based on a 10-year baseline period, summarizing RMP accident impacts and, when possible, monetizing them. EPA expects that some portion of future damages would be prevented through implementation of a final rule. Table 3 presents a summary of the quantified damages identified in the analysis.

EPA estimated total average annual on-site damages of $265.8 million. The largest monetized average annual on-site damage was on-site property damage, which resulted in average annual damage of approximately $205.5 million. The next largest impact was on-site fatalities ($49.8 million) and injuries ($10.5 million). EPA estimated total average annual offsite damages of $8.9 million. The largest monetized average annual offsite damage was from sheltering in place ($4.1 million), followed by medical treatment ($1.5 million), property damage ($1.1 million), fatalities ($0.9 million), evacuations ($0.7 million), and hospitalizations ($0.7 million). In total, EPA estimated monetized damages from RMP facility accidents of $275 million per year. However, the monetized impacts omit many important categories of accident impacts including lost productivity, the costs of emergency response, transaction costs, property value impacts in the surrounding community (that overlap with other benefit categories), and environmental impacts. Also not reflected in the 10-year baseline costs are the impacts of non-RMP accidents at RMP facilities and any potential impacts of rare high consequence catastrophes. A final omission is related to the information provision. Reducing the probability of chemical accidents and the severity of their impacts, and improving information disclosure by chemical facilities, as the proposed provisions intend, would provide benefits to potentially affected members of society. Table 4 summarizes four broad social benefit categories related to accident prevention and mitigation including prevention of RMP accidents, mitigation of RMP accidents, prevention and mitigation of non-RMP accidents at RMP facilities, and prevention of major catastrophes. The table explains each and identifies ten associated specific benefit categories, ranging from avoided fatalities to avoided emergency response costs. Table 4 also highlights and explains the information disclosure benefit category and identifies two specific benefits associated with it: Improved efficiency of property markets and allocation of emergency resources.

Background Recent catastrophic chemical facility incidents in the United States prompted President Obama to issue Executive Order 13650, ``Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security,'' on August 1, 2013.\\5\\ The purpose of the Executive Order is to enhance the safety and security of chemical facilities and reduce risks associated with hazardous chemicals to owners and operators, workers, and communities. The Executive Order establishes the Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group (``Working Group''), co-chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator of EPA, and the Secretary of Labor or their designated representatives at the Assistant Secretary level or higher, and composed of senior representatives of other Federal departments, agencies, and offices. The Executive Order requires the Working Group to carry out a number of tasks whose overall aim is to prevent chemical accidents, such as the explosion that occurred at the West Fertilizer facility in West, Texas, on April 17, 2013.\\6\\ In addition to the tragedy at the West Fertilizer facility, a number of other incidents have demonstrated a significant risk to the safety of American workers and communities. On March 23, 2005, explosions at the BP Refinery in Texas City, Texas, killed 15 people and injured more than 170 people.\\7\\ On April 2, 2010, an explosion and fire at the Tesoro Refinery in Anacortes, Washington, killed seven people.\\8\\ On August 6, 2012, at the Chevron Refinery in Richmond, California, a fire involving flammable fluids endangered 19 Chevron employees and created a large plume of highly hazardous chemicals that traveled across the Richmond, California, area.\\9\\ Nearly 15,000 residents sought medical treatment due to the release. On June 13, 2013, a fire and explosion at Williams Olefins in Geismar, Louisiana, killed two people and injured many more.\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ For descriptions of NAICS codes, see http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch. \\5\\ For more information on the Executive Order see https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/01/executive-order-improving-chemical-facility-safety-and-security. \\6\\ CSB.

This section, among other things, requires certain Federal agencies to consider possible changes to existing chemical safety and security regulations. To solicit comments and information from the public regarding potential changes to EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR part 68), on July 31, 2014, EPA published an RFI (79 FR 44604). Information collected through the RFI has informed this proposal. Readers are encouraged to review the RFI, as this action will not reiterate the full discussion of all of its topics. EPA received a total of 579 public comments on the RFI. Several public comments were the result of various mass mail campaigns and contained numerous copies of letters or petition signatures. Approximately 99,710 letters and signatures were contained in these several comments. Discussion of RFI public comments pertaining to topics included in this proposal can be found below in section IV. Prevention Program Requirements, section V. Emergency Response Preparedness Requirements and section VI. Information Availability Requirements. EPA seeks comment on the proposed amendments. Any suggestions for alternative options should include an appropriate rationale and supporting data for the Agency to be able to consider it for a final action. [[Page 13645]] A. Overview of EPA's Risk Management Program Regulations Both EPA's 40 CFR part 68 RMP regulation \\11\\ and Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) standard were authorized in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (1990 CAAA). This was in response to a number of catastrophic chemical accidents occurring worldwide that had resulted in public and worker fatalities and injuries, environmental damage, and other community impacts. OSHA published the PSM standard in 1992 (57 FR 6356, February 24, 1992), as required by section 304 of the 1990 CAAA, using its authority under 29 U.S.C. 653. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ 40 CFR part 68 is titled, ``Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions,'' but is more commonly known as the ``RMP regulation,'' the ``RMP rule,'' or the ``Risk Management Program.'' This document uses all three terms to refer to 40 CFR part 68. The term ``RMP'' refers to the document required to be submitted under subpart F of 40 CFR part 68, the Risk Management Plan. See http://www2.epa.gov/rmp for more information on the Risk Management Program. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The 1990 CAAA added accidental release provisions under section 112(r). The statute required EPA to develop a list of at least 100 regulated substances for accident prevention and related thresholds (CAA section 112(r)(3) through (5)), and authorized EPA to issue accident prevention regulations (CAA section 112(r)(7)(A)). The statute also required EPA to develop ``reasonable regulations'' requiring facilities with over a TQ of a regulated substance to undertake accident prevention steps and submit a ``risk management plan'' to various local, state, and Federal planning entities (CAA section 112(r)(7)(B)). EPA published the RMP regulation in two stages. The Agency published the list of regulated substances and TQs in 1994 (59 FR 4478, January 31, 1994) (the ``list rule'') \\12\\ and published the RMP final regulation, containing risk management requirements for covered sources, in 1996 (61 FR 31668, June 20, 1996) (the ``RMP rule'').13 14 Both the OSHA PSM standard and the EPA RMP rule aim to prevent or minimize the consequences of accidental chemical releases through implementation of management program elements that integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices. In addition to requiring implementation of management program elements, the RMP rule requires covered sources to submit (to EPA) a document summarizing the source's risk management program--called a Risk Management Plan (or RMP). The RMP rule required covered sources to comply with its requirements and submit initial RMPs to EPA by June 21, 1999. Each RMP must be revised and updated at least once every five years from the date the plan was initially submitted. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Documents and information related to development of the list rule can be found in the EPA docket for the rulemaking, docket number A-91-74. \\13\\ Documents and information related to development of the RMP rule can be found in EPA docket number A-91-73. \\14\\ 40 CFR part 68 applies to owners and operators of stationary sources that have more than a TQ of a regulated substance within a process. The regulations do not apply to chemical hazards other than listed substances held above a TQ within a regulated process. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- EPA later revised the list rule and the RMP rule. EPA modified the regulated list of substances by exempting solutions with less than 37% concentrations of hydrochloric acid (62 FR 45130, August 25, 1997). EPA also deleted the category of Department of Transportation Division 1.1 explosives, and exempted flammable substances in gasoline used as fuel and in naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures prior to initial processing (63 FR 640, January 6, 1998). EPA subsequently modified the RMP rule five times. First, in 1999, EPA revised the facility identification data and contact information reported in the RMP (64 FR 964, January 6, 1999). Next, EPA revised assumptions for the worst case scenario analysis for flammable substances and clarified what the Agency means by chemical storage not incidental to transportation (64 FR 28696, May 26, 1999). After the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (CSISSFRRA) was enacted on August 5, 1999, EPA excluded regulated flammable substances when used as a fuel or held for sale as a fuel at a retail facility (65 FR 13243, March 13, 2000). Later, EPA restricted access to offsite consequence analysis (OCA) data for the public and government officials to minimize the security risks associated with posting the information on the Internet (65 FR 48108, August 4, 2000). Finally, EPA revised the RMP executive summary to remove a requirement to describe the OCA; revised reporting deadlines for RMP reportable accidents and emergency contact changes; and made other minor revisions to RMP facility contact information (69 FR 18819, April 8, 2004). The RMP rule establishes three ``program levels'' for regulated processes: Program 1 applies to processes that would not affect the public in the case of a worst-case release and that have had no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years. Program 1 imposes limited hazard assessment requirements, requires coordination with local response agencies, and requires submission of an RMP. Program 2 applies to processes not eligible for Program 1 or subject to Program 3, and imposes streamlined prevention program requirements, including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation elements. Program 2 also imposes additional hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements. Program 3 applies to processes not eligible for Program 1 and either subject to OSHA's PSM standard under Federal or state OSHA programs or classified in one of ten specified industry sectors identified by their 2002 NAICS codes listed at Sec. 68.10(d)(1). These industries were selected because they had a higher frequency of the most serious accidents as compared to other industry sectors. The ten NAICS codes and the industries they represent are 32211 (pulp mills), 32411 (petroleum refineries), 32511 (petrochemical manufacturing), 325181 (alkalies and chlorine manufacturing), 325188 (all other basic inorganic chemical manufacturing), 325192 (cyclic crude and intermediate manufacturing), 325199 (all other basic chemical manufacturing), 325211 (plastics material and resin manufacturing), 325311 (nitrogenous fertilizer manufacturing), or 32532 (pesticide and other agricultural chemicals manufacturing).\\15\\ Program 3 imposes elements nearly identical to those in OSHA's PSM standard as the accident prevention program. The Program 3 prevention program includes requirements relating to process safety information (PSI), PHA, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change (MOC), pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractors. Program 3 also imposes the same hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements that are required for Program 2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ NAICS codes 325181 and 325188 are now combined and represented as 2012 revised NAICS code 325180 (other basic inorganic chemical manufacturing). NAICS code 325192 is now 2012 revised NAICS code 325194 (cyclic crude, intermediate, and gum and wood chemical manufacturing). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- On July 22, 2015, OSHA issued a revised interpretation to its PSM retail exemption at 29 CFR 119(a)(2)(i).\\16\\ This [[Page 13646]] interpretation now only allows facilities in NAICS codes 44 and 45, the retail trade, to be eligible for the retail exemption. As a result of this change, many agricultural chemical distributors who sell bulk anhydrous ammonia and some chemical warehouses, are no longer exempt from the PSM standard. This makes them subject to RMP Program 3 requirements, whereas before most were covered under Program 2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ See OSHA PSM Retail Exemption Policy https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&p_id=29528. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- EPA believes the RMP rule has been effective in preventing and mitigating chemical accidents in the United States and protecting human health and the environment from chemical hazards. However, major incidents, such as the West, Texas, explosion, highlight the importance of reviewing and evaluating current practices and regulatory requirements, and applying lessons learned from other incident investigations to advance process safety where needed. III. Additional Information A. What actions are not addressed in this rule? Under section 6 of Executive Order 13650, ``Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security,'' the Executive Order Working Group (chaired by EPA, OSHA, and Department of Homeland Security [DHS]) was tasked with enhancing safety at chemical facilities by identifying key improvements to existing risk management practices through guidance, policies, procedures, outreach, and regulations. As part of this task, the Working Group solicited public comment on potential options for improving chemical facility safety. Additionally, EPA gathered information from the public regarding potential changes to EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR part 68) via a RFI (79 FR 44604, July 31, 2014). Using the results from these efforts as well as information collected through implementing the Risk Management Program, EPA is proposing revisions to the RMP rule to advance chemical facility safety. However, this proposed rule does not address all of the topics included in the RFI. For example, EPA is not proposing any revisions to the list of regulated substances and is therefore not addressing ammonium nitrate (AN) in this proposed rule. EPA may propose listing additional hazardous substances in a separate action. Currently AN is not listed as a regulated substance under the RMP rule or the OSHA PSM standard. Required safe handling and storage practices for AN are covered under OSHA's Explosives and Blasting Agents Standard (29 CFR 1910.109) and includes coverage of fertilizer grade AN in section 1910.109(i). Section 1910.109(k)(2) requires that manufacturing of explosives must meet requirements under OSHA's PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119); this would include any explosive manufacturing process involving AN. OSHA is considering whether AN should be added to the Sec. 1910.119 Appendix A list of chemicals subject to the PSM standard, which could expand the standard's applicability to include processes at fertilizer mixers, distributors and wholesalers who store and handle AN. OSHA is also considering whether to make changes to the AN storage and handling requirements in their Explosives and Blasting Agents standard, which has requirements for AN stored with and without, explosives and blasting agents. DHS is considering potential modifications of its Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards (CFATS) regulation, including reviewing the applicability and/or modification of screening TQs for chemicals of interest in Appendix A in 6 CFR part 27, which include AN (79 FR 48693, August 18, 2014).\\17\\ We plan to coordinate any potential change to the list of substances 40 CFR part 68 with the actions of these other agencies. Therefore, EPA is not presently proposing that AN be added to the list of substances subject to the RMP rule, but the Agency may elect to propose such a listing at a later date. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ CFATS. 79 FR 48693, August 18, 2014. http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=DHS-2014-0016-0001. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. What is the agency's authority for taking this action? The statutory authority for this action is provided by section 112(r) of the CAA as amended (42 U.S.C. 7412(r)). Each of the portions of the Risk Management Program rule we propose to modify in this document are based on EPA's rulemaking authority under section 112(r)(7) of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7412(r)(7)). A more detailed discussion of the underlying statutory authority for the current requirements of the Risk Management Program rule appears in the action that proposed the Risk Management Program (58 FR 54190, 54191-93 [Oct. 20, 1993]). The prevention program provisions discussed below (auditing, incident investigation, and safer technologies alternatives analysis) address the ``prevention and detection of accidental releases.'' The emergency coordination and exercises provisions in this rule modify existing provisions that provide for ``response to such release by the owners or operators of the sources of such releases.'' (CAA 112(r)(7)(B)(i)). This paragraph calls for EPA's regulations to recognize differences in ``size, operations, processes, class and categories of sources.'' In this document, we propose to maintain distinctions in prevention program levels and in response actions authorized by this provision. The information disclosure provisions discussed in this document generally assist in the development of ``procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance in order to protect human health and the environment.'' This information disclosure ensures the emergency plans for impacts on the community are based on more relevant and accurate information than would otherwise be available and ensures that the public can become an informed participant in such emergency planning. IV. Prevention Program Requirements A. Incident Investigation and Accident History Requirements 1. Summary of Existing Investigation Requirements Currently, owners or operators of facilities with processes subject to Program 2 and Program 3 are required to investigate each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (Sec. Sec. 68.60 and 68.81). The RMP rule defines a catastrophic release in Sec. 68.3 as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion, involving one or more regulated substances that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment. Imminent and substantial endangerment includes offsite consequences such as death, injury, or adverse effects to human health or the environment, or the need for the public to shelter-in-place or be evacuated to avoid such consequences. Facility owners or operators are required to determine the factors that contributed to the incident and develop recommendations resulting from the investigation. The PHA (Sec. 68.67 (c)(2)) is required to address previous incidents which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences. In the preamble to the existing final rule, EPA explained that while most catastrophic releases affect workers first, there are incidents where workers are protected but the public and the environment may be threatened (e.g., emergency relief devices are designed to vent hazardous atmospheres away from the workplace [[Page 13647]] and into the air where they may be carried downwind). The PHA should recognize and address the potential offsite impact associated with safety measures that protect workers (e.g., by installing a control device on an emergency vent). The RMP rule requires that facility owners and operators consider such possibilities and integrate the protection of workers, the public, and the environment into one program. Thus, RMP facility owners and operators must investigate each significant incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release with on- or offsite consequences. 2. Catastrophic Release Definition In the 1996 final rule (61 FR 31687, June 20, 1996), EPA developed a definition of catastrophic release similar to the definition OSHA used in the PSM standard, with modifications to cover events that presented imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\\18\\ This ensured that owners or operators of sources covered by both OSHA and EPA requirements investigated not only accidents that threatened workers, but also those that threatened the public and the environment. Because EPA modified OSHA's definition of catastrophic releases so that offsite impacts were covered, there has been confusion among some owners and operators of facilities subject to the RMP rule; some believe they should not have to investigate accidents involving only workers for the purposes of fulfilling requirements under the RMP rule. EPA recognized that the PHA process must address potential offsite impacts associated with safety measures that also protect workers, and that the final rule would ensure that all sources routinely consider such possibilities and integrate protection of workers, the public and the environment into one program. In similar fashion, EPA believes that incident investigation was not intended to be and should not be limited to only those incidents with offsite impacts. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ The OSHA definition of catastrophic release is similar to the current definition of the term in the RMP rule. However, OSHA's definition pertains to incidents that present serious danger to employees in the workplace. (see 29 CFR 1910.119(b) for the full definition) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Learning from accident causes identified from incident investigations involving only workers can also lead to preventing incidents with further impacts to the surrounding community and therefore, findings and recommendations from all incidents, regardless of who is impacted, should be addressed. In the preamble to the 1996 final RMP rule (61 FR 31711, June 20, 1996), EPA emphasized that ``any incident with the potential for catastrophic consequences in the workplace will also have had the potential for catastrophic consequences offsite.'' Thus, facility owners or operators should be investigating incidents even if they only impacted workers, as these could have potentially been an accident impacting the public or the environment. EPA has not defined or clarified the term ``imminent and substantial endangerment'' but did make revisions in the 1996 final RMP rule in order to better define accidents to be reported under the RMP accident history requirements. To make the requirement less vague and less subject to a wide variety of interpretations, the final rule required that accident history shall include all accidental releases from covered processes ``that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.'' EPA also provided a definition for ``offsite'' and ``injury.'' EPA is proposing to modify the definition of catastrophic release to be identical to the description of accidental releases required to be reported under the accident history reporting requirements in Sec. 68.42. The proposed definition, in Sec. 68.3, replaces ``that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment'' with impacts that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. This better defines the impacts for incidents requiring investigations that caused or could have caused these impacts and clarifies EPA's intent, rather than leaving it open for interpretation. This is consistent with the accident impacts that must be reported under the 5-year accident history, which EPA considered relevant to include in 1996 ``because it may reflect safety practices at the source'' and because ``accidental releases from covered processes which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, involve failures of sufficient magnitude that they have the potential to affect offsite areas.'' \\19\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ EPA. May 24, 1996. Risk Management Plan Rule, Summary and Response to Comments. Volume 1, pp. 3-11 and 17-4. Docket No. A-91- 73, Document No. IX-C-1. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As required by section 609(b) of the RFA, the EPA convened a Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) Panel to obtain advice and recommendations from small entity representatives (SERs) that would potentially be subject to the rule's requirements. As part of the SBAR Panel process, some SERs indicated that EPA's proposed modification of the definition of catastrophic release would in effect expand that definition, and thereby require investigation of incidents that did not fall under the previous definition. SERs noted that EPA's current definition includes releases that present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment, and that such releases represent only ``major'' accidents, and not smaller releases that endanger only workers or on-site property. As noted above, EPA's view is that accidents with only on-site impacts warrant investigation because they have the potential to affect offsite areas. Additionally, since such accidents already clearly fall within the accident history reporting criteria, regulated sources would already need to investigate them, even without the incident investigation provisions, in order to determine the accident history information required under Sec. 68.42, which includes data (e.g., initiating event and contributing factors) that could only be determined through an investigation. Therefore, EPA believes that redefining the term catastrophic release to include the categories of accidents that require reporting under the accident history provisions clarifies, rather than expands, that definition. Nevertheless, EPA seeks comment on the proposed revision to the catastrophic release definition, whether it expands the scope of the current definition instead of clarifying it, and whether the definition should be limited to loss of life; serious injury; significant damage; or loss of offsite property. 3. Root Causes The cause of an incident is often the result of a series of other problems that need to be addressed to prevent recurrences. For example, an operator's mistake may be the result of poor training, inappropriate procedures, or poor design of control systems; and equipment failure may result from improper maintenance, misuse of equipment (e.g., operating at too high a temperature), or use of incompatible materials. These types of causes are commonly referred to as causal factors (also known as contributing causes, contributory causes, contributing [[Page 13648]] factors, or critical factors). The Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) defines a causal factor as a major unplanned, unintended contributor to the incident (a negative occurrence or undesirable condition), that if eliminated would have either prevented the occurrence, or reduced its severity or frequency.\\20\\ These are factors that facilitate the occurrence of an incident such as physical conditions and management practices. Causal or contributing factors usually have underlying reasons why they occurred, which are known as root causes. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ CCPS. March 2003. Guidelines for Investigating Chemical Process Incidents, 2nd ed., pp.3, 62, 181, 434. CCPS, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, New York, NY. John Wiley and Sons. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most root causes are associated with weaknesses, defects or breakdowns in management systems.\\21\\ Identifying root causes provides the mechanism for understanding the interaction and impact of system management failures, so that the root causes can be addressed and the maximum benefit is obtained from an incident investigation. CCPS defines a root cause as a fundamental, underlying, system-related reason why an incident occurred that identifies a correctable failure(s) in management systems. There is typically more than one root cause for a process safety incident. Correcting only the immediate cause of an incident (e.g., operator error) may prevent the identical incident from occurring at the same location, but may not prevent similar incidents. Instead, identifying and addressing incident contributing factors and their root causes helps eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of reoccurrence of the incident and other similar incidents. The current Risk Management Program incident investigation requirements under Sec. Sec. 68.60 and 68.81 do not explicitly require root causes to be determined and reported, rather they only require ``the factors that contributed to the incident.'' Facility owners and operators that conduct incident investigations that only identify ``factors that contributed to the incident'' may miss identifying the underlying, system-related reason why an incident occurred (which would be revealed in a root cause analysis). Thus EPA is proposing to require a root cause analysis to ensure that facilities determine the underlying causes of an incident to reduce or eliminate the potential for additional accidents resulting from deficiencies of the same process safety management system. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ EPA recognizes that some root causes could be events that management systems could not have prevented or protected against. The analytic techniques used to identify root causes account for such events. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Lack of Root Cause Analysis for Prior Incidents Below are examples of incident investigations that identified similar prior incidents within the same facility or company where root causes for the prior incidents were not analyzed and determined. This resulted in missed opportunities to address the proper causes of the incidents, share the lessons learned and prevent further similar incidents. On January 21, 1997, at a Tosco refinery, effluent piping on a hydrocracker reactor ruptured, causing an explosion and fire, killing one operator and injuring 46 other Tosco and contractor personnel. The accident was caused by an uncontrolled temperature excursion in the reactor resulting in an excessively high temperature that caused the pipe to rupture.\\22\\ Operators did not follow prescribed emergency depressurizing procedures for extremely high temperature occurrences and attempted to control the temperature by other means. Investigations of prior incidents involving unsafe temperature excursions were inadequate and not all these excursions were documented. Failure to investigate these ``near-misses'' resulted in a missed opportunity to determine why operators were not following prescribed emergency depressurizing procedures and to develop solutions to address the cause. After the 1997 accident, the company designed the depressurizing system to activate automatically when the reactor temperature exceeded safe operating limits. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ EPA.

An accident investigation determined that raw materials and a catalyst were charged too quickly to a reactor, causing a runaway reaction generating too much heat and pressure, which caused the reactor to explode. Prior to the accident, the facility had recently experienced a near miss involving similar circumstances.\\24\\ An operator added chemicals to a batch resin process at too high a rate. Other alert operators noted the procedural deviation and were able to prevent an accident.

An EPA/OSHA accident investigation determined that these check valves were not appropriately designed and manufactured for the heavy-duty service to which they were subjected in the olefins production unit.\\25\\ Similar problems with the check valves had occurred previously at the facility and at other facilities owned by the company, but the occurrences were not adequately investigated and did not identify all the factors involved in the valves' failure. The other valve failure occurrences did not result in as severe consequences as the 1997 event and were treated as maintenance failures, not incidents or accidents. Thus, the lessons that could have been learned from these prior failures were not adequately identified, shared, and implemented. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ EPA and OSHA.

Residents in a 100 city-block area were confined to their homes. Nine workers were injured, two with severe burns. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) determined that Morton could have corrected safety problems in the process if they had conducted investigations into any of the eight prior instances when process temperatures exceeded [[Page 13649]] the normal range.\\26\\ Process and design changes resulting from such investigations could have prevented the 1998 explosion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\26\\ CSB. 2000.

The explosion and fire destroyed most of the reactor facility and adjacent warehouse and ignited PVC resins stored in the warehouse. Smoke from the smoldering fire drifted over the local community, and as a precaution, local authorities ordered an evacuation of the community for two days. CSB determined that this incident occurred when an operator drained a full, heated, and pressurized PVC reactor and bypassed a pressure interlock.\\27\\ The safeguards to prevent bypassing the interlock were insufficient for the high risk associated with this activity. Two similar incidents at FPC USA PVC manufacturing facilities highlighted problems with safeguards designed to prevent inadvertent discharge of an operating reactor. The FPC USA Environmental Health & Safety group had received reports of both incidents, but did not recognize a key similarity: Operators could mistakenly go to the wrong reactor and bypass safeguards to open a reactor bottom valve. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ CSB.

The incident occurred during the startup of an isomerization (ISOM) unit when a raffinate splitter tower was overfilled and pressure relief devices opened, resulting in a flammable liquid geyser from a blowdown stack that was not equipped with a flare. The release of flammables led to an explosion and fire. All of the fatalities occurred in or near office trailers located close to the blowdown drum. A CSB investigation found that in the years prior to the incident, eight serious releases of flammable material from the ISOM blowdown stack had occurred, and most ISOM startups experienced high liquid levels in the splitter tower.\\28\\ The investigation identified root causes of the accident involving senior leadership failures including: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ CSB.

Root causes identified involving plant management failures included: Lack of an effective reporting and learning culture (incidents were often ineffectively investigated); use of outdated plant policies and procedures; poor design of the ISOM unit; inadequate supervision of operators; inadequate training of operators; and ineffective consideration of human factors regarding training, staffing, and work schedules for operators. The ineffective investigation of previous incidents resulted in a failure to identify, or act upon, lessons from incidents and near- misses. This includes a failure to incorporate relevant safety lessons from a British government investigation \\29\\ of incidents at BP's Grangemouth, Scotland, refinery, which were relevant to the Texas City refinery. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\29\\ Health and Safety Executive (United Kingdom) and Scottish Environment Protection Agency.

The ammonia travelled directly over a shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, where more than 800 people were working, causing 152 people to be treated at hospitals, four of whom were admitted into intensive care units. An EPA investigation of the incident revealed that Millard failed to adequately address a well-known risk for ammonia production systems called hydraulic shock, which can cause catastrophic equipment failures.\\30\\ EPA also discovered that Millard had two prior smaller ammonia releases in April 2007 and January 2010 caused by hydraulic shock. Company investigations of those incidents failed to identify and correct this problem, which could have prevented the catastrophic release that occurred in August 2010. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\30\\ EPA.

Current Use of Root Cause Analysis Root cause analysis of accidents is an accepted safe management practice used by many industries. The American Chemistry Council (ACC) noted that root cause analysis is conducted routinely under a number of voluntary programs, including Responsible Care.\\31\\ The Texas Pipeline Association (TPA) stated that a requirement to perform a root cause analysis was not needed because it is a common industry practice.\\32\\ However, the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) stated that they supported modifying current regulations to include a requirement that root cause analyses be conducted for incidents but not for near misses or process upsets because defining a ``near miss'' or ``process upset'' is extremely difficult and will likely vary by industry, process, locations and the like.\\33\\ EPA addresses the difficulty of defining the term ``near miss'', in section IV.A.7. Near Misses. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ ACC. October 29, 2014.

For example, CCPS offers several resources, including the ``Guidelines for Investigating Chemical Process Incidents,'' 2nd edition, which provides valuable, practical reference tools, and focuses on process-related incidents with real or potential catastrophic consequences.\\34\\ ACC further notes that there are a number of companies that provide excellent root cause failure analysis training. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\34\\ CCPS 2003.

California's Contra Costa County ISO, pp. 5, 12-13, 17-19. http://cchealth.org/hazmat/pdf/iso/Chapter-450-8-RISK-MANAGEMENT.pdf. \\36\\ A major chemical accident is defined in the ISO as one meeting a level 2 or 3 incident classification as determined by the county or one resulting in: One or more fatalities; at least three persons hospitalized for at 24 hours; on- and/or offsite property damage (including clean-up and restoration activities) initially estimated at $500,000 or more; or a vapor cloud of flammables and/or combustibles that is more than 5,000 pounds. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) requires investigation of all extraordinarily hazardous substance accidents or potential catastrophic events. The TCPA requirements have the same incident investigation requirements found in Sec. 68.81, but the TCPA investigation report requires additional information beyond the requirements in Sec. 68.81.\\37\\ The TCPA investigation report must include: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\37\\ New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) TCPA.

Time and location of the chemical accident or potential catastrophic event; A description of the chemical accident or potential catastrophic event in chronological order, providing all the relevant facts; The identity, amount, and duration of the chemical release if these facts can be reasonably determined based on the information obtained through the investigation; The consequences, if any, of the chemical accident or potential catastrophic event, including the number of evacuees, injured, and fatalities, and the impact on the community; The factors that contributed to the chemical accident or potential catastrophic event that includes an identification of basic and contributory causes, either direct or indirect; and The names and position titles of the investigators. Once the incident scenario is understood and contributory causes identified, this information may be used to determine the incident's root causes which are the underlying systemic reasons related to a failure in a management system. EPA believes that providing the following information is vital for understanding the nature of the incident and should be included in the incident investigation report: The chronological order of details of the incidents, the chemical identity, amount and duration of the release, the impacts of the release, and basic and contributory causes, either direct or indirect. Some facility owners or operators may already include this information in incident investigation reports prepared to comply with the RMP rule; however, EPA is proposing that Sec. Sec. 68.60 and 68.81 be revised to require this information to ensure clarity and consistency among reports. To better address causes of incidents and further reduce the occurrence of catastrophic releases, EPA is proposing to require that for all Program 2 and Program 3 process incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release, the owner or operator determine and identify the factors that contributed to the incident, including immediate and contributory causes, either direct or indirect, and root causes. EPA is proposing to define ``root cause'' (see Sec. 68.3 for the proposed definition). Root causes shall be determined by conducting a root cause analysis for each incident using a recognized method or approach. CCPS' ``Guidelines for Investigating Chemical Process Incidents'' discusses incident investigation approaches and techniques and root cause analysis methods.\\38\\ OSHA plans to develop a fact sheet on existing resources that explain how to conduct root cause analyses so the regulated community can better understand the causes of incidents and can increase its capability to effectively prevent future occurrences.\\39\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\38\\ CCPS. March 2003. Guidelines for Investigating Chemical Process Incidents, 2nd ed. \\39\\ Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group. May 2014. Executive Order 13650 Report to the President--Actions to Improve Chemical Facility Safety and Security--A Shared Commitment, p. 47. https://www.osha.gov/chemicalexecutiveorder/final_chemical_eo_status_report.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In order that lessons learned from incident investigations be applied, EPA is proposing to modify the hazard review requirement in Sec. 68.50(a)(2) and the PHA requirement in Sec. 68.67(c)(2) to require the owner or operator to address findings from all incident investigations required under Sec. Sec. 68.60 and 68.81, respectively. EPA is also proposing to require that for incident investigations conducted by Program 2 sources, an incident investigation team be established and consist of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. This requirement is already part of Program 3 incident investigation requirements, and is a necessary component for investigations that would include analysis of root causes. EPA seeks comment on the proposed amendments of the incident investigation requirements to require root cause investigations for each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release and on the proposed definition for root cause. EPA seeks comment on whether a root cause analysis is appropriate for every RMP reportable accident and near miss. Should EPA eliminate the root cause analysis, or revise to limit or increase the scope or applicability of the root cause analysis requirement? If so, how should EPA revise the scope or applicability of this proposed requirement? EPA also seeks comment on proposed amendments to require consideration of incident investigation findings, in the hazard review (Sec. 68.50) and PHA (Sec. 68.67) requirements. Finally, EPA seeks comment on the proposed additional requirement in Sec. 68.60 to require personnel with appropriate knowledge of the facility process and knowledge and experience in incident investigation techniques to participate on an incident investigation team. 6. Decommissioned Processes EPA has encountered some cases where a facility chose not to conduct an incident investigation because the owner or operator elected to decommission the process involved, or because the process was destroyed in the incident. While an investigation would have no impact on a decommissioned or destroyed process, other similar processes or operations at the facility, or at similar facilities, could potentially benefit from its findings. CCHS and two industry associations commented that there are lessons that can be learned from requiring investigations to be performed, even in cases where the owner or operator elects to decommission the process involved or where the process is destroyed in the incident.40 41 Therefore, EPA is proposing to revise Sec. Sec. 68.60 and 68.81 to clarify that incident investigations are required even if the process involving the regulated substance is destroyed or decommissioned following or as the result of an incident. EPA is also proposing to revise Sec. 68.190, which addresses updates to the RMP, to [[Page 13651]] require that prior to any de-registration of a process or stationary source that is no longer subject to the Risk Management Program rule, the owner or operator must report any accidents subject to the requirements of Sec. 68.42 and conduct incident investigations as required under Sec. Sec. 68.60 and/or 68.81. EPA seeks comment on the proposed revisions to require an owner or operator to meet applicable reporting and incident investigation requirements prior to de- registering a process. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\40\\ CCHS.

Near Misses The current incident investigation provisions require facilities with Program 2 and/or 3 processes to investigate incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release. These types of incidents are sometimes characterized as ``near misses'' but there is confusion about what this term means. Several commenters on the Risk Management Program RFI, including the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA),\\42\\ American Petroleum Institute (API),\\43\\ Gas Processors Association (GPA),\\44\\ National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA), & Corn Refiners Association (CRA),\\45\\ and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM),\\46\\ stated that they interpret the current requirements as including near misses. Other commenters (ACC,\\47\\ TPA,\\48\\ CGA,\\49\\ DPC Industries, Inc.,\\50\\ and Allied Universal Corp [AUC]) \\51\\ urged EPA to not require investigations of near misses because the term is vague, inherently situation-specific and not reducible to a singular definition. CCPS defines a near miss as an event in which an accident causing injury, death, property damage, or environmental impact, could have plausibly resulted if circumstances had been slightly different.\\52\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\42\\ SOCMA.

March 2003. Guidelines for Investigating Chemical Process Incidents, 2nd ed., p. 61. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- EPA itself may have contributed to the confusion over the meaning of the term ``near miss.'' In the 1993 proposed RMP rule (58 FR 54200, October 20 1993), EPA indicated that investigation of near misses could provide facilities with important information on problems that should be addressed before a significant accidental release occurs. EPA considered a near miss as a mishap that did not result in a release for some reason, such as employee actions or luck. However, in the primary interpretive guidance document for the RMP rule, ``General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR part 68)'' (RMP Guidance), originally published in 1999, EPA indicated that while the owner or operator ``must investigate each incident which resulted in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance,'' the owner or operator was not required to investigate ``minor accidents or near misses:'' You should also consider investigating minor accidents or near misses because they may help you identify problems that could lead to more serious accidents; however, you are not required to do so under part 68.\\53\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\53\\ See General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR part 68), EPA-550-B-04-001, April 2004, page 6-26. http://www2.epa.gov/rmp/guidance-facilities-risk-management-programs-rmp#general. Here, EPA intended to differentiate between incidents, which ``could have resulted in a catastrophic release,'' and ``minor accidents and [minor] near misses,'' which are unlikely to have led to a catastrophic release. EPA's experiences with RMP facility inspections and incident investigations show there have been incidents that were not investigated, even though under slightly different circumstances, the incident could have resulted in a catastrophic release. While these events did not result in deaths, injuries, adverse health or environmental effects, or sheltering-in-place, if circumstances had been slightly different, a catastrophic release could have occurred. For example, a runaway reaction that is brought under control by operators is a near miss that may need to be investigated to determine why the problem occurred, even if it does not directly involve a covered process both because it may have led to a release from a nearby covered process or because it may indicate a safety management failure that applies to a covered process at the facility. Similarly, fires and explosions near or within a covered process, any unanticipated release of a regulated substance, and some process upsets could potentially lead to a catastrophic release. Facilities regulated under New Jersey's TCPA program are required to investigate each regulated chemical (``extraordinarily hazardous substance''), involved in an accident or potential catastrophic event.\\54\\ The NJDEP notes that ``potential catastrophic event'' means an inci"
