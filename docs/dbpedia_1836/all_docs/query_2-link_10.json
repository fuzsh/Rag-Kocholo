        "meta_description": "Abstract. With a few exceptions, most studies on tropospheric ozone (O3) variability during and following the COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) economic downturn focused on high-emission regions or urban environments. In this work, we investigated the impact of the societal restriction measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on surface O3 at several high-elevation sites across North America and western Europe. Monthly O3 anomalies were calculated for 2020 and 2021, with respect to the baseline period 2000â2019, to explore the impact of the economic downturn initiated in 2020 and its recovery in 2021. In total, 41 high-elevation sites were analyzed: 5 rural or mountaintop stations in western Europe, 19 rural sites in the western US, 4 sites in the western US downwind of highly polluted source regions, and 4 rural sites in the eastern US, plus 9 mountaintop or high-elevation sites outside Europe and the United States to provide a âglobalâ reference. In 2020, the European high-elevation sites showed persistent negative surface O3 anomalies during spring (MarchâMay, i.e., MAM) and summer (JuneâAugust, i.e., JJA), except for April. The pattern was similar in 2021, except for June. The rural sites in the western US showed similar behavior, with negative anomalies in MAM and JJA 2020 (except for August) and MAM 2021. The JJA 2021 seasonal mean was influenced by strong positive anomalies in July due to large and widespread wildfires across the western US. The polluted sites in the western US showed negative O3 anomalies during MAM 2020 and a slight recovery in 2021, resulting in a positive mean anomaly for MAM 2021 and a pronounced month-to-month variability in JJA 2021 anomalies. The eastern US sites were also characterized by below-mean O3 for both MAM and JJA 2020, while in 2021 the negative values exhibited an opposite structure compared to the western US sites, which were influenced by wildfires. Concerning the rest of the world, a global picture could not be drawn, as the sites, spanning a range of different environments, did not show consistent anomalies, with a few sites not experiencing any notable variation. Moreover, we also compared our surface anomalies to the variability of mid-tropospheric O3 detected by the IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite instrument. Negative anomalies were observed by IASI, consistent with published satellite and modeling studies, suggesting that the anomalies can be largely attributed to the reduction of O3 precursor emissions in 2020.",

        "text": "Tropospheric ozone (hereafter simply referred to as O3) is a short-lived climate forcer (Szopa etÂ al.,Â 2021) that plays a key role in the climate system. It is one of the most powerful anthropogenic greenhouse gases (the third most important, after carbon dioxide and methane), and it also impacts the lifetime of methane, which is one of the O3 precursors (Monks etÂ al.,Â 2015; Gulev etÂ al.,Â 2021). Moreover, at the surface it also has adverse effects on ecosystems, crop productivity, and human health (Fleming etÂ al.,Â 2018; Mills etÂ al.,Â 2018).\n\nThe COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic emerged in late 2019 and initiated a global economic downturn in 2020, which was characterized by a drastic reduction of emissions related to several sectors, such as private transportation and both domestic and international aviation (e.g.,Â LeÂ QuÃ©rÃ© etÂ al.,Â 2020; Friedlingstein etÂ al.,Â 2022). The reduction of emissions turned into a reduction of air pollutants that can directly be related to O3 variability due to its photochemical formation from O3 precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NM-VOCs).\n\nSeveral studies in the past few years have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 economic downturn on O3 concentrations and variability at global, regional, and local scales (Gkatzelis etÂ al.,Â 2021; Sokhi etÂ al.,Â 2021). However, most of these works focused on high-emission sources or urban environments (Sicard etÂ al.,Â 2020; Adam etÂ al.,Â 2021; ChossiÃ¨re etÂ al.,Â 2021; Keller etÂ al.,Â 2021). A number of studies indicated varying O3 behavior as a function of the reduction in the emissions, mainly dependent on whether the photochemical O3 formation in the considered regions was NOx- or VOC-limited (Gaubert etÂ al.,Â 2021; Matthias etÂ al.,Â 2021; Mertens etÂ al.,Â 2021; Cuesta etÂ al.,Â 2022).\n\nConcerning free-tropospheric values, which could be considered representative of background atmospheric conditions, Steinbrecht etÂ al. (2021) reported a reduction of O3 of 7â% (â¼â4âppb) from April to AugustÂ 2020 in the 1â8âkm altitude region of northern midlatitudes with respect to the 2000â2020 climatological mean. Cristofanelli etÂ al. (2021) observed reductions in the 2020 monthly mean O3 values (with respect to a 25-year climatological mean) at a mountaintop site in Italy. Other studies have indicated the presence of negative O3 anomalies in the free troposphere in 2020, mainly as a consequence of emissions reductions (Bouarar etÂ al.,Â 2021; Clark etÂ al.,Â 2021; Miyazaki etÂ al.,Â 2021). Chang etÂ al. (2022) determined that the free-tropospheric O3 negative anomalies in 2020 were the most profound since 1994 for both Europe and western North America and that the 2020 anomalies had a weakening influence on the 1994â2019 positive O3 trends above these regions. The O3 reductions in the free troposphere were also confirmed by the work of Ziemke etÂ al. (2022), in which satellite measurements of tropospheric column O3 show that the 2020 negative anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere occurred again in springâsummer 2021.\n\nIn this study, we analyzed the O3 variability at 41 high-elevation sites across the globe, representative of different environments and emission source regions, during the COVID-19 economic downturn. The aim of this work is to determine if the negative O3 anomalies observed in the free troposphere (e.g.,Â Bouarar etÂ al.,Â 2021; Clark etÂ al.,Â 2021; Steinbrecht etÂ al.,Â 2021; Chang etÂ al.,Â 2022; Ziemke etÂ al.,Â 2022) also occurred in the boundary layer by focusing on a selection of mountaintop and high-elevation monitoring sites with available data up to December 2021. Therefore, our study will cover both the COVID-19 economic downturn in 2020 and the following year of 2021, which was associated with a recovery of emissions representative of a pre-pandemic level.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. SectionÂ 2 will present the methodologies adopted, Sect.Â 3 will focus on the discussion of the results obtained, and conclusions will be drawn in Sect.Â 4.\n\n3.1âOzone trends\n\nA trend analysis spanning the first 2Â decades of the 21st century for long-term observational datasets collected at high-elevation remote and rural locations was performed for most of the stations. The overall picture is reported in Fig.Â 2, where decadal O3 trends are reported by latitude and grouped by each of the regions considered in this study (Fig.Â 1). The calculation period of the trends is 2000â2021 (or shorter for some stations, when data back to 2000 were not available); a recent study (Chang etÂ al.,Â 2023a) has shown that, for MBO, the long-term positive trend was clearly weakened when including the anomalous year 2020 compared to 2004â2019, but the trend rebounded in 2021, between the 5th and 95th percentiles. The variations of the long-term trends at all of the sites, computed by varying the calculation periods of the trends (i.e., 2000â2019, 2000â2020, and 2000â2021), are reported in Table S1. In several cases, the trends did not reveal any relevant impact of the 2020 anomalies, while for 10 sites the 2000â2020 trend was weakened compared to 2000â2019, and a rebound was observed when including 2021. It is interesting to note that for the European sites above 1500âmâa.s.l. (i.e., CMN, JFJ, SNB, and ZSF) the long-term trend was weakened when including 2020 and continued to weaken with the addition of 2021 data (see TableÂ S1).\n\nDownload\n\nConsidering the full 2000â2021 record, the observed trends for the 41 high-elevation sites vary greatly from â4.79 to 2.82âppb per decade. Decreases in surface O3 were observed for 30 European and North American sites, with the exceptions of MBO (2.82âppb per decade) and GNP (1.30âppb per decade). The trend values for the sites belonging to the OT category showed large differences, with O3 increases recorded for TLL (2.26âppb per decade) and MKN (1.70âppb per decade); on the other hand, PDI (although limited by the rather short reference period) and SUM station showed O3 decreases (â4.79 and â2.37âppb per decade, respectively). Both Antarctic sites showed positive trends (SPO: 1.33âppb per decade, and DCC: 0.32âppb per decade), which are in line with previous studies described in Kumar etÂ al. (2021). It has to be noted that the trend at DCC could be affected by the large data gap in the measurements between 2014 and 2016, and this will certainly need further investigation.\n\nThe trends for most of the sites in western North America considered in this study were previously reported by Chang etÂ al. (2023a), although considering a slightly longer period (1995â2021). Their results are consistent with the ones reported in Fig.Â 2 for the WUS_R and WUS_P categories, indicating that the majority of the sites in western North America show a consistent pattern of negative trends, pointing to an overall decrease in regional boundary layer O3. The clear outlier is MBO, but this site is uniquely situated on the summit of an isolated mountain. During nighttime conditions reported here, MBO is strongly influenced by the lower free troposphere, which has experienced a small increase in O3 since the 1990s (Chang etÂ al.,Â 2023a); during summer and autumn MBO is also impacted by ozone produced from western forest fires, which have become more frequent in recent years (Farley etÂ al.,Â 2022; Jaffe etÂ al.,Â 2022). It has to be noted that the inclusion of 2020 and 2021 in the analysis did not cause any notable variation in the trend values for several sites across the western US (see Table S1), with the effects of the COVID-19 economic downturn on the long-term trends only visible when considering the spring season (Chang etÂ al.,Â 2023a).\n\nDespite their variability when considering different periods for the trend calculation, the trends for the European sites over 2000â2021 showed persistent negative values when compared to previous literature (e.g.,Â Cristofanelli etÂ al.,Â 2020; Christiansen etÂ al.,Â 2022). While the trends for JFJ and SNB remained almost unchanged, CMN showed a larger negative trend with respect to the 1996â2016 trends reported in Cristofanelli etÂ al. (2020), and ZSF showed a higher (i.e., a less negative) value with respect to this reference period. The positive trends in the Southern Hemisphere are in line with the modeled trends reported by Wang etÂ al. (2022) and with the trends obtained from the TCR-2 chemical reanalysis (Miyazaki etÂ al.,Â 2020).\n\nRegarding positive trends, model studies report increases in the tropospheric ozone burden occurring mainly in the free troposphere (700â250âhPa, seeÂ Fiore etÂ al.,Â 2022), while the surface trends tend to be mixed, especially for the extratropical regions in the Northern Hemisphere (see alsoÂ Miyazaki etÂ al.,Â 2020; Chang etÂ al.,Â 2023a). This is indeed the case for the European and North American sites reported here (see Fig.Â 2), indicating that surface O3 trends are often not related to the trends observed in the free troposphere (Gulev etÂ al.,Â 2021), as also reported by Chang etÂ al. (2023a). However, we emphasize that the sites in Fig.Â 2 only cover a limited portion of the Earth's surface, as we are limited by the available observations, and these results cannot be assumed to be representative of the entire world.\n\nDownload\n\n3.2âQuantification of the anomalies\n\nFigureÂ 3 provides a detailed summary of the anomalies for each site, which are grouped by region and ordered by latitude. FigureÂ S4 in the Supplement shows the same anomalies, but in the form of monthly time series, together with the mean anomalies for the different regions. FigureÂ 3 shows widespread persistent negative anomalies affecting most of the sites in 2020 in both spring (MarchâMay, i.e., MAM) and summer (JuneâAugust, i.e., JJA). The situation was somewhat similar in 2021, although some sites showed partial O3 rebounds (e.g., the sites in the western US). A closer look at the mean seasonal differences for the regions is provided in TableÂ 2, while the focus on the spatial distribution of the anomalies (for the sites in North America and western Europe) for 2019, 2020, and 2021 is provided in Figs.Â S5âS7 of the Supplement.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nBy analyzing seasonal means of the anomalies, the western US rural (WUS_R) sites experienced persistent negative anomalies for MAM and JJA 2020 (â6â% and â5â%, respectively), as well as for MAM 2021 (â2â%), while JJA 2021 was characterized by a strong positive anomaly (2.8âppb, 6â%). Late summer 2020 was characterized by the spread of wildfires in the western US (Filonchyk etÂ al.,Â 2022; Jaffe etÂ al.,Â 2022; Peischl etÂ al.,Â 2023; Langford etÂ al.,Â 2023), resulting in positive mean anomalies for August and September 2020 (2.3 and 2.5 ppb, i.e., 5â% and 6â%, respectively) for several sites (see Fig.Â S6). Without considering August 2020, the JJA 2020 seasonal mean would result in a much more pronounced negative anomaly, i.e., â4.5âppb (â10â%), giving an indication of the magnitude of the secondary production of O3 following the spread of wildfires and thus partly influencing the strong negative anomaly that characterized this region following the 2020 COVID-19 economic downturn. As reported by the World Meteorological Organization (2022), the fire season in western North America in 2021 was also very intense, with the annual total estimated emissions ranking in the top one-third of the years 2003â2021, and contributed to widespread air pollution. The emissions produced by the large widespread wildfires that impacted North America in these months can also explain the different patterns in the western US compared to eastern US and Europe (see Fig.Â 4).\n\nThe situation for the four western US sites downwind of polluted areas (WUS_P) was slightly different, with the negative anomalies being larger than those of WUS_R in MAM 2020 (â4.1âppb, â9â%), and positive anomalies for 2021 (3â% for both MAM and JJA 2021). The mean anomaly in JulyÂ 2021 is slightly weaker compared to the WUS_R mean due to the negative anomaly at the JOT site (Fig.Â 4), despite the other stations being heavily impacted by the North American wildfires (the mean, excluding JOT, for JJA 2021 was 2.8âppb or 5â%).\n\nThe sites in the eastern US (EUS) category experienced negative anomalies in 2020 (â4â% and â12â% for MAM and JJA, respectively) and in JJA 2021 (â8â%) and a positive anomaly in MAM 2021 (3â%). It is interesting to note that, in both of the summer seasons, the EUS sites exhibited an opposite structure with respect to WUS_R and WUS_P sites.\n\nThe European sites (EUR) were characterized by persistent negative anomalies throughout all of the considered seasons in TableÂ 2. MAM 2020 reported a total negative anomaly (â2.0âppb, â3â%) but was characterized by an interesting increase in O3 concentrations in April, with values almost comparable to the 2000â2019 values, for all stations (even HPB at lower elevation registered a positive anomaly for April 2020; see Fig.Â 3 and Fig.Â S6 in the Supplement). This feature was previously observed at CMN by Cristofanelli etÂ al. (2021), who reported that these higher O3 values were possibly attributed to the frequent occurrence of transport from the free troposphere, transport from areas usually not considered sources of anthropogenic pollution (i.e., the Mediterranean Sea or northern Africa), or the transport of stratospheric air masses. The negative anomalies then continued (except a positive anomaly in JuneÂ 2021 for HPB, SNB, and ZSF) until September 2021, when all EUR sites experienced a rebound in O3 values and registered positive anomalies until the end of theÂ year.\n\nWhile TableÂ 2 reports mean values for the âotherâ (OT) sites, a consistent âglobalâ picture cannot be drawn, as these sites behaved very differently from each other (see Fig.Â 3). The SUM (and, partly, IZO) anomalies are more in line with the EUR sites, while DEN, MLO, MKN, and TLL had alternating positive and negative anomalies. PDI showed by far the largest negative anomalies in the first half of 2020 (mean of â8.3 ppb from January to October, â20â%), but unfortunately no information on possible O3 recovery in 2021 is available due to missing data. The distant Antarctic sites, on the other hand, did not reveal any signal of influence from the COVID-19 economic downturn, with O3 values perfectly in line with or even higher than the climatological means for both DCC and SPO. For more details about the interannual variability at each site, please refer to Figs.Â S8âS48 in the Supplement.\n\n3.3âAnomaly attribution\n\nThe results presented in Sect.Â 3.2 are in line with those reported in Ziemke etÂ al. (2022), who observed reduced values of tropospheric column ozone (TCO) in springâsummer 2020 and 2021 and who attributed the decrease to reduced pollution (i.e., reductions of â¼â10â%â20â% in tropospheric NO2 in the Northern Hemisphere). More specifically, Ziemke etÂ al. (2022) indicate a reduction of 3 Dobson units of TCO, corresponding to a â¼â7â%â8â% decrease for the area 20ââNâ60ââN. If we consider the seasonal means, excluding the OT category, we obtain almost comparable results for 2020 for the surface O3 observations (mean negative anomalies of â6â% and â7â% for MAM and JJA, respectively). The situation is different in 2021, for which we obtain higher values (0â% for MAM and â6â% for JJA if we consider EUS and EUR only to exclude wildfire influence). However, it has to be noted that we considered only a selection of sites and that in some cases our seasonal means can be determined by a combination of sub-seasonal positive and negative anomalies (see Sect. 3.2), possibly due to the impact of other âlocalâ factors.\n\nAs 2020 was characterized by an unusual stratospheric O3 depletion event over the Arctic (Dunn etÂ al.,Â 2021), we investigated the possible role of the reduced stratospheric input in O3 concentrations measured at the high-elevation sites. The minimum in the total column O3 was observed in March 2020, and this value rapidly recovered in the following months (e.g.,Â Dunn etÂ al.,Â 2021; Chang etÂ al.,Â 2022). The effects of this O3 depletion on the anomalies were also analyzed by Steinbrecht etÂ al. (2021), and simulations from the NASA GMI model indicated that this depletion contributed to less than one-quarter of the observed anomalies in the troposphere. Moreover, Ziemke etÂ al. (2022) indicate that the observed reduction in stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange (STE) in 2020 did not drive the anomalies in the free troposphere, as NASA satellite measurements showed negative tropospheric O3 anomalies in both 2020 and 2021, whereas the meteorological conditions controlling the strength of STE were close to the climatological means in 2021; thus, they suggested that the tropospheric anomalies can be largely attributed to decreases in emissions. This was further confirmed by our results: TableÂ 2 shows that most of the regions considered in this study showed the largest O3 anomalies in JJA 2020 rather than MAM 2020. Therefore, we hypothesize that the reduction in the stratosphere-to-troposphere transport that occurred in 2020 could have played only a minor role in modulating the O3 anomalies.\n\n3.3.1âColumn O3 variability from IASI\n\nReductions in mid-tropospheric O3 seen by the IASI satellite instrument are similar to the ones from the surface observations. FigureÂ 5 shows the 2008â2020 variability of O3 in the 3â6âkm column (both monthly means and anomalies) for three specific regions: (i)Â an area around the European Alpine sites (i.e., EUR, 40â50ââN, 5â20ââE), (ii)Â the eastern US (EUS, 35â50ââN, 85â70ââW), and (iii)Â the western US (WUS, 30â50ââN, 125â100ââW). As stated in Sect.Â 2.2, the 3â6âkm column corresponds to the maximum sensitivity of the IASI retrieval in the free troposphere and is, thus, superior to the 0â3âkm column, where the retrieval sensitivity is more limited and the column is not independent of the column above. We did not include 2021 in the analysis as IASI-A operations stopped before the end of the year and all the measurements were not done in the nominal mode of the satellite and the instrument.\n\nDownload\n\nIn all three regions reductions in the 3â6âkm column O3 were observed in 2020 for both the monthly means and the anomalies. Mean negative anomalies were continuously observed throughout MAM and JJA 2020. The anomalies in MAM 2020 were quite similar among the regions, i.e., â3â% for EUS, â4â% for EUR, and â5â% for WUS. A similar anomaly (â6â%) was also observed for WUS in JJA 2020, and these negative values also persisted in fall (SON), indicating that the wildfire influence had only a minor impact at this upper layer with respect to the surface monitoring sites. For both EUR and EUS, negative anomalies were still observed in JJA 2020 (â1â% and â7â%, respectively), and a rebound occurred in SON, with values falling within 1 standard deviation of the 2008â2019 climatological mean. The smaller EUR anomaly with respect to EUS in JJA 2020 can be explained by the increase in concentrations that characterized the European region in June.\n\nDespite the differences due to the subsets investigated in this study, these results are comparable to the reductions in free-tropospheric O3 observed by Steinbrecht etÂ al. (2021), i.e., â7â% (with respect to the 2000â2020 climatological mean) from April to August and for the 1â8âkm layer in the Northern Hemisphere. Moreover, the behavior of the anomalies observed here is consistent with the tropospheric O3 anomalies shown by Miyazaki etÂ al. (2021) and Ziemke etÂ al. (2022) discussed above, including the rebound in SON, resulting in column O3 values comparable to the previous years. However, it has to be noted that our anomalies are weaker than the ones presented in Ziemke etÂ al. (2022), as we are limiting the IASI measurements to land regions around our measurement sites, while Ziemke etÂ al. (2022) observed the largest negative 2020 and 2021 anomalies above the ocean areas of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n3.3.2âEmissions reductions\n\nTo investigate the reductions in the emissions, we analyzed data from the Carbon Monitor, a near-real-time dataset of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement production, available since January 2019 (Liu etÂ al.,Â 2020).\n\nTablesÂ 3 and 4 report the CO2 global emissions variations from the Carbon Monitor, divided into the different sectors, for the combinations of 2019, 2020, and 2021. As also done above for the characterization of the anomalies, here we consider 2019 to be the reference year for âpre-COVID-19â emissions and 2020 and 2021 to be the ones affected by the COVID-19 economic downturn, with a possible recovery in emissions. By analyzing all sectors together, we can immediately spot the decrease in emissions occurring in 2020 with respect to 2019 (â5.3â%) and the strong rebound of emissions in 2021 (+0.5â% and +6.1â% with respect to 2019 and 2020, respectively). The rebound of emissions near pre-COVID-19 levels was also analyzed in other recent works, indicating that fossil fuel CO2 emissions in 2021 nearly pushed global emissions back to 2019 levels (Jackson etÂ al.,Â 2022) and that 2021 emissions would have even exceeded the 2019 values if not for several low-income countries that had not recovered from the pandemic yet (Davis etÂ al.,Â 2022).\n\nAs the strongest O3 anomalies presented in this study are clustered in the western US and Europe, we also focused on regional CO2 anomalies by analyzing the US and Europe values provided by the Carbon Monitor (see TablesÂ S2 and S3 in the Supplement). In this case, no distinction between the western and eastern US is made, and Europe is considered to be composed of the emissions in the 27 European Union countries plus the United Kingdom. While the decrease in 2020 emissions with respect to 2019 was evident for both regions (â10.9â% and â10.1â% for Europe and the US, respectively), the rebound to pre-COVID-19 levels (i.e., 2021 against 2019 emissions) was smaller for these two areas with respect to the global rebound (â2.7â% and â4.5â% for Europe and the US, respectively). This may be one of the causes of the persistent O3 negative anomalies that still characterized 2021. For Europe, the O3 negative anomalies that were observed throughout MAM and JJA 2021 could be partly explained by an incomplete recovery in the emissions (â2.9â% and â6.3â% for MAM and JJA, respectively, considering all sectors together). For the US, the CO2 anomalies are more evident in MAM 2021 (â5.8â%) than in JJA (â0.3â%).\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nAnalyzing the different sectors separately, the limits imposed on domestic and international aviation caused the largest negative variations in 2020 with respect to pre-COVID-19 levels; these sectors witnessed the largest rebounds in 2021, although they did not return to 2019 levels (and this was particularly true for international aviation, where a total difference of â48.3â% and â33.9â% was still observed for Europe and the US, respectively). Particularly for the rural and remote sites, aircraft emissions play a key role in determining the tropospheric O3 trends, mainly because of the aircraft emitting NOx in the middle and upper troposphere, where O3 production efficiency is high (Wang etÂ al.,Â 2022). Therefore, this incomplete recovery in aircraft emissions for 2021 could partly explain the persistent negative anomalies observed. Also, ground transport and, to a lesser extent, residential emissions variations showed the same behavior (while this was true for the global and US emissions, Europe had larger emissions for these two sectors in 2021 with respect to 2019; see TableÂ S2). On a global scale, rebounds in 2021 for power and industry were so large that the emissions in this year exceeded those of 2019 (3.9â% and 2.2â% for power and industry, respectively); on the other hand, positive emissions anomalies in these two sectors were observed for European industry emissions only, with negative emissions observed in the US and for the power sector for both regions.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nDownload\n\n3.4âPossible O3 recovery in 2022\n\nThe data presented in this study concerned the first full year after the 2020 COVID-19 economic downturn (i.e., ending in DecemberÂ 2021), and therefore little information on the possible recovery of O3 values to pre-COVID-19 levels is present. Nevertheless, the datasets discussed here are to date the most comprehensive time series for investigating these anomalies from high-elevation stations. The availability of validated 2022 data for the four mountaintop WMO/GAW global stations in Europe (i.e., CMN, SNB, ZSF, and JFJ) allowed us to investigate the possible rebound of O3 values for this specific European area that encompasses the Alps and the northern Apennines (see Fig.Â 6). In this case, the monthly data were again detrended before the calculation of the anomalies, but with respect to the whole 2000â2022 period; the reference for the calculation of the climatology was still the 2000â2019 period.\n\nAt all four sites, the negative 2000â2019 trends became increasingly more negative when including the 2020 and 2021 data (see Sect.Â 3.1 and TableÂ S1). But the inclusion of the 2022 data slightly shifted the trends back towards the pre-pandemic levels, i.e., â2.35âppb per decade (Â±â1.53âppb per decade, p<0.01) for CMN, â1.34âppb per decade (Â±â0.74âppb per decade, p<0.01) for SNB, â0.52âppb per decade (Â±â0.77âppb per decade, p=0.18) for ZSF, and â0.64âppb per decade (Â±â1.04, p=0.22) forÂ JFJ.\n\nWhen looking at monthly O3 values and anomalies (Fig.Â 6), an overall rebound for 2022 seems evident in the first part of the year (January to March) for all four sites, with monthly means comparable to the climatology, while the anomalies from April to June showed negative values. The values for the rest of the year were generally within 1Â standard deviation of the climatological means, with 2Â months (July and August) exhibiting higher monthly means with respect to the 2000â2019 baseline. The characteristics of the O3 rebound in 2022, which are commonly shared among the high-elevation sites located in western Europe, will certainly need deeper investigation, especially for the attribution of the lower values observed from April to June, given that no restrictions driving the variability of the O3 precursors were present in 2022. Other than meteorological variations, mineral dust transport has been proven to significantly reduce the O3 values at these high-elevation sites (e.g.,Â Duchi etÂ al.,Â 2016). As the first half of 2022 was largely affected by Saharan mineral dust transport events reaching western Europe (in both March and June 2022), these could have played an important role in lowering the O3 values in this period.\n\nIn this paper we demonstrated that the negative O3 anomalies that were observed in the free troposphere in recent studies also occurred in the boundary layer surrounding several high-elevation sites. This was done by investigating the surface O3 variability at 41 regionally distributed high-elevation sites following the COVID-19 economic downturn that occurred in 2020 and the following year of 2021, associated with a recovery of emissions. Widespread persistent negative anomalies were observed both in spring (MAM) and summer (JJA) 2020 for all of the regions considered in this study, while for 2021 continuous negative anomalies throughout MAM and JJA were observed only for Europe and, partially, for the eastern US. On the other hand, the western US sites were heavily impacted by wildfire emissions in 2021, resulting in positive anomalies, especially for JJA and for the rural sites. A global picture for the rest of the world could not be drawn, as the sites span a range of different environments and did not show consistent patterns.\n\nThe anomaly behavior was further studied by analyzing the variability in the column O3 from the IASI satellite products. Consistent with previous studies (e.g.,Â Miyazaki etÂ al.,Â 2021; Ziemke etÂ al.,Â 2022), negative anomalies were also observed in the free-tropospheric 3â6âkm column O3 product for both MAM and JJA 2020 (â4â% for both seasons on average over the considered regions). These results indicate that one of the causes of such widespread anomalies is the reduction in the emissions of the O3 precursors. To further assess this point, we also investigated the reduction in the emissions for the different sectors for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, as derived from the Carbon Monitor, a near-real-time dataset of global CO2 emissions. The results highlight the decrease in emissions that occurred in 2020 with respect to 2019 (â10.9â% and â10.1â% analyzing all sectors together for both Europe and the US, respectively) and the rebound of emissions in 2021 that took place globally. However, the recovery in emissions in 2021 did not reach âpre-COVID-19â levels of 2019 in the two macro-regions that encompass most of the sites investigated here (â2.7â% and â4.5â% for Europe and the US, respectively), and this could be one of the causes of the persistent negative anomalies that were observed in these twoÂ areas.\n\nAs our dataset was limited to the first full year after the 2020 COVID-19 economic downturn, few conclusions could be drawn regarding the full recovery of O3 values to pre-COVID-19 levels. However, we made use of 2022 data for four mountaintop sites in western Europe, and we observed a common pattern concerning O3 variability in 2022. This was characterized by a rebound in the first part of the year (January to March), with monthly values comparable to the 2000â2019 climatology; then, from April to June negative anomalies were observed, and the values for the remaining part of the year were within 1Â standard deviation of the climatological averages. The rebound in O3 values starting from 2021â2022 will certainly need deeper investigation, especially concerning the attribution of the wide-ranging variability, and will be the subject of future research.\n\nAdam, M.Â G., Tran, P.Â T., and Balasubramanian, R.: Air quality changes in cities during the COVID-19 lockdown: A critical review, Atmos.
