DE lEYIZAC. BY MONSIKm KOUIN, BA LONDON: WILLIAM TEGO AND CO., 85, QUEEN-STREET, CHEAPSI0E. I-,,,,-,. i.GoogIc L;nn7,. I.Google EDITOR'S PREFACE. To add one word of eulogy to the high and weU-deserred Rputadon enjojed ij the works of M. de LeTizac, both in j&tgland and in Fiance, would be a work of supereroga- tion. In England, the learned author's Qrammar of the Frendi Tongue has been aniTeisally adopted as the model for our most celebrated Kholars to follow, bearmg, as it doea, the impress of sound practical knotrledge, a perfect command oTer the Tarious subjects treated of, and an ele- gance and pnritj of diction in its exercises, that indeed justify the French Academy in pronouncing him one of the best French grammarians, and of which no greater proof could possibly be afforded than their frequent quota- tion of him as a most competent authority. To base, then, a work, containing the modem alterations and amendments introduced into the French language, yet at the same time preserring the original Bules, Practical Examples, and Definitions, upon so Itiir a foundation, most evidently be safe. It has also been deemed expe- dient not to deriate from the subdivision of the Ele- mentary part of the Grammar Irom the General Syntax, and. of the General from the Particular or more difficult Syntax. The Author, approaching his subject with the respect and rererence due to its importance, has laboured care- i.Googlc IV PBKFACE. fully and minutely to point out and explain every diffi- culty which the student ia likely to encounter in his progreBS, and, by the addition of Rules and Observations of the highest importance, to leave his mind free irom all doubt or hesitation as to the proper course to pursue. A large space has been devoted to the practical method of insuring a correct Pronunciation of the French Tongue, a subject of the very first consequence, and one that is absolutely necessary to be well understood by the learner, to render his Study and attention of extensive benefit. For this reaaon, great pains have been taken to incul- cate this knowledge on his mind, and the principles laid dotm will be found invaluable aids in arriving at per- fection. The Vocabulary inserted in the work will prove of the highest utility in writing out the exercises, and its useful- ness is much enhanced from the gender being attached to each word. Numerous Moral Exercises, more consonant to our pre- sent parlance and customs, have been introduced, with a view of perfecting the work, and of accustoming the mind of the youthful learner to the phraseology of every-daj conversation. The difficulties which present themselve* from the frequent clashing of the two languages in their construction, have been maturely considered and observed upon, and the difference between the idioms of both tongues, a subject of some magnitude, so disposed of as to prevent and obviate the errors isto which the leaner would otherwise &11, from a literal translation. Phrases illustrating some of these difficulties, are placed at the end of the Work, and these wiU afford practical proofs of the points la question; the references to the Remaite mad* I.Google on these subjects in the hi>dy of the work, will also mnte- riallj assist the pupil. Some nsefal alterations hare been made in the general arrangement of the Work, calculated to lead the student giadually on his path, from the simplest to the most intricate portions of his study. The tjpi^craphical depart- ment has been carefully attended to, and the substance of the Rules and Regulations clearly pointed out by Roman or Italic characters, as the case required. As it is highly necessary that the pupil should not only be made acquainted with what he has to acquire, but ^onld also have &cility afforded him for immediately tuming to any remarks im a particular subject, a copious classified Table of Contents has been affixed, embracing under separate heads erery thing of the least utility, and so ample that it may be well termed a RiKunti ditailli ofthe whole Work. In these days of \"literary precocity,\" when science, dereloping its mighty attributes, brings distant regions to our own thresholds, as it were, and a Tisit to our neigh- bours on the other side of the Channel has become a mere summer's day excursion, it is not extraordinary that attempts should also he made to propel the human mind at an analogous rate, and that we see gigantic notices of French ivithout a Master, and French learned in Six Legtont, announced In onr public journals, and exhibited at every market-cross. That, from the commercial and scientific relations which this mighty country maintains witb the whole world, a perfect knowledge of a language ■o widely disseminated as that of the French, is of para- mount importance, no one will be hardy enough to deny; but we would warn the student against the lallaciousnebs i.GoogIc of sach Bfecioua promises, and invite him who wishes to attain a thorough knowledge of the grammatical difficul- ties and correct pronunciBitioQ of that copious and elegant tongue, to apply himself with unwearied attention to the rules here laid down, allowing due time for his mind to receive gradually the impress of correctness and of excellence. Sedulously and earnestly, the Author, himself a native of France, has exerted his ability to render this ivork acceptable to the student, and worthy of public patronage ; and he fearlessly lays before them the results of his untir- ing labours, with a firm couviction that they will receive that justice ever bestowed upon works calculated to remove the difficulties that strew the path of wisdom.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE FRENCH ALPHABET. The French Alphabet contaiDS twenty-five letters, which are divided into vowels and amsonantx. A vowel is the simple emission of the voice, forming an articulate sound by itself. A consonant, on the contrary, cannot be articu- lated without the assistance oi & vowel. (These two last observations with regard to the vow^'ls knd consonants, are general to any living language.) The vowels are a, e, i, o, tt, and y, which some- times has the sound of one t, and sometimes of ^'o. The nineteen remaining letters, b, c, d,/, g, h,j, k, l,m,n, p, g, r, *, t, r, x, z, are consonants. OF ACCENTUATION. Independently of the natural or primitive sounds of the five vowels, a,e, i, o, «, there are others pro- duced by means of the accents placed upon the vowels. There are three accents, the acute (') never placed but on e, as in hoaXk, goodness; the ^atie ('} placed over rt, e, w, as in voila, behold; proces, lawsuit ; oi>, where ; the drcumflex (') employed over any long vowel, as platre, plaster; r6ve, dream; ^pitre, epistle; apotre, apostle; bflche, log of wood. The acute accent, which runs from right to left, gives a sharp sound to the vowel, and must be pro- nounced with the moutli almost closed. The grave, on the contrary, formed from /aft to right, ^ves ti broad sound, obtained by disclosing the teeth, and dwelling on the vowel, i.GoogIc 4 FRENCH BOUNDS. The circtimfiex, which is the combination of the grave and the acute, is pronounced very near as the grave, with this difference, that it requires more time to pronounce the vowel than with the grave. Due attention should be paid by the learner to the above accents, which not only change the eoonds of the vowels, but sometimes the meaning of the words : for instance, p^he, a peach ; p^che, a sin ; la, the; la, there; ou, or', oD, where; du, of the \\ Ail, owed, participle past of to owe.

The following French simple sounds may be divided in three classes. In the first they are pro- duced by the five vowels, a, e, i, o, n, with no other assistance but their respective accents. In the second class, the simple sounds are obtuned by the combination of the vowels eu, ou. In the third, the simple sounds, which are also called nasal, owing to tneir being produced a little through the nose, are formed by the coalition of m or n with each of the vowels, as am, em, en ; im, in ; oniy on ; tan, un. i.GoogIc VBCKCU SOUNDS.

Second, at the end of proper names, as in David, Obed, Gad, Alfred, &c., and in some other words of one or two syllables, as Cid, Sud, Sund, Talmud, iphod. Third. Generally at the end of words before a Towel or h mute, d takes the sound of t, as quandil vUndra; un grand homme; vend-ill kc, pronounced quaa-til, gran-tomme, ven-til; but d is silent in Bond, gond, fond, nid, rueud, muid, and pied, except in de Jond en camile, de pied en cap, tmirpiec^d- I G(H\")glc boule, avoir UH pied a terre, where d final is sounded as t. D is sounded double in some few words derived from the Latin, as in ad-dition, ad-ducteur, red- dition. F is sounded in French as in English. The final / is generally sounded as well before words which begin with a consonant, as before those which begin with a Towel, as soi/ brulante and soif ardtnte; vif disir &11A vif-umonr ; but it is silent ia clef, cerf, cerf-volant, chef-i^ueuvre, which words must be pronounced as follows : cle, cer, cer-volant, ' ch^-d'<Buvre. It is sounded in serf, slave, and in the singular number of the following words: ceuf, nerf, bmuf, but it ia silent in the plural, and pro- nounced ceu, ner, boeu ; however, the dropping of the/in the pronunciation of the above three words takes place sometimes in the singular when they are accompanied by a modificative adjective, as un teu/* dur, un oeu dur ; un nerfdilicat, un ner d^lica ; wn bceuf sali, un boeu Bal6, but/ is sounded in beaif a la mode. F has the sound of v in the numerical word neuf, nine, before a vowel or A mute, as H y a neuf am, netif kotivmes, pronounced neuv ans, neuv liommea; but it is sounded in neuf de cceiir, de carreau, de pique, de trefie (at cards), and in the adjective M£u/, new, both in the singular and plural nuuiber, as un habit neuf, des habits netifs.

G IS silent in signet, of a book, and Regnard, a French poet, pronounced sinet, renard.* H as in English, is sometimes aspirated and more frequently mute ; fur example : it is aspirated in le heros, and mute in thho'isme.-f When /i is immediately preceded by a p in the words derived from Greek or Hebrew, these two letters united together, are sounded as an /, for instance in the following words : sirapbin, Japhel, Philippe, Phalaris, Pkarsale, phjfsique, p/tilosophie, sphinx, &c.

However, h is silent in ex&muser, exhaut$ement. — (AcadA H after r or t, is always silent, as rhiteur, Jthdne, rhtAarbe, thi, Thamise, Thomas, thym, &c. ; but it is generally aspirated in the names of towns or countries, as la Haye, le Havre, le Hanovre, &c, ■J has always the sound of a in azure, or $ in pleasure, as Jits, jamais, joviai,jot0ou, jt^uhe. Jot' K is constantly sounded as in the English word Aing. This letter occurs but very seldom in the French langu^e. L when double and preceded by ai, et, om, has the liquid sound, as in tne English words brilliant, William, ser^lio. MtSer I /malier \\ The same liquid pronunciationtakes placein some few words where the double I is preceded only by an i, aa^lle, guenille, guille, briller, ke. It has again the same sound in words endii^ in ail, eil, ueil, and onil, with one /only, as in travail, rivdl, cercueil, oeil, fenmtil, and in some others which end in i'^ as mil (in the signification of mU- iet,) a seed. Observations. — In some words, as sourdl, outil, ckeml, baril, gattil, the letter I is unsounded, and they are prononnced the same as if they were spelt oati, eheni, sourci, bsri, genti ; bat / is alwaya i.GoogIc _^_^ 22 FRENCH BOUMDH sounded in cil a.nd pMl, and in the [iliiral, the s is silent, as well as in fils, a son, in which word the / is also omitted in the pronunciation; hut in _/f/, thread, it is always heard, except also the *, which in the plural is equally silent. The same remark applies to poll, pronounced poel, the hair of an animal, and to il, ils, personal pronoun, where the s is silent when the next word does not begin with a vowel, or an A mute. Ill in the middle of words isgenerally liquid, and the few exceptions to this rule are ordinarily met with in words derived from the Latin, as distiller, distillare, osciller, o^^cillare, scmtiUer, scintillare, &c. The same observation may be applied to words begiDning with ill as illastre, illustris, e, illuminer, illuminare, &c. It may be observed that whenever a French word comes from the Jjatin, the double I is distinctly pronounced, but never with the liquid sound. Gtniit/iomme, a gentleman, is pronounced with the liquid sound, jantilliome, and in the plural gat- tilshommes is sounded gentizome. At. When the letter m is at the end of a word, it has but the nasal soimd, {see p. 5); therefore, nom, parjum, /aim, are pronounced the same as if they were spelt non, parfuri, lain; but in most foreign proper names, as jJlirahani, Jerusalem, Stockholm, Amsterdam, &;c , the m is sounded as if it were followed by a mute e.

ORTHOGRAPHICAL FRENCH SIGNS Besides the accents already mentioned page 3, there are some other signs frequently used in the French language, viz., the apostrophe, the cedilla, the ditBresis, and the hyphen ; as to the comma, ienticolon, colon, period, interrogation, notes of admiration and exclamation, parenthesis, &c., they are the same in the French as in the fins^lish language; we therefore shall not say more or the punctuation. OF THE APOSTROPHE AND ELISION. The apostrophe (') marks the suppression of a vowel before another vowel or h mute, which is not sounded in the pronunciation, as Tamour, the love, imttead of le amour ; I'histoire, the history, instead of la histoire ; festime, the esteem, instead of la estime, Sec. Observations, 1 . Eleven monosyllables admit of the apostrophe, viz., ce, de,je, la, le, me, ne, que, se, te, and si. Si tequires the apostropne only before i7, ils, pronouns of the third person placed before the verbs. 2. The apostrophe is used also after presque and i.GoogIc SIGNS AND PUNCTCATIOK. etitre, wlien in composition with another word beginning with a vowel, as 3 Kpretqut tie. Entr'aclt, an interlude, fentr'aiiier, to belp one another, tnfr'otmrir, to balf open, praqalU, peninsula. Except the above cases, entre and presgue keep the mute e, as in presgiM ^al, rerf near equal. cnlreeux, tntrteOet, between tbemaelrea. prtaqiu attUr, almoit the whole. Lorsque, when, ptus^ue, since, juotaue, although, que, that, require tne apostrophe before the words elle, il, on, un, une, and in their compounds ; as LoTsqu'^ viad, vihea she comei, instead <^ longut tBe. jndtqu'il tame, eince be loves her, .. piaaqueUlaaiwu. gttoiipi'on ait dit, though tbe; may hare said, qiioiqia at. qu'wu/amu eoii vertueiat, let a woman b« vinuous, que lae. It is more elegant to say and to write guoique Con and 51 Con than quoiqu'tm and si on \\ uiis last ex- pression si on is particularly to be avoided on account of the hiatus. 3. Jusque when followed immediately by a, au, id, here, alors, then, attjourtChui, to-day, requires also the apostrophe, as A^'d til] to ju»qu-au jusqu-iai till here >«4»'<.for. tUltben j^agu'-d-aujovrd-hM till to-da; ; and not Jusqi^aiiiourd' /mi, which is never said.
