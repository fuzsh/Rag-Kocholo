        "text": "“Stranger danger.” It’s short. It’s simple. It even rhymes! But it is not the most effective abduction prevention lesson for our children.\n\nThe concept of “stranger” may be difficult for kids. Many believe that strangers are mean, ugly people — so the nice man asking for help to find his lost puppy? Not a stranger.\n\nChildren also should learn that some strangers – like store clerks, police officers, or parents with children – can be helpful when they are in need. It may be hard for kids to understand the difference between strangers who could hurt them and strangers who may help them.\n\nMost importantly, “stranger danger” ignores the fact that most children are abducted by someone they know. Avoiding strangers will not help if the abductor is a family member, neighbor, or family acquaintance. When you talk to your children about abduction prevention, don’t focus on warning them about certain types of people. Instead, teach them to identify and respond to threatening situations.\n\nDON'T SAY\n\nYou can tell someone is bad just by looking at them.\n\nDO SAY\n\nPay attention to what people do. Tell me right away if anyone asks you to keep a secret, makes you feel uncomfortable, or tries to get you to go somewhere with them.\n\nOf all the questions that cross parents’ minds when they hear about child abductions, the most common question may be how can I stop this from happening to my child?\n\nSome parents try to protect their kids by teaching them about “stranger danger”– but most child abductions involve a relative or someone the child knows. Teaching children about strangers is not enough. Parents should learn when and where children may be at risk of abduction. They should also teach kids about these situations and what to do if they occur. This helps prepare children to act even if the risk of abduction is from someone they know.\n\nNCMEC’s review revealed one extremely important fact: 83% of children who escaped their would-be abductors did something proactive. They walked/ran away, yelled, kicked, or pulled away. This means the best thing a child can do if someone tries to abduct them is take action instead of being passive or polite.\n\nUse this information to set up a safety plan for your kids – and don’t forget to include teens in these conversations! You can:\n\nAre you familiar with the news show segments testing children’s safety knowledge? They often feature “strangers” trying to lure children with offers of ice cream, modeling contracts, or other goodies. Too many times, these tricks are successful.\n\nIn these scenarios, even children who know better often ignore their safety rules. Would-be abductors count on this. They know that while many children are taught to avoid strangers, they may not be taught to recognize abduction tactics.\n\nNCMEC has noted the use of more than 100 of these tactics. Below are some examples. Review them with your children and practice a response. The more children practice, the better prepared they will be in a real situation.\n\nA THE EMERGENCY TRICK\n\nSomeone fakes an emergency and offers to take the child to another location.\n\nBEAT IT\n\nInstruct your child to never go anywhere with anyone without asking the permission of the adult in charge. Have your child practice saying, “I can’t go with you until I check with my mom/dad/teacher” in a firm voice and walking away.\n\nTHE HELP TRICK\n\nThe child is asked to help with something such as directions, looking for a lost pet, or carrying something.\n\nBEAT IT\n\nAdults should ask other adults for help, not children. Have your child practice saying “I can’t help you” in in a firm voice. Teach children to stand at least one to two arms’ lengths away while interacting with unknown adults.\n\nTHE “BAD” CHILD TRICK\n\nSomeone accuses the child of doing something wrong and says the child must go with him or her.\n\nBEAT IT\n\nTeach your child to always check with you or the adult in charge before going anywhere with anyone. Instruct children to immediately tell you if someone approaches them or tries to take them away."
