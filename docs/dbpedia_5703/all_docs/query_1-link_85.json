        "text": "Why does a child develop Selective Mutism?\n\nThe majority of children with Selective Mutism have a genetic predisposition to anxiety. In other words, they have inherited a tendency to be anxious from one or more family members. Very often, these children show signs of severe anxiety, such as separation anxiety, frequent tantrums and crying, moodiness, inflexibility, sleep problems, and extreme shyness from infancy on.\n\nChildren with Selective Mutism often have severely inhibited temperaments. Studies show that individuals with inhibited temperaments are more prone to anxiety than those without shy temperaments. Most, if not all, of the distinctive behavioral characteristics that children with Selective Mutism portray can be explained by the studied hypothesis that children with inhibited temperaments have a decreased threshold of excitability in the almond-shaped area of the brain called the amygdala. When confronted with a fearful scenario, the amygdala receives signals of potential danger (from the sympathetic nervous system) and begins to set off a series of reactions that will help individuals protect themselves. In the case of children with Selective Mutism, the fearful scenarios are social settings such as birthday parties, school, family gatherings, routine errands, etc.\n\nSome children with Selective Mutism have Sensory Processing Disorder (DSI) which means they have trouble processing specific sensory information. They may be sensitive to sounds, lights, touch, taste and smells. Some children have difficulty modulating sensory input which may affect their emotional responses. DSI may cause a child to misinterpret environmental and social cues. This can lead to inflexibility, frustration and anxiety. The anxiety experienced may cause a child to shut down, avoid and withdraw from a situation, or it may cause him/her to act out, have tantrums and manifest negative behaviors.\n\nSome children (20-30%) with Selective Mutism have subtle speech and/or language abnormalities such as receptive and/or expressive language abnormalities and language delays. Others may have subtle learning disabilities including auditory processing disorder. In most of these cases, the children have inhibited temperaments (prone to shyness and anxiety). The added stress of the speech/language disorder, learning disability, or processing disorder may cause the child to feel that much more anxious and insecure or uncomfortable in situations where there is an expectation to speak.\n\nMore studies are necessary to fully assess speech/language abnormalities and Selective Mutism as well as processing disorders and Selective Mutism. It is important to note that there are many children with Selective Mutism who are early speakers without any speech delays/disorders or processing disorders.\n\nResearch at the Selective Mutism Anxiety Research and Treatment Center (SMart Center) indicates that there is a proportion of children with Selective Mutism who come from bilingual/multilingual families, have spent time in a foreign country, and/or have been exposed to another language during their formative language development (ages 2-4 years old). These children are usually temperamentally inhibited by nature, but the additional stress of speaking another language and being insecure with their skills is enough to cause an increased anxiety level and mutism.\n\nA small percentage of children with Selective Mutism do not seem to be the least bit shy. Many of these children perform and do whatever they can to get others attention and are described as professional mimes! Reasons for mutism in these children are not proven, but preliminary research from the SMart Center indicates that these children may have other reasons for mutism. For example, years of living mute and therefore have ingrained mute behavior despite their lack of social anxiety symptoms or other developmental/speech problems. These children are literally stuck in the nonverbal stage of communication. Selective Mutism is therefore a symptom. Children are rarely “just mute.” Emphasis needs to be on causes of the mutism and propagating factors of mutism.\n\nStudies have shown no evidence that the cause of Selective Mutism is related to abuse, neglect or trauma.\n\nWhy do so few teachers, therapists and physicians understand Selective Mutism?\n\nStudies of Selective Mutism are scarce. Most research results are based on subjective findings based on a limited number of children. In addition, textbook descriptions are often nonexistent, or information is limited, and in many situations, the information is inaccurate and misleading. As a result, few people truly understand Selective Mutism. Professionals and teachers will often tell a parent, the child is just shy, or they will outgrow their silence. Others interpret the mutism as a means of being oppositional and defiant, manipulative or controlling. Some professionals erroneously view Selective Mutism as a variant of autism or an indication of severe learning disabilities. For most children who are truly affected by Selective Mutism, this is completely wrong and inappropriate!\n\nResearch at the SMart Center indicates that children who seem oppositional in nature often have parents, teachers, and/or treating professionals who have pressured them to speak for months, perhaps years. Mutism not only persists in these children, but is negatively reinforced. These children may develop oppositional behaviors out of a combination of frustration, their own inability to make sense of their mutism, and others pressuring them to speak.\n\nAs a result of the scarcity and often inaccuracy of information in the published literature, children with Selective Mutism may be misdiagnosed and mismanaged. In many circumstances, parents will wait and hope their child outgrows their mutism (and may even by advised to do so by well-meaning, but uninformed professionals). However, without proper recognition and treatment, most of these children do NOT outgrow Selective Mutism and end up going through years without speaking, interacting normally, or developing appropriate social skills. In fact, many individuals who suffer from Selective Mutism and social anxiety who do not get proper treatment to develop necessary coping skills may develop the negative ramifications of untreated anxiety (see below).\n\nWhy is it so important to have my child diagnosed when he/she is so young?\n\nOur findings indicate that the earlier a child is treated for Selective Mutism, the quicker the response to treatment, and the better the overall prognosis. If a child remains mute for many years, his/her behavior can become a conditioned response where the child literally gets used to non-verbalizing. In other words, Selective Mutism can become a difficult habit to break!\n\nBecause Selective Mutism is an anxiety disorder, if left untreated, it can have negative consequences throughout the child’s life and, unfortunately, pave the way for an array of academic, social and emotional repercussions such as:\n\nWorsening anxiety\n\nDepression and manifestations of other anxiety disorders\n\nSocial isolation and withdrawal\n\nPoor self-esteem and self-confidence\n\nSchool refusal, poor academic performance, and the possibility of quitting school\n\nUnderachievement academically and in the work place\n\nSelf-medication with drugs and/or alcohol\n\nSuicidal thoughts and possible suicide\n\nAnxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses among children and adolescents. Our main objective is to diagnose children early, so they can receive proper treatment at an early age, develop proper coping skills, and overcome their anxiety. According to the US Surgeon General, our country is in a state of emergency as far as children’s mental health is concerned. 10% of children suffer from mental disorders, but less than 5% of these children are actually receiving treatment.\n\nIf parents suspect their child has Selective Mutism, what should they do?\n\nParents should initially remove all pressure and expectations for the child to speak, conveying to their child that they understand he/she is scared and it is hard to get the words out and that they will help their child through this difficult time. Praise the child’s efforts and accomplishments, support and acknowledge the difficulties and frustrations.\n\nParents should speak with their family physician or pediatrician and/or seek out a psychiatrist or a therapist who has experience with Selective Mutism. However, please note that having experience with Selective Mutism does not guarantee that the treatment approach and understanding is correct. In fact, a clinician with less experience, yet who has an excellent understanding of Selective Mutism may be an ideal choice for your child.\n\nWhat are the key questions to ask a potential therapist or physician?\n\nDo your homework! You will have a much better idea what to look for if you understand Selective Mutism. Educate yourself as much as possible before seeing any professional. Parents should read as much information as they can about Selective Mutism. The Selective Mutism Association website has countless pages of information and it is updated on a regular basis.\n\nKey questions to ask include:\n\nWhat are your areas of expertise?\n\nHave you ever treated a child with Selective Mutism? If so, how many and what are your success rates?\n\nWhat are your views on Selective Mutism? In other words, what are some of the reasons a child manifests mutism?\n\nWhat is your treatment approach to Selective Mutism?\n\nWhat will be my role as a parent? What is the teacher’s role?\n\nWhat is your opinion on medication in treating Selective Mutism and when do you consider medication?\n\nCan you supply me with references of families you have worked with?\n\nHow will you work with my child to help him/her progress communicatively?*\n\n*Children do not progress communicatively without learning coping skills. Simply lowering anxiety is NOT enough to enable the child to begin engaging socially, learn to progress to verbal communication and feel comfortable in an environment. Skills must be taught.\n\nCaution: When speaking to potential treating professionals, please be cautious of those who see Selective Mutism as a controlling/manipulative behavior. Treatment approaches based on discipline and forcing a child to speak are inappropriate and will only heighten anxiety and negatively reinforce mute behavior.\n\nHow is a child evaluated for Selective Mutism?\n\nSocial Communication Anxiety Treatment® or S-CAT® is an evidenced-based program created by Dr. Elisa Shipon-Blum and implemented at the Selective Mutism Anxiety Research and Treatment Center (SMart Center). Presently, the SMart Center is the ONLY Center in the world that implements S-CAT®.\n\nDr. Elisa Shipon-Blum’s S-CAT® Program is based on the concept that Selective Mutism (SM) is a social communication anxiety disorder that is more than just not speaking. Families in the S-CAT® Program are provided with structured, individualized, step-by-step treatment.\n\nDr. Shipon-Blum has created the SM-Stages of Social Communication Comfort Scale© that describes the various stages of social communication possible for a child suffering from Selective Mutism. Children suffering from Selective Mutism (SM) change their level of social communication based on the setting as well as the expectations from others within a setting. As a result, social comfort and communication will change from setting to setting and person to person. The Social Communication Bridge®illustrates this concept in a visual form.\n\nFor example, a child may be “chatting up a storm” with their friend or family member in one setting, yet meet that same person in another setting (such as at school or perhaps at a family function) and the child may have difficulty socially engaging, communicating nonverbally and perhaps the child cannot communicate at all!\n\nFor some children, they appear very comfortable and mutism is the most noted symptom. This usually means they are able to engage nonverbally with others via astute nonverbal skills (professional mimes!) in most, if not all settings. These children are stuck in the nonverbal stage of communication (Stage 1) and suffer from a subtype of SM called Speech Phobia.\n\nAlthough mutism is the most noted symptom of SM, the inability to speak merely touches on the surface of our children. A complete understanding of the child is necessary to develop an appropriate treatment plan for home and in the real world, as well as in school by developing accommodations and interventions, e.g. IEP or 504 Plan.\n\nAccording to Dr. Shipon-Blum’s work, after a complete evaluation consisting of parent and teacher assessment forms such as the Selective Mutism Comprehensive Diagnostic Questionnaire (SM-CDQ)© and the SM School Evaluation Form©, and parent and child interviews, treatment needs to address three key questions:\n\nWhy did this child develop (including influencing, precipitating and maintaining factors)?\n\nWhy does Selective Mutism persist despite past treatment and/or parent/teacher awareness?\n\nWhat can be done at home, in school, and in the real world to help the child build the coping skills needed to overcome his/her social communication challenges?\n\nTo help a child suffering in silence, an understanding of which stage the child is in during particular social encounters must be developed. The Social Communication Anxiety Inventory (SCAI©) can be used to determine the stage of social communication on the Social Communication Bridge®. Treatment is then developed via the whole child approach under the direction of the treatment professional, the child, parents, and school personnel working together.\n\nDr. Shipon-Blum emphasizes that although anxiety lowering is key, it is often not enough, especially as children age. Over time, many children with Selective Mutism no longer feel anxious, but their mutism and lack of proper social engagement continue to exist in select settings.\n\nChildren with SM need strategies and interventions to progress from nonverbal to spoken communication. This is the Transitional Stage of Communication, an aspect missing from most treatment plans. In other words, how do you help a child progress from nonverbal to verbal communication?\n\nStrategies and interventions are developed based on where the child is on the Social Communication Bridge in a particular setting and are meant to be a desensitizing method as well as a vehicle to unlearn conditioned behavior. Time in the therapy office is simply not enough. The office setting is used to help prepare the child for the school and real world environments by developing strategies to help the child unlearn his or her conditioned behavior. Then, in the real world and within the school setting, the strategies and interventions are implemented.\n\nThe S-CAT® Program incorporates anxiety lowering techniques, methods to build self-esteem, and strategies and interventions to help with social comfort and communication progression. This may include bridging from shut down to nonverbal communication and then transitioning into spoken communication via the Verbal Intermediary®, Ritual Sound Approach®, and possibly the use of augmentative devices.\n\nChildren with SM need to understand, feel in control, and have choice in their treatment (age dependent). These are critical components of Social Communication Anxiety Treatment® strategies, which provide the child with choices and help to transfer the child’s need for control into the strategies and interventions.\n\nS-CAT® games and goals (based on age and where the child is on the Social Communication Bridge®) are used to help develop social comfort and ultimately progress into speech via the use of ritualistic and controlled methods. Strategy charts are used to help develop social comfort and progress into speech. Silent goals (environmental changes) and active goals (child directed goals based on choice and control) are some of the other tools used within the S-CAT® Program.\n\nEvery child is different and therefore an individualized treatment plan needs to be developed to incorporate home (parent education, environmental changes), the child’s unique needs, and school modifications (teacher education, accommodations and interventions). By lowering anxiety, increasing self-esteem, and increasing communication and social confidence within a variety of real world settings, the child suffering in silence will develop necessary coping skills to enable for proper social, emotional, and academic functioning.\n\nA trained professional familiar with Selective Mutism will have a parental interview. Emphasis will be on social interaction and developmental history, other manifestations of anxiety, behavioral characteristics (shy temperament), home life description (family stress, divorce, death, etc.) and medical history. From the results of the initial interview, the professional will often see the child. Children with Selective Mutism may or may not speak to the diagnosing professional. Whether or not a child speaks to the evaluating physician does not really matter. An astute professional should be able to assess interpersonal communication skills and build rapport quite easily and, if given at least one session and possibly viewing videotapes from home, can rule in or out Selective Mutism as a diagnosis.\n\nBecause 20-30% of children with Selective Mutism have an abnormality with speech and language, a thorough speech and language evaluation is often ordered. If motor/sensory issues exist an occupational therapy evaluation is also recommended. A complete physical exam (including hearing), standardized testing, psycho-educational testing as well as a thorough developmental screening are often recommended if the diagnosis is not clear.\n\nWhat are the diagnostic criteria for Selective Mutism?\n\nDSM-V-TR (2018) defines Selective Mutism as follows:\n\nConsistent failure to speak in specific social situations (in which there is an expectation for speaking, e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.\n\nThe disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication.\n\nThe duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of school).\n\nThe failure to speak is not due to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation.\n\nThe disturbance is not better accounted for by a Communication Disorder (e.g., stuttering) and does not occur exclusively during a Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Schizophrenia, or other Psychotic Disorder.\n\nAssociated features of Selective Mutism may include excessive shyness, fear of social embarrassment, social isolation and withdrawal, clinging, compulsive traits, negativism, temper tantrums, or controlling or oppositional behavior, particularly at home. There may be severe impairment in social and school functioning. Teasing or goading by peers is common. Although children with this disorder generally have normal language skills, there may occasionally be an associated Communication Disorder (e.g., Phonological Disorder, Expressive Language Disorder, or Mixed Receptive- Expressive Language Disorder) or a general medical condition that causes abnormalities of articulation. Intellectual disabilities, hospitalization or extreme psychosocial stressors may be associated with the disorder. In addition, in clinical settings children with Selective Mutism are almost always given an additional diagnosis of Anxiety Disorder, especially Social Phobia is common. (DSM-V-TR) (APA, 2018)\n\nAuthors note: The above criteria are quite vague/nonspecific and should not be used alone to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of Selective Mutism. As mentioned earlier, children with Selective Mutism manifest many behavioral characteristics other than mutism. In addition, since children with Selective Mutism often have difficulty responding and/or initiating nonverbally, Selective Mutism can be viewed as a communication disorder. In addition, children with autism, PDD-NOS, Aspergers and other developmental disorders can manifest mutism that is selective in location.\n\nHow is Selective Mutism treated?\n\nThe main goals of treatment should be to lower anxiety, increase self-esteem and increase social confidence and communication. Emphasis should never be on getting a child to talk. All expectations for verbalization should be removed. With lowered anxiety, confidence, and the use of appropriate tactics/techniques, communication will increase as the child progresses from nonverbal to verbal communication. Treatment approaches should be individualized, but the majority of children are treated using a combination of:\n\nSocial Communication Anxiety Therapy® (S-CAT®): This is the philosophy of treatment implemented at the Selective Mutism, Anxiety, and Related Disorders Treatment Center (SMart Center). This treatment includes development of an individualized treatment plan that focuses on the whole child and incorporates a TEAM approach involving the child, parent, school personnel, and treating professional. Recommended therapeutic tactics and techniques are implemented to build social comfort and progression of communication comfort (nonverbal and verbal) in various social settings (in and out of school). Because anxiety levels change from situation to situation, and often from one person to the next, methods often change from one social situation to another. Therefore, by lowering anxiety, increasing self-esteem, as well as increasing communication and social confidence within a variety of REAL WORLD settings, the child suffering in silence will develop necessary coping skills to enable for proper social, emotional, developmental, and academic functioning.\n\nBehavioral Therapy: Positive Reinforcement and Desensitization techniques are the primary behavior treatments for Selective Mutism, as well as removing all pressure to speak. Emphasis should be on understanding the child and acknowledging their anxiety. Introducing the child to social environments in subtle and non-threatening ways is an excellent way to help the child feel more comfortable, i.e., Parents can take the child into school when few people are around to get the child to practice speaking. Eventually, bring a friend or two to school and allow the children to play when other children are not present. Small groups with only a small number of children are helpful, as well as allowing parents to spend time with the child within the class. After the child is speaking quite normally, the teacher, and then the students are gradually introduced into the group setting. Positive reinforcement for verbalization should be introduced when, and only when, anxiety is lowered and the child feels comfortable and is obviously ready for some subtle encouragement.\n\nPlay Therapy, Psychotherapy, and other psychological approaches: These can be effective if all pressure for verbalization is removed and emphasis is on helping the child relax and open up. Confronting mutism in a non-threatening way is important. These children are SCARED, and the focus should be to help them identify their level of being scared’ in a particular situation. Helping them to realize that you understand and are there to help them relieves tremendous pressure.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy: CBT trained therapists help children modify their behavior by helping them redirect their fears and worries into positive thoughts. CBT needs to incorporate awareness and acknowledgement of anxiety and mutism. Most children with Selective Mutism worry about others hearing their voice, asking them questions about why they do not talk and trying to force them to speak. The focus should be on emphasizing the childs positive attributes, building confidence in social settings, and lowering overall anxiety and worries.\n\nMedication: Studies indicate that the most effective approach to treatment is a combination of behavioral techniques and medication. Often behavioral techniques are used for an indeterminate amount of time prior to the addition of medication. If children are not making enough progress with behavioral therapy alone, medication may be recommended to reduce the anxiety level. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac, Paxil, Celexa, Luvox, and Zoloft are very effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Similar to the SSRIs, there are other drugs that affect one or more neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and dopamine, etc. which are also proving to be affective. Examples are Effexor XR and Buspar. Both classes of drugs work well in children who have a true biochemical imbalance. This seems to be the case in the majority of children with Selective Mutism. Very often, we have seen positive effects in as little as a week! Medication is used as a jump start with the hope that, as we lower anxiety via medication, we can implement behavioral techniques more easily and successfully! Goals for the duration of treatment with medication are usually 9-12 months.\n\nSelf-esteem boosters: Parents should emphasize their childs positive attributes. For example, if your child is artistic, then by all means show off the artwork! Have a special wall to display your childs masterpieces; perhaps you can even have a special exhibition! Have them explain their artwork to family members and close friends. This promotes more verbalization practice, as well as helps with confidence!\n\nFrequent socialization: Encourage as much socialization as possible without pushing your child. Arrange frequent play dates with classmates or even small group interactions with individuals the child knows well. The goals is for your child to feel comfortable enough with the classmates so that verbalization will occur. Most children with Selective Mutism will talk to friends in their own home. As the child gets increasingly comfortable speaking to one child, invite another child over, and then have two or three children at a time! Transfer speaking into the school via set tactics/techniques. For some children, Social Skills therapy is necessary and often helpful in accomplishing increased communication.\n\nSchool involvement: Parents need to educate teachers and school personnel about Selective Mutism! You must be an advocate for your child. The school needs to understand that children with Selective Mutism are not being defiant or stubborn by not speaking, that they truly CANNOT speak. Explain to the teacher that a child needs to feel that it is alright for them not to speak. Nonverbal communication is acceptable in the beginning. As the child progresses with treatment, the teacher should be involved in the treatment plan with verbalization being encouraged in subtle, non-threatening ways. An Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) or 504 Plan may be necessary to help accommodate your childs inability to communicate verbally and to help the child progress communicatively as well as build social comfort.\n\nFamily involvement and parental acceptance: Family members must be involved in the entire treatment process! Very often changes in parenting styles and expectations are necessary to accommodate the needs of the child. Remember, never pressure or force your child to speak this will only cause more anxiety. Convey to your child that you are there for them. Spend one on one time, especially at night, when all pressure is off and engage your child in discussions about their feelings. Allowing your child to open up helps relieve stress. A parents acceptance and understanding is crucial for the child!\n\nIt is important to realize that with proper diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis for overcoming Selective Mutism is excellent!\n\nAuthor: Dr. Elisa Shipon-Blum is President and Director of the Selective Mutism, Anxiety, & Related Disorders Treatment Center (SMart Center).
