        "text": "Whether traveling to camp or school or heading off to visit family, sometimes allowing your child to fly alone just can’t be avoided. When a child flies without the presence of a legal guardian, they are referred to as an “Unaccompanied Minor” and require special supervision – which also provides peace of mind for parents. Each airline has its own rules in regards to Unaccompanied Minors, including age requirements, cost, flight limitations and amenities included, so it’s important to look into the rules of the airline you plan on booking with.\n\nWhile parents may be nervous to allow their children to fly alone, flying as an Unaccompanied Minor provides extra care through the whole process. Prep for your child’s solo flight with our tips, and consult our guide to the policies of the major carriers below. When you’re ready to book, head over to Cheapflights.com, where you can search and compare your flight options.\n\nSearch for flights\n\nAirline Policies for Unaccompanied Minors\n\nAir Canada\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nBritish Airways\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nFrontier Airlines\n\nHawaiian Airlines\n\nIcelandair\n\nJetBlue\n\nNorwegian Air\n\nPorter Airlines\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\nSpirit Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nVirgin America\n\nWestJet\n\nWow Air\n\nWhat to pack\n\nCell phone: If your child doesn’t have a cell phone, it’s a good idea to get him or her a pay-as-you-go phone – an easy form of communication for emergencies. Pay-as-you-go phones can be purchased from any cell phone retailer.\n\nGift cards: Invest in a few pre-paid gift cards worth $25 or $50, which will let your child purchase food or any unexpected expenses along the way. This will eliminate the worry of travelling with a large amount of cash.\n\nFamily/friends contact information: Give your child a complete list of names, numbers and addresses of the people who are picking him or her up at the airport.\n\nPhotographs: Provide a picture of the person(s) your child will be meeting at the airport, and write out the person’s complete contact information on the back of the photo.\n\nCopy of passport and other ID: It’s always a good idea to pack a photocopy of the child’s passport and other identification in his or her luggage.\n\nMedication: Make sure your child has all medications he or she needs and is comfortable taking medications on his or her own. Consult our guide to traveling with medication for more information.\n\nDetails of the day’s schedule: Make sure your child knows what to do in an emergency. For example, provide instructions on how to handle flight delays or cancellations. Let him or her know how to handle overnight accommodations if necessary. Provide at least two copies of this information and store it in two different places.\n\nSnacks: Pack some munchies and an empty water bottle for your child to fill at a water fountain past security.\n\nEntertainment: Make or buy a travel pack to keep him or her entertained during the flight. Include items like (depending on age) coloring books, crayons, books, a tablet stocked with TV shows and games, handheld video games and a favorite toy.\n\nBefore the flight\n\nBe in-the-know: Contact your preferred carrier in advance of making a reservation for specific information and guidelines regarding children traveling alone.\n\nTry to book a morning flight: That way, if for some reason the flight is delayed or canceled, you have the rest of the day to make alternate plans.\n\nWrite out the details: Anyone younger than 17 flying alone on an international flight must have a signed note from a parent or guardian giving permission, destination and length of stay.\n\nProvide the right info: Parents must provide information regarding who will be dropping off and picking up their child from each airport. Children are escorted off the aircraft by a flight attendant and released to the designee or another designated employee.\n\nGo over the itinerary: Familiarize your child with his or her itinerary and make sure all travel documents are kept in a safe place – especially if they’ll be needed for a return flight.\n\nMake smart clothing choices: Make sure your child doesn’t wear any clothing that has his or her name on it, which would make it easier for an impersonator to convince a child they can be trusted.\n\nChoose the right luggage: Choose luggage that’s easy for your child to carry and recognize to minimize airport stress.\n\nAt the airport\n\nArrive early: Unaccompanied Minors are usually pre-boarded, so airlines recommend allowing plenty of time to check in and get through security. A relaxed pace will also be less stressful for kids traveling solo.\n\nInform the flight attendants: Make sure the flight attendants know your child is traveling alone. Confirm that he or she will be seated in an area of the aircraft that’s convenient for attendants to keep an eye out – the very front or very back of the aircraft is ideal.\n\nGet confirmation (if you can): If possible, have your child contact you once they land and then once again when they’re with the person who is picking them up.\n\nAirline Policies for Unaccompanied Minors\n\nAir Canada\n\nAge: 8 to 11 years old – must purchase Unaccompanied Minors (UM) service; 12 to 17 years old – UM service optional; Children under 8 cannot travel alone.\n\nCost: $100 per child each way.\n\nFlight restrictions: Available on non-stop flights only.\n\nHow to book: Contact Air Canada reservations.\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAge: 5 to 7 years old – non-stop flights only; 8 to 12 years old – Non-stop and connecting flights; Children under 5 cannot travel alone.\n\nCost: $25 each way, per child (non-stop flights); US $50 each way, per child (Connecting flights).\n\nFlight restrictions: Travel may not begin between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.\n\nHow to book: Book online or by phone.\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nAge: 5 to 7 years old – non-stop or direct flights only; 8 to 14 years old – Can travel on any non-stop or direct flight, or any connecting flight through Charlotte, NC (CLT), Washington Reagan, D.C.
