You can also restrict explicit content, purchases and downloads, and changes to privacy settings.\n\nApple's parental controls are important tools that allow parents to choose how — and how often — their children can use their devices. Parental controls are built right into each iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\nTurn on Content & Privacy Restrictions\n\nWhen you set up Screen Time on your child's device, you can set age-related restrictions for content, purchases and downloads, and privacy settings.

If asked, enter your Screen Time passcode, then turn on Content & Privacy Restrictions.\n\nIf you turn off Content & Privacy Restrictions, any parental controls that you turned on are paused until you turn on Content & Privacy Restrictions again.\n\nTurn on parental controls for your child's device\n\nAfter you turn on Content & Privacy Restrictions, you can set up specific parental controls.\n\nTo make sure that your parental control settings sync across the devices in your Family Group, update all of those devices to the latest software version before turning on parental controls or changing your parental controls settings.\n\nPrevent App Store purchases\n\nAllow built-in apps and features\n\nPrevent explicit content and content ratings\n\nPrevent web content\n\nRestrict Siri web search\n\nRestrict Game Center\n\nAllow changes to privacy settings\n\nAllow changes to other settings and features\n\nMake changes to health and safety features\n\nPrevent App Store purchases\n\nYou can prevent your child from being able to install or delete apps, make in-app purchases in apps installed from the App Store, and more.\n\nGo to Settings, then tap Screen Time.\n\nTap Content & Privacy Restrictions.
