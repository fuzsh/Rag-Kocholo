        "text": "Diarrhea in Children: Common Causes and Treatments\n\nDiarrhea is the body's way of ridding itself of germs, and most episodes last a few days to a week. Diarrhea can occurÂ with fever, nausea, vomiting, cramps, dehydration, and even rashes. Some of the most common reasons kids get diarrhea include:\n\nInfection from viruses like rotavirus, bacteria like salmonella and, rarely, parasites like giardia. Viruses are the most common cause of a child's diarrhea. Along with loose or watery stools, symptoms of a viral gastroenteritis infection often include vomiting, stomachache, headache, and fever.\n\nWhen treating viral gastroenteritis -- which can last 5-14 days -- it's important to prevent fluid loss. Offer additional breast milk or an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to infants and young children. Water alone doesn't have enough sodium, potassium, and other nutrients to safely rehydrate very young children. Be sure to talk to your doctor about the amount of fluids your child needs, how to make sure they get them, when to give them, and how to watch for dehydration.\n\nOlder children with diarrhea can drink anything they like to stay hydrated, including ORS and brand-name products (their names usually end in \"lyte\"). Popsicles can also be a good way to get fluids into a child who's been vomiting and needs to rehydrate slowly.\n\nBe sure to consult with a doctor if you have traveled outside of the country recently; your child may need to have their stool tested. If symptoms last longer than two weeks, also consult a doctor.\n\nMedications like laxatives or antibiotics can also lead to diarrhea in children as well as adults.\n\nFor mild diarrhea caused by medication, keep your child safely hydrated. If a course of antibiotics is causing your child's diarrhea, be sure to continue the medication and call your doctor. Your doctor may recommend reducing the dose, changing your diet, adding a probiotic or switching to a different antibiotic.\n\nStudies show that yogurt with live cultures or probiotics can help ease diarrhea caused by antibiotics. Cultures and probiotics help replenish healthy gut bacteria killed by antibiotics.\n\nFood poisoning can also cause diarrhea in kids. Symptoms usually come on quickly, may include vomiting, and tend to go away within 24 hours.\n\nTreatment for food poisoning-related diarrhea is the same as for the diarrhea caused by infection: Keep your child hydrated and call your doctor with any questions.\n\nOther causes of diarrhea include irritable bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,Â food allergies, and celiac disease. If you're not sure what's causing your child's diarrhea, give your doctor a call."
