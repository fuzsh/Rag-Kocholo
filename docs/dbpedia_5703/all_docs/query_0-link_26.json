        "text": "My Granddaughter and my Grandson's loves this. I love how the videos are separated into age groups! Also has A LOT of the stuff all my grandkids already watch. The platform is easy to maneuver through and is very easy to navigate to exactly what the grandkids ask for. I also love how the commercials are also kid friendly and not too long either. We use this daily\n\n– Abbie T.\n\nWe found the app on our tv and I fell in love then went and downloaded it on my daughter's firestick. I love the way it's set up by age groups. I often babysit a 6 month old and like that it has a spot for younger children who just need bright colors. My girls are two years apart 4 and 6 and I'm able to easily go to a section of shows appropriate for their ages with things of their intrest. Hardly any commercials. Lots of options\n\n– Tanya M.\n\nGreat app to keep your kids entertained (and learning) while out for summer break. My 6 yr old daughter loves singing along with the nursery rhymes and letter songs. Haven't even explored all the content yet but I see there are arts and crafts, science and other video's in there as well. Can't believe this app is FREE!!!\n\n– Rkaz1"
