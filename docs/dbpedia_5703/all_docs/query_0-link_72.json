        "text": "Temper tantrums usually start at around 18 months and are very common in toddlers. Hitting and biting are common, too.\n\nOne reason for this is toddlers want to express themselves, but find it difficult. They feel frustrated, and the frustration comes out as a tantrum.\n\nOnce a child can talk more, they're less likely to have tantrums. By the age of 4, tantrums are far less common.\n\nThese ideas may help you cope with tantrums when they happen.\n\nToddler tantrum tips\n\nFind out why the tantrum is happening\n\nYour child may have a tantrum because they're tired or hungry, in which case the solution could be simple.\n\nThey could be feeling frustrated or jealous, maybe of another child. They may need time, attention and love, even though they're not being very loveable.\n\nUnderstand and accept your child's anger\n\nYou probably feel angry yourself at times, but unlike your child, you can express it in other ways.\n\nFind a distraction\n\nIf you think your child is starting a tantrum, find something to distract them with straight away. This could be something you can see out of the window.\n\nFor example, you could say, \"Look! A cat\". Make yourself sound as surprised and interested as you can.\n\nWait for it to stop\n\nLosing your temper or shouting back will not end the tantrum. Ignore the looks you get from people around you and concentrate on staying calm.\n\nDo not change your mind\n\nGiving in will not help in the long term. If you've said no, do not change your mind and say yes just to end the tantrum.\n\nOtherwise, your child will start to think tantrums can get them what they want. For the same reason, it does not help to bribe them with sweets or treats.\n\nIf you're at home, try going into another room for a while. Make sure your child cannot hurt themselves first.\n\nBe prepared when you're out shopping\n\nTantrums often happen in shops. This can be embarrassing, and embarrassment makes it harder to stay calm.\n\nKeep shopping trips as short as possible. Involve your child in the shopping by talking about what you need and letting them help you.\n\nTry holding your child firmly until the tantrum passes\n\nSome parents find firmly holding their child while they're having a tantrum helpful, but it can be hard to hold a struggling child.\n\nIt usually works when your child is more upset than angry, and when you're feeling calm enough to talk to them gently and reassure them.\n\nHitting, biting, kicking and fighting\n\nMost young children occasionally bite, hit or push another child. Toddlers are curious and may not understand that biting or pulling hair hurts.\n\nThis does not mean your child will grow up to be aggressive. Here are ways to teach your child that this behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nDo not hit, bite or kick back\n\nThis could make your child think it's acceptable to do this. Instead, make it clear that what they're doing hurts and you will not allow it.\n\nTalk to them\n\nChildren often go through phases of being upset or insecure and express their feelings by being aggressive. Finding out what's worrying them is the first step to being able to help.\n\nShow them you love them, but not their behaviour\n\nChildren may be behaving badly because they need more attention. Show them you love them by praising good behaviour and giving them plenty of cuddles when they're not behaving badly.\n\nHelp them let their feelings out in another way\n\nFind a big space, such as a park, and encourage your child to run and shout.\n\nLetting your child know that you recognise their feelings will make it easier for them to express themselves without hurting anyone else.\n\nYou could try saying things like: \"I know you're feeling angry aboutâ€¦ \". As well as showing you recognise their frustration, it will help them be able to name their own feelings and think about them."
