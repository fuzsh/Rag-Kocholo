        "text": "Mild fever is generally easy to treat at home with rest, fluids and over-the-counter medications. However, sometimes fever is an indicator of a more serious infection. See below to help determine when to take your child to the doctor for a fever.\n\nTypically, it is best to call your doctor first before heading to the ER. However, if your pediatrician is unavailable, here are some general guidelines for when to go to the ER.\n\nNewborns and infants younger than 3 months old\n\nIf your baby is less than 3 months old, visit the pediatric ER if his or her temperature is above 100.4 degrees. You should also seek emergency care if your baby’s fever is accompanied by these symptoms:\n\nDifficulty waking up to be fed\n\nDifficulty breathing\n\nRash\n\nVomiting\n\nInconsolable or non-stop crying\n\nBabies and toddlers 3 months to 3 years\n\nFor babies and toddlers between the age of 3 months and 3 years, visit the pediatric ER if the child’s temperature is above 102.2 degrees, or if the child is displaying these symptoms:\n\nDifficulty waking up\n\nNot urinating\n\nUnable to keep fluids down\n\nInconsolable\n\nNot up to date on immunizations\n\nDifficulty breathing\n\nRash\n\nChildren age 3 and older\n\nIf your child is 3 or older, visit the pediatric ER if the child’s temperature is over 102 degrees for two or more days. You should also seek emergency care if the fever is accompanied by any of these symptoms:\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nDifficulty breathing or swallowing\n\nUnable to keep fluids down\n\nBurning during urination or does not urinate\n\nRash\n\nStiff neck\n\nDifficulty waking up\n\nNot up to date on immunizations\n\nHealthONE has six pediatric emergency departments in the Denver metro area, so you are certain to find an ER that is close to home and able to quickly treat your child. Our hospitals strive to beat the national average wait time, so you can get quick access to high-quality emergency medical care."
