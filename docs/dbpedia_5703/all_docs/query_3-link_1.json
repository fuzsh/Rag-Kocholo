        "text": "What Is a Temper Tantrum?\n\nA temper tantrum is your child's way of expressing their frustration with their limits or anger about not getting their way. During a temper tantrum, they may argue, be unwilling to do what they're told to do, and go against authority.Â\n\nChildren younger than 4 regularly have up to nine tantrumsÂ a week. While it can be shocking to see your child become so angry, it'sÂ developmentally appropriate in toddlers. Angry outbursts are how they express the frustration they are having as a result of their rapid growth. They want to do things for themselves but don't have the skills and abilities to do so.Â Thankfully, your toddler's anger should start to fade as they develop the communication skills to express themselves better.Â\n\nMost kids will argue or be stubborn every now and then, but when anger and hostility happen often â leading to other problems with friends, at school, or at home â there may be cause for concern.\n\nWhile parents and caregivers can ignore tantrums in toddlers and preschoolers, it's harder to shrug them off later in life. Aggressive older children can pose a danger to others and themselves.\n\nWhat's 'Normal'?\n\nA typical tantrum can happen when a young child is tired or frustrated, or during daily routines like bedtime, mealtime, or getting dressed.\n\nWhat's not typical is when the outburst comes out of nowhere or is so intense that the child becomes exhausted. When it becomes regular, that should be a red flag.\n\nSome of the things that can be cause for concern are:\n\nAnger or unkindness toward people, objects, or both. It's possible for a child to want to hit or kick a caregiver out of frustration once in a while. But when it happens in more than half of the child's tantrums, there could be a problem.\n\nYour child tries to injure themselves. They might try to do somethingÂ like:\n\nBite themselves\n\nScratchÂ themselves\n\nBangÂ their head against the wall\n\nTry to hurt theirÂ foot by kicking, hitting, or punching something\n\nYour child can't calm down. In other words, you have to remove them from the environment or promise them something after nearly every tantrum to settle your child down and stop the tantrum.\n\nMany tantrums. From ages 1 to 4, your child can average one tantrum a day. If they happen more often, that can be cause for concern.\n\nVery long outbursts. If the tantrums usually last more than 15 minutes, that could signal another issue.\n\nCauses of Temper Tantrums\n\nÂ Some typical triggers for tantrums include:Â\n\nBeing unable to complete a task\n\nNot having the words to express their feelings\n\nBeing ill\n\nTransitions\n\nBeing tired, hungry, or frustrated\n\nWanting attention or a preferred object (toy)\n\nA child might also lash out regularly because of:\n\nADHD\n\nAnxiety\n\nA learning disability\n\nSensory processing issues\n\nAutism\n\nDisruptive behavior disorder, which can include a pattern of actions that interrupt daily life, could be another possible cause. This condition is more than a tantrum and can include:\n\nFighting\n\nCruelty\n\nArguing\n\nNot listening to authority\n\nTwo of the most common disruptive behavior disorders are oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD).\n\nChildren with ODD may show signs of being spiteful, mean, or cruel to others. They're angry a lot and spend a lot of time arguing or not following directions. They may be more likely to have anxiety or depression as they get older.\n\nChildren with CD may grow up to have problems in daily life with friends or at home. Their ongoing disruptive or violent actions may include bullying, using weapons, destroying property, stealing, and lying.\n\nIf you're concerned about your child's behavior, talk with your pediatrician. They may refer you to a psychiatrist or a psychologist, if needed. Early treatment can help and can focus on goals like teaching your child to deal with anger and frustration in ways that are more common.\n\nPreventing Temper Tantrums\n\nStay positive. Children need positive relationships to feel connected and learn toÂ control their behavior. When you're dealing with an angry toddler, it can be hard to stay calm.Â\n\nKids with behavior challenges can get caught in a difficult cycle. Their behaviorÂ frustrates their caregiver, who gets angry with them, which causes more anger. It can feel like you're always punishing your child.Â\n\nAs long as they aren't being destructive, try to focus on the positive â even if it means overlooking some tantrums.Â\n\nMake a plan. You can't prevent every tantrum, but if you think ahead, you can reduce how many your child may have. Here are some tips to help:Â\n\nPlan ahead. Don't run errands when your child is going to be hungry and tired. Pack snacks and toys to keep your toddler busy.\n\nBe consistent. Stick to a routine that includes consistent times for meals, naps, and bedtimes. Your child will do better if they know what to expect. They will also handle frustration better if they are getting enough rest.Â\n\nOffer choices. Whenever possible, let your child make decisions. Children feel more in control if they can decide what toys to play with or what outfit to wear.Â\n\nIdentify triggers. Avoid situations that are likely to cause your child to have a meltdown. Don't give your child toys that will frustrate them. Avoid sit-down restaurants if your child can't tolerate waiting.Â\n\nReward good behavior. Catch your child being good. If your child behaves at dinner, point it out and compliment them. Help your child set an appropriate behavior goal and give them a reward for reaching it. Instead of a material reward, give your child special time with a parent or let them pick the movie for movie night.\n\nHow to Stop Tantrums\n\nWhen your toddler does have a tantrum, they will need your help to calm down. You can help your child if you:\n\nStay calm. Shouting or responding angrily to your child will just make the situation worse.Â\n\nTry distraction. Give your child a toy or book. Offer to help if the tantrum is about cleaning up or doing a chore.Â\n\nGently hold them. If your child is hitting, kicking, or trying to run away, hold them until they calm down.Â\n\nExplain the rules. When your child calms down, talk about the rules with them.Â\n\nIgnore the behavior. When you ignore the tantrum, this tells your child that the behavior is not acceptable. While doing this, keep them in sight and away from objects that could harm them or others.\n\nWhen to Seek Help\n\nAside from normal developmental stages, there are medical issues that can cause anger in children. Some of these include:Â\n\nFrustration in children with cognitive or communication conditions such asÂ autism\n\nPsychosis such asÂ schizophrenia\n\nMood disorders likeÂ bipolar disorder\n\nImpulsivity, which often happens withÂ attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\nTrauma caused by outside circumstances\n\nFrontal lobe damage that can happen with injuries orÂ epilepsy\n\nIf your child's anger doesn't seem to be related to a developmental stage and lasts longer than a few weeks, you should talk to your pediatrician. You should also talk to a doctor if you feel like you can't handle your child's anger on your own. Some other signs that your child may need help include:Â\n\nCausing injury to themselves or others, including bruises and bite marks\n\nAttacking you or other adults\n\nBeing sent home from school\n\nBeing concerned about the safety of people around your child\n\nThe biggest warning sign is the how often outbursts happen. It's possible for children with issues such asÂ conduct disorder to go several days or a week without outbursts. But they can rarely go a month without problems. Treatments can help reward good behavior and discourage bad behavior in children with medical issues."
