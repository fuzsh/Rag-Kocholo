Thank you\n\nDate of experience : 09 August 2024\n\n5th birthday party\n\nLee was amazing from the moment he arrived and met my daughter who's 5th birthday it was.

From meeting him in the car park, to the part where everyone arrived. He just made the atmosphere one worth while for the kids. There was a lot of mind blown little minds from the magic show and sweaty faces from the dancing. I would 100% recommend Nemed in the future and will definitely have you guys again. All the parents have mentioned how much fun their kiddies had. From start to finish the communication was impeccable.\n\nThank you for a smooth party process from a mum and thank you for making a little boys day the 'best he ever had'\n\nDate of experience : 07 July 2024\n\nBirthday party - Mark\n\nMark done an excellent job today at my daughter’s party.

He kept them all entertained the entire time and helped with singing happy birthday also.

The Magic Show was a first for Ryhall Village Fete and a huge success given the amount of positive feedback I have received about it and Mark.

The Disco was the best package ever, I will definitely recommend their service. Thank you so much for making such a memorable and enjoyable day for my little girl and her friends.\n\nDate of experience : 13 July 2024\n\nReply from Non Stop Kids Entertainment\n\nHi Stephanie,\n\nWe couldn't agree more - our Fun Filled Disco package really is awesome! We think that the way it is crammed full of high energy party games and action dances means the little ones get to have lots of fun and also burn off plenty energy at the same time :) An all round win for all.\n\nWe are really pleased that Djihon and friends had a fantastic time and we hope to be able to supply entertainment for many more of your parties going forwards.\n\nThanks\n\nKatie\n\nExcellent day and a party to remember\n\nExcellent day and a party to remember. Everyone loved it and Tanya dealt with the boisterous kids extremely well at the start. She was thoroughly entertaining and the 5-8 year olds were amazed and excited throughout. We had a power cut affecting the whole area with 10 mins to go but Tanya dealt with it well and continued professionally.\n\nDate of experience : 06 July 2024\n\nReply from Non Stop Kids Entertainment\n\nHi Kylie, thank you for your 5 star review. We're glad that the power cut didn't affect the party too much. We think Tanya is amazing too! Please let us know if you'd like us to host another party for you.\n\n1st birthday party mix kids ages\n\nThe children felt the entertainer was approachable and really didnt hesitate to take part in all party games, magic show , disco music to kids taste. However the baby was missed out with her one to one puppet show. The entertainer was polite well mannered and happy to go with the flow of the party .\n\nDate of experience : 06 July 2024"
