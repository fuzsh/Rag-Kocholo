        "text": "If you child is making strange repetitive noises, you might be wondering what could be causing this behavior. Learning more about your child’s sensory needs can be a game-changer for both of you, and a lot of difficult behaviors might suddenly start making more sense! Check out these tips from a Certified Behavior Analyst on what causes these behaviors and how you can help your child manage them.\n\nIt is not uncommon for children to begin making repetitive, even annoying mouth sounds and continue doing it, nearly non-stop. For parents, it can be not only annoying, but even disruptive and disrespectful (even if the child does not mean to be disrespectful or rude). So how can a parent know if this behavior is a nervous habit or a sign of something more that may require professional consultation?\n\nIt can be difficult to pinpoint a child’s reason for certain behaviors, especially when the behavior can be distracting and stressful for the parent. Parents have sensory needs too, and a repetitive noise can be triggering for parents who struggle with misophonia, which is a strong stress response to certain sounds. That can make it difficult to understand the situation from the child’s point of view- does this sound satisfy a need, help with self-regulation, or could it be a sign of something else going on that you as a parent should be concerned about?\n\nSo, why do children make repetitive noises? There are a few different reasons, and in most cases, you can manage the situation for a while, and it resolves itself over time. On their own, repetitive mouth noises (such as humming, grunting, whistling, repeating sounds) are very rarely a cause for concern. Some common reasons for repetitive mouth noises are:\n\nStimming\n\nBoredom and sensory play\n\nSocial connection and communication\n\nTics and compulsive behaviors\n\nStimming\n\nOne of the most common reasons for repetitive mouth noises is “stimming.” For those unfamiliar with the term, “stimming” is a term commonly used in the Autistic community to describe behaviors (such as movements or sounds) that help with sensory or emotional regulation, to express excitement and joy, or to help with focus.\n\nWhile clinicians might describe a “stim” as “stereotypical” or a symptom of a psychological disorder, most people have movements and habits that help them to stay calm or alert. If you’ve ever fidgeted, squirmed, played with your hair, rubbed your temples, or wrung your hands, then you’ve experienced some form of stimming too.\n\nRepetitive noise-making (or “vocal stimming”) isn’t an exclusively Autistic habit either; how often have you had a song “stuck” in your head, and found yourself humming it, or repeating a funny catchphrase from a movie? As an adult, you’re probably quite good at catching yourself before you belt out these “stuck” songs, or resisting the urge to imitate the interesting noise the kettle just made. However, kids aren’t as self-conscious yet, so they express these impulses at full volume.\n\nBoredom and Sensory Play\n\nAnother very common reason for repetitive mouth noises is a straightforward one: it feels interesting and it’s fun. Children naturally look for variety and stimulation, especially when there’s not much to do, and our mouths are full of muscles and nerve endings that can create really surprising effects.\n\nYour child’s noises might even be a side effect of some other mouth habit. I remember what it felt like to be a child riding home from school, clicking my teeth together as the school bus passed each street light. It was the feeling of the click, not the sound, that helped to pass the time. Your child might be practicing an interesting tongue click or noticing the feeling of air on the inside of his lower lip, just for the sake of play.\n\nSocial Connection and Communication\n\nEveryone has verbal and non-verbal ways to signal for help from one another. We don’t always say “I’d like to go home now” but we might sigh or yawn instead. Very often, these unspoken signals pass back and forth between us before we’ve realized what we are doing. In some cases, your child’s repetitive mouth noises might be one way of signaling for your attention, or sending you a cue that help is needed.\n\nIf you’re wondering whether your child’s repetitive mouth noises are part of a bid for attention or help, notice what tends to happen next. Do people respond? Do they move away from your child, or toward? Do the mouth noises increase when people respond? Do they happen when no one else is around? These are all clues that can help you to see if there is a link between your child’s mouth noises and communication with those around him.\n\nTics and Compulsive Behaviors\n\nIn a few cases, repetitive mouth noises are caused by a “‘tic.” A tic is a motor movement or sound that a person feels they must do. Tics can be repetitive or sudden. Common tics include blinking, shrugging and throat-clearing. People with tic disorders can sometimes stop or delay the urge for a while, but they feel more and more tense until they allow themselves to perform the movement or make the sound.\n\nTwitches are not the same as tics. While twitches are tiny, involuntary partial muscle movements like a little jerking movement under the eye, tics tend to involve the whole muscle or several groups of muscles. Tics and stims are different too. While both tics and stims involve unusual movements and provide a sense of relief afterwards, you will notice that they have different triggers: stims are often noticeable in predictable situations, while tics can appear very suddenly and then stop. Sometimes tics get even more noticeable when you draw attention to them.\n\nIf you are concerned that your child’s repetitive noises might be a vocal tic, rather than a stim or another voluntary type of movement, you can consult with your pediatrician. Not every tic is a cause for concern, and many children do go through periods where they tic for a while (especially in periods of stress or excitement.) Your doctor can assess your child to see if the tics are persistent and frequent enough to be considered a “tic disorder.”\n\nTics can be startling and sometimes embarrassing, but in most cases they won’t do any harm. Tic disorders tend to run in families, and are more common in people with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD.)\n\nCoping Strategies: How do I stop my child from making noises?\n\nNow that you have considered a few different possible explanations for your child’s repetitive mouth noises, what can you do? Your strategy will be different depending on why you think the noises might be happening.\n\nFor example, if you’re quite sure that the noises are a “stim”, then you can look for the situations that tend to trigger the stim. Does your child seem stressed? Anxious? Overwhelmed? If you see that the stims are associated with stressful events for your child, then helping them cope with the situation might naturally lead to a reduction in the particular noise that bothers you.\n\nSimilarly, if you see that the repetitive mouth noises tend to happen when your child is a little bored or uncomfortable, you can provide some opportunities that meet their needs while making the mouth noise less likely. For example, you can provide sensory stimulation that keeps your child’s mouth busy with:\n\nSugar-free chewing gum\n\nCrunchy or frozen snacks\n\nBubble-blowing detergent\n\nA thick smoothie and a straw\n\nChewable jewelry or mouth fidgets\n\nIf you notice that your child’s noises might be signaling a need for social connection, then you can casually start up a conversation, invite your child to sing with you, or initiate a preferred activity, instead of going through your usual “please stop doing that” interaction.\n\nSimilarly, if you notice that your child often makes noises when they need time on their own (e.g., you’ve seen that people tend to leave the room when the noise starts up, and the noise winds down soon afterwards), you can offer your child some other suggestions for requesting what they need. One possible script could be: “Sometimes when I hear that sound, I wonder if you need some time on your own. Don’t worry, it’s not rude to ask for space. It’s okay to say: can I have some quiet time? You can also say: I need a break. Want to try it?”\n\nWhat do you do when your child’s repetitive noises are intensely annoying to YOU?\n\nOnce you’ve taken some time to get curious about your child’s mouth noises, you might feel less personally offended by them. If your child is simply playing or joyfully stimming, you don’t want to suppress that, but still, some noises are just naturally hard to listen to! If the sounds really getting on your nerves and you’re distracted or grossed out, you need a way to cope somehow too. It’s okay to ask for a break, and if you are wondering how to say it kindly, you could try: “I think I need some quiet, and I keep noticing those mouth noises. How about we hang out in different rooms for a while? Want me to help you set up your toys in your room?”\n\nSome coping options include:\n\nPut on some noise-cancelling headphones\n\nPop in some noise-reducing earplugs (e.g., Loop)\n\nTurn on the white noise (e.g., using a fan, an app or even Youtube)\n\nTake some time outdoors, either together or alone\n\nPlay some music (if you have an instrument to play, even better!)\n\nExcuse yourself to the bathroom (you can take a quick break, or block out all sound with a shower for a while)\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you’ve noticed that your child makes mouth noises as a way to cope in different situations, you can try to manage those moments with your child, or offer alternative strategies to help with emotional or sensory self-regulation . If you need extra help, reach out to an occupational therapist; they are great for finding creative ways to meet sensory needs.\n\nIf you are worried that a repetitive noise might be a tic or a compulsion, go ahead and check in with your doctor. Together, you can assess whether it is in fact a tic, and if there are any indications that your child may have an associated disorder such as ADHD, Tourette’s Syndrome or OCD. The most important factor to consider is whether this noise-making is bothering your child, or affecting his life in a negative way. Many tics are temporary, but if you keep track of how long this has been going on, and what the triggers are, your doctor will be better able to help you.\n\nIn the meantime, your sensory needs are important too, and it’s okay to use tools that manage your noise sensitivity. You might find that noise-cancelling headphones or noise-filtering earplugs help you in all kinds of situations.\n\nFinally, remember that you are not alone! Many parents struggle with these behaviors and just want to make sure their child is happy and their needs are properly taken care of.\n\nSource\n\nNext Post >>"
