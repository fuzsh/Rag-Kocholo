        "text": "Who gets gelastic seizures with hypothalamic hamartoma?\n\nThis is very rare and affects around 1 in every 200,000 children and young people. It usually starts in the first year of a child’s life, although in some cases it can begin in early to mid-childhood.\n\nThe condition is caused by a small (non-cancerous) growth, called a hamartoma, in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a small but important area of the brain that controls many basic life functions using our senses. The word ‘gelastic’ comes from ‘gelos’ – which is the Greek word for laughter.\n\nGelastic seizures can sometimes happen in other types of epilepsy. This includes epilepsy that comes from the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain. This information is specifically about the syndrome gelastic seizures that occur in hypothalamic hamartomas.\n\nThe hamartoma (growth) that causes this condition is something that your baby is born with. There isn’t usually any known reason why this should develop in your baby. This condition does not run in families. However, around 1 in 20 children who develop gelastic seizures with hypothalamic hamartoma have a genetic condition called Pallister Hall syndrome. This is an extremely rare condition and can be diagnosed with a genetic blood test.\n\nSymptoms\n\nChildren with this syndrome get a type of focal seizure called gelastic seizures. A focal seizure means it starts in just one area of the brain. Your child may have several of these seizures a day, and they often come in clusters.\n\nThe main feature of gelastic seizures are episodes of uncontrollable laughing. The laugh is not caused by your child being happy or joyful. The laughter sounds different to your child’s usual laughter. It is often described as being hollow or mechanical and not linked to any happiness or joy. Sometimes the laughter may sound normal, but it’s out of place or at an inappropriate time. The episode usually lasts less than 30 seconds and stops suddenly.\n\nSome children get other symptoms during a gelastic seizure that are more typical of focal seizures. These can include:\n\nLooking flushed\n\nIncreased heart and breathing rate\n\nEyes and head moving to one or the other side\n\nSmall, repetitive movements, such as lip-smacking, mumbling or fidgeting with their hands. These are sometimes called ‘automatisms’\n\nSome children may also have seizures that cause crying, sobbing, frowning or yelling that is out of place. These are called dacrystic seizures. Older children sometimes get a feeling or ‘aura’ that they’re about to have a seizure before it starts.\n\nAs your child gets older, they may start to get other symptoms and other types of seizures too. These can include:\n\nImpaired awareness focal seizures\n\nTonic-clonic seizures\n\nAtonic seizures\n\nAtypical absences\n\nIf your child has a hypothalamic hamartoma, they may also have precocious puberty. This means they start puberty much earlier than normal – before the age of 8 in girls and 9 in boys.\n\nOver time, children with this syndrome often start to develop learning difficulties and delays in their development. Behavioural problems are also common, and these can get worse over time. Behaviour problems can include aggression and mood swings.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nIt can be hard to recognise gelastic seizures in babies and young children. The episodes of laughter can be mistaken for normal laughter, or confused with other problems, including behavioural or emotional disorders. This may cause a delay in the diagnosis.\n\nYour child should see a specialist doctor called a paediatrician if they’re being assessed for epilepsy. It will be helpful if you can show the specialist a video of your child’s laughing episodes.\n\nThe paediatrician will suggest some tests to confirm a diagnosis. This will include an EEG (electroencephalogram), which records the electrical activity in the brain. The EEG is usually normal for children with gelastic seizures. But if they develop other types of seizures later on, it might show these. Gelastic seizures with hypothalamic hamartoma can only really be diagnosed with an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan. This should show up the growth (hamartoma) in the affected area of your child’s brain. The paediatrician will also refer your child to a specialist, called a paediatric neurologist.\n\nTreatment\n\nIf your child has early puberty, your paediatrician will be able to prescribe medicines to lower their hormone levels to pause or delay puberty.\n\nYour child’s doctor may offer epilepsy medicines to try to stop their seizures. However, although one or most medicines may work for a time, it is unlikely that they will stop all the seizures. This is because gelastic seizures are hard to control.\n\nSurgery is the most likely treatment that will control the seizures. The surgery removes the hamartoma. If surgery is successful, it may completely control your child’s seizures, and also stop any learning and behaviour problems. If you’re considering surgery, your child will need to be referred by the paediatrician or paediatric neurologist to a specialist centre through the Children’s Epilepsy Surgery Service (CESS)."
