        "text": "What is bullying?\n\nBullying is when people deliberately use words or actions repeatedly against an individual or a group to cause physical, social and/or psychological harm. They usually want to make the person feel less powerful or helpless.\n\nBullying can happen anywhere — at school, at work, at home, online, or by text messaging or email. Bullying can come in different forms, all of which cause distress and pain for the person who is being bullied.\n\nDifferent types of bullying\n\nThere are many different types of bullying:\n\nThe different types of bullying\n\nBullying behaviour at work that is physically, mentally or socially threatening can include intimidation, threats, exclusion, verbal or physical abuse. For more information or if you are being bullied at work, check the Fair Work Ombudsman’s Bullying in the workplace website.\n\nBullying is not the same as harassment. Harassment includes any unwelcome behaviour that offends, humiliates or intimidates a person. While harassment can be an element of bullying, harassment can be a one-off conflict or can happen between strangers. If these behaviours happen only once it is not bullying. Behaviour that involves conflict between equals, no matter how inappropriate, is also not considered bullying. The behaviours alone don't define bullying.\n\nWhy do people bully?\n\nThere are different reasons why people bully, including:\n\nwanting to dominate others and improve their social status\n\nhaving low self-esteem and wanting to feel better about themselves\n\nhaving a lack of remorse or failing to recognise their behaviour as a problem\n\nfeeling angry, frustrated or jealous\n\nstruggling socially\n\nbeing the victim of bullying themselves\n\nSome children who bully may enjoy getting their own way. Others may like conflict and aggression. Some may be thoughtless, rather than deliberately hurtful. Some may have difficulties with health, schoolwork and self-esteem. Some may be emotionally neglected, bullied, abused or be experiencing violence themselves.\n\nBullies are more likely to have lifelong issues such as depression or problems with aggression.\n\nChildren can take on different roles in different circumstances. Those who are bullied in one situation may be the bully in another.\n\nWhat are the signs of bullying?\n\nBullying affects people in different ways, but some common signs of bullying include:\n\nbeing unusually secretive and quiet\n\nappearing oversensitive or weepy, or having angry outbursts\n\nnot sleeping properly\n\nhaving physical injuries like bruises, cuts or scratches\n\nbecoming isolated, withdrawn, or losing interest in normal activities\n\nhaving physical aches and pains like headaches or stomach aches\n\nreceiving more messages than usual via social media\n\nWhat are the signs my child is being bullied?\n\nSigns your child is possibly being bullied include any of the above, as well as:\n\nnot wanting to go to school or having no friends\n\nhaving damaged or missing belongings\n\na child who has been toilet trained starts to wet their bed again\n\nhaving physical aches and pains like headaches or stomach aches\n\nreceiving more messages than usual via social media\n\nBullying can happen to anyone at any age. Very few children tell anyone that they’re being bullied. They may feel weak, ashamed or frightened it will make the situation worse.\n\nHow might bullying affect me or my child?\n\nBullying affects everyone differently, but if you’re being bullied you may feel:\n\nguilty because you think it’s your fault\n\nhopeless because you don’t know how to get out of the situation\n\nalone, with no one to help you\n\ndepressed and rejected by others\n\nunsafe and afraid\n\nconfused and stressed\n\nashamed that it’s happening to you\n\nBullying can affect your mental health whatever your age. It can lead to loneliness, anxiety and depression in children. People who are bullied in the workplace have a higher risk of experiencing depression and having suicidal thoughts.\n\nRemember, you have a right to feel safe and be treated with fairness and respect. Find out more about your rights on the Australian Human Rights Commission website.\n\nHow can bullying be stopped?\n\nIf bullying is not challenged and stopped, it can contribute to a culture where bullying is tolerated. If this occurs, everyone feels powerless to stop it.\n\nIf you are the person being bullied, you may need to use a few different strategies, such as:\n\ntalking to a person you trust\n\ntaking to someone you trust with you when you seek help or talk to the bully\n\nseeking help from an agency or support service, such as those listed below\n\nIf you feel safe and confident, you can approach the bully about why their behaviour is not OK.\n\nWe have a responsibility to respect and protect the rights of others. A bystander is someone who sees or knows about bullying that is happening to someone else. Find out more about your rights as a bystander on the Australian Human Rights Commission website.\n\nIf your child is being bullied:\n\nhelp your child stay focused on finding a solution\n\nassure your child it’s not their fault\n\ntalk to your child about different ways to relate to the bully and practise with them through role play\n\nlet your child know you will contact their school\n\nIf bullying is violent or threatening, call triple zero (000) and ask for the police.\n\nYour employer has a legal responsibility to provide a safe workplace, and a duty of care when it comes to your health and wellbeing at work. You can read more about workplace bullying on the healthdirect Workplace bullying page, or the Fair Work Commission’s website.\n\nResources and support\n\nIf you have been bullied, or you have seen others being bullied, help is available:\n\nThe Bully Project is for victims of bullying or parents of children being bullied.\n\nBullying No Way! is a web resource for young people.\n\nOffice of the eSafety Commissioner helps victims of cyberbullying\n\nKids Help Line (1800 551 800) is a free and confidential telephone counselling service for 5 to 25 year olds in Australia.\n\nLifeline (13 11 14) is a free and confidential service staffed by trained telephone counsellors.\n\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission (1300 656 419) has a complaint handling service. It may investigate complaints of discrimination, harassment and bullying.\n\nOther languages\n\nDo you prefer languages other than English?
