Generally speaking, kids should stop napping when they no longer need a nap to feel energized for a full day. Many children will stop napping naturally. There are several signs that indicate a child is ready to stop taking naps:\n\nThey have difficulty falling asleep at nap time. Children who are no longer tired during the day â€” and who have a consistent mood during days without naps â€” may struggle to fall asleep when it is nap time. For instance, children may play or sing while laying in bed, or may simply not fall asleep. If a child is fussy during this time, it may indicate they still need to nap, but the timing of when the nap occurs may need to be adjusted.\n\nThey have difficulty falling asleep at night time. Napping during the day can delay your childâ€™s ability to fall asleep Trusted Source National Center for Biotechnology Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source , leaving them with less sleep overall. The length of nap time can be reduced to help children become sleepy by bedtime. Avoid pushing your childâ€™s bedtime later. Instead, monitor when the child is sleepy and put them down for bed at that time. In general, it is more advisable to shorten naps than push bedtimes later.\n\nThey are waking up early. Daytime napping when it is no longer needed may cause your child to be fully rested well before their morning wake-up time. If your child still needs to nap but is waking early, try shortening their naps rather than eliminating the nap entirely.\n\nThey donâ€™t show signs of sleepiness on days without naps. If your child is not yawning or struggling to stay awake during the daytime, and she is not becoming cranky in the evening, she may be ready to stop taking naps.\n\nThey are no longer napping at all. During their scheduled nap time, they may continue to play or read without signs of sleepiness.\n\nWhen Do Kids Still Need Naps?\n\nInfants until one year of age will take naps 1â€“4 times per day. As the brain matures, fewer and fewer naps are required Trusted Source National Center for Biotechnology Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . By 18-24 months, children need only one nap each day. Children who take early afternoon naps for a set duration of fewer than 60 minutes Trusted Source National Center for Biotechnology Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source have been observed sleeping well at night. However, naps should not be shortened if the child is sleeping well at bedtime.\n\nThere are a few clear signs that your child is not ready to stop napping. Kids whose behaviors shift negatively in the eveningsâ€”such as becoming more irritable or overtiredâ€”are probably not ready to stop napping. A lack of sleep can negatively affect their emotions Trusted Source Wiley Online Library Wiley Online Library is one of the largest and most authoritative collections of electronic journals published by Wiley, as well as a vast and growing collection of reference works and other books. View Source . If your child is struggling to stay awake during the daytime after a full night of sleep, they likely still need a daily nap. You might decrease the length of the nap to help them prepare for transitioning out of naptime habits.\n\nHow to Transition Kids Away From Naps\n\nTransitioning away from naps may take time. Rather than quitting naps altogether, replacing nap time with quiet time can allow children to choose whether theyâ€™d like to sleep or play quietly. Many daycares and preschools offer this quiet time for children.\n\nJust like nap time, quiet time should be structured in a specific location and set for a specific period of time. If they are not napping, children should have a stimulating activity so that they will sleep at night. Offer your child the choice of quiet activities such as reading, putting together a puzzle, or coloring. Whether sleeping or not, a period of rest can help with memory consolidation Trusted Source National Center for Biotechnology Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source and recharging for the rest of the day.\n\nAvoid replacing nap time with activities that induce drowsiness, such as driving or watching TV. Parents should also avoid loud activities themselves to encourage the child to play quietly. Loud noises may cause the child to leave their quiet time space.\n\nHow Sleep Changes Without Naps\n\nWhen children no longer take naps, they may need more sleep at nighttime Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . It is recommended that parents make bedtime earlier for children who are no longer napping so that they have the necessary amount of sleep. Because preschool-aged children need up to 13 hours of sleep, bedtime may need to be moved up to 6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m., depending on what time your child needs to wake up.\n\nTo encourage sleep, it is recommended parents build a regular bedtime routine for their children Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . A nighttime routine can include a snack, hygiene such as brushing teeth or taking a bath, and reading or singing lullabies.\n\nOccasional naps may still happen after children no longer have scheduled naptime. Growth spurts, changes in routine, and school may affect your childâ€™s sleepiness. The return to naps is usually not a problem so long as the nap time is structured and does not affect the childâ€™s nighttime sleep."
