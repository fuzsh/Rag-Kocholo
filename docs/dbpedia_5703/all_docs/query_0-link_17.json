That’s why we work tirelessly to provide support to families and communities in need. Watch our PSA video above to learn more about how we can prevent neglect and abuse before it happens.\n\nNow is the time to reach out to your Senator about the cricital support to families through the Child Tax Credit. In 2021, the Child Tax Credit (CTC) was expanded and made available to those with little to no income through monthly payments. Nearly all families received the expanded monthly CTC – and nearly 66 million or 90% of children in the country – benefited from the program. However, the expanded CTC expired at the beginning of 2022.\n\nIn April and throughout the year, Prevent Child Abuse America and its state chapters will continue building the narrative of hope for children and families through collaboration and the creation of an ecosystem of primary prevention. Communities must build positive futures together in partnership!\n\nAt Prevent Child Abuse America (PCA America), we recognize the pivotal role State and Federal laws and policies play in fostering healthy families and positive childhood experiences, while preventing child abuse and neglect. We advocate for evidence-informed, equitable, and family-centered policies, striving to ensure all families have the necessary resources and support. Join us in our mission to build a hopeful future for all families. See our State and Federal Policy Priorities here to learn more.\n\nA new vision for the creation of a primary prevention ecosystem that builds the wellbeing of our nation’s children and families.\n\nPrevent Child Abuse America is the nation’s oldest and largest organization committed to preventing child abuse and neglect before it happens. We promote programs and resources informed by science that enable kids, families, and entire communities to thrive—today, tomorrow, and for generations to come. ​\n\nOur success relies on a nationwide network of state chapters and nearly 600 Healthy Families America home visiting sites, which provide parents and caregivers a wide variety of services and resources in communities across the country. Our respected experts also develop innovative research that our vast network then puts into action. And we raise public awareness and engagement and advocate for family friendly policies at the national, state, and local levels to support programs that ensure children and families get what they need to succeed. ​\n\n“When parents or caregivers are struggling and they are in survival mode, we can all play a role in supporting them and creating safe, stable and nurturing environments for them and their children.”\n\n“I would hate for someone to not have the resources.” Amber’s heartfelt journey with Healthy Families America®: radiates the profound impact of investment and support, echoing the importance of accessible resources in nurturing families and building brighter futures.\n\nStay up to date on our latest activities and achievements by signing up for our e-newsletter."
