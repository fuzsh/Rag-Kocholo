        "text": "For more resources, visit the main Child Safety web page.\n\nAs of January 1, 2021, the penalties for failing to stop for a school bus and passing a stopped school bus on the side where children enter and exit doubled. It is imperative that all motorists properly stop for school buses so all of Florida’s children can arrive at school or home safely.\n\nUsing a wireless communications device in a handheld manner while driving in a designated school crossing, school zone, or active work zone area is against the law and extremely dangerous.\n\nFlorida school buses carry precious cargo – our children. Motorists should always be alert and drive with caution around school buses and in school zones where children may be present like schools, bus stops, school buses and school parking lots. Parents should also go over safety tips with their children to make sure they are safe on and around school buses and school zones.\n\nPay extra attention to the lower speed limits in school zones – and obey them!\n\nWatch for and obey signals from school crossing guards.\n\nOnly drive or park in authorized areas to drop off or pick up children at school.\n\nAt bus stops, children should wait in a safe place away from the road. Never sit on the roadway or curb while waiting for your bus.\n\nIn 2022, there were almost 3,000 crashes involving school buses. Florida school buses carry precious cargo – our children. Prevent crashes by remaining alert and driving with caution around school buses and in school zones where children may be present such as schools, bus stops, school buses and school parking lots.\n\nParents are encouraged to review safety tips with their children to make sure they are safe on and around school buses and school zones.\n\nMotorists are required to stop when approaching a school bus that is stopped with its red lights flashing and STOP arms extended. (See the different situations in the diagram below)\n\nAll drivers moving in either direction on a two-way street must stop for a school bus displaying a stop signal, and must remain stopped until the road is clear of children AND the school bus stop arm is withdrawn. (see diagram, TWO-LANE)\n\nOn a highway divided by a paved median, all drivers moving in either direction must stop for a school bus displaying a stop signal, and must remain stopped until the road is clear of children AND the school bus stop arm is withdrawn. (see diagram, MULTI-LANE)\n\nThe only time traffic approaching an oncoming school bus does not need to stop, is if there is a raised barrier such as a concrete divider or at least five feet of unpaved space separating the lanes of traffic. (see diagram, DIVIDED HIGHWAY)\n\nOn a highway divided by a raised barrier or an unpaved median at least 5 feet wide, drivers moving in the opposite direction do not have to stop for the bus (painted lines or pavement markings are not considered barriers). However, these motorists should slow down and watch for students loading or unloading from the bus. (see diagram, DIVIDED HIGHWAY)\n\nPenalties for passing stopped school bus include:\n\nMoving violation subject to citation;\n\nRequirement to complete a basic Driver Improvement Course upon conviction;\n\nFour points on your driver license; and\n\nMinimum fine of $265, if you pass on the side where children enter and exit, you will receive a minimum fine of $465.\n\nOn July 1, 2017, the Cameron Mayhew Act took effect in Florida, which increases the minimum penalty for drivers who illegally pass a stopped school bus, resulting in the injury or death of another person. Cameron Mayhew was killed by a motorist that failed to stop as he was walking to his stopped school bus in 2016.\n\nPenalties for passing a stopped school bus that causes or results in the serious bodily injury or the death of another person include:\n\nServing 120 community service hours in a trauma center or hospital;\n\nParticipating in a victim’s impact panel session, or if such a panel does not exist, attending a FLHSMV approved driver improvement course;\n\nSix points on your driver license;\n\nSuspension of license for a minimum of one year; and\n\n$1,500 fine.\n\nSchool Bus Safety Tips for Parents and Children\n\nArrive at the bus stop with about five minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive.\n\nAt bus stops, children should wait in a safe place away from the road. Never sit on the roadway or curb while waiting for your bus.\n\nMake sure your children know their bus driver’s name and bus number.\n\nTell children to never speak to strangers at the bus stop or get into the car with a stranger. Children should tell parents, the bus driver and a teacher at school if a stranger tries to talk to them or pick them up.\n\nChildren should never walk behind a bus and should stay away from bus wheels at all times. When the bus stops, children should wait for the driver’s signal that it is safe to cross the road or board the bus.\n\nChildren should look both ways before crossing the street- look left, right and left again. Tell them to make eye contact to make sure the bus driver can see them as they cross the street.\n\nOn the bus, children should remain seated at all times and keep the aisle clear. Tell children not to put their head, hands or arms out the window.\n\nRemind children to stop talking and remain silent when the bus comes to a railroad crossing so the driver can hear if a train is approaching.\n\nChildren should avoid any loud or disruptive behavior that could distract the bus driver from safely operating the bus.\n\nRefer to the official Florida Driver License Handbook for more information on school bus safety.\n\nResources"
