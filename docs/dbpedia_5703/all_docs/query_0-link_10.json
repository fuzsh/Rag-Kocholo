        "text": "1995 film by Larry Clark\n\nKidsDirected byLarry ClarkWritten byHarmony KorineProduced byCary WoodsStarringCinematographyEric EdwardsEdited byChristopher TellefsenMusic by\n\nLou Barlow\n\nJohn Davis\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nIndependent Pictures\n\nThe Guys Upstairs\n\nKiller Films\n\nShining Excalibur Films\n\nKids NY Limited\n\nDistributed byShining Excalibur Films\n\nRelease dates\n\nRunning time\n\n91 minutes[1]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$1.5 million[2]Box office$20.4 million[3]\n\nKids is a 1995 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Larry Clark in his directorial debut and written by Harmony Korine in his screenwriting debut.[4] It stars Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chloë Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson, all in their film debuts. Fitzpatrick, Pierce, Sevigny, Dawson, and other newcomers portray a group of teenagers in New York City. They are characterized as hedonists, who engage in sexual acts and substance abuse, over the course of a single day.\n\nBen Detrick of the New York Times has described the film as \"Lord of the Flies with skateboards, nitrous oxide and hip-hop... There is no thunderous moral reckoning, only observational detachment.\"[5] The film caused controversy upon its release in 1995 over its treatment of the subject matter. It received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, but was released without a rating. Critical response was mixed, and the film grossed $20.4 million on a $1.5 million budget. It is now considered a cult classic.[6]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an encounter that starts out consensually, a 17-year-old boy named Telly roughly and painfully rapes a 12-year-old girl, despite her pleas for him to stop and be more gentle. Afterward, Telly meets with his best friend, Casper, and they discuss his sexual experience. He vocalizes his desire to keep having sex with virginal girls. They then enter a local store, where Casper shoplifts a bottle of malt liquor. Looking for drugs, food, and a place to hang out, they head to their friend Paul's apartment despite disliking him. They join the other boys in boasting about their sexual prowess and nonchalant attitudes to unprotected sex and venereal diseases.\n\nAcross the city, a group of girls are talking about sex. Their attitudes contradict that of the boys on many topics, particularly fellatio and the significance of the individuals to whom they lost their virginity. Two of the girls, Ruby and Jennie, mention that they were recently tested for sexually transmitted disease: Ruby tests negative, even though she has had multiple sexual encounters, and Jennie tests positive for HIV. She tells the nurse that she has had sex only once, with Telly. Distraught, she tries to find him to prevent him from passing HIV on to another girl. Meanwhile, Telly and Casper walk to Telly's house and steal money from his mother.\n\nAfter purchasing marijuana, they gather with a few friends and, together, taunt a gay couple passing by. As Casper rides on a skateboard, he carelessly bumps into a man who angrily threatens and pushes him. The man is struck in the back of the head with a skateboard by Casper's friend Harold, causing him to collapse. Several other skaters join in, beating the man until he is rendered unconscious by a final blow to the head by Casper. Telly and some of the group then pick up a 13-year-old girl named Darcy—the virginal younger sister of an acquaintance—with whom Telly wants to have sex, but Darcy shows restraint. Afterward, the group goes to an unsupervised party at the house of their friend Steven.\n\nJennie meets Misha, a girl who dislikes Casper and notes Telly's possible whereabouts at The Shelter. When Jennie arrives at the club, she runs into a boy named Fidget, who shoves a depressant into her mouth; she then learns Telly is at Steven's house. When Jennie arrives, Darcy and Telly have already begun having sex (which turns into rape), thus exposing Darcy to HIV. Jennie cries and passes out among the other partygoers.\n\nThe morning after, a drunk Casper rapes Jennie unprotected as she sleeps, unwittingly exposing himself to HIV. After a montage shows homeless people and drug users in the waking New York City, a voiceover by Telly says that sex is the only worthwhile thing in his life. A naked Casper says, \"Jesus Christ, what happened?\", just before the credits roll.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLeo Fitzpatrick as Telly\n\nJustin Pierce as Casper\n\nChloë Sevigny as Jennie\n\nRosario Dawson as Ruby\n\nYakira Peguero as Darcy\n\nAtabey Rodriguez as Misha\n\nJon Abrahams as Steven\n\nHarold Hunter as Harold\n\nSajan Bhagat as Paul\n\nHamilton Harris as Hamilton\n\nAdditionally, Sarah Henderson portrays the first girl Telly is seen having sex with and Tony Morales and Walter Youngblood portray the gay couple. Julie Stebe-Glorius and Christina Stebe-Glorious appear as Telly's mother and younger brother, respectively. The Rastafari is played by an actor credited as \"Dr. Henry\". Screenwriter Harmony Korine has an uncredited appearance as Fidget.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nLarry Clark said that he wanted to \"make the Great American Teenage Movie, like the Great American Novel.\"[8] The film is shot in a quasi-documentary style, although all of its scenes are scripted.\n\nIn Kids, Clark cast New York City \"street\" kids with no previous acting experience, notably Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly) and Justin Pierce (Casper).[9] Clark originally decided he wanted to cast Fitzpatrick in a film after watching him skateboard in New York, and cursing when he could not land certain tricks.[11] Korine had met Chloë Sevigny in New York before production began on Kids, and initially cast her in a small role as one of the girls in the swimming pool.[12] She was given the leading role of Jennie after Mia Kirshner, the original actress cast, was deemed not the right fit to work with first-time actors.[14][8] Sevigny and Korine went on to make Gummo (1997) and Julien Donkey-Boy (1999) together. Korine makes a cameo in the club scene with Jennie, as the kid wearing Coke-bottle glasses and a Nuclear Assault shirt who gives her drugs, though the part is credited to his brother Avi.\n\nKorine reportedly wrote the film's screenplay in 1993, at the age of 18, and principal photography took place during the summer of 1994. Contrary to the perception of many viewers, the film, according to Korine, was almost entirely scripted, with the only exception being the scene with Casper on the couch at the end, which was improvised.[15] Gus Van Sant had been attached to the film as a producer.[14] After insufficient interest had been generated in the film, he left the project. Under incoming producer Cary Woods, the project found sufficient independent funding for the film.[14] Harvey Weinstein of Miramax, wary of parent The Walt Disney Company's opinion of the risky screenplay, declined to involve Disney in funding the production of the film. After Woods showed him the final cut, Miramax paid $3.5 million to buy the worldwide distribution rights of this film.[16]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nMiramax Films, which was owned by The Walt Disney Company, paid $3.5 million to buy the worldwide distribution rights.[16] Later, Harvey and Bob Weinstein (the co-chairmen of Miramax Films) were forced to buy back the film from Disney and created Shining Excalibur Films (a one-off company) to release the film, due to Disney's policy, that at the time, forbid the release of NC-17 rated films (and the fact their appeal to the MPAA to lower it to R was denied). Eamonn Bowles was hired to be the chief operating officer of Shining Excalibur Films.[17][18]\n\nThe film, which cost $1.5 million to produce, grossed $7.4 million in the North American box office[3] and $20 million worldwide.[19] According to Peter Biskind's book Down and Dirty Pictures, Eamonn Bowles had stated that Harvey and Bob Weinstein might have personally profited up to $2 million each.[20]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 47% based on 58 critic's reviews, with an average rating of 5.70/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Kids isn't afraid to test viewers' limits, but the point of its nearly non-stop provocation is likely to be lost in all the repellent characters and unpleasant imagery\".[21] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 63/100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[22]\n\nThe film was championed by some prominent critics, including Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film three and a half out of four stars. \"Kids is the kind of movie that needs to be talked about afterward. It doesn't tell us what it means. Sure, it has a 'message', involving safe sex. But safe sex is not going to civilize these kids, make them into curious, capable citizens. What you realize, thinking about Telly, is that life has given him nothing that interests him, except for sex, drugs and skateboards. His life is a kind of hell, briefly interrupted by orgasms.\"[23]\n\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times called the film a \"wake-up call to the modern world\" about the nature of present-day youth in urban life.[24] She added it is also \"an extremely difficult film to sit through, with an emphasis on societal disintegration and adolescent selfishness at its most sordid\", and that some viewers will find issue with Clark's lack of judgement on the events depicted.[24] Some critics labeled it exploitative, describing it as borderline \"child pornography\".[25] Other critics derided the film, with the most common criticism relating to the perceived lack of artistic merit. The Washington Post's Desson Thomson said, \"Ostensibly about the banality of youthful evil, 'Kids' is simply about its own banality. At best, it's a misplaced aesthetic experiment. At worst, it's glossy exploitation—with enough controversy to launch a thousand trite radio and television talk shows.\"[26]\n\nFeminist scholar bell hooks spoke extensively about the film in Cultural Criticism and Transformation: \"Kids fascinated me as a film precisely because when you heard about it, it seemed like the perfect embodiment of the kind of postmodern, notions of journeying and dislocation and fragmentation and yet when you go to see it, it has simply such a conservative take on gender, on race, on the politics of HIV.\"[27]\n\nIn a 2016 retrospective essay about the film, writer Moira Weigel discussed the film's impact at the time of its release and legacy.[28] She acknowledged that the film \"nails many of the ethnographic details of teen life in New York in the Nineties\".[28] However, she commented on the film's depiction of HIV, writing:\n\n\"Watching it today, I was hoping for an account of the ways that the fear of AIDS shaped how young people in that time and place learned about desire. Instead the film recasts the virus into the threat lurking in the background of a kind of nightmare fairy tale...Rather than exploring how it shaped, and unmade, lives, it reduces the disease to one more slick bit of style, something to add suspense where the film might otherwise risk aimlessness and to heighten the aura of transgression. While it manages to capture the sense, instilled in us by our health teachers, that disease and death would be the price of desire, it does little more than that. Instead of examining the myths that loomed over the teen minds of that era, it enlarges them\".[28]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Recipients Result Ref.

At the time of filming Kids, most of the participating teenagers signed a contract without knowledge about their rights and were left on their own after filming ended.[6] The documentary was awarded for Best Editing at the Tribeca Film Festival.[38][39]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2010, American rapper Mac Miller released the mixtape K.I.D.S., and its cover art, title, and some musical themes pay homage to the film. Some audio clips from the film are also part of the mixtape in between songs.[40]\n\nOn the film's twentieth anniversary in 2015, skateboarding brand Supreme launched a capsule collection commemorating the film.[41] Actors Justin Pierce and Harold Hunter had been involved with Supreme since its incarnation and were part of the brand's original skate team.[5]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nKids Original SoundtrackSoundtrack album by\n\nVarious artists\n\nReleased1995Genre\n\nIndie rock\n\nlo-fi[42]\n\nLength41:16LabelLondonProducer\n\nBrian Beattie\n\nRandall Poster\n\nTim O'Heir\n\nSingles from Kids Original Soundtrack\n\nReleased: November 21, 1995\n\nThe soundtrack was released in 1995.\n\nOn September 8, 2023, Folk Implosion, the band composed of Lou Barlow and John Davis, released Music For Kids, a compilation of songs from the film, many of which had never been released for streaming, and others that had since become unavailable due to licensing issues.
