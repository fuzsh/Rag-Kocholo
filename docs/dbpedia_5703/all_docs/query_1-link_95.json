        "text": "Product: The Sims 4\n\nPlatform:PC\n\nWhich language are you playing the game in? English\n\nHow often does the bug occur? Often (50% - 99%)\n\nWhat is your current game version number? 1.73.57.1030\n\nWhat expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? All of them except: Moschino, Paranormal, Spooky Stuff, Throwback Fit Kit\n\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? I raised my toddlers to a child, and now they will not stop making a mess\n\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? All of my children will not stop making messes. They will automatically make messes as soon as they have nothing to do. For example: My child is done with their homework, boom start making a mess.\n\nWhat do you expect to see? Them doing other activities, such as playing on the computer, watching television or playing with their dolls.\n\nHave you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? Not now. I've removed them.\n\nDid this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? Neutral/Not Sure\n\n‌\n\nThe children have the neat personality traits and high responsibility, but still continue to splatter their paint on the floor. Time outs and punishments do not help one bit....\n\nEdit By Crinrict: Added Tag to Title\n\nWhat @daikoyu said.\n\nI don't have Bust the Dust, but I made the mistake of creating a child Sim with the creative trait, and... yeah. To repeat myself from the \"autonomy\" thread (because it belongs here)...\n\nAs I joked to a friend:\n\nParenting -> Discipline Recent Behavior -> Over It -> Put Up For Adoption\n\nAt the same time, I worried that perhaps his relationship with his parents would be damaged because he was SO PERSISTENT in making messes that basically the only times an adult interacted with him it was either \"help with homework or school project\" or progressively stricter discipline for all those messes. Seriously:\n\nKid: makes mess\n\nParent: Parenting -> Discipline recent behavior -> calm -> ask not to make a mess\n\nKid: immediately makes more mess\n\nParent: Parenting -> Discipline recent behavior -> firm -> express disappointment for making a mess\n\nKid: immediately makes more mess\n\nParent: Parenting -> Discipline recent behavior -> strict -> give time out for making a mess\n\nKid: goes into timeout with a snit, then immediately makes more mess\n\nMe: You little (#)@*#@&#& WILL YOU STOP!\n\nParent: Parenting -> Discipline recent behavior -> punish -> ground for making a mess\n\nKid: little orange tense sliver at the end of a mass of inspired moodlets, so immediately makes more mess\n\nMe: Is there a \"put child up for adoption\" option on the computer?\n\nParent: Parenting -> Discipline recent behavior -> punish -> double ground for making a mess\n\nKid: immediately makes more mess\n\nMe: I will not delete a child. I will not delete a child. I will not delete a child. I will not....\n\nParent: Parenting -> Discipline recent behavior -> punish -> triple ground for making a mess\n\nAd nauseum. Eventually I got the bug where all options were \"stealthily,\" like \"steathily use toilet, stealthily get leftovers, stealthily do homework, and then stealthily go to bed.\" LOL, except that he hemorrhaged responsibility, argh!\n\nI've since downloaded Bienchen's mod forbidding autonomous messes.\n\nTL;DR: @daikoyu is absolutely correct that if they're inspired their default idle appears to be make a mess. It's THE WORST and needs to STOP.\n\nI can't imagine why they'd make \"make mess\" the default inspired action for children, when they seem absolutely determined to make half of the CAS objects for childrens re-colors of the exact same drawing station. Make them want to draw instead of wanting to misbehave! Where do they even get the stuff to make a mess with anyway? We never have to buy any ingredients, so why are are there so many of them around to the point children keep entire bottles of them on their person at all times...? Honestly, it breaks my immersion-- nevermind, this is becoming a rant.\n\nAs others have said, it's just tied to the clean floor inspired buff, and no matter how much you discipline your children with Parenting, they'll do it endlessly. Gotta love how impactful your Sims' actions are when they'll be disregarded not three seconds later!\n\n@Saihyou When I was 4, I scribbled all over one of my books because I had a mental image that the book would look gorgeous with intertwined scrollwork around the pages, which I didn't have the skill to execute (or the vocabulary to explain). I never did it again after:\n\nMom: Why did you do that? WHY DID YOU DO THAT????? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT???????\n\nMe: I... thought it would be... pretty?\n\nMom: *disgusted eyeroll*\n\nSo I can see a kid autonomously making a mess once because they're inspired. Maybe twice! I can't see a kid spilling paint or chocolate syrup all over the floor a million times a day while their parents greet each mess with \"You're grounded! No TV, computer, phone, friends, leaving the house, or breathing!\"\n\nIt's the PERSISTENCE of the activity that's immersion-breaking. Whyyyyyyyyyy do they do this as their default idle activity? Seriously, guys, what's up with the tuning on this activity?\n\nProduct: The Sims 4\n\nPlatform:PC\n\nWhich language are you playing the game in? English\n\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\n\nWhat is your current game version number? 1.72.28.1030\n\nWhat expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? City living, Cats and dogs, get famous, get to work, get together, seasons, snowy escape, parent hood, stranger Ville, Nifty knitting, Tiny living, Toddler stuff, Vintage glamour\n\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Play a family with children, the instance of sim children making messes is constant now compared to before\n\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? Children act out when normally they do not. My sims (all of them) now have children that constantly make messes even after being disciplined (by parents with lvl 10 parenting) and my sim children have never acted out constantly before. This is new behavior across all sim families I play with.\n\nWhat do you expect to see? A sim child being punished and the punishment having effect, as it usually does in game play and less constant messes being made.\n\nHave you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? Not now. I've removed them.\n\nDid this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? Neutral/Not Sure\n\n‌\n\nNoticed this happening May 5th around 8 pm AST"
