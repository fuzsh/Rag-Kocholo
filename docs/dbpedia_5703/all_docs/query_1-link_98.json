        "text": "Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Both kids who are bullied and who bully others may have serious, lasting problems.\n\nIn order to be considered bullying, the behavior must be aggressive and include:\n\nAn Imbalance of Power: Kids who bully use their power—such as physical strength, access to embarrassing information, or popularity—to control or harm others. Power imbalances can change over time and in different situations, even if they involve the same people.\n\nRepetition: Bullying behaviors happen more than once or have the potential to happen more than once.\n\nBullying includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose.\n\nTypes of Bullying\n\nWhere and When Bullying Happens\n\nFrequency of Bullying\n\nTypes of Bullying\n\nThere are three types of bullying:\n\nVerbal bullying is saying or writing mean things. Verbal bullying includes:\n\nTeasing\n\nName-calling\n\nInappropriate sexual comments\n\nTaunting\n\nThreatening to cause harm\n\nSocial bullying, sometimes referred to as relational bullying, involves hurting someone’s reputation or relationships. Social bullying includes:\n\nLeaving someone out on purpose\n\nTelling other children not to be friends with someone\n\nSpreading rumors about someone\n\nEmbarrassing someone in public\n\nPhysical bullying involves hurting a person’s body or possessions. Physical bullying includes:\n\nHitting/kicking/pinching\n\nSpitting\n\nTripping/pushing\n\nTaking or breaking someone’s things\n\nMaking mean or rude hand gestures\n\nWhere and When Bullying Happens\n\nBullying can occur during or after school hours. While most reported bullying happens in the school building, a significant percentage also happens in places like on the playground or the bus. It can also happen travelling to or from school, in the youth’s neighborhood, or on the Internet.\n\nFrequency of Bullying\n\nThere are two sources of federally collected data on youth bullying:\n\nThe 2019 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey (National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice) indicates that, nationwide, about 22% of students ages 12–18 experienced bullying.\n\nThe 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) indicates that, nationwide, 15.0% of students in grades 9–12 report being bullied on school property in the 12 months preceding the survey."
