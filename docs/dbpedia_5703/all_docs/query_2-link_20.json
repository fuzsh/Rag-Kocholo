        "text": "[Sign up to receive NYT Parenting in your inbox every Wednesday]\n\nA lot of parenting questions boil down to: Is this a thing, or is something wrong? We’re doing an occasional series explaining why certain things seem to happen to your kid (or to your body or to your relationships) as your child grows. This week, we’re answering a reader’s question about why her child won’t stop acting like a lion. Read our first column, about preschoolers’ questions about death, here. If you have a question for a future “Is this a thing?” newsletter, email us.\n\nQ: My 4-year-old runs around the house on all fours all. of. the. time. She thinks she’s a lion, and if you are talking about something else, doing something else or asking HER to do something else, forget it. She’s a lion and will not answer any questions asked in English. She must roar her every reply. This can be particularly exhausting when it comes to getting her to eat her breakfast (a zebra), or getting her shoes (paws) on, or getting her to school (the savanna) without an extensive round of make-believe before I’ve even had my coffee. Is this a thing?\n\n— Kelly Walsh, East Bay, Calif.\n\nA: I chose this question because I’m going through a version of it myself. Every time I try to tell my almost 3-year-old something she doesn’t want to hear, she meows at me. It’s adorable and aggravating and, honestly, I’m kind of impressed at the exquisite aggression of it. I wish I could meow at people in meetings sometimes instead of responding pleasantly to unreasonable requests.\n\nBut let’s back up. There are two separate questions lurking in this letter: Is it normal for kids to engage in extended pretend play? And how do you snap them out of it when you need them to get out the door in the morning? To answer these questions, I interviewed two psychologists, one of whom has done research on imaginary play. Here’s what they said.\n\nWhy do preschoolers love pretending to be animals?\n\nIt’s typical behavior for the under-5 set to pretend to be animals (or to role-play adult professions or fantasy characters), said Dr. Tracy Gleason, a professor of psychology at Wellesley College who has studied preschoolers’ imaginary play. “They’re doing a lot of exploring of what it’s like to be someone else, to feel something else, to interact in different ways with other people” at that age, she said.\n\nThe cognitive developmental task children are working on through this exploration is called “theory of mind,” said Dr. Gleason. It’s the idea that “other people have thoughts, and those thoughts can be different from your thoughts,” she explained.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
