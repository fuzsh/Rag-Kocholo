        "text": "Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo is one of the blander entries in the series, something about $1 million in stolen bonds, with too many dull suspects. Why it has to be set in Monte Carlo isn’t quite clear other than to create some comedy through the efforts of Lee Chan (Keye Luke) to speak French. “Actions speak louder than French,” quips his pa (Warner Oland). Luke is goofily charming as usual and, as friend reducedpricemeal points out, gets to wear some nifty white shoes. Harold Huber is very good as a police inspector, and Virginia Field and Kay Linaker are very lovely as suspects.\n\n“Tongue can hang man quicker than rope.”\n\nRandom thoughts:\n\nThis is Oland’s final outing as Chan,…\n\nEugene Forde’s crime comedy in which a trip to Monaco for Warner Oland does not exactly go to plan, as he is caught up in blackmail and murder. Also starring Keye Luke and Virginia Field.\n\nCharlie Chan at Monte Carlo is the 16th and last movie to star Warner Oland as the Chinese detective Charlie Chan, this time cutting short his holiday to crack murders and locate a vanished $1 million in bonds.\n\nWarner Oland gives a good performance in his last time as the title character Charlie Chan, the detective determined to solve the murders and also find the cash, while Keye Luke is decent as Charlie’s son Lee.\n\nElsewhere, there are fine performances to be had from Virginia…\n\nChan the man is back!\n\nWhile I deplore the broad stereotypes, both Asain and French this time, and feel unsettled by the horrid use of a caucasian actor in the lead role I have to admit I enjoy these frothy little chamber.mysteries.\n\nChan and his son stumble upon the murder of a courier while in Monte Carlo. Missing are thousands of dollars in stocks that one privileged man was going to use to bankrupt another privileged man. Caught in the web of culprits are a gambling addicted wife, a brassy showgirl living the high life, a surly bartender and a capable right hand man. It is enough to make the local police chief say \"Mon Dieu!!!\"\n\nWhat works with these…\n\nAt the end of the film Charlie Chan and Number 1 son Lee get into a taxi and comically drive away after solving one more murder case. It was to be our last sight of these two actors together in those roles. Warner Oland was to die before his next Charlie Chan film was finished and Keye Luke had no desire to continue playing his character after Oland died - there is only one Charlie Chan for me, he said of his friend who he called Pops. Oland had played Chan in 16 films - four of them now lost. By the end those were the only films he was making. Not only did the audience identify him as Chan,…\n\nThe final Warner Oland movie before his death. Meaning also it's the last one we get to see him as the master of crime solving. I wonder how I'll react to Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan? Won't be the same without a Swede as the Oriental police inspector.\n\nWarner Oland at Monte Carlo for his last case was hardly his best murder mystery, but it was one of the more funny ones because of the connection he and \"Number One Son\" Keye Luke has developed over the course of the series.\n\n\"Action speak louder then French.... (tips his hat and walks away)\"\n\nThe down side was that half the dialogue was in French, possibly Hollywood quasi French, which made this…"
