Clark agrees and Lola performs her act, which is watched by Charlie Chan, his number two son, Jimmy, and Captain Souto of the Rio de Janeiro police, who are there to arrest Lola for the murder of Manuel Cardosa a year and a half earlier in Honolulu. To avoid a scandal, Chan decides to arrest Lola quietly at her home later that night.\n\nLeaving the club with Clark, Lola follows the advice of her secretary, Helen Ashby, and visits Alfredo Marana, a noted psychic. Marana, conducting with his clients what he calls “psychognosis,” drugs them with an herbal ingredient added to the tobacco of a cigarette that is stimulated by the caffeine in a small cup of coffee. After Lola is drugged, Marana asks her a series of questions and records her confessing to the killing of Manuel Cardosa because she was in love with him but he would not leave his wife for her. Snapping Lola out of her trance-like state, Marana tells her what she said while under the influence of the truth-inducing drug, adding that he will keep the information confidential. On her way home, fearing that her dark secret will be revealed, Lola persuades Clark to agree to elope with her that same night and take a plane to the United States.\n\nBack home, Lola immediately begins to pack. Guests have already begun to arrive for the party, and while Helen tells them about the impending elopement, Chan, Jimmy, and Souto arrive to arrest Lola, and soon, the singer is found stabbed to death in her bedroom. Next to her body lies a broken brooch, a crushed corsage, and a smashed wristwatch, which, Chan notes, was deliberately set to the wrong time by the killer, as the watch stem had been not pushed back in.\n\nHelen tells Chan about Lola’s visit to Marana and about the persistent attentions of a man named Paul Wagner. The two men are brought to the house, where Wagner admits that Lola was his ex-wife and that he had come earlier in an attempt to win her back. However, upon hearing of her plans to elope with Clark, Wagner left the house. Marana then plays the recording of Lola’s session and then demonstrates his trance-inducing methods on a doubting Jimmy.\n\nLater, Chan notes that the pin belonging to the broken brooch in Lola’s room is missing and deduces that it is possibly embedded in the killer’s shoe. While Chan and Souto investigate, Jimmy catches Rice, the butler, with jewelry belonging to Lola. After a struggle, Jimmy and the police hold Rice, who admits to having stolen the jewelry, while maintaining his innocence regarding Lola Dean’s murder. Before Rice can name the murderer, the lights suddenly go out, and he is shot dead.\n\nLater, with all suspects seated at the table in the same locations where they were sitting earlier that evening, Chan reveals that Helen is in the position where, earlier, scratches were noted by the detective and Souto on the wood floor. Inspecting her shoes, Chan finds the small piece of brooch pin. He suggests that Marana place Helen in a trance in order to discover the truth. After Helen smokes the cigarette given to her by Marana and drinks the coffee, she slips into a trance, but she still maintains her innocence.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nChan then states that he would like to be tested as well, declining the cigarette offered to him by Marana in favor of that which Helen had inhaled. The detective first drinks the coffee, but, as he puffs away on the cigarette, nothing else happens, showing that Marana had purposely given Helen a non-drugged cigarette in order to protect her.\n\n“I killed Lola Dean!” says an emphatic Marana, whose real name, reveals Chan, is Alfredo Cardosa, the brother of Manuel, claiming that he had done so to avenge his murdered brother. However, Helen confesses that she committed the murders of Lola Dean and Rice because she is actually Barbara Cardosa, the widow of the murdered Manuel. Helen continues that she had wanted to take the recording of Lola to the police the next day, but when she learned of her plans to elope and leave the country, she feared that Lola would once again escape. Since Rice had seen her with Lola’s body, Helen had killed him to silence him.\n\nThroughout the film, Jimmy exhibited a growing interest in Lili Wong, Lola’s personal maid. With the case resolved, Jimmy asks his Pop for permission to bring Lili back home with them to Honolulu. Chan says no, showing Jimmy his notification of having been drafted into the United States Army.\n\nNOTES: Although Ted North’s character is called “Carlos Dantas” in the film’s onscreen credits and in reviews, in the picture he is called “Clark Denton.” According to Hollywood Review news items, Virgil Miller was originally assigned as the photographer on this film but was replaced by Joseph P. MacDonald, who was promoted after serving as an operative cameraman with Twentieth Century-Fox for eight years. An April 30, 1941 Hollywood Reporter news item noted that Jeanne Kelly had been loaned by Universal to appear in the next Charlie Chan film, and, while it was presumably this picture, her participation has not been confirmed. Charlie Chan in Rio bears a striking resemblance to The Black Camel, directed ten years earlier by Hamilton MacFadden, who appears in the cast of Rio. It is perhaps of interest to note that MacFadden also appeared briefly in The Black Camel, and he also had a minor role in Charlie Chan in Reno (1939).\n\nAdapted from: AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE CATALOG – Within Our Gates: Ethnicity in American Feature Films, 1911-1960\n\nCHARLIE CHAN’S APHORISMS\n\nInteresting problem in chemistry: sweet wine often turn nice woman sour.\n\nBiggest mistakes in history made by people who didn’t think.\n\nPretty girl, like lap dog, sometimes go mad.\n\nLong experience teach, until murderer found, suspect everybody.\n\nGood policy to have murderer consider detective dope.\n\nSlippery man sometimes slip in own oil.\n\nExperience teach, unless eyewitness present, every murder case is long shot.\n\nMust have patience.\n\nPrefer not to walk across before coming to bridge.\n\nIn these troubled times, best to be economical.\n\nTo one who kill, life can suddenly become most precious.\n\nFruits of labor sometimes very bitter.\n\nOTHER WORTHY STATEMENTS:\n\nNumber two son behave about hot music like corn over hot fire – pops. (to Sr. Souto)\n\nAs number two son would say, “Case in bag, it’s cinch.” (to Sr. Souto)\n\n(Grace Ellis: “Remember, Mr. Chan, I’m an American citizen.”) Am proud to say, so am I.\n\nLooks like long shot begin to turn into short shot. (to Sr. Souto)\n\nREVIEW\n\nVariety, August 27, 1941\n\n‘Charlie Chan in Rio’ is marked by mediocre acting and direction. It looks as if the series on the Honolulu detective is coming to the end of its rope, with this one speeding that process along. This chapter is not going to make any new friends for Charlie Chan and will probably lose many old ones.\n\nAside from Sidney Toler and his screen son, Sen Yung, the acting borders on the terrible. And to make matters worse, many of the players suffer from the camera or makeup artist, or both, notably Cobina Wright, Jr., and Jacqueline Dalya, playing the nitery singer who murders and is murdered in turn. Furthermore, Miss Wright appears badly in need of a dramatic coach. Miss Dalya sings one song, but neither the voice nor tune is standout.\n\nSamuel G. Engel and Lester Ziffren contributed the screen play, childish in plot and dialog. Harry Lachman’s direction perhaps suffered from all the handicaps, and maybe the fact that that it looks so bad is not all his own fault. However, he certainly should check his script girl for the numerous obvious boners that crept into this film.\n\nFILM NOTES\n\nPROBABLE DATE: Late February 1941\n\nDURATION: One night\n\nLOCATION: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nTHE NAME OF THE NIGHT CLUB WHERE LOLA DEAN PERFORMED: Carioca Casino\n\nTHE DANCE PERFORMED AT THE CARIOCA CASINO: Brazilian Samba\n\nSENHOR SOUTO’S TITLE: Delegado of Police (Captain of Police)\n\nCLARK DENTON’S PROPOSED MARRIAGE DATE TO LOLA DEAN: “…the first of the month.” (of March?)\n\nTHE NAME OF THE MAN WHO DELIVERED PAUL WAGNER’S FLOWERS TO LOLA DEAN IN HER DRESSING ROOM: Arturo\n\nTHE HOTEL RESIDENCE OF BOTH ALFREDO MARANA AND PAUL WAGNER: Continental Hotel\n\nALFREDO MARANA’S ROOM NUMBER: 259 (?)\n\nALFREDO MARANA’S TERM FOR THE METHOD HE USED TO PLACE HIS SUBJECTS INTO A “SEMI-COMATOSE” STATE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION: Psychognosis\n\nTHE QUESTIONS THAT ALFREDO MARANA ASKED LOLA DEAN, AND HER ANSWERS, WHILE SHE WAS UNDERGOING “PSYCHOGNOSIS”:\n\nQ: “What is your real name?t\n\nA: “Lola Wagner.”\n\nQ: “How long have you lived in Rio?”\n\nA: “Over a year.”\n\nQ: “Where did you come from?”\n\nA: “New York.”\n\nQ: “How long were you in New York?”\n\nA: “About six months.”\n\nQ: “Where did you live before that?”\n\nA: “Honolulu.”\n\nQ: “Why did you leave there?”\n\nA: “I ran away.”\n\nQ: “Why?”\n\nA: “I…I killed a man.”\n\nQ: “What was his name?”\n\nA: Manuel Cardoso [Cardosa].

During one of our weekly Charlie Chan Family Chat and Film Viewings, a new guest logged in during an evening when we were indeed watching Rio, explaining that he lives in that city! When asked if he could inform us as to some of the sights seen in the opening title screen, he generously obliged our request. So with humble gratitude for the contribution of Caulos from Rio, it is hoped that the following information will add to your viewing pleasure.\n\n1 – The famous Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar) which overlooks Baia de Guanabara (Guanabara Bay) in beaitiful Rio de Janeiro. Its peak rises about 1,300 feet above sea level.\n\n2 – Baia de Guanabara (Guanabara Bay). This bay is the entrance to the port of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n3 – Gloria Beach.\n\n4 – Avenida Beira-Mar.\n\n5 – Just through the “C” in Chan, we catch a glimpse of the Hotel Gloria. As the opening credits appear on-screen, the hotel can be seen more clearly.\n\nSONG LYRICS\n\nThey Met in Rio (A Midnight Serenade) as sung by Lola Dean at the Carioca Casino\n\nThis song of love begins the night they met down in Rio,\n\nIn a café by the bay they romanced to a midnight serenade;\n\nShe told him to forget the night they met down in Rio,\n\nAnd there were tears in her eyes as they danced to a midnight serenade.\n\nHe whispered, “You must be mine forevermore,”\n\nAnd then she showed him someone else’s picture in the tiny little locket she wore.\n\nAnd so he rode away but left his heart down in Rio,\n\nAll that remains of their love are the strains of a midnight serenade.\n\nI, Yi, Yi, Yi (Like You Very Much) as heard on the record by Lola Dean played by Alfredo Marana\n\nI, yi, yi, yi, yi, I like you very much,\n\nI, yi, yi, yi, yi, I think you’re grand;\n\nWhy, why, why is it that when I feel your touch,\n\nMy heart starts to beat, to beat the band?\n\nI, yi, yi, yi, yi like you to hold me tight,\n\nYou are too, too, too, too, too divine;\n\nIf you want to be in someone’s arms tonight,\n\nJust be sure the arms you’re in are mine.\n\nOh, I like your lips\n\nAnd I like your eyes;\n\nWould you like my hips\n\nTo hipsnotize you?\n\nSi, si, si, si, si, si, see the moon above,\n\nWay, way, way, way, way up in the blue;\n\nSi, si, si, señor, I think I fall in love.\n\nAnd when I fall, I think I fall for you.\n\nI, yi, yi, yi,\n\nSi, si, si, si,\n\nI, yi, yi, yi\n\nCan see, see, see\n\nThat you’re for me.\n\nReturn to"
