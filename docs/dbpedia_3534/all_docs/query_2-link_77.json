        "text": "MR. MOTO’S LAST WARNING, 1939. Original One Sheet (27 x 41”), (89 x 125 cm) originally folded and now linen backed movie poster starring Peter Lorre, Ricardo Cortez and Virginia Field. Directed by Norman Foster and Produced by Sol M. Wurtzel. Mr. Moto foils the plans of a group of secret agents to potentially start a second world war by blowing up a fleet of French ships, and blaming the British.\n\nMr. Moto, a fictional Japanese secret agent, was originally created by author John P. Marquand for a series of short stories for the Saturday Evening Post following the death of Earl Derr Biggers, the creator of Charlie Chan. The Mr. Moto character appeared in six novels by Marquand, and in eight films for 20th Century Fox starring Peter Lorre.\n\nThis poster is in very good original C8 condition and has retained it’s original vivid coloring. The fold lines have been retouched, and repaired where there were tears along the length of the center vertical fold line. There are five small round stain marks along the right hand side, and one along the bottom left side where metal tacks have been used prior to linen backing.\n\nCondition C8 – Sold $575 Linen Backed"
