        "text": "Hot, sweaty, tropical Panama! Where a woman without a passport is forced to try to get information from sailors at the nightclub where she sings, where the cigarette seller wears a fez, and the doctor upstairs is breeding rats with the bubonic plague, where the haberdasher is none other than Chan himself, incognito. On top of the exotic noir vibe, its a wartime picture, and someone is going to try to sabotage the fleet as it makes its way through the Canal, and only Chan can stop it! This is another one of Toler's very best. It all ends up in an old cemetery, a tomb with secret passages, and nitroglycerin bombs, and number two son Victor Sen Yung adding…\n\nAfter thwarting a bunch of arms dealers in Paris, the City in Darkness, Charlie appears to have been seconded by the U.S. Federal Government and is on the track of spies threatening American ships in the Panama Canal. It is more tightly scripted than the previous film, which was compromised by its unusual propaganda elements; and with Norman Foster back in the director’s chair it moves at a fair clip. Sen Young also makes a welcome return as No.2 son. His comic persona is well established by this stage of the series, in his constant attempts to impress his father and get involved in the case. He is more hyperactive and cartoonish than Keye Luke, No.1 son in the Oland…\n\nNorman Foster’s crime comedy adventure in which Charlie Chan examines a gang of explorers, one of whom is up to no good. Starring Sidney Toler, Jean Rogers, Lionel Atwill and Mary Nash.\n\nThis entry in the Charlie Chan series concentrates on the Chinese sleuth (Sidney Toler) attempting to catch an Axis scout ring out to destroy the Panama Canal.\n\nSidney Toler gives a good performance in his role as the title character Charlie Chan, the Chinese sleuth who is determined to find out who is responsible for committing the crime, while Victor Sen Yung is decent as Jimmy, Charlie’s No.2 son assisting him with the case.\n\nElsewhere, there are fine performances to be had from Jean Rogers, Lionel Atwill and…\n\nTHE CHARLIE CHAN PROJECT (#18)\n\nThe eighteenth in my revisit to the Charlie Chan films of the 1930s/1940s\n\nCHARLIE CHAN IN PANAMA (1940)\n\nThe war in Europe was growing in its influence on Hollywood by 1939, and the Charlie Chan films were fertile subjects for that influence. Where standard murders of greed or passion prevailed, new villains arose in the form of spies and saboteurs. As one of the most important strategic treasures in Allied possession, the Panama Canal was subject both to real-life sabotage and to fictional attempts such as form the basis for the first Charlie Chan movie of the 1940s.\n\nFor reasons not made particularly clear, Inspector Chan of the Honolulu police is working undercover in a…\n\nCharlie Chan (Sidney Toler) finds himself in Panama where a plane full of people start dropping dead one by one. It turns out there's a spy trying to blow up the Panama Canal.\n\nFollowing CITY IN DARKNESS< this Chan film is milking the WWII theme and for the most part it's an entertaining entry in the long-running series. This film here certainly had some flaws and it wasn't quite as good as some of the better films in the series but at the same time if you're a fan then you should find some entertainment here.\n\nThe biggest problem with the film is that the story itself isn't all that special. Even by 1940 standards this \"spy\" plot had been…"
