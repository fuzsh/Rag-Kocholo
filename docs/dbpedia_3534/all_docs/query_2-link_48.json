        "text": "A lot of dazzling gems are shown off in \"Second Chance,\" which, came to the Rialto yesterday, but absolutely none of their luster has been imparted to the film. It is just another tiresome go-around with a standard assortment of jewel thieves, one of whom falls in love (to his advantage) with the beautiful lady set by the cops to trap the gang. Kent Taylor plays this fellow, Louise Currie plays the girl and Dennis Hoey, Paul Guilfoyle and William Newell are among the snarling thieves. Larry Blake plays the detective who sets and baits the trap. He is not too pleased with the outcome. \"Should have been a ditch-digger,\" he says.\n\nSECOND CHANCE; original story by Louis Breslow and John Patrick; screen play by Arnold Belgard; directed by James S. Tinling; produced by Sol M. Wurtzel for Twenieth Century-Fox Pictures. At the Rialto.Kendal Wolf . . . . . Kent TaylorJoan Summers . . . . . Louise CurrieRoger Elwood . . . . .

Betty CompsonItalian film makers, who have had more recent success in films of their present age, have turned back the clock to the Middle Ages for their story of \"Marco Visconti,\" which opened yesterday at Cinema Verdi.This romance in the grand style, painting a panorama of panoplied knights and fair damsels, comes to the screen with mixed results. The direction is uneven and some of the minor roles are grossly overplayed, yet many of the scenes of jousting tournaments and high romaunt carry a genuine feeling for medieval pageantry.Some good acting in the major roles goes a long way toward making this a frequently interesting film, the story of a warlike nobleman of Milan who tries to break up the love between his cousin and the daughter of his former love.Carlo Ninchi brings real conviction and grandeur to the part of the noble Marco, while Roberto Villa and Mariella Lotti make a handsome and touching pair of lovers. Unfortunately, much of the rest of the cast is cut from an amateurish mold. The English titles are adequate and if you like tales of chivalry you might find some pleasure here.\n\nMARCO VISCONTI, an Italian production from the novel by Thomas Grossi; directed by Mario Bonnard; produced by Lux Films for release here by Film Rights International.Marco Visconti . . . . .
