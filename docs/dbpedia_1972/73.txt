Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was born on Oct. 13, 1948, in Lyallpur (now Faisalbad) in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Members of his family, including his father, had been singing qawwali for six centuries. Mr. Khan was the greatest singer of his generation in the genre of qawwali, which means wise or philosophical utterance. Qawwali songs are based on the devotional poetry of Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam, and often speak of being intoxicated by divine love. He collaborated with secular musicians, Eastern and Western, among them Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Peter Gabriel. He was heard on soundtracks of films made in India and Hollywood such as: Martin Scorsese's ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' and Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers".
