He brought Qawwali music to the mass market with multiple Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1997, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s album ‘Intoxicated Spirit‘ received a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Folk Album. In the same year, ‘Night Song‘ earned a Grammy nomination for Best World Music Album.\n\nAfter a six-week trip spanning Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, Nusrat had something to say, in a one-on-one conversation with the Herald.\n\n“We were playing to packed venues, and many people were upset because they couldn’t get tickets to our shows. Surprisingly, the audience was primarily composed of Europeans. They don’t speak our language, but we present our art in such a way that they don’t need to. We deploy rhythm and melody in such a way that they don’t need to. The Europeans claim that we do not judge language, but rather art.”\n\nListen to his most notable music on Spotify by clicking here.\n\nNotable Compositions\n\nAfreen Afreen\n\n(Praise to her Creator!
