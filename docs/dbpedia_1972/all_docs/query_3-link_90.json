        "text": "ISLAMABAD: US magazine Rolling Stone, which focuses on music, politics and popular culture, has featured Pakistani qawwali maestro on its list of “The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time,” who it said had shaped “history and defined our lives.”\n\nThe list, which was published on January 1, celebrates the “deep, empathetic bond” between artist and listener that is the “most elemental connection” in music, according to the magazine.\n\nBorn in 1948, Khan was a Pakistani vocalist, musician and music director, primarily a singer of qawwali — a form of Sufi devotional music. He was widely regarded as the greatest sufi singer in the Urdu language and often referred to as the “Shahenshah-e-Qawwali.”\n\n“Watching archival performances of the late Pakistani vocal master Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan — an icon in the realm of Qawwali, a type of Sufi devotional song, whose family’s musical legacy stretched back hundreds of years — it’s easy to lose track of time, and to hear how his music easily reached global audiences in the Eighties when he began performing abroad and recording for Peter Gabriel’s Real World label,” the magazine wrote.\n\nAmong Khan’s famous fans were Madonna, Eddie Vedder, who duetted with him on the Dead Man Walking soundtrack, and Jeff Buckley, who called the qawwali maestro “my Elvis” and studied Urdu in order to properly cover him.\n\nThis list, compiled by Rolling Stone staff and contributors, encompasses 100 years of pop music as an ongoing global conversation, where iconic Indian playback singer Lata Mangeshkar lands between Amy Winehouse and Johnny Cash, and salsa queen Celia Cruz is up there in the rankings with Prince and Marvin Gaye.\n\nISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday met with Imam of the Prophet’s Mosque, Sheikh Dr. Salah bin Muhammad Al-Budair, in Lahore and told him that his visit would further strengthen relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, Sharif’s office said.\n\nSheikh Dr. Salah bin Muhammad Al-Budair arrived on a seven-day visit to Pakistan on Thursday. Since his arrival, the Imam of Prophet’s Mosque has met President Asif Ali Zardari, Army Chief General Asim Munir, and has led Friday prayers at Shah Faisal Mosque in the federal capital.\n\nDuring their meeting, PM Sharif told Sheikh Salah that his visit was an “honor” for the South Asian country and expressed his best wishes for King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to Sharif’s office.\n\n“The people of Pakistan have immense respect for the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and the Saudi leadership,” Sharif’s office quoted him as telling the Imam of Prophet’s Mosque. “Your visit will further improve relations between the two countries.”\n\nThe Prophet’s Mosque, more popularly known as Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, holds profound historical and spiritual significance in Islam, having been built by the first Muslim community under the supervision of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nIt is also his last resting place, making imams of this sacred mosque deeply respected across the Muslim world and widely viewed as embodiments of religious devotion and scholarly wisdom.\n\nDuring the meeting, Sheikh Salah expressed his gratitude to the premier for the hospitality accorded to him in Pakistan, according to Sharif’s office. The meeting was also attended by members of PM Sharif’s cabinet and Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Pakistan, Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Malki.\n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia enjoy strong economic, defense and religious ties. The Kingdom is home to over 2.7 million Pakistani expatriates, serving as the top source of remittances for the cash-strapped South Asian country.\n\nPakistan has also been frequently visited by the prayer leader of the Grand Mosque in Makkah in the past. These visits, along with high-level official exchanges, have played a significant role in strengthening the relations between the two countries.\n\nSaudi religious scholars, such as the prayer leaders of the two holy mosques, have fostered closer ties between the two countries, with many of them often taking a special interest in Islamic education and religious institutions in Pakistan.\n\nSheikh Salah is also scheduled to meet prominent Pakistani scholars and visit universities during his stay in the South Asian country.\n\nDHAKA: Bangladesh retained all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan on Sunday in the squad for this month’s Test series against Pakistan, despite the former ruling party lawmaker facing backlash after the country’s premier was toppled.\n\nShakib, 37, lost his status as a lawmaker after parliament was dissolved following the dramatic ouster of long-time ruler Sheikh Hasina after weeks of deadly mass protests.\n\n“The emphasis was on picking our best players,” chief selector Gazi Ashraf Hossain said in a statement.\n\nThe all-rounder, who was elected as a lawmaker from Hasina’s Awami League in a controversial general election on January 7, is currently in Canada to play in a Twenty20 competition.\n\nSince Hasina fled to India on August 5, her party offices have been looted and torched, and many members of her Awami League have gone into hiding fearing violence.\n\nShakib is expected to join the Bangladesh squad in Pakistan, where they will play two Test matches in Rawalpindi and Karachi between August 21 and September 3.\n\nWicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim returned to the squad, after missing Bangladesh’s previous Test series against Sri Lanka at home in March and April.\n\nSelectors also included pacer Taskin Ahmed.\n\n“This is a well balanced squad,” Hossain said in a statement.\n\n“The likes of Mushfiqur, Mominul (Haque), and Shakib have played 216 matches combined, and there is no substitute for that kind of experience.”\n\nHossain said Taskin would be considered only for the second Test as he hasn’t bowled in a Test since June last year.\n\n“Pakistan are very tough opponents, especially in their home front and it will be a challenging tour for us,” added Hossain.\n\nThe team will leave Dhaka on Monday for the series, which is also part of the ICC World Test Championship.\n\nSquad: Najmul Hossain Shanto (Capt), Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Zakir Hasan, Shadman Islam, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Liton Das, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam, Nayeem Hasan, Nahid Rana, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud, Taskin Ahmed, Khaled Ahmed\n\nKARACHI: Hundreds of people attended on Sunday a minority rights rally in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi and called for an end to “discrimination” against minorities and the “misuse” of the country’s blasphemy laws, defying threats from a religious group.\n\nBlasphemy, punishable by death as per Pakistani law, is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim-majority Pakistan where mere accusations have led to street lynchings. Human rights groups say Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores.\n\nThe minority rights rally in Karachi was organized in relation to the National Minorities Day, observed every year on August 11. Authorities initially denied permission for the march after an activist of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) religious group threatened in a video to disrupt it.\n\nThe participants of Sunday’s rally gathered at the Frere Hall building, with police guarding the venue and allowing access only through a single gate. Dozens of TLP activists also gathered near the Karachi Press Club, a small distance away, but were prevented by police from disrupting the event.\n\nLuke Victor, a human rights activist from the Christian community, said some people were spreading misinformation that the minorities wanted the blasphemy laws to be abolished, calling for action against those who filed false cases and desecrated Christian places of worship.\n\n“We did not raise the slogan to abolish or repeal the [blasphemy] law. Our slogan was that if you file a complaint, let the courts do their job. Do not burn Jaranwala, do not burn Nazir Masih,” he said, referring to mob attacks against Christians.\n\n“Those who burned my Bible, desecrated my cross and burned my church, are these not acts of blasphemy? Register cases against them and punish them too.”\n\nSardar Ram Singh, a Sikh activist, said they were celebrating the day in continuation of a speech by Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, on August 11, 1947, in which he had guaranteed religious freedoms for minorities in Pakistan.\n\nDespite challenges, Singh expressed his love for the country and described it as the “land of our ancestors.” “Pakistan is no less than a heaven for us,” he added.\n\nGhazala Shafiq, a pastor, criticized the government for projecting religious tolerance, while the “ground reality was different.”\n\n“We want this sort of Pakistan where there is no discrimination in the name of religion,” she said. “That’s what sort of impression we want to give to the world that please make such sort of policies, action plans, strategies which can create harmony.”\n\nNida Kirmani, another rights activist, said Jinnah in his August 11, 1947 speech had stressed that followers of every religion had an equal place in the country.\n\n“Over the decades, that idea has been completely forgotten,” she said. “I think this day is a reminder [of that very idea].”\n\nAlso on Sunday, Pakistan’s president and prime minister promised to protect religious freedoms as the South Asian country marked the National Minorities Day.\n\n“On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to the promise made by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, on 11th August 1947, to the country’s minorities to protect their rights and religious freedoms,” President Asif Ali Zardari said in a statement.\n\nPM Shehbaz Sharif paid a tribute to minorities for their “outstanding role” in the country’s development and prosperity, and expressed his commitment to protecting their rights.\n\n“The purpose of celebrating the day is to express solidarity with the minorities living in Pakistan and to acknowledge their services for the state of Pakistan,” he said.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s president and prime minister on Sunday promised to protect religious freedoms as the South Asian country marked the National Minorities Day, Pakistani state media reported.\n\nPakistan observes the National Minorities Day every year on August 11 since 2009, when the Pakistani government established it with the aim of recognizing the contributions of religious minorities to the nation’s progress.\n\nA range of events, discussions and communal assemblies are organized by the government, through the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Inter-faith Harmony, and various minority communities to observe the day.\n\nIn his message, President Asif Ali Zardari said minorities in Pakistan enjoyed all political, economic and social rights which had been guaranteed by the constitution, the state-run Radio Pakistan broadcaster reported.\n\n“On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to the promise made by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, on 11th August 1947, to the country’s minorities to protect their rights and religious freedoms,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nThe president noted that the government had taken a number of steps for political, social and economic empowerment of minorities, urging all stake-holders to educate the masses about the rights of minorities and promote interfaith harmony, tolerance and unity to make Pakistan a strong country.\n\nPresident Zardari expressed his confidence that the minorities of Pakistan would continue to play their positive role toward the country’s development.\n\nIn his statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid a tribute to minorities for their “outstanding role” in the country’s development and prosperity.\n\n“The purpose of celebrating the day is to express solidarity with the minorities living in Pakistan and to acknowledge their services for the state of Pakistan,” Sharif was quoted as saying by Radio Pakistan.\n\nSharif expressed his commitment to protect the rights of minorities and their overall development and prosperity.\n\nSeparately, the armed forces of Pakistan, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee chairman, and the services chiefs also acknowledged the contributions of minorities to the nation’s progress, prosperity and rich cultural heritage.\n\nISLAMABAD: An army officer, who was injured in a gunfight with militants in northwest Pakistan this week, on Sunday succumbed to his injuries at a military-run hospital in Peshawar, the Pakistani military said.\n\nLt. Uzair Mehmood Malik was injured during clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants in Tirah Valley in the Khyber district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing.\n\nThe clashes had left four militants and three Pakistani soldiers dead, while Lt. Malik, after having fought bravely, was taken to Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Peshawar in a critical condition.\n\n“Today, he succumbed to injuries and embraced Shahadat (martyrdom),” the ISPR said in a statement. “Security Forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave officers and soldiers further strengthen our resolve.”\n\nPakistan has witnessed a surge in militant activities since the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, unilaterally called off a fragile ceasefire with the government in November 2022.\n\nMuch of TTP’s militant activity has been confined to the country’s western provinces, prompting security officials to launch intelligence-based operations against its fighters who are reportedly armed with sophisticated military equipment, including night vision devices.\n\nEarlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari backed the country’s security forces in their fight against militants, following the Tirah clashes.\n\n“The entire nation is standing with its security forces to root out the scourge of terrorism,” Zardari was quoted as saying by the state media.\n\nIn a separate statement, PM Sharif praised Pakistan’s security forces for battling militants and vowed the country would not let up in its war against militancy.\n\n“The officers and jawans of armed forces of Pakistan always gave preference to performance of duty over their lives,” he was quoted as saying by the state-run APP news agency.\n\n“War against terrorism would continue till its complete eradication from the country.”"
