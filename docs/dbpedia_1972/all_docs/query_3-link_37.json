        "text": "Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (Urdu: نصرت فتح علی خان‎; 13 October 1948 – 16 August 1997), a Pakistani musician, was primarily a singer of Qawwali, the devotional music of the Sufis. Considered one of the greatest voices ever recorded, he possessed an extraordinary range of vocal abilities and could perform at a high level of intensity for several hours. Extending the 600-year old Qawwali tradition of his family, Khan is widely credited with introducing Qawwali music to international audiences. He is popularly known as \"Shahenshah-e-Qawwali\", meaning \"The King of Kings of Qawwali\". Born in Faisalabad, Pakistan, Khan had his first public performance at age of 16, at his father's chelum. He became the head of the family qawwali party in 1971. He was signed by Oriental Star Agencies, Birmingham, England, in the early 1980s. Khan went on to release movie scores and albums in Europe, India, Japan, Pakistan, and the U.S.A. He engaged in collaborations and experiments with Western artists, becoming a well-known world music artist. He toured extensively, performing in over 40 countries.\n\n[]\n\nKershaw revealed in the 2012 radio documentary, Guru Of Peace: An Introduction To Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, that he first heard the artist through the WOMAD compilation album sometime in either 1985 or 1986, where he first heard his track, Allah Hoo Allah Hoo. In fact, the album was called the Best Of Qawwal And Party Volume One, which was released in 1986 on the WOMAD record label, that was founded by Peter Gabriel in 1980. Kershaw later invited the singer for a session on his show in 1988, in which he performed only two tracks, as each track was very long. A year later in 1989, the singer did his second session for Andy's programme, but this time with four tracks.\n\nSessions[]\n\n1. Recorded: 1988-02-25. First Broadcast: 10 March 1988.
