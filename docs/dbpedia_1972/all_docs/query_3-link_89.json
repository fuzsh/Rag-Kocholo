        "text": "“Working together was fascinating. We weren’t quite sure how each other worked. I didn’t want to offend him, I didn’t know what he would be prepared to do or experiment with; how loose he’d be. But in fact he was an extraordinary improvisor. He was capable of coming up with great melodies spontaneously. There are only two or three other musicians I’ve ever met who can do that but I think what he had, perhaps better than them, was the sense of overall structure as he was going into an improvisation. It seemed as if he had a sense of timing, the build, the peaks, the valleys and the climaxes all in his head or it was magnificent composition if he didn’t carry it in his head.\n\nUnlike many artists working with devotional music Nusrat was very open and very generous and willing to try almost anything with anyone who was enthusiastic and it was great for us that we had the wonderful chance to work with him on the Passion soundtrack. It was probably the most magical evening of that whole recording and there’s a scene in the film with Christ carrying the cross and it is deeply spiritual music for me and I think Scorsese too was delighted with that performance and it’s really Nusrat’s voice that builds it and lifts it.\n\nWe worked together live a couple of times, the last time was in Los Angeles for the human rights organisation WITNESS and we had perhaps two rehearsals prior to filming in front of a large TV audience and each time he was coming up with very different improvisations and they were stunning. I’m very pleased that we’d had quite a few years working together prior to that and there was a relationship and trust because I think that would have been a little difficult otherwise. We both tried to make space for each other to do what we could, me more on the arrangement side and him in terms of the voice, but it is a performance that I’ll remember always and I think blew away a lot of the Hollywood audience.\n\nIt was an amazing experience to be able to work with him and I miss him enormously.” – Peter Gabriel"
