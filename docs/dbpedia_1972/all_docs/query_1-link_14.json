        "text": "WEB DESK: In commemoration of Shahenshah-e-Qawwali Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s (NFAK) 75th birthday on October 13, fans around the world are paying tribute to the legendary qawwali maestro, whose soulful voice left an indelible mark on the rich musical heritage of Pakistan.\n\nFor many 90s kids, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s qawwalis were a staple in their households, creating an enduring connection with his timeless music.\n\nRecognised as one of the most celebrated South Asian musicians in history, NFAK’s influence extended globally, with performances at prestigious venues worldwide and a multitude of accolades to his name.\n\nRead more: Pakistani celebrities challenge ‘misinformation’ on one-sided Israel-Hamas conflict\n\nOn the special occasion, let’s revisit some of the iconic melodies of NFAK that continue to resonate with audiences, both in Pakistan and beyond:\n\nYeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor\n\nFrom NFAK’s 1991 album The Day, the Night, the Dawn, the Dusk, the song continues to be cherished by fans worldwide. Despite several remakes of the original masterpiece, it remains a heartwarming favourite.\n\nDillagi\n\nTumhe Dillagi Bhool Jani Padegi is from the 1992 album Dillagi Vol 8. Once again, fans have experienced various remakes, but none of them come close to the brilliance of this magnum opus.\n\nMast Nazron Se\n\nIt delves into the theme of heartbreak, and its soulful lyrics continue to resonate with us today, perhaps even more profoundly than ever before.\n\nDam Mast Qalandar\n\nAn all-time classic, Dam Mast Qalandar from Sultan of Sufi stands out as one of the most iconic pieces in Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s extensive discography.\n\nAfreen Afreen\n\nOn a day like this, one cannot miss out on this hit. While many have been oscillating between the original and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Momina Mustehsan’s version of Afreen Afreen, there’s no denying that this love-filled qawwali sung by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan just hits differently.\n\nKisi Da Yar Na Bichray\n\nHow can we forget the masterpiece from NFAK’s 1995 album A Tribute: The Essential Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Vol. 1\n\nFans are expressing their heartfelt wishes and fond memories, acknowledging Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s unparalleled contribution to the world of music. Social media is abuzz with tributes, underscoring the enduring legacy of the “Shehnsah-e Qawali” (King of Qawwali)."
