        "text": "Qawwali music is a form of Sufi devotional music popular in South Asia with a tradition which stretches back for hundreds of years. Nusrat was responsible for bringing Qawwali music from Pakistan to the Western world and his collaborations on Real World Records with Michael Brook – 1990’s Mustt Mustt and 1996’s Night Song – are regarded as modern classics.\n\nThere are a total of nine records by Nusrat on Real World Records, including two posthumous releases following his premature death in 1997.\n\nNusrat’s voice and music continue to enrapture and entertain audiences worldwide and his legacy lives on, inspiring artists from all different creative backgrounds. Undoubtedly in recent times Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan through his music was the most significant bearer of the Sufi message of love."
