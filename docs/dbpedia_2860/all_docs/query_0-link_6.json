        "text": "As an interdisciplinary, professional Society, AVS supports networking among academic, industrial, government, and consulting professionals involved in a variety of disciplines - chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, all engineering disciplines, business, sales, etc. through common interests related to the basic science, technology development, and commercialization of materials, interfaces, and processing. Each year, AVS hosts local and international meetings, publishes five journals, honors members through its awards and recognition program, provides training, and offers career services. Founded in 1953, AVS is organized into technical divisions and technical groups that encompass a range of established as well as emerging science and technology areas. There are also regional chapters, international chapters and affiliates, and student chapters that promote communication and networking for professionals and students within a geographical region. AVS is comprised of approximately 4,500 members worldwide. AVS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics with additional benefits for our members. The Student Chapter of AVS at UCLA aims to bring workshops and other vacuum science trainings to UCLA's campus as well as providing community for those in vacuum science related fields.\n\nSignatories: Benjamin Heronimus, Zachary Wong, and Min Jong Kil\n\nAdvisor: Orlando Luna"
