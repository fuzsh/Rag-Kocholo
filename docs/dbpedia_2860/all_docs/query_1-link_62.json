        "text": "The world’s most sensitive dark matter detector still hasn't found evidence of weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, but the search continues.\n\nMaterials with high magnetoelectric coupling could be useful in novel devices such as magnetic computer memories, chemical sensors and quantum computers.\n\nFeliciano Guistino led a week-long workshop for graduate-level students in modern techniques for computational data science and high-performance computing.\n\nUsing supercomputer simulations, Feliciano Giustino and his team are revealing why perovskites are so promising for solar cells, lighting and computer memory.\n\nThere’s a big debate in cosmology about how fast the universe is currently expanding.\n\nEarly career researchers from the Department of Physics were selected for highly competitive Department of Defense awards.\n\nMeet the graduating seniors being recognized for excellence in research, academics and improving the community."
