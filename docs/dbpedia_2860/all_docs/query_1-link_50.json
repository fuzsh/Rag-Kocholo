        "text": "American Vacuum Society (AVS) supports networking and camaraderie among academic, industrial, government, and consulting professionals involved in emerging interdisciplinary research related to materials, interfaces, and processing. AVS was looking to redesign their website as it was looking outdated and they wanted to give it new life with a modern look and functionality. The main goal of the redesign was to give the site a modern, mobile-friendly updated refresh. Wakefly created the design, keeping it simple yet functional with a modern look while ensuring it was inline with AVSâ€™s existing brand guidelines. The redesign included a restructuring of content, making it easier for AVS to create new content, as well as manage and edit existing content. We leveraged Kentico for the CMS, as AVS was already using an older version of Kentico, our expertise with Kentico was one of the reasons AVS came to Wakefly.\n\nThe final site is more streamlined and easier for the AVS team to update and add new content, and offerings. Wakefly is also hosting the new site within our AVS hosting environment."
