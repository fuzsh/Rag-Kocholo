        "text": "American Vacuum Society records, 1953-2007\n\nDescription of Collection\n\nRepository\n\nNiels Bohr Library and Archives\n\nPapers created by\n\nAmerican Vacuum Society.\n\nSize of collection\n\n18.0 Linear feet\n\n16 records boxes, 1 oversize box, and 1 oversize folder\n\nShort description of collection\n\nThis collection contains the records of the American Vacuum Society and its predecessor organization, the Committee on Vacuum Techniques, as well as records of committees, topical divisions, and regional chapters.\n\nLanguage(s) of collection\n\nEnglish\n\nUnit ID\n\nAR.1998.421\n\nHistory of the American Vacuum Society\n\nThis text was adapted from the AVS History page on the American Vacuum Society's website. An exhaustive history of the Society can be found in the e-book 50 Years of the AVS (1953-2003), available from the Society's website at http://www2.avs.org/historybook/default.asp.\n\nOn June 18, 1953, fifty-six people from diverse technical backgrounds, gathered in New York City to consider the need for a forum to discuss problems and applications of high vacuum technology. Six days later, the Committee on Vacuum Techniques was formally organized with the mandate to initiate a symposium and develop programs for education and for standards. The first symposium was held June 16-18, 1954 and attracted 295 registrants from several countries.\n\nUntil 1961, the Society was essentially comprised of the people attending the annual symposium, whose votes elected the officers and committee chairs for the succeeding year. At the 1957 Symposium, the membership changed the name of the group to the American Vacuum Society, Inc. A revised Constitution and By-Laws was adopted in 1961, establishing the current procedure of a mail ballot for the election of officers and directors.\n\nThe Society was originally organized in the northeast and remained largely in the East and Midwest for several years. As the membership expanded throughout the country, the need for regional groups increased. The first such group was developed by members in the Seattle area, which became the Pacific Northwest Section of the AVS in 1962. Other groups soon followed and there are now 19 regional Chapters throughout the country.\n\nThe Society became an affiliate member of the American Institute of Physics (AIP) in 1963 and was elected a full member in 1976. In 1967, the AVS office moved from Boston to the AIP building in New York, and a full-time Executive Secretary was hired for the Society from 1968 until 1989. In 1992, a Technical Director was hired to lead the AVS into new and important technical areas, and in 1993, an Office Manager was brought on board to run the New York Office. In that same year, the AVS moved from its location on 45th Street in New York City in the AIP building (the AIP was relocating to College Park, Maryland) to its current location in the Association Center for non-profit associations at 120 Wall Street. At the present time, the Society has seven employees at the AVS Headquarters on Wall Street and two at the Editorial Office of the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology in North Carolina. Membership of the Society was about 6,000 in 1995.\n\nEarly publications of the Society were transactions of the annual symposia from 1954 to 1963. The first volume of the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology appeared in 1965. In 1983 the Journal was split into two sections: A -- devoted to Vacuum, Surfaces and Films, and B -- devoted to Microelectronics, Processing and Phenomena. In January 1991, the scope of section B was expanded to include nanometer-scale science and technology with a subtitle change to Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures --Processing, Measurement and Phenomena. In 1985, a new publication format, devoted primarily to the publication of topical conferences, was introduced to permit separate and timely publication of each conference in archival format at an acceptable cost. These are published by AIP as the AVS Conference Series. Surface Science Spectra, an archival journal for the publication of spectra databases from surface analysis techniques was first published in 1992. Biointerphases launched in 2006 as an open access journal for the biomaterials interface community providing an interdisciplinary platform for scientific exchange among the biology, chemistry, physics and materials sciences communities.\n\nTo respond to specific interests within the membership, divisional organizations were developed. The first of these, Vacuum Metallurgy, was formed in 1961, which became Advanced Surface Engineering in 1999 when an existing organization affiliated with the Society. The remaining Divisions developed largely from within the Society; listed in order of formation, they are: Thin Films (1964); Surface Science (1968); Vacuum Technology (1970); Electronic Materials and Processing (1979); Fusion Technology (1980), which became Plasma Science and Technology in 1986; Applied Surface Science (1985); Nanometer-Scale Science and Technology (1992); Magnetic Interfaces and Nanostructures (1999); Biomaterial Interfaces (2003). Technical Groups, which focus on newly emerging, dynamic growth areas of science and technology, were established in 1994, and include Manufacturing Science and Technology (MSTG) (1994), The Science of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) (1999), and Technology for Sustainability Technical Group (TSTG) (2003).\n\nScope and Contents of Collection\n\nThis collection contains administrative records, minutes, correspondence and subject files, rosters for membership and attendance, publications (including bibliographies, newsletters, membership directories and brochures), reports, and material related to symposia and short courses. It constitutes the archives of the American Vacuum Society, which are maintained before their transfer by the AVS Archivist, an ex-officio member of the AVS History Committee. In additon, the records contain administrative and business records received from the AVS National Office.\n\nThe records contain important historical material and provide a complete set of board minutes from the initial meeting of the Committee on Vacuum Techniques onwards. Other notable historical records include materials on the creation of the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology, the incorporation of AVS, correspondence with other national and international vacuum technology societies, and a set of membership cards that served as the official membership record from the mid 1960s to the 1980s.\n\nThe collection also has a wide breadth of records from the Society's committees, topical divisions, and regional chapters. It should be noted that there are often large gaps in these records, often resulting from rotating leadership of these groups and geographic and institutional dispersal of their membership.\n\nRestrictions on Use and Access\n\nPermission of an officer of depositing organization required for access to records less than 25 years old.\n\nResearchers must have an approved access application on file in order to access archival materials. https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/item-request.\n\nSelected Search Terms\n\nPersons\n\nBeavis, Leonard C.\n\nDenton, Richard A.\n\nDuke, Charles B.\n\nHablanian, M.

These accessions were arranged thematically by a member of the American Vacuum Society prior to their transfer to the Niels Bohr Library and Archives. After reviewing the organization of the records as received, the processing archivist made the decision not to treat it as the original order of the records. The current arrangement reflects the organizational structure of the American Vacuum Society.\n\nThe bulk of the collection is arranged chronologically, with a few exceptions arranged alphabetically. Notable examples of these exceptions include the Committee records (Subgroup 3), the Division and Technical Group records (Subgroup 4), and the Chapter and Region records (Subgroup 5). Within each of these subgroups, records are arranged alphabetically by the name of the subordinate body.\n\nMaterial Separated from Collection\n\nA large amount of monographic material was received in various accessions and is now held in the book collection of the Niels Bohr Library. These include materials in the AVS Monograph Series and several books on the history of AVS and vacuum science and technology.\n\nAll photographs and negatives in the collection have been separated to the Emilio Segrè Visual Archives Collection.\n\nProvenance and Acquisition Information\n\nTransferred to the Niels Bohr Library and Archives by the American Vacuum Society in several accessions: 1998 (AR 421), 1999 (AR 13), 2000 (AR 64), 2001 (AR 486), 2002 (AR 540), 2007 (AR 760), 2008 (AR 816), and through accrual (AR 334).\n\nFurther accruals are expected.\n\nProcessing Information\n\nThis collection was formed through the combination of several individual accessions. The processing of the combined collection was completed by Mark A. Matienzo in May 2008.\n\nPreferred Citation of Collection\n\nCite as: Item and date, Box [number], Folder [number], American Vacuum Society records, 1953-2007, Niels Bohr Library and Archives, American Institute of Physics, College Park, MD.\n\nRelated Collections\n\nNiels Bohr Library and Archives:\n\nMonograph materials published by the American Vacuum Society\n\nAmerican Institute of Physics.

In February 1985, John Sullivan made a proposal during a Board of Directors meeting to change the committee's name to the Recommended Practices Committee. The change of name required a change to the AVS constitution, which was subsequently approved by AVS membership later that year.\n\nBox 5 Folder 15 Standards Committee rosters, 1969-1979\n\nBox 5

records\n\nBiographical/Historical note\n\nThe Vacuum Metallurgy Division (VMD) was the first division created in the Society. As surface engineering became more and more important to the International Conference On Metallurgical Coatings And Thin Films and as the interest in vacuum melting decreased, it was recognized that the name of the Division did not reflect its main activities. Surface engineering was its main thrust, and Bill Sproul lead an effort to change the name of the division.
