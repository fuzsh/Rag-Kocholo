It was sometimes referred to as accounting but bookkeepers were still doing basic data entry and calculations for business owners. The businesses in question were small enough that the owners were personally involved and aware of the financial health of their companies. Business owners didn't need professional accountants to create complex financial statements or cost-benefit analyses.\n\nThe American Railroad\n\nThe appearance of corporations in the United States and the creation of the railroad were the catalysts that transformed bookkeeping into the practice of accounting based on accounting postulates. The railroad was by far the most powerful of the two factors.\n\nDistribution networks, shipping schedules, fare collection, competitive rates, and some way to evaluate whether all of this is being done in the most efficient way possible are all necessary for goods and people to reach their destinations. Enter accounting with its cost estimates, financial statements, operating ratios, production reports, and a multitude of other metrics to give businesses the data they needed to make informed decisions.\n\nThe railroads also allowed information to be passed from city to city at great speed. Business transactions could be settled in days rather than months. Timing was uneven across the country before the railroad. Each township previously decided when the day began and ended by general consensus. This was changed to a uniform system in 1883 because it was necessary to have goods delivered and unloaded at certain stations at predictable times.\n\nInvesting had been a game of either knowledge or luck up until the 1800s. People acquired issues of stock in companies with which they were familiar through industry knowledge or acquaintanceships with the owners. Others blindly invested according to the encouragement of relatives and friends.\n\nThere were no financials to check if you wanted to invest in a corporation or business. The risks involved therefore ensured that investing was only for the wealthy, a rich man’s sport tantamount to gambling.\n\nEarly Financial Statements\n\nCorporations began to publish their financials in the form of balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements to attract investors. These documents were proof of a company’s profit-making abilities.\n\nInvestment capital stimulated operations and profits for most corporations but it also increased the pressure on management to please their new bosses: the shareholders. These shareholders didn't completely trust management and this exposed the need for independent financial reviews of a company’s operations.\n\nBirth of a Profession\n\nAccountants were already essential for attracting investors and they quickly became essential for maintaining investor confidence. The American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA) was established in 1887 and the accounting profession was formally recognized in 1896 with the establishment of the professional title of certified public accountant (CPA).\n\nHow Has Modern Accounting Evolved?\n\nTechnology has changed accounting. Bookkeeping has become automated. Bookkeepers have used several tools since the first records were kept in America. William Seward Burroughs’ adding machine was created in 1887 and perfected for commercial sale in the 1890s. It helped early accountants calculate receipts and quickly reconcile their books.\n\nIBM's first large computer was based on the vacuum tube when it was first released in 1952. It was small enough to make it possible for businesses to buy them and this led to accountants being among the first to use them. Transistors were replacing the tubes and making computers even more accessible by 1959. They were being supplanted by microchips as early as 1961, which eventually led to computers for everyone.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe concept of accounting has been around in one form or another for centuries. Initially designed to record trades made in barter systems, the practice has evolved over generations thanks to contributions made by second-century B.C. economist Chanakya, Luca Pacioli, and the Mesopotamians.\n\nTechnology has brought about the advent of accounting software such as QuickBooks. These advancements are much more intuitive, helping accountants do their job more quickly, more accurately, and with more ease."
