        "text": "Known initially as Izumi-ya, Sumitomo began its operations in the fields of copper refining, trading, and mining. Its Shikoku Besshi Copper Mine first opened in 1691, and by 1888, mining operations had expanded enough to warrant the introduction of the \"shop practices\" concept as a way of manufacturing and repairing equipment and tools used at the mine. This marked the beginning of Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd.\n\nThe company went through several name changes during the course of its history, first with the change to Kikaika (or \"Machinery Division\") in 1894, and then to Niihama Seisakusho (or \"Niihama Works\") in 1928. The company was established as an independent public corporation in 1934 under the name of Sumitomo Machinery Co., Ltd. In 1940, its name was again changed to Sumitomo Kikai Kogyo Co., Ltd. (or \"Sumitomo Machinery Industries\").\n\nIn 1969, the company joined forces with Uraga Heavy Industries, Ltd., a company first established as Uraga Dock Co., Ltd. in 1897 with the advocacy of Takeaki Enomoto. After the merger, the company, now operating under the name of Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd., opened up two large-scale plants, the Oppama Shipyard (currently known as the Yokosuka Works) and Toyo Works, establishing its foundations as a heavy industries company.\n\nSumitomo Heavy Industries has always strived for technological innovation and applies cutting-edge technologies wherever possible. The company operates in a broad range of business areas ranging from manufacturing equipment and infrastructure to fields making use of the latest advanced technology. Most recently, the company's research and development efforts have focused on fine, mechatronics, and systems technologies and by doing so it has been able to gain a foothold in the areas of precision control devices and key components. For example, the company has succeeded in developing equipment for the manufacturing of LCDs and semiconductors as well as digital home appliances. This new area of business is positioned to become the third core competency for the company after power transmission equipment and plastics machinery."
