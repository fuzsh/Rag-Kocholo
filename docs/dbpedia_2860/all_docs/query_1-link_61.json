        "text": "8:33 a.m., Nov. 17, 2009----Juan Carlos Rodriguez-Reyes, a doctoral student in the University of Delaware's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, has been named recipient of the Dorothy M. and Earl S. Hoffman Award at the 56th International Symposium and Exhibition of the American Vacuum Society (AVS) held Nov. 8-13 at the San Jose (Calif.) Convention Center.\n\nThe Hoffman Award, established in 2002 to recognize and encourage excellence in graduate studies in the sciences and technologies of interest to the American Vacuum Society, is the top-level award given to a single graduate student each year by the society.\n\nThe award consists of a cash award, a certificate, and reimbursed travel support to attend the international symposium.\n\nIn addition, Rodriguez-Reyes was recognized as a runner-up in the competition for the Morton M. Traum Surface Science Division Student Award, which is presented annually for the best student poster at the International symposium and exhibition of the American Vacuum Society.\n\nRodriguez-Reyes works in the research group of Andrew V. Teplyakov, professor of physical chemistry.\n\nRodriguez-Reyes received a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a master's in materials science and engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.\n\nHe is studying surface chemistry in both aqueous and ultra high vacuum conditions for application in microelectronics, heterogeneous catalysis, and other fields of surface science."
