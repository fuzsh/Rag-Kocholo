        "text": "The Vacuum Society of the Philippines (VSP) is the first Philippine society composed of members from the academe and industry who engage in research and development on plasma and vacuum science and technology and allied fields.\n\nIt began in the Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPL), National Institute of Physics (NIP), University of the Philippines (UP), Diliman. Dr. Henry J. Ramos, the Program Coordinator of PPL and the pioneer of plasma physics in the Philippines, envisioned a national institution dedicated to the study of plasma science and vacuum technology. He then invited forward-thinking individuals who share the same vision as his and made the first steps in achieving this dream. The society was formed on February 20, 2015 and officially incorporated under Philippine laws on August 13, 2015.\n\nThe eleven founding board members of the society are as follows:\n\nDr. Henry J. Ramos (NIP, UP Diliman)\n\nDr. Magdaleno R. Vasquez Jr. (DMMME, UP Diliman) (President)\n\nProf. Ivan B. Culaba (Ateneo de Manila University) (Secretary)\n\nDr. Christian Lorenz S. Mahinay (Ateneo de Manila University) (Treasurer)\n\nDr. Roy B. Tumlos (UP Manila)\n\nDr. Luis Ma. Bo-ot (NIP, UP Diliman)\n\nDr. Gil Nonato G. Santos (De La Salle University)\n\nMr. Leo Mendel D. Rosario (FEATI University)\n\nMr. Marcedon S. Fernandez (University of San Carlos)\n\nDr. Michelle Marie S. Villamayor (Link√∂ping University, Sweden)\n\nDr. Julie Ann S. Ting (Lindberg, Subic)\n\nThe society was established to attain the following objectives:\n\nTo provide a learning environment for members through different activities such as seminars, conferences, and technical trainings,\n\nTo foster a culture of support and collaboration among members to advance the field,\n\nTo engage with academe and industry to ensure transfer of knowledge as well as stimulation of innovation and inventiveness,\n\nTo network with different professional organizations whose objectives include the promotion of scientific and technological advancement related to vacuum technology and allied fields.\n\nAfter the incorporation, the members of the board met to discuss avenues for exchange and collaboration as well as the promotion of the science and technology of vacuum and related fields. Thus, the first international symposium was conceptualized to foster linkages and to strengthen collaborations as well as to welcome new members and establish a community of likeminded practitioners. In less than a year after incorporation, the 1st International Symposium of the Vacuum Society of the Philippines was held on January 14-15, 2016 at the Ateneo de Manila University. This event showcased the various capabilities in vacuum and plasma research in the Philippines and with other collaborating institutions. With a growing network of professionals, the society is hopeful that this will continue for more future conferences held biannually. The society is still young but the initial steps in forming a national institution for the promotion of plasma and vacuum in the Philippines are already in the right direction. The VSP will forge a new beginning for the advancement of vacuum technology, plasma science, and allied fields in the Philippines."
