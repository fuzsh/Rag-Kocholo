        "text": "Bridget Rogers, an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, has been elected president of the American Vacuum Society (AVS). She will serve a three-year term as president-elect for 2024, president for 2025, and past resident for 2026.\n\nThe American Vacuum Society is comprised of approximately 4,500 members and supports networking and camaraderie among academic, industrial, government, and consulting professionals involved in emerging interdisciplinary research related to materials, interfaces, and processing.\n\nDr. Rogers’ research focuses on surfaces, interfaces, and films of technically important materials. She works to establish relationships between the processing parameters, the material properties, and finally the performance of the film in its proposed application.\n\nDr. Rogers is a graduate of the University of Colorado, where she majored in chemical engineering. She holds a master’s degree and a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Arizona State University."
