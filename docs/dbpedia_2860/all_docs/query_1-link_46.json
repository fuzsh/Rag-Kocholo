Their work aims to support semiconductor, IT, and display industries. The publish the English language journal Applied Science and Convergence Technology (ASCT) and the Korean-language journal 진공 이야기 or Vacuum Magazine[1] and hold regular summer and winter conferences. Their six departments include vacuum technology, surface and interface science, semiconductor and thin film, plasma and displays, nanoscience and bio-interface, and energy technology.\n\nApplied Science and Convergence Technology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Society first launched a quarterly journal in 1992 named Journal of the Korean Vacuum Society. From 2006, it was published bimonthly. Eight years later it changed into the online open access journal[2] Applied Science and Convergence Technology[3] and comes out six times a year.[4]\n\nKVS presidents\n\n[edit]\n\nPark Dongsu (1991–1997) KVS cites Park as 1st to 3rd presidency\n\nKim Yeonggi (1997–1999)\n\nU Jongcheon (1999–2001)\n\nLee Sunbo (2001–2003)\n\nSon Gisu (2003–2005)\n\nChung Kwang Hwa (2005–2007)\n\nChoi Chigyu (2007–2009)\n\nLee Jihwa (2009–2011)\n\nBak Jongyun (2011–2013)\n\nNoh Samgyu (2013–2015)\n\nKang Huijae (2015–2017)\n\nKim Eungyu (2017–2019)\n\nYeom Geunyeong (2019–2021)\n\nChoi Eunha (2021–2023)\n\nBu Jinhyo (2023–current)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican Vacuum Society\n\nInternational Union for Vacuum Science, Technique and Applications\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
