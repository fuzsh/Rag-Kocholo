        "text": "CERN's origins can be traced to the 1940s\n\nA small number of visionary scientists in Europe and North America identified the need for Europe to have a world-class physics research facility. Their vision was both to stop the brain drain to America that had begun during the Second World War, and to provide a force for unity in post-war Europe.\n\nToday, CERN unites scientists from around the world in the pursuit of knowledge"
