In Sec. II, “Early Years of Atomic Layer Processes” in the original article,1 the first two sentences of the fourth paragraph should instead say “The ALD principle, where surface reactions follow a binary sequence of self-limiting half-reactions, was reported under the name ‘molecular layering’ in the 1960s by S. I. Kol’tsov from Leningrad Technological Institute.2–6 These experiments were conducted under the scientific supervision of V. B. Aleskovskii. The ‘framework hypothesis,’ an antecedent to molecular layering, was proposed by V. B. Aleskovskii in 1952.6” In addition, again in this same section and paragraph, the last two sentences should instead say “In the 1969 article,3 the authors report that the initial reaction between TiCl4 and Si–OH tends to involve 3 Si–OH, forming one Ti–Cl, whereas after the first water step, the second TiCl4 exposure reacts with 2 Ti–OH, forming Ti–Cl2 groups. In the 1969 paper,3 a planar thin film was not produced or evaluated, although nanolayers were prepared by molecular layering at that time.6” These corrections do not affect other sections or the conclusions drawn in the article.},\n\ndoi = {10.1116/6.0000143},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1616689}, journal = {Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A},\n\nissn = {0734-2101},\n\nnumber = 3,\n\nvolume = 38,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Thu Mar 12 00:00:00 EDT 2020},\n\nmonth = {Thu Mar 12 00:00:00 EDT 2020}\n\n}"
