        "text": "AVS: Science and Technology of Materials, Interfaces, and Processing[3] (formerly American Vacuum Society[4]) is a not-for-profit learned society founded in 1953 focused on disciplines related to materials, interfaces, and processing. AVS has approximately 4500 members worldwide from academia, governmental laboratories and industry.\n\nAVS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics.[3] AVS publishes through the American Institute of Physics the journals Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology (JVST A and B) and Biointerphases, which are devoted to peer-reviewed articles, and Surface Science Spectra (SSS), which publishes peer-reviewed articles with reference spectra of technological and scientific interest. In 2019 American Institute of Physics and AVS launched jointly a new journal, AVS Quantum Science.[5]\n\nOrganization\n\n[edit]\n\nAVS is composed of 10 technical divisions, two technical groups, 16 regional chapters, two international chapters and one international affiliate:\n\nAdvanced Surface Engineering Division[6]\n\nApplied Surface Science Division[7]\n\nBiomaterial Interfaces Division[8]\n\nElectronic Materials/Photonics Division[9]\n\nMagnetic Interfaces and Nanostructures Division[10]\n\nNanometer-Scale Science and Technology Division\n\nPlasma Science and Technology Division[11]\n\nSurface Science Division[12]\n\nThin Film Division (TF)[13]\n\nVacuum Technology Division[14]\n\nAVS Technical Groups Division\n\nManufacturing Science & Technology Technical Group (MSTG)\n\nMEMS and NEMS Technical Group\n\nConferences\n\n[edit]\n\nThe AVS International Symposium and Exhibition is AVS's flagship conference. The symposium addresses cutting-edge issues associated with materials, processing, and interfaces in the research and manufacturing communities. AVS also sponsors a variety of topical conferences, including the International Conference on Atomic Layer Deposition and the North American Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy.\n\nAVS professional awards\n\n[edit]\n\nDorothy Hoffman Award[15]\n\nMedard W. Welch Award\n\nJohn A. Thornton Memorial Award & Lecture\n\nAVS graduate student awards\n\n[edit]\n\nRussell and Sigurd Varian Award\n\nDorothy M. and Earl S. Hoffman Award\n\nNellie Yeoh Whetten Award\n\nDorothy M. and Earl S. Hoffman Scholarship\n\nGraduate Research Award (GRA)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nAVS web site\n\nArchival collections\n\n[edit]"
