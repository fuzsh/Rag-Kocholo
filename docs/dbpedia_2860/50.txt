Pioneers in Vacuum Science

On Display in the Glass Case:

"New experiments and observations touching cold" by Robert Boyle (London, 1683).

Recherches sur les modifications de l'atomosphere by DeLuc, J.A. Chez la Veuve Duchesne, Libraire St.-Jacques, (Paris, 1784).**

Studien uber dampfspannkraftsmessungen , by Kahlbaum, George W.A (in german), Benno Schwabe's Verlag, (Basel, 1893).

"Traitez de l'equilibre des liqueurs, et de la pesanteur de la masse de l'air" by Blaise Pascal (Paris, 1654). Blaise Pascal was a renowned mathematician, known for his contributions in number theory, geometry, and the theory of probability. In this volume Pascal explains his theory on pressure and presents an outline of a hydrostatic system.

"The philosophical works of the Honourable Robert Boyle Esq" (London, 1725) Robert Boyle was a chemist and natural philosopher. Not only was he known for his theories regarding experimentation but also for his experimental practices. He developed the vacuum pump and helped to found the Royal Society of London, but is best known for Boyle's Law - the pressure of a confined quantity of gas varies inversely with its volume.

"Technica curiosa sive mirabilis artis" by Gaspar Schott (Nuremberg, 1687)

Gaspar Schott was a professor of mathematics. This work popularized the scientific discoveries of Boyle and von Guericke.
