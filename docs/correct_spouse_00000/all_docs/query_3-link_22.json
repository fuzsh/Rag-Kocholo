        "text": "Reports suggest that the tensions first arose between the pair during the filming of their award-winning movie Revolutionary Road\n\nAfter announcing their separation yesterday, friends of Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes claim that their marriage first hit the rocks during the filming of Revolutionary Road.\n\nMendes directed his wife in the award-winning movie opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, which was about a couple going through a stormy break-up.\n\nDuring the promotion of the film last year, Kate admitted that she'd found it awkward being directed by her husband - particularly during sex scenes with her former Titanic co-star.\n\nSEE KATE & SAM'S BEST MOMENTS HERE\n\n'I just kept saying, \"This is too weird,\"' she said in an interview last year. 'Leo told me to get over it, but I said, \"You're my best friend and he's my husband. This is definitely a bit weird.\"'\n\nKate and Sam, who were married back in 2003, reportedly split earlier during the year, but released a joint statement yesterday, confirming the separation.\n\n'The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement,' it read. 'Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children.'\n\nRumours began circulating that all was not well within the marriage, when Kate attended both the BAFTAs and the Oscars without her director husband.\n\nA friend of the actress has said that she now plans to divorce Mendes, saying: 'That's it, it is final.'\n\n'Kate is devastated. She thought their marriage was forever, and now she has two children from two marriages and both are not living with their fathers.'\n\nKate is currently in Mexico with her two children, Joe, six and Mia, nine, who was from her previous marriage to assistant director Jim Threapleton.\n\nSam Mendes is currently in the US, where he is working on a couple of Shakespeare theatre productions.\n\n'He became bored working on his latest theatrical project and he took that boredom home with him,' says a source close to the director.\n\n'That led to the spark being taken out of their marriage.'\n\nKATE WINSLET & SAM MENDES: BEST MOMENTS"
