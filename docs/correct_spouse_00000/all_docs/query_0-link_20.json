        "text": "Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet has split from her film director husband Sam Mendes, a British law firm said Monday.\n\nThe 34-year-old star separated from Mendes at an unspecified point earlier this year, Shillings law firm said. It wasn't clear whether divorce proceedings have begun. The pair have been married since 2003 and have two children.\n\nIn a statement e-mailed to journalists, the law firm said the split was \"entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement.\"\n\ndirector Burton\n\nAmerican movie director Tim Burton has been inducted into France's cultural honor roll in a Paris ceremony.\n\nCulture Minister Frederic Mitterand made the director of such films as \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Edward Scissorhands\" an officer in France's National Order of Arts and Letters.\n\nBurton, wearing a dark suit and his trademark fuzzy hairdo, says he has always loved France and felt a special connection with the French public.\n\nThe man convicted of stalking ESPN reporter Erin Andrews and shooting nude videos of her through a hotel room peephole was to be sentenced yesterday in Los Angeles.\n\nMichael Barrett, a 48-year-old Chicago-area insurance executive, has pleaded guilty to interstate stalking and agreed to a 27-month prison sentence. Barrett is suspected of renting hotel rooms adjacent to Andrews in three cities in 2008, including Milwaukee. Andrews was expected to address the court after the hearing.\n\nThe Associated Press"
