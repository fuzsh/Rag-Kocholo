        "text": "WASHINGTON – Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet married Ned RocknRoll, nephew of Virgin Atlantic mogul Richard Branson, her publicist confirmed to Reuters .\n\nThe 37-year-old bride married in a small secret ceremony in a converted New York barn. Leonardo DiCaprio, Winslet’s “Titantic” costar gave the bride away, according to British newspaper, The Sun. The groom Ned RocknRoll, 34, legally changed his name from Abel Smith. He works for his uncle, Branson.\n\nWill the third time be a charm? Winslet and first husband, Jim Threapleton, separated in 2001. They have a daughter Mia together. Two years later, she married Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes. They have a son, Joe, together. The couple split in 2010.\n\nRocknRoll married heiress Eliza Pearson in 2009 but they divorced short of two years later.\n\nThere has been no word if Winslet will take her husband’s name and now become Kate RocknRoll.\n\n(Copyright 2012 by WTOP.
