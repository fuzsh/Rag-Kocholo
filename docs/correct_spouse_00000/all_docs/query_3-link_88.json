        "text": "Revolutionary Road is a novel by Richard Yates set in 1955 and based on Franck and April Wheeler’s life. They live in a Connecticut suburb and try to struggle against their personal problems. But they desire for a better life will represent the decline of the American dream. We watched in class the movie directed by Sam Mendes. I really appreciated it and I found the relationship between April and Franck interesting but above all greatly interpreted by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio who come back together on-screen after Titanic.\n\nI’m going to talk about the relationship between the Wheeler’s, about their love story which is the threat of the story. They share a special relationship which is based most of the time on fighting.\n\nThe communication between them goes wrong even if they try to remedy it. When they meet at the beginning April is studying to be an actress while he is a longshoremen. She wants to become an actress but her last representation is a disaster. She is totally inconsolable. As if all her dreams had disappeared . She doesn’t want be a housewife all her life. She is an unconventional woman. That’s why she can’t imagine herself spending her life looking after children and staying at home waiting for Franck to be back as most of women did in the 50’s. So April suggest Franck to go to Paris. She wants to take control of their simple life, as an actress she plays a part in her couple. April is ready to work and offer Franck to stay at home when they’ll be in Paris. Somehow she is trying to save her marriage from boredom. By sharing this idea with Franck it’s like an illumination, she is very enthusiastic. Both don’t really appreciate their life. Franck hates his job and April has a life that she never wanted before. She can’t bear her suburban life. The only way out for them is to start a new life, in another country to live something different from that they are living now. But when she announces to Franck that shi is pregnant, he doesn’t want to go to Paris any more. For April it is a second deception, her husband has broken her one left dream to become someone else and to realize herself. Their vision of life becomes different. While Franck prefers material gain, alcohol and cigarettes, his wife is willing to abandon everything to start a new life. They both embody a social role and they are struggling against boredom but not in the same manner."
