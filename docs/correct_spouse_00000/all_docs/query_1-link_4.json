        "text": "Winslet, 34, and Mendes, 44, seemed such a perfect couple. The down-to-earth actress and her cricket-mad director husband, both born in Reading, seemed just like us, albeit with a lot more talent and glamour, and with a brace of Oscars between them. With one in three marriages ending in divorce these days, maybe that's the problem. As Winslet's character in the 2008 film Revolutionary Road — the story of a marriage break-up which was the couple's first professional collaboration — put it: \"We're normal, aren't we? We're just like other people.\"\n\nLast night, a spokesman for London-based law firm Schillings announced that the couple, who met in 2001 and married in 2003, \"are saddened to announce that they separated earlier this year\". The split, the statement continued, is \"entirely amicable and by mutual consent\". The couple remain \"fully committed to the joint parenting of their children\" — their six-year-old son Joe and Winslet's nine-year-old daughter Mia, by her first husband, Jim Threapleton.\n\nIt has been suggested that Winslet now plans to divorce Mendes but that both parties wish to avoid an unseemly battle over their estimated £30 million fortune, for the sake of their children. Before the statement was released, Winslet flew to Mexico for a holiday with Mia and Joe. Mendes was spotted alone in London last week at the premiere of London Assurance at the National Theatre. He is now back in New York, where his productions of Shakespeare's The Tempest and As You Like It, with his transatlantic theatre company The Bridge Project, finished their run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Saturday. He has reportedly moved into an apartment underneath the family's Manhattan triplex.\n\nWinslet and Mendes have not been seen in public together since an appearance at Wimbledon last summer. Winslet attended this year's Bafta and Oscar ceremonies alone, claiming that Mendes was \"babysitting\" at home. In February, Winslet hosted a pre-Bafta party for Harper's Bazaar magazine and Lancôme, for whom she is the current \"face\". Usually voluble in interviews and awards speeches about her affection for Mendes and the details of her personal life — including the weight issues which resulted in her being bullied at school, and which she has continued to face in size-conscious Hollywood — she was on this occasion unusually circumspect, talking only about work, her encounters with the media rigidly policed by a publicist.\n\nMendes, too, was a talkative public figure when he first burst onto the scene as a talented theatre director. He was friendly with the media in his early years running the Donmar Warehouse, and on his first forays in Hollywood with American Beauty (for which he won an Oscar) and Road to Perdition. He has, however, always kept quiet about his private life, despite enjoying long relationships with the glamorous likes of Rachel Weisz, Jane Horrocks and Calista Flockhart. In recent years, he has become less keen on publicity, giving few interviews even to promote his film Away We Go last year, or his stage productions with The Bridge Project.\n\nThere are hints that the marriage was already over in January, and on the rocks as long ago as last year. Some have noted that Winslet neglected to thank her husband for his support when she won the Bafta award for The Reader last year, although she made up for it at the Oscars, when The Reader finally won her the coveted statuette after five previous nominations. \"I am so lucky to have a wonderful husband and two beautiful children who let me do what I love and who love me just the way that I am,\" she declared from the podium.\n\nWinslet admitted then that it was \"too weird\" having her husband direct her in intense sex scenes with DiCaprio. Mendes said the film had shown him a side of his wife he had not known: \"We are very happy but obviously there is a cathartic aspect of making a movie about a bad marriage,\" he said at the time. \"When she's acting she looks like my Kate — her face is no different, she's not wearing prosthetics and there's no ageing or anything like that — but she is just a different person. I didn't see her on the set — I just saw the character she was playing. It was remarkable.\" Mendes \"identified\" with the pressures on the fictional couple and found it \"cathartic\" to anatomise a marriage break-up. He also acknowledged that their different ways of working put a strain on their own relationship. \"I tend to be very focused when I'm working, then I switch off completely,\" he said. \"And Kate, when she comes home from work, wants to talk.\" He jokingly grumbled he'd been forced to forgo watching the cricket highlights on Sky Sports in order to hash over the emotional rollercoaster of the day's filming.\n\nTheir first public appearance together was at the premiere of Mendes's film The Road to Perdition in 2002. They married in Anguilla in 2003 when Winslet was already pregnant with their son Joe. The wedding was low-key, with a few friends in attendance, an echo of Winslet's \"ordinary\" wedding to Threapleton, where guests were served bangers and mash. Up until then, Mendes had been a self-confessed workaholic. \"I don't think I had supper at home for four years,\" he said. But after Joe was born in December, Mendes took it easy, devoting himself to his son in his baby years and directing only one film, Jarhead, and one play, David Hare's The Vertical Hour, on Broadway.\n\nIn the last three years, though, both Winslet and Mendes began working ferociously hard yet again, which paid dividends in critical plaudits and awards but may have put their marriage under strain. After The Reader and Revolutionary Road, Winslet seemed to put her career briefly on hold for a year — there have been no big film roles to capitalise on her Oscar success, though she is shortly due to play Mildred Pierce in a television remake of the famous Joan Crawford movie. But Mendes was as busy as ever. In addition to Away We Go and the Bridge Project, he is widely expected to direct the next film in the Bond franchise, a time- and attention-consuming juggernaut.\n\nDid he choose work over Winslet? It is unlikely we will get a decisive answer from the circumspect Mendes's lips. He will probably regard it as ungentlemanly ever to comment on the end of his marriage. Given Winslet's engaging honesty, it's more likely we'll eventually hear the truth from her. But I'd be willing to bet it will be couched in terms of regret rather than recrimination, of sorrow rather than blame. Winslet and Mendes are both decent, dignified people. That's why no one is crowing over the end of their glamorous, gilded relationship. For us, as for them, it's just too sad."
