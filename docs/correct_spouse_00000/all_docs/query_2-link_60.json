        "text": "If you're rich and famous, sometimes surviving a hurricane hell-fire on a private island can lead to true love. Such was the case with Kate Winslet and the amazingly named Ned Rock'nRoll. According to Winslet's rep, the couple were married earlier this month in a secret ceremony in New York. Completing the bizarre, disaster-born romance, the bride was given away by none other than Leonardo DiCaprio, her Titanic co-star.\n\n\"I can confirm that Kate Winslet married Ned Rock'nRoll in NY earlier this month in a private ceremony attended by her two children and a very few friends and family,\" the rep says. \"The couple had been engaged since the summer.\"\n\nThe groom, n√©e Ned Abel Smith, is the nephew of billionaire Richard Branson, who owned the private island from which Winslet and Rock'nRoll narrowly escaped last fall. Rock'nRoll also works at Virgin Galactic (thanks Uncle Richard) as the \"Head of Marketing Promotion and Astronaut Experience,\" which, as you might guess from a guy who legally changed his last name to Rock'nRoll, is an entirely made up job title.\n\nIt's the third marriage for Winslet (she divorced Jim Threapleton in 2001 and Sam Mendes in 2010), and the second for Rocknroll (he was previously married to \"British socialite Eliza Pearson, the daughter of a multimillionaire viscount.\")\n\n[Photo via Getty]"
