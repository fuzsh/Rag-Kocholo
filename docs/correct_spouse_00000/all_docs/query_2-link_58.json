        "text": "Titanic star Kate Winslet and husband Sam Mendes announced yesterday that their marriage has hit an iceberg – but the cracks first appeared two years ago.\n\nThe British couple, who married in 2003, released a joint statement yesterday claiming their split was “amicable and mutual”. But the Mirror can reveal they had a trial separation last year after falling out during filming of 2008 movie Revolutionary Road, which he directed and she starred in.\n\nA source said: “Working and living together was incredibly intense and it basically overwhelmed their ­relationship.\n\n“The pair have a very different work ethos. Whereas Sam wanted to switch off after a long day, Kate liked to analyse every nuance of her performance. It was just too much.”\n\nThe problem got worse when Sam was subsequently away in Florida, Connecticut and Arizona while filming Away We Go and suddenly spent a lot of time separated from Kate, 34, and ­children Joe and Mia.\n\nThe source added: “After being in each other’s pockets for so long, this, ironically, also proved really difficult.\n\n“So last year they both made a ­commitment to spend the year together and do less work. But it actually ended up with them both going a bit stir crazy.\n\n“They are both really driven and were arguing more than ever before.\n\n“Kate even did a really small amount of filming towards the end of the year just to try and release some of the pressure and tension that had built up between them. But in the early new year they gradually realised their marriage was on its last legs.\n\n“They had a series of rows over projects this year and that was the straw which broke the camel’s back. They are both devastated but want to stay on good terms for the sake of the kids.”\n\nThe Mirror was aware of the imminent split two months ago. But when we rang the couple’s publicist on January 11 our claims were furiously rebuffed.\n\nBut yesterday the pair’s legal spokesman said: “Kate and Sam are saddened to announce that they separated earlier this year.\n\n“The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement.\n\n“Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children.” Their split comes eight months after the couple were last pictured together, setting off for a family holiday in Italy.\n\nSam, 44, was notably absent from his wife’s side at the Golden Globes this year. The one-time golden couple of Hollywood, have one child together, Joe, six. Mia is from Kate’s first marriage to assistant director Jim ­Threapleton.\n\nShortly after filming Revolutionary Road, which was nominated for three Oscars, Sam said: “I tend to cut off at the end of the day and watch a baseball game or something. I don’t like to bring work home. But Kate is the opposite. She did want to talk about it all the time, 24 hours a day.”\n\nKate won a Golden Globe for her role in Revolutionary Road as a frustrated housewife living in 1950s America. In her acceptance speech she thanked Sam.\n\nShe said: “Thank you for directing this film, babe, and thank you for killing us every single day and really enjoying us actually being in such horrific pain.\n\n“But I can honestly say with my hand on my heart that I loved every second of working with you and it’s made me love you more.”\n\nSam, tipped to direct the next Bond movie, dated actresses Jane Horrocks and Rachel Weisz before marrying Kate in a private Caribbean ceremony.\n\nKate Winslet\n\nFirst makes a name for herself in 1993 in Heavenly Creatures\n\nEarns a Bafta and Oscar nomination in 1996 for Sense and Sensibility\n\nBecomes international star playing Rose Dawson in Titanic in 1997. James Cameron’s hit won 11 Oscars\n\nWins first Academy Award in 2009 for The Reader after five unsuccessful nominations, including for Iris and Little Children\n\nSam Mendes\n\nStudied English at Cambridge University, where he first directed plays, before finding work at the Chichester Festival Theatre\n\nWon a Critic Circle Award for Best Newcomer after directing Judi Dench in The Cherry Orchard\n\nAt 27 he became the artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse in London\n\nIn 1999 he directed his first film, American Beauty. A huge success, it won five Academy Awards"
