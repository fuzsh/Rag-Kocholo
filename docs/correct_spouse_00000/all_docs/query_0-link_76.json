        "text": "FURIOUS Kate Winslet rowed with husband Sam Mendes over his friendship with a young actress.\n\nDirector Mendes, 44, got close to Rebecca Hall, 27, after casting her in two of his plays.\n\nFriends said his arguments with Titanic star Winslet, 34, over Rebecca was \"one of the factors\" that led to the end of their six-year marriage.\n\nA source said: \"Sam is a huge admirer of Rebecca's work.\n\n\"He can be quite a lovey at times and really worked well with her, which would obviously wind Kate up.\n\n\"The gossip backstage was that Rebecca was the iceberg that sunk the ship.\n\n\"But it was only one of a number of factors.\n\n\"There's no suggestion of anything untoward but undoubtedly the friendship didn't help mend the struggling marriage.\"\n\nOscar-winner Mendes cast Rebecca, 27, in The Cherry Orchard last year and later in The Winter's Tale. They have enjoyed several nights out together in New York.\n\nWinslet and Mendes announced their separation on Monday.\n\nTheir relationship started going downhill two years ago, with their fights becoming so bad they ended up screaming at one another in the street.\n\nIt emerged last night that Winslet finally decided to end the marriage in a fight over their clashing work timetables.\n\nMendes is set to direct the new James Bond movie and pleaded with Kate to quit New York and return to England with him during filming.\n\nBut she signed up to do a TV comedy in America.\n\nA source said: \"Sam raised several questions over whether she should be doing it, insisting she was above a TV script.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, Kate went ballistic.\"\n\nWinslet and Mendes have a six-year-old son, Joe, together. Kate also has Mia, nine, from her first marriage to British director Jim Threapleton."
