        "text": "The brief announcement was made on Monday by Keith Schilling of the couple’s London lawyers, Schillings.\n\n“Kate and Sam are saddened to announce that they separated earlier this year,” said the statement. “The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement. Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children.”\n\nWinslet and Mendes met in 2001, when he approached her to appear in a play at London’s Donmar Warehouse theatre, of which he was then artistic director.\n\nThey married in May 2003 on the Caribbean island of Anguilla. Their son, Joe, was born seven months later.\n\n“There really is no story,” she added, confirming that the separation is “perfectly amicable”.\n\nWinslet, 34, is most famous for starring opposite Leonardo di Caprio in the 1997 James Cameron blockbuster Titanic, and has also appeared in Little Children, Iris and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\n\nShe has been nominated for an Oscar on five occasions, and finally won the award for best actress last year for The Reader, in which she starred opposite Ralph Fiennes.\n\nMendes, 44, was a respected theatre director in London but made his name internationally - and won his own Oscar - by directing Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening in American Beauty in 1999.\n\nHe went on to direct the critically acclaimed Road to Perdition and the less well-received Jarhead.\n\nIronically the only film on which the couple have worked together was Revolutionary Road in 2008, which Mendes directed and in which Winslet starred as a woman whose seven-year long marriage was breaking up.\n\nAt the time, Mendes said that he was interested in depicting the pivotal point in a marriage “when you have to throw in your towel and say, ‘This is actually my life. What happens when you think you’ve done it wrong?'\"\n\nWinslet won the Golden Globe award for best actress in a drama for the film.\n\n“Thank you for directing this film, babe, and thank you for killing us every single day and really enjoying us actually being in such horrific pain,” she said to Mendes in her acceptance speech. “But I can honestly say with my hand on my heart that I loved every second of working with you and it’s made me love you more.”\n\nWinslet’s marriage to Mendes was her second. She married assistant director Jim Threapleton in 1998, having met him on the set of her film Hideous Kinky. They have a daughter, Mia Honey, who is now nine, but divorced in 2001.\n\nWhen Mendes and Winslet were first married, they were famed for the effusiveness of their affection.\n\nLast year, it emerged that the pair never travelled on the same plane for fear of leaving their children orphaned if it were to crash."
