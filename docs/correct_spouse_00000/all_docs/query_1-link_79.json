        "text": "Kate Winslet is twice divorced but you're not likely to hear the \"Titanic\" star talk about what went wrong in either marriage.\n\nThere's a reason for that. In a new interview with the WSJ. Magazine, the 39-year-old Oscar winner said she made a concerted effort to keep the details of her personal life under wraps when she divorced director Jim Threapleton in 2001 and \"American Beauty\" director Sam Mendes in 2010. (She married third husband Ned Rocknroll in 2012.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“No one really knows what has happened in my life,\" she told the magazine. \"No one really knows why my first marriage didn’t last; no one knows why my second didn’t. And I’m proud of those silences.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWinslet, who has a child from each of her marriages, also discussed how she's dealt with public interest in her marital setbacks.\n\n“I know lots of people who are not in the public eye who have gone through several marriages, I really do, and it’s just those are the cards that life dealt me,\" she said. \"I didn’t plan on its being that way . And f-- me, it hasn’t been easy, you know.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWinslet may try to keep her private life private, but she couldn't help but rave about third husband Rocknroll -- the nephew of Virgin magnate Richard Branson.\n\n“Thank God for Ned -- really. He’s just so incredibly supportive, and he’s so much fun. He’s absolutely everything to me. And to all of us.\"\n\nIn an interview with Harper's Bazaar U.K. back in 2013, Winslet called Rocknroll -- who was born Edward Abel Smith before legally changing his name -- her \"soulmate.\""
