        "text": "It should be one of the most brilliant days in an actresses' life but a string of film stars have discovered that heartbreak follows the acclamation.\n\nWinslet, 34 accepted the Best Actress gong for The Reader last year she made no mention of Mendes, 44, who won an Oscar for his direction of American Beauty in 1999. She had only a month earlier praised Mendes to the hilt when she won a Golden Globe for Revoluionary Road, which is being reported as the beginning of the end of their relationship.\n\n\"Thank you for directing this film, babe, and thank you for killing us every single day and really enjoying us actually being in such horrific pain,\" she said. \"But I can honestly say with my hand on my heart that I loved every second of working with you and it's made me love you more.\"\n\nBut she is the latest in a line of actresses to lose their partner or husband afterwards.\n\nReese Witherspoon, who won the Best Acress oscar for Walk The Line in March 2006.\n\n\"I want to say thank you to my wonderful husband.\"\n\nShe divorced her husband and father of her children Ryan Phillippe 19 months later.\n\nHilary Swank's marriage to actor Chad Lowe survived her first Oscar for Boys Don't Cry - she failed to mention him in her speech - but not the second when she accepted the Best Actress award for Million Dollar Babe in February 2005.\n\n\"I am going to start by thanking my husband because I'd like to think I've learned from past mistakes. Chad, you're my everything - thank you for your support. It means the world.\"\n\nThey announced their seperation in January 2006.\n\nCharlize Theron split with her long-term partner, actor Stuart Townsend, almost six years after she picked up the Best Actress trophy for her role as a serial killer in Monster in February 2004.\n\n\"I have to thank my incredible partner in crime. You are one hell of a partner to have. Thank you so much for standing by me.\"\n\nIn March 2002, Halle Berry made history by becoming the first black star to win the Best Actress Oscar for Monsters Ball.\n\n\"My husband, who is the joy of my life, and India - thank you for giving me peace.\"\n\nIn October 2003. she split with her singer husband Eric Benet.\n\nIn March 1998, Helen Hunt won the Best Actress Oscar for As Good As It Gets and thanked her partner Hank Azaria, most famous for his voice work in The Simpsons.\n\n\"The very best man I know.\"\n\nThey married the following year but in June 2000 Hank moved out of the marital home. Hunt filed for divorce citing \"irreconcilable differences\" six months later.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow thanked \"my friend Ben Affleck\" when she was awarded Best Actress for her role in Shakespeare In Love in March 1999. She broke-up with the actor two months later.\n\nJulia Roberts turned up to the 2001 Oscars with partner Benjamin Bratt and won Best Actress for Erin Brockovich. She simply thanked him and they broke up three months later.\n\nHopefully Sandra Bullock's not superstitious."
