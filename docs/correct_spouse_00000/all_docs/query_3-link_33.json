        "text": "Hollywood-watchers were shocked by the news that Academy Award-winning couple Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes had split up. The actress and her husband of six years, director Sam Mendes (\"American Beauty\") are said to have been broken up since \"an unspecified point\" earlier this year. A UK law firm emailed a statement to reporters this morning saying that the two split earlier this year and that the breakup is \"entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement.\"\n\nWinslet and Mendes were considered one of Hollywood's more stable unions, and much was made of Mendes directing Winslet and her \"Titanic\" co-star Leonardo DiCaprio in love scenes in 2008's \"Revolutionary Road.\" In perhaps a foreshadowing of Winslet's offscreen life, the movie detailed the breakdown of a marriage.\n\nA question some may be asking is: Are stars not immune from the unwritten rule that workplace relationships are often doomed to failure? Two of Kate's past relationships also began as a working relationships: She had a five-year romance with fellow \"Dark Season\" actor, Stephen Tredre, and later married director Jim Threapleton, with whom she worked on the movie \"Hideous Kinky.\" Tredre ended the relationship because he was dying of cancer and \"didn't want to hold her back from pursuing her acting career;\" the latter ended in 2001, the same year Winslet met Mendes.\n\nIt could be that the pressures of high-stress jobs combined with too much time apart that led to the demise of Mendes and Winslet's union. According to the law firm that announced the separation, \"Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children.\" Winslet is set to begin production on her next project, the five-hour HBO Miniseries \"Mildred Pierce,\" in early April.\n\nWinslet hasn't hesitated to discuss the joys and challenges of her marriage in interviews over the years, telling Elle Magazine in January of 2009 \"You have to work at a marriage. The best things always involve some effort.\" Winslet went on to describe her efforts at keeping the love alive with Mendes: \"Sometimes it's just about getting out of the house. We do loads of lovely meals with the kids, but every now and again you need to get out of the house together, go and be a couple, have a laugh.\"\n\nWinslet and Mendes met at a business meeting in 2001, and married in a private, secret ceremony on the island of Anguilla in the Caribbean in May of 2003. Winslet had a daughter, Mia, from her previous marriage to actor/writer/director James Threapleton, and Mendes and Winslet had a son together, Joe, in 2003. The couple and their children divided their time between homes in New York City, where Mendes just finished directing Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" and \"The Tempest\" last week, and England, where they have a country manor in Glouchestershire."
