        "text": "Quietly, carefully, almost stealthily, a guy named Sam Mendes has become one of the best directors in the movie business today. He makes brooding, introspective films about deep, rich characters, and he forgoes a lot of the pomp and circumstance one often finds in high-end dramas. He also has a dark sense of humor.\n\nOne of his best qualities as a filmmaker is that although his films bear a similar thematic hallmark, no two of them are alike.\n\nHis newest effort is called \"Revolutionary Road.\" It reunited \"Titanic\" stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in a love story far more complex and emotionally resonant than the movie about the sinking boat.\n\nThis time around they are Frank and April Wheeler, a young suburban couple raising two kids in the 1950s and dealing with the fact that the American Dream of the nuclear family ends up being surprisingly empty and hopeless. Frank works a job he hates, begrudgingly sloughing through the rat race to support his white picket fence. April feels trapped in their cute house and chained to the kids she loves ... sort of.\n\nPerhaps they were once in love, but now they are firmly locked into a love/hate marriage, punctuated with brutal arguments and fueled by their overwhelming disappointment with how normal they turned out to be.\n\nThey hatch a wild and whimsical escape plan - pick up and move to Paris where she can work as a secretary and he can just lounge about, reading and getting to know himself. The Wheeler's friends react with disbelief and contempt, but the couple feels rejuvenated and in love all over again.\n\nAnd then (you just knew there was an 'and then' coming, didn't you?) life throws some twists and turns at them, and their rekindled love turns into a ferociously rekindled love/hate.\n\nAs you might have surmised, \"Revolutionary Road\" is not a feel-good type of movie. It isn't a lot of fun to watch a married couple fighting (especially if you are a married couple prone to fighting or live next door to one) but the arguments are intense, interesting and emotionally moving.\n\nDirector Mendes brings 1950s suburbia to life, but the actors and actresses really make the material work. DiCaprio and Winslet are both excellent, strong and sympathetic. And a roster of terrific supporting players includes Kathy Bates, Kathryn Hahn, Dylan Baker and in particular an actor named Michael Shannon, who steals every scene he is in as a man who is labeled as insane, but may be the sanest man in the picture. Seriously, Shannon is the high point of the movie, which is saying something about a movie this good.\n\nMendes has a history of making movies about the American Dream being turned on its ear. \"Revolutionary Road\" is the latest but it all started with Mendes' first feature film and his most famous movie, \"American Beauty.\"\n\nKevin Spacey stars in one of his most iconic roles as Lester Burnham, a man bored to death with his suburban life. So he decides to live the life he's always wanted - he blackmails his boss, starts smoking a lot of pot and lusts after a high school cheerleader. It is the mother of all mid-life crises.\n\n\"American Beauty\" isn't just about Lester but also his troubled daughter (Thora Birch), his castrating shrew wife (Annette Bening) and the brooding boy next door (Wes Bentley) who makes documentaries and sells Lester pot. There isn't a story, just a group of interesting characters all acting and reacting, and what emerges is one of the most compelling looks at American life in the last decade. It alternates between touching drama and sardonic dark humor flawlessly.\n\n\"Road to Perdition\" is a violent gangster movie, but moreover it's a look at non-traditional parenting. Tom Hanks stars as a family man with allegiances to two different families - on one hand he has a loving wife and children, on the other an Irish crime syndicate led by Paul Newman. When the two families clash, his home life is shattered, and Hanks is forced to take his last remaining son on the run. Now the hitman is also a single dad, caring for a child while trying to wage war against the mobsters who seek to wipe him out.\n\nIn the hands of a lesser director, \"Road to Perdition\" would have been just another shoot-'em-up action flick, but Mendes brings great depth to the film, both visually and thematically. There is some action in the movie, but the focus is on the father/son relationship and how it brings strength to both of them even in the most dire of circumstances.\n\nThe cast also is top-notch, with Hanks being backed by Newman, Daniel Craig, Cirian Hines and Jude Law.\n\n\"Jarhead\" is a non-traditional movie about a non-traditional soldier in a non-traditional war. Jake Gyllenhaal is a young man from a military family who signs up with the Marines apparently just to see what it's like. When a drill sergeant is beating him mercilessly and asking why he joined the beloved Corps, Gyllenhaal, a witty, cynical smartmouth by nature, answers \"I got lost on the way to college SIR!\"\n\nHe is sent to Kuwait as a sniper, circa Gulf War I, where combat life isn't exactly what he expected. He and his Marine brothers play gas-mask football, trek endlessly through the sand on training drills and discuss the political ramifications of why they are in Kuwait. These Jarheads aren't your stereotypical Jarheads; many of them are thoughtful, and one of them is even against the war in which he is fighting.\n\n\"Jarhead\" was roundly criticized because there is very little war for it being a \"war movie.\" But that is exactly the point. Just as Mendes loves to subvert the idea of the traditional American Dream, here he subverts the idea of the usual war movie. He is in love with smart characters who observe and dissect the world around them. This movie doesn't grandstand with an anti-war sentiment, it simply shows us that all wars aren't the same, and that all fighting men aren't quite how we picture them.\n\n\"Revolutionary Road\" – Rent it \"American Beauty\" – Buy it \"Road to Perdition\" – Buy it \"Jarhead\" – Rent it\n\nNATE RATES IT"
