        "text": "The cat’s out of the bag: Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet was secretly married earlier this month to boyfriend Ned Rocknroll, 34.\n\nA British rep for the actress confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that the 37-year-old actress and 34-year-old nephew of Virgin Airlines founder Richard Branson had indeed been married.The service is said to have been kept so under wraps that even Winslet’s parents weren’t aware she was walking down the aisle for the third time. Her rep told THR that that the actress “wed Rocknroll in a private ceremony attended by her two children and a very few friends. The couple had been engaged since the summer.”\n\nSTORY: ‘Titanic 3D’ London Premiere Features Kate Winslet, James Cameron\n\nWinslet’s father, Roger, and Ned’s father, Robert, had no clue about the undercover nuptials, according to British media reports. Rocknroll’s father told the Sun: “It’s not something I know of — but nothing would surprise me with those two.”\n\nWinslet’s Titanic and Revolutionary Road costar Leonardo DiCaprio reportedly walked her down the aisle.\n\nWinslet has a bit of a history of secret marriages. She wed Sam Mendes, her second husband and father of her son, Joe, in a secret ceremony in 2003. The couple remained married until 2010. Winslet previously wed Jim Threapleton, the father of her daughter, Mia, in 1998 at a church ceremony in Reading, England.\n\nKate met Rocknroll — whose birth name is Abel Smith — shortly after breaking up with her on-off model boyfriend Louis Dowler. At the time the couple met, Rocknroll was separating from his wife, British socialite Eliza Cowdray, whom he wed in 2009.\n\nRocknroll previously had his name legally changed to his current, edgier moniker and now works for the space-travel branch of the Virgin empire, Virgin Galactic.\n\nSTORY: ‘I Am Extremely Grateful For My Butt’ Says Kate Winslet\n\nDespite the new revelation, perhaps we should not be too surprised about Winslet’s wedding. After her second divorce, Kate confessed: “I still believe in the beauty of committing yourself to another person and, at least, in the idea of marriage as an expression of that commitment. Living with someone will always be a challenge, but you hope to be able to find someone whom you can spend the rest of your days.”\n\nAnother marriage portent came in September when Winslet and Rocknroll purchased a 15th-century style home in West Sussex, England."
