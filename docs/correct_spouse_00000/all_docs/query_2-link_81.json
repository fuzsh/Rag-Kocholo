        "text": "ACTRESS Kate Winslet married Edward in 2012 and the couple has one child together.\n\nEdward Abel Smith is the nephew of Richard Branson and a British businessman.\n\nWho is Edward Abel Smith?\n\nEdward Abel Smith was born around 1977 and was working at Virgin Galactic when he met Kate Winslet.\n\nHe is the nephew of British billionaire Richard Branson, owner and founder of Virgin.\n\nAt the time that the pair met, Edward was going by the name Ned Rocknroll.\n\nKate Winslet explained on Jimmy Kimmel's talk show how this name change came about, from his birth name Abel Smith.\n\nShe said: \"As time went by and Ned became Ned — who is quite an original personality — he just decided at one point in his life to just change his name to Rocknroll.\n\n\"Ned Rocknroll. So when I met him, his name was Ned Rocknroll.\n\n\"This is completely true.\"\n\nHe changed his name to Edward Abel Smith when the pair had their son Bear Blaze in 2013.\n\nWhen did Kate Winslet and Edward Abel Smith get married?\n\nWhile on Branson's estate on Necker Island in 2011, Kate and Edward (then Ned) met during a fire.\n\nThe pair married the following year in December 2012 at a private ceremony.\n\nKate was walked down the aisle by Titanic costar and friend Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nThe plans were kept a secret after the pair got engaged in the summer of 2012.\n\nHow many children does Kate Winslet have?\n\nKate and Edward have one child together named Bear Blaze who was born in 2013.\n\nShe also has two other children from previous marriages.\n\nHer eldest is Mia, born in 2000, during her marriage to Jim Threapleton.\n\nShe went on to have a child, Joe, in 2003 with her third husband.\n\nWho are Kate Winslet's ex-husbands?\n\nKate Winslet has been married three times since her relationship with writer-director Stephen Tredre ended in 1995.\n\nShe began dating him when she was just 15 and he was 12 years her senior.\n\nThey remained friends right up to his death in 1997 from bone cancer - in 2008 Kate said she had never gotten over his death.\n\nJim Threapleton\n\nFilm director James Edward Threapleton married Kate Winslet in November 1998.\n\nHe directed Hideous Kinky the same year, which Kate starred in.\n\nThe pair had their daughter Mia together but divorced on December 13, 2001.\n\nKate would later describe the marriage as a mess, saying she had lost control of her instincts.\n\nSam Mendes\n\nAnother director who Kate Winslet married was Oscar winner Sir Sam Mendes.\n\nHe has directed films such as Oliver!, 1917, and the Bond film Skyfall.\n\nThey met when Sam offered Kate a role in a film, which she turned down but they became romantically involved.\n\nKate married Sam on Anguilla island in May 2003 and stayed with him until 2010, amid rumours of an affair with actress Rebecca Hall.\n\nEdward Abel Smith\n\nKate married Edward in 2012 in a secret ceremony, open only to close friends and family.\n\nThey have been together ever since and have one child.\n\nShe told the New York Times: “He looks after us, especially me.\n\n\"I said to him earlier, like, ‘Neddy, could you do something for me?’ He just went, ‘Anything.’\n\n“He is an absolutely extraordinary life partner.”\n\nHe is a stay-at-home dad and they keep their life together very private.\n\nThey live in together in a quiet village in Sussex."
