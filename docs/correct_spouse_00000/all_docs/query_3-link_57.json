        "text": "As an avid reader of “People Magazine”, I am always glad when “People” delivers their stories with a nice chart, simplifying it even more for the ADHD in me. In a continued discussion of the Winslet/Mendes split and Sandy Bullock Drama, I bring you the People chart of marriages and relationships that disintegrated after winning the golden statue.\n\nOnce again the little sum up came from “People Magazine”. So far six broken marriages and no good relationships thanks to Mr. Oscar!\n\nHollywood is known for relationships to grow and then die out of nowhere. This weekend and even in the last hour, two couples have gained my interest.\n\n1. Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas are finally a couple: Jemi\n\nIt’s no surprise that finally the middle JoBro and Lovato have emerged as a couple. It seems their “Camp Rock” romance has struck a chord in real life with them. Isn’t it funny that Selena and Demi are not friends anymore, but are dating in the same family? Selena at the moment is working on her relationship with Nick. Demi has stepped out and confirmed that she is with Joe Jonas during this past weekend. Kevin Jonas however is already taken by Danielle Deleasa a.k.a Mrs. Kevin Jonas II. They married in December 2009. Frankie Jonas is, at the moment, the only single Jonas Brother left.\n\n2. Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes have split: What????\n\nThe lovely and fabulous Kate Winslet has split with her husband of seven years. They have two children, Joe and Mia. Though I am saddened to see them split, I wish them the best of luck in keeping their family together despite their differences."
