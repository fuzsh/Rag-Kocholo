        "text": "British actress Kate Winslet and film director husband Sam Mendes, one of Hollywood's golden couples, have separated, their lawyer said on Monday.\n\n\"Kate and Sam are saddened to announce that they separated earlier this year,\" Keith Schilling of law firm Schillings said in a brief statement.\n\n\"The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement. Both parties are fully to committed to the future joint parenting of their children. They ask that the media respect the privacy of the family,\" he added.\n\nBoth Winslet, 34, and Mendes, 44, are Oscar winners.\n\nWinslet won a best actress Academy Award for her performance in the 2008 movie The Reader, having been nominated for a statuette five times previously.\n\nThe same year Mendes directed his wife in Revolutionary Road, for which she won a Golden Globe.\n\nWinslet is renowned for her acting versatility, appearing in major Hollywood movies and small independent productions which have ranged from comedy to hard-hitting drama.\n\nHer big breakthrough came in 1997 with Titanic, James Cameron's account of the sinking of the passenger liner in which she appeared alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nIt went on to become the biggest grossing movie of all time with global ticket sales of more than $1.8-billion, although it was recently overtaken by Cameron's 3-D epic Avatar.\n\nMendes, also British, was awarded an Oscar as best director for his 1999 film debut American Beauty starring Kevin Spacey. Among his forthcoming projects is expected to be the next, as yet untitled James Bond adventure.\n\nThe couple, who married in 2003, have one child Joe, and Winslet is also mother to Mia from a previous marriage to assistant director Jim Threapleton. They divorced in 2001 after three years together."
