        "text": "British actress Kate Winslet splits from husband\n\nAP – FILE - In this Feb. 22, 2009 file photo, British actress Kate Winslet and her husband, director Sam Mendes …\n\nBy RAPHAEL G. SATTER, Associated Press Writers Raphael G. Satter, Associated Press Writers – 1 min ago\n\nLONDON – Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet has split from her film director husband Sam Mendes, a British law firm said Monday.\n\nThe 34-year-old star separated from Mendes at an unspecified point earlier this year, Shillings law firm said. It wasn't clear whether divorce proceedings have begun. The pair have been married since 2003 and have two children.\n\nIn a statement e-mailed to journalists, the law firm said the split was \"entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement.\"\n\n\"Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children,\" the statement said.\n\nA call and an e-mail seeking further comment were not immediately returned.\n\nWinslet won the Academy Award for best actress for her dramatic role in \"The Reader\" in 2009. It was the first Oscar win for Winslet, who had been nominated five other times for her roles in \"Titanic,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" \"Iris,\" \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" and \"Little Children.\"\n\nMendes, an acclaimed stage and film director, won the coveted best director Oscar for \"American Beauty.\"\n\nHe directed his wife in \"Revolutionary Road,\" a recent film about a crumbling marriage that reunited Winslet with her \"Titanic\" co-star Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nReviews were largely favorable, but the film failed to set off the same box office fever that made \"Titanic\" one of the most successful films in history.\n\nIn \"Revolutionary Road,\" Winslet portrayed a suburban housewife who became increasingly bored and desperate with her stay-at-home life. The film won Winslet a Golden Globe for best dramatic actress, and in her acceptance speech she thanked her husband for pushing her so hard.\n\n\"Thank you for directing this film, babe, and thank you for killing us every single day and really enjoying us actually being in such horrific pain,\" she said last year.\n\nMendes said at the time that directing his wife had been one of the best experiences of his life, although he said she liked to discuss the movie 24 hours a day while he preferred to do something else, like watch a baseball game, at night when work was done.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Gregory Katz contributed to this report.\n\nnews.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100315/ap_en_ot/eu_britain_people_kate_winslet\n\nNo, it was a normal article around the time that she won the double golden globes.\n\noooh. either way, unexpected, then again she's so private...\n\ninterestingly, lainey just posted an article about it:\n\nJulia Roberts and Benjamin Bratt broke up. Halle Berry and Eric Benet same. Hilary Swank and Chad Lowe. Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe.\n\nNow Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes.\n\nCoincidence or a curse? The Best Actresses and their relationship woes.\n\nJust announced today – Winslet and Mendes are over. They say it’s amicable. Well… this changes everything.\n\nKate has not worked since winning her Oscar. She was at home with her kids, with her husband. And still they weren’t able to make it stick. Obviously this couldn’t have happened overnight. It’s probably been a while, and they were able to control the story on their own timing.\n\nSo she’s been single for some time. And that brings us back to all the speculation about her face. Many of you say Botox and more. I was insisting it was makeup. But here’s a woman, on the eve of her second divorce, in her early 30s, with two children, and looking for love again. All of a sudden, you are looking “righter” than me. But I really, really don’t want to see her that way.\n\nAnd now it’s all for all those inevitable Leonardo DiCaprio connections to emerge from the rumour pond. Will the Titanic Ballad of Jack & Rose become a “Robsten” reality?\n\nBy the way, Kate is currently in Mexico with her children – photos are here. Strategically timed holiday to get away from the tabloid rush.\n\nlaineygossip"
