        "text": "Kate, on the possibility that her son could be gay: In an interview with V magazine, the ballsy thespian revealed a conversation she had with her son about his future love life. %E2%80%9CI like being in the city. I like the diversity that my children are exposed to every day. I love the way their brains work. (My son) Joe turns to me the other day and says %E2%80%98One day I will have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, darling. Which would you prefer?%E2%80%99 And I said, %E2%80%98My love, that would be entirely up to you, and it doesn%E2%80%99t make any difference to me.%E2%80%99 But that he knows! It%E2%80%99s a real privilege. Talk about the best education.%E2%80%9D\n\nOne thing I found strange is that Hall was cited as a home wrecker from day one when SM and KW announced their divorce. Mendes and Hall denied it, then an announcement is made a year later that they are in a relationship. Call me naive, but wouldn't a hook-up with the person whose marriage she was accused of breaking up hurt her career? They both kind of came out of it looking like liars, so I have to wonder what either of them is gaining from announcing their relationship; though, as I mentioned previously, I have not seen/read about a single sighting of them together. Is he offering her movie biz contacts if she agrees to \"be his girlfriend\"?\n\nSam Mendes is not gay. He is with Rebecca Hall and they are expecting a child together or have just had the baby. Sam was cheating on Kate with Rebecca in the end days of their marriage.\n\nKate 's over the top Oscar campaign behavior was either the final straw, or the symptom of the unravelling of the marriage. Kate was so supportive and gushing about Leo I think it was the final put down for Sam. But he obviously hasn't learned the lesson to never marry an actress.\n\nWinslet's first husband was a nobody assistant director when they met. It is hard to believe his career was somewhat stalled because of their brief marriage.\n\n[quote]When he and Winslet met, in 1997 on the set of Hideous Kinky he was a 'third assistant director', way down the food chain from her role as principal artist, although he had already rapidly worked his way up from his first job as a production runner on London's Burning.\n\n[quote]Was it particularly difficult, I ask him, untactfully, that Kate went off with another film director? 'It didn't factor. I mean we're hardly in the same game. Sam is highly acclaimed, quite rightly so, but it wasn't \"Oh shit, this guy, the director of American Beauty, is eclipsing everything I ever wanted.\" I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for his work, and subsequently I've found out over the years that he's a fantastic person to be in Mia's life. The hardest thing with divorce when children are involved is working out how the new relationship will work. You are obligated to generate new terms of friendship quickly, and I had beers with Sam as soon as possible so that there was never going to be this sense that we couldn't talk.'\n\nI think the money he got as a divorce settlement made it possible for him to spend six years writing and developing his first film. So he did all right.\n\nWinslet and Mendes worked together for the first time on Revolutionary Road, years into their marriage.\n\nPushing this thread up...noticed Sam and Rebecca both went to the Empire Awards, but there were no pictures of them together and he didn't mention her in his acceptance speeches. Have any of you seen pictures of them together or read sightings about them since their relationship was \"confirmed\" at the end of 2011? I just find it odd that there's nothing out there, which leads me to believe that they 1. Broke up, or 2. Weren't dating to begin with. Unless they're being REALLY secretive, but even then it's like, you admitted the relationship, it's been a year and a half since the confirmation...surely there would at least be a spotted-at-dinner sighting. Do they never go out in public together? Just curious; the whole thing seems a little odd.\n\nI tried to paste the link to the excerpt but when I went to post the message it wouldn't let me post. You can find the excerpt by doing a Google search with the appropriate key words.\n\nTo R68: Strange right? That's why I'm wondering if SM's publicist knew about the book, and if they did did they care? Sam had publicly dated Jane Horrocks, Rachel Weisz, and was in a relationship with Kate Winslet when the book was published, and yet you have the author stating SM as being gay (not even bi). How does that work?\n\nI also came across an old interview called Divas of Dish in New York magazines featuring various gossip writers, including Liz Smith and Michael Musto. Here is the Mendes section of the interview:\n\nMolloy: I think everyone has a right to privacy when it comes to their sex life.\n\nMusto: Have I been misreading your column? You're such a liar!\n\nMolloy: You're talking about our item on Nathan Lane?\n\nMusto: You're constantly going there and playing around. Nathan Lane is one of many examples. You wrote about Kevin Spacey at some Oscar party with Sam Mendes \"enjoying the guys in their Speedos.\" Do I have to remind you? You not only outed Spacey -- you outed American Beauty director Sam Mendes! Is Mendes even gay?\n\nMolloy: Wait a minute, a man can enjoy a guy in a Speedo and not be gay. Laughs.\n\nMusto: Tell that to the judge, honey.\n\nHa, so you're not sure about Sam Mendes? What's Daldry's deal?\n\nMeant to add that Rebecca Hall dated actor Simon Woods (Mr. Bingley in 2005's Pride & Prejudice) before he married Christopher Bailey, designer for Burberry. This is from March 2009's London Evening Standard:\n\n\"Woods, however, has a relationship history worthy of a gender-bending Shakespearean comedy. While studying English at Oxford, he dated Bond-girl Rosamund Pike, a union that lasted six years, until the pair split and Woods reconsidered his sexuality. He embarked on a relationship with a sculptor, Nick.\n\nLast night Woods seemed very pleased with his decision and happily posed for pictures with Hall. The pair would appear to be rather a good match with their cut-glass English accents, shared penchant for British drama and healthy scepticism of all things Hollywood. Let's just hope Woods doesn't change his mind again.\"\n\nJust thought it would be interesting to point out given the rumors about Mendes. She has obviously dated bi/potentially gay men in the past.\n\nThat's what I'm wondering, R80 (regarding Hall). I would totally be willing to believe that Woods and Mendes are bi and that the relationships with Hall are/were genuine, but I don't know. Being called a homewrecker (true or not) certainly didn't do her any favors, but maybe her people view that as being a better alternative to gay speculation, lest she get pigeonholed in acting roles. Is it unreasonable to think that a plan may have been concocted by his and her people? I'm just asking and thinking out loud.\n\nR84 - Apparently they're still together (meaning we haven't heard otherwise), but there was no mention of her being at the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory premiere this week. It could be that she had prior commitments (or maybe it's just a privacy thing), but I find it strange that there have been little to no sightings of them together in their entire relationship. Again, it could be them being very discrete, but why tell us you're dating in the first place if you, allegedly, want to keep your romance private? It's like they (or their PR) WANT us to know they're \"dating\". To me this makes sense if SM is allegedly bi/gay, and maybe for RH it's publicity and/or her own bearding situation? They know they won't be followed very closely as they're not at Brangelina status, so by saying \"we're dating\" the general public will just assume that they are. Could be wrong; just a theory.\n\nHmmm interesting.\n\nWord of their (Winslet and Mendes) split came about end of 2010 but I heard that they had been having trouble for at least a year before that.\n\nThere was also a blind item stating a long term (by Hollywood's standards) power couple who are both Oscar winners were breaking up as BOTH of them had new bfs. Sam Mendes and Kate Winslet were top guesses.\n\nPerhaps Hall is bearding for him?\n\nI still don't see why a director would need to beard. He must just be like every other bi guy on the down low.\n\nR86 - I believe they announced their split in March 2010 rather than the end of 2010?\n\nBut yes, I do remember the blind item about a couple at the 2009 Oscars acting like a couple but going to each of their boyfriends afterwards. KW and SM was a popular guess, as was SJP and Broderick.\n\nI could see SM not wanting his sexuality to potentially overshadow his career, thus the secrecy/potential bearding. Maybe, like actors, directors can also be pigeonholed if their sexuality is known? For example, would he have been offered a \"macho\" film like Bond if he was an openly gay/bi director? I'm wondering if Hollywood also has that mentality.\n\nI had to laugh at the pictures of Hall and Mendes because it looks like a father taking his daughter out.\n\nIf they're really dating I may be the only person who thinks they're telling the truth when they said she wasn't the reason for the breakdown of his marriage. The fact that Rebecca literally laughed off the rumors speaks volumes because say she had cheated and was lying about it, to laugh it off and deny it would show her to be a cold, selfish b*tch who is laughing about the breaking up of a family. She doesn't strike me as that kind of person, and hopefully I'm right.\n\nFirst (and only) pictures we see of Hall and Mendes are after the question of bearding is brought up AND she's in town to promote a movie. They announce their relationship in November 2011 when she has a movie coming out (The Awakening) and he's about to start shooting Bond. Hall's \"close relationship\" is cited as a reason for the breakdown of his marriage after some people on different gossip sites wonder aloud if the Mendes gay rumors will start again now that he and Kate are done. Maybe I've read DL for too long and am now just too cynical to think these are mere coincidences. Add in a comment Hall made about being OK with people believing the ridiculous rumors because it protects what's actually going on and all I can do is wonder.\n\nLainey Gossip item from February 3, 2011:\n\nA riddle for your troubles? How about this? He strayed with an actress on the set of his recent film, and is now desperate to keep it from his wife, who suspected, but who was won over by a family holiday and his new doting attitude. Only now the other woman is upset, threatening to overturn the peace, so he’s been calling in favours everywhere else to get her cast in another movie she’s not actually right for, just to get her to shut up. The favours he’s using up however could jeopardise his own project, and the people who are counting on his participation are getting increasingly anxious that he might f-ck it up for everyone else. Major stress and sleepless nights. It’s Not Blake Lively.\n\nMany guessed Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall on The Town. Some sites say that Blake was the red herring and that his affair was actually with Rebecca, so maybe the Mendes gossip was started to deflect from the Affleck stuff? I can't see Rebecca being the blackmailing type, but who knows? The \"movie she's not actually right for\" could be Lay the Favorite, which came out in 2011. It was panned pretty much across the board and Rebecca's performance (as a former stripper turned math genius) has been described as \"annoying.\"\n\nR131, that would make sense. I feel like Kate has dropped very subtle hints since their split but maybe I'm reading too much into her statements. One of them was her saying that it took someone putting his hand on her (\"a gay male friend, actually\") after her split from Sam and telling her that it was OK to cry. Why mention that the friend was gay? It could have been an insignificant, throw away comment, but I somehow felt it was related to her own situation.\n\nMendes already had a long theatre career before doing American Beauty. He was previously involved with Rachel Weisz and Jane Horrocks, neither of which strike me as being beards but I guess all the posters on here who like to think Daniel Craig is gay might disagree.\n\nI'm guessing (most) of the posters on here are American. Brits don't get their knickers in a twist about gay actors, much less gay directors - they don't care, so there isn't the pressure there is in Hollywood to stay in the closet.\n\nIn any case, aren't 90% of American theatre directors gay too? Why would they bother with beards? Doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nIf Kenneth Branagh IS gay, I don't want to know about it as he really isn't attractive AT ALL.\n\nSorry. I don't have any insider information. I just thought Sam was gay, first time I saw a picture of him or saw him in an interview and then I read that Kate Winslet married him and I thought, hummmm.\n\nWhen Keanu made Much Ado about Nothing, there were a ton of rumors swirling around about him. Any time Ken talked about Keanu he seemed love struck. I knew they had become friends and Ken visited Keanu in Nepal when he was filming with Bertolucci.\n\nLike you R141, I wish I had some real information, not just rumor and intuition.\n\nGood find, R162. Would Sam have been offered \"macho\" films like Jarhead and Skyfall if he was an out director? It's debatable. Homophobia may not apply as strongly to directors, writers, etc. as it does to actors, but I have no doubt that it does still apply. Some audiences might not know who they are, but as R164 said, the people that hire them do. It sounds crazy and stupid, but Hollywood is a crazy and stupid world.\n\nI think this is a case of us agreeing to disagree.\n\nr171 Exactly.\n\nr167 Why crazy and stupid? Have you lived in the real world? Never had someone discriminate against you and give the WORST person the best job? When I was young-there has been many-I was old I couldn't work the floors as a waitress because I was black; well someone told me but I'd always wondered. The boss wasn't a bad guy and weirdly enough we got on really well but that's what he believed would be an issue.\n\nr165 Damn you have either never worked AT ALL, esp in the entertainment industry or finance OR you have never read ANY books at ALL esp books like Wall Street or Bonfire of the Vanities.\n\nI don't believe I am saying this on DL but are people really that stupid that they think people get their jobs because of talent? Oh my. In a way I am envious some of you have either never had a job, are pure dumb when you do have a job or have never dealt with incompetence via someone in a more senior position then you!\n\nThere are situations where people get jobs because of talent, in other situations it's because of who they know, and sometimes it's a little bit of both. I think Mendes has shown himself to be a talented director but it wouldn't surprise me if connections/networking helped get him to where he is. But, that could be said for a LOT of people. Him hooking up with Serena (allegedly) was probably a huge boost in the theatre world. Whether Serena was used for connections, was a genuine relationship, or both is something we will probably never know.\n\nIn the British theatre, being gay is certainly not a disadvantage, so if Mendes were gay, he would not have hesitated to let it be known. Also, in the British theatre, being a well-connected Jewish grad of Cambridge certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nAs for Mendes being a closet case, if he is he has to be the only one in the history of the world who ever played cricket or became obsessed with watching cricket matches - the most boring, least gay sport ever known to mankind.\n\nFound on the Female First message board. This poster copied and pasted info that was posted on here a few years back. SM = Mendes, KW = Winslet\n\nHi all..I'll try to comment on the other posts. GP is bi. Do you think her relationship with Madge is strictly platonic? BA has a lot of addiction issues, with sexuality being one of them. He is totally self-destructive and that is why GP left him and that will be why JG does too. SM is no stranger to same sex hookups. I have never heard the same about KW but who knows...The poster (make-up artist) pretty much nails it on LD, LH and TM. CD & Kirsten Dunst have been on/off smack for years. KD descended in hardcore drugs after she caught Jake Gyllenhall in bed with Austin NIchols at the Chateau Marmont several years ago. And no matter what you read she has never recovered. His sister fixed them up hoping he was bi like the rest of the family. Guess what? He's not. Not a well kept secret. Anyway, his Mom has had an on/off affair with JLC for years.\n\nHere's the link to the FF message board where I found it.\n\nIn regards to Kate's first marriage, came across this on the Celebitchy comments section for for 10/3/11 and 11/27/11:\n\nFrom 11/27/11, winYT says: Winslet’s first husband cheated on her and gave her a STD. She had every reason to dump him.\n\nFrom 10/3/11, wtf: Kate’s first husband cheated on her and gave her a STD, that is the reason why she divorced him.\n\nComment found on Jezebel right after Kate and Sam announced their split:\n\n\"A friend of mine works in the film industry and has worked with Mendes. According to said friend, there have long been rumors about infidelity, homosexuality and an unusual relationship between DiCaprio/Mendes/Winslet. I have no idea if any of it is true (and for all we know, it isn't at all), but it does make me wonder.\"\n\nR214, I remember reading blind items regarding the mystery of the paternity of Natalie's baby, which alluded that Darren was actually the father. I try to take those things with a grain of salt, but Natalie's son looks an AWFUL lot like Darren/Darren's other son.\n\nConcerning Mendes, that's kind of how I feel about the Hall \"relationship\". There was no mention of her until after Kate and Sam announced their split and after people wondered if the gay rumors about him would resurface.\n\n[quote]The Weitz/Craig marriage was very sudden. It always seemed like preemptive publicity strike to avoid becoming a Jennifer Aniston to Natalie Potman and Darren Aronofsky's Angie and Brad.\n\nOnly Portman and Aronofsky didn't end up together, and probably wouldn't have even had they wanted to. She was up for Best actress, no way was she going to ruin her chances with a scandalous affair and a marriage break up. Aronofsky is no Pitt - no one would see why two gorgeous women would fight over him.\n\nWeisz is respected by Academy voters, they wouldn't have forgiven her as they did Jolie and certainly not so soon.\n\n[quote]Weisz is respected by Academy voters, they wouldn't have forgiven her as they did Jolie and certainly not so soon.\n\nhuh r128\n\nWeitz wasn't even nominated for anything that year What does the academy have do to with it? I meant her ego probably didn't want the personna of the jilted wife and Craig and she were friends and he may have needed a beard so...who knows.\n\nHere we go, trying to get this thread back on track...sort of...\n\nJust saw that John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are expecting a baby. According to CDAN (take from that what you will) Emily has allegedly cheated on John and people are wondering why they're 1. even married, and 2. why they're having a baby. People also wondered if she's bearding for him. There weren't any rumors about him and Mendes during Away We Go, were there?\n\nOriginal blind that was talked about before (with the link):\n\nBlindGossip – There was a well-known entertainment pair at the Academy Awards who sat together, occasionally holding and laughing together. What a nice couple! Not. They actually can’t stand each other and haven’t lived together in months. However, as one of Hollywood’s perceived stable couples, they are not yet ready to explain to the world that their long-time (by Hollywood standards) relationship is over. Certainly not in such a public setting. And if one of them had showed up solo, or with another escort, it would have brought up too many questions. So it was easier just to go together, pretend that everything’s great, and to go their separate ways after the big event… each to a new boyfriend.\n\nThis blind was from March 10, 2010, just a few days before Kate and Sam announced their split. Even though Sam wasn't at the Oscars with her in 2010, he was with her in 2009, and the blind doesn't specify which Oscars ceremony it was.\n\n[quote]Violet Affleck does look a lot like Victor.\n\nNever noticed that before but now that you mention it, she does. A bit. The middle girl is Ben's doppleganger though.\n\nIt's the resemblance of the new little boy to Damon that I can't get over. I know its just coincidence but its eerie. He'll probably look like Jen as he gets bigger.\n\nGeneral question (relating to this discussion): is it possible for publicists to remove articles about their clients from Google? If you type in 'Sam Mendes' or 'Rebecca Hall' on Google and then click news it seems the article from the Daily Mail of them walking around NYC has disappeared. It used to be on page 1 of their respective Google news pages, but now it's nowhere to be found. Granted you can still find the article, but it doesn't show up on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. pages of their respective Google news searches. Is it possible the publicist(s) removed it due to bad press?\n\nR230, Google removes news items once they are 30 days old.\n\nI know blind items are a bit of a 4 letter word here, but had to share this:\n\nThis actress is C list. A good actress but more known for her parents than her acting ability. Oh and her boyfriend. She was known for him too. Our actress ran into this B+ actor from a hit franchise that hit a bit of a bump this year when the latest installment was released. he is taking some of the blame and broached the idea of the actress being his beard. She's all for it. Loves it as a matter of fact.\n\nMy guess: Good C-list actress known more for her parents: Rebecca Hall(parents Peter the director and Maria the opera singer) Boyfriend she was known for: Sam Mendes B+ actor from a franchise who hit a bit of a bump: Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek (there was some backlash over him being cast as Kahn)\n\nBenedict and Rebecca were in two projects together: Starter For 10 and Parade's End\n\nFrom ONTD when Kate and Sam split:\n\nNo one cares, but one of my best friends interns for Premiere PR and she's one of two of Sara Keene's assistants, who's this director of something now in the company, but she use to be Sam Mendes' publicist, and the shit ex-publicists spill is incredible. Of course she could be lying, but the evidence is way too substantial to be merely coincidental. Supposedly he's been cheating on Kate for a long ass time now and she was one of many who had to cover for his affairs. Tabloids are shit, she's lyin', w/e, but I unfortunately believe his publicist. :/\n\nDoesn't say WHO these alleged affairs were with.\n\nA blind gossip item from 6/10/2010, reposted on BlindBuzz (with commentary):\n\nBeard Meets Beard:\n\nWhich tabloid favorites have broken up over a discovery that will shock the ever-faithful gossip hounds across the pond? While the tabloids will report that their was no third party involved, there was. A guy. Not for her. For him. The real reason they split is because she discovered him in bed with another man. It wasn’t the first time. Oh, and in case you are wondering about their child/ren, it might be helpful to know that their conception took place in a lab, not the bedroom. (Blind Gossip)\n\nIt sounds like this could be Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes, although we wouldn't really consider them \"tabloid fixtures.\"\n\nThanks for the location info, R242.\n\nLet's say that this relationship is genuine and there may or may not have been cheating going on; WHY, would someone as young and seemingly talented as Rebecca pursue this relationship? You were accused of cheating with this person and now you're \"with them\", making you both look like liars. Why would you risk your career and reputation for something that probably isn't long term? The only situation I can think of is that it's a potential arrangement: bwardibg for him, publicity for her.\n\nMaybe I'm just too cynical and it's a totally different in private (genuine and loving and whatnot), but look at their body language and tell me that's a happy couple.\n\nStill together, R258. You know what, though? I know nothing about the guy but I wouldn't be surprised if he's a good fit for Kate. They both seem like they know how to let their hair down, which is an impression I never got of Mendes. I'm sure Sam's a decent guy, but between his alleged gayness and the seeming differences in his and Kate's personalities I'm not surprised they didn't last.\n\nRebecca Hall never dated Simon Woods. They starred together in Starter for 10 and are friends.\n\nr79 posted an article by the Evening Standard, they corrected themselves later:\n\n\"Simon weaves a tangled web DISHY actor Simon Woods’s love-life continues to astound us. The Cranford actor has a relationship history worthy of a gender-bending Shakespearean comedy.\n\nAt university he was happily ensconced with Bond girl Rosamund Pike. After breaking up with her he dated a male sculptor called Nick. Earlier this year it was reported he had hitched up with actress Rebecca Hall. Now he appears to be dating Christopher Bailey, the creative director of Burberry.\n\nWoods and Hall , daughter of Sir Peter Hall and star of the Woody Allen film Vicky Cristina Barcelona, made their first public outing at the V&A’s opening of its new Theatre and Performance galleries where they held hands for most of the evening and Hall introduced the fairhaired actor to friends as “my boyfriend”.\n\nBut was the relationship for real? With Simon you can just never tell. The Londoner was inundated with calls from distressed young ladies who all insisted that the ever-desirable Simon really was still batting for the other side. And now it appears that all the V&A flirting may have been a joke as Bailey and Woods have reportedly now been together for six months.\n\nLet’s hope the ladies of London aren’t too disheartened.\"\n\nI need to find the quote again, but Rebecca Hall's father (a theatre director) talked about an actor he worked with bearding back in the day because, to loosely quote him, \"that's just what you did.\"\n\nI don't think it's outside the realm of possibility to suggest that an actress needing/wanting more visibility would beard for a high profile director who was in talks to work on a major film franchise that centered around a womanizing action hero.\n\nAnd, like R284 said, his work provides a lot of evidence. How many musicals has this guy directed?\n\nI side-eye Sam for signing that Roman Polanski petition. I know Kate worked with him but as far as I know she didn't sign the petition. Like R282 I view Sam as being pretty pretentious, and it wouldn't surprise me if he thought of himself as an oh-so-progressive artiste for signing the petition. What if the victim was YOUR kid, Sam?\n\nWhy Rebecca is with him is beyond me. Maybe they have a genuine connection (aka mutual pretentiousness) or maybe she's with him for the status and career boost. OR, like others have pointed out, maybe she's bearding for him in exchange for publicity and career help. Funny how Kate Winslet turned down the role in Transcendence and it went to Rebecca...plus the fact that she scored an audition for The Great Gatsby opposite Kate's good friend.\n\nTranslation of the blind at link:\n\nThis English actress confided that her ex-husband has never really betrayed, but she prefers to believe that this is so: in reality, their relationship is over because he confessed that he \"does not believe that will stay with the same woman all my life, anyway \" I will be glad his current girlfriend. Kate Winslet / Sam Mendes / Rebecca Hall\n\nI think the last sentence is supposed to be something like: I'm sure his current girlfriend will be glad."
