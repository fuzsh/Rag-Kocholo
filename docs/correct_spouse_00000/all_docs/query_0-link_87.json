        "text": "Kate Winslet (born October 5, 1975, Reading, Berkshire, England) is an English actress known for her sharply drawn portrayals of spirited and unusual women.\n\nWinslet was raised in a family of actors. She began performing at an early age, taking small parts in commercials, television shows, and stage plays. Her first major role was in director Peter Jackson’s drama Heavenly Creatures (1994). The film, based on the Pauline Parker–Juliet Hulme case in New Zealand, depicted the obsessive fantasy life of two adolescent girls and their eventual murder of Parker’s mother. In 1995 Winslet appeared in an adaptation of the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility; the film was written by actress Emma Thompson and directed by Ang Lee. Winslet’s turn as Marianne Dashwood, a young woman set financially and romantically adrift by the circumstances of her father’s death, brought her to the attention of a larger audience and earned her an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. Winslet then starred in another literary adaptation, Jude (1996), which was based on Thomas Hardy’s novel Jude the Obscure (1895). Winslet solidified her burgeoning reputation for taking period roles by portraying Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh’s production of Hamlet (1996).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz\n\nIn 1997 Winslet became an international star with the release of director James Cameron’s Titanic, an epic that innovatively blended a conventional romantic story line with the large-scale computer-generated special effects normally reserved for action movies. Winslet portrayed heroine Rose DeWitt Bukater, a wealthy, idealistic young woman who pursues a brief, passionate affair with Jack Dawson, a struggling artist played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The film set box-office records, and Winslet received her second Oscar nomination.\n\nFollowing the phenomenon generated by Titanic, Winslet eschewed a career in popular, lucrative movies in favour of several independent films. Hideous Kinky (1998) featured Winslet as a woman traveling in search of spiritual fulfillment in 1960s Morocco with her two daughters. In Holy Smoke (1999) she starred as a young woman whose parents extricate her from a cult and attempt to have her deprogrammed. Winslet further demonstrated a tendency to choose provocative roles with Quills (2000), in which she played a laundress smuggling manuscripts written by the Marquis de Sade out of the insane asylum where he is imprisoned. Her transformation into writer Iris Murdoch in Iris (2001) won her further accolades, including Oscar and Golden Globe nominations.\n\nAgain demonstrating a proclivity for idiosyncratic choices, Winslet portrayed a woman who has the memories of a painful relationship erased by a new medical procedure in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), earning her yet another Academy Award nomination. In Little Children (2006) she appeared as a housewife whose frustration with the tedium of her suburban existence results in an adulterous affair. Winslet earned her fifth Academy Award nomination for that performance; she was the youngest actress to have received that many nominations. She turned to lighter matters with the romantic comedy The Holiday (2006) and Flushed Away (2006), a computer-animated adventure for which she provided the voice of a rat.\n\nA 2008 adaptation of Richard Yates’s novel Revolutionary Road again paired Winslet and DiCaprio, this time as an unconventional couple attempting to buck the restrictive mores of 1950s suburbia. The film was directed by Winslet’s husband, Sam Mendes, whom she had married in 2003 (they divorced in 2010). In The Reader (2008), Winslet explored the ethical complexities of the Holocaust as an illiterate concentration camp guard. For her performances in Revolutionary Road and The Reader, Winslet won Golden Globe Awards for best actress and best supporting actress, respectively. For her work in The Reader she also earned her first Academy Award (for best actress).\n\nIn 2011 Winslet moved to the small screen with the titular role in the Home Box Office (HBO) miniseries Mildred Pierce, based on James M. Cain’s novel about the travails of a divorced mother in the 1930s. Winslet received an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her performance. Returning to feature films, she then appeared in Contagion (2011), as an epidemiologist analyzing the spread of a deadly virus, and in the satiric comedy Carnage (2011), as one of four parents entangled in a dispute about child rearing. She played a single mother who develops a relationship with an escaped convict in Labor Day (2013). Winslet then stalked the screen as a ruthless operative in Divergent (2014), based on a series of young-adult novels, and wafted through the period piece A Little Chaos (2014), a fictional take on the romantic life of Versailles garden designer André Le Nôtre.\n\nIn 2016 Winslet was awarded a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Apple marketing executive Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015), a biopic about seminal moments in the career of the titular computer pioneer; she also received an Oscar nomination, her seventh overall, for her performance. Winslet then appeared as a vampy Russian mobster in the crime thriller Triple 9 and as the coworker of a grieving father in the tearjerker Collateral Beauty (both 2016). Her credits from 2017 included The Mountain Between Us, an adventure drama about strangers who survive a plane crash, and Wonder Wheel, a comedy directed by Woody Allen, in which she portrayed a bored waitress on Coney Island in the 1950s. In the biopic Ammonite (2020), Winslet played English fossil hunter Mary Anning. After lending her voice to Black Beauty (2020), Winslet starred in the HBO miniseries Mare of Easttown (2021), about a small-town detective investigating a murder while dealing with her own personal struggles; for her acclaimed performance, the actress received her second Emmy."
