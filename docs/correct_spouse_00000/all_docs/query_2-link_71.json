        "text": "Kate Winslet has garnered worldwide acclaim — plus an Oscar and many nominations — for capturing the anguish of romantic heartache onscreen.\n\nIt helps that the actress, who turns 36 Tuesday, knows from experience. In March 2010, she and Revolutionary Road director Sam Mendes ended their marriage of seven years.\n\n\"One thing I will say about me and Sam is that it's fine, it's really fine,\" the star tells Harper's Bazaar UK — and she has no intention of slinging mud or worse at her second husband. \"I'm not going to s***fling, there's no point in even going there. It is what it is.\"\n\nShooting her Emmy-winning role in the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce amidst the split came especially naturally, she admitted. \"There's a scene where Mildred and Bert are divorced and they sit down together, because they've got to settle on a cause,\" Winslet explained. \"The first stage of my divorce with Sam came through on the very day that we were shooting. So that scene is nothing to do with acting.\"\n\nOne key to keeping the peace with Mendes: the couple's son, Jack, 7. \"We're grown-ups at the end of the day, and however hard it's been for me, it’s been equally hard for him. And we have a child together who we both love – and raising him together, jointly and without any conflict, is absolutely key,\" Winslet explains.\n\nAnd Winslet has been through this before, too. She has a daughter, Mia, nearly 12, with her first husband Jim Threapleton.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood's friendliest exes\n\n\"[Co-parenting with an ex] is the only way to do it, and I've really learnt that with Mia,\" Winslet explains.\n\nAnd as far as the future — Winslet is now dating \"Ned Rocknroll,\" the wild nephew of Richard Branson — the star is ready for whatever comes.\n\n\"I feel that I'm just at the beginning of a new narrative, and it's incredibly exciting,\" she tells Harper's Bazaar. \"It's complicated, I know, and uncertain – but it's where life happens, between the cracks. It can be a painful process, but I truly hope that never stops for me.\""
