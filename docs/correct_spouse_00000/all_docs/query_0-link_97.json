        "text": "LONDON (AP) -- British actress Kate Winslet says she spends so much time talking about Leonardo DiCaprio she's starting to confuse him with her real husband, Sam Mendes.\n\nWinslet is in the U.K. promoting the movie \"Revolutionary Road,\" which Mendes directed. The film reunites her with her \"Titanic\" co-star and longtime friend DiCaprio.\n\nThe duo's reunion more than a decade after the melodramatic blockbuster was hotly anticipated, and both have been peppered with questions over whether their on-screen chemistry is still as strong.\n\nWinslet told Britain's GMTV Monday that DiCaprio \"feels more like my husband than my real husband, I have to say. I'm talking about him so much!\""
