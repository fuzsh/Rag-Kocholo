        "text": "The pair have managed to keep a fairly low profile\n\ndespite their fame. They made their first British\n\npublic appearance together last year when they attended the premiere of Mr Mendes's second film, The Road To Perdition.\n\nMs Winslet, 27, and her partner arrived arm in arm at the event in London's\n\nLeicester Square. But asked then whether they had any plans to tie the knot, she said: \"Get out of here\".\n\nThe couple have homes in London and a country retreat in the Cotswolds, thought to be worth over Â£3 million.\n\nIt is Ms Winslet's second marriage. She was married for little over three years to assistant director Jim Threapleton, but they\n\ndivorced in December 2001. Their daughter Mia was born in October 2000.\n\nShe and 37-year-old Mr Mendes, who like her hails from Reading, near London, became an item within two months of her split from Mr Threapleton.\n\nMs Winslet has said of her relationship with the Oscar-winning American Beauty director: \"We are very happy, unbelievably happy.\"\n\nMr Mendes who made his reputation on the stage carried off three Laurence Olivier awards earlier this year and said it was his love for Ms Winslet which had inspired him.\n\nAccepting the prizes he said: \"I want to say thank you to my partner Kate,\n\nbecause these are two plays about love and it helps when you direct them to have personal experience.\""
