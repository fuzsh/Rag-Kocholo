        "text": "Winslet and Mendes met in 2001\n\nActress Kate Winslet and director Sam Mendes have married in a small ceremony in the West Indies.\n\nThey married last month at a low-key, private ceremony attended by just three of the couple's friends.\n\nIt is Winslet's second marriage, following her divorce from film director Jim Threapleton two years ago after three years of marriage.\n\nThe Titanic actress began a relationship with the Oscar-winning director soon afterwards.\n\nMendes has always maintained that he and Winslet only started seeing each other after the actress's first marriage ended.\n\nThey first appeared together publicy at a premiere for Iris in New York at the end of 2001.\n\nThreapleton and Winslet split after reports in the press of arguments, while family members said the demands of the actress' career put an impossible strain on the relationship.\n\nWinslet's daughter from her first marriage was present at the ceremony.\n\n'Small ceremony'\n\nA statement issued on their behalf on Monday said: \"This is to formally announce that Sam Mendes and Kate Winslet married in late May in a very small ceremony whilst on holiday in the West Indies.\n\n\"Present were Kate Winslet's daughter Mia and three close friends.\"\n\nSam Mendes, who like Winslet hails from Reading, Berkshire, is a highly successful stage director but is perhaps best known for the Oscar-winning film American Beauty and his second feature film Road to Perdition.\n\nBefore meeting Winslet, he was linked with a string of stars including The Mummy actress Rachel Weisz.\n\nHis former partners include Jane Horrocks and Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart.\n\nWinslet remains world famous for her role in the blockbuster Titanic, and is highly regarded for her roles in smaller, independent films.\n\nShe received an Oscar nomination for her role in Titanic and won two further Academy Award nominations for performances in Iris and Sense and Sensibility.\n\nWinslet has said of her relationship with the Oscar-winning American Beauty director: \"We are very happy, unbelievably happy.\"\n\nMendes won three Laurence Olivier awards earlier this year and said that it was his love for Winslet which had inspired him.\n\nAccepting the prizes he said: \"I want to say thank you to my partner Kate, because these are two plays about love and it helps when you direct them to have some personal experience.\""
