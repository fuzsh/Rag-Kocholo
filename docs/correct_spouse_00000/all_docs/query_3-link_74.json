        "text": "Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are one of those actors in the film industry who undoubtedly make the best on-screen couple. However, the two have shared the screen just twice, first in the 1997 iconic film Titanic and then in the 2008 film Revolutionary Road. The 2008 release was directed by Sam Mendes, who is also Winslet’s former husband. Since DiCaprio and Winslet played the role of a couple, it’s needless to mention that there were scenes in the movie that would have involved some physical intimacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo make sure that DiCaprio does not get awkward while filming such scenes and in the presence of Winslet’s then-husband, Mendes opted for a stern professional approach and stuck to a professional relationship of director and actor with his then-wife throughout the film’s shoot.\n\nSam Mendes maintained a professional relationship with his wife Kate Winslet while filming\n\nSam Mendes is a renowned filmmaker, who was once married to actress Kate Winslet. Known for his craft, Mendes makes sure that his work is perfect, and he does not even let his personal relationships hinder his work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreviously, when the director collaborated with his then-wife for the 2008 film Revolutionary Road, he took certain measures to ensure that the actors didn’t feel awkward performing intimate scenes before him.\n\nAlso Read: “Listen, you do my film”: Kate Winslet Exposes Director and Male Investors’ Disrespectful Comments When She Was Trying to Get Money For Her Movie ‘Lee’\n\nThe film starred DiCaprio alongside Winslet, they played the role of a couple. Though the actors had previously collaborated for the iconic film, Titanic, and shared a great bond, Mendes was sure that performing romantic scenes before him with his then-wife, would make things awkward for Dicaprio, and this may affect the scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHence, he tried to make things easy for DiCaprio by maintaining a professional relationship with Winslet. During an interview with Vanity Fair, the director said,\n\n“For me it was a lot about Leo: I wanted him to feel that she and he were on each other’s side and looking out for each other, rather than me and Kate. Because the person who was in the most complicated position in many ways was Leo, because he was there having to be married to, you know, the director’s wife.\n\nAnd also I made a decision very early on, in rehearsals, that I just had to treat Kate as I would treat any other leading actress of her stature. And I had to do it 24 hours a day because otherwise it would be confusing. Because if I came back and started talking as her husband, rather than her director, then it would have been very, very confusing for her, and for me too.”\n\nMendes and Winslet were married in 2003, and after eight years of their marriage, they called it quits.\n\nAlso Read: “I could barely standup”: Kate Winslet Ignored Her Own Team’s Warning Even After 3 Massive Hematones on Her Spine in ‘Lee’\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Mendes confessed that he initially doubted Kate Wisnlet’s potential as an actress\n\nDuring the same interview, Sam Mendes confessed that he was never confident about Kate Winslet’s acting skills before he worked with her. The filmmaker said,\n\n“I didn’t realize the extent of her absolute dedication—and I know it’s such a corny word to use, but I really didn’t—until I worked with her. I had seen every aspect of her in many ways except the professional side of her and how incredibly focused she is.”\n\nHowever, Mendes’s perception changed after working with Winslet, and he even appreciated her craft. Indeed, Winslet is an impeccable actress and has proved her mettle in the film industry by delivering some iconic performances.\n\nAlso Read: “I was consistently told I was the wrong shape”: Hollywood Body-Shamed Kate Winslet after Back Injury Made it Impossible for Her to Exercise Properly\n\nAdvertisement"
