Despite being bullied for her weight in school (children called her \"blubber\") she was determined to act and often appeared in school plays.\n\nOnly weeks after she finished her GCSEs, Kate scored a role in BBC drama Dark Season which was her screen debut and appeared on various low-key programmes in the years after.\n\nShe was one of 175 girls to audition for Peter Jackson's 1994 psychological drama Heavenly Creatures, and was cast because of her natural intensity.\n\nAfter seeing her lauded performance, Emma Thompson cast her as recklessly romantic teenager Marianne Dashwood in her version of Sense and Sensibility in 1995, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nWhat are Kate Winslet’s biggest films?\n\n- Titanic\n\n- Sense and Sensibility\n\n- The Reader\n\n- Revolutionary Road\n\n- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\n- The Holiday\n\n- Little Children\n\n- Finding Neverland\n\n- Quills\n\n- Steve Jobs\n\nIs Kate Winslet married?\n\nKate Winslet is currently married to Edward Abel Smith (who previously went by the name Ned Rocknroll) - the nephew of Virgin Group founder Richard Branson - who have been married since 2012.

I love you with all my heart, I really do.\"\n\nWhat is Kate Winslet’s net worth?\n\nKate Winslet has an estimated net worth of $65 million.\n\nIs there anything else we should know about Kate Winslet?\n\nKate Winslet is extremely vocal about the dangers of social media, and co-wrote I Am Ruth about the stresses social media puts young adults and their families under.\n\nShe is co-founder of the charity Golden Hat Foundation which aims to create autism awareness.\n\nKate missed the film premiere of Titanic to attend the funeral of her former lover and mentor Stephen Tredre who died of bone cancer that year, In 2008, she revealed she’s never got over his death."
