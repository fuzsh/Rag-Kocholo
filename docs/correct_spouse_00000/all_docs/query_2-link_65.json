        "text": "Leonardo DiCaprio reportedly walked Kate Winslet down the aisle during her secret wedding to Ned Rocknroll.\n\nRight — it’s stunning. Someone named themselves “Rocknroll.” And it wasn’t Tom Cruise’s character in “Rock of Ages.”\n\nA source told Us Weekly that the bride’s longtime friend and co-star of “Titanic” and “Revolutionary Road” had the honor of giving her away at her wedding earlier this month.\n\nWinslet’s rep confirmed the secret wedding ceremony, telling People magazine:\n\n“I can confirm that Kate Winslet married Ned Rocknroll in NY earlier this month in a private ceremony attended by her two children and a very few friends and family. The couple had been engaged since the summer.”\n\nHowever, reps have not yet confirmed reports that DiCaprio walked Winslet down the aisle. So let’s just assume it happened.\n\nA rep for DiCaprio would not confirm that the actor was at Winslet and Rocknroll’s wedding.\n\nThis is the third marriage for Winslet, who was previously married to Jim Threapleton from 1998 to 2001 and to director Sam Mendes from 2003 to 2010.\n\nOf course, Ned Rocknroll is not his real name. The 34-year-old businessman was born Abel Smith, and he is the nephew of Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. He currently works for his uncle’s company Virgin Galactic, which is the space-travel division of the Branson empire. Before his relationship with Winslet, Rocknroll was previously married to British socialite Eliza Pearson for two years."
