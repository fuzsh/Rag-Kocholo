The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement,\" London lawyer Keith Schilling said in a statement Monday.\n\n\"Both parties are fully committed to the joint parenting of their children,\" Schilling added. \"They ask that the media respect the privacy of the family.\"\n\nWinslet and Mendes have a six-year-old son, Joe, and Winslet has a nine-year-old daughter, Mia, from her previous marriage to Jim Threapleton, an assistant director she met while making the low-budget \"Hideous Kinky\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead all the Breaking News Live on indiatvnews.com and Get Latest English News & Updates from Entertainment and Hollywood Section\n\nKate Winslet Splits With Director Husband"
