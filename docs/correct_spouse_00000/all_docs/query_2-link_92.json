        "text": "Kate Winslet has opened up on the sweet way her “superhuman” husband Edward Abel Smith, formerly known as Ned Rocknroll, helps her prepare for her roles.\n\nKate Winslet has candidly revealed some adorable details about her life with her third husband, Edward 'Ned' Smith, as she praised him for the way he supports her with her professional commitments. The Oscar-winning actor has previously been married to directors Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes and now lives in the UK with Ned.\n\nEarlier this year, Kate revealed how her daughter Mia has hidden her connection to her mother in the film industry. With Mia “flying under the radar” in Hollywood pursuing her own acting career, Kate has previously discussed the impact lockdown has had on her career and her family. And when it comes to her home-life, it’s her husband Ned who many fans might not know too much about.\n\nNow Kate has now opened up about how her “superman” husband and revealed exactly how he overcomes his own challenges to support her.\n\nWho is Kate Winslet's husband Edward Abel Smith?\n\nKate Winslet has been married three times, but it’s her current husband, Edward Abel Smith, who could perhaps intrigue fans the most. And as the Titanic star recently explained during her enlightening interview with The New York Times, he certainly didn’t plan on marrying someone in the public eye like she is. Kate’s husband was previously known by his more playful pseudonym, Ned Rocknroll, but has since reverted back to using his birth name, though Kate still fondly refers to him as ‘Ned’.\n\nThe couple reside in Sussex and Kate has now revealed that her “extraordinary” husband is devoted to helping her prepare for future roles, despite the challenges posed by his dyslexia.\n\n“He is an absolutely extraordinary life partner,” she said. “I’m so, so, so lucky. For a man who is severely dyslexic, as he is, he’s great at testing me on lines. It’s so hard for him to read out loud, but he still does it.”\n\nNed’s support and commitment to helping Kate when it comes to her professional life is a heartwarming reflection of their strong marriage. And according to the actor, Ned also goes above and beyond when it comes to their personal life.\n\n“He’s the superhot, superhuman, stay-at-home dad,” Kate shared happily. “He looks after us, especially me.”\n\nShe went on to add that his long hair currently gives him the look of “an ocean warrior”, whilst sharing a particularly adorable anecdote that showcases his caring side.\n\n“I said to him earlier, like, ‘Neddy, could you do something for me?’ He just went, ‘Anything’,” Kate declared.\n\nGoing on to discuss what it’s like for Ned, having married an Oscar-winner, the actor explained that her husband remains very Zen, despite facing the judgment that comes with being so well-known.\n\n“He didn’t particularly plan on meeting and marrying a woman who is in the public eye and therefore having been so judged,” Kate candidly admitted, before sharing: “He’s vegan, does yoga, breath work and cold water swims.”\n\nSo it seems that whilst being married to Kate might bring more scrutiny to the couple, Ned and Kate have found the perfect way to balance work and family life together.\n\nWhere did Kate Winslet meet her husband?\n\nKate Winslet met her husband Edward Abel ‘Ned’ Smith on his uncle Sir Richard Branson’s private Caribbean island, Necker Island, in 2011. She and her children were understood to have been staying on the privately owned island when a fire broke out during a wind and lightning storm.\n\nKate has previously recalled to ET how Ned, who had been staying in a nearby residence, and Richard helped get her and her children to safety after the home caught fire.\n\n\"I met my husband in a house fire,\" she declared. \"He was the only dude to have a head torch and a pair of shoes, everyone else left everything behind.\n\n\"I took a bra and passports and my children. So I married him!\" she added jokingly. \"I was like, 'I'll go for the guy with a head torch!'”\n\nKate and Ned went on to marry in a beautiful private ceremony in New York in 2012. It’s understood that they tied the knot in front of her two children and a small group of friends, with Leonardo DiCaprio, who was her co-star in both Titanic and Revolutionary Road, giving her away.\n\nDo Kate Winslet and her husband have children?\n\nKate Winslet is a devoted mother of three and she and Ned have a seven-year-old son together, Bear Blaze Winslet. According to The New York Times, their son’s middle name was chosen after the fire Kate and Ned escaped and where they first met. She also shares a daughter Mia (20) with her first husband, director Jim Threapleton, and a son Joe (17) with Sam Mendes, her second husband.\n\nMia has gone on to pursue a career in acting herself and secured her first acting job as the lead role in the 2020 thriller Shadows."
