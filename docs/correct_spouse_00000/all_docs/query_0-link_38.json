        "text": "The couple were considered one of Hollywood’s strongest unions, especially because Kate, 34, never held back from praising her Oscar-winning “brilliant” husband in interviews.\n\nBut last night the actress was holidaying in Mexico with just her children for company, Joe Alfie Mendes, six, and Mia Honey, nine, her daughter by first husband Jim Threapleton.\n\nCHELTENHAM FESTIVAL: GET YOUR FREE £100 BET HERE...\n\nIn a case of life imitating art, Kate’s next project for TV will see her playing Mildred Pierce, a woman who leaves a failed marriage to start a new career for the sake of her children.\n\nThe couple’s joint lawyer Keith Schilling broke the news, saying: “Kate and Sam are saddened to announce that they separated earlier this year.\n\n“The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement. Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children.” Mr Schilling added that there would be no further comment.\n\nThe couple’s agent refused to make a statement, other than to confirm the split happened earlier this year.\n\nMendes, 44, directed his wife in the 2008 film Revolutionary Road, which won her a Golden Globe for Best Actress. Last year he was at Winslet’s side as she won an Oscar for her performance in The Reader.\n\nBut this year the actress attended the March awards ceremony – and the British Baftas in February – alone. Looking slimmer and blonder than usual, Kate did not hint at marriage troubles, but won praise for her fashion sense.\n\nThe couple’s personal life was showing no signs of strain either. In January, the pair even jointly applied for planning permission to expand their £5million 18th-century Cotswolds manor house.\n\nSadly for Winslet, this is her second failed marriage. The actress fell in love with assistant film director Jim Threapleton on the set of Hideous Kinky in Morocco in 1998, a year after she starred in Titanic.\n\nThe internationally famous “English rose”, then 23, outwitted everyone but close friends and family by marrying the 25-year-old at her local church in Reading, Berkshire, in a surprisingly low-key ceremony. But the seemingly perfect union crumbled just three years later and Jim and Kate separated in September 2001.\n\nThey divorced three months later, citing “enormous pressure” from Kate’s role in Titanic which transformed her into a global star.\n\nAt the time of the divorce, Kate’s publicist stated that “no other parties” were involved in the “amicable and respectful separation”.\n\nBut later that year, Mendes admitted he was having an affair with the actress. Speaking at the time, he said: “I was very careful to ensure that I was not endangering her marriage.\n\n“Indeed, it was already over, and I came along well after.”\n\nThe couple married in 2003 in the West Indies. Their “unbelievably happy” wedding was a secret, with just three guests and Kate’s daughter Mia in attendance. They own homes in New York and Gloucestershire."
