        "text": "To be fair no one knows when this so called interview was done the magazine might have been released a few months ago but the interview might have been done months before that so at the time the marriage could have been fine. People are so quick to jump on Kate when no one knows the detials could me Mendes for all we know.\n\nLead in times for mag interviews are often up to two/three months but does that make it any better? Are we really saying that a marriage goes from sublime to separation in that time? Twice in her case?\n\n[in Threapleton's case, she was certainly giving the interviews about how great he was a matter of weeks before she dumped him]\n\n0\n\nBut it does matter at that point her life might have been perfect just won an oscar, film career going great, rich, Kids doing well and maybe at that point the marriage was great. Your looking at 6 months plus if not longer since an interview things can happen. Im not saying its right just at least to be considered before jumping on her back.\n\n0\n\nI'm amazed how much hate and jealously there is against Kate cos she seems like such a nice, genuine person to me. Everyone is so quick to believe Kate is in the wrong but Sam might have been the one who ended the marriage.\n\nThis place never fails to amaze me. Women always turn on each other. Guys lap it up. Cheryl Cole and Victoria Beckham are another example. They get more bile thrown at them than their cheating husbands.:rolleyes: As you have seen people have already made up their mind on this one. Kate is at fault.:rolleyes: (Maybe she is at fault, We don't know) We don't know anything. We are guessing. They are very private. The press didn't even see this one coming.\n\n0\n\nIt's not that I don't feel sorry for her, I actually do. I am also not jealous of her and nor do I blame her.\n\nAs a couple of people have remarked, she just has a tendency to gush about her wonderful, perfect life and marriages in interviews and then her words come back and bite her on the ass.\n\nThis is the second time she has gushed about her marriage in interviews only to split up shortly afterwards.\n\nI don't know whose fault the split is and I'm not blaming her for that.\n\nI just wish she'd gush a bit less about being normal, getting ready in 10 minutes, fitness and figure down to 20 minutes pilates a day (Get real! And the rest!). She's more than a tad Hollywood and whilst there is nothing wrong with being like that, if you are in to all that, I just don't understand why she wants to try and convince us that she is so normal? I'd respect her more if she was just honest.\n\nI do think its sad she has split up with Sam Mendes. But I still think she is an unsufferable luvvie too.\n\n0\n\nI don't find her attractive and there are women waaaaay more successful than her of whom I'm not in the least bit jealous - she's not even on my jealousy radar and I've never heard of anyone saying they envied her either.\n\nSome are more easily pleased than other I guess.\n\nWho is more successful than Kate Winslet? Or what famous female anyway?! She's massively successful. she's an A-list superstar. You might not rate her looks-wise, that's fair enough, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. You might not be jealous of her, and like I said, there will be plenty who are not, but you always get some who are jealous of the rich, famous, attractive etc.\n\n0\n\nEr, anyone who has a successful marriage/home life can be said to be more successful than her.\n\nBut the point is just because not everyone thinks she's God's gift doesn't mean they're jealous. People throw that around all too easily on here...judging others by their own low standards.\n\nI was thinking more in terms of fame and money and career success but then you can get people who are jealous of those who have a successful marriage/home life.\n\nDid you not see that I said that the majority of people who make negative comments won't be jealous? Of course you can make negative comments about someone and not be jealous, but there are a minority of people who will always be jealous of the rich and famous and beautiful. That's how it is.\n\n0\n\nOn here though! There aren't any posts screaming 'jealousy'. Someone has presumptuously thrown that accusation around because some posts aren't exactly kissing her @rse...which is ridiculous!\n\nI agree with that and I don't think that just because someone makes negative comments about someone else that automatically makes them jealous, that is just ridiculous. I've made plenty of negative comments myself about a couple of people I don't like and I'm not jealous of them.....although I had to check myself at one point to make sure!!\n\n0\n\nI think *jealous* is just thrown around far too much in discussions about public figures. I can admit to envying people in my chosen profession on that basis - but not hollyweird types.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that it takes both parties to make a relationship work and when things fall apart, most of the time it's for a combination of things rather than one particular reason. Like Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins before them, I give them credit for keeping things under wraps and being civilised - I hope it stays that way especially for the sake of their children.\n\n0"
