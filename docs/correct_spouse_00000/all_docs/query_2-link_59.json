        "text": "Despite her star power, Kate Winslet’s houses are typically places she goes to escape the limelight. Born in the English town of Reading, Berkshire, Winslet has tried her hand at city living—she and ex-husband Sam Mendes once owned a town house in London, and she maintained a penthouse in NYC for nearly two decades—but she’s ultimately happiest when she’s in the countryside. “I love our life,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2015 of her family’s quiet life in Sussex. “The countryside, in particular, is very good for my head.” Presently, the star of the new HBO series The Regime is content to spend the majority of her time at her 17th-century house in the seaside village of West Wittering with her husband, Edward Abel Smith, and her three children, Mia, Joe, and Bear. It’s there, she said, that she gets to “notice that the [blackberries] growing closer to the sea taste slightly saltier than the ones on the other side of the hedge.” Below, we’ve rounded up some of the other places where Winslet has found peace over the years.\n\nThe Pole House\n\nIn 1997, Winslet made her big screen debut playing Rose DeWitt Bukater in James Cameron’s Titanic opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, catapulting her into a new echelon of fame. The following year, she married director Jim Threapleton, and together the newlyweds picked up a home in Angarrack, in the English county of Cornwall. The residence was a unique Japanese-style property known as the Pole House, designed by award-winning local architect Barrie Briscoe, and cost an estimated $255,000. A real estate agent who dealt with the sale said Winslet “fell in love with it because it was completely unusual and very eco at the time.” The house measured 1,364 square feet and had the appearance of a giant tree house built entirely of timber set atop giant wood poles bolted into slabs of concrete. The main room had high, vaulted beam ceilings and walls made of a mix of birch, pine, cedar, American redwood, and Douglas fir. Winslet and Threapleton split in 2001 (following the birth of their daughter, Mia, in 2000) and sold the property shortly afterward for an undisclosed amount. It was later listed on Airbnb as a vacation home and even inspired the stage name of musician Amber Bain, known professionally as the Japanese House, after she stayed there on holiday as a child.\n\nCastle Minor\n\nIn 2001, before their split, Winslet and Threapleton picked up their second Cornwall home, a historic, cliffside property that was originally built in 1899, known as Castle Minor. The couple paid about $485,622 in today’s dollars for the two-story abode, which was meant to be a getaway house for the family of three. They reportedly sank a good amount of money into renovations but ultimately never lived in the home. Winslet reportedly held onto the home for about a decade before selling it in the early 2010s for roughly $894,500. It was destroyed by a fire a year later. In 2013, Cornwall-based CSA Architects secured permits to renovate the property, adding a moat and a drawbridge to complement the nearby Tintagel Castle.\n\nBelsize townhouse\n\nWinslet met her second husband, director Sam Mendes, in 2001, and the pair married in 2003. Together they purchased a five-bedroom townhouse in the tony north London neighborhood of Belsize Park for about $3.57 million in today’s dollars. Details of the pad as Winslet and Mendes purchased it are scant, but the residence made headlines when they sold it to fellow A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin for $4.1 million two years later. Paltrow and Martin bought the two homes on either side of Winslet’s former residence and created a massive 33-room mansion, working with Martin’s architect brother to restore the home’s original Art Deco period details and make other renovations, including adding three more bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms, a home gym, and a rec room for the kids.\n\nWestcote Manor\n\nIn 2003 Winslet and Mendes welcomed their son, Joe Alfie Mendes. Around that time, they purchased an English country mansion in a secluded part of the Cotswolds for $5.9 million. The property, known as Westcote Manor, boasted an eight-bedroom main house situated on 22 acres, as well as a barn and a stone cottage. The couple reportedly spent an extensive amount of money to renovate the mansion, as well as to convert the barn into a cinema, rehearsal room, and film-editing suite. The couple split in 2010, and it is unclear whether or not Winslet still owns this home.\n\nManhattan penthouse\n\nShortly after purchasing Westcote Manor, Winslet and Mendes paid $4.995 million for a luxurious penthouse in NYC’s Chelsea neighborhood. The duplex unit measured over 3,000 square feet, with four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, as well as a rooftop terrace with views of the Hudson River and the city skyline. The great room spanned nearly 47 feet wide and included floor-to-ceiling shelving, an open chef kitchen, and a fireplace. Most of the bedrooms were on the lower level, while the second floor had a large room that could serve as an additional bedroom, an office, or a lounging area. After Winslet and Mendes called it quits on their marriage, Winslet bought out the director’s share of the property in 2012. She kept it for nearly another decade and rented it out before finally selling it for $5.3 million in 2021.\n\n17th-century mansion"
