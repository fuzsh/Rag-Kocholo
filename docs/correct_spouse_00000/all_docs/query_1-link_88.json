        "text": "Winlset met her first love, actor Stephen Tredre, when she was 15 years old. Tredre was 28 at the time. \"Stephen made me feel secure and embraced,\" she told Parade magazine in 2006 (via People). \"Stephen was very inspiring. He had this extraordinary zest for life. My life revolved around him.\"\n\nTredre was diagnosed with bone cancer shortly after, and they split when his cancer was in remission. \"I don't know why. I was so young, when I look back on it. Only 19. How could I have left a person who was so unwell? I thought Stephen was going to be all right,\" Winslet added.\n\nTredre died in 1997, the same week that \"Titanic\" debuted.\n\nWhile Winslet and Sewell briefly dated in 1995, the two would eventually end up reconnecting — this time on set. More than a decade after their split, Winslet and Sewell went on to star alongside each other in the hit 2006 rom-com \"The Holiday.\" \"It was completely fine,\" Winslet told the Irish Examiner about working with her ex. \"I hadn't seen him for a very long time but we'd remained friends. It was really not a big deal. I was thrilled he got the part.\" In the film, Winslet played Iris, and Sewell played her not-so-lovable ex, Jasper.\n\nWinslet and Jim met in 1997 on the set of \"Hideous Kinky,\" in which she starred as Julia and he worked as a third assistant director. The two wed in 1998 and split in 2001, just one year after welcoming their daughter, Mia Threapleton. Winslet opened up about her relationship with Jim in a 2006 interview with Parade (via CBS News). \"I thought I wanted to be with him,\" she explained. \"I was dealing with the pain of having lost Stephen and 'Titanic' coming out. Jim was just a regular guy, and that had a big impact on me.\"\n\nJim also spoke out about his split from Winslet in an interview with The Guardian in August 2007 and shared how he worked things out with her husband at the time in regards to their daughter. \"I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for his work, and subsequently, I've found out over the years that he's a fantastic person to be in Mia's life,\" he said. \"The hardest thing with divorce when children are involved is working out how the new relationship will work. You are obligated to generate new terms of friendship quickly, and I had beers with Sam as soon as possible so that there was never going to be this sense that we couldn't talk.\"\n\nWinslet then moved on with Sam, whom she wed in 2003. Their meeting wasn't by chance, but rather it happened when Mendes had hoped to cast her in two plays he was directing at London's Donmar Warehouse theater, though she had no intention of taking on the roles. \"Didn't want to do the plays, definitely wanted to get his phone number,\" she told Vanity Fair in November 2008. The two welcomed their son, Joe Mendes, in 2003, but announced their split in 2010. Their divorce was finalized in 2011.\n\nIn the same Parade interview, Winslet gushed over her immediate connection with Sam. \"I walked away dazzled, thinking, 'What the hell was that?' I knew this was the person I was meant to be with,\" she shared. \"I was terrified. I didn't tell anyone I had this feeling, not even my mum. I had no idea if Sam felt anything for me.\"\n\nWinlset also spoke about how the media coverage surrounding her two divorces was brutal, but it wasn't the worst thing that had happened to her: \"It was shattering, but it was nothing compared to losing Stephen.\"\n\nWinslet had a brief romance with the model. According to the The Mirror, the two split in November 2010 after just four months of dating. Dowler was left stunned and hurt by Winslet's decision to call it quits on their relationship. \"I don't think Kate behaved well and it is still very raw for me,\" Dowler told the Daily Mail a year later. \"I was in love with her and you can't switch that off overnight. I'm not sure Kate treated me well.\"\n\nWinslet finally found her happily ever after with Smith — who used to be known as Ned Rocknroll — after meeting him in 2011 during a vacation at Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island estate, per Us Weekly. The couple was engaged the following year and married that same year. \"I can confirm that Kate Winslet married Ned Rocknroll in NY earlier this month in a private ceremony attended by her two children and a very few friends and family,\" Winslet's rep told Us Weekly in December 2012. \"The couple had been engaged since the summer.\" The duo welcomed their son, Bear Blaze Winslet, in December 2013.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times in June 2021, Winslet praised her husband for being the best caretaker of both her and their son and for always being there for her no matter what they need. \"He looks after us, especially me. I said to him earlier, like, 'Neddy, could you do something for me?' He just went, 'Anything,'\" she shared. \"He is an absolutely extraordinary life partner.\"\n\n\"I'm so, so, so lucky. For a man who is severely dyslexic, as he is, he's great at testing me on lines,\" she added of Smith helping her with work. \"It's so hard for him to read out loud, but he still does it.\""
