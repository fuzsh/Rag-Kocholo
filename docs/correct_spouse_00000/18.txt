Kate Winslet and her director husband Sam Mendes confirm their separation

They were one of the movie industry's most successful couples, with a home littered with directing and acting gongs, but sadly the Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes powerhouse is no longer - their lawyer has confirmed that the pair have separated after seven years of marriage.

In a statement released yesterday, London-based firm Schillings announced that the 34-year-old actress separated from Mendes earlier this year, saying:

"[the split was] entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement.

"Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children. They ask that the media respect the privacy of the family."

Very sad news.

The pair married in a private ceremony in the Caribbean in 2003 and last teamed up professionally for the Oscar-nominated Revolutionary Road (Kate as the lead and Sam behind the clapper-board). They have one child together, Joe, while Kate also has a nine-year-old daughter Mia from her first marriage to Jim Threapleton.

One thing is for sure - you won't get Kate and Sam doing a Katie and Peter and spilling the details of their split, so we'll definitely just respect their privacy.
