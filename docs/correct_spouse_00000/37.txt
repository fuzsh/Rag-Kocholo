Kate Winslet and her film-director husband Sam Mendes are to separate after seven years of marriage, the couple’s lawyers have announced.

The pair met in 2001 and married in May 2003, on a whim while on holiday in Anguilla.

“Kate and Sam are saddened to announce that they separated earlier this year,” said a statement by lawyers Schillings. “The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement. Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children. They ask that the media respect the privacy of the family.”

Winslet has a nine-year-old daughter, Mia, from her first marriage to film-maker Jim Threapleton, while the couple have a son, Joe, who was born in 2003.

Mendes won an Oscar for his film directorial debut American Beauty in 2000, while his other movies include Road To Perdition, Jarhead, and Away We Go.
