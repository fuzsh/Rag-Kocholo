Actress Kate Winslet and director Sam Mendes have married. A spokeswoman for the couple said they wed last month during a holiday in the West Indies.

Winslet's daughter Mia and three close friends attended the private ceremony.

It is the second marriage for Titanic star Winslet and the first for Mendes, director of Road to Perdition and American Beauty. She split from first husband Jim Threapleton in 2001 after three years of marriage. The couple have a 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Mia.
