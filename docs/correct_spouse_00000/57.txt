Oh, snap! Hereâs a split I didnât see coming. Us Weekly has confirmation that Oscar winners Kate Winslet & Sam Mendes are calling it quits. They were married in 2003, and they have one child together, son Joe, who is 6 years old. Kate also has a daughter with her first husband, daughter Mia, who is 9. Mendes won the Best Director Oscar for his first feature film, American Beauty, in 2000. Kate won her first Oscar last year, for her performance in The Reader.

Kate Winslet has split from her husband, film director Sam Mendes.

In a statement, London-based Schillings law firm tells UsMagazine.com: “Kate and Sam are saddened to announce that they separated earlier this year. The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement. Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children. They ask that the media respect the privacy of the family.”

Winslet wed Mendes in 2003. They have a son Joe, 6.

She was previously wed to Jim Threapleton, with whom she has a daughter, Mia, 9.

This is sad. I thought they were a really solid, grounded couple. Although, now that we can look back, maybe there were signs that they were having problems? Kate is in the middle of taking some time off from Hollywood to focus on her family. And Kate has always been pretty honest about her struggles as a working mother, and the time away from her husband and kids while sheâs working. As far as Sam goes, I really donât know that much about him. Is he capable of cheating on Kate? Maybe. Is she capable of cheating on him? Maybe. Weâll see if there are any more scandals with this couple yet to come.

Oh my God, do you think she and Leonardo will finally find their way to each other?!?
