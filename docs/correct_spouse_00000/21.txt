This is sad. I thought they were a in reality solid, grounded couple. Although, now that we will look back, maybe there have been indicators that they had been having issues?

And Kate has at all times been beautiful fair about her struggles as a running mother, and the time clear of her husband and children whilst sheâs running. As far as Sam goes, I actually donât know that a lot about him. Is he capable of dishonest on Kate? Maybe. Is she in a position to dishonest on him? Maybe. Weâll see if there are to any extent further scandals with this couple but to come back.
