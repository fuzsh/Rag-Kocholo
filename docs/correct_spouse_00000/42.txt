Kate Winslet's marriage to Sam Mendes hit the rocks after they made a movie together about a couple who break up, friends said last night.

Months of stormy rows followed the filming of Revolutionary Road, in which Mendes directed his wife co-starring with Leonardo DiCaprio.

They culminated in a joint statement by the couple confirming they had parted.

She added in an interview: 'Going into it, I did have several moments where I would say, "Oh my God, what if we have a row? What will we do?" And Sam would say, "Oh, don't be silly, of course we won't." And I was thinking, "Oh, well, I'm sure we won't - I hope we don't".'

Mendes, who has a long history of dating beautiful women, including actress Rachel Weisz, before he wed Miss Winslet, admitted there was 'some kind of identification' in the film.
