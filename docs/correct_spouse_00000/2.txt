Sam Mendes has branded rumours that he cheated on his wife Kate Winslet with actress Rebecca Hall as "utter nonsense" and "ridiculous."

Mendes and Winslet announced their split after nearly seven years of marriage recently.

While a joint statement claimed that the break-up was amicable, the Daily Mail have claimed Winslet was becoming unhappy with the amount of time Mendes was spending with Hall.

Mendes and Hall met after she starred in 2006's "Starter For Ten", a British romantic comedy, which was produced by Mendes.

They've been seen together more recently in London and New York, where they were reportedly working on productions for his Bridge Project theatre company.

A source told the paper, "When Kate found out that Sam had grown close to Rebecca, she was upset. Rebecca is totally Sam's type - a thespian mix of brains and beauty."

However, the director's publicist called the allegations "ridiculous", "utter nonsense" and "untrue."

Winslet is currently taking a bikini breather in sunny Mexico with her kids, Joe, 6, and Mia, 9, and friends.
